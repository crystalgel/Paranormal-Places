I have another story which is more current. I work at a psychiatric
hospital. A few weeks ago, a coworker was keeping a constant eye on one
patient doing a one to one we call it. The patient was in his room and
saying, they're biting me, and scratching me. He told him, nobody is
hurting you. They both walked out to the dining room shortly after and
sat at a table. Other patients told the worker, your hand is bleeding.
He looked down and had several scratches down the back of his own hand.
He did not feel it happen or know when it occurred. What he did know
was that this happened just after telling the patient he wasn't being
bitten or scratched. This same patient room has reoccurring plumbing
problems where the toilet overflows. The same guy was doing room checks
weeks later and saw what looked like someone looking into the window of
the room. He glanced back and it disappeared.&nbsp; I know there have
been suicides that have occurred through the years there from what
coworkers have told me. It probably does have a few lost souls still
haunting the place.<br>

Haunted Home in Seekonk<br>
<br>

I believe that we have two resident ghosts in our home; one being an
elderly female and the other a male.&nbsp; We have some cold spots
(mostly in the shower) but not many.&nbsp; What we do have is things
being moved, objects being thrown across the room, sounds of someone
walking around the kitchen when no one is in there, etc.&nbsp; One day,
I was in the living room picking up some toys that my grandchildren
left on the floor when I felt, what I thought, was my husband's hand on
my lower back as if he were walking behind me.&nbsp; However, when I
stood up expecting to see him, he was not even in the room.&nbsp; He
actually was at his computer with his back to the room!&nbsp; Sometimes
we see dark shapes out of the corner of our eyes but when you turn;
there is no one there.&nbsp; One day we were both in the dining room
talking and my daughter was in the living room.&nbsp; The weather was
nice and the back door was open.&nbsp; We all heard a woman's voice
saying "Hello!&nbsp; Hello!"&nbsp;&nbsp; I was up, so I went to the
door, but no one was there, no one was in the driveway.&nbsp; We live
at a major intersection and the traffic is terrible; there is no way
someone got out of our driveway that fast!&nbsp; My little
granddaughter (was was 3 years old at the time) was laying down with my
daughter and they were talking.&nbsp; She kept looking up at the
ceiling and smiling and waving.&nbsp; Finally, my daughter asked her
what she was smiling and waving at.&nbsp; And she said the man up there
and that he was coming down to say hi.&nbsp; This freaked my daughter
out so much that she just grabbed her and came in the dining room with
us! There have been many instances in this home and not just one family
member experiencing these.&nbsp; We all have!<br>

Robinson Woods, Chicago Illinois<br>
<br>
<br>
By: msirismckenzie@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I lived in this area for over 30 years.<br>
Robinson Woods is the home of Chief Chee-Chee-Pin-Quay (as it is
spelled on the sign), and the site of his burial marker. He was the
last Chief of the Potowatami Indians, and he was related to the
Robinson Family. He died in 1953. There have been numerous 'ghost
hunting' expeditions conducted here, with reports of drums and shadowy
forms of an Indian in pictures in the woods surrounding the memorial
marker.<br>
These woods are connected to Catherine Woods, west of East River Road,
south of the Kennedy Expressway. There is a trail that leads from
behind the Chief's memorial marker, going to a small branch of the Des
Plaines River. It is along this river that John Wayne Gacy buried
several of his victims. Additionally, there have been numerous bodies
found here over the years. In the late 1950's, two brothers went
missing and were killed, and their bodies were discovered here.<br>
The area of these woods, more toward the Catherine Woods side (just
south of the expressway) is where the American Airlines flight went
down, killing all on board.<br>
On the east side of East River Road, there used to be a horse back
riding stable called Happy Days Stables, which was the sight of many
illicit doings. John Wayne Gacy was known to be friends with one of the
stable hands that worked there in the 50's and 60's, and he was a
frequent visitor there. This stable hand is the one who was responsible
for killing the two brothers in the late 1950's, and it is local legend
that Gacy participated in the rape, torture and subsequent murders of
these boys, and this was the beginning of his killing spree. Of course,
both Gacy and the other man died without ever revealing the truth of
this.<br>
These woods have been the site of more phenomenon than can be counted.
Generations of kids have gone there to dare each other to face their
fears. I have personally experienced, the drums in the woods, the face
of an Indian behind the marker, felt overwhelming fear, anger, sadness
and evil along the river behind the trail and horrifying fear around
the airplane crash site.<br>

The Patient<br>
<br>
By: spankinnewdiva84@msn.com <br>
<br>
This wasn't too long ago, probably about a couple months back.
June,2008.&nbsp; I used to live CO I now live in St Joseph
Missouri.&nbsp; One day I decided to skip work because I wasn't feeling
very good, so I called up my friend Erin and we went to brkfast and
went down to the MO river to see how high it was getting because we had
gotten so much rain last summer that Faucett the town I lived in and
Agency the town down the street was getting flooded.&nbsp; Anyways,
after we left the MO river I told her about the Glore Psychiatric
Musuem and how me and my boyfriend had went there the year before when
we just came to Visit. *Note* that I just moved here almost a year
ago.&nbsp; Anyways, so I didn't know exactly where it was so we had
called 411 and to get the number well when Erin had called asking where
the location the lady put erin on hold to get the exact address. Erin
looked at me and said "How does this lady not know her work address?" I
said "Well does she sound old?" and she said " Umm yeah like too old to
be alive."&nbsp; The lady got back on the phone and told erin the
address.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we got there, the parking lot was
empty.&nbsp; I looked at her and said " Wow this is place is dead" and
she said " Dude I know.. it's even creepier because it's kind of dark
and rainy and very cloudy."&nbsp; We get in there and we paid the lady
our fee and I told erin we should go look in the gift shop. Well I
wanted to buy this shot glass I found, but no one running the gift shop
so I had erin go ask the elderly lady if she could help us and she said
" Oh sure dear I'm sorry I'm the only one here today so I tend to
forget I have more to do"&nbsp; THEN WHO IN THE WORLD WAS SHE TALKING
TO AND ASKING FOR THE ADDRESS?. That was one strange thing.&nbsp; Now
the Glore Musuem is actually on here on Shadowlands if you go to
Haunted places and then click on MO scroll all the way down to Glore
Musuem.. yeah! Okay. So When me and my boyfriend made out first visit,
I didn't know it was haunted, but as soon as I walked in I could
definitely sense it.&nbsp; So, that day Erin and I took the tour. It
was more amazing that I remembered and very interesting. I remember
seeing the blanket that this lady patiend sowed. It was
interesting.&nbsp; We made our way to the 3rd floor which is the one I
wanted to see first.&nbsp; I felt there was someone watching walk the
stairs but I knew it would freak erin out so I didn't say
anything.&nbsp; As we reached the top of the stairs over to my right I
see this man. A fat man, he had a red shirt on and blue cap. He was in
the room down the hall way where it shows all the way they treated a
patient like the Cold water bath or the chains and the chair. Weird. He
glanced my way and I grabbed erin's arm and i said " omg Erin tell me
you see him too?" and she said "Who?" I said "The man down the hall"
she said " Ohhh right okay yeah I see him dude, no worries".&nbsp; Well
there was so much to see so we stood looking around and then made our
way down the hall towards the room where I saw the man.&nbsp; Btw we
didn't see anyone walk past us coming back.. So after the 3rd floor we
went down to the basement where the Morgue is.&nbsp; I felt really
uneasy down there, it's also where the kids played and made sculptures
and they had a whole room where the kids painted this El Camino truck.
It was really awesome.&nbsp; Erin and I split up and went our separate
ways. She was on one end of the hall way and I was at the other.&nbsp;
I kept hearing laughter, so I thought to myself " What she can
seriously be laughing at?". So I ignored it and went about my looking
around and I looked in the morgue and thought to myself how sad they
had to have been and creepy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well as I stood there I could
feel that someone was standing beside me and I didn't think anything of
it because I thought it was just Erin catching up.&nbsp; When I turned
my head to ask her something no one was there. I shrugged it off and I
just figured I was creeping myself out. I started to head down to the
part where I knew erin was, but I heard footstep walking behind me that
we'ren't my own and I heard soft talking, I figured it was erin
following me and she was on her phone but was trying to be quiet which
is weird because she is not a quiet girl. No one was behind me. Weird
thing is , Erin came walking back down the stairs and I said "
DUDE&nbsp; where you been?" and she goes "Ummm I went to the bathroom
and to smoke a cig, I told you I would be right back" I said " No no
you didn't nor did you tell me anyof that and I thought you were down
here earlier, I heard you laughing" Erin said " umm yeah dude that
wasn't me lets go this place gives me the creeps".&nbsp; As we were
leaving we told the lady to have a good day and she oh I will you too
thank you, I'm going to sit here and wait till we close, you 2 are the
only ones who have come in all day.&nbsp; We laughed it off and then
realized as we drove off that we were actually alone in the
place.&nbsp; We got back to her place and I said " Okay I'm gonna get
on Shadowlands and check out what they say about the glore museum" Erin
looked at me like I lost my mind " she said dude wtf is shadowlands?" I
said it's a website about the paranormal and she said " okay."&nbsp; As
I'm looking it up I'm talking to her about the guy I saw and she said "
no he wasn't fat and he didn't have no blue hat on either" So I as I'm
reading about the Glore museums haunting she said " dude the guy I saw
had brown paints and stripped shirt on" Which is what it exactly
describes as the man who is normally seen on the 3rd floor.... Also it
says that you do hear laughter of the children, so what I heard
apparently wasn't erin. I apparently had kids all around me....<br>

Cinema Experience<br>
<br>
By: mommieem@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
<br>
ok, so this seriously happened...today...just a few hours ago...i'm
FREAKING out!!!<br>
i am a HUGE scary movie person. on valentine's day, my sweet, darling
husband decided to take me to see friday the 13th (which opened on
v-day), even though he HATES scary movies. while it was a super sweet
gesture, i was still in pain from a wreck i had had prior, and we ended
up leaving some time into the movie. the look on my husband's, ricky's,
face said it all...he was soooo happy to be getting out of there!<br>
well, today, my girlfriend, amanda, (who is also a HUGE scary movie
fan) and i decided we would go to see the matinee showing at 11:40 am.
we went to the same small theater that ricky and i had gone to. it is a
semi-small theater, not new at all, and the closest one to our home.<br>
to our delight, we see that we are the only ones in the theater. we, of
course, are being loud and silly and, who really cares, right? we're
alone! <br>
except, amanda and i both feel someone watching us. we laugh it
off...saying the kids working in the theater are video taping us and
that we'll be on youtube in the morning as the number one hit
video...funny, right? our comedy soon turned to terror...<br>
ok, let's get our bearings here...we are at an older, smaller theater;
we're alone in the auditorium; there is only one entrance into this
particular auditorium and someone would have to walk right past us to
come in; we're watching a very frightening movie; we both feel someone
watching us...<br>
around mid-movie, amanda and i BOTH at the EXACT same moment, hear a
LOUD crackling in the back corner of the theater over our right
shoulder...the opposite side of the entrance to the theater. BOTH our
heads snap in the SAME direction at the EXACT same time. i slowly turn
back to amanda and say, "you heard that, didn't you"? it was a stupid
question...i KNEW she had. moments later, amanda, who is NEVER cold,
said, "i am freezing!" i look at her and her nose is bright red. as she
touches it and tells me her nose is cold, i feel the same coldness
engulf me.<br>
at that moment, it felt like a ton of bricks had landed on my head. THE
ARNOLD THEATER IS HAUNTED!!! I HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN!!!<br>
i have been a big fan of the shadowlands website for a long time, but
haven't been there in a while.<br>
i had developed seizures for a few years and at the same time all of
this was happening, jason is hacking up bodies on the huge screen in
front of me, and i feel sick...sick like i'm going to have a seizure. i
turned from the screen, thinking it was just the same effect i have
felt during certain movies, such as speed racer.<br>
while still feeling ill; still feeling cold; still feeling someone
watching us; i realize that these are ALL symptoms of a real encounter
with a ghost...as i write this, i am STILL shaking and STILL
afraid...and i AM NOT like this!!!<br>
here is what the site says about our theater:<br>
arnold, missouri - wherenberg theater arnold 14 cine: ever since the
place was built, there has been said to be an evil presence. during the
movies, there are sudden bone chilling gusts of wind that hit you out
of nowhere. people have felt an unseen thing touch them throughout the
theater. workers that come in at midnight to clean have seen shadows
and ghostly figures traveling the hallways and auditoriums. reflections
of bloody and disfigured people have been seen in the mirrors in the
bathrooms.<br>
luckily, the only bloody and disfigured people we saw were on the big
screen, BUT a LOT of the women's bathroom stalls were locked from the
inside and inaccessible... <br>
ricky called...i told him the story...he's made it clear that he WILL
NOT be at ANY movie with me at the arnold theater...EVER!!!<br>
i plan to return and possibly try to record some evidence of this
entity in the form of a photo or sound recording...i will make sure to
keep you posted. since it is considered "evil" to those that have
described it, i will ONLY go as far as a sound recording or photo, or
both.<br>
thank you for your time. i love your site and i hope you find this
story interesting and helpful.<br>

Static Attack<br>
<br>
By: rohan.w@live.com.au<br>
<br>
I live in Sydney, Australia and we moved into the house I currently
lived in about 2 years ago and went rent and share it with my
grandparents. It was in between 1 and 2 in the morning with my cousin
Amber pulling a late night where the scariest and 'what the hell'
moment I have ever experienced. Her and I finished watching a movie
when I left it on just plain static while her and I check something on
the computer. I hear the TV making a slight noise where her and I go to
check it out. All of a sudden we hear a loud burst of screaming from
it. My lamp and the lights in my bedroom and my computer room
(conjoined rooms) flicker and then they blow out. I didn't know what
the hell happened but I nearly crapped my pants. My cousin was holding
onto me and said 'What the f***'. I have seen other things in my house
such as shadows and the one time door slam which there wasn't any wind.
Another experience my cousin told me about (a different one) was when
she was sleeping she heard someone whisper her name and then waking up
to find nothing. She wakes up and goes to the bathroom and comes back
to her room finding her door locked. She goes around the house and
opens her window to her bedroom and gets in. She walks over to the
locked door and finds a skateboard pegging the door closed. Few months
later they move out to a house down the road from it and live perfectly
fine without any disturbances. As for my house, well I continue to live
in it becoming amazed by any more experiences I could have, however
nothing has happened so far.<br>

The Girl in the Green Dress<br>
<br>
By: dino-rawr@live.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I was only about 3 years old when I first started to see things in my
old house. It started with the noises in the attic. I would hear a
rocking chair rocking in the attic directly above my bed, however that
portion of the attic had nothing in it at all, the floor would not have
even supported the weight. My old house was a 1950's home, the basement
still had an old coal room (however, the coal chute was sealed shut to
prevent breaking-in). The coal room was directly below my bedroom, and
it was the only part of the house no one ever went into. I can only
recall ever even seeing the door open once, it was an empty, depressing
kind of room. In addition to the noises above, I would sometimes hear
footsteps in that old room below me, or footsteps on the basement
stairs. <br>
The first time I ever saw anything was, as I said, when I was around 3
years old. I woke from my sleep in the middle of the night to see a
young girl standing by my bed. She had brown hair and green eyes, and
wore a 19th century-style green nightgown. She looked to be about 8
years old. She frightened me at first, but I didn't get malicious
feelings from her, and gradually I accepted her and even had
conversations with her - she appeared to me often throughout my
childhood, and even now I see her occasionally. <br>
The other ghost I saw was much scarier. I wasn't the first one to see
him, my younger brother was. He was a tall man who held a knife in one
hand and wore black. My brother began seeing him when he was about 5
years old. The man would appear in his closet, begin to walk toward
him, and then my brother in his fear would scream and the man would
disappear when my parents came running. I had never told anyone about
my experiences with ghosts, for I was afraid I would be called crazy,
but my brother told us all about what he saw. He saw the man a total of
four times, once in each of our bedroom's and twice in mine. I saw the
man twice, but I didn't begin seeing him until I was much older -
around 9 years old. I always got a fairly bad feeling from the man, and
Victoria (the name I gave the little girl) would always disappear
before he appeared. I got the sense that she was scared of him for some
reason.<br>
In addition to this, when my great-grandma passed away I inherited her
jewelry box. The first night I had it I had left it sitting open on my
bedroom floor when I went to bed (I was around 6 years old). I was
lying awake in bed when suddenly the movie in my VCR fell out of the
VCR and onto the floor. A few minutes later, my TV turned on. There was
no one else in the room at the time. As I got up to turn it off, it
turned itself off. A few nights later, I had once again been playing
with the jewelry in the jewelry box. I awoke to find my basketball
bouncing itself repeatedly against my dresser, sideways. There was no
one else in my room at the time and it kept it up for over a half hour.
After that I became frightened and stowed the box away in the back of
my closet. To this day I will not open it, even though I am now
sixteen. <br>
The scariest thing of all happened when I was 11. I awoke in the middle
of the night unable to move the lower half of my legs. Terrified, I sat
up to see a strange black shadow sitting on my feet. It was blurry, but
that may have been partly because my glasses were sitting on my bedside
table. At first I thought it was my black cat, but quickly realized
that it was much too big. It was transparent. It was about half the
size of a small child, but the thing itself isn't what scared me. It's
the feeling that I got from it. I felt terrified like I've never felt
in my life, as if the strange shadow was pure evil. I struggled to move
my legs and then ran into my parent's room and woke them up. It's the
only time I've ever told them of my paranormal happenings. My dad came
into my room and turned my light on, but of course the thing was gone.
He insisted I was dreaming and tried to get me back to sleep, but I
slept on their floor for a week straight after that. <br>
I have since moved into a new house. My grandma died here and we moved
in afterward, because she left it and everything else of hers to us. I
don't have as many experiences here, but there in one that stands out
in my mind. I awoke in the middle of the night and I could feel someone
laying against my back, their knees curled under mine and their arm
around me. I freaked out and literally jumped onto my footboard and
flicked my light on, but nothing was there. My mom was woke up from the
commotion and I told her about it. She told me it was my grandma,
keeping me safe as I slept. And then a few days later we drove to the
cemetary where my grandma is buried. We took my grandma's dog with us.
The whole way there she was silent. Once we got to my grandma's grave,
the dog went crazy. She began to bark and whine and paw at the windows
frantically. We thought it must have been a squirrel or something but
there were no animals in sight, not even a bird. My mom thinks that the
dog saw something we couldn't, and I have to say I agree. <br>
I have had many, many other experiences and these are just the ones I
was reminded of by reading other stories on your website. I wrote a
lot, sorry, I tried to narrow it down a bit. I've tried seances and
things with my very good friend who has similar experiences to mine and
we have been successful at this, it really shocks me sometimes because
we will both get an image in our head or see something and we can
finish each other's sentences, that's how precisely we see these
things. I definitely believe in the paranormal and I hope to show other
people the truth.<br>

Run-in with the Demon<br>
<br>
By: mothwing@comcast.net<br>
<br>
I was driving past Scotts on a Sunday afternoon. I know this because I
may not have a head for dates, but Madissen does; and she was sitting
right next to me in the car. I was about 11 when this happened, about
three years ago, but I remember nearly every detail. And when you have
a memory like mine, remembering something this well, for so long has to
count for something. I saw a pale man wearing a white T-shirt, wet with
sweat or water, or something, and blue jeans. His jacket was on the
pavement. It was odd because there was like a wide circle where nothing
was around him. There are seagulls all over this parking lot because
there was a McDonalds nearby, but they avoided him at all cost. I could
see trash being blown around the edges of the circle, but never
entering it. I couldn't tell the age from my distance. He held his
hands up, like he was proclaiming something to the heavens, his head
thrown back, and he looked like he was trying to stay from falling
backwards, but was going to fall on his knees from the effort. I don't
know why no one else seemed to see this, Madissen was looking the other
way, but Mom, who was driving, didn't even notice. I saw something fly
from what looked like around his throat, and go up into the sky at a
rate where it was difficult for my eyes to follow. But I did see what
it looked like. At first, it was like a really dark grey shopping bag,
but I saw like strands of light coming from it, then as they flowed
from this thing, they spread out and became like shadows until they
became so spread it was impossible for the human eye to see. I got a
sense of total fear, that I should look away, and I almost did. I don't
get scared easily, but this was terrifying. I didn't see a face on this
thing, I think it's back was turned towards me. It was shaped like a
small person cloaked in these ribbons of light and shadow. <br>
Of course I told Madissen what I had seen, and my mother, but neither
of them had seen it for themselves, and did not believe me. This made
me very angry, of course. I became silent and kept playing over in my
head what I had just seen. <br>
Madissen had always been interested in ghosts and demons and such, but
she still never believed I saw this demon until recently. Now she is
trying to get someone to investigate her house and see if it's haunted.
<br>
I have had some little things here and there after seeing that thing in
Scotts. I do believe it is a demon. I do think there is a spirit in my
house, and Maddi thinks so as well. Once loud footsteps woke me, and I
thought we were being robbed. When they stopped and I heard nothing
else, I went downstairs and saw both my parents fast asleep. I never
found out what caused them. I also see smaller things, like a shadow
moving, or a small flash of light in a dark corner. I ignore them. They
don't really bother me. But I hardly ever have people spend the night
here, my room freaks them out. I sleep in it practically every night,
so the eerie feeling from it has almost because like a second nature
for me. But it's still there. Like I said, I don't get scared easily.
Things moving in the dark, flashes of light, even seeing the shape of a
face in my room at night doesn't scare me much because they're
harmless. Whenever I get out of the shower, the steam creates odd
symbols on the mirror. Very distinct. The symbol I see most often is
normally a sideways heart. But normally I see... like words made from
the letters X, C and O. Always beginning with X. I see them in my
dreams sometimes too. Normally including a dark wooden structure and
strange spiders. They may not sound important, but when I described
this to my friend, Moon, she told me about having dreams with the same
symbols. I had never mentioned these before to her. <br>
I never saw that thing, which I believe to be a demon, again. And I'm
glad. I never want to see it again. I'm not used to being terrified.
Let me know if you have had similar sightings to mine.<br>

Okay...so we moved here to our house in Amarillo, Texas August 15 2008
and since some weird stuff has happened that has brought me to the
conclusion that this house has something in it.....<br>
When we first moved in my 14 year old daughter and I both became a
little freaked out when we were in the main bathroom both of heard
people having conversation and laughing and talking in what sounded
like her room. <br>
my daughter would go check her room out and the living room only to
find us in another room, asleep, or quietly watching t.v. When I heard
it, I thought she was on the phone (I usually heard these late at
night) and would go into her room to make sure she wasn't staying up
all night on her cell to find her fast asleep. <br>
In the computer room, one entire wall is a huge mirror closet my
daughter and I have both seen faces and people standing behind us from
the corner of our eyes.....<br>
In the dining room we have a mirror facing the table, I have various
times seen something refected in the mirror fuzzy and white and moving
around thinking it was the cat only to realize the cat was outside. <br>
My husband, "Donald", has heard me call his name many many times from
other rooms, he would bound into whatever room I was in, frustrated and
say "Why are yelling for me" for me to just stand there staring at him
wondering what was going on as I hadn't said a word. Each time he heard
"Donald, COME HERE!!!!!" The most recent time was just last night as I
was getting out of the bath and looking for my nightgown, Donald opens
the door to our walk-in closet and says "What, Karen???" I'm respond
with "What!!! I'm just getting clothes!" He goes on to tell me he heard
me yelling for him loudly, my daughter said she heard me too. <br>
(This was originally written back in November 08)<br>
Two nights ago, I'm laying in bed around 3am fast asleep when I feel
something pull and tug on my feet over the covers. Thinking my four
year old son has wandered in to wake me up for something I sit up in
bed only to find Donald and my 8 month old son sound asleep and my four
year old son in his room sleeping soundly. I go back to bed, lay down
and have this happen again almost immediately....I know nobody is
awake, the cat is in the garage and I'm too tired to debate it so I
just pull my feet underneath me and go back to sleep. <br>
To this morning.........the creepiest so far....I'm still asleep at 9am
(yes I know, but you would be too if you had to get up with a baby 3-4
times a night still) I hear a door open, slam shut and hearing rustling
around in our kitchen. Because Donald sometimes comes home to grab
things he forgot at various times in the day I think nothing of it at
first, then I lay there waiting for him to come into the bedroom and
let me know he is home. As I'm laying there, I hear my four year old's
Iron Man toy go off "I am Iron Man" in its robotic voice....I'm
thinking...."What the hell is Donald doing in there?" By now my
curiousity has gotten the better of me, so I get up to see and NOBODY
is in the house. My four year old and 8 month old are still asleep, I
call Donald asking him where he is and he says "Karen, I'm up at the
office where I've been since 8am, what's up?" Now even freakier....I go
to find my four year old's Iron Man toy.....when I realize we left it
in Donald's truck last night...I call Donald again and ask him if our
son's Iron Man toy is still in his truck and sure enough it is. <br>
I haven't been actually scared yet, just creeped out....but it is some
freaking freaky stuff.......<br>
Update - December 08<br>
It feels like an old lady that disapproves of certain kinds of music or
vulgar movies because there is the one song that Donald has burned onto
TWO cd's and every time he plays it in the stereo that one song will
skip. He has re-downloaded it and everything and there is nothing wrong
with the song download or the cds its just weird because it will ALWAYS
mess up, the other thing is if we are watching a movie with a lot of
cussing or just general vulgarity the cable ALWAYS messes up. I have
called the cable company several times and they have repeatedly checked
the lines and box and nothing is wrong. It would make sense too because
I saw pictures of how this house was furnished before we moved in and
besides the obvious "old lady" taste I saw a wheelchair....so I'm
almost a bit spooked that an elderly lady passed on in this house. <br>
Update - January 2009<br>
Oh! And one other thing strange...several times Donald has been in the
master bathroom and had someone knock on the door, hard. He would come
back into the living room and ask if our four year old had been in
there when he had been with me in the living room the entire time. My
daughter has been in the same bathroom to have the light turned off on
her when the door is locked. Also, another time, my daughter likes that
Bartender song too and has had it turn off on her Ipod, the whole ipod
just turns off. It never does it on any other song.....Maybe the old
lady was an alcoholic! <br>
2nd Update January 2009<br>
The other day we were watching a movie in the computer room, in the
computer room we also have a full size bed, Donald was kind of half
laying on it with his feet hanging off when he jumps up and says "What
the hell???" He told me he had felt somebody run their hand up his
foot, like a thumb or something....Donald is not at all a believer in
ghosts but here lately he is a little freaked out, all though he did
say he wishes the ghost would have just rubbed his feet *LOL* <br>
3rd update February 8, 2009<br>
Okay....one week ago, when Donald was in Tulsa until Saturday night, my
daughter and I were just sitting around Saturday killing time before
she went to her friends house when we heard a very loud knock on the
patio door. The patio door is right in sight of where we were sitting,
yet we didn't see anybody. I got up, check the patio/deck, nothing was
out there. I hadn't even turned all the way around yet and I heard it
again, very loud and pronounced knocking and yet NOTHING IS OUT THERE
(this is in the middle of the day). About an hour later my daughter's
dvd player in her room literally burns up and starts smoking, I pulled
the plug and chunked it in the dumpster. (I don't think this had
anything to do with hauntings...but weird just the same) <br>
Friday night Donald was sitting in his recliner and he kept seeing a
blond head peek at him from the corner of his eye...he kept thinking it
was our four year old, but he was napping on the couch! Same night
before Donald told me about this, I walked by our four year old's room
to see a little blonde head in his room, looking like it was watching
t.v....I thought it was him except when I got to the living room there
was our son sitting on the couch...I stopped and said..."What the heck!
Has he been in here this whole time?" Yup!!!! <br>
Last night I kept hearing a banging noise in the house, I was EXHAUSTED
after my four year old's birthday party but I got up and said really
loudly in the hallway "STOP IT, I AM TRYING TO SLEEP!!!!!" Never heard
another sound.. My son was asleep in his room, the baby with us and our
daughter had gone to sleep before anyone last night. <br>
February 14, 2009 update-<br>
This has been the scariest so far.....in what may just sleep paralysis
my daughter awoke last night and said it felt like somebody was sitting
on her chest. She couldn't breathe, couldn't move and couldn't call
out. She came running into our bedroom and slept in our guest room all
night as she refused to go back to her room......She said she felt she
was wide awake but could not move. Again...I don't know if she was just
dreaming or what but if that happens again I don't think we will be
living here much longer....<br>
As of yet, that's all I have yet to report....but it is very freaky....<br>

I Think I Might Be Crazy<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Tisha.Jones@twc.edu<br>
<br>
No seriously.&nbsp; This happened to me while I was vacationing in
Florida (1-17-09)&nbsp; So&#8230;.I told my friend about what happened&#8230;or
what I think happened, and she confirmed that I was in need of a psych
eval.&nbsp; What a friend.&nbsp; Anyways&#8230;.maybe you&#8217;ll a little less
objective seeing as how you deal with this kinda a stuff on a regular
basis...<br>
I&#8217;ve had different occasions where I thought that I was completely
losing my mind.&nbsp; However, this occurrence pretty much solidified
that for me&#8230;<br>
I was visiting my mother and some friends in Florida and stayed with my
mother while vacationing to cut costs of course.&nbsp; She works nights
at the local hospital so I&#8217;m there alone from 7pm until 7am when she
works.&nbsp; It was Friday evening and my mom had just left for work, I
was hungry so I went out to grab a bite to eat.&nbsp; I got back to the
house around 8 and called my friend who was supposed to come over to
keep me company, but he was running a little late.&nbsp; So I decided
to keep myself entertained as I waited.&nbsp; I was in my room
listening to music and stuffing my face when I heard what I thought
sounded like church bells.&nbsp; Now, these bells would have had to be
kinda loud cause I listen to my music on blast.&nbsp; I turned down my
radio to hear the sound more clearly, all the while thinking to myself,
&#8220;There are no churches in the area that I know of.&#8221;&nbsp; Which made
this all the more strange.&nbsp; As I listened I heard the sound fade
off in the distance as if traveling away.&nbsp; I sat for a couple of
minutes and turned my music back up and continued eating.&nbsp;&nbsp;
About 15mins later I heard something like someone trying to get in
through the back door.&nbsp; My mom&#8217;s house is a little older, I&#8217;d say
about 40-50 years old, for someone to pry open the back door would not
be a difficult task.&nbsp; So naturally I ran to the back door to see
what was going on.&nbsp; Once there I saw that no one was there, but
the glass on the door near the knob was fogged up like cold water would
do in a glass cup.&nbsp; Thinking that was a little strange, I grabbed
the handle to open the door and I liked to screamed bloody
murder.&nbsp; The handle on that door was sub zero cold, and it really
caught me by surprise just from how incredibly cold it was.&nbsp; I
stepped out onto the porch, turned on the light, looked around a bit
for anything suspicious, and when I saw nothing, I reluctantly went
back inside.<br>
Concerned I kept my music to a minimum just in case anything else
happened as assuredly it did.&nbsp; About and hour later, I got a call
from my friend.&nbsp; Now, this is strange.&nbsp; He lives about five
minutes from my house driving and about 20 minutes walking, apparently
he came over to the house and rang the doorbell, heard my music playing
and figured that when I didn&#8217;t answer I was in the bathroom or
something&#8230;..He called my phone, but it kept cutting off after the first
ring, so he decided to go back home and come back since it&#8217;s not far at
all.&nbsp; He claims as he was backing out of my driveway he saw the
front door open, he rolled down the window to see if it was me, he said
as soon as he got the window all the way down, the front door violently
slammed shut.&nbsp; So hard that my friend thought for sure that the
front windows should have shattered.&nbsp; I heard none of this.&nbsp;
Around the time that he came over was coincidentally the same time I
heard the strange bells.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I was a little spooked and
told him to come over so he said give him about 15 mins and he be
over.&nbsp; Well, a lot can happen in 15 mins.&nbsp; I got off the
phone with him and went to the bathroom to freshen up a bit, I washed
my hands and face and dried them, I was heading back to my room when I
heard a faint sound in the living room, I was a little apprehensive to
see what was making the sound and started to think that perhaps I
wasn&#8217;t alone in my mother&#8217;s house.&nbsp; From my bathroom to the living
room, there is a long hallway.&nbsp; As I walked the hallway I sensed a
presence and it felt like a large presence (however that feels??)&nbsp;
Upon entering the living room I looked up and saw what looked like a
clergy man.&nbsp; I could see him clear as anything.&nbsp; My reaction
wasn&#8217;t what one would expect, looking back on the incident, it seems
unusual to me as well.&nbsp; I began to cry&#8230;.almost uncontrollably and
I still have no reason as to why.&nbsp; That&#8217;s when I heard a knock at
the door, my friend had arrived and as I stood there I saw the
apparition seemed to fade to nothing as he continued knocked and rang
the doorbell.&nbsp; I opened the door to my friend who seemed a little
taken himself.&nbsp; He asked me why I had been crying and unsure on
what to tell him, I simply said that I saw something sad on tv.&nbsp;
He asked if anyone else was in the house because he saw someone leave
out the back door.&nbsp; I told him it was my neighbor.&nbsp; I have
had many things happen to me&#8230;dreams and visions have been apart of my
life as far back as I can remember, but none of them compare to the
incident I had that night.<br>
Weird huh?<br>

My Story<br>
<br>
By: dianerunyan@ymail.com<br>
<br>
When I was around 7 or 8 years old I lived in Norwalk, California, with
my mom and my soon-to-be step father in a two bed room apartment.&nbsp;
There are two things I remember most about living in that
apartment.&nbsp; One was my beautiful princess canopy bed I slept in,
and the other was the floating woman's head I would see coming into my
bedroom from the hallway.&nbsp; I have and will never forget that
image.&nbsp; It looked like an older woman with long, course, grey,
messed up hair with some kind of hat.&nbsp; The first thing I think of
when I remember her face was she looked like a witch.&nbsp; Pointy
nose, moles on her face.&nbsp; From the moment I started seeing her
float in, she just stared directly at me, went around the poles of my
bed, and coming right at me.&nbsp; I would ALWAYS put the covers over
my head knowing she was right on top of me and shut my eyes hard, and
put my fingers in my ears until I felt ready to look again.&nbsp; <br>
I have always believed and been interested in paranormal/ghost
stories.&nbsp; After my grandmother died I felt her hand on my shoulder
at my then-boyfriend's house.&nbsp; I turned around, nobody was
there.&nbsp; But for some reason I knew it was her and I didn't feel
scared.&nbsp; I felt she was letting me know she's okay and with me.<br>
Lately, my sister and I have been looking at paranormal sites and
researching videos and pictures of ghosts/paranormal
stories.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your site is my favorite right now.&nbsp; I can't
seem to find any other sites that satisfy me.<br>

My Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: Angelface121491@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
When I was a young kid around 10 years old my mother and her new
husband,<br>
bought a house in the Swan Lake area of Bossier City, Louisiana. This
three bedroom<br>
and one bath and a half house was built in the early
seventies.&nbsp;&nbsp; This brick and wood<br>
home was nothing fancy it had the carport with a window through which
you see some <br>
walk up if you were standing by the kitchen sink. It also had a inside
utility door that <br>
you close if you did want anyone to see you in there. I would go to
stay there in the <br>
summer and help them wash dishes and clean the house. Well one day I
felt someone <br>
watching me through that carport door you know the feeling someone is
there, but<br>
no one was there, it got to the point I had to shut the inside utility
door to block the<br>
view. After I went back home my mother would call and tell me and my
real father who<br>
I lived with that she would a sleep on the couch and someone would
start up her car up.<br>
Me and my father would laugh and say mom or in his case Jane what are
you taking.<br>
Well one morning I was over visiting her when I saw a tall shadow it
must have been <br>
at least&nbsp; 6' 2" tall glide across her front living window on the
outside. You could tell this<br>
was a man but you see through it. From this day one I was a firm
believer in ghosts. <br>
One other night her new husband was grilling in the back yard and me
and my bother<br>
Michael, were really loud and cutting up in the kitchen. My mother
tried to get us to stop<br>
we would not then all of a sudden their were three loud knocks on the
carport door!&nbsp; I<br>
ran out the door thinking someone was playing a joke on us. I saw no
one running or <br>
hiding any where, Ralph her husband grilling did know what was going
on. Later we <br>
found out that two little girls who lived next door, grandfather would
come to visit them.<br>
He later died before my mother moved in that house, but the neighbor
said they had the friend<br>
who lived in that same house and the grandfather when he was alive
would go their and <br>
visit looking for his grand daughters.So we feel the ghost was his
looking for them even<br>
in the here after. I never felt afraid only amazed and wanted to study
it, more.&nbsp; I love to<br>
investigate the paranormal I believe that live goes on past the shell
of bodies we now have.<br>
Thank you, for letting me tell my story.<br>

Haunted Place in Mollala Oregon<br>
<br>
By: albanyguy2001@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
A few years back,i was at the white horse bar in mollala and was doing
a gig.when i was done,i left the back room,and walked though the
kitchen area,passed by a guy in a white outfit,who was preparing
food,or so i thought.I put my stuff out in my vehichle,came back in and
was going to get a bite to eat.I asked for a menu,and a bar maid gave
me one.I ordered food,and the bar maid headed back to make me my
food.after a while,she came back with my food,her and i talked,and
started dateing.Well a week or so later,I met the whole crew.3 girls
and the owner.I asked where their chef was,and the owner told me their
right here.I laughed,and said;what about the guy?They all gave me a
funny look,and said there is no guy.I explained the guy i seen a week
back,that apeared to be a cook,dressed in white,clothing,that similar
to a chef,and was faceing the kitchen stove,that i walked by.they all
gave me a weird look,and from there the owner talked about seeing
shadows go accross the back room area,late at night,and no one was
there.He told me the owner prior said a ghostly head was said to have
peered down from above the bar,one time in the past.I changed a light
bulb,that had to be replaced,the old one was loose,and burned out.i
tightened the new one in place,and tighten down the fixture,and we were
sitting down my girl at the time,and the owner,and another of the bar
ladies,and I joked,;the ghost here will probably flicker the light,and
the light will burn out.The crazy thing is,a couple seconds after that
the light flickered,and went out.A chill came over me,and looked like
every one else.The owner got another bulb,and i took the fixture
enclosure off,to find the bulb loose,but still good.One of the bar
maids researched the property,and told us the place along time back in
the past was a feed store and that a guy in his teens got crushed to
death from fallem feed sacks.<br>

Haunted House in Ohio<br>
<br>
By: khlinstrum@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
We lived in the "Haunted House" in 1992-1993. Everyone said that it was
haunted! At first everything was pretty normal but then one day my son
had a group of kids over for a cook out. After they left, we all went
to bed. In the middle of the night my son, Joe, woke up hearing the
sound of our lawn mower. When he went to sit up, he felt a great
pressure on his chest. He started to pray and felt it pull away from
him. Thinking that it was a bad dream, he went back to sleep. In the
morning my other son Bob came down stairs and asked,"who moved the
lawnmower?" My daughter , Erin, came down and said that she heard it
during the night. With that, they all ran outside and found that the
mower had been moved about 10-15 feet and NO grass was cut.&nbsp; That
was the beginning!!! After that we heard walking in the dining room and
the downstairs bedroom but no one was there. Our dog would look up as
though she could see something that we couldn't&nbsp; and start to
growl. The TV went on by itself, my radio went on by itself. <br>
I have heard that after we moved out, the people who moved in saw an
old man. They moved quite suddenly. Last March the local fire
department burned it down and several of the fire fighters would not go
in. My son Eric was one&nbsp; of the firefighters that did go in and he
said that he didn't see anything weird but we KNOW that we did while we
lived there.<br>

A House in Effingham South Carolina. <br>
<br>
By: germanpheonix@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
we had moved into that house.We kept seeing shadows moving around the
house. My son was only a couple of months old and he still drunk
formula. Me and my husband woke up in the middle of the night because
of a sound. Both of us got up and went into the kitchen. My sons
formula was upside down with the lid on the counter open in the sink
and non of the formula was spilt. The backyard was really creepy
looking and it always seemed like someone was watching. The walls in
the back hallway had some read liquid running down the walls that kinda
looked like blood. We moved very quickly and even the landlord said
that he understood even though we never told him about our experience.<br>

Ghost at Merrehope antebellum home Meridian, MS<br>
<br>
<br>
By: SRich539@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
about a year and half ago&nbsp; my son who was 13 at the time toured an
old antebellum plantation in Meridian, MS.&nbsp; This is an activity
that we enjoyed together, and had never encountered any unusual
incidents on any of our tours. We were the only people on the tour
along with the tour guide.&nbsp; In the upstairs nursery My son started
acting strange,&nbsp; I was facing in a different direction from
him.&nbsp; He got very close to me and very quiet,&nbsp; as we went
around to the top of the bannister&nbsp; I saw what looked like shadows
moving at the bottomof the staircase&nbsp; these shadows were human
form and very distinct.&nbsp; I didn't say anything. As we finished the
tour and left the home&nbsp; he told me that he had seen a young girl
in a green dress with plaid standing behind me in the nursery and she
was very clear&nbsp; and visible for about 10 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
believed him, he is not one to make up such a story.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
shared with him that I had seen shadows in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
we got home I looked up the mansion online&nbsp; and I was just so
surprised when I read that the ghost he described to me had been
reported being seen through the years&nbsp;&nbsp; and she wears a green
dress with plaid.&nbsp; wow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we had no prior
knowledge of this information&nbsp; so reading it&nbsp; was
creepy&nbsp; he truly saw a ghost. When you tell people a story like
that&nbsp; many will not believe you&nbsp; but&nbsp; it happened and we
can't explain why she appeared to him .&nbsp; Maybe it was because he
was a young teenager and she felt comfortable in his presence.&nbsp;
anyway&nbsp; it was an even we will not forget&nbsp;
ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

More of My stories<br>
<br>
By: j53ok@cox.net, <br>
<br>
I have posted here before and as I&#8217;ve said before, I have always been
spiritually sensitive.&nbsp; I posted the lonely little ghost girl post
and the trip I had from NY to MD in a snowstorm and stayed at the
Hampton Inn near Elkton, MD.&nbsp; But I have had many other spiritual
experiences in my childhood that by themselves don&#8217;t mean much but
collectively are kind of disturbing.&nbsp; <br>
For some reason, all of these started with toys &#8211; either of my own or
toys belonging to other kids.&nbsp; They would do weird things when I
was around and everyone &#8211; including me &#8211; would be totally freaked
out.&nbsp; I was playing ball with another guy down the street when I
was about 8 years old (this would have been around 1962) and his kid
sister had one of those big beauty parlor dolls that could have her
hair washed and styled as she sat in a swivel chair and put under a
hair dryer.&nbsp; Her legs were jointed at the knees so she looked real
when she sat in the chair.&nbsp; She was all dressed in prissy pink and
I thought she looked dumb.&nbsp; Even the hair dryer was pink.&nbsp; I
hate pink to this day.&nbsp; He went upstairs to talk to his dad a
minute.&nbsp; No sooner had I looked at this doll and formed the
thought, &#8220;Jeez, what a STUPID doll!&#8221; then there was a sharp =BANG= and
both the doll&#8217;s legs shot out of their sockets and flew across the room
like a pair of flesh-colored missles.&nbsp; Absolutely nothing else
happened other than the doll was now a double amputee.&nbsp; My
explanation of&nbsp; &#8220;the doll broke herself&#8221; didn&#8217;t work.&nbsp; I got
my butt kicked by 2 sets of parents.&nbsp; At another kid&#8217;s house we
were playing Army in his basement and HIS kid sister had a Little Miss
Echo.&nbsp; This one was a big doll that had a &#8220;magic bow&#8221; at her
throat that you turned one way and talked to her, then you turned the
&#8220;magic bow&#8221; the other way and she&#8217;d repeat what you just said.&nbsp; So
we were having a good ol&#8217; time on this rainy day hollering and making
sound effects and explosions while our armies were beating each other
up when Little Miss Echo went &#8216;bleeeeeeep&#8217; all by herself on the other
side of the basement.&nbsp; She was standing on the floor facing us and
I got creeped out.&nbsp; &#8220;What was that?&#8221; I asked him, staring at the
doll.&nbsp; &#8220;I dunno,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; We kept playing for about 5
minutes and again Little Miss Echo went &#8216;bleeeeeeep&#8217; but then started
playing back all the things we&#8217;d just been saying and doing while our
armies were beating each other up.&nbsp; Another kid had a huge Remco
&#8220;Mighty Matilda&#8221; aircraft carrier that would move along the floor,
pitching and rolling like it was on the ocean.&nbsp; It had really cool
weaponry, alarm bells, signal lights and scale modeling.&nbsp; It would
seize up and stop working for no reason when I was around.&nbsp; I had
a really cool diesel locomotive that blew its whistle and had &#8216;bump and
go&#8217; action that would work fine for my other 3 brothers, but it would
always turn and come after me!&nbsp; I had a McDonnell-Douglas DC-6
that would idle all 4 turbo-props like it was sitting on the runway; it
would start rolling in a straight line, pivot slowly in a half-circle
as the cabin light lit up and the stewardess came out of the galley and
went down the aisle between the passengers.&nbsp; The cabin light would
shut off, the engines would rev up faster and faster, it would shoot
forward a couple of feet like it was going to take off and start all
over again.&nbsp; But there were times, for no reason at all, it would
just go around in a circle and do nothing else.&nbsp; Then I&#8217;d shut it
off and leave it alone until I thought it would work right a day or so
later.&nbsp; <br>
There were other things like this going on with me around toys:&nbsp;
passive toys like puzzles and mechanical toys like an erector set or
clockwork toys that wound up didn&#8217;t &#8220;act up&#8221; with me.&nbsp; All the
problems seemed to revolve around toys that worked on batteries.&nbsp;
So I always took them apart (to the exasperation of my parents) to see
what made them work; I&#8217;d heard about &#8220;bugs&#8221; in machinery and wanted to
see if there were any bugs in my toys.&nbsp; I&#8217;d also heard about
&#8220;gremlins&#8221; making things go wrong but I had no idea what a gremlin was
until I saw the Twilight Zone episode with William Shatner and the
gremlin on the wing of the DC-6 he was a passenger on and I was
terrified that there were gremlins doing things to my toys when I
didn&#8217;t see them.<br>
To this day I still do weird things without trying.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t wear
digital watches; I &#8220;short them out&#8221; and they stop working within a
matter of weeks.&nbsp; My cell phone will do really weird things like
chime for no reason when I don&#8217;t have the alarm set or ring in an
incoming call with no one there.&nbsp; I will receive unexplainable
electrical shocks of some kind under all circumstances, even during
rainstorms and soggy wet weather when static electricity is supposed to
be at its weakest.&nbsp; My house barely missed getting hit by
lightning about 15 years ago and to this day weird electrical things
happen, starting with my daughter&#8217;s toys turning on or talking in the
middle of the night before a thunderstorm hits.&nbsp; Lights will turn
off and on that didn&#8217;t do that before the lightning strike.&nbsp; And
all my life I have noticed things move, fall off shelves or fly across
the room when I am extremely tense or agitated.&nbsp; I was helping a
guy do some workwork years ago; he was using his electric drill and set
it down.&nbsp; It started up all by itself and shut itself off again.<br>

My Experiences<br>
<br>

I have had many small experiences that seemed odd, but never could
explain.<br>
When I was 4 or 5, I remember being awakened in the early morning by
something I could not see.&nbsp; It felt like someone was sitting on
the edge of my cot, but nobody was there. Then it touched my leg! It
was like an icy poke just under my right knee. I could even see a
slight imprint as if someone were sitting there. I jumped out of bed
and ran to tell my parents, who of course didn't believe me.<br>
Maybe 2 years later, I remember awakening again around 3 am to
something sort of foggy floating above me. It sort of looked like a
woman (almost like the woman on ghostbusters, but way more whispy), but
I still am not sure. It didn't stay long, but I was in shock and
couldn't move. I could barely breath. This time I didn't bother my
parents with it.<br>
My cousin's lived next door to me, but a field and a wood seperated our
houses.&nbsp; We would camp out and make trails in these woods.&nbsp;
Then my uncle built a barn behind his house and we started camping out
there. We would hear noises, but never thought that much about it.
Halloween rolled around and they thought that any trick or treaters
would be scared of their dogs, so they shut them up in the barn for the
evening. A few hours later we heard a god aweful noise coming from the
barn and went to investigate. Something in there scared the bejesus out
of those dogs. They chewed almost totally through the door to get out.
As soon as they were free, they ran and hid under the house and we
could not get them to come out. I still wonder what that was.&nbsp; All
of these so far happened on the north side of Aiken, SC. I mentioned
that my cousins, brother, and I used to make trails in the woods
between our homes. We sometimes came across strange things out there.
Like hard soles to shoes, occational scraps of mostly rotten cloth...
that sort of thing. And once a skull. We thought it was a skull, but
our parents told us it was a dog or something. We were pretty sure we
knew what a dog skull looked like, but being ages 7-9, we were told we
didnt' know what we were talking about. It was along the fence on I-20,
which ran behind our house, so I suppose it is possible.<br>
I will send more shortly. These were just the earliest I remember.<br>
Here are some more experiences...<br>
My aunt Misty from the other side of the family had started renting a
cute little brick house on the south side of Aiken, SC at the begining
of the summer one year. I was 15 at the time. She asked me to come stay
with her during the week to babysit and play nanny to her daughter
while they worked. The first week or two went fine. Then we noticed
strange things happening. The kitchen light would just turn on or off
by itself, the glass door from the kitchen to the living room would
open or close on it's own. We heard noises in the attic. We kinda
thought it was neat. (My aunt and I love anything ghostly or scarry.)
One night, I decided to stay up all night and watch tv, which I had
never been allowed to do at home. I didn't make it through the night.
Around 2am, I was awakened by whom I thought was my little 8 year old
cousin Megan. She said "Crystal, it's late. You want to go to bed now?"
I decided she was right, the couch was not so comfy anymore, so I
turned off the tv and went to bed. As I lay down, I thought about the
nightgown she had been wearing. It was a floor length white nightgown
that was very close necked with lace around the collar, kinda old
fashioned looking. And her hair was shorter. She didn't own anything
like that. I had been doing her laundry for over a month by then, so I
knew something was up. I went to her room and peeked in on her. She was
dead asleep in a long purple t shirt. I can not begin to explain the
chills I got at that moment. I slept on her floor that night.<br>
The next week that I sat for her, I brought my karaoke machine. It had
a microphone, and I had just read about EVP's and wanted to try it out.
I let Megan play on it a while that afternoon and convinced her to take
a walk. Before I left, I popped in a blank tape and hit record. We were
outside about an hour. The house was empty and locked up. I listened to
the whole thing when we got back. There were little thumps here and
there, and at the very end there was what sounded like a little girl
Megan's age singing softly, then the tape ran out. I couldn't make out
the words for the life of me, it sounded more like humming that actual
words. Megan had been with me the whole time, so this kinda freaked me
out a little. I can't find it now. I've moved so many times, there's no
telling where it is. Wish I could go back to that house.<br>
My aunt Misty didn't stay at that little brick house long. She moved
again just outside of east Aiken, SC. It was a large lot with 2 really
nice mobile homes on it. One was a 2 bedroom, the other 4 bedrooms.
Things would move at this house. And break. Misty liked thoes little
pictures with the little cherub angels, you know, the creepy looking
fat cheeked little guys holding their head up in with hand and looking
up. She hung a few up in the bathroom and one big one at the end of the
hallway. We could not keep them on the walls. Everyone in the house
would be in the dinning room eating and you would hear one fall and
shatter. But only the cherub pictures. The others were fine. It was
weird. Turns out, the previous owners were a couple and the husband's
mother. They let the mother live in the smaller trailer, and they took
care of her. Then she died. They had her cremated, per her wishes, and
kept her urn on the mantle. One night when they were out, someone broke
into their house and before they left, spread the mother's ashes all
throughout the house. Needless to say, the couple felt they had to
leave. Would have been nice to know prior to closing paperwork to buy
the place, eh?<br>
Things had been pretty quiet for the next few years. Odd things would
happen here or there, but nothing notable. On my 17th birthday, I ran
away. (stepdad issues) My boyfriend at the time and his family invited
me to stay with them. They lived in north west Aiken, SC. I could never
explain it, but being alone in that house was not pleasant for me.
Something about the living room always made me so sad. I'm talking
about choking back tears sad. There would be noises here and there, but
that was normal for a new manufactured home, I suppose. One night, we
got bored and they wanted to play with my oouji board. I had never used
it before, but treasured it because it had belonged to my uncle Timmy
before he died, and it was from the 70's. Nothing happened. Then out of
the blue weeks later, I was sitting on my guy's bed, alone, watching
Drew Carey, and something knocked me on top of my head! It felt like
someone balled up their fist and pounded down on my head one hard time,
but there was nobody there! Then, a few days later, my guy's little
sister and I were on the bed watching tv again. The cd player turned on
by it's self, turned to cd #3, and proceeded to play track #12. The cd
was Mer de Noms and the song was the last one, called "Over". We
watched it happen and the cd player remote was on top of the cd player.
Strange. Nothing else happened until the night my guy, his brother, and
our friend decided to move out and get an apartment together. I don't
know what happened. Everyone else in the house were awoken to the sound
of the kitchen going crazy. Cabinets slamming, banging on the counters,
and the previously locked front door wide open at like 3am. Nobody
would fess up and everyone looked scared, so it must have really
happened. They said they couldn't believe we didn't wake up.<br>
Oh yes, we moved out...<br>
My guy, his brother, and our friend Wade moved into an apartment
complex in town in Aiken, SC. Nothing at all happened in this place.
But, we had a common friend we went to school with that had the
creepiest house ever. It was in the historic horse district in Aiken.
The houses there are pretty old. We would hang out there pretty much
all weekend, partying and what not. We would be sitting in the living
room chatting it up, when there would be a huge bang on the wall right
beside you like someone tried to throw a rock through it. But there
would be nothing there. Once, we actually saw a box fan do a complete
flip out of an armchair and land on the floor. Wild. Lots of people
experienced these sort of things at this house. The eeriest of all
though, one afternoon we were sitting on the front stoop in front of
the front door talking. A white hearse slows down in front of the house
and stops. The driver looked over at us a minute, and then just left.
One of the windows was busted out and there was a clear plastic bag
taped in it. Never forget it. I mean, you just can't make this kinda
stuff up. It's like he knew something.<br>
Anyhow, two years later, I am single. I moved in with the friend at the
creepy horse district house. It always felt like you were being
watched. I never noticed that when we were just visiting, but actually
living there... it almost felt menacing sometimes. I had started dating
again a good while after I had moved in. I had been telling him about
this house and he always laughed like I was pulling his leg. He never
believed me. Well, he spent the night one night. It's about 3am and he
wakes me up freaking out. I thought the house was on fire he was so
worked up. Apparently, he felt something touch him, so he rolled over
to see what it was and was face to face with a whispy floating figure.
He was waving his arms at it like it was smoke he was trying to blow
away. I don't think he ever believed the stories we told him about the
place. I don't think he even believed in ghosts period, but he does now!<br>
Since then, "ghost waver" and I have bought a house built in the 1950's
for the SRS plant workers. I was sort of hopeful it would be active,
but no luck yet. The realator thought I was joking when I asked if it
was haunted or if someone had died there. If he only knew...:)<br>
