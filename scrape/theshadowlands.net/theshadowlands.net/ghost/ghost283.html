<P><B>Threatning Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:pantojal@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>It all started on Thanksgiving week. Me and my family drove to Las
Vegas because we were spending Thanksgiving with some relatives. They live
in a two bedroom apartment but there's just something about it that seems
a little wierd. Everytime I enter the apartment it's warm and welcome but
when I enter my cousin's room it's very cold and</B>
<BR><B>it just gives me the creeps. Everytime we spent the night there
I would always sleep in</B>
<BR><B>the living room because I just didn't feel comfortable sleeping
in that room. (The other room my parents slept.) But this time my aunt
was trying to be nice so she made me</B>
<BR><B>and my two sisters sleep in there just to be polite. She told us
not to worry because she</B>
<BR><B>said she was tired of us sleeping in the living room everytime we
visited. So anyway I layed on the bed very uncomfortable. It was a very
hot night so I threw the covers off and</B>
<BR><B>tried to go to sleep. It must have been an hour later when I heard
something dragging on</B>
<BR><B>the floor. Like if someone was dragging their feet. It was really
soft but got louder and it</B>
<BR><B>got closer to the bed. I kept my eyes wide open looking in every
direction yet I couldn't</B>
<BR><B>see where the noise was coming from. I looked at my sisters but
they were sound asleep. The dragging had stopped so I tried to go back
asleep. I then heard it again</B>
<BR><B>seconds later. I saw a shadow of a person coming into the room walking
very slowly.</B>
<BR><B>I shut my eyes, too afraid to open them. Too afraid of what I was
going to see. I opened</B>
<BR><B>my eyes slightly but there was no shadow, like if I imagined it
all. The dragging of the</B>
<BR><B>feet continued. I was too afraid to get up to see what it was. So
I closed my eyes and</B>
<BR><B>just layed there hoping it was all a dream. Then I felt this rushing
air pass me. It was</B>
<BR><B>very cold and it scared the crap out of me! Then the cold air landed
on my like a body.</B>
<BR><B>The air I felt was moving slowly. It felt really cold and I was
getting goosebumps all over</B>
<BR><B>my body. The air somehow was forming into two arms. The arms were
now grabbing my</B>
<BR><B>arms and holding me down. I was so scared that I was shaking and
I was too scared to</B>
<BR><B>open my eyes. but with my eyes closed it seemed like if I could
see who it was. It was a</B>
<BR><B>tall man looking at me. He was standing there with evil eyes just
staring at me. The arms that were holding me down were his and he started
shaking me. I couldn't yell. Then my</B>
<BR><B>body became paralyzed. I couldn't do anything. I was too afraid
to do anything. I tried yelling for my sister who was next to me but my
mouth couldn't say the words. I then started saying a prayer. I tried to
move my mouth to my prayer. I tried yelling. But nothing</B>
<BR><B>worked. I just kept saying my prayer as best as I could but it only
came out a murmer. But when I said, "Please God, help me!" The arms came
off my body. The man ran and</B>
<BR><B>I opened my eyes. My body was very tingly because it was paralyzed.
I was crying,</B>
<BR><B>shaking and very scared about what had just happened. My mom came
in and hugged</B>
<BR><B>me telling me what had happened. So I told her. Then my stepdad
came in and said, "The</B>
<BR><B>same thing happened to me last night, but I didn't want to worry
anyone." We spoke to</B>
<BR><B>my aunt and she too had felt the same thing I had experienced. I
didn't sleep at all at night but when It was time to leave I was so relieved.
I packed my things got in the truck and thought to myself, "What a wierd
experience."</B>

<BR><B>Cowboy and Others</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jumjper@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm 12 years old and not many people believe me but it is true. I'm
not going to use real names because of personal reasons but i was wondering
if you could post this. Anyway, my best friends cousin, Tracy,&nbsp; got
married to a dude named greg. Well a few weeks after the wedding greg died
in a really bad car accident well, how he died was he called tracy, tracy
answered "hello?". greg said, "Hey&nbsp; trace?" and they cut off so it
was that exact moment he died. any ways, one night, tracy was at her house
a while after he died and she saw a shadow in the kitchen and so she got
scared and turned on the light on her fish tank and there was no one&nbsp;
there. all of the sudden the channels started to change on the tv. so she
went to her cousin Annie's house ad annie said she could spend the night
ad gave her advice. the advice was that is was probably greg ad that she
should try to talk to him. well the next night it happened again. so she
said "greg if&nbsp; you wanna watch tv you can" and the channel stopped
on disney, Chad's favorite the next one is that one night while i was sleeping
i woke up and saw a cowboy standing at my bedroom door. i closed my eyes
and started crying and wen i opened my eyes, he was gone. can anyone explain
that&nbsp; if so e mail jumjper@aol.com</B>

<BR><B>Cemetery Gates</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LSimpson87@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I don't know if this counts as a ghost story or not, but my friends
and I went to White Cemetery on Cuba Road at like 10 pm yesterday, but
when we drove by the gate was closed.&nbsp; so we pulled into a driveway
and turned around to go home and a black car was in there and the gate
was open, so we turned around AGAIN and drove back.&nbsp; the car was gone
but the gates were left open.&nbsp; me and one other friends stayed as
lookouts at the gates and our three other friends went in and took pictures...
i tried to close the gate on them but it wouldn't move, even when i pulled
as hard as i could.&nbsp; i just don't get who would visit the cemetery
so late at night who could open the gate that quickly (or at all) and then
just leave right away with the gate open.</B>

<BR><B>Demon Night</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sweetnubianqueen2003@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The story I'm about to tell is true, This happened to me when I was
about 11&nbsp; years old in the house I grew up in. This is a three story&nbsp;
row house converted into three apartments.</B>
<BR><B>This house is located in West Philadelphia. My family rented the
first floor.&nbsp; One night while laying in bed trying to fall to sleep
every else was already asleep, it was around 12:30am. I had to use the
bath room which is located&nbsp; in the hallway next to my bedroom door.
I always kept my bedroom door sht and locked at night. anyway as I was
about to get up I heard this shuffling sound coming from the third floor
apartment at the time the 2nd and 3rd floor apartments was both empty&nbsp;
our family was the only one occupying the house.</B>
<BR><B>As I listend the sound became more frightening I remember being
very afraid, as the sound continued down the 3rd foor steps making its
way to the 2nd floor landing with a thump sound as it hit. as it made it's
way along the 2nd floor it sounded&nbsp; like this...thump draaag , thump
draaaag, thump draaaag. At this point I was terrified because we did not
own any pets plus this did'nt sound like any animal for the sound was to
heavy.</B>
<BR><B>My body broke out in a cold sweat I was frozen with terror as I
listened to it make it's way down first floor steps , Thump draaaaag, thump
draaaag, thump draaaaag then a heavy thump as it made it's way down the
hall towards my bedroom door and stopped. silence for a long time but it
was only a few minutes, The hallway light is very bright at night we always
keep it on . As I looked down at the bottem of my door which was a open
gap betwin it and the floor I can see&nbsp; and hear the shadow of clawed
feet walking back and forth. As if that was not bad enough then it proceded
to scratch , claw and moan at the door very loudly. At this point I was
hoping one of my parents would get hear i or something , But it seemed
like I was the only one hearing it.&nbsp; I layed therer listening to thre
most horrible sounds I ever heard in my life, No animal&nbsp; could sounds
so frightening . I new that whatever was on the other side of that door
was evel and not of this world.</B>
<BR><B>After what seemed like an eternity my mom came out of her room to
use the bathroom, as soon as her bedroom door opened all sounds stopped.
I was still to terrified to call out to her because I was not sure if that
was her or something faking to like her so I can open my door to it. Eventualy
I fell asleep in the morning I put the incident behind me and went about
my day . I didnt think about the incident until later that day as I was
walking to my bedroom door which was shut I then noticed the scratch marks
all over my door.</B>
<BR><B>I never told any one about this until I came across your site. by
the way I am now 50 years old I have been holding this and many other stories
which are true experiences. My first story has not been posted yet . So
I hope you liked this one enough to post it.</B>

<P><B>Ghosts of Monterey</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bentmusic2@pcwan.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello</B>
<BR><B>I had this experience in 1979-but it is still burned into my memory!</B>
<BR><B>My husband and I had rented a house from Tom S., it was on the corner
of David and Foam street, before Cannery Row became so commercialized.
In fact it only was $200 a month!&nbsp;&nbsp; Eager and cash-poor, we agreed
to clean out the house from it's former occupant for such a low rate with
a view of Monterey Bay.&nbsp; Tom had told us that the former tenant had
been found dead on the rocks of Big Sur not 2 weeks ago, he had been waiting
to see why she had not paid her rent for 6 weeks.</B>
<BR><B>No-one ever found out what happened to her, plus she had a 13-16
yr, old son that just left when that went down-was he a victim too? Records
show she liked to party at nearby&nbsp; bars.</B>
<BR><B>My ghost story is that we lived there happilyfor 3 years,&nbsp;
no bad vibes.</B>
<BR><B>In 19? we were forced to move because our wholeblock was being plowed
under for the "Monterey Bay Aquarium"- We had signed a lease up on Monroe
, no hard feelings about having to move. By that time, tourists in buses
were picking Datura lilies out of our front yard!</B>
<BR><B>Two days before we had to actually leave our house, I was suddenly
awakened by the slidiing of our closet, it was very loud!&nbsp; One of
those ceap closet doors on rails.&nbsp; I sat up. and there was MARCIA,
she gave me a "go to hell " look , I got up and said"Thatss MY stuff NOW"&nbsp;
As I got up , she ran off, not thu the door, but&nbsp; out the wall!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I ran out after her, but nothing!&nbsp; I recognized her because pictures
I Had to go thru to clean up the house.</B>
<BR><B>This all happened 20 yrs&nbsp; ago</B>

<BR><B>Go Away!!!!!!!!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about sixteen years old I had a terrifying encounter.
I have no idea if what I experienced was a ghost or not. Please let me
know what you think.</B>
<BR><B>It all started when I was upstairs in my bedroom doing my homework.
A very strange feeling came over me. I felt as if something was in the
room with me, and it was not a friendly feeling. I became very uncomfortable
and went downstairs to finish my homework. By the time I got ready to go
to bed I had brushed the experience off. I had decided that it was just
my imagination or I had felt that way because I had been sitting with my
back to an open window. But I still felt uneasy..</B>
<BR><B>Two and a half hours after laying down I still had not dozed off
even for a second. I couldn't shake the uneasiness. I had the strangest
feeling. I&nbsp; was laying on my stomach when I felt a sharp pain in my
big toe. It felt like someone had pricked me with a needle. Then the covers
started moving and I had this tingling sensation all over my body. Something
was in the bed with me!!! It felt like it was sitting on my back and pushing
me down into my mattress!!! I tried to push myself up out of the bed so
I could get out of there but the thing had me pinned down!!! As this was
happening, the lamp on my night stand ( I used it as a night light ) was
blinking on and off kind of like it was shorting out and I had a terrible
sharp pain in my chest. Finally I said " Go away! " very firmly and it
was over just as suddenly as it had started. I whirled around in the bed
half way expecting to see some kind of intruder but nothing or no one was
there. I slept downstairs on the couch for weeks.</B>
<BR><B>A few months later I had another similair experience, but this time
I was laying on my side. I felt arms wrap around me from behind and something
nuzzled the back of my neck. But this was not a friendly hug. I got the
distinct impression that this thing was evil. Again, I said " Go away "
and it was over instantly just like before.</B>
<BR><B>I still feel uneasy in that room and there has always beem unexplained
noises, but at the time I played around with witchcraft ( as most teenagers
do at some point ) and a friend and I had recently "performed " some kind
of ritual or spell ( I don't remember what kind now ) in that room. Could
I have invited some unwanted guest into the room that way or do you think
the place is just haunted? You are more than welcome to post this on your
site but please don't use my name or email address. I would greatly appreciate
any feedback. Just telling this story scares me all over again! Thanks!!!!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Aunt</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LlrblLdyskn@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi. My name is Courtney, and I'm only 15 but I've had enough happen
to me in my 15 years to last me a lifetime. And I'm writing because I want
to share my story or stories.</B>
<BR><B>It all started when I was in about the 4th grade. My aunt had just
passed away and it hit me really hard, because she was like my own mom.
My mother, her fiance', and I all lived in a two bedroom apartment in Rincon,
GA. One morning, about a month or so after my aunt passed away, I had gotten
up really early for school. I don't know why I did this, but anyways...
I was getting dressed and all of a sudden I heard a knock on my bedroom
door. I opened the door but no one was there, so I closed it back and went
on about my business of getting ready for school. Then I heard the knock
again, this time when I opened my door my cat was sitting in front of me.
Now i know for a fact that there is no way that my cat could have knocked
on my bedroom door.&nbsp; Not too long after that happened my mom and her
fiance' broke up and we moved in with my grandparents. Well I had to start
out sleeping on the couch. I remember one night I woke up in the middle
of the night and I barely opened my eyes and I saw a light, it was like
it was hovering, I closed my eyes for a split second and opened them again
and it was gone. I got this sudden feeling that I was not alone, but yet
I wasn't scared it was like I was comforted.&nbsp; That was about a year
or two ago. Now my mother and I live in a house all to ourselves. Last
year in December a really close friend of the family passed away. and some
of his belongings are in our house. Well about a month or two ago I was
laying on the couch watching a scarey movie, that isn't so scarey b/c i've
seen it so many times, but I was almost asleep when all of a sudden the
sound on the T.V. turned off, it like stopped completely. It scared me
soo bad. And not even a couple of days ago I was sitting on the couch and
my mom was on the other side of the room, when the chandeleir in the kitchen
started flickering for no reason. It was really creepy. But I've learned
to not be afraid, that they can't hurt me. Well I've got to go, i hope
that you enjoyed my story. It probably won't be the last.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My First Story..</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sirlok1@netzero.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have had many experiences.&nbsp; I have seen ghost.&nbsp; I have
seen shadows.&nbsp; I have even been attacked by what I believe was some
kind of shadow thing as told in the story I recently submitted.</B>
<BR><B>Here I will share MY FIRST STORY. From what I remember that is.
And I say this because my Mother and older brother have both told me that
since I was a small child I would scare them because I would always refer
to someone who they could not see. They only remember feeling something
Evil was around...Well here's my story.</B>
<BR><B>Summer 1989</B>
<BR><B>I once lived in a home in where I got a visit by a ghost.&nbsp;
We had been living there for a while when I had decided to MOVE MY ROOM
AROUND.</B>
<BR><B>This is when it started.&nbsp; At first a Rosery I placed at the
head of my bed kept getting tampered with.&nbsp; I kept finding the Cross
torn from the chain.&nbsp; Not in a way in where it looked as though it
were pulled off while I slept.&nbsp; It was different.&nbsp; Like somebody
actually tore it from the chain.&nbsp; And everyday I would put it back
together only to find it torn off.</B>
<BR><B>A week later is when the man began to visit.&nbsp; An old man.</B>
<BR><B>I was asleep and he woke me up.&nbsp; I looked at him and what I
saw was my stepfather.&nbsp; He said “wake up, you’ll be late for work.”&nbsp;
He then walked away and closed the door behind him.&nbsp; I looked at the
time and saw that it was 5:00 a.m. so I jumped out of bed and got ready
for work.&nbsp; I then went to my stepfather and told him I was ready for
him to give me a ride to work.&nbsp; He woke up asking what I was talking
about, it was a little past 1:00 a.m.&nbsp; I ran to my room and looked
at the clock to find it was a around 1:15 a.m. and so I asked him why did
he wake me…He said he never did.&nbsp; I went back to bed.</B>
<BR><B>Next night (Tuesday) The old man woke me up again and said “wake
up, you’ll be late for work.”</B>
<BR><B>I first saw my stepfather but this time I forced myself to focus…what
I saw was an old man.&nbsp; I sat up on my bed in fear as he closed the
door behind him.&nbsp; I looked over to my clock and saw it was 5:00a.m.&nbsp;
I jumped up fast to get to the lights and when I did I turned to the clock
again to find it was 1:00 in the morning.</B>
<BR><B>(Wednesday Night)</B>
<BR><B>The old man woke me up.&nbsp; The moment I opened my eyes I saw
him.&nbsp; He looked like he was about 80 years old.&nbsp; He said the
same thing as other nights and walked out of the room…I just laid there
petrified. I looked over to my clock and saw that it was 1:00 a.m.&nbsp;
I think I stayed awake the whole night.</B>
<BR><B>On Thursday I did not bother going to bed until after 1:00.</B>
<BR><B>On Friday our neighbor came over to visit my Mom.&nbsp; I asked
her how long she had been living in her home and she said for some twenty
years.&nbsp; I then asked if there was ever an old man that lived in my
home.&nbsp; She said yes.&nbsp; Whatever happened to him I asked.&nbsp;
She said “about ten years ago some paramedics came over and took him. We
never did find out what happened to him.&nbsp; We just never saw him again.”</B>
<BR><B>I then walked to my room and moved the bed to the other side.&nbsp;
I never saw the old man again.</B>
<BR><B>I have only told this story to few a close friends.&nbsp; I believe
the place in where I had moved my bed was the actual place in where the
man had died...I assume.</B>
<BR><B>Now that night is when I began to have what some have called Night
Terrors or Anxiety Attacks or whatever... I call then InSane Dreams in
where you know you're awake and you see all around you but you can't speak
or move because some unknown evil presence is moveing about your room either
growling or laughing.&nbsp; And you may even experience somewhat of a vision
in where you see people or places you have never seen before only to visit
them later...I apologize but no one has ever been able to explain this
and I only mention it here because It All Started after this Old Man crossed
my life. If anybody at The ShadowLands has an answer it would be much appreciated...</B>
<BR><B>I have seen and sensed ghost or shadow people ever since...</B>
<BR><B>Feel free to edit anything out if you decide to post this...</B>

<P><B>There is a sleepy little town on the tip of the oklahoma and texas
border south centrel part named terral. This town is very small we are
talking less than 200 people. My grandmother lives there we use to visit
when i was a kid. I heard a very good story camping out there on the red
river. There is an old train bridge that crosses the red river. The construction
of the bridge happened years ago. There was a worker who fell onto the
rebarb of the support for the bridge right before they started to poured
the concrete. The tried to get his mangaled body out but could no they
decided to just pour the concrete on top of him and keep building. They
did so. They say that when the river is low and the sandbanks are visable
u can see a man running of the sand. Dont know if its true but it's scary
late at night around a campfire.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Quite a Few Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ahe80210@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I happened onto your website by partial accident, but happen to have
some interesting stories for you.</B>
<BR><B>#1. This happened to my brother in the 1st house my family was in.
Before he had gone off to college, in 1976, he was in the throne room,
and the towel on the rack started to move end over end, and, there was
no heating vent in that room.</B>
<BR><B>#2. Same house, middle of the night, my sister had seen a parade
of something coming out of my room, past hers, and into my parents room.
I think she said it was sometime around 2-3 in the morning.</B>
<BR><B>#3. Different house. My sister had moved out of the 2nd house, and
was out of the city so I know she wasn't playing a trick on me. But, I
was taking a shower, and on the mirror in front of me was a drawing, rather
strange.</B>
<BR><B>#4. 3rd house. It was late summer, I was cleaning up some dishes,
and my parents were coming back from there vacation the next day, it was
also past 8 p.m. so it was dark outside. There is a bay window overlooking
the rear neighbors house, which happens to be at the base of a hill, and
one can not see the back door of the house. But, all of a sudden, I noticed
a shadow on the window. The shadow was behind me on the wall. 1st time
I saw it, didn't pay it any mind, 2nd time, it concerned me, 3rd time,
I was walking through the house with a 10" french knife in hand.</B>
<BR><B>#5. Same house. It was before my parents had changed the front hall
from tile to carpet. I was walking over to the t.v. and I was standing
in front of an old stereo, when I heard my name spoken as clear as day.
I stopped, said what, because I thought that my mother had called my name
from the kitchen, she was confused, and at that point a cherry wood candlestick
came jumping of of the bookcase at my feet.</B>
<BR><B>#6. Happened to my wife. We were in the small old mining town of
Alma, Co. and we were about to have lunch in the hotel dining room, I had
just come out of the restroom when an actual apparition appeared to her.
It was a boy in Victorian age clothing, i.e. velvet knickers, velvet over
shirt, and collar lace. She only saw it briefly, and it was coming down
the staircase.</B>
<BR><B>#7. Also happened to wife. It was in historic east Denver. We were
caretakers of an elderly couple, and on Thanksgiving Eve, my wife was making
a pumpkin pie to take over to my families Thanks. day dinner, and the can
that she was using, while she was turned around, turned around itself.
Then a few moments later, flew off of the counter, across the room.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Quite Ordinary</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Scrogginscottage@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is now the third story that I will post to this excellent site.
Ever since around the age of&nbsp; 10 I have always been able to sense
ghosts and spirits, believe me this is not by choice and I actually do
not enjoy the encouters. The story today takes us to around summer of 1988
when I used to live in a bedsit with adjoining kitchen. Over the months
before I had had some experiences but the most dramatic happened one Sunday
night around 11.00pm shortly after I had gone to bed. Not being asleep
for maybe longer than 10 minutes I was awoken by a strange tingling sensation
all over my body, I at once knew that i again was not alone. The sense
of being in the presense of something else became quite over powering and
started to fear and actually hid under the covers, then the horrible happenings
started. Firstly the covers seemed (I say seemed because to this day I
try to refuse to believe what had happened) be pulled from me from the
base of the bed, I actually had to struggle really really hard to keep
them on me. It was as though a mysterious force was trying to get them
off me. this went on for what seemed like hours ut in reality was about
3 minutes, then the worse happened&nbsp; a horrible whisper was being whispered
in my ear it was like no language I ever ever heard and to accompany this
there was a horrible smell, it was rancid. I was either going mad or this
was very real. (I to this day have actually never ever seen a spirit or
ghost). The experienced lasted what seemed like ages, then a paralysis
set in and I was completely at the spirits mercy, then as quickly as it
started , it stopped,, I literally dived out of bed and switched on my
light, but (this is as true as i'm sat here) the light never gave any light
to the room, I dived back to bed and just lay there terrified. then for
no reason the light became normal. I then thought yes it's over, I got
out of bed went to the kitchen which was the only other room to my flat,
(this was a very small room maybe 8ft by 4ft), but to my utter horror and
surprise on opening the door the kitchen wasn't mine, to this day I remember
it being a different layout like older , I didn't pay that much attention
as the fear again set in. I got in bed and lay there till morning. that
next day I actually moved out and went to live back at my parents as I
could not stand another night there. the flat to this day is still there
and i have been around the back alley where my rooms were just to look
and take photos, they seemed quite ordinary considering.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Red Man</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: o0vee0o@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My previous house was newly built making us the only residents ever
living there. There were two floors to our house, our rooms in the basement
and the main level was the kitchen, living room. Before I would sleep at
night I always make sure that I lock my door. Im always afraid that someone
could just easily walk in. Since I sleep by myself I have a teddy bear
that I sleep with as a comforter. I woke up one night noticing that my
bear was missing, so I lend over to the side of my bed to pick up the bear.
As I was grabbing him I noticed a red man standing at my door smiling at
me. His fingers were long and his teeth looked almost sharp. I stared at
him for a few seconds thinking that it was my eyes playing tricks on me.
He was still standing there, smiling. I grabbed my bear and pulled the
blanket over my head. I couldnt sleep at all that night, I was afraid it
would have came over to me and pull the blanket away. The next morning
I had told my dad what Ive seen. He informed me that it was him. I just
thought to myself "There is no way that it could have been him, Im the
only one with the a set of keys for my door, and I always have my door
locked"</B>

<BR><B>Prayers at Night</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: superrama_show@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My religion is Islam. and it's not an extra-ordinary things for
a Muslim to sometimes wakes in the middle of the night to pray to God.
we call this habit 'Tahajud' or night-prayer. we believe that our God likes
it for His follower to pray to Him when no one sees them but Him. and,
my family is trying to be a good God-follower. and this makes it not unussual
to me to find one of my family still awaken in the middle of the night.
so, i didn't realize my first ghost experience because of this custom.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;one night, i fell asleep in my older sister's room. she was
still watching TV and woke me up on around 11 pm. the house was already
dark. the only light from my living room is a single old(my house is full
of primitive handicraft) desk lamp that my father placed on top of an old
drawer. suddenly, i felt someone walking behind me. still sleepy and because
of the dark surroundings, i took a glimpse and saw a woman that i thought
was my sister. i thought, "yeah, your ro is hot. join me and my fan". we
don't have air-conditioner in our house. every room is attached with a
ceiling fan. that night, the ceiling fan in my room and her room were broken.
my father just bought a standing-fan an i monopolized it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;then, i reached my room and pull the second bed in my room.
i've told you that the people in my house sometime are still active even
in the night. so, i haven't realized the condition yet. that the woman
behind me was a ghost. i turned my fan on and layed in the main bed. than,
that woman came in and sleep in the second bed under beside my bed. in
one o'clock that night, i woke to pray. with full conciousness, i saw my
sister(although her face was covered with her hair) still lying in the
bed.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;at about 3 am, i woke up to prepare myself for the early-morning
prayer(take a drink, go to the toilet to clear my stomach so i can pray
with full concentration). at that time the bed where a woman that i thought
was my sister was already left out. i thought she was already left after
did her night prayer.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;in the morning, jokingfully i said to her, "where's the money
to pay your rent for my fan last night.". she looked at me with a confused
stare. "What do you mean?", she asked. i laugh and said, "i was still awaken
when you went to my room". she looked more confused and refused that she
were at my room last night. then the hair in the back of my neck rose and
i realized that it was not her who followed me last night. after that i
tried to confince her that i saw her last night in my room. she sweared
that she didn't go to my room(she's not a liar t e of a person), in fact
she said that after i left her room, she was still awake untill midnight,
reading a book. so, we changed a scared look and try to forget it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;ps: that room was her's before. and she told me that a couple
of years ago she too saw a young girl there with the face covered with
her hair. well, we muslims belived in gennie(jinn/ djinn), an concluded
that the woman was one of them(and we concluded that what american call
a ghost is a djinn which makes an appearences)... at last sorry for my
English</B>

<P><B>Not Welcome</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gloriamcleod@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mom told me a story,a true story that really gave me the creeps.She</B>
<BR><B>told me that when my brother was a little boy ,around the age of
5,he</B>
<BR><B>used toplay with a boy in the shed.You see we used to live with
our</B>
<BR><B>grandparents and i wasn't born yet and my brother really didn't
have</B>
<BR><B>anybody to play with.My grandparents built thier home so i don't
think</B>
<BR><B>its haunted,but the things that went on the house you never know.Anyway</B>
<BR><B>my brother would always go outside to play but whenever my mom went
out</B>
<BR><B>there to check up on him he was in the shed.Then the time finally
came</B>
<BR><B>when she really paid attention to whom it was that Marty was playing</B>
<BR><B>with,but when she looked nobody was there.But,Marty kept on playing
and</B>
<BR><B>rolling his ball, and frightenly,the ball kept coming back to him,but</B>
<BR><B>still nobody there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another story i tell,i tell this one because
i know what</B>
<BR><B>happened,well because i was there.You see a couple months before
i</B>
<BR><B>moved,i lived in a[n] apartment.I grew up there but i just moved
to a</B>
<BR><B>different apartment,not complex.So my cousin Rachel was staying
the</B>
<BR><B>night as usual and we're both the same age and both get scared</B>
<BR><B>easily.Well we were sleeping under the table and my 4 year old sister</B>
<BR><B>was asleep on the couch a few feet away.We were trying to go to
sleep</B>
<BR><B>with a carousel on with its music playing just like a music box
and i</B>
<BR><B>was trying to scare her by telling her to put it back or a ghost
would</B>
<BR><B>get her.So she got out from under the table and was placing it on
my</B>
<BR><B>entertainment center and began back towards the table.When she was</B>
<BR><B>coming back to the table she was crossing our bar-counter and there
sat</B>
<BR><B>a small calendar,a calendar that is supposed to tell dreams and
what</B>
<BR><B>they mean.So I looked at her as she came back And I yelled to her,"WATCH</B>
<BR><B>OUT!" But she didn't listen to me and said"No i'm not falling for
that</B>
<BR><B>again."So screamed out to her again "WATCH OUT"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and she turned to</B>
<BR><B>her right and the small calendar came flying at her she squirmed
and</B>
<BR><B>ducked as the calendar nearly missed her head!Then I looked up and
I</B>
<BR><B>just saw something draped in black clothing or something which i
think</B>
<BR><B>is a representation of evil.But Rachel saw something different,she
saw</B>
<BR><B>something white and i think that white is angels.We stayed under
the</B>
<BR><B>table frightened like hell and just layed with our eyes tied shut
and</B>
<BR><B>yelled for my mom.When my mom came out i started looking around
as she</B>
<BR><B>picked up my sister and told the what ever was there,"Go away you
are</B>
<BR><B>not wlcome in this home."</B><B></B>

<P><B>Demon Poster</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PAULACHOPPER2@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I would like to introduce myself. My name is Drifter. I have had
many ghost experiences in my life, sometimes I can tell if a house has
a spirit or not. But to the one story that I am going to tell is true and
not made up. Its about a poster named The Demon. I bought it at a mall.
It was a picture of the devil. I brought it home and hung it on my bedroom
wall. The way it was made it looked like the eyes followed you. After I
hung the poster up the wall would vibrate late at night. So after three
days I moved it to my bedroom door. My grandfather told me I had to move
the poster so he couldn't see it or get rid of it. I asked him why and
he told me that the bedroom door would swing shut so it could see him.
I told him there was in no way the door would swing shut just because of
my poster. But two days later I was in the bathroom with the door open
and the bedroom door shut slowly so the poster could see me. So I came
out of the bathroom and opened my door again. It did not move until I went
back into the bathroom. The door went half way shut so the poster could
see me&nbsp; once more. That's when I gave my cousin the poster. He lived
in his family's basement. After I gave it to him he told me he would hear
someone walking around late at night while he tried to sleep. So I told
him what happened at my house. He took it down and we went outside and
burned it. When we did we saw two red eyes in the flames of the fire. After
that nothing ever happened again. This is just one of my&nbsp; many experiences
of the paranormal.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: RET32390@cs.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>A cousin, Rachel, and I were vacationing out in El Salvador to visit
some</B>
<BR><B>family. The house that we were staying at, owned by our great-grandmother,
was</B>
<BR><B>said to be haunted and alot of different ghostly occurrences happen
there. Being</B>
<BR><B>the ghost-lovers that Rachel and I were (and still are) we decided
to test</B>
<BR><B>out the house and see if it was truly haunted. One night while everyone
was</B>
<BR><B>asleep, about 12 am, we got up the courage to walk around the house
(the house has</B>
<BR><B>over twelve rooms!). So Rachel and I went to the little balcony
just outside</B>
<BR><B>of our room and we were about to go downstairs when we heard something.</B>
<BR><B>Connected to the back of the house is an old, big paper factory
which is also owned</B>
<BR><B>by my great-grandmother. Well while we were standing on the balcony
we heard</B>
<BR><B>footsteps all over coming from inside of there...then they grew
louder and it</B>
<BR><B>sounded like footsteps were coming all around us. Me and Rachel
kind of looked</B>
<BR><B>at each other in a spooked out way and as we were walking down the
stairs we</B>
<BR><B>heard moaning coming from all over below us so we ran back to our
beds and</B>
<BR><B>didn't say a word at all for the rest of the night! Later on after
the trip we had</B>
<BR><B>told my aunt, Rachel's mom, about what had happened and she said
that she</B>
<BR><B>wasn't suprised at all because the story goes that a long while
back the fields</B>
<BR><B>the house was built on had alot of deaths that occured there. One
woman was</B>
<BR><B>raped and killed there and alot of people were hung or hung themselves
on the</B>
<BR><B>trees there. She also told us of a story when she was a girl and
she was getting</B>
<BR><B>up to turn off the bedroom light to go to sleep the light swith
clicked off by</B>
<BR><B>itself. Well she fell asleep and later on she woke up very cold
and she got</B>
<BR><B>her covers from her floor and as she was doing that she saw an old-fashioned</B>
<BR><B>man standing at the doorway with a cigar in his mouth. My cousin
that lives</B>
<BR><B>there told us a story about once when she was laying in bed at night
and all of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden her bed started to levitate. There are alot more stories
about the</B>
<BR><B>house and to this day it is said to still be haunted...</B><B></B>

<P><B>I THought I was Alone</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Br3Cher@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am 31 years old, for the past 19 years I have lived with the image
of something I know I will never ever forget. It is burned into my memory
forever. My parents bought this house in Vienna Ohio in 1973. I was 1yr
old when we moved in, &amp; from as early as I can remember, I seemed to
be the target for this 'thing'. The house is on a private drive &amp; the
man who built all these houses (there are 10) on this drive lived his lonely
life out in our house. He died in the doorway between the kitchen &amp;
living room. The early 80's seemed to be the time most of this stuff went
on. My sister who is 5 years older &amp; I had to share a bedroom. I had
constant horrible nightmares just about every night that I was sleeping
in my bed &amp; the floor would fall in &amp; I would be hanging on to
the edges of the floor watching my bed fall into a fiery pit below me which
I am sure this was meant to be Hell. I was awoken many times in the middle
of the night by someone, or something, massaging my shoulders but when
I looked no one was there. I couldn't sleep at night, my mom would try
all kinds of 'remedies' to help me sleep like eating a banana before bed,
hot milk, hot tea, etc. Of course, none of these worked. I&nbsp; would
lie in bed for hours before falling asleep only to be tortured with a nightmare
of the devil &amp; of Hell. I was so young &amp; so scared, I would tell
my mom about it &amp; she would say its just a bad dream, nothing would
hurt me, until things started getting physical. I would wake up in the
middle of the night without a shirt on, stuffed under my bed, I had no
memory of how I got under my bed &amp; it happened a lot. My sister would
be sound asleep in her bed. At one time we had bunk beds &amp; I was awoken
by falling out of the top bunk, head first in my sleeping bag, with the
strings tied in a knot at my feet. Can you imagine what it was like to
be between the ages of about 9-13 &amp; stuff like this happening to you?&nbsp;
The most horrible of things happened to me when my sister spent the weekend
with our grandparents in West Virginia &amp; I was there in our room, alone
for the first time. The night began by the usual way, laying in the bed
waiting to fall asleep, my bedtime was about 8 &amp; it would be about
2 or 3 in the morning before I would be asleep. This night I was laying
there on my back, my blanket would be tucked all around me, under my feet
&amp; up around my neck. This is how I felt the safest, I would never have
my feet dangle over the bed &amp; I would jump into bed as I was convinced
that there was something under it. I stared past the doorway into the hallway,
then it happened, white glowing fingers came around the top of the doorway,
then the face, all I could see was big yellow evil looking glowing eyes
staring at me. When it came around the corner of the door, I saw a small
figure, like a midget or a child size, it's whole body had a white glow
around it. It wore a blue pilgrim hat with the black buckle on it, it had
the pilgrim style clothes, the blue velvet like jacket &amp; just under
the knee length pants with the white socks underneath &amp; the black buckle
shoes. The body came around the doorway so fast, I froze &amp; tried to
scream but nothing came out, It flew at me so fast &amp; all I could do
was pull the blanket over my head just as it got to me. I don't know how
long I laid like that, I was so afraid to peek out from under the covers.
I just knew if I looked, it would be right there in my face to get me.
When I got brave enough I looked but it wasn't there &amp; I flew out of
bed to my parents room &amp; woke them up &amp; told them something tried
to get me. They just kept saying, you had a bad dream, go back to bed,
nothing is going to get you. I was crying &amp; screaming &amp; they new
something was different about this time, it wasn't a dream. So that night
they let me sleep in their room, I just remember holding onto my mom, refusing
to leave them, I would not go back into that room. The next morning, my
mom talked to my grandparents &amp; described what I told them I saw. They
came over immediately with their bible &amp; my grandfather went into my
room &amp; said things from the bible in a different language &amp; my
grandmother hung crosses she knitted above my bed right where the thing
went through the wall. I never saw it again, the nightmares stopped. Things
still disappeared around the house or got moved mysteriously to another
location, but nothing like before. I know we had several ghost's in the
house including the mean man who built the house &amp; died there. Whenever
I told people about my experience they just thought I was crazy, I was
quiet, withdrawn, very backward &amp; always nervous. I am convinced that
this thing torturing me for whatever reason it picked me, ruined my childhood.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One other experience that wasn't mine but happened to the
newspaper delivery driver was that my parents decided that they were going
to get the newspaper delivered. The woman got the directions &amp; since
we didn't have to be home for her to come out &amp; put up the box, we
left for a short time. During the time we weren't home, she came out but
when we got home later on, way after the time it should have been done,
there was no box. My mother called the newspaper office &amp; the woman
was to come back out, she said she couldn't find the house. We stood in
the yard when we saw her coming &amp; when she pulled up she said she was
at this house earlier &amp; there was a&nbsp; man who was raking leaves
in the yard. She said she asked if the Frame's lived there &amp; he turned
to her &amp; said very evil like, No Frame's live here, &amp; went back
to raking the leaves. She said he scared her &amp; she left. Our neighbor
who lived behind us was of some relation to the man who used to live there
&amp; who died in our house, when my mother was telling her about what
happened &amp; described what the paper lady has said he looked like, she
went white &amp; said to my mother, that is Mr. Brunswick. We all got freaked
out about that one &amp; the funny thing is, when the paper lady said he
was standing right there raking the leaves, &amp; she pointed to the spot
&amp; when we all looked, the leaves were not in any piles, they were scattered
around the yard exactly as they fell off the trees.</B>
<BR><B>My parents still live there &amp; I dont like to be alone in the
house especially at night. I hear noises &amp; it has an overall creepiness
about it. My mom calls it the "hellhole", she always said from the time
they looked at it that there was something about it that wasn't right.</B>
<BR><B>You have no idea how strange I feel telling this, my stomach is
turning, my body is actually aching as I re-live these experiences in such
detail. I am sure that when I am 80 years old, I will still be able to
recall every detail of that horrible night that I thought I was alone.</B>

<BR><B>Late Night Rounds</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jewelsjlg@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I've had a couple of ghostly encounters, but the one that
I'd like to share with you happened to me while I was in college.&nbsp;
I attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah OK for a while, and
my room was located on the third floor of Wilson Hall.&nbsp; My older brother
happened to be attending college at the same time, and his room was in
the basement of Wilson.&nbsp; According to rumor, Wilson Hall was supposed
to haunted by the ghost of Florence Wilson, who reportedly died in a fire
in that building, which was then named after her.&nbsp; I think she actually
died in her home, completely unrelated to a fire, but that is neither here
nor there.&nbsp; Anyway, I had never paid much attention to the stories-
after all, aren't all dorms "haunted"??&nbsp; However, I will admit that
there was an occasional creepy moment in my room on the third floor- one
night, while at my desk listening to the stereo, I heard my door open and
close.&nbsp; When I looked up, no one was there, but the atmosphere in
my room had changed.&nbsp; I felt like someone was there with me.&nbsp;
Everything seemed a little darker, though every light I had was on-- then
the volume on my stereo started going crazy!&nbsp; It would go from soft
to loud to soft again.&nbsp; That, coupled with the new feeling in my room,
made me leave and go down to my brothers room for a while!&nbsp;&nbsp;
The most dramatic encounter happened one night around 11:30 pm or so.&nbsp;
I had been in my brothers room that evening, playing videos games, talking
with friends, you know, hanging out.&nbsp; Around 11:30, I decided it was
about time to go to my room, so I said good night and left.&nbsp; I got
about 8 feet from his door when I realized that someone in heels was coming
down the hall towards me.&nbsp; Now, I know its not unusual to hear footsteps
all hours of the night in a dormitory, so I didn't pay much attention to
it at first...but then I realized that the footsteps were about 3 feet
in front of me, and there was no one there!&nbsp; I could actually track
the steps coming towards me, walk past me and fade out further down the
hallway, and I never saw anyone.&nbsp; It happened too quickly for me to
get scared, but just the same I promptly went back into my brothers room.&nbsp;
I don't know if it was Flo or not, but I believe someone was making their
rounds that night.</B>

<P><B>My First and Hopefully Only ENcounter</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sfaltesek@pwarch.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;About two years ago my husband and I moved into a two bed two
bath apartment on the second floor while I was 7 months pregnant.&nbsp;
The apartment was made for room mates so the rooms were on opposite ends
of the apartment. We decided that the babies room would be the one with
the bathroom in it, and we would take the one without. We went ahead and
closed the air vent in the room since it wasn't being used at the time
and shut the door. Since we first moved in my husband kept telling me that
he had a weird feeling about the front room (the babies room).&nbsp; After
our daughter was born things started happening. Since I was nursing she
stayed in our room for the first few months, but every time I went into
her room I always felt like I needed to get what I came in there for and
get out of there quick.&nbsp; One day I came home from dropping my daughter
off at my mom's house and I noticed I still had the baby monitor on from
earlier that morning. When I went to turn it off I accidentally turn it
up instead of off, when I did this I could hear a baby in the monitor,
it wasn't crying just googoo gaa type sounds. It sounded so close that
I actually went into my daughters room knowing she wasn't home and looked
in the crib. The other piece of the monitor was on but nothing was there.
At first I thought okay someone has a baby near by and I am hearing their
baby in my monitor. But I don't see how if both pieces were turned on at
the same time and no one near us had a small child or a monitor. I never
thought anything of it until my sister came to stay with us. We let her
stay in the babies room until she could get back out on her own. Needless
to say she only stayed for a few weeks. After about a week she was telling
my husband and I that she hasn't been sleeping well and that she felt like
she shouldn't be in that room. We just chalked it up to her having to stay
in a new place and all that kind of stuff. One day when I came home from
work my sister and husband were sitting on the couch talking about the
kitchen. I was not really paying any attention until I heard my husband
say, "yeah I hear it all the time". It turns out that my sister heard the
dishes in the cabinets being banged around like some one was putting them
up or taking them out. She said that she could hear the cabinets opening
and closing but she was too scared to check it out. We all started joking
that the apartment was haunted and that it was trying to tell us that it
was there somehow. I just blew it off until one night I got so scared I
almost started crying. I was home alone at night, my daughter was asleep
and my husband was out with his friends. It was about midnight when I heard
a loud thump coming from the kitchen, I got up to check it out but I didn't
see anything that could have fallen or anything. While I was in there I
heard it again but it sounded like it was coming from the front bedroom.
On the other side of the wall in the kitchen is the front bedroom bathroom
I put my ear to the wall to see if I could hear anything. It sounded like
there was someone in the bath tub, I could hear the water being moved around
and thumping like their knee or elbow was bumping up against the tub wall.
First I thought someone was in my apartment and was in the front bedroom,
but in the bath tub? I couldn't figure it out, I called my husband and
told him what was going on and he said that he heard the same thing the
other night after I had gone to bed. I was terrified I didn't even attempt
to go into the bedroom I just listened for awhile trembling. I talked myself
into thinking&nbsp; it's one of our neighbors and that they will get out
soon and it will stop. I waited for my husband to get home and about two
hours later he came in and asked if it was still making the sounds, I told
him I didn't know and that I was thinking it was a neighbor in the tub
and that it probably stopped by now. When he went into the kitchen to listen
he looked over at me and asked when I first heard it, I told him around
midnight, by this time it was about 2:15am. I asked why and he said that
who ever or what ever it is, is taking a very long bath because he could
hear the bumping and thumping and the water still. I told him to go into
the bedroom and check it out but he wouldn't I think he was just as scared
as I was. After that night we didn't hear the tub thing anymore at lease
when we were there, so we just left it alone and never talked about it
again. About five months later my husband got laid off from his job so
we had to move out and into his mothers house. It took us about three days
to pack up and move. On the third day my husband and I went to the apartment
to clean and get what ever was left, I had remembered that I left a few
boxes in the front room and needed to get them. I went to open the door
but it was getting caught on something, I called my husband over to try
to push it open, and when it finally opened we were shock to see the boxes
that I had left in the room were stacked up against the door from inside
the room. Someone would have had to stacked the boxes then climbed out
of the window for that to have happened. We just grabbed the boxes and
left. On the drive to my mother-in-laws house my husband look over at me
and said, "something was going on in that apartment, I don't know what
but it wanted us to know it was there".&nbsp; We never really tried to
find out what had happened if anything in that apartment, but my husband
did ask one of the ladies that worked in the office and she said that the
previous occupants lived there for four years and that she didn't know
of anything strange going on. Because they did live there for four years
the carpet and tile in all of the rooms was replaced before we moved in,
my husband says that it was to cover up what ever happened. It could be
true or maybe not. Thanks for reading.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Grandparents</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: xdarkxtwilightx@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Part of this has been related to me through my late grandma and parts
have been experienced by my mom and myself. This is what happened to my
grandma before she passed on:</B>
<BR><B>My Grandpa died a few years before her of cancer, and my grandma
never really got over it.&nbsp; ONe incident occurred right before he died.&nbsp;
My grandpa never wanted to die in a hospital so he was moved back home
on a Monday in September 1999 [i think thats the right year].&nbsp; My
grandma kept a vigil at his bedisde the whole day and well into the night.
Early Tuesday morning, about 4:00 AM in Illinois, she awoke suddenly, just
in time to hear my grandpa's final breath.&nbsp; Soon after he died she
began to smell cigarette smoke around the house, as he had smoked his entire
life.&nbsp; Deer would always appear in the cemetary whenever her, my aunt,
or my mother would visit the grave.&nbsp; Misty, their cat, would sit in
his bedroom and meow at the top of her lungs in the middle of the night
as if she sense he was gone.&nbsp; Other times she would run straight for
his bedroom ignoring everything else, and walk out later purring [which
she rarely did].</B>
<BR><B>In March 2003 my grandma passed on, but not before seeing her kids
one last time.&nbsp; My aunt and uncle were already in Illinois and were
jsut waiting for my mom to arrive from Arizona.&nbsp; My grandma seemed
to be a comatose state not really recognizing anyone around her.&nbsp;
My mom immediately rushed to the hospital upon her arrival as it seemed
my grandma would make it through the night.&nbsp; They all stayed at the
hospital until about 10:00 PM [again i'm not sure].&nbsp; A couple hours
later they recieved a phone call that she had died.&nbsp; My grandma had
stuck it out to see all her childern together a final time.&nbsp; When
my mom was driven back to airport by my aunt, they saw two deer side by
side as they passed the cemetary.&nbsp; My mom believes that it was her
parents telling her that they were both ok and happily together again.&nbsp;
We have had many other weird signs including finding pennies from the years
they died all over the place, me dreaming that they still watch over me
and are still a part of my life, and bobby pins.&nbsp; This one took us
by suprise.&nbsp; My mom and I came out of CVS one afternoon and upon getting
into the car, my mom found a bobby pin sitting on the dashboard in a crack
near the windsheild.&nbsp; Now neither of us wore bobby pins and didn't
leave the windows open or the doors so no one could have placed it there.
ALso it was the same color and type that my grandma always pinned her hair
up with. I sincerely believe that they are my guardian angels.</B>
<BR><B>Has anyone else had such contact with deceased relatives?</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Keys</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kattee014@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just wanted you to know how much I love your website.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The more I read it,the more I know I'm not crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I visit my
fathers' gravesite very often.&nbsp; And there is a grave close to his,where
the flowers,or vase is always lying on the ground. Well, you know as I
walk by to see my Dad I fix everything,pick things up,and what not. One
particular day, I could not find my car keys out there. I looked all over
my car,almost tore the car apart too!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I walked around
where I had been.&nbsp; NO KEYS anywhere!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I figured I better
call someone to bring me my extra keys.&nbsp; Out of the blue, I got so
cold,and it was an 85 degree day, and&nbsp; heard a car door slam VERY
loudly. When I turned around there were no other cars on the same road
in the cemetery,other than mine!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I went to check,
even though I was a bit hesitant to do so, my keys were laid out on the
front seat,like someone positioned&nbsp;&nbsp; them&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly
there.&nbsp; For a minute or so,I was really scared.&nbsp; I almost wasnt
going to touch them.&nbsp; It was almost as like I heard someone telling
me it was alright,and it was for helping them.&nbsp;&nbsp; All my way home
I was thinking about that, what the hell happened out there ???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then it dawned on me. I know it was the man who's things that I was always
fixing,that found my keys,and put them there. And then he slammed the door
so I would know .&nbsp; Now when I go, I really have a good and peacefull
feeling,no matter what I hear or feel.&nbsp; Its as though I can feel his,and
my fathers' presence.</B>

<P><B>By: starchild42000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've believed in ghosts for quite a while now, but I've only had
one wierd experience.&nbsp; I lived in a ranch style house in a suburb
of Milwaukee, WI.&nbsp; My mother bought it when she was still pregnant
with me.&nbsp; She brought a friend over to see it and right when she walked
through the front door, said she could feel a presence.&nbsp; I had never
felt anything and thought my mother's friend was just imagining things.&nbsp;
But when I was about fourteen years old, I think I heard something that
was a ghost.</B>
<BR><B>I was home alone, it was the middle of the afternoon, and as I was
watching T.V. in the living room, I heard a piano playing.&nbsp; I turned
off the T.V. and listened.&nbsp; It was very faint.&nbsp; I thought maybe
the cats had accidentaly turned on my keyboard downstairs and pushed buttons
so that it played some of the prerecorded music.&nbsp; I went down to the
basement and found the keyboard off and unplugged.&nbsp; I went back upstairs
and followed the sound of the music.&nbsp; It led me to my sister's room.</B>
<BR><B>I put my ear to the door and could hear it more clearly.&nbsp; I
thought she had left on a radio or something.&nbsp; When I opened the door,&nbsp;
the music stoped.&nbsp; After I closed it again, it played for a little
while longer and then faded out.&nbsp; I still don't have an explination
and I don't live there anymore so I can't run any tests.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Phantom Phone Calls</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: karen.neufeld@shaw.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>One night, when I was home alone studying for a Math test I heard
the phone ring. So I went to the kitchen to answer it. On the other line
I heard a piercing scream. I got really freaked out and asked the person
on the other line what they wanted. Another scream, but this time it carried
the word "help." I questioned the person again about what they wanted but
it was dead silent. So I hung up the phone. I sort of thought, like pretty
much everyone would, it was a prank. Though I had convinced myself it was
a prank I still had that chilly feeling that someone really did need help,
and that blood curdling scream didn't help me to calm down. So I went back
to my studying, and about 3 minutes later I heard the phone ring again.
So I got up to answer it again. I was hoping that it was someone I did
know, someone I could confide in and tell what happened, but it wasn't.
It was that same person again. This time I decided to tell the person off.
So I started to say what I was feeling, pretty angry, yet at the same time
scared to death. Then the person replied in a hushed sort of voice:"I need
your help, I need your help, I NEED YOUR HELP!" I decided to get to the
bottom of this. I asked, "What's wrong, why do you need MY help, why have
you been calling ME?" Then the voice faded out, I heard the address of
the distressed being was, but they said something else after that that
I will never forget. What they told me not only scared me half to death
but ended up to be true. This was what they said: "Someone very dear to
you will lose their life tonight, the same way I will lose mine, they will
be......" What will happen to them, I said. Then I heard the other line
click off. Personally, in my heart I knew that this person was telling
the truth, but I did not want to believe it. So again I convinced myself
into believing it was another prank phone call. Then something even more
terrible happened. I heard the door bell ring. I went to answer it and
saw that it was the Police standing outside my door. I opened the door
cautiously, I just knew they had something terrible to tell me. What they
told me was not only terrible but utterly shocking because what the Police
told me was what the person on the phone had told me. My brother had died
in a shooting at a New Year's Eve party. To this very day I still can't
figure out why that person knew that something terrible was going to happen,
but I am thankful that they're people out in the world that will try to
help you, no matter how scary it seems, I know now I should have listened
and had a little faith.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Poltergist or Apparition?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: irishcoco@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Eighteen years ago my husband. children, and myself moved into a
house in Santa Ana, CA.&nbsp; The woman leaseing</B>
<BR><B>the home had just lost her husband a little over a month before.&nbsp;
Already she had meant and married a man she meant in Las Vegas.&nbsp; I
myself thought that to be kind of a</B>
<BR><B>short time to met and marry another man.&nbsp; She said she wanted
to move out and start over elsewhere, where there werent so many memories
of her late husband.&nbsp; Now it was obvious to me that the late husband
had taken great care of everything there, so we signed the lease for six
months.</B>
<BR><B>Now I made the couples masterbedroom into a room for my boys&nbsp;
My husband and myself took the family room with the fireplace for our room.&nbsp;
Their was a large window that opened between our rooms.&nbsp; The house
was built to be long instead of boxey, with the liveing room and kitchen
at&nbsp; the front and the big bathroom inbeteen.&nbsp; From the very beginning
I found the house to be colder than normal.&nbsp; I would be in the front
of the house doing something when I would get thouroghly chilled, and it
seemed like it happened the most in the livingroom and the kids room.&nbsp;
On our third or forth night I was in bed and I started hearing pounding
coming from the kids room.&nbsp; When I investigated it tured out to be
my seven year olds headboard of his bed, but the strangest thing was that
headboard was bolted to his beed tight and the bed was shakeing so badly
I was amazed my son hadnt awoke.&nbsp; So I moved the bed away from the
wall and went back to bed.&nbsp; No sooner than I got under the covers
then it started up again.&nbsp; The kids room was freezing and the bed
was back near the wall with the headboard pounding.&nbsp; This time I took
rolled up bath towels and put between the headboard and the wall.&nbsp;
When I went back in my room the noise started once again.&nbsp; So I went
back in again and this time I said out loud that I wanted this stuff to
stop instantly, that I liked his house and wanted to care for it now that
he was gone and that these were my small kids and how I felt he should
bother me instead of them.&nbsp; Well the pounding stopped for the night,
but in the morning my husbands clothes that he left on the floor and my
clothes which I had left ofn a chair were wet and kind of slimy.&nbsp;
This occurrance contined nightly.&nbsp; The next thing to happen scared
me to death.&nbsp; Our bathroom was long and there was a large mirror on
both of the walls, so when you llooked in the mirror you see behind you.&nbsp;
Well I got out of a hot shower one morning having left the door open to
let out the steam.&nbsp; When I got out of the shower I was toweling dry
when I felt suddenly chilled, I was looking at myself in the mirror when
I saw in the mirror behind me an elderly man frowning at me, I froze for
an instant and then looked again</B>

<P><B>By: rocknroll1@cogeco.ca</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>At the time that this account of my own took place, it would be from
the dates of June/July 1992-December 13 2002, where I grew up in eastern
Ontario.</B>
<BR><B>The house was owned by my mother's mother( my grandmother) who had
12 children and moved them all into this house through the 60's and 70's,
if Im</B>
<BR><B>exact. Subsequent speculations I have heard from relatives and people
who've been around this house, I can only call speculation, as I've never
encountered</B>
<BR><B>anything valid. So anyways, me and my family, an older brother and
sister, and my father, moved into this house in June and July of 1992.
It's a two story,</B>
<BR><B>not quite victorian model with wooden brick imitation exterior and
a black shingled roof. It has a wide yard surrounded by a circle drive
way because of</B>
<BR><B>the seperate apartments. We lived on the upstairs where my father
often tells me to mentally retarded sisters died of starvation and hypothermia
sometime</B>
<BR><B>during the depression years. The room they died in was first my
sisters, and she often told us how uncomfortable the atmosphere seemed.
I remember coming</B>
<BR><B>home from school on one afternoon for lunch with the entire apartment
to myself, and sitting in the silence I hear my sisters music box coming
from where I think is her room. So I go in, turn on the light, and sure
enough, the music stops. This bothered me, as it was puzzling and unknown
to me. I hit the lights and closed the door. Leaving the door, the music
starts again. I searched for the music box till I freaked out and ran up
the short distance to my school. I can remember telling my teachers( bad
move ). Other things happened as well, like the famous ' foot steps' you
hear in the middle of the night in the kitchen and the living room. Not
auditory halluncinations. Real. My father remembers falling asleep on the
couch one evening near Christmas and awoke in the middle of the night to
see the silhouette of what he said looke dlike a small boy walk across
the living room and actually go in behind the Christmas tree in</B>
<BR><B>the corner. He turned on the lights and saw nothing. Sometimes in
my own room at night I would be sure I would hera coat hangers dangling
together. I&nbsp; did</B>
<BR><B>open my window alot, but the closet was in such a position where
it is impossible to get a draft. The impending sense of being ' obsearved
' was present, even when alone, you'd think you'd hear ' whispers ' or
whatever. Bottom line is, everyone who came in contact with my old house
agrees, it's negative big time.</B>
<BR><B>The summer we moved intothe house I developed a fixition with detah
and horror films, drawing highly articulate but graphic ' satanic ' art
work, and playing various degrees of tortured noise on a guitar in extremley
irrate states( only this house ). My brother and I becoming depressed and
starting bad</B>
<BR><B>habits. ,my sister as well. My dad seeming more irrate, which is
odd for a white collar collected man like himself. An aunt I had who lived
there shortly became a paranoid schizophrenic screaming at the top of her
lungs, accusing the occupiers of the home of being pornography fiends and
psychotic and all this type of stuff. It went on for 8 years, right below
my room, everynight, loud as heel. She had to be 100 lbs soaking wet, deep
angry eyes, booming voice like a man, rolling her eyes at my dad until
they where wide and white( Yeah, like the Excorsist * shrugs * ). Cat's
seeing and reacting excitedly to seemingly</B>
<BR><B>thin air, usually the upper left corner of the living room. The
television would come on in the middle of the night blaring at maximum
volume. My door shook</B>
<BR><B>a few times. One door slammed. Wierd dreams, of seeing the house
a long time ago, which I know sounds ' surreal ' to say at the least, but
this really happened. My mother &amp; father, while having coffee together
on an afternoon in late 1976, when the upper apartment was brand new and
just furnished,</B>
<BR><B>and reported hearing furniture being dragged across the rug up there.
They heard this periodically for ten minutes until they decided to go see
what was going on, and sure enough, they found an empty apartment, and
while in the living room heard the furniture from downstairs sound like
it wa sbeing dragged, so vice-versa, they did the same, then it stopped
and has never been reported since. So there's a few people in the neighbourhood
with stories of there own, my friends as well as others, of impening senses
of being watched ect. This house was built on soil at least half a mile
from the lake in the southern district of the town and is estimated to
be at around 150-200 yrs old.&nbsp; The town was first occupied by Iroqios,mic
macs, nootka's, and other</B>
<BR><B>native cultures, and was invaded by Sir. Samuel De Champlain in
the late 1600's. Champlain was french, and from what I understand there
was only mild</B>
<BR><B>violence between his men and the natives, they're usual insentives
of industry being trade markets and construction. There are now at least
30 000 people in this town and sometimes I can sense that the whole entire
town has a really gloomy and negative vibe. The western area, Patrick st.
mainly, is said to have paranormal activity occur there, as well as the
famed Leacock museum( Stephen Leacock, english writer, 1800's )who occupied
a house on the shores of the towns smallest beach and took care of a disabled
son, who is said to be angry due to these circumstances, and still haunts
the residence today. They do tours there, but I haven't gone since I was
a child, and am not sure as to whether they actually mention the occurances,
but as i understand there was&nbsp; a brief&nbsp; cable/ 30 hour broadcast
about the hauntings some time in the 90's. But you should definatley check
this town out. It's called Orillia. It's in Simcoe County in central Ontario,
north of Toronto, half an hour from Barrie, and can be reached on the 11
route from Toronto about 250 miles. Check out the</B>
<BR><B>House in the southern district it's pretty much the eeriest looking
one, it's in the southern district. Im being kind enough to ensure the
identity confidentiallity of it's current occupants. Perhaps we could elaborate
on this via e-mail. Pureley socratic methods by all means</B><B></B>

<BR><B>heard them yelling at me to tell the ghosts to leave.</B>
<BR><B>When I woke up I fell from the top of my room, my bed</B>

<BR><B>Watching Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SheilaCurtin@andrewskurth.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'd like to tell you of my experience.&nbsp; When I was an adolescent,
about 13-14 yrs. old if memory serves me right, one evening after arguing
with my mother and once again threatening to run away, I left out of our
5th floor apartment in the Highbridge section of the Bronx to go sit up
on the stairs to the roof.&nbsp; After a short while, I heard the lobby
door open and heard simeone coming up the stairs.&nbsp; I looked over the
banister but couldn't see anyone, got a little scared because the stairs
were constructed in a square, so you could see anyone coming up or down
them unless they were flattening themselves against the wall.&nbsp; I thought
it was a junkie so I went inside and locked the door, and laid down on
the livingroom floor, my mom was on the couch.&nbsp; All of a sudden there
was a loud bang on the door and the door started to open.&nbsp; I was amazed
because I had locked the door.&nbsp; This dark opaque triangular shaped
"cloud" came inside, but I could feel it watching me.&nbsp; I thought I'd
lost my mind, but I was really scared of this thing.&nbsp; It kind of "sat"
in the chair for a moment, watching me, but I had a very bad feeling out
this thing.&nbsp; I started saying the "Our Father" and the prayer to Michael
the Archangel but this thing came over to me and looked me in the face
and I fainted.&nbsp; I was so scared I passed out from the fear.</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My wife and I along with our two kids, moved into our house in about
1998. It is an old house...I have tried to look for a clue to who she is
on our deed but really have not had any bites...She doesn't really do any
thing very malicious,and has actually helped us out a time or two...</B>
<BR><B>Once she threw a pillow from the front of our bed and hit my wife
and I in the heads with it...Another time, a friend of ours was over for
a visit and she hit him in the face with a stuffed animal that was hanging
off of a shelf across the room...</B>
<BR><B>She doesn't seem to be here all the time, I have actually caught
her peering around corners at me, and the rest of the family have had several
similar encounters...She has knocked on our front door several times, and
our dogs seem to sense her too, because they often follow something invisible
with their eyes...</B>
<BR><B>I am not afraid of her,she is child like and not harmful to us...It
seems that she tries to get our attention about things..</B>
<BR><B>I also have a little dog who recently died in our house...We see
her quite often on our bed or trailing along behind us like she used to
in life...</B>
<BR><B>For those of you who have bad experiences with ghosts,(I have had
them too), I can surely sympathize... But I can truly say, without a doubt
that I believe in more than what we can physically touch or hold, and I
believe that they are curious about us too</B><B></B>

<P><B>West Sumatra</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: superrama_show@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story is my father’s story happened about 40 years ago. He’s
not a big hero in this story, just one of the witnesses of maybe the most
shocking and clear appirition(do i spell it right?) that ever happened
in this world.</B>
<BR><B>The location is a village called SARIK in West Sumatra, Indonesia.
If you accidentally bump an Indonesian he/she might not know this valley
because of it’s remoteness. The village lay beside mount Barisan(in the
mount’s valley).. Sarik can only be reached after a couple hours of&nbsp;
a&nbsp; 4-wheel-drive-car ride if you don’t wish to walk a shorter pass-through
path through woods and rivers. Now, after most of the next-generation(including
my family) moved to Jakarta to seek for better life, this village, my home-land,
looks like a dead-village, only be lived-in if all the dwellers come home
together(pulang basamo’) in a wave from big cities in Indonesia.</B>
<BR><B>My father told me that appirition is not a very un-ussual things
that can be happened in this village. People are ready to be scared at
anytime. My father half jokingly said that i can meet my great-grand-parent
if i walk in the right time at the right street in the right night. He
said that some of the first generation of the villager sometimes appeared
like people who don’ know they’re dead yet, calling their families(ask
them to ‘sit and talk for a while’), who maybe came home too late, when
they pass a road in the night. So this great appirition had to be something
ussual for the villagers, right? Yep. But that time they didn’t just close
their eyes and walk faster while praying to God. Everybody were running
for their sake that night.</B>
<BR><B>The story started in a fine normal day. A villager(i forgot his
name) died that day. Normally die in a normal death. And that day, it rained
a normal rain. But, we got this person to be burried, my father said. So,
the villagers sat in the dead’s house waiting for the rain to stopped to
take their fellow vilager to his final resting place.</B>
<BR><B>Sadly eventhough it’s normal, the rain poured by God for a whole
day. For your information, muslims(Islam believers) are restricted to bury
a man after the sun sets. So, it’s must be done this afternoon or they
should go the next day.</B>
<BR><B>About 4 pm, the rain stopped, so the villagers went to the village
burial site. My father is one of the teenagers who carry the corps(the
palbearer). My father told me that the villagers were shocked when they
found the whole to bury the corps was full of water. So, some men were
appointed to took the water out. When the whole was almost empty, the rain
started to poured down again. And the whole was starting to once again
filled with water. The sun was almost finish it’s setting. So, the palbearers
were instructed to bury the corps in the half-full whole.</B>
<BR><B>Another fact that you need to know is, muslim don’t use a coffin.
We’re buried only with the accompanion of a couple of white sheets to cover
our body. And when the body is taken to the burial site, the fabric was
tied in three places: above the head, on the hips, and at the ankle. We
tie the body for two reasons: to keep the sheet attached to the body and
to maintain the body to a praying position(if you see an asian muslim prays.
The position when he prays in the first part o the prayer—standing—is the
position he will be buried. We will be buried with our arm on our belly
and feet close to each other. We will be lied like that on our right with
our body facing mecca).</B>
<BR><B>Back to the story, they take the body down on it’s right, facing
mecca. Some woods are used to keep this position. When the palbearers took
the wooden board, suddenly the body floated in the surface of the water.
Working in a rush, the palbearers must kept the body in the ‘position’
and also took the board. So, they use the feet. They took the body down
again with their feet and took the board with the hand. After the body
in the position, they got the board in place. Now, the body would stay
in position. The soil digged in again. Everything was settled, everyone
was happy. Not yet...</B>
<BR><B>Between the ‘positioning’ of the body and the ‘positioning of the
wood, there is one more ritual to do, untied the corps. They forgot this...</B>
<BR><B>Everyone went back home but soon got together again in langgar(little
mosque). One more ritual after burial. In mass, they read surra Yassin,
one of the surra/chapter from the Qur’an. The use is separated into two:
some say we read it so the dead’s condition in the cemetery will be full
of light, but the more modern muslim says it’s for the one whom left by
the dead, to give spiritual and psychological help to ease the pain. Everyone
were reading their own holy Qur’an.</B>
<BR><B>Then, one man stopped. Followed by the person next to him. They
were freaked out. The corps(oh, yeah. A body which is wrapped by the sheet
is called pocong. And some old stories is told about a ghost of this pocong
came back to life) was standing in the front of the room. “almost transparent”,
my dad said. The pocong stood there with the tie in the ‘three places’.
Everyone runned from the room. Except those old people who was to weak
to run and the langgar keeper. My father said that the keeper although
scared to death managed to stand in front of the ghost of the corpses.
“untied m I can’t rest easily with this rope.”, the ghost said, witnessed
by the villagers whose looking through the window. The mosque keeper said
yes, then the ghost disappear. Yes, almost forty people saw the ghost.</B>
<BR><B>In the next morning, the villagers went back to the cemetery and
open the whole again, untied the corps and nothing bothers the villagers
in the form of this pocong anymore.</B>
<BR><B>When i heard this story or re-telled it, the hair behind my back
are always raised. Like now. It’s a glad i’ve finished this story although
no one is in my house when i started. My parents are in the city beside
Jakarta to look one of the witness who will passed out soon(no relation
with this story).</B>
<BR><B>Conclusion: muslims don’t believed in ghost if people told it as
a spirit which come back to world to spoke what they wanted. The soul of
every dead are rest in peace after they die. We(my dad and I) believed
that that pocong was a geenie which we muslims(islam believer) called an
accompanion geenie. An accompanion geenie is a geenie which accompany each
human in this world. The geenie and the human gives effect to each other.
If one is so bad, than it’s company can be bad, vice versa. Because this
geenie is borned everytime a human is borned, they sometimes take a same
shape with the human it accompany. And sometimes it doesn’t realized that
they are different individual with the human before they die and some times
after the human’s death. So, if you see one of your family in your house
when they are supposed to be far from you, you are seeing your family’s
geenie. That’s what happened too after someone’s death. The geenie’re sometimes
felt lonely and go to the people it known. Like this case, the geenie knows
what happened to it’s company and want it’s friend(maybe it thinks themself)
to be free from the rope. Because a tied muslims are believed to be rest
un-easily.</B>

<BR><B>"THE OLD MAN IN THE BARN"</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: spirit_hunter_usa@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in rural Indiana. My house dates back to the late 1800's,
it is an old farmhouse. But the focus isn't on the house, it's on our rather
large barn. A while back, probably in the 70's, an old man lived out there.
They even put a bathroom out there. When he died, the literally through
all of his stuff in the hay loft, even his medication. I feel he is unhappy.
My friend and I were exploring the barn on new years day. All was normal
except for the occaisional "odd" feelings. We were coming near this hole
in the ground that goes under the barn, when I was violently pushed, I
then fell over a small gated&nbsp; with my ankle wedged between it. It
couldn't have been my friend. He was in front of me. My house also has
some paranormal activities, but thats a different story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Motorcycle Angels</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LaFemmeNikita82@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>It took me a long time to finally write about this because I hate
to think about what could have happened to my husband. We got married on
January 25, 2001,&nbsp; but had our ceremony on February 23, 2001. Well,
on our ceremony day I bought him a brand new motorcycle to give to him
as a present. Bad thing was that he did not know how to ride and fell in
the parking lot. So, he called his friend "B" and he came to deliver the
bike to the house. He was like a best friend to Mike (my husband). I remember
Mike was driving his bike up and down the street and he told me "He has
to be careful on that thing, people do not respect bikes anymore." I was
like, "I hope he is careful on it." Well three months went by and in May
"B" died on his bike. Now the funny thing is that Mike was with him at
the stoplight waiting to go north on main street, but at that time we had
a DJ service and he had one that night. I called him on his cell telling
him off and threatened to leave him when he got home. He came home all
mad and said, "As soon as I take a shower I am leaving with "B" again,
and I was like fine, go." About 10 minutes passed when his cousin Tony
called from the DJ and said that they had canceled the party, but we could
keep the money. I told Mike and he said OK I am on my way. Well, he left
at 9:30 PM, and when he came back to unload the fire department siren went
off (both "B" and Mike were Captains at the time). Mike took off in the
rescue truck and asked what was going on, all they told him was motorcycle
accident, man down. Well, when he got there his buddies from the police
station did not want to let him through, but he managed to get in and that
is when he saw "B" on the floor. A 16 year old drunk driver was making
a left turn on the main street and though he did see him, he thought he
could beat him, but as he was turning "B" stuck his passenger door and
flew forty feet. He was not wearing a helmet.....but that is not what killed
him....as he landed his pelvis tore a main artery and he bled to death.
B told Mike, "Tell my wife I love her and take care of my kids" and "Mike,
I will always protect you where ever you are." At 1: 30 a.m. he was pronounced
dead at the hospital. Mike was devastated and his funeral was so sad..they
paged him on the fire department pager one last time.....everyone was crying
by that point.&nbsp; Come two months (July 1) later Mike and I had just
gotten home from a bike ride and he said I will be right back I am going
to put gas and then we will get a bite to eat. I was like OK, but do not
take long. There are two ways to get to the gas station, one is through
old 83 (we live in the Rio Grande Valley, TX) and through a back road.
Since he had left I went to my grandma's and waited for him to call me.
Not even five minutes had passed when he called and said he had been in
an accident. He crashed half a block from my grandma's house, so I took
off and when I got there the bike was standing up and he was on the side,
bleeding from his elbow and then he said "Nicole, I cannot feel my legs."
At that point I started crying and went up to the 16 year old girl that
had made and illegal U-turn just to look at some boys at the park..."If
my husband dies, you die." Well, we went to the emergency room and we were
there 12 hours, most of them he was in cat-scan. Two Christmases ago (2002)
we went to my dad's house and there he told me, my dad, and my grandmother
an amazing story. He said he knew he was going to hit the car and fly over...he
down shifted to third gear (he was going about 30 miles per hour) but all
of a sudden he felt two hands on his shoulders and he flew off the bike
towards his right side and the bike hit the car. He fell on his elbows
and knees and then he landed on his butt. At that point he got up and saw
two bikers coming from west and he said they looked like the old bikers
(something like the guys from the movie Easyriders). They had big old motorcycles
with no license plates...he said that the bikes made no sound eventhough
they were on. They helped him cross the street and picked up his bike and
told Mike that they had to go because they had no license plates and the
cops were coming. By that time he was already calling me on the phone,
and I remember that I heard in the background some weird noises, but I
can assure you it was not human..just a bunch of static. He says that they
took off fast towards the East, but they made no noise.......I was coming
from the East side and I saw Mike on the curb but I did not see any bikers
or they did not pass me or I heard no sound. Mike says he clearly saw me
in the truck and he saw the bikers zoom by me. I asked around to see if
any one had seen anyone pick up his bike and everyone said that all that
they remember is Mike hopping 3 feet in the air from his bike and then
saw him and his bike on the other side. It is like time stopped and these
angels came and saved his life. I know it was B and another fellow biker
named David who had recently died in a motorcycle accident as well. I was
going to be a widow at 18. I cry just thinking what could have been and
it makes me realize that life is precious and it could be gone so quickly.
I am writing this to honor B and other bikers who have died riding motorcycles..and
to thank them for saving my husbands life. Thanks for giving him a second
chance at life............GOD sent them to help him and realize that angels
do exist.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Live Oak Inn Restaurant</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: StarDragn187@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi! my name is Nichole. I have worked at the restaurant called Live
Oak Inn for several months now and all the employees have been talking
about our ghost lately. I have been interested in ghosts a long time and
am extremely interested in this specific haunting. There have been a few
things that have lead me to believe that our waitress ghost is real and
she is mad. I have heard the story but would like to read it myself. If
you could send me the information you have on this haunting I would appreciate
it very much so. Well, that poor girl was murdered by the cook and another
man is in jail for the murder. She was left in a car trunk, dead, for days,
I would be pi++ed of too.</B>
<BR><B>My experience with her is not too intense, but interesting. The
first thing that I noticed working there was that she still walks around
the dinning area. We recently brought in a door bell thing so we know when
our orders are up and I don't think she likes it very much. On the other
hand she could really like it because there may be no one in the kitchen
and the door bell will go off in a little chime song instead of the normal
"ding dong" that it does when someone is back in the kitchen and pushes
it. Lately that has been happening a lot more. Ever since there has been
more talk about her and the happenings around the restaurant. The second
thing that happened was with one of the old fashion soda cans that we have
up on a shelf thing. I was standing there with a group of friends and siblings
and all of a sudden there was a loud noise like a baseball bat hitting
one of the soda cans. Then, one of the soda cans almost hits my little
sister in the head. When I picked up the soda can there wasn't a dent on
it. I put it back and we went on with our business and all I could think
about all night was what is going to happen next.</B><B></B>

Lake Cemetary in Hibbing, Minnesota.&nbsp; We arrived at the cemetary at

pictures of them.&nbsp; We heard footsteps walking in the grass next to
us but we couldn't see anything.&nbsp; We brought camera's and a tape player
with us and although we didn't get anything on audio tape we photographed
several star-like images up to a dozen in each picture.&nbsp; It is unlike
anything we've ever seen in any books or online.&nbsp; the stars actually
have prongs that stretch out from the center.&nbsp; Have you ever seen
anything like these before??&nbsp; We heard about Swan Lake from this site
and are looking forward to investigating this place more thoroughly.&nbsp;

<P><B>Well somthing weird is going on in my house and I need to know what
is going on....FIrst of all, I probably know what started it. It was probably
the coolest, not to mention kinda stupidist thing I have ever did. I tried
out a ouiji board with my friend, and it didn't work, but afterwords when
I did it alone, which I know I shouldn't have done, it worked. But the
only ting that happened was the glass thingy moved to the moon. When my
mom woke up and her buzzer was going off, she got up and her another buzzer
ringing. She walked into the kitchen to find that the microwave timer went
off...at the exsact time she woke up. Then I called my mom the next day
to let her know I was home, and I then hung up the phone on the charger,
I was home alone. I then went to go take a shower and got ready. Then I
opened my bathroom door and there was the phone on the ground...then it
rung, it turned out to be my mother and I told her what happened. The next
couple of days were fine, and I thought nothing of anything that went on,
but then my friend came over again, the same friend that tried the ouiji
board with, and we were reading magazines on my bed in my room,then my
c.d. boom box went off along with the fire alarm....freaky huh?</B>

<P><B>Right, first of all my story's not that great or scary but it did
happen and nothing was there to have caused this so here goes.</B>
<BR><B>One night in january, It was late and i had nothing to do so i stay
up late. Around 1:00 a.m. I was getting bored and decided to go to sleep.
I like leaving the blinds open so that light gets in, and the blinds were
closed. I got up tp open the blinds, and after I open them, I hear a really
loud SHHH! coming right next to my ear! I was a bit spooked by this so
i just think nothing of it and went to bed. About 10 minutes later I heard
voices coming from the living room. I went to see who was there, but everyone
was asleep. I was getting freaked out so I sleep with the ight on. I awoke
at around 5:51 and as soon as I woke up I felt something wasn't right.
It was feeling that someone was staring at you, And when I turn on the
light to see who's there, everything seems fine and the feelings no longer
there. I see this as strange because in the past 2 years that we've had
this house noth</B>
<BR><B>g like this has ever happened before. Maybe it was one of them wandering

<P><B>Headless Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: scott215@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>This happened to me when I was four years old.&nbsp; We lived in
a small house in Robbinsdale, Minnesota.&nbsp; While I was in my bed sleeping
I would wake up around one oclock in the morning and see headless figures
walking around the bedroom.&nbsp; I shared this room with my older and
younger brother.&nbsp; Niether of them ever saw these figures.&nbsp; One
night my Mom came into the room to check on my younger brother who was
still in a baby crib.&nbsp; I could see the figures coming into the room
and standing by the crib.&nbsp; I told my Mom they are right there and
would point to them with my finger.&nbsp; She would look around and tell
me it was my imagination playing tricks on me and I should lay down and
go to sleep.&nbsp; This continued for about a year until we moved to Coon
Rapids.&nbsp; Once we had left the house I stopped seeing these figures.&nbsp;
For years I thought that I was just imagining things until I found some
friends who like you have an understanding of the paranormal.&nbsp; Although,

<P><B>I would just like to let you know about the authenticity of the claim
that Yaley Elementary School is haunted.&nbsp; This past summer my father
was on the remodeling crew that helped remodel that caffeteria... No one
was decapitated during this job.&nbsp; And if this was a previous remodel
that this accident had taken place, I personally know the leader of the
Boone County School Maintanence Dept. and he has been the leader for several
several years and he knows of no such thing... Plus when my father was
on the remodeling crew at Yaley I helped run security for it at wee hours
of the morning because due to the remodeling the school had several holes
in walls and was easy to access from the outside... most of this time the
maintanence crew was outside patrolling the area, I on the other hand was
inside the school ALONE... for several nights and many times was in that
part of the building and heard and saw nothing... The only reason I am
sending you this is because I take stuff like this very seriously, I started
ghost hunting early as a kid after watching ghostbusters... If I want people
to take me seriously I would want my information to be accurate... As for
the supposed things happening on Big Bone Rd... Well sir I will tell you
this, my aunt and uncle live on that road and have about 3 acres... I have
been going there several times a year since I was born and never have heard
or saw anything out of the ordinary... I have lived in Florence all my
life and I can tell you that both of these are false...&nbsp; I dont mean
to critisize but like I said if you want people to take you serious, you
have to make sure that your information is accurate.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Drums</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bow_to_the_princess6@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i have a ghost that my friend and i have discovered recently. We
were taking a walk in the area i keep my horse. It's about five acres big.
There is a fence that seperates mine and my neighbors property, but he
opened it over the summer so that my animals could walk back and forth.
My friend and i reached the fence that seperates the land and she stopped.
"What's that?" she asked me. all i heard was my neighbors dogs and i told
her it was nothing, but she claimed to hear a mans voice chanting and another
noise, really close. After another two steps or so i thought that i heard
something that sounded like a drum. My friend told me that was what she
heard earlier. It sounded like it was coming from a big drop off that used
to shelter a civil war railroad. We crept over to the very edge of the
dropoff, and it seemed loudest there. We couldn't see anything so we left,
but we continued to hear the drumming. After we left the area it stopped.
I want to go and see if anything is there, like a rune on the walls of
the ditch (they're made of rock).</B><B></B>

<P><B>Work Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jcamp35354@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>This is my third story entry and it's about a ghost? where I work
at.&nbsp; First a little background.&nbsp; I work at a convenience store
just outside of town.&nbsp; Although the store is no more than a mile or
so from town, the area around it is fairly quiet and deserted at night,
which is of course the shift I work.</B>
<BR><B>The store has been around for quite a while and used to be a full
service station.&nbsp; Some of you may remember them.&nbsp; Attendants
actually pumped your gas, cleaned the windows, checked oil, things like
that.&nbsp; They also had two service bays for working on cars.&nbsp; The
station has been around since the late fifties or early sixties and in
the mid seventies a large company bought the station and remodeled it into
the c-store that it is now.</B>
<BR><B>I worked there once before in the mid nineties and found myself
back at the station a little over three years ago.&nbsp; The first time
I worked there I didn't really pay attention to anything that happened
there that might have been considered strange, mainly because I hadn't
heard any stories of any strange occurances from my co-workers or the customers.&nbsp;
That changed a year and a half ago but it is also why I put the question
mark by ghost at the beginning, I'm not sure if it's a ghost or just very
weird coincidences.</B>
<BR><B>Well anyway, a friend of mine happened to stop in and we had been
chatting for a few minutes when the subject of ghosts came up.&nbsp; I
had told her that my abnormal psych professor had made the comment that
possessions couldn't be ruled out in all cases of apparent mental problems
and she said "oh yeah, and what do you think about Charlie?"&nbsp; I must
have gotten a confused look because then she said "you know, Charlie, the
ghost here at *****."</B>
<BR><B>She told me that she had heard that one of the workers from back
when the station was still full service had suffered a fatal heart attack
at work and ever since then the station had been haunted although Charlie's
appearances were few and far between.&nbsp; "So" I replied, "there is a
ghost named Charlie that haunts this place?"</B>
<BR><B>"Yeah, haven't you ever had anything happen while you have been
working?"</B>
<BR><B>I shook my head and said no and no sooner did the words leave my
lips than an oil bottle fell off the shelf.&nbsp; My friend went over and
picked it up and was smiling as she walked back up to the counter.&nbsp;
"See, Charlie is letting you know he's around."</B>
<BR><B>I indicated that with the way the bottles were stocked on the shelf
that it could have been unbalanced and finally tipped over at just the
right time.&nbsp; "Purely a coincidence" I indicated, "they happen all
the time."</B>
<BR><B>Me and my big mouth.&nbsp; Right after I said that, once again a
bottle jumped off the shelf, only this time it was a bottle of power steering
fluid.&nbsp; After that I had to admit that having the same coincidence
happen twice within a couple of minutes had astronomical odds.&nbsp; My
friend left shortly after that and ever since I have heard odd noises and
had things fall off the shelves that shouldn't have been able to fall,
at least not three times in a row like has happened a couple of times.&nbsp;
Four or five times since then I have been standing outside checking trash
and could have sworn that I heard the phone ringing.&nbsp; I make a mad
dash inside to answer the phone only to find nothing.&nbsp; No phone ringing,
dial tone when I pick it up, everything normal.&nbsp; Other times I have
been in cleaning the bathrooms and heard the door open like someone walked
in and went out to find the store and parking lot empty.&nbsp; I'm still
working there and I still have things like that happen on occasion.&nbsp;
So what do you think, ghost or really strange coincidences.</B>

<BR><B>Strange</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hc_godess@excite.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It's been a long time since I've even talked about this, so please
bear with me...</B>
<BR><B>It is not uncommon in my family to see ghosts. My Aunt, Grandfather,
and I are all what you would call "sensitives" although we do not call
ourselves that. Until I was about 8 or so, my mother, younger brother,
and I lived with my grandparents in an old house above what used to be
an appliance store.</B>
<BR><B>Now, to understand these stories, you must first know what I know
about the history of the house. The woman who lived there before us died
on the toliet. I am not making this up. You must also understand the layout
of this house. Since it was above an old store, you would have to go around
the back of the house, up the steps to the porch and enter the house through
the kitchen. From the kitchen you would enter the dining room (although
we did not use it as such) and then the living room. Off of the livi room,
there was a strange little room that was made into a play room for me that
was made of nothing but windows on 3 sides. The stairs to the third floor
were in the dining room and right at the top of the steps was the bathroom.
There was a small landing and two doors - one that led to the bedroom next
to the bathroom and one that led to my grandparents room. You had to walk
through my grandparents room to get to the third bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>The room next to the bathroom was set up as my bedroom, but I refused
to sleep there for as long as I could remember. Everytime I would try,
I would have a dream where I was being attacked and wake up screaming -
running through my grandparents room to get to the room that my mother
slept in. Finally, I was moved in there with her, but the dreams didn't
stop. I had scarlet fever when I was 5, and that was when things took a
strange turn. I remember waking up and seeing the face of an old woman
sitting next to my bed, watching me nervously. She wasn't my grandmother,
but her friends had been in and out, so I just thought she was one of them.
Later when I woke up I asked my Nana who had been here to see me and she
said no one.</B>
<BR><B>After that was when I first remember hearing the voices. There were
two of them at first - male and female - and they came from the dining
room area. Now, this was where we kept these dolls that my father (who
was in the Navy) had sent me from Spain. I had always been afraid of these
dolls (I still am, as a matter of fact - so much so that they are packed
away in my grandparents' basement) and hearing the voices coming from where
they sat didn't help matters. They would tell me things or just talk amongst
themselves. Eventually, a third voice joined the party - the voice of an
old woman. I was about 6 or so and sitting in the living room while my
Nana was out in the kitchen. I asked her a question and heard someone answer
me, but I couldn't make out what was being said. So I got up and went to
the kitchen (performing my ritual of squashing myself gainst the wall to
be as far away from the talking dolls as possible) to ask her what she
said. She hadn't even heard me ask the question. I went back into the living
room in time to see the door to the playroom open and close, as if someone
was walking through it.</B>
<BR><B>I am not the only person who had strange experiences in that house.
As I said, my grandfather is also sensitive to these things. One Christmas,
Poppop had fallen asleep on the sofa in the living room and was woken to
the sound of the train under the tree turning itself on and running around
the track. Years later, when I was a teenager, he told me he saw an older
lady one night in my room next to the bathroom when he got up to go in
the middle of the night. My Aunt live d with us when she was pregnant with
her first child and felt someone grab her by the ankles and drag her out
of bed right before her water broke. She also heard someone singing to
comfort my colicky cousin - it was the voice of an old woman.</B>
<BR><B>My mother and grandmother never experienced any of this - at least
not that they admit to. My mom does tell stories of finding me holding
conversations with people who weren't really there and she still questions
my fear of those dolls. After we moved out of that house, we lived in another
for about a year where I would nightly see a figure all in white walk into
my room, past my bed, and right into the closet - whether the door was
open or not, and it rarely was. My step father worked third shift while
we lived there and one evening after he woke up, he asked my mother who
had been slamming the door all day. My mother replied no one, because none
of us had been in the house all day - in fact, we had walked in only 5
minutes before he woke up. He said that he had had trouble sleeping all
day long because he kept hearing someone slamming the front door. We have
been in our current house for about 14 years now and I have not had that
feeling I get when there is "someone" else around - and trust me, I can
tell! I have spent the ni t at friends' houses and not been able to sleep
because I have that feeling.</B>
<BR><B>I hope none of this sounds weird to you. Writing it down has made
me realize how strange some of this sounds, but I swear that it is all
true to the best of my memory. Thank you for listening.</B>

<P><B>Cedric</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: janameehan@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband often tells the story of his early dating life. He was
seeing a</B>
<BR><B>young woman, we'll call her Jan, who lived in a home with her parents
and</B>
<BR><B>sisters. One night, my husband was visiting and the family had gone
to bed</B>
<BR><B>upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>The only stairway to go upstairs was in plain view of the living
room, so no</B>
<BR><B>one could have come downstairs or gone to the kitchen without being
noticed</B>
<BR><B>by the young couple.</B>
<BR><B>He and Jan were sitting on the couch smooching when a sound came
from the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen. The two went to investigate and Jan found a hand-held crank-style</B>
<BR><B>can opener on the floor next to the table. She muttered something
about</B>
<BR><B>"Cedric" and placed the can opener on the kitchen table.</B>
<BR><B>The couple resumed necking in the living room when the noise was
heard</B>
<BR><B>again. On returning to the kitchen, the can opener was found under
the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen table. Jan searched around the entire downstairs, talking
to her</B>
<BR><B>younger twin sisters and making threats about them playing jokes
on her and</B>
<BR><B>her boyfriend.</B>
<BR><B>But there was no one there. Everyone was upstairs sound asleep.</B>
<BR><B>Jan placed the can opener in the precise center of the kitchen table.</B>
<BR><B>My future husband, by this time, was quite nervous, and asked her
what was</B>
<BR><B>going on. Jan explained that Cedric was their ghost and he had lived
in the</B>
<BR><B>house with her and her family as long as she could remember. He
was</B>
<BR><B>harmless, she explained, but often did odd, disturbing things, banging</B>
<BR><B>things around, hiding things, being a nuisance.</B>
<BR><B>My husband returned reluctantly to the couch with Jan, but they
weren't</B>
<BR><B>there but a few moments when the sound of the can opener falling
from the</B>
<BR><B>table was clearly heard.</B>
<BR><B>He made an excuse and left the house. I don't believe he ever visited
there</B>
<BR><B>again.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Childhood Memories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: thesalvageguy@new.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I grew up in this very old 2 story house in Coldwater Mich. This
house had the upstairs converted into a small apartment. My bedroom was
a small porch on the backside of the house. The porch had this open doorway
that went into the kitchen and a concrete stairway that led into the basemet.
My age was around 6 or 7 when most of these problems occured. Many nights
I was awoke by howling sounds coming from the registar grate near my bed.
This was very strange because the heating system had been turned off. One
night this sound came through the grate and as it stopped I felt someone
sitting along side me on the bed while I laid there wide awake. I slept
with my head covered because I was very scared.I laid there awake and didnt
move an inch. Finally I tried to move but found out my arms were being
held down. Then I felt this terrible pain as something was grabbing my
sides. I tried to scream but nothing came out. The howling sound started
again and I knew that whatever attacted me was now leaving. I woke very
early just around daylight one morning to a stange noise. I looked over
a the open doorway that led into the kitchen area and noticed a lady standing
in the doorway spraying something out of a can . The person had no facial
expression and apeared to be part of a cloudy haze. I watched as this figure
stood there motionless spraying that stuff. The figure staired strait ahead
without moving an inch. I covered my head and a while later I got the nerve
up to uncover my head and noticed the image had left. I questioned my mother
that day and she told me it wasnt her and that I must have had a bad dream.
I told her I was wide awake at the time. My father drank a lot and always
made fun of me when I tried to explain what I saw. My parents converted
the upstairs apartment back to a bedroom. I then moved upstairs and this
put an end to my problems. I remember what happened like it was yesterday
and often wonder what might have happened in that house to make the spirits
so active. I often wonder why I was the only one who had these problems
in the house. I have been visited by othe spirits in other houses I have
lived in but they were short term events. This isnt something I wrote to
get your attention. These things really happened to me and I am a firm
beleiver in the spiritual afterlife. I sometimes wonder if im going to
be one of those lost spirits myself because I seem to be magnetic to them.
I know that im not alone because some of of the stuff I have read comes
very close to what happened to me.</B>

<BR><B>Hauntings at my nan's</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: GOVUSLIPS@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I live in guildford just like my nan and spend every weekend at
her house.The only problem is that it is haunted by unknown sprits. It
would all date back to before I was born.</B>
<BR><B>It was late one night about 30 years a go and my nan was downstairs
(my grandad was at work and my Mum and 2 uncle's were upstairs in bed asleep
(they were between 12-7). When she heard footsteps coming down the stairs.
She thought it was one of the kids and shouted for them to go back to bed
then they stoped dead. She left it for a second or two before going to
check who it was. She looked and there was no one there. She went upstairs
to check they were all awake and messing around but they all were fast
asleep.</B>
<BR><B>The second&nbsp; haunting was about a year later and my nan was
down stairs in the living room and again my Grandad wasn't there. In the
room above her she heard a loud thud like something heavy or big being
thrown across the room. She went upstairs into what at that time was my
two Uncle's room, only one was there (the other at a friends for the night).
She went in and he was sound asleep and nothing appearred to have moved.</B>
<BR><B>The next recent event afterwas when my Mum was in her late teens.
She was playing basketball with her mate out the on the pavement in the
back garden when she just happened to look up into her bedroom window (now
the study) . There glaring down at her was a girl wearing a white frilly
night-gown about 7-8 years of age. She remained there only about a second
or so before disappearing.</B>
<BR><B>Most recent events have been the volume bar on the T.V in the living
room going down. My Nan thought my Grandad was sitting on the romote control
when she spotted it was on the other side of the sofa next to her. She
turned it back upan remained watching then the volume bar came up and start
to go down again, she turned it up again. After that it did not do it again.</B>
<BR><B>Another recent event would be me and my friend doing and experiment
in the Study to see if the mouse clicks by it's self. We set up my karoke
machine with a tape and placed the mic right in front of the mouse buttons.
We both left the room and went into the loft conversion, this was so no
one could creep in there and ruin are experiment. When my sister came up
stairs we went in there and stopped recording. We&nbsp; listened to the
tape a heard the mouse click numerous times. This freaked us out a bit.</B>
<BR><B>Other things have been hearing people walk across the landing when
there is no one there, Sensing someone is there (spirts ?),&nbsp; heavy
breathing coming from a wardrobe ( Now has stopped), a dead cat found under
some floorboards decopsing (looked like it had been there months) there
was no way it could have got there). My dog also used to bark behind the
T.V and up the stairs at nothing.And finally my Nan's now deseased dog
used to stand at the bottom of the stairs growling and then shoot forward
barking.</B>
<BR><B>Things aren't as bad but we still have are sightings and goings
on. Hope you injoyed this, I certainly did finding out about these.</B>
