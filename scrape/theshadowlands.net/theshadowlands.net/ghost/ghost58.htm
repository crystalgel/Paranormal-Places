<H3><A NAME=my>My Families Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>These are stories I have heard from my father and my grandparents.
 My</B>
<P><B>grandparents live in a farm house that was built in the 40s.</B>
<P><B>Supposedly, an old man and a woman died in the house.  My dad and his</B>
<P><B>four brothers had many experiences growing up in that house.  Here
are a</B>
<P><B>few of them that I have heard.  At the top of the stairs to the

second</B>
<P><B>floor is a room right to the right that had a bed.  One of my dad's</B>
<P><B>brothers was sleeping in there one night when they were young and he</B>
<P><B>heard footsteps walk up the stairs and around his bed.  No one was</B>
<P><B>there.  Then something started pulling at his toes.  He left the bed

in</B>
<P><B>a hurry and has never slept there again.  My dad has two brothers who</B>
<P><B>are identical twins and there were both in the service.  At one

vacation</B>
<P><B>time, they brought a friend home with them to stay.  The guy woke up

in</B>
<P><B>the middle of the night and said he saw things in the room and he

left</B>
<P><B>to never come back.  My dad was very reluctant to tell me some of the</B>
<P><B>things that happened to him.  My grandmother even said she had to put</B>
<P><B>him in a cold bath one night to calm him down.  He won't till this

day</B>
<P><B>tell us what happened then, but he told me other stuff.  There were

two</B>
<P><B>other bedrooms upstairs besides the room to the right of the stairs.

 He</B>
<P><B>was sleeping in one of them one night when he woke up to a figure of

a</B>
<P><B>white woman standing beside his bed.  He said he didn't feel scared

at</B>
<P><B>all and just rolled over and went back to sleep.  Another time he was</B>
<P><B>downstairs in the kitchen watching the dinner that was being cooked.</B>
<P><B>Everyone else was outside doing chores.  He said he had the strongest</B>
<P><B>feeling that someone in the back room on that floor and was making

their</B>
<P><B>way towards the kitchen.  He ran outside and refused to go back in
by</B>
<P><B>himself.  All those things happened back when my dad was young, in

the</B>
<P><B>sixties.  Stuff has happened recently also.  My grandmother will be

in</B>
<P><B>the basement doing laundry and hear footsteps on the floor above her</B>
<P><B>when she knows no one is home.  One night, my grandparents woke up
to a</B>
<P><B>loud crash.  They went into the living room and the 36 inch tv was
on</B>
<P><B>the floor.  This tv sits in an entertainment center in its own space

and</B>
<P><B>for it to fall out, the whole huge entertainment center would have

had</B>
<P><B>to been tipped over.  They checked the whole house to make sure the</B>
<P><B>windows were locked and doors were locked and they were.  Only one
of</B>
<P><B>the knobs was broken on the tv.  My grandmother also says she catches</B>
<P><B>glimpses of a man walking in and out of rooms sometimes.  Another

spooky</B>
<P><B>thing that has happened actually didn't happen in the house.  The

farm</B>
<P><B>is in Spotsylvania County, Virginia where many civil war battles took</B>
<P><B>place.  We have found many remnants of that while digging around the</B>
<P><B>property.  One day, my dad said he was in one of the fields when the</B>
<P><B>sounds of a battle faded in to where he could here the shots and

yells.</B>
<P><B>He could see nothing and it was a bright sunny day.  He stood there

and</B>
<P><B>listened to them and then the noises slowly faded away.  Needless to</B>
<P><B>say, I will not spend the night in that house.  I hope one day to

find</B>
<P><B>out exactly what happened in that house. &nbsp;Thank you for letting
me tell my story.</B>
<P><B>  I have been a big fan of your website for a while!</B>

<H3><A NAME=ghostly>Ghostly Grandmother</A>
</H3><P><B>by name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was a young girl, my grandmother would entertain me with

stories</B>
<P><B>of her childhood.  She told she was physic and had had many physic

and</B>
<P><B>paranormal experiences including out of body traveling.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She had very old fashioned beliefs.  She didn't believe in many

modern</B>
<P><B>day conveniences, financial institutions and safety deposit boxes was</B>
<P><B>not one of them.  When I was about 10 years old, she took me back in

her</B>
<P><B>den, into a walk-in closet and told me she had something she wanted

to</B>
<P><B>show me.  She proceeded to lift the carpet and pull up on a piece of</B>
<P><B>wood which was a part of the floor.  Revealed under the floor was a</B>
<P><B>chest of some sort, (it kind of looked like a treasure chest).  She</B>
<P><B>pulled it up from the ground and opened it.  In it, was every piece

of</B>
<P><B>expensive jewelry she owned, rare coins, rare (confederate) money,

and</B>
<P><B>her life savings in cash.  She tried to impress upon me how important

it</B>
<P><B>was that I remember this day and what she had to tell me.  She said
I</B>
<P><B>would be the only person besides herself that would ever know about

it,</B>
<P><B>because I was the only one she could trust with this information.

 And,</B>
<P><B>that when she died, I was to retrieve it.  At ten years old, I was

very</B>
<P><B>intrigued, but that was all.  I was not old enough to appreciate the</B>
<P><B>importance of what I was seeing and definitely not old enough to</B>
<P><B>understand the value of what I saw.  It was never mentioned of or

spoken</B>
<P><B>about again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Seventeen years later, my grandmother died of natural causes.  I was</B>
<P><B>living in Kentucky with a family of my own.  I flew back to

California</B>
<P><B>for the funeral.  The next day my mother an I were walking through

her</B>
<P><B>house cleaning things up and gathering personal effects that we

wanted</B>
<P><B>out of the house.  I was to catch a plane that afternoon back to</B>
<P><B>Kentucky.  The house was going to be put up for sale within a few

days,</B>
<P><B>and I knew I would never see the house again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had long since forgotten about the secret hiding place and the</B>
<P><B>valuables that my grandmother had hidden in the closet.  I was</B>
<P><B>daydreaming and thinking of old times as I made my last walk-through

of</B>
<P><B>the house.  As I walked past THE closet, something or someone,

grabbed</B>
<P><B>me from behind (one hand on each shoulder and jerked me to a complete</B>
<P><B>standstill.  Then my body was turned (forcefully) towards the door
to</B>
<P><B>the closet.  At that moment, an overpowering fragrance of my</B>
<P><B>grandmothers perfume invaded the air.  I don't think, I KNOW my</B>
<P><B>grandmother was there!!  It was then, that I remembered that day</B>
<P><B>seventeen years ago.  The memory was so strong, and so real, it was

like</B>
<P><B>it had just happened the day before.  I called to my mom and told her

to</B>
<P><B>help me.  We pulled up the carpet, and the wooden floor and just like

17</B>
<P><B>years ago, the chest was in the exact same place.  We pulled up the</B>
<P><B>chest and opened it, and we found everything that my grandmother</B>
<P><B>considered of value.  Cash, jewelry, bonds, rare coins and other</B>
<P><B>miscellaneous items. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Later, we figured the value of the contents to be over $20,000.00</B>
<P><B>dollars.  If I hadn't experienced the entity that stopped me in my</B>
<P><B>tracks, the house would have been sold with the chest still in it,

and</B>
<P><B>either one of two things would have happened:  The new owners would

have</B>
<P><B>stumbled upon a great treasure, or it would have stayed buried</B>
<P><B>underground for all time. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Do I believe in ghosts?  What do you think?</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Added Note:  Two months later after returning to Kentucky, I was

driving</B>
<P><B>to the store, and my 2 year old daughter asked me "Did my great</B>
<P><B>grandmother die"? (Because of her age, I had chosen NOT to tell her),

I</B>
<P><B>was shocked that she even knew what "dead" meant.  I answered "Yes</B>
<P><B>honey, she died and went to heaven.  Who told you that she died?".

  Her</B>
<P><B>answer really spooked me.  She replied, "She did.  I talk to her all

the</B>
<P><B>time"!</B>

<H3><A NAME=experience>Ghostly Experience</A>
</H3><P><B>by snyderco@dc.infi.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was living in South Carolina, as a student at the University,

I</B>
<P><B>made friends with my roommate's friend. His girlfriend had committed</B>
<P><B>suicide several months before and a close friend of my brother's had

as</B>
<P><B>well, so I understood what he was feeling. He invited me to his

house,</B>
<P><B>which he used to share with his girlfriend. THe house was adjacent
to</B>
<P><B>the main house where his parents lived. His mom was cooking an

elaborate</B>
<P><B>meal and while it was being prepared, he asked me if I wanted to take

a</B>
<P><B>look at his house, which he had built.  So we went over. It was dusk.

He</B>
<P><B>took me on a tour of the house and we made our way to his bedroom.
At</B>
<P><B>this point, the phone rang so he excused himself. The room wasn't

well</B>
<P><B>lit and there was only some light coming in from the hall. I suddenly</B>
<P><B>felt cold and like there was someone standing behind me. I called out

to</B>
<P><B>my friend, thinking he was playing a joke on me. I felt this presence</B>
<P><B>really strong. I don't know why but I assumed it was her. I'd never

met</B>
<P><B>her before.  I told her that it was okay, I was not out to take her</B>
<P><B>boyfriend. We were only friends. Then I wandered around the place and</B>
<P><B>for some reason stopped at a little room and was stuck in the

doorway,</B>
<P><B>facing the closet.  My friend had finished his phone call and came

over</B>
<P><B>to me and asked why I was just standing there. I said I had no idea.

He</B>
<P><B>asked me, "Do you know you're standing right next to where she shot</B>
<P><B>herself?"  It was very spooky. He took out a bunch of pictures and</B>
<P><B>letters from her. She was so beautiful and I felt so sad. I felt like</B>
<P><B>she was also there with us but instead of feeling cold, it felt like

she</B>
<P><B>was just sitting nearby and listening. No animosity.</B>

<H3><A NAME=seaview>Seaview</A>
</H3><P><B>by XdoOdLeX@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 4 years ago, my friends and i went to this abandoned place

called</B>
<P><B>Seaview to skip out on our morning classes. ( i was 15 at the time
) Seaview</B>
<P><B>was a tuberculosis hospital many years ago and now just sits there.
 i could</B>
<P><B>feel that many people suffered and were neglected there and the place

just</B>
<P><B>spooked me.  my friends and i just hung out, we walked around in one
of the</B>
<P><B>buildings, and found a place to sit and hang out.  the next morning
i woke up</B>
<P><B>for school, and as i was walking down the hall to my bedroom, i turned

around,</B>
<P><B>i don't know why, i just did.  standing at the end of the hallway was
a figure</B>
<P><B>that looked like the grim reeper.  it was dressed in black, and had
a hood</B>
<P><B>over it's face.  i couldn't see it's face, and it seemed to be floating

over</B>
<P><B>the ground a bit.  i turned away, and it was gone.  the same day, i

was</B>
<P><B>walking home from school, and across the street there was a church.
 i looked</B>
<P><B>across the street to the parish house  ( the house where the priests
live )</B>
<P><B>and there was the same figure standing in front of the door with his

arms</B>
<P><B>streched out.  i turned away, and again it was gone.  i never went

into</B>
<P><B>Seaview again.  do you blame me?  i don't know what it was i saw, or
why i saw</B>
<P><B>it, for my friends didn't see anything.  although, i told a co-worker
and my</B>
<P><B>uncle about my experience and they saw the same thing.  the only difference

is</B>
<P><B>they were at Seaview at night, and i wasn't .  they also saw the figure

at</B>
<P><B>Seaview.  never outside of it.  if anyone knows what it was or why
i saw it, i</B>
<P><B>would sure like to know.</B>

<H3><A NAME=house>The House in Michigan</A>
</H3><P><B>by  I3loodOmen@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I know you probably get alot of hoaxes and stories that never happened
sent to</B>
<P><B>you each day but what I am about to tell you is the honest to gods
truth. Some</B>
<P><B>events I shall tell you about have been witness by more than one person

on</B>
<P><B>several occasions. It seems alot of them happened while I was around.

Perhaps</B>
<P><B>there is some link between myself and these things. I really dont remember

the</B>
<P><B>exact order each of these incidents happend but I placed them in the

best</B>
<P><B>chronological order I could. Well here goes.....</B>
<P>
<P><B>We have lived in our house for about 13 years now. I dont wish to tell
you the</B>
<P><B>address and or city we live in but I'll tell you this much. We live
in the</B>
<P><B>Downriver Area of Michigan. I dont know the history of the land this
house is</B>
<P><B>built on or the history of the house itself. I am 23 years old and

together</B>
<P><B>with my mom, two brothers, and freinds we have compiled a list of things

that</B>
<P><B>happened. I'll use thier real names beacuse I do not feel that we

have</B>
<P><B>anything to hide from you. But if you decide to publish these stories
on your</B>
<P><B>page would you be so kind as to change the names of each of us? Thank

you</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first event that was witnessed and or noticed in the house happened

in</B>
<P><B>December of 1986. It was two weeks after the death of my nephew R.J.
My mom</B>
<P><B>was on her way up to the upstairs bedroom where her and my father slept.

My</B>
<P><B>father worked midnights at GM at the time. As she walked up the stairs

a</B>
<P><B>blueish white mist suddenly appeared before her on the stairway and

continued</B>
<P><B>to float in front of her as she walked up the stairs. I myself didnt
hear of</B>
<P><B>this event till a few years ago.She said the event scared her at first

but</B>
<P><B>then calmed her when she realized it wouldnt hurt her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next event has been seen by just about every member of my family
save my</B>
<P><B>father. But then again he wont admit anything about this house except</B>
<P><B>that...in his own words mind you. "I dont trust this house." But onto

the</B>
<P><B>event. Late at night on several evenings one of us had noticed a figure
out of</B>
<P><B>the corner of our eyes walk from our kitchen across the dinningroom
and into</B>
<P><B>the bathroom. The bathroom light would come on and the door would close
so we</B>
<P><B>naturally thought it was one of our family members going to the bathroom.

But</B>
<P><B>later on when nobody came out we would go check and see if they were
ok and</B>
<P><B>find the bathroom light off and nobody in there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next event I can recall hearing about from my mother was about
a large</B>
<P><B>puff of smoke eminated from the TV. while her and my oldest brother

Chester</B>
<P><B>sat watching TV late at night. The TV didnt malfunction or blow. It
stayed on</B>
<P><B>the whole time. Needless to say this event scared them both pretty

good.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A few months after these other events from what my mom tells me. The
light in</B>
<P><B>the kitchen above the sink had a plastic cover on it that would suddenly

fly</B>
<P><B>off the light and land in the center of the kitchen. We would go to
sleep at</B>
<P><B>night and the next day find the light cover laying on the floor. </B>
<P>
<P><B>This next one happend years ago when I was still a little kid. I'm
23 now. Me</B>
<P><B>and my two brothers. Herb and Kenneth were playing in our basement
one night</B>
<P><B>when I decided I was going to walk into one of the backrooms of the

basement</B>
<P><B>our parents kept as our toy room and get some Toys. As I approached

the</B>
<P><B>backroom someone ran past me. I felt the wind of the person running
past. And</B>
<P><B>I also remember exactly what the person was wearing. Blue Jeans and
a white t-</B>
<P><B>shirt. After I ran and got help we searched the basement to find nobody

there.</B>
<P><B>I didnt go into the basement for at least a month after that unless

someone</B>
<P><B>else was with me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next event I will admit has scared me on many occasions because
I cannot</B>
<P><B>explain it and at least 4 other people have seen the same thing. Late
at night</B>
<P><B>in the upstairs closet a green eye has been seen by myself, my freind

Kevin,</B>
<P><B>my brother Kenny, my freind Jeff...and just as I was writting you this
my mom</B>
<P><B>told me that my brother Chester had admitting to seeing the eye years

ago.</B>
<P><B>Nobody had ever told him that we had seen the eye either. To tell the</B>
<P><B>truth...none of us ever admitted to seeing the eye until Jeff said
he saw it</B>
<P><B>one night after a saence.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another strange thing that has happened was with Kenny's radio. He
claims that</B>
<P><B>one several occasions while he laid in bed waiting to fall asleep that

his</B>
<P><B>radio would change stations by itself.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This next event has happened many many times since we have moved into

this</B>
<P><B>house but seems to happen more and more recently. Everyone in the family

has</B>
<P><B>heard this strange and LOUD knock echo through the house. its just
one knock</B>
<P><B>but none of us can say exactly where it comes from. Some say it came
from the</B>
<P><B>upstairs bedroom door...others say it comes from the basement door.
All I know</B>
<P><B>is that its not the house settling. </B>
<P>
<P><B>This next event has happened to myself, my brother kenny and my mom.
Not until</B>
<P><B>the time of this writting did my mother admit that it happened to her
as well.</B>
<P><B>While sleeping each of us has suddenly been jolted awake by the feeling

of</B>
<P><B>someone holding us down. this feeling paralyzed us to the point we

couldnt</B>
<P><B>move let alone scream. I myself couldnt even open my eyes. I thought
I was</B>
<P><B>dying. then suddenly the feeling left as quick as it came. It happened
to me</B>
<P><B>two times and my mother twice. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The next few events that I'll tell you about have happened in the last

two</B>
<P><B>years. </B>
<P><B>One night while myself and my freind Jeff were in the upstairs bedroom

talking</B>
<P><B>to each other across the room while we tried to go to sleep something

strange</B>
<P><B>happened. I sat up to say something to him about something...and out
of the</B>
<P><B>corner of my eye I seen this white light. So I turned my head figuring
it was</B>
<P><B>my imagination. Needless to say it wasnt....there right in front of
my eyes</B>
<P><B>was the ball of bright white light flying wildly around the front room
in the</B>
<P><B>upstairs bedroom. I dont know how long it stayed there flying because
I jumped</B>
<P><B>back on the bed then ran for my life. It frightened me that much. I
must say</B>
<P><B>this event is what trully made me believe in the supernatural.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another event that happened also happened in the upstairs bedroom.
One night</B>
<P><B>as myself and my older brother herb layed in our beds trying to sleep.
I heard</B>
<P><B>two voices talking and seen the shadows of someone walking past the

closet</B>
<P><B>door (the closet light was on at the time that is how I seen the shadows)

and</B>
<P><B>I heard them say "Shh your going to wake him up" After hearing this
I thought</B>
<P><B>my brother and his freind Rob who was staying the night were sneaking

around</B>
<P><B>our room. So I went downstairs after my eyes adjusted better and

confronted</B>
<P><B>them. They were all the way down in the basement playing. Neither would

admit</B>
<P><B>that it was them. But I definatly heard something though I never heard

anyone</B>
<P><B>walk back down the stairs or open the door at the bottom of the

stairs.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next event  happened during the week my parents and brothers were
out of</B>
<P><B>town leaving me with the house by myself so I called my freind Kevin
over to</B>
<P><B>stay with me and was witnessed by him. Kevin as he layed in the

upstairs</B>
<P><B>bedroom. From what he tells me he had just layed down in one of the
beds and</B>
<P><B>was ready to go to sleep. After he closed his eyes he  heard a strange

noise.</B>
<P><B>When he opened his eyes he seen a figure at the foot of the bed. He

couldnt</B>
<P><B>tell me what it looked like, if it was a man or a woman or anything.
he could</B>
<P><B>only refer to it as a shadow. As he layed there startled he said *IT*
began to</B>
<P><B>groan and moan like it was talkign to him and suddenly thigns began

flying</B>
<P><B>across the room. I was downstairs at the time and the only thing I
heard was</B>
<P><B>him running down the stairs yelling profanities. When I went to

investigate.</B>
<P><B>Nothing was out of place and the shadwy figure was gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A day later me and Kevin were sitting in my livingroom around 4am when
out of</B>
<P><B>nowhere this ungodly groaning noise eminated from the kitchen. It lasted

a</B>
<P><B>good 30 seconds. long enough for it to startle us and for us to look
at each</B>
<P><B>other to see if we both heard the same thing. Seconds later we were
both out</B>
<P><B>of the house and down the street at the church on the corner. </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>The next events took place during a 42 hour period but the stories
are linked</B>
<P><B>together. I decided one night that me and my freinds should hold a

saence.</B>
<P><B>(stupid me) so I called a bunch of them over and we went into the

upstairs</B>
<P><B>bedroom. The group consisted of myself, Kevin, Kenny, Jeff, Richard,
and a</B>
<P><B>freind from my work named Ed. While conducting the saence we asked
for a sign</B>
<P><B>if anyone or anything was listening to us. Suddenly my freind jeff
screams out</B>
<P><B>"Ohhhh my god. The closet light just turned on by itself!!!" We all
jumped up</B>
<P><B>and turned the lights on and low and behold the closet light was turned

on</B>
<P><B>somehow. That same night was the time Jeff witnessed the Green eye
in the</B>
<P><B>Closet through a hole I had recently punched int he wall that enclosed

the</B>
<P><B>closet from the stairway. The next night...the upstairs bedroom caught

fire.</B>
<P><B>The firedepartment claims it was a cigarette that caused the fire.
but the</B>
<P><B>only people that had stayed the night before the fire was myself and

Richard</B>
<P><B>in the upstairs. Neither of us had smoked before we went to bed and
we both</B>
<P><B>got up early and left the house the next morening to go job hunting.
Later the</B>
<P><B>next day around 10pm is when we came home and approximatly 5 minutes

later</B>
<P><B>noticed the smoke. Nobody had been in the upstairs that whole day.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next event was also just told to me as I write this letter. it
is the only</B>
<P><B>event that my father will admit that he has seen. Lately he claims
that while</B>
<P><B>he lays in his bedroom trying to sleep that the touchlamp on teh desk
near the</B>
<P><B>bed turns on and off by itself. Strange.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next three events All happened just last night. I had just went

upstairs</B>
<P><B>to go to bed. As I layed down and closed my eyes I heard a faint sound
as if</B>
<P><B>it were someone whispering something. So I sat up and turned the light
on and</B>
<P><B>nobody was there. But I had this eerie feeling I was being watched
so I came</B>
<P><B>downstairs and told my brother kenny about it. He went upstairs to
check and</B>
<P><B>see if he would hear anything but didnt. The next part scared him so
bad that</B>
<P><B>he ran down the stairs and almost ran through the front door. He says
that as</B>
<P><B>he got to the landing in the middle of the upstairs stairway...both
lights in</B>
<P><B>the upstairs bedroom turned off by themselves. I never thought about
it till</B>
<P><B>now but I do recall the lights up there being on then going back up
there a</B>
<P><B>few minutes later to find them turned off. </B>
<P>
<P><B>That is the extent of what we can remember at this time. I swear to
you that</B>
<P><B>all the events that I witnessed myself are TRUE. This house scares
me at</B>
<P><B>sometimes. But at other times I always get this very strange sence
of calm.</B>
<P><B>Its weird. Well. I shall not take up any more of your time. I just
thought you</B>
<P><B>would like to hear our experiences. Thank you for your time and

patience</B>

<P>
<P><B>  My house has been noted as being haunted by a few of my town's

citizens</B>
<P><B>for the past 20 years , although i am quite sure it has been haunted

longer</B>
<P><B>than that.  I purchased it about eight years ago when the granddaughter
of the</B>
<P><B>original owner past away.  THree days later my youngest daughter came
in the</B>
<P><B>room frightened saying a woman in a long blue dress was standing at
the foot</B>
<P><B>of her sister's bed.  I passed this off at the time thinking she was

probably</B>
<P><B>dreaming or in a half sleep state.  All that changed this year.  She

still</B>
<P><B>told me stories about feeling something in the house.  I became so
worried for</B>
<P><B>her that I actually prayed that if there were ghosts in the house that

God</B>
<P><B>would let me see them so she would not be held in regard as a crazy
or weird</B>
<P><B>person for feeling that presence.  Two days later, I encountered my

first</B>
<P><B>ghost in the house.  It was a dark haired man, about average height
.  He was</B>
<P><B>standing at my bed as I slept.  When I awoke hee stayed there for about

ten</B>
<P><B>seconds and then vanished.  I could tell he meant no harm, but I was

naturally</B>
<P><B>terrified and began to understand why kim was so afraid.  Just the
thought of</B>
<P><B>that presence coming and going is very disturbing.  Just two months
ago I saw</B>
<P><B>my second ghost.  This one was in the living room at the entrance to

my</B>
<P><B>bedroom. He had possibly been there for some time.  I had been babysitting

my</B>
<P><B>two grandchildren that evening and it was about 12:20.  I  had fallen

aseep</B>
<P><B>and my oldest grandchild was on a floor cushion under a blanket asleep.

 If</B>
<P><B>that had not been a ghost, it would have walked right over him.  It

(the</B>
<P><B>ghost) was terrified of me. Funny after I mentioned being terrified
of it.  It</B>
<P><B>fought at the room divider trying to get away quickly.  I feel the
presence of</B>
<P><B>these ghosts at least 3 times a week.... I feel they are a real part
of ourr</B>
<P><B>world.  Even the bible speaks of them.  Sometimes they just want to
return to</B>
<P><B>that place they grew familiar with.  </B>

</H3><P><B>by clearwatersandi_ash@email.msn.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Our father was just like Carol O'Conner's character in "All in the
Family", Archie Bunker.  He </B>
<P><B>dressed like him, looked like him including the hair, smoked cigars,
had "his" chair no one was </B>
<P><B>allowed to sit in, was prejudice (sp?), etc.  He loved the show and
had an ash tray with a saying </B>
<P><B>from the show.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Our father was very ill with a serious heart condition.  My twin brother

and</B>
<P><B>I were the only ones still living at home,  the other three siblings

were</B>
<P><B>older and had moved out.  Our mother had died 7 years earlier of a

medical</B>
<P><B>mishap.  On our 20th birthday, Dad had open heart surgery for

quad-druple</B>
<P><B>by-pass.  He did well as first, but as time went by his color was

turning</B>
<P><B>ash gray.  He still was following doctor orders and walking everyday.

 I</B>
<P><B>applied for a car loan and needed his signature as co-signer.  He told

me</B>
<P><B>that I should get his signature now since he would not be around much</B>
<P><B>longer.  It really it me as strange and try to make light of his

comment.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On Friday, Dad had a doctor's appointment.  The doctor cleared him
to go</B>
<P><B>back to work the following Monday morning. He like working, he had
been with</B>
<P><B>his company for over 25 years.  I went out partying knowing that Dad
must be</B>
<P><B>better.  Saturday morning,  I was lazily getting ready to go to work.

 My</B>
<P><B>brother and his fiance' were at the house.  I heard them yelling at
me to</B>
<P><B>call 911.  My brother being a EMT was performing CPR on our father
with his</B>
<P><B>fiance' helping.  Paramedics took about 4 minutes to arrive.  They

really</B>
<P><B>did their best and transported our father to the emergency room.  After

the</B>
<P><B>family arrive, we were rushed to a small room inside the waiting room.

 It</B>
<P><B>was not long when the doctor came in to tell us our father had gone.

 My</B>
<P><B>brother being knowledgeable in the subject found out that his heart
had too</B>
<P><B>much pressure and blew a hole in his heart.  Medically speaking he

actually</B>
<P><B>died at the house.  It was less than 3 months after his operation and
6 days</B>
<P><B>before his 57th birthday.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Going home was hard even though all of my brothers and sister and

friends</B>
<P><B>were there now.  When we walked in the door, all the medical supplies

they</B>
<P><B>used on him were still scattered throughout the room and was an

instant</B>
<P><B>reminder.  We all were very quiet cleaned up the best we could. After

trying</B>
<P><B>to come to grip with what happened, the older siblings left to go home.

 My</B>
<P><B>twin brother and I were the only ones left.  Being emotionally drained,

we</B>
<P><B>went to bed.   About an hour later, my brother woke me.  I thought
he had</B>
<P><B>trouble sleeping,  but as soon as I gathered myself,  I felt a very

odd</B>
<P><B>sensation.  My brother stated that was what woke him up.  We stood

together</B>
<P><B>and walked down the hallway to the living room.   Our father was in

"his"</B>
<P><B>chair, just as clear and defined as if he was still alive.  My

brother</B>
<P><B>gasped, I screamed.  The figure remained as if he could not see us.
 He was</B>
<P><B>looking straight ahead as if he were watching his TV.  It was a good

minute</B>
<P><B>and a half or two minutes, and the figure slowly disappeared.  We called

out</B>
<P><B>for him, but he was gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My brother and I never talked about that again.  After the house was

sold</B>
<P><B>and the estate was settled, we all went our seperate way and did not

really</B>
<P><B>keep in contact much with each other.  My twin brother had married,
then two</B>
<P><B>boys.  The marraige was not working and my brother moved out,

eventually</B>
<P><B>getting divorced.  He was tough on himself saying it was all his fault,

the</B>
<P><B>divorce and dad's death that his CPR did not save him.  I knew then
he was</B>
<P><B>still having trouble 7 years after Dad's death.  My brother started

into</B>
<P><B>risky activities, anything that slightly dangerous, sky diving, scuba</B>
<P><B>diving, got his pilot's license, and into guns.  After a depression,
he was</B>
<P><B>Baker Acted and he faced the source of depression.  He got better and</B>
<P><B>remarried.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One time when his son's were visiting, my brother was awakened in the

middle</B>
<P><B>of the night.  He went to the living room and saw a smoke cloud or</B>
<P><B>hazecoming out of his sons' room.  He froze and could not move.  The

figure</B>
<P><B>moved away from the boy's room and disappeared.  His wife woke and
found my</B>
<P><B>brother still frozen in the same spot, sweat poring off him, but ice

cold</B>
<P><B>from fright.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Two years ago, my father's sister wanted to come down for a visit in

August.</B>
<P><B>We thought that a little strange since we lived in Florida, and they

hated</B>
<P><B>the humidity.  They brought our last grandparent with them.  Our

Mother's</B>
<P><B>Mother.  She was 87 and the trip would take a lot out of her.  It was

their</B>
<P><B>last effort to try to bring the brothers and sisters together.  We

decided</B>
<P><B>to have a picinic in the City Park in the town we grew up in, close
to the</B>
<P><B>old house.  It would be the first time since the furneral that we were

all</B>
<P><B>together in that town, 11 years after Dad's death.  We all brought

our</B>
<P><B>children and things were actually going well.  During that day we found

5</B>
<P><B>half smoke cigars in the park. (There are 5 of us.. 3 boys and 2 girls)

The</B>
<P><B>same kind that Dad smoked.  We each tried to blame the other as to
where the</B>
<P><B>cigars were coming from, but all were denying being the one.  But being

a</B>
<P><B>christian family,  we all knew that we were telling the truth.   Dad

was</B>
<P><B>there with us.</B>

<H3><A NAME=chess>The Chess Game</A>
</H3><P><B>by PPolis@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have always had a fascination with the paranormal and when I meet

someone</B>
<P><B>new, one of my standard questions is, "Have you ever had anything really

weird</B>
<P><B>happen to you?"  You would be amazed at some of the answers I've gotten

to</B>
<P><B>that question.</B>
<P><B>	Back in 1982 I was at Fort Leonardwood in Missouri for Basic Training.

 I</B>
<P><B>shared a room with seven other guys and lights out was at 8:30 p.m.

every</B>
<P><B>night.  One evening when everyone was getting ready for bed I asked

the</B>
<P><B>standard.  I got a bunch of strange looks and somebody asked, "What
do you</B>
<P><B>mean?"  I replied, "You know, like ghosts or Big Foot or UFOs; stuff

like</B>
<P><B>that?"  Most of them replied with, "No," and somebody said, "go to
sleep," so</B>
<P><B>I did.</B>
<P><B>	A few hours later I was awakened out of that sleep by Private

Wyngard.</B>
<P><B>Wyngard had the bunk closest to the door and he had waited for everyone

to</B>
<P><B>fall asleep before approaching me.  I asked, "What do you want Wyngard?"

 And</B>
<P><B>his reply startled me.  He said, "You asked that question earlier and
I waited</B>
<P><B>until everybody fell asleep to tell you because I didn't want anyone
to think</B>
<P><B>I was crazy."  This introductory statement immediately caught my attention

and</B>
<P><B>I was instantly wide awake.  I inquired, "What happened?" and he related

the</B>
<P><B>following story:</B>
<P><B>	Wyngard lived with his parents before joining the military.  As you
walk in</B>
<P><B>the front door there is a set of stairs that lead down into the basement,

and</B>
<P><B>on one side of the basement was his bedroom.  One day in the summer,

right</B>
<P><B>around twilight, he was at home by himself.  His parents were playing

bridge.</B>
<P><B>His brothers and sisters were with friends.  His friends were busy,
and there</B>
<P><B>was nothing good on TV.  He was so bored that he made up a game to

entertain</B>
<P><B>himself.  The only problem was it turned out to be more than just a

game.</B>
<P><B>	At the bottom of the stairs was a stereo rack.  On the top of the

rack</B>
<P><B>Wyngard had a chess board with the usual black and white plastic

pieces.</B>
<P><B>Wyngard's boredom led him to create an imaginary war between good and

evil,</B>
<P><B>all recreated on the chess board.  In Wyngard's mind, all of the white

pieces</B>
<P><B>represented the forces of good, while the black pieces represented
the forces</B>
<P><B>of evil.  The white king was God and the black king was the devil.</B>
<P><B>	In Wyngard's little war, the forces of evil were laying waste to the

forces</B>
<P><B>of good.  He would pick up a black piece and use it to send a white

piece</B>
<P><B>flying off the board.  Finally it got to the point where the white
king was</B>
<P><B>the only piece for good left and it was completely surrounded by the
pieces of</B>
<P><B>evil.  The coup de Gras came when he pick up the black king and lowered

it</B>
<P><B>slowly over the head of the white king. </B>
<P><B>	Just before he could complete the move, the board began shaking violently

and</B>
<P><B>in one sudden motion all of the pieces flew off the board.  At the
same time,</B>
<P><B>a blast of hot wind came screaming down the stairs, knocking Wyngard
off his</B>
<P><B>feet.  This terrified Wyngard because he always made sure the door
at the top</B>
<P><B>of the stairs was closed.  At this point he scrambled out of the house

and</B>
<P><B>waited in the front yard until his parents got home.  Then he gathered
up the</B>
<P><B>pieces and the board and threw them all away.</B>
<P><B>	Wyngard told me he also believed in ghosts because of another experience

he</B>
<P><B>had.  His grandma lived with the family but was bedridden and critically

ill.</B>
<P><B>During her life she had a favorite yellow dress that she wore that
she hadn't</B>
<P><B>been able to wear for years because of her sickness.  She eventually
died and</B>
<P><B>was buried in the dress.</B>
<P><B>	For the funeral, Wyngard's younger brother and sister weren't allowed

to</B>
<P><B>attend the services because his parents thought it might traumatize

them.</B>
<P><B>They were both young enough that they didn't really know their

grandmother</B>
<P><B>since she had been ill ever since they were born.  The night after

the</B>
<P><B>funeral, the children awoke, came to the breakfast table and stated,

"Guess</B>
<P><B>what?  Grandma came to see us last night?"  The parents replied, "How

cute?</B>
<P><B>What did she want?"  The children exclaimed, "She told us that everything

was</B>
<P><B>all right and she showed us her pretty yellow dress."</B>
<P><B>	Sometimes you don't need to experience something firsthand to feel
the truth</B>
<P><B>of it.  The look of intensity in Wyngard's eye as he shared these stories

was</B>
<P><B>a witness to me that he really believed the things he related.  There
are many</B>
<P><B>questions out there. </B>

<P>
<P><B>In the late '60s, several years before I was born, my maternal

grandmother</B>
<P><B>died of cancer. My mother and two sisters, Teresa and Ann, were all
alone at</B>
<P><B>the time, as my father was in the middle of his tour in Vietnam.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandmother, from what I've been told, was held quite dear by all
in the</B>
<P><B>family. To this day, my mother tears up whenever her name is mentioned.

My</B>
<P><B>sisters still, over 30 years after her death, speak of how nice and
sweet she</B>
<P><B>was, and how much they loved her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She had been ill for some time before she finally passed away. My mother,

of</B>
<P><B>course, was quite devastated. My sisters were also understandably quite

upset.</B>
<P><B>They were 12 and 10 years old at the time of my grandmother's death.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The night of our grandmother's death, Teresa was sent to bed by my

mother.</B>
<P><B>Hurt, devastated and confused, she lay crying. Slowly, the door to
the bedroom</B>
<P><B>opened, and our grandmother entered.</B>
<P>
<P><B>"Stop crying, Teresa," she said. "Everything will be all right. We'll
se each</B>
<P><B>other again." Then she was gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day at breakfast Teresa relayed the story to the family. Our

mother</B>
<P><B>became visibly upset, saying "Don't be silly, it was just your

imagination!"</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then Ann spoke up. "But Mom, I saw her too. She came into my bedroom
and told</B>
<P><B>me exactly the same thing!"</B>
<P>
<P><B>Both my sisters and my mother recount this story on occasion. They
all believe</B>
<P><B>that my grandmother's spirit remained for a while to comfort them after

her</B>
<P><B>death. After all, that was the just the kind of gentle soul she was.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I am a 32 year old educated female with great belief in God.   I have

always</B>
<P><B>been facinated with the super natural and somewhat sensitive to things

its</B>
<P><B>this nature.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>About six years ago on Christmas Eve my Uncle commited suicide.  This

was</B>
<P><B>after years of drug addiction and emotional (mental) problems.  I was

always</B>
<P><B>been close to my Uncle and happened to be the last person he spoke
to prior to</B>
<P><B>his final act.  When I spoke to him he "hinted" at his intentions.
 I did not</B>
<P><B>react to this because he had done this before as a means of seeking

attention.</B>
<P><B>He was in Orlando and my entire family was in Miami for the holiday.
 I didn't</B>
<P><B>inform anyone of his tone because I felt we was just trying to, again,

ruin</B>
<P><B>the holiday.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Grandfather returned to Orlando approximately two days after Christmas

and</B>
<P><B>found Michael.  He had left a note advising his burial wishes and

requesting</B>
<P><B>prayer from the family.  He removed all his jewlery, drank enough alcohol

to</B>
<P><B>thin the blood, turned the heater on in the bathroom (again to thin
the blood)</B>
<P><B>and slit his wrists.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I got the phone call from my Aunt, she didn't even have to tell
me what</B>
<P><B>happened.  I knew.  I was devistated at the fact that he was gone and
I had</B>
<P><B>done nothing to prevent it.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>In the following months I had many strange events take place.  It started

by a</B>
<P><B>wiccan witch at my work repeatedly giving me "messages" from my uncle.
 I then</B>
<P><B>started having dreams where my uncle would be speaking to me.  In general

I</B>
<P><B>would write this off to the stress caused by his death, but he was
telling me</B>
<P><B>things that I would have no knowledge of.  I was able to verify all
of the</B>
<P><B>information he had given me during the waking hours.  To give you one

example,</B>
<P><B>in one of the dreams he, in a very distressed tone, was telling me
he had to</B>
<P><B>get in touch with Julie.  I thought it strange when I woke up because
I had no</B>
<P><B>knowledge of any Julie.  It was so realistic that I called my Grandmother

who</B>
<P><B>informed me that Julie was his AA spouncer who he would speak to when
ever he</B>
<P><B>was depressed or suicidal.  She went on to advise me that Michael had
tried to</B>
<P><B>contact Julie the night of his death but she was unavailable.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I began searching for guidence from churches.  I finally found a church

that</B>
<P><B>was able to assist me.  I spoke to the Pastor about the recent events.

 He</B>
<P><B>advised me that this was a very bad situation and requested that a
group of</B>
<P><B>church memebers be aloud to pray for me.  I agreed.  As they were praying

for</B>
<P><B>me I started to feel........well uncomfortable isn't a strong enough
word.  I</B>
<P><B>started to feel as if I may throw up.  I told the Pastor I needed to
leave to</B>
<P><B>use the restroom.  He advised me that I needed to let go of my Uncle.
 Now as</B>
<P><B>a rational person this seems like a small reasonable request.  As I
think back</B>
<P><B>on it I am amazed at my reaction.  I almost got violent.  I went into</B>
<P><B>hysterics, crying, panicing, rocking back and forth..... I did vomit
at this</B>
<P><B>point.  I began to understand that I was dealing this something too
big for me</B>
<P><B>to handle alone.  I held my breath and used every ounce of energy I
could call</B>
<P><B>upon and said I let Michael go and that I didn't want him around any
more.  My</B>
<P><B>first reaction was a feeling that I had betrayed a family member....
but then</B>
<P><B>I saw it.  This grotesque black.... mass leaving my body.  It was like

pure</B>
<P><B>evil.    I was in shock.   It spead away and left the room.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I felt so much better.  I knew that thing was not any part of my

Uncle.</B>
<P><B>Because of my facination with the super natural I knew what it was.
 It was a</B>
<P><B>familiar spirit.  (I am assuming that you are aware of the term)  It

made</B>
<P><B>perfect sence.  Its like if something were watching our entire lives,
like a</B>
<P><B>movie, it would be aware of every move we had ever made.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Through my desparation to understand my Uncles action on Christmas
Eve, I had</B>
<P><B>inadvertently began "speaking" to him, asking why he had done this.
 I opened</B>
<P><B>myself up to this ugly spirit that was full aware of all his action
during his</B>
<P><B>life time.  This spirit had pretended to be my Uncle that I wanted
so much to</B>
<P><B>speak to.  In the mean time, while I was running around trying to find

answers</B>
<P><B>to what was going on I was distracted from what I was supose to be
doing in my</B>
<P><B>life, my children, family and God.  It accomplished what it had set
out to do.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I truly believe that the world we live in and the spiritual relm do

intersect</B>
<P><B>at times.  I do not believe that we contact spirits of long gone loved
ones or</B>
<P><B>souls that once inhabited our relm.  Rather, spirits that have always

existed</B>
<P><B>in the other relm and have their own reason for misguiding or distracting

us</B>
<P><B>from our own lives.  These spirits can be very convincing players,

especially</B>
<P><B>to a willing audience.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I wish you the best of luck in your life and pray that the Holy Spirit

will</B>
<P><B>protect and guide you in your works.  I also pray that God will give

you</B>
<P><B>wisdom and discernment to truly see what you are dealing with.</B>

<P><B>in Grandma's bedroom.  My great-uncle Emil used to smoke rum and maple
in his</B>
<P><B>pipe.  Grandma believes that he watches over her.  I never knew Uncle
Emil (he</B>
<P><B>died long before I was born) but for some reason he seemed to have
a special</B>
<P><B>affinity for me, especially after I met my now ex-fiance.  Brian my</B>
<P><B>grandmother's back bedroom and the whole time he was there, I always

smelled</B>
<P><B>Uncle Emil in that room--especially in the adjoining bathroom, close
to the</B>
<P><B>toilet.  Or he would "hang out" near my grandma's standing lamp in
the living</B>
<P><B>room which was right next to Brian's bedroom door.  I don't think Uncle

Emil</B>
<P><B>liked him very much--Brian was not exactly the nicest person in the

world.</B>
<P><B>When we were together I would "smell" Uncle Emil almost daily, especially

if</B>
<P><B>Brian and I happened to be in the bedroom.  But since he and I split
up, I</B>
<P><B>almost never smell him anymore.  I'm not the only one to have

encountered</B>
<P><B>Uncle Emil, either.  My grandma senses him all the time, and he's even
been to</B>
<P><B>my parents house.  But I don't think anyone has "smelled" him since

Brian</B>
<P><B>left.  It makes me think that he was watching out for me while I was

with</B>
<P><B>Brian, because he knew what kind of person he was, and now that he's
out of my</B>
<P><B>life, he doesn't have to anymore.  I think he's still around though,
he just</B>
<P><B>doesn't feel that it's necessary to make himself known.  It makes me
feel good</B>
<P><B>knowing that he's out there, watching over me.</B>

<P>
<P><B>   There is an experience I want to share with all of you other paranormal

people, and also for those of you facing life after the recent death of a
loved one.  There is hope.  My father passed away on August 28th, 1998. 
We were devastated by his loss, even though we were somewhat prepared for
it.  He always had a strong belief and faith in God and the Heavenly realms,
but he also said that he would never leave us.  As far as we know, he hasn't.
 A month after his death, my mother was sitting on the front porch, facing
the window into the dining room of our home.  The light from the kitchen
was behind it.  Suddenly, she saw a shadow cross the light in the dining
room.  It looked a lot like my father had before his death.  Needless to
say, she was upset, but she didn't tell me, for fear I would be upset as
well.  A few nights later, a friend of mine was sitting in the same chair,
and saw a shadow crossing  the porch.  It looked like a person.  A month
after that, I was sitting in the same seat and saw my father stand up and
walk into the dining room, but his shadow never crossed the light in front
of the kitchen.  I told my mother about this, and she was relieved and somewhat

afraid that she was not the only one.  I want to believe that my father made
it to Heaven, but it is rather a relief to know that he wants to remain here
with his family as well. </B>

</H3><P><B>by:  lefevre@mail1.facile.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>The only thing that scares me is true evil, </B>
<P><B>nothing else. You can feel it. Sometimes, I lay in bed, thinking </B>
<P><B>about things, only to have my mind wander into something that strikes
</B>
<P><B>fear. I have had multiple experiences, some dream, some real. I </B>
<P><B>think the first experience I had with poltergeists (I guess that's
what you'd </B>
<P><B>call it) was in a dream. There was a lot of stress in my life, I was
in </B>
<P><B>the 8th grade. My grandpa used to own a duplex, which we now own. </B>
<P><B>The first time I saw the place, I refused to go inside...the place
gave me the </B>
<P><B>creeps. One night, maybe a few months to a year after living there,
I had </B>
<P><B>a dream. Most landscapes and scenery are not recreated realistically
in </B>
<P><B>dreams, but in my dream, I thought I was awake. I heard a small stomping,
</B>
<P><B>starting on the second floor, moving down, growing louder as it got
closer, and </B>
<P><B>a voice said something to me which I do not recall...I got out of bed
and went </B>
<P><B>to the bottom of the stairs where I could feel something at the top.
I </B>
<P><B>could not see it, it was invisible. It was a feeling. It screamed at
</B>
<P><B>me and ran into me, at which point I woke up and turned on the </B>
<P><B>lights.</B>
<P><B>Several other occurances like this happened, not </B>
<P><B>too frequently, but throughout the years. One while I was in high school,
</B>
<P><B>very similar to the previously described, but this time in my grandparents
</B>
<P><B>house. But the one that stands out in my mind the most was in the house
we </B>
<P><B>are now living in. I had gone into a deep depression and </B>
<P><B>self-hatred. One night I had a dream. My dad stood over me as I lay
</B>
<P><B>in bed. He didn't seem to be like my dad though...he had strange </B>
<P><B>intents. He reached into me, rummaging wrist-deep into my guts. It
</B>
<P><B>was as if he were a ghost. But when I awoke, I was somehow frozen.
I </B>
<P><B>could not move or speak. a black, hooded figure stood over me, wrist-deep
</B>
<P><B>in my guts, as my father in the dream. Upon noticing me, it stared
at me, </B>
<P><B>moved back slowly...nodded it's head from side to side, and then faded
</B>
<P><B>away. The event was very real, I knew I was no longer dreaming. I </B>
<P><B>turned on my lights and refused to be alone.</B>
<P><B>The most recent occurence was when I was having </B>
<P><B>trouble believing in God. One night, after trying to deny the existance
</B>
<P><B>thereof, I had a dream. It was realistically recreated as in the other
</B>
<P><B>dreams, and similar in structure. I found myself in bed (which is not
too </B>
<P><B>far from the my closet in front of it) and I sat up. The room was dark,
</B>
<P><B>and suddenly filled with a hateful presence that heightened. Suddenly,
my </B>
<P><B>closet doors burst open, and a rush came toward me. The best way to
</B>
<P><B>visually describe the rush was a distortion similar to what the invisible
</B>
<P><B>Predator looks like. It dived out of the closet onto my body, forcing
it's </B>
<P><B>way into my body. It made it halfway into my body, unable to force
out my </B>
<P><B>unwilling soul. I cried to God and confessed my belief and sorrow,
at </B>
<P><B>which point it left, I awoke, and slept with a copy of the bible next
to my bed </B>
<P><B>with the lights on. I'm not a better Christian after having this happen
to </B>
<P><B>me, maybe a lot of you think I should be. But after resolving troubles
in </B>
<P><B>my life, I have not had these problems. I have learned to avoid things
</B>
<P><B>that are evil, though I am not perfect.The thing that makes me know
that </B>
<P><B>evil is real, is that I've seen it. My advice: Don't let anyone tell
</B>
<P><B>you what to believe in, or what to do. If it makes you feel evil, or
</B>
<P><B>uncomfortable, avoid it. Everyone has a </B>
<P><B>conscience.</B>

<P>
<P><B>In May of 1995, my fiance was driving home to Pontiac, Michigan.  She
had</B>
<P><B>recently moved into a new apartment and was not familiar with the area.
 She</B>
<P><B>took a wrong turn and was going the wrong way on a one way street.
 Before she</B>
<P><B>quickly turned around, she noticed a dog walking across the street.
 She</B>
<P><B>pulled over and discovered a poodle that was very dirty and obviously
very</B>
<P><B>hungry.  She took the dog home and discovered that his owner just didn't
want</B>
<P><B>him anymore.  We adopted him and we became inseparable.  At the time
my fiance</B>
<P><B>found the poodle, he was already 12 years old.  He was found on a
street</B>
<P><B>called "Widetrack" so we named him Widetrack.  </B>
<P><B>Widetrack lived very happily with us for 3 1/2 years.  Because of the
many</B>
<P><B>years of neglect he suffered, by the time he was 15 years old, he began
to</B>
<P><B>have strokes and died in my arms in August 1997.  We buried him in
a pet</B>
<P><B>cemetary a few miles from our home.  Because he lived to be an old
dog,</B>
<P><B>Widetrack walked slowly.  You could hear his toe nails click on the
linoleum</B>
<P><B>floor of our kitchen floor.  On certain days, in the late afternoon,
his toe</B>
<P><B>nails can still be distinctly heard on the kitchen floor.  Widetrack
had a</B>
<P><B>habit of pushing his head up under my legs when I was sitting down
to let me</B>
<P><B>know he was there and wanted to be picked up to be next to me.  At
times I can</B>
<P><B>feel a knudge under my legs as if he is still around.  Widetrack would
curl up</B>
<P><B>with me on the couch and I would put my arm around him.  At times I
will wake</B>
<P><B>up from a deep sleep as I feel his body next to mine.  At times I can
hear him</B>
<P><B>breathing as if he is sleeping next to me on the couch.  It seems
that</B>
<P><B>"Widetrack" finally found the love he was looking for in our house
that had</B>
<P><B>eluded him for the first 12 years of his life.  Since he lived with
us for</B>
<P><B>only 3 1/2 years, it seems he was not ready to go yet and is still
enjoying</B>
<P><B>the love and comfort of our home.  I hope he stays for a long time.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME="the shadow">The Shadow Figure</A></B>
</H3><P>
<P><B>by: Sidekx@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was a teenager (about ten years ago) I had a friend who lived
in a</B>
<P><B>strange house. All sorts of weird things happened there and his whole
family</B>
<P><B>felt the house was haunted. I experienced a few too many occurences
there and</B>
<P><B>needless to say I believe now. Everything from seeing shadows, to
footsteps,</B>
<P><B>doors slamming, washing machines going on by themselves, you name it.
I know</B>
<P><B>alot can be explained but I don't think there's an answer for this.
My friend</B>
<P><B>and I were working out in his basement one winter night. We had the
stereo on</B>
<P><B>in the other room and the volume went down by itself. We went and turned
it up</B>
<P><B>but  something turned it down again and again. I'd normally say the
stereo was</B>
<P><B>defective but you have to turn a knob for the volume. It was turned.
Anyway,</B>
<P><B>after a while we heard footsteps run up the stairs, a door slammed
then ran up</B>
<P><B>the stairs above to the second floor, and another door slammed. We
checked it out,</B>
<P><B>no one was home. I left and had to walk three streets or so away to
my house.</B>
<P><B>As I left his backyard I looked back to see his back light go off and
on. I</B>
<P><B>was about 300 ft. away now and could see a dark shadow like figure
standing</B>
<P><B>there as the light went off and on. It had no face really, just the
outline of</B>
<P><B>a body and all black. Finally the light went off, and it started to
walk</B>
<P><B>towards me. I have to tell you that the switch for the light was inside.
I got</B>
<P><B>a little nervous and kept walking, faster, and faster. Now it was running
real</B>
<P><B>fast. I booked it, slipped and fell on the ice. I could hear it coming
so I</B>
<P><B>just got up and ran. I didn't look back, ran through a yard, hopped
a brook</B>
<P><B>and ran home. I got home and no one was there. I thought now I'm in
trouble.</B>
<P><B>But whatever it was left me in the yard by the brook. I immediately
called my</B>
<P><B>friend, thinking it was him and he wouldn't be home yet. He answered.
I asked</B>
<P><B>how he got home so fast? There was no way it could've been him. The
next day I</B>
<P><B>looked and saw footprints in the snow following mine to the brook,
they</B>
<P><B>departed and headed towards the swamp through another yard. The next
night I</B>
<P><B>was working out in another friend's basement. This house was next door
to the</B>
<P><B>one I was in the night before. We heard a BOOM on the bulkhead, then
I saw the</B>
<P><B>same figure in the basement window. I then told my friend what happened
the</B>
<P><B>night before. I left his house and the figure popped out from behind
the house</B>
<P><B>and just ran full force. I got home safely again, this time running
a</B>
<P><B>different way.The thing that gets me was this thing was fast, almost
too fast</B>
<P><B>to be human. I think it could've caught me but it seems it just didn't
want me</B>
<P><B>there. It scared the heck out of me and I'll never forget it.</B>

</H3><P><B>by:  pits@sgi.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>While I was working security for a local firm in Pittsburgh for most
of</B>
<P><B>last year and the year before I was posted at a hospital in Kennedy
Township.</B>
<P><B>This hospital was on a hill just south of the city and had a
spectacular</B>
<P><B>view of the Golden Triangle from many floors and the roof. But behind</B>
<P><B>the hustle of a working hospital was a few forgotten secrets that
popped</B>
<P><B>up now and then especially for me.</B>
<P><B> I remember the first time I had arun in with the supernatural. It
was about </B>
<P><B>three thirty in the morning</B>
<P><B>and I was on one of my usual security rounds. I was near the old</B>
<P><B>I.C.U. in a wing of the hospital that was very much unused. I checked</B>
<P><B>the doors as I went down the hall and found them all to be locked.</B>
<P><B>As I rounded the corner and headed for the main hallway, I distinctly
heard</B>
<P><B>a door shut and two people talking very quietly to each other and
then</B>
<P><B>another door opened and shut and there was silence.I was shocked</B>
<P><B>to think that someone had slipped past me in a well light hallway and
that</B>
<P><B>I had mistaken a locked door for an open one was ridiculous. So I</B>
<P><B>went back to check the hall and the hair on the back of my neck stood
up</B>
<P><B>and I felt that I was being watched from all sides.&amp;nbsp; I lost
my courage</B>
<P><B>and hightailed it to the doors out of there and didn't look back till
I</B>
<P><B>was in my office.I never did find out what it was that made the</B>
<P><B>noise nor did I care.</B>
<P><B> The second time was in the school</B>
<P><B>of nursing that was affiliated with the hospital and right across
from</B>
<P><B>the main building. It was about five in the morning and I was opening</B>
<P><B>the doors for the morning when I saw a light that hadn't been on all
night</B>
<P><B>on the third floor. I went upstairs to turn it off and while I was</B>
<P><B>going up the steps I could have swore I heard whispering in the
stairwells.</B>
<P><B>I shook it off as nothing and started down the hall and as I got
about</B>
<P><B>halfway down the light went out and the door slammed shut. When that</B>
<P><B>happened I stopped cold in my tracks and started to freak. Then one</B>
<P><B>by one the rest of the doors from the far end of the hall began to
slam</B>
<P><B>shut. I again turned tail and ran as fast as I could out of the
building.</B>
<P><B>I got to the bottom and ran into the night maintenance man and told
him</B>
<P><B>what happened. Together we went up and checked the third floor.</B>
<P><B>The building was a convent before it's conversion to a school of
nursing</B>
<P><B>and the top floor was odd because it was empty now and yet had shower
rooms</B>
<P><B>in it that were stacked with old files and such. The old cells were</B>
<P><B>wall to wall with the same. Most of them had no light bulbs in them</B>
<P><B>and we found that all the doors were shut. But what was odd was the</B>
<P><B>rooms at the end where the slamming started had no doors to speak of
at</B>
<P><B>all. When we got to the room that I saw the light on in I was nervous</B>
<P><B>as heck. It to had no door or light bulb. The air felt electric</B>
<P><B>and the smell of rotten eggs was weak but noticeable but just as soon
as</B>
<P><B>we noticed it, then it was gone.I chalked that experience up to sleep</B>
<P><B>depravation and never thought of it again. About two weeks later</B>
<P><B>I was performing the same task and was again at the school of
nursing.</B>
<P><B>I had already opened all the other doors and was going to cut through
the</B>
<P><B>building to get the last door. Now as before I was the only one with</B>
<P><B>the key for this building and I knew that the doors were locked from
the</B>
<P><B>previous shift. There was again no way for anyone to be in the
building.</B>
<P><B>As I fumbled with the keys and unlocked the first door I had to go
through</B>
<P><B>the same stairwell that I had heard the whispering in before to get
to</B>
<P><B>the last door. I was just in the door and in the foyer when I heard</B>
<P><B>a laugh that made my bones begin to shake. It was deep and almost</B>
<P><B>menical sounding. I stood there and got enough bravery to look down</B>
<P><B>the hall to see that there was nothing there but the sound of
laughter.</B>
<P><B>I backed slowly out of the building and went around the side to get
the</B>
<P><B>last door from the outside. from that time on I did not enter the</B>
<P><B>building unless it was a dire emergency.</B>
<P><B>My last encounter was a little amusing.</B>
<P><B>It was towards the end of my tour at the hospital in January of '98.</B>
<P><B>I was walking around whistling a favorite tune of mine when I forgot
the</B>
<P><B>rhythm. I couldn't seem to get the notes right when all of the sudden</B>
<P><B>I heard it like someone was standing right behind me. They whistled</B>
<P><B>the right set of notes and I picked it up from there like nothing
happened</B>
<P><B>as I went to get a cup of coffee and was leaving the hall this
happened</B>
<P><B>in I said thanks for the help and I felt a reassuring, gentle tap on
my</B>
<P><B>shoulder as if whatever it was, I think it was trying to say your
welcome.</B>
<P><B> Believe it or not, all of this is</B>
<P><B>true and I would bet my money on it that if you go yourself you might
just</B>
<P><B>see what I'm talking about. for those of you in the Pittsburgh area</B>

</H3><P><B>by:  Balior@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Hello everyone,</B>
<P><B>	 I've been reading the stories at this page for a while now and finally
got</B>
<P><B>up enough nerve to tell you about a few of mine.  I live in a haunted
house in</B>
<P><B>the South Side of Chicago.  The house is about 110 years old and has
been in</B>
<P><B>my family since it was built.  Let me give you a bit of info on the
layout, so</B>
<P><B>you can get a better idea of what I'm talking about.</B>
<P><B>	The First floor was a neighborhood tavern and hall from about 1890
until</B>
<P><B>1945, The second floor is the apartment where My Great-grandparents
lived.</B>
<P><B>The tavern still has the old Bar and most of the old fixtures intact.</B>
<P><B>Basically it's now become a place where me and my friends hang out
have</B>
<P><B>parties etc. That's the first story.  First of all we have multiple
ghosts</B>
<P><B>that we know of; My Grandparents, Great-grandparents, Aunts, Cousins
and a few</B>
<P><B>other assorted ones that we haven't figured out why they're here yet.
 any</B>
<P><B>way, on with the story, it seems (according to family tales) that the
bar was</B>
<P><B>very active during the 20's, the prohibition years,  seems the place
never got</B>
<P><B>raided,  and it also seems that the parties from then haven't stopped.
 Every</B>
<P><B>so often, if I'm falling asleep down here, I'll begin to hear laughter,
music,</B>
<P><B>the sounds of glasses and bottles being moved and used, things like
that, Some</B>
<P><B>friends of mine have even reported having seen a party going on reflected
in</B>
<P><B>the mirrored part of the back bar, all in the clothes of the 20's and
30's. It</B>
<P><B>seems these spirits even party with us at times, me and a lot of my
friends</B>
<P><B>like the music of that time period, and there have been sightings of
couples</B>
<P><B>on the dance floor.  Pictures seem to smile back at people, and voices
and</B>
<P><B>cold spots are common.  Plus the first floor kitchen (the one that
used to</B>
<P><B>serve the hall) never gets warm, It will be ninety degrees outside,
but about</B>
<P><B>forty in there.  Not only that, but it seems that people that have
gotten</B>
<P><B>under the "family's' skin find it hard to enter the house again, much
less</B>
<P><B>stay there.  the funny thing is, since I'm told I'm an exact likeness
of My</B>
<P><B>Grandfather I keep getting asked why I was standing in a spot and
watching</B>
<P><B>that person, Usually when this happens, I'm upstairs or even outside,
I guess</B>
<P><B>its just my grandfather playing tricks... </B>
<P><B>Well, this tale has gone on long enough, I'd be happy to share more
of the</B>
<P><B>stories with you so, Please E-mail me at Balior@aol.com if you want
to hear</B>

</H3><P><B>by: Anonymous</B>
<P>
<P><B>I wanted to send you a quick summary of a very strange experience I
had. </B>
<P><B>I don't know if it's exactly the same as a ghost, but about a year
after </B>
<P><B>this happened to me, I stumbled onto a possible answer on the Internet.
</B>
<P><B>Here it goes:</B>
<P>
<P><B>Almost two years ago, I was going into my first semester of graduate
</B>
<P><B>school. As it was a small, private college, they weren't quite yet
set </B>
<P><B>up on the web to do web-based registration - new incoming students
had </B>
<P><B>to go to their advisor's office to turn in their schedule plan. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I had worked hard to get into graduate school and was very excited
about </B>
<P><B>the upcoming semester. I planned my schedule out carefully and had
it </B>
<P><B>all ready to go.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We had a window of one week in which to go to the advisor's office
to </B>
<P><B>get classes. No appointments, just windows of time each day.  I reported
</B>
<P><B>to the University after work on the second day of the week and headed
to </B>
<P><B>the office of the advisor listed in my acceptance letter.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I got there, I knocked on the door and was cheerfully told to
come </B>
<P><B>in. I walked in and held out my hand for a handshake to introduce </B>
<P><B>myself.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The advisor looked befuddled for a second, then took my hand. </B>
<P><B>I said hello and introduced myself. Her face wrinkled up a bit, and
she </B>
<P><B>said politely, "Yes, I remember."</B>
<P><B>I said, "You remember? I'm a new student, I haven't been here yet."</B>
<P><B>She looked very confused now. "Well, you were in here yesterday </B>
<P><B>registering for class."</B>
<P><B>I told her that I hadn't been there because I'd had a schedule conflict
</B>
<P><B>the day before; this was the first day I was able to make it. I assured
</B>
<P><B>her I hadn't been there. </B>
<P><B>She appeared to be getting a little exasperated. She began to describe
</B>
<P><B>the outfit I was wearing - very significant to her because none of
the </B>
<P><B>other students came in wearing formal business suits. (I already had
a </B>
<P><B>professional job and wore business suits every day.) She had even </B>
<P><B>commented on how nice the black suit was, and how she was glad she
</B>
<P><B>didn't have to wear expensive suits to work like I did. </B>
<P><B>She was beginning to scare me. I repeated that I hadn't ever been there
</B>
<P><B>before. </B>
<P><B>She conceded, and I sat down.</B>
<P><B>She asked for clarification on the spelling of my last name, and opened
</B>
<P><B>her filing cabinet. She pulled out a manila file from her incoming
</B>
<P><B>student files and placed it on the desk. </B>
<P><B>She asked for my class requests and I handed them over.</B>
<P><B>She opened my file and, after a few moments, looked up and said I was
</B>
<P><B>already registered.</B>
<P><B>I told her that was impossible. There was no phone or web registration
</B>
<P><B>yet and I hadn't been to see the advisor until that very day. They
</B>
<P><B>couldn't possibly have known my class choices. This was getting very,
</B>
<P><B>very weird. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Rather than make a scene, I fumbled around and told her I must have
been </B>
<P><B>mistaken, maybe I was just stressed out, etc. I'm sure she considers
me </B>
<P><B>a very strange bird, indeed. As it is a fairly small campus, I've seen
</B>
<P><B>her around several times, and she never talks to me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To wrap this up, while I was surfing the internet a few months ago,
I </B>
<P><B>was casually wandering around some "paranormal" websites and saw </B>
<P><B>something mentioned that made me feel dizzy and frightened.</B>
<P><B>The website spoke of something called a "psychic forerunner", or a
</B>
<P><B>"Vardogr". This apparition is the exact psychic double of its </B>
<P><B>flesh-and-blood counterpart, and may sometimes precede the person who
is </B>
<P><B>planning on going somewhere that they may be looking forward to going
</B>
<P><B>to. The website said that they weren't considered dangerous,  or </B>
<P><B>frightening, just odd.  Well, it sure frightened me. To this day, I
</B>
<P><B>can't explain how I went and got myself registered for classes the
day </B>
<P><B>before I physically went there. It hasn't happened again, but once
was </B>
<P><B>enough to really scare me. </B>

<P>
<P><B>This happened to my sister in 1973 in an old district of Baltimore
near</B>
<P><B>the Maryland College of Art. She would be too embarrassed to write
you</B>
<P><B>but I will. I will state here strongly that she did not use drugs or</B>
<P><B>drink! </B>
<P><B>   She was in her apartment - in an old brick building- one evening.
She</B>
<P><B>decided to go into the living room,and walked up the hall. She ran</B>
<P><B>"into" something - could not get past it - but it was invisible. She
was</B>
<P><B>terrified. She tells me that something told her it was enormous,</B>
<P><B>cylindrical in shape and penetraed not just her apartment. She turned</B>
<P><B>and fled to her bedroom where she cowered for a long time. Eventually</B>
<P><B>she came out and the thing - whatever it was- was gone. She asked</B>
<P><B>neighbors if anyone else had had odd experiences but they denied it.
My</B>
<P><B>sister is totally sane.</B>

</H3><P><B>by Chomboman@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a highschool senior now and reading the stories on this website
brought</B>
<P><B>back the memory of an incident that I experienced when I was in eighth
grade.</B>
<P><B>I was at a sleep over at a friends house, there were about five of
us spending</B>
<P><B>the night at one friends house.  At one point in the party we played
hide and</B>
<P><B>go seek.  My best friend Al (not his real name) and I were hiding in
the only</B>
<P><B>unfurnished room in the house, it was about three o'clock in the
afternoon.</B>
<P><B>We were in the room hiding in a corner and out of no where we both
got</B>
<P><B>extremely cold, unusual because the heat was at full blast in the house
and</B>
<P><B>everyone else was sweating.  Alvin and I looked at each other and then
heard a</B>
<P><B>very deep and scary growl, like something was growling in my ear something
not</B>
<P><B>human or animal.  Both of us ran out of the room and found the rest
of our</B>
<P><B>friends.  The friend who lived in the house believed us, he said no
one else</B>
<P><B>in his family wanted to live in that room because strange things
happened,</B>
<P><B>that's why it was unfurnished.  Just to be sure it wasn't my
imagination,</B>
<P><B>Alvin and I went outside to see if there were any animals that may
have made</B>
<P><B>the sound, but the only animal in sight was an old cat who was confined
to the</B>
<P><B>garage the whole afternoon and could not have possibly made the noise.
 All of</B>
<P><B>us spent the night on the first floor rather than take our chances
of running</B>
<P><B>into something on the second floor where the unfurnished room was.
 On other</B>
<P><B>visits to that house, my friend, a Muslim told me that that was the
only room</B>
<P><B>without a religious symbol in it.  Muslims don't have crosses or
crucifixes,</B>
<P><B>but some do put up plaques with phrases from the Koran written on them
in</B>
<P><B>Arabic.  That was the first experience I had.  The second happened
in 1997,</B>
<P><B>when I was a junior in high school.  There are rumors that the school
is</B>
<P><B>haunted by everything from a former student to a Native American who
died</B>
<P><B>there when California belonged to Spain, some of the teachers and
custodial</B>
<P><B>staff have had experiences and most believe there is a presence in
the school</B>
<P><B>but no one is sure of what it is.  One, day after correcting papers
after</B>
<P><B>school for the head of the Math Department, to earn service hours I
began to</B>
<P><B>lock up his office.  He told me all I had to do was  turn off the</B>
<P><B>lights, lock the door and close it.  He had left me his keys and I
began</B>
<P><B>closing up, leaving the papers I corrected in a very neat pile on his
desk.  I</B>
<P><B>did everything like he asked me to and closed the door and walked to
my</B>
<P><B>locker, which was directly across the hall from the Math Department
office.  I</B>
<P><B>gathered up my belongings and then as I turned around, got the same
cold</B>
<P><B>feeling I did in eighth grade.  I saw through the glass part of the
door that</B>
<P><B>the lights were on and the papers I had corrected and left in a neat
pile were</B>
<P><B>spread all over the desk, like someone had flung them very roughly.
 I checked</B>
<P><B>the door and it was locked.  There was another way into the office,
from an</B>
<P><B>adjacent classroom but it was locked.  I inspected the hall quickly
and the</B>
<P><B>custodians were no where near the office and I would have heard them
if they</B>
<P><B>opened the door because I was at my locker which faces the office.
 I looked</B>
<P><B>again and the lights were still on...at this point I heard the same
kind of</B>
<P><B>growl that I had heard so many years before.  I just turned and walked
down</B>
<P><B>the hallway to the nearest exit, as fast as I could.  The next day
I talked to</B>
<P><B>the head of the math department and told him what had happened the
day before.</B>
<P><B>He believed me and told me that the same thing had happened to him
a year ago.</B>
<P><B>I don't know if the two incidents are connected but if anyone can shed
some</B>
<P><B>light on the subject please email me, Chomboman@aol.com.  Thank You</B>

<P>
<P><B>OK here's my story. It all started when I was about 6, my little sister
</B>
<P><B>was about two. At this time my parents were still together. My little
</B>
<P><B>sister and I shared a room, our bed was just below the window, it was
a </B>
<P><B>full sized bed. Every night I would have a nightmare, never the same
</B>
<P><B>one, but I would wake terrified and I's get my teddy bear and go sleep
</B>
<P><B>in my parents bed. Well one night I had a dream that I being chased
by a </B>
<P><B>man with a blurred face. He was tall about 6 foot, that's huge when
your </B>
<P><B>only 6. He was wearing a hat and he had a deformed right hand, his
</B>
<P><B>fingers were very long, thin and sharp. He chased me down an unfamiliar
</B>
<P><B>street to a dead end. I turned around and there he was lifting his
</B>
<P><B>hidious hand as if he was going to slash my face. He said in a crusty
</B>
<P><B>voice "Poor innocent child, didn't do a thing and now she will..."
Then </B>
<P><B>I woke up suddenly terrified. I looked around the room it was dark
and </B>
<P><B>my sister was laying asleep. I grabbed my teddy and dashed down the
hall </B>
<P><B>into my parents room. I screamed "daddy daddy I had a bad dream!" so
he </B>
<P><B>scooted over and let me crawl into bed between him and my mom. I </B>
<P><B>couldn't go back to sleep in fear that man would come back. So I laid
</B>
<P><B>there and starred at the hall closet, cause I could see light reflecting
</B>
<P><B>off it that was coming from my room. I started to doze off when I saw
a </B>
<P><B>shadow on the closet coming from my room. It was a tall shadow with
a </B>
<P><B>hat and a deformed right hand. I sank into the bed saying "daddy daddy
</B>
<P><B>wake up that mans in my room he's going to hurt Lindsay! DADDY!! WAKE
UP </B>
<P><B>MOMMY!!" my dad just muttered it just a shadow of your teddy bear.
Then </B>
<P><B>I looked at where my teddy was and he was gone. I looked back up at
the </B>
<P><B>shadow, and my dad was right it was now a shadow of my teddy  bear.
I </B>
<P><B>distinctly remember grabbing him when I ran out of my room. For the
next </B>
<P><B>few years nothing strange happened and I totaly forgot that night as
if </B>
<P><B>it never happened. Then when I was about 11, my sister was 7, we still
</B>
<P><B>lived in that house and my sister and I still shared that room, except
</B>
<P><B>now we had separate beds. mine was by the wall and hers by the door.
One </B>
<P><B>night she went to her friends house, and I was alone in the room. I
was </B>
<P><B>halfway asleep and rolled over because I was uncomfortable, and i saw
a </B>
<P><B>small white figure by my sisters bed, at first I thought it was my
</B>
<P><B>sister and I said "Go to bed!" then I realized she wasn't home. I was
</B>
<P><B>fully awake now and I looked at it and it put it's hand out as if it
</B>
<P><B>wanted me to hold it's hand I screamed "DAD!!" as he walked in the
door </B>
<P><B>it vanished started with it's feet. Then about 6 months later in the
</B>
<P><B>winter time and I begged my dad to let my cat, who've we had for about
9 </B>
<P><B>years, in the house. He was sweet natured cat who would never hurt
a fly </B>
<P><B>let alone me, the one who spoiled him rotten. Well that night he slept
</B>
<P><B>with me on our new bunck beds on the top. It was about 1:00 in the
</B>
<P><B>morning when my cat woke me up, he was sitting on my face suffacating
</B>
<P><B>me. I pushed him off and he started hissing at me. I looked and said
</B>
<P><B>"peaches?" then he tried to scratch my face. I pushed him back and
he </B>
<P><B>reared up like a bear and making a screaming noise.I kicked him off
the </B>
<P><B>bed and reached out for the light switch. He jumped and clawed my hand.
</B>
<P><B>it was bleeding really bad. So I decided to do what I always do and
</B>
<P><B>yelled for my dad. He walked in and turned on the light and said "WHAT?"
</B>
<P><B>I told him what happened and we both looked at my cat who was sitting
on </B>
<P><B>the floor purring and looking at my dad so innocently. This happened
a </B>
<P><B>few times. Basically the exact same thing! Then the last weird event
was </B>
<P><B>after christmas dinner when I was about 14 I was about to take a </B>
<P><B>shower,I walked in and looked in mirror and I saw my reflection at
first </B>
<P><B>then it faded away to revael a young woman dressed the 1920's type
of </B>
<P><B>clothes and next to her holding her hand was a little boy about 3 or
4. I </B>
<P><B>wasn't really afraid, but I was scared enough to where I couldn't move
</B>
<P><B>or yell. She looked at me, then the boy, then at me and whispered "I'm
</B>
<P><B>sorry for what my son has been doing to you, we are leaving now" and
</B>
<P><B>they vanished and my reflection came back. Nothing else weird happened
</B>
<P><B>to me while I lived in that house!</B>

<P>
<P><B>    A couple of years ago, while living at home with my parents I had
a very</B>
<P><B>freaky experience. It may not sound like much in writing but it was
definately</B>
<P><B>something I will never forget.  It happened in the basement of the
house,</B>
<P><B>right in my bedroom. It was a very hot summer night,  my dog and I
were lying</B>
<P><B>on my bed watching t.v.  I had a glow-in-the-dark yo-yo hanging from
the tile</B>
<P><B>ceiling in my room.  There was absolutely no breeze blowing  through
the</B>
<P><B>window.  Suddenly I got a huge chill and that yo-yo began spinning
wildly</B>
<P><B>around and around. I sat there in complete shock while this went on
for a few</B>
<P><B>seconds.  Then just as quickly as it started spinning it stopped. When
it</B>
<P><B>stopped though it somehow became untied and came crashing to the floor
and</B>
<P><B>broke completely in half.  While this was going on my dog was in
total</B>
<P><B>hysterics and when I gained my composure I hi-tailed it out of that
room and</B>
<P><B>did not return during the night for a very long time.</B>
