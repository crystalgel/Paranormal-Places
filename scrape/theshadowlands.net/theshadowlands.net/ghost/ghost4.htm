<a NAME="grandma"></a>Grandma Mercedes</h3>
<b>by jtolman@top.monad.net</b>
<p><b>I just read the story you have listed, Mr. M and Pepper. It reminded
me of my grandmother who died in 1977. She was 82 years old and in the
hospital and a bit senile (or so we thought). One day my Aunt got a phone
call that my grandmother&sup1;s best friend Provi had passed away. She
was afraid to upset her with the information, but when she went to the
hospital and was trying to get up the nerve my grandmother told her that
Provi came to visit her the night before. My Aunt then told her that was
impossible because Provi had past away. My grandmother calmly said I know,
she came to say goodbye.</b>

<a NAME="the baby"></a>The Baby</h3>
<b>by dmason@netcentral.co.uk</b>
<p><b>One night me and my friend sat up telling eachother ghost stories.
My dad has told me of many things that had happened to him and I told Emma
(my friend) all of these. Emma's cousins Tom and Louise kept on knocking
on the door and just being really irritating. Emma's Grandad had just died
the week before and she decided to tell me a story which he had told her
when she was younger. Her grandad was about 5 years old when his mother
died giving birth to his brother. The baby survived and went home to their
house where the family took care of it. After about a week of the baby
coming home, Emma's grandad was standing at the bottom of the stairs when
he saw his mum at the top of the staircase. He shouted `mummy' but she
just seemed to hover there before looking down to him and saying `it's
okay sweetheart, I've just come for the baby'. The baby died the same day.
After Emma told me that story, we got talking about other things when we
saw a torch light shining onto the wall. Emma shouted `Louise! I'm gonna
come after you in a minute!'. The light then disappeared but we never heard
any footsteps. Emma looked out of the window and her Aunty's car had gone
so it couldn't have been her cousin. Her dad was outside in the garage
and her mum was sat downstairs watching TV!</b>

<a NAME="stickney house"></a>The Stickney House</h3>
<b>by chiff001@mc.net</b>
<p><b>For you people that do not belive I hope that my story will convince
you. I am a chief of police for a small village in northern Illinois.My
office is located in a old two story brick farm house that was built back
in 1834. The house was built with round corners inside and out. the people
of that time belived that they could talk to the dead better with round
corners and that evil could not hide there. I was also on the NBC program
the other side talking about this house. It was shown on January 31, 1995.
I have had locked doors unlocked and opened I had two weeks ago my office
door knob turn before my eyes and watched the door fly open. I have heard
pounding in the walls, Foot steps down the stairs and across the ballroom
floor. I have heard things being dragged across the floor. We have had
lights turned on and off. Rooms go cold and blasts of wind go by. I have
heard only once a human voice groan, and the burglar alarm gos off all
the time but it is only the motion detectors. I have not been the only
one who has seen and felt these things my other officers and clerk have
had there own sightings. With in the six months Iam having chicago land
ghost hunter Richard Crowe come to my office to try to figure these things
out.</b>

<a NAME="forrestal 2"></a>Another USS Forrestal sighting</h3>
<b>by nigel@primenet.com</b>
<p><b>Dearest Sir, I write you today regarding your ghost story about the
USS Forrestal. I was stationed within a Fighter squadron VF-74 onboard
this very ship. I made 2 Mediteranean cruises on this ship. I was in the
Naval airwing, thus our birthing space was just below the flight deck.
I can't even begin to tell you all the experience's I had! I really never
realized the ship was haunted. I too was only 18 years old at the time,
and very naive as well. This was in 1982. On numerous occasion's I would
see a sailor, like myself walk into an area that was just a plain old bulkhead.
He would completely dissapear? I would try and find where he went, but
absolutely nothing. I attributed these visit's to exhaustion. On other
occasions I would hear voices in the night crying for help, only to awaken
thinking I dreamt it. I also had many experiences while working 2 mos TAD,
"temporary assigned duty" In the ships galley. My shift was from 1900 to
0700 the following day. I had an overwhelming feeling when entering the
reefers, and store room's of the ship. I too have seen the dissapearing
Khaki clad chief. It all makes perfect sence to me now. I jutified everthing
by claiming it was just an illusion. Funny, I read an article about a year
ago pertaining to the ships haunting. It seems i slept in the exact area
numerous sailors burned to death in thier sleep. If you should be interested
in additional details, please feel free to contact me. Thanks, TimMadrid</b>

<a NAME="strange visions"></a>Strange Visions</h3>
<b>by jjjones@clandjop.com</b>
<p><b>It wasn't until the last month that I found out that I actually had
a story to tell. I mean, we've all seen things and sure, I've seen little
black things out of the corner of my eye follow me on the way to school.
I didn't think they were real. Just some figment of my imagination, dredged
up from reading too many Steven King books, right? Then, one night I saw
one in plain sight, though it looked like a black cat, i knew we had no
black cats in the house. It ran across my mother's bedroom and under her
bed, but never came out. Ever. Every now and then I would just get this
feeling, like the night wasn't the friendlist place to be in, and when
I did, I got the hell in doors and into the light...away from shadows.
When I was very young, I remeber waking up to a white figure floating above
my bed, more comical looking and friendly than scary, and in one blink
it was gone. All this was many years ago, and as I moved out of one house
and into another, everything stopped for awhile. But then, I would get
the feeling that something was in my room, footsteps would fall on my plush
carpet with no feet to leave them. My stereo would come on for no reason,
would not turn off, and then just as mysteriously go off again. When I
moved to college, everything was peaceful once again. But one night in
my girlfriend's backyard, I saw what I thought was one of her sisters hiding
under her dad's (big) truck. While her sisters have done that before, it
seemed strange that one of them would have such a maniacal smile on her
face. We went inside, only to find all of her sisters had been in the whole
time, and then the same feeling hit me again...the night was not to be
ventured in that night. But I filed all of this away, dismissing it on
an overactive imagination. But now...now they've come back. Or maybe it's
not the same ones, I don't know. But when my wife is in class in the morning
and I'm sleeping in, I often awake to find a female shape standing at the
foot of the bed, sometimes looking similiar to my wife, sometimes black
with stringy hair. Once, and I pray to God I am wrong, it looked like it
carried a decapitated head. More recently, I looked on our living room
floor from another room and thought I saw my wife lying on the floor, smiling
up at me. My wife was at work that night. As with all the other images,
it lasted a brief second, and then it was gone. And then last night, I
was on the phone with my friend, Curtis at 2:00am (both of us our nightowls,
him more than me, but lately I developed this strange insomnia that won't
let me go to sleep until 4 or 5 in the morning...), and I could feel somebody
looking over my shoulder all the time, a precense beyond normal senses.
I could move to another place, but would it really help? Tonight, I think
they\it are\is back. And God forgive me, I don't know what to do about
it, and I'm scared.</b>

<a NAME="white man"></a>The White Man</h3>
<b>by ciason@mindlink.bc.ca</b>
<p><b>When I was about 10 years old and my brother 8years old we lived
in a house on 3 acres of wooded land where we used to play hide and seek
with our friends. One day we were just playing outside as usual in the
late afternoon with our next door neighbour friends and my brother was
trying to find us. I could hear him calling my name from a little ways
away &amp; he sounded a little scared so I decided to see what was the
matter. I came upon him in this little clearing under the canopy of trees
and in the middle of this clearing was the weirdest 'thing' we had ever
seen. We were mezmerized for a moment because it looked to us....like a
huge, white man. It looked to be about 10 feet tall to us kids. As quick
as we saw it...it was gone. It just sort of seemed to 'zip' through the
trees and we tried to follow it but it was going too fast...it was almost
floating. We managed to follow it across the street and down to the creek...and
then lost sight of it. Of course we were a bit shaken by this event and
ran inside to tell our mum and dad and of course they didn't believe us
and suggested that maybe in fact what we saw was a 'big white dog' or something.
We were very adamant about the fact that it was not a dog, but a big, white
glowing man....that just sort of disappeared. We didn't feel scared at
all when we saw it.... and we never saw it again. But...to this day we
both know that we did in fact see something. We have speculated that it
may have been a ghost from one of the many old cars that we found on our
property. But who knows......</b>

<a NAME="flying pictures"></a>Flying Pictures</h3>
<b>by tkilthan@winternet.com</b>
<p><b>When I was in college I lived in an old house that had been made
into an apartment. The upstairs and downstairs two seperate living quarters.
Odd things happened that I'd never really tried to think about except when
I was home. Doors swung open with no wind and no one behind them. Things
disappeared that we set down only to re-appear days, weeks, or months later
in the middle of the floor or in places where they could not have been
missed. One night my roommate went out and I was home alone. I'd gone to
bed and fell into a deep sleep only to be woken up not more than a couple
hours later. There were three pounds so hard I thought I felt the wall
shake, then the sound of breaking glass. There were a couple seconds of
silence, then three pounds and the sound of breaking glass again. I'd never
been so scared. I thought someone was breaking in. But then there was silence.
I laid in that position for over an hour waiting for my roommate to come
home. No one could have gotten around the house without me hearing them,
the floorboards were in such bad shape there was no possible way to be
unheard if you were walking around. But I could not move and I didn't hear
any noise. I heard my room mate come in finally. I listened to her walk
into her room, then heard the steps coming back out. I crept into the kitchen
which was between our rooms and she looked at me, I must have been completely
white. She looked at me wide eyed and said "What happened to my room???"
I started crying and she hugged me. I told her what I'd heard and how long
I'd waited for her to come home. She told me to follow her and we went
into her room. She'd had three pictures on her far wall hung next to each
other. The farthest picture had flown entirely across the room and had
I think hit the wall, bounced down and was laying face up. The middle picture
had flown STRAIGHT down, so hard bending the nail down into the wall. The
last picture had flown off and out to the right, broken into her suitcase
- (the suitcases with the hard outsides, it had cut right into it) and
was laying in an ackward position on it. We searched the house. The door
had been locked when she came home, nothing had broken or touched it. The
windows were closed and locked, and the plastic enclosing the deck was
still stapled from the inside and untouched. I refused to stay in the apartment
alone after that. I always made arrangements to have someone with me or
to be somewhere else if there was the possibility of being alone. My roommate
and I dug into the history of the house after that incident. We'd talked
to as many people as we could. She finally found out that the building
had been a butcher shop before it was ket up as a house. I don't know if
it's related and I'm not sure that I care anymore. But I will never forget
that night.</b>

<a NAME="aunt house"></a>Aunt &amp; Uncle's house</h3>
<b>by Raistov@aol.com</b>
<p><b>In early 1986 (I was sixteen), my Aunt and Uncle moved from Queens
to New</b>
<p><b>Rochelle. They bought a fairly decent house, which needed alot of
fixing.</b>
<p><b>For most of the summer, my parents and I went up on weekends to help
out.</b>
<p><b>When it was done, the fixer-upper had become a spectacular home.</b>
<p><b>In December of that year, my Aunt and Uncle asked my mom to watch
my cousins</b>
<p><b>while they went to a company Christmas party. I tagged along, eager
to spend</b>
<p><b>a night staying up late and fooling around with my cousins.</b>
<p><b>Around 2 a.m., I woke to hear the sounds of my Aunt and Uncle coming
home. I</b>
<p><b>heard someone moving around downstairs, and then begin to come up
the steps.</b>
<p><b>So I got out of the bed, and went to greet them. Of course, there
was no one</b>
<p><b>there. No one on the steps, and no one else in the house. I quickly</b>
<p><b>retunred to my room. A little while later, I began to hear sounds
coming</b>
<p><b>from the attic. Again, it sounded like footsteps. After a while of
being</b>
<p><b>frightened out of my mind, they went away.</b>
<p><b>The next morning, when I discovered my Aunt and Uncle had not gotten
home</b>
<p><b>till later in the morning, I told everyone what happened. Naturally,
they</b>
<p><b>laughed and said I dreamt it....that it was the product of my overactive</b>
<p><b>imagination. After a while, I agreed with them, and discarded the
whole</b>
<p><b>thing.</b>
<p><b>About a month later, I was back at my cousin's house. My younger
cousin and</b>
<p><b>I were in the basement, playing with his video games.</b>
<p><b>Not knowing why, I turned my head and looked behind me, just in time
to see a</b>
<p><b>white mist move around the corner. I very calmly put my joystick
down, and</b>
<p><b>told my cousin to come upstairs with me.</b>
<p><b>This time, I didn't tell anyone.</b>
<p><b>Not too long after that, my mom told me she had spoken to my aunt.
My little</b>
<p><b>cousin had taken up a strange habit. For some reason, at around the
same</b>
<p><b>time every night, had started gong around the house, making sure
that the</b>
<p><b>doors were locked and bolted. When asked why, he had no answer. After
a few</b>
<p><b>months, this stopped.</b>
<p><b>Things quieted down until 1989, when my Unlce proceeded to tell us
he no</b>
<p><b>longer doubted my ghost story. It seems he was out in the backyard,
doing</b>
<p><b>some gardening. My aunt and the kids had gone out for the day. He
took a</b>
<p><b>break for a moment and looked up to see a woman come around the side
of the</b>
<p><b>house, walk up the steps to the back door, and walk in. My Uncle
called out,</b>
<p><b>thinking it was the neighbor who didn't see him in the yard. He ran
into the</b>
<p><b>house after her, and found no one. He stated there was no way the
person</b>
<p><b>could have gone out the back without coming back his way, and no
way she</b>
<p><b>could have gone out the front, as the door was bolted shut from the
inside.</b>
<p><b>Since then, there hasn't been any other occurances, and I've been
to their</b>
<p><b>house dozens of times. I often wonder if the presence of a new family,
and</b>
<p><b>all the ruckus that was made when the house was being remodeled annoyed</b>
<p><b>"something" in the house, and whatever it was decided to make itself
known.</b>
<p><b>Maybe after the family settled into its daily routine, whatever it
was calmed</b>
<p><b>down. I'm just waiting to see what happens when they remodel their
kitchen.</b>

<h3>
<a NAME="figments"></a>Figments of imagination ?</h3>
<b>by m12@ATCON.COM</b>
<p><b>I would say that it started about three months ago. Little things</b>
<p><b>that you wouldn't expect. For instance, the doors were always closing.
Even</b>
<p><b>when there was no wind. If you opened a door, somewhere else in my
house, a</b>
<p><b>door would close. Also, almost every night, you could hear a car
coming in</b>
<p><b>the driveway. But everytime I went to see who it was, there would
be no car.</b>
<p><b>I know it was my driveway because we live in a small subdivision,
and my</b>
<p><b>house was the only one that had gravel in it. There were always bumps
and</b>
<p><b>creaks coming from the side if the house. At first, I thought it
was just a</b>
<p><b>racoon, but after it continuing every night, I began to get alittle
worried.</b>
<p><b>Probably the most " spooky" things though, was the fact that every</b>
<p><b>time I was downstairs, all alone in the house, I could hear people
upstairs.</b>
<p><b>People walking and talking. I would go upstairs, my heart pounding
( Because</b>
<p><b>I knew that there was no one else in the house) to see who or what
it was.</b>
<p><b>The upstairs was always empty. Also, I told you about the closing
doors.</b>
<p><b>Well downstairs we have a small wall fan that you can turn on by
a little</b>
<p><b>latch in the back. Anyway, you usually don't want to close that downstairs</b>
<p><b>door. Because when you do, the fan automatically comes on. This happenned
a</b>
<p><b>couple of days ago. The door suddenly closed, and I could hear the
fan come</b>
<p><b>on. I went downstairs to turn it off, but stopped dead in my tracks
when the</b>
<p><b>fan was on, and the dial said off.</b>
<p><b>This might just be my imagination. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but when</b>
<p><b>I'm alone in my house, I feel an eerie presence all around me. Something
I</b>
<p><b>never feel when my family is home, or if I'm out with my friends.
This</b>
<p><b>coldness, and strange thoughts come in my mind. It could be bright
daylight,</b>
<p><b>little kids running around in the neighbors backyard, and I could
be sitting</b>
<p><b>on the couch, eyes not moving, scared to breathe, feeling the presence
I</b>
<p><b>told you about earlier.</b>
<p><b>I told my best friend about it. She was alittle shook up about it,</b>
<p><b>but then she reassured me that it was all just a figment of my imagination.</b>
<p><b>But, is it?</b>
<p><b>As I said before, this is probably just my imagination playing games</b>
<p><b>with my good judgement. Also, no one else in my house ever had a
problem</b>
<p><b>with anything, but, even as I'm writing this, the door has just closed
about</b>
<p><b>five seconds ago, there is no one in the house but me, and the fan
just</b>
<p><b>turned on. People may call me crazy, but I know what I see and hear.
There</b>
<p><b>is a presence in this house that I'm not sure of. This page gave
me some</b>
<p><b>relief, because after seeing it, I realized that I'm not alone.</b>

<h3>
<a NAME="attacked"></a>Attacked by a Ghost</h3>
<b>by ScoobDog@gnn.com</b>
<p><b>I am writing this in reference to what I believe was an attack on</b>
<p><b>me by a ghost. When I was young, about 7 or 8, I stayed home from</b>
<p><b>school one day. My family lived in a house in Holbrook,</b>
<p><b>Massachusettes and this is where the aforementioned occured. My</b>
<p><b>father was in the military and as such my family oftened moved</b>
<p><b>around from state to state. During my youth, I probably have</b>
<p><b>attended at least 6 schools and have lived in even more houses.</b>
<p><b>This particular house in MA, was the only place that this occured</b>
<p><b>and it only happened one time.</b>
<p><b>Like I said before, I stayed home from school that day. I</b>
<p><b>remeber going into my parents room as they were getting ready for</b>
<p><b>work and falling asleep in their waterbed. After everyone had</b>
<p><b>gone, I was awaken because I felt a sense of danger. As I woke up,</b>
<p><b>I rember my heart racing and I grabbed for the padded rails on the</b>
<p><b>side of the bed. I then saw a grey figure above me and I started</b>
<p><b>to feel that it was very hard to breath (I dont have asthma or any</b>
<p><b>allergies or other medical problems). I was very scared and I</b>
<p><b>struggled with the figure although I couldnt feel it physically or</b>
<p><b>even see myself struggling. I knew that I was putting up a fight</b>
<p><b>though. Within a few seconds, the grey mist dissapeared and I</b>
<p><b>could breathe again. I jumped out of the bed and ran into the</b>
<p><b>living room and sat their all day until my parents came home. I</b>
<p><b>told them what had happened and they told me it was just my</b>
<p><b>imagination. This is what I started to believe myself. I knew</b>
<p><b>that I wasnt dreaming because I grabbed the beds side rails and</b>
<p><b>felt them and knew I was awake, the only other explanations were
my</b>
<p><b>imagination or I was attacked by a very fast grey person, or what
I</b>
<p><b>believe now, that I was attacked by a ghost or spirit. I diddnt</b>
<p><b>have invisible friends growing up and I was never an outcast type</b>
<p><b>of person. I am and have always been a normal healthy reasonable</b>
<p><b>person who does not have an overactive imagination. That was the</b>
<p><b>only time and the only place that anything like that had ever</b>
<p><b>happened to me, I have never seen a ghost since and I have never</b>
<p><b>had an unexplained thing happen to me. This has been the only</b>
<p><b>unreasonable, unexplainable thing to ever happen to me.</b>
<p><b>I am now 21 and in college getting decent grades. I have a</b>
<p><b>lot of friends from all walks of life and I would not consider</b>
<p><b>myself to be mentally troubled. I think about what happened every</b>
<p><b>now and then but it doesnt scare me as much as it did when I was</b>
<p><b>younger. I just wish I knew why the ghost wanted to hurt me.</b>

<a NAME="grandma's story"></a>Grandma's Story</h3>
<b>by vkint@enteract.com</b>
<p><b>I'm still hoping to have my own peaceable spirit encounter sometime
in my</b>
<p><b>life, but</b>
<p><b>until then I submit a story related to me by my grandmother. Back
in the</b>
<p><b>1950's (long</b>
<p><b>before I was around) my grandparents, who live in suburban Chicago,
were</b>
<p><b>driving to</b>
<p><b>dinner along a tree-lined, two-lane road. It was a dark, clear winter</b>
<p><b>evening. As they</b>
<p><b>drove my grandfather noticed a man walking slowly along the side
of the road</b>
<p><b>in grey</b>
<p><b>clothing. As they approached, my grandmother noticed his clothes
appeared to</b>
<p><b>be that of</b>
<p><b>a Civil War soldier, complete with hat and markings. There were no</b>
<p><b>enactments going on</b>
<p><b>(especially in the dead of winter) where he could have come from.
As they</b>
<p><b>came closer,</b>
<p><b>the man looked over his shoulder, stared them both in the face, and
the car</b>
<p><b>sped past.</b>
<p><b>Upon looking back, they said they only saw him for a brief second
before</b>
<p><b>darkness</b>
<p><b>engulfed him (that, or he disappeared). Curious and spooked, my grandfather</b>
<p><b>turned the</b>
<p><b>car around almost immediately and they drove back, but the man in
grey was no</b>
<p><b>where to</b>
<p><b>be found.</b>
<p><b>25 years later I was spending an afternoon with a Chicago-area ghost
hunter</b>
<p><b>on a video</b>
<p><b>documentary shoot. As we travelled around Chicago filming haunted
locations,</b>
<p><b>I told him</b>
<p><b>of this experience my grandmother told me about. He said others reported</b>
<p><b>seeing the</b>
<p><b>Civil War Ghost as well, and upon doing research he discovered that
there was</b>
<p><b>a prisoner</b>
<p><b>camp in the area during the Civil War. Now, this is second-hand and
I have</b>
<p><b>not had the</b>
<p><b>opportunity to investigate for myself, but the story was told with
such</b>
<p><b>conviction, and</b>
<p><b>cooraborated 25 years later, that it makes you wonder.</b>
