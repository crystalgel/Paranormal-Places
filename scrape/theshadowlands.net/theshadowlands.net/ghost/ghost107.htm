<b>My and My Sons Experience</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: LindaD85@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was never really told how to believe in ghosts or spirits if they
were real</b>
<br><b>or not.</b>
<br><b>This started when I moved to Missouri with my family in 1995. The
first house</b>
<br><b>we rented when we arrived something was very uneasy about it. I
not only felt</b>
<br><b>it but my eldest son did also.</b>
<br><b>One evening when the 3 sons were in bed and my husband was working
late. I</b>
<br><b>was up watching TV late. When I decided to go to bed (I had left
a low lite</b>
<br><b>light on in my bedroom) as I was walking down the hallway past my
sons rooms</b>
<br><b>there was a blur. I thought it was because my eyes were tired and
there was a</b>
<br><b>mirror on the back wall of the hallway. But as I continued walking
my left</b>
<br><b>eye got real blurry and I felt a cold chill go through me.</b>
<br><b>There is a basement to this house. I had my washer and dryer down
there, I</b>
<br><b>also had my kids Sega game there. I felt very uneasy everytime I
went down</b>
<br><b>there. My eldest son heard something pounding on the Sega controllers.
He</b>
<br><b>said at one time he saw some kind of figure down there. The figure
was bent</b>
<br><b>over, blurry blackish gray and it had no real face or features.
He said it</b>
<br><b>stood there shaking it's head. He would be downstairs playing and
hear</b>
<br><b>someone come down the stairs and no one would be there. My son was
very</b>
<br><b>uncomfortable when he first walked in, he said he felt sick to his
stomach.</b>
<br><b>When he saw the figure he felt sick also.</b>
<br><b>We have since moved, same town. We have moved into another house
that has</b>
<br><b>been lived in by many people but not for long periods of time. Someone
told</b>
<br><b>me that the reason nobody stays in this house very long is because
it is</b>
<br><b>haunted. Again me and my eldest son has been the ones noticing everything</b>
<br><b>that has been happening here. I hear feet scooting across the floor
at night</b>
<br><b>but no one is there. My son has seen a bright light flashing in
the corner of</b>
<br><b>his room, it is in the upper corner of his room where no lights
shine on the</b>
<br><b>wall (I have also seen this myself). He has also seen 3 lights spinning</b>
<br><b>lights beside his bed. There was also a time that he felt his bed
shake. My</b>
<br><b>son has cancer and he had been going through a time that he could
not sleep,</b>
<br><b>it was right around this time that he felt his bed shake. We do
not have an</b>
<br><b>uneasy feeling about these experiences, they are quite comforting.</b>
<br><b>I had an Uncle that was killed in a head-on accident when he was
riding a</b>
<br><b>motorcycle, hit by a drunk driver. This was around 20 years ago.
I think of</b>
<br><b>him very often. I just wondering if it was him that was here with
my and my</b>
<br><b>eldest son during this time that he (my son) is going through this
cancer. We</b>
<br><b>are not scared of his cancer even though it is a rare. My Uncle
was a very</b>
<br><b>spiritual man, I feel that this is his way of letting us know that
my son is</b>
<br><b>going to be all right we get through this year and his cancer will
be done.</b>
<br><b>I have 2 other sons they have not experienced anything neither has
my</b>
<br><b>husband. I told him and felt foolish, I felt he thought I was crazy.</b>

<p><b>My Brother Came to Visit</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: LoosScrews@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi Dave!&nbsp; I am a 21 year old female in Atlanta, Ga. who has
had a few of</b>
<br><b>my own experiences to add to your interesting collection.&nbsp;
It all began</b>
<br><b>soon after by brother, Granger, died in March of 1990.&nbsp; Since
that time</b>
<br><b>i have felt and seen his presence at my parent's house on several</b>
<br><b>occasions.&nbsp; And the funny thing is, is that I am not the only
one who</b>
<br><b>has!! Here is one of the best accounts I can think of right now.....</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening Chris, one of my brother's friends
from 12 years ago</b>
<br><b>and now my boyfriend, was sitting in my parent's living room watching</b>
<br><b>television with my mom. Chris was stretched out across the couch
with</b>
<br><b>his head n my lap and my mom was sitting at the other end of the
sofa.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly I felt as if I needed to take a deep breath when I felt
a cool</b>
<br><b>breeze float across my foot. I tried to shrug it off until I began
to</b>
<br><b>smell my brother's "personal smell". Just a few seconds later I
felt the</b>
<br><b>same breeze float across the back of my neck and around to the front
of</b>
<br><b>my face. Chris noticed how all of the hair on my arms started to
stand</b>
<br><b>on end and that's when I began to cry. I knew it was my brother's
spirit</b>
<br><b>there to let me know he is still with us. I kindly asked him not
to do</b>
<br><b>things like that again because it rather spooked all of us. Of course
he</b>
<br><b>would never mean to scare anyone, and since has not attempted to
"touch"</b>
<br><b>anyone else. I have several other accounts I would love to share
with</b>
<br><b>you. I must admit the sensitivity I have towards the paranormal
has been</b>
<br><b>handed down to me through 4 generations of women on my mother's
side of</b>
<br><b>the family. It is rather a unique gift and all too often is</b>
<br><b>misunderstood by many. If you are interested in hearing more of
my</b>
<br><b>accounts, I would be glad to share them with you.&nbsp; In fact
I have</b>
<br><b>several pictures of my brother's grave site and plan on locating
them to</b>
<br><b>see if there is anything to submit to your picture gallery. Thank
you</b>
<br><b>for your time!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Experiences My Whole Life</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: MuddPie16@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start my story, I've had these experiences
for a good part of my life,</b>
<br><b>it started long before I was born in a house that has been in my
family for</b>
<br><b>almost a century. My oldest brother Mike was around 3 when he saw
my dead</b>
<br><b>great grandmother in a corner in the attic of the house during a
vist to see</b>
<br><b>our grandmother.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house is an old 2 family home, with a basement
and an old apartment</b>
<br><b>attic that had been dismantled in the 50's.&nbsp; My family moved
into the house</b>
<br><b>in the late 80's.&nbsp; Since the house has been in my family for
almost a hundred</b>
<br><b>years the house has seen many losses and alot have occured inside
the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attic had a very high spook factor, I guess
you would call it.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>house had a spooky feeling to it all over.&nbsp; Alot of two family
houses built</b>
<br><b>in the 1900's in the New England area I've been told had a door
that lead</b>
<br><b>into the living room.&nbsp; This door was for coffins to be wheeled
into the</b>
<br><b>living room so the wakes could be done in the home.&nbsp; Knowing
this always</b>
<br><b>freaked me out.&nbsp; The door way had been covered decades before
my family moved</b>
<br><b>in, but the erie outline was still there on the living room wall.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I gave you a feel of my old home, I
will explain my happenings.</b>
<br><b>I lived in the house for ten years. I have 3 older brothers.&nbsp;
My oldest</b>
<br><b>brother Mike heard and saw alot happen in the house.&nbsp; He didn't
always tell</b>
<br><b>the rest of us for I guess reasons of his own.&nbsp; I started having
things</b>
<br><b>happen 7 years after we moved in.&nbsp; When I was younger I thought
they were</b>
<br><b>just nightmares.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; June of 96 for my birthday I received a dog.&nbsp;
August of that summer my</b>
<br><b>parents were staying in our summer home and my brothers and I were
home. My</b>
<br><b>oldest brother Mike and I were laying on my mothers bed when all
of the</b>
<br><b>sudden my dog went wild.&nbsp; She went from a dog that never barked
or growled</b>
<br><b>into an attack dog, she started barking and growling at the wall,
and when we</b>
<br><b>pushed her towards the wall&nbsp; she cried and wimpered and shifted
herself back</b>
<br><b>towards us.&nbsp; I being brave stood in front of the wall and tried
to beckon her</b>
<br><b>towards me.&nbsp; She just barked and kept at her growling. My brother
Mike and I</b>
<br><b>were convinced we weren't the only two watching TV and left the
room.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>brother Mike and I kept what happened to ourselves and later that
night my</b>
<br><b>brother Joe came home and slept in my mother's room.&nbsp; I slept
in the living</b>
<br><b>room and my brother&nbsp; Tom was watching TV in the room with me.&nbsp;
At 4 am Joe</b>
<br><b>and I heard my mothers sliding bedroom door open and shut 3 or 4
times.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>dog started going nuts again, and Tom jumped up and ran to see what
was going</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; Joe sat straight up in bed terrified by what he had seen.&nbsp;
That night</b>
<br><b>the three of us slept in the living room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike and Joe and I&nbsp; have heard voices of
two men talking to one another,</b>
<br><b>I've heard the doors open and shut and when I went to see who it
was noone</b>
<br><b>was there.&nbsp; Mike once saw&nbsp; who he thought was Joe, (Joe
looks just like my</b>
<br><b>uncle who died in the house),&nbsp; Mike said hello to the figure
and went to his</b>
<br><b>room. When he came out of the room to talk to what he thought was
Joe the</b>
<br><b>figure was gone, and when he finally saw Joe again, Joe told him
that he was</b>
<br><b>just getting home from work and hadn't been home since that morning.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike slept on a bottom bunk of bunkbed he had
in his room.&nbsp; Joe use to</b>
<br><b>sleep on top but long since slept on the couch in the living room.&nbsp;
Mike</b>
<br><b>swears he could hear someone shifting on the top bunk.&nbsp; Even
when none of us</b>
<br><b>where sleeping on top.&nbsp; Mike would hear two men conversating
on the top bunk</b>
<br><b>also, but he could never understand what they were saying.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are just a few of the experiences we've
had.&nbsp; My mother father Tom</b>
<br><b>and I moved out of the house in 97.&nbsp; Joe and Mike still live
there. They</b>
<br><b>still experience things happening at the house.&nbsp; I lived with
them from Nov</b>
<br><b>98 till July 99 and I had no experiences.&nbsp; I visited them 2
weeks ago and</b>
<br><b>stayed over night. I slept by my grandmothers on her pull out and
something</b>
<br><b>almost jumped at me. I cant even explain what happened.&nbsp; It
was pitch black</b>
<br><b>in the room and my mother was next to me.&nbsp; I turned my body
and opened my</b>
<br><b>eyes and an almost flash of light but with a dark figure behind
it leaped at</b>
<br><b>my face and disappeared.&nbsp; I got so startled I started crying.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think whatever what was in that house has followed
me or something is</b>
<br><b>in my new home.&nbsp; When I leave my room sometimes or even when
Im sitting in my</b>
<br><b>room, my stereo will turn on and my Jewel CD will come on.&nbsp;
Last time I came</b>
<br><b>in the room the song Adrien was on.&nbsp; If you know Jewel its
a song about a</b>
<br><b>young girl who has a child who becomes disabled.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no pictures or sounds bits to share.&nbsp;
Just what me and my brothers</b>
<br><b>have experienced.&nbsp; I know its long, and some of my things may
seem a little</b>
<br><b>wild, but what I am typing is nothing but the truth.</b>

<p><b>My Father Loved my Husband</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: VClark3308@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My father passed away 4 years ago this coming Dec, My father loved
my husband</b>
<br><b>like he was his own son, he died of cancer 8 days after he was told
he had</b>
<br><b>it. It was a big shock for the whole family. The week before he
died my</b>
<br><b>husband and i went to see him he was home and he seem to be OK,
just alittle</b>
<br><b>out of it. he was a strong man, he never complaint about anything
and my</b>
<br><b>mother was his whole life he was always worried about her (she has
had 3</b>
<br><b>heart surgery's) anyway my dad gave me a little hug good bye and
when my</b>
<br><b>husband went to shake his hand he gave him the biggest bear hug
(let me said</b>
<br><b>that my father had 8 girls and no boys) so my husband was like a
son to him</b>
<br><b>and he loved him very much.</b><b></b>
<p><b>That day was the last day my husband saw my father alive. I went
back to see</b>
<br><b>him the following week (they live over a 100 miles away) The day
I went back</b>
<br><b>the hospital was bringing him home to died, By this time there was
no hope</b>
<br><b>for him. I was helping the hospice people bring him up the back
stairs into</b>
<br><b>the house and I got this weird feeling that something was wrong,
I just</b>
<br><b>looked at him and knew he was gone, He died on the way home from
the hospital.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband does not believe in ghost&nbsp; or any thing that has
to do with them.</b>
<br><b>About a week after my father passed away my husband woke up feeling
like</b>
<br><b>someone was in the room with us. He looked at the foot of the bed
and saw my</b>
<br><b>dad standing there (he always stood with his thumbs in his pockets)thats
the</b>
<br><b>way he was standing at the foot of the bed, My husband thought he
was seeing</b>
<br><b>things, he said he kept moving around it the bed hoping my dad would
leave,</b>
<br><b>My dad just stood there looking at him. I believe this was his way
of saying</b>
<br><b>good-bye to him, He was like a son to him and he loved him very
much. Now and</b>
<br><b>then he comes to see us, i have seen him sitting in my spare bedroom,</b>

<br><b>I was close to My Uncle</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jobethbear@webtv.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of my life I've always believed
that ghost and things of that</b>
<br><b>nature existed. Unfortunately, I hadn't had any experieces of my
own,</b>
<br><b>until last october(10-1998.)&nbsp; My uncle had died of lung cancer</b>
<br><b>in may (1998). We where quite close and his death was a very difficult</b>
<br><b>thing to endure, for the whole familly.</b>
<br><b>The incidence occured at my fiancee (sp?) house. The neighborhood
is</b>
<br><b>new and his house is only 10 years old.&nbsp; One day after</b>
<br><b>work I had planned to meet him at his house. It was around 6:30
in the</b>
<br><b>eveningand quite dark outside.&nbsp; When I arrived there was no
one home.</b>
<br><b>When you enter his house, there is a powder room directlly off set
of</b>
<br><b>the front door. I switched on the hallway lights and then proceeded
into</b>
<br><b>the powder room. At this point nothing out of the ordernary was</b>
<br><b>happening, until I opened the door! Having stood there for a few</b>
<br><b>seconds, drying my hands, this cold breeze comes from nowhere! It
goes</b>
<br><b>around my head like a hand stroking my hair! Looking straight in
the</b>
<br><b>direction of the wind, I could see no source of origin!&nbsp; I
was</b>
<br><b>completely&nbsp; stunned ! Whatever it was, was very close to me
and I felt</b>
<br><b>as if it were staring right at me and enjoying the feel of my hair.</b>
<br><b>Having stood there several minutes, and being surprised yet scared,
the</b>
<br><b>thing or whatever was gone. Or so I thought!&nbsp; At this point
I</b>
<br><b>figured, I couldn't stand there all night, so I made my way into
the</b>
<br><b>familly room, about 50 feet away. And turning on every light along
the</b>
<br><b>way. I sat down on the couch, thinking that nothing else would happen.</b>
<br><b>Oh how wrong I was!&nbsp; Once again the cold breeze brushed over
me!</b>
<br><b>This time I was completelly scared to death(no pun intended!)</b>
<br><b>Shortly there after, my fiancee room mate came home, and it was
so nice</b>
<br><b>to see a warm body!&nbsp; And I just want to add that there were</b>
<br><b>vents near the places, where these incidences occured. I know that</b>
<br><b>whatever this thing was, it diffinately whated to get my attention,</b>
<br><b>which it did!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Same House Different Experiences</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: snodogg@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Dear Dave and all those ghost fanatics such as I...</b><b></b>
<p><b>My first experience with the paranormal came when I was about 7 years
old.&nbsp; Back then, I didn't realize it being such a tender age.</b>
<br><b>My grandfather's house in Bell, California was known for its ghosts.&nbsp;
My grandfather even had an article written up in their local papers about
it.&nbsp; I didn't know about that until I was much older.</b>
<br><b>My first experience started out when my family took a vacation out
in California.&nbsp; We moved to Minnesota when I was a baby and would
travel once in a while to see our relatives.&nbsp; I had to take a bath
in my grandmother's downstairs bathroom.&nbsp; I couldn't explain it to
anyone but the moment I stepped in there I was truly petrified.&nbsp; I
remember crying and telling my mother I didn't want to take a bath because
I hated being in there.&nbsp; Well, as mothers go...we usually get our
way!</b>
<br><b>I stripped down and got into the tub and my mother left me alone
to take care of things.&nbsp; The second she left, I felt as if someone
was above me watching.&nbsp; Needless to say, that was the fastest bath
I ever took.&nbsp; It scared me so much that I even remembered the strawberry
bubble bath that sat on the corner of the tub.&nbsp; Throughout the whole
5 minutes of my bath I could not take my eye off the corner of the ceiling!</b>
<br><b>After we left California, it would be a whole 11 years before I
returned there on another vacation.</b>
<br><b>I had not heard about the ghost story until I was in my mid-teens.&nbsp;
However, by then, I was a firm believer because of incidences that began
happening at our house when I was 10 years old and we began remodeling
our home.</b>
<br><b>My next incident at my grandfather's house was when I was turning
18.&nbsp; Only 3 out of 5 of us children had gone on this vacation.&nbsp;
My 2 oldest siblings were in college and having babies.</b>
<br><b>After we arrived at the house, my grandparent's put my 2 brothers
and I up in her living room along with my uncle who was also 18.&nbsp;
Sure enough, when my 2 brothers fell asleep, my uncle and I shared another
experience.&nbsp; All 4 of us were laying on the floor in the middle of
the room.&nbsp; We were head to head laying like a plus sign.&nbsp; My
uncle and I were busy talking about Disneyland where we had spent that
day at.&nbsp; Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement.&nbsp;
Over by the corner of the inside of their living room; next to their window,
was a dark figure wearing a long cloak.&nbsp; I sensed such evil that I
couldn't speak and had tears running down my eyes.&nbsp; My uncle noticed
my face and kept asking me what was wrong.&nbsp; After a couple minutes
passed, I finally told him to turn toward the window behind him.&nbsp;
When he did, he saw it also.&nbsp; He said immediately to rebuke it and
demand it to leave in the name of God.&nbsp; I didn't know what rebuke
meant.&nbsp; After his fast explaination and a check to make sure I strongly
believed in God, I finally said&nbsp; "In the name of God I rebuke you
and I demand you to leave!"&nbsp; In that instant the ghosts jaw slammed
shut and he disappeared.&nbsp; Needless to say, I didn't sleep very well
that night.</b>
<br><b>The next morning, my uncle Adam explained about the ghosts in the
house.&nbsp; There were atleast several; maybe more of the ghosts.&nbsp;
He had grown up living in the "haunted house" so by now he was quite used
to it.&nbsp; He claimed to have never seen the ghost&nbsp; that we seen
together until that time.&nbsp; He also felt the evil coming off of it.&nbsp;
As I write this to you, It still has the same effect it did on me 12 years
ago.&nbsp; I am up at 1:48 am with the light on like a little girl again!!!</b>
<br><b>The experiences of this house has continued on with my sister, her
ex-husband and their little boy.&nbsp; More to come on my other experiences
some other night!!!</b>
<br><b>Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.&nbsp; It's not often
where you can actually speak freely of some of this stuff without people
wondering if your nuts or not!!!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Our Friend Walter</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: MBMARES@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My wife and myself experienced what could only be explained as a
very</b>
<br><b>playful and funny ghost. Funny because of one trick he played on
us. My</b>
<br><b>wife bought the house we lived in brand new, so no one had lived
or died</b>
<br><b>there. After we were married we begin to notice things appearing
on</b>
<br><b>tables and counters that we had never before seen. We had no children</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; couldn't explain these items. Small things like canadian
coins and</b>
<br><b>such. A tire from a model car kit turned up one day. The incident
that</b>
<br><b>convinced us happened when we were on vacation. We had a small Hoover</b>
<br><b>canister vacuum. We cleaned the car and drove from NM to CA. When
we got</b>
<br><b>home two weeks later we wanted to clean the car again, but the vacuum</b>
<br><b>was gone. It was always kept in the front hall closet. We emptied
the</b>
<br><b>closet and the vacuum was not there. After searching the house we</b>
<br><b>concluded that we had left the vacuum outside after cleaning the
car and</b>
<br><b>someone took it. We bought a new vacuum. About three months later
I went</b>
<br><b>to the closet to put a jacket away and there was the vacuum. A vacuum</b>
<br><b>cleaner is not an item that you would miss seeing fo three months.
I was</b>
<br><b>astonished and could not explain this. We figured the ghost needed
a</b>
<br><b>name and decided to call it Walter. My wifes best firend has also</b>
<br><b>experienced strange occurances in that house. We have since sold
it and</b>
<br><b>told the new owner about Walter. I don't know if she has met him,
but I</b>
<br><b>hope so. He was a fun type of ghost.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Little Girl Ghost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: SlrSpryte@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In Hubbardston,Massachusetts, on a street called Wlliamsville Rd.
Cutoff.</b>
<br><b>there is a stone in the ground.&nbsp; On this tiny cracked road
a girl died in</b>
<br><b>1818.&nbsp; She was instantly killed after falling off a wagon.&nbsp;
Now I am serious.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;THIS IS TRUE&nbsp; I am not crazy....I am a 13 year old girl....and
maybe you</b>
<br><b>have to live in the community to believe it----ask anyone in HUBB
MASS!......</b>
<br><b>but here is the story.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year around the end of Sept.
a partially invisible girl is seen,</b>
<br><b>very clear, simply running down the street, and then she is gone..&nbsp;
There are</b>
<br><b>even reports in Hubb. Mass about the sightings.&nbsp; A friend of
my family had</b>
<br><b>also seen her, claiming she was driving down the street....(No not</b>
<br><b>necessarily at night) and saw somebody running towards the back
of her car.</b>
<br><b>She was a young girl who was in a long dress.&nbsp; Then the girl
jumped up onto</b>
<br><b>the car and leaped into the air........and dissappeared.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few more of these sightings...people now
actually hang around the</b>
<br><b>street to see this girl.&nbsp; I really don't know what to believe.&nbsp;
I heard it</b>
<br><b>from 16 different people.......and most of them don't joke around.&nbsp;
People</b>
<br><b>really do start popping up in this tiny town....at the end of sept.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I didn't tell it interesting enough....but I
myself take watch.</b><b></b>

<p><b>SPOTS BEFORE OUR EYES</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: DOT22DOT@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the most current ghost story
that I have to tell about.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>guess that I must be gifted as a receiver or even possibly draw
ghosts with</b>
<br><b>my energies to my homes.&nbsp; This time though the ghost sightings
seem to be</b>
<br><b>associated more with my husband.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night while my husband and I were watching
t.v. in the living room</b>
<br><b>he got a really funny look on his face and asked if one of our dogs
was under</b>
<br><b>the blanket next to me.&nbsp; I asked him why but he said that he
was just</b>
<br><b>checking.&nbsp; The next day he told me he had seen a flash of white
go down the</b>
<br><b>hallway into the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have three Dalmatians,
and he thought it had</b>
<br><b>looked like one of our dogs.&nbsp; But all three of them were asleep
in the living</b>
<br><b>room with us.&nbsp; This happened just over a year ago.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of days later I sat in that same
chair and looked down the</b>
<br><b>hallway.&nbsp; The doggy door was right in sight down the hall and
I suggested</b>
<br><b>that he might have seen car lights flash through the doggy door
as a car</b>
<br><b>drove down the alley.&nbsp; Cars occasionally do drive down the
alley but not too</b>
<br><b>often.&nbsp; He looked as though he too thought that that car lights
might have</b>
<br><b>been what he had seen.&nbsp; That is until he saw the white dog
again a few weeks</b>
<br><b>later running down the hall again into the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of weeks after the second sighting
I too saw it when I was</b>
<br><b>checking the back door to make sure that it was locked for the evening.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>turned the handle to see if the door was locked and I pulled the
door open a</b>
<br><b>bit.&nbsp; As I opened the door the cat started to come in so I
opened the door</b>
<br><b>wider so that he could get in.&nbsp; The cat came in and walked
past me into the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.&nbsp; I even stepped out of the way so that he could get
past me.</b>
<br><b>Something looked a little odd so I peeked around the corner.&nbsp;
The cat wasn't</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; Nothing was there.&nbsp; Our cat usually only comes
inside the house when</b>
<br><b>there is a storm.&nbsp; His room by choice is the front porch.&nbsp;
There was no storm</b>
<br><b>that night.&nbsp; I knew right away that I had seen the ghost dog,
let it in and</b>
<br><b>even stepped aside for it.&nbsp; The animal appeared to be gray
to me like the</b>
<br><b>color of our cat only a little bigger.&nbsp; This was the only time
I saw the</b>
<br><b>dog(?).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three times this ghostly dog shape had
been in the hall, gone to the</b>
<br><b>kitchen and disappeared.&nbsp; We wanted to figure out why it was
here.&nbsp; Our</b>
<br><b>oldest female, Mazie, has had two (unplanned) litters, one of 10
and the</b>
<br><b>other 9.&nbsp; The youngest of her offspring would have been three
at that time.</b>
<br><b>We figured that out of 19 Dalmatian puppies one could have easily
died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are dog people and take very good
care of our dogs.&nbsp; They are part</b>
<br><b>of the family.&nbsp; The puppies had been very well loved and cared
for.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>figured that one of the puppies missed it's mom and it's first kind
and</b>
<br><b>loving home.&nbsp; We never get any bad feelings about the ghost
dog.&nbsp; It just</b>
<br><b>creeps us both out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband then saw it two or three more
times, running down the hall to</b>
<br><b>the kitchen.&nbsp; These sightings were a couple of months apart.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband saw it again last month
as the family was taking a Sunday</b>
<br><b>afternoon siesta.&nbsp; He and I were resting on the bed watching
t.v. and he saw</b>
<br><b>it run past our bed(next to me!) and into the hallway.&nbsp; This
was the first</b>
<br><b>time that he had seen it in the day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago he saw it again!&nbsp; It
was running down the hallway, veered</b>
<br><b>off and over our bed because my husband was standing where it usually
runs by</b>
<br><b>down the hallway.&nbsp; He said that it could have possibly landed
on our bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>stayed up late on the internet that night just to make sure that
it had</b>
<br><b>plenty of time to leave before I went to bed.&nbsp; I told him to
tell it to shoo</b>
<br><b>before he went to bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We currently are not sure about what to
do about the ghost dog.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>gives us both the eebie jeebies but doesn't really scare us.&nbsp;
It has reacted</b>
<br><b>to our presence a couple of times.&nbsp; I do get a little fearful
yet when I have</b>
<br><b>to lock the back door and it's been a year since I have seen apparition.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have thought about setting up a video
camera in the hallway or just</b>
<br><b>taking some pictures.&nbsp; I've been hearing about smudge sticks
but I don't</b>
<br><b>really know what they are or how to use them.&nbsp; The white light
thing seems to</b>
<br><b>sound good too.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't ask it to leave in the name
of my religion because</b>
<br><b>I had a terrible experience as a teenager when I tried that to get
a ghost to</b>
<br><b>leave me alone one night.&nbsp; That still scares me a bit.&nbsp;
I'll write about that</b>
<br><b>at another time.&nbsp; I think that all of these things sound good
while telling</b>
<br><b>it to shoo and go on to the next life.</b>

<p><b>Strange Lights</b>

<p><b>By: runningman@pldi.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>The experience I had, was about a month ago.&nbsp; I don't think
it relates to ghosts or anything of that nature.&nbsp; But nontheless it
was something strange.&nbsp; I was out southeast of Waynoka Okla. watching
over a new gas and oil well that was flowing back into a frac tank.&nbsp;
About 1:30 or 2:00 am, I thought I saw some lights streaking up from the
ground, out of the corner of my eyes. I turned and looked to my left and
could see several small blue lights moving about.&nbsp; this was probably
40 ft. away.&nbsp; I thought maybe they were fireflys, but they weren't
blinking like they do.&nbsp; What really scared me was one light that was
real bright, then faded like a glowing ember.&nbsp; I don't know if this
was swamp lights or what, but I wish I really knew what it was.&nbsp; Maybe
you can give me some idea.&nbsp; Thank you. runningman@pldi.net</b><b></b>

<br><b>THE DEMONS I SAW</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Steen1fan@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I dont realy know where to begin with my story. I have told very
few people</b>
<br><b>about it for the fear they might think im crazy. I am glad to have
found a</b>
<br><b>place where i can talk about it freely. I am 26 now and have not
experienced</b>
<br><b>anything like this sence I was a small child,but it changed my life</b>
<br><b>forever.When i was around the age of 3 I was still sleeping with
my mom and</b>
<br><b>dad. There were several things that happend around this time.I will
start</b>
<br><b>with the worst first.One morning i had just woken up and I turned
over like I</b>
<br><b>always did,but this morning i saw the most horrifying sight that
no 3 year</b>
<br><b>old could even imagine,laying next to me was this terrifying demon,I
know it</b>
<br><b>was a demon because of it's eyes. It had a human form of a woman
and was</b>
<br><b>nude.It was about 10 feet tall,had thin boney fingers and the darkiest
eyes.</b>
<br><b>It was like you could almost look through them .You could just feel
pure</b>
<br><b>evil.It had the most wicked smile on it's face,like it was taunting
me.I</b>
<br><b>srared at it for a few seconds then turned back over hopeing I was</b>
<br><b>dreaming,then I felt the boney finger pokeing me in the back(as
if to say hey</b>
<br><b>you) I turned back over and it was still there grining that sickeing
grin.I</b>
<br><b>watched it get up go to the window( witch was closed and about 20
feet off</b>
<br><b>the ground) it turned and gave one last grin and went out the window.
It was</b>
<br><b>also around this time that I awake one night to see 3 demons,they
seemed to</b>
<br><b>be like chidren,they were standing in the door way laughing the
kind of</b>
<br><b>laughter like i've never heared before,this was the same room where
I had</b>
<br><b>seen the other one. At the age of about 7 I awoke one night to my
bed being</b>
<br><b>rasied and levatated in mid air. Neddles to say these things have
disturbed</b>
<br><b>me all my life.I also saw my grandfather and his past away child
after he</b>
<br><b>died,but that was a peaceful sight.I have not had any other experiences
sence</b>
<br><b>I was a child.Oh they have always been noises that I could not explain,but</b>
<br><b>nothing like before.It was like the experience did something to
me.I have</b>
<br><b>never had normal dreams not as a child or as an adult. Always strange
dreams</b>
<br><b>and night mares.It's like I have some way of knowing when a spirit
is near or</b>
<br><b>a house is haunted.Some people call it a gift,but I just wish i
could</b>
<br><b>understand it and what happend to me as a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Thank you for letting</b>
<br><b>me share my story)</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Gentle Ghost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: camber2@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My ex-husband, myself and my 3 small children moved into a home that
was</b>
<br><b>about 100 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband and I were having problems
during this</b>
<br><b>time, so the kids and I were alone in the house by ourselves quite</b>
<br><b>often.&nbsp; After a rather bad fight my ex left mad and I was standing
at</b>
<br><b>the kitchen counter crying.&nbsp; I smelled lilacs, the smell was
very strong</b>
<br><b>and somehow I felt somewhat comforted but alittle mystified as to
where</b>
<br><b>the smell was coming from.&nbsp; Later that evening when I put the
children</b>
<br><b>to bed I was explaining to them that daddy would be back, and no
we</b>
<br><b>still weren't mad everything was o.k. when the smell of lilacs and
what</b>
<br><b>felt like someone tenderly patting my hair happened.&nbsp; My oldest
son ask</b>
<br><b>me what that smell was, and I asked him what smell and he said it</b>
<br><b>smelled like flowers.&nbsp; I got the kids up told them we were
going to have</b>
<br><b>a slumber party all together in the living room, which we did, because
I</b>
<br><b>was scared.</b>
<br><b>Soon it became obvious that everytime my ex and I fought and he
left I</b>
<br><b>would smell lilacs and someone very gently caressing my hair.&nbsp;
Since</b>
<br><b>nothing else ever happened the fear left after awhile and I just
found</b>
<br><b>it very comforting.&nbsp; One night I was awakened by my water bed
sloshing</b>
<br><b>like someone had sat down or gotten up very quickly, since I was
the</b>
<br><b>only one there besides my children I just thought maybe I had jumped
or</b>
<br><b>something in my sleep, just as I was about to settle back down,
it</b>
<br><b>happened again, now this time I was wide awake so I knew I hadn't
done</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; I switched on the light and looked around, I thought I
smelled</b>
<br><b>smoke, I got up to look and the pipe from the woodburning stove
had come</b>
<br><b>loose and smoke was starting to fill up the livingroom.&nbsp; My
ghost had</b>
<br><b>just saved our lives.</b>
<br><b>Years later after my 1st husband and I divorced I had remarried.&nbsp;
My new</b>
<br><b>jusband and I were riding around in the car enjoying a beautiful
summer</b>
<br><b>day.&nbsp; We were driving close to where this house was, and my
new husband</b>
<br><b>told me abouting growing up in this area and his two bestfriends
who had</b>
<br><b>been killed in and automobile accident.&nbsp; Then he started telling
me</b>
<br><b>about their grandmother who raised them and what a wonderful woman
she</b>
<br><b>was and how she always wore lilac perfume.&nbsp; When her 2 grandsons
were</b>
<br><b>killed in a car accident she had killed herself in the house right
after</b>
<br><b>their funerals.&nbsp; By this time the hair on my neck was standing
on end</b>
<br><b>because I just knew where we were going.&nbsp; As we pulled up into
the</b>
<br><b>driveway of the old house I had lived in so miserably years earlier,
he</b>
<br><b>said,&nbsp; when you were upset she would always stand beside you
and caress</b>
<br><b>your hair, telling you everything would be alright and how she would
be</b>
<br><b>there if you needed her for anything, and how he could remember
that and</b>
<br><b>the smell of her perfume.</b>
