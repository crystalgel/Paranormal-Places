<P><B>By:  maddmatter@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>As long as I can remember I was aware that I could sense another
"dimension" or could at least </B>
<P><B>acknowledge that there was much more around than one can visibly see.
In fact, many of my family</B>
<P><B> members have been similarly sensitive to stimulation from that outside
"source". I have never </B>
<P><B>been concerned or startled by this awareness, and neither has my father,
either of my cousins </B>
<P><B>(a brother and sister), or my aunt (their mother) who have all experienced,
to some degree, this</B>
<P><B> personal quality. We always have had a silent understanding of our
shared trait.</B>
<P><B>The eeriest and most fascinating of all my family's encounters did
not involve my father, but </B>
<P><B>rather myself, my aunt, and my two cousins. My aunt, uncle, and their
family lived in an old </B>
<P><B>farmhouse in the country about four miles outside a small town in the
middle of Kansas. As two </B>
<P><B>of my mother's seven sisters met their husbands at my parents wedding,
part of our family lived</B>
<P><B> close by, within an eighteen-mile radius of each other. Our family,
at least my mother's side,</B>
<P><B> was quite close, with each of the three Kansas dwelling sisters giving
birth to daughters within</B>
<P><B> an eight month period of time. My cousin, born a month earlier than
I, and being sensitive like</B>
<P><B> I, has always been like a sister to me. Therefor I never doubted what
she said or was surprised </B>
<P><B>to learn we had in youth experienced the exact same phenomenon in her
childhood home.</B>
<P><B>Each time we had an opportunity to do so my mom and I visited her family.
Often we would find </B>
<P><B>ourselves in that same yellow two-story house built in the 1900's.
Although we never discussed it</B>
<P><B> when we were children, we later corroborated our stories when we were
about eighteen years of </B>
<P><B>age. The house had a kitchen in the west through which the main entrance
was gained, a family </B>
<P><B>room, two bathrooms, a very cold front room, one bedroom on the main
floor and two sparsely </B>
<P><B>finished bedrooms joined by a large closet on the top floor. Many
remarkable things happened in</B>
<P><B> the living room, front room and upstairs bed rooms. The house always
had an unusually "occupied"</B>
<P><B> quality about it. Almost as if there were unseen quests. During my
cousins' child hood in that </B>
<P><B>house my older male cousin experienced regular night terrors. The story
was always the same, an </B>
<P><B>old woman, very pale, gaunt, and angered came from the closet to menace
my cousin, shaking and </B>
<P><B>threatening him. Each night the same gray old woman would appear in
my female cousin's bedroom </B>
<P><B>set on her bed and comfort her. Each morning my male cousin would not
remember screaming the </B>
<P><B>house hold awake, but he would remember the gray woman. I too felt
the presence of an old female </B>
<P><B>near me in the night when I went to my cousin's house for sleepovers.
My aunt would repeatedly </B>
<P><B>find gray bobby pins in the area of the bathroom and kitchen sink,
yet as she had short curly </B>
<P><B>hair, did not wear or own bobby pins at all! Things got stranger. Each
time my aunt would dispose</B>
<P><B> of the pins, no more than two minutes later she would find the same
number of gray pins on each</B>
<P><B> sink. The wooden rocking chair in the living room would rock quite
violently on its own, </B>
<P><B>something that my cousins, my aunt and myself all witnessed. My cousins
and myself often separate</B>
<P><B>ly saw the figure of a little girl in it, with curly brown hair and
clothing that we all later </B>
<P><B>agreed appeared to be from the twenties. The girl gave the impression
of being sad, ill, or </B>
<P><B>quietly angry. A cold sensation followed all of these occurrences.</B>
<P><B>The story behind the house was that of a more than normally dysfunctional
family, which I found </B>
<P><B>out in adulthood from asking my mother. I was told that while the couple
lived in that house </B>
<P><B>together for more than thirty-five years, for eighteen of those years
the couple quit speaking </B>
<P><B>to one another. Disillusioned by the marriage, and a daughter that
died young from an unnamed </B>
<P><B>illness while she was in her preteen years, the father died in the
house at middle age. However,</B>
<P><B> the gray lady who seems to haunt the house fits the description of
the bitter, angry wife and </B>
<P><B>mother who lost her daughter and marriage. This woman died in the local
nursing home around </B>
<P><B>eighty years of age, having survived all of her family members. Apparently
she could never quite</B>
<P><B> leave the past behind. So much in fact, she couldn't seem to leave
her old family home.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Haunting</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  Vinton@jenkens.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 15 years ago my girlfriend's(later my wife) mother called in
the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night, knowing that she was with me.  Her husband, my
wife's</B>
<P><B>stepfather, had been murdered by a friend in a heated argument.  He
had been</B>
<P><B>shot numerous times.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This gentleman was what was commonly referred to as a Mafia Associate,
not</B>
<P><B>being Italian but Irish he was hired and used to perform various
functions</B>
<P><B>and deeds.  He was not a nice person and personally didn't care for
me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After the services and interment some days later, we began to visit
my</B>
<P><B>wife's mother to console her and see after her.   She was and is a
very</B>
<P><B>strong person and really didn't need more than company.  During one
of the</B>
<P><B>visits she calmly said, "Tommy is still around and is trying to let
me</B>
<P><B>know".  I was younger and didn't put much stock in this.  Later that
week,</B>
<P><B>she was asked to go on a trip that would last about a week and she
asked us</B>
<P><B>to see after her numerous cats.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Upon entering the house to feed the cats the following evening, we
noticed</B>
<P><B>all the lights on in her quite large house.  Understand that I had
really</B>
<P><B>not been allowed to visit the house during his life, I felt rather
strange</B>
<P><B>to begin with.  My wife asked me to go upstairs and turn off all of
the</B>
<P><B>lights and I reluctantly agreed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Upon entering the bedroom, I noticed a lamp on on the dresser and turned
the</B>
<P><B>switch, nothing happened, I found it odd and dangerous that the switch
was</B>
<P><B>malfunctioning and could cause a fire in the very old house.  I decided
to</B>
<P><B>unplug the lamp from the wall and upon looking behind the dresser ,
I found</B>
<P><B>it unplugged yet still burning. This frightened me very much and I
called</B>
<P><B>out to my wife who immediately said "lets get out,  Tommy is here".
 The</B>
<P><B>spirit or poltergiest drove us out of the house with lights flashing
on and</B>
<P><B>off and books falling off of shelves until we were outside.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To this day the house still stands and is usually empty as it has become
a</B>
<P><B>rental property and my wife and I find amusement in seeing how long
a tenant</B>
<P><B>will stay until the rent sign is back up.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Later my wife told me that during her years living there, there were</B>
<P><B>frequently strange occurances .  She had lived in a curious 5 sided
room and</B>
<P><B>had read that these types of rooms were "gateways" for spirits, I have
no</B>
<P><B>way of confirming this yet the house did have at least 2 of these 5
sided</B>
<P><B>rooms in it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We live in a very old part of Dallas with a lot of history and at least
2 of</B>
<P><B>our homes have had "visitors" one other was malevolent in nature and
we</B>
<P><B>discovered that someone had once lived there that had been murdered
outside</B>
<P><B>of the home.  Our present home has a happy gentleman who sometimes
appears</B>
<P><B>in our hallway, curiously always walking away and turns his head to
smile</B>
<P><B>before fading away.  He causes and means no harm and appears
frequently.</B>
<P><B>Upon investigation we discovered from older residents that our home
was</B>
<P><B>always a happy house with many parties and get togethers and we carry
on the</B>
<P><B>tradition to his pleasure we think.</B>

<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My name is Lisa Thompson and I live in a haunted house. But mine is
of a </B>
<P><B>good nature. I've lived here for almost 10 years now and I seen it
quite </B>
<P><B>frequently for the firs 5 years and so have people that have lived
here. </B>
<P><B>I kinda see it as a gaurdian angel, because it comes to me when there
is </B>
<P><B>trouble. If people of bad nature come here it let's me know by knocking
</B>
<P><B>on closet doors or something of that nature. Usually this type is not
</B>
<P><B>aloud in my haouse because I feel I have a good proceptio of this typw
</B>
<P><B>of people. I also can since this paranormal phonomanon. Have'nt had
this </B>
<P><B>proven but it runs in my family. I'm sometimes ask for this kind of
help </B>
<P><B>from friends if they suspect such. The ghost in my house only has </B>
<P><B>physical contact with me. For instance I had a close friend that was
</B>
<P><B>dying of cancer. my childs grand was his nurse and told me of his </B>
<P><B>progress. When he was taking his last monents on ths earth , he came
to </B>
<P><B>me and grabed at my feet while I was in bed, I thought not that much
of </B>
<P><B>it being that I had experiacne with him quite often, and was never
</B>
<P><B>afraid of him. But this time was different. He appeared to me in a
</B>
<P><B>shadow,which I had'nt seen hi before. And come close to my face as
</B>
<P><B>though to take my breath. My boyfriend at the time was there and awake
</B>
<P><B>listening to me tell him what was happening. He understood because
he </B>
<P><B>had seen things also. At this time I was afraid because I did'nt </B>
<P><B>understand why? This occured several time in a matter of minutes. and
</B>
<P><B>right after I got a call from this person whom I mentioned that he
had </B>
<P><B>passed. Several time before I had some occasion when my child was </B>
<P><B>dreaming and about to fall off the bed and I heard constant rapping
on </B>
<P><B>the wall before she fell in the floor.There are other things that have
</B>
<P><B>happened also but if your interested I shall tell you at anther time.
</B>
<P><B>Small things. But this is my story. Thanks </B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>  I have a true story of a ghost, my Grandfather. About six years ago,
my </B>
<P><B>grandfather died, due to heart and liver cancer. I was in his hospital
room </B>
<P><B>when it happened, it really hurt me, as well as my family. </B>
<P><B>              About four months later, I woke up from a dream about
him, I </B>
<P><B>was very sick at the time, and felt the need to get some water. So,
I</B>
<P><B>started </B>
<P><B>to go downstairs, but right when I got to the third stair, I stopped.
I </B>
<P><B>looked in front of me, and there, sitting on my downstairs loveseat,
was a </B>
<P><B>blurry object. Yes, it looked like him, but, oh, you know, I thought
my eyes </B>
<P><B>were playing tricks on me. </B>
<P><B>              I looked down and took on step, then I looked back. And
there </B>
<P><B>he was, in full visibility. Just then, he looked at me, I got scared
and</B>
<P><B>took one step back, starting to cry. He was holding my Fathers guitar,
playing it </B>
<P><B>normally, but with no sound. Right before I got ready to go back in
my room, </B>
<P><B>scared stiff, he made a gesture, then, he started talking, but, as
I said </B>
<P><B>before, with no sound. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I ran, as fast as I could back to my room, then started crying. </B>
<P><B>I couldn't figure out if I was seeing things, or if it was him. But
to this </B>
<P><B>day, I still remember. </B>

<P><B>I am Witness to Spirits</B>
<P>
<P><B>By; Debbie  Starling</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is debbie starling I wrote you quite awhile back concerning
some black hooded figures I</B>
<P><B> saw as a child. I told you I had not exsperienced anything else since
that time many years ago</B>
<P><B>...</B>
<P><B> I had'nt until recentley. Just after I wrote you I moved into anothe
home, its old approx. 80 </B>
<P><B>years old possibly 90 well I have felt a strange and unusual attachment
to this home!! Since I </B>
<P><B>have been here I saw out of the cornor of my eye so I thought it to
me imagination, I saw a man </B>
<P><B>standing in my laundry room. Not only I saw him my husband has seen
him also and my youngest son</B>
<P><B> 16. One morning a few months ago i woke up in the morning my husband
was saying goodbye for the</B>
<P><B> day. I was groggy but looked up at him and what I saw maid me scream,
I saw demons all around </B>
<P><B>him!! He's a kind and gentel man also an ordained minister. He was
smiling as he does every </B>
<P><B>morning but these gross ugly looking demons were not!!! I did'nt mention
it to him only told him</B>
<P><B>I was startled and he went to work and I surpringly went back to sleep.
Later I told him of what </B>
<P><B>i saw. I've not seen them any more. However i have witnessed some other
things. I listen to </B>
<P><B>meditation tapes, and I listen to sounds of nature and whales and things
like that keeps me </B>
<P><B>balanced. Keeps my noisey cockatoo clyde balanced too, and really i
was playing it to quiet him </B>
<P><B>down. I was playing the whales in the ocean my husband was playing
on his computer and i was just</B>
<P><B> sitting listening, I've heard this tape over and over, but this evening
I heard a little girls </B>
<P><B>soft voice say " mommy", it sounds like typical scarry movie stuff,
so I thought it was really </B>
<P><B>strange, I looked at my husband and ask did you hear that? He said
yeah i did!! I replayed that </B>
<P><B>tape listen to see if some of the frequencys could have just sounded
like that, but no never </B>
<P><B>heard it again. But thats not all, items of ours are always being
transferred from the places</B>
<P><B>we put them. Like combs, jewlery, simple things. It makes me feel like
I'm going nuts cuz I know</B>
<P><B> where i put things I'm a neat freak. But what takes the cake and made
decide to write to you is</B>
<P><B> this, We remoded our bed room so I wanted to take some before and
after photos, well when we got</B>
<P><B> the photos developed, theres things in these photos. One of then it
appears to be thick smoke </B>
<P><B>rising up from the bed getting thicker near the ceiling it takes up
the entire width of the bed..</B>
<P><B>... I was just joking when i told my husband and here is our ghosts!Until
I decided to peruse </B>
<P><B>your site, And I saw photos with the same kind of smoke!! then i saw
little orbs in some of the </B>
<P><B>photos I thought that was interesting because i use to beable all my
life to see these type orbs</B>
<P><B> with my eyes and never thought any thing of it , because i saw them
all my life. Well I pulled </B>
<P><B>up the photo of the smoke, and started looking thru our photos to see
if it looked similiar and </B>
<P><B>as I was looking i noticed in all the photos of our bedroom both day
and night same day and </B>
<P><B>different day there are little round circles in every bedroom piture!!
they are next to my </B>
<P><B>husband in one photo of him installing our ceiling fan and then around
my son in another picture</B>
<P><B> above his head as he plays with our bird clyde.!! No orbs in the living
room or kitchen photos</B>
<P><B> only the bedroom and in every photo excep one!! i had'nt noticed these,
but caught my eye by </B>
<P><B>accident cuz I had one of your photos pulled up on the screen and said
Oh my God Bill these may</B>
<P><B> really be ghosts afterall. So I told him I'd write you on what to
do I don't have a scanner, </B>
<P><B>but I will send you the photos snail mail if you'd like to take a look.
I don't really know what</B>
<P><B> to do about all this, Bill tells me becareful but i want to know who,
why when and how can I </B>
<P><B>help? He tells me i may not want to know but i do!! </B>

<P><B>Indiana hauntings...</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  goodnomore@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I come back to your web site, day after day, and read</B>
<P><B>the stories of people who are confused, or upset, or</B>
<P><B>scared...  they can't understand WHY they have</B>
<P><B>suddenly seen or felt or heard something</B>
<P><B>unexplainable.  My maternal grandmother was a</B>
<P><B>wonderful little Italian woman, with a very</B>
<P><B>deep-seated belief in what the people in these stories</B>
<P><B>continually refer to as hauntings. She believed that</B>
<P><B>spirits live around us, everywhere, in every home,</B>
<P><B>every empty lot... they just exist on a different</B>
<P><B>plane. She also believed that all humans are born with</B>
<P><B>the ability to 'see' into this other plane.... but</B>
<P><B>most people choose to block that ability, either from</B>
<P><B>fear, or ignorance, or because they were told it was</B>
<P><B>just their imagination. Needless to say, because I</B>
<P><B>grew up with such a wonderful influence, my ability to</B>
<P><B>'see' was constantly exercised. She refused to allow</B>
<P><B>us to block our gift. My oldest daughter, who is now</B>
<P><B>17, had the benefit of spending many hours with this</B>
<P><B>woman, and was also encouraged to develop her gift of</B>
<P><B>sight...  because of this, we have hundreds of</B>
<P><B>incidents that we could relate to your readers.</B>
<P><B>Instead, we have chosen to focus on some of the</B>
<P><B>happier 'hauntings' we have experienced over the</B>
<P><B>years.</B>
<P><B> In 1985, we moved to Indiana, a state rich in</B>
<P><B>folklore and with more than its fair share of reported</B>
<P><B>'hauntings'.  We moved into a house on West 6th St in</B>
<P><B>Muncie. It was an old two-story, and had been turned</B>
<P><B>into rental property years earlier. We had temporarily</B>
<P><B>lived with my husband's mother while house-hunting,</B>
<P><B>and when we came upon this house, we couldn't believe</B>
<P><B>our luck... all the other homes we had looked at had</B>
<P><B>been obscenely expensive in the amount of rent they</B>
<P><B>were asking... yet this one was well within our</B>
<P><B>budget. The owners of the house also owned numerous</B>
<P><B>other rental properties, and the rents on all their</B>
<P><B>other homes were double what they were asking for this</B>
<P><B>one. We just assumed that it was because of the</B>
<P><B>location, but felt so lucky to find a place to live</B>
<P><B>that we didn't ask a lot of questions. We also found</B>
<P><B>it odd that they didn't require a deposit, or a signed</B>
<P><B>lease - when I questioned them, they just shrugged and</B>
<P><B>said that for some reason, nobody ever stayed there</B>
<P><B>for over a month or two, and they just considered it a</B>
<P><B>waste of time to deal with all the paperwork involved.</B>
<P>
<P><B> We moved in that same day... the house was already</B>
<P><B>mostly furnished, so it didn't take long to get</B>
<P><B>unpacked, and begin to claim the house as our own. </B>
<P><B> Because of the very young ages of the kids (1, 2 &amp; 3)</B>
<P><B>we elected to use one of the rooms downstairs as their</B>
<P><B>bedroom. The stairs of the home were very steep, and I</B>
<P><B>didn't want to take a chance on one of them getting up</B>
<P><B>late at night, and ending up at the bottom of the</B>
<P><B>stairway. We turned the two upstairs bedrooms into a</B>
<P><B>huge playroom, complete with child security gate at</B>
<P><B>the edge of the landing. During the day, the kids and</B>
<P><B>I would go upstairs where they could play, and I set</B>
<P><B>my pc up in one corner of the north bedroom, which was</B>
<P><B>the larger of the two. Within just a matter of days, I</B>
<P><B>began to notice what I thought was rather strange</B>
<P><B>behavior on my children's part... they almost totally</B>
<P><B>avoided the south bedroom of the upstairs area. If</B>
<P><B>there was a toy in there that they wanted, they would</B>
<P><B>ask me to get it for them, or else they would make a</B>
<P><B>mad dash into the bedroom, grab the toy, and run back</B>
<P><B>into the north bedroom. I asked them several times why</B>
<P><B>they didn't like it, and the only answer I could get</B>
<P><B>from my two year old was 'scary'. My oldest daughter,</B>
<P><B>who was 3 at the time, told me she didn't like the old</B>
<P><B>lady in that room. She told me that the old woman</B>
<P><B>'looked mean at her' when she was playing in there. I</B>
<P><B>didn't attempt to tell her she was seeing things, or</B>
<P><B>that it was just her imagination. I just told her that</B>
<P><B>maybe the old woman just didn't know how sweet she (my</B>
<P><B>daughter) was, and perhaps they could be friends in</B>
<P><B>time. End of discussion. </B>
<P><B> Days turned into weeks, and things seemed totally</B>
<P><B>normal in the house. Except for the fact that some</B>
<P><B>mornings, I would get up, walk into the kitchen, and</B>
<P><B>the fridge door would be standing wide open. There was</B>
<P><B>no way one of the kids could have opened it... that</B>
<P><B>thing had a death grip when closed. It took all my</B>
<P><B>strength to pull the door open. It just became one of</B>
<P><B>those things you chalk up to 'old house settling,</B>
<P><B>fridge becoming off balance for a minute, and breaking</B>
<P><B>the seal, so the door pops open' kinda things. But</B>
<P><B>then, other things began happening.</B>
<P><B> My husband and I had taken the entry room from the</B>
<P><B>front porch as our bedroom. We used a room divider to</B>
<P><B>block the majority of the room from view of the front</B>
<P><B>door, just making somewhat of an entry hall into the</B>
<P><B>middle room, which we used as the living room. I began</B>
<P><B>to hear little sounds from upstairs, very late at</B>
<P><B>night. Kind of a very soft pacing sound back and forth</B>
<P><B>across the south bedroom floor, directly in front of</B>
<P><B>the window on the south wall. And during the night,</B>
<P><B>when I made my first of several trips to check on the</B>
<P><B>kids to make sure they were covered, I would find them</B>
<P><B>completely tucked into their beds. Their covers would</B>
<P><B>be tucked in between the mattress and box springs on</B>
<P><B>their beds... and I NEVER tucked them in like that.</B>
<P><B>They hated it... said they couldn't move. I would just</B>
<P><B>say "thank you" into their room, and leave. I knew</B>
<P><B>someone was watching over them in their sleep. </B>
<P><B> As time went on, we finally began to meet some of the</B>
<P><B>neighbors; in particular, the ones who lived to the</B>
<P><B>northwest of us. Margie and Ernie were just very</B>
<P><B>plain, down-to-earth people. They had relocated to</B>
<P><B>Muncie in the early 50's, and had lived in that same</B>
<P><B>house since the day they arrived in Indiana. Over the</B>
<P><B>course of coffee in the mornings, and tea out in the</B>
<P><B>back yard in the late afternoons, I began asking them</B>
<P><B>questions about the history of that house. They told</B>
<P><B>me it had been turned into a rental home in the early</B>
<P><B>70's, after the original owners (an old woman and her</B>
<P><B>severely retarded son) died within two weeks of each</B>
<P><B>other. Apparently the son had become entangled in his</B>
<P><B>blankets one night, and smothered to death. His</B>
<P><B>bedroom was the south bedroom upstairs. After his</B>
<P><B>death, his mother isolated herself in his bedroom,</B>
<P><B>pacing back and forth in front of the window... until</B>
<P><B>one morning, when her grandson (now the owner of the</B>
<P><B>home) went to check on her, and found her dead on the</B>
<P><B>floor of her son's bedroom. Right underneath the</B>
<P><B>window. The coroners report said she died of natural</B>
<P><B>causes, but Margie said she literally died of a broken</B>
<P><B>heart and guilt. Margie also told me that all the</B>
<P><B>other renters that had moved into that house had all</B>
<P><B>moved out in a very big hurry... sometimes leaving</B>
<P><B>almost all their possessions in the home, simply</B>
<P><B>because they refused to enter it again. </B>
<P><B> I also finally got an answer to the 'open fridge</B>
<P><B>door' problem. Apparently, the son would get up in the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night, go into the kitchen, and sneak a</B>
<P><B>jar of mayonnaise out of the fridge. Only apparently</B>
<P><B>he knew that if he shut the fridge door, his mother</B>
<P><B>would hear him, so he always left it open. Margie told</B>
<P><B>me his mother would half-gripe about it quite often to</B>
<P><B>her. We lived in the house for over a year before we</B>
<P><B>finally found a home in the country, and we never had</B>
<P><B>any 'bad' problems with our ghostly residents. I just</B>
<P><B>always told her 'thank you' every night for watching</B>
<P><B>over my children, and I never complained about the</B>
<P><B>open fridge door. (And no, my mayonnaise never came up</B>
<P><B>missing, either!) </B>

<P><B>Living Ghost Story-an encounter?</B>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Some History:(this is all relevant to my dream)</B>
<P>
<P><B>In Oct of 1984 I got married and moved 3,000 miles from Pennsylvania
to</B>
<P><B>California.</B>
<P><B>In the spring of 1985, in Pennsylvania my best friend "Debbie" from</B>
<P><B>childhood was in her senior year of highschool.</B>
<P><B>The night of my dream, I had the most vividly colored dream I have
ever</B>
<P><B>experienced! It started off with my husbands best friend "our best
man"</B>
<P><B>from our wedding who is also a paramedic, his name is "Joe".</B>
<P><B>My Dream......</B>
<P><B>I saw Joe, he was approaching me, I was so very surprised to see him
in</B>
<P><B>California. I tried to question him on what he was doing here but all
he</B>
<P><B>would say to me was "There is someone I need to take you to see, come
on</B>
<P><B>lets go"</B>
<P><B>I climbed into his car and off he drove me... down country roads
vivid,</B>
<P><B>beautifully colored fields and hills, all the while Joe was driving
I</B>
<P><B>was questioning him on where he was taking me and what was wrong only
to</B>
<P><B>recieve the same answer: "There is someone I need to take you to
see...</B>
<P><B>gawd, I missed the turn!"</B>
<P><B>Joe drove on thru gorgess countryside.. only to keep missing some</B>
<P><B>blasted turn he was suppose to take. I was beginning to get very</B>
<P><B>frustrated with him!</B>
<P><B>Finally he reached our destination... the car approached this
gigantic</B>
<P><B>white manor with a circular drive way, the flowers and the colors and</B>
<P><B>the sounds at this place were ever so distinct!</B>
<P><B>As we drove up the drive I noticed that the manor house was a
Furneral</B>
<P><B>home. Joe said "there is someone here I want you to see, she has been</B>
<P><B>asking to see you"... </B>
<P><B>Joe led me through the door, there was a party going on, music,
dancing,</B>
<P><B>how odd!... a party in a furneral home? I looked around quickly and
was</B>
<P><B>soooo confused thinking what a strange place to hold a party.</B>
<P><B>Suddenly my friend Debbie comes into the furneral's foyer, a look of</B>
<P><B>confusion on her face and says "BETSY!!". I stared at her surprized
to</B>
<P><B>see her there and said "Debbie! how are you?!" Debbie looked at me
in a</B>
<P><B>very confused way and mumbled something totally off the wall, I
couldn't</B>
<P><B>catch exactly what she said but it was a totally irrelevant response
to</B>
<P><B>my question.</B>
<P><B>I stepped up to her looked closely at her and said "Debbie, how are
you,</B>
<P><B>are you OK?"</B>
<P><B>Debbie's reply was "I'm not so good now, but I'm going to be
fine"....</B>
<P><B>(End of Debbie sequence)</B>
<P><B>There is more, Joe drives me home... the landscape is grey, cold, no</B>
<P><B>color, no leaves just barren roads and barren woods. Uneventful...
I</B>
<P><B>wake up disturbed by this really strange dream.</B>
<P><B>The next morning I get a call from my mother-in-law with the news
that</B>
<P><B>Debbie had an anyorisim (sp?) burst in her brain the previous day in</B>
<P><B>school in the lunch cafeteria. Joe had called her from the hospital,
he</B>
<P><B>was the attending paramedic that arrived on scene and relayed that</B>
<P><B>Debbie was in a coma, things didn't look good and they really did not</B>
<P><B>think that she would pull through this incident. I was devastated!
</B>
<P><B>Well Joe kept a close eye on Debbie for me on a daily basis, and in
a</B>
<P><B>week, on mothers day, she came out of her coma... and a few weeks
after</B>
<P><B>that, she graduated highschool from her wheelchair. Debbie is still</B>
<P><B>doing OK, but she will never be herself even after so many years. But</B>
<P><B>she's alive and has quality to her life.</B>
<P><B>I'm not sure if this is a living ghost story, but it was very
confusing</B>
<P><B>and unsettling.</B>
<P><B>I thought you may find it interesting. Feel free to use it if you
wish.</B>
<P><B>Hope I didnt bore you.</B>

<P><B>3-Part Ghost Story</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Meowomon@aol.com</B>
<P><B>I have a three part story, here goes: IN 1983 I was living in an  apartment
</B>
<P><B>right next to an old cemetary here in Tallahassee.  The apartment was
on the </B>
<P><B>second floor over a garage and there was a "mirror"image apartment
right</B>
<P><B>next to it.  One afternoon in early spring I was napping in my room
when I began </B>
<P><B>to hear footsteps and conversation in the front of the apartment. I
thought </B>
<P><B>it was my roommate, Bridgett. I opened up my eyes and standing at the
foot</B>
<P><B>of my bed was a young man who was petting my cat Lucy.(she is now
deceased).</B>
<P><B>He was slim, wearing a flannel shirt and bluejeans.  His hair was in
the style </B>
<P><B>of the 70's: longish to his collar and parted way on the side,swept
over, </B>
<P><B>(Look at some old highschool pictures and you'll know what I mean)
and blond </B>
<P><B>.He stood there for a moment as I continued to here footsteps and </B>
<P><B>conversation in the front;I thought Bridgett was out there and this
guy was </B>
<P><B>her friend.  As I gathered my wits an realized that he was uninvited
into my </B>
<P><B>bedroom no matter who he was, he sort of just dematerialized.  I sat
up in</B>
<P><B>my bed , still hearing voices and called out to my roommate: no answer.
I got</B>
<P><B>up to investigate but the apartment was empty except for me and my
cat Lucy.</B>
<P><B>                                                                  
 </B>
<P><B>The next part begins in 1990. My local paper  was soliciting ghost
stories for </B>
<P><B>the Halloween issue and mine was printed.  A few days later, a guy
called me </B>
<P><B>on the phone and asked if the garage apartment was at 800 N. Brounough
</B>
<P><B>Street.(the paper did not give the address, only a general description)
I </B>
<P><B>answered "yes" and he described the exact place.  He asked me to look
at a </B>
<P><B>picture of his friend who once lived in that apartment to see if he
was my </B>
<P><B>intruder. He sent the picture by mail and the young man was wearing
a</B>
<P><B>flannel shirt, bluejeans and had longish blond hair.  It could have
been the same </B>
<P><B>guy, but I was not sure.  His friend had lived in that very same apartment
</B>
<P><B>when he was killed in a parachuting accident in 1978.             
         </B>
<P><B>Part three was in 1994.  I was working with disabled adults and it
was near </B>
<P><B>Halloween so I asked people for their own ghost stories.  The teacher,
Matt, </B>
<P><B>said " I was at this party once on Brounough street..." I interupted
him,  </B>
<P><B>"Do you mean 800 N. Brounough, an old church with the garages converted
in</B>
<P><B>to apartments?"  "Yes, how did you know?"  I nearly fell over. I told
him my </B>
<P><B>story then he told me his.  In 1982 , he was in the front (mirror image)
</B>
<P><B>apartment when he heard someone walking up the stairs.  A young blond
man in </B>
<P><B>a FLANNEL SHIRT walked past the window and knocked on the door.  Matt
got up </B>
<P><B>to let him in the door but when he opened it, there was no one there.
 This </B>
<P><B>really happened, I promise.             </B>
<P>

<P><B> My Eerie Feeling</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  gfox@nextlink.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>   I live in Mt. Vernon, Ohio. For many years, there has been a rumor</B>
<P><B>around the area about the small college town outside of Mt. Vernon</B>
<P><B>called Gambier. The college that is in this town is called Kenyon</B>
<P><B>College. The town has a very strange atmosphere about it. All the</B>
<P><B>buildings are very old (19th century and early 20th century) except
for</B>
<P><B>the newer homes and a few dorms that have been built in the area.
Going</B>
<P><B>through this town gives me the wierd feeling (probably because of the</B>
<P><B>rumor that I've heard). Everybody I talk to seems to know about it.
The</B>
<P><B>rumor is that Gambier is one of the seven gates of Hell in the world.</B>
<P><B>People have told me that it is on top of a hill in the woods where
a</B>
<P><B>house once stood many years ago back when the town was founded. I've</B>
<P><B>never seen it but some people say that the basement of the house
still</B>
<P><B>remains there. I have seen the stone pillars at the end of the
driveway</B>
<P><B>or road that leads to it. The road of course is all grown over with</B>
<P><B>forestry but the pillars at the entrance are still there. I had one
vey</B>
<P><B>eerie experince one day back when I was in high school. Some friends
and</B>
<P><B>I were in the Gambier area squirrel hunting. It was an early fall</B>
<P><B>afternoon and it was warmer out than what it usually is for that time
of</B>
<P><B>year. It was around 70 to 75 degrees. We went into the woods and found
a</B>
<P><B>place that looked good for sitting and waiting for the squirrels to
come</B>
<P><B>around. I was sitting there looking around when I suddenly felt the</B>
<P><B>temperature drop. It felt like it dropped 20 to 30 degrees within a
few</B>
<P><B>seconds. It got cold enough that I began to see my breath in the air.
I</B>
<P><B>was only wearing a hooded sweatshirt. I was getting cold so I found
my</B>
<P><B>friends and asked them if they felt the cold and they replied yea,
they</B>
<P><B>did. We decided that we really didn't care to hunt anything that much
so</B>
<P><B>we left. The moment we stepped out of the woods, the temperature
raised</B>
<P><B>back up to what it is was before (70 to 75 degrees). We stood around
my</B>
<P><B>truck for a few minutes talking and I asked one of my friends where</B>
<P><B>exactly the so called Gates Of Hell were located. He looked at me and</B>
<P><B>snickered a little bit and said "You know, as a matter of fact where
we</B>
<P><B>were sitting was less than 100 yards from it. Thats when he showed
me</B>
<P><B>the stone pillars at the end of the road that led to the place where
the</B>
<P><B>house once stood. I've heard everybody talk about the stone pillars</B>
<P><B>being the entrance to it, but I never knew where they were until my</B>
<P><B>friend showed me. Every once in a while I will drive through Gambier
and</B>
<P><B>I will get that same eerie feeling I had that day in the woods. There</B>
<P><B>are other ghost stories that people will talk about that goes on in
the</B>
<P><B>Mt. Vernon area. Some of the popular stories are stories about the</B>
<P><B>Curtis Mansion that was built back in the 19th century before the
Civil</B>
<P><B>War. The house once was a place where part of an underground railroad</B>
<P><B>led to. You can still see some of the remains of it around the house
and</B>
<P><B>across the street from it in an old cemetary. One of the other
legends</B>
<P><B>is the legend of Susie's grave. She was a little girl who died in a</B>
<P><B>fire. Her house was on fire and she had ran back into the house to
get</B>
<P><B>her doll but she never came back out. She was buried in the family</B>
<P><B>cemetary which is all grown over with weeds now, but back in school
some</B>
<P><B>friends and I were goofing off one day after school and we went to
her</B>
<P><B>grave site. There were all kinds of bones lying around. They appeared
to</B>
<P><B>be human bones. They looked too big to be animal bones. But nothing</B>
<P><B>wierd happened when went to the grave site, so there is not much
tell.</B>
<P><B>    I have always been facinated about the paranormal. Anytime a
special</B>
<P><B>on T.V. comes on about it, I'm there. I also love reading about the</B>
<P><B>paranormal. I think that the paranormal is proof that there is</B>
<P><B>definitely life after death and that there is definitely a places on
the</B>
<P><B>side, some that are good and some that are evil. What I felt in the</B>
<P><B>woods that day didn't feel very peaceful. I felt very cold and</B>
<P><B>disturbing. I sometimes wonder if something evil was flirting with
me.</B>
