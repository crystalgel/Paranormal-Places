My Aunt's Story<br>
<br>
By: Greendayangel296@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
This is an experience my aunt has told me about so I'm just repeating
it.<br>
I was a little girl when we moved into this house it wasn't very big
but it was kinda creepy.<br>
Whenever I walked into the laundry room I'd get this uneasy feeling in
me and I'd feel a presence. One night I was sleeping in my bed but was
awoken by these whispers so I went to go look and I saw this girl and I
started to see her all the time and we talked and became friends I'd
see her a lot one day I had just woke up and I looked at the TV it had
writing of it something about an evil man. Later I found out that the
girl I've been seeing was a girl who was kidnapped by this man the man
rapped her, killed her, and buried her underneath the house my mom
would dig under the house to try to find her body and get her to a
peaceful place. But no luck. We moved out a couple years later I
believe the girl is still stuck there with the evil man I hope somehow
someday she will be free.<br>

My Experiences<br>
<br>
By: mommiesmunchkins0304@gmail.com<br>
<br>
In my 24 years of life I have had many experiences. And I just wanted
to share a few.<br>
Lets start when I was younger I was about 7 or 8 maybe. Me and my lil
sister shared a room. We always had this mother goose night light/tape
player thing that sat on a chair next to my sisters bed she slept on
the bottom bunk I on the top. I slept with a giant teddy bear and we
always slept with the bedroom door open. One night I woke up to pitch
black my bedroom door was closed, my bear was across the room behind
the door, the mother goose thing was in the middle of the floor
completely unplugged and off I covered my head and screamed for my mom
she came and fixed everything but I knew then that something had done
it and it wasn't me or my sister and im sure my parents wouldn't have
done something like that. <br>
Again at about 8 years old I was going to sleep and was just about
asleep when I heard someone say "goodnight Terri" and then a brush
across my forehead moving my hair I called to my mom and when she came
to my room I told her what had happened and she told me not to be
scared that it was just one of my loved ones who had passed letting me
know that they are with me.<br>
In the house we live in now I always feel uneasy as does my husband.
When its late at night you walk down the hall through the livingroom
and to the family room where the TV and everything is, before the
family room and next to the living room is the dining room and kitchen.
When you round the wall to go towards the dining room and kitchen you
get the worst feeling in the pit of your stomach we have both ran to
turn on the light once the light is on the feeling still lingers and
the chairs in the family room are rocking as if someone had been
rocking in them. You hear children laughing and sometimes crying...I
have 2 children I have a 2 year old and a 3.5 year old I will think
they are standing at the bathroom door crying for me while im taking a
shower I will come out and ask my husband if the girls were just crying
for me he says no they're sleeping or no they're watching TV. But
someone or something was shaking the bathroom door handle crying for
its mommy. Ive just been sitting here and all of a sudden I will get a
mixture of smells like one smells like really sweet really fresh womans
perfume, then not too much longer after the perfume smell I get a whiff
of cigarette smoke so strongly that even I choke and I am a smoker.
Sometimes they are mingled together and sometimes they are separate.
Ive seen apparitions in my hallway I will have the baby monitor on in
my room cause my children were playing in their room but then came into
mine then all of a sudden it sounds like there is someone in their room
going through their toys and playing with toys but when you go in
nothing is moved or changed. My 2 year old can sense whatever may be
here as well she will come to the kitchen with me at night and my 3
year old will stay in my bed watching cartoons while I get them a cup.
Well while I am filling the cups my 2 year old will play on the kitchen
floor then all of a sudden out of nowhere she will come running to me
as fast as she can and wedge herself between me and the dish washer and
cling on to my legs ofr dear life when I ask her what is wrong she
always tells me "sissy scare me....sissy scare me momma" but her sister
is NOWHERE in the room with us there is noone there but me and her. So
theres no way her sister could have scared her. <br>
I once went into a taco bell in glendora California me my husband and
our 2 children were eatting I had to use the restroom so I did I came
out of the stall and was washing my hands I looked up into the mirror
above the sink as I was getting soap on my hands and my face was NOT
mine it was that of a younger woman both eyes were black her lips were
swollen and busted open she had cuts and bruises all over her face and
her hair was tattered and looked like someone cut it with a razor blade
of some sort. Her hair was light brown and her eyes were either a dark
blue grey or a darker green I couldn't really tell but I looked away
kinda scared and hurried and rinsed my hands and grabbed some paper
towels looked once more and it was my face I saw the 2nd time but I
still rushed out grabbed my children and told my husband to lets get
the hell out of there. And ive never gone back again but im not the
only one ive heard of that happening to there.<br>
My list could go on and on but it would take all night...no mine arent
as scary or crazy as some others but they are just as real and just as
exciting/frightening all at the same time to me.<br>

Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: lsdgirl_2000@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hi~<br>
I grew up in a house in north Denver, just down the road from the
Lumber Baron inn.&nbsp; (as kids we'd ride our bikes past that house,
it was vacant, and we thought then that it was haunted)&nbsp; <br>
I lived at 3425 Bryant st.&nbsp; We lived there for 10 years from 1959
to 1969. Before we moved there many people lived there, but didn't
stay. <br>
My father saw a woman dressed in black with dark skin twice, on
consecutive nights. My mother worked at Keebler, and usually got home
around midnight.&nbsp; He thought she was home as he felt someone sit
at the edge of the bed.&nbsp; When he looked there was this woman in
black.&nbsp; She stood up and walked out of the room and disappeared
into the cuckoo clock on the living room wall.&nbsp; Both nights the
same thing happened.&nbsp; When my mom got home he was visibly shaken.
No one ever saw her again.&nbsp; We found out years later that a woman
had died in a fire in the kitchen.<br>
Once we were all watching tv on a sunday afternoon when all four of us
heard what sounded like the window upstairs breaking as if a rock had
been thrown through it.&nbsp; We went up to check and there was
nothing.&nbsp; <br>
Often times we'd hear footsteps in the middle of the night, or marbles
rolling on the floor.&nbsp; Once my mom and I turned off the tv and
went upstairs to bed when we heard music downstairs.&nbsp; When we went
to check, the stereo was on in the room we had just been in.&nbsp; <br>
I would often feel like someone was staring at me when I was doing the
dinner dishes in the kitchen, or that someone was in the hall outside
of my bedroom.&nbsp; Our cat got spooked a couple of times too, hissing
at something that we couldn't see!&nbsp; <br>
Every now and then I drive by that place, and I can still feel
"her".&nbsp; I think she's sad that she can't leave there.&nbsp; She
never tried to scare us, I think she just wanted us to know she was
there.<br>

My Story<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; sharon.kuta@capgemini.com<br>
<br>
I was always interested in ghosts, UFO&#8217;s, etc since I was a kid and
used to go to the library and rent book on the subjects.&nbsp; It all
started one night in my early 20&#8217;s and continued into my late 30&#8217;s (I&#8217;m
now in my early 40&#8217;s). My sister and I shared a bedroom in the
basement.&nbsp; The basement was finished with a build in bar and my
brother had a bedroom near the stairs.&nbsp; Anyway, one night I was
playing with my Tarot cards (yes, I dabbled a bit) in the family room
and without knowing at the time, my younger sister was playing with an
ouija board upstairs during this same time.&nbsp; Well, I was reading
my cards and they basically told me &#8220;Go F&#8212;K yourself&#8221;.&nbsp; This got
me extremely scared and put the cards away for the night.&nbsp;
Eventually, I through the cards out.&nbsp; Going forward, every time I
was trying to get some sleep, I would hear the sound of a pig running
from the stairs through the family room to the entrance of my bedroom
door and then stop.&nbsp; This went on for weeks and my other sister
who I shared the bedroom with said she never heard anything.&nbsp;
After that episode, things got back to normal again.&nbsp; Then, I
moved in with my boyfriend.&nbsp; That&#8217;s when it starts getting
stranger.&nbsp; He had a studio apartment so we basically slept in the
living room with the kitchen area behind our heads.&nbsp; One night, I
heard this crackling noise and realized that someone was playing with
Solo cups (my boyfriend liked this brand of plastic cup and used them
daily).&nbsp; I sat up and would turn around and the sounds would
stop.&nbsp; Every time I put my head down to sleep, something would
start crackling the cups.&nbsp; Just about drove me nuts.&nbsp; Then,
we started missed silverware for weeks at a time&#8230;.one day 4 spoons or a
few forks would be gone and then the following week, there they
were.&nbsp; When we got engaged, we decided it was time to move into a
bigger apartment.&nbsp; Then it got a lot worse.&nbsp; Our bed went
along the wall where the hall was and our heads basically were at that
wall.&nbsp; Within the first couple of weeks, someone would be knocking
on the hall wall right where my head was.&nbsp; Here again, every time
I would jump up and look in the hall, the knocking would stop and then
after I got back into bed would start back up again.&nbsp; This went on
for a couple of months.&nbsp; Then, it started moving things.&nbsp; I
couldn&#8217;t find my briefcase for work or the small garbage can in the
bathroom would be moved in front of the toilet and I would almost kill
myself tripping over it or the whole roll of toilet paper would be
unraveled to the floor.&nbsp; In addition to episodes like
this&#8230;.missing silverware continued.&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, my
younger sister needed a place to stay while my parents were moving and
we allowed her to live with us.&nbsp; She also experienced bizarre
episodes.&nbsp; One of them involved someone opening her bedroom door
and she thought it was either me or my fianc&eacute; only to realize
that no one was there.&nbsp; Then, the window would start to
continuously slam open and then slam shut.&nbsp; She told me the next
morning that all she could do was lie there and hoped whatever &#8220;it&#8221; was
would make up its mind on whether to have the window open or
closed.&nbsp; During one episode, I got up in the middle of night to go
to the bathroom and that&#8217;s when I saw him.&nbsp; The bathroom was right
across the hall from the bedroom and you could see into the
kitchen.&nbsp; When I walked from the bathroom to the bedroom, I saw an
outline of a man and he was reaching up into our cabinet to get, that&#8217;s
right you guessed it SOLO CUPS.&nbsp; Anyway, he noticed me and with
his hand still in mid air going for a cup, started turning his head
toward me very slowly.&nbsp; I was scared to death and all I knew was
that our eyes should not meet.&nbsp; Before that could happen, I ran in
the bedroom and back into bed.&nbsp; We also had neighbors that lived
upstairs (2 flat apt) and I would often tease about the ghost and tell
them I would send him up for the night.&nbsp; Well, one night he did
and turned on and off their bedroom night all night long.<br>
When my fianc&eacute; and I married, we decided to move into our own
home.&nbsp; That&#8217;s when it started getting way out of control.&nbsp; By
this time, we had also acquired a dog.&nbsp; After moving in our home,
stranger things started happening.&nbsp; Nicki would bark in corners at
nothing for no reason or being eating her food and suddenly shoot off
down the hall or into the living room.&nbsp; My husband worked nights
and I would be sitting in the living room watching TV and would hear
heavy loud footsteps in the attic (we had a walk up attic).&nbsp; My
husband claimed to never hear this but they continued for months.&nbsp;
One evening, my husband had the day off and we were watching TV and low
and behold, he heard someone walking around the attic and actually
said, &#8220;what the hell is that&#8221; and I smiled and told him that&#8217;s what I
been trying to tell him.&nbsp; To note, no more missing silverware or
Solo cup incidents.&nbsp; One night while sleeping I felt a presence in
the bedroom and saw very dark outline of a man and thought it was my
husband.&nbsp; I addressed him but got no response.&nbsp; I watched
this figure walk over to Nicki (she had a dog bed in our room) bend
down to pet her and addressed my husband again but got nothing.&nbsp;
It was then I realized that this was not my husband.&nbsp; That night I
dreamt of a man, almost like a black entity in a black cape, but not a
man, who seemed very evil to me and wanted me to go with him.&nbsp; I
could hear voices of tormented people and I was very scared while this
thing kept trying to coax me.&nbsp; I woke up the next day and still
believe to this day that I was violated.&nbsp; The last straw for me
came when I was down the basement doing some laundry and wandered
around just checking things out and when I got to one corner of the
basement and heard a very loud evil growl that scared the living
daylights out of me.&nbsp; After that, I got out the bible and holy
water and went around the basement, praying and blessing the whole
house to rid it of this evil entity.&nbsp; After that, I didn&#8217;t have
any more problems.<br>
My husband and I parted ways and I allowed him to keep the house.&nbsp;
I moved closer to my family who moved to Indiana and rented an
apartment near them.&nbsp; That&#8217;s when a few minor things
happened.&nbsp; My bedroom door would swing open with no one there or I
would be in the shower and hear someone open and close the front door
(yes, it was locked) and start walking down the hall toward the
bathroom with very prominent foot falls.&nbsp; This would completely
freak me out while I was in the shower.&nbsp; I eventually met someone
and he moved in with me.&nbsp; He would sleep in the living room from
time to time and would wake up to the sound of someone in the kitchen
getting ice cubes and would ask if I was there only to get no
response.&nbsp; This occurred on a few occasions but other than these
small episodes, nothing like I experienced in the house.&nbsp; <br>
A couple of years later, we broke up and I moved into a house in
Illinois.&nbsp; Here, just a few &#8220;spooky&#8221; things -- seeing someone out
of the corner of my eye or hearing something &#8220;land&#8217; on the roof.&nbsp;
I have actually had conversations with who I think is my boyfriend,
only to find no one there.&nbsp; I try to tell myself that it&#8217;s just
the lighting in the house and the roof creaking but who knows. <br>
I honestly believe that there is/was a ghost of a young man that
followed us from the studio apartment to the other apartment.&nbsp; I
often teased that he was mad when we moved and even more so when we
gave &#8220;his room&#8221; to my sister for a period of time.&nbsp; However, when
we moved into the house, I think something happened and this evil being
took over and perhaps suppressed the young man.&nbsp; The couple of
incidents at my apartment in Indiana, I believe was the young man. Here
again, I teased that he didn&#8217;t even want to stay with my
ex-husband.&nbsp; I honestly try not to harbor/think too hard about it
for fear that real strange things may start again.<br>

My Daughter<br>
<br>
By: anonymous<br>
<br>
I have a story but am not sure where to post it....<br>
it involves my daughter and where we formerly resided in an old 3 flat
building<br>
built sometime in the late 1800's...she was 2.1/2 whwn we moved
in....and always<br>
loved being in her room and playing but never wanted to sleep in it...<br>
said there were people in it all the time.....she would even tell me
there was <br>
a man in the house, to which I couldn't see it, but I always did notice
the orbs<br>
in the house and around us all the time, sometimes the light of the
orbs would<br>
encircle us and wisp directly in front of me, or pass along my arm...<br>
The dog would even look up at someone who was not even near him...as if
someone<br>
were talking to him or petty him, as his expressions were endless with
attentativeness...<br>
I was never freightened by this, but it was pretty interesting...I do
have faith in God. I was <br>
told by many readers and my grandmother that I would be a great
receptor of the sorts..<br>
and before my grandmother passed away to sleep forever, I aksed her to
always remain<br>
with me through the duration of my life here on earth......<br>
Before I delievered my daughter into this world, I had a spirtitual
reading done, and the <br>
reader mentioned that my baby was a very old, old, old soul. Soul
(3x)...does<br>
that signify something of her abilities...she was also born 4/4/2000<br>
&nbsp;in the year of the dragon and double digit numbers all adding up
to 10,but actually<br>
her number is prime = 1.&nbsp; <br>
Many times she'll say something to me and finish my thought, answer me
before I <br>
can literally ask her a question....and I know she has read my mind
several instances.<br>
Maybe she and I have some sort of gift, I'm not certain of it
completely, but I am a believer<br>
that the soul (Life) goes on once are bodies tire down.<br>
Just a little blurb, from me to you...and thanx for a great web site.<br>

My Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: chris@prime-stakes.com <br>
<br>
Hello My name is Kristinia , I used to live in a house in Irwinton, GA.
( Wilkinson County )<br>
it was located on Main St. there is a walking track behind it I don't
remember the house #<br>
it is cream colored with red shutters&nbsp; there is a whitr house on
one side and a pink house on <br>
the other. Anyway when me and my children lived there my sister's and i
experienced alot of<br>
different things. We were constantly being waken at 3:30 AM&nbsp;
sometimes by someone violently<br>
shaking us or loud noises in our ear. One morning at 3:30 I was in a
deep sleep when I woke <br>
because it sounded like somone was banging a metel pot with a metal
spoon really loud in my<br>
ear. At first i thought it was a dream or something but even when i was
awake fully the soud<br>
was still there it stopped after about 10 Mins. Another time I was
alone in the house and<br>
was in the kitchen washing dishes I turned around to dump something in
the trash and there<br>
was a young man sitting on my couch in the living room. He was dressed
in a striped shirt<br>
bluejeans and a red cap when I looked back he was gone. I kinda took it
as my imagination<br>
and forgot about it. A couple of weeks later my sister was babysitting
the kids were out on <br>
the walking track playing and she was on the couch watching tv, she
said she heard the back door open and close looked up excpecting one of
the kids and there was this young man walking through the kitchen.<br>
She got up to go in there to see who the heck he was and he was gone .
when I got home she was crying scared to death and never came back to
that house. you could also hear a wind chime all the time there<br>
and i didn't own one nor did the people next door on either side. <br>
<br>
<br>
My Visit<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
I have been reading stories on your site for a few years now and have
only plucked up the courage to tell a few of mine.<br>
My first story starts when I was 19 and pregnant with twins.<br>
I was still young and still mum's little girl,&nbsp; to make it short I
did not keep my babies, which was the hardest thing I have ever had to
do.<br>
To this day I still think about them and this is where it begins.<br>
I have a young daughter who like ever other young child likes to run
around the house going in and out of rooms.<br>
Well one day I was in my kitchen washing my dishes, when I felt my
daughter come in and stand beside me, I was so in grossed with washing
the dishes and looking out the window.<br>
About 2mins after this my daughter walked into the kitchen and went
into the fridge, I asked her if she was just in here in which she
replied no I was in my room playing music.<br>
Later that night I went to bed and had the most amazing dream ever.<br>
My daughter one of the twins came to me and told me that it was her
coming to visit me, but her brother does not come as he is still upset
with me and stays behind and visits his dad.<br>
I don't know if you would believe this but I have the feelings of her
coming to see me very regular.<br>
My next stories, as I do have many starts when I was still living with
my mum, which is South London.<br>
There has always been spirits that walk around that house which after a
while I became use to.<br>
But one night in a dream a spirit came to me in the form of one of my
friends and told me that all the bad ghosts have gone but there is one
left and he is asleep in the wall in the front room.<br>
To this day my mum has said she has not been troubled by anything.<br>
Well this is where I finish I have many more to tell but I'll leave it
to the next time.<br>
<br>

My Great Grandmother<br>
<br>
By: AParkhurst@oklahomacounty.org<br>
<br>
I&#8217;ve always been able to sense spirits but my great grandmother has
always been a constant.<br>
When I was born my mother received a family heirloom cradle. It&#8217;s wood
and collapses so they could carry it on wagon trains. It now has
castors because it had worn through two pairs or rockers. It was first
made for my great-grandfather just around 1860. All of the baby
pictures have these red and yellow orbs all over but only if the cradle
is in the picture. When I was a toddler the cradle was put in the attic
space of our house so we wouldn&#8217;t damage it. We would play in and out
of there, but I distinctly remember that that was where &#8220;the lady&#8221; was.
She would just be standing in there trying to shoo us out. It was like
she was saying&#8221; run along girls&#8230; don&#8217;t get scraped up&#8221; she wasn&#8217;t
really scary and not there all the time. As I grew up my mom would use
the cradle to store blankets (she didn&#8217;t know it collapsed) and when we
started messing with it I would hear &#8220;be gentle now, that&#8217;s old &#8220;in my
head. But being a kid I would ignore it. When I got married and was
expecting my son my mom sent me the cradle. This time I noticed because
I was living in a terribly threatening haunted house and I was almost
constantly scared out of my wits by this awful masculine presence. Once
I set up the cradle she started visiting&#8230; she get&#8217;s soo excited about
babies&#8230; well I started noticing this 30 something pretty brunette woman
with dark eyes briskly moving around trying to get everything ready for
the baby and just fussing about&#8230; when I&#8217;d question her she&#8217;d tell me
&#8220;it&#8217;s ok, I&#8217;m grandma&#8221; and just wave me along.. (I have a pushy
family&#8230;) I finally talked to my mom (she sees them too but they worry
her) I described the lady and she told me it was her great grandmother
Terry.. we can&#8217;t find any surviving pictures of her but my grandmother
verified the description. Since then she hangs out more and gets huffy
when I frustrate her.. she also likes to talk and play with my best
friend&#8217;s 6 month old.. it&#8217;s fun having a great-great-grandmother around
sometimes&#8230;<br>

My Haunted Houses<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Shaggydogparlor@aol.com<br>
<br>
Since I was very young I have encountered paranormal activity, doors
would open and close on their own accord and people could be heard
wandering when I was the only one home. My father who is a truthful
person tells me of times were he would be sitting in the living room
watching TV when he would see people, not just one or two but around 5
sitting there with him and chatting amongst themselves. I&#8217;m not very
much surprised by this because our house was once the town meeting hall
for many years. The moment I will remember for most of my life was when
I was about 3 or four. My babysitter, Mary Dodson recalls that as I
crawled out of my crib and towards her, a tall man with glasses stood
before me and I happened to crawl right through him. Our second house
that I am currently living in also has tales of its own to tell. My
room I would have to say is the most haunted and also my living room.
My good friend Marie one time had laid her jacket across our couch in
our living room, she went to retrieve it when she was astounded when
she couldn&#8217;t move it, and it frightened her half to death. Another
experience I have had was one time I was up in my room doing my
homework with my friend Brittany when I saw someone glide behind my
slightly open door. I called my little sisters name , hoping it had
been her but there was no response, but the door was being pushed open
little by little, I told Brittany to go check if it was actually my
sister but it turns out no one was there. I see shadows on my wall at
night and one time I heard someone whisper my name into my ear and I
could feel what felt like breathe upon my neck, that frightened me for
quite a while, some people don&#8217;t believe me when I tell them what I&#8217;ve
seen or heard but I know it actually happened.<br>

Queen Mary REAL Halloween Haunt<br>
<br>
By: monica@planefax.com <br>

<br>
<br>
Got a good Halloween related story for you regarding the Queen Mary:<br>
Last year, my fiance and I went to the Queen Mary's Halloween
event.&nbsp; <br>
Tired after visiting most of the mazes, we came into the banquet hall
they had set up for dancing and took a seat at the tables on the
outskirts of the room.&nbsp; The music was blaring and there were
people all over, but we had ourselves a quiet, and very dark little
corner.&nbsp; I thought I heard a woman say something, but there were
tons of people so I thought nothing of it, until I saw the look on my
fiance's face.&nbsp; <br>
Alarmed, I asked him what was wrong.&nbsp; He didn't speak for a few
seconds, then finally said "didn't you just hear that woman say excuse
me?"&nbsp; I answered that I had heard something, but figured it was
out on the dance floor somewhere.&nbsp; He looked at me, scared to
death, and told me that it wasn't at the dance floor.&nbsp; She had
tapped his shoulder and said it, but of course no one was there.&nbsp;
Suddenly, an icy chill swept past us both, and as we looked at each
other, the hairs on the backs of our necks stood up.&nbsp; After a few
seconds, the chill passed, but we both know that someone had been
trying to get our attention!<br>
True story, and I'd LOVE to know about the history of that particular
room.<br>
I also LOVE your website, keep up the great work!<br>

The Old Car<br>
<br>
By: topazz1963@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Thought I would share this.&nbsp; A few years ago, my husband and I
were driving in Maine with our daughter.&nbsp; This was the year before
we were married.&nbsp; We were on a camping trip in the middle of
nowhere, and decided to drive to town and explore.&nbsp; As we were
going along the main road, we got out and were hiking periodically
along the roadway, looking at the scenery, and looking for turtles and
other wildlife in the brush.&nbsp; <br>
Along one stretch of the road, I was climbing down the bank, and in the
corner of my eye saw what looked like the rusted out wreck of a car, in
the woods not too far from the road.&nbsp; Having grown up in the
country, hiking along old roads and farms, I was not too surprised to
find old wrecks in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; All of a sudden, while
I was exploring the brush, by the car was a shapeless white form, like
a large piece of white cloth with the edge blowing in the breeze.&nbsp;
I looked up, directly at the wreck, and saw nothing but trees.&nbsp; I
thought, that was weird.&nbsp; <br>
When I got back to the car with my husband and daughter, who had
explored the road a little further away from where I was, I told them
what had happened.&nbsp; <br>
Things like this happened to me once in a while, so I promptly forgot
about it until about 4 years later, and was reading the listing of
haunted places on your website.&nbsp; It was along the Brownville Road
heading toward Millenocket, Maine.<br>

YOU ARE NOT MY DADDY<br>
<br>
By: Genieg4@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I have always had abnormal experiences in one way or another in my 29
years, It would be impossible to recall them all. My scariest event
which I will never forget was the time my dad was out of state for a
few days. I was missing him and could not sleep( I was about 6 yrs). I
had just turned over in the bed facing the door. There he was.My dad. I
was just about ready to jump out the bed to hug him when I noticied, my
dad was " weird looking". I laid there and just looked at a man ,who
looked like my dad glowing, not bright but he was a glow. He had no
expression on his face, he had on a white t-shirt and boxers (my dad
never ever wore boxers). After what seemed like an eternity I whispered
to the man " you are not my daddy". All I remember after saying that
was getting really sleepy and closing my eyes, I opened them long
enough to see if he was still there and he was gone.<br>
A lot of things have happened between 6yrs and now 29 years old. The
most recent one was when I was asleep and woke to the feeling that some
one was standing beside the bed. I looked around and did not see any
one. As i laid my head down I heard in my left ear a mans voice,"CAN
YOU HEAR ME!' I was so scared that I answered yes instantly.The next
morning a neighbor had told me that a man was killed just down the
road, he had been drag racing lost control and hit a tree.<br>

Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: Sillyredhead1@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Many years ago I had an incident happen to me that I will never
forget.&nbsp; Every time I think about it, it seems as if it just
happened yesterday.<br>
I was about 14 or 15 years old.&nbsp; My father and three brothers had
left that day to go fishing, and had decided to spend the entire night
fishing, so only my mother and I were home.&nbsp; We spent all day
cleaning, clearing clutter, and moving furniture around.&nbsp; In the
very early morning hours, around 1 a.m., I was worn out.&nbsp; My mom
still had the dished to do, so she said she was going into the kitchen
to do them.&nbsp; I decided to lie down on the love seat in the living
room that we had just cleaned and rearranged.&nbsp; Just as I was about
to fall asleep, I heard very heavy breathing, sounding as if someone
had been running.&nbsp; At the same time, I also felt the warmth from
someone's breath on my neck!&nbsp; At first, I thought it was my mom
checking on me.&nbsp; Suddenly, I realized I was still hearing her
doing the dishes in the kitchen, at the same time that I was hearing
and feeling the breath on my neck!&nbsp; I yelled out to her, and when
she answered me FROM the kitchen, I shot up off of the love seat and
ran to her.&nbsp; I told her what had happened, and she convinced me
that I had imagined it because I was so tired.&nbsp; I was finally able
to go on to bed, where I fell asleep.&nbsp; Early the next morning, I
awoke and went into the kitchen.&nbsp; There sat my mother at the
kitchen table, quietly crying.&nbsp; I panicked thinking that something
had happened to my father or brothers.&nbsp; She assured me that she
had not heard any bad news concerning them.&nbsp; For several minutes,
I tried to get her to tell me what she was upset about.&nbsp; Finally,
she told me that she was sorry for not believing me the night
before.&nbsp; She said she had finished doing the dishes, and laid down
on the love seat herself to rest.&nbsp; She then said the same thing
happened to her!!&nbsp; To this day we don't know why it
happened.&nbsp; She had several different strange things happen to her
as a teenager, and had always felt that something had followed her from
state to state, and home to home.&nbsp; My parents still live in this
same house, and strange things have happened off and on for 34 years!
We have never been able to understand why things have happened to us
several times over the years!<br>

The SHELL Gas Station Spirit<br>
<br>
By: panther_36@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Boaz, Alabama<br>
<br>
SHELL Gas Station at the corner of Hwy.431 &amp; Hwy.168 It has been
told that the gas station was built on an old Indian burial ground and
is haunted by an Indian Spirit that roams the store from late evening
til just before sunrise. Some say there has been activity by the Spirit
during the day when it is quiet but not as much as during the night.<br>
It is said this is Not a friendly Spirit but an angry unsettled one.<br>
Items that have been placed securely on the shelves are knocked off in
the night.<br>
Cooler doors are opened and closed for no reason.<br>
The Main cooler door is left open when no one is or has been near the
door.<br>
Voices can be heard late at night.<br>
Cabinet doors under the counters mysteriously open.<br>
The &#8220;manual&#8221; coffee maker starts making coffee on it&#8217;s own when no one
is or has been near it.<br>
An employee reported seeing a ghostly, dark fog figure(indian&#8217;s say
this means it is an angry unsettled spirit, not a friendly spirit)run
by him inside the cooler while he was stocking it.<br>
The fountain machine throws out ice when no one is around.<br>
It is best Not to be in this store late at night by yourself!<br>
When the Spirit is near you can always feel an eery coldness.<br>
Many of the Employees have been afraid to work alone at night.<br>
BEWARE!!<br>

Italy...A Long Time Ago<br>
<br>
By: Marrobo@aol.com<br>
<br>
hi, I've never told this to anyone for fear that I would be called
"crazy". I found your website and felt the need to finally tell my
story.<br>
I was in the Air Force and stationed in Italy from 1977 to 1979. I
lived off base in an apartment in a tiny town called Speciola on the
heal of the boot of the Adreadic.<br>
It was a very old home and all marble (floors, etc.), no heat or air
conditioning...very old.<br>
I'd always heard strange things in the house, but blamed it on the fact
that it was an old house. I lived alone and loved being on my own. Then
one night, after about a year of living there, I went to bed at around
11pm as I usually did and fell asleep. At about 1am in the morning I
was awakened by the sound of water running in my bathtub...I was
totally awake by then and I KNOW what I heard!! It went on for about 5
minutes then it stopped. It started up again 5 minutes later. Now I was
getting scarred. I layed in bed and just listened. The water stopped
and everything was quiet. Then, about 2 minutes later I heard the sound
of clicking coming across the floor and into my bedroom. I pulled the
covers over my head. Then I felt something jump up on the bed, it
jumped up at my feet and I could feel it walking up towards my head..I
peeked out and swore I saw a little white dog...it came to my face and
I remember screaming and throwing the covers...the little dog went
away. I started to calm down and tried to get back to sleep. The next
thing I remember was I was again awakened be a bright light next to my
bed...again I WAS AWAKE!!&nbsp; I stared at this light and suddenly saw
the image of a teenage boy. He looked very pale, black sweaty hair and
enormous brown eyes. He was wearing very worn "nickers" and a faked
blue work shirt, brown socks and very worn brown shoes. He just stood
there looking at me and I was looking at him....them he came closer and
sat on the edge of the bed, which I felt.....then he put his hand out
and tried to touch my face and he said "I've never touched a
women"...at that point I screamed and threw up the covers..........he
was gone.&nbsp; I got in my car and drove to a friends house. I just
told her I was having a bad night and could'nt stay home alone. <br>
Afterwards, I felt really bad about how I had reacted to him.....I
still, to this day feel bad about how I acted and keep asking myself
what I should have done. I did do some research and found out that a
young boy had died in that very room from pneumonia in the early
1900's. I wish that I knew them what I know now..........It still
bothers me..thanks for listening.<br>

The Ghost of my Mother<br>
<br>
By: mandgnight@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My "ghost" story happened the first week in July of 1996.&nbsp; But
before I tell it to you, I will tell you a funny story so that you
understand why my family looks at me like I'm crazy when I tell them I
saw the ghost of my mother.&nbsp; <br>
My father died in November of 1982 while I was a newlywed living in
Texas.&nbsp; My parents lived in Maine where I was raised.&nbsp; After
attending my fathers funeral I came back to Texas and immediately
afterward started to "smell" my father in my bedroom.&nbsp; What I mean
by this is that for years growing up I changed the sheets on me and my
fathers beds since my mother could not climb stairs due to an auto
accident.&nbsp; My father had greasy hair as he got older and it had a
very distinct smell.&nbsp; This is what I was smelling!&nbsp; I told my
new husband he couldn't touch me in there because my fathers ghost was
in the room with us.&nbsp; I told my mother about this smell and she
laughed and told me I was crazy.&nbsp; A couple days later she called
me again and asked what items I had taken with me when I left for Texas
after the funeral.&nbsp; I named off what was in the box I took back,
and come to find out, my father's pillow was one of the items and I was
using it.&nbsp; So that explained my ghost and everyone in the family
had a good laugh over this.&nbsp; So this is why, many years later,
when I said I had seen my mother's ghost everyone thought I was crazy.<br>
Now for the REAL ghost story, not my imagination.&nbsp; 3 days after my
mother passed away I was feeling kind of sad and alone, so I said a
prayer (I'm not deeply religious) and asked my mother and God if she
could be me and my 3 sons guardian angel and watch over us.&nbsp; The
very next night my youngest son who was 11 months old at the time, woke
up and began to cry, so I went to his bed to lay down with him.&nbsp;
His room is a large corner of the hallway that was converted to his
room.&nbsp; As soon as I lay down, I saw a shadow of someone walk by me
and go into the kitchen.&nbsp; It was pitch black in the house with not
even a night light, so I wasn't surprised that it appeared as a shadow
since it was so dark.&nbsp; Then the shadow walked back by me and
turned the corner and disappeared into one of my other 2 sons bedrooms
or mine and my husbands room.&nbsp; Thinking it might have been one of
my other sons I got up and to see what they were doing.&nbsp; Both my
sons were sound asleep (and being a mom, I can tell if a child is
faking sleep), so then I went in my bedroom and my husband was sound
asleep and snoring!&nbsp; I was so scared I didn't even dare to walk
back out to my 11 month olds bed, so I jumped into my own bed and threw
the covers over my head, like a kid.<br>
The next morning I didn't tell anyone what I had seen, so they wouldn't
think I was crazy.&nbsp; Well that night my oldest son had an
experience that scared him so bad he was hysterical and I was afraid I
wouldn't be able to get him calmed down and would have to take him to
the hospital.&nbsp; He told me he awoke to someone calling his name and
he looked up and it was my mother, his Nana,&nbsp; and she asked him to
please come outside on the porch with him so they could talk without
waking anyone up.&nbsp; He started hollering "Go away Nana, your
scaring me, leave me alone", and that is when he ran into my room and
woke me up and asked me to come and sleep with him in the living
room.&nbsp; He shook uncontrollably for nearly a half hour after this
event, crying hysterically.&nbsp; <br>
After I finally got my 12 year old son to fall asleep on the couch, I
sat down and prayed, and spoke&nbsp; to my mother in my prayers, I
thanked her for watching over us, but told her to please never appear
to me or my children again since we couldn't handle it and were afraid.<br>
Never again did me or any of my sons see my mother's ghost again from
that day on.&nbsp; I don't know if it was a ghost or not, but I'll
always believe it was my mother watching out for us as I had asked her
to do.<br>

Haunting on USS Hewitt DD-966<br>
<br>
By: sclapper2005@charter.net<br>
<br>
I was stationed aboard the USS Hewitt from 1997-2000 and I kept hearing
2 stories about ghost I didn&#8217;t believe them at the time but now I know
ghost are real, I was on duty one night and ran into one of my friends
on watch he started tell me about a ghost in aft steering I laughed at
him he told me come and see for yourself. It was about 2 am and I
followed him down to the space and he started checking his reading and
I was watch when all the sudden a shadow came over us we turn around
and nothing, this space was only 8x8 and no way we could have cast the
shadow ourselves. Another haunting I had aboard ship was gun mount 52
the aft 5 in gun. The story goes a chief was in the mount when it
started to rotate and he was crush to death in the mount and started
talking to the gunners mates and they where tell me about how tools
would move or if the upkeep on the gun mount was not done properly they
come back and find the space had been torn apart.i never saw the ghost
in mount 52 but I saw the aftermath of it.<br>

Ghost Encounter<br>
<br>
By: reservationplus@oceanisleinn.com <br>
<br>
Hey guys, Matthew from North Carolina here.&nbsp; I have had a ghost
experience and I will start my story from the first night I went to my
friends house.&nbsp; We were sitting around and talked all through the
night and around 6 am I started to leave.&nbsp; We were saying good bye
when I suddenly stopped in mid sentence and looked at the hallway
quikcly.&nbsp; He asked me "what was wrong?"&nbsp; I replied, "I just
seen a skinny man walk down your hallway."&nbsp; He then tells me that
is the "man of the house."<br>
A few months later, I was staying the night over and a thunderstorm
could be heard and seen in the distance.&nbsp; I was lying in bed about
to dose off when suddenly the room had an unwelcome sadness to
it.&nbsp; I opened my eyes and in the dark was a darker figure of a man
in the darkness.&nbsp; When the "man of the house" realized I had my
eyes opened he started to swoop down in my face.&nbsp; I was horrified
and started to back off the bed but soon stopped when the figure
started to walk around the bed to the side I was plotting my escape
from.&nbsp; I remained on the bed and the figure returned back to the
original side and sat down on the bed with me.&nbsp; I saw the arm of
this spirit as it was placed on my leg........."Sweet Jesus" was all I
could say.&nbsp; My leg got real cold once the arm was placed on my
leg.&nbsp; I remained as calm as I could.&nbsp; Then I started to cry
almost uncontrollable.&nbsp; The face of the ghost was sad.&nbsp; After
10 more minutes of this experience, I managed to get out of bed and run
down the hallway and alarm the others in the house I had just seen "the
man."&nbsp; <br>
While trying to convince the roommates and my friend that I had just
seen the ghost in the bedroom, I looked to the hallway and could see
the ghost peeking its head around the corner of the living room.&nbsp;
I told them he was looking around the corner as if he were wanting to
come and join us but was afraid.&nbsp; About that time, I am exhausted
from my ordeal and decide to sit on the sofa and I invite the ghost to
join us in the living room.&nbsp; In a 10 second time frame, I got a
chill and chill bumps started to overcome my body.&nbsp; I stated to
the others, "guys he is in the room."&nbsp; Not even a fraction of a
fraction of a second went by after I said that, the lights went
out.&nbsp; That was pretty much the end of the experience for that
night.&nbsp; <br>
Since that time I have had a couple of other experiences with the
man.&nbsp; One night, I was falling asleep and I burst into tears all
of a sudden due to an overwhelming feeling of sadness in the
room.&nbsp; I thought, not again...but that is all that happened.&nbsp;
One other time, I was lying down about to rest for the night and I felt
what papered to be a sharp finger nail run down the length of my
foot.&nbsp; Since that night, I have not stayed the night at his house
again.&nbsp; I have heard that once they make contact with you like
that that they ghost can now inflict bodily harm on you if he/she
wanted too.<br>

My Experiences with Spirits<br>
<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; anonymous<br>
I would like to share my experiences with spirits.&nbsp; <br>
When I was 10 years old we (me, my mother and my step-father) moved
into an old house in Zip City, AL.&nbsp; We had been living next door
to this house for a couple years and it was on a 99 year lease to my
step-fathers dad.&nbsp; Before we actually moved in we had to do some
repairs and such because the people who had lived in it before us had
wrecked it. After school I would go over there and start painting and
my mother would join me when she got home from work.&nbsp; We didn't
have the electricity turned on yet so we worked during the day while
the sun was up.&nbsp; I wasn't allowed to climb the ladder to paint so
I would paint the lower part of the walls and my mother would do the
tops.&nbsp; The house had 12 ft ceilings.&nbsp; One day my mother was
up on the ladder painting and I was painting in the same room.&nbsp;
She began to fall.&nbsp; I was trying to get over to her but it happen
so fast that i was nowhere near her when the next thing happened.&nbsp;
Someone unseen grabbed her and stood her and the ladder back up safely,
then patted her on the back in a loving manner.&nbsp; We both agreed
that by the time this happened she was already falling far enough that
no momentum of her movements could have righted the ladder.&nbsp; Not
to mention the pats on the back that she plainly felt and i plainly saw
a hand print on her back several times.&nbsp; <br>
Moving forward to after we got moved in.&nbsp; My bedroom was the
master bedroom.&nbsp; My mother had taken the front bedroom.&nbsp; I
was given the master because she didn't like the "feel" of it.&nbsp; My
room had a door into the bathroom, dining room and the top of my closet
had the access door to the attic.&nbsp; Within the first week I smelt a
horrible smell...that of decomposing flesh.&nbsp; Living in the country
it was a familiar smell to me.&nbsp; My step-father said it was
probably just a dead squirrel in the attic.&nbsp; He went up there to
check it out and didn't find anything other than dark stains on the
ply-wood and walls.&nbsp; I didn't go up myself so I can't offer an
idea as to what that was.&nbsp; He also checked under the house and all
around but the only place we smelled it was in my room and near the
closet.&nbsp; After he checked it out the smell went away within a
couple hours.&nbsp; <br>
That night was my first sighting.&nbsp; I was asleep in my bed and woke
up suddenly and wide awake.&nbsp; Anyone who knows me will tell you
that I NEVER wake up wide awake.....except these times.&nbsp; I looked
down to the foot of my bed and saw a little girl sitting there.&nbsp;
She had a purple dress on and had her hair pulled up in pig tails on
each side of her head.&nbsp; She was holding a red ball.&nbsp; I felt
absolutely no fear or threat at all.&nbsp; I just sat there looking at
her for a few minutes and then went back to sleep.&nbsp; That happened
dozens of times during the time we lived there.&nbsp; I tried several
times to talk to her but every time I asked who she was or why she was
there she would get upset and cry or vanish.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt like
she was my friend and somewhat my protector so I didn't want to upset
her.&nbsp; Instead I would just sit or lay there with her till I either
fell asleep or she vanished.&nbsp; <br>
We stayed in that house for about 2 years.&nbsp; Suddenly my mother
wanted to move...and NOW.&nbsp; We got another house in a neighboring
town and moved in less than a week.&nbsp; About 3 weeks after we moved
the old house burned to the ground.&nbsp; There was no power on at the
house and no storms in the area that night for lightening to
strike.&nbsp; All anyone knew was that one night sometime during the
night it burned without anyone seeing it happen.&nbsp; The neighbors
saw it was burned down that morning when they got up.&nbsp; <br>
I asked my mother several years later why we had moved.&nbsp; It wasn't
a common thing to do since we paid a very nominal rental fee and it was
a very nice house with a good bit of land.&nbsp; She told me that one
night while she was in bed she had been woke up from a dead sleep and
saw a VERY angry man storm through her room (without opening doors) and
then she heard screams and other sounds she didn't want to
describe.&nbsp; She said the screams were that of a woman and a
child.&nbsp; The next night she was woke up at the same time by a woman
in her room who told her "Protect your child from him" and then
vanished.&nbsp; I had never told anyone about the little girl in my
room until then.&nbsp; <br>
I have no clue what happened to anyone in that house before we lived in
it.&nbsp; We could only guess that the child and mother were murdered
by a man....possibly the husband/father.&nbsp; <br>
That all happened nearly 20 years ago and neither me or my mother
remember the exact address of the house.&nbsp; One day if I can find it
or remember it I plan to do some research on the location.&nbsp; <br>
<br>

My Phone<br>
<br>
By: bbigdeoj@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
so, one night, at around 12.30, I was laying in bed watching a little
TV. I had all the essentials on the bed side table next to me. Snacks,
drinks, remotes and mobile phone. so im watching away when all of a
sudden the home phone rings. very odd, cause I don't know anyone who
rings my home phone, and I surely don't know anyone to ring at nearly 1
in the morning. so I struggle outta bed, down the hall, try to hunt
down where the little cordless phone has been left. I find it after
about 5 rings and just as im about to answer, half way through a ring,
it stops. so here I am thinking to myself. 'ok, that's it. if your
gonna ring me at 1 in the morning im gonna find out who you are.' so I
ring&nbsp; * 1 0 #&nbsp; (which is the missed call service in
Australia) they inform me that the last unanswered call was from a
mobile number. I recognized the number vaguely but didn't really
register. I pressed one to dial the 'missed' call and after a second I
can hear the ringing through the receiver... and from my room. back up
the hallway clutching the home phone in one hand. I wander into my room
once again, peer into the display of the mobile, and sure enough, there
it was.... home was ringing. home was ringing back the phone that had
placed a missed call... a phone that I knew to be next to my bed,
closed shut and unable to make any calls... still freaks me out.<br>

The Park<br>
<br>
<br>
By: hottburtbabe@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Me and my fiance were hoping that you would like this story. We're from
belton, tx on lake belton. Down at the boat dock in sparta valley park
there have been people murdered around that area and some have been
found and some have not. Bodies of some of the victims have been seen
floating in the water. There have also been sitings of ghostly figures
and black shapeless images darting in and out of site. Unexplainable
glowing eyes have been seen in the woods and screams can be heard on
still nights. <br>
Some of the history of this park is very old and haunting. The park is
located right next to fort hood army base. There is also located in
this area, old indian cave dwellings. Reports of witchcraft and devil
worshipping has been heard of around parts of the lake. There is even a
island called devil's island where bones have been found and pentagrams
drawn on large stones. <br>
The massive numbers of killings, accidents, and drownings are so vast
that this place is beautiful but yet very terrifying!<br>
I hope that you enjoyed reading about the place I live.<br>

My Story<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; kahaverly@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
After my father lost his job as he did often due to alcoholism we
purchased a property in a small rural town.&nbsp; It was somewhat
isolated and from the day we moved in made my skin crawl.&nbsp; I guess
it began with my noticing the fine woodworking as is common in houses
of that age. Upon a closer study I realized the wonderful
combing/varnish technique included snakes and eyes in the design.&nbsp;
I chalked everything up to my teen years and upset from having to move
my sr. year of high school.&nbsp; I lived there with my 2 older
brothers and parents for approx. 4 years. Those 4 years and those that
followed until my parents both passed away were shear hell.<br>
After graduation from high school I worked as a cocktail waitress until
the wee hours of the morning. In the summer months I would frequently
arrive home just as daylight was breaking, do barnchores, take a quick
swim in the creek then get some sleep until my next shift.&nbsp; My dad
would accompany me to the creek and watch me swim while he had his
morning coffee. One day while following my routine I came from the barn
into the house to change into my swim suit. As I walked from the barn
to the house I felt as if someone was watching me from the center
window of the second floor of the house.&nbsp; I couldn't bring myself
to look up at the window due to the flash of an image of red eyes that
had flashed into my mind.&nbsp; I again dismissed this "feeling" and
convinced myself it was fatique from a long shift.&nbsp; I put on my
bathing suit and headed for the creek.&nbsp; My dad called from the
kitchen to go ahead, he'd be down in a minute....as soon as his coffee
was done.&nbsp; I went to the creek, took a quick swim that was cut
short by the image of a man on the bank.&nbsp; At first I thought it
was my father, but realized that my father didn't own a derby and a
pocket watch.&nbsp; I never got out of the water and climbed the bank
any faster than I did that day.&nbsp; I told my father as I met him on
the way down that I felt like I was being watched by someone....I felt
creepy and was done with my swim for that morning. His response to me
was if I felt that way I should always follow my gut instinct and
remove myself from the situation.&nbsp; That was only one of several
experiences that I would encounter in my short lived residence in this
house.&nbsp; <br>
In another instance...when arriving home from another long night shift
at my waitress job.&nbsp; This again was a hot summer morning.&nbsp; I
followed my routine, feeding my horse, a quick swim then off to
sleep.&nbsp; My parents let me know they were going grocery shopping
before I went to sleep so I wouldn&#8217;t be alarmed if they weren&#8217;t home
when I awoke.&nbsp; As I slept, I had a nightmare that through a round
about course of events, a possie of&nbsp; community officials, a
sheriff, clergy and those you always thought of as trustworthy followed
me to the house and in my room, my dad sat cleaning a shotgun while my
mom prepared a hot bath.&nbsp; When the men that were chasing me
arrived they surrounded the house and began to chant to my father &#8220;we
want your daughter&#8221; repeatedly as they began to sting rope from one
person to the other.&nbsp; The dream ends with them throwing the end of
the rope up to the window in my room with a noose tied at the
end.&nbsp; Looking from the window I could see that each of my pursuers
had fastened a part of the rope around their necks in an apparent mass
suicide attempt.&nbsp; The theory being that as I fell from the second
story the weight of my body would create a chain reaction and each
would be strangled.&nbsp; The dream ends with my ghostly body opening
the dining room door that led to a glowing swirling fiery pit that I
was convinced was the gateway to hell.<br>
After I left home, it wouldn&#8217;t be until both my parents had passed away
that I would confess to my brothers that I was afraid of the
house.&nbsp; As we talked, it was revealed that all of us had had the
same image of the man in the derby looking at his pocket watch on the
bank of the creek and the same sick dream that the swirling red pit
(gateway to hell) lay beyond the dining room door.<br>
The house lies vacant but is still owned by my brother.&nbsp; None of
us want to go back to the house&#8230;each time one of us has mustered enough
courage to go there, some ill fate has fallen either on us or the
persons accompanying us.&nbsp; The most damaging a concussion my cousin
sustained from a falling paint can in the hop house. (Note: I had
secured the paint can on the shelf above the doorway prior to anyone
going in as I was &#8220;felt&#8221; it could become a hazard.)&nbsp; <br>
We have tried to research the house as it is the oldest house in the
small community and it was rumored to be haunted but have come up with
only rumor and here-say. The most significant was that of a hardworking
farm family that lost their matriarch.&nbsp; There were supposedly some
incestuous behavior in which the daughter was abused by both father and
brothers.&nbsp; The girl was so distraught after delivering an infant
as a result that she took the baby&#8217;s life then her own.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
is rumored that the church houses the records for substantiating such
an horrific incident but we have yet been able to uncover information
of such dirty little secrets.&nbsp; We believe that it was/is the
spirit of this lovely young girl that was trying to get us to redeem
her soul.&nbsp; I believe my dream of&nbsp; community officials chasing
me were to indicate that she had gone to those in authority that she
felt she could trust to free her from her father&#8217;s and brother&#8217;s abuse
but they betrayed her confidence. She went to her grave being condemned
by community members for being deranged.<br>

Baby's Glow<br>
<br>
<br>
By: loplion@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
<br>
This happened to my brother-in-law, not me, but it is an interesting
story, and i was there at the time. I call it Baby's Glow<br>
Well, i was staying at my sisters house a few months after the birth of
her fourth baby, a son. He was asleep in his cot upstairs, but him
being a baby, he wasn't sleeping through the night. We could hear him
on the moniter, and he had started to cry, he wasn't fully awake, but
sort of, in between, so my brother-in-law left him for a few minitues
to see if he would settle him self.<br>
Well he was still crying, and was starting to get a bit worked up, so
he stood up to go see to him, when he suddenly stopped crying, and on
the moniter we could hear a sort of, static-ish sound, that hadn't been
there before. My brother-in-law legged it up the stairs as fast as he
could as he was very protective of the baby as it was his first baby
and stuff, and me and my sister just looked at each other,and she
shrugged her shoulders. We heard him go into the bedroom, and he said
rather loudly a swear word i'm not going to repeat!<br>
From what we could hear on the moniter, he grabbed the baby out of the
cot and flew down the stairs at about 100 mph!! he came into the living
room with the baby who by this point was screaming his head off. At
first he wouldnt tell us what had happened, so me and my sister just
forgot about it and let him soothe the baby and get him off to sleep
(pointless to say he woodn't take him back to bed till we all went
up!). The next morning, my sister came over to me and told me what had
happened (my bro-in-law had told her in bed that night, but hadn't
wanted me to know incase i was scared). <br>
When he had gone into the room to see to the baby, there was this sort
of glow, hovering above the cot, and the baby was wide awake and just
staring upwards, in a sort of trance (the baby was only a few months
old remember). <br>
Hed got so freaked out that he'd sworn and grabbed the baby out of the
cot, and as soon as he'd touched him he'd started crying agin, and the
glow dissapeared. He'd been so worried about the baby he didn't stop to
think what could have happened!<br>
Wierd things go on at my sister house all the time, but there other
stories for other times. by the way this took place in London, England.<br>

Ghost at Buddies House<br>
<br>

This happened to me and my buddy about 2 years ago. We were out in his
back yard, (it's about a third of an acre), with his family. HIs
parents and older sister were sitting around the fire pit talking while
my friend, me, and his younger siblings played a game of Hide-and-Seek.
Me and him are quite a few years older than the others so we knew we'd
have no trouble hiding especially since we were wearing straight black
clothes. We decided to split up, just to be safe. My friend ran over to
the huge pine tree they've got near the fenceline and climbed into the
lowest branches. I ran towards the fron of the yard and hid, crouched
in some dead weeds. I could see all his younger siblings, his parents,
and his older sister clearly from where I was crouched. All their
animals had been locked up for the night and the street was dark and no
one else was out. While I watched the kids search around the pine tree
I heard a sudden rustling in the dead weeds behind me. Naturally I
froze and tensed up. The rustling continued, but moved off to the right
then stopped. I could feel the adrenaline pumping in me, but I didn't
want to move. I watched the weeds closely and lost track of everyone
else. The rustling started again, closer this time and the air got
freezing cold. After a whole minute the rustling died completely. I
heard the others calling me and I took the chance to book it out of
there. I headed straight for the fire pit and crashed into a lawn
chair. My friend remarked that I turned into a deaf mute when I was
hiding in the ditch. I told him that I had never hidden in the ditch.
He stared at me in a sort of shocked disbelief and said that he had
seen me run from the weeds and into the ditch where he followed and
found me laying down. I told him I'd been hiding by the tree near the
weeds the whole time. We kind of just stared at each other for a minute
then I told him what had happened while I was hiding in the brush. All
in all it was a pretty freaky experience and we're not sure what was
really out there with us that night.<br>

Another Haunted Place<br>
<br>
By: jim@therundowns.com<br>
<br>
Here is another Haunted place for your files. This place has been known
for years to be haunted. I have first hand information as I was friends
with a janitor that had access to all these areas.<br>
Site: Kearney, NE U.N.K. Campus- Old Tuberculosis hospital and the
tunnels.<br>
Here's the scoop. I used to have a studio in one of the buildings on
the west campus. I was friends with one of the night janitors and he
wanted to show me the hospital (all of U.N.K. is connected by old
tunnels that are no longer used). He took me through one tunnel into
the hospital. There are still 2 crematories there. He said at times he
heard them bang open and shut. I seen them, so I know they exist.<br>
Then he took me through another tunnel and within about 300ft. we were
instantly covered in fog. Wee couldn't see 2 feet in front of us. We
ran out of the tunnel and never returned.<br>
This area is very hard to get to- you pretty much have to know someone.
However this is one of the strangest experiences I have had. I have
more and will email more locations later.<br>
Thanks for reading! I hope you like!<br>

Get My Story Out<br>
<br>
By: young_singh_fbi@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hey a friend of mine directed me to your website, as a means to get a
story out. I live about two blocks away from this place. I've seen a
few strange things around the area. The people around me talked to me
about what they know about this story. I'm planning to go there
sometime soon and try to see if I can catch something on camera. I'm
from San Jose, California.<br>
There&#8217;s a house located in the Stanhope neighborhood where the presence
of a ghost named Linder actively haunts the far left house located on
the block. It was said that he once murdered his child-hood friend
Perry on a stormy Sunday evening around fourty-six years ago. Many
residents reportedly see his presence in the wee hours of the morning.
Sometimes if you look at the right living room window you can see a
shadowy figure peeking out. <br>

Family Story<br>
<br>
By: GEBarraza@aol.com<br>
<br>
I was reading some of the stories on your site and have one to share.<br>
About two years back my family (Dad, Mom, my daughter, youngest sister
and myself) and I were returning from a trip to visit family.&nbsp; We
decided to take the scenic route towards Austin, a long stretch of
winding roads and hills. It was getting late and both mom and I thought
we should get through this stretch before it got too dark. At some
point I had a thought go through my mind, "how many people must have
died along these roads, they seem so treacherous at night"...
unbeknownst to me, my mom had the same thought as me at almost the same
time. (I later found out when we talked it out).&nbsp; We stopped at a
gas station along the way and my youngest sister was cleaning the
windows but when I looked out the window to look at her, this is weird
but here is goes.... it was her face but i could clearly see someone
elses face instead of hers and an evil grin in her eyes. I dismissed it
as best I could. And the drive went on... shortly after we left the gas
station the doors to the suburban started locking and unlocking, mom
thought it was me and I thought i was her. Then my daughter which was
sitting in the rear seat by herself started complaining, that something
was pinching her and hitting her. She then started talking to it, which
turned out to be a girl, she started saying "she won't stop hitting
me!" My dad moved to the back seat with her and started to try and calm
her down, but she started crying. After a while she fell asleep... the
doors kept unlocking and locking. Mom and I were silently praying,
neither one of us dared to say what we thought was going on. And we
continued thinking and praying. After about 2 and half hours when we
started pulling in to the outskirts of Austin at a stoplight the doors
unlocked one last time and that was the end of that. We joke that maybe
that was her stop and she got off there. Occasionally, here at home in
Brownsville I feel a presence, well its actually two... one a little
boy and the other a girl. Th eboy is good, the girl however instills a
little fear in me. I could just be associating her to the other girl
that tormented us on that road, but why would I fear her more than the
boy? For the most part. If they are spirits, we live in our world. We
don't mess with them and they don't mess with us for the most part. And
we dont' mention them much if ever. We've found it to be better this
way. Well just wanted to share this with you. Thank you<br>
