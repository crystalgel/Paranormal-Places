<hr width="100%"><big><br></big><big>18 Years in a Haunted House<br>
<br>
<br>
By: bludaisy33@msn.com<br>
<br>
When I was 7 we moved to Erie Pennsylvania. It was an old carriage
house to a mansion that sat in the middle of the block. It was very old
yet very comfortable to me, a 7 year old. <br>
I remember my mom wigging out. I remember a distinct story from my
mother in my later years that stuck with me ever since. She claimed
that one day while myself, my father and younger brother David were all
at a movie and she was the only one at home. It was about 3 in the
afternoon...I even remember what movie it was. The Goonies..I was a
HUGE Corey Feldman fan, lmao! Anyway, she was down in the livingroom
watching television when she heard loud footsteps upstairs. As the
footsteps went past the chandelier hanging above her head the fixture
would shake. She brushed it off and assumed one of us was still home,
maybe not going to the movie...she went to the stairwell and called for
David and I...No one answered. When we walked in the door 45 minutes
later she about passed out.<br>
Later that summer mom and dad hired a guy to build a foyer in our
house. As he was tearing away the walls and ceiling he found an old ax
tied to one of the rafter beams in the ceiling. It was wrapped in old,
old ropes that disinegrated as you touchd them and had a brown dust all
over the blade ...She assumed was blood. Shortly after that the same
guy was putting in a new furnace for us (mind you, this was an old, OLD
house so the basement was dirt, even had an underground railroad that
was used by slaves in the late 1800's) he found bones...My parents
freaked out again and went to the Erie County library and use the
microphish machine (remember, these were the early 80's) They
discovered thru documented news clippings that there was a missing 2
year old girl from our residence 15 years earlier! My mom started to
panic...but according to them were in no financial position to move.<br>
Months went by and my brother started waking up screaming, comming out
of what seemed viscious nightmares...he swore to God that he was seeing
a little girl soaked in blood hovering above him and sometimes even
pounding on his window. These same dreams went on night after night for
years! He also swore to God that he would see a bright white ball of
light zoom from his room right into my room.<br>
Now the only thing I can ligitamately remember is waking up in the
middle of the night out of a dead sleep, sitting up and seeing about 20
people standing around my bed. Trust me, I know I was awake..You know
when you are dreaming and when you are awake. I was awake...I wasn't
scared. Not at all. Infact, I still remember almost 30 years later this
extreme feeling of happiness and comfort I felt as I looked at these
people...it lasted only about 30 seconds...and I never had the same
thing happen to me again.<br>
WHen I turned 18, my mom and dad were finally able to buy a house
elsewere. We ended up in a a susburb not far from there...Mom dies less
than a year later and dad killed himself.<br>
Thats my story and I swear to God, it's all true.<br>

A Song for Mary<br>
<br>
<br>
By: alica.korenic@ri.t-com.hr<br>
<br>
Here comes my second story... (Like someone remembers there was the
first one?) It happened to a relative of mine but I've been somewhat
included, enough to be sure it's actually true - I'm quite interested
in the paranormal, but not very gullible. <br>
It would be silly to use a &laquo;close relative&raquo; through the
whole story, so lets call her Mary. I'm still Alice and English is
still not my first language, so excuse me if I write something weird.
Language-wise weird. The story itself is weird but it's meant to be.<br>
So. Back in the 60's Mary had a big love in her life, one of those
almost melodramatic relationships, with deep feelings and fiery fights.
Verbal fights, no violence here. They've been together for a few years,
both soon to graduate and everybody were sure they'll live happily
everafter. But they had one of their pride-driven fights over some
petty reason and stopped talking to each other. For days, that turned
to weeks, and months... Both finished their education, each went back
to home town, got job. Months turned to years. Too stubborn to make a
call, or maybe afraid. I never understood that, but that's me. <br>
After few months Mary was sure Peter doesn't love her, anyway. After
few years he was just a painfull memory and she married some guy. It
probably was love too, but she never told me &laquo;when my darling
husband took me to dinner yesterday&raquo;, it was always &laquo;when
my darling Peter took me to dinner in 1966.&raquo;. Well, yes, it's
wacky but Mary is still my favorite relative and when I moved from my
home town years ago we stood in touch, making phone company extremely
happy. <br>
About two years ago she mentioned there is this rather uninteresting
conference or something like that she should attend. And she wouldn't
but it will be in Peter's home town. <br>
&laquo;Oh, you hope to meet him?&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Please, of course not. He probably doesn't remember me. Or wouldn't recognize me, I'm so old.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Well, he wasn't getting younger either. Don't you worry about that. Only, he could be married you know.&raquo;<br>
Not a widow like me.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;No, not a widow. A widower, maybe. That would be nice.&raquo; (I was joking of course.)<br>
&laquo;Yes... I mean I would prefer my husband is alive but...&raquo;<br>
&laquo;I know.&raquo;<br>
and so we chatted on and she decided to go becuse she likes small towns
on the Adriatic coast. Not because there is hope. Of course not. <br>
Few weeks later Mary called me from her room in a hotel in the small town. Not a word about sea, or weather, or conference. <br>
&laquo;Last night we had a dinner. And Peter walked in! The band is
playing, people talking, laughing, I suddenly feel an urge to look
towards the door and there he is! Walking in... I'm afraid he's ill. We
are much older, I know - it's him I'm sure &#8211; but so pale and his hair
is gray. He had such great, dark hair.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Yes, you told me that. Well, what happened? Have you talked at last?&raquo;<br>
&laquo;No.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;No?! What are you waiting for? Another forty years?&raquo;<br>
&laquo;You don't understand, it's... well, he just sat there, across
the room and looked at me. I looked at him and then turned my head
away.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;You're crazy.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;I know. Wait, I'm not. It's just, you know, I was among my
colleagues, talking and... I could not just bolt up and attack him.
After all, I'm a lady here, it's his job to stand up and come to
me.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Now I can almost understand what was happening between you two. And?&raquo; <br>
&laquo;He kept looking at me, so I looked there. And he was so sad, and
pale. So sad. It was going on for a while and people started to get on
my nerves, really. Kept asking me something and I really wanted
to...&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Stare at him?&raquo;<br>
&laquo;And then he got up, went to the band and asked for a song.
Singer announced &laquo;This one is for Mary.&raquo; and they started
to play and I tought I'll die. He ordered our song. I was too shocked
to cry. As they played we kept looking at each other. The song finished
and soon after that he got up and went away.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Oh.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;I could not stand this any more. So I went outside too. Not after him, just outside.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Well, thank you God.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;But he wasn't there. Went home I guess. I asked receptionist
about him, but naturally with all those people coming in and out he
couldn't tell... I walked around for a while and the musicians had
their break so I kind of asked them if they are native here and do they
know this gentleman who ordered that song but they couldn't remember
him. They remember playing the song and it was for Mary but couldn't
remember who ordered it. They weren't locals so... The receptionist is
local, I'll ask him tomorrow.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Ask him what?&raquo;<br>
&laquo;If he knows Peter.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;That's silly.&raquo;<br>
And then we talked this over and over, Mary kept complicating the
matter, I kept saying she should call him already. She didn't. She
stayed for the damned conference for few more days, looking around,
hoping, Peter never showed up again, she went home. With heart broken
again. <br>
The situation dragged for about two weeks and we spent small fortune on
phone bills. Finally, Mary looked for his phone number. He wasn't
listed, only his brother Daniel.<br>
&laquo;Maybe he was just visiting that day.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Maybe. Call his brother and ask. He'll be visiting again, right? You can ask, nobody will bite you.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;I'm making a fool out of myself.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Oh, please, call him or forget him.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;I can't forget! I've been trying to forget...&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Then call!&raquo;<br>
And she called. Peter's brother simply and somewhat coldly said there's
no Peter in their house. Mary apologized, ready to hung up when Daniel
said:<br>
&laquo;You wanted to speak to my brother?&raquo; <br>
&laquo;Yes, your brother Peter.&raquo;<br>
&laquo;My brother died in 1982.&raquo;<br>
Mary couldn't speak. She broke into tears, freaking poor Daniel out. He
couldn't just hung up to some strange lady who is crying over the
phone, so he handed the phone to his wife. Without any explanation.
After shocking her too Mary regained self-controll and they had a long
talk. It turned out that Peter never got over Mary. He led a lonely
life, never had any significant relationship, often mentioned
&laquo;Mary&raquo; and how she forgot him. Apparently, Mary had such a
mythical status in Peters life so Daniel and his wife invited Mary to
visit them.<br>
As soon as she finished talking to them she called me and I was quite
shocked to hear that the guy who is ordering songs around is actually
dead. <br>
Mary went back to Peters town, met his family, visited his grave. <br>
&laquo;I hoped he could do that again.&raquo; she told me. But he
didn't appeared this time. Nothing supernatural happened, &laquo;just
the wind made this sound as I was standing there, like someone's
crying. I know it's my imagination.&raquo;<br>
Before she left they gave her Peters diary. After few days of reading
it, she phoned me and said seriously she wants to die. As official
family freak I made speech about &laquo;different concept of time in
afterlife&raquo; (like I can know that) asurring her Peter can wait
some more time. And an angry remark &laquo;Suicide is for cowards,
anyway.&raquo; It took months before she was better. <br>
All this time, as I write, I hear snoring from bedroom. And I don't mind. I really don't.&nbsp; <br>

<br>
Another Experience Regarding My Grandfather<br>
<br>
By: crimson_artist@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
After sharing my last experience I feel compelled to tell you all more, <br>
This one also involves what we perceive to be the spirit or leftover energies of my Grandfather<br>
In this house my sister, brother and I had lived in for many a year
with my Grandparents, unfortunately my Granfather passed on devastating
us all, after this my Grandmother spent a lot of time away from the
house, I believe it was because it was too painful.<br>
Now as anyone in my family can tell you my Grandfather was less than
perfect, being an ex-miner he had very old fashioned beliefs when it
came to women (oddly enough this view was never pushed onto myself he
always pushed me to be strong and stand up for myself) and so he would
expect dinner on the table at 5 o'clock and the t.v to be left for him
to watch before he would have a few drinks and go to sleep (please keep
in mind this was after a hard days working on the house) on one
particular night my Grandmother had caused an argument and my
Grandfather threw his plate across the living room and it smashed
against the wall, sad to say my brother and I had become used to this
kind of event, then the argument continued in the kitchen where he put
his fist through the glass topped table promptly smashing it as well,
now I will always remember this day as being July 20th as it was 2 days
before my birthday,<br>
A year or so after his passing my brother sister and I were sitting in
the living room watching television, we were startled to hear a
smashing sound coming from the very same room, we turned the light on
and looked around, there were no pictures missing from the room and the
Dog had immediatley hid under the coffee table (something he did
whenever my Grandfather used to get mad) My brother shook it off and
said that maybe it was the neighbours having a row and the noise
carried, I agreed and walked into the kitchen to get a drink, I was
more than shocked to see my Grandfathers cup in front of the kettle
with the sugar pot and teabag tin out of the cupboard (we all swear
down that we had not made any warm drinks that night) I put the things
away and put a glass on the table and turned to the fridge to get the
milk, my brother walked into the kitchen and yelped then I heard
another smashing sound, I turned to see the glass I had placed near the
centre of the table (so it had not fallen off by mere chance) smashed
on the floor underneath the table directly below where it had been, as
thought it had fallen through the table, it was then my brother said
July 20th and I remembered that the table my grandfather had broken had
been in exactly the same place, I think that he was so angry that night
that he had left behind some kind of energy that re-enacted the same
event the next year... at least I'd like to beleive this because I
don't think he would purposely scare us.<br>
On another note our family moved and I now live with my Boyfriend, one
night I was lying in bed thinking about whether or not my Grandfather
would have liked my boyfriend (his opinion had always mattered to me
the most) and the smell of tobacco and brandy entered the room and I
felt a huge sadness mixed with happiness in my chest, my boyfriend
asked me what it was because neither of us smoke... and that night I
thought I had dreamt this but maybe it was more, my Grandfather
appeared and I started crying saying I knew he wasn't supposed to be
there, he smiled and nodded and said 'don't worry it's fine' hugged me
and said 'he'll look after you... and that's all I ever wanted.' since
then I have had a strange peace knowing he has passed on and he is
truly happy.<br>

Checking Haunted Places<br>
<br>
By: dancergirl06@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
<br>
My friends and I went to Cypress Valley cemetary in Vilonia,
Arkansas.&nbsp; We come to your site often and have tried out some of
the places and have gotten good response!!&nbsp; <br>
We parked our car out front and went into the gate around 3:00 in the
morning.&nbsp; There were four of us. There were two guys, and then my
best friends and I who are girls.&nbsp; The guys went in first and we
followed soon after.&nbsp; Immediately entering we all had a very
strange feeling come over us.&nbsp; My best friend and I decided to go
back to the car and let the guys walk around and explore some
more.&nbsp; We were alone in the car for nearly 20 minutes with the
windows rolled down because we were smoking when we started hearing
screams from the distance.&nbsp; They sounded like they were coming
from a woman.&nbsp; We saw no one else there.&nbsp; Then a few minutes
later, My best friend saw two men's outlines walking on one end of the
cemetery.&nbsp; She assumed it was our guys so she called their cells
which when they answered the lights from the phones showed us that they
were on the complete opposite end.&nbsp; There is no way they could
have made it over there that quick.&nbsp; <br>
When we finally decided to leave, they got in the car and we sat for a
minute.&nbsp; We had the windows rolled down, but it was about 68
degrees outside so it wasn't cold at all.&nbsp; We all felt as if the
air conditioning was blasting on us, but there was no source of
air.&nbsp; It was very strange.&nbsp; We all felt sick until we got
about 20 miles away.&nbsp; Strange thing kept happening to us later the
next day.&nbsp; <br>
We go "ghost hunting"&nbsp; almost every weekend and have been to many
places and this one was by far the scariest place.&nbsp; It just felt
uneasy.&nbsp; Very Dark.&nbsp; <br>
Just thought I would let you know!!<br>

Cheerios<br>
<br>
By: ninmah@comcast.net<br>
<br>
Hi. My name is Bonnie. I am happy that interest in the paranormal is
becoming more pronounced; I have always been interested in it. I am
writing to recount poltergeist activity I witnessed years ago because
no one I have told has believed me. It all happened in and around the
kitchen in an old house in Hingham, MA.<br>
Water faucets would turn on and off of their own accord, heavy cast iron pans would jump up and down on the stove.<br>
One day I was getting breakfast, and I left an opened box of Cheerios
on the counter. I heard noise, turned around to witness Cheerios
fllying up out of box, and dropping back in. It lasted for a few
minutes, the flying Cheerios, and not one spilled onto the counter.
Another early morning, I looked out the window into the garden. A man
dressed like a 19th century street peddlar (ragged clothes, worn blude
jacket, scarf, and a stovepipe hat) was there, performing some kind of
choreographed movements with his arms, not random movements. I watched
him for a while, turned around; when I looked back he was gone. I have
never heard of poltergeist activity like this.<br>
Anyway, I am glad to have a chance to relate this story to a believer. Thank you for taking the time to read this. <br>

Eagle Falls Ghost in Washington<br>
<br>
By: jillkestle@comcast.net<br>
<br>
<br>
This story is true and happened to me.&nbsp; I have already posted this
on all about Ghosts but, have not yet heard anything about this place
other then my story.&nbsp; <br>
Maybe someone out there has had a similar kind of experience or even Paranormal things happen at this place.&nbsp; <br>
What made me want to add my story here is when I read the story about
Tacoma - Point Defiance Park -5 Mile drive, this story grabbed me and
was almost disturbing to me because it is so closely related to mine
about a little girl <br>
looking real except having no eyes and smiling then disappears.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was <br>
searching here to see if there was anything from my spot at Eagle Falls.<br>
July 27/2003<br>
Skykomish River Ghost<br>
Eagle Falls off Hwy 2 Cascade loop a few miles past Mt index WA<br>
To see a picture of Falls goto<br>
http://inlinethumb27.webshots.com/19610/2874840070094505640S600x600Q85.jpg<br>
I went to this favorite swimming hole of mine on the Skykomish River.&nbsp; This is <br>
a very beautiful swimming hole, almost lagoon like, where the river flows with <br>
falls into a pool of deep colorful water and under the water on the side of the <br>
walls there are huge giant flat rocks that drop off down where you cannot see <br>
the bottom.&nbsp; The Rocks above have been carved into stair like settings that <br>
become flat and then go down into where the river wall is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the river <br>
which is only about 50 feet or so there are rocks where people can climb to.&nbsp; <br>
There is a rope swing tide to a tree on this side also.&nbsp; It is a popular spot <br>
for people to swim in the summer.&nbsp; I particularly like this place for swimming <br>
and floating on my raft with flippers so I can move faster to swim up the <br>
currants to the falls better and ride the river down.&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to my <br>
story.&nbsp; I was headed towards the place where I was going to do just that and <br>
noticed there were two people to the right of me a man and a w<br>
omen one sitting next to the rope swing and the other climbing up the rocks, and <br>
to the left of me there was this little girl about 6 or 7 years old standing <br>
about 3 feet away from me on the edge of the rock by the water with her head <br>
turned slightly and just smiling at me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am swimming still almost to passing <br>
her and notice she is still smiling so I smiled, waved to her and said hi, she <br>
still smiles at me but says nothing back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at her again this time <br>
into her eyes, we had our eyes locked for a second and that is when I noticed <br>
her eyes were very dark to the point where I could not see her eye color they <br>
only looked like black holes almost hollow like.&nbsp; Everything about this girl <br>
seemed normal except for her eyes, she had a cute little swimsuit that was lime <br>
green with little white flowers on it and a little ruffle around the waste, she <br>
was tan and had golden blonde shiny hair that came down past her shoulders and <br>
also had bare feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was alone, there was nobody<br>
&nbsp;above her or next to her.&nbsp; I was thinking maybe she was standing there watching <br>
her mother swing from the rope swing or something but as I swim a little bit <br>
past her I suddenly turned to look back because I feared her being to close to <br>
the edge and wanted to let her know to step back but as I turned to do this she <br>
was gone.&nbsp; Now I was wondering how she could climb the rocks that quickly and <br>
how she could be completely out of sight when I only turned for a second then <br>
looked back, surely I would of noticed her walking away at least if she did <br>
climb the rocks or even if she had fallen in, I would of heard the sound of <br>
water splashing.&nbsp; I was only a few feet away from where she was standing and I <br>
quickly went to the area where I saw her and nothing I looked above and further <br>
back where some people were sitting by some trees and looked down along the <br>
banks where some other people were sitting and with kids and none looked like <br>
her or had blonde golden hair or the same bathing suit on.<br>
&nbsp; At this point of feeling very confused I felt a cold chill come over me and my <br>
hairs on my arms were standing up.&nbsp; I felt a sadness and chilling feeling and <br>
had a vision of that same girl falling into the water and drowning.&nbsp; I even felt <br>
some pain and a little bit of anger type emotions right there where she stood <br>
while I was still trying to see if I could find her.&nbsp; I thought where were her <br>
parents? Why was she all alone?&nbsp; So I swam back to my spot by the river and told <br>
a friend I was with what happened and I pointed to the rock she was on.&nbsp; He said <br>
it sounded and even looked like I saw a ghost from the way I was acting.&nbsp; I <br>
asked him if he would go back with me to look for her and he said no way that is <br>
to creepy I don&#8217;t want go over there with you.&nbsp; I am thinking this is crazy and <br>
in daylight even.&nbsp; I am going back to see if I see her I said; determined to <br>
find her I swam back to the spot where it happened and looked all over the area <br>
where people were sitting and still no litt<br>
le girl in a green bathing suite.&nbsp; I started looking in the water to see if I <br>
could see anything down there, nothing.&nbsp; And the girl across the river that I <br>
thought was her mother was not she was with the guy on the rocks still.&nbsp; Then <br>
again I get the chill and I am feeling sad and start becoming afraid of this <br>
spot and swim away from it again, thinking this doesn&#8217;t make any sense then <br>
wondering if I am the only one who saw her, did the people across the river see <br>
her?&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a wide visible area where you can see everyone around you, am I <br>
losing it?&nbsp; Then I remembered those eyes she had were actually hollow, the smile <br>
she made and just kept smiling at me, how she didn&#8217;t move from the time I swam <br>
towards her stopped, made eye contact, said hi then kept swimming only a few <br>
feet further then turned around to say she was to close to the edge or where is <br>
your mother, somebody should be with you.&nbsp; I truly believe what I saw was an <br>
entity of some sort and perhaps a little girl might of fell into the river and drowned <br>
right where she was standing.&nbsp; I have heard some stories from here of people <br>
dying at this spot by swinging from the rope swings <br>
and jumping from the high cliffs which happened right across from where she was.&nbsp; <br>
I also believe I would not be so disturbed by this if it all seemed normal but <br>
it didn&#8217;t and for some reason she didn&#8217;t seem to fit in.&nbsp; I wrote to ease my <br>
mind and maybe to just get it out somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp; If anything at all I will probably <br>
never know why she picked me to see her but I will never forget what she looked <br>
liked or how she stared at me and smiled for so long.&nbsp; Maybe she was looking out <br>
for people swimming in the river, who knows; well this is the end of my story.&nbsp; <br>

Fiddlers Green<br>
<br>
By: amber-0792@hotmail.co.uk<br>
<br>
Up until I was around ten, my mum, sister, dad and I lived in a house
called Fiddler's Green, which was in Lanner, Cornwall. The house must
have been around fifty years old, and was originally two cottages
joined together, meaning it was fairly big. To begin, the only things
that would happen would be the odd cold spot, and often I felt like I
was being watched. Another time my mum went to use the downstairs
bathroom, leaving my dad in the kitchen, when she heard a man cough
loudly outside the door. Thinking it was my dad using the study, she
shouted something, only to hear no reply. When she left the bathroom,
there was no one outside, or in the study. When she went back to the
kitchen my dad was at the same place. She asked him if he had followed
her to the bathroom, which incidentally wasn't near the kitchen, and he
said he hadn't moved. There was no one else in the house at the time
apart from me and my sister, and we were in bed. Another thing that
happened was when my mum, my dad, and my dad's friend were sat in the
kitchen late one night, when they suddenly heard an almighty crash from
my bedroom upstairs. My mum says it sounded like a full grown adult
being thrown to the floor. Thinking maybe my wardrobe had toppled over,
or I'd fallen heavily out of bed, they ran upstairs and found me fast
asleep, with nothing out of place. Later on they even got someone to
check the chimney in my room, to see if a stone had fallen down it, but
they found nothing. To this day, we don't know what that crash was, or
indeed, who made it. The most unexplained incident, however, was the
sound of a singing lady. My mum and dad were asleep in bed and they
were woken by a tuneless humming outside their bedroom door. There was
no way it would have been me or my sister, as we were only young and it
was quite clearly the sound of a woman. The sound came along the
corridoor, from my room, and gradually disappeared downstairs. Another
time, my mum, sister and I were inside my mum and dad's bedroom,
helping my mum fold up some laundry. My dad was outside mowing the
lawn, and we could see him from the room. After we'd finished, we went
to open the bedroom door, which was shut. We couldn't get out. The door
had no lock on it, and wasn't jammed. There was no draft in the room as
it was an airless summer's day. It felt like someone was standing
outside holding onto the handle to prevent us from leaving. My mum, who
was obviously stronger then me and my sister, tried the door too, but
there was no luck. In the end we had to shout outside to my dad to come
and let us out. He opened the door easily, and there was no sign of it
ever being stuck. We left that house when my parents seperated, and I
found out from someone that knew the current inhabitants that they too
were experiencing strange things, such as their child's toys being
turned on and off during the night.<br>

Saint Francis Hospital<br>
<br>
By: softballmsw@insightbb.com <br>
<br>
I have worked at Saint Francis Hospital in Peoria Illinois for over 20
years.&nbsp; I have seen one of the nun ghosts on the 7th floor where
the laboratory was when I worked there.&nbsp; The morgue was also on
that floor.<br>
I was working third shift one night as a phlebotomist.&nbsp; At times,
we took the back elevator, (service elevator), to the floors to draw
labs when needed.&nbsp; As I was walking down the hall to the elevator,
I saw a nun getting on to the elevator.&nbsp; I yelled out to her, "
Please hold the elevator Sister."&nbsp; The door started closing.&nbsp;
Thinking she did not hear me, I hit the down button as it closed.&nbsp;
The door opened up but there was no one on the elevator.&nbsp; There
was no where else she could have gone for it was a dead end
hallway.&nbsp; To take the stairs, she would have had to walk past me.<br>
This was a strange night and took place many years ago.<br>

Ghost<br>

My father died here at the family farm, 9-8-85. I have a friend who
slept over with her children one weekend, in 2004. She had never met my
father, but describes a man of his description, shaking her shoulder
and awakening her. He said something to her, and also stood and watched
her. I also credit his presence in October 2004, when my exhusband set
fire to our house. I know that my father was there, and kept the fire
from flaring and burning down the house. We only had smoke damage, and
minor fire damage in one room. It smoldered all day, and the fireman
could not figure out why it did not burn down.<br>

Ghostly Encounters<br>
<br>
By: riverqueensaloon@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
On March 14, 2001, my husband died of lung cancer, at home.<br>
His presence is still being felt, in the home and the bar, next door,
that we own. He messes with the Jukebox, people who are working when no
one else is around, and at the house, he can hold me when I sit in his
place, flys in the bathroom window, but no where else. Light orbs on
the walls, and moving things around. He is not bothering anyone, but we
kind of like having him around. On Monday, Feb. 25, 2008. A new spirit
appeared, of a friend, maybe, that just passed away. She had white
hair, and stood right in my bartender's face. That was a little spooky,
but there may be several spirits, who are there.<br>

Grandfather<br>
<br>
By: crimson_artist@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
Here is one of my stories of paranormal activity.<br>
From being very young my brother and I had always experienced things we
knew were not normal, but of course our Grandparents (whom we had lived
with since we can remember) brushed it off as childish imagination, as
did we as we grew up we saw less and less unusual happenings. <br>
It all began again when I was 15 years old (my brother at this time was
17) and our Grandfather had passed away, my entire family reported
seeing him the night after he passed away, now my family has its
sceptics and its believers and everyone of them reported seeing him
laughing and looking much younger and healthier than they had ever
remembered, he smiled at them all and said goodbye, now my brother and
I had not seen this apparition, so we brushed it off as their
subconscious projecting an image they all wanted to see. Of course we
were believers, but we thought if anyone would have seen him it would
have been us for we had been there for him when nobody else had been.<br>
Well our thoughts came to reality one night around 5 months after his
passing and this supposed collective haunting, my brother and I were up
in his room playing on the p.c my grandmother was out and my little
sister in bed, now my Grandfather (or Dadi as was his nickname) always
enjoyed his music and always had it on extremely loud, we were laughing
at something or other on the internet when 'John Lennon: Imagine' began
playing very loudly downstairs... well at first we thought it was a
cruel joke by our neighbours (this particular song had been his first
choice for his cremation) and so I being the braver of us stormed
downstairs to find it was indeed coming from the office room that was
my grandfathers, I walked into his old room to find it was freezing and
there were no windows or doors open and the CD player was not on and
the music was still going, then there was a knock on the back door
(usually our neighbours used our back door) and the music stopped, my
brother was now downstairs with me and we thought that it must be one
of our neighbours there to complain about the noise so he unlocked and
opened the door, (opposite the door was an outside toilet) and as my
brother opened the door he froze, his face paled and I could tell there
was something wrong, I looked outside to see nothing but incredibely
shaken by the music I slammed and locked the door, turned every light
on in the house (bar my sisters as she was seemingly sound asleep) and
sat downstairs waiting for my grandmother, to this day my brother will
not tell me what he saw outside... but I doubt it was the friendly
spirit of my grandfather coming to say goodbye... the reason I believe
this is because the morning after my little sister said 'do you believe
in ghosts?' I didnt react and merely asked 'why?' she then replied that
the night before 'Dadi' had been in her room when she was crying about
his passing telling her to shush that everything was ok and he was
happy... also my neighbours (who were really quick to complain) never
mentioned any loud music coming from our house so I really want to know
why only us heard this music and more importantly... who had been
outside when my brother had opened the door?<br>

Haunted House in Ar.<br>
<br>
By: winnmill@windstream.net <br>
<br>
There is a two-story house right in the center of town that I lived in in 1958 or <br>
1959. It is known as the Old Van Dalsem House. Both my cousin and I
experienced odd things in that house. There were many times that we
would hear footsteps (such as a man wearing boots) walking from the
up-stairs front<br>
Bedroom toward the back bedroom to the left of the stairs. <br>
My cousin also said she saw an old woman in the back yard. <br>
I went to see the psychic Carol Pate this week and showed her a picture
of the house. She said she felt it was a soldier from the Civil War
era. Also she said that many horrible things happened on the property.
No one ever died in the house, so it is connected with the land it sits
on. We stayed there only about two or three months and moved to another
location in the same town. <br>
I also found out that I am a psychic medium (have had many unexplained<br>
Things happen through the years.) This soldier is not threatening- he
does not know he is dead. Wish the house was mine so I could try to
help him.<br>
All this has been burned in my memory for nearly 50 years.<br>

Haunted School<br>
<br>
By: egfgold@cfl.rr.com<br>
<br>
I used to work at the Kreamer Elementary school in Bellport, NY on Long
Island.&nbsp; There were numerous siting's of a young boy in the second
grade hallway by myself, another nighttime custodian and a first grade
teacher.&nbsp; He had very strong powers, He pushed a door closed
behind me while I was cleaning bathrooms one night and caused me to
stumble and dump a bucket full of cleaning solution down the front of
me.&nbsp; I yelled at him that it wasn't funny, to stop this game and I
could hear him giggle at me.&nbsp; When we would lock up at 11:30
p.m.&nbsp; I would look back into the building and down the main
hallway and I saw his shadow run across the hall, I actually thought we
locked up a student in the building the first time.&nbsp; The other
custodian, who had worked there for twelve years told me not to worry
about it "He lived there"&nbsp; It totally spooked me because this guy
was not the ghost believing kind.&nbsp; We decided that the boy,
because he was so young,&nbsp; hadn't gone to the light yet and told
him to do so.&nbsp; His spirit left.&nbsp; After about a month he
returned but was calmer and not so spiteful with less powers.&nbsp; The
teacher investigated at the local library on micro films and there was
a second grade boy named Roosevelt that died of a brain tumor the year
he went to school there.&nbsp; They actually planted a tree in the
courtyard in his honor the year he died.&nbsp; I always felt him around
and no one that worked there that I told about him ever questioned the
story because they too had experiences they couldn't explain and felt a
presence too.&nbsp; I would swear to this story because I know it to be
true.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.<br>

Hauntings in Fulton Co.<br>
<br>
By: zalucki_stylz@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
The Union Cumberland Church Cemetary on Union Cumberland Church Road also known as State Route 1125<br>
I grew up on this road.&nbsp; My brother and i used to walk the road at
night.&nbsp; Us and some other kids that lived on the road used to dare
each other to go into the graveyard at night.&nbsp; The graveyard was
quiet during the day and I had walked through it often.&nbsp; The first
night something strange happened I noticed strange lights dancing in
the back row of the cemetary.&nbsp; Over the years I have seen the
ghosts of a little boy, a young woman, and numerous other
unrecognizable spirits.&nbsp; I am now grown and I have moved off of
the road but I still live in the area and during the summer months me
and my husband still visit the graveyard.&nbsp; I haven't seen any
spirits of substance but I have seen the lights and my husband and I
have both seen white mist floating above some of the older graves.<br>
This is not the only report of hauntings on this road. <br>
The house I grew up in, also located on union cumberland church road,
was haunted by my great grandmother on my mother's side.&nbsp; The
house was her house until she moved to just a mile down the road.&nbsp;
She was closer to my mother than anyone.&nbsp; Once she died my mother
was devastated.&nbsp; About a year after her death strange things
started happening at our house.&nbsp; The front door would open by
itself, the tv would turn on and off by itself and the volume would
turn up and down (this was one of the old floor tvs that did not have a
remote).&nbsp; Eventually my grandmother started appearing to us but
she only played her "jokes" on people she didn't like before she
died.&nbsp; Around five years after she first appeared to us my mom was
getting ready for bed one night.&nbsp; She set down on the bed and
started reading her bible.&nbsp; Her grandmother appeared and set down
on the bed beside her.&nbsp; She told my mom that my mom would be okay
now and it was time for her to go home.&nbsp; We never saw her again
after that night.<br>
Another well known haunting in my town is that of my local high school,
Fulton City High School.&nbsp; I have first hand accounts from teachers
and custodians of the haunting which I will pass on to you once I find
the newspaper article.<br>

I Feel His Presence<br>
<br>
By: ginnyjerry80@snowcrest.net<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know if this qualifies as a 'haunting,' per se.&nbsp; My
husband passed away last April 28, and of course, since I am alone in
our house, I feel his presence everywhere.&nbsp; This is not unusual, I
know. I have had a couple of unexplainable occurences, though.&nbsp;
The first one: whenever I remove the bed linens for laundering, I take
a pillowcase and completely dust the entire wooden headboard of my bed,
picking up the few items I keep there and replacing them after
dusting.&nbsp; One night, after I'd done that, I got into bed and found
a shiny dime placed right in the middle of my side of the headboard. (I
don't keep money in my room).&nbsp; I picked it up and it actually felt
warm to the touch. The date on it was 1980, which is the year my
husband and I were married.&nbsp; This incident actually occurred on
June 26, which would have been our 27th wedding anniversary.&nbsp; The
second incident happened about two months later.&nbsp; I was walking in
my driveway, thinking about whether I should try to sell my late
husband's new truck by myself or let the local dealer sell it on
consignment, when I heard what sounded like a coin fall out of my
pocket.&nbsp; There on the ground was a new-looking penny, again dated
1980.&nbsp; I picked it up to put it back in my pocket--then realized
my pants had no pockets, and I hadn't been carrying any coins
anyway.&nbsp; I kind of smiled to myself, thinking of those cute
"pennies from heaven" stories I'd read (not believing in them
myself.)&nbsp; I put the coin in a small 'memory urn' I bought to keep
beside my husband's ashes.&nbsp; It contains a few treasured keepsakes,
including our wedding bands.&nbsp; A couple of weeks later, I was
pulling wet laundry from the washing machine when I again heard a coin
fall, this time inside the machine itself.&nbsp; It was that penny, or
one with the same year.&nbsp; I thought I'd forgotten to put it into
the little urn when I'd meant to a couple of weeks before, so I went
right into the house, opened the memory urn--and there was that first
1980 penny.&nbsp; Again, I'm not sure these incidences qualify as a
'haunting,' just odd things that I cannot explain away.&nbsp; I am a
believer in the paranormal, albeit a somewhat sceptical one.<br>

I Lived in a Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: julesgriswald@yahoo.com<br>
Ponca City, OK - A house I used to own was haunted.&nbsp; It was a very
small house so you could hear everything that went on from my
bedroom.&nbsp; I've heard footsteps walking across the living room and
kitchen when I was the only one home.&nbsp; I'd see the ghost of a lady
(maybe in her mid 40's) with long curly dark hair, in my bedroom
several times.&nbsp; She would always just be standing there watching
me.&nbsp; Once I woke in the middle of the night and she was sitting on
my bed watching me.&nbsp; She always looked very mean!&nbsp; Scared the
crap out of me.&nbsp; My daughter (who was about 4) got out of bed and
wanted to sleep with me one night.&nbsp; When she got to my bed she
wanted to know who the mean lady was in the corner watching us.&nbsp; I
told her it was just the shadows.&nbsp; My small son also saw her in
the living room one night.&nbsp; He thought she was me.&nbsp; I know of
only one man who died in the house.&nbsp; He was my ex-husband
grandfather.&nbsp; The house was his and we bought it after he
died.&nbsp; I don't think it was him haunting the house.&nbsp; <br>

"I Love You"<br>
<br>
By: deadmen327@gmail.com<br>
<br>
This is another series of events that happened just last year.<br>
The first person to experience it was my sister. The day after visiting
my grandma's grave for the first time, as she was getting into her car
she noticed that someone had written "I love you" in a heart in the
dust of the dashboard of her truck. My sister automatically knew
something was weird since she has the only key for the car.<br>
The day after that, when my mom came back into her classroom after
lunch, she looked at her computer screen and in the dust on that it had
the same thing. My mom knew something was up since her room was locked
and no custodians were there that day.<br>
The final event that happened was one night, about 2 or 3 weeks before
Christmas, when we were coming back from a trip to Disneyland. Since it
was late, my sister, her boyfriend, and I all fell asleep in the
backseat, as did my mom in the passenger seat. When we all woke up, my
sister quickly noticed that on the window, in the fog that appeared on
it due to our heavy breathing, someone wrote "I love you" in a heart.<br>
Since no one was awake, except my dad who was driving, we all automatically thought it was my grandma.<br>

III Corps Headquarters Building (UNCLASSIFIED)<br>
<br>
By: vwhalen@earthlink.net<br>
I have been working in the III Corps Headquarters Building now for 5
years. For the past 3 years I have been working swing shifts so half
the time I am working at nights and until recently I have been working
mostly alone. When I am working alone at night I like turning off all
of the main overhead lights and only having a few smaller lights on
along with the computers. I also work in a secured area which means I
am behind locked doors with a security system that allows me to hear
and see anyone approaching my location. I know if there is anyone else
at my place of work or not. Our floors have metal plating underneath
the carpet so we are able to hear anyone walking up and down the
hallways and we can tell which way they are traveling. <br>
Late at night I will be working on my computer and I will hear somebody
walking around in the hallway or in another room. I know I am the only
person here so I would get up and investigate to see who else is here.
I search the area many times and I have never been able to find anyone
around. The air here in the basement is usually warm with no movement
at all but I have walked into cold spots and got goose bumps on my arms
and think nothing about it. Once I go back to my computer I will hear
the footsteps again and again until either I get up and go looking for
who is making the sounds, or until around 3 to 4 in the morning and
they will stop for the rest of the night. This does not happen every
night just every so often. I also have asked other people who works
here and when they are alone they too hear the footsteps. But they tell
me after a few times they started leaving all the lights on and made
sure there where other loud noises so they could not here the
footsteps. <br>
Last year around November I found the Texas Ghost Hunters &amp; The
Shadowlands web sites and I found out that our security guards had
reported strange things that have been happening to them during their
building inspections. I started asking all of the guard&#8217;s one at a time
and by ourselves to insure they would not be able to talk to each other
and come up with the same story. I found out most of the incidents that
accrued happened separately and over duration of time but for the most
part the incidents were the same. When the interviews were over I made
arrangements for one of the guards to walk through the building with
myself.<br>
Around 1:30 in the morning we went to the upper floor. We were walking
in the hallway when the air started to get thick, it was harder to
breath and the air was cold. Both of us stopped at the same time and I
looked at the guard and notice that he was grabbing his chest and
looking nerves. I asked him what was he feeling and he told me the same
thing that I was feeling. I told him to take a few step back and then
he started filling normal so I did the same thing. By stepping in and
out of the area I was able to find out is was just a small area that
was cold and it was slowly moving. Eventually it went away and we
continued on. We then saw a black figure at the end of the hallway; it
looked to be about 4 feet tall. We compared the height off the wall it
went by and then compared it to ourselves. This location was by an area
that we are able to see from the top floor to the bottom. We tried to
catch up to the black figure but it was quick and by the time we got to
the end of the hall it was gone. We then saw another black figure on
the second floor for a few seconds before it disappeared as well. I
wanted to continue on but the guard refused and he wanted to leave the
area so we left.<br>
This is not he first time I have seen or dealt with these black figures
but this time it has intrigue myself enough so I want to start a Ghost
Hunting group in the Copperas Cove area so I can continue the
investigations. The next time I will have documented proof either way.
I would like to go out with another group that are already established
and maybe pick up some pointers before I start my local group. If any
group would take me out of a few investigations please contact me.<br>

My Encounters with the Supernatural<br>
Brooklyn, New York<br>
By:&nbsp; bayviewboy@hotmail.com<br>
My first encounter with the supernatural happened when I was just a
toddler. My parents and I were living in a small apartment on the first
floor of an old two-story house in Brooklyn, New York. I remembered
being in a crib and looking at the wall opposite my crib. I could see
something that appeared to be a window to another world. I could see a
beautiful landscape of green grass and trees and rolling hills with
people walking around. I would see this on separate occasions. I cannot
remember any specific details or who the people were but they would be
moving around this landscape continuously. I don&#8217;t remember feeling any
fear from what I was seeing. When I related this to my mother as an
adult she said that now she knew why I was always pointing to that
wall. To this day I can find no explanation for what I saw and why.<br>
As a teenager living in a three-story brownstone house on Bergen Street
I remember one night being wakened up and hearing my mother choking in
bed. She was trying to tell us that she could feel two ghostly hands
trying to choke her to death. As she struggled with this unseen force
she would kick and try to scream. My father being an ordained minister
at the time started to fervently pray out loud over her and after what
seemed an eternity the unseen hands let my mother&#8217;s throat go and my
mother was able to breathe and calm down. We later learned that a woman
who was renting a small room upstairs had her room full of all kinds of
idols, candles and occultic paraphernalia. Needless to say she was
politely asked to move the next day. <br>
Puerto Rico<br>
As a pre-teen I occasionally would take trips to Puerto Rico with my
mother to visit my grandmother and aunt. They lived in a small country
mountain community called Monte Bello which in English means &#8220;beautiful
mountain&#8221;. One night I stayed at my aunt&#8217;s house and slept on a couch
in the living room. The house was mostly made of wood and faced a main
road. The couch I slept on was very near the front door of the house.
All of a sudden in the middle of the night I was awakened by noises of
chairs being moved in the kitchen. Everybody was asleep and the only
other two people in the house were my aunt and cousin. The noises
stopped and I quickly went off to sleep again. I then was awakened one
more time to noises of chairs being moved around. This time the sound
was coming from the front porch of the house. I remember peeping
through a small hole in the door leading to the front porch and seeing
no one out there. The next few nights I started getting these asthma
attacks that didn&#8217;t go away until I left Puerto Rico. <br>
Viet Nam<br>
I was stationed in a little support base in the mountains of&nbsp; Duc
Pho way up north of South Vietnam. I worked in the Colonel&#8217;s mess hall
that prepared meals for the officers of the base. It was part of the
Jungle Brigade of the Americal Division. It was an infantry unit that
had helicopter support for troops going out on patrol. We lived in what
were called &#8220;hootches&#8221; surrounded by piles and piles of sandbags for
protection from incoming rockets and mortars. It seemed like a ghost or
malevolent being was haunting our compound. There would be shadowy
figures lurking around, reports of rapping&#8217;s, whispers and things that
went bump in the night. On one occasion as I was taking a shower in one
of the stalls I heard someone come in the door, turn on one of the
showers but when I went to look around there was no one there.&nbsp; We
finally decided we had had enough and scheduled a s&eacute;ance in the
dining room of the mess hall. It was after hours and there may have
been six or seven of us there. Three of us decided to observe from a
safe distance. We were in total darkness when we saw this white glow in
the shape of a person hovering above the s&eacute;ance table. Needless
to say everyone ran out of there except for one soldier who was having
a conversation with his &#8220;dearly departed mother&#8221;. With all the death
and dying and pagan religions of that area it was no surprise that
these manifestations occurred on a regular basis.<br>
San Antonio, Texas<br>
While living in San Antonio I worked for a group called the Criminal
Justice Information System. This group developed a system that was
similar to the NCIC Criminal Justice Information System used on a
national basis. I had been assigned to the county jail to code
information from the files of the identification section onto the
computer. I later trained new people on this coding system in an old
building across from the Bexar County Courthouse. This building was
known as the Legal Professional building which in the 1920&#8217;s used to be
a police station. One day as we were taking a break from the class I
remember sitting at a desk and my hand suddenly took a life of its own
and grabbed a pen that was nearby. It started writing under its own
power on this sheet of paper. It wrote only one word: &#8220;MANGEL&#8221;. To this
day I don&#8217;t know what the word meant and have found no one that did.
Perhaps it had something to do with the history of this old building.
After this I never had another bout of automatic handwriting.<br>
Vineland, New Jersey<br>
One day while living on East Avenue in our old house we were watching a
special program on Hollywood ghosts in our basement. This part of the
show was featuring the hosts of the show with some guests in a live
s&eacute;ance. Apparently they were trying to conjure up some old
Hollywood ghosts. All of a sudden we heard this crashing popping noise
come from upstairs. We all ran up the stairs to find that one of the
bulbs in one of the lamps in the living room had burst. There were
pieces of glass all over the place. I later read that this is usually a
sign of Poltergeist activity. Somehow by watching that show it opened
up a doorway to demonic forces. We never again watched this type of
show in our house.<br>
On another occasion I came home from work around 1:30 in the morning.
Everyone was asleep and I had the habit of lighting a scented candle in
the dining room. We had a small dog that slept in the kitchen adjacent
to the dining room and sometimes his scent drifted into the dining
room. Well after I lit the candle I went downstairs to my room to take
my clothes off and prepare for a shower. When I walked through the
dining room I noticed the candle was no longer lit. I thought maybe it
was a draft coming into the dining room that blew it out. This was an
old house and was very drafty. I proceeded to light the candle again
and went to the bathroom to take a shower. When I was done with my
shower and came through the dining room again the candle was no longer
lit. So not thinking about anything I lit the candle again and went
downstairs. I came upstairs again and lo and behold the candle was out
again. I finally gave up lighting the candle and said to myself that
someone or something didn&#8217;t want that candle lit. So after that day I
never lit another candle during the night again.<br>
One day in the same house I was outside doing something in the yard and
I remember standing just outside of one of the dining room windows when
all of a sudden I hear a woman call me by my childhood name that only
my mother and wife knew. The voice was as clear as if someone had been
standing right beside me or in the window. I turned around and saw no
one. My mother lives in Florida and my wife wasn&#8217;t home.<br>
Another time I was half awake in bed in the bedroom in the basement and
I had my left foot exposed. I felt someone very gently touch my big toe
with their thumb and forefinger. When I looked up there was no one
there.<br>
Minnesota<br>
My wife Julie was the one that experienced what I&#8217;m about to relate to
you but since I was in the same room I decided to include this
too.&nbsp; It was on a bus trip that we took with a local church group
that we had this experience. We were visiting the Mall of America and
we were staying at the Thunderbird Inn motel. The theme and decor was
all Native American and it was located right across from the mall. Well
one night as I was sleeping soundly my wife who was in the next bed
with my daughter said she felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed
on her side. She thought that my daughter or me had gotten up for some
reason and sat next to her. To my wife&#8217;s surprise we were both in bed
fast asleep. As she looked in the direction of where that someone was
sitting what she saw horrified her. She saw this black thing sitting on
the edge of the bed. She described it as a shadowy black hooded figure.
My wife being a devout Christian blurted out the name of Jesus. No
sooner had she said this that the figure got up and just went right
through the door (without opening it). Needless to say it took her a
long time to fall asleep after that even with the lights on the rest of
the night.&nbsp; <br>

My First Paranormal Experience: Pirate Ghost or Mischievous Ghost?<br>
<br>
By: nicoleabonito@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Last night started as an ordinary night excpet for one thing, and that
was the fact that my best friend Peaches was sleeping over for the
first time. <br>
My 7-year old son Nicholas was in the shower singing happily, Peaches
was lying on the couch downstairs because she was feeling ill, while I
was upstairs in my son's bedroom picking out books for bedtime. <br>
I chose Spooky Hour, a Halloween-type book for Nicholas to read because
it was simple enough for him to get through (in addition, he is drawn
to Gothic or paranormal stories about ghosts or aliens, UFOs, etc.).
Just for some additional background, my son also told me when he was 6
that he was a pirate in his last life. I don't even know where he got
the idea of reincarnation.<br>
So, I had Spooky Hour in one hand, and then picked up a story book
called Flying Sails written in 1920 in my other. This book is one in a
series of old books that my mom bought from a library years ago,
adorned with beautiful illustrations typical of that era. This
particular book was sea-themed with stories such as Gulliver's Travels.
<br>
So, I was thumbing through Flying Sails, trying to find a short one
because they all seemed to be a little too lengthy for a bedtime story.
I was not deeply involved in reading it, I was only flipping through it
looking at the length.&nbsp; (I was not distracted and was completly
aware of my surroundings).<br>
Then, as I was about to put it down and choose another book, all of a sudden the overhead light went out. <br>
I knew instantly it was not a power surge because the nightlight was
still on, and I could see my bedroom light was on and hear the TV
downstairs. <br>
My second spontaneous thought was that the bulb burned out, but I knew
that wasn't the case because I did not hear that Pop! or see the blink
of the light go out.<br>
I then looked at the wall where the light switch was and noticed that
the switch was, to my surprise, in the down, or "off" position. This
was not a loose switch. In fact, I tested it right then and there. Not
only was it a new, tight switch, but it also makes a click sound, which
I would like to add, I did not hear when the light went off while I was
looking through the book. Then I felt a chill go down my spine. <br>
I wasnt scared, but I felt I needed to go tell my friend about it
because she is very much into ghost-hunting. I would like to add that
we had not been discussing ghosts all day so it was not at all in my
mind at the time of this occurrence (this was not due to an overly
active imagination).<br>
Calmly, I walked down the stairs and went up to her and said "I think there is a ghost in Nicholas' room."<br>
Peaches said she wanted to go into his room so she did, and laid on the
floor with the books on her stomach. I left her alone for a few minutes
and then she called me in and asked if she looked like anyone had
touched her. I told her that her chest was bright red like it was
sunburned and her right cheek was too. She told me that she had felt
some pain there. <br>
Because I had told her about Nicholas' previous life as a pirate, her
theory was that this ghost was a pirate from my son's past, like maybe
this was the Captain of the ship he was on and he had to fight him to
be Captain of the ship. <br>
When my son got out of the shower, I asked him if he remembered telling
me about being a pirate and he said yes. I asked him if he wanted to be
Captain of the ship and he said 'I WAS the Captain." I asked him if he
would want to be a pirate today if he could. His answer was, "No,
because I don't want to die that early." He said this very matter of
factly like it was the most normal conversation in the world for a
mother and son to have. <br>
I changed the subject and we read our bedtime stories ( I chose a
different book by the way to read to him) and then we went to bed. He
woke me up in the middle of the night to tuck him back in because his
covers fell off, but all and all, it was pretty much a normal night
from that point on. <br>
This morning after my son left with his father, Peaches insisted on
performing some sort of ceremony burning rosemary in his room, and told
the ghost that it is welcome to stay as long as it does not harm us.
She had pictures out of my son and me, and talked to the ghost about
how Nicholas is a 7 year old boy and to leave him alone.<br>
I hope he/she was listening! I guess we will see.<br>

My Ghostly Encounter<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; o0longlegz0o@hotmail.com<br>
I was staying at a friends house in Dampier Western Australia. I love
reading the real life ghost stories. One thing that scares me more than
most things is the thought of a ghostly encounter I have been terrified
of them all my life have felt Like I've been watched I don't like
walking down hall ways without lights on that sort of thing I think
most of it has been a over active imagination. I have always had strong
dreams and I feel very comfortable with nature. <br>
So. I grew up in Karratha which is a 15min drive from Dampier. It is a
mining town and there is a lot of aboriginal history there. My father
and I spent a lot of time fishing and four wheel driving.<br>
&nbsp;I am not religious nor is my father but I have always been close
with the land, have a lot of respect for it and found a lot of beauty
in it too. It has fed us when we were short on money and provided loads
of entertainment and memories. <br>
The town has big red hills on one side and the ocean on the other. It is a beautiful place. <br>
I left town to move to the big city about 7 years ago (I always felt
like the hills missed me) and came back up for work and stayed at a
friends house in Dampier. <br>
The house over looked the ocean and was right next to a big gully that has a lot of indigenous carvings and rocks. <br>
I staying in the lounge room which was at the front of the house with
the front door opening to it. I kept thinking I saw a tall dark man
with no shirt on in the corner of my eye. Around the front door and on
the front patio. I though I had imagined it the first few times but as
my stay moved on I kept seeing him. I could feel more than anything,
that he was from the gully across the road and he was friendly, Maybe
lost and maybe scared or probably confused. <br>
One night that everyone was in bed I turned off the TV and just before
I flicked the switch I saw him again just a flicker in the corner of my
eye.<br>
&nbsp;I was scared not that I thought he'd hurt me just the whole real ghost thing. <br>
I said to him out loud." I am scared, and I want to help you, please
don't hurt me and if you are lonely you can sleep here next to me." Now
I have a lot of indigenous friends and their saliva smells different,
not bad, just distinct like one flower smells different from another
that sort of difference.<br>
&nbsp;I went to sleep after I spoke to him I had work the next day and
I'd told him what I needed to, so he knew, I knew he was there and he
was welcome. but I was confused just like him. The whole night that I
slept I could smell his breath like he was asleep next to me and facing
me while he slept. I still saw him a few times before I left. I don't
know why he searched for me maybe he used to watch me play when I was
young. I don't know but it was a positive experience. I think
communication is important with ghost situations. I'm sure everything
situation is different but you and the spirit both need to know what is
and is not accepted and how you both feel. Thankyou for reading this. <br>

My Ghosts, My Friends<br>
<br>
By: Lndrtr10@aol.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;My story is no different than anyone else's. But at least I know
my ghosts are fairly friendly.&nbsp; I only have 2 ghosts in my home.
The first one we have lovingly named Helen. She has been here ever
since my mom and dad moved us in this house when I was not quite 6
years old. She doesn't do anything harmful, just a few childish little
tricks like taking lids off cookie jars and sitting the lid in another
part of the kitchen,popping the cover off the florsecent light in the
bathroom, knocking stuff off walls that won't break in a guest upsets
her,etc. But most of the time she's pretty laid back and won't do
anything for awhile. The other ghost is a friend of mine who past away
here last year. His nickname is Puddin'.&nbsp; He doesn't bother
anything at all. But every once in awhile I'll smell cigarette smoke
and a rocking chair that I have in my bedroom will move some.He used to
smoke when he was alive. Thanks for listening<br>

My Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: deadmen327@gmail.com<br>
<br>
Hey, I just wanted to tell you of the numerous activities that have happened in my house through the years.<br>
First, I'll start off with my experience. On Halloween night in my 4th
grade year, I started having a really hard time getting to sleep.<br>
Thinking it was just the after-excitement of Halloween, I went to go
sleep in my mom's bed since my dad took my oldest brother to a concert
that night. At about 2:00 in the morning (November 1st then), I started
getting really cold. I turned around to see if my mom went to go turn
up the A/C. When i turned around, I saw this white lady in a nice gown
looking down at my mom. When she noticed I saw her, she looked up and
smiled at me. After turning around really quick to see the time and
turning back to see if she was still there, I went back to sleep. The
next morning, I told my mom what happened. The first thing my mom asked
me was "What did she look like?" I tried my best to describe the lady
and when I was done my mom said to me "Hold on a second" and went
upstairs. She came downstairs with a family album and opened it up. She
pointed to a picture of her with a lady and asked "Is that her?" and in
an instant I realized it was. After telling my mom this, she replied
"Well, it looks like you got to see your great-grandma". The most
curious thing about it was that she was standing right in front of this
wooden rocking chair my mom owns that was originally my great-grandmas.<br>
The following two stories, I'm not entirely clear on since they
happened to my siblings. The first happened to my sister when was about
5. While sleeping one night, she awoke and saw my grandma smiling at
her. Upon waking up, my grandma said to her "Don't be scared Karlina."
My sister immediatly ran out of her room and sleep with my parents that
night. An interesting note here is that my grandma died a few months
before my sister was born and before my mom found out what gender she
was going to be, she had a dream that my grandma came to her holding a
baby girl smiling. Interesting enough, when my sister was born, she
looked just like the baby in the dream.<br>
The other story is that one night, my brother woke up to see some
construction-looking guy looking down at him. I can't say I know who
this ghost is since my parents were the original owners of this house
and as far as I know, no construction workers died in the building of
it.<br>
Finally, when someone is walking on the floor above our family room,
you can hear the creaks. Several times a day, the floor will creak even
if no one is up there. Also, my dog, Rikki, always used to bark at my
dad's hat rack.<br>
The last ghost-like happenings I can remember is recently (about a week
or so ago) I was home alone and my brother's dog, Riley, was in the
house with me. Usually he is a calm dog that rarely gets up (big time
couch potato), but all of a sudden he ran to our front door and started
barking like crazy. This was totally out of character for him so i
grabbed him by his collar and started pulling him back to the family
room.&nbsp; The instant I slightly let up on his collar, he charged
back to the front door and went absolutely crazy, jumping up on our
couch and running around.<br>
