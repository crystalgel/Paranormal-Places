<P><B>Private House in New Jersey</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Leslie.Rose@kordoba.de</B><B></B>

<P><B>the house I grew up in and lived in from 1968-1986 is haunted by
at least two, if not three, ghosts. It is a two-story colonial in central
N.J., with a central hallway and nine rooms. Since we sold the house, I
won't disclose the location due to privacy reasons.</B>
<BR><B>The first ghost is a woman who died at the house sometime around
1890 (the house was built&nbsp; ca. 1850) and who plays the piano. Her
name is Gracie J., and she is buried at the local cemetary. The first year
we moved to the house my parents had sent us kids (then 10, 9 and 4) to
bed and were doing the dishes in the kitchen. Suddenly they heard the piano
in the living room being played. To get there you have to go through the
dining room, the den and then the hallway, as the kitchen is at the back
of the house and&nbsp; the living room on the right; the den and dining
room are on the lfet side of the house and there is no direct connection
to the living room. So they heard the piano quite a while before the opened
the living room door. When they opened the door and turned on the light
the playing stopped. No one was in the room. We kids were all asleep -
they checked. My Mom said it sounded like a cat walking on the keys, not
like real music. We had cats, but none were in the room (that's why the
door was always kept closed). Later we all the heard the piano being played,
and quite well. It was always very soft but pleasant, and mostly around
Christmas.</B>
<BR><B>Upstairs, my oldest sister's room was located at the head of the
first landing of the front stairs. One night she was showing me how to
play the guitar as we sat on her bed. The door to her room, which was closed
and latched (it had an old, barn-door type of latch) opened. The latch
lifted, the door opened, and the end of the bed sank down. We stopped playing.
The end of the bed rose again and the door closed and latched itself. This
happened only once.</B>
<BR><B>The other times the ghost showed up she was visible. During a party
one of my friends asked me who the lady was going up the stairs. I saw
no one. My father saw her appear as a full-bodied apparition in front of
his bedroom door. This was her favorite spot, as it turned out. She stared
at him and faded away. The same thing happened to my mom as she was on
the upstairs telephone extension. As my bedroom door was directly next
to my parents' bedroom door, I often saw this apparition, but only as a
mist figure. I had to walk through it once when I was sick when I was ten
and it was icy cold. The worst thing was getting up the courage to go back
through it when I went back to bed!</B>
<BR><B>My bedroom and my parents' bedroom were situated over the living
room. These three rooms were the oldest part of the house. My two closets,
one to each side of the fireplace, were once windows which had been filled
over. The doors didn't stay shut. I finally filled two gallon jugs with
water and set them in front of the doors. Sometimes it worked. As my room
fronted the road, the lights from passing cars reflected off the walls
at night. The problem was explaining the "wandering light balls" that flitted
from closet to closet and circled over my bed. These appeared weekly and
the show lasted often for hours. I often had the feeling that they didn't
see me if I was very still, but they would come over to my bed if I sat
up. When I turned on the light they disappeared, but the feeling didn't.
This feeling was like "this is our place, what are you doing here?" When
I told my parents about them I was told it was lights from the cars or
my imagination. I finally found movies of these light balls on the Shadowlands
homeplage and was really relieved to see that it was NOT my imagination.
A month ago I went through old pics of my room and found a picture of my
cat watching an orb in the corner where these things appeared. Lots of
my pictures have orbs in them.</B>
<BR><B>Before my parents sold the house the had the kitchen redone. This
involved a lot of restructuring of the foundation and they found out the
the whole back end of the house (i.e. my oldest sister's room) was only
supported by two two-by-fours nailed together and set upright as a sort
of pillar. I surmise that the ghost was trying to warn us, as the house
developed big cracks in the walls at the time of the frequentest sightings
(ca. 1970 - 1979).</B>
<BR><B>The third ghost (or maybe the second?) walked around in the attic,
which stretched along the whole house. It liked to walk above my bedroom.
It was a second ghost at any rate, because the mist figure stood in my
doorway while the walking was going on. The pacing didn' t happen more
than two or three times.</B>
<BR><B>Behind the living room the ground outside contained lots of broken
porcelain and charcoal. We found out that the right wing of the house had
burned. The then left wing was moved to the back of the house. Later a
new left wing was added. Nothing happened in this later half of the house
(containing the dining room, den and two upstairs bedrooms), where my other
sister had her room. During a seance when I was eleven (1975) a large shadow
in front of flames appeared on the wall of the living room. Needless to
say, we ran out of the room screaming and the appearances were more frequent
for a while.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Philadelphia Row House Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mr_nemo_smith@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello,</B>
<BR><B>First let me say I find your site an excellant reference and one
of the finest web sites on the net.&nbsp; Here is my story which I do not
know is even a ghost.&nbsp; When I was born to age 13, I lived in the Mayfair
section of Philadelphia, PA.&nbsp; I am now 23.&nbsp; I had the middle
bedroom which allowed me to see the stairs to the section floor.&nbsp;
I always had my door open.&nbsp; Every few times, I would see a shape in
the darkness of a small body, a boy.&nbsp; He was coming from the back
bedroom to the front bedroom.&nbsp; I can't remember if he looked at me
or not.&nbsp; I disregarded it because I thought I was seeing things.&nbsp;
One other couple had the house before my family had it.&nbsp; To my knowledge
they had no children.&nbsp; Also I believe I was the only person to see
it and no other occurances happened in the house.&nbsp; I don't what I
saw but I do remember seeing a small body.&nbsp; Thank you.</B>

<P><B>The Earring</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Triplettt1958@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I'm 13 years old and have had a few in counters with stories amoung
my parents. My mom's side of the family has always had...what you could
call 'special ability' . The night before my grade 7 X-mas dance, i was
looking for my snowflake earring that once belonged to my dead grandmother.
My mom and i searched EVERYWHERE! my little sister long since went to bed,
all of a sudden we realized how cold it was (it was the middle of December!)and
the once locked door was open. My mom shut it and we gave up our search
for the night. I went to bed as usual, the next morning I hopped into the
shower as usual. Now let me tell u something my dad would have been at
work and when he did get home wouldn't of known about my lost earring,
my little sister was asleep and won't have heard my mom and me searching
for the earring. So i got out of the shower and there on my dresser in
which my mother and i looked over at least three times sat my other snowflake
earring!! I ran downstairs and said thanks mom for finding my earring...but
the thing was...she didn't find it and would have told me when i got up
anyways...so who found it? My grandmother always was looking out for me
and taking care of me and since it was her's I'm positively sure she found
it for me so i could really feel x-masy for the dance!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Spirits of Wolves?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tdog666@cox.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I wanted to share a neat story with everybody that must be
true!</B>
<BR><B>This involved my mother and father before all of us kids were born.&nbsp;
They lived in Nebraska and had to make a trip to San Diego because my father
was in the navy.&nbsp; They had an old station wagon and were driving through
the desert when it was getting dark.&nbsp; My dad is night blind, which
means that he has a hard time seeing things in the dark.&nbsp; Anyways
he pulled the car over to the side of the road so that they could sleep
and were soon joined by three other cars.&nbsp; That is not the wierd part,
what happened next is just amazing.</B>
<BR><B>My mom said that she had a horrible dream about a pack of wolves
tearing at the car trying to get in, they jumped on top of the car and
were on all sides of it.&nbsp; She woke up and saw my dad looking at her
like he had just seen a ghost!</B>
<BR><B>He told her that he had a dream about wolves trying to get into
the car, and was surprised to hear she had the same dream!&nbsp; Now my
dad to this day laughs at&nbsp; the fact that anything wierd could exist,
he needs to see to believe.&nbsp; Well he was scared enough to get into
the front seat and start the car to leave.&nbsp; That was when they noticed
that the other parked cars were turning on their lights and taking off
in a hurry.&nbsp; Is it possible that they could have had the same dream,
or maybe it wasn't a dream.&nbsp; Maybe those wolves were trying to protect
their territory in death.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know but both my parent's swear up and down that this happened.</B>
<BR><B>Strange huh?</B><B></B>

<P><B>Sensitive to the Spirit World</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: alm0stfamousxx@kc.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Instead of my house being haunted, I believe I am the one who is
haunted. When I was 7 years-old I was visited by some apparition. I was
lying in bed one night and I was a child who loved scary movies and having
a big imagination, I thought I was dreaming and seeing some kind of monster
in my closet. Looking back on it now it seemed to me to look like an alien,
if anything. All I saw was the outline of a glowing body and I screamed
for my parents. My dad later said that I pointed to the thing in the closet
and told him it was an angel. He grabbed me, seeing it too, and ran with
me to my parent's room. To this day I haft to have the closet doors open
when I'm in my room. You would think I'd want them closed, but to me it's
like it will be in there and I won't know and that just freaks me out.
So after I've seen this "thing" I slept in my parents room since I was
twelve, off and on. I wonder if they find it odd when I slip into their
room at night and find a 16-year-old girl sleeping on the floor.</B>
<BR><B>We moved out of that house and into another one. That's when I heard
voices call my name and I would run to my parents and ask them if they
were calling me. They would say no and I didn't understand. Then one day
I'm walking down the hall to my room and I saw a little girl with blonde
hair and a white dress, and the only hint of color is a light blue ribbon
tied around her waist. She ran from me, and it wasn't because she was afraid,
she was laughing and I think she wanted to play with me. I just stared
and I watched her run into my room. MY ROOM! I said "no" and just ran down
the stairs. I've seen this girl several times and sometimes I mistake her
for my younger sisters because she likes to follow me and laugh. I also
believe there is an older girl and teenage boy who live with me. I've seen
the boy once, I kind of woke up with him in my bed and watched him walk
into my wall. It wasn't until I was in the shower that I realized what
had just happened. The other weird thing was that he was crystal looking.
I've heard older woman upstairs once. She was walking around and humming
to herself. I just left her alone, that's what I do. I don't talk to them
because I don't want to. I just let them do their own thing, even it does
creep me out. I guess you could say I've grown accustomed to it. They like
to mess with me when I'm home alone though. That's something I don't like,
at all. I also saw a ghost at my school. That was the first time I ever
saw one outside of my house. She was nice though. I was in the library
staying late with a couple of friends and it was just us four girls. I
felt somebody else in the room, so I looked over at a bookshelf and sure
enough a woman dressed in the prairie clothing was smiling at me, like
she knew me. She had a white shirt on, blue, long skirt, glasses, and grayish-brown
hair up in a bun. It was as thought she was saying hi, and I, not thinking
just smiled back. That's when I looked back at the group and back at the
books and saw her walk away. I asked my friends if anybody else was in
there. They said no, and I told them what I saw. They pretty much freaked
out and ran out of that place.</B>
<BR><B>After that, everything pretty much stopped for about two years,
but all of the sudden it's started back up again. One night I came home
at 12:00 and was lying in bed when I saw somebody walk by my room (by the
way I have a new room). Not thinking much about it, I thought it was my
mom or dad getting a drink of water. I saw the light click on downstairs
and they never came up. I thought that was odd and I started to get paranoid.
I wanted to go see what it was but then again I didn't. So laid in bed
with the covers over my head. In the morning I asked my parents if they
were downstairs the night before and they said no. This pretty much freaked
my mom out, mainly because she doesn't believe in it and is scared to see
it or because the house she grew up in was haunted also, but that's another
story because my aunt did the ouija board and brought spirits into the
house. My mom has also seen her dead grandfather and her dead father-in-law
standing next to her. She also thought she saw me in the hallway and sat
up in bed and the thing looked at her and just walked on by. She pretty
much figured out it wasn't me. Back to the story, so the next night, I'm
lying in bed and the light clicks back on and I'm pretty much ready to
pull the covers up again when I hear my dad's calculator buzzing. He has
one of those calculators that prints paper and someone is down there using
it. Then I hear somebody get on the computer and I hear clicking. I ask
my dad about this and said that it's impossible for the calculator to work
because it's broke. This was all like 2 months ago. Just last week I was
getting ready to fall asleep and I hear this "Hey." I just closed my eyes
and pretended not to hear it.</B>
<BR><B>Another oddity is that my dad has seen the little girl numerous
times and has mistaken them for my sisters as I have. I also can predict
the future through my dreams. It's odd. If they're in black &amp; white
that means they're going to come true. I can also read people's mind and
predict what they're going to say or make them say something else. Like
if they say pick a number between 1 and 20. I can usually get the number.
If I can't, it's because somebody else is thinking a number and I get like
10 different numbers at a time. I may not get the right number, but I will
get somebody else's in the room.</B>

<P><B>Mr. Mason</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: sgwaddel@bechtel.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>About a year &amp; a half ago my parents &amp; I moved from the East
coast to the West because of the type of work we do.&nbsp; My father moved
here first, to Washington State.&nbsp; He bought the first decent house
he viewed because good housing was scarce.&nbsp; Later my mother &amp;
then myself followed.&nbsp; I am an adult &amp; it's been many years since
I've lived at home but because this particular home my father bought has
a very nice basement apartment I agreed to move in.&nbsp; Before we moved
any of our furniture in the house was in desperate need of renovation.&nbsp;
The carpets were pulled up, hardwood flooring was refurbished, the walls
were painted, etc.&nbsp; One fine day while my parents were out &amp; I
was alone painting my parent's living room the previous owner came over
to drop off the garage door openers.&nbsp; I invited her in, Mrs. Mason,
&amp; we chit-chatted for a bit before she told me that her husband had
died right there in the kitchen . . . all most exactly where I was standing.&nbsp;
She practically laughed it off, telling me that he'd been out doing yard
work &amp; come in complaining of not feeling well before collapsing on
the floor &amp; dying of a heart attack.&nbsp; She then proceeded to tell
me how he'd done most of the work on the house, the cabinets, the downstairs,
&amp; stuff.&nbsp; Then she pleasantly left.&nbsp; When Mom &amp; Dad got
home I told them all about her visit.&nbsp; They had no idea.&nbsp; We
didn't think anything of it, all though I did ask if we should get the
house cleansed.&nbsp; They said there was no need for it.&nbsp; A few months
of living in the house proved no ghostly activity &amp; my boyfriend (now
my x-boyfriend) moved from the East coast to be with me.&nbsp; He mentioned
to me several times that while I was at work &amp; he was home alone he
would hear footsteps above him in my parent's kitchen, footsteps on the
stairs down to my apartment, &amp; my "love beads" that I have hanging
between the stairs &amp; my living room would move on their own.&nbsp;
I wrote it off to the cats or dog wandering the house &amp; even joked
with him about it.&nbsp; After we broke up &amp; he moved back to the East
coast my best friend came for an extended visit.&nbsp; She too began mentioning
the footsteps &amp; the beads.&nbsp; She had laughed at my boyfriend when
he &amp; I told her of his experiences.&nbsp; She didn't seem frightened
of these occurrences like he did but swore they'd happened daily.&nbsp;
I still wrote it off to the animals . . . until recently.&nbsp; One fine
weekend when I didn't have to work &amp; I had the entire house peacefully
to myself I chose to sleep in.&nbsp; I wasn't fully asleep, just laying
there with my eyes closed, enjoying how good my new bed felt.&nbsp; All
of a sudden I heard the door that leads from the garage into the kitchen
open &amp; slam shut (it's a very old, heavy door that makes tons of noise
&amp; creaks) &amp; then my dog began barking like a stranger had entered
the house.&nbsp; I was a bit confused, 'cause we always put the garage
door down after we leave &amp; that's the only way to get into the garage
without going through the house.&nbsp; So I ran upstairs only to find my
dog cowering under the kitchen table.&nbsp; The door was closed so I opened
it to examine what was in the garage.&nbsp; The garage door was down &amp;
my parent's car was still gone.&nbsp; So I was still alone in the house
. . . unless . . . thoughts of an unlocked door &amp; a burglar scrambled
through my mind.&nbsp; I ran around the house checking all the doors &amp;
windows to make sure they were still shut &amp; locked.&nbsp; They were.&nbsp;
My dog never moved from hiding under the kitchen table while I did my dash
around the house like a mad woman.&nbsp; After all of that I coaxed my
dog over to me &amp; gave him a big hug.&nbsp; He shook terribly &amp;
it really worried me.&nbsp; Nothing else happened for the rest of the day
&amp; nothing else has happened to me since that day.&nbsp; I told my Mom
about it &amp; she didn't hesitate before blaming it on Mr. Mason.&nbsp;
My current boyfriend has spent the night &amp; stayed over during the day
while I'm off at work.&nbsp; He's also mentioned (without knowing of the
other's experiences) footsteps above him &amp; coming down the stairs.&nbsp;
He's yet to say anything about my beads moving on their own.&nbsp; He claims
to have had several ghostly encounters throughout his life &amp; says that
Mr. Mason probably is still spiritually in the house.&nbsp; I don't know
what to believe.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghosts???</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: topper31948@ncol.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Thought I'd share this little story with you. We used to live across
the street from an old cemetery. One evening around 6:00 maybe 6:30 my
grandson Brandon(12) and his friend Melissa(10) decided that they were
doing to go pay their respects to the dead. They were gone about 15 minutes
when Poppa heard them screaming blue bloody blazes! He looked out and they
were running as if the devil himself were after them. When they got back
to the house they were white as sheets and&nbsp; with eyes big as silver
dollars...When asked what was wrong they said they were visiting and out
of the woods these red round lights (orbs) came out and started chasing
after them! Strange stuff goes on in that cemetery and there seems to be
a vortex in the older part as you can actually see them coming through
sometimes....One of these days I'll send some stories about the things
we've seen come from over there....</B>

<P><B>Ghost of Halls Road Helensburgh n.s.w.</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: mxl@ansto.gov.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>I purchased this house in 1980 and for the first 6 months of living
there we could hear banging on the floor boards from under the house, this
continued for about 6 months. Not only did my wife at the time hear these
noises, so did my sister and her</B>
<BR><B>husband hear them when they visited.</B>
<BR><B>On many occasions I tried to disprove the fact that this was a ghost
because I did not want to believe it.</B>
<BR><B>I turned off the water pressure and bled off the residual pressure
to rule out noisy water pipes. Turned off the electrical supply, the banging
on the floor boards were just as loud. There was no evidence of animals
at all under the house. We built an</B>
<BR><B>extention on the back of the house when completed the noise moved
to the front door, when the banging noises were heard against the wall
next to the front door there was never anyone there. Apparently the previouse
owner had a heart attack after mowing the</B>
<BR><B>lawns, he died at the back of the house near the entrance access
to go under the house. The noises stopped when the second extention was
built on the side of the house.</B>
<BR><B>I live there alone now it is always in the back of my mind the possibility
of the ghost returning, if it does I am determined to stay there and not
be scared away.</B>

<P><B>Family home in north Hill, CA</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: calfaro627@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I used to live there with my family.&nbsp; Before my parents
bought the home my mother had a strange dream of a man standing next to
the orange tree telling her not to buy the home. One neighbor asked if
we planned to stay for a while because he was sick of seeing the house
up for sell continuously. We would see strange things, hear strange noises.</B>
<BR><B>One day my uncle's wife came home from work to find a raven in the
house and after following it into the master bedroom it had vanished with
no way of getting out.&nbsp; My father was once covered from his feet to
his head with a white transparent sheet.&nbsp; My mother was one time waiting
in the livingroom for my sister to come home when the sliding door to her
right opened on it's own.&nbsp; My mother saw the ghost of a young girl
lift the sofa where my mother sat and let go of it with force. after it
walked around the sofa and stood in front of her pointing at the fireplace.&nbsp;
My mother could see her transparent body. The! ghost was barefoot,wore
bell bottom jeans, a t-shirt and long blonde hair but had no face.&nbsp;
The ghost tried to communicate with my mother but all my mother heard was
muttering.&nbsp; Things around our home would disappear later to be found
in corners of the garage ceiling.&nbsp; My room had awful odors that would
never disappeared and no matter how many times i was</B>
<BR><B>One of my friends spend the night at my mom one day and slept on
the sofa bed he reported to see the front door open to reveal a ghost,
he also reported feeling paralized. Both my mother and i would have scary
and bizzare dreams about the house. Anyone that would spend a night at
our home would notice and feel strange things.&nbsp; The scariest part
of the house was the hallway many a times i would find myself walking really
fast or running down the hall. Many more scary things happened in the home.
During !the time that my family and i lived there many unhappy things would
happen to all of us.&nbsp; We did notice that all of the odd happenings
stopped when my parents sold the home and we moved out.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Danny</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SMader@columbus.rr.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>All my life I have heard stories of ghosts and hauntings within our
family.&nbsp; My grandmother, who was very religious, saw many things during
her life and talked about them in a matter of fact way because it these
things were just an inter-woven part of her life.&nbsp; Nothing to fear,
something to observe and pay attention to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of her 10 children
and their children have all experienced "hauntings" from the simple to
the extreme.&nbsp; One of these stories involves my aunt and her son.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;When he was a young boy he became very ill.&nbsp; After tests
and a stay in the hospital he became better but they never did really figure
out what was wrong with him.&nbsp; After he became well he began to hear
footsteps outside his bedroom door late at night when everyone was asleep.&nbsp;
He was always fearful and never got up.&nbsp; One time when the family
was up late and getting ready to turn in they noticed his bedroom door
was closed with the light shining under the door and a shadow passing back
and forth behind it with footsteps.&nbsp; They opened the door and of course
no one was in there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Finally after a time he got up at the sound of the foot steps
one night and opened the door.&nbsp; There standing in a door way was a
little boy.&nbsp; My cousin said "who are you?" (he wasn't afraid, he really
thought this was just a little boy") The little boy said "My name is Danny
Obetz and I am looking for my mother")&nbsp; with this he disappeared.&nbsp;
After that they all saw him frequently off and on during the course of
many years.&nbsp; My cousin grew up and got married and "Danny" went with
him to his new house.&nbsp; He would open kitchen cabinets and spill the
contents out.&nbsp; His wife and her friend saw him outside in the yard.&nbsp;
His sisters 3 year old daughter would frequently talk about him as her
playmate.&nbsp; She said they jumped on the bed together and talked.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My cousin and his brother opened a business together.&nbsp;&nbsp; One day
he got a call from his business saying come quick his brother was choking
and they had called an ambulance.&nbsp; When he got there his brother was
fine but told him "Danny" had been holding him down and choking him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are more stories but for lack of time I will have to tell them another
day................</B><B></B>

<P><B>Childhood Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Stuart.Bailey@rickerbys.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm from England UK and used to live with my parents and my sister
in a town called Malvern.</B>
<BR><B>When I was about four or five I used to wake up in the middle of
the night feeling something touch my feet. I was too scared to look up
at what was touching my feet. I would either bury my head under the duvet
or run to my parents room and tell them that there was a ghost in my room.
My mother would say it was just a dream and take me back to my bed.</B>
<BR><B>This happened for several nights. I told my older friends in my
street what was happening and they said it was either the curtains, which
were at the foot of my bed, touching my feet or I was dreaming it.</B>
<BR><B>After a few nights the touching stopped and to this day never happened
again.</B>
<BR><B>I am now 29 and over these years my mother has regularly told me
the story of my sister seeing a white ghost at the bottom of her bed when
she was young but for some reason I never spoke directly to my sister about
it.</B>
<BR><B>However about five years ago, my parents and my sister were talking
about ghosts and other stuff when my sister spoke about the white ghost
at the bottom of her bed (this happened when my family lived in Birmingham
and before I was born).</B>
<BR><B>She said the ghost never spoke but for some strange reason the ghost
kept touching her feet.</B>
<BR><B>When she told me this a cold shudder ran through my body and on
the back of my neck my hair stood on end. This was the first time I had
heard my sister say this.</B>
<BR><B>Ever since, I wished I had looked at what was touching my feet,
perhaps it was a white ghost. If it was, quite what the ghost wanted I
will never know.</B>

<BR><B>My Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: eeyore39@optonline.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This Story is completely true and it was told to me when I was about
6 or 7.</B>
<BR><B>My Grandparents lived in a very large two-story house, by themselves
because their 4 children were married and moved out. My Grandpa died of
lung cancer when I was just about 6. Right before he died, my Grandpa told
my uncle that if anything happened to him, he wanted my grandma to move
out of the big house. After he died, my grandma continued to live in her
big house. In her bedroom she had a rocking chair next to her bed, where
it had always been as far as I know. One night she woke up with the strange
feeling that someone was sitting at the foot of her bed. In her bedroom
she had a rocking chair next to her bed, where it had always been as far
as I know. A while after that, she woke up in the middle of the night,
and the rocking chair was out of place from where it usually was, and she
could see my Grandpa sitting in the chair with his arms crossed. A few
times, she said, “What do you want”, but she received no answer. She assumed
she was just imagining it, and went back to sleep. The next morning, the
rocking chair was in it’s usual spot, but where she had seen it in the
night, there were imprints in the carpet of where the chair had been. (After
that my Dad wouldn’t go upstairs in that house.)</B>
<BR><B>Once when my Aunt and her colleagues went to see a psychic, she
was told that her father (my Grandpa) was trying to tell her mom (my Grandma)
something, but that she wasn’t ready to listen to him.</B>
<BR><B>My Grandma saw my Grandpa once again after that. That day, my Grandma
woke up really early in the morning, and saw my Grandpa holding a set of
twin baby girls (my Grandmother had lost a set of twin girls between my
mom and her younger sister), and he was with my Grandma’s twin sister.
A few hours later, my Grandma got a call telling her that her sister had
died that morning. (Forget upstairs, my Dad then decided he wouldn’t go
far into her house at all after that.)</B>
<BR><B>My grandma did end up moving into an apartment, and my Grandpa no
longer visited her.</B>
<BR><B>My Grandma is now dead. For a while before she died, she was not
speaking clearly at all, and she only really mumbled small things when
she was awake. The day that she died, the nurse that was living with her
went down into the other room for a few minutes to get the newspaper. While
she was down in the living room, she heard my grandma call something out.
So she started going down the hall to my Grandma when she heard her say,
clear as a bell, “Mommy, I’m coming”. When she reached my Grandmother’s
room, she was dead.</B>
<BR><B>For anyone who doesn’t believe in life after death, reconsider.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Family Property</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Horselovernut@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This property is in Berks county Pa. and no one has lived on the
property since 1900. No one can visit the property because of the ghosts
or whatever you want to call it. I have never been there but I have heard
some strange stories. A woman screams and&nbsp; if you approach the house
a woman stands in the window with a candle lit. She is dressed in colonial
style clothes. The family assumes this is our ancestor. You also hear a
voice telling you to get off his land..</B>
<BR><B>April27 and June9 ,2002 we lost both our dogs. One being a black
lab and the other a german short haired pointer. This property connects
with Doe Mountain Ski Resort, people who work there and has visited Doe
Mountain has seen my dogs running with a elderly man dressed in colonial
work clothes. These people described my dogs right down to the collars.
They even told me their names are Nike and Buster. Which is their names
for real.</B>
<BR><B>I was planning a trip there with my daughters and Doe Mountain called
me and begged me not to come. They said do not go there at night time.
For whatever&nbsp; reason they said the night time is the worst. According
to Doe Mountain they said they hear the screams at night and&nbsp; will
not allow their guest out at night, the is a rule that they feel must be
abided by.This is when you hear the blood curtling screams. We had a ancestor
that died from a farm injury in 1778. Her husband died one year earlier
leaving her with 6 children and expecting another one. No one knows exactly
how she died or how, but the blame always fell on a in-law. The in-laws
name was Christopher Bittenbender. Some feel he got a bad rap even though
he was never tried and convicted this stayed in the family history and
no one corrected this.</B>
<BR><B>The property is known as the Fetteroff/ Fetherolf/ Bittenbender
property.</B>
<BR><B>The cementary still is there along with the house and barn. The
stone and log house was built in 1738 and has been kept in excellent condition.
It's liveable even today. No one in the Fetherolf family dares to step
foot on this property. Some say it's cursed, I say I am in no hurry to
find out.&nbsp; Every family member that has been on the property with
their children, the children has always had tragic accidents that claimed
their lives. The last was a girl that was killed in a plane crash. She
had visited the property with her father 2 years prior.</B>
<BR><B>Call it what you want this is too strange for coincidence. Sometimes
the family has vistors from our ancestors that lived and built the property.</B>
<BR><B>I haven't had a visit since last year, I still have strange things
happening in my house and barn but no visible faces and bodies.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes I hear a pounding on my daughters bedroom wall and she
is 7 yrs. and refuses to sleep in there. I have heard the pounding in my
room as well but I still sleep in my room. My cousin has more visits than
I do but he's not married and has no children. He can handle the confusion
more than my house can endure. I always know when they are here cause my
Jack Russell growls at nothing. One night she leaped in the air at nothing
and was attacking something. The something you could not see. All you heard
was a cane tapping.</B>
<BR><B>One night my horses was making awful noises so I went to check on
them. I found nothing but they had a frightful look in their eyes and were
rearing up in the stalls. They all were breathing heavy and were sweaty
as if they had been running.</B>
<BR><B>Maybe one day I will get brave enough to visit but not any time
soon.</B>
<BR><B>Even Reading county courthouse knows of this property the land records
officer calls it the haunted land...</B><B></B>

<P><B>Guardian Angel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JSETTLE@tampabay.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm a twin and while growing up my twin brother was slower to develope
and required more attention from my mother. Being about 5 years old I remembered
that my brother required the passenger side of the front seat so that my
mother could keep an eye on him.I on the other hand always sat directly
behind my mother in the back seat.</B>
<BR><B>One day as my mother and my twin brother and I were going to the
car in the driveway to go somewhere ( I was leading the group) ,I frooze
as I got near the front side of the car...right next to the front passenger
seat. I literally could not go any further....something or some unseen
force would not let me go any further. If I did go any further I would
have circled around the back of the car to get to the back seat directly
behind my mother in the drivers seat.I got into the the passenger seat
and with a short disagreement with my twin, I got to sit where my twin
usally sat. My twin on the other hand sat in the middle of the back seat.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly later as we were traveling there were slippery ,wet upstate
New York roads. A car was approaching us in the wrong lane swerving from
side to side.My mother had done the correct thing and drove way off to
the side of the road to avoid the obvious head on collision.I remembered
that we were way off to the side of the road and stopped and what appeared
to be safe when all of a sudden a huge crashing sound came from the back
of the car and the whole world seemed to be twirling violently. I brased
the front dashboard out of reflex while what seemed to be minutes was actually
seconds.When everything settled down all I could remember distinctly was
seeing my mother bleeding and roughed up pretty bad and my twin brother
was screaming and pouring blood out of his glass filled mouth.He was lucky
that he lived for he almost stopped breathing while my mother was lucky
enough to be able to come to his assistance.When I looked myself over...I
had not a scratch...not a one.The whole incident took us all by surprise.</B>
<BR><B>About a month latter we went to see the car.....to my surprise ...the
other car had hit directly full force right behind the drivers seat,had
I been sitting in my seat as usual I would of surely have been killed.
It had hit so hard that it caved in the back seat to half way through the
car.I am eternally thankfull for my gaurding angle that God has given me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 11 I was laying in bed when an apparition floated
to the bedroom doorway.&nbsp; The cat I was holding woke and scratched
my arm as he shot out and went under the bed.&nbsp; The ghost watched me
for about 30 seconds and then proceeded on down the hallway.&nbsp; I think
it was the ghost of the man, Col. Price, who lived and died in the house.&nbsp;
All this happened in a tiny “town”, Uffington, just a boat dock on the
Monongahala River really, located between Morgantown and Fairmont West
Virginia.&nbsp; This was in the early 70’s.&nbsp; I’ve always wanted to
go back and talk with whoever lives in the house now.</B>

<BR><B>The Apartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: snight1@msn.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This is an absolute true story and I can remember it as if it just
happened last night.&nbsp; Not a maybe, or a reflection, or a dream but
it really really happened.&nbsp; So, no doubt in my mind that there are
such things as ghosts.&nbsp; I only saw this one in my life and made me
a believer forever.</B>
<BR><B>I got married in 1976 and moved into the brick apartment buildings
across from the Somerset Football field not too long afterwards.&nbsp;
They were brand new and we were lucky to get one of them.&nbsp; We had
a two-bedroom apartment.&nbsp; If you turn down the street beside them
and get to the very last one, ours was on the second floor facing the street.</B>
<BR><B>Like I said they were brand new apartments and people were moving
into them but they were still working out the bugs with the cable television
wires and painting.&nbsp; Still some of the apartments weren't finished
so they were even laying carpet in some of them.</B>
<BR><B>A local Realty company owned the apartments and landlord, who graduated
one year before me, managed them.&nbsp; I knew that he used his passkey
to enter apartments if need be when people weren't home, so they could
check wiring or finish up apartments.&nbsp; I never cared for him much
because he had an attitude but we were happy to be in the new apartments.</B>
<BR><B>My wife and I went to bed that night in the bedroom facing the street.&nbsp;
The light from the street actually lit up the bedroom so that it was possible
to see anything in the room.&nbsp; It wasn't that dark at all because the
light was outside of our bedroom window.</B>
<BR><B>We weren't in bed long at all, with not a chance to even fall asleep
when my wife said "Did you hear that?"&nbsp; I said, "Yes".&nbsp; She said
"It sounds like someone came into the apartment!"&nbsp; I agreed and told
her "Just be quiet and lay still".&nbsp; I don't know why I didn't get
up and turn a light on right away.&nbsp; I guess I thought it could be
the apartment manager and wanted to surprise him and see just what he was
up to.</B>
<BR><B>I remember that my wife was snuggled up close against me with her
head on my right arm.&nbsp; We remained quiet.&nbsp; Now what I'm about
to tell you is exactly what my ex-wife saw and remembers to this day.&nbsp;
We both saw the exact same thing.</B>
<BR><B>With the room lit from the streetlight.........a man walked ever
so slowly into our bedroom and continued to the foot of our bed.&nbsp;
When he first entered the room I whispered into my wife's ear "There he
is!"&nbsp; And went "Shhh Shhh".&nbsp; He stopped at the foot of our bed
and turned facing us.&nbsp; Right at the foot of the bed!!!!</B>
<BR><B>You couldn't see through him.&nbsp; He looked like a real man with
a long coat and hat, of some sort, with his arms down to his side.&nbsp;
He stood there staring at us for maybe a minute.&nbsp; It actually seemed
longer but I'd guess it was only a minute.&nbsp; Remember, it wasn't dark
in the room at all.&nbsp; And there he was staring at us!!!!!&nbsp; I couldn't
see color but you could make out that it was a man.&nbsp; You couldn't
tell how old he was.</B>
<BR><B>He then turned towards our bedroom door and exited as slowly as
he entered.&nbsp; From our bedroom door to the front door, the only door
in the apartment was a straight shot.&nbsp; You could see from our door,
through the hallway and actually see the front door from our bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>I let the man get, what I thought to be at the most, maybe 10 feet
from our bedroom.&nbsp; There was no way possible that he could get out
of the apartment without me seeing him.&nbsp; Because I JUMPED UP and TURNED
ON THE LIGHT.........and he was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; I could see clear
to the apartment door.&nbsp; No sound of a door opening either or any other
sound but I never gave him a chance to get to the door.&nbsp; I wanted
to know who in the hell was in the apartment.</B>
<BR><B>I then slowly walked through the apartment saying "Who's here?"&nbsp;
My wife was right up against me following me through the apartment as I
checked in closets, in the bathroom and behind things.&nbsp; Nothing!!!!!??????&nbsp;
And we both saw the exact same thing and realized that it was IMPOSSIBLE
for him to get out as quick as I turned on the light.</B>
<BR><B>I will always remember this.&nbsp; The strange thing is......after
this, I don't remember her or myself being afraid that he may appear again.&nbsp;
Now this has been a long time ago but I don't think we actually brought
it up too often.&nbsp; I'm not sure how many people we told about it.&nbsp;
Now I think I should have maybe put it in the newspaper. This happened
in Somerset and no one knows about it.&nbsp; Just makes you think of how
many other sightings happen and no one says anything.</B>
<BR><B>I swear that this is true, so I can't disbelieve ghost sightings
at the Flight 93 crash site.&nbsp; You would think that there would be
lots of ghost sightings at the World Trade Center wouldn't you?&nbsp; I
just wish people could be trusted and honest and not make up stories to
get attention or to scare people.</B>
<BR><B>Well, that's my story!&nbsp; You can believe it because I am not
one to make up stories like this.</B>

<P><B>Update to Man By My Bed</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Staceyinfo@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is the best place ever! I spend WAY too much time reading everyone's
stories. Anyway, I digress...</B>
<BR><B>Somewhere in all these stories is my original story about when I
saw a ghost as a nine year old girl. To briefly recap:</B>
<BR><B>We moved to Berkeley after my older sister died of cancer (she was
11 when she died). We moved from Lancaster, CA to Berkeley, CA to start
life over. I, as I said, was nine years old.</B>
<BR><B>We moved to a little house, probably built in the 50s, which sat
behind a Victorian home, built I have no idea when (obviously in the Victorian
era).</B>
<BR><B>One night I woke up to see an old man standing by the side of my
bed, right next to me on my side, staring at me. I don't want to try to
describe his clothes or features becase decades have gone by and my memory
is sketchy. What I do remember is he was solid flesh and blood and I stared
intently at him in utter fright.</B>
<BR><B>I started to scream. My dad ran in the room and leaned over to hug
me. My dad went right THROUGH the man. I was hugging my dad and seeing
his body through the man's body. It was the most terrifying thing I have
ever seen to this day.&nbsp; Especially because I could see how absolutely
solid and real the man was and it made no sense. I screamed for my dad
to turn on the light. He went to the light switch, the man was STILL there,
and he turned on the light. The man then disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, on to the update! This is not a Hollywood movie, so forgive
me if it is a little anti-climatic. I do think there is something of interest
for you, however...</B>
<BR><B>O.k. I was driving by the house which I do almost everyday because
we live on the same street now, but about half a mile up the road. After
I wrote the original story, I decided that I would try to contact the people
that live there to see if I could see my old bedroom once more.</B>
<BR><B>This is a little more difficult then it sounds. I mean it is not
that thrilling to think about walking up to total strangers and convincing
them to let you in their house. Plus, of the many times I have walked and
driven by, and never saw anyone that lived there.</B>
<BR><B>So two days ago I was driving by and I saw two elderly women walking
through the front door of the cottage. I said "Here's my chance!" and stopped
my truck and ran towards them because they were almost through the door.
By the time I got to the door they had walked in and shut the door. I just
kept standing there, not knowing what to do. I kept staring at the house
and standing there. I was feeling really retarded, I assure you.</B>
<BR><B>To make matters worse, a man in about his 30s was standing by the
back of the house, around where the older Victorian house stands. He was
definately looking at me like I was off my rocker. He walked up to me and
said "Can I help you?"</B>
<BR><B>I started talking and I felt really phony as I was talking. I told
him I had lived in the cottage and wanted to see my old room. I mentioned
the name of the owners of the next door neighbor's house so he could see
I wasn't casing the joint.</B>
<BR><B>He said yes, that was the name of the next-door neighbor. He said
that the next-door neighbor had died a long time ago so I guess that sort
of made him take me a little more seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked him if
our original landlord still lived in the Victorian. He said that had been
his grandfather. He said that now him and his family along with his father
and mother now lived in the Victorian. He said that two elderly ladies
lived in the cottage. Anyway, as I kept talking he seemed to realize there
was just a teeny little bit more to my story (I think because I said something
about how I just had to see the house before my birthday in two weeks).</B>
<BR><B>He actually said something to me with the affect of "is something
you arn't saying about why you are so interested in this house?"&nbsp;
So I just decided to go for broke. I said, "Well, I will tell you why I
am so interested but you are going to think I am a total lunatic... I saw
a ghost when I was a little girl" He kinda looked at me and then he started
to ask me a barrage of questions "Where? What room?" What did he look like?
What happened..." I mean on and on to the point I started to feel like
HE knew something and wasn't telling me.</B>
<BR><B>So after a few minutes of being grilled I asked him if someone else
had seen a ghost in the driveway.&nbsp; He told me his father had seen
a ghost but was VERY skeptical and didn't believe in ghosts, not even the
one he saw.</B>
<BR><B>I asked him if I could ever talk to the dad and he said sure. I
thought he would say he would take my number or something but then he said
his dad was in the back house and did I want to go meet him right away.&nbsp;
Wow! I was really in shock by this time and feeling that things were getting
kinda surreal...</B>
<BR><B>So we went to the back house and he introduced me to the dad and
his mom. The other funny thing is that the dad absolutely did not remember
my parents or me living there at that time. They called the man's sister
and I talked with her on the phone. She didn't remember us either. I was
back to feeling like they thought I was casing the place...</B>
<BR><B>Finally the sister said she vaguely remembered my mom. I said I
would bring over pictures and what not and she said that was great. She
was very nice.</B>
<BR><B>Then I told the man that I had a weird part to my visit. The son
made a joke like "Yeah, here is the part where you will want to throw her
out." I was thinking "Oh lord help me!" but then I told him the whole embarrassing
story. He, just like his son, asked me a billion questions. I mean I felt
like these two were mighty interested for people who didn't seem to believe
in ghosts... Then afterwards the man kept saying "Oh you were dreaming."
.. stuff like that. I decided it was time to turn the tables so I asked
the man what had he seen?</B>
<BR><B>He said he had been in the kitchen of the Victorian one day when
he was younger (I think in his 20s or 30s). He saw a man walk down the
driveway along side the kitchen towards the back of the house. There was
no way to get out of the yard at the back where the man was headed. The
man ran out of the house after the tresspasser. He ran to the back of the
house where the man had headed and where his parents were sitting. He asked
them what happened to the man. They said no-one had walked by there. He
still scoffed at his own story and said there had to be some reasonable
explanation.</B>
<BR><B>I told him I wasn't&nbsp; the type to make things up and had been
in law enforcement and not given to flights of fancy either.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I asked him if the man he had seen sounded like the one
I had seen bu the said they sounded different. I asked him about the history
of the house. He said he thought there was one owner before them (name
of Rucker)&nbsp; and the Victorian house was one of the oldest in the area.</B>
<BR><B>They said they would have me back and we agreed I would bring down
all my old pictures of when we lived in the cottage and they said they
would allow me (with the permission of the elderly women) to go in and
see the cottage.</B>
<BR><B>That is all to the story so far except today I went to the library
and looked in old directories (what they used to call phone book type books)
to see if I could find something on the Ruckers. I did see that they only
seem to have lived in the house for about 4 years. I am going to try to
locate more info on who was the original owner of the Victorian. I have
a weird suspicion that someone died in that house and the man that was
in my room is connected to the Victorian.</B>
<BR><B>If anything more happens I will let you know but I don't think I
am going to get much further with this.. Thanks!</B>

<BR><B>The Ghost that came for a Smoke</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Epburdet@marysville.k12.oh.us</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Shirley Burdett, when I was 8 in a foster home in Harrison</B>
<BR><B>Ohio, I saw a shost and it spoke to my foster mother.It was a warm</B>
<BR><B>evening and we had the air conditioning on. I was on my way to the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom from the family room, where my foster mother and I were</B>
<BR><B>watching tv. On the way to the bathroom I passed the only kitchen</B>
<BR><B>window.And something told me to look outside. When I did, I saw
a figure</B>
<BR><B>or outline of a man setting at our picnic table smokeing a cigerrrate.</B>
<BR><B>Of course being very scared, since there was only my mom and me,
I ran</B>
<BR><B>back into the family room and told there was a man setting at our
picnic</B>
<BR><B>table smokeing. She didn't believe me, so she came and looked herself.</B>
<BR><B>Sure enough there he was.&nbsp; We had an intercom system in the
house so</B>
<BR><B>mom could call me where ever I was, it was even hook up outside.
So she</B>
<BR><B>got on it and said. "Who are you?" He didn't repond right away.
She</B>
<BR><B>asked him again and told him she would call the police if he didn't</B>
<BR><B>answer.</B>
<BR><B>In as normal a voice as you and I, he said." Bea, let me finish
my</B>
<BR><B>cigerrate and I'll leave." We were shocked when he addressed her
as if</B>
<BR><B>he knew her. Again she asked him his name. And he repeated what
he said.</B>
<BR><B>I heard it all.Because I was standing right beside her.</B>
<BR><B>She said to stay with her, because she was going to turn on the
outside</B>
<BR><B>light. And she did.........</B>
<BR><B>What happen really scared the both of us. When she turned on the
light,</B>
<BR><B>there was no one there. She flipped off the light and there he was,</B>
<BR><B>flipped it on he was gone.</B>
<BR><B>We were scared and stood for a few minutes watching him smoke, we
could</B>
<BR><B>see the light at the end of the cigerrate light up everytime he
took a</B>
<BR><B>drag. Finally my mom told me that we were going to go back to the
family</B>
<BR><B>room and leave IT alone.</B>
<BR><B>So we went back into the family room and stayed a while, finally
I had</B>
<BR><B>to go really bad and took a chance that IT wouldn't get me. By the
time</B>
<BR><B>I went to the bathroom, the man was gone.</B>
<BR><B>Of course no one believes me to this day. I saw a man smoking and
I saw</B>
<BR><B>the lit cigerrate. So no one can tell me different.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Structural Changes</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LonnyDHach@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was wondering if structural changes to a building could cause a
ghost to leave?&nbsp; My story takes place in Iowa. My parents bought a
farm that we moved to in 1965, the house was built in 1916, it was a untouched
big 4 square prairie style with the 3rd story a huge attic with wide plaster
walled stairway with landing leading up to it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(important to know later) and large porches on front &amp; sides. Today
it would be considered a classic.</B>
<BR><B>I was about 5 years old when we moved there. I remember days being
in the house and I would hear walking up stairs, I would go tug on Mon's
skirt and ask "ma---&nbsp; who's upstairs"? and she would say "nobody"
and I would carry on. this happened several times, I would be upstairs
in my room and would hear walking in the attic, I would go down stairs
and ask&nbsp; "ma-- who in the attic"? she would say no one, I'd argue,
" is it Dad? Is it Dave or Ben? (brothers) Mom would say they are all in
the fields working and nobody is in the attic.</B>
<BR><B>I learned to not ask about the noises up stairs after some time
&amp; scolding. But I always heard them, never if I was in the attic myself
but when I was upstairs, on the main floor or even if I was in the basement
I could hear the walking on the wood floors. I just kept it to myself.</B>
<BR><B>Then in 1973 on Memorial Day about 7:30pm a tornado struck and the
house among other barns was damaged.&nbsp; The wonderful tall peak roof
and its 4 craftsman styled dormers were badly damaged with shingles &amp;
boards stripped off and windows blown out showing dark empty holes.</B>
<BR><B>After temporary patching the entire old roof was removed and a new
low 1970s style roof applied. After this reconstruction I never heard the
walking again.</B>
<BR><B>History of the house talks about a bachelor living there during
proabition, rumor has it he would go to the attic to "have his hooch."&nbsp;
He suposedly died in the house&nbsp; in the 50s.</B>
<BR><B>When the new roof was put on Dad found "stomach bitters" &amp; other
bottles stuffed under the attic floor boards.</B>
<BR><B>I think I was hearing the drunk old bachelor in the attic drinking
his hooch during probation</B>

<BR><B>Spirit from the Mental Hospital</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Froginhole@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>near the beginning of this most recent school year we managed to
gain access to an abandoned mental hospital. this hospital was shut down
in 1994, and due to the fact that we were definitely not there legally
and have rescued many personal items from there i will not disclose the
location.</B>
<BR><B>we spent many nights in this hospital exploring and finding some
things that were rather disturbing. the first disturbing find was the top
floor. when we made our way up there we discovered that almost all of the
patients' personal items were still in the rooms. it was like they were
left exactly how they were when they were inhabited.</B>
<BR><B>on another visit we discover patient records. this allowed us to
find that the top floor was the violent ward....reserved for patients that
had a history of violence and were considered a danger to other people.
we also discovered a sort of appartment just above the top floor. we assumed
that it belonged to a resident doctor or something of that nature. the
strangest thing about this "apartment" was that it was still totally furnished,
clothes were in the closet, pictures on the desk, like someone living there
just got up and left everything exactly where it was.</B>
<BR><B>these were just some of the strange things we noticed in the building.
the real account is about the possible spirit we encountered soon after
we started frequenting the hospital. his name was chris and he moved into
the building that most of my friends lived in. he seemed to have an uncanny
knowledge of the layout of the building the first time we took him there.
we met this guy about two weeks after our first entry into the building.
he seemed to only associate with those of us that spent time in the mental
hospital.</B>
<BR><B>as time went on he proved to be a rather disturbed idividual. he
was heavily into drugs, the over the counter type drugs, and he would spend
hours writing on the walls of his room. he also had no knowledge of news,
music, or movies more recent than about 1993.</B>
<BR><B>this individual left our lives as suddenly as he appeared. the building
was gutted and worked started in refabbing it into another facility about
five months after our first encounter with it. soon after the building
was gutted chris was gone. we did however gain access to his room. it was
like walking into one of the rooms in the hospital, one of the rooms that
housed a more disturbed person. the walls were covered in very small writing
in black marker about many things. all of his clothes and personal items
were left. the room smelled horrible, he had turned his closet into a restroom.
it was very eerie entering the room and finding it to be near identical
to some of the rooms in the hospital.</B>
<BR><B>it wasn't until he was gone that the small group of us realised
that he very possibly was a spirit that had befriended us. he was not a
normal individual and the sequence of events is very disconcerting to me.
we rarely mention chris due to the fact that we all seem to feel that he
came from the mental hospital.</B>
<BR><B>i will be happy to discuss things in more detail, feel free to contact
me with any questions.</B>

in</B>
<BR><B>the indoor pool next to the Lobby. The Pinball machine by the exit

A man</B>
<BR><B>pushed his wife and children out of one of the upper level windows
and then</B>
<BR><B>leaped out to meet his own demise." After reading this I went to
the very</B>
<BR><B>top floor of the Shilo inn. I took my husband because he is a non-believer</B>
<BR><B>and thought the whole thing was silly. We got to the very top floor
and were</B>
<BR><B>walking around. Before we went up to the top floor we looked around
the</B>
<BR><B>building while in our car and there were no lights on at any of
the rooms on</B>
<BR><B>the top floor. Anyways once we got up there we could hear doors
slaming. My</B>

<BR><B>we heard the door slam but no one was there and no doors were open.
Scared</B>

<P><B>Pure Evil</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ha9is@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>my name is Laura and I'm 15 about a year ago the local youth club
and i went</B>
<BR><B>to Chiswick in the lake district in England and we stayed form Friday
to</B>
<BR><B>Sunday in an old residential bunk the rooms where in one building
and the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen and dining room were in another building and they were both
in a mass</B>
<BR><B>of wood land and near a huge river and there was another building
not far</B>
<BR><B>from where i slept with my friends on an island and the only means
of getting</B>
<BR><B>to the main land was boat. when we arrived in our mini buss after
a four hour</B>
<BR><B>drive i got out and had a look around the bunk and the woods for
some reason</B>
<BR><B>i had a funny turn on the buss i felt happy and safe not because
the leaders</B>
<BR><B>where their but on the forest floor i felt scared and uneasy it
takes a lot</B>
<BR><B>to scare me i felt a presence of sadness pain despair and a powerful
feeling</B>
<BR><B>of evil i thought nothing of it but that night when me and my friends
where</B>
<BR><B>up late talking i was listening to something out side and i saw
a shadow move</B>
<BR><B>to the centre of the window and vanish and with that i started rocking</B>
<BR><B>backwards and forwards and mumbling which a look of terror on my
face (says</B>
<BR><B>my friend) she looked up at me and said "Laura are you OK" i looked
at her</B>
<BR><B>then backed over to the corner of the of my bed i rested my chin
on my knees</B>
<BR><B>and swayed ever so slightly and started&nbsp; mumbling and crying
and the next</B>
<BR><B>night when it grew dark i felt it again. we where playing in the
woods and i</B>
<BR><B>stopped dead in my tracks and fell down and all i could see was
visions of f</B>
<BR><B>death suicide murder and more terrible things to deraign for me
to write i</B>

they</B>
<BR><B>where back with more force than before much more persistence it

<P><B>Paranormal Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bassets17@insightbb.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm a 13 year old girl and a former skeptic of ghosts.&nbsp; Since
I was 8, those TV shows on hauntings just draw me onto the couch and I
sit and watch.&nbsp; Since I began believing ghosts, I've had questionable
experiences.&nbsp; I say questionble because sometimes the odds are againts
my "experiences" but often they are not.&nbsp; First you will have to know
a little history about my house.&nbsp; It isn't that old but I think it
is 50 years old and has had about 3 familes in it.&nbsp; When we bought
this house, the owners claimed that a little boy had died in a house very
similar and near ours.&nbsp; In my mind, nobody is gonna tell the people
buying their house after they signed the papers about this story which
"didn't happen in our house"&nbsp; unless it did.&nbsp; To support this
I will tell you one of my experiences.&nbsp; I was sitting in the living
room a while back in chair.&nbsp; All of the sudden I feel this push, like
a child playing tag, hit me in the back.&nbsp; I thought it was my parents
just playing a joke at first but they were in the kitchen at least 15 ft.
away.&nbsp; My mom has also heard noises and music coming from our basement
that stop as soon as she gets down to the room she thinks they're coming
from.&nbsp; Recently a handprint was on our living room wall.&nbsp; My
parents blmaed me I had put the greasy print there but when I put my hand
up there my fingers were at least a good inch above the prints.&nbsp; I
have the about the smallest hand in my house.&nbsp; To sum up I also sometimes
feel I'm being watched in my basement so I never go down there.&nbsp; I
also have felt an arm around my shoulder once while watching TV in my bedroom.&nbsp;
Unfortunately my parents still do not believe me but a few things at my
house are jst really strange sometimes.&nbsp; Oh, and by the way, the little
boy was killed in "a basement" just like ours when a sink fell on him.&nbsp;
No wonder we hear nosies down there.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Old Brick House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: stokesta@military.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I would like to ad an experience that I had at a Detroit home.&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was the only experience because I left and have never stayed there</B>
<BR><B>since.&nbsp; I cant give to much detail because I am still semi-involved</B>
<BR><B>with one of the people that occasionally live there.</B>
<BR><B>In 1996, I was dating a man that lived in an OLD OLD brick, 2 story,</B>
<BR><B>4/5 bedroom home that had been in his immediate family since it
was</B>
<BR><B>first built.&nbsp; The house is, to this day, still decorated with
the</B>
<BR><B>original carpets, wallpaper and paint, light fixtures and pipes
and</B>
<BR><B>still holds household goods probably as old as the house its self</B>
<BR><B>including furniture.&nbsp; So I am sure you can imagine the shape
the</B>
<BR><B>house is in.&nbsp; The oldest member of the family is the only permanent</B>
<BR><B>resident there and refuses to leave.&nbsp; My boyfriend invited
me to stay</B>
<BR><B>there one night, and with out any second thoughts I agreed.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>told by him that night while we were watching tv that he, when he
was</B>
<BR><B>younger, had been watching tv on the couch in the living room.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>stairs that led to the second floor where off the LR and are a tight,</B>
<BR><B>sharp, turn incline.&nbsp; He told me he was about to go to bed
and had</B>
<BR><B>started up the stairs, when he turned the sharp corner to complete</B>
<BR><B>the climb and a man dressed in old fashion military clothing was</B>
<BR><B>standing on the top.&nbsp; The man just smiled at him tipped his
hat and</B>
<BR><B>vanished.&nbsp; I kinda laughed it off, but I am a serious believer
and</B>
<BR><B>was completly freaked out.&nbsp; When we went to bed in the very
first</B>
<BR><B>room at the top of the stairs, I knew that I was not going to be
able</B>
<BR><B>to sleep.&nbsp; When you reach the top of the stairs the hall devides
into</B>
<BR><B>a V shape and bedrooms and a bath room are off the halls. Every</B>
<BR><B>window in the house is completely covered so the upstairs is very</B>
<BR><B>eery&nbsp; After about an hour of no sleep and hiding my head under
the</B>
<BR><B>covers I woke my boyfriend and told him I wanted to go home because
I</B>
<BR><B>was scared.&nbsp; He laughed and told me to look in the corner at
what he</B>
<BR><B>was seeing.&nbsp; I was about to wet myself, I refused and turned
and</B>
<BR><B>faced the wall.&nbsp; All was pretty quite after about 15 mins and
my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend was fast asleep.&nbsp; I tried to clear my mind and fall
asleep</B>
<BR><B>when suddenly out of no where I heard faint running footsteps up
and</B>
<BR><B>down the Vshaped hall, past our door over and over again.&nbsp;
I tried to</B>
<BR><B>be really quiet to find out what it could possibly be when I heard,</B>
<BR><B>along with the running, a little boy calling 'mommy' in an innocent,</B>
<BR><B>but lost sounding manner.&nbsp; This continued for a few minutes
and I</B>
<BR><B>woke my BF again to report it to him and he only laughed at me and</B>
<BR><B>said go to sleep or you may hear the other things that go on in
the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; That was enough for me, hugely pregnant and one of
the only 2</B>
<BR><B>white people probably in the whole area, I got out of the house
and</B>
<BR><B>sat on the porch until my BF took me home.&nbsp; The next day he
called me</B>
<BR><B>and laughed at me, he has grown up in the house and is accustomed
to</B>
<BR><B>the sounds and sightings.&nbsp; One other thing he told me is sightings
of</B>
<BR><B>his father in the living room.&nbsp; 5 Months before I met him his
father</B>
<BR><B>had died from failing organs.&nbsp; Since his father died, he told
me that</B>
<BR><B>he has had several mornings that he woke up, went down stairs past</B>
<BR><B>through the living room where his dad was seated at the couch, into</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen.&nbsp; His father, before dieing, every morning would
sit on</B>
<BR><B>the couch and when my BF would wake, his father would ask for a
cup</B>
<BR><B>of hot tea before going to work.&nbsp; On these occasions since
his death,</B>
<BR><B>my BF never gave it a second thought and when he would return to
the</B>
<BR><B>LR to give his father the tea he was gone.&nbsp; He would realize
what had</B>
<BR><B>happened and become over welmed with emotion.&nbsp; I can honestly
say the</B>
<BR><B>occurances we both had were true and crazy.&nbsp; We both believe
that the</B>
<BR><B>ghosts of his family members will forever haunt the home and</B>
<BR><B>therefore he refuses to make any changes or get rid of the house
for</B>
<BR><B>as long as he lives</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Cemetery Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Nolesrules@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have always been a nonbeliever, that is until my experience in
1992.</B>
<BR><B>I was an employee at a pizza place then. After we would close, my
friends and I would sit around the resteraunt and talk "friend" talk.</B>
<BR><B>Well this particular night we were telling ghost stories. One of
my friends asked us if we had ever been to "Howard Road Cemetary"? He then
told us that he was chased by something that was about 5 feet tall, running
upright, with beady red eyes.</B>
<BR><B>We laughed at him, so he told us he would take us there. Well, it
was 2am, and I don't believe there was much light out. The place was in
the middle of the country. We could here coyotes howling in the background.
There was a wooden fence in an "L" shape, with what appeared to be old
tombstones like from western movies, beyond the fence.</B>
<BR><B>Outside of the fence there was what looked like a square hole in
the ground with concrete walls and floor. My friend told us it used to
be a church in the 1920's to 50's. In the 60's and 70's they used to do
drugs there, and in the 80's there were satanic worshiping there. The townsfolk
burned down the church after they found out.</B>
<BR><B>After shining the flashlight down looking at the graffitti on the
walls, I hollered "LOOK!!" Beyond the fence, in the cemetary, there appeared
to be one grave that was glowing a bright green glow. It was like the color
of those glowsticks that you use, a bright green illuminating glow. We
jumped in our car and sped off, too frightened to stick around to see what
it was.</B>
<BR><B>About six months later, a friend and I were sitting in the break
room having lunch with a new employee. She was telling us about an experience
she had when she was younger. I turned to my friend and simply said, "well
that's nothing compared to our cemetary story", when the newer employee
said "you're not talking about Howard Road Cemetary are you?" I asked what
did she know about Howard Road cemetary, when she told us her sister and
a friend was chased by something five feet tall, with beady red eyes.</B>
<BR><B>I have never found out what the green glow was about. i've searched
online, reading sites such as these. After opening my mind up, I have had
other experiences since. I have read stories about the beady red eyes before
(sends chills up my spine every time), but am looking for answers with
the glow.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Something was There</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: michael.divita@verizon.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>As a child, in West Virginia, I would get this feeling while lying
in bed something was in my room.&nbsp; I would not be able to talk but
my covers would be pulling away from me and I felt as if I had to hold
them up.&nbsp; When I was around 5 or 6 my teacher read Casper the friendly
Ghost.&nbsp; I thought he was cool so that night, after being put to bed
I thought of him and gave out a "whooo" sound and was answered by an adult
sounding version.&nbsp; Clear as day, I could still hear my mom and grandparents
downstairs talking, uninterrupted by this event.&nbsp; Years later, around
12 or 13 and a new house, I exited the shower in the daytime.&nbsp; I opened
the door and began walking towards my room and saw a green hazy figure
standing in front of me.&nbsp; I kept walking not registering what I am
looking at.&nbsp; It began backing up and just as I walked into it and
realized I think its a ghost, it throws an arm up to block me but I am
in it and its gone.&nbsp; I was cold at this point.&nbsp; Near the same
time line, as I am graduating away from toys, I am up in my room counting
how many plastic army men I collected over the years for whatever reason.&nbsp;
It is after midnight and my parents and sister are downstairs asleep.&nbsp;
From the hallway outside my room I hear "Michael!"&nbsp; The voice was
deep, loud and sounded like the dubbed demonic voice from a horror movie.&nbsp;
Scared, I slammed my door, flipped out the lights and jumped under my covers.&nbsp;
Why this was the thing to do, I don't know.&nbsp; When I was 18 and living
with my dad in NY, I had one of those dreams you bounce in bed and wake
up.&nbsp; I laughed at myself, looked at the alarm clock which went from
0313 to 0314.&nbsp; When I looked back upwards, I saw a tremendously large
gray fellow standing in my bed.&nbsp; Its back was towards me and it turned
around to look at me.&nbsp; It then said "Oh your awake.&nbsp; Goodbye."&nbsp;
The voice was the same as the "Michael" voice.&nbsp; It even leaned towards
me when speaking and was in my face.&nbsp; I couldn't;to move or speak
but it instantly disappeared and then I screamed.&nbsp; That was the last
I saw heard etc. of an of these things.&nbsp; The two I remember seeing,
green and gray, had no features, only shapes.&nbsp; The green seemed harmless
but gray was frightening.&nbsp; Gray had a funny shaped head too.&nbsp;
Gray was the only one to talk. I am 33 now and a police officer and still
believe this really happened.&nbsp; I have heard of being partially asleep
and hallucinating and being paralyzed but I was awake when I walked into
green and wake when I heard my name called.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Fort Pitt</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Blackwatch42RHR@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Several years ago,when I worked for the Pittsburgh Police Dept.I
was working the 3-11 shift when I was assigned to patrol Point State Park.This
piece of ground is called "The Point",is bordered by the three rivers,and
was the spot where George Washington said was a good place to build a fort
in 1754.It was turning dark while I was sitting in my patrol car outside
of the Fort Pitt Museum and Blockhouse.Suddenly,I saw what looked like
a company of Scottish soldiers marching into the point.Around 100 yards
away,I saw French soldiers and indians running towards them into battle.As
there was nobody else around,I thought that it was great that I had a front
row seat to this battle reenactment(which was a common event in the park).I
remember a lot of smoke from the muskets firing,and the combatants dispersing.The
next day I went into the museum before it closed at 5pm and told them how
much I liked their reenactment.The Curator got a strange look on his face
and told me that there weren't any reenactments scheduled until the following
weekend!I didn't think anything of it until much later when I studied the
French &amp; Indian War.I learned that before Fort Pitt was built,the French
had used George Washington's idea and built Fort Duquesne in the point.The
British tried to take it on three different occasions,the last being during
"The Battle of Grant's Hill" in 1758 when Major James Grant sent his Highlanders
to take the French fort and were defeated.I learned that after this battle,some
of the prisoners(British &amp; Provincials)were tomahawked or burned at
the stake by the French Indians.Another friend on the PD told me that he
used to work as a night watchman at Kaufman's Dept.Store that was several
blocks away from the point.The store stands where Grant's Hill once stood,while
the point is a flat plain.When my colleague was working the graveyard shift,he
took his breaks up on the 10th floor of the store where the furniture is
displayed.While relaxing on a barco-lounger in the semi-darkness,he would
hear disembodied footsteps walking all around him,but never see anyone.The
10th floor you see,is exactly at the same height where the hill would have
been!</B><B></B>

about some places listed for oxnard (and a few new ones fron santa paula)
well in oxnard the old st johns hospital is beyond haunted it is somewhat
unbelievable wat goes on. i myself have seen a few dozen people looking
down at me and my passengers from the very top floor at night. a few people
i know have seen wheelchairs move by themselves heard heavy footsteps,
and ear perceing screams of patients yelling to be releashed. many a person
has hauled ass outta there. as for santa paula, there is a road by the
name of dairy road, and it is said to be haunted by some sort of half man
half goat (chevoman in spanish) i thought it was a urban legend but many
people i know has encountered something along the lines of it or knows
someone who seen the creature. (the road is creepy too). there is more
but ill find out and send any info to ur websites to be added in ur inventory.

<P><B>Cranky Old Man</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mia.k.wedeking@wamu.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story happened to my sister.&nbsp; She called me one morning
scared to</B>
<BR><B>death.</B>
<BR><B>My sister and her boyfriend live in this old house on a corner.&nbsp;
Her</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend told us that when he walked to school and pass by this
house</B>
<BR><B>this old cranky man would stand outside to make sure the kids did
not</B>
<BR><B>walk on his lawn.&nbsp; All the kids would play pranks on him etc.
(this was</B>
<BR><B>when he was in jr. high school).&nbsp; Well years passed by and
he noticed</B>
<BR><B>the house was for rent.&nbsp; He checked it out and found out the
old man was</B>
<BR><B>put up in a retirement home by his kids.&nbsp; Well, my sister and
her</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend moved in not too long after that. After a few weeks went
by</B>
<BR><B>one morning after her boyfriend went to work at about 5:00am she
heard</B>
<BR><B>footsteps walking down the hall coming towards the bedroom door.&nbsp;
At</B>
<BR><B>first she thought her boyfriend came back because he forgot something,</B>
<BR><B>then she looked out her bedroom window and noticed his car was not</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; She thought maybe it was an intruder that came in through
the</B>
<BR><B>back door so she ran and hid in the closet.&nbsp; After a few moments
the</B>
<BR><B>house was quiet and she got enough nerve to check it out.&nbsp;
Well, the</B>
<BR><B>back door was locked and she thought maybe she was hearing things.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>very next morning around 5:00am she heard the same footsteps walking</B>
<BR><B>down the hall towards the bedroom. They stopped and then she heard
the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom door open.&nbsp; This happened almost every morning after
her</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend would leave.&nbsp; She would get so scared that she would
lay there</B>
<BR><B>in fright.&nbsp; Well, come to find out the old man died not too
long after</B>
<BR><B>they moved into the house.&nbsp; She called me up one morning scared
to</B>
<BR><B>death.&nbsp; I told her next time you hear those footsteps. Open
the bedroom</B>
<BR><B>door and tell him that you are living there now and you will make
sure</B>
<BR><B>that you and your boyfriend will take care of the house and that
you</B>
<BR><B>will not let anybody walk on the lawn so he can go to the light
now and</B>
<BR><B>rest in peace.&nbsp; (sounds crazy, I know).&nbsp; Well, she did
just that (she</B>
<BR><B>was scared to death to open the door, but she did, she had me on
the</B>
<BR><B>phone).&nbsp; Sure enough she has not heard those footsteps for
over a</B>
<BR><B>year.&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister and my mother must be sensitive types
because they</B>
<BR><B>have these sorts of things happen throughout their lives.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately, I have never seen or heard a ghost but for some reason
I</B>
<BR><B>seem to be surrounded by people who have strange experiences and
my</B>
<BR><B>sister always asks me what to do and then it stops.&nbsp; Also,
everynight</B>
<BR><B>between 5 and 6pm I get 3 phone calls where there is nobody there.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>sit and listen for a good 30 seconds until the phone dies.</B>

<BR><B>“Carlos”</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: reggaerat79@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>You previously posted my experiences.&nbsp; One of them was about
the “Black</B>
<BR><B>Man.”&nbsp; I had forgotten about this.&nbsp; I really don’t know
how, since my</B>
<BR><B>godbrother likes to remind me about it every once in a while.&nbsp;
Anyway.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>friends cousin was in town.&nbsp; Her cousin has a daughter that
she brought with</B>
<BR><B>her.&nbsp; We were all at my parents house one day.&nbsp; My godbrother
and I were</B>
<BR><B>sitting in the living room on the couch that faces the kitchen.&nbsp;
My friend,</B>
<BR><B>her cousin, and my sister were somewhere in the living room, but
right now I</B>
<BR><B>can’t pinpoint where exactly.&nbsp; Well, the little girl, who was
about four or</B>
<BR><B>five, was in the kitchen just playing.&nbsp; She was talking to
someone and my</B>
<BR><B>godbrother jokingly asked her who she was talking to.&nbsp; She
replied,</B>
<BR><B>“Carlos,” as she looked over at us over the sink.&nbsp; “He used
to sleep in your</B>
<BR><B>room, but he doesn’t anymore,” she said looking at me and my sister
(we’ve</B>
<BR><B>always shared a room in this house).&nbsp; My heart just dropped
and the blood</B>
<BR><B>drained out of me.&nbsp; I coudn’t even speak!&nbsp; My godbrother
asked her what</B>
<BR><B>“Carlos” looked like.&nbsp; She told him that he was tall and had
curly hair.</B>
<BR><B>(Just like the “Black Man”).&nbsp; He started to get scared.&nbsp;
She said other</B>
<BR><B>things, but I can’t remember now.&nbsp; I think she said that he
had slept in my</B>
<BR><B>parents room or in the living room also, but he didn’t anymore.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>godbrother asked her if he was still there and she said yes.&nbsp;
Again, I was</B>
<BR><B>so freaked out I didn’t hear much else.&nbsp; Her mother said that
they had a</B>
<BR><B>friend named Carlos but he didn’t have curly hair.&nbsp; Could it
be that</B>
<BR><B>coincidental that the “Black Man” and “Carlos” fit the same description?&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>never investigated about the house.&nbsp; I know my parents bought
it and we were</B>
<BR><B>the first ones to live in it, but who knows what was in this area.&nbsp;
Well,</B>
<BR><B>that’s my experience.</B>

<BR><B>Bedroom Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mackie182000@yahoo.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>Two years ago my brother was playing football out in the back garden
when he suddenly looked up in to his bedroom window. There looking out
at him was an old lady. He went and told our mum, who went up stairs to
investigate and there was no-one up there. Then a couple of months later
it was about 11.30 at night, I was watching t.v in my bedroom when suddenly
I heard this scream. I went into my brothers bedroom, and there he was
sitting at the bottom of his bed and this old lady was standing over him
(like your mum does when she checks your temperature). Then, when my mum
came in, the old lady turned round smiled and vanished. My mum then started
to cry, when I asked she told me to come into her bedroom. She got out
a photo book and there was the old lady in one of the pictures.</B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp;&nbsp; kiix@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This has proven to be harder to write that I thought it would be.&nbsp;
I am a Native American</B>
<BR><B>My family is traditional, so the presence of the supernatural was
always accepted.</B>
<BR><B>This doesn't mean that I ain't a big scaried cat.&nbsp; My mother,
sister and brother have</B>
<BR><B>always had the 'luck' to see spirits.&nbsp; My father had been raised
a strict anglican however</B>
<BR><B>he was open to more traditional customs and in the end returned
to the old ways.&nbsp; I don't</B>
<BR><B>see spirits, i hear them and can feel them and spirits/energy seem
to like me.</B>
<BR><B>I have tons of stories but I will only relay two incidents today.</B>
<BR><B>One deals with the old victorian house our office used to</B>
<BR><B>be located at in London Ontario Canada.&nbsp; This house was built
back in 1880's and i just love the woodwork and tin ceilings inside.&nbsp;
What you make up for in wood you loose in plumbing amendities.&nbsp; Anyways,
I was working late one night on the second floor and I could hear children
laughing, screaming in fun and I didn't think anything of it.&nbsp; There
was a daycare just up the street and then I realized that it was pretty
darn dark for anyone to be still at daycare.&nbsp; I checked out one of
the front windows and the daycare was dark.&nbsp; I could still hear the
kids so I went around the offices checking to see if anything was around.&nbsp;
There were&nbsp; no children to be seen anywhere.&nbsp; This had happened
for months and I had not thought anything of it because it was happening
when the sun was still up...I thought it was next door. I went to a healing
event and at one of the sessions there was a respected traditional healer
I asked him about the kids and some other things that had happened.&nbsp;
My boss past suddenly and and knew that he was stopping by -- he loved
popcorn and I could get whiffs of it once in a while.&nbsp; I would just
tell him hi and I needed to get work done and the presence would leave.
Back to the children, I was told that it was a boy and girl who had passed
away more than a 100&nbsp; years ago in a nearby house.&nbsp; They saw
me and liked me and wanted to play because I looked like a fun person.&nbsp;
The office moved not long after that.&nbsp; The few times I have gone back
to the old</B>
<BR><B>office, it's just like they're waiting and I start hearing the laughter
and squeals again.</B>
<BR><B>Before the office moved, I had acquired a dog--don't touch a stray
puppy unless you really really want a dog!!&nbsp; Needless to say, I moved
out to the country with my new puppy and was renting a house.&nbsp; This
meant that I was driving about one hour one way to work.&nbsp; I didn't
mind the drive, it was MY time. One day I had gotten a Joanne Shenandoah
cd and was playing it in the car.&nbsp; She was singing</B>
<BR><B>a traditional song in the language and I was attempting to sing
along with her when someone from the empty back seat of my car decided
to start singing along with me.&nbsp; Her voice was just right off my shoulder
and she had a pure clear "young" voice.&nbsp; I almost drove into the ditch!!</B>
<BR><B>I said out loud, "I'm glad you like the song, but don't sing in
the car again."&nbsp; I felt</B>
<BR><B>silly talking to myself but my heart was beating a mile a minute.&nbsp;
I shut the cd off and</B>
<BR><B>drove home in silence cause I was scared and shaking.&nbsp; I said,
i believe, i didn't say I was</B>
<BR><B>overly brave.</B>
<BR><B>I have more stories, maybe I'll find time to add them in later.</B><B></B>

<P><B>All True Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JBlondie0328@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I've got several stories - relatively short in nature that I've experienced
or my family has experienced.&nbsp; I am deeply interested in this subject
but it's hard to tell non-believers since they'll just ridicule me.</B>
<BR><B>I have never 'seen" a ghost.&nbsp; I've heard them. And it's not
like they make clanking sounds or doors opening or closing.&nbsp; It's
not like they are walking or you hear footsteps.&nbsp; The only thing I
can relate it to is if I know there's no one physically there but it seems
like someones come into the room.&nbsp; For example, in the first house
my parents owned, I'd come home from school and mom would be downstairs
or outside and I'd swear she just come out of the hallway. I'd look up
and no one would be there.&nbsp; Same thing with a house that I rented
a few years ago.&nbsp; The feeling that someone came into the room but
no ones there.&nbsp; And it never frightens me.</B>
<BR><B>As far as stories go, here's two that I experienced that were odd.</B>
<BR><B>I worked for an Insurance Co that was around for awhile.&nbsp; I
worked in a desk at the front of the office with about 30-40 people behind
me.&nbsp; Being in the front, I could see everyone in the office at all
times.&nbsp; I was working on the computer and it sounded like someone
coming down the hall.&nbsp; I looked up and again no one was there.&nbsp;
I didn't think anything about it, maybe I just missed the person walking
by.&nbsp; I went to lunch with my boss and friend.&nbsp; For some reason,
I said, "I think we have a ghost in our office." And I laughed, nervously,
waiting for the ridicule.&nbsp; My boss and my friend stopped cold and
looked at me.&nbsp; My boss said "Have you heard that story about so and
so(I can't remember the name they gave). I said no and they proceeded to
tell me about a claims adjuster who killed himself in the building years
back.&nbsp; That was really spooky.</B>
<BR><B>The next story is about my best friends mothers house.&nbsp; My
best friend Amanda still lived with her mom and she had a 3 yr named Thomas.&nbsp;
They just moved into this house at the time.&nbsp; Sharon, Amanda's mom,
told me that Thomas usually said he talks to his "friends" in the kitchen
and his bedroom.&nbsp; Figuring he's just being a toddler and has imaginary
playmates, she's always ignored him.&nbsp; But Sharon proceeds to tell
me that one night, she got up to get a glass of water from the kitchen.&nbsp;
As she's walking through the living room, she swears that Thomas grabbed
leg.&nbsp; She turned on the light to chastise him for being out of bed
and he's not there.&nbsp; She went into Thomas' room and he was sleeping.&nbsp;
For a few years, Thomas always pointed to the kitchen cabinets and said
his "friends" live in there.&nbsp; Not the cabinets near the floor, the
ones above the sink and stove!</B>
<BR><B>2 more then I'm done.</B>
<BR><B>My uncle John lives in Winston Salem NC.&nbsp; He used to work at
the old RJ Reynolds home "Tanglewood" in Clemmons NC.&nbsp; He worked in
the kitchen and had heard some other people had encounters with ghosts
in the dining room.&nbsp; Being a non-believer, he shrugged them off.&nbsp;
Until one night he and one other were preparing for a banquet the next
day.&nbsp; They set all the chairs upside down on the table so first thing
in the morning, they could wax the floors.&nbsp; They put away everything
in the kitchen and left for the night.&nbsp; When they came back the next
day, the kitchen had all the utensils out on the counters and pots and
pans laid everywhere and all the chairs were down on the floor.&nbsp; They
weren't set neatly where they go, just all over the place in random fashion.&nbsp;
I don't know whether to believe Uncle John on this one but he said it happened
and he doesn't believe in ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>This last story is scary and my Uncle Joey swears it's true.&nbsp;
He actually gets mad at me when I tell him he must have been sleeping.</B>
<BR><B>About 10-15 years ago, my uncle still lived with my grandparents.&nbsp;
He lived downstairs off the garage.&nbsp; He said he was sleeping and woke
up when he heard someone coming in from the garage.&nbsp; He said he heard
what sounded like a dog sniffing around the living room outside his bedroom.&nbsp;
The sniffing got louder as it came to his door. The door never opened and
he said the sniffing grew louder as the animal seemed to be in his room.&nbsp;
It sniffed around and it smelled really foul.&nbsp; By this time, Uncle
Joey was terrified and had slid from his bed and into the crack between
his bed and the wall with his hands over his head.&nbsp; The animal seemed
to jump on the bed, still sniffing, and it was right over his bed, breathing
heavily.&nbsp; He said he felt his hair move each time it breathed.&nbsp;
Then it left abruptly out of the room.&nbsp; He said he stayed there between
the bed and wall for a good 3 hours. When he felt like he could move, he
turned on all the lights and looked around.&nbsp; All the doors were closed
and the garage door was locked from the inside.&nbsp; He swears it was
some devil dog because of the smell of it.</B>

<P><B>I'm 10 years old. This happened to me when I was 9. I was at my Nana's
house</B>
<BR><B>downstairs in her basement. The basement had wood going up and down
the walls</B>
<BR><B>and in the back there was a bar,&nbsp; and next to the bar was a
Christmas tree</B>
<BR><B>dressed up like an&nbsp; alien(for what reason i don't know). In
front of the bar</B>
<BR><B>was a tv and a living area,&nbsp; and next to the living area was
a pool table and</B>
<BR><B>stairs. My cousin Steven and I were downstairs watching tv when
I saw the</B>
<BR><B>shoulder part of Steven's shirt begin to crumple and pull up by
unseen hands.</B>
<BR><B>I yelled and felt something pull me up the same way. We turned around
to see</B>
<BR><B>what it was. We saw the chandelier on the ceiling spin real fast
and it</B>
<BR><B>wouldn't stop. Then,&nbsp; we saw a ghost with a long cape floating
around it. It</B>
<BR><B>flew into the tree, and the tree moved around like the chandelier
and the</B>
<BR><B>face of the alien costume on the tree looked at us strange. Steven
and I ran</B>
<BR><B>as fast as we could upstairs and went to go sit into the car...we
were</B>
<BR><B>screaming in the car and wouldn't go back inside. We stayed in the
car for</B>
<BR><B>two hours..we didn't go back in</B><B></B>

<P><B>Underwood Devil???</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Faqstaq187@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i have seen the devil i think, its gonna sound strange i know but
this really happened to me.&nbsp; when i was young ,,about 10 years old,
i was with my grandmother driving all around town looking for some halloween
costume</B>
<BR><B>and was having a problem locating a store with anything worth a
damm.</B>
<BR><B>finally we settled for a local k-mart store,,.we bought my costume
and were heading home ,then my grandmother said she was going to stop for
a pizza</B>
<BR><B>at the local pizza hut.that was cool with me,, i was starving. so
we pulled into the parkinglot&nbsp; of the pizza hut and my grandma told
me to wait here and not get out of the car cus it was dark,,back then everyone
was left in the car??i guess..</B>
<BR><B>so in she went. i was ok just listening to the radio when sumthin
caught my attention to the right just behind the pizza hut. the area was
wooded and dark ,just as it is to this day.all but this strange red glow
inside this cove of trees. i was now</B>
<BR><B>taken in by the bright flickering light and watched in amazement
as the light took on the form of flames ,sparks and finaly took on a human
form.well,,almost human</B>
<BR><B>it looked more like electricity "lightning" and it started to dance
and jump around in some super fast unnatural way..it looked like a verry
thin red creature"the devil"</B>
<BR><B>this will sound corny but i swear it looked like that damm uderwood
deviled ham devil, you know,,the one on the can..this was real. suddenly
the thing was at my window just looking at me as if to say....i know you
see me ,,and i see you....</B>
<BR><B>man i crawled over the seat into the back and cowwered on the floorboard&nbsp;
until</B>
<BR><B>my grandma came out and had to calm me down .it took her a while
but she finaly got throuhg to me and i came around,,then we went home.
i told her what happened to me and she got mad and told me i should not

<P><B>The Woman In Red</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: devixition@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My freshmen year in highschool, as I was walking home, I decided
to take a different way by the city park.&nbsp; A beautiful, warm summer
day in the middle of New Mexico.&nbsp; As I was walking down the sub-division,
I noticed an adobe house at the end of the street.&nbsp; Nothing unusual
about the small house, a black curtain blowing in the breeze though a sliding
glass door.&nbsp; At a second glance I saw something different, a woman
standing just outside of the house.&nbsp; She was pretty, tall in a red
shimmering dress, black curly hair and no shoes.&nbsp; Thinking nothing
of it, I nodded to her and went on my way.&nbsp; At the end of the sub-division
was a half torn down fence connecting to the park.</B>
<BR><B>I continued to get the feeling that someone was watching me, I had
no intention of looking back.&nbsp; Inside the park, sitting on the merry-go-round
I felt that something was terriblely wrong.&nbsp; The wind suddenly died
down, casting a quick glance toward my right to see that same woman walking&nbsp;
toward me.&nbsp; Waited a moment or two and looked again, she was still
there, getting even closer.&nbsp; That is when I picked up my back pack
and took off.&nbsp; I did not stop running till I got home.&nbsp; I told
my mother and sister about it, my sister was understanding while my mother
thought it was a phase I was going though.</B>
<BR><B>Later that night three of our friends came over, we all decided
to go to the park and play basketball.&nbsp; My sister and I, we figured
that the woman would either be gone or that maybe it wasn't real after
all.&nbsp; After playing ball for a hour or so, we all jumped on the merry-go-round.&nbsp;
One of the guys, would push us and then hop on and we all stared up at
the sky till we got dizzy.&nbsp; In an instant four out of the five of
us, we all looked at each other and we knew something was not right.&nbsp;
My sister and I, jumped off of the&nbsp; merry-go-round and headed for
the car.&nbsp; Two of our friends were right behind us in seconds, then
we were alright in the car and waited on the last of our company.</B>
<BR><B>As the car was turning back onto the street, I looked back and there
she was walking through the gate, following behind us.&nbsp; We raced around
town trying to find a safe place to hind.&nbsp; We went to a church, but
the gates were locked to the parking lot so we could not get in.&nbsp;
Ending up back at my house, all five of us sat in the car to frighted to
get out.&nbsp; Not ten feet away from us, in the woods on the other side
of the allyway, she just stood there.&nbsp; After ten or fifteen mintues
we knew we had to make a run for it, at the count of three we just ran.</B>
<BR><B>She stayed right outside the house, until our friends went home.&nbsp;
Driving home our friends were still pretty scared.&nbsp; One of the guys
looked out of his side window, and there she was floating beside the car
smiling at him.&nbsp; For days she stayed afew feet away from where ever
I was.&nbsp; I could not sleep very well, she kept entering my dreams.&nbsp;
One night the spirit that lived in our house came to me while I slept.&nbsp;
I was asleep in the living room, right where I fell.&nbsp; Our residental
ghost was named Fred,&nbsp; as I woke up from one of the nightmares she
ran rampent through, there he was.&nbsp; Standing at the end of my blanket
just watching over me.&nbsp; As if already in a dream I drifted off to
sleep, not long to awake again.</B>
<BR><B>This time when I awoke Fred was standing guard at the door, keeping
her on the other side of it.&nbsp; With a look from the door to me, in
his eyes I seen a look that told me he was trying to help.&nbsp; The next
time I woke he was laying beside me.</B>
<BR><B>After that I consitered him my guardian angel, because throw anything
eles I went Though he was right there by my side.</B>

<P><B>The Visitor in the Hotel Room</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: tjacobs@minolta.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>In 1997 I was participating in a beauty pageant in my home country
(Zimbabwe) - All the pageant contestants were staying at the Sheraton Hotel
for the night - there were a total of 20 girls from all over the country
staying there that night - and there were two girls per room.. the funny
thing is that all the other girls got rooms with 2 beds in them except
for myself and my roommate ...&nbsp; Anyway what followed I did not see
- but my roommate was quite freaked out the next morning...</B>
<BR><B>I was the first night we spent at the hotel and I had the most beautiful
beaded dress that my aunt had bought for me... now I'm quite an outgoing
person and I wanted to show my dress off to the other girls before the
show - so I went to the around visiting the other girls room's laughing
and joking with them&nbsp; ... I returned to my room pretty late and my
roommate was already in bed - so I put my dress away and crawled into be
and fell into a deep sleep...</B>
<BR><B>The next morning my roommate was rather pissed with me - she told
that it was inconsiderate of me to bring my friends in the room late at
night when she was trying to sleep... I told her I hadn't come in the room
with anyone ... (and I hadn't) - she told me to stop messing around and
that there had been someone else in the bed with us - I asked her what
she meant - she told me that she was feeling crowded in the bed and so
she woke up and there was another girl sitting on the bed between us and
when my roommate turned to fix here headscarf the girl giggled jumped off
the bed and ran out of the room...&nbsp; My roommate said she just went
back to bed after that (coz she thought we were being silly)... and she
knows she woke up because she had adjust her headscarf (that had come loose
while she was sleeping)... I assured my roommate that I had not brought
anyone in the room and anger turned into fear - she got really freaked
out and told me to stop messing around... coz ... if I didn't bring this
girl in our room (and I didn't) then who did?&nbsp; This is one of those
hotels with an access card so the door locks from the outside automatically
and you can't get in without an access card... My roommate was very unsettled
by this because back home people believe very much in witchcraft and the
likes and she thought someone had possibly sent someone (a witch) to jinx
me ....&nbsp; she felt strongly that this thing/person was there for me
...</B>
<BR><B>But that was not the first time that people who have shared a room
with me have heard things - before that I was staying at my aunts place
and 3 of my cousins were told to sleep in my room .... again I slept like
a baby that night - but the next morning when I woke up for work - noone
was in my room - I was puzzled and found them all sleeping on the floor
in my aunts room - when I asked them why they left they told me that they
had heard a sound like a baby's laughter by my window in the night - again
I heard nothing - they refused to sleep in my room again....</B>

<P><B>The Bracelet</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: blackacid55@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here is a confusing/ghost story I'd love to share with you all:</B>
<BR><B>It was a year or so ago, and I was removing my jewelry since I was
about to go into the shower. I placed it on my sink counter, and then I
stepped into the shower. A little while later, something caught my eye
up above; then I looked down, and my braclet that my friend gave to me
was lying on the shower floor. The braclet somehow, mysteriously flew over
my shower door. It was a braclet my friend bought for me in Mexico; it
was a green colour with a small white flower in it. I was sure that no
one else was in the bathroom; I lock the door in the bathroom so no one
walks in. Just in case, I asked my mother, sister and father if they came
into the bathroom; they replied no. I won't jump to conclusions saying
that it was a ghost that came into my bathroom; but it was a little freaky.</B>

<P><B>By: rachel.ward@redcross.org.nz</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I lived next to a cemetery when I was younger and was constantly
scaring</B>
<BR><B>myself with ghosts books and stories of haunting, even though, the
thought</B>
<BR><B>of something appearing to me for whatever reason makes me weary.</B>
<BR><B>Here's one that I know is true, as told by my trusted friend who
was that</B>
<BR><B>scared afterwards, she was too afraid to tell anyone what happened
because</B>
<BR><B>she thought something would happen to her. Names changed and so
on</B>
<BR><B>Maree Lissa and Tarni were visiting a friend out in the country
located near</B>
<BR><B>Taurunga NZ - the place their friend lived is near an area where
there were</B>
<BR><B>a lot of deaths as results of land wars when the British settled
and fought</B>
<BR><B>with the Maori inhabitants. It was around 2 in the morning, they
had been</B>
<BR><B>drinking, my cousin Lissa wasn't - she gets tired and ends up sleeping
so</B>
<BR><B>she refrains. They got a ride to their friends and then the person
that</B>
<BR><B>drove them there left to head back into town. Their friend wasn't
home and</B>
<BR><B>hadn't bothered to tell them, so they were stuck out in the middle
of</B>
<BR><B>nowhere at 2 in the morning with no ride.</B>
<BR><B>They sat and started to think when Tarni needed to go loo, so she
wandered</B>
<BR><B>away to find a dignifying bush or whatever, when Lissa looked over
to check</B>
<BR><B>where she had gone she saw something that scared her a lot - An
Uru Pa, I</B>
<BR><B>don't expect people to know what this is - it's a Maori Burial Ground,
just</B>
<BR><B>like any normal cemetery, Tarni was relieving herself by a tree
in the</B>
<BR><B>grounds.</B>
<BR><B>Tarni came back, Lissa wasn't too happy and then Maree just went
blue and</B>
<BR><B>started shaking, she said she could feel someone watching her and
was</B>
<BR><B>staring straight ahead looking scared out of her wits. Lissa told
me she</B>
<BR><B>didn't even look up and even though Tarni was spouting off about
how the</B>
<BR><B>Maori are full of it she seemed scared too. Maree said she could
see a</B>
<BR><B>"Kuia" known in the Maori culture as a very wise and well respected
elderly</B>
<BR><B>lady. She was standing not far from them on a hill holding one single
white</B>
<BR><B>flower, dressed in a long shirt (as described) sort of gown. Maree
said she</B>
<BR><B>couldn't tell whether the Kuia was waving or attempting to shoo
them away.</B>
<BR><B>They totally freaked and decided they should just find somewhere
to sleep or</B>
<BR><B>hide. Beside the Uru Pa was some broken down machinery - out in
the</B>
<BR><B>country - farmers old vehicles etc - they climbed into the cab of
an old</B>
<BR><B>truck and huddled together and tried to sleep. Two minutes later
they heard</B>
<BR><B>a car pull up, someone got out ran up to the Uru Pa, came back stood
right</B>
<BR><B>beside the cab and then left again. This scared them even more so
they</B>
<BR><B>started to panic and decided to walk home.</B>
<BR><B>They were running towards the road and saw a car, when Tarni stopped
the</B>
<BR><B>car, Lissa saw the "patches" on the drivers arm, he was a member
of a gang -</B>
<BR><B>at that time there were younger girls their ages going missing -
a lot and</B>
<BR><B>Lissa took the initiative to pull Tarni away. The man looked at
them both,</B>
<BR><B>smiled and then winked and drove off.</B>
<BR><B>As they were walking down the road, it was rural remember, native
bush and</B>
<BR><B>scrub all around them on a one lane road. Lissa said she sweared
that all</B>
<BR><B>she could smell was flowers, then a dead rotten smell like someone
was</B>
<BR><B>standing right behind her with an animals carcass in their hands
-</B>
<BR><B>literally - she didn't tell her friends, they were scared enough
already.</B>
<BR><B>Instead she hailed the nearest car when they got to the main road
and</B>
<BR><B>fortunately it was an elderly man that gave them a ride to Lissa's
house.</B>
<BR><B>Maree's father had been calling all night and worried that something
was</B>
<BR><B>wrong with Maree, he didn't know what it was, but he was calling
Lissa's</B>
<BR><B>saying he wanted her home right away.</B>
<BR><B>You can all believe or not believe, it's hard when you don't know
the</B>
<BR><B>spiritual values of the Maori Culture - all I know is that they're
stupid</B>
<BR><B>for even going to an Uru Pa at night under the influence of alcohol,
the</B>
<BR><B>dead should be respected.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Eagle Lake, Texas</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: forevermoore@wcnet.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In December, 2001, my family moved into a house at 200 W. Post Office
Street in Eagle Lake, Texas. It is a two-story home that was built in the
early 1900's. At one point, this house was used as a bed and breakfast.
I do not</B>
<BR><B>know much more of that history. However, during the brief time we
lived there, we experienced some unexplained incidents that we decided
must be a ghost. During the morning hours, usually between 9 am and 12
noon, heavy</B>
<BR><B>footsteps can be heard throughout the house. They sound like a man's
heavy work boots hitting the wooden floors and stairs. There are many cold
spots throughout the house, and a constant feeling of being watched.</B>
<BR><B>My sister-in-law did not know about the ghost, and was babysitting
one day and heard the footsteps. While discussing this with my husband,
a pen flew across the room after my husband referred to the ghost as "Casper".
The</B>
<BR><B>children had reported hearing strange noises at night when they
went to bed, although after I asked the ghost to stop scaring the kids,
the kids did stop hearing things. I suppose that means the ghost was “kid
friendly”!</B>
<BR><B>One evening when we returned late, the lights were on upstairs,
although I was certain they had been off when we left, and I saw someone’s
shadow in an upstairs window, although no one was in the house.</B>
<BR><B>As I said, I do not know any of the history of the house, other
than what I told you earlier. There are several “old timers” in town, however,
that can probably tell you some things. I do know the house remained empty
for several years after the elderly woman who owned it died. I do not know
if anyone else has ever witnessed anything in that house. When I discussed
the events with some people in town, however, nobody seemed surprised.</B>

<BR><B>Corner of my Eye</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kez_moo@yahoo.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>About 3 years ago I was helping my friend baby-sit her 3 nephews
at her sisters house. The house aways had a very eerie presence, and that
night I was alone downstairs while she was bathing the boys, no one else
was in the house. Just then I called to her and I heard her shout that
she was upstairs, so I went up there to see her, she told me to go back
downstairs but I really didn't want to be down there alone so I went up
despite what she said. Now this seems normal you think? Well...no. It was
about six months later when I was thinking about it and I realised that
I knew my friend was upstairs so why had I called for her as if she was
in the next room? It was because I saw someone out of the corner of my
eyes walk past the door and also heard shuffling as if someone ws tidying
up. As you can imagine, this was pretty freaky!</B>
<BR><B>Other weird things have hapened in that house before and after this
occasion, for example the toilet flushing by its self.</B>

<P><B>Our Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lizstui@bigpond.net.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my husband and I were first married we lived in a 100 year old
house which is old by our standards here in Australia. It was a really
nice house terraced house, the middle house of five. All five were on a
hill which sloped down and away from the street frontage so that you went
up 3 steps to the verandah and front door and were then on the upper level
of the house. There were two bedrooms and a bathroom on the upper level
and a full flight of stairs led down to the lower level, the front part
of which was almost completely underground (nice in summer). When it was
first built our house had had two front entrances, the front door which
we still used, and another door underneath the verandah accessed by 3 steps
down from the garden - however this area underneath the verandah had been
enclosed at some stage and made into a long narrow room with bookshelves
on either side of the steps, now only accessible from our lounge-room.
Right from the start I noticed this strange room was always cold but passed
it off as being due to a combination of being half underground and having
been enclosed with glass rather than a more solid material. I was always
uncomfortable being in there, nothing I can put my finger on, just a general
anxiety not to stay long. Then we started having incidencences of lights
turning themselves on and off and needless to say, it was the conservatory
light which was the main culprit. At first I just thought I had been forgetting
to turn them off then after a few more times, I realised that there might
be more to it than that. Then the conservatory light turned itself off
right in front of our eyes one night when we were sitting in the the lounge.
My blood ran cold - yuk! - my husband, ever the sceptic, tried to come
up with an explanation but was stumped.</B>
<BR><B>Lights being turned on and off were the main occurences in that
house but there were two other incidents that are worth mentioning. One
was late at night when lying in bed, the bathroom taps turned themselves
on. I know we didnt leave them on as I heard the water start gushing, and
besides which, when I went to see what was going on, I found both taps
on full bore and we wouldnt have left them like that. Interestingly, our
cat was staring at them without moving which I found odd at the time. The
second incident was again at night when we were in bed. We heard footsteps
- and I dont mean "is it, isnt it?" type foosteps, these sounded as if
the person was wearing hobnail boots and they were very certain and sure
footsteps&nbsp; -&nbsp; come up the front steps, stop at the front door
then clump along to our window. My husband, thinking it was a burglar,
was out of bed in a flash and threw the curtains open and of course there
was nothing there. Again, the eerie thing about it was our cat bushed her
fur up to twice her size and let out one of those goddawful keening yowls
- the kind they make when they are scared silly - I think she scared me
more than our "ghost". Anyway, we moved out after a year and my husband
still tries to write the whole thing off as possums, faulty wiring and
faulty plumbing - what more proof does the man need? :-)</B>

<BR><B>Oldest House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gebby_girl123@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I&nbsp; am only 12 years old and i have the scariest house EVER!
Well&nbsp; a scary</B>
<BR><B>STORY to tell. My house is the oldest in my little town. And many
things</B>
<BR><B>have gone on here over the 204 years it has been standing. Around
early</B>
<BR><B>1900's, a small boy drown in a well, that was once in our back yard.
Also,</B>
<BR><B>in the 1950's a man&nbsp; hung himself in our house, we aren't sure
where but i</B>
<BR><B>have a 8 foot tall ceilinng and it is possible that he hung himself
in MY</B>
<BR><B>room.</B>
<BR><B>I have seen the ghosts several times over the past 2 years. I think
the</B>
<BR><B>scariest one was one night the day before the first day of school,
I'v</B>
<BR><B>always had trouble sleeping on the night before school starts. It
was 2 in</B>
<BR><B>the morning, and i was scaredm of the dark so, i was staring straight
at my</B>
<BR><B>wall, i losed my eays for a split second, and... when i opened them...i
saw</B>
<BR><B>the scariest thing ever...a bright white face staring straight back
at me! I</B>
<BR><B>shut my eays at tight as i could and went to sleep, when i woke
up there was</B>
<BR><B>a small handprint on my sheet.</B>
<BR><B>I have seen only one other really SCARY time was when i was ging
back to</B>
<BR><B>school after christmas break, i can also never sleep that night
either. Well</B>
<BR><B>since my house is so old my, floors creak when ever anyone walks
right</B>
<BR><B>outside my room. and they made a specific sound that only a human
makes when</B>
<BR><B>they walk there, the dogs aren't heavy enough and don't make any
sound when</B>
<BR><B>they walk over the floor there. I can see straight out my door from
my bed,</B>
<BR><B>and that's how i know this was a ghost, the floor was creaking like
crazy</B>
<BR><B>and there was nothing there! I then heard footsteps in my room,
again i</B>
<BR><B>close my eays as tight as i could and went to sleep. When i woke
up my</B>
<BR><B>carpet had been thrown under my bed.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing this serious has ever happened in ym house since then ,
and i'm</B>
<BR><B>glad. Thanks for listening.</B>

<P><B>Newnan, Georgia - Old Slave Museum</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sthompson@franchiseopportunities.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My great aunt owned two old shotgun houses from the mill village
days.&nbsp; They were both identical.&nbsp; She lived in one of the houses
and rented out the other house.&nbsp; When I was in high school in the
late 1980s she had to kick a guy out that was renting the house for non-payment.&nbsp;
After he left I and my high school girlfriend went in the house one night
to see what kind of mess he had left.&nbsp; It was dark, but probably not
very late.&nbsp; The power was out so we had to use a flashlight.&nbsp;
In the middle room of the small house was a pentagram burned into the floor.&nbsp;
When I saw it I had a vision in my head of the room being red, maybe from
candle light, and a group of people standing around the image.&nbsp; They
were all wearing black.&nbsp; I was a little freaked out by the image,
but tried not to think about it.&nbsp; Then my girlfriend said she just
had a terrible thought.&nbsp; She then explained to me the exact thing
I had just seen in my head.&nbsp; Then I was really freaked out.&nbsp;
We left quickly.</B>
<BR><B>The house remained empty and a few years ago my aunt died and the
house was donated to a historical society in Newnan, Georgia.&nbsp; It
has now been moved to the site of an old slave graveyard and is used as
a museum and headquarters.&nbsp; I have not spoken with anyone there yet,
but a friend told me that the staff has experienced some very odd things
in the house.&nbsp; They found two very unique crosses in the attic.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Shauna and when my daughter died she was only 3 years
old and i was scared to death that she wasnt going to understand what was
happening.&nbsp; ABout an hr before she passed away she grabbed my hand
and started naming all these people that she wanted me to tell them that
she loved them.&nbsp; I didnt understand what she was doing this for and
why.&nbsp; It later hit me that she knew she was going to pass away and
she was warning me.&nbsp; I was so worried and upset because I didnt tell
her that God would take care of her and that she would be okay up there
with him.&nbsp; A few days later I was sitting in the living room by myself
and I saw her in this beautiful white dress that I had never seen before
and she looked up at me and said, " Look mommy, I'm okay now.&nbsp; Look
Im okay!"&nbsp; I started crying.&nbsp; That was the first and the last
time I ever saw her but I often feel her touch and can smell her late at
night.</B>

<BR><B>Mom's "Friend"ly Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sframke@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This past weekend my mom and I were talking. Somehow we got around
to the</B>
<BR><B>subject of ghosts. Mom mentioned that last Thursday (1 week ago
today) she</B>
<BR><B>was wrapping presents for my niece's 4th birthday. She looked at
her watch</B>
<BR><B>because she wanted to make sure not to forget to turn the TV to
"Friends,"</B>
<BR><B>as it was on the Mariners game. No sooner had she thought that when
she</B>
<BR><B>suddenly heard the show come on. She looked over and saw that it
was on. She</B>
<BR><B>asked my step-dad if he had turned it, but he said he hadn't. He
was in the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen. She initially thought maybe it was a re-run on the channel
she had</B>
<BR><B>been watching. But she realized they wouldn't have "Friends" on
Fox Sports</B>
<BR><B>Channel. She then decided to turn it to NBC, but it was on the same
show,</B>
<BR><B>since it was already on the correct channel. She then hit the "last"
button</B>
<BR><B>on her remote and it went back to the M's game. Somehow the TV had
changed</B>
<BR><B>itself right when my mom thought about "Friends." Hmmmm......</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in a house that was built directly behind a cemetery. I never
really had any problems living in the house until one evening in October-
or so.&nbsp; I remember it being incredibly humid outside&nbsp; and I knew
there was going to be a thunderstorm.&nbsp; My dogs (three Black Labradors)
were acting really nervous as well.&nbsp; Later on in the evening (after
dark), Missy, my smallest Lab came in the living room and was barking at
ONE AREA (maybe 12 inches by 12 inches in diameter)&nbsp; in the house
(staring up at the ceiling), and in the VERY same area- I smelled something
burning.&nbsp; My husband went and looked in the attic to see if maybe
something was burning up there- but there was nothing going on.&nbsp; The
burning smell later went away and the dogs calmed down.&nbsp; That night,
say, around 10 or so, my husband went to bed. there was a CRAZY thunderstorm
that night with LOUD thunder and BRIGHT lightning.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stayed
up for a little while and watched TV (still nervous about the burning smell).&nbsp;
Before I went to bed, I blew out the three candles I had lit. As I ALWAYS
make sure my candles are completely burned out- I always would lick my
thumb and my middle finger to make sure the flames would go completely
out.&nbsp; I laid in the bed and I hear music playing.&nbsp; It was my
answering machine!&nbsp; It was just playing music over and over and over
again.&nbsp; I got up and checked the phone- everything was as it should
be.&nbsp; I went back to bed.&nbsp; No sooner than I had laid down- the
fire alarm went off!&nbsp; (now this alarm ran on batteries- so electricity
could not of been a factor).&nbsp; Scared as all get-out- I got up and
got the alarm to stop.&nbsp; I went back to bed.&nbsp; The next morning
I asked my husband if he heard all the noises and he said he did- but he
was in such a deep sleep that he couldn't make himself get up...&nbsp;
(I think he was just SCARED!!).&nbsp; I told him how scared I was and how
I wanted to move and he thought I was over reacting.&nbsp; I turned all
the lights on in the dark living room and walked him to the front door
and kissed him goodbye.&nbsp; When I turned around to go into the kitchen-
I saw the three candles lit. The candles were NOT lit before my husband
left the house.&nbsp; I grabbed my clothes and my make up bag and got in
my car until it was time for me to go to work. I cried cause I was so scared.&nbsp;
The house never felt the same.&nbsp; I called my brother in law- I wont
get into his story, for confidentiality purposes, but he said that he had
felt an 'energy' in my house before.&nbsp; He said it wasn't an evil energy-
but it was most definitely an energy and that the storm we had experienced
the night before was a very powerful one and he had no doubt that there
was something in my house that night.</B>

<P><B>By: luvs2auction@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 21 years old I became a Certified Nursing Assistant and
started my career working grave yard in a nursing home.&nbsp; By this time
I had been firm believer in the ghost, but haven't really had anything
other then light going on and off, things moving across the room right
before your eyes, footsteps and the normal stuff that people see and hear.&nbsp;
Nothing too scary at this point.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, some of my co-workers told me about this one room that was
once occupied by a resident who passed away in that room.&nbsp; When I
was working there the room was used as conjugal visit room, but no one
ever used it as such the short time I was working there.&nbsp; They told
me that every night 2 am the call light would go off all on it's own.&nbsp;
Also, that the last person who was in the room died in that room and she
would turn on her call light every night as 2 am.&nbsp; Some were laughing
as they were telling me this so, I blew it off as a they were playing a
joke on the new person.</B>
<BR><B>Well, each night the call light would go on in that room at 2 am.&nbsp;
I would walk into a empty room to turn it off.&nbsp; Still thinking it
was just my co-workers playing a trick on me to see if they would get the
best of me.&nbsp; Well, one night I decided that I would just go and unplug
the call light and taped a little note to cord that said something to the
lines that the trick isn't working and I am not scared.&nbsp; I can't remember
what exactly it was over 8 years ago.</B>
<BR><B>2 am came and the call light went off.&nbsp; Thinking that who ever
turned it on, just plugged it back in. When I walked in the room I didn't
noticed anything out of the ordinary at first until I reached up to turn
off the call light and it was still unplugged but yet going off.&nbsp;
I had to plug it back in to turn it off because it wouldn't turn off when
I tried.&nbsp; That was when I noticed that it looked like some one was
laying on top of the bed and grayish misty shape to go long with it. At
first I was scared and started to get the heck out of the room,&nbsp; When
I turned to run out of the room I tripped and landed in a sitting position
on the other bed.&nbsp; I tried to get up, but I couldn't. The grayish
figure got up and moved towards me, reached out to me and I felt a hand
on my shoulder.&nbsp; As the I felt the touch on my shoulder all my fears
went away and I heard a voice say.&nbsp; "Don't worry dear, I wont hurt
you."&nbsp; Then it faded away.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after that I switched to swing shift, not from that incident,
but because being as young as I was working 10 pm to 6 am didn't fit my
party life style at the time.&nbsp; I had the same section on swing sift
as I did the NOC shift.&nbsp; Sometimes when I would walk past the room
I would hear my name being called, when I would look in I would see a transparent
woman in the room.&nbsp; Sometimes standing in front of the window and
other laying on the bed.&nbsp; Each time she would just smile and wav.</B>
<BR><B>Another incident happened when one of my residents started to fade
way and was reaching is final days.&nbsp; I went in to do my rounds and
was cleaning him up.&nbsp; This man hardly ever talked and never responded
when you would speak to him.&nbsp; If he did speak you couldn't make out
a thing he said.&nbsp; When I was just about finished the room started
to get this warm and peaceful feeling.&nbsp; Shortly after this heavenly
feeling filled the room the man lifted up his head and said to me.&nbsp;
"Young lady, who is the woman at the foot of my bed?"&nbsp; Of course I
didn't, but I did feel that we weren’t the only ones in the room.&nbsp;
I asked him what she looked like and he replied with.&nbsp; "Very beautiful…She
looks like an angel and she is calling me to her."&nbsp; I asked him what
else he saw.&nbsp; He told me that there is a tunnel of light behind her
and asked me if I thought if he should go with her.&nbsp; I told yes he
should then he said.&nbsp; "I am going to see my wife soon."&nbsp; I went
to and told the nurse what had just happened.&nbsp; She just looked at
me and smiled, went in to go and check on him to find that he had passed
away.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Rtbeebe@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen a ghost. I have seen her
twice. The first time I saw herI</B>
<BR><B>was in my room. I was looking in the mirror doing my makeup and
she ran into</B>
<BR><B>my room and then turned back around. I never saw her face, so naturally
I</B>
<BR><B>thought it might have been my sister so I walked into her room and
checked to</B>
<BR><B>see if it was her. It wasn't her and there wasn't anyone else in
the house</B>
<BR><B>except for my sister and me. The reason it couldn't be her is because
she was</B>
<BR><B>sitting on her legs in a chair and she had index cards spread in
neat little</B>
<BR><B>rows over her thighs. She was studying for a test or something.
I then asked</B>
<BR><B>her if she had seen HER? and my sister replied with "No, what are
you talking</B>
<BR><B>about?" and I just said nothing. That was the first incidence.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second one
happened when I was cleaning the dishes after dinner.</B>
<BR><B>The sink faces into the foyer and the livingroom. Well, I was cleaning
the</B>
<BR><B>dishes and SHE ran to the front foyer area and I saw her out of
the corner of</B>
<BR><B>my eye, but not so far as to the point that I could imagine seeing
her. I</B>
<BR><B>dropped my dishes and I tried to follow her, but when I turned the
corner</B>
<BR><B>going out of the kitchen she was gone. I thought it might have been
my sister</B>
<BR><B>again. I called her name and she answered me. She was in the livingroom
on</B>
<BR><B>the couch watching TV in the livingroom...on the opposite side of
the house.</B>
<BR><B>That is when I knew I had seen something that was not "real."</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I haven't described what she looked like yet but, she always
had straight</B>
<BR><B>brown long hair down the middle of her back exactly like mine and
she was</B>
<BR><B>always running. The one thing about her that freaked me out the
most is that</B>
<BR><B>she always had my lavender hoodie on whenever she ran. She was wearing
my</B>
<BR><B>clothes. why would she be wearing my clothes? I never saw her face.
Never.</B>
<BR><B>She wasn't transparent or anything either she was as solid looking
as a</B>
<BR><B>living human. I wonder who she was and why she was haunting a new
home that</B>
<BR><B>had never had anyone else living in it except my family. I do not
know where</B>
<BR><B>she came from and why I was the only person who ever saw her...maybe
she</B>
<BR><B>liked me. She never scared me or hurt me. Whenever I saw her I always
felt</B>
<BR><B>like it was a game of hide-n-seek or tag and that I wanted to play
with</B>
<BR><B>her...needless to say she always won...I never found her.</B>

<P><B>By: Meca1213@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A few years back when I was in foster care, I came across a woman
with many cats.&nbsp; I like her alot and so I felt safe and wanted.&nbsp;
she had her 18 year old daughter and her 2 year old son that stayed there
with her.&nbsp; the first night I was there I heard doors slaming, they
would open slowly and slam shut real fast.&nbsp; I thought it was her daughter.&nbsp;
I heard this for many nights and finally I asked my foster mom if she heard
the doors opening and slaming.&nbsp; she said sometimes, then her daughter
from across the room said maybe it's him.&nbsp; I asked who's him, but
my foster mom said nothing and walked away.&nbsp; I then asked her daughter
what she ment when she said maybe it's him.&nbsp; She told me when her
mother bought this house the the pervious owner went crazy after his wife
dided and shot himself in the basement, and that his soul never left.&nbsp;
MY foster mother over heard this and confronted me with the rest of the
story.&nbsp; she said that the people who comit suicide are angry and confused
and some even violent.&nbsp; My foster mom said she's been seen things
like this happen to her all of her life.&nbsp; In her last apt.&nbsp; she
was doing lanudry and her clothes basket started to move across the floor
like it was being draged.&nbsp; When she first moved in that house she
said the ghost would often lock her out when she went to go and get the
news paper, and everyone else in the house was asleep.&nbsp; One days she
said when she returned from shopping all her shutters and blinds were open
and all the food and cleaners the were in her coubords were everywherer
and all cats were locked in one room scared.&nbsp; well one night I got
scared because I heard the doors and I yelled out "knock it off, go away!"
and the it all stoped, 1 minute later my bed was shaking as if I was in
an earthquake.&nbsp; In the corner of my room I saw a half a man standing
there watching me, but he was fuzy kind of a black shadow, but the eyes
were so clear.&nbsp; I ran to my foster mothers room and slep there.&nbsp;
later the year I moved out, but I wont ever forget what happened.</B>

<P><B>A private residence.&nbsp; My gramma's house.&nbsp; It's haunted
by the ghost of a man who's been around for a long time.&nbsp; My Mom's
been seeing him since she was about 15 and I saw him myself when I was
5.&nbsp; He makes his presence known by making noise.&nbsp; He'll make
it sound like the water's running when it's not, the garage is being openend
when it's not, and he'll ring the doorbell.&nbsp; When you go to answer
it, no one's there.&nbsp; He has periods of "sleep" where he's inactive.&nbsp;
We're in the middle of one right now that's been going on for about five
years.&nbsp; That's about all.&nbsp; Oh, and I went to MVHS in Murrieta
for three years, I happen to know what a haunting feels like.&nbsp; The
only part that could possibly be haunted is the gymnasium and it's a residual
haunting.&nbsp; Just a replay.&nbsp; Nothing more.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I WROTE YOU A COUPLE OF DAYS AGOTELLING ABOUT MYSELF HEARING THINGS
IN MY HOME AND GETTING SWEET GRASS FROM A FRIEND. I TOOK YOUR ADVICE AND
MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING SINCE. ANYWAY, I JUST THOUGHT
OF&nbsp; A STORY MY MOTHER TOLD ME A FEW YEARS BACK. YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS
2. MY DAD'S DAD PASSED AWAY AT A YOUNG AGE. I WAS HIS LITTLE BUNNY. I DON'T
KNOW HOW LONG IT WENT ON FOR, BUT HEAR IT IS. THEY HAD A SUIT FOR GRANDPA
HANGING IN THE KITCHEN THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS FUNERAL. WHEN THEY WOKE THE
NEXT DAY, IT WAS ALL OVER THE FLOOR. WHEN THEY WENT TO HAVE HIS SUIT PUT
ON. IT WAS TOO BIG. MY MOM WOULD WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT, LOOK DOWN THE HALL
WAY AT THE TV. IT WAS FUZZY AND SHE COULD HEAR GRANDDAD LAUGHING. WHEN
SHE WOKE DAD THERE WAS NOTHING. THEN MY MOM'S SISTER STAYED THE NIGHT.
THEY BOTH WOKE TO HEAR SOMEONE LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS. THEY COUNTED AS
EACH DOOR WAS OPENED. WHEN THEY GOT UP THE NEXT DAY THEY HEARD 12 THE NIGHT
BEFORE, THEY COUNTED THE CUPBOARDS AND THERE WERE 12. MY MOM WOULD HAVE
DREAMS, WHERE SOMEONE WOULD BE REACHING OUT OF THE WALL TRYING TO GRAB
HER. ANOTHER DREAM SHE HAD WAS GRANDDAD WAS IN THE ATTIC SLEEPING ON A
COT. THE NEXT DAY MOM SENT DAD TO THE ATTIC AND THERE WAS A COT. MOM MADE
DAD GET RID OF IT. MOM SAYS THAT I WOULD GO INTO THE BATHROOM AND TALK
TO MY GRANDDAD ALL THE TIME. I SHOULD TELL YOU WE WERE ALL LIVING IN GRANDDAD'S
HOUSE AND MY FAMILY WAS AND STILL IS CLOSE. ONE NIGHT MY DAD WAS IN THE
GARAGE FIXING HIS CAR AND HAVING A BEER, WHEN HE LOOKED UP AND SAW HIS
DAD ROCKING IN HIS CHAIR IN THE ATTIC OF THE GARAGE. MY DAD NEVER HAD ANOTHER
DRINK SINCE THIS HAPPENED. THEY MOVED FROM THE HOUSE AND NEVER HAD ANYTHING
ELSE HAPPEN, AND THEY HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME I WAS GOING LOONEY. THANK

<BR><B>Shannon's Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mohr@schallertel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was Saturday night and I was babysitting a little girl named shannon.Now
Shannon was an odd girl,she never had any friends and</B>
<BR><B>she often felt all alone in this world.</B>
<BR><B>One night it was about lets say 9:45 I had to put shannon to bed.she
told me that she could tuck herself into bed,so I said "ok."and I sat back
down to watch TV.About 10 minutes later I decided to check on her and see
if she was okay. I walked into her room and I felt like I was fainting,then
I hit the floor. A few minutes later I got up and Shannon was sitting up
in her bed crying,so I walked up to</B>
<BR><B>her and she said "look what you did! You scared her away and now
she is never coming back!" I looked startled. Then Shannon collapes in
her bed and fell asleep again. I walked slowly back into the living room
and sat on the couch.I was about asleep when I felt I wasn't alone in the
room. I was going to get a drink of some water in the bathroom because
I was afraid to walk all the way into the kitchen. I had just remembered
I had to go into the kitchen to get a glass.It was very cold in the kitchen
I was putting my hand in the cupboard to pull out a glass when Shannon
walked into the kitchen and scared the hell out of me. I immediatly asked,"What
are you doing up this late it is 11:00!" Then she said"I just wanted to
tell you that shes back and she wants to kill you!" "Whos back?,and why
does she want to kill me!" But she didn't say anything she just walked
back into her room. I was so scared I couldn't barely breathe,so I stammered
into the cold bathroom to get the glass of water that I wanted.I looked
in the mirror to see my startled pale face when right behind my face was
the face of a girl,well I couldn't see her face that well it was sort of
blurred out by something&nbsp; I thought it was Shannon with a stupid rubber
mask on,but I was wrong when I turned around she wasn't there! I turned
back around to get another glass of water then I saw the face accept the
face wasnt blurred out. It was pale and there were scratches all over it,her
hair was ratty and looked like it hadn't been combed in centuries.I ran
out of the room to out side where I thought I could escape what ever was
after me! There was a great big forest in Shannons back yard,I ran for
it that the only place I could go! I was right outside the forest when
I saw the ghost girl in the forest wandering around amlessly calling for
someone and then I saw her go into a tiny it looked like a century old
house.Then Shannon's mother came home and asked how Shannon was doing and
I said she fell asleep about two hours ago.Then her mom sent me home with
a check of $2.59.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Knocking</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ranae4u@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This is a story that I always liked hearing my parents talk about.
My mother</B>
<BR><B>was pregnant with me and it was about the year of 1966. They lived
in this</B>
<BR><B>house on Old Route 66 in Oklahoma. At the time my uncle was living
with my</B>
<BR><B>folks, and every night usually around the same time there was this
knocking</B>
<BR><B>sound that started from my uncles bedroom closet. There were times
he could</B>
<BR><B>actually feel whatever it was walking over his feet, and then it
would move</B>
<BR><B>on to another room, and then there were times where it would start
from his</B>
<BR><B>closet and it would go straight out his bedroom window. The weird
thing was,</B>
<BR><B>was when it knocked on the window it was like the sound of someone
knocking</B>
<BR><B>on a window, and then when it would walk across the floor you could
tell the</B>
<BR><B>difference in the floor than the sound of the window, so they knew
it was</B>
<BR><B>definitely something. There were some that thought my folks had
totally lost</B>
<BR><B>there mind, so they decided one night that they were going to stay
over to</B>
<BR><B>see if they could hear it for themselves. For some strange reason
the</B>
<BR><B>knocking sound did not start at the usual time it usually did and
people</B>
<BR><B>were getting tired so they all decided to start packing up and going
on</B>
<BR><B>home, about the time they were leaving the knocking sound started.
My dad</B>
<BR><B>said there was this one guy that got down and followed it when it
started</B>
<BR><B>and knew that it definitely something but he wasn't going to stick
around to</B>
<BR><B>see what it was. He said he was going home.</B>
<BR><B>My folks got so use to it that it got at times where it didn't bother
them,</B>
<BR><B>but it got to where it would do it in the day while my mother was
home by</B>
<BR><B>herself. One night it started so my Dad being the Christian man
he is</B>
<BR><B>decided he wanted to ask it a question. He waited until the knocking
sound</B>
<BR><B>started and he said for the love of the Lord, "What do you want?"
My father</B>
<BR><B>said when he said this it was like the knocking sound stopped right
in its</B>
<BR><B>tracks and made a scooting sound like it turned around and looked
at him.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say may father didn't ask it anything else.</B>
<BR><B>A few months later my folks moved from the place and not long after
they</B>
<BR><B>moved the place burnt to the ground. They found out later that there
had</B>
<BR><B>been a bar there at one time and a man with a peg leg had been killed
and</B>
<BR><B>thrown in the well behind the house. There have been people known
to live on</B>
<BR><B>the property since my folks that have had the same strange things
happen to</B>
<BR><B>them too. I hope you find this as interesting as i did.</B>
