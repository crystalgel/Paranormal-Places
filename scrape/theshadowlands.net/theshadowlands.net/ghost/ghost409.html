<hr width="100%">My Sisters Story<br>
<br>
By: ritamknoll@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I was messing around on the internet and came across your
website.&nbsp; After reading some of the stories of other peoples
happenings I sent an email sharing my story to Tina.&nbsp; I have
another story I would like to share with you.&nbsp; This is actually my
sisters story.&nbsp; She is a 42 year old single mom and lives on a VFW
campus as part of a program for single mothers whose husbands had
served in a foreign war.&nbsp; Anyway, the house she was living in was
built in the 1920's and was completely empty when she moved in.&nbsp;
She did a complete walk through with one of the workers to make sure
nothing was wrong with the house and to see if anything needed repaired
that was broken before she moved in.&nbsp; About 3-4 months ago she
started noticing a rancid smell in her basement that she described as
rotten eggs and it got increasingly worse each day.&nbsp; She had the
maintenance crew come in to check it out and they couldn't find
anything wrong.&nbsp; About a week after that it got worse again so the
same maintenance guy came in again and in the basement in a room that
my sister never used they found playdough all over the floor, old metal
hot wheels cars and one childs boot - none of these things were dusty
and were not there when she moved in.&nbsp; Due to some health issues
she has since moved into a different house on campus.<br>

My Visitor<br>
<br>
By: Lauracoite@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello my name is Laura. I'm 25 years old
and I have 3 small children. I have a lot of stories, but I will relay
the ones that have affected me the most. The first story happened when
I was 16. I was eating at a restaurant with some friends of mine and I
started choking on some food. While I probably was only doing so for
less than a minute it seemed like much longer. Someone preformed the
Heimlich and dislodged the food, I started violently coughing and my
friend grabbed my hand and dragged me into the bathroom were I started
vomiting into the sink. Now here's were it gets strange. I remember
leaning over the sink and a woman asking my friend if I was ok. She
told the woman that I had been choking and I heard the woman say "poor
baby" she wet a paper towel and placed it on the back of my neck. I
looked up into the mirror and A very tall black woman was smiling at me
she had glasses on the style that was popular in the 80's and her hair
was in an up do. I smiled back at her and then she left. I went home
and tried to forget the incident. Well the next day when I was
discussing the kind stranger with my friend we came to the subject of
her appearance. When I described her my friend was looking at me like I
was insane. She then informed me that the woman was a small Hispanic
lady with long hair pulled back. She also told me that no one else was
in the bathroom and after the woman left no one came in. Well I have no
idea who she was but I know what I saw. The other one happened with the
same friend. She was driving me&nbsp; home late one night and I was
dozing a little in the passenger side. We were coming to this dark
little three way when her headlights caught two people walking across
the street. One was a woman, she had dark hair and was wearing a light
green coat. The other was a man walking behind her. He was blonde and
wearing a black hat with a bulky black coat. They got to the other side
of the street just before we passed them, and When I looked over There
was only the woman. "what happened to the guy" I asked. And again the
funny look from my friend. What guy she asks. The guy that was walking
behind the woman. Well I made her turn around and we asked her if there
was a man walking behind her and she said no one was on the street but
her and us when we drove by. At this point I feel really over whelmed
with grief and I feel so lost and I can't just leave until I tell her
what I saw. So I describe the man that I saw walking and the woman
first got angry and me and said I was just trying to play a joke on
her. But we assured her that we had happened to see her walking on our
way home.&nbsp; She broke down and told us that her brother had been
killed in a car crash and had died&nbsp; the day before he was supposed
to see her for the first time in 3 years. That that was what he was
wearing when he died. He was following her. I could feel his grief at
not being able to tell her that he was there. It was so sad yet so
touching that he was there and that she didn't know that. But again saw
him. And after&nbsp; a few years of this my friend just sort of got
used to it. Well one more thing. Since I've had kids I haven't seen any
thing of the other side. I don't know if its because I'm afraid now or
if it just went away but its been awhile. Thank you so much for taking
the time to read this. I think its great that you have this site that's
serous about letting people tell their stories with out the fear and
ridicule that some who don't understand like to say of others. <br>

"The House on Milton Street, Part 2."<br>
<br>
By: suntime22@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
About three years ago, I sent in a story about how I went to stay at my
relatives haunted house for the holidays. Shortly after I left to come
home a lot more scary things happened. For three years I've been saying
to myself<br>
"Yeah, I'll tell my story again soon..." or "I'll do it next week!" So after<br>
two years of pushing it back I've parked my self infront of the
computer with a cup of coffee and I'm ready to tell more ghostly
stories! To recap on<br>
my other story, my two older cousins and their parents had been living
in their house for about 6 years without anything ever happening. After
they re-renovated, strange but non-threatening activity started up.<br>
After I left my relatives house having a few of my own experiences, I
gave my cousin a call and asked her if there had been any creepy
experiences since I left. What she told me sent shivers down my spine.
I will not use her real name but we will call her Jessica. Keep in mind
that during this time both her parents were in Australia, although her
younger brother was home with her. Jess told me that one night, she got
into bed, turned out the<br>
light, and went to sleep. She had the strangest dream she was in a very
old building, like a school. She was walking up an old stairway with a
friend of<br>
hers. Her friend said "Okay, this is the scary part." Once they reached
the top of the staircase their was a glass door. Beyond that glass door
was a dark figure moving. My cousin awoke to hear something very
strange in her room. Her blankets were on the floor. Either she had
kicked them off of they<br>
had been pulled off. Anyway, she could hear the sound of footsteps in
the darkness around her bed. It was like they were looking for
something. It scared the Hell out of her. She said to herself "Okay,
shut your eyes as tight as you can, count to three, bend down pick up
your blankets and throw them over you." So when she reached three, with
her eyes shut tightly she threw he blankets over her and started
counting. She counted for so long the<br>
sun began to come up. When her room was light enough she got up and ran
out of the room. When her parents arrived home a few days later she
told her mum<br>
her story and also said she was never going to sleep in that room again
and made her parents swap rooms with her. She told me the energy in the
room felt completely different after she changed rooms. I had the dream
analysed by a dream interpreter and they said the dream was a
premonition of what would happen when she woke up. I got hold of her
again a few weeks later and<br>
asked if anything else strange had happened. She told me that she was on the<br>
phone talking to her friend, then once the conversation had ended to
stuck the phone in the pocket of her jacket and started talking to her
mother. Her<br>
mother asked her for the phone so Jess reached into her pockets only to find<br>
that...it wasn't there...They searched all over the house and found it
on her parents bed. Extremely strange how the phone somehow ended up
there when<br>
my cousin never went anywhere near there and it somehow 'teleported'
out of her pocket. This next experience of hers is the last. One night
she had a very strange dream. She dreamt she was in her bedroom when
the ghost of a little girl walked into her room. The girl had some
strange abnormality about her head. Ever a birth defect or a really bad
burn. When my cousin looked into her eyes, the defect went away and she
was a normal pretty looking girl. My cousin took her into a room and
the little girl was crying,<br>
telling Jess she couldn't pass on. Jess told her everything was going
to be okay and to go towards the light. My cousin Jess awoke the next
morning thinking "Wow! What a strange dream..."<br>
From then on, nothing ever happened in the house again. I found this
odd because I know I saw the black shadow of a man in the middle of the
hallway.<br>
Perhaps when the little girl passed on she took this man with her? Or
maybe the man was a spirit that returned to the house every now and
then to help the little girl pass over but was unsuccessful in his
attempts? About two months after my cousins dream they moved houses.
Remember this all took place about three years ago. The forces we not
remotely harmful, but kind spirits. The house has new owners and I've
always wondered in they have experienced anything paranormal. I doubt
it because it seems the little girl<br>
has crossed over. We couldn't dig up any past information on the house.<br>
There was really no point because the previous owners built the house and no<br>
one ever died in it!<br>
I would now like to tell you about a haunted theatre here in my home town of<br>
Wellington, New Zealand. This theatre is called 'The St. James' and is
occupied by two ghosts, one friendly ghost called Yuri, the other
called 'The Wailing Woman' or 'Woman in Red' who is a some-what nasty
entity. A psychic entered the theatre during the 70s' and revealed that
Yuri was pushed to his death from the cat walk. Yuri has saved the life
of a<br>
few people who have worked there. A woman holding her baby was pushed out of<br>
the way of a falling beam that would have killed them both. Someone who
works there was up on the cat walk when the lights in the theatre went
out.<br>
(not something supernatural but something that commonly happened there)
He was surrounded in darkness and tried walking fowards. He felt a very
cold hand pushing his chest. The lights in the theatre went back on and
in front of this man was a 30 foot drop which would have killed him if
this force hadn't have stopped him. The Wailing Woman in the ghost of
an actress who performed in the theatre during the 40s' and tried to
make a comeback.<br>
Unfortunately, she was booed off stage. She was so upset that she went
back to her dressing room and committed suicide by cutting her wrists.
People working at the theatre claim to hear a woman crying in a
dressing room aswell as screaming and somebody flooding the basement.
Police dogs will not<br>
venture into some parts of the theatre and strange accidents have
happened to actors or singers performing. Everytime I walk past this
theatre I'm desperate to sneak in and have a look around. It is not
abandoned and still houses many plays to this day, and the ghosts still
wander the halls.<br>
I hope you have enjoyed my stories, they have all been 100% true. The
paranormal has interested me greatly and I 100% believe in ghosts. One
day I<br>
hope to be a paranormal investigater.<br>
P.S: I apologise if there are any spelling mistakes in my story!<br>

Ghosts can Touch You<br>
<br>
By: ammaroq88@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Some people say ghosts can't touch people, and if they do they'll pass
right through you. I'm not so sure thats true. When i was little i had
trouble sleeping when i was sent to bed so i would do numerous things
to entertain myself. ( i don't remember this expreince much but i do
rember this) I was sitting on the top bunk of my bunk bed faceing the
wall, i was kneeling not doing anything really when i feel somone grab
me under the arms. it tryed to lift me and half suceeded until i
wriggled away and jumped out of bed. <br>
barely catching a glimpse of a black shadow dispearing into the opposit
wall. I sat in the hallway terrifed out of my mind becuae this was one
of my first exprences ( i had many more afterwards) my mother said she
found me in the hallways and i told her somone had tryed to lift me out
of bed. She said it wasen't her becuase she was asleep until she heard
me crying. it coudlen't have been my father becuase he was at work at
the time. and my brother was still to short to reach the top bun, let
alone pick somone out of it. From then on when i was up late sometimes
i would see the shadow of a man materialize in this spot on my wall. He
always appear in the same spot. <br>
always. once i saw him sitting in the chair in my room. sometimes he
would appear and take a few steps around the room and be gone. after a
while i learnd not to be afraid of the man. after all he never tryed to
harm me. and the way he attempted picked me up was malichouse he was
simply trying to lift me up. I acutlly called him chicken-coop man for
a while becuase my father had told me there used to be a chicken coop
on the property and a man lived in it. So i just called him chicken
coop man. We'v since moved out of that house, and i kind of miss
chicken coop man. yea he would scare me when i wasen't expecting him
but i had grown accustom to his pressance.<br>

A Story For You<br>
<br>
By: mrsdavis_3@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I've got a story for you...&nbsp; When I was less than 6 months old my
parents rented a house in Bonne Terre, MO....&nbsp; My mother at the
time had a Yorkie whom wouldn't even enter the house.&nbsp; The dog was
a very loving dog but when forced into the house would go crazy and run
out the door to my grandparents house that was one Jackson St.&nbsp;
Just a few blocks away.&nbsp; Things got so bad in the house that my
mother refused to live in it any longer..&nbsp; She said that every
time she would go down the stairs there was a presence of a woman that
would walk down them behind you in a hurry. People still talk about how
it sounded like someone wearing high heels was walking quickly up and
down the stairs.&nbsp; When they would place a pacifier down it would
vanish only to be found after we moved in a taped shut box that had
been tapped before we moved into this house.&nbsp; They found over 8
pacifiers in that box.&nbsp; My grandmother asked my mother who the
woman was staying with us , that she had seen her in the up stairs
window, only to be told that there was no one else in the house but her
and I.&nbsp; When my mom was finally at her wits end she went to a
priest whom told her a story about the house that scared her to this
day...&nbsp; A few years before a couple had split up , the woman in a
desperate move over dosed herself and called husband/ boyfriend as a
attempted for him to save her.&nbsp; He got held up in meetings and
never got the message.&nbsp; She was found dead in the bath
tub...&nbsp; My mother found a friend of the woman in the area and she
told her that the woman hated the ST. Francis county and never wanted
to be there in the first place..&nbsp; Her mother had her buried there
against her daughters wishes.&nbsp; I have been told only from asking
that I never slept in that house my mother told me that I was up and
crying constantly and when they would go to visit someone I'd sleep
like I hadn't slept in months..&nbsp; As a young child being taht my
grandparents lived only a few blocks from the house we would walk and
drive by it and I would talk about the pretty thin dark headed lady in
the window, no one else knew what I was talking about. My grandparents
said that my mother hardly slept &amp; was constintlely complaning
about the fact taht my nursery door wouldn't remain open it would slma
as soon as she turned her back to go out into the hallway of the second
floor.&nbsp; Still to this day if you ask my dad about it he refuses to
talk, my mother told me that even after they moved out he had horrific
and odd dreams that all seemed to take place in that house.&nbsp; The
house still stands I'm not sure if it is vacant, but two years ago when
driving by my 3 year old asked who the woman in the window
was......&nbsp; I'm in my late 20's now &amp; my parents still refuse
to talk about what all happened in hat house.&nbsp; The preist that
told my mother the story also asked her before she told him her address
if she lived in the house that is actually on the same block just down
the rode,&nbsp; he told her he had heard horrible stories about
it.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

True Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: winchock@eden.rutgers.edu<br>
<br>
First off, I really love your site.&nbsp; I spend much a late night
reading up on ghost stories [and then have a hard time falling asleep
:P].<br>
But here's my story:<br>
For the first 16 years of my life, I lived in the house my grandfather
built in a small town in Central Jersey.&nbsp; Before my grandpa built
the house, there had only been a barn in the back of the property and
one other house on the street [owned by one of my grandpa's
sister-in-laws].&nbsp; By the time I was born, the barn was gone and
all that was left was a rather large fireplace in the backyard.&nbsp; I
really always hated playing in the backyard, mostly because I always
felt someone was watching me.&nbsp; And never, never would I play near
that fireplace, mostly because it always freaked me out.<br>
The thing that really set me off about the house was when I was around
6 and I was sleeping in my mom's bed [I always did this].&nbsp; I woke
up in the middle of the night, which was not abnormal for me, but what
I saw then was abnormal.&nbsp; There was a man standing in the doorway,
staring at me.&nbsp; He was wearing overalls with a white collared
t-shirt underneath them, with a hat but I don't really remember what it
looked like.&nbsp; He just kept staring at me, so I finally asked him
who he was.&nbsp; Instead of answering my question, he simply told me
to get out in a low, scratchy voice.&nbsp; Being a little kid, I
immediately lay back down and pulled the blanket over my head, waiting
a few minutes, and then woke my mom.&nbsp; By that time, he was
gone.&nbsp; Years later, I brought it up to my mom, asking her if she
really thought I just had a bad dream, which had been her explanation
at the time.&nbsp; She became slightly anxious and then finally told me
she was sure I had seen a ghost because of one of her own
experiences.&nbsp; Apparently, many nights she felt like some one would
slip into bed with her.&nbsp; She would just think it was me, but when
she turned over to ask me if I was okay, she would find no one
there.&nbsp; Eventually, she stopped sleeping in her room, and it
stopped.<br>
We moved when I was 16.&nbsp; My mom taught at the town's high school,
and eventually we discovered that the reason why our house was for sale
when it was was because the previous owner's daughter had died in the
house.&nbsp; And the place she died?&nbsp; Well, my bedroom, of
course!&nbsp; The girl had just went to sleep one night and never woke
up.&nbsp; Every morning, I would wake up and go down into the basement
to go on the computer, and I would find the TV on.&nbsp; I thought
maybe my mom had left it on, but every time it would be on the Spanish
Language channel.&nbsp; Now, mom and I aren't Spanish, nor do we know
it, so there would be no point to us watching it.&nbsp; I decided to do
some digging, asking some people in the high school who knew the girl
who had died, and apparently she had taken every level of Spanish
available in the high school and had planned to go to college so she
could teach Spanish.&nbsp; Lets just say I was a little scared.&nbsp;
The next morning, I went down and the TV was on again, and I politely
said that if she wanted attention, this was not the way to do it, and
that I would just prefer her to leave me alone.&nbsp; After that,
nothing again.<br>
Thanks for listening to my ramblings.&nbsp; It just feels good to actually tell someone.<br>

Queen Mary<br>
<br>
By: maxferry@oregoncoast.com<br>
<br>
Back in the mid eighties I was living in Los Angeles, and a friend of
mine from the Bay Area came into town on business. His firm had secured
lodgings for him aboard the Queen Mary and my friend contacted me and
suggested that we meet there for dinner and drinks. I wish to point out
that, at that time, neither of us had ever heard any of the stories of
the haunting aboard the Queen Mary<br>
We had a nice dinner at the Capstan Room, and a couple of cocktails in
the Art Deco lounge, and decided to go exploring on the ship. Two
inexplicable incidents occurred while we were poking around the old
ship.<br>
The first occurred when we went on the engine room tour, which
basically is just a trip with a tour guide down a ramp and onto a
platform above a portion of the engine room, and shows very little of
the actual extent of the area. We were in the back of a large group of
people and noticed an unlocked gateway off to one side with a sign that
said "no admittance". We looked at each other and nodded, and slipped
through the gate and ducked out of sight around a corner. The engine
room is a cavernous place, something that you might not realize if you
just took the tour, and we were both eager to explore the whole thing,
since we share an interest and fascination with nautical artifacts. We
had been exploring for some time, climbing catwalks and ladders up,
down, across and all around the area known as "shaft alley", where the
main propeller shaft passes through the engine room. Suddenly, we both
looked across the 'alley' and saw a man standing there on a catwalk,
perhaps 40 feet away. He appeared to be in his early twenties, wearing
brown trousers and a jacket. We thought maybe someone else had sneaked
away from the group, and we just sort of smiled and waved, saying "hi
how are you..." or something to that effect. The man did not react at
all, just stood there with his hand holding a railing above him and
staring at us. My friend and I looked at each other, thinking "what's
this guy's deal?" When we looked back, the man was gone. There is no
way he could have moved off or concealed himself without us seeing what
he was doing...he simply was not there any longer. My friend and I left
the area hastily, and didn't comment on it until we were well clear of
the engine room.<br>
The second incident occurred perhaps an hour later, in another unused
and perhaps off-limits part of the ship, this time in a hallway that
runs behind what appeared to be a theater stage. The stage itself
appeared to be under restoration, although there were no workmen
present at this time, being a Saturday evening. While looking around
this stage we noticed a hatchway off to one side and decided to see
where it led. The hallway we entered was very dimly lit and completely
covered in a thick layer of undisturbed dust. We followed this hallway
for perhaps 30 to 40 yards, until we came upon a newspaper laying in
the middle of the hall under the dust. I picked this newspaper up and
swept away the dust, finding a date on it that was prior to WWII. My
friend and I were preoccupied with looking at this paper when it
suddenly became icy cold and our breath was visible in the dim light.
We turned around to look back the way we had come. Looking down we saw
the tracks that we had each left in the dust, and a third set of tracks
in the dust between them. The tracks were darker and a smaller size
than the ones we had left, and ended right behind the place we had
stopped. I stooped down to touch one of the tracks and realized that
these tracks were wet, and they had been made by bare feet of a child
no more than 10 or 12 years of age. They did not return back down the
hallway...they simply ended right there. Needless to say, my friend and
I once again beat a hasty retreat and did no further exploring that
night aboard the Queen Mary.<br>
I swear that this is a true account.<br>

You guys have a Great web-site.&nbsp; I only have one book on the
ghosts of Lincoln, Ne.&nbsp; I want to buy more of the other ones, well
anyway...... The house that my Mom and Step-Dad had in Red Cloud was
definitely haunted. <br>
They told me it was...guess I just thought they were bull-shitting me.&nbsp; <br>
I had moved back to this state, and had to stay with them for a little
while.&nbsp; I got up one morning and they were already at work, so I
was there alone.&nbsp; I was sitting at the dining room table, across
from the table are stairs that go upstairs, and an opening to the front
room.&nbsp; The door was open to the stairs, and someone was walking
either up or down them, they were hitting each step, but no one was
there but me.&nbsp; I was at the store in about 30 seconds flat,
freaking out, asking "What the hell was going on in their house?"&nbsp;
Needless to say they thought it was funny, and preceded to tell me
about the 2 old spinster sisters that use to live<br>
in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; There would be times I would be visiting them, and we<br>
would all be in the front room, and you could hear someone walking
across the floor upstairs.&nbsp; That was pretty common, you just get
use to it. <br>
That wasn't my first encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do Believe in ghosts, I've never had<br>
to deal with a mean one though.<br>

A Story of A Visited Scout<br>
<br>
By: NealBrwr@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I am a Scout in my Scout Troop. The short account of paranormal
activity that I am about to tell you took place after the planning of
my Pinewood Derby Racecar. (The Pinewood Derby is an annual race held
by BSA. It involves cutting a miniature scale car and racing it against
others.) <br>
My Father and I had been working on it together, and he told me of a
design that he and his Father had used when he was a Scout. I decided
to go with that, in honor of my late Grandfather, who had helped design
my Father's car.<br>
When I got home from planning my car at the Scout meeting, I got on my
computer. After an hour or so, I feel a sharp tap on my uniform (I
hadn't changed my into my nightclothes yet). It wasn't in the least bit
painful, just a strong tap. I looked to my left (where the tap had
been), and I saw nothing. I just felt a prescence. A good one, in a
way. The tap was on my Troop Number.<br>
I think this was my Grandfather telling me that he's proud of me. He died before I ever got to meet him.<br>

Ever since I was a little chiled I have had strange things happen to
me. From pulling people into my dreams to save me from death to having
ghost follow me were ever i go. I guess you can call me a expert in the
supernatural. There is not a day in my life that something weard dose
not happen to me. I am use to it now and i am no longer scared of the
things that happen. In fact I help people with the ghost that are evil
or just plain scaring the pants off of others. So i am going to tell
you guys some of the things that has happend to me. <br>
When i was 14 years old my mother put me in faster care. I moved from
one home to another. At the age of 16 I moved into yet another faster
home. It was a big house that i like and at the time my faster mother
was the kind person. Everything was fine for about a week or two then
it started yet again. Late at night I could hear people walking in the
hall out side my bedroom door. Kids playing and having fun. At first I
thought it was my faster moms kids playing. That is untill they spent
the weekend with their father. No young kids were in the house but yet
I was awaken to children playing in the hall. Being use to this kind of
thing i went back to sleep.<br>
Two days later we got a new girl. One Saterday afternoon we were both
in the living room. let me tell u the was it looks so that u can get an
idea of what happend. There is another room behind the living room that
i like to call the reading room. The reading room had wood doors that
pulled shut. About halfway into the door way the chouch was. There was
still room to walk into the reading room and the doors were opend. I
was reading a book that i could not get my nose out of when i heard a
rocking chair rocking back and forth. There was no rocking chair in the
reading room. My faster sister and I turned of course we saw nothing,
but when we turned the rocking got louder and faster. I then got off
the couch and went to see if someting eals in the reading room was
making the noise. I could see nothing. I decied to go in the reading
room and just as i set my foot on the&nbsp; the floor the rocking
stoped. She screamed wich made me scream. My faster mom ran in ask
asked us what was going on&nbsp; we told her. She said that that was
weared nothing had happend in the house for over 10 years. <br>
My next story is when i had a friend over for the night we were going
on a chmping trip the next morning and had to get up early. We slept in
the same bed. In the middle of the night I felt a hand on my arm I
asked her what was wrong. She shook me I then rolled over to see what
was wrong. As soon as I rolled over I saw a dark man with red glowing
eyes that was glearing at us. I told her stay still and not move untill
it went away. We stayed like that for about 10 mimunts before he left. <br>
That was not the only time that I have seen the dark man. I am now 19
years old living with my boyfriend of 2 years. The dark man has
followed me along with others that have chose to be near me. It has
gotten to the point that he is so use to it that when someting happens
he acts like its apart of life. Our friends have seen some of the
things that happen to us, and ask how can we live like this. Jordands

My Haunted House in Barnegat<br>
<br>
<br>

Dear Shadowlands, I live in an old house in Barnegat, NJ. At one time
my home stood next to the railroad station.It served the town as a
general store, a pharmacy and finally a bank before it was moved to its
present location. After moving in, small things would disappear only to
return in the exact spot they went missing, plates would fall from the
wall in one specific spot while the ones surrounding them would remain
intact and a tall, dark presence could be detected in the upper hall. I
always thought these phenomena were attributable to a sea captain who
lived in the house. After contacting the local historical society I
learned that a pharmacist, Mr Dilks, committed suicide in my home.
Although there had been no recent activity, that very night a small
child's desk in the living room tipped itself over. I was in the room
alone at the time. I must have had some type of forewarning because
just before it happened I gave a yell that sent my son running from his
bedroom just in time to be a witness. We have never been afraid, no
malice has ever been intended. We simply feel sorry for this poor, sad
soul. There are many haunted houses in Barnegat. At our last town yard
sale we walked around asking the neighbors, "So, who is your ghost?" We
heard many stories! <br>

I purchased a house Tx. in 1999 and lived there until 2003. Being new
to the area, I knew no-one. After answering a knock on my door 3 times
with nobody there, I thought the kids were playing a game. The next
day, I went to city hall, since the town was only 6 blocks by 6 blocks,
it was in view and asked the town clerk, Mary and the water dept
manager, Luis Contreras, if messing with new folk would end soon.<br>
After telling them what happened, Luis said "We thought the retired
border patrol officer you bought the place from was nuts! He would come
to city hall, peek out the windows and swear he was going to catch
those kids and prosecute them." Turns out that he was getting knocking
on the floors, walls, windows and doors, and nobody could be seen.<br>
This caused him to build a 6' high wood fence around the place that a
jackrabbit could not get through. He also hand piled river rocks around
the entire foundation so they could not get under the house. Neighbors
were thinking he was crazy. it finally drove him to sell to an
unsuspecting out-of-towner, me. <br>
I was told that Maggie, her husband and her run the local citco
station, lived in the house as a girl and her mother owned the place
till she passed. Maggie smiled when I asked her about the place and
said "Mom would always call us over because somebody was trying to get
in the house" <br>
This is a small 2 bedroom old house on a corner lot next to a church on
1 side and the Catechism teaching bldg on the other. I have had someone
sit on the bed next to me, and when my cousin came to visit, I was told
about the rude neighbors that were knocking on the window all night. My
questions to my cousins Debra and Freddy Rodriquez were: was the fence
locked because of the pit bulls they traveled with were in the yard all
night and did you hear them bark? They looked at each other and after I
told them the place was haunted, they left and would not come back.<br>
I went on the internet to the Yahoo chat rooms involving Ghosts,
hauntings...etc. The room I selected had a warning not to ask for a
reading. If the people in the room got anything, they would let you
know. I sat and waited.....Two-Kettles said she was a tribal shaman in
Kansas and after describing my house with the oversized fence, piled
rocks and the religious bladings on each side, had my attention. Here
is what she said: I see 3 spirits there, an elderly Hispanic male
wearing a pin-striped suit, a young girl, about 5 years old and a cat.
I am a retired corrections officer from a federal prison, so alternate
realities have been fairly foreign to me. She was laughing and said
they liked me because I was ok with them being there and I did the
dishes! She also said they had so much fun with the old man that was
there before me and what he did to try and stop them. <br>
All I have said can be backed up by the townsfolk, Maggie and Victor
still run the station and live local as does Luis Contreras, whose wife
Brenda manages the office at Balmorhea State Park, run by Friend Tom
Johnson. If the town stories interest you, there is a legend I was told
of involving the big hill just north of town with the cross on it.
Seems local women were seen there 1 night dancing with a creature with
cloven hooves. The large shrine is located across the road where this
supposedly happened and can be viewed on the internet.<br>
Love the site and thank you for the place to put this out to. <br>

Ghost Experience at River Ridge Castle<br>
<br>
<br>
By: xmandariin@gmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I read stories on here alot, but I didn't expect to be posting one!
I've been interested in the supernatural for a long time, but never had
any experiences.<br>
Last weekend ( 01.12 - 01.14) I stayed up at the River Ridge Castle in
Franklin, PA on a retreat with my youth group. The castle is very big,
old and full of history. There's just hallway upon hallway, door after
door, staircase after staircase, it's like a big maze. I finally
figured out how to get to my room without help on the last day.
=D&nbsp; <br>
Anyway, there are actually two towers there, but you can only get into
one of them--the other one is closed off. A few friends of mine and I
decided to go up there, it was really cold. I mean, it really wasn't
that cold outside, but it was freezing in the tower and there was lots
of condensation on the walls. So we were in there being hyper and
taking random pictures. We took a particularly funny one and all
gathered around the camera to look at it when I calmly pointed out that
there was an orb in the picture. I guess my friends weren't as cool
with that as I was, 'cause they freaked out and bolted out of there. I
followed them, and we ran and told my friend *S,* who informed us she's
sensitive to the supernatural and wanted to come check it out. We went
back up, all of my friends were huddled on the steps while my friend
*C* and I watched *S.* She told us to be quiet, and after a moment's
deliberation she told us that there was definitely something up there.
So we sprinted out and went back to my friends' rooms. We zoomed in and
examined the pictures more closely, the orb was very big and had a
shape which resembled a swan inside. There was also a smaller orb near
the floor we hadn't noticed. <br>
I thought it was exciting the castle was haunted, my friends: not so much. <br>
Later that night I was with some of my other friends, *K* and *E* in my
room, we were staying up late and talking. We were the only group in
the whole castle still awake, you see all the other groups were
sleeping in the same room as their leaders, but my group was divided up
into smaller rooms and my leaders were at the end of the hall. We took
advantage of that. ;] But we kept hearing loud thuds and people walking
around. It was rather creepy. I also saw odd lights on the main floor
(no one was sleeping there--girls slept on the second floor, guys slept
in the basement "dungeon.") <br>
The next day, I noticed that in the larger bathroom in our hall,
whenever I went past quickly I saw a whitish figure in there out of the
corner of my eye. Every time. Needless to say, I always went past it
quickly. =] <br>
The only other significant thing that happened was when we left. We had
cleared out our stuff from the room, and everyone was downstairs
getting loaded into buses/vans. I ran upstairs to get my blanket and
camera which I had almost forgotten, and I glanced around the empty
room and said "Goodbye." As I closed the door, I heard the muffled
sound of a girl crying. <br>
After I got home, I looked up the castle on Google and found out that
Joseph Sibley, it's original owner, had died there. You can find an
article in Wikipedia&nbsp; on him. My friend *S* later said she dug up
more information and found out his daughter, Celia, died there too, and
there was a fire there sometime in the last century. The castle now
belongs to Life Ministries and is used for retreats and such.&nbsp; <br>
One last thing--all the pictures I've seen of the place have an
seemingly supernatural anomaly somewhere in them. Even in the postcards
the castle sells there's an odd face--in the window of the closed off
tower! <br>
Anyway, all in all, it was a great weekend. =]<br>

Grandfather<br>
<br>
By: stepup.stepout@gmail.com<br>
<br>
well, my grandfather died about 7 months ago. But then, about 4 months
ao, my house started to have these eerie things going on. One, at night
and ONLY at night, NONE of the lights in the house would go off. Though
if we tried dimming the light it would work. Then, in the morning and
afternoon the lights would start working again. And my mom, she swears
to God, she heard my grandfather talking to her saying something in a
low muffled voice, but this was with no televisions on at the time.
Ever since that "encounter between my mom and my grandfather", we've
not had any other light troubles in the house. At first, I thought it
was just some malfunctions in the lights, but then I started to think a
bit more about the situation.<br>

My mother Peggy (a ghost story)<br>
<br>
By: harkness@mail.usachoice.net <br>
<br>
Hello, I would like to share with you a different kind of ghost
story.&nbsp; For years my mother suffered from a disease called
COPD.&nbsp; It is a lung disease caused by smoking.&nbsp; In
August&nbsp; 2005 she was admitted to ICU after complications from
bowel surgery and after she recovered she stayed in a rehabilitation
center until her death in October.&nbsp; She was hooked up to a
respirator so long that her lungs could not function without it and she
slowly lost the battle with her poor lungs.&nbsp; In September my
father was diagnosed with lung cancer but he chose not to tell my
mother until she was better as not to get her upset in her own
recovery.&nbsp; It was on my birthday that he was diagnosed.&nbsp;
After my mother died my father was devastated.&nbsp; He had just
started Chemotherapy the week before.&nbsp; Two days after her death my
father was sleeping in his recliner in the livingroom (it was the only
place he could sleep because of the pain of the cancer).&nbsp; He woke
about 2am to find my mother sitting in the recliner caticorner to him
and she was smiling.&nbsp; Then she slowly disappeared.&nbsp; Some
think my father was hallucinating, some think he actually saw
her.&nbsp; I believe he saw her because on the evening of her death I
felt her prescense (we were very close and shared some psychic stuff in
the past).<br>
Sadly my father passed away October 2006, almost exactly a year after
my mother.&nbsp; But I find comfort in knowing they are together again.<br>

Story about my Nephew <br>
<br>
By: shadow92854@yahoo.com]<br>
<br>
I have family members who have also had things happen to them. My story is true it happened to me.<br>
My brother was killed in a drinking and driving accident when he was
31, he left behind two sons, my nephews (7) and (5). They were like my
own kids. They stayed with me all the time I took them everywhere. The
youngest was 29 at the time and had three kids, 1 son and 2 daughters.
He was driving to the store with his 3 year old son in the car and had
a accident, he hit a tree the road was wet and he couldn't stop. His
son was killed, the doctors told me that he died instantly but my
nephew told me that his son spoke to him at the accident and ask him
was he going to be ok. The docotors said that he could not have spoke
but I believed my nephew. Three months later his brother was drinking
with their mother in the car, he had an accident and their mother was
killed.&nbsp; These accidents happened in 1996 and 2000 my nephew that
was driving when his son was killed, killed himself. He use to live me
with and he stayed with me a week before he died. Shortly after he died
I started having things happen in the apartment that I had lived in for
10 years. My water would turn on at the kitchen sick in the middle of
the night, my bedroom light would cut on. I woke up about 2 in the
moring and my candle was burning. My TV would cut on and off so I
decided to talk to my nephew who died and I ask him was this him in my
apartment. I told him to leave me a sign, to flash a smiley face on my
wall on somwhere for me to see. I took a cab to work every morning for
about 5 years and the next day after I ask for my smiley face I opened
the cab door and the first thing I saw was a smiley face on the floor
of the cab right by the door.&nbsp; I cried for days after that.&nbsp;
To this day nothing else has happened. <br>
One night in Kentucky my grandmother was talking about my Aunt who
passed away from giving birth to my cousin, my grandmother said that
she seen my Aunt all the time and would feel her get into bed with her.
That night I went to bed and my mom slept in the same room so she
finally got into bed and later we heard something fall so my mom got up
to see what it was because I was to scared, it was my aunts picture it
had fallen on the floor. The weird part of this is that the picture was
old and hanging on a nail and the nail was still there and the rope on
the picture frame was not broken. My mom always told me it was my aunt
letting us know she knew they were talking about her. My mother told me
that my Dad would not sleep without a gun by his bed because of the
things they heard.<br>
My family has so many stories they could write a book.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
