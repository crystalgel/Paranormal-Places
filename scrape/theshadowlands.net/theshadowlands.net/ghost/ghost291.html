<P><B>Happenings</B>

<P><B>By: fissure13@chilitech.net</B>

<P><B>First I think that I should give you a little bit of background information.
My mother and my father split up when I was two. So wanting another man
in her life, she found a new boyfriend. He wasn't what you would call a
nice person. He was very abusive... one night he stole a hundred dollars
from me and my mom decided that that was the last straw. She called the
police, and he was sent to jail.</B>
<BR><B>He always told us that there was a male ghost that followed him
around... but no one ever believed him. As time passed while he was in
jail, our belief in his ghost grew. I was now about eight years old and
I can remember these days like they were yesterday. Everyday, when my mom
and I got home, the cat scratcher, it was one of those really tall ones,
was in the middle of our dining room floor. This was eerie for several
reasons. The first being that our cat was not large enough to even move
the object, the second was that the cat hated the toy, and the third and
most important was that the cat scratcher was put at the bottom of our
stairway which was three rooms away!</B>
<BR><B>I was now afraid to go anywhere in the house by myself so where
ever my mom was... so was I.</B>
<BR><B>One night, my fourteen year old cousin decided to spend the night.
My mom didn't want to scare her so she didn't tell her anything about her
recent happenings. I left her have my room and I slept in the bed with
my mom. About ten minutes after she was in the room by herself , she ran
into the room that my mother and I were in screaming. She claimed that
she saw an old man playing with the chain that hung from the light. My
mom went in my room to see if anything was there. There was no man. But
the chain was still fiercly spinning.It then started to slow until it stopped.</B>
<BR><B>When we entered the house about a week later... the cat scratcher
wasn't in the dining room, but it also wasn't in the stairway. We proceeded
up the stairs. My mom was ahead of me, and I was quivering behind her.
As my mom flicked on the hallway light, she jumped. After&nbsp; I questioned
her about what it was, I noticed it without her answer. Greasy hand prints
slid across the top of our ten foot wall. For some strange reason my mom
followed them. To afraid to be left by myself... I followed her. My hearts
beat shook my entire body. We were now approaching her bed room. Sure enough
there was the cat cat scratcher next to it was an enormous hand print.
And when I say enormous I mean enormous. It appeared to be a foot in length.</B>
<BR><B>My mom tried to clean it up on countless occasions, but it never
lifted. Until her boyfriend was released from jail that is. He was immedeatly
kicked out and everything stopped happening. The next time my mom tried
to clean up the stain, it dissappeared and nothing happened again.</B>

<BR><B>Grandma Ruth</B>

<P><B>By: Ellabrinkley@msn.com</B>

<P><B>this ia about my grandma ruth that passed away in 2002. I loved her
so much. Things have been happening up intil this day ever since she passed.
The strange occurence that happened to me was that at the time I was living
in portsmouth,VA with my father. My grandma said that I can have her bed
when she passed, so now I have it.&nbsp; This happened on a sunday, Me
and my other grandma&nbsp; was going to church, but at the last minute
decided not to go. I went back in my room and layed down on grandma bed.
That's when I thought I heard someone call my name. I knew it sounded like
my grandma, but I dismissed it kind of. When I did'nt respond to her calling
me, I heard her call me again. That's when I looked up, and she was sitting
at the foot of my bed, dressed like she would always be, not how she was
at the funeral. Now, this part I don't understand why she said this to
me-- she asked me did I want her to fix me something to eat!&nbsp; I was
so startled I screamed and started to kick my feet like a child that was
having a tantrum. With me doing that, she just started to fade off&nbsp;
and disappear. A lot of things have happened to my mom, but she will have
to write up here for herself. Other things have happened to me. When I
was about ten years old one night I wont feeling good and I was laying
in bed. I went to sleep, but I woke up when I felt someone tucking me in.
I thought it was my mom so I turned over to see her, but it wasn't her.
I just saw this large dark shadow at the end of the bed.&nbsp; I was scared
and just put the covers over my head.&nbsp; Now this next thing that happened
to me, I have been looking on all sorts of sites to see if anyone has ever
had this happen to them.&nbsp; Whoever reads this, if this has happen to
you or you know someone that it did happen to would you write it down to
this site? I would gladly appreciate it. Here goes.....&nbsp; When I was
seven or eight , I was in the bed at nightand all the sudden I felt like
someone was in the bed with me. I turned to my side and I saw this man
that looked like a troll! he had no color to him at all he was just straight
white. I started whimpering, and he told me to shut up. He was so scary
to look at that I turned away and just stayed in bed. I was terrified to
move. I didn't go to sleep, I could still feel him near.&nbsp; when light
came into my room from it being morning, I got the courage to look back
to see if he was still in the bed and he was gone. What was that? growing
up after that incident always had me putting teddy bears in the bed with
me so that he wouldn't come back. but as I got alittle older I got braver
and I said to myself that if he ever came back, I was going to get him.
he&nbsp; hasn't come back, I'm nineteen now.&nbsp; Well that's all that
I want write right now. Thank you for reading</B>

<BR><B>Ghost in Texas</B>

<P><B>By: Friendz214@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I would like you to hear about my horrible encounter with a ghost
or unseen being. We were on vacation in Oklahoma visiting some relatives
that I had never met before. They lived in a thickly wooded area. That
evening after supper, and the sun had started setting, my mother and I
decided to go for a walk and enjoy the beautiful new scenery we were in.
We had been hiking for 20-30 minutes so we were several miles from the
house. Suddenly a breeze swept over us, and before us was a small pond.
I looked over into the water and saw a bright face staring back at me.
I know that it was not my reflection. I jumped back and turned around and
my mother was no where around. I began yelling and calling my mother, but
got no response. I finally got back to my relatives house and ran in. I
asked everyone if they had seen my mother and no one had seen here. This
alerted my relatives because they had 100 acres of wooded area and there
were snakes and other dangerous animals and the sun had already set. Me,
my uncle and his wife, and 2 of my older cousins headed into the dark woods
all carrying flashlights. We walked toward the pond in hopes she'd still
be near by. I looked up and behind two trees was a bright shining light.
I walked toward the light and looked behind the tree. There was the same
person who I had seen in the water. But he wasn't easy to see. It was almost
like you could see right through him. I freaked out and screamed yelling
for my relatives to come see. when they arrived they stopped and watched
the "ghost" float away over the water and into the darkness. Everyone stood
in shock of what they saw. After several hours, the woods became draped
with heavy fog. We could hardly see what was in front of us. We decided
to head back toward the house and call for help. We called the Sheriff
and he arrived with 3 other police. All night long we spent looking and
scanning the dark pond water. No sign of my mother. I was so worried. Oddly,
no one mentioned to the police what we had seen earlier. I didn't know
whether or not to say anything. I didn't want to seem crazy to the police
but I wanted to do anything to find my mother. I asked my older cousin
Charles if we should say something about the sighting we had at the pond.
He shook his head and said, "Come on, we didn't see anything, that was
probably a fire fly."</B>
<BR><B>I was totally confused. I knew I had seen a person's face in the
water, then again behind the trees. I knew that everyone else had seen
it too. I finally said,</B>
<BR><B>"Sheriff, I think there is someone or something in these woods."
Then he asked me to explain what I had seen. At sunrise the family decided
to go back to the house and let the police continue their search. I was
hesitant, but my family talked me into coming home with them.</B>
<BR><B>We walked in the house and I sat down at the table. My aunt made
me hot chocolate and asked me if I was all right. I couldn't believe what
I had seen and everyone else seen and no one was talking of it. I was confused
and started hoping that this was all a nightmare. I drew myself a bath
and climbed in. I cleared the vapor off the window and stared. I didn't
even know what to do. I wanted to feel hopeful, but the demonic stare of
the ghost haunted me. I didn't have a good feeling. I kept imaging horrible
things happening to my mother. I cried and rubbed water over my face. I
prayed that God would help us find her.</B>
<BR><B>Several days had passed and no sign of my mother. I missing persons
report was made. I was starting to lose all hope. I felt like I had lost
the most important person in my life. I wanted to go look for her myself,
but the police refused to let anyone else into the woods.</B>
<BR><B>Late that night I heard some footsteps. It kept coming closer. Then
I saw a bright light at my door. The door slowly opened and the same face
was standing there. It scared me and I screamed. It came at me fast and
suddenly I felt a burning sensation over my body. Then it felt wet. I couldn't
breath. My throat felt like it was closing.........</B>
<BR><B>I woke up in a hospital bed. My aunt was asleep in the chair next
to me. I looked up at the end of my bed. I was so confused. I couldn't
remember how I got there. My aunt awoke and told me that I had passed out
the night before and they couldn't wake me. They said I had bruises all
over my body and hand marks on my throat, like I had been strangled. "Oh
my God, it was the ghost from the pond!"</B>
<BR><B>My aunt looked at me strangly, then ran to hit the nurse button.
She looked down at me and said, "honey, you have been through a lot of
stress, you need to relax, we found your mother. She can't remember anything,
but we found her lying next to you. She's here in the hopital too only
3 rooms away." "What! I want to see her now!" I got up and ran to the hall
but was stopped by two nurses. "You have to stay in bed honey," they explained.
I sat down and told them that I needed to see her. They began injecting
me in the arm with a shot. I started to panic and asked my aunt what was
wrong with me. Then I got very dizzy and relaxed.</B>
<BR><B>I woke up to a nurse bringing my dinner. She brought to sedatives
and a glass of water. I asked her where my mother was and they said the
police were investigating her. Then she came into my room and slowly walked
over to my bed.</B>
<BR><B>She put her hand on top of mine and asked me if I was feeling ok.
I asked her if she was ok and she told me she was fine, she just doesn't
remember much. I asked her if she remembers our walk from the night we
were out on a walk together. She said she did, but didn't remeber what
happened to her after that. I asked her if she saw the face in the pond.
She said no nothing at all.</B>
<BR><B>Still to this day no one knows who or what had happened the night
of my mother's disappearance or her reappearance. No one knows what really
happened. I believe that a spirit had taken her. I don't know why or what
he did it for. It could have just been an evil ghost causing chaos. Police
think there is someone behind it. Like a kidnapper, and when he tried to
return my mother he saw me and panicked and tried to kill me. The police
had me describe the man's face that I saw. They have yet to find a person.
I wish that I knew what had really happened that night. It would ansewer
so many questions for me.</B>

<P><B>Different Ways</B>

<P><B>By:munkeeluver2000@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I wasn't going to share this story because I didn't think it was
an actual ghost story..but I thought I about it and I guess it could be,and
if not it's still kind of weird and interesting.</B>
<BR><B>When I graduated High School in 1998 I went up to Ohio to visit
a friend who graduated a year ahead of me and went up there to go to College.I
graduated on the 6th and left on the 8th and stayed there for 10 days.Well
about 3 nights before I came back which would have been the night of the
15th morning of the 16th I had a dream.In this dream I woke up in my bed
back home and there was this man sitting on my bed.He had dark brown long
hair and was clean shaven wearing a white robe.I was kind of startled at
first then it turned to curiosity.I asked who he was.He says something
like you know of me but don't know me.And then goes on saying how we are
alike and that we would be the same and just a bunch of stuff like that.I
was still confused because he never said who he was.He was telling me not
to worry that everything will be OK.and just a bunch of stuff that I couldn't
figure out.Well to make a long story short I just passed of the dream as
a weird dream.That was until I got home. I told my mother about it and
she asked when was the dream..and I told her the night of the 15th. She
had this weird look on her face and then showed me this letter. It was
dated June 16th 1998 and it was a letter she wrote to a brother that was
born before me and died after he was born.I knew about him but never knew
exact details like his birthday.She thinks it was my older little brother
coming to visit me on his birth a death day.And when I heard that then
all that he said made sense.So I guess there are different ways of spirits
contacting you.</B>

<P><B>After Moving In</B>

<P><B>By: jamiehood@cox-internet.com</B>

<P><B>This is my story....</B>
<BR><B>After all the stories I read I wanted to tell my own.</B>
<BR><B>It was 1990 we moved from one small town in Southeast</B>
<BR><B>Kansas to another.&nbsp; To tell you the lay out of the house</B>
<BR><B>so you'll know what i'm talking about on the front of the</B>
<BR><B>house was a large screened in porch. That's where the front</B>
<BR><B>door was to the house.&nbsp; When you walked in that door there</B>
<BR><B>was stairs that led up to the second story.&nbsp; That's where my</B>
<BR><B>story begins.&nbsp; When we first looked at the house my sister</B>
<BR><B>(who is two years older then me) went up stairs to look at</B>
<BR><B>the bedrooms where we would sleep.&nbsp; As we walked</B>
<BR><B>through the second door we saw someone go through the</B>
<BR><B>wall.&nbsp; That's where it all started.&nbsp; After we moved in
things</B>
<BR><B>started to happen. At night my dad would hear someone</B>
<BR><B>open the front door and walk across the hard wood floor</B>
<BR><B>(That had carpet on it).&nbsp; He would get up and look</B>
<BR><B>the front door was still dead bolted.&nbsp; I would hear someone</B>
<BR><B>walk up and down the stairs all night long. I mainly slept with</B>
<BR><B>sister after that.&nbsp; After about a month my dad ended up in</B>
<BR><B>hospital, so me and my sister where home alone for a while</B>
<BR><B>with out our mother there.&nbsp; That's when strange things really</B>
<BR><B>started to happen.&nbsp; The enity would start scaring us. It would</B>
<BR><B>knock on the back door, open and slam the cabinets closed.</B>
<BR><B>Walked across the upstairs floor, slamming doors.&nbsp; Our poor</B>
<BR><B>dog would not even go up stairs it would sit at the foot and</B>
<BR><B>bark and whine.&nbsp; To make a long story short, after my dad</B>
<BR><B>got home from the hospital the thing tryed to smother my</B>
<BR><B>mom to death (my mom always slept on her stomoch) it sit</B>
<BR><B>push her head it to her pillow, until she got free and woke</B>
<BR><B>my dad up and told him.&nbsp; The next week we moved.</B>
<BR><B>Someone bought that house and remodeled it, I wonder if</B>
<BR><B>they had the same problem we did?</B>

<P><B>Hauntings</B>

<P><B>By: fireball120@bellsouth.net</B>

<P><B>My sister and her family lives in a place that appears to be built
on a grave yard.&nbsp; There are stone markers all over her yard.&nbsp;
Yesterday I was over there and accidentally knocked over a large marker
and attempted to right it.&nbsp; I could not budge it to get it back in
its place, and yet when I visited today, the stone was once more erect
and there was no signs that it had ever been otherwise.</B>
<BR><B>My sister also has spoken of a lady that used to live there in the
1800's.&nbsp; The lady's name was Inez.&nbsp; Reported to me by my sister,
Inez told her that she was glad to have a family living once more in the
house.</B>
<BR><B>My mother has reported feeling someone patting her on the back,
and no one actually being there.</B>
<BR><B>I personally have saw a white form in the house, and a darker gray
form speeding by the window outside.&nbsp; After bolting the door to the
crawl space to the attic securely, the door opened by itself.&nbsp; That
happened just yesterday.&nbsp; My brother in law reported that when he
went into the attic via the crawlspace in order to access inside roofing
beams, he was pushed down and fell out of the attic.</B>
<BR><B>About a month ago while my sister and her husband were asleep in
bed, the small air conditioner that was securely bolted into the window
was thrown inward into the bedroom floor.</B>
<BR><B>My sister has also reported an instance in which "Inez" told her
of a hanging suicide that occurred in an old barn structure on the property.&nbsp;
My sister was also told that there was an evil&nbsp; person buried on the
property underneath a tree outside of her bedroom window.</B>
<BR><B>These are honest statements made by various people with no mental
delusions or anything that would indicate a seperation from a reality state.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Passage and Others</B>

<P><B>By: the_griff59@hotmail.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>i have 3 stories which might interest readers of this sight and the
first happened to my granddad, as a young man he lived in a small town
in the north west of england called widnes, one night he was walking home
from the pub when he reached an ally that took him through a short cut
. as he was walking down it he noticed to figures a little ahead of him
(a man and a woman ) both were dressed in victorian clothes and at first
he thought they must have bin at a fancy-dress party and didn't take much
notice of them, but then as they turned a corner he got a funny feeling
and knew that as he turned the corner himself he would find them gone,
and sure enough there was nobody there, this ally had no other corners
it was strait brick walls on either side so my grandfathers only explanation
is that the ghostly old fashioned couple literally vanished.</B>
<BR><B>my second story is one that happened to my dad one night. he was
a heavy goods driver, doing the night shift and was driving across the
country. it was the middle</B>
<BR><B>of the night and the motorway was quiet, he hadn't passed any one
for a long time when he noticed a man a little way infront of him lit slightly
by his head lights but mostly in shadow at first my dad thought he mush
have broken down and was preparing to stop and offer some help, but as
he got oser he realised that the man had not moved a muscle, not even blinked
just stood and stared at the lorry, he freaked my dad out a little so he
decided that he wouldn't stop but just as he was about to drive past him
the man stepped out infront of the truck. my dad realised what had happened
and hit the breaks. he took his mag-light and went to see if the man had
survived, he walked around the lorry and couldn't see any one so he had
to get down on the ground and look around the wheels and the wheel arches
at this point he was really scared of what he might see, because by now
he thought that the man was all mushed up under the vehicle but he still
didn't find anything, so he walked along the motorway in both directions
and checked along the road side but he didn't find any thing, when he was
sure there was no one out there he got back into the lorry and tried to
think it through rationally when it occurred though him that he had not
felt any thing as the man had disappeared under the truck (as you would
if you ran something over) . when he reached the truckers cafe he asked
some other men to look over his vehicle but when they didn't find any thing
and he told them what happened, one of them just said that there have bin
strange occurrences on that road for a while now and nobody's ever been
able to explain it.</B>
<BR><B>i have other stories of my own experience but shall save them for
another time.</B>

<BR><B>Terrifying</B>

<P><B>By: LrPapillion@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I would visit my aunt and my cousins every summer. One year they
moved into a new house with a huge basement where we all used as a play
area. At first I couldn't stand going down there. I felt cold and unsafe
just whenever I happened to be down there. I would never stay there by
myself. One night we all decided ((not me)) to sleep in the basement under
tents made out of old sheets.&nbsp; As I was about to drift off to sleep
I heard music playing (( some oldies tune)) and assumed one of my cousins
turned the radio on. I got up and for sure the radio was playing. I switched
the knob to the off button but it was still playing. I wasn't alarmed cause
the radio was really old and we used a screw driver to turns stations.
So I grabbed for the cord and pulled it and then I realized it wasn't plugged
in.&nbsp; Feeling panicked I turned and notice that the unfinished bathroom
door was opened and with the light was on. My uncle kept the door locked
at all times due to some electrical work that needed to be done. I stood
there frozen even though my instincts told me to run.&nbsp; I felt paralyzed.
I couldn't keep my gaze off the bathroom. All I saw was a toilet seat and
the sink that was placed on the floor and one bulb that hung suspended
off the ceiling. Slowly the bathroom door began to close. Once it was shut
I was able to move and boy did I! I ran up stairs and woke up my aunt.&nbsp;
terrified I could only gasp out alligator. For in my young mind I visioned
something scaly and low to the floor with lots of teeth.&nbsp; Still to
this day I refuse going down in that basement.&nbsp; My Aunt and Uncle
claim they can hear music playing in the basement when its late at night
even though that old radio was thrown away years ago. It isn't a scary
experience but it was terrifying to me!</B>

<P><B>The Land Of Moses and Gypsy Hill</B>

<P><B>By: l.schippers@mchsi.com</B>

<P><B>While reading the information that is listed about haunted sites
in Indiana, I came accross a place that I recognized.&nbsp; The listing
on The Land of Moses and Gypsy Hill is close to where I live.&nbsp; I had
no idea that it was haunted.&nbsp; When I read the article, the hair on
the back of my neck began to stand up.&nbsp; Thats when i told my friend
that we had to go there and try to find the remanes of the old house where
the gypsy supposedly lived.&nbsp; When we got there we found a dead white
dog.&nbsp; We ventured off into the woods hoping to come accross some sort
of siting.</B>
<BR><B>Upon walking through the woods and feeling the constant erie feeling
that we were being watched; we kept coming accross places were our hair
would stand up on our necks at the same time.&nbsp; At these points, our
bodies would be engolfed by freezing cold spots.&nbsp; When we no longer
felt that we were being watched it would become warm again.</B>
<BR><B>We saw various places that it looked like someone had made camp.&nbsp;
There were lots of old tarps and rusted sheet metal hung from tree to tree.&nbsp;
Once to the other side of the woods, we were standing along side the tree
line when we heard shrills and shreeks, but they were low pitched.</B>
<BR><B>We rushed to the front of the woods and were saying, "show us that
you are here."&nbsp; We were also whistling to her.&nbsp; We reached the
edge of the woods and was quiet for some time hoping that this would be
my first siting.</B>
<BR><B>Though we didn't see anything defanant, we heard about seven high
than low pitch whistles in intervals a few times.&nbsp; Along with that,
we heard a series of gunshots than an engine bogging out.</B>

<P><B>The Wife</B>

<P><B>By: london.production@tns-global.com</B>

<P><B>This actually happend to an ex-girlfriend of mine a couple of years
ago.&nbsp; She had just got a job working for Virgin Atlantic as one of
the cabin crew and was very excited to be on her first trans-atlantic flight
to America.</B>
<BR><B>About seven hours into her shift, the supervising staff gave her
the clear to take an hour break.&nbsp; Un be known</B>
<BR><B>to me, these new very large aircraft have bunk like sections in
the down stairs part of the plane for staff to go and get some shut eye
or just relax and have some rest.&nbsp; When she entered the rest hole,
to her surprise, she found an elderly American lady sitting on one of the
bunks looking a bit sorry for herlself, my ex, Janey, explained to the
lady that 'these are for staff only and would she mind going back up on
deck and find her seat'.&nbsp; The woman explained to Janey that she didnt
feel well atall after quite a hectic trip to the UK and would she mind
fetching her husband, Mr Berkenshaw, who was upstairs in seat 14c.&nbsp;
Being a very kind sought, Janey comforted the woman, who did seem to be
in some distress, for a minute or two and then went up on deck to inform
her husband.&nbsp; On getting upstairs, sure enough, there was an elderly
gentleman sitting in 14c. 'Excuse me, Mr Berkenshaw?' 'Yes', replied the
man, 'Sorry to bother you sir but your wife is down bellow in the staff
quarters and she appears to be in some discomfort, she wants you to go
sit with her'.&nbsp; At this, the man looked at her in absolute disgust
and then started to lay into her shouting and swearing.&nbsp; 'My wife?
My bloody wife? Yeah, she is down stairs, I bloody know she's downstairs!'&nbsp;
At this point more air staff came to her assistance to try and sort the
situation.'This idiot girl is sick in the head, saying my wife spoke with
her down stairs, my wife is downstairs, I know, in her coffin!'&nbsp;&nbsp;
Janey was now crying and confused, really in a state of shock, panic and
the rest.</B>
<BR><B>The old lady she had just spoken to previously was infact a ghost
and had come to Janey to ask to speak to her husband after dying of a heart
attack on their trip to the UK.&nbsp; Six months on, Janey is still recieving
counselling paid for by Virgin to try and sort her head out.&nbsp; It is
not everyday that you converse with the dead especially when they appear
to be in human form.&nbsp; As a result of this experience, our relationship
suffered and Janey is still trying to get a grip mentally but she has never
been the same since.</B>
<BR><B>The qustion that I have after being involved in somthing like this
is the rule factor.&nbsp; I am sure that what ever governs the actions
of the dead, that they shouldnt be alowed to converse with the living as
this creates confusion and dispair, as I have seen.&nbsp; The effects this
type of meeting can have on some people, especially a young innocent girl
is devistating.&nbsp; Did the old lady not yet know the rules because she
was a new ghost? did she even realise that she herself was dead?&nbsp;
Many more questions pose to this true, but facinating story.</B>

<P><B>Out of Body Experience?</B>

<P><B>By: ETippett@fortisproperties.com</B>

<P><B>This happened about 20 years ago when I was 14, camping with my parents
and</B>
<BR><B>brother in our motorhome.&nbsp; I was asleep on the big bunk overhead
with my</B>
<BR><B>brother.&nbsp; I could hear my parents calling us to wake up for
breakfast.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>was having this dream or so I thought. I was walking along this
busy city</B>
<BR><B>street in a city I did not recognize, all I knew is that it was
way busier</B>
<BR><B>and bigger than my home city.&nbsp; There was a lot of traffic,
almost looked</B>
<BR><B>like rush hour. This little girl was walking with me. She was blond
and</B>
<BR><B>dressed in 70s style clothing, a coat with a fake fur collar.&nbsp;
She was</B>
<BR><B>playing in traffic, running out into the street and dodging cars
and</B>
<BR><B>giggling. She ran back to me and I told her not to go in the road,
she would</B>
<BR><B>get hit. She said "that's all right, I don't have a body to go back
to</B>
<BR><B>anyway" and went running out in the&nbsp; road again.&nbsp; I started
being able to</B>
<BR><B>hear my parents louder but I still couldn't move. I felt myself
passing</B>
<BR><B>through the thin cold metal wall of the trailer and going back into
my body.</B>
<BR><B>It felt like sinking into warm marshmallow. Then I could wake up
and answer</B>
<BR><B>my parents. I have never had an experience like that before or since.</B>

<P><B>My Mums Perfume</B>

<P><B>By: pk003g3270@blueyonder.co.uk</B>

<P><B>my mum recently died and I moved houses and I now live with my dad.
I have always believed in ghosts but I had never experienced a presents
until a couple of weeks ago.I was upset about my mums death and I was trying
to get asleep when I smelt a perfume and it was the perfume my mum used
to wear. No one wears it in my house so I knew it couldn't of been anyone
spraying it. I tried to forget about it and go asleep and when the smell
became stronger I opened my eyes as I felt like I was being watched.&nbsp;
As soon as I opened them I knew someone was in my room, I opened my eyes
and I saw a out line of someone's face near mine when I looked closer it
looked like my mums face when I started to cry it went. I haven't seen
it again but im hoping I will.</B>

<P><B>Just Minding My Own Business</B>

<P><B>By: zandor_8@hotmail.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I had just woken up from a good night's sleep and was now lying on
my side</B>
<BR><B>facing the wall, I was just thinking 'mundane thoughts' (as you
do).&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>suddenly got the feeling that I wasn't alone, that there was something
over</B>
<BR><B>by my bedroom door (at the foot of my bed), I couldn't look towards
the door</B>
<BR><B>as I couldn't move my body or head- my eyes were open and I could
move them,</B>
<BR><B>however I couldn't move my head so was resigned to watching the
wall.</B>
<BR><B>In the space of a few seconds, I heard a most pitiful moaning sound
coming</B>
<BR><B>from the door, at the same time I felt a weight press down at the
end of the</B>
<BR><B>bed behind me.&nbsp; The sound was like nothing I have ever heard
before (I felt</B>
<BR><B>just an immense sadness and pity for this thing, as I had the feeling
it was</B>
<BR><B>in such enormous pain).&nbsp; The weight on the bed seemed to suddenly
shoot up</B>
<BR><B>the bed and come to rest behind my head, than the sniffing began!
it felt</B>
<BR><B>like a dog was breathing on my neck and sniffing it quite frantically
(like</B>
<BR><B>when a dog finds an interesting smell - it tends to go into a frenzy
of</B>
<BR><B>sniffing!).&nbsp; This was over as quickly as it started, nothing
else happened</B>
<BR><B>after that and it's hard not to put it down to imagination as it
was such a</B>
<BR><B>strange incident.&nbsp; However I definitely know it wasn't my imagination.</B>
<BR><B>I thought to myself when it was sniffing my neck that it was exactly
like a</B>
<BR><B>spirit dog might behave, but I knew in my mind that it wasn't a
dog and the</B>
<BR><B>moans were unlike anything I've ever heard before.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Pittsburgh Hotel</B>

<P><B>By: JMD2735@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>I worked for a hotel in Pittsburgh for eight years. Many odd things
would happen at night while I was working the graveyad shift. The automatic
revolving door would spin all night long even though it is motion activated.
You would hear someone walking down the hall behind you even though you
are alone.</B>
<BR><B>One night while working the 11pm to 7am shift I had a guest call
me requesting to switch rooms, he was shaken up a bit and did not care
what room I moved him to. He said he woke up to find a man standing next
to his bed. When he asked who he was the man walked thru the wall and disappeared.
Sometimes this ghost is seen holding a baby. We would often times get a
complaint from other guests about a baby crying, when we get to the room
that the guest says the crying is coming from the room would be empty.</B>
<BR><B>We had a room that no guests liked to stay in, they said the room
would have cold spots or sometimes the room would be freezing. This room
is 421. The TV in this room would turn on in the middle of the night, change
channels, then turn off. The engineers could not find anything wrong with
the TV.</B>
<BR><B>One night while the auditor was walking near room 421 she felt someone
tap her shoulder. When she turned around no one was there so she continued
on walking. When she neared 421 she felt a hand on her shoulder, again
no one was there. Suddenly the door to 421 slammed shut and she heard a
voice in the room speaking a language she had never heard before. She quickly
ran to the front desk and refused to go near that room again. I thought
she was joking, so I went to check out the room. There room was vacant
except for it being so cold I was shivering in August.</B>
<BR><B>I do know that over the years since the hotel opened in 1973 that
there have been some deaths on property. I think they don't know that they
should have checked out.</B>

<P><B>Experineces I have been Through</B>

<P><B>By: Dragonfly8105@aol.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Hello, my name is Crystal, all my life I have delt with things that
other people would swear I was crazy for but now being 22 going on 23 I
know that I'm not. I believe in an after life and of ghost .when I was
18 I had just gotten married to my husband when he came back from basic
training. Let me tell you the first time I laid eyes on my husband I was
only 13 and some one told me a man anyway said "that is the person you
are going to marry "it was really weird and at the same time I knew it
was the truth. I even turned around and told my sister ,who was at the
city pool with me and she said "no your not you had better stay away frome
him, hes one of the bad boys "you have to know I didn't even know his name.
anyway 5 years later when I married that same boy at 18 I'll start. I talked
to a phsycic on the phone and they told me I have 2 spirit guides that
watch over me and that while I was alone in my home I should ask them to
either turn on and off the light or knock on the wall for me to show me
they were there. Well I thought about this for about three weeks and decided
to do it so while my husband was at work one day I sat on my living room
couch with no tvs on or any thing and said if you are there please turn
on and off the light or knock on the wall I waited and nothing happened
so I repeated myself still nothing happened so I got fusterated and said
yeah right I knew you couldn't do it and turned on the tv about 15 mins
later some thing knocked on the inside of my living room wall three times
I was really startled I jumped up and ran into my kitchen right behind
my living room wall even though I knew no one was in my apartment it was
only one bedroom and I was in the room with the only enterance so anyway
I went back into the living room and thought man that was weird did it
really happen sure enough about 30 mins later it happened again three knocks
like before Well this happened continuently for around six months about
three times a day thats including every night when I went to bed the same
three knocks in the wall infront of the foot of my bed I was constantly
asking my husband do you hear that an he really thought I was crazy. Finally
one day I told him what I had done and he looked at me and said "well did
you ever ask them to stop "I said "what "and he said "well did you" and
I stopped and thought about it and started laughin because I had never
thought of that and it was so funny. So needless to say I asked them to
stop and it did. Now a year later we had moved to a two bedroom apartment
across the apartment complex because I was pregnant with my daughter ,
well I was like 4 months along and one day I got up and felt so awfull
it was like I had no energy whatsoever I sat on the couch in the living
room not eating or anything not wanting to move well it was like 7 something
in the evening and my husband was in the second bedroom working on the
crib and I just felt like I had to get off that couch because something
was definitly wrong, I went to my bedroom and laid on my bed when I did
some grayish smokey object started flying from the ceiling like swooping
down on me I felt like I was about to die I literaly felt like I was sinking
down into my materress and tears were coming out of my eyes I started screaming
my husbands name and he was only across the thin hall in the second room
but he didn't seem to hear me I just knew I was dieing when he finally
came in the room and said "what" I said "just lay on top of me "he came
over and layed on my feet and I said "no get on top of me all the way "and
he came over to me to lay on top of me and he had either hand already on
either side of me coming down when he jumped up and grabbed me off the
bed and ran with me out of my apartment when he sat me down outside on
the stairs I just started bawling and didn't quit for about an hour I felt
so much better but it had scared me really badly.I asked him why he had
done that and he said when he bent down he felt something go over his neck
and all his hair stood up and he knew it wasn't good so we left for awhile
when we came back to the apartment about 3 hrs later I didn't feel anything
anymore. Well the rent was going up 100 dollars a month and we couldn't
afford that on a e-2's salary with a baby on the way so I went house hunting
well I found this old house on 8th street in killeen tx . Let me tell you
it looked really bad from the outside but when I went in I was amazed everything
was great It looked great I brought my husband to see it after he got off
work the walls were white and the wood floors were all polished and looked
brand new I looked through the cabinets and drawars and they were all clean
I went into the bathroom and it was spotless The kithchen tile floor was
awesome I had always wanted white and black tiles. And it was only 400
amonth. My husband kept looking at me like I was crazy the whole time I'm
sitting there telling him how great it is and can he believe our luck and
he asked me if I was seriouse I got mad and said I really wanted the place
because I just had this feeling like I really needed to live here. Well
let me tell you the day we got our keys for the house was the next time
we went into the house and I was in for a big shock I walked in and right
away noticed the yellow walls I looked around and went and touched them
and said what happened did she paint the walls this is awfull my husband
looked at me like I was nuts and said no they are the same color they were
when we were here the other day I went through all of the rooms the hard
wood floor was scratched and spotted with urine and poop spots that hadn't
been totally cleaned up from a animal I was discusted the drawars and cabinets
were stinky and had rat poop in them and candle wax and trash I said were
did this stuff come from it wasn't like this the other day and my husband
said I don't know whats amatter with you but its just like it was. The
kitchen floor with the nice tile had gashes and slices in it and was stained
beyond repair the toilet in the bathroom was really gross. Well we had
already paid so I just put all of this down to maybe I am going crazy and
started cleaning. Well let me tell you the first thing that started happening
My husband and I would be in bed and I would have this weird feeling and
couldn't go to sleep after my husband had already fallen asleep and at
the same time every night I would hear some one with boots on walking back
and forth on the hard wood floor in the living room and I would wake john
up and tell him some one was in the house to go check he would get up and
go look around the house and come back and tell me I was just imagening
things to go back to sleep(he had no idea I'de never went to sleep in the
first place it got so bad after about a month he told me not to wake him
up any more unless it was life or dead because he had to get his sleep
to go to work in the morning . I stared having these dreams about A really
nice big man that told me and showed me this mean lady with long brown
hair that had done mean things to him and a little brown haired boy that
couldn't have been older than 5-7 and he told me not to worry he would
keep me safe he showed me this woman locking this little boy in the bathroom
and keeping him there and he said she had done alot worse things. Well
this freaked me out So I got to thinking about it and went and looked at
my bathroom door after the first dream I had . The door was the original
door it had a hole drilled through it like someone had put it there to
look in . There was also and old loup for a latch lock and a hole for it
to go in on the frame I was really freaked out then I showed my husband
and he said there had to be some kinda explaination Any way it was like
the second month that my husband decided to see what was in the old duplex
in the back yard . Well ,what we found in there was really weird and creepy
There were about, at eye count ,30 babycribs old ones and ones dated up
to about 1997 or 96 when they had gotten those white cribs and all the
addintical sides were tied together with wire so 2 peices pere bounding
there was and antique baby potty seat It was wooden and when I touched
it with my foot it fell apart there was a dumbo toy also and we know how
old that had to be well anyway it was really freaky and I had this awfull
feelling our land lord had told us to stay out of there that she had nailed
it up and didn't want us in there. So anyway I refused to go back there
again. Well I was taking a bath one night and the steaming hot water turned
itself on full blast and I couldn't move it was like I was paralized well
my husband said afterwards that he had this stange feeling to come check
on me that something was wrong and he had heard the water come back on
so he came in and said that he actually saw the water knob turn itself
off and said it was like I was paralized and scared to death he grabbed
me out of the tub and ran with me out of the house and ran back in and
got the car keys and some clothes for me and we went and stayed at a hotel
that night thats when he finally started beleiving me.He said when he came
in the bathroom he had this awfull feeling and when he went back in the
house he had the same awfull feeling. Well another night I was watching
tv in the living room and my husband was in the bedroom with the door shut
playing nintindoe and i heard a man in the hallway say hey in a deep husky
voice I looked torawds the hall way and no one was thereI got up and went
into the bedroom and asked my husband if he had called me and he said no
I asked him if he had opened the bedroom door at all and he said no. another
time I walked into the den and as I walked across the floor something walked
right along with me but on the ceiling I could hear their foot steps so
I looked up at the ceiling when I got to the other side of the room and
turned around and walked back across the room and the footsteps followed
me I just shook my head and walked off. The next thing was when my husband
was at work I went in my room to watch tv and had just turned it on and
sat down on the edge of my bed when I felt something jump up on the bed
with me it felt like the weight of a cat. I looked around and there was
nothing so I thought well I'll go take a bath to relax and I got the water
in and got in about 2 mins later the same feeling of being paralized came
over me like there was a big weight on me and I was being pushed down into
the water and couldn't do anything about it , My husband just happened
(thank god) to get home right as my nose was going under I had already
started holding my breath. John was home early and it must have distracted
what ever it was because I was able to jump out and run an tell him what
had happened I told him we needed to put crosses in every room of the house
and say prayers because I didn't know what else to do. well 2 days after
we put the crosses up they all dissapeared and we couldn't find them. About
a week after that I was up at about 2am getting a snack and then a glass
of water when something hit the window pain in front of the kitchen sink
I looked up and dropped what I was doing and ran for the bedroom were my
husband was sleeping when I hit about the middle of the room something
flew over my head and hit the wall on my husbands side of the bed then
fell down on the cord to the window airconditioner the thing buzzed on
an off for the rest of the night I was so scared but I didn't want to wake
my husband up incase he thought I was crazy. In the morning I told him
what had happened and he looked at the cord to the ac and one of the crosses
was laying on it then I took him in the kitchen and told him I wanted to
show him and let him hear how hard the window was hit he went and stood
at the patio door and I hit it well the pane I hit with my palm went flying
out onto the patio and not even 20 seconds after that something else hit
the oppisite pane. There is a convenient store right across the road from
that house and I knew the guy that worked there Well I was over there one
night after the store had just closed and he locked up and we sat on the
curb infront of it facing my house . My husband was at the house on the
computer in the den and I could see him through the open blind. But I could
also see a big man walking back and forth in my living room when my husband
was the only one in that house. I looked at my friend and asked him do
you see john on the computer he looked and said yes and then I asked do
you see that guy walking back and forth in my living room and he said yes
and then I told him john was the only person in my house he said na ha
and seriousely thought I was playing he said well lets go see. So I took
him across the street and he came in and there was no one in the living
room I called john and the guy asked him if there was anyone else there
and john said no why and the guy said he was just wondering and then said
he had to go. That guy would call me a witch every time I went into his
store after that I guess it had some thing to do with his customs he is
not from the united states and he said he had to give me something everytime
I visited him from then on out . It really made me feel weird, because
he actually did it he wouldn't except money from me he even tried to give
me money I told him no. Anyways This is now about 1and a half months until
my daughter is due I've been pregnant the whole time. We found out a couple
that had lived in the apartment complex we had recently moved out of couldn't
afford the rent neither and hadn't been able to get another apartment yet.
My husband worked with her husband and both of our husband name was john
her name is cindy well I told them they could spend a week at our house
until they got paid and then they had to get their own place so they came
over and stayed in the den on a blow up matress I had. I got so mad while
they were there but the weird things stopped they were there almost 3 weeks
and My husband an I were getting into fights because I wanted them to leave
because they wouldn't clean up after themselfs and cindy was using up all
of my bathroom products that I wouldn't even let my husband touch you know
that specail stuff that women buy just to smell good and feel good plus
they had a cat and a dog that they insisted on keeping in my house that
kept using the bathroom in the house and it was getting on my last nerve.
I kept telling john he had to do something that they hadn't kept their
end of the bargain and that it was upsetting me well cindy came to me one
morning and asked me if anything weird had ever happened to me in the house
that I just couldn't explain and I said what are you talking about she
said last night I woke up and there was a lady with red eyes at the end
of the matress looking down at me and I was scared half to death she closed
her eyes and when she looked again the woman was gone she said she thought
maybe she had imagined it and was almost back to sleep when something started
beating on the patio door but nothing was on the other side she woke her
husband up and he said she was imagining it and to go back to sleep but
she said there was no way so I let her in on what had happened and she
said you need to get a preist or some thing in this house and they moved
out the next day. I got a dog after that and things died down and we moved
out when my daughter was 4 months old. Well the next time I started having
experiences again was when I was pregnant with my son I was 4 months when
I went back to my home town and sat in my grandmothers hospital room for
3 days until the doctor told me to call the family that she would be gone
by the time the night was over. I did and when they got there my sister
took me outside to smoke The whole family was really worried about me because
I was pregnant and I was the second closest person to her and she was the
first for me she was the best woman or person I have ever know Well when
we came back in I was washing my hands in the waiting room and I felt some
one behind me then I heard my grandma say everythings going to be alright
Your my little girl and she Squesed my hand like she always did when we
sat at the kitchen table at her house I knew before I walked back into
intensive care she was gone. And she was. I took it really bad About a
month after when I was back home I was greiving and my husband had a freind
over I went upstairs into my room to get some clothes to put on after my
bath and both of them came into the room and asked me who my freind was
I asked what they were talking about and they said A woman in a white dress
had followed me into the room but it didn't look like she was actually
walking and I got mad because I had been really upset thinking about her
all day they swore they were telling the truth so They described the woman
to me and it was a description of my grandmother in her 20's they had never
seen a picture of her like that Well I went into the bathroom to take my
bath and I started crying and once again she squezed my hand to let me
know she was there I felt better after that. Then my phone started ringing
when I was downstairs and my phone was upstairs or when I was upstairs
and my phone was down stairs it was realy weird because the caller id didn't
even show some one was calling at all and I started to get really mad about
it after a month and I got this weird feeling like it was grandma and she
thought I needed to loose weight I know its funny but its the truth Other
things have happened but hopefully I"ve told you enough to make a believer
out of anyone. It is all true as I sit here today.</B>

<P><B>Greencastle - Boon Hutch Cemetery - A ghostly police officer from
the 1950's</B>
<BR><B>sits inside the graveyard along with a blue light. There is also
a cave</B>
<BR><B>under the cemetery with a grave near the entrance. People have reported</B>

witnesses</B>
<BR><B>have even reported that bodies will fall out of their caskets into
the cave.</B>
<BR><B>One other occurrence involves sinister looking dogs with red glowing

<BR><B>that chase people to their cars, then disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp; THAT
BEING SAID....</B>
<BR><B>I have gone to several "haunted" places, but this was by far the

<BR><B>I went with my boyfriend and our best friend, and I was a little
nervous, as</B>
<BR><B>an intelligent person would be venturing into something new. BUT
I was in no</B>
<BR><B>way prepared for this at all, for what would happen. I seen no police</B>
<BR><B>officer, no blue lights, and definately no cave entrance, and definately
no</B>
<BR><B>doggies with glowing eyes. It was all feelings. As soon as we passed
into</B>
<BR><B>the cemetary (think of an invisible wall, or an invisible line)
I felt</B>
<BR><B>TERRIFIED. not, oh my god its goin to get me terrified, but oh my
god it</B>
<BR><B>already has me. i could barely breathe, let alone speak. the guys
with was</B>
<BR><B>worried, but could do nothing since they didnt know WHAT was wrong.
then,</B>
<BR><B>after a few minutes of that, it immediately became grief. I've never
felt so</B>
<BR><B>sad in my life. think of all the saddest things in the world happening
to</B>
<BR><B>you at once- it's nothing compared to what I felt. It was another
hour</B>
<BR><B>before I could stop sobbing, and tell them what it was... The spirits
were</B>
<BR><B>not happy that night, to say the least. thought you'd like to know

<P><B>The ghost of Cylus Tedrow</B>

<P><B>By: rebecca@IowaTelecom.net</B>

<P><B>I had been hearing about an old cemetary called Tedrow Cemetary for
about 2 years before I had actually went. I had went with a few friends
of mine at about 11 p.m. at night. While we were on our way, my friends
were telling me about a man who started the whole cemetary. A ghost who
was the guardian of the cemetary at night and who didn't like visitors
by the name of Cylus Tedrow.</B>
<BR><B>Apparently the story was that he was a very evil man and that he
was killed and his coffin was placed on top of a tree for everyone to see.
Now he just watches over the cemetary and waits for visitors to come by.</B>
<BR><B>I was also told that the first timers that went into the cemetary
were the unfortunate ones that he liked to target. Now I felt at the time
that they were just playing a joke on me but I found out soon that I was
wrong. We didn't even make it to the gate when stuff started to happen.
My friend started to freak out and we turned around.</B>
<BR><B>I said that we would be safe in a minute but that's when one of
my friends said that it wasn't over because he was going to follow us all
night long. I was starting to laugh and that's when all my friends looked
at me with looks of fear.</B>
<BR><B>I asked what was wrong and one of my friends said that the ghost
of cylus was looking right at me. That's when the car got cold. Very cold.
I started to turn around and the cold feeling stopped. We finally got to
the house that I would be staying at and I was told to run into the house
because cylus could not bother me when I was indoors. But I was not to
go to sleep because he would haunt me in my dreams.</B>
<BR><B>For some reason, there was a feeling of fear when we started to
run to the house and when we got inside we had a feeling that something
was outside and we were not alone.</B>
<BR><B>For a while nothing happened and I felt like this was starting to
get stupid so I told my friends that I was going to sleep. They didn't
want me to go to sleep but I wasn't able to keep my eyes open anymore.</B>
<BR><B>I layed down and was about to go to sleep when I looked up at the
window. Suddenly the fear in my body started to rise high when I saw the
most gruesome, demonic face in the window staring at me. It had sharp fangs,
and pure white eyes. The breath of it was fogging up the windows.</B>
<BR><B>I continued staring when I asked my friends if that was cylus. When
they looked up at the window they all started to scream.One of them said
that it was cylus tedrow himself. I got so scared that I ended up driving
home. When I was on my way home I saw a figure up ahead with it's thumb
sticking out.</B>
<BR><B>I thought to myself that it was a hitchhiker, but that's when I
noticed that the person was floating in thin air. I quickly locked my doors
and Cylus followed right beside my window and just kept staring at me with
those evil eyes. Finally I reached the house and ran inside and I was not
bothered by him again. Since then I've went back several times to pay my
respect to the guardian of the cemetary and nothing has happened to me.
But every now and then I hear people telling stories of being terrified
of a man that was following them and when they describe what the ghost
looks like. It is the exact description of Cylus Tedrow.</B>

<P><B>Ghost in my House</B>

<P><B>By: nicole197698@juno.com</B>

<P><B>It started just after my 3rd child was born, about 2 days after he
came</B>
<BR><B>home from the hospital. I noticed one chilly december evening, i
believe</B>
<BR><B>it was the 10th or 11th, anyway, i got up to check on my son asleep
in</B>
<BR><B>his car seat and noticed a welt had formed in the middle of his
forehead.</B>
<BR><B>I called my sister immediately and told them what was going on,
during</B>
<BR><B>the course of the conversation, it got very cold in the house, as
if my</B>
<BR><B>house was frozen in ice. I put on my winter coat and i was still
cold,</B>
<BR><B>had goosebumps up and down my body. Anyway, this particular incident</B>
<BR><B>continued for some years, whatever was making these welts was following</B>
<BR><B>me where ever i went. I had started to notice some other things
happening</B>
<BR><B>the following year and thought maybe it was my imagination until
i</B>
<BR><B>started talking to some people around the complex and found out
that my</B>
<BR><B>complex was built over a graveyard from the 1800's.&nbsp; Weird
things started</B>
<BR><B>happening around the house, and to myself. Such as my steam vac
being</B>
<BR><B>plugged in and running at 6am when myself and my baby were sleeping,
the</B>
<BR><B>volume on my stereo being turned up and down with no one but the
baby in</B>
<BR><B>the house, the tv being turned off when I'm not in the room. I have
felt</B>
<BR><B>hands on my butt and hands on my legs, i have felt someone kissing
me.</B>
<BR><B>There is alot more but i'm not going to get into great detail only
b/c</B>
<BR><B>this email would be about 5 pages long. Finally in late 2003 I contacted</B>
<BR><B>Lone Star Spirits here in Houston, TX and got a response telling
me they</B>
<BR><B>would like to investigate. So December 13th, 2003 the investigation
crew</B>
<BR><B>comes over, brings a tv crew and they begin to investigate. The
psychics</B>
<BR><B>had found an area in the farthest corner of my living room that
would</B>
<BR><B>make them nauseous and give them headaches, they were both equally</B>
<BR><B>attracted to my wall of mirrors, particularly the one right next
to the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen. In the bedroom we found a little boy named Bobby, 6yrs
old, died</B>
<BR><B>on pneumonia in 91, he's lost his mommy, doesn't know her name or</B>
<BR><B>anything about her. Bobby has said that he used to live in my condo,
this</B>
<BR><B>used to be his house, its' where he grew up, unfortunately i cannot</B>
<BR><B>contact the previous owner to find out any information.</B>
<BR><B>We also found Bobby's grandmother who died in 92 from pneumonia
as well,</B>
<BR><B>she hasn't said anything yet but she keeps bobby company. She has
offered</B>
<BR><B>to take bobby to the other side but he wants to stay b/c he is my
son's</B>
<BR><B>protector and likes playing with my son.</B>
<BR><B>We also found residual energy in the kitchen, the psychic could
hear</B>
<BR><B>things being thrown around or being dropped. Since we've found out
about</B>
<BR><B>the ghosts in the house, some strange things have happened, bobby
loves</B>
<BR><B>xmas,it's his fav. holiday. well xmas came around dec. 2003, and
i had</B>
<BR><B>decorated the house and the tree. Well bobby took it upon himself
to be a</B>
<BR><B>mischevious little boy and decided to redecorate the tree himself
and to</B>
<BR><B>also play with the xmas lights. I have also heard and so have my</B>
<BR><B>neighbors, "bumping" around the kitchen, I can only assume it's
the</B>
<BR><B>energy in the kitchen, but it's residual energy from a man and a
woman</B>
<BR><B>constantly arguing. So to this day, bobby keeps my son company by
talking</B>
<BR><B>to him and playing with him all day long, I talk to bobby but sometimes</B>
<BR><B>the house is so quiet i tend to forget bobby is here and that's
when</B>
<BR><B>bobby will make something move or something disappear, just so i
know</B>
<BR><B>he's still around. He's a friendly little boy and I've told him
he's more</B>
<BR><B>than welcome to stay if he likes, so i guess this is his house after
all!</B>

<P><B>By: michael74346@brightok.net</B>

<P><B>Hello I've got a stories that involves 3 of my friends and my self
and is 100% true it all started when my best friend moved in to a trailer
out in the middle of the country. She lived there for about a week or two
before things started to happen she had two kids that were afraid to go
in to the hall way. they would here knocking on the windows and loud banging
in her bedroom when she and her kids were sleeping,as if someone was trying
to get out of the room not in? than she got a dog that would be ok lintel
about 12.00 to 1:00 in the night when it would bark and growls at nothing
then the banging would start. Wellone night her brother was there visiting
here the knocking on the windows stated again well her brother not believing
in the supernatural thought her was going to caches the person playing
tricks on his sister thinking it was a nabor in the trailer park that she
lived in that had about 4 trailers there at that time. well the window
was about half a foot from the back door so when he heard the knocking
flung open the door to see who was out there and found nothing but a empty
field used for cows. But the first person to see anything was her cousin
Angie who had been spending the night there with Amy( the renter of the
trailer) and Amy's x-boyfriend to wake up and find a man starring at her
but she could see the big bay windows in the kitchen throw him she said
she covered her head and after awhile of that she looked to see him still
there so she jumps up and runes to amys room and sleeps on the floor and
has since then. She told no one about it but Amy and Amy told no one until
one night I was visiting her late at night and happen to look up to see
a gray man in the window walking by he had a civil war uniform on and had
hair down to his shoulder and I could see the well house throw him when
I told Amy this we went out side and aggie stayed in and said she could
only see the very tops of our head we had to stand on a bucket to see us
from the cheast down and that's id what we seen of the gray man was from
head to waste, well that it fore now I have another stories about a light

<P><B>Does She like His Company?</B>

<P><B>By: chris_nunley2004@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>When I was 16 my Aunt died in her home which was right across the
street from our own.&nbsp; No one has ever been sure if it was from natural
causes or foul play.&nbsp; Though it was unofficially ruled from congestion.&nbsp;
The day after her funeral I was at her house cleaning it up and putting
her things away when all of the sudden these bells began to ring.&nbsp;
This place had no doorbell or a chime clock.&nbsp; There was no logical
explanation for it.&nbsp; They struck seven times then quit.&nbsp; Later
that day my father went over there and the phone rang, but the phone was
unplugged, he answered it and there was static for about a minute and then
nothing.&nbsp; My cousin, her son, was still living there and he had the
bells ring on him but they would not stop.&nbsp; He moved out right after.&nbsp;
So since my family owned the place and alot of their stuff was still there
my sister and I took to staying there at night as sort of a camp out thing.&nbsp;
One night we went over and the t.v. was on we knew we hadn't left it on
and so we looked through the window on the door and saw feet.&nbsp; I was
spooked so I swung the door open and the t.v. went off that quickly and
there was no one on the couch.&nbsp; No one at all&nbsp; in the house.&nbsp;
Since then my family has rente out the place and each person or family
that lives there reports a presence.&nbsp; One family had a small boy and
he told his mom of a lady who would tuck him in at night and check on him
through the night.&nbsp; I've come to believe that this is my aunt.&nbsp;
She makes herself known on occasion but rarely tries to frighten anyone.&nbsp;
To this day she still lives or haunts the house.&nbsp; My brother lives
there now and we'll see how she likes his company</B>

<P><B>Creepy Hidden Room</B>

<P><B>By:mcleanw@muss.cis.mcmaster.ca</B>

<P><B>Hey, I just thought It'd relate a ghost story told to me by a high</B>
<BR><B>school friend of mine, who I've lost contact with. However, if you'd</B>
<BR><B>like to verify the story, you can contact the Durham Regional Police
of</B>
<BR><B>Ontario, Canada, and they''ll probably have the case on file somewhere.</B>
<BR><B>Basically, my friend's parents are second generation Polish immigrants,</B>
<BR><B>who shortly after having thier daughter (my friend, of course) moved</B>
<BR><B>out of Toronto to one of Durham's growing towns.</B>
<BR><B>They bought one of the very few older homes, and having moved in
they</B>
<BR><B>were quite comfortable for several years. Different strange things
were</B>
<BR><B>heard in the house, and things would go missing and reappear from
time</B>
<BR><B>to time, but this was all written off as the house settling or things</B>
<BR><B>just being misplaced. While some of the locations where things turned</B>
<BR><B>up were odd, the young coupe didn't think much of it (After all,
they</B>
<BR><B>did have a growing toddler in the house, and over the course of
thier</B>
<BR><B>life in this house they had two more children).</B>
<BR><B>The children were the ones to notice straneg things. They had frequent</B>
<BR><B>nightmares of being trapped in a small space, and in one part of
the</B>
<BR><B>house heard knockings on the other side of the walls. Sometimes
they</B>
<BR><B>would wake up with the sensation of being suffocated. They eventually</B>
<BR><B>began to fear the basement because they constantly felt malevolent</B>
<BR><B>presences there, and occasionally heard someone muttering.</B>
<BR><B>However, the biggest thing that happened was when the house was
being</B>
<BR><B>renovated in order to add an attached garage, a small room that
was</B>
<BR><B>never finished was discovered. Though really weird, this wouldn't</B>
<BR><B>normally be something ghost related. The creepy thing was the fact
that</B>
<BR><B>there was a box freezer wrapped in chains and embedded, face down,
in</B>
<BR><B>the concrete of the foundation. The family was obviously really
scared,</B>
<BR><B>and lived in a motel until a contractor had it removed. The reason
why</B>
<BR><B>the police was contacted was because when the freezer was opened</B>
<BR><B>afterwards, a skeleton was found inside.</B>
<BR><B>The family only returned to the hous elook enough to pack up and
leave.</B>

<P><B>A Fatherly Figure</B>

<P><B>By: hidden_thoughts@sbcglobal.net</B>

<P><B>This is my first time writting any of my so called experiences.&nbsp;
Im pretty hard to scare or convince.&nbsp; I hear sounds and noises all
the time, and its usually something u can make out or understand just by
listening and studying the sound or sighting. It honestly happens all the
time to me and im quite used to it, because as i said i can usually make
out the sounds or things i see.&nbsp; Yet there have been a few things
that even spooked me before.&nbsp; As I've said, in ways i dont care if
things happen to me and thats why i usually don't get scarred.</B>
<BR><B>There was this one time that when I lived in Dunlap Illinois,when
my mother and father where still together, they got in an argument during
the night and my mother took off.&nbsp; I remember that before the arguement
and I asked my father if I could sleep in his bedroom with him that night;
as always he said no and I ended up sleeping in my sisters bedroom, which
is located right next to the front door.&nbsp; The bottom of her bed was
close and facing the doorway.&nbsp; I woke up at the end of the bed and
and saw my father standing in the doorway r l bright and wearing a red
flanal jacket.&nbsp; I had just woken up and I was still grogy, but I AM
CERTAIN THAT I WASNT DREAMING.&nbsp; He kinda signaled me to follow him.
I thought he meant that I could sleep in his room.</B>
<BR><B>I got and left the room and right as exited I didnt see him anymore.&nbsp;
There was a good distance between my sisters room and his and I got up
fast enough to at least see him still walking.&nbsp; I walked into his
room got into his bed and went to sleep.&nbsp; He woke me up the next day
and asked me what I was doing in his bed. I told him that he came and got
me last night and he swore up and down that he didnt even get up.</B>
<BR><B>Now I honestly dont know what i saw that night and that was probaly
7 years ago.&nbsp; Im the type that can distingiush between reality and
fantasy or dreams.&nbsp; I know that this story isn't that big of a deal,
but it has honestly been some what of a myster to me ever since it happened.&nbsp;
I just want to know if anyone has ever experienced anything similar.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;Can Animals attract ghosts??</B>

<P><B>By: LrPapillion@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Hi My name is Lindsay and I live in Silver Spring Maryland. Last
May I adopted a 50 yr. old Macaw named Captain Bly. His original owners
passed away. I was told that the lady died first and Captain would walk
around the apartment calling her name and the ladies husband took him to
her wake and he stopped calling her. The gentleman died soon after and
Captain was left alone with the deceased man for a few days until they
found him.&nbsp; My family owns a kennel and I have kept him there until
recently.&nbsp; He is an extremely aggressive bird specially towards me
if men are around.&nbsp; We are renovating the house and I have started
sleeping downstairs where captain is kept. One night I was having difficultly
sleeping and I notice Captain was "aaaahhhing" like he usually does when
I pet him.&nbsp; I glanced up and Captain had his head down as if someone
was petting his head. I didn't really become concerned until he started
saying" Roger Come here" and "Roger gotta go." Captain also acts like he
is getting petted. If I get close to his cage when he is "aaaahhing" he
lunges at the cage as if to bite me. A few nights ago as I was drifting
off to sleep Captain start to mutter the word "Roger come here and aaaaahhh."
Now my Cat Cece was laying next to me and I notice she had her attention
glued toward Captains cage her tail twitching with agitation. Usually I
would just close my eyes but I kept them trained on captains cage. Sure
enough Captain had his head down as if he was being petted.&nbsp; Now he
behaved that way for at least 15 minutes and the he raised his head and
said quit clearly "Roger gotta go." Now Cece whose eyes never left captains
cage slowly turned her head as if she was following someone. Her gaze seemed
glued toward the hallway. A few minutes later she jumped off the sofa and
went into the hallway. Now I gotta tell you that incident really unnerved
me. One thing I don't know any Rogers and Cece isn't a brave cat. She runs
and hides when someone knocks on our door. I was thinking that maybe its
Captains deceased owner paying him a visit or he attracted a ghost named
Roger or I'm imagining things but I doubt it. Has anyone had something
similar happen to them?</B>

<P><B>Dad's Spirit</B>

<P><B>By: sjohnsd@optonline.net</B>

<P><B>After my dad died a few years ago, my son, 8 at the time, kept insisting
that "grampa Candycane" was checking on him.&nbsp; We had trouble with
faucets going on by them selves, toilets flushing and lights going on and
off randomly, without regard to what we did with the switches.&nbsp; Later
that year, I was standing at the door waiting for my son to get off the
bus and I felt a distint push that actually propelled me against the door.&nbsp;
I must say that I never felt in danger, just disconcerted.&nbsp; A few
months passed and I was in the kitchen making coffee when I heard my father's
voice call me by a pet name only he had ever used.&nbsp; There was an urgency
to the voice, so I spun in the direction from which I'd heard it, and in
doing so caught a glimpse out&nbsp; the front door.&nbsp; Some one was
stealing the motorcycle my father had given me years ago!</B>
<BR><B>My son insists to this day that "Grampa likes the shower, he's in
there a lot at night' (He was a master plumber, but my son didn't originally
know this).&nbsp; My sister, a ghost hunter in Pensylvania brought her
digital camera to my hose and got quite a number of orbs in it, mostly
small, but one fairly large one in the basement(where the electrical dificulties
were) and 6 or 7 on the small patio my son and I built.&nbsp; Those I doubt
that the orbs are my father I think it singularly interesting that both
occurrences are happenning here, and only sinse my dad died.</B>
<BR><B>I have a couple of orb photos I'll send along seperately as I'm
not great with the computer.</B>

<P><B>Ghostly Experiences</B>

<P><B>By: LLVC99@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My dad is a builder, and for a number of years, he has been buying
old dilapidated houses so he can tear them down and build a new house on
the property. My family and I ended up moving into one of these new houses
a few years ago...it's Victorian-style with three stories. However, the
house originally on the site had burned to the ground, killing the owner,
a reclusive old man by the name of George. For a few months after moving
in, everything was normal, but then the weird stuff started happening.
I should point out, by the way, that my dad was not really a believer in
the supernatural at this time...like if he couldn't see something, then
to him it didn't exist. However, he had begun to have nightmares, something
he had never experienced before. On a number of occasions, he even woke
up in a cold sweat, screaming! He said the nightmares always had to do
with him being chased by something he couldn't see.</B>
<BR><B>Around this time, one of my sisters, whose room was on the third
floor, said that she had heard something in her bedroom that sounded like
whispers, coming from what sounded like 2 people having a conversation.
Needless to say, she was sufficiently freaked out and extremely reluctant
to sleep in her room for a while afterwards.</B>
<BR><B>There were a number of incidents after this; for instance, around
midnight one night, everyone had gone to sleep except my dad and brother,
who was still in the library on the second floor doing homework. Before
going to bed, Dad told my brother to make sure all the lights were off
downstairs and that the doors were locked. (Why he couldn't do this himself,
I don't know). Anyway, my brother swears on his life to this day that he
shut off all the lights and locked all four doors downstairs, and went
to bed around 1 am. My dad had another nightmare that night, which was
weird because he hadn't had any in a few months...this one involved him
trying to keep a ghost out of the house by locking the doors. He woke up
trembling, in a cold sweat, at about 4 am, and knowing he wouldn't get
back to sleep, decided to go downstairs and watch TV. As he descended the
stairs, he saw, to his shock, that all the lights were on and the patio
door was wide open. Of course, he assumed that somebody had gone down in
the middle of the night. Yet my brother had been the last one to go downstairs
that night, and he swore to Dad that he had done as he was told. Creepy,
huh? Dad's a believer now:)</B>
<BR><B>There are two more incidents which happened after this; one occurred
one night while my brother was watching TV on the third floor. Up there,
we have 2 bedrooms (one of which the whispering noises came from), a bathroom,
and the rest of the floor is an open area with a TV, computer, stereo,
etc. Anyway, it was pretty late and he had fallen asleep on the sofa. My
stepmom, who was the only other person in the house at the time, heard
the TV from downstairs and went to turn it off. She then turned to wake
up my brother, and as she did, the TV went back on, this time with a lot
of static. Thinking it was a power surge, she unplugged it. But as she
and my brother were walking down the stairs, it came back on AGAIN, as
did the radio downstairs in the kitchen, at full volume. All the lights
started flickering, and my stepmom finally lost it and started yelling
at whatever was doing this, telling them to quit it. The noises finally
stopped, but she, like my dad, is now convinced there is something in the
house.</B>
<BR><B>The final incident happened to my youngest sister. (I have 2). Because
she is 9 years old and scares easily, we managed to keep all this a secret
from her, and thankfully, she hadn't been affected by it until one morning
when she was in her bathroom (yes, the one on the third floor) getting
ready for school. My stepmom was downstairs packing her lunch when she
heard a bloodcurdling scream from upstairs. My sister came running down
the stairs practically in tears, saying there was something in the bathroom
whispering to her. Keep in mind she knew nothing about what had happened
to our other sister a few months earlier! Very weird. We've pretty much
decided that it's probably the old man who died on the property who is
doing all this. However, he doesn't seem malevolent, it's more just that
he wants attention, I think. Either way, it's made believers out of me
and my whole family!!</B>

<P><B>By: lane@mountaincable.net</B>

<P><B>Hey, My name is Katelyn and I'm 13 years old and my best friend Jodi
is 12 . On the night of my grandma's death I was at Jodi's house and we
were having fun by watching scary movies and screaming. When my Dad came
to pick me up he told me that my Grandma had passed away. I was terribly
sad and when I got home I went straight to bed. When I just slipped under
the covers my room became inmensly warm when it is usually very cold and
I felt like i was being hugged and watched, but I didn't see anything until
I lay down, I saw a streik of light out of the corner of my eye that went
in to the hallway. The fallowing morning my Mom came down stairs and went
in to the dinning room/ living room to watch T.V. She saw the picture of
my Grandma &amp; Grandpa at the bonfire was balencing on the little pyramid
that was a insence holder and it didn't stop there. That night I had Jodi
over. Around midnight she woke up and saw a lady that looked like my Grandma
standing in my closet and when she turned wake me up the lady was gone.
The next moring Jodi told me all about it but I didn't really beleive her
until I started seeing streiks of light from the corner of my eyes and
the feeling iIwas being watched!</B>

<P><B>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</B>
<BR><B>by Kris Kurz</B>
<BR><B>It is truly weird. Especially the first time I went there with my
girlfriend. I would like to write what happened....at Eloise</B>
<BR><B>Out front it is called Kay Beard Building. You drive around to the
back. First as I was driving with my girlfriend we saw cats in the road
(black cats, no less), my girlfriend suddenly got out of the car like she
was possesed and went up to the cats who ran away. Then she got right back
in the car. As we drove around to the back, there is a smokestack and bunch
of broken glass windows. We think it may have been the crematorium,morgue
for the insane asylum. The first time we went there we heard a banging,
like a loud banging on pipes. Even though there was no one there. Then
we both saw a white light. Later I could have swore I saw something move
in the windows!</B>
<BR><B>At the same time, my girlfriend saw glowing red eyes! Two giant
glowing red eyes staring at her! Then she told me they turned off and then
on again.&nbsp; Like this things with the red eyes had blinked at her.
But when I looked over there it was gone. Then she saw something moving
from tree to tree.</B>
<BR><B>We heard moaning and other weird noises as well.</B>
<BR><B>The second time I went back with my friend Daron. This time was
freaky as well. As we sat in the car staring over there. We heard weird
noises. We both saw a white light (I guess you could say it was an orb).
I saw an orange light as well. We heard footsteps as if someone was walking
by. Then later the weirdest thing. I had my car turned off and we were
both quiet. When all the sudden we heard this weird "whooooosh" sound in
the car! It seemed like a spirit had went through the middle of my car-
from the back to the front of my car.</B>
<BR><B>Now I have gone back many times. And have not always had things
happen. But about half the time that I go there I see a white light somewhere.
And I once saw an orange light as well. I don't know the difference, but
the orange light definately seemes weirder and freakier.</B>
<BR><B>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</B>
<BR><B>Other ghosting experiences.</B>
<BR><B>The first time I went to Butler Cemetary (aka William Ganong Cemetary)
in Westland.</B>
<BR><B>Me and my friend Chris Grant both swear we heard a loud crash. So
loud that it sounded like a tree falling over. Then looked and absolutely
nothing happened at all. Nothing was there. Near the entrance where we
heard it. Oddly enough, with how loud it souded, my other friend Daron
said that he didn't hear it.</B>
<BR><B>When me and my friend Daron went to Goodrich Graveyard in Romeo.</B>
<BR><B>He said something to the extent of let me hear you ghosts, let me
see you or hear you. I thnk not exactly sure what he said. But he swears
after he said that it sounded like he heard weird voices.</B>
<BR><B>Trodes Bridge. Although me and my friends never went down below
there for fear of being cought by the police. We did go on the bridge itself
a coupletimes. got really weird feelings, but only the first time we went
there.</B>
<BR><B>One other cemetary, a small cemetary in Westland/Garden City area
. Don't know the name. My friends and I were walking through there and
it sounded like I heard footsteps behind me.</B>
<BR><B>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</B>
<BR><B>Daddy</B>
<BR><B>My girlfriend's dad died when she was little like 6 years old. Each
house she has been in she has seen her dad once in that house. In 3 different
houses. It is as if her dad felt he had to watch over her or had something
infinished with her. I remember her telling me one time at he house in
Eastpoint see saw a figure walk by her room. And she could tell it looked
just like her dad. But the third time she told her dad that she was ok.
That she didn't need him to watch over her and that he could go on.</B>

place in Virginia on Exlax road. My brother and some of his friends decied

Mansion which is off of that road.It was during winter so they had the
heat on and they had also brought some blankets along.they pulled up on
Exlax road and stopped the car . they waited for a couple of minutes and
some of them decided togo to sleep cuz it had gotten so boaring. then they
heard deep breathing and growling noises comming from outside the car.
they heard branches snapping and the leaves started crunching so they decied
to just leave and go to potts mansion. By then some of them were sleeping.
The pulled through the drivway of the mansion and the car turned ice cold
even with the heat on , all their blankets and their coats and jackets
on the car windows had started to fog up. They heard a loud banging noise&nbsp;
and&nbsp; wanted to leave. the drove away and stopped once they had gotten
off of exlax road to wake their friends that were alspeep and tell them
what had just happend. His friend who was in the front passenger seat woke

the banging noise that they had heard.&nbsp; ok so thats what really happend

<P><B>Lila</B>

<P><B>By: Shelbydoo2003@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Well.I am not really sure where to begin.I guess I should start at
the beginning.We moved into our current home in October of 2003.We still
live here.I am sure that we are not alone here as well.We have had quite
a few experiences and were not sure at first what was causing them.Not
until one particular night when I picked up some pictures from the photo
place.I will begin.We had been moved in for less than a month when strange
things started happening.The first feeling that something was wrong came
to me around three o clock in the morning.I have a baby that is now ten
months old.She woke me,as was her fashion at the time,crying very loudly
for her bottle.I went into her room and found the bottle,not daring to
turn on the light,fearful that it would only add to her growing irritabilty.I
went into the kitchen and as I was waitng for the water to boil so I could
warm her bottle I thought I seen aomvement out of the corner of my eye
in the dining room.I walked into the room and looked arounf(we do not have
any pets)and found nothing or no one.Telling myself that I must be half
asleep still I finished with the bottle and wandered back into my daughter's
room.She was still crying for the bottle and I lifted her out of her crib
and sat down in a comfortable chair to feed her and send her back to sleep.She
soon drifted back into a peaceful dreamy sleep so I layed her back down
in her crib.She turned over to her side and continued to sleep.I began
my way back to my own bedroom but stopped dead in my tracks as I reached
the hallway.This time it was not my imagination or being half asleep.I
knew I had definetly seen something.I just did not know WHAT I had seen.I
have always been frightened of ghosts or anything out of the ordinary,yet
I have always believed in them.I had always expected to feel very cold
or odd at the moment tha a ghost was close though.I did not feel in any
way different at the minute.I began to follow my instincts and grabbed
the closest object at hand to use as a weapon.This turned out to be a screwdriver
that my husband had absentmindedly left lying around.I was under the assumption
that perhaps a rat or some other animal or person had unknowingly gotten
into the house.I did not want to wake my husband because he had to get
up very early the next morning.I strode toward the dining room and before
entering called out.When no one answered I thought that it was probably
just a rat.I turned to go back to bed and found myself face to face with
a young girl.She was about eleven years old.She was a beautiful little
girl but not breathtakingly so.I tried to speak to her but could not seem
to find my voice.She stood there looking almost mischievious.I then thought
that perhaps this was a favorite spot of some of the neighborhood kids
to play.After all the house had been empty for quite some time before our
purchase.She smiled at me and turned to leave.I felt a little better all
of a sudden and decided to ask her who her parents were and where she lived.When
I did not recieve an answer I tried to follow her but by the time I reached
the spot where I had last seen her she was gone.I must have honestly not
known what I was thinking.I decided that she had simply crawled out of
the house the same way that she had entered.I gave up and went back to
bed.Morning comes quite early when you have young children.I fell back
to sleep quite easily and did not dream.A few days went by and I finally
remembreed the events of that evening and told my husband about them.He
stood and laughed at me when I told him that perhaps we had a ghost.He
is always joking me about being scared of my own shadow.I simply laughed
with him.How could we have a ghost.They arent even real?Well time went
gby and about two months after our move in my husband and I decided to
stay up late one night and watch movies on pay per view.We were watching
a pretty good movie when we must have dozed off.I was awoken by not my
daughter but my husband.He was pulling on my arm telling me to look in
the dining room.I looked but did not see anything.I asked him what I was
supposed to be looking for and he told me that he had just watched a tiny
pair of feet glide across the floor heading for our attic.THE ATTIC!Of
course.The girl must have been hiding up there for quite some time.I told
him that it was probably the girl I had seen not long ago.We found a flash
light and after checking on our daughter proceeded to go up into the attic.We
did not find anything.Just some old junk left by the previous occupants.We
had already looked through all of these thoings when we moved in so we
simply descended the stairs.We went to bed and did not talk about it any
more.Some time has passd now and we are positive that we have a ghost.She
loves to play with our childrens toys and let us know when she is not happy.If
we do not keep our house clean to her standards she gets furious and breaks
things.If we do not leave the bathjroom light on at night she will not
let us sleep.She will continuosly flick the switch so that we finally just
close our bedroom doo.We had to move our youngest daughter into the bedroom
with us due to the fact that one night I was woken by her screamin and
not for a bottle this time.I ran down to her room and threw on the light.She
was not in her crib.I yelled for my husband.He came running as though he
knew something was terribly wrong.We searched the entire room for her and
could not find her.We could still hear her screaming though.My husband
pointed towards the living room and said that it sounded like she was in
there.I was dumbstruck.How could she get into the living room without someone
to carry her?She could not crawl at the time.Needless to say we moved her
into our room and now we continue to live with the little ghost that we
have come to refer to as Lila.She is here and always will be.</B>

<P><B>Little Boy in the Night</B>

<P><B>By: ashesashes03@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>This is in fact a true story. I had never before believed in ghosts,
until one year while I was still in high school. My sister, who is 14 years
older than I am, and has 3 kids (2 girls and a boy), was living with my
mom and I for a couple of months. (Note that before her arrival, I had
barely spoken to her while I was growing up, therefore, I hardly knew her
at all, or any of the experiences that she had had previous). One night,
I'd say about 3am, everything became dealthy quite. They say that human
beings have a natural sense of someone or something else's presence. This,
I suppose was my sense. Normally at night, where I live anyway, you can
hear the sound of a train passing by, as we live near the railroad tracks,
and you can hear several cars driving up the street. It's not a quite neighborhood.
On this particular night though, there wasn't a sound; no train, no cars.
The three kids were all asleep, I was asleep in my bed, my mom in her bed,
and my sister on the couch. For some reason, I was pulled out of a dream,
and when I awoke, there was a little boy standing next to my bed holding
my hand. Now, I thought it was my nephew, the same sandy blonde hair, the
same height, and what appeared to be the same age. Only, he was wearing
a hat and overalls, not his pj's. But at that time of night, no one would
think anything of it. I asked the boy what was wrong, and he told me that
he had had a bad dream. So, still half asleep, I told him to climb into
my bed, and that I would protect him. He soon fell asleep, my arms wrapped
around him; hugging him tightly. I too soon drifted off to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>In the morning, after I woke up, the boy was gone and the kids were
all downstairs having their breakfast. When I came downstairs, I went over
to my nephew and asked him if he had had any more bad dreams. He looked
at me as if I were crazy. My sister, had then come into the room, and was
curious to know what we were talking about. I told her about the night
before, and the boy's description and she too looked at me as though I
was crazy. She then filled me in: my nephew had gotten up a little after
they (the kids) had gone to sleep, and went downstairs to sleep with my
sister, where he didn't get up until the next morning.</B>
<BR><B>Strange enough, but ok. I let it go, thinking that I could have
dreamt the whole thing. Come to find out later on, that my sister had been
pregnant a while back, planning on it being a boy, but had had a miscarriage
3 months before her due date. And the boy, her miscarried son, grew up
in her house, and had followed the family when they had come to stay with
us. Two months later, when my sister found an apartment and was moving
out, the boy, followed her out the door</B>

<BR><B>May the spirits be with you.......</B>

<P><B>By: mrripclaw@msn.com</B>

<P><B>Throughout out my childhood to the age of 21yrs I lived in a Victorian
town</B>
<BR><B>house in the town of Wrexham, North Wales, UK.&nbsp; I lived there
with my mother, who was</B>
<BR><B>divorced, my sister and my grandparents whose house it was.&nbsp;
It was a big five bedroom</B>
<BR><B>house with the original Victorian fittings such as pull cords for
bells to summon servants</B>
<BR><B>etc.&nbsp; I loved the house and the area and had a very sheltered
and idyllic upbringing.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>was a very old part of town quiet oozing with history and not far
from a country park</B>
<BR><B>with a mansion which also has alot of history.&nbsp; As you can
tell thats I loved the area and</B>
<BR><B>history.</B>
<BR><B>I am going tell you several stories I have encountered in my life.&nbsp;
As a</B>
<BR><B>child I was fascinated with history and loved the thought of ghosts.&nbsp;
My Grandmother was</B>
<BR><B>given a church blessing and that her house would be filled with
spirits due to the</B>
<BR><B>peacefulness and love in the home.</B>
<BR><B>My first sighting was when my sister and I came home from church
and we saw</B>
<BR><B>a boyin a flat cap in the front window of one of the the front bedrooms,
this happened</B>
<BR><B>to be my room.&nbsp; I was used to various children in our house
as my Grandma was one of</B>
<BR><B>those lovable people who used to look after everyones children.&nbsp;
I asked my Grandma who</B>
<BR><B>was here she said she was the only one.&nbsp; I went upstairs and
there was no one there.</B>
<BR><B>A few weeks later we were playing out the back around my grandads
garages.</B>
<BR><B>He owned an old Victorian Coach house which had coach wheels ladders
huge wood cutting</B>
<BR><B>saw and tools&nbsp; hanging from the wall.&nbsp; It was always locked
and we never really went in</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; Whilst we were playing we heard the voice of a man
shouting and the crying of a</B>
<BR><B>child.&nbsp; I ran to get me grandad.&nbsp; when we arrived my Grandad
shouted warningly threatening to</B>
<BR><B>call the police.&nbsp; He then opened up the garage an&nbsp; out
ran a scruffy boy in breeches</B>
<BR><B>cyring be followed by a man who can be described as looking like
Mr Bumble from Oliver</B>
<BR><B>Twist.&nbsp; They very quickly vanished.</B>
<BR><B>There is the ghost of an old lady who sleeps in my Grandparents
bed when its</B>
<BR><B>been freshly made, only my sister and my Grandmother have seen her.&nbsp;
There was an old man</B>
<BR><B>who lived with my Grandparents about 40years ago who regulaly would
be seen in his</B>
<BR><B>room always in a suit.&nbsp; I have seen him on several occassions
then he has turned looked at me</B>
<BR><B>then disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>I have never felt threatened by any of these experiences and have
learned to</B>
<BR><B>live with them.&nbsp; I have only have one bad experience which
will follow.</B>

<P><B>By: vijayuss@batelco.com.bh</B>

<P><B>hi my name is sarah. its funny you know ....i never believed in ghosts
till i experienced it my self&nbsp; .</B>
<BR><B>i live in bahrain. i was with a group of friends at school talking
about ghosts. thats when my friend rita had an idea to visit a haunted
building&nbsp; that exists nearby our school. it was less than half kilometre
away. we decided to go during our break time. everyone was scared except
me.i was confident&nbsp; that there would be no such thing called ghosts
and neither would that building be haunted.</B>
<BR><B>we walked and walked till we reached our destination.i was quite
short among all.two of my friends entered the building. i thought it would
be better to stay out. soon all of them entered. i was left behind.</B>
<BR><B>i waited for some time .suddenly i found foot prints next to my
right leg. when i turned around only one legs footprint was found. i laughed
thinking those girls must of played a trick on me.</B>
<BR><B>all four of my friends looked dissapointed when they came out.rita
asked me-sarah when did you come out?you ought to be more careful about
your jewellery(extending her hand i saw my diamond earring ).</B>
<BR><B>i put my hand over my right ear&nbsp; , my earring was not there.
scared i said- hey you guys when did you remove it? it was tight this afternoon.
the four looked at each other and smiled. vivian said- look is this some
kind of joke?besides why do we even want to remove your earring?</B>
<BR><B>they said that they found it over the stairs. but how could that
be ..i mean i didnt go in and besides it was there till they all went in.we
stood there talking until rita said that there was an oldman with only
one leg who lived in that building. that struck me. when we all were returning
back to our school i turned around and saw that an oldman was looking through
one of the windows&nbsp; at me and showing his toothless grin.</B>

<P><B>My Family Tree</B>

<P><B>By: mrripclaw@msn.com</B>

<P><B>When I was sixteen life was great it was fun and I was having a</B>
<BR><B>great time with friends, girl friends and family.&nbsp; My life</B>
<BR><B>changed the day after my 16th Birthday.&nbsp; I was walking home
from</B>
<BR><B>school after a drama production rehearsal so it was dark.&nbsp;
I know</B>
<BR><B>this sounds a bit cliche but I walked through the Graveyard of</B>
<BR><B>the town cemetry as it was a short cut.&nbsp; I did this every night</B>
<BR><B>unfazed, I even knew the caretaker.&nbsp; On this particular night
I</B>
<BR><B>walked past one of my family graves down a different path,</B>
<BR><B>convinced it was quicker and decided to time it for future</B>
<BR><B>reference.&nbsp; As I walked past my Great Great Grandfathers grave
I</B>
<BR><B>suddenly uneasy and yet defensive as if being watched.&nbsp; Being
an</B>
<BR><B>accomplished fighter as I studied Karate and Martial Arts and had</B>
<BR><B>a series of high ranking belts and lots of experience I prepared</B>
<BR><B>myself for attack.&nbsp; The Adrenalin was pumping and senses</B>
<BR><B>hightened but nothing was to prepare for what followed.</B>
<BR><B>I started to smell a very earthy smell as if from nowhere, it was</B>
<BR><B>musty and began to get stronger as approached my relatives</B>
<BR><B>grave.&nbsp; I saw the body of a man standing be a tree by my GG</B>
<BR><B>Grandfathers grave.&nbsp; I suddenly became rooted to the ground</B>
<BR><B>unable to move and then for the first time terror hit me.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>struggled and as I struggled the figure seamed to walk towards</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; As he got closer I began dripping in sweat and became
very</B>
<BR><B>hot, which is odd for mid December.&nbsp; As he approached I began
to</B>
<BR><B>hear him whistling a tune that I did not recognise.&nbsp; He was</B>
<BR><B>filthy in a really shabby top hat and tales and the smell of a</B>
<BR><B>decaying body(although at the time I did not know what that was)</B>
<BR><B>was sufficating me.&nbsp; He smiled at me and then said hello to
me</B>
<BR><B>and said that I am now of age.&nbsp; My heart was racing I thought
I</B>
<BR><B>was going to passout.&nbsp; He stretched forth his hand so touch
me,</B>
<BR><B>his hand was rotten and dirty.&nbsp; As soon as he touched me he
I</B>
<BR><B>fell to the ground.</B>
<BR><B>I started to see a bright light and began to pick out figures</B>
<BR><B>walking towards me.&nbsp; I felt loved and comforted.&nbsp; The
figures</B>
<BR><B>began to speak words of comfort to me and telling me my time was</B>
<BR><B>not yet.&nbsp; Then I began to smell that earthly smell and then</B>
<BR><B>amongst the figures appeared him the figures then started to</B>
<BR><B>retreat from him he got right upto me and said he will have what</B>
<BR><B>is his when the time is right then I awoke suddenly gasping for</B>
<BR><B>breath.&nbsp; The Graveyard was quiet as if nothing had gone on.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>then ran home.</B>
<BR><B>When I arrived home my mother and Grandparents were horrified to</B>
<BR><B>see my state.&nbsp; When they sat me down I tried to explain to
them</B>
<BR><B>what I had seen, but it had all come out jumbled.&nbsp; I evenually</B>
<BR><B>calmed down and told them what had happened my granddad and</B>
<BR><B>grandma look grief stricken and scared.&nbsp; My mum and I asked
why</B>
<BR><B>were they so upset.&nbsp; There answer did not seem to make much
sense</B>
<BR><B>to me as it is something that movies are made of.</B>
<BR><B>My Grandad then proceded to tell about his older brother who at</B>
<BR><B>the age of sixteen started to see the man I had described and</B>
<BR><B>that the figure haunted him for next four years.&nbsp; My Grandfather</B>
<BR><B>recieved a letter whilst fighting in WW2 in France telling him</B>
<BR><B>that his brother had been killed, although the circumstances were</B>
<BR><B>odd so they were not sure whether it was murder or suicide.&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was eventually forgotten as the war raged on.&nbsp; My Grandad never</B>
<BR><B>told me the circumstances in which his brother was found.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>same thing is reported to have happened to two other relatives in</B>
<BR><B>our family tree my uncle was missed, my Grandad suggested that it</B>
<BR><B>was due to his continual ill health.&nbsp; I was then told that
there</B>
<BR><B>was nothing I could do except go and see the Bishop of our</B>
<BR><B>church.</B>
<BR><B>I went to see the Bishop and my Grandfather had a lengthy</B>
<BR><B>discussion with before I was summoned into the room.&nbsp; I was
given</B>
<BR><B>a church blessing although I felt as it the Bishop did not</B>
<BR><B>beleive my Grandad or me.</B>
<BR><B>That night I lay in my bed reassured with a blessing and started</B>
<BR><B>a deep sleep.&nbsp; When I heard a scream from my mum.&nbsp; She
had come</B>
<BR><B>into the room a worried mother, at the disturbing news to check</B>
<BR><B>on her son only to see the man I described looking through the</B>
<BR><B>window towards my bed.&nbsp; She said he looked at her smiled an
evil</B>
<BR><B>smile and glided away out of sight.</B>
<BR><B>I stayed at my friends a few weeks later and was just about to go</B>
<BR><B>to be when I realised that I had not my lock my nifty fifty</B>
<BR><B>motorbike.&nbsp; I went over to the bike that was a in a dark corner</B>
<BR><B>of my friends drive and I suddenly smelt the earthy rotting smell</B>
<BR><B>of the man that seemed to have haunted my family.&nbsp; He seemed
to</B>
<BR><B>glide at my very agressively shouting at me that he would wait</B>
<BR><B>and that he would get me to.&nbsp; I was absolutely terrified.&nbsp;
After</B>
<BR><B>that visit I was ill with something for about a month, I was in</B>
<BR><B>hospital for about two weeks, as I just could not breath and I</B>
<BR><B>would halucinate and pass out.&nbsp; In that time he seem to be
in all</B>
<BR><B>my dreams no matter what they were so much so I did not want to</B>
<BR><B>go to sleep which made matters worse.&nbsp; This all seemed to come
a</B>
<BR><B>dramatic end when I stopped breathing for 3 minutes and my heart</B>
<BR><B>had stopped pumping aparently I was brought back from the edge.</B>
<BR><B>I have not seen him directly since although I know he is watching</B>
<BR><B>me as the smell still comes to my senses and I do begin to panic,</B>
<BR><B>I still see him in the corner of my eye and when I turn he is</B>
<BR><B>gone.</B>
<BR><B>I know how this sounds as I am not an illogical person I base</B>
<BR><B>everthing on facts there seems to no explanation for it at all.</B>
<BR><B>I currently work in close protection which is not a job for the</B>
<BR><B>light minded as everything is procedure procedure procedure and</B>
<BR><B>fact.&nbsp; My oldest is six and wants to be a policeman he is already</B>
<BR><B>half way to his first black belt in Karate and he seems to be</B>
<BR><B>very athletic, but there is a deep dark concern as I watch him</B>
<BR><B>growing up.</B>
<BR><B>There are good spirits and I have come into contact with them</B>
<BR><B>throughout my life and have had the one bad experience which has</B>
<BR><B>changed my life.&nbsp; This is true and not something to be triffled</B>
<BR><B>over it is serious and dangerous and I am sharing this to see</B>
<BR><B>whether anyone has an explanation or similar experience.</B>

<P><B>MY FIRST HAUNTED HOUSE</B>

<P><B>By:mizpriz@sbcglobal.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>My mom was single after I turned 9. I grew up in Stockton, California,
but we now live in Nevada. When I was 10 we moved into a small rental owned
by a friend of my grandma's. My sister Lara and I became afraid to sleep
in separate beds in the room we shared, so we'd both usually sleep on the
top of our bunkbed. One night I woke up feeling like something was watching
me. Sitting at the end of the bed was a glowing blue woman wearing an old-fashioned
dress. She had a horrible evil face with long fangs, and her clawed hands
were raised up like she was going to pounce on me! She was blocking the
ladder down to the floor, so I just jumped over the rail and ran to my
mom's room, leaving my poor sister still sleeping behind me. I woke my
mom and told her there was a ghost on my bed. She went into the room with
me and I wasn't surprised to see that my "Blue Lady" as I call her was
gone. We both said a prayer over the room, and then I was able to go back
to sleep. I didn't find out until years later that my mom has no memory
of getting out of her bed to pray with me. However, she says on the night
that I saw my ghost, she was unable to wake and felt like something was
sitting on her chest and suffocating her.</B>
<BR><B>Lara woke up screaming one night not long after that. I don't remember
anything except for her screaming and screaming, but she says that there
were two skeletons with glowing red and green eyes staring in at her from
the bedroom window that faces a dark and creepy alleyway that ran along
the middle of each street block and connected each street to the one beyond
it. None of us could see the skeletons, so my mom told us all to go back
to bed. Lara stayed awake the rest of the night and says that the skeletons
didn't fade away until dawn. At another time my mom was brushing my sister's
hair, and Lara looked down the hall into my mom's room and for just an
instant saw a woman sitting on the bed brushing her own hair.</B>
<BR><B>My mom knew the family who moved into that house after us. She ran
into the mother at the store one day and jokingly asked her if they'd had
any experiences with the ghost there. The mom said, "Oh yes!" She had two
daughters the same age as Lara and myself, who shared the same room we
did, and they were always having nightmares and were afraid to sleep by
themselves. And the mother would often wake up during the night to hear
loud footsteps going up and down the hall, only to find nobody there.</B>
<BR><B>THE DANGEROUS INTRUDER</B>
<BR><B>We lived in the haunted house for about a year, then we moved into
a big old house, the first two-story house we'd lived in since I was a
baby. It had lots of personality, all kinds of neat cabinets, doo dads,
window seats, a huge concrete porch for roller skating, a balcony, and
the garage was converted into a room that we made a playroom. It was like
a mansion to us. The house was almost 80 years old and we loved it. This
house didn't have a ghost, although my 6-year-old brother did wake up screaming
on Halloween night saying that there was a hand floating just above his
face. I'm posting this story mainly because of the "feeling" that my mom
and I got that I firmly believe was God saving our lives from a dangerous
criminal.</B>
<BR><B>My mom's room was downstairs, and there were two bedrooms upstairs.
I shared the room with my sister at the end of the hall, across the hall
from the bathroom. My brother's room was across the hall from the stairway.
The stairs were spiral, bare wood and enclosed, with a door at the bottom.</B>
<BR><B>One night my brother was spending the night at my grandma's. My
sister and I were having trouble getting to sleep. We were scared for some
reason. Lara heard a noise that sounded like a screen door slamming. She
thought it was in the house, but I assured her that it was probably the
neighbors next door. A minute later, we heard a hacking, smothered cough
in the bathroom. Someone was in there, and trying to cover up his noise!
Our dog's ears were up and she was staring out the bedroom door towards
the bathroom. We decided to get downstairs and tell our mom. We had to
pass the bathroom door on our way to the stairs. The door opened inward,
and it was half-open. Everything was dark and quiet. For some insane reason
I headed for the bathroom to turn on the light and peek inside. Then I
had this overwhelming, almost physical, feeling to get away from the bathroom
and get downstairs as quickly as possible. The light in the stairwell was
burnt out and it was pitch black. Our dog Peaches' claws made a huge racket
going down the steps. We were freaked out because it was so dark, we had
wanted to make no sound as we went down, and we were scared to death that
the intruder had already left the bathroom and was waiting for us in the
stairwell. But we didn't have much choice, we wanted to get to our mom
right away.</B>
<BR><B>Well, we got downstairs safely, and woke up our mom and told her
that someone was coughing in the bathroom upstairs. She told us it was
our imagination and to go back to bed. We insisted we were right, and Peaches
looked pretty freaked out too, so she got out of bed and went to the stairs
to see for herself. She started to go up, then had the same overwhelming
feeling to shut the stairwell door and lock it. She did and then called
the police, who came over and found nobody in the house. We slept with
our mom that night.</B>
<BR><B>A couple of weeks later we were cleaning upstairs and my brother
found a cigarette butt in the toilet. My mom was getting pretty freaked
out by then, and she asked me to see how easy it was to open the bathroom
window. It tilted right open, and was big enough for someone to fit through.
When I let go, it tilted shut with a noise that sounded just like a screen
door slamming.</B>
<BR><B>My mom called my grandma to tell her we needed a place to stay right
away, but my grandma was downplaying the whole thing and didn't want us
to move in. So my mom called a high school friend of hers who was a detective
and he came over that day. He listened to our stories and checked all the
locks on our doors and windows. He told us that the house was so old that
the locks were useless. They could be unlocked easily by just jiggling
the windows enough. He said that if our grandma wasn't going to let us
move in, we were all going to move into his house immediately until we
found somewhere else to stay. Well, my grandma didn't like that one bit,
so we all moved into her house that day. We left all our stuff in the house
and just took some clothes and toothbrushes.</B>
<BR><B>What we didn't know, but it came out over the next few years, was
that the guy had broken into our house several times while we lived there
and had been in our mom's room. He used a tissue with some kind of drug
in it to put over her face so she couldn't fully wake up. One night she
woke up to see him standing right over her. She thought she recognized
him as our next-door neighbor's son. He sometimes would be staring in the
kitchen window while my mom was making dinner. I don't know why we didn't
move out before we did, I think my mom was thinking it was a dream or something
because of the drug he used on her.</B>
<BR><B>After we moved out, my mom went back a couple of times during the
day to water the plants and pack stuff up. We went with her one time and
saw that the doorknob to the side door was smashed off, and the garage
door that led into the playroom was bent off its hinges.</B>
<BR><B>A few years after that, the neighbor's son was arrested for rape
and attempted murder, in a case(s) unrelated to ours.</B>
<BR><B>THE EVIL SPIRIT IN MY GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE</B>
<BR><B>There are several spots at my grandma's house that have inexplicably
creeped me out: the windows looking out of one of the back bedrooms, the
kitchen at night, the garage, the rear of the backyard, and the side of
the house next to the garage. I've asked my sister and she says the same
areas scare her too. I recently asked my 10-year-old daughter if there
was any spot at great-grandma's house that gave her a creepy feeling. She
replied "the backyard" without hesitation. When I was 15, I lived there
for the summer and did work for my grandpa cutting upholstery in the garage.
Most of the time things would seem fine, but every once in a while a dark,
creepy feeling would overcome me and I'd go running from the garage. About
two years ago my uncle walked into the garage and saw the ghost of a long-deceased
neighbor standing there, who looked startled and then faded away. I don't
think he was the evil spirit though.</B>
<BR><B>Right after that, my family was visiting my grandparents and I was
watching TV in an old 5th-wheel that they keep at the side of their house.
It was just starting to get dark and the TV reception was getting bad,
so I left to go back into the house. Everything seemed fine when I left
the 5th-wheel. It was a beautiful early-summer evening. I headed up the
side of the house towards the back gate. Suddenly a dark feeling and an
intense dread overcame me. I couldn't see anything different, but it was
like a smothering black cloud had been pulled over my mind. I couldn't
make myself take one step further towards the back gate; although it was
closer to the house that way, the evil was coming from there. So I turned
and ran as fast as I could around the side of the house and past the garage
to the front lawn. The evil feeling disappeared as soon as I passed the
front of the garage, but I kept running until I got to the front door.
It was locked and I repeatedly rang the doorbell. My grandma answered,
took one look at me, and said, "What, did you see the ghost in the garage?"</B>
<BR><B>Yesterday I asked my mom yet again about that house. She always
answers, "Yes, there's an evil spirit there, but the only thing anyone
ever saw was the ghost of Mr. Adams in the garage." This time I pressed,
"But why is the backyard is so scary, the garage, the back gate, the side
of the house..." She interrupted with, "Yep, yep!" But she couldn't answer
my questions, because she doesn't know anything more than I do about it.
My husband, who is not sensitive to scary places, told me that at one time
he also felt that feeling of dread just outside the 5th-wheel near the
back gate; he too turned tail and ran around the side of the house and
went in by the front. We're going to visit them soon, but I don't want
to spend the night there anymore. Every time we do, I end up bickering
cruelly with my husband about petty things that we'd normally not fret
about. It puts my mom and sister in foul moods too. I think that whatever
is in that house has a negative effect on us, but it doesn't seem to affect
my grandma's always cheerful mood. She must be used to it.</B>
<BR><B>THE PET CEMETARY</B>
<BR><B>When I was 14, I went on a week's vacation during the summer to
Lake Tahoe with my best friend in junior high school. We stayed at a cool
A-frame skiing cottage near the woods. We loved the place, but the downstairs
sitting room was always very cold, and we didn't like to be down there
alone. One night one of us, either my friend or I (can't remember), woke
to what sounded like pots and pans crashing around downstairs. I only remember
talking about it the next day, but not who actually heard it.</B>
<BR><B>What I *do* remember was the hike my friend and I took in the woods
one day. We got a little ways up the trail and came upon a small pet cemetary
in a clearing. Many of the grave markers had laminated photos and stories
of the cats and dogs buried there. We stopped for a few minutes and read
some of them. We thought it was touching and sweet. But just as we were
leaving to continue our hike, we both got an unsettling, creepy feeling.
We joked it off and went on up the trail. A few minutes later the day was
starting to get hot and we were tiring, so we turned back around and had
quite forgotten about the cemetary until we came upon it again. We noticed
with horror that in our absence two of the graves had been dug up! They
had belonged to two Doberman pinschers from the same family. They were
big graves, about 3 feet deep had been dug out of each, and there were
no bodies inside. We had only been gone from the cemetary about 10 minutes!
We were up in the mountains and there was no way to drive a vehicle among
the hills and trees. It was very scary thinking that some freaky grave-robber
could have been hiding in the woods while we were there, and in an impossible
amount of time had been able to dig out two big graves and take off with
the bodies! We ran the rest of the way back to the cabin.</B>
<BR><B>THE CARSON RIVER AND THE RIVER BABIES</B>
<BR><B>A few years ago I lived in Carson City, Nevada. The Carson River
and a nearby place called the American Flats are full of creepy tales about
cult sacrifices, Indian ritual grounds, and teenagers getting killed by
falling down abandoned mine shafts. I've only been to the American Flats
once, with my ex-husband. A lot of kids go there to shoot guns at abandoned
cars and old mine buildings. It's an ugly place and has a definite dark
feeling even in the middle of the day. One time my ex, his brother, and
I took innertubes and floated down the river. It was shallow, muddy, and
sluggish in the middle of the summer, so we had to paddle most of the way.
I was not having a good time. The same dark feeling at the American Flats
hovered over the river and was stronger in some places than others. We
got to one part where the river widened into a deeper pool. Broken mining
walls and dams and twisted rusty cables tumbled over the banks and into
the water. The water itself was muddy and completely opaque, but where
it got deep the bathwater warm suddenly turned cold. I was getting horrible
feelings that there were bodies under my feet, and I wanted to get my legs
up out of the water, to get my whole body out of the water and sit on top
of my innertube. My ex and his brother just wanted to float along, but
I panicked and paddled away from there as quickly as I could. It got better
once I was away from that pool, but I have never been back since.</B>
<BR><B>My brother was camping at the Carson River with some friends a few
years ago. He woke during the night and heard babies crying some ways up
the river. He woke his friends, but the crying stopped. He later heard
about the legend of the River Babies, which I can't completely remember,
but they say babies were drowned there over a hundred years ago and people
sometimes hear babies crying at night.</B>
<BR><B>PARK LANE MALL</B>
<BR><B>At one time I lived with my sister in a condo near a small mall
in Reno, Nevada, called the Park Lane Mall. There is a lower level with
some shops, a diner, and a hair salon, accessible by a big staircase. For
some reason I was always scared to go down there, I'd always stop at the
top of the stairs. Well, one time I decided to stop wimping out for stupid
reasons and I went downstairs. There was a definite creepy feeling down
there. I walked around a bit, and when I got close to the women's restroom
I got very creeped out and I hurried back upstairs as quickly as possible.</B>
<BR><B>Just a few night ago I was going through this web site, searching
for haunted places by state, hoping to find something on that house in
Stockton with the Blue Lady ghost. I didn't find anything on that, but
I was clicking through Nevada stories when I saw Reno - Park Lane Mall.
I read and found out that in the 70s a woman was murdered in the downstairs
restroom and supposedly the whole lower level is haunted. It was then that
I finally realized I must be sensitive to haunted places. I'll listen to
my inner voice from now on, now that I have plenty of experience of what
it feels like to by near an evil presense.</B>
<BR><B>I've also had a few episodes of what they call "Sleep Paralysis,"
which is one of the most terrifying experiences that's ever happened to
me. I'll be sleeping, then I am jolted awake by a sense of evil, and it
usually looks like a dark shadow has come into the room. I feel like a
demon or Satan himself is standing just beyond my sight. Then I'll feel
unable to breathe, like something is sitting on my chest. That must have
been what my mom experienced the night that I saw the Blue Lady. At these
times I've tried to pray, but it even feels like my mind is paralyzed and
I can't find the words. I am a strong Christian and I think that in the
end, even though I can't pray, my faith drives the evil spirit away. The
last time this happened was 6 years ago in an apartment my husband and
I lived in before we bought our current house. I was sleeping in the living
room because my husband snores loud enough to wake the dead - pun intended!
I woke to the usual feeling of darkness and dread, but this time I wasn't
facing th ceiling. I could see the living room floor clearly and there
was a red glow spreading out from the middle. In the center of this glow,
it looked like a head and shoulders were pushing up out of the floor! I
was scared to death, but then a fog went into my mind and I fell asleep.
The next morning I felt fine, and I've never experienced Sleep Paralysis
again. *knock on wood* But since for most people, including me, this is
known to happen mostly when you're sleeping on your back, I avoid sleeping
on my back at all times.</B>
<BR><B>THE GRIM REAPER</B>
<BR><B>This is my last story, I promise! This actually happened to my oldest,
in our current house, when she was 8. She woke up to use the bathroom and
saw what she describes as the black silhouette of the grim reaper standing
in the hallway, with a sharp scythe that went all the way up to the ceiling.
She says she had to walk through him to get back to her room (who knows
why she didn't just scream?), and as she rushed by, the air turned freezing
cold in the spot he was standing in. That's the only time anything like
this has happened in this house, and I myself have never felt or seen anything
evil or out of the ordinary here. Let's hope that was just a one-time thing!
Right now as I type, our house is warm and peaceful, and there are no bad
feelings - besides my 5-year-old daughter, who is shaking my desk right
now because she wants to play a computer game! Hee hee. Thanks for listening.</B>

<P><B>Morning Visitor</B>

<P><B>By: DENNIS CHAMBERLAIN@CABLEONE.NET</B>

<P><B>My house in Duncan, Oklahoma is haunted.&nbsp; Im 16 years old.&nbsp;
My parents bought a old house where an old lady use to live. Her daughter
moved her to a nursing home. Then we bought the house. When we moved in
we found old bank notes, and school books, calendars and newspapers from
back in the 1930s.&nbsp; We have lived here for almost three years now.
One night my family went to bed and my little brother spent the night at
my oldest sisters house. I stayed up to play my ps2. It was about three
in the morning and I was getting sleepy. I thought I saw something from
the corner of my eye . It looked like the shadowy figure of a woman. I
didnt think anything of it cause I was tired. I thought my eyes were playing
tricks on me cause it was so late. I then went to my room to watch tv.
when I heard a noise like plastic bags being shook around. I looked towards
my bed where the noise was coming from. I saw a glowing orb on my bed.
It moved from my bed which was the bottom bunk to the top bunk. I then
quickly left the room and shut the door and went to my parents bedroom
door and I started to bang on the door. The orb followed me out of my room&nbsp;
through the kitchen and then through the dining room. Then it vanished.
when my mom woke up I was at her bedroom door. I could hardly speak. All
i could do is cry. I finally managed to tell her I had saw something. She
thought I saw someone peeking in the windows. she woke my dad up and he
started to look around the house and yard. nothing was there. I described
what I had saw to my mom. We were standing in the dining room and we both
felt a cold chill. I was so scared I slept in my parents room on the floor
beside their bed. My mom told me it was probably the old woman that use
to live here just checking on her house. we were starting to remodel the
house and we had tore out the carpet. We found old wooden floors and old
linolium. The house probably looked like it did when she lived in it back
in the 1930s.&nbsp; She must have been satisfied that it was being taken
care of because she hasnt come back since.&nbsp; We later learned she had
died a few months earlier. this really is a true story. thank you</B>

<P><B>What Happened to my Father before He Died</B>

<P><B>By: wendy.taylor@fdl-law.co.uk</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I dont know if this is of interest to anyone, but I remembered
it whilst reading some of the accounts on your website.</B>
<BR><B>My father became ill in March 1983 and had been bedridden for several
days.</B>
<BR><B>I was 14 at the time and my brother, Robert, was 26.</B>
<BR><B>When I got home from school and Robert got home from work our father
told us about an experience he had had that day.</B>
<BR><B>He said that he awoke to find his father and his brother, who were
both dead, sitting on his bed.&nbsp; One of them said to him You know
were coming for you soon dont you?.</B>
<BR><B>My father was disabled, having had his right leg amputated some
eight years previously and he said What about my leg?.&nbsp; Their reply
was You dont have to worry about that where we are going.</B>
<BR><B>My brother and I just laughed it off  I suppose you never really
believe that your dad is going to die, especially at 57.</B>
<BR><B>Sadly, I never had a close relationship with my father.&nbsp; My
parents had me when they were both in their forties and my brother and
sister were a lot older, 12 and 8 years respectively.&nbsp; After I was
born my mother suffered from post natal depression.&nbsp; I was born in
December 1968 and I suppose not a great deal was known about it then.&nbsp;
My father was the kind of person who would have said pull yourself together
woman and not been very sympathetic.&nbsp; My mum used to leave and then
come back on a frequent basis and she eventually left for good to live
on her own when I was 12.&nbsp; There was never another man involved and
they were still married when my father died.&nbsp; I always felt my family
blamed me for what had happened, rightly or wrongly, and I still do.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, Ive gone slightly off track here.&nbsp; I just wanted to
explain what sort of a man my father was.&nbsp; He never showed any affection
and I suppose could be classed as a cold person.&nbsp; He was a mans man,
an ex Royal Marine, who had been in active service.&nbsp; If anyone had
told him about seeing their dead relatives he would have been the first
person to laugh it off.</B>
<BR><B>That was the point.&nbsp; My dad looked very worried so it was real
enough to him to make him frightened.&nbsp; He turned to my brother and
said Im dying Robert.&nbsp; He was very serious and convinced he was
going to die.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say my father did die a few days later.&nbsp; I cant
remember the exact timescale from his dead relatives visiting him as it
was such a long time ago but it was within days.&nbsp; He died on the morning
of the 18th March 1983.</B>

<P><B>The Naughty Boy</B>

<P><B>By: wendy.taylor@fdl-law.co.uk</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>This is a story that was told to me by the girl it happened to and
I have no reason to believe she is making it up.&nbsp; A lot of it was
corroborated by her mother who, when she was a child, took her to see various
psychologists due to what she claimed she was experiencing.</B>
<BR><B>During this time, Angelas mum was one day discussing this with
one of her friends as she was very worried about what was going on.&nbsp;
The friends advice was to leave her alone and let her enjoy it while
it lasts.&nbsp; She obviously believed that Angela was a sensitive.</B>
<BR><B>I met Angela (I wont use her real name) when I moved my horse to
a new stables in 2001.&nbsp; She used to see to my horse in the mornings
for me in the winter because I worked full time and it was difficult for
me.</B>
<BR><B>As time went by we became very friendly, despite the age difference
(her being 13 and me being 32 at the time).&nbsp; She was very mature for
her age and did not seem the sort to make things up or tell tales.&nbsp;
Not only did she look after her own horse but she used to do jobs for other
people as well.</B>
<BR><B>One day we got on the topic of ghosts and I told her that I had
seen a ghost myself.&nbsp; After this she seemed to open up to me and began
telling me about the strange things she had witnessed.&nbsp; I think she
was very wary of telling people because of her mum taking her to see various
doctors because she thought she was delusional.</B>
<BR><B>It started when her grandfather died when she was very young (about
8 years old).&nbsp; She was very close to her granddad and after he died
she said he used to come and visit her when she was in bed at night.&nbsp;
On one occasion he elevated her over her bed and kissed her.&nbsp; She
says this went on for a while and then one day it just stopped.</B>
<BR><B>Another occurrence that was witnessed by both Angela and her mother
was that they would be in the house and they would smell the grandfathers
aftershave.&nbsp; He used a particular aftershave and it had a very distinctive
smell.&nbsp; No-one else was in the house at the time so it could not have
been someone else using the same product.</B>
<BR><B>Angela also used to see a lady in the house she lived in previously.&nbsp;
From the description she gave she appeared to be dressed in Victorian clothes
(which she described as a rose/burgundy coloured dress with creases in
it.&nbsp; I took this to mean the skirt was rouched).&nbsp; This lady was
aware of Angela because she used to smile at her.&nbsp; Apparently, she
only ever appeared when Angelas parents were out for the evening.&nbsp;
Again, this stopped after a while.</B>
<BR><B>There was also an occasion when she was out playing in the garden
of her former house with one of her friends.&nbsp; They both noticed the
figure of a young girl who appeared to be playing some kind of jumping
game.&nbsp; She was dressed in old fashioned clothes and appeared as
if she was partially buried in the path  they could not see her lower
legs.</B>
<BR><B>Angela told me that she was not seeing as many things as she was
getting older and the last experience she had was this.</B>
<BR><B>There was a boy at her school who had died in a tragic accident.&nbsp;
She did not know the boy very well as he was in the year above her, but
she was friendly with his sister.&nbsp; During the Christmas holidays this
boy (I dont think she mentioned his name) was out sledging.&nbsp; It was
a steep hill with a road at the bottom of it.&nbsp; He sled down the hill
but was unable to stop at the bottom so he went into the road and was hit
by a car.&nbsp; Needless to say, he died as a result.</B>
<BR><B>His parents arranged to have a memorial bench bearing a plaque placed
in the school grounds and there was a special assembly attended by the
boys family on the day the bench was unveiled.</B>
<BR><B>That night, Angela was sat in her bed reading.&nbsp; All of a sudden
her bedroom light kept being switched on and off.&nbsp; She assumed this
was her younger sister messing around and told her to stop it but it continued.&nbsp;
Angela had had enough by this time so she chased what she thought was her
younger sister down the landing.&nbsp; The lights were off at the time
but she could see a figure running away from her.&nbsp; Just as the figure
got to the end of the landing, it turned around, pulled a scary face and
ran towards her.&nbsp; This was when Angela realised it was the boy from
her school.&nbsp; He was very distinctive looking as he had bright red
hair.</B>
<BR><B>Angelas parents were downstairs in the living room and she bolted
down the stairs.&nbsp; She described to me that she was in so much of a
hurry that she nearly fell down the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>There is no doubt in my mind that what she says is genuine.&nbsp;
Despite her age she is very mature and perceptive.&nbsp; But more than
this its the way she describes things.&nbsp; Regarding this particular
incident she said I bet he (the ghost) got into trouble with the people
in charge of ghosts for what he did (namely pulling a face and running
towards her, scaring her so much that she almost had an accident on the
stairs).&nbsp; Its like when she was describing what the Victorian lady
was wearing  she found it hard describing the exact shade of her dress
but said it was a kind of rose/burgundy colour and had creases in it.&nbsp;
She did not know what rouched meant.</B>
<BR><B>Im sure Angela would not mind me sending this to your site  I
think she would be relieved that someone took her seriously and understood
what she had been through.</B>

<P><B>The Dead Brother</B>

<P><B>By: wendy.taylor@fdl-law.co.uk</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In June 1990 myself and my sister, Penny, went to stay with her
friend, John, for the weekend in Barnoldswick, Lancashire.</B>
<BR><B>He came to collect us at the coach station on the Friday night and
took us back to his mothers house, a large three storey Victorian terrace.</B>
<BR><B>After a hearty meal prepared by his mother, we went out to meet
his friends.&nbsp; After an evening in the local pubs we went back to the
house at about midnight.&nbsp; We had a cup of coffee and sat chatting
downstairs until about 1:00 a.m.</B>
<BR><B>We were given the choice of sleeping on the second floor or in the
attic room.&nbsp; Penny wanted to sleep on the second floor so I opted
for the attic room.&nbsp; It had no window in it, just a skylight.&nbsp;
By this time it was pitch black and so when the light was switched off
there was no light in the room whatsoever.&nbsp; You could not see your
hand in front of you.</B>
<BR><B>I was very tired and feel asleep almost immediately.&nbsp; All of
a sudden I remember waking up.&nbsp; It was not like when you normally
wake up and feel a bit groggy.&nbsp; I was wide awake.&nbsp; I found this
strange in itself as I am bog-eyed when I first wake up.&nbsp; I was lying
on my side (as I usually do) and had my head resting on my left arm.&nbsp;
I looked up and saw a young lad bent over the bed staring at me.&nbsp;
I got the impression he was in his late teens and had curly hair.&nbsp;
He was standing on the left side of the bed (the bed was against a wall
to the right) and was glaring into my face.&nbsp; The feeling I got was
of curiosity, almost like who are you?.&nbsp; He was not glowing but
was like a chalky white image.&nbsp; I was so startled that I jerked back
and banged my head on the wall.&nbsp; I did not know whether to make a
run for the door or stay where I was.&nbsp; I decided to stay where I was.&nbsp;
After a few moments the figure faded away.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning Penny asked me how I had slept.&nbsp; I remember
saying to her there was a young lad in my room last night.&nbsp; She
just laughed and said you should have sent him down to me.&nbsp; I told
her what had happened and made her promise not to say anything to anyone.</B>
<BR><B>The Saturday night passed without event.&nbsp; On the Sunday Johns
mum took us in the back room (a room just used for guests and special occasions
 a very old fashioned tradition) and was showing us some family photographs.&nbsp;
There was a photo of all her children together.&nbsp; Penny pointed to
one and asked who it was.&nbsp; John explained that it was his brother,
Simon.&nbsp; Penny asked where he lived as John had never mentioned him
before.&nbsp; John explained that his brother was dead.&nbsp; He got killed
on his 17th birthday in a motorcycle accident.&nbsp; His parents had got
him a motorbike for his birthday.&nbsp; He was out riding it, took a corner
too wide and was hit by a truck&nbsp; coming in the opposite direction.&nbsp;
He died at the scene.</B>
<BR><B>The impression I got of the figure in the attic room was of a lad
in his late teens.&nbsp; I knew nothing of Johns dead brother at that
time and can only assume it was Simon that I saw.</B>
<BR><B>The strange thing was that when Simon was killed they were living
in a farmhouse and not at their present address.&nbsp; However, they do
say that ghosts can move with the living.</B>
<BR><B>I confirm that the above is a true account of the experience I had.</B>
<BR><B>I think I must be one of those people they call sensitive.&nbsp;
I used to live in a flat which had a presence in it and Ive had three
premonitions.&nbsp; I can also tell whether there has been a lot of happiness
or sadness in a residence, although some are neutral.</B>
<BR><B>One of my friends thinks its because my fathers, fathers mother
was a North American Indian!&nbsp; Strangely enough I own a coloured (paint)
horse, a German Shepherd dog (similar to a wolf) and my favourite stone
is amethyst, which comes from Canada (I have this stone in my engagement
ring).&nbsp; Just a coincidence?</B>

<BR><B>The Austin High School Ghost</B>

<P><B>By:n2uw2000@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Hi,my name is Ted Strong,I found your site while</B>
<BR><B>surfing the web for a former hotel in Madison Indiana,</B>
<BR><B>I couldn't find the one I was looking for but found</B>
<BR><B>something that was even stranger.It was about the</B>
<BR><B>ghost of Austin High School. This was the first time I</B>
<BR><B>had heard about the haunting as I know who the ghost</B>
<BR><B>is and what happened to her. Her name is Betty Myers</B>
<BR><B>she was a Spanish and English teacher, I had her as an</B>
<BR><B>English teacher. We often butted heads as I guess her</B>
<BR><B>being sort of an authority figure and me being a</B>
<BR><B>rebelious teenager. But we agreed one one thing we</B>
<BR><B>shared a love of The Beatles' music and we talked</B>
<BR><B>about it quite often. Also she was my neighbor for a</B>
<BR><B>while before her death in 1978 or 79,and I was shocked</B>
<BR><B>and sad at hearing she had died.&nbsp; But anyway, we heard</B>
<BR><B>she was in a car accident after leaving a party, but I</B>
<BR><B>dont'know too many details other than she was</B>
<BR><B>decapitated. If she is haunting the school I think if</B>
<BR><B>someone as to play some Beatles music late at night in</B>
<BR><B>the hallway where her classroom was it might stir her</B>
<BR><B>up, but you never know. I hope this information is</B>
<BR><B>helpful and you can contact me any time if you have</B>
<BR><B>any questions or if I can help with any research on</B>
<BR><B>the haunting.</B>

<P><B>Strange and Scary Experience</B>

<P><B>By: domeano@ev1.net</B>

<P><B>When I was 16 my family moved into this house in Santa Fe, TX with
my mom's new boyfriend. One night, shortly after moving in, my mom, my
sister, and brother, and the boyfriend went out to get something. My youngest
sister and I were left at home. I was unpcking things in the kitchen and
my sister was playing the nintendo 64 thing in the front bedroom. While
I was unpacking I heard someone laughing. It scared me at first but I told
myself my sister was having fun so I went to see what she was laughing
at. She said that she hadn't laughed. I went to finish up in the kitchen
and I heared something fall in the back room and something banging around.
I ran in to the room where my sister was and asked if she heard that. She
was confused so I told her what was going on. Then I thought maybe my mom
and brother were playing a prank on us so we opened the front door and
called their names and nobody was around. I went to go shut the dooor and
someone tried to push it open. Both my sister and I finally pushed the
door shut and had our backs against it and it was shaking and almost came
open a few times because it really felt like someone was trying to kick
it open. Finally it stopped and after a while we took our back off the
door to lock it and then stood with our backs against it looking both ways
to make sure nothing was comming. We were both crying and my sister was
convinced that this was happening because she was misbehaving my mother
a lot around that time. We waited until my mom got home before we left
the door. We told her what happened and I think she believed us because
we were both so scared and shaken and you can't get that scared over nothing.
We had a lot of other strange things happen in that house. My mother would
come running out of her room scaeming at night over what she says were
bad dreams and one night I woke up and there was this black staic like
stuff surrounding me, I couldn't move or scream and finally when it was
gone I ran to my mother's room. My sisters also said how they would see
things and one night my youngest sister looked into the face of her pooh
bear and she saw a strange face smiling at her. She never wanted to sleep
with it again.</B>

<P><B>The Bridge</B>

<P><B>By: DirrtyBluEyes@aol.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Joppa - Jericho Covered Bridge - This bridge is the last covered
bridge standing in Harford County, built in the early 1800's. Legend has
it that several lynching occurred at this bridge during and after the Civil
War, in which the captured people were hung from the upper rafters, sometimes
many at a time. If you stop your car on the narrow bridge late at night,
and look in your rear view mirrors, the image of a swinging body can be
seen.</B>
<BR><B>This is the story my friends and I checked out. We went late at
night during winter, it was November/December if I remember right of 03,
this past year. 1st my friend went without me and told me how there jeep
wouldn't move off a 2nd bridge. They found this bridge while looking for
the one above, this was an old iron bridge big enough for one car. I'm
not sure of the name of it, but it was over the falls and was fairly old.
They stopped on the bridge and when my friend tried to drive again his
jeep wouldn't start! Then if you look down to your right to the river you
can see what appears to be a soldier hunched over on a horse, the horse
looks back at you and you can see his eyes and he contiues to walk. If
you keep drivin and look to the left into the fields you will notice someone
walking along. They are dressed in what I guess could be civil war era
clothing. The whole time you see numerous orbs and what not. Then we contiued
to look for the Covered Bridge and found it. On the way to the bridge you
could hear whispers in the woods and see what looked like cigerttes bein
lite. Once again you saw plenty of orbs. Remember this is late at night
in a&nbsp; very off the road area without street lights and lamps. During
one point I glanced out my window and saw a face right next to my car window!
Needless to say it scared the crap out of me. Then we reached the bridge
and drove through, turned off the lights and checked to see if we could
see anything and we could! We actually saw 2 bodies, perhaps 3 hanging.
From under the bridge we could see a light that appeared out of nowhere.
Each time we went through we saw the bodies and all you see really are
the legs, the lower half. If you try to look for more you simply won't
see anything.&nbsp; My friends have gone back numerous times and on the
last trip after they did the bridge, someone appeared behind the car and
was chasing them. It just seemed to be a faceless being. I don't know what
else you would call it.</B>
<BR><B>I hope you find this story interesting. Everything seems to be more
"awake" during a cold night.</B>

<P><B>Strange Expieriences in England</B>

<P><B>By: GeorgeMeigh@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have a few "strange" experiences but not all have happened to
me so here goes</B>
<BR><B>I awoke one night at around 3:30am and realised that i couldn't
move at all. My eyes felt as though they were glued shut and my body was
like concrete stuck to the bed. I felt as though i was flat and my hands
were across my chest. for a while I was stuck like that. Then slowly, my
breathing deepened and became so loud that I thought my parents could hear
me in the next room, as I breathed in, I felt as though I was rising and
as I breathed out I felt as I was lowering back to the bed. I managed to
get my lips to move and I cursed the thing that was doing this to me but
no sound came out and I couldn't stop breathing so heavily. I then awoke
properly and was able to move but I didn't sleep at all for the rest of
the night.</B>
<BR><B>Another story was when my grandma and auntie went to Alton Towers
for the day. (I know it sounds strange but my cousin does adverts,my grandma
and auntie have to go and be escorts). This particular day they were advertising
the new water park at Alton Towers and had to wait until everone was home
before they could set off.&nbsp; This just happened to be at around 8ish
and as it was winter the nights were darker quicker. So they got in my
grandmas car and drove away following the arrows that are clearly marked
around the theme park, talking about how they needed to be home for the
last 15mins of Eastenders. They had been in the car for no less than 3
mins when they realised that the arrows had dissapeared and they were driving
up the drive of a castle with great big gargoyles (sp?) around it. As soon
as they had realised it, a fog fell right in front of them, not gradually
but it just shot down in front of them. After that a feeling that all my
Grandma can explain as pure fear came upon them both and none of them dared
speak but after they had sat petrified for many minutes, my auntie spoke
"whatever is it?" she asked and as soon as my grandma knew she could feel
it too her fear doubled. Now, my auntie is a very very strong catholic
as they have lived in Ireland nearly all their lives and going to church
an awful lot so she was praying so hard. My grandma just put her foot down
and went straight through the fog and after a while the arrows were clear
again and everything was normal but they still didnt speak until they got
into the village of Alton.</B>
<BR><B>My mum has also heard stories at work and one of them is of a man
she knows who got a new job in the mines. He went down on his first night
and realised that someone else was working with him and so they got talking.
The next morning he went to his new boss and asked him why he needed another
man to work there and the boss replied because there was no-one else to
do so as if it were a stupid question. He explained that he had been talking
to someone all night and described what he looked like. The bosses face
went white as he heard this because apparently a family man of that description
had died down the mines earlier that year.</B>
<BR><B>The last story was told to me by my friend,&nbsp; who went to her
friends house in Leek, Staffordshire, England. They had not been drinking
that much because when I suggested if it was the drink she said it couldnt
have been because they hadnt had much. It was around 4 and danni had woken
up feeling freezing and a little sick. She looked up to her friends bed
and saw a figure sitting with its hands resting on its face. She later
told her friend who said it was probably her grandma who apparently regularly
visited them.</B>
<BR><B>My other friend,&nbsp; her da died when she was only 10 and she
had always been very close to him as had her sisters. One night when her
ma was out and her and her oldest sister were left in the house, Her sister
went into the kitchen and came back in with a really shocked face on her
and my friend was so worried and couldnt get her to talk so she rang her
mum who came home early and tried to make her talk. Eventually she murmered
something about her father being in the kitchen with her and he meant no
harm. She was terrified even though he was a nice spirit and goes white
whenever anyone brings it up.</B>

<BR><B>That's not Mom!</B>

<P><B>By:fradee_katt@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I guess I should mention first, that I am a skeptic, but I have no
explanation for what happened. I've always had this thing about people
being in the room or watching me when I sleep, it just wakes me right up.
Well one night I was awakened by this feeling of something being in the
room. I had always read in a paranormal situation where people describe
things as being blacker that black. Well I opened my eyes and there was
a blacker than the darkness; figure in the room, it seemed to be examining
my humidifier. I thought it was my Mother, who was visiting and I called
out to her. The shape seemed surprised that I was seeing it. I realised
quickly enough, it wasn't my Mom. I turned on my bedside lamp and whatever
was there was gone. I wasn't scared by this. I was more curious than anything
else. Thank you for letting me tell my story.</B>

<P><B>My Dead Father</B>

<P><B>By: JagCheergurl3@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>When I was about 2 1/2 years old, my father killed himself on Christmas
Eve. I can still remember the funeral and how my mom was crying. Now everytime
I think about him I cry. I really don't know why, but tears always come
down my face and I can't help it. Well, about in the next year, when I
turned three, my father came back. I just now figured out that my dad used
to come back from heaven, teach me songs, and talk to me. I would sometimes
be singing a new song, (I was only three years old, and my grandma was
at work so no one really taught me any songs at that time.) and my mom
would ask me who taught me the song, everytime, I would say, daddy. My
mom said that sometimes, I would stare at walls and start laughing. I would
be talking to them and singing sometimes. In the car, I would be in my
car seat and I would be talking to the back of my seat. My mom would sometimes
wake up and see a shadow of a man in front of her bed. She would sometimes
say, not now, or leave me alone and he would go away. All of this my mom
told me is really weird. While I am writing my story, I feel that my dad
is watching over me now. Like he is telling me not to be scared and not
to cry, because as I said, when I start to think about him, tears start
to build up, but I don't nessisarily start to cry. I am 12 years old writing
this and it is all coming back to me. I can't remeber any of the songs
he taught me, but I still think about him.</B>

<P><B>Lonely Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: faries007@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is Alicia and i have a true story of what happened to
me. About four years ago and husband and i lived in a townhouse in southern
Virginia. He worked on the road alot and was way for home for weeks at
a time. I have always been scared to stay by myself, but i soon got over
it, when i learned i had a "friend". One night after we just moved in,
as i lay in bed alone (door locked-of course) i couldn't fall asleep. It
was a new place and was a little nervous( ok alot nervous) as i was laying
there awake, the door to room made a creeping noise(remember the door was
locked) i think i screamed but it was a silent one. A coldness came beside
me and i felt someone touch me. I was frozen with fear, i jumped up quickly
and turned on the bedroom and&nbsp; as i did i voice (man's) as clear as
day said "it's alright" it sounds like it was in the room. I ran down stairs
and turned every light on in the house. But after that night for some reasons
i can not explain, i felt safe there. A year later we were getting ready
to move. (I had told my husband of what he happened) As we laid in bed
the the night before we left ( are boxes packed up down stai ) we heard
bagging . We stayed up quietly and listened. It would stop and go. then
we felt a cold rush come in are bedroom. what happened next you could not
even imagine. again a loud voice SCREAMED" don't go, please!" Then the
cold left the room. " "he" went down stairs you could hear our boxes being
moved, thrown, closet and bathroom doors where being slammed as he scream
"no" repeatably. It was so loud our neighbors called 911. This went on
for about 5 mins, my husband got up and went down stairs and yelled, "we
are leaving, we having too! now stop it!" It stopped, you can imagine how
hard it was to explain to the cops my husband wasn't beating me up. When
i started to close the door to lock up the next day, i hear "him" say "please"&nbsp;
For some reason i started to cry, a deep sadness came over me. I spoke
with a neighbor weeks later and she said for a few nights after we moved
out, she could hear someone crying in our house. I often think of the friendly
ghost, i think he just wanted company and didn't want to be alone like
me. Just thought i would share. Thanks.</B>

<P><B>Hello,my name is Christina. I am a young mother of two and married
to an Army man. We had just moved to this small town so that my husband
could be closer to where he was stationed.My young son (he was 4) and I
were watching T.V. on the couch. My husband had gone to bed early and I
was a night owl. My son had woken up and came to snuggle with me on the
couch and watch T.V. My husbands' and my room was down at the very end
of the long hallway.There were no lights on except the T.V. light. I saw
something move in the hallway out of the corner of my eye. I saw it was
my husband dressed in his uniform, or so I thought.I asked"honey,what are
you doing up and dressed?",then my son looked and said"daddy,what are you
doing up?" No answer. I sat up and looked at the figure closer,realizing
it was not my husband at all but a man in uniform. It looked like a soldier
in one of those old movies. I got real scared. My son did as well. Then
he was gone just like that.I went down the hall and my husband was sleeping
soundly and snoring loudly as usual and sleeping in the nude as he always
did. I was afraid to be alone nights after that. I came to find out later
that this town was built right over an old military place</B>

<BR><B>Buda Texas</B>

<P><B>By:rachrhs7@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>One day my boyfriend, his bestfriend and myself decided to go fishing.
We knew of this wooded area in Buda Texas that my boyfriend had been to
once before.&nbsp; When we got into the woods the walk to the creek was
a ways down.&nbsp; The woods themselve looked very eary but at first I
thought nothing of it.&nbsp; When we got bored of fishing we got adventurous.&nbsp;
We were already pretty deep inside the woods, but we went even farther,
the sun had started coming down and little did we know that the darkness
was catching up with us.&nbsp; We walked by this one area in the woods
seeing the first visual which was an old wooden shack.&nbsp; Now I wanted
to run the other way but my boyfriend and his friend were rather interested
in this.&nbsp; They went inside of the pitch dark shack, and nothing. Nothing
at all was there, we were almost on our way when we noticed that about
20 feet to the side of the shack stood a home.&nbsp; We noticed the house
only because of the smoke coming out of the chymney.&nbsp; But you couldnt
see the house at all because it was covered thick with trees all the way
around; the top of the chymney was only visible.&nbsp; A long road layed
ahead to what appeared to be an old field.&nbsp; We decided to check it
out for ourselves and started walki down the old road that had once been
plowed. Before we even got to the end of the house we heard the strangest
noise.&nbsp; It sounded like a bird would sound if it flapped its swings
in the tree branches, only you could also hear a pitter patter from the
feet of this unknown creature.&nbsp; As we slowly looked into the woods
and walked a few feet we stopped.&nbsp; And it stopped with us.&nbsp; If
you listened really carefully you could hear it pace back and forth.&nbsp;
Now if this wasnt bad enough we tested it by walking and running back and
forth the house. and it followed flapping and pitter pattering alongside
the trees.&nbsp; We ignored it at first and tired to see if maybe we could
get inside of the house, but the trail leading to it was almost not seen;
weeds and tall grass now lay over the once new path.&nbsp; Things were
getting interesting and we wanted to know more about this thing so we walked
to the end of the plowed road and nothing but a huge open field lay infront
of us.&nbsp; Thinking that this is lame we turn around and head back.&nbsp;
But not before seeing an unknown figure crowch right to the ground as if
it were hiding from us, following us to see what we were up to.&nbsp; All
we knew at that second was that we were not wanted at this home.&nbsp;
And even scarier as we walk by the house you can hear it again as it swooshes
infront of us and stops. Lets just say we got the hell outa there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Now i do not really believe in ghosts and such but having
experienced this makes me wonder what it could have been.&nbsp; Now from
the look of the house. location and what not it very well could have been
a witchs home and i do know some about witches.&nbsp; One possibility for
the unexplainied bird creature could be a bruja which is when a witch turns
herself into a bird, now as crazy as it sounds, it could be possible, but
whatever it is, was a little too spooky for me.&nbsp; I don't think I'll
be heading to Buda anytime soon.</B>

<BR><B>Hotel Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: apoohneicie@bellsouth.net</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my husband and I took a quiet vacation to
Raleigh to visit the museums the last thing we expected to find were ghosts,
we were very wrong. We decided to stay at a moderate hotel instead of taking
the 4 hr trip back home. The place looked fairly new and we quickly got
unpacked and headed out to get a bite to eat. When we returned the room's
windows were wide open. We figured we just hadn't noticed them before,
shut them and got ready for bed. We went to bed and fell asleep. About
an hour later I woke up and looked in the bathroom mirror which reflected
the bed. Above my head I saw&nbsp; brief camera flash type light. Immediately
I awakened my husband and being the amateur ghost hunters we are got out
the camera. I tried to explain that we were just there for the night and
we meant them no harm but they didn't seem to be listening. The flashes
continued and the area towards the floor got ice cold. The ghost seemed
to like my husband because his feet were so cold I had to rub them to keep
them warm. I think my husband was somewhat unconvinced about the whole
flash thing until he started to see them. Convinced to stand my ground
we laid down and try to go back to sleep. As I was cutting off the light
I said goodnight and a cabinet in the kitchenette slammed hard. Still we
tried to go to bed. We laid down a few minutes and my husband jumped up
and said something tapped his shoulder. That was it for us. We walked down
to the front desk in bear feet and pajammas. I told them if they did not
give us another room I was sleeping in the car. They said they could but
it would cost extra, I didn't care if they charged us $100. We went back
up to the room to get our things and the room was so cold you could feel
it coming out from underneath the door. The windows were open again and
though there was no wind that night the cutains were billowing out. My
husband went in and threw our things in the hall. Though we went to another
room I still didn't sleep a wink and my husband said he dreamed all night
someone was asking him where we were. Remember how they were going to charge
us more for the room? They never did. I have to wonder if we weren't the
only ones thrown out our room by a ghost.</B>

<P><B>Ghosts and My Daughter</B>

<P><B>By:jchadbourne@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>I am positive that my daughter sees ghosts in our home and out. One
night while she was brushing her teeth with the hand holding the toothbrush
in her mouth she waved her pinky finger and smiled while looking directly
in the upper corner of the bathroom. I asked her who are you waving at?
She said "him" I said who? She said "him" and poimted to the upper corner
of the room. Later I asked her who he was and she said "I dont know but
he likes me, he's nice." I asked her what he looks like and she said he
wears a tie. Thats all the information she wanted to say. She was 4 at
the time. Now she is 5 and we went to visit a friends grave and when we
pulled up she said " whhat are all those sad people doing here?" I said
what sad people? She said "oh there are lots of sad people here, I dont
like it here, why are we here?" We stayed for a few minutes and my daughter
spent the time looking around. When we were pulling away a song came on
the radio and she said " oh this is a good song for them it's a sad song
and they like it." Today in our house a cuboard door shut while my daughter
and I were in the other room. I said what was that? and she said "that
was grammie she shut the door, shes wearing her pajammas the ones she had
on when she died in her sleep, they have flowers on them." I'm not sure
what my grandmother was wearing when she died but she did die in her sleep.
Anyway thought it is interesting. Thanks for your time.</B>
