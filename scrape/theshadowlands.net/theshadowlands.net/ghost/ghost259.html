<P><B>The ghost in the Wenabego</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Cory's Grandfather had a wenabego out back and some</B>
<BR><B>nights we would camp out in it so we would not disturb</B>
<BR><B>anyone with our late night card games.&nbsp; I went off to</B>
<BR><B>bed around 2 am and Cory was already asleep.&nbsp; I had</B>
<BR><B>fallen asleep and left the TV on.&nbsp; I awoke around</B>
<BR><B>3:30am to the sound of the TV while in fuzzy mode.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>guess the National anthem had already played and TV</B>
<BR><B>had gone off air.&nbsp; This is how I knew beyond a shadow</B>
<BR><B>of a doubt that I was awake.&nbsp; I got off the bed that</B>
<BR><B>was above the drivers seat of the wenabego and turned</B>
<BR><B>the TV off.&nbsp; Soon as I jumped back up there and layed</B>
<BR><B>down, I tried to turn around but it was like my body</B>
<BR><B>was pinned down by some other force. I heard</B>
<BR><B>whispering outside the window as if coming from</B>
<BR><B>outside, then I looked to the ceiling of the wenabego</B>
<BR><B>and there was a face looking right at me.&nbsp; soon as the</B>
<BR><B>face dissapeared I was able to move.&nbsp; I got off the</B>
<BR><B>bed freaked and tried to awake Cory to tell him about</B>
<BR><B>the experience, but he would not stir.&nbsp; Then something</B>
<BR><B>hit me I know I had turned this TV off.&nbsp; I told cory</B>
<BR><B>is this a sick joke and he finally woke up and told me</B>
<BR><B>he didn't do it.&nbsp; and that there was no remote because</B>
<BR><B>it was an older model&nbsp; TV with no remote.&nbsp; i turned</B>
<BR><B>the TV off and layed back down.&nbsp; soon as I hit the</B>
<BR><B>pillow the TV came back on.&nbsp; This was freaky.&nbsp; I told</B>
<BR><B>Cory to get up so I could search for a remote when I</B>
<BR><B>found none. I made a remark to Cory asking him didn't</B>
<BR><B>that freak you out.&nbsp; Cory replied&nbsp; "I live in this</B>
<BR><B>house and I've gotten used to the appearances.&nbsp; they</B>
<BR><B>no longer bother me."&nbsp; After he said that I unplugged</B>
<BR><B>the TV and layed back down.&nbsp; to me this was freakier</B>
<BR><B>than the face in the ceiling.&nbsp; The TV being unplugged,</B>
<BR><B>came back on as soon as I layed back down in the bed.</B>
<BR><B>I saw that Cory had not done it because I witnessed</B>
<BR><B>that Cory never got up from the bed and the TV was</B>
<BR><B>still unplugged.&nbsp; I have no way of explaining this!</B>
<BR><B>This is enough for me to see one thing but a TV coming</B>
<BR><B>on tops the cake.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Sleeping Monster</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: karenb@cyberback.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; My story starts back in 1973. I was only 5 years old
at the time and my mother and father had split up. For some reason my father
thought it best if me, my brother and two sisters lived with my grandma
and grandpa (his parents). My mother at that time had left my life completely
and my father never was around. To give you a since of how things was for
me, my grandmother didn't believe me to be her grandson. I think because
I had brown eyes and my siblings all had my father's eyes. My place to
sleep was on the back porch in front of the door and beside the washer
and dryer. Each night after everyone was asleep I remember the sleeping
monster coming into the room. I couldn't scream because of my fear .And
each night It would shake me, I could feel my body go numb and the last
thing I would remember is waking up the following morning. Sometimes I
would wake up under my brother's bed and other times I would wake up wedged
in between the washer and dryer. I remember one day the sun was setting
across my back yard. Grandpa and I were on the back porch staring across
the yard. At the edge of the yard was a creek and beyond that creek were
thick woods. That day I saw the sleeping monster coming from out of the
woods. I pleaded with my grandfather that it was coming but he saw nothing.I
remember one time telling grandpa the name of this monster but over the
years I have forgotten it. For the whole time that I lived with them the
monster would come to me at night. I never got a good look&nbsp; at it
because the room was always too dark to see in. After 3 years of this horror
show my mother came back into our lives. She got custody of us and we moved
away. I never slept in their house again and after moving out I never saw
the sleeping monster again......I think its name was something like Zycoptis
but I'm not for sure..Some might say that the sleeping monster was only
from the trauma of my mother disappearing from my life. It was real though,as
real as you reading this story.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Tenant</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dpadyk@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Your web site is fascinating ... the paranormal is of real interest
for me.</B>
<BR><B>My daughter and I share our apartment with an older woman. A couple
of tenants before us, an older lady DID live there but did not die in the
apartment. My daughter's room was her television room - she smoked as the
ceiling was stained black where the wall meets the ceiling - and the room
was a faded yellow ...</B>
<BR><B>My daughter wanted her room repainted - while we were painting,
we were being watched. My daughter felt the lady's presence first ... Kate
was more unnerved ... I could smell her - you know that soft powdery smell
older women have ...?</B>
<BR><B>We hear her slippers at night walking the hallway, once I heard
the strains of an overture to an old sop opera coming from Kate's room
- it was 2:00am and, like an idiot, I scared her by throwing open the bedroom
door - the cigarette went out and the sounds stopped ... I found myself
apologizing and hurried back to my own room.</B>
<BR><B>I felt horrible - as I was drifting off, a soft voice said simply,
"no need"and I felt my head being stroked.</B>
<BR><B>Kate would feel kisses good night before I'd say good night. She
could smell the cigarette smoke in her room - our cats - we have 3 - either
keep clear of the room or something suddenly catches their eye - anywhere
in the apartment -&nbsp; and they follow someone's movements. THAT was
as intriguing as it was unnerving.</B>
<BR><B>One evening, I saw our tenant - I was in the kitchen and, out the
corner of my eye, I saw an older lady in a very long white nightgown with
a high collar and mutton sleeves. She had the whitest hair and an almost
timid demeanor - she DID allow me to see her - Kate sees her regularity
- standing outside my bedroom. Just standing ...</B>
<BR><B>There's a sadness - even - as I said - a timidity about her. She's
very sweet and I hope she doesn't leave us -</B>
<BR><B>My ex-husband shares his house with a particularity nasty elemental
- the house used to belong to his parents and now he and his wife reside
there ... Kate has experienced some unpleasantness and I have never liked
the place.</B>

<BR><B>The Voice</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: naynay_5@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was about a year ago when my brother-in-law and his wife moved
into this house that was divided into three apartments. There was 2 on
the first floor and the 3rd one was on the second floor. One day my brother-in-law
and his wife were talking about their apartment being haunted, I don't
believe in ghost at all but what they told me was quite chilling. She (
the wife ) told me that one day her husband was taking a shower and he
looked in the mirror and saw the words Daddy here's what I want for Christmas.
They told me they never wrote on the mirror before. Then one day she told
me about is that no one else was home and she was watching TV and had turn
the TV volume all the way down and when she did that she heard clear as
day the words Hello, and she said hello back.</B>
<BR><B>She was pregnant at the time this one happen. She was laying in
bed one day and felt a cold hand push her head in the pillow and was trying
to suffocate her but then it let go.</B>
<BR><B>She had talk to the other residents in the house and they all said
they could hear foot steps on the back stairs. When you walked in to the
house you would see a main stair case and right beside the stair case was
like a arch leading to a back room there were stair cases there and they
would hear footsteps going up thoughts steps at night and even during the
day. My brother-in-laws wife lost her baby and they finally moved out as
well as the other who were living there. My sister-in-law tried to fine
some history on the house but could not fine none, there is no information
about this house before the 1980's I think she said. The house is located
in Piqua Ohio.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>seeing no one was up I went to turn around but was pushed into the
den and</B>
<BR><B>the TV came on, it was the news about a car crash, I was so scared
(this was</B>
<BR><B>earlier before I knew about the ghosts) I just went back to my room

<BR><B>They Always Find Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Trouble2380@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, I have always been intrigued my the paranormal, and have always
wanted to be a paranormalist.&nbsp; Hasn't happened yet but maybe one day</B>
<BR><B>My first real encounter with a ghost (other than my older brother
scaring me half to death with bloody Mary which I didn't see) was in Manassas
Va.&nbsp; We were renting a house that was built in about the 1950s I'm
guessing.&nbsp; Well, it was a split foyer and one day I came home from
school dropped my bookbag on the foyer corner as I always do, and was about
to go down stairs to watch some TV.&nbsp; When I was headed down stairs
I realized my dog Nikki hadn't come to greet me, so instead of going straight
down stairs I looked up the stairs, and a little girl, I would say around
8 or 9 with blonde hair and what appeared to be wearing a nightgown was
standing at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; She wasn't really transparent
at all and then she smiled at me, then disappeared.&nbsp; Well, I was all
hyped up because I knew I had just saw a ghost.&nbsp; I didn't want to
tell my parents about it because they would think I was loopy.</B>
<BR><B>Well about a month later, my brother and I were in bed, and my parents
were up stairs on the computer, then they heard the TV come on and started
flipping through channels, It stoped as my mother was getting up to go
turn it off figuring Nikki (the dog) Had jumped on the couch and hit the
remote, but as she was going down the stairs she heard a little girl giggle.&nbsp;
Again she thought nothing of it and turned off the TV.&nbsp; She went upstairs
and looked in my room and saw Nikki lying on the bed with me.&nbsp; She
started telling my dad that Nikki was in my room and that it was weird
because the channel it stopped on had an old war movie on and wouldn't
think it would have children giggling.&nbsp; About 5 mins later they heard
the same giggle in the kitchen which was right behind them.&nbsp; I feel
blessed I was the only one that saw her. :)</B>
<BR><B>Well, when we moved out of that house we moved on top of a mountain.&nbsp;
I would be the first home and sometimes would hear footsteps in the attic,
my family thought it was my imagination.&nbsp; Well, that's about all that
happened in that house until I had my son in 1998.&nbsp; One night my B/F
and I were on the deck smoking and heard a baby crying, well I went to
check on my son and he was still asleep.&nbsp; I went back out and still
heard a baby crying, but it sounded like it was coming from the attic we
looked through the glass doors and saw the light fixture in the dining
room moving.&nbsp; Well, it lasted about 5 mins then it stopped.&nbsp;
We didn't live in that house much longer after my son was born, but unfourtuantly
we have moved to a house where i have had no strange encounters</B>

<P><B>This is Crazy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DarkForceX@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I hope you don't think that I'm crazy but here goes:</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; About 2 1/2 years ago, I was just moving into this
new house.&nbsp; It was a sorta old house that had alot of run down qualities
to it.&nbsp; We had just finished moving all of our stuff inside and my
parents wanted to leave to go get something to eat.&nbsp; I wasn't real
hungry at the time, because I'm always snacking on things anyway, so they
told me they would be back later after they were done eating.&nbsp; After
they left I was sitting in the living room reading a book, kind of bored,
when I heard a soft bang coming from the basement, it was almost like as
if metal had hit metal, which I thought was funny since we hadn't put anything
down there yet.&nbsp; I laughed it off as my imagination and kept reading.&nbsp;
A few minutes later, I heard it again.&nbsp; I looked up from my book again
getting kind of scared, but I tried to ignore it by reading my book some
more.&nbsp; This went on for some time until the noise got a little louder,
so I went to investigate.&nbsp; I walked slowly down the stairs, until
I got to the basement door, when I heard it really loud and I ran outside
on our front porch.&nbsp; I thought it would be over if I just stayed outside,
but it got wierder.&nbsp; I started reading my book on the front porch
to calm my nerves, when I looked up to see two dogs walk on my front lawn,
I was really spooked by this cause I hadn't heard or seen them coming,
so I froze as I watched them. After&nbsp; looking at me really coldly,
they took down the street.&nbsp; I later learned that the people who owned
the house before me had two dogs that got hit by a truck, that had been
kept in the basement, we moved out of the house, but I never went in the
basement alone from that day on...</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Most of the time the ghosts don't bother me at all but 3 things have
happened to me in the 13 years i've lived in my house.</B>
<BR><B>1. One time I was sleeping lightly and all of a sounded i hear someone
whisper "Amanda!" (my name) and I woke up really fast and no one was there.
Everyone in my house was sleeping. I'm not sure if i was dreaming this
or not but I dont think it was.</B>
<BR><B>2. I was sitting in my room drawing on my bed when something white
jumped over my bed. It seemed like a ball of paper did but i looked on
the other side of my bed nothing was there. I ran so fast out of my room
it wasnt even funny.</B>
<BR><B>3. This happened to my brother. Me and my two brothers have connected
rooms like mines the end, then my brother Zanes in the middle, then Zacks.
Zane had his door open and i hade mine open too. Zack was sitting in his
room watching TV and a ball from my room was thrown into Zack's room. But
me and Zane weren't up there...</B><B></B>

<BR><B>A Few Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: heather_nic_00@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have a few stories, not that any have happened to me directly but
rather</B>
<BR><B>to my family members.&nbsp; I've always believed in ghosts and never
needed any</B>
<BR><B>concrete evidence in believing, I just know that there are some
there.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, my first story happened when my mom and dad had first gotten
married</B>
<BR><B>and my mom was pregnant with me.&nbsp; They lived in a little apartment
in Pa.</B>
<BR><B>It wasn't that it was old or anything, the lady that owned it before
had</B>
<BR><B>died a lonely lady.&nbsp; She always wanted to have children but
never got</B>
<BR><B>married and had any.&nbsp; Anyway, my parents set up the one bedroom
for the</B>
<BR><B>nursery.&nbsp; It had a crib with stuffed animals in it and a walker
with stuffed</B>
<BR><B>animals in it and a rocking chair.&nbsp; On the one wall, there
were shelves with</B>
<BR><B>books and some pictures.&nbsp; One picture in particular had a little
boy and a</B>
<BR><B>little girl kissing.&nbsp; The little girl had a dress on and the
way the picture</B>
<BR><B>was made, the little girl looked pregnant.&nbsp; Mom said that the
room was</B>
<BR><B>always cold and that Champ (the dog) never went in there and always
barked</B>
<BR><B>at it when he was at the bottom of the stairs.&nbsp; One night my
parents had</B>
<BR><B>gone out to eat and when they returned, the door to the nursery
was shut.</B>
<BR><B>My dad went up to check it out and the stuffed animals were all
over the</B>
<BR><B>floor and not in the crib or the walker.&nbsp; The walker, which
was usually kept</B>
<BR><B>beside the crib was pushed to the middle of the room.&nbsp; The
picture of the</B>
<BR><B>little boy and girl had been turned around on the shelf, facing
the wall.</B>
<BR><B>Dad didn't tell mom that being so close to her due date that he
was afraid</B>
<BR><B>that it would upset her and she would go into labor.&nbsp; He thought
that maybe</B>
<BR><B>someone had broken into the house but there was nothing missing
and the only</B>
<BR><B>room bothered was the nursery.&nbsp;&nbsp; He then thought that
Champ had gotten into</B>
<BR><B>the room and was messing around but he knew he was tied outside
while they</B>
<BR><B>were gone.&nbsp; He also knew that Champ couldn't turn the picture
around because</B>
<BR><B>it was on such a high shelf.&nbsp; Plus Champ hated that room.&nbsp;
He just didn't</B>
<BR><B>know what to think.&nbsp; My parents were looking for a new apartment
to live in</B>
<BR><B>because my dad had gotten a new job and needed to relocate anyway
so he</B>
<BR><B>wasn't real worried about it.&nbsp; About 2 weeks later, my dad
and mom had come</B>
<BR><B>home from the store and found Champ at the bottom of the steps growling
at</B>
<BR><B>the room and his hair was standing on end.&nbsp; My dad went up
to see what was</B>
<BR><B>going on and the very first thing he noticed was that the picture
was on the</B>
<BR><B>floor slightly outside of the door and there was a thumb tack pressed</B>
<BR><B>through the stomach of the little girl. My dad went into the room
and</B>
<BR><B>everything was in aray.&nbsp; The blankets were all over the floor
the curtains</B>
<BR><B>were all twisted around the curtain rod and the walker was flipped
upside</B>
<BR><B>down.&nbsp; My dad decided to get the hell out of there and go to
his parents</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; On the way there my mother went into labor.&nbsp; I
was born that next</B>
<BR><B>morning.&nbsp; When they came home from the hospital, they decided
that they were</B>
<BR><B>going to keep me in their room because they didn't want whatever
was in the</B>
<BR><B>nursery to hurt me.&nbsp; That night, I didn't sleep. I'm told that
I stayed up</B>
<BR><B>all night and cried.&nbsp; My dad told my mom to put me in the nursery
so they</B>
<BR><B>could get some sleep.&nbsp; My mom was reluctant but she did.&nbsp;
As soon as I was</B>
<BR><B>put into that room, I quit crying and went right to sleep.&nbsp;
In the middle of</B>
<BR><B>the night, my mom got up to check on me and when she opened the
door, she</B>
<BR><B>saw a little old lady sitting in the rocking chair, humming away
as I slept</B>
<BR><B>peacefully.&nbsp; She freaked out and the lady disappeared.&nbsp;
Two weeks later, my</B>
<BR><B>parents moved some where else.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy my story, I
have one more but</B>
<BR><B>that will come later.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Unusual Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:jcoleman@wilmington.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm currently a freshman attending Wilmington College. I've always
been</B>
<BR><B>extremely fascinated by ghosts and other such things. I have read
many</B>
<BR><B>stories about peoples encounters and experiences but I have never
had</B>
<BR><B>anything happen to me. That is until a couple of weeks ago. I had
gone home</B>
<BR><B>for the weekend to see my family and that night as I was sleeping
I</B>
<BR><B>remember that in my dream we all began to talk about ghosts and
hauntings.</B>
<BR><B>Then I felt something beside me and I woke up. I was laying on my
back with</B>
<BR><B>my head facing the wall. I tried to look to my right so I could
see what</B>
<BR><B>was beside the bed. But I couldn't move very well. It was like something</B>
<BR><B>was trying to hold me down. I manage to move my head a little and
I could</B>
<BR><B>see that a large black shadow was standing over me. It was the shadow
of a</B>
<BR><B>man in a long coat and a black hat. I decided I was going to take
a deep</B>
<BR><B>breathe and then put all of my strength into one movement to throw
myself</B>
<BR><B>at this guy and find out what he wanted. So I tried to breathe in
but found</B>
<BR><B>it was very difficult. After I had finally gotten enough air in
I threw</B>
<BR><B>myself out of the bed and at the man next to me. But I just fell
to the</B>
<BR><B>floor and there was no one there. Since then I have been back to
my house</B>
<BR><B>several times and slept in the same bed and never had anything else
happen.</B>
<BR><B>I had also lived in the same house for the past eight years or so
and never</B>
<BR><B>had anything like this happen before. Was this all a dream? Or was
this</B>
<BR><B>thing looking for someone to torment and when he saw that I was
going to</B>
<BR><B>fight back decided to go somewhere else? Thanks for your time.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Upstairs Apartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ShrlDrlng@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I moved into my apartment my new neighbors told me that they
thought the house was haunted because she heard that a man once hung himself
in her apartment. She for some reason thinks there are three ghosts here:
an older woman and a young man and woman. I didn't take this into consideration
untill I had a few of my own experiences.</B>
<BR><B>I was visiting them with my son who at the time was only about 5
months old, we were talking about what they thought were the ghosts making
themselves known: doors opening, the children having nightmares about someone
telling them to kill themselves and so on. I've always been quite intriqued
by the idea of hauntings and such. I took a break to refill my sons bottle
unstairs in my apartment, when I got to the sink to wash it out I nearly
had a heart attack when I felt what I swore was someone running up behind
me like they were going to tackle me. I spun around instinctively to defend
myseld as petrified as I was, but noone was there. I think maybe even though
I dont believe these 'ghosts' are 'bad ghosts' ,&nbsp; they want to make
sure I knew they were real. Needless to say, I took the babys things and
finished my business downstairs.</B>
<BR><B>My other experience with these ghosts was a noise in my kitchen
very early in the mornings. It sounded like a glass being put down on my
table, but a little harder than you normally would do so. This one morning
the noise roused me from my sleep just enough for me to realize there was
a noise in the kitchen but I fell right back to sleep. However, every time
I fell back to sleep the noise grew louder as if the noise where a deliberate
attempt to wake me up. I figure that these ghosts, or at least the one
in my apartment, is a joker. I think it's the young man. This kind of scared
me so what I did was I closed my eyes and said in my head 'look guys, I
respect your presence and the fact that this house was at one point yours,
but it's mine now and you're freaking me out, so please just leave me alone',
and they did. I don't hear any noises or anything. My neighbors still do
though.</B>
<BR><B>I've never seen them but I have this wierd feeling all the time
that I'm being watched now. That if I turn around someone will be there
or that someone is following me around the house.</B>
<BR><B>I'm sure you guys hear this stuff all the time, how impressive does
this story sound to you?</B>

<P><B>VA Hospital</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:johnkyla@jcn.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>In my last letter I forgot to include a nother occurance that happened
to me recently. 2 months ago me my husband my mother and brother and his
wife were visiting my dad in the VA hospital in Omaha, NE . after visiting
we all loaded up on the elevator from the 6th floor to head down to the
1st floor.&nbsp; when we got to the 4th floor (which happens to be the
surgical floor I found out later) The elevator stoped and the doors opened.
It was a sunday after noon and no one is on the 4th floor on the weekend
and the whole floor was quite dark.We all got a weird creepy felling like
we just got a new passenger. The door stayed open for about a minute or
2 and finally closed . when we got down to the 1st floor we all quickly
exited the elevator and headed for the main lobby about 30 ft away, my
husband left to get the van and while we were waiting my sister in law
and I noticed that the elevator which was one of those talking elevators
just kept opening and closing saying "first floor" . We pointed it out
to my mom and brother then we all quickly hurried out side and decided
to wait out there. I dont know If It was a ghost or just electrical problems
but I was really eerie. I just wonder If any other weird stuff ever happens
there.</B>

<P><B>Was it Just a Dream?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: TScoles1@cs.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I was babysitting my three-year old nephew and his infant brother
one afternoon. I was sitting in a recliner holding the baby, and the three-year
old was sitting on the couch watching T.V. The couch faces the television,
and also faces the front hall.</B>
<BR><B>My nephew suddenly turned to me with a&nbsp; smile on his face and
asked me, "Tina, who is that?" I thought he was referring to someone on
T.V., so I answered with the name of the cartoon character. "No," he said,
"the little boy in there!" and he pointed towards the hall. It startled
me a little, but I calmly replied that no one was in there. He kept repeating
that there was a little boy in there, and then finally said, " you know
who it is." Well, I pride myself on the fact that as I have gotten older,
I go and check out suspicious noises and such, instead of freaking out
like I used to do when I was younger. But that shook me up more than a
little bit, I have to admit. In fact, I avoided that part of the house
for the rest of the evening, until my husband, Ron, came home and we both
went to bed.</B>
<BR><B>Early the next morning, while it was still dark, I was awakened
out of my sleep- sort of. I remember that I was dreaming when I suddenly
felt an overwhelming sense of dread. I struggled to awaken completely,
but felt like I was drugged. That is when I felt&nbsp; someone small sit
down on the edge of the bed. I felt like I was between sleep and waking,
because I remember telling myself to "wake up, wake up!" and at the same
time the sense that someone had indeed sat at that the foot of my bed was
so real, that I actually felt the bed go down on the corner. I was struggling
so hard to come to, that I felt like I was swimming through water, and
was struggling to reach the top and catch a breath.&nbsp; It was then that
I heard what I thought was a little girl, whisper my name. The whispers
got closer, until I finally heard them directly in my ears, repeating rapidly.
Sometimes I heard my name and sometimes it sounded like she was saying
"Mommy". I have, however, no children of my own. I finally came fully awake
and have had no other "dreams" or experiences like that.</B>

<BR><B>Weird and Strange Experiences</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Supperstargirl3@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am 23 years old now and living in California all my life.&nbsp;
I was about 7</B>
<BR><B>years old and my family and I lived in some apartments.&nbsp; I
had a&nbsp; bracelet</B>
<BR><B>that I loved dearly and it was t he shape of a heart.&nbsp; My Mom
had bought that</B>
<BR><B>bracelet for me from a thrift store.&nbsp; I loved going to thrift
stores with my</B>
<BR><B>Mom ever since I was young.&nbsp; Once I wore that bracelet and
I was sitting on</B>
<BR><B>my parents bed in the master bedroom.&nbsp; I accidentally dropped
the bracelet on</B>
<BR><B>the carpet floor.&nbsp; I looked down and the thick noticeable bracelet
was not</B>
<BR><B>anywhere to be seen on the floor.&nbsp; My parents room was also
small so It</B>
<BR><B>couldn't be anywhere else.&nbsp; I got down and looked under the
bed and it was</B>
<BR><B>gone.&nbsp; I looked everywhere.&nbsp; I was soo amazed because
I never found the</B>
<BR><B>bracelet and everytime my mother would clean the room I would ask
her to</B>
<BR><B>please look for the bracelet.&nbsp; She always did and she never
ever found it.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>loved it so much too.&nbsp; I never thought of anything of the ordinary
because I</B>
<BR><B>was just a kid.&nbsp; Years went by and I still will never forget
it.&nbsp; I had lived</B>
<BR><B>in that apartment for about since I was four years old to about
12 years old.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;As years went by in that apartment I started to notice strange
and scary</B>
<BR><B>things happen to me at night.&nbsp; I was sleeping in a bed and
I would get these</B>
<BR><B>strange senses as soon as I got inside the bed.&nbsp; I used to
get a sensation of</B>
<BR><B>great winds go by my face to the point that I could not breathe
and I could</B>
<BR><B>not move my hands or my feet.&nbsp; I was "not even asleep yet."&nbsp;
I do not think</B>
<BR><B>that this was a dream because this would happen as soon as I got
in my bed</B>
<BR><B>and shut my eyes for about a couple of minutes.&nbsp; I couldn't
even open my eyes</B>
<BR><B>when this happened to me it was as if I was flying into a house.&nbsp;
This house</B>
<BR><B>that I used to see through my eyes was very strange like a dirty,
condemned</B>
<BR><B>house which no one lived in.&nbsp; I always asked my younger brother
if anything</B>
<BR><B>like this ever happened to him he would tell me that I'm crazy and
I need</B>
<BR><B>Jesus.&nbsp; We moved into another house when I was about 16.&nbsp;
This time It was</B>
<BR><B>not an apartment this is a house.&nbsp; Two years went by and When
I'm alone in</B>
<BR><B>the house I saw someone pass by the hallway as if it were my dad.&nbsp;
When I</B>
<BR><B>called out his name, no body responds.&nbsp; Sometimes I would think
I'm crazy or</B>
<BR><B>strange.&nbsp; It was an apparition I see dressed exactly what my
father dresses</B>
<BR><B>like and I see it through the corner of my eyes when I'm sitting
on my</B>
<BR><B>computer in the living room.&nbsp; I do not think its anything but
it vanishes.</B>
<BR><B>Its like someone runs through the hallway really quickly.&nbsp;
My Mom just</B>
<BR><B>yesterday was looking in to the hallway because our dining table
is visible</B>
<BR><B>from the hallway, and she went to the door.&nbsp; I told her what
is wrong with</B>
<BR><B>her, she said I thought I saw your father or someone walk through
the door.</B>
<BR><B>I said you know what Mom, I saw the same thing last time, like someone</B>
<BR><B>dressed like dad with a white t shirt (that's what my father walks
around the</B>
<BR><B>house with) and regular pajama shorts.&nbsp; So I told her I saw
the same thing</B>
<BR><B>like three times too!</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in a small town called Cambria.&nbsp;
I live</B>
<BR><B>in the very first house built here, its over 100 years</B>
<BR><B>old.&nbsp; When I was around 8, I was sleeping on the 2nd</B>
<BR><B>(top except the attic) floor on a matress on the floor</B>
<BR><B>(didnt have the frame up yet) With my brother.&nbsp; It was</B>
<BR><B>very hot, we had no AC, and I couldn't sleep.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>looking into the darkness and heard a sound to my</B>
<BR><B>left, I looked, and there was nothing. Then I looked</B>
<BR><B>to my right, and there was a large, heavy built,</B>
<BR><B>decapatated man facing me.&nbsp; He had his hand out to my</B>
<BR><B>neck. I was very scared, and tried to wake my brother,</B>
<BR><B>who is a heavy sleeper and wouldn't wake up.&nbsp; I moved</B>
<BR><B>to my left, and he followed my neck with his hand, but</B>
<BR><B>never touched me. I reached out and tried to shove him</B>
<BR><B>but when I touched him he wasnt solid, and he</B>
<BR><B>dissappeared.&nbsp; My parents said it wasnt real, and i</B>
<BR><B>havn't seen anything since. Any ideas what this was?</B>
<BR><B>Oh, by the way, an old railroad track runs through my</B>
<BR><B>yard. It isn't used anymore, but my house was once</B>
<BR><B>used by the person who took care of the railroad</B>

<P><B>I think this is the greatest house.&nbsp; I have been there several
times,</B>
<BR><B>and always, no matter what time of the year, I am surrounded by
a cloud</B>
<BR><B>of rose scent.&nbsp; I have been when roses are in bloom and when
they are</B>
<BR><B>not, I still smell a strong scent of roses.&nbsp; I went on the
tour one</B>
<BR><B>time, and met my fiance later for dinner.&nbsp; He remarked that
he did not</B>
<BR><B>know I liked rose scented perfumes. I don't wear floral scents.&nbsp;
It came</B>
<BR><B>from the tour of house.</B>
<BR><B>I don't like going at Christmas, though.&nbsp; I get a strong feeling
of</B>
<BR><B>dislike over all the decorating.&nbsp; Not my dislike, something
else or</B>
<BR><B>someone else that does not like the place decorated.&nbsp; I get

<BR><B>Strange</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: xxvictoriaxx16@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, My name is Allison, I am 17 now. I would have to say that
I have</B>
<BR><B>always believed in a force or whatever there may be. Since I was
little I</B>
<BR><B>have always been more intune to things around me. For a whole year
I would</B>
<BR><B>dream the next day. That got kinda dull. I used to always think
that there</B>
<BR><B>was a spirit outside my doorway watching me at night, waiting me
for me to</B>
<BR><B>make a dash for the bathroom. That's why I never took midnight trips.
I</B>
<BR><B>believed that if I even made a sound that it was sure to get me.
I was so</B>
<BR><B>bad that I thought someone was watching me out my window. I even
had to</B>
<BR><B>sleep in the middle of my bed, as not to show my feet, afarid that
they</B>
<BR><B>might be subjected to unknown tortures. I never really got over
this, but I</B>
<BR><B>have learned to live with it. As my child hood went on I went looking
for</B>
<BR><B>ghosts. I thought that there was a blonde haired boy living in my
upstairs</B>
<BR><B>and a awful monster living in my garage. Even when I walk up the
stairs now</B>
<BR><B>I am afarid to look behind me. This all way only the beggining.
Let's see,</B>
<BR><B>where to start... well I have always been terrorifed by mirrors.
Withen that</B>
<BR><B>last few years I have actually seen things, big black blobs!! Like
for</B>
<BR><B>example I was vacuming under my bed one day, with a very large vacum,
like a</B>
<BR><B>heavy vac. Well anyways it was next to my door I was looking in
the mirror</B>
<BR><B>for some reason and I actually saw something black fly from out
from under</B>
<BR><B>my bed and knock againest the door and vacum and tip it over a bit.
I was</B>
<BR><B>soooo scared!! Another time I was looking in the mirror talking
to my friend</B>
<BR><B>and putting on my makeup i was thinking how i wanted her to take
her coat</B>
<BR><B>home since i had had it for the whole summer and as i pointed to
my open</B>
<BR><B>door it closed to show her coat. That was really strange since we
had carpet</B>
<BR><B>and the the draft of air runs the other direction. The scariest
moment of my</B>
<BR><B>life had to be when I was on the internet this one night and i got
kicked</B>
<BR><B>off at 2 am exactully it was aug 23, 2000, i took this as a sign
to retire</B>
<BR><B>to bed. So I was laying in bed and my black cat was laying on my
chest. I</B>
<BR><B>was trying to fall asleep but the whole night i was sooooo thirsty
I had had</B>
<BR><B>at least 5 sodas in about 3 hours. so i was reeved up on caffine.
I had</B>
<BR><B>about 3 blankets on and all of a sudden i felt like there was a
wand of</B>
<BR><B>static electricty being run up and down my legs, the hair was moving
with</B>
<BR><B>it. ahhh it felt so wierd. The cat felt a presance and began to
dig her</B>
<BR><B>nails into me trying to escape, but I held on to her tight. Then
I feel this</B>
<BR><B>poking and feel as though something is coming closer to me and closer,
then</B>
<BR><B>it is next to my face and I hear a male voice say somthing to me.
but it</B>
<BR><B>wasn't anything i was able to understand. I think it was backwards
english</B>
<BR><B>or somthing of the sort. but the cat started clawing trying to go.
she was</B>
<BR><B>so scared. I couldn't move and I couldn't speak. I wanted to yell
for help</B>
<BR><B>but i was uncapable. Then a short period later I heard someone come
into my</B>
<BR><B>room, stublling and tripping and I heard a female voice yelling.
I was sure</B>
<BR><B>this was going to wake up my parents in the other room but it didn't.
She</B>
<BR><B>left and I tried to sleep but until I finally did i heard this droming
noise</B>
<BR><B>in my ears. I asked my mom the next day and she said it wasn't her.
That is</B>
<BR><B>the only contact I have had. But it seems like i always see those
black</B>
<BR><B>figures. even in my friends house. she said i brought them. it seems
to go</B>
<BR><B>in cycles. it was following us for a month and now it is gone. Oh
by the way</B>
<BR><B>that cat that was with me, she went crazy after that night! She
ran around</B>
<BR><B>with a look of terror and lost control and then ran away. I've had
dreams</B>
<BR><B>about her coming back.</B>

<BR><B>Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MZMCCREE@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I remember this as if it was yesterday.&nbsp; The exact dates, I
can't recall, yet I can tell you everything that happened.&nbsp; Why it
happened, I don't know.&nbsp; Me and my family had moved to another house
in Camden, Arkansas.&nbsp; We moved to an area called Fairview.&nbsp; The
house we lived in didn't have any strange occurences that I know of, so
when this happened I was competely shocked.</B><B></B>

<P><B>People in the Story:</B><B></B>

<P><B>Lameka......that's me</B>
<BR><B>Wendy.......my sister</B>
<BR><B>Mike..........my brother</B>
<BR><B>Tyrone.......my brother's friend/ good friend of family</B>
<BR><B>Keisha.......friend of family</B>
<BR><B>Miranda......little sister</B><B></B>

<P><B>Me, Wendy and Tyrone were all in the bed together one night.&nbsp;
Tyrone was sleep near the wall, Wendy in the middle, and I was on the other
edge facing the kitchen.&nbsp; I was on the phone talking to my friend
Charles, when I heard Tyrone talking in his sleep.&nbsp; I told Charles
I'll talk to him later and wanted to listen to Tyrone while he was talking
in his sleep.&nbsp; I laid there, never moved.&nbsp; Tyrone was holding
a conversation with what appears to be my brother in his sleep.&nbsp; They
were talking about how they embaressed me in the club previously.&nbsp;
I just kept listening, waiting to hear something real good to use against
them two.&nbsp; Guess I got it also!&nbsp; Tyrone paused and then he started
again, but this time.....he sounded upset.&nbsp; He was also having a conversation
withe somone who wanted him to do something.&nbsp; He would never say what
it was, he would just tell the person no and that he wasn't doing it.&nbsp;
I was really listening by this time.&nbsp; I just had to know who he was
talking to.&nbsp; Then he paused again.&nbsp; This time when he began to
speak, he would say his part and the other person part.&nbsp; Yet, when
the other person spoke, Tyrone's voice would get deeper.&nbsp; This was
the same person that wanted him to do something, but he wouldn't do it.
The person kept begging, and yet he would say no.&nbsp; Finally, Tyrone
hit the wall,and said "Satan, I said I'm not doing it.!&nbsp; Ahh man,
was I really listening by that time.&nbsp; I was in total shock.&nbsp;
Then all of a sudden he stopped speaking.&nbsp; All I could think of was,
did I hear him correct?&nbsp; After a short pause, I hear a voice, the
same voice that was speaking to Tyrone was speaking to me.&nbsp; It said
to me "Lameka, I know you are awake, I'm sitting right over here on the
dresser looking at you."&nbsp; I looked over there, all I saw was my little
sister Barney doll.&nbsp; I immediately jumped up and turned on the light,
I woke up Tyrone, Wendy and my brother.&nbsp; I told them what happened
and read the Bible to Tyrone.&nbsp; He denied everything and was mad cause
I woke him up.&nbsp; He didn't remember anything.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The next day I was laying on the couch taking a nap while my mother,
sister, and brother went to Wal-Mart. I was there with my mother's boyfriend
who was in the bedroom.&nbsp; While laying down on the couch I was awaken
to someone's hand on my butt.&nbsp; They had their right hand on my right
butt cheek. This person was holding me down.&nbsp; I looked around to see
who it was. Nobody was there, but this person wouldn't let me up. Finally,
I just gave up and said please get off me.&nbsp; They let me up and I told
my mother them about it.&nbsp; They also had Tyrone with them.&nbsp; They
didn't believe me, and my mother said I must be doing something bad for
the devil to be trying to communicate with me.</B>
<BR><B>That evening me, Tyrone, Wendy and Mike were up late talking about
what happened and ghosts.&nbsp; Much to my surprise I fell asleep again
on the couch, and Tyrone was across from me on the other couch sitting
straight up.&nbsp; All of a sudden in the middle of the night, I the same
voice calling my name. I looked at Tyrone and I could see him, but also
a head on the side of his body, but the rest of the body was connected
to Tyrone.&nbsp; This "thing" asked me to wake up.&nbsp; Then it said it
wanted to talk to me, well....that's one conversation that never started.
I jumped&nbsp; off the couch and turned on the lights.&nbsp; This time
I made my brother take Tyrone home.</B>
<BR><B>Well, a couple of days passed and Tyrone wasn't over to house, but
this time Keisha came over. I'd left and went to my boyfriend's house.&nbsp;
Keisha was on the phone with Tyrone's brother and then he said Tyrone wanted
to speak to her. (Prior to this I'd told Keisha what happened).&nbsp; She
said that when Tyrone got on the phone that he asked where was everybody
at. She told him.&nbsp; She said that all of a sudden Tyrone was quiet
on the phone.&nbsp; She said that she called out his name, and he said
where is Lameka.&nbsp; She said "I already told you Tyrone, quit asking
me that."&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he said you haven't told me anything, I want
to know where Lameka is...and that I always speak to Lameka.&nbsp; Then
it hit her, she wasn't talking to Tyrone anymore. She said she hung up
the phone, but the phone rang back.&nbsp; When she said hello, there was
no answer.&nbsp; She said it did this several times, then she&nbsp; ran
in my mother's room.&nbsp; She told my mother to answer the phone and tell
them kids to quit playing on the line. When my mother picked up the phone,
she said Lameka isn't here.&nbsp; Keisha said the phone stopped ringing
and she chilled out.&nbsp; She said all of a sudden, she got scared and
ran in my mother's room again.&nbsp; This time the lights were off and
so it was pitch dark in there.&nbsp; She said that my little sister Miranda
said "Keisha, are you scared of that devil on the dresser over there."
Now, my sister was very young at the time, she's 11 now.&nbsp; She was
probably about 5 or 6 at this time.&nbsp; She had no prior knowledge of
what was going on in the house and with me.&nbsp; I''ve never had "Satan"
to contact me again, but I've had experiences that I will tell later.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: davinccichick01@juno.com</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It all started when I was 2 yrs old. We lived in a tralor in Laredo,
Tx. My sister was not born yet. My parents said that I had an imaginary
frind named "bebito". I know that all 2 yr. olds have one but mine was
different. I would play w/ mine. For example, when I rolled a ball it would
stop in the middle of the floor &amp; it rolled back to me. I have no recollection
of this but this is what my parents have told me. Also it was that our
trailor was on top of an old, forgotten graveyard. My mother digged took
a rest for an hour &amp; the hole was coverd again. My father was at work
(school teacher) &amp; I was 2. She once saw a lady in a prairy dress &amp;
bonnet but no face looking at her, someone getting on the bed while my
father was at a game. Anyways I have always seen ghosts. I can even feel
them. Even my sister. Well now we live in another trailor. This time it
is haunted by little girl calling for her mother &amp; father. At first
we thouhgt it was a little girl outside. Then one rainy da!</B>
<BR><B>y we (my sister &amp; I) herd her agian coming crom the living room.
We ran towards there, stood for like a minute &amp; then heard it coming
from my siters room. My mom has even seen her. She has also seen a tall
man weqaring a tall hat, a black overcoat &amp; a beard. At first she thought
it was my grandfather but it looked nothing like him. My sister has seen
him....in her dreams. Recently I discoverd that my dad has seen "him"when
he was little boy. My mom when she was little girl. I have heard humming
in my room at night. It sounds like old slave songs &amp; a little girl
humming. I have also felt my blanket float above me...but when I wake up
it fall back on top of me.</B>
<BR><B>When my mother was working for an elderly woman in her house she
saw a little girl running around. Then later she found a photo of the little
girl. The photo was taken in the 1800's. She never asked who she was. The
lady is dead now.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Furniture????</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: warp10@k2net.cc</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've been reading your site for over a year now and I finally decided
to add my own experiences with hauntings.The story I'm about to relate
occurred in the summer of 1973 and is 100% true. I grew up in a town called
New Vernon, New Jersey.</B>
<BR><B>My grandmothers's sister, Sarah, after years of failing health,
developed Alzheimer's disease and wound up going to a nursing home and
couldn't take her belongings. My grandmother had a tiny studio apartment
in Brooklyn, NY and couldn't take her sisters' furniture. We had a large
house, so my parents agreed to take it. All of Sarah's belongings came
to us. As soon as the furniture arrived, strange things began to occur
and there was always the feeling that somebody was standing right next
to you.(It's hard to explain, but anybody who has had the experience will
know what I'm talking about). I also want to state that while all of this
was going on, Sarah was still alive.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway on with my first poltergeist experience. In our rec room
besides a TV and a pool table we had a huge entertainment unit, that measured
8' long and about 6' feet high, that held our stereo unit.(Remember this
is in the days before CDs).</B>
<BR><B>On the top shelf of the unit was an old broken clock lying face
down and had been there for about a year or so.</B>
<BR><B>The bottom part of the entertainment unit held our record albums.
I was sitting cross legged on the floor, looking through the albums, when
I suddenly heard a noise that, at first, sounded like a heavy cardboard
box sliding across a bare floor. In the next few seconds, I realized the
sound was coming from above me. I looked up and saw the clock slowly sliding
off the shelf. Now, because of the way I was sitting, I couldn't uncross
my legs and move out of the way in time, so I covered my head with my hands,
and yelled "No!" but still kept an eye on the clock through my fingers.</B>
<BR><B>Now for the really weird part - as soon as I yelled No! the clock
which was now falling straight for me, suddenly arced upward and away from
me and landed on a chair three feet behind me!!! (a sight I will NEVER
forget if I live to be 200)!!!! Needless to say, I got on my feet as fast
as I could and ran out of the room. I decided to run up to bedroom. (I'm
not sure why). My bedroom was on the third floor. The way the third floor
was set up was a bathroom, my bedroom, a huge walk-in closet and my sister's
bedroom. As I ran up the stairs leading to the third floor, I could directly
see the bathroom sink. When I got halfway upstairs, the sink faucets suddenly
turned on full blast. I ran back down the stairs and waited outside till
someone came home. Another time, I was home from school, and no one else
was home and I was vacumning the second floor landing, when a wire coat
hanger came flying down the stairs at me, luckily it missed me, but left
a dent on the wall where it hit. My parents finally got rid of all of Sarahs'
furniture and the haunting stopped. So that's my experience. Thanks for
reading and sorry it's so long.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Guardian Angel?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: a_sexton@bellsouth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My experience with the supernatural is more in the way of a protective
presence than a conventional sighting.&nbsp; My first memory is when I
was 10 and had an accident during a field day at school where I ended up
with a concussion.&nbsp; At the time I didn't realize that's what had happened.
All I knew is that I hit my head really hard and I felt sort of disconnected
from reality the rest of the day. After feeling woozy all afternoon, I
went to bed.&nbsp; As I was drifting off, I heard a loud woman's voice
urgently call out my name.&nbsp; I jerked awake expecting to see my mother,
but there was no one in the room.&nbsp; I went into the living room to
ask if anyone had called me and they said no.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards
I felt better and more clear headed and was able to go to sleep.&nbsp;
I believe the voice prevented me from lapsing into a concussion-induced
coma.&nbsp; The experience that really convinces me that I have someone
looking out for me is the event that led up to my visiting my father just
before his death.&nbsp; It was September 1987 and I was to visit my family
in Missouri for Thanksgiving (I lived in Atlanta).&nbsp; However, on Thursday
at work I had an uncontrollable impulse that I had to go see my parents.&nbsp;
That afternoon I told my boss that I would be taking vacation the next
week and I booked 3 airline tickets to Kansas City for my 5 and 1 year
old daughters and me to depart on Friday.&nbsp; My parents lived in a small
town between Springfield and Kansas City so I also had to rent a car. It
was about a 2 hour drive from KC to their house.&nbsp; So Friday afternoon,
I loaded up the kids after work and raced to the airport to catch a 6:00
pm flight.&nbsp; I got into KC about 8:30 pm, picked up my rental car and
started the 2 hour drive to my parents house.&nbsp; By this time after
working all day, traveling through two airports with small children, strollers,
bags, etc. I was exhausted before I started my drive.&nbsp; Logic would
have dictated that I just stay overnight in KC and drive to my parents
house the next morning.&nbsp; However, I still had the overwhelming urge
to get to their house.&nbsp; Finally around 11:00 pm I arrived at their
house.&nbsp; As I am standing on the porch waiting on them to unlock the
door, a rather shaggy dog shows up and starts jumping up and down excitedly.&nbsp;
I looked closely at the dog and as my Mom opened the door we both realize
the dog is Michelle a dog they used to own.&nbsp; There is a whole story
attached to this dog.&nbsp; My parents had gotten the dog from the dog
pound. My mom asked my Dad what kind of dog to get and he said he had a
dream that he would know which dog to get.&nbsp; Michelle was kind of a
shaggy poodle kind of dog, not a beauty.&nbsp; They had Michelle for a
while, but gave her to an elderly man who lived alone next door to them.
Michelle never left his side until his death He had a heart attack and
apparently died next to a creek outdoors.&nbsp; The dog stood guard over
his body and wouldn't let anyone near him.&nbsp; My brother-in-law had
to get Michelle so they could move Mr. Little's body.&nbsp; Anyway at the
time my parents were out of town and another family took the dog. Even
though my parents would have liked to have her back they were unaware of
where she went.&nbsp; Now to get back to my original story. Here was Michelle
out of the blue and she appeared to have been well cared for.&nbsp; It's
now pretty late, I am totally exhausted so I say hi to my Mom and Dad,
give them hugs and kisses, say I love them and tell them that we'll talk
in the morning. So off go the kids and I to bed.&nbsp; I had no idea that
would be the last time I would see my father alive.&nbsp; About 2 hours
later, I was awakened by my sister to say that my Dad had just passed away.&nbsp;
My mom had called her to come over because she was too distressed to tell
me since I had just gotten there.&nbsp; Later my sister told me that as
she was driving over to my Mom's house she heard as clear as a bell my
Dad say bye to her and she knew before she got there that my Dad had passed
away.&nbsp; Oh and the dog who showed up that same night?&nbsp; She never
left my mother's side until she died of old age.&nbsp; You may think I'm
nuts, but I believe that dog was a guardian angel going where she was needed,
first Mr. Little, then my Mom.&nbsp; And remember, my Dad picked her out.&nbsp;
The timing on my visit was such that I saw my Dad one last time about one
hour before he passed away.&nbsp; I don't believe this was a coincidence.&nbsp;
I believe this guardian or whatever you want to call it did me an extreme
kindness by allowing me to see my Dad one last time.&nbsp; I had a similar
experience a year ago when my Mom had a heart attack last November.&nbsp;
I was again having the burning urge out of the blue to visit Missouri shortly
before her attack.&nbsp; Since I visit my Mom every summer and I had just
been there a couple of months prior, my desire to go during the winter
(I live in Florida) is totally out of character since I hate snow and cold.&nbsp;
I can't drive in the snow either.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I kept saying I wanted
to spend Christmas there.&nbsp; Well as a matter of fact I ended up spending
Christmas with my Mom in the hospital. I stayed with her for six weeks,
but I always had the calm feeling that she would be fine even though she
spent 2 weeks in ICU virtually unconscious the whole time. She has almost
completely recovered and lives with me now in Florida.&nbsp; I don't who
or what is looking out for me, but it is a kind and comforting presence
that I sometimes sense out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; Whoever it is,
I'm grateful.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Creature of my Dream</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:liljamur67@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello there. I've read the stories people have told and they are
pretty frightening. But I believe that the most ghost infected places are
in the asian countries. Take Japan for instance. I had a very unusual exprience
a couple of years back. I'm twenty now and this experience happened to
me when I was fifteen. My father used to be in the navy, he's retired now,
but when he was still in the Navy, we were stationed in Japan for a few
years. I like Japan because everyone was extremely nice, but I didn't like
it because of the fact that there was plenty of spiritual activity. We
also used to live in a housing area that used to be on a battle site. It
was a beautiful place... plenty of trees and the houses were practically
right next to each other. They were connected in a sort of way (more like
townhouses). So anyway, it was late at night and I was staying up because
I wanted to read. Sometimes I'll stay up all night long just so I can watch
the sunrise from my window. Well at some point I'll drift off to sleep
for a few minutes and then suddenly wake up and just continue on reading.
Well I was in my usual position on my bed and reading a book and I closed
my eyes for what felt like a second. I had my lights on so it wasn't dark.
But I wished I hadn't experienced what I had. I had closed my eyes and
suddenly opened them because I felt something crawling into bed with me.
I looked over to see what it was and nearly had a heart attack. I couldn't
see exactly what it was but I could see the form of it (in other words
it was completely transparent). It had the shape of small human being but
it was moving much the way a komodo dragon does, scurrying at a fast past.
I supressed a scream and immediately ran toward my door to get out of my
room. But as I pulled it open, it slammed shut on its own. I looked at
the door in bewilderment and saw a hand print on it. Several times I tried
to pull open the door but it kept slamming shut. Suddenly something started
pulling at my body. It hurt really bad because the grip was so strong.
I was a so scared that I managed to pull out of the grip and pull the door
open. I ran to my dads room and saw that he was sleeping peacefully. I
ran to shake him awake but before I got to his bed, I tripped and fell.
But I didn't fall onto the ground, I actually sat up in bed. I looked around
frantically and saw that nothing was out of the norm and then I realized
it was nothing but a dream. At first I didn't bother giving another thought
about it because I was so treid and just went back to sleep. In the morning
though it bothered me a lot and I didn't want to sleep in my room for fear
of it happening again. So when night came, I decided to sleep downstairs.
It was late at night and I heard a hissing noise. I wanted to ignore it
but curiosity got the better of me and I peeped into the darkened hallway
to see what it was. I saw a form in the dark but it was looking down at
something. I think it knew I was staring at it because suddenly glanced
up and I stared into bluish-white eyes. It blinked and suddenly disappeared.
I was scared it was coming after me, but nothing happened. A few months
after my dad was stationed in california. I was relieved to leave the ghosts,
but I was sad to leave my friends. So there's my story, some of you may
think it's crazy, but it's the honest truth and it certainly is something
no one would forget in a hurry, I'm twenty now...and I still haven't forgotten
the creature of my dreams.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pterena@bellsouth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, My name is Terena and I'm a divorced 43 yr. old mother of two.</B>
<BR><B>When I was around 8yrs old, my mother and I were living in a singlewide
mobile home.&nbsp; We bought it new.&nbsp;&nbsp; About 4 months after living
there, we started hearing noises in unoccupied rooms of the house.</B>
<BR><B>If we were in the living room, we could hear noises in the bathroom.&nbsp;
I.E.:&nbsp; Water running, cabinets opening, movements.&nbsp; If we were
in our bedrooms, we would hear the same type sounds from the kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>One night I was sitting on the couch doing my homework. My mother
was in her room.&nbsp; Our front door wasn't locked but it was closed securely.&nbsp;
Suddenly, the door opened by it self, slowly.</B>
<BR><B>Of course, I sat there, terrified.&nbsp; I got mom and she checked
everything. No wind, nothing outside.</B>
<BR><B>Approximately a&nbsp; month later I started hearing a female voice
in other rooms.&nbsp; One night I saw a woman in a pink dress, pre-Victorian
era. Her hair was up in an elaborate style.&nbsp; It was dark in the bedroom,
but the moonlight was coming in and I could see her clearly.&nbsp; She
smiled at me.</B>
<BR><B>Then she vanished.&nbsp; We called a minister who said he detected
the presence of a spirit, but not a bad spirit. He performed some type
of ritual (I was too young to remember) and told us to touch the walls
and say : This is my house, I love it, spirits be gone."</B>
<BR><B>This didn't seem to affect the ghost at all.&nbsp; She was considerate
and did not try to do anything bad.</B>
<BR><B>One evening, my cousin and I were playing in my mothers room.&nbsp;
She had a wooden jewelry box that played music when the bottom drawer was
opened.&nbsp; My cousin and I heard a noise and looked at the box.&nbsp;
Slowly the drawer was opening by itself.&nbsp; It opened jerkily, and then
the music started playing.&nbsp; We screamed and ran to the living room
to get my mom. We were both crying and upset.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after that, the female ghost started making sounds like
she was crying. Before she used to laugh or talk in a low voice. Never
to me, but in other rooms.&nbsp; She stayed and cried for two days after
she had scared my cousin and myself.&nbsp; After that, we never heard or
saw her again</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Experience and other Stuff</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anonymous</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I'm very interested in knowing if I may share many encounters
that my</B>
<BR><B>parents, my friends, and myself have witness to.&nbsp; I also would
love to give</B>
<BR><B>you many of my conspiracy theories and stories that I've heard and
seen.</B>
<BR><B>I'm twenty-four years old and over most of my life I've fallen witness
to</B>
<BR><B>many things and events that most people would only experience once
in their</B>
<BR><B>lifetime or see in a movie.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong I don't believe
I'm a</B>
<BR><B>magnet to the unknown or the supernatural. But man, I do unintentionally</B>
<BR><B>bump in to it every now and then.&nbsp; Let me give you a briefing
of the things</B>
<BR><B>I've heard and seen.&nbsp; For starters my father was an (hush-hush)
agent in</B>
<BR><B>the airforce during the&nbsp; Rosewell deal and he saw things that
a young man</B>
<BR><B>(during the late 1940s or early 1950s) should have never seen.&nbsp;
I know what</B>
<BR><B>you're thinking that my dad's pretty old by now but hey what can
I say my</B>
<BR><B>mom is a freak she digs older, much older men.&nbsp; Anyways that's
totally</B>
<BR><B>besides the point.&nbsp; Oh yea, as for my mom, she was born in
a little town in</B>
<BR><B>Mexico, very infamous for it's early witchhunt trials, crazy witches,</B>
<BR><B>spooky (yet weirdly peaceful) cemetery and paranormal sightings.&nbsp;
The deal</B>
<BR><B>with this town is that I've seen freaked-out-hair turning white
stuff that</B>
<BR><B>gave me insomnia for three in half years.&nbsp; When I got back
to sleep again</B>
<BR><B>and would sleep walk and talk alot but I mean a whole lot.&nbsp;
Being born half</B>
<BR><B>Mexican, my race and&nbsp; household are very superstitious. If
people would</B>
<BR><B>walk or talk in one's sleep, they're gifted in sense with the paranormal
or</B>
<BR><B>just plain CRA-ZY.&nbsp; I've been told that it's both.&nbsp; In
my opinion, sleep</B>
<BR><B>actions (that's what I'll call it for now) happens to everyone but
to</B>
<BR><B>others it happens more often than normal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well back
to the little town,</B>
<BR><B>I've taken a few of my friends there and each had their own unusual</B>
<BR><B>experiences in my great-grandmother's house and in the town itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
At</B>
<BR><B>first it scared the bleep out of them but those freaks still go
back on</B>
<BR><B>their own and stay at the local hotel.&nbsp; Well I really don't
want to bore</B>
<BR><B>you, if I am in fact doing so, but if you're interested let me know.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>would love to share many stories and my conclusive theories of many
famous</B>
<BR><B>world-known stories to you.&nbsp; Oh yea and if you do decide I
would really</B>
<BR><B>appreciate if you would not use my real name.&nbsp; You see I promised
my dad</B>
<BR><B>(the former United States Government Airforce Agent) that if I would
ever</B>
<BR><B>tell his tales that I wouldn't say his name.&nbsp; We have different
last names</B>
<BR><B>but still I promised him and I would appreciate it if you would
honor that.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I almost forgot to mention that I live in a border city next
to Mexico and</B>
<BR><B>I really hope I can be of some good asset to you there's so many
Mexican</B>
<BR><B>folklore.&nbsp; I can also say that living here we heard and some
even witness</B>
<BR><B>many body possessed excorcisms and witchcraft rituals.&nbsp; Please

<P><B>The Running Children</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Bearbruno6@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Some years ago, a friend of mine from college told me of a house
that she shared with her mother and sister. It seems that one evening,
just a few months after they moved in, they had started hearing noises,
as if someone were trying to get in through the window. Well, being that
it was three women alone, they were scared even though my friend was very
capable of taking care of herself (she'd kept a Louisville slugger by her
bed since she was a teenager).</B>
<BR><B>Nevertheless, they contacted the police and had them come out and
check the grounds. They came and found no signs of a trespasser. Thinking
they had nothing more than some overreacting females, the police went on
their way. Two nights later, again, just as they were going to sleep, my
friend heard a scream and then the sound of barefoot running down the hall.
She grabbed her bat and raced to the hallway only to find her mother and
sister standing by their doors, each looking for the source of the commotion..
The hall light was off and when they turned it on only to find the window
at the end of the hallway opened. On closer inspection, they noticed no
sign of forced entry or footprints outside.</B>
<BR><B>This went on for three more weeks, when after much searching in
the local library, my friend found the original family that owned the house.
It seemed that a man, his wife and their two daughters lived there. One
night the parents got a baby-sitter for their girls, both of which were
between the ages of five and seven, and went out for the night. At that
time there were woods where the current shopping center is and all the
property lines ended there. According to what she found in the archives,
sometime during the night, an intruder broke in, raped and killed the baby-sitter
and from what officials gathered at the time, chased the children to the
woods where he killed them.</B>
<BR><B>After somemore searching, my friend found someone who lived in the
area since childhood. This person told her that she was not the only one
to ask about the children. It seems that families that who had come and
gone had experienced the same thing, but, only those whose children were
only female. The killer was never caught, and some people had even spoke
of seeing two children running at night, dressed in nightgowns, at the
shopping center where once were the woods. Needless to say, my friend moved.
I often wondered if maybe, these two children are trying to show someone
a clue. Problem is, they always vanished when they got to the end of a
certain alleyway.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Been There Done That</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: zano77@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B>My whole family basically has experienced paranormal things. It
started</B>
<BR><B>with me when I was in my mid teens. I was going to get up one morning</B>
<BR><B>and was thrown down by a spirit (demon) that whispered in my right
ear,</B>
<BR><B>" believe in evil for only in evil shall", and I have shut out the
rest.</B>
<BR><B>My mother told me to go up to our church, so I did, I stood there
at the</B>
<BR><B>bottom of the steps thinking, "there going to lock me up." I'm NOT</B>
<BR><B>CRAZY, this happened, and it also happened to two of my brothers,
later</B>
<BR><B>IN A DIFFERENT HOUSE!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day a man I worked
construction in the</B>
<BR><B>past with came up to me and said, "Dave I need to talk to you about</B>
<BR><B>something." What he told me was that what I've described happened
to</B>
<BR><B>him. That plus a kettle exploding goulash all over the kitchen.
The</B>
<BR><B>night my father was buried, my nephew Ricky was sleeping upstairs,
he</B>
<BR><B>was 18. My sister Shari was sleeping(his mother) on the bed across
the</B>
<BR><B>room. She told me that Ricky was screaming to get it off me, she</B>
<BR><B>couldn't see anything but knew it was real and started telling it
in the</B>
<BR><B>name of Jesus, to leave him. AT THE SAME TIME, downstairs my sister
june</B>
<BR><B>on one couch, her 18 year old son Donny across the room on the other</B>
<BR><B>both saw a spinning light in the living room and both heard a voice
that</B>
<BR><B>said "KILL THEM ALL!" My sister ran to Donny, and he was afraid
his</B>
<BR><B>mother was going to hurt him. I have had several different experiences,</B>
<BR><B>water turning on, an unexplained fire in kitchen, stereo ( including</B>
<BR><B>cassette recorder turning on) three times I've heard footsteps here
in</B>
<BR><B>my own home, I've followed them to a dead end room with a shotgun
and</B>
<BR><B>nothing. My son who is now 21's bedroom is next to mine, once when
he</B>
<BR><B>was 12 something started slamming the floor beneath us like a sledge</B>
<BR><B>hammer, I took the gun downstairs, nothing. As a child, my mother
gave</B>
<BR><B>us ouji boards to play with, and she grew up with gypsys and was
always</B>
<BR><B>superstitious and reading our palms etc.. I believe it was the ouji
that</B>
<BR><B>let these demons in to my family. But then, something i forgot,
as a</B>
<BR><B>child of 5 or 6&nbsp; I saw a ghost, and so did other members of
my family in</B>
<BR><B>Onalaska Wisconsin. I saw it (her) standing in the screen door entry
of</B>
<BR><B>our home. That house also had water turning on toilets turning on,</B>
<BR><B>footsteps and such. It's been quiet now for a few months, and I
pray for</B>
<BR><B>good.</B>

<P><B>Oak Alley Plantation</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: navychic18@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>As the owner of this page may have already heard, Oak Alley plantation
is one of the many haunted plantations in Louisiana.&nbsp; My 8th grade
class went to Oak Alley on a field trip.&nbsp; I had lived in a haunted
house for many years, so I know warning signs when I feel them.&nbsp; As
we were walking up the main staircase, which is the "hot spot" of the house
the temperature went from a stuffy hot to a freezing cold.&nbsp; Some of
the students didn't feel the temperature change, but some of the students
and I felt it.&nbsp; Then the employees told us all the stories of their
own experiences.&nbsp; They would hear their names being called.&nbsp;
The temperatures would fluctuate in the house, and a the ghosts of a young
boy and a young girl would sometimes be sighted at the top of the stairs.&nbsp;
There is a headless mannequin on the second floor.&nbsp; When a picture
was taken of this mannequin, there was a head on the mannequin's shoulders!!!</B>

<P><B>Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jhill@library.msstate.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been a believer since I was very young.&nbsp; Though I have
never actually</B>
<BR><B>seen a ghost, I have felt them several times.&nbsp; The first time
I remember</B>
<BR><B>feeling what I believe was a ghost, I was about 19.&nbsp; My sister
and her</B>
<BR><B>husband had just moved into a new house and my other sister and
myself spent</B>
<BR><B>the night.&nbsp; Since they had not fully furnished the house, I
had to sleep on</B>
<BR><B>a mattress on the floor in one of the two spare bedrooms.&nbsp;
To fully rule out</B>
<BR><B>a prank let me say this, I had to push my bag against the bedroom
door to</B>
<BR><B>keep the dogs from coming into my room because the bedroom door
would not</B>
<BR><B>shut all the way.&nbsp; So to begin my night of hauntings...Sometime
in the wee</B>
<BR><B>hours of the morning, say around 3am. or thereabouts, I woke up
because I</B>
<BR><B>felt something sit beside me on the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually
felt something</B>
<BR><B>pressing on the mattress.&nbsp; At first I thought one of the dogs
had come into</B>
<BR><B>the room, but then I remembered my bag against the door.&nbsp; Before
I could</B>
<BR><B>open my eyes to see what it was, it was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought
I had been</B>
<BR><B>dreaming so I went back to sleep.&nbsp; After a time had passed,
I woke up with</B>
<BR><B>this feeling of someone hovering over me.&nbsp; My dad is bad to
do that when</B>
<BR><B>he's trying to freak me out while I'm sleeping, but he was not there
at all.</B>
<BR><B>It was just this sensation of someone hovering over me staring at
me.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>thinking it must be my sister, but what would she be doing up before</B>
<BR><B>daylight?&nbsp; To clarify, let me say that I did not open my eyes
during this</B>
<BR><B>occurrence.&nbsp; My thinking was if it was my sister and she wanted
me to do</B>
<BR><B>something, I wanted her to think I was still sound asleep and if
it was</B>
<BR><B>something else, I didn't want to see it.&nbsp; After a few minutes,
probably more</B>
<BR><B>like a few seconds (it felt like an eternity to me) it went away
though I</B>
<BR><B>never heard anyone moving around or moving my bag or anything.&nbsp;
I was to</B>
<BR><B>afraid at this point to risk getting up so I fell asleep praying
for</B>
<BR><B>daylight.&nbsp; Sometime later I woke up with that same hovering
feeling.&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>time though I felt whatever it was pressing down on my chest so
that I could</B>
<BR><B>hardly breath.&nbsp; This time I couldn't open my eyes even though
I tried, I</B>
<BR><B>could not speak (believe me I tried to scream) and I could not move.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>started screaming in my head and tried to&nbsp; jerk myself away
and it finally</B>
<BR><B>let go and left.&nbsp; I just sort of lay there dozing for the rest
of the night</B>
<BR><B>afraid to go back to sleep and afraid to open my eyes in case it
was</B>
<BR><B>somewhere in the room waiting to pounce again.&nbsp; When daylight
finally came,</B>
<BR><B>I looked around my room to see if anything had been moved, and everything</B>
<BR><B>was as it should be, including my bag pressed against the door.&nbsp;
I was ready</B>
<BR><B>to brush off the experience as a dream or something akin to it.&nbsp;
But when I</B>
<BR><B>went into the kitchen I began (jokingly) telling my sister about
it, and she</B>
<BR><B>said that that was strange because around 3am. my brother-in-law
woke up and</B>
<BR><B>said he felt like there was someone in the house that shouldn't
be.&nbsp; He just</B>
<BR><B>had this sense that something is not as it should be so he got up
to look</B>
<BR><B>around the house, but did not find anything unusual.&nbsp; The other
two bedroom</B>
<BR><B>doors were shut.&nbsp; I think he must have sensed whatever it was
that visited</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; I know this is getting long but I must say that other
strange things</B>
<BR><B>have happened in that room and the wall that connects to that room.</B>
<BR><B>Pictures flying off shelves for no reason, the dogs barking at that
door, my</B>
<BR><B>niece when she was very young, before she started talking and walking,
used</B>
<BR><B>to stare at that room and laugh or talk gibberish.&nbsp; One night
when I was</B>
<BR><B>there alone dog-sitting, I was playing on the computer and it shut
itself</B>
<BR><B>off.&nbsp; The really scary part is, I think it may have followed
me to MY new</B>
<BR><B>house, but I won't get into that now...</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Battlefield Missouri</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Scooby5881@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; One evening I was taking a walk through Wilsons Creek National
Battlefield.&nbsp; It was just past sunset on a warm&nbsp; summers night.&nbsp;
I was already a little terrified being out in the woods alone but the moon
was bright so I wasn't that scared.&nbsp; I heard some talking behind me,
I just thought it was some bikers or some other walkers.&nbsp; Needless
to say I was wrong, when I turned around there were 2 civil war soldiers
(dressed in gray).&nbsp; I don't think they noticed me or I was to scared
to look back, I'm not forsure which one it was.&nbsp; But they just kept
walking toward me as they were talking to theirselves.&nbsp; As they got
closer that's when I couldn't stand there any longer and I took off running
at full speed.&nbsp; I don't think I have ever ran so fast in my life.&nbsp;
Can you please tell me what kind of ghosts or whatever I came across is.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Early 80's</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened in the early eighties.&nbsp; My
friends and I loved to hike in Harriman State Park.&nbsp; This park is
located in Upper New York state.&nbsp; One early winter afternoon, a friend
and I were hiking on one of our favorite hikes which led&nbsp; to a top
of a hill.&nbsp; The view from the top was spectacular.&nbsp; You could
see all of the surrounding area quite clearly esp. since the trees were
bare.&nbsp; We got there and sat down.&nbsp; We were joking and talking
between the two of us.&nbsp; You know, enjoying the view and the nice winter
day.&nbsp; There was noone around us.&nbsp; The park was empty because
we went there during the week.&nbsp; All of the sudden, I noticed some
movement in the trees directly across from us.&nbsp; This was across the
valley and on the side of the mountain or hill facing us.&nbsp; It was
some distance from us but you could see quite clearly because of the bare
trees.&nbsp; I know that I am spending alot of time on describing the view
but I want the reader to understand how easy it was to see that day.&nbsp;
How can I describe what we saw?&nbsp; It seemed that there were several
people walking down a trail with one woman on a horse. They were all wearing
Indian-type clothing.&nbsp; They were dressed for the winter.&nbsp; You
can see the trees very clearly but they seem to&nbsp; be hazy, almost transparent.
They had their heads down as if they were being careful walking down the
trail.&nbsp; They were going down very slowly and deliberate.&nbsp; The
scene if you can believe it kept happening over and over again like some
broken down movie reel.&nbsp; I don&acute;t remember how long we stayed
there.&nbsp; Both of us stood there watching this scene with awe.&nbsp;
We both instinctively understood that&nbsp; we were watching something
that happened a long time ago and it had nothing to do with us.&nbsp; Later
that day, we went to the local library and found that a long time ago,
there were a large number of Indians living in the area.&nbsp; I wanted
to share this story because&nbsp; we were not frightened. We felt honored
to be shown this sight but sad too... We felt sad because while we were
watching this, we both felt among all the other feelings that we had that
day, the group seemed to be tired and lonely. Thank you for letting me
share my story on your website.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Gemini5151@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have had s few experiences that have stuck with me.&nbsp; The first
was when I</B>
<BR><B>was seventeen.&nbsp; At about 3:00 a.m one night my dog, Tumbleweeds
woke me up</B>
<BR><B>with&nbsp; loud barking.&nbsp; He had never barked in the middle
of the night that I</B>
<BR><B>could recall.&nbsp; I came out of my room to see him pacing up and
down the</B>
<BR><B>hallway.&nbsp; In the middle of the hallway ceiling was an opening
my Dad had put</B>
<BR><B>in with a ladder that swung down when you pulled on the string.&nbsp;
"Weeds" was</B>
<BR><B>looking up at that door and loudly (the same bark he used for the
mailman)</B>
<BR><B>barking at it.&nbsp; Then he'd whine and run up and down the hallway.&nbsp;
I got</B>
<BR><B>freaked and ran back to bed &amp; under the covers.&nbsp; Eventually
the dog stopped,</B>
<BR><B>but I could hear what sounded like a man's heavy footsteps walking
back and</B>
<BR><B>forth above me.&nbsp; I stayed awake all night unable to move and
sweating all</B>
<BR><B>over.&nbsp; We never did figure out what it was.</B>
<BR><B>The other experiences happened after my son was born.&nbsp; When
he was only a few</B>
<BR><B>months old he'd look up and appear to be seeing something on the
wall behind</B>
<BR><B>me and he'd start smiling at the wall.&nbsp; But there was nothing
on the wall,</B>
<BR><B>not even a picture.&nbsp; I'd get a chill down my spine.&nbsp; This
happened several</B>
<BR><B>times.&nbsp; Then when he was about six months old I was rocking
him as I always</B>
<BR><B>did in a glider chair in his nursery.&nbsp; One night he woke in
the middle of the</B>
<BR><B>night crying.&nbsp; I came in and started rocking him.&nbsp; Suddenly
I smelled the</B>
<BR><B>strong smell of flowers. (it was the middle of winter and we had
no flowers</B>
<BR><B>in the house)&nbsp; It smelled familiar but I couldn't remember
what it was.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>mother had died a couple of years earlier.&nbsp; Not long after
I smelled a bottle</B>
<BR><B>of her brand of perfume and realized that was the smell I was smelling.</B>
<BR><B>We had a room in our house we called "gramma's room" because when
my</B>
<BR><B>husband's parents came they'd stay there.&nbsp; My parents' (both
deceased)</B>
<BR><B>pictures were on display in there and I would show my son the pictures
and</B>
<BR><B>explain that my mommy and daddy were in heaven.&nbsp; He was two
and a half when</B>
<BR><B>we flew to my brother's house in Philadelphia for Christmas.&nbsp;
We were sitting</B>
<BR><B>in our seats when my son looked up near the ceiling and pointed
and said,</B>
<BR><B>"mommy, that's your mommy".&nbsp; I looked around thinking maybe
there was someone</B>
<BR><B>there but no one was turned so he could see them.&nbsp; Later, back
home, when we</B>
<BR><B>were in "gramma's room", he went to the picture and said, Mommy,
I saw your</B>
<BR><B>mommy on the airplane.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Cat Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: christine@memflow.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We routinely have cat ghost guests in our home.&nbsp; There have
been many</B>
<BR><B>of them of every size, type and color.&nbsp; All four of us have
seen them</B>
<BR><B>and have often found ourselves stepping around them or over them
to</B>
<BR><B>avoid tripping&nbsp; over them.&nbsp; We have always had conversations
like,</B>
<BR><B>"By the way, we have a white, long hair here now."&nbsp; "Yeah,
I saw it</B>
<BR><B>this morning."&nbsp; We have cats of our own and dogs, too - - but
have</B>
<BR><B>only seen cat ghosts during the past 18 years.&nbsp; They don't
stay too</B>
<BR><B>long and we are not continually 'visited' - but it is not unusual
to</B>
<BR><B>have at least one.</B>
<BR><B>In our previous house we had only one ghost - a human male, rather</B>
<BR><B>short, dressed all in black with a wide-rimmed black hat.&nbsp;
He would</B>
<BR><B>lock and unlock doors; I can't begin to tell you how many times
I</B>
<BR><B>would come downstairs in the morning to find the front door standing</B>
<BR><B>open -&nbsp; the same door that I had locked, &amp; deadbolted just
before</B>
<BR><B>going to bed the night before.&nbsp; He would turn on lights; we
had the</B>
<BR><B>old push-button type lights for the stairway ceiling light - - while</B>
<BR><B>we were all sitting in the livingroom we would hear the snap of
the</B>
<BR><B>light button being depressed and, sure enough, the lights would
be</B>
<BR><B>on!!&nbsp; He would take things;&nbsp; there was a closet in the
diningroom</B>
<BR><B>that was under the stairway to the upstairs.&nbsp; This closet was
ALWAYS</B>
<BR><B>cold - even on the 90+ degree days of summer.&nbsp; When we moved
out we</B>
<BR><B>found a stash of "lost" items way in the back, under the bottom
step.</B>
<BR><B>He somehow made my children ill; ear infection after ear infection,</B>
<BR><B>bacterial spinal meningitis, bronchitis - - continually.&nbsp; I
could</B>
<BR><B>feel him standing behind me and if I would turn quickly I would
see</B>
<BR><B>him as he lowered his face so I would not see it.&nbsp; We talked
to him</B>
<BR><B>all of the time telling him to "stop it" when he was doing his light</B>
<BR><B>and door tricks; yelling at him to leave the children alone; we
told</B>
<BR><B>him he could stay if he wouldn't hurt anyone.......not exactly what
I</B>
<BR><B>would do today.&nbsp; He did not move with us.&nbsp; I am glad!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Great Grandmother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:sts@rica.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My true ghost story goes back along time ago. My Great Grandmother
was having a dinner party. Her husband was a police man. They had the entire
police force over for that dinner party. After the dinner was over my Great
Grandmother had told the police force a story about the house they lived
in. The story was that a insane killer used to live in the house. His favorite
murder wepon was a knife. My Great Grandmother finished her story. Not
10 seconds after the story ended my Great Grandmother was lifted into the
air by some unknown force. She was stabbed a number of times then she was
dropped. She of course died immediatly. After that story was told a lot
of people have died the same way. Most people think that the story unlocked
the psycho's&nbsp; spirit from a cage so that he could kill again, but
perhaps we will never know.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi! I'm Ashlee and I'm 14 years old. Me and my friend Judy</B>
<BR><B>were walking through our town (Calgary,Alberta,Canada) when we heard</B>
<BR><B>someone laughing behind us. We turned around and no one was there.
We got</B>
<BR><B>to seven eleven to get some slurpee's and when we walked out we
seen two</B>
<BR><B>teen-age boys laughing, the same laugh we heard earlier. We walked
over</B>
<BR><B>to them, and in thin air they just disappeared! We got really excited</B>
<BR><B>cause we love spooky stuff like that. We ran back to her house and</B>
<BR><B>grabbed two video camera's and two regular camera's and went back
later</B>
<BR><B>on that night. We took pictures and when they came back, developed,
there</B>
<BR><B>was strange orb's and heavy mists. We also recorded the two boys
ridding</B>
<BR><B>on two skateboards. We went to one of our close friends who happens
to be</B>
<BR><B>a paranormal expert and showed her our pictures and the tape. She
told us</B>
<BR><B>who the two boys were. At the begining of the school year the two
boys</B>
<BR><B>were killed in seven eleven during a robbery. Judy and I aren't
the</B>
<BR><B>coolest girls in school, and those two always laughed at us on our
way</B>
<BR><B>home. We just want them to rest in peace.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Some time ago I wrote to you and told you about a child's foot print
that I</B>
<BR><B>saw in&nbsp; a very old cemetary in&nbsp; Oregon.&nbsp; The cemetary
is in a wheatfield,</B>
<BR><B>rural area that is not visited or maintained regularly.&nbsp; It
is off by itself</B>
<BR><B>and has not homes&nbsp; in sight. You graciously wrote back to me.&nbsp;
I therefore</B>
<BR><B>wanted to tell you that there is now more to the story.</B>
<BR><B>I felt compelled in August to visit the cemetary once more.&nbsp;
I felt once</B>
<BR><B>more, drawn to that area, but would not go by myself.&nbsp; I had
a freind that</B>
<BR><B>came from Idaho and we visited, with our husbands, the site where
I had seen</B>
<BR><B>the small footprint in the mud.&nbsp; This time, however, there
was a startling</B>
<BR><B>discovery.&nbsp; Someone had&nbsp; dug up the grave.&nbsp; Next
to the open grave site was a</B>
<BR><B>glass top casket and laying next to it was an old world knitted
bootie and</B>
<BR><B>skull cap ( obviously&nbsp; made with love)&nbsp; and delicate casket
hinges and&nbsp; ro</B>
<BR><B>our&nbsp; horror, a fragile little rib bone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The authorities
have still not</B>
<BR><B>found who desecrated the grave, but a Lutheran minister reconsecrated
the</B>
<BR><B>grave.</B>
<BR><B>I believe that for whatever reason, we were led there.</B>
<BR><B>I never plan to go there again and have peace that what needed to
be done was</B>
<BR><B>completed.</B>

<P><B>When I was about 3 when my Great-Grandmother Emmy lou died.&nbsp;
She was always in love with dogs.&nbsp; When I first moved, I had 2 dogs.&nbsp;
Hazel and Mookie.&nbsp; When we would go to bed at night, sometimes we
would hear a little whisper, as if someone was trying to calm down the
dogs.&nbsp; I thought it was pretty creapy because everyone one would be
sleeping.&nbsp; So one night I decided to go down stairs and see what it
was.&nbsp; When I got down there, my dogs were sitting in the middle of
the living room as if someone were petting them.&nbsp; I didnt hear the
voice any more but I felt a presence in the room.&nbsp; Well I thought
I was just tired so I went up stairs and went to bed.&nbsp; About a month
later I heard the living room door open at about midnight.&nbsp; When I
started to walk down stairs I heard the voice again and my dogs were sitting
next to eachother as if somthing was there.&nbsp; I finaly decided to ask
my grandmother about all of these happenings, and I was surprised at what
she told me.&nbsp; She said that it was my great-grandmother.&nbsp; She
told me when she was keeping mookie that she would come in and pet him.&nbsp;
Now I listen for her to know that she still visits us.</B>

<P><B>My Ghostly Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kelbell262001@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story is my Mom's.&nbsp; She grew up on a farm in Davisburg,
Michigan.&nbsp; I don't know the history of the house, I have seen the
house and can tell it is old from the foundation.&nbsp; Any way, my Mom
was about 9 or 10 years old, and she had just woke up.&nbsp; It was in
the morning, and she didn't want to get out of bed just yet.&nbsp; So being
9 or 10, she laid on her bed side ways and hung her head down.&nbsp; She
looked under her bed and there he was.&nbsp; He had red hair and a red
shirt and overalls on.&nbsp; He was just playing under her bed.&nbsp; Sliding
back and forth on the hard wood floors.&nbsp; My Mom said she wasn't scared,
but she left her room very quickly.&nbsp; My uncle saw the same ghost while
growing up.&nbsp; He says he would walk from the attic to my Mom's room
every night.&nbsp; They would ask Grandma, "Did you see him Mom?"&nbsp;
She never did.</B>
<BR><B>Now, my story.&nbsp; I have the gift of sight.&nbsp; I don't know
if I have always had it or if I developed it through meditation, but I
do know that I have it.&nbsp; One night,&nbsp; when I lived at my parents
house, it was just my Mom and I home.&nbsp; I was getting ready to leave
for the night, I was about 20 years old.&nbsp; I had decided to change
my shirt.&nbsp; Well, the laundry room is in my Mom and Dad's bathroom.&nbsp;
I went in to the bathroom, grabbed the shirt I wanted, I had already taken
the other shirt off.&nbsp; I was walking and putting on my new shirt.&nbsp;
Now there is a wall that seperates the living room and dining room.&nbsp;
I was just about to round the corner of the dining room, in to the living
room and I looked and there was a silohette of and old lady peering around
the corner at me.&nbsp; I flipped, I ran in to the kitchen and told my
Mom.&nbsp; The thing was&nbsp; I had to past it to get to my Mom.&nbsp;
When I did, it was very chilly, not freezing, only chilly.&nbsp; When I
told my Mom, she said she gets the creebie jeebies in that spot all the
time.</B>
<BR><B>Another story of mine.&nbsp; One night, I was still living at my
parents house, and I had gone to sleep like any other night, around 11
or so.&nbsp; A thunderstorm had started outside, and like I said, I was
sound asleep.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden, I heard crying, laughing, screaming,
yelling, talking and all kinds of commotion.&nbsp; That is what woke me
up.&nbsp; I just laid there at first, thinking I was still in a dream like
state.&nbsp; Well, I was wide awake.&nbsp; I heard someone thell me, this
is word for word, "We only come to you because there is so much energy
in the air."&nbsp; I thought, oh my god.&nbsp; Then, a smack on my butt
came, now I was lying on my side, and it would be very hard for any one
to smack my butt using both hands, as hard as they did .&nbsp; I just laid
there.&nbsp; Then, i told them, "OK, I have to work early in the morning,
could you please stop?"&nbsp; Almost as soon as the words left my mouth,
it stopped.&nbsp; They haven't&nbsp; been back since, although I do wish
they would come back.&nbsp; I wasn't afraid, it seemed more like a relaxed
panic, if that make sense.</B>
<BR><B>Another of my stories...This happened shortly after my Grandmother,
Nan, passed away.&nbsp; I was lying in bed, just staring at the ceiling.&nbsp;
Trying to relax.&nbsp; Then out of the blue, I got a kiss on my nose.&nbsp;
A kiss only Nan would give.&nbsp; I had to feel my nose to see if it was
wet.&nbsp;&nbsp; It scared me, but all I could say was "Thank you."</B>
<BR><B>My stories may not be scary as some.&nbsp; But scary enough for
me.</B>

<P><B>Personal Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: christine.lyle@awc-inc.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, if I tell you about it, it will make it real, I guess --</B>
<BR><B>About 20 years ago, my husband and I were looking to purchase a</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; We looked in the Clarkston/Decatur GA area at</B>
<BR><B>older homes.&nbsp; We found a small house with a large backyard
(which we</B>
<BR><B>were interested in because of my husband's&nbsp; woodworking business).&nbsp;
Went</B>
<BR><B>there with his Mother, Father, he and I and my daughter Jennifer.&nbsp;
We were</B>
<BR><B>standing in</B>
<BR><B>the back yard talking about where we could put a shop.&nbsp; I turned</B>
<BR><B>around toward the house and saw a small, elderly</B>
<BR><B>woman standing on the back stoop.&nbsp; This woman had on an apron
and</B>
<BR><B>was wiping her hands on it.&nbsp; As I looked at her,</B>
<BR><B>she motioned for us to come up to the house.&nbsp; I turned back
around</B>
<BR><B>and told everyone that someone must have</B>
<BR><B>purchased the house and she was waving at us to come up to the back</B>
<BR><B>door.&nbsp; When we turned back around, she was</B>
<BR><B>gone.&nbsp; We went up to the house and looked through the kitchen
window</B>
<BR><B>-- house was still empty.&nbsp; My father-in-law then</B>
<BR><B>cleverly suggested that she climbed out a window.&nbsp; Not possible,
the</B>
<BR><B>woman was at least 80 years old, maybe older.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, my former in-laws and husband thought I was crazy and seeing</B>
<BR><B>things.</B>
<BR><B>I did not know this person so there was no reason for her to appear</B>
<BR><B>to me.&nbsp; After seeing her though, I no longer wanted</B>
<BR><B>to live in that house.&nbsp; I really have never had any interest
in</B>
<BR><B>seeing a ghost.&nbsp; But, I have always thought that anything</B>
<BR><B>is possible.&nbsp; A skeptic, and still one, but I can't believe
my mind</B>
<BR><B>made up this person.</B>
<BR><B>Some years later, I went back and asked the current owners if they</B>
<BR><B>had ever seen anything.&nbsp; They said no.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Mannequin</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: WhisperingFlame1@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband and often take off and go for long rides, never making
any plans we just go where we want to. We have seen a lot of pretty country
and things we might never have seen had we not gotten off the beaten path.
One of our rides this past summer took us to Rexburg Idaho to visit the
Flood Museum and the remains of the Teton Dam which crumbled in summer
of 1977 flooding Rexburg and destroying homes, businesses and livestock.
The residents of Rexburg scrambled up the hill to Ricks College, now BYU
Idaho and watched helplessly as the flood waters roared past them. The
Museum is located in the basement of the Rexburg Tabernacle which was built
in the late 1800s.</B>
<BR><B>My husband and I signed in and began to wander around the museum
looking at the pictures and reading first hand accounts from people who
had survived the flood. The remainder of the museum was filled with things
that had survived the flood. Loving antiques as I do I looked at, touched
and enjoyed everything I saw. As we came towards the end of the museum
we went into a small room where there were more things displayed that had
survived the flood. As I went through the door I noticed immediately to
my right a mannequin, dressed as a doctor, with round glasses on his nose,
standing in the corner, surrounded by old medical equipment, which made
me glad that we have such modern day things now. As soon as I came through
that door that mannequin creeped me out and I got the feeling I was being
watched. I was completely alone in the room. My husband was in the other
room and the curator, an elderly gentleman who had been there when the
flood hit, was sitting quietly up front reading a book. As I walked past
the mannequin, I noticed that it's eyes were following me. I went back
and fourth several times and watched as those eyes followed me. Feeling
totally unnerved by then, I hurried back into the other room to see what
was taking my husband so long. He was just outside the door looking at
some old dental equipment, that made my teeth hurt just to look at them.
When I told him about the mannequin, he chuckled and told me it was probably
just the light. A few minutes later we both went into the back room and
I showed him the mannequin. He looked at the mannequin and said "His eyes
aren't following you, its his glasses." He just chuckled again and went
to look at some other displays. I was wishing that I had a camera when
it dawned on me that I had a disposable camera in my purse. I pulled it
out of my purse and took three shots of the mannequin. After taking the
first shot I took a couple of steps to my left to see if his eyes would
follow me. Then I took a third shot. Satisfied with what I had done I left
the room and joined my husband who was making is way back to the front
desk. The next day I took the film in to be developed. When I got them
back I eagerly opened the package and when I saw the pictures I took of
the mannequin, I could clearly see its eyes had indeed followed me. In
the first shot, the mannequin was looking towards its right. Then I took
a few steps to my left and took the second shot. When I compared the two
pictures, I couldn't believe my eyes. In the first picture the mannequin
was looking to the right..and in the second picture it was looking right
at me...I had only moved a few steps to my left to take the second picture
and the mannequin's eyes followed me. In the third picture, the picture
was shadowed as though someone had dimmed the lights around me, which nobody
had and my flash had worked fine for all the pictures, so I knew it wasn't
because of my flash not working. I know something or somebody is down there
watching all who come, through the mannequin's eyes...</B>

<P><B>True Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ban_griffonking@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was growing up in our home on the east</B>
<BR><B>side, I had always liked playing in the basement</B>
<BR><B>room we called the "Rumpus Room".&nbsp; My sister hated</B>
<BR><B>to be in the room, she said she felt weird.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>room was always cold, colder than normal but it</B>
<BR><B>didn't really cause any problems.</B>
<BR><B>One night when I was a senior in high school, my</B>
<BR><B>father had left town on business and I was in the</B>
<BR><B>house alone. It is a very large house and I felt a</B>
<BR><B>bit scared being alone.&nbsp; I left the kitchen light</B>
<BR><B>on as a sort of night light. I left my bedroom</B>
<BR><B>door open and went to bed.</B>
<BR><B>In the middle of the night I heard footsteps</B>
<BR><B>coming up the basement stairs....my eyes opened</B>
<BR><B>wide and my heart started pumping.&nbsp; I was thinking</B>
<BR><B>'Oh My God someone has broken into the house</B>
<BR><B>through the garage or one of the basement windows</B>
<BR><B>and I am going to die.'&nbsp; I did not say anything</B>
<BR><B>and I did not move. The footsteps reached the top</B>
<BR><B>and then started down the hall to my room. I</B>
<BR><B>watched waiting to see whomever it was that had</B>
<BR><B>broken in. AS the footsteps came closer to the</B>
<BR><B>door I noticed there was no shadow or form in the</B>
<BR><B>hallway. The footsteps stopped at my doorway and</B>
<BR><B>all of a sudden the room went icy cold.&nbsp; I knew</B>
<BR><B>right away that I was not alone for I could sense</B>
<BR><B>a presence in the room with me. Then a sense of</B>
<BR><B>comfort and ease came over me, I felt that I had</B>
<BR><B>nothing to worry about and it was okay to go to</B>
<BR><B>back to sleep. Then the footsteps left my room and</B>
<BR><B>as they went down the hall to the stairs my room</B>
<BR><B>started to warm up again. The footsteps went down</B>
<BR><B>the stairs and then faded away. I went to sleep</B>
<BR><B>not feeling so frightened anymore.</B>
<BR><B>I had called and talked to my mother the next day</B>
<BR><B>about my experience. She said to me that I must</B>
<BR><B>have heard from the Stevenson boy. I asked her</B>
<BR><B>what she meant by that. She told me that the</B>
<BR><B>family who owned the house before us told her they</B>
<BR><B>had a son who was high school age that had died in</B>
<BR><B>the basement bedroom of an illness. She had sensed</B>
<BR><B>that he was there when we moved in the house. She</B>
<BR><B>told me that he probably sensed my fear of being</B>
<BR><B>alone and had come up to comfort me, she said that</B>
<BR><B>he must like me.</B>
<BR><B>From then on anytime the room became cold or I</B>
<BR><B>felt his presence there I always talked to him. We</B>
<BR><B>moved away in 1983 and I am not sure if the family</B>
<BR><B>who lives there now has felt his presence.</B>

<P><B>I have seen ghosts in a very old mansion in Washington state in a
small town, Longview. Well there have been alot of sightings by people
in Longview like the lady that a psychic said she felt was there and people
mostly see ghosts in the ballroom and on the third floor. Those are also
where I have seen the ghosts too. The ghosts that are there like to blow
out candles and light them when they were just put out. The lady that is
at Solo Mountain Mansion likes to light the fireplaces too.Well there are
alot of other sightings like the dog on the roof or the man on the third
floor. The house used to be a girl's home, then it was a nursing home,
then it became the restaurant and the hotel that it is now. Well l'll tell
more the next time I write to tell more about the Solo Mountain Mansion
and the hauntings. There is also the Solo Mountain Cemetery too.</B>

<P><B>My Experiece at the Daycare</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ahatfiel@rochester.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I would like to share my experience , I am sure what I seen was very
real.&nbsp;&nbsp; In January of 1999 I worked with three russian children
who attended the daycare.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter who was two years old was in
my class and I believe I seen his spirit along&nbsp; with a few others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anyway One evening while driving home I had the strange sensation of&nbsp;
a fire and I got very nervous about my children , I was on&nbsp; my way
to pick them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that night I heard on the
news that three russian children were killed in a fire. Later it was found
out that their father murdered all three , set the apartment on fire ,
then he killed himself in a field not far from the apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I felt so awful and couldn't stop crying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon
after I started the opening shift at the daycare&nbsp; and&nbsp; several
mornings once I opened the daycare up I seen a little boy that I believe
to be peter running in the kitchen area and I followed him and he would
just disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also this is six thirty in the&nbsp; morning
and I am the only person in the daycare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time
I had several children in our T.V room watching a movie and I heard footsteps
out in the hallway and naturally&nbsp; I thought a parent had come in ,
And I greeted them and stepped out of the room and looked&nbsp; down the
hallway to find&nbsp; no one there.&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning I came in and
decided to stay in the front office because I was a little scared to go
in the back of the daycare to turn on the lights.&nbsp; I figured I&nbsp;
would wait till it got a lighter outside then go back.&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon
as I started to sit down&nbsp; A bright flash of white light flew by the
office door.&nbsp; I wonder if they knew I did not want to go&nbsp; back&nbsp;
there and did this on purpose.&nbsp; I figure maybe so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I only seen what looked&nbsp; like peter&nbsp; the one who was in my class
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seen him a couple of times then did not notice anything
connected to him again in the daycare.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also mention
that I seen the ghost of a lady while talking to one of my friends who
worked with me at the daycare.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghost lady simply walked
by and disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't believe my eyes and it happened
in broad daylight , close to eight in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was
the last of any experiences that I have had there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you would like email me to comment on my experience.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Ghost Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Tomboygirl44@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>there is this old cemetary in my city. some graves date back to the
1800s. well i had just gotten back from trick or treating. we got home
a little early so my mom thought that it wolud be cool to go to the cemetary.
I had heard stories about it so i wanted to. when we got there my ex. boyfriend
was walking down that street. we opened the old metal gates to get in.
my mom don't believe in ghosts, but she could have swore that she saw a
young girl run from a tree tward the gate. we messed around and finally
my mom made us go. we were going to chace down my ex. boyfriend and her
gas tank was running on empty. her computer thing flashed, fuel level very
low so we couldn't. but before we got to the cemetary the fuel level was
50 some miles left, and the fuel level very low only somes on when she
has ca.30 miles left. My moms explanation was that when a ghost is near
the temperature changes and maybe the gas became smaller (i dont know the
word) and the computer thought that there was less gas than there really
was. i really dont know but when we left the cemetary her fuel level went
back up. that was bizzare.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Strange Events</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BGhai@uk.now.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ever since I can remember I have been surrounded by ghostly phenomena
and</B>
<BR><B>strange happenings. I have lived in a beautiful flat in West London,
England</B>
<BR><B>all my life (23 years) and in the same house for nearly all of that
time,</B>
<BR><B>except for 3 years which I spent at University. From the age of
about 1 my</B>
<BR><B>mother remembers me staring intently at an invisible being in the
room, and</B>
<BR><B>as I grew up she recalls that I would talk to persons unknown whilst
playing</B>
<BR><B>alone in my bedroom. Strange events begun to take place soon after
my 5th or</B>
<BR><B>6th birthday, when I would hear whispering and see human like shadows
moving</B>
<BR><B>around my bedroom. I shared a bedroom with my younger sister at
the time and</B>
<BR><B>one night vividly stands out in my mind and still scares me today.</B>
<BR><B>My sister had just come out of hospital after a lengthy operation
and during</B>
<BR><B>her stay she was given a harlequin style doll. It was made of material
and</B>
<BR><B>porcelain and was sewn sitting onto a crescent moon. It seemed like
a normal</B>
<BR><B>child's plaything, but that was definitely not the case. My mother
hung the</B>
<BR><B>doll from the top of our bedroom window so that it was suspended
above a</B>
<BR><B>window ledge. My sister and I both fell asleep in our usual positions
my</B>
<BR><B>sister on the lower bunk bed and me on top. Our heads were positioned
at the</B>
<BR><B>end nearest to the bedroom door with our feet pointing towards the
window.</B>
<BR><B>However, in the early hours of the morning I awoke to find myself
turned</B>
<BR><B>completely around in my bunk. I lifted my head and thought how funny
it</B>
<BR><B>seemed, when I heard my sister oddly whisper are you facing the
other way</B>
<BR><B>to? I said yes and we begun moving our pillows and duvets back to
there</B>
<BR><B>usual positions when I suddenly glanced at the window. The harlequin
doll</B>
<BR><B>was no longer suspended from the frame of the window or the crescent
moon it</B>
<BR><B>was attached to. It was standing on its own accord on the window
ledge</B>
<BR><B>moving its head from side to side as if it were 'coming to life
and waking</B>
<BR><B>itself up'. My sister suddenly let out a gasp and said can you see
that? I</B>
<BR><B>said what? not wanting to scare her to. She replied, "the clown
doll is</B>
<BR><B>moving by itself". We both remained motionless watching it in awe
for a few</B>
<BR><B>moments before my sister screamed and woke my mum. I turned my head
and hid</B>
<BR><B>my face wishing it to go away before my mum came rushing in to check
on us.</B>
<BR><B>When we told her to look, the doll was sitting back on its moon
perch as</B>
<BR><B>lifeless as it had been when we went to bed.</B>
<BR><B>That was just one incident that has remained in my head for along
time and</B>
<BR><B>strangely it was my younger sister who brought it up the other day
reminding</B>
<BR><B>me of the event, which I had tried to forget. Maybe we both dreamed
it but</B>
<BR><B>now that would be weird in itself!</B>
<BR><B>I have also been harassed by unseen beings for many years and this
still</B>
<BR><B>happens today, although it doesn't scare me anymore. I have heard
my name</B>
<BR><B>being whispered in my ear so many times I've lost count. I used
to freak out</B>
<BR><B>but as I got older I started to ask what it wanted. I never got
a reply. It</B>
<BR><B>was just trying to annoy me or scare me which I must admit it did
at the</B>
<BR><B>time. I've been thrown out of bed around 6 feet when I was about
twelve,</B>
<BR><B>which absolutely freaked me out and on two occasions I have also
been shaken</B>
<BR><B>violently in bed, and when I looked up to see what the hell was
going on I</B>
<BR><B>have seen a little girl with curly blonde hair and a white Victorian
style</B>
<BR><B>dress strangely smiling at me. Both times I have instinctively panicked
and</B>
<BR><B>kicked out and both times the apparition has just disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>Recently, my fianc&eacute; came to live with me and since her arrival
we have both</B>
<BR><B>experienced strange rapping's, smells and even talking whilst alone
in the</B>
<BR><B>house (which I may add isn't very old). This morning she told me
that last</B>
<BR><B>night she was watching a film in bed while I was fast asleep, when
I</B>
<BR><B>apparently started to twitch and mumble. She said that she began
stroking my</B>
<BR><B>cheek to calm me down thinking I was perhaps having a bad dream
when I</B>
<BR><B>suddenly shot up and raised my fist to her and said "Don't ever
do that to</B>
<BR><B>me again, ever!" This is strange because I firstly don't talk in
my sleep, I</B>
<BR><B>don't have bad dreams, and it's totally out of character for me
to say or do</B>
<BR><B>that especially to her. This shocked her and she also said that
I was acting</B>
<BR><B>strange all night, supposedly waking up and staring at her throwing
the</B>
<BR><B>duvet around and being generally aggressive. She said that she felt
as if</B>
<BR><B>there were someone else in the room with us all night and that I
was acting</B>
<BR><B>totally out of character almost as if I were somebody else! (No
I'm not</B>
<BR><B>mad).</B>
<BR><B>On a separate occasion, we were both talking in the small hours
of the night</B>
<BR><B>when we finally decided to go to sleep. I turned over onto my side
and</B>
<BR><B>clearly heard a girls voice say "Good Night". I rolled back over
to</B>
<BR><B>acknowledge my fianc&eacute; and she also turned to look at me,
but just said "Did</B>
<BR><B>you hear that". I realised that it wasn't her who said it and we
both looked</B>
<BR><B>at each other a little shocked and scared. That morning I took her
to work</B>
<BR><B>early and returned to bed before I was due to get up myself. As
I undressed</B>
<BR><B>and got back into bed I heard a girl giggling beside me. There was
nobody in</B>
<BR><B>the room or the house with me that morning. I was totally shook
up and</B>
<BR><B>decided to just get up and go to work early!</B>
<BR><B>Recently stranger events have taken place, but I'll leave those
to another</B>
<BR><B>day as I think that I have already written far too much for this
page.</B>
<BR><B>Sorry! I hope you too can relate to these incidents. Oh before I
finish, I</B>
<BR><B>am visiting a very old mansion in Gloucetershire next weekend, to</B>
<BR><B>investigate alleged poltergeist activity as I am producing a documentary
on</B>
<BR><B>ghost hunting. I will let you know if anything happens!!!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My True Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Nicole0474@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I should tell you, at the risk of sounding crazy, that...how can
I put this,</B>
<BR><B>I can sense spirits. OK, so I sound crazy, but I have a doctors
not to prove</B>
<BR><B>that I am not. (Jokin) It's hard to explain, it's anything from
a feeling</B>
<BR><B>like someone is in the same room with me when no one is to feeling
like I</B>
<BR><B>have a giant weight on my chest. It doesn't come on will, I can't
make the</B>
<BR><B>feelings come, and it normally happens in places I have never been
before,</B>
<BR><B>and later find out have had reported haunting. For my first "story,"
I should</B>
<BR><B>let you know that I have a really odd memory, meaning I can remember
things</B>
<BR><B>and feelings all the way back to when I was three. I have had many
arguments</B>
<BR><B>with psychology teachers that this is impossible, that what I remember
is</B>
<BR><B>pictures and stories told over time to me, but I have proved it
to my family</B>
<BR><B>time and time again. When I was five, my mother and I went and visited
one of</B>
<BR><B>her friends in a house that I was scared to go into when we first
arrived. I</B>
<BR><B>remember crying, not wanting to go inside, I was just afraid. After
going</B>
<BR><B>inside and calming down, I started wondering off in the house. I
found my way</B>
<BR><B>upstairs and met a little boy and we played for hours with a red
and blue</B>
<BR><B>ball. After a while, my mother came and found me with her friend,
we came</B>
<BR><B>down the stairs and at the bottom of the stairs, they asked me what
I was</B>
<BR><B>doing, and I told them I was playing with the boy. I said the boys
name,</B>
<BR><B>which now I have forgotten, and my mothers friend started crying</B>
<BR><B>hysterically. My mom told me that I couldn't have, and asked me
again what I</B>
<BR><B>was doing, I told her again that I was playing with the child with
a ball,</B>
<BR><B>and she got mad. I didn't understand, but the next thing I knew,
the ball</B>
<BR><B>came bouncing down the stairs. I told them this ball. Turns out
the boy had</B>
<BR><B>died in that house, and I ended up playing with him. The ball of
coarse, was</B>
<BR><B>his favorite toy, and had been lost for years.&nbsp; That was the
only time I ever</B>
<BR><B>truly saw a spirit. We only visited that house one more time before
they tore</B>
<BR><B>it down, I was never allowed to go upstairs on that visit. We never
discussed</B>
<BR><B>what happened after the first visit.&nbsp; Growing up, I never really
knew what I</B>
<BR><B>was sensing. It wasn't till my 16th birthday that I finally figured
out what</B>
<BR><B>was going on. I was having a party, and it was raining hard, and
we were</B>
<BR><B>acting like normal 16 year olds do, when I got the feeling someone
else was</B>
<BR><B>there. For some reason, I got the image in my head that my grandfather,
who</B>
<BR><B>died years before I was born, was watching me through a window.
Not a window</B>
<BR><B>in the room, but a window, if that makes any sense. After that,
I realized I</B>
<BR><B>could sense spirits, but never really told anyone. Every once in
a while, I</B>
<BR><B>would accidentally say something to friends, bout how I thought
the place I</B>
<BR><B>was at the time felt spooky, or say how many spirits I felt. I would
either</B>
<BR><B>get blown off, or someone would pipe up and tell me the ghost stories
they</B>
<BR><B>had. One of my friends houses were so bad, that I was petrified
to go into</B>
<BR><B>certain rooms, almost like a panic attack. The same rooms I went
into, I was</B>
<BR><B>later told, their dog would either refuse to go into, or go crazy
in them. He</B>
<BR><B>later ran away, and was never seen again. My major "ghost stories"
happened</B>
<BR><B>at a movie theater I worked at for three years. The urban legend
behind the</B>
<BR><B>theater was, and I really don't believe to be true, that before
there was a</B>
<BR><B>theater, it was a housing area. Where the theater stood was a house
with twin</B>
<BR><B>daughters. One summer, one of the daughters turned up missing, and
in the</B>
<BR><B>fall, when the leaves fell off the trees, she was found hanging
in a giant</B>
<BR><B>tree where the bathrooms now stood. Some employees and even customers
have</B>
<BR><B>said they have seen a woman hanging in the mirrors in the bathroom.&nbsp;
I never</B>
<BR><B>saw that, but I did have incidents happen in there. I was using
the restroom,</B>
<BR><B>and the toilet next to me flushed, no one else was there, I had
already</B>
<BR><B>closed the building. I got out as fast as I could, locked the doors
behind</B>
<BR><B>me, and the mail slot opened and closed three times infront of me.
Faucets in</B>
<BR><B>the restrooms would turn on and off by themselves. One night, I
had only one</B>
<BR><B>customer in my last set of movies. I sent my employee home, finished
my work,</B>
<BR><B>and waited for her movie to end. She went to the restrooms, and
when she came</B>
<BR><B>back out, she was furious. She told me she didn't appreciate my
employees</B>
<BR><B>trying to scare her. I asked her what had happened and she told
me she heard</B>
<BR><B>this hysterical laughter, but there was no one in there. She thought
my</B>
<BR><B>employees had slipped through a janitors door after playing a prank.
I told</B>
<BR><B>her my employees had left already, then she said it must have been
another</B>
<BR><B>customer, and I agreed with her, knowing that there were no other
customers</B>
<BR><B>in the building. I had doors close in the office by themselves,
tables and</B>
<BR><B>pens thrown against the wall. I felt hands on my legs while doing
office</B>
<BR><B>work, but never really felt like I was in danger. I would turn around
to talk</B>
<BR><B>to people I thought had entered my room, but no one would be there.&nbsp;
The only</B>
<BR><B>time I ever felt like I might get hurt, was one night I was closing
with and</B>
<BR><B>employee, we were talking, and all of a sudden someone said my name.
I knew</B>
<BR><B>it wasn't him, cause I was looking at him when it happened. We walked
out</B>
<BR><B>into the lobby to see if someone was there, and the ground began
to shake,</B>
<BR><B>almost growl. It felt, evil. We thought it might have been an earthquake,</B>
<BR><B>trying to calm our nerves, but the chandeliers above us weren't
swaying, and</B>
<BR><B>they sway with the little earthquakes that no one really feels.
There was no</B>
<BR><B>earthquake that night, and till this day, I can 't explain it. (I
live south</B>
<BR><B>of seattle by the way) Other people had stories there, one person
was</B>
<BR><B>cleaning the carpet by theater two doors after a movie had let out.
He said</B>
<BR><B>there was a little girl skipping and humming around him, he asked
her where</B>
<BR><B>her parents were, and she just kept on skipping and humming. He
looked into</B>
<BR><B>the theater he was cleaning infront of, but no one was there. He
turned back</B>
<BR><B>around, and the little girl was gone, but he could still hear her
skipping</B>
<BR><B>and humming around him. He only lasted at the theater for another
week.</B>
<BR><B>Another person was checking the exit doors at the end of the night,
and when</B>
<BR><B>he walked down the theater to the doors, there was no one in there,
but when</B>
<BR><B>he walked back, he said there were three people sitting in the auditorium.
He</B>
<BR><B>didn't know what else to do, but to ask them to leave. They did,
the got up</B>
<BR><B>and walked through the wall. The theater originally had one giant
auditorium</B>
<BR><B>that was later divided into two. The wall they walked through was
the</B>
<BR><B>dividing wall. He also said that the three were dressed funny, like
in old</B>
<BR><B>clothes. I have tons of other stories, but this letter is already
getting to</B>
<BR><B>long. The theater name is the Tacoma Mall Twin, in Tacoma, WA. If
you want</B>
<BR><B>their number, so you can verify some of the stories, I can E-mail
it to you.</B>
<BR><B>I haven't worked there for a year, but I am sure the spirits are
still</B>
<BR><B>active. Thanks for letting me talk.</B>

<P><B>Unexplained Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Sexylady451@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In May of this yr i got a job with a company that has tour buses...they
had a very nice building, offices and a hugh garage.( 10,000 sq ft ). the
garage being very large and spacious, housed up to 5 tour buses...i was
workin nights there in the office that was attached to the garage..i was
warned a head of time that the buses made weird noises in settling sounds,
air brakes, tickings...normal things a vehicle does after running along
period of time. It didnt take long that i learned these sounds and got
use to them.&nbsp; But the were other sounds in that garage that the buses
didnt make..these sounds were there when the buses were all out on tours
and the garage was empty. There are so many incidents i dont know where
to start..the 1st incident happen when i was alone and in my office..there
are two big over head doors in the garage that are side by side with a
normal door between them... I was in the office talking to my boyfriend
on the phone when this loud thunderous banging noise started...it was like
some1 was beating on both of those doors at the same time and it went on
for about 2-3 minutes...it was so loud i could barely hear him on the phone..My
boyfriend knowing&nbsp; i was there alone and was goin to be there till
3am..decided that someone was messing with me and he was coming up there.&nbsp;
When he got there the noise had stopped...we hung out to about midnight
he was tired and in a corner in the garage was a futon bed put there for
any of the drivers to take a quick nap on....he went out ther to take a
nap till i got off work..he had been out there about an hour and a half
when all of sudden he came running in the office .......and sat down and
was staring at me ....the look on his face was ...he was scared... let
me tell u my boyfriend is no little man he's 6'2 and 230 lbs and isnt afraid&nbsp;
of any human being... i asked him what was wrong&nbsp; ...he asked if i
was just out there tryin to wake him up&nbsp; and i said no....he said
he was sleepin and someone was saying hello and repeating it...he thought
it was me..he turned over and i wasnt there so he sat on the side of the
bed and it got right in his face and said hello...he jumped up and said
good-bye and came in the office.&nbsp; i thought he had been dreaming...but
he was way to scared...he wouldnt go back out there till i turned on all
the lights in the garage..after that happen.. we started hearing things
out there...i would sit in the garage alone..to smoke a cigarette....and
i could hear it moving around it would bang on everything little knocks...but
u can feel its energy&nbsp; glide across the room..almost like a light
sweeping... I finally mentioned it to my boss in a joking matter...that
there was a ghost in the garage,....he looked at me and said we know....we
just wanted u tell us.....bus drivers would tell me and my boyfriend that
we had to be nuts.. cuz we&nbsp; would sometimes sleep out in the garage..
bus drivers&nbsp; not 1 but several different ones&nbsp; had said they
had heard things ....and&nbsp; they would never sleep in that garage..but
it doesnt always make noise...sometimes u dont hear it for days....we always
say that it gets bored and jumps on a bus and takes a trip....they have
a basketball hoop in the garage...1 day the basketball disappeared....we
looked everywhere for it.. then about a week passed we were sitting in
the office the door that leads from the office to the garage was open...it
was about 6:30 am ...there was me, my boyfriend, his sister and another
driver...all of sudden we heard the basketball bouncing...me and my boyfriend
looked at each other and said at the same time whos bouncing the basketball
and ran in the garage...there was nothing there..not even the ball...the
weird part is that no 1 else heard it but me and him and the other 2 were
standing in the garage but at the door. and i know what i heard and i know
he heard it cuz we said it at the same time... They said they heard nothing.
we were amazed.............but almost every1 that comes in there hears
it...my son is 16 yrs old and him and my boyfriend were in the garage...when
that thunderous banging on the doors started again... we all heard it..they
ran out the regular door to see if someone was banging on it.....no one
was there...and the banging still continued...whatever is out there is
not evil or i dont think it is but it can get very upset...&nbsp; and when
it does it will beat on anything it can and will run across the ceiling
u can hear the steps ...i could sit here for another hour tellin u about
more incidents..but its taking up to much room on ur site..i no longer
work for this company but i know people who do...and it is still making
its self known there...we just wonder who it is and if we could help them
find a peacefull place to rest.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Holiday Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: david.lee121.21@virgin.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>About 7 yr,s ago, some friends and I went on holiday to Crete and
it was here that I had i totally weird experience that was also witness
by my friend.We were on a typical Brithish lad,s holiday, which consisted
of drinking followed by drinking,followed by more drinking.Anyway about
a week into the vaccation we decided to stay in have just a couple of beer,s
and play card,s.</B>
<BR><B>Well after awhile we called it a night and went off to our room,s.In
my roomwhich I shared with two others the layout was as follows, there
was a main room which had twin bed,s a dressing table and a coffe table.The
bed,s where situated against the far wall as you enterd the room, from
the bedroom was a small corridor with a door that led to the bathroom and
at the end was another small room by the main door into the apartment in
which was a pull down sofa bed.So two of us slept in the main room and
one in the outter room.After being in bed for some time I just remeber
going from fast asleep to wide awake I looked up and saw someone standing
in the doorway I remeber not being able to make out any features just the
shape of a male about 6ft standing in the doorway,I looked across to the
other bed a saw my friend fast asleep so I just assume that its my other
friend got up to use the bathroom or something, It did seem a bit odd that
he was just stood there but I was tied and just went back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway the next night the exact same thing happends I go from fast
asleep to wide awake I look up and there again standing in the doorway
is the figure I mumble something at it and go back to sleep, at this time
I still think that it,s my mate going the bathroom,that was until the next
night.</B>
<BR><B>The next night we,re starting to get short of cash ,so decide to
stay in the hotel bar,we stayed in the bar untill about 1 a.m then go to
bed, I dont know how long I,d been asleep but this night I was awoken by
something pushing down from the top of my bed, it was like a green mist
the pressure was tremendous I felt like my head was being crushed in a
giant,s grip I sat up only to see my friend sitting bolt uprght in bed
screaming there,s somebody by the door,I know Isaid I,ve seen it twice
already.then my other friend come,s in from the other room shouting who
was that. He reakon that he heard the shouting from the other room came
to see what was going on and thought that he almost bumped into someone,but
then they were gone.</B>
<BR><B>we all sat and talked about it the next day and sat up with camera,s
the next night but never saw our night visitor again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Haunting in Good Old Los Angeles</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: yippekaiyaemf@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ever since I was a child, I have simultaneously been drawn to the</B>
<BR><B>supernatural side and scared by it.&nbsp; The first ghostly encounter
I had was</B>
<BR><B>in 4th grade.&nbsp; I was down in our basement playing with my sisters
when this,</B>
<BR><B>well, thing appeared.&nbsp; The only way to describe it was a filmy,
billowy</B>
<BR><B>fabric blowing as though there was wind.&nbsp; It actually spoke,
and said, "Get</B>
<BR><B>out, stay away."&nbsp; So I did and did.&nbsp; My sisters did not
hear it, but they</B>
<BR><B>saw something.&nbsp; We had just remodeled the basement, and that
was the first</B>
<BR><B>and only time I went down there.</B>
<BR><B>The next occurences were during a period when I was in 5th grade
through</B>
<BR><B>11th grade.&nbsp; This was in a different house than the first event.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>continually woken up in the middle of the night and would hear creaking
and</B>
<BR><B>see shadows moving down the hall.&nbsp; This was constant.&nbsp;
There would be</B>
<BR><B>floating orbs in my room, emanating from the closet.&nbsp; I was
never scared by</B>
<BR><B>these, and never saw anything more than shadows and light.&nbsp;
The figures</B>
<BR><B>walking down the hall were of a male shape, but they were just shadows.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>had friends over and they all witnessed these things and heard creaking
and</B>
<BR><B>whatnot.&nbsp; Perhaps the scariest thing to happen there was I
had woken up in</B>
<BR><B>the middle of the night, not knowing what was going on.&nbsp; Obviously,
I am</B>
<BR><B>kinda disoriented seeing as how it was 3 am.&nbsp; Anywho, my bad
was shaking.</B>
<BR><B>Not like a truck is going by and its the vibrations from that.&nbsp;
The bed was</B>
<BR><B>shaking as though there was an earthquake (and this was in Sacramento).&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>only thing shaking in my room was the bed.&nbsp; It lasted for about
a minute or</B>
<BR><B>so, and succeeded in scaring the shit out of me.&nbsp; That was
pretty much the</B>
<BR><B>end of those.</B>
<BR><B>Right before senior year of high school, we moved down to Pasadena.&nbsp;
Nothing</B>
<BR><B>ever happened in the house we bought, even though it was rather
old and</B>
<BR><B>Pasadena is a ghostly little town.&nbsp; I was only there for a
year, and then I</B>
<BR><B>moved out to college and the dorms.&nbsp; My, this is turning out
to be a long</B>
<BR><B>story.&nbsp; Ok, junior year of college, I moved into off-campus
housing.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>way the building was shaped had the first floor as parking, and
the</B>
<BR><B>apartments began on the second floor.&nbsp; I was on the third floor.&nbsp;
Basically,</B>
<BR><B>right when we moved in, things began to happen.&nbsp; It was mainly
centered in</B>
<BR><B>my room (naturally).&nbsp; My clock would go haywire, the television
would turn</B>
<BR><B>itself on and off, I had these bells hanging on the back of my door
that</B>
<BR><B>would chime at 3 am almost nightly.&nbsp; I would switch around
the power cords,</B>
<BR><B>thinking that it was an electrical problem, but it still happened.&nbsp;
Right</B>
<BR><B>before senior year, I moved apartments.&nbsp; I stayed in the same
building, but</B>
<BR><B>moved into the apartment directly below the one I was in before.&nbsp;
So, I am</B>
<BR><B>closer to the ground in this one.&nbsp; The parking garage is below
us.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>roommate had the room that was below my old one, and starting from
day one,</B>
<BR><B>things happened.&nbsp; However, this time it was in the entire apartment.&nbsp;
(We</B>
<BR><B>think it has something to do with the closer proximity to the ground
and the</B>
<BR><B>fact that it used to be a cemetary).&nbsp; Anyways, the same electrical
things</B>
<BR><B>would happen.&nbsp; We would come home and find our faucets turned
on.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>lights would turn themselves on.&nbsp; It was a rather friendly
ghost.&nbsp; Anytime I</B>
<BR><B>stumbled to get some water, the lights would come on without me
doing</B>
<BR><B>anything.&nbsp; We had two cats that would just stare at things
we could not see</B>
<BR><B>and it was as though they were playing with whatever it was.</B>
<BR><B>So, now onto the recent stuff.&nbsp; I graduated this May and moved
into a new</B>
<BR><B>place with a new roommate.&nbsp; Alright, I am living in this huge
community</B>
<BR><B>thing in Los Angeles, that was built in the 1940s.&nbsp; We are
in a townhouse</B>
<BR><B>deal that is two stories.&nbsp; For the first month or two, nothing
happened.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing at all.&nbsp; Then, one night, I woke up and just felt something.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>never saw anything, but the room chilled and I knew I was not alone.&nbsp;
These</B>
<BR><B>began to happen nightly.&nbsp; I would just wake up and sense something.&nbsp;
Then</B>
<BR><B>there started to be physical things.&nbsp; Once again, there would
orbs flying</B>
<BR><B>around and centering by the closet.&nbsp; I actually felt the being.&nbsp;
It taps me</B>
<BR><B>on the shoulder.&nbsp; It calls my name out.&nbsp; It feels as though
it climbs into</B>
<BR><B>bed with me.&nbsp; I wake up and feel it there, turn over, and there
are body</B>
<BR><B>indentations as though someone is there.&nbsp; The bed moves up
and down as</B>
<BR><B>though they are breathing.&nbsp; My cat just stares up at the closet
and will not</B>
<BR><B>go in there.&nbsp; She will not go in my room unless I am up there.&nbsp;
So, I think</B>
<BR><B>I am going crazy.&nbsp; My boyfriend (at the time) would stay there
and he has</B>
<BR><B>felt something in that room.&nbsp; After he was out of the picture,
I had my</B>
<BR><B>roommate spend the night in there.&nbsp; She woke up around 2 or
3 and had the</B>
<BR><B>crap scared out of her.&nbsp; She saw things flying around the closet,
heard</B>
<BR><B>voices, and felt something grab her.&nbsp; I felt somewhat vindicated
that I am</B>
<BR><B>not going crazy, but still disturbed.&nbsp; She quickly went back
to her room and</B>
<BR><B>will never go in my room alone.&nbsp; The disturbances are always
constant, but</B>
<BR><B>they vary in amounts.&nbsp; It tapered off for a bit, and just recently
picked up</B>
<BR><B>again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>would give them change out of his pocket every time he saw them
and would</B>
<BR><B>give them unique coins that he collected.&nbsp; One morning a couple
of weeks</B>
<BR><B>before Christmas, the year my father died, my oldest daughter, who
was 17 at</B>
<BR><B>the time, came to me with her hand out.&nbsp; She said "Mama, look
what I found</B>
<BR><B>on my dresser!"&nbsp; In her had she was holding 2 Susan B. Anthony
coins.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>said yeah where did you find those?&nbsp;&nbsp; She said "Mama,
I dreamed last night</B>
<BR><B>that Papa gave these to me, placed them in my hand, and when I woke
up this</B>
<BR><B>morning I found them laying together on my dresser."&nbsp;&nbsp;
I didn't want her to</B>
<BR><B>be frightened and I said well baby do you think that Papa gave them
to you?</B>
<BR><B>She said Yes, and I said well that is all that matters, maybe he
did.</B>
<BR><B>After that many things began to happen.&nbsp; I had a large oblong
shaped floral</B>
<BR><B>reef hanging over my loveseat, and my daughter use to complain that
it</B>
<BR><B>pulled her hair when she sat there.&nbsp; I didn't do anything about
the reef,</B>
<BR><B>and she continued to fuss about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there is a large
door opening that</B>
<BR><B>goes into the dinning room between the love seat and the large corner.&nbsp;
So</B>
<BR><B>when I put up my Christmas tree, it was over in a that corner.&nbsp;
One morning</B>
<BR><B>close to Christmas when I woke up, I was on my way to the kitchen,
and when</B>
<BR><B>I came into the living room there propped up on the Christmas tree,
was my</B>
<BR><B>reef.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask the girls if they moved it, and I ask their
father, to which</B>
<BR><B>all of them said no.&nbsp; I looked to see if it could have fallen
off, but this</B>
<BR><B>reef had dried babies breath on it and any time you disturb babies
breath it</B>
<BR><B>will fall off.&nbsp; I looked in front of the love seat there was
none, and in</B>
<BR><B>front of the reef that was so neatly propped up right and flowers
facing out</B>
<BR><B>on the tree.</B>
<BR><B>I could understand that if it had fallen off the wall it may have
either</B>
<BR><B>fallen forward onto the love seat and then into the floor, or slid
down and</B>
<BR><B>onto the floor and then could have rolled, but there were still
no signs of</B>
<BR><B>dried flowers any where between the sofa or the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right around that</B>
<BR><B>time my mother came for Christmas, and I was telling her things.&nbsp;
She has</B>
<BR><B>never been someone to believe in ghost or supernatural dealings,
but she</B>
<BR><B>smiled and said that she believed that it was my Dad.&nbsp; I must
say that I was</B>
<BR><B>shocked to hear her say this.&nbsp; My daughter, same one, was standing
in the</B>
<BR><B>Dinning room doorway as we were talking and she started looking
over her</B>
<BR><B>shoulders from side to side.&nbsp; Then she started saying "Benjy!"&nbsp;
and again, I</B>
<BR><B>ask her what she was doing, and she said kind of perturbed "Was
Benjy just</B>
<BR><B>standing behind me?"&nbsp;&nbsp; I said "No, why"&nbsp; She said
"Are you sure, because I</B>
<BR><B>felt some one with their arm around me and then pat, I thought he
had walked</B>
<BR><B>up behind me."&nbsp; I said "Carrie, no one walked up behind you,
no one that I</B>
<BR><B>saw."&nbsp; She just looked at us and said "Mama, I swear someone
had their arm</B>
<BR><B>around me, I felt it!"&nbsp; she was getting a little upset, my
mother said "It's</B>
<BR><B>all right honey, it was your Papa I think he is here with us."&nbsp;&nbsp;
After that</B>
<BR><B>the back door would open, with no one there, and my girls would
say "Papa's</B>
<BR><B>here"&nbsp; They never thought a thing about it, someone would just
walk over and</B>
<BR><B>shut the door.&nbsp; I had some record albums that I had given my
father, and</B>
<BR><B>never remembered getting them back after his death, and my mother
doesn't</B>
<BR><B>remember giving them to me.&nbsp; I found them all laying in the
floor of my walk</B>
<BR><B>in closet one day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had several old albums up on a
high shelf in a box,</B>
<BR><B>and I was trying to figure out how they got in the floor.&nbsp;
My girls all said</B>
<BR><B>that they didn't get them down, weren't even interested in the old
things.</B>
<BR><B>I called my mom ask her if she still had them, she said yes.&nbsp;
I ask her if</B>
<BR><B>she would go check, because I just found them in my closet.</B>
<BR><B>Now I don't know if any of this is just something that can be explained,
but</B>
<BR><B>it all seemed strange to us.&nbsp; We never did let it bother us,
my girls just</B>
<BR><B>seemed to take it all in stride.&nbsp; My father was a very loving
man, loved</B>
<BR><B>Christmas and my girls.&nbsp; He and my oldest were very close,
and I think that</B>
<BR><B>is why she had so many things happen to her.&nbsp; I have since
moved away from</B>
<BR><B>my house, but my "x" still lives there, so I have no idea if there
are still</B>
<BR><B>things happening or not.&nbsp; My girls still go over there, I guess
I will just</B>
<BR><B>have to ask them if Papa still comes to visit?</B><B></B>

<BR><B>No, we did not stay the night we went during the day and we toured</B>
<BR><B>the house and the grounds. Lance and I were standing there and they
had</B>
<BR><B>this vase with flowers in it almost dump over then it wobbled and
sat up</B>

<BR><B>Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: marcusncole@saber.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My house is haunted. I'm your basic decently
knowledgeable level headed guy with 2 kids living in suburban America,
not a weirdo trying to send you bogus mail- so please hear my story. My
wife and I found the perfect house for us and our children about 15 months
ago, fell in love with it and moved in right away. It's your normal cutesey
upgraded late 50's home with a big beautiful yard surrounded by huge oaks,
etc. and just a great place to live except for one thing- it's haunted.
Our first night in the place( August 26 of '99) was an evening like any
other in a new place. We were unpacked, showered and in bed when I noticed
the feeling. I can't honestly say it was a threatening feeling, but more
an eerie feeling. It felt as if someone besides my wife and I was there
with us in the dark. I brushed it off as the "new place&nbsp; heebie-jeebies"
until my wife said something about it. Our lives carried on though as they
always did until the "incidents" began happening. It started out with little
things like noises, lights going on and off, windows rattling- stuff that
can be rationally explained by attributing it to faulty wiring and windy
nights. I could write all the funny stuff off except the feeling. It was
as if someone was watching you but you couldn't see them. One day about
6 months ago I was taking a shower and when I got out of the shower, the
bathroom sink was running full boar. I found this rather odd seeing as
how I never turned it on and wrote it off as me just being tired and forgetting
to do so. But about 3 months ago I came home and my wife told me she went
to the kitchen and found the same thing: the kitchen sink running and she
didn't turn it on. The same day she told me that earlier that day she distinctly
heard a child say," Hiiiiiiii" in our living room. this freaked her out
because she actually thought it was our infant daughter who was asleep.
But this was impossible because she was only 2 weeks old. I knew that day
the "incidents" could no longer be written off as logical. I've heard the
child too. More recently my wife saw a man standing in our room, went in
to see who it was and he was gone. My son awoke crying at 2 am on Monday
night saying he saw a boy in his room. That same night ( after my son crawled
in bed with me) while feeding the baby in my kids room, my wife saw the
man again standing next to my daughters crib. Neither she nor my son will
step foot in that room anymore. The presence in this house has yet to manifest
itself to me (unless of course you count that shadow you see out of the
corner of your eye that disappears as soon as you look towards it). I don't
feel threatened by it in the least. I don't know the history of our home
but I do know that the corner before our house has claimed a number of
lives. A "Dead Mans Corner" if you will. I love this house, but I worry
about how the these little incidents are affecting my familys mental state.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995 my wife and I lived in Fairhope,
Alabama, a small town on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. We lived in a
very small rental house. It was an old wooden frame house with a metal
roof; according to the landlord it had been built sometime in the 1920's.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That autumn we had begun to seriously discuss
having a first child; it seemed like such a huge step at the time. Around
the time that we began wanting a child I began to periodically have the
feeling that we were not alone in the house any more. While this feeling
was not at all unpleasant in a "creepy" sort of way, it was nonetheless
distinct.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One winter evening after dinner, we sat
talking about parenthood and this future child of ours. The heater was
on, the house was warm and cozy. I was in the bedroom sitting on the bed,
my wife was in the living room in a rocking chair. We were talking through
a doorway. All at once my wife jumped from her chair, startled, and shouted
something that I didn't immediately understand (she had shouted, "I'm freezing!").
At almost the same moment that I saw her jump, before I had time to react,
I felt a sudden rush of cold air sweep around my face. It felt as if I
was, momentarily, in front of an electric fan that was moving chilled air
all around me. Although this rush of cold air lasted only a moment or two
it was unmistakable. I could distinctly feel my hair moving across my forehead
with the cold breeze. With this rush of air was the same friendly, watchful
presence that I had felt before.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately I jumped up an looked around. Intellectually,
I felt compelled to check each window and door. Of course they were closed,
I knew they would be. Most of the old windows had been painted shut long
before we moved in. Bewildered, my wife and I discussed the incident over
and over. She too had felt a sudden coldness around her. The only conclusion
that I can come to is that our boy, who is now almost five, wanted to make
his presence known.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have proof of the soul going to heaven. I lost my Nana this summer
she was 90. We layed her to rest beneath a Blue Spruce tree which we planted
on top of her. 2 pictures were taken, one with myself standing beside the
tree wearing my kilt (were Scottish) and a picture of the tree itself.
It was this picture that an apparition appears emanating from the top of
the tree. Our whole family believe without a doubt that this is our beloved
Nana on her final journey. I have had a few experiences with ghosts but
alas I will save those for another time !</B><B></B>

<P><B>School hostels is famous for ghost if the school is of course old
enough.&nbsp; And my school was around for about 60 or 70 years i'm not
sure now.&nbsp; And of course, if you think about it in the 60 or 70 years
of the hostel exsistence.&nbsp; Just think about the amount of kids what
lived in the hostel.</B>
<BR><B>This story is about my one friend what used to stay in the hostel
because they lived a bit far from school.&nbsp; My school hostel is famous
for its ghost or ghosts.&nbsp; My school is also famous for stealing so
the kids in the hostel should lock their closest with an chain and a lock.&nbsp;
My friend told me this story ones or twice.&nbsp; Here it goes, how she
told me.</B>
<BR><B>One night about 7or 8pm, my friend and her friend was sitting on
her bed.&nbsp; The chain on my friend closest becan to move up and down
like someone was moving it up and down.&nbsp; They was of course alone
in the room.&nbsp; And the rooms what they stayed in normally will belong
to about 5 or 6 other kids.&nbsp; There was no one in the room besides
them.&nbsp; They went to get on of the hostel teachers or whatever they
are called.&nbsp; When they came in the room with the Teacher the chains
stopped moving.</B>
<BR><B>The hostel is of course famous for things going missing out of lock
closets and whereever else.&nbsp; But my friend experience didnt start
or stop there.&nbsp; One night she woke up and her friend and her decided
to used the bathroom.&nbsp; When they came back from the bathroom.&nbsp;
They saw a little girl what must have been about 8 or 9 years old.&nbsp;
They told me that the girl was of course transparent and the girl dissapeard
after a few seconds.</B>
<BR><B>Thats all from what heard from my friend and my friend doesnt stay
in the hostel anymore because she moved away to another city.&nbsp; But
she is of course moving back for some reason</B>

<P><B>Hi, again!! This time a have a short story from all my family(I will
try to make it short) Once all my uncles and my mom, all of them are four
were coming from a village where my grandmother lives, it was a solitary
road and they had to stop in a dark place where nothing could be seen.
They had to lift the cover of the car (because it was getting hot, The
car is a buggy). The person who lifted it was my oldest uncle and the one
who puy the light was my oldest aunt and one uncle(with my mom)stayed in
the car with all the fruits and things they had. So...when my uncle and
aunt entered (remember there was not a soul in the street not even a car
it was at like 3:00 am) they closed the door and in the place where the
conductor is, that is where my uncle drives, a figure appeared!!! They
say, that the figure had a white shirt a black hat and they could not see
his face. The figure asked if they could give him a ride. But my uncles
said, "Look in the back I have two brothers and full of things and my sister
next to me". Well the figure made the cross+ on them at the exact moment
my uncle drove away...and when they looked behind NOBODY WAS THERE!!!!!
After that they where green! and they didn't talk until they came home.
Two of them think it was good or a saint but the other two think it was
evil...</B>
