<H3><A NAME=england>Experiences from England</A>
</H3><P><B>by m.lacher@sussex.ac.uk</B>
<P>
<P><B>Most of your stories seem to be from people in the States.  This is
one </B>
<P><B>from someone living in England.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Apparently I am someone that 'stirs' up spirits where-ever I go.  I
</B>
<P><B>bought a house in Brighton in Sussex, built in 1877.  It had been owned

</B>
<P><B>by the policeman who bought it from new and then his spinster daughter

</B>
<P><B>who died in it.  It was in a dreadful state and took three months to
get </B>
<P><B>one room, the kitchen and bathroom habitable.  We moved in and spent
</B>
<P><B>another six months getting the rest of the house together.  My husband

</B>
<P><B>restores old buildings, making them as they were originally.  We even

</B>
<P><B>took all the old paint and wallpaper off the walls and framed a section

</B>
<P><B>of the original William Morris wallpaper which had been varnished -
they </B>
<P><B>did that in Victorian society in order to preserve the wallpaper.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, once we had furnished the place we settled back to enjoy it and

</B>
<P><B>then some odd things started to happen.  When we had moved in a beautiful

</B>
<P><B>tabby cat had moved in with us - we don't know where she came from
but </B>
<P><B>she was a wonderful creature.  One night I woke up very suddenly totally

</B>
<P><B>witless with fright.  My side of the bed was surrounded with freezing

</B>
<P><B>cold air.  I lay unable to do anything but I reached out for my cat
who </B>
<P><B>slept on the bed and the freezing air started to warm up and my terror

</B>
<P><B>subsided.  After that, I acquired four more cats - all strays who came
in </B>
<P><B>through the cat flap and wouldn't go away - and we would be sitting
in </B>
<P><B>front of the TV and suddenly all five cat heads would turn and stare
</B>
<P><B>intently at one place in the room and then all turn away again at the

</B>
<P><B>same time.  I had plants hanging from the ceiling in macrame holders
and </B>
<P><B>sometimes they would sway violently as if someone was brushing very
hard </B>
<P><B>against them.  A friend came to visit for the evening, went up to the

</B>
<P><B>bathroom during the course of the evening and then came rushing down,

</B>
<P><B>grabbed his girlfriend by the arm and rushed out.  He said he had seen
a </B>
<P><B>ghost on the landing upstairs and he wasn't staying another minute.
 </B>
<P><B>Another night we were sitting in front of the TV with a cup of coffee

</B>
<P><B>each on the coffee table and something/somebody knocked very hard on
it </B>
<P><B>twice.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I do know that the old spinster, whose name was Grace Berry, had died
in </B>
<P><B>the house.  Perhaps she liked having the house restored and made </B>
<P><B>beautiful again and was trying to tell us she liked it that way with
</B>
<P><B>animals in it, as she had had a dog.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time I was at Hampton Court with my husband.  In case it helps
I </B>
<P><B>will tell you that Hampton Court was 'acquired' by Henry VIII of England

</B>
<P><B>from one of his cardinals, whom he felt was getting a bit too wealthy
and </B>
<P><B>powerful.  Anyway, Henry had just got rid of his first wife and was
in </B>
<P><B>the process of acquiring his second one when he got Hampton Court.
 Henry </B>
<P><B>was a man driven by his own needs and invented a conscience in order
to </B>
<P><B>placate his own sense of right and wrong.  He knew he was wrong in
</B>
<P><B>divorcing his first wife but his conscience said it was OK because
he </B>
<P><B>needed a male heir and so he went ahead and married Anne Boleyn but
she </B>
<P><B>gave him trouble so he had her beheaded and married Jane Seymour who
died </B>
<P><B>in childbirth so he married Anne of Cleves whom he thought was very
ugly </B>
<P><B>(he called her the Flanders Mare) so he decided to marry to please
</B>
<P><B>himself and married an 18 year old girl called Catherine Howard.  The

</B>
<P><B>enemies of the family of Howard cooked up some schemes to make Henry
</B>
<P><B>think that Catherine was playing him false and so he had her beheaded.
 I </B>
<P><B>am sorry about all this history lesson but I had to tell you so that
what </B>
<P><B>happened to me makes sense.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My husband and I were walking along a corridor.  We were the only people

</B>
<P><B>there at that time.  I was looking out of a window down on a cookhouse
in </B>
<P><B>the courtyard - my husband was about 12 feet away.  I felt a hard rap
on </B>
<P><B>the top of head and I looked at him and said 'What did you do that
for?' </B>
<P><B>He was still standing 12 feet away examining a painting.  'Do what?'
he </B>
<P><B>said.  It was quite apparent he had not hit me on the head.  We walked

</B>
<P><B>down the corridor and round the corner and came across a guide.  My
</B>
<P><B>husband told him what had happened.  The guide said 'I'm not surprised.

 </B>
<P><B>Catherine Howard ran down that corridor screaming to Henry VIII not
to </B>
<P><B>let her be beheaded as he was praying in this chapel just here.  She
</B>
<P><B>tries to attract people's attention occasionally.'  I was that people
on </B>
<P><B>that occasion.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I moved to a new house 25 miles away from Brighton.  It is in the middle

</B>
<P><B>of undisturbed countryside down a private lane and was built in 1870.

 </B>
<P><B>One evening I was washing dishes and saw a very thin tall old man dressed

</B>
<P><B>in black walk through the wall next to the front door at an oblique
</B>
<P><B>angle.  After that, I saw him quite a few times walking in and out
where </B>
<P><B>there is now a wall, but where there was once the back door to the
house. </B>
<P><B> Then I started to see an old lady who looks a tiny bit like Grandma
out </B>
<P><B>of the Waltons, only taller and with whiter hair.  She keeps walking
</B>
<P><B>through the fence towards some old outhouses that used to be toilets.

 </B>
<P><B>There is a corner in our lounge room that is permanently freezing cold,

</B>
<P><B>even if we have the central heating on and a fire going (we have a
huge </B>
<P><B>ingle nook fireplace that about six people could sit in) but it doesn't

</B>
<P><B>matter how warm the room is, that bit stays cold.</B>

<H3><A NAME=freaky>My Freaky Grandmother Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by trouble@gettysburg.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandmother used to stay in the bedroom right next to mine, and
our </B>
<P><B>rooms are connected by a door. This door does not open because the
knob </B>
<P><B>on my grandmother's side was broken off somehow, so there is only a
</B>
<P><B>small hole there. Well, in 1990 my grandmother's health began to decline

</B>
<P><B>rapidly, and she began to get delusional as well. Often she would speak

</B>
<P><B>to apparitions that she saw on the ceiling. Once, I heard her speaking

</B>
<P><B>to "Rose," who was new on her list of guests. It's strange that we
</B>
<P><B>received word only a few days later that Rose had just died. Anyway,
one </B>
<P><B>day my grandmother told me that she didn't feel like living anymore,
and </B>
<P><B>like the stubborn old Italian she was, I found her dead the next </B>
<P><B>morning.</B>
<P><B>Months passed. The bedroom next to mine, previously my grandmother's,

</B>
<P><B>was now a storage space of sorts. No one ever went in there, really,
and </B>
<P><B>even if they did, they probably wouldn't be able to reach the door
that </B>
<P><B>connects to my room without moving alot of furniture and making alot
of </B>
<P><B>noise. Well, one night at about three in the morning I was talking
to my </B>
<P><B>friend on the phone, and I was sitting on the floor, right in front
of </B>
<P><B>that door that connects the two bedrooms. I began to hear scratching
</B>
<P><B>coming from the other side at the base of the door. Let me tell you,
I </B>
<P><B>was so scared I could not breathe. In whispers I told my friend what
was </B>
<P><B>happening. She believed me, but over the course of an hour, as the
</B>
<P><B>scratching moved up the door and got louder and louder, my friend fell

</B>
<P><B>asleep (I was not speaking at all but I wouldn't hang up). At one point,

</B>
<P><B>at around four in the morning, as I sat frozen and staring at the door,

</B>
<P><B>my doorknob began to rattle and then shake loudly, the door started
to </B>
<P><B>bang and shake, and the scratching ran nearly the length of the bottom

</B>
<P><B>half of the door. My friend woke up and started freaking out because
the </B>
<P><B>noises coming through the phone were so loud that they woke her up.
</B>
<P><B>The noises eventually migrated to other areas of the room, banging
</B>
<P><B>things about, and then they subsided.</B>
<P><B>Have I mentioned that the only other person in the house that night
was </B>
<P><B>my father, who was sleeping soundly? Very, very eerie.</B>

<H3><A NAME=existance>Two Planes of Existence</A>
</H3><P><B>by jerryni@ix.netcom.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a true story.  This is not fiction in any form or fashion.</B>
<P><B>I am a very normal person.  I am 42 years old with a very loving wife</B>
<P><B>and two wonderful daughters who are six and eighteen months.</B>
<P><B>We built our home in 1989.  After a couple of years, and when my

oldest</B>
<P><B>daughter was two, we noticed that she was seeing people that we could</B>
<P><B>not see.  I remember we drove in our basement and on the way up the</B>
<P><B>stairs, Lauren was standing at the foot of the steps waiving.  My

wife</B>
<P><B>asked her who she was waiving at and she told my wife pointing

towards</B>
<P><B>the wall, that woman standing over there.  We dismissed the idea by</B>
<P><B>assuming she had a vivid imagination.  A couple of years later, I was</B>
<P><B>up late on Christmas Eve playing Santa putting a doll house together.

 I</B>
<P><B>had locked myself in the guest bedroom in fear of my daughter waking

up.</B>
<P><B>The doornob rattled.  I looked at it and it moved back and forth. </B>
<P><B>Someone was trying to open it.  I knew it must be my daughter so I</B>
<P><B>quickly turned off the lights and waited a few moments and then

opened</B>
<P><B>the door.  As I walked out the door, I felt a very cold spot.  I

checked</B>
<P><B>on my wife and daughter and they were asleep.  I had no explanation

for</B>
<P><B>this.  </B>
<P><B>	It has been three years since that Christmas Eve.  So now here is

the</B>
<P><B>current events.  My oldest started the first grade this year.  The

night</B>
<P><B>before her first day back to school, we went to bed together</B>
<P><B>at 9:30 in the evening.  About an hour later after we had drifted off

to</B>
<P><B>sleep, my wife ran in the room and asked if I had gone outside.  I

said</B>
<P><B>no.  She said she heard the front door slam.  I heard nothing, but
of</B>
<P><B>course I was asleep.  I went back to sleep and at 11:30 she came in

and</B>
<P><B>woke me up and said it slammed again.  I thought she was hearing

things.</B>
<P><B>The next night she woke up having a bad dream of someone chasing her

and</B>
<P><B>she had cut her arm.  She raised out of bed into a sitting position
and </B>
<P><B>in fromt of the foot of her bed a "glowing ball of embers" as she</B>
<P><B>described it was hovering and rotating emitting a beam of light

towards</B>
<P><B>her similiar to a beam from a flashlight except red.  She ran in my

room</B>
<P><B>and told me.  I thought she was really going crazy.  The next couple

of</B>
<P><B>days she was awakened by the doornob rattling. And the next night as

she</B>
<P><B>lay in bed falling asleep, she heard three hard knocks on the bedside</B>
<P><B>table.  She was too afraid to look over to see what it was.  By this</B>
<P><B>time, I thought she was really loosing it.  The next night, I was

down</B>
<P><B>in our basement working out.  I heard childrens footsteps.  I thought

it</B>
<P><B>was my daughter coming down to play while I was down there.  I was

lying</B>
<P><B>on the bench press with weights on top of me.  I raised my head up,
and </B>
<P><B>I saw a girl, and as she passed by I could see wrinkles on her face.

 It</B>
<P><B>was as if she had turned old in midstride.  I sat the weights back
on</B>
<P><B>the bar and raised up but noone was there.  We hired a

"Trans-channeler"</B>
<P><B>to come and rid our house of these spirits.  She spent about three

ours</B>
<P><B>in our basement.  She talked to the girl.  She said she was sent as
a</B>
<P><B>messenger to help some spirits cross over into the next plane of</B>
<P><B>reality, and there were children involved.  She said she could not</B>
<P><B>elaborate, but she had moved several spirits across to the next

plane.</B>
<P><B>She also said the woman the longer she looked at her turned younger
and </B>
<P><B>more beautiful.  She gave my wife and my daughter a crystal rock, and</B>
<P><B>some sage to burn.</B>
<P><B>	Everything was quiet for a few weeks.  Now we have a thin man who</B>
<P><B>breathes heavily in our house.  Please can anyone give us information

as</B>
<P><B>to how to deal with this.  </B>

<H3><A NAME="night grandmother died">The Night Grandmother Died</A>
</H3><P><B>by rosalie@globalreach.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>The night my Grandmother died.   In retrospect my family has always

had</B>
<P><B>some sort of "psychic" experience.  Family members would often know</B>
<P><B>important information that was not yet told to them. We were the

first</B>
<P><B>to be at a friends side when some tragedy struck. I guess you could

say</B>
<P><B>that as a whole we were very empathetic.  The night my grandmother

died</B>
<P><B>was to be the exception, no feelings were involved but actual sights

and</B>
<P><B>sounds were.  My aunt who lived next door to us at the time, awoke
at</B>
<P><B>about 2;15 a.m. on the morning she died. She was hearing sounds from

her</B>
<P><B>living room, sounds she could only describe as shuffling footsteps,

and</B>
<P><B>they were heavy.  My grandmother in life had weighed close to 300

lbs.</B>
<P><B>and had problems with her knees since she was about 40. Another aunt</B>
<P><B>living in New Orleans at the time, awoke from a nightmare at 2:15

a.m.</B>
<P><B>to the sight of my Grandfathers casket(who died 5 years earlier)

sitting</B>
<P><B>in her hallway. When she went to wake up my Uncle the "vision" slowly</B>
<P><B>dissapeared.Every other of my Grandmothers 9 children except my

mother</B>
<P><B>had some sort of bad feeling or nightmare or vision affect them that</B>
<P><B>night, and all of those woke from a sound sleep at 2:15a.m. the

morning</B>
<P><B>of August 17, 1981.  My mother however was not unaffected.  3 years</B>
<P><B>later, on August 17, 1984 my mother entered the hospital with a head</B>
<P><B>injury from slipping on a wet  floor.  The doctor ordered a sleeping

aid</B>
<P><B>to help her relax.  My mother was afraid to go to sleep, fearing that</B>
<P><B>she would never wake up. The apparition of my grandmother appeared
to</B>
<P><B>her, comforting her and holding her hand. My mom said it was the</B>
<P><B>greatest feeling of peace and content she has ever known.  The nurses</B>
<P><B>notes on my mother from that morning says she finally went to sleep,

at</B>
<P><B>2:15 a.m.</B>

<H3><A NAME="toy store">Toy Store Ranch Hand</A>
</H3><P><B>by danberger.david@centigram.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a local resident of the "Silicon Valley" here </B>
<P><B>in the south end of the San Francisco bay area, </B>
<P><B>where everything is high tech and obsolete after 6 </B>
<P><B>months of life. I was born and raised here, and I </B>
<P><B>am a design engineer. Everything has some </B>
<P><B>level of logic attached to it, or else it doesnt </B>
<P><B>exist. Except this.........</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night about 10 years ago I was driving home </B>
<P><B>from a friend's house at about 3am, on the El </B>
<P><B>Camino Real, a very busy street, 3 lanes going </B>
<P><B>either direction, retail businesses stacked </B>
<P><B>together on both sides for many miles on end. At </B>
<P><B>3am there's not too many people out, in fact it was </B>
<P><B>very quiet, but very well lit. Approaching an </B>
<P><B>intersection, I noticed a man dressed up as a </B>
<P><B>cowboy, with his foot up on a bus stop bench, </B>
<P><B>leaning into it very naturally. The light changed, </B>
<P><B>I drove past him and his eyes caught mine from </B>
<P><B>about 50-100 feet away. As I drove past, his gaze </B>
<P><B>kept up, as if he was staring straight through my </B>
<P><B>eyes, so intense that that image is still burned as </B>
<P><B>bright as day in my memory, as if it was last </B>
<P><B>night. I turned back a few times, and his gaze </B>
<P><B>never left my eyes. I remember saying to myself, </B>
<P><B>out loud, "Dude, there isnt gonna be a bus. Its </B>
<P><B>3am!" There's a lot of people around here that </B>
<P><B>dress like cowboys. (I really dont know why, there </B>
<P><B>are no cows around here) Only difference was this </B>
<P><B>guy had a full beard, the kind that goes all the </B>
<P><B>way down your neck, as if he hadnt shaved in many </B>
<P><B>years. He also had the type of jeans on that are </B>
<P><B>tight in the knees and loose around the boots. </B>
<P><B>Definitely NOT the local "cowboy style".</B>
<P><B>Well a couple years later there was an article in </B>
<P><B>the local newspaper about haunted buildings in </B>
<P><B>California. One of them was listed as a big toy </B>
<P><B>store here in the south bay. The toy store </B>
<P><B>supposedly has a resident poultergeist that all the </B>
<P><B>employees supposedly acknowledge is absolutely </B>
<P><B>there. Yeah right. Good publicity. I had never </B>
<P><B>heard of this before, and I didnt believe it. Im an </B>
<P><B>engineer. Everything is logical.</B>
<P><B>A local psychic, Sylvia Brown, had done a seance in </B>
<P><B>this toy store and had taken many pictures, regular </B>
<P><B>and infra-red. A couple of the photos supposedly </B>
<P><B>had images. I saw them.</B>
<P><B>When I saw one of the images, I was floored. It </B>
<P><B>looked exactly like the guy I saw that night. An </B>
<P><B>image of a cowboy leaning against a toy store </B>
<P><B>shelfing unit, one foot propped up to the side, </B>
<P><B>casually observing the group of people in the </B>
<P><B>store. Full beard, cowboy hat, jeans tight around </B>
<P><B>the knees. And then I remembered something.... the </B>
<P><B>bus stop is right in front of the toy store.</B>
<P><B>History records that a ranch hand had died </B>
<P><B>approximately where the store is built in the </B>
<P><B>1800s. He was sharpening an axe, cut his leg real </B>
<P><B>bad and bled to death near that spot. Hmm. I dont </B>
<P><B>know. But I do remember that guy. As clear as day.</B>

<H3><A NAME=okinawa>Ghost of Okinawa, Japan</A>
</H3><P><B>by curtisc@kic.or.jp</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello, and thanxs for the opertunity to be able to submit some of the</B>
<P><B>stories of Okinawa.</B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>I have so mnay stories about Okinawa, i don't know where to begin.
I guess</B>
<P><B>I will start with some history of the Ryukyu Island Chain. First

Okinawa</B>
<P><B>Island is a few hundred miles from the island of Taiwan and Japan

mainland.</B>
<P><B>It is located in the far west Pacfic Ocean at 26 degrees north and
and 127</B>
<P><B>degrees east. This was one of the largest battle sites during World
War II.</B>
<P><B>It was once and island country unto itself but has been fought over

for</B>
<P><B>centuries by Japan and China. It was captured near the end of the war
by US</B>
<P><B>forces. It remained a US property for many years until the late 70's</B>
<P><B>inwhich it was returned to Japan as a show of good faith. Many stories
I am</B>
<P><B>about to tell concern after World War II.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	A Protective Mother.</B>
<P>
<P><B>		Many years ago, as the story goes, a middle age man lived down by

the</B>
<P><B>China Sea, in an area the US military calls the Gate Four Area. This

man</B>
<P><B>owned a small and some what successful candy store. Every night just

after</B>
<P><B>dusk he would count the money he had made for the day the close up
for the</B>
<P><B>night and go home to him wife and children. One night as he prepared

to</B>
<P><B>close the store and count his money, a young and pretty woman had

entered</B>
<P><B>his store. He tried to tell her he was closed, but she insited that

she</B>
<P><B>must by some candy for her baby (both Japanese and Okinawians love

their</B>
<P><B>children very much to the point of spoiling them). Knowing how she

must</B>
<P><B>felt he agreed to sell her. She bought the candy and then left the

store.</B>
<P><B>The man then put the money down and begun to count all of his

earnings.</B>
<P><B>When he was about finished he noticed that some of the money was not

good</B>
<P><B>currency. Some was the money the Japanese and Okinawians give at the</B>
<P><B>shrines to the deceased. This puzzled him greatly, where did he receive

the</B>
<P><B>shire money from. Slightly puzzled he went home. The next night when
he was</B>
<P><B>about to close for the night the same woman appear in the store.</B>
<P><B>Remembering that she had came in the store the night before, he asked

her</B>
<P><B>if he could help her. She asked for some money for her baby. Again
she made</B>
<P><B>the purchase and left the store, and like the night before when he
went to</B>
<P><B>count his money there was shrine money there. He went home for the

night</B>
<P><B>confused. On the third night about the same time as the other two

nights</B>
<P><B>the woman appeared and ask to buy some candy. This time the storekeep

held</B>
<P><B>onto the money until she left. When she did, he opend his had and saw</B>
<P><B>shrine money. He quickly tried to follow her. He saw her go down the

street</B>
<P><B>and make a turn. When he rounded the corner she was no where to be
seen. He</B>
<P><B>turn to walk back to his store when he heard a small cry. He quickly

went</B>
<P><B>to one of the shrines he had heard the noise from. There was another

small</B>
<P><B>cry. Quickly he had left to tell the police. When they got back they

too</B>
<P><B>heard the noise. They decided it would be best if they opened it up.

When</B>
<P><B>the did they found the corpse of a young woman and a baby, which was

very</B>
<P><B>alive. They took the baby from the arms of the dead and reported it
to the</B>
<P><B>family who owned the shrine. They had informed the police that there</B>
<P><B>daughter while being pregnant. From this time on the Japanese and</B>
<P><B>Okinanians do not leave shrine money, but instead leave real

currency.</B>
<P><B>(Note : It should be noted that here on OKinawa they do not have</B>
<P><B>cemetaries. Instead the have shrines built, much more like tombs, and

that</B>
<P><B>they are placed everywhere. When I lived off base my house was three</B>
<P><B>blocks, 600 feet, from about forty shrines. Some people live between

them</B>
<P><B>or accross the street from them.)</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Highway 12</B>
<P>
<P><B>		This is a story about an area known here by the US Miltary as 400th

area</B>
<P><B>or Ammo. The 400th area is a large zone in which we keep our

armaments.</B>
<P><B>There are lots of roads, very few buildings and tons of jungle. The

jungle</B>
<P><B>makes up over 70% of the area. As the goes, during Typhoon Steel</B>
<P><B>(another name for the battle of Okinawa) we had many Marines here

doing</B>
<P><B>clean up of the Japanese forces. In the area now known as 400th, a

small</B>
<P><B>platoon of soldiers marched down a small road back to base camp. They

were</B>
<P><B>tired, hungry and eager for some well earned rest. They marched down

this</B>
<P><B>road in column formation. Not really trying to be quite because they

had</B>
<P><B>felt this sector was cleared and safe. There was a shout as the first</B>
<P><B>bullet pierced the the silence. They had marched right into an ambush.

The</B>
<P><B>road not being more than a few feet wide and having high slopes on

both</B>
<P><B>sides. The American troops were not much condition to fight or run.

They</B>
<P><B>began to fire back into the jungle. It was a fierce battle, but in
the end</B>
<P><B>all the US troops were killed. Many Japanese soldiers were killed

also,</B>
<P><B>almost three quarters of the them had perished. Many years later the

US</B>
<P><B>government decided to build a ammuntion dump in this area. They made

many</B>
<P><B>roads, and as a security measure which in standard, military police

and</B>
<P><B>security police patrol this area for intruders. The first sighting
was a</B>
<P><B>few years after the 400th area was built. The US forces names each

road.</B>
<P><B>The name of the road was Highway 12. One night while patroling his
zone a</B>
<P><B>military policeman had notice something moving ahead of him on the
road. As</B>
<P><B>he drove down he started to hear gun shots. That is when he saw his

first</B>
<P><B>ghost. Years later, reports from police, security, and workers report</B>
<P><B>hearing gun shots or screams while drivig down that road at night.

There</B>
<P><B>was one reported incident of a military policeman driving through the</B>
<P><B>appartions. Now I tried to investigate some of the sighting here on

island.</B>
<P><B>My friend ,who is a military policeman, took me through is this area

many</B>
<P><B>different times. According to rumors, if you drive up this road from

south</B>
<P><B>to north there is a chance that you will hear something or see

something</B>
<P><B>maybe even both. I have tried and failed so far. But I did find this

out,</B>
<P><B>many people who work or guard the 400th area will not drive alone

unless</B>
<P><B>the car radio is playing. My wife, who works out in the area, will

not</B>
<P><B>frive there alone if she can help it.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My brother and I were sleeping in one bed located at the top of</B>
<P><B>the stairs, on the second floor.  My brother woke me up at about</B>
<P><B>2:00 AM scared to death.  He said that he had awoken to see a</B>
<P><B>dark shape standing over him, staring at him.  He said it stood</B>
<P><B>there for a while, and then turned and walked down the stairs to</B>
<P><B>the first floor.  We lay there awake until about 4:00 AM, when</B>
<P><B>we heard the coffee pot going and movement in the kitchen.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We got up and went down stairs to the kitchen where our mother</B>
<P><B>was up, and very agitated.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother said she woke up hearing footsteps coming down the</B>
<P><B>stairs.  As the steps got to the floor, they turned and walked</B>
<P><B>towards her room.  She thought it was our grandmother.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When the steps got to her doorway, a black shape passed through</B>
<P><B>the curtain in the doorway, and stopped over her, looking down</B>
<P><B>at her.  She said "Begone in the name of Jesus".  The shape groaned
</B>
<P><B>and disappeared.  She said she felt a great deal of evil from</B>
<P><B>the apparition.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That morning our mother took us elsewhere to stay.  It was</B>
<P><B>many years before we spent the night in that house again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story is absolute fact, and has haunted my brother, mother and</B>
<P><B>myself for nearly 40 years.  I am still afraid of the dark.  Although

I</B>
<P><B>did not personally see it,  I know my brother did, and I saw the

shape</B>
<P><B>my mother was in after seeing it.  Two innocents who saw it separately.

</H3><P><B>by rclevlnd@brutus.bright.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 8 or 9 (Maybe older), I was at a friends house in
my</B>
<P><B>hometown</B>
<P><B>of Fremont, Ohio.  We were playing with his star wars figures, and
</B>
<P><B>I noticed what I thought was a black cat.  I asked my friend when</B>
<P><B>his parents had gotten him a cat.  He stated, "We don't have one."</B>
<P><B>He seemes a little agitated at my question, so I went into the hall
</B>
<P><B>and there it was again, right by the stairs leading down to the

living</B>
<P><B>room.  I said, "Well, what is this then?".  When he came into the</B>
<P><B>hallway, it dashed down the stairs.  He naturally didn't see it, and</B>
<P><B>looked even more upset.</B>
<P>
<P><B>His mother was sitting down in the living room, and I called down to</B>
<P><B>her to see if she had seen the cat.  She was extremely upset, and </B>
<P><B>told us to go back into my friends room, and stop playing around the</B>
<P><B>stairs.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was supposed to spend the night that night, but my parents showed

up</B>
<P><B>about a half an hour later, and took me home.  I never really knew

why.</B>
<P><B>I figured I had upset his mother somehow, and she was just mad at me,

or</B>
<P><B>punishing him for playing by the stairs.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several years later, when I was about 18, an event at home got my

mother</B>
<P><B>and I onto a discussion about several things, and she proceded to

tell</B>
<P><B>me the story that to this day still scares me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Evidently, their house had been "posessed, haunted, whatever".  My</B>
<P><B>parents are very religious, and My friend's family attended the same</B>
<P><B>church.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There had been black creatures, of varying sizes, that had been </B>
<P><B>terrorizing the family.  The origin had almost always been the

bathroom</B>
<P><B>mirror, which was right next to my friends bedroom.  They had been
</B>
<P><B>attacked several times.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>What I had seen was one of these creatures, one of the most violent

from</B>
<P><B>what they said.  His mother had called my mother in a panic, they had</B>
<P><B>never appeared to anyone but family members, until now.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I learned that later that week, the pastor and several decons from
the </B>
<P><B>church had gone to thier house to try and exorsize (sorry, forgive
my </B>
<P><B>spelling) the house.  They were also violently attacked, and one</B>
<P><B>person become (possessed) by one momentarily, and they had to leave.</B>
<P>
<P><B>They apparently had no further problems from then on, but everytime</B>
<P><B>I go by that house, I get this sinking feeling.  Like it's watching</B>
<P><B>as you go by.  Or something is watching.</B>
<P>
<P><B>What brought me and my mother into this discussion was odd as well.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had several times when I was at home, alone, up in my room,

and</B>
<P><B>hear the kitchen cabinets open and close.  Sounds of glasses, and the</B>
<P><B>fridge opening.  I would assume someone was home and go down to see</B>
<P><B>who was there.  No one was home. Nothing had been disturbed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, I was in my last months of High school, and came home.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Our house is a two story with a basement.  We would enter the house</B>
<P><B>from the back door, because the garage next to the back edge of the</B>
<P><B>house.  when you walk into the back door, you came into a landing</B>
<P><B>, on staircase hall.  The hall went up, into the kithchen area to the

</B>
<P><B>left, and went down into the basement to the right.  You couldn't </B>
<P><B>see directly into the next room of the basement, the stairs ended</B>
<P><B>above the sub-pump, and the room was off to the left from the bottom.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I came into the back door, I looked to my right as I came in,
</B>
<P><B>because someone looked around the corner, casually, as if to see</B>
<P><B>who was home, and then went back into the basement.  The basement</B>
<P><B>lights were on.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I went up into the kitchen, and my mother was sitting at the table</B>
<P><B>working on a cake.  I asked her who was in the basement, because I
</B>
<P><B>thought it was her.  She said no one.  I said, "well, someone just</B>
<P><B>looked at me from down thier, and the lights are all on."  We went</B>
<P><B>and looked, and they were off.  We went down, and noone was there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I told her about the other things that had been happening in the house,

</B>
<P><B>and she seemed kind of sceptical.  For some reason, she may have </B>
<P><B>thought it was thier creatures, I don't know.  But she told me all</B>
<P><B>about the creatures at my friends house.  I was so upset about</B>
<P><B>whatever it was that looked at me from the basement, that I don't

really</B>
<P><B>know how the conversation got there, it just drifted in that

direction.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But there have been other events that have made me beleive in ghosts,

</B>
<P><B>demons, or whatever they are.  There is something there.  It may be
a </B>
<P><B>natural extension of our after existence.  It may be evil, or the

devil.</B>
<P><B>I don't know.  I have found that if I leave them alone, and just</B>
<P><B>take them with a bit of humor, and a grain of salt sometimes, that</B>
<P><B>I have on the hole been left alone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I haven't had an experiance in about 4 years.  You know the odd thing

is</B>
<P><B>that in the 4 years since moving from my mom and dad's, I have not</B>
<P><B>had episodes of de-ja-vue as often as I would back then.  I know it
</B>
<P><B>propbably means nothing, just an interesting observation.</B>

<H3><A NAME="evil history">House with an Evil History</A>
</H3><P><B>by sburmann@uta.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Here's some paranormal experiences I have had at my grandmother's</B>
<P><B>house.  Maybe you can add this to your Web Site (which is pretty good

I</B>
<P><B>might add)?  Sorry it's kinda long (a lot of stuff happened).</B>
<P>
<P><B>For years, while I was growing up, I never liked to go to my</B>
<P><B>grandparents' house.  Though I love my grandparents dearly (we're

quite</B>
<P><B>close), I dreaded spending the night at their house.  Rarely did I

spend</B>
<P><B>more than one night over there without going home.  There was</B>
<P><B>something eerie about that house.  Two years ago, at our Christmas</B>
<P><B>gathering, I discovered it had quite an undesirable history. </B>
<P>
<P><B>It was Christmas, and my paranormal experiences were confirmed  by</B>
<P><B>several members of my family.  We were talking in the living room

when</B>
<P><B>my mother came in and asked, "Who's baby is in the dining room?"

 Since</B>
<P><B>nobody had a baby at the party, several women went in to check.  The</B>
<P><B>baby crawled in the middle of the floor and faded away in front of
my</B>
<P><B>aunts.  They came back a little shooken up and told me and my

brothers</B>
<P><B>what happened.  We got to talking about all our experiences in that</B>
<P><B>house.  BTW:  There was an infant who died in that house years ago.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandparents live in a big, 4 story house built around the turn
of the</B>
<P><B>century.  It has a large, cement porch on the front of it.  All my
life, when</B>
<P><B>I entered the basement and went to the cellar directory under the porch,

I</B>
<P><B>would get a sharp mental image of a man, blue, and with a bleeding</B>
<P><B>forehead.  It was just an image, and I avoided that part of the basement.

</B>
<P><B>Many years later while talking to my mom and aunts (who grew up in

the</B>
<P><B>house), one of the first owners of the house was involved in the mafia.

</B>
<P><B>He disappeared one day, when shortly after, the porch was built.  To</B>
<P><B>this day, I am trying to convince my grandparents to let me dig under

the</B>
<P><B>porch.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The more frightening experience I had was in my uncle's old room.

 When</B>
<P><B>I was 17, my granparents let me alone in the house for a few hours.
</B>
<P><B>While they were gone, I grew nuts, and decided to confront my fears</B>
<P><B>and explore the big house.  I went upstairs to get to the attic, which

the</B>
<P><B>stairwell is through my uncle's room.  I hated to go in my uncle's

room,</B>
<P><B>even with my grandfather in the daytime.  As I stood in the stairwell,
I got</B>
<P><B>another sharp mental image of a teenager hanging himself at that very</B>
<P><B>spot.  At the Christmas party, my grandma told me a teenager had hung</B>
<P><B>himself in the starewell to the attic.  My uncle also told me,

something</B>
<P><B>would rip his sheets off his bed at night and told him to leave the
room.  It</B>
<P><B>was the teenager's room.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>My aunts and mother also told me there were the spirits of an elderly</B>
<P><B>couple who died in the house that occupy my grandparents room.  That</B>
<P><B>could be why I always felt like I was being watched when I went in</B>
<P><B>there.  These ghosts and the ghost of the baby were frequently seen

by</B>
<P><B>my aunts, mother, and uncle.  I am the only one who has seen visions

of</B>
<P><B>the dead owner of the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The only room I felt safe in was my mother's old room (I didn;t know

it</B>
<P><B>was her room).  I told her I was not afraid in this room and she said

it</B>
<P><B>was her old room.  She blessed it with an angel that she said

protected</B>
<P><B>her.  I believe that angel is still there, for that room provides a

strange</B>
<P><B>calmness and a "refuge from the evil in the rest of the house".  </B>
<P>
<P><B>In all, a lifetime of unpleasant experiences were discussed that night

by</B>
<P><B>our family.  On one hand it fealt good to finally tell someone, on
the other</B>
<P><B>hand, I'm shocked at the bad history associated with that house.</B>

</H3><P><B>by madhack@discover.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>WARNING!  THIS IS A TRUE AND HORRIBLE STORY.  IF YOU ARE A KID OR CANNOT

HANDLE SCARY MATERIAL, DO NOT PROCEED!  </B>
<P><B>The ghosts were playing nasty with me, pulling covers off when I was
</B>
<P><B>sleeping, trying to take the pillow away, ringing doorbells, phone,

alarm</B>
<P><B>clock, whatever.  </B>
<P><B>I could see these dark figures all the time, they would go through
me and</B>
<P><B>I could feel their force, as if a strong electric current would go
</B>
<P><B>through my body.</B>
<P><B>I wanted to get rid of them and I was prepared one night.  I could
see </B>
<P><B>one lone figure,  I quickly rose up, took a long knife that I had </B>
<P><B>reserved for this started running towards the ghost yelling "You'll
go </B>
<P><B>to hell tonight!"  He grabbed my arm.  It was locked, I say, as if
it </B>
<P><B>would have been inside a block of concrete.  I was hanging down, but
</B>
<P><B>his arm would not even move.  I weight 220 pounds.  It scared me. 
He </B>
<P><B>hit me, I felt the world spinning around me.  I opened the door and
</B>
<P><B>started running down the stairs, but he grabbed me and I fell down
the </B>
<P><B>stairs, bleeding.  His hand was squeezing my throat and I was under

him</B>
<P><B>with no way to escape.  I was crying "oh my God, I'm dying, I'm dying,

</B>
<P><B>help me, help me Jehovah!".  After a while the ghost left me laying
</B>
<P><B>there.</B>
<P><B>I had this another incident where I was in the bed and they held my

hands</B>
<P><B>and legs and they sexually molested me.  I woke up the whole house
and </B>
<P><B>they thought I had a bad dream, but they could not explain the marks

in</B>
<P><B>my legs and arms.  </B>
<P><B>Now I just say to them "Go ahead, molest me, isn't that what you

want?"</B>
<P><B>I was soon examined by psychiatrists.  I had no signs of any mental
</B>
<P><B>illnesses.  I did not use drugs or alcohol. </B>
<P><B>I have had paranormal incidents happening to me through my life.  I
could </B>
<P><B>see the future, everything happened like I predicted.  I talked with
</B>
<P><B>these ghosts and they were chasing me around the house.  In 1974 I
asked </B>
<P><B>them why they were after me.  They said "because you were chosen by

our</B>
<P><B>god".  They once tried to poison me by changing my tea into something</B>
<P><B>that was not tea overnight.  I have a witness to this. </B>
<P><B>They want to control me.  They want me to kill people.  They have </B>
<P><B>tortured me to the point of insanity.  I once saw them carrying a

coffin.</B>
<P><B>I stood up and they pushed me to this room with guns and they </B>
<P><B>communicated with me: "We want you to kill these people".  I was

talking</B>
<P><B>with people about a computer game and I suddenly said "I love killing

</B>
<P><B>people.  I don't want to use a firegun, rather I want to finish them
off </B>
<P><B>with a pocket knife and see how they scream".  It just came off my

mouth!</B>
<P><B>They have tried to wreck my marriage.  They want that I'm alone, so

that</B>
<P><B>they can get me.  Actually I would want to be locked up and kept under

</B>
<P><B>surveillance so I don't go and kill someone!</B>

<H3><A NAME="dead here">The Dead Here Still Walk</A>
</H3><P><B>by davidc@westworld.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>The story I'm about to tell scares the hell out of me just trying to
</B>
<P><B>recall it up from my memories, some things are best left dead and buried.

</B>
<P><B>After having read the stories on this site, I think it might help me
rest </B>
<P><B>easier having let others know of the terror I have experienced at the

</B>
<P><B>hand of the supernatural. It all began in 1992 when I moved into a
house </B>
<P><B>in Ironton Ohio, a small town in the southern tip of the state. I moved

</B>
<P><B>into an old house that was over a hundred years old. At first things
were </B>
<P><B>normal, considering getting used to the creeks and moans an older home

</B>
<P><B>emits when settling after the sun sets. About two weeks after I </B>
<P><B>experienced my first encounter, I had just finished watching David
</B>
<P><B>Letterman, and proceeded with shutting up the house for the night.
It was </B>
<P><B>early October and the night air was beginning to get chilly, so I shut

</B>
<P><B>the windows I had opened and went into the kitchen to shut the lights

</B>
<P><B>off. The kitchen had a basement door in it, and as I reached for the
</B>
<P><B>light switch I heard distinctive footsteps climbing the old wooden
steps </B>
<P><B>ascending up from the musty damp basement. I froze and listened as
the </B>
<P><B>footsteps continued to slowly walk up to the kitchen. Up until this
</B>
<P><B>moment I had never felt so scared in my life, I knew it couldn't have

</B>
<P><B>been a burglar or anything like that for there were no windows or doors

</B>
<P><B>in the basement save for the one in my kitchen. Finally the footsteps

</B>
<P><B>stopped at the landing at the top of the steps, and I watched in </B>
<P><B>disbelief as the door knob turned and the old wooden door slowly opened

</B>
<P><B>and slammed shut with an ear shattering slam! I was there long enough

</B>
<P><B>that night to notice that no one stepped through the doorway, I quickly

</B>
<P><B>grabbed my jacket and left to go stay with a relative for the remainder

</B>
<P><B>of the night. As time went on I heard the footsteps and the door open
and </B>
<P><B>shut on several occasions it still bothered me, but I was determined
not </B>
<P><B>to let this drive me out of this beautiful old house. As you will see

</B>
<P><B>this was just the tip of the iceberg as far as the haunting goes. I
did </B>
<P><B>some research on the history of the house, and to my surprise I </B>
<P><B>discovered in 1956 a murder/suicide took place there. As told to me
by </B>
<P><B>several of the long time residents of the community what had happened
was </B>
<P><B>a couple by the name of Gilbert had lived there in the fifties, and
 the </B>
<P><B>husband had caught his wife cheating on him and in a crime of passion
he </B>
<P><B>slit his wife's throat as she slept and right afterward went to the
</B>
<P><B>basement and hung himself. The official record stated that he was found

</B>
<P><B>hanging from the basement beams covered in his wife's blood and the
knife </B>
<P><B>used in the murder lay on the floor below his dangling corpse. After
</B>
<P><B>learning of these events it was difficult, to say the least not to
think </B>
<P><B>about the hideous deeds that this house harbored. About a month after
the </B>
<P><B>encounter at the basement door, I had friends from out of town over
for </B>
<P><B>the weekend.  It was an extended weekend due to the Memorial Day holiday.

</B>
<P><B>This was their first visit to my new home and due to the circumstances
I </B>
<P><B>purposely held back any information on what I had learned and encountered

</B>
<P><B>for fear of scaring them away and it also gave me the chance to get
</B>
<P><B>feedback from an unbias source. Joe and Sheila arrived late Friday
night. </B>
<P><B>We drank coffee and chatted until around 1:00 a.m. and then turned
in for </B>
<P><B>the night. Around 3:30 a.m. I was awakened by a scream. Joe and I found

</B>
<P><B>Sheila in the hallway shaking uncontrollably. After getting her calmed

</B>
<P><B>down, we found that on her way to the bathroom she saw a woman in white

</B>
<P><B>coming towards her in the hallway and in her own words "her throat
had </B>
<P><B>looked as if it had been torn away!". That was the last night they
stayed </B>
<P><B>in my home, I can't say I blame them. The  final event which drove
me </B>
<P><B>from this house happened late one night before going to bed.  I went
</B>
<P><B>through my usual routine of showering and shaving.  I stood shaving
</B>
<P><B>peering into the foggy mirror a figure appeared behind me.  It was
the </B>
<P><B>woman's husband.  I saw an almost blank look in his eyes as if he was

</B>
<P><B>looking past me and his mouth was agape as if moaning a silent cry.
I </B>
<P><B>never ran so hard in my life I gathered a few necessities and fled
the </B>
<P><B>house for the final time. I came back about a week later with friends
and </B>
<P><B>gathered my belongings never to return again. I have been fortunate
not </B>
<P><B>to experience any strange occurrence like that in my present home and
I </B>
<P><B>hope to never again.</B>
