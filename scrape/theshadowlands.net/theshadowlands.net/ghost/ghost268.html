<BR><B>&nbsp; The St. Andrews monks!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: elizabethtudori@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a wonderfully chilling and rather classic (if that can be
said) Scottish ghost experience:</B>
<BR><B>My mother, who was attending university in St Andrews, Scotland,
was walking home from a party.&nbsp; It was about eleven o'clock, on a
chilly November night.&nbsp; It should be noted beforehand that St. Andrews
was, centuries ago, the religious capitol of Scotland, and the ruins of
the great cathedral still stand in the middle of the town.</B>
<BR><B>Anyhow, she decided to take a shortcut to the dorms.&nbsp; Instead
of taking the road, she began to make her way through the soccer pitches.&nbsp;
These were surrounded by spinneys of trees.</B>
<BR><B>As she crossed the fields, she noticed what appeared to be three
policemen at the road at the end of the pitch, where she was heading.&nbsp;
Though not that close, she could see that they wore heavy clothes, like
the Scottish policemen's coats traditionally worn in the winter. She didn't
want to be found by them at that late hour, and went to the nearby trees
to hide.</B>
<BR><B>To her chagrin, they began to move toward the center of the field,
though not directly at her.&nbsp; She stayed put.&nbsp; As they came closer,
she realized that they were walking on the air, about three feet above
the ground.</B>
<BR><B>Furthermore, they were not policemen, but monks in clerical robes.
Two of them were supporting a third in the middle, who seemed to be wounded.
They passed only a few yards away from her, so that she saw them very clearly.&nbsp;
Oddly, thier feet moved very slowly, but they were moving through the air
very quickly. When they came about parallel to her, they vanished.</B>
<BR><B>My mother, mad with fear, ran as fast as she could back to the dorms,
clearing a fence that was as high as her with one leap on the way.&nbsp;
A violent wind kicked up against her as she ran, as if trying to blow her
back.</B>
<BR><B>The next day, she went back to where it had happened.&nbsp; At the
very spot where the three monks had passed near to her, she found three
black cats, eating the carcass of a rabbit that they had just killed.</B>
<BR><B>And another note: The mystery as to why the apparitions were 'floating'
is easily solved- The ground was leveled in order to make a proper playing
field.&nbsp; The monks were simply walking on thier own terrain as it would
have been in mediaeval times- Three feet higher than the leveled field</B>

<P><B>By: jeffthor@tgtel.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Me and my family were comming home one night around midnight and
everyone else had been gone for the night. As we drove by we looked at
the basement door and there stood an older like woman with a white gown
on and her hair pined back. Wondering if i was the only person seeing things
i asked my wife and daughter if they saw the woman and they had too. Years
later i had an up close encounter with this woman. I was lieing in the
bed with my dog beside my bed and a woman whom i though was my life got
in bed beside of me not thinking nothing about it i turned over and went
back to sleep not paying attention at my dog barking and gong on i feel

<P><B>Something Transparent</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: yuske@cox.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well this one is actually an account of something my little brother
saw.&nbsp; It is true.&nbsp; Two of his friends, their mom, and himself
were all in a car on the way home from the movies.&nbsp; They were approaching
the fence that turns into my neighbors yard.&nbsp; They saw something running
slowly and he thought it was just me jogging.&nbsp; Then everyone (and
4 people in the same car witnessed this account) noticed it was a little
transparent.&nbsp; Soon after it just faded away.&nbsp; Now this wasnt
something small that could have just been a trick of the light mind you.&nbsp;
It wasnt just out of the corner of their eyes.&nbsp; They saw this thing
clearly and for more than just a few seconds.&nbsp; After that he still
wasnt sure if maybe it was me playing a trick.&nbsp; He came in the house
and I wasnt even home.&nbsp; I know for a fact that I wasnt because I was
at my friends house when it all happened.</B>

<BR><B>My Family`s Haunting History</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: whiteladyofrohan2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My family has had many paranormal experiences. When my mother was
a child they purhased a house near Martins Ferry Ohio that had some strange
occurences there. My uncle was in his room asleep and woke up in the middle
of the night to find an old woman in a rocking chair sitting in the corner
of his room. He said she told him to get out of her house. My uncle was
so frightened he literally dragged his mattress into my mother`s room and
refused to ever sleep in his room again. My mother and my aunt also saw
the woman and can vouch that she was real. My great-grandmother would also
see a small,black,devil-like creature with glowing red eyes outside her
window at night. None of my family`s pets lived very long in that house
either. Their fish were found dead in their tank one morning,all of them.
Here`s the thing,though,the water was somehow boiling hot. My mother`s
hamster was found dead in its cage too and I`ve been told it looked like
something had maybe scared it to death from the expression on its face.
Also, every night my grandmother would dream that the house was on fire
and they couldn`t get out. After living in the house for six months, they
moved out. The day after they had moved out, the house caught on fire and
was almost burned to the ground. To this day, my aunt still has ghost experiences.
At one of their old houses they would turn out all of the lights, lock
the doors and would come home to find that every light in the house was
on. I never felt comfortable being alone in that house upstairs. I would
feel like someone was watching me when there was no one else upstairs.
And, in the house they live in now, they were in bed one night when they
heard a blood-curdling scream coming from their living room. They ran into
the living room to find nobody there and all the doors in the house unlocked
when they knew that they had been locked before they went to bed. Also,
my aunt was in bed and someone told her that her baby daughter`s face was
covered by her blanket but no one else was home. I swear this is absolutely
the truth. I wanted to share my family`s stories with other people so they
can know that maybe they are not alone out there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Best Guardain Angel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jaskatjad@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Before you read this, My English grammar is not that good so please
excuse this part as I am not very good with it. American Sign Language
is my natural language.</B>
<BR><B>I do believe that my guardian angel saved my life several times.
I do believe that guardian angel is my grandfather who died when I was
6 months old. I was his favorite granddaughter.&nbsp; Let me add something...
He died few weeks before family found out that I was born deaf.&nbsp; I
cannot hear anything not even loud noises.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway at age 7, Mom send me outside to wait for the school bus
and she told me to wait at front step and not to move at all as she is
very paranoid lady and is not willing to take any risk. (unforetunely for
her, I am risk-taker...haha, Of course gave her few heart attacks) Mom
went back into house to get something leaving me alone. My bus stop area
is across the street so Mom wouldn't dream of letting me across it without
her.&nbsp; So I saw a bus coming on its way so I bolted off to go to my
bus stop area without giving a thought on Mom's stern warning. Mom saw
me bolting to run across the street. Mom saw other car speeding down the
road as if they didn't want to be stopped by bus stop signal for me to
get on bus as you know some people don't have any patience to stop for
the bus. I just ran down without looking for both ways as I did not realized
that there is another car coming in opposite direction. Mom saw all and
she ran outside to stop me. In her heart, she knew she was too late and
had no time to run to grab me from being hit by car. So She instead screamed
"Kelley, Kelllleeeeyyyy" despite the fact that I can't hear. I stopped
instantly when I saw old man across the street telling me in sign language
to stop and turn around and go back to Mom. He seemed so solid to me. I
turned around to look at Mom and say "What do you want?" While doing that,
car zipped by where I could have been running and getting hit by that car.&nbsp;
Mom couldn't believe it with her heart at her throat. She asked me if I
heard her screaming for me to stop.&nbsp; I told her No and that old man
told me to look at you. She asked me who is old man and where is he ??
She say there is no old man around in her street and not within in her
sight on that morning.</B>
<BR><B>Few years later, I saw my grandfather's picture and It was HIM!!!
I ran with his picture to show Mom that it was him who told me to stop.
She dropped her jaw.&nbsp; She can't believe that he knows sign language
as he died before family found out that I was deaf.</B>
<BR><B>One more story to tell ...</B>
<BR><B>My family owned two huge Alaska Husky dogs. I went up to greet one
of the dogs. My brother heard that one of the dogs were growling at me.
I was still approaching dogs as you know I can't hear dog growling to let
me know that I am not wanted in their area. I got too close to them. One
of the dog attacked me by pushing me down. I was down flat on my face on
the ground. I can feel his paws standing on my back. I was struggling so
hard to get away from that dog. I couldn't move at all. Dog was too heavy
to push away as he was probably around 130 while I was like 70 pounds.
I was screaming for my Mom. Luckily, my brother saw all and got Mom coming
out of her home screaming and carrying her broom to pound the dog away
from me. Thank God, I was not hurt at all. So she did put those dogs to
sleep as they were getting too vicious anyway.</B>
<BR><B>Several years later when we got our communication between us improved.
I recalled to Mom about those dogs incident. The part I say about dog being
on my back holding me down. My Mom stared at me and asked me if I felt
dogs standing on my back. I nodded. Mom shook her head saying No...not
from her point of view. From what she saw was that she was running down
to save me from that dog. The dog was NOT standing on my back. Dog was
standing over me and his paws were on ground, not on my back, staring at
my neck, was waiting for me to move so it can bite my neck off. I was not
moving and my head and clothes were blocking dog from bite my neck.</B>
<BR><B>I was in shock because I can honestly feel something was on my back.
Someone did hold me down from moving so dog won't bite me at all. I'd like
to think that it was my grandfather saving me from being mauled to death
by this dog.</B>
<BR><B>He just keep on saving me again and again while I was growing up.&nbsp;
WHEW...smile. I do believe I still have him around me as He still protects
me to this day even I am mother of three kids. He is still around and protecting
me...</B>
<BR><B>I do believe there is such as wonderfully nice ghost around. Thank
you for reading this!! Have a nice day</B>

movie earlier that day, well, as soon as i got to my bedroom door i could
see a tall man( as tall as my door) wearing this hat and suit blocking
my door, but as i got closer he could climb onto my dresser and disappear
(my dresser is next to my door) and as soon as i get there right before

the light my closet door was closed just as i left it. needless to say

<P><B>A long time ago my mother had a boyfiend who was an alcholic and
they were together for about 11 or 12 years and the man that my mother
was with always like to run the roads when he was drinking and he was abuseive
in a lot of ways BUT more with our mother. My mothers boyfriend went from
bar to bar in down town Jacksonville Florida on a street called 8th street
any way he was ran over one night and he died back in 1989 So, I guess
he's been gone for about 14 years now.</B>
<BR><B>Back in 1991 when I turned 19..........I left home and moved to
Virginia Beach with my boyfriend who is now my husband any way my mother
lived in some apartments in Hilliard Florida and my mother said sometime
after I left she got a phone call and she ask me if I wanted to know what
the vioce on the phone said to her so I said "Okay". My mother said the
voice said to her "Hey honey, this is Jimmy". and my mother said that she
ask who it was because her Jimmy died in an accident and again the voice
repeated to her "Honey this is Jimmy, don't you know me"? and Jimmy started
naming several things that momma used to cook for him and my mother said
"No, my Jimmy is dead he died in an accident "Please" let him rest". and
then she hung the phone up and she never did get a phone call like that
ever again. "Isn't that wierd"?</B>
<BR><B>My mother said all the friends that he had never knew she had a
phone and they didn't even know what her phone number was So, how in the
world could have someone have called her and said these things to her?
My mother said she was talking to her mother and younger sister and they
told her that it was probly his spirit.............I was like "Wow"! this
is really freaky.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ahmrafea@batelco.com.bh</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm fifteen years old and my hobby is ghost hunting, atleast it was!
I used to love scary stories about ghosts and demons and i'm usually the
one telling them. I didn't use to be scared of anything, i love the dark,
i love halloween and everything that has to do with ghosts and scary stuff.
I used to always fool around with my friends becuase i didn't think they
were real. I used to pretend to talk to a ghost and i loved scaring other
people, but it all changed....you can say i got a taste of my own medicine.
One night i was sleeping and i woke up suddenly because i heard a whisper
of some sort, i simply thought i was breathing loudly or something... but
i wasn't. Since i wasn't quite awake i went back to sleep and forgot about
the whole thing. The next day I was studying for an exam and i was holding
a metal led pencil, suddenly it moved as if there was a magnet pulling
it. it was really weird because it kept moving in many directions. That
didnt' scare me, but i was curious so i searched the net on ghost info
to see if there is anything about magnetic forces but i couldn't find anything.
I was reading the article and then i spotted something that really freaked
me and reminded me of the previouse night, it said: "Here a whisper in
the middle of the night that wake you up...guess what? it's a ghost."</B>
<BR><B>Since then i become scared of everything, even sleeping in the dark.
I still feel presence in my room but i try not to bother them.</B>

<BR><B>Arizona Haunted House</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Willowfly@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Some years ago while living in Arizona, I rented a house that I am
convinced is haunted (if the house still exists).&nbsp; The house was a
small 1 bedroom cottage that had a large livingroom with a natural rock
fireplace.&nbsp; I needed three bedrooms so I converted the livingroom
into a bedroom for me and my 2 sons used the main bedroom and an extra
room for their bedrooms.&nbsp; We used the old dining area as our livingroom
and the door off this room opened onto a flagstone patio.&nbsp; This house
sat on a large tract of land with several smaller cottages.&nbsp; Rumor
has it that at one time in the past there was a hot springs located there
and the cottages were part of a spa.&nbsp; Well, the springs dried up and
the town grew up around old spa and the cottages were converted to rentals.&nbsp;
By the way, if it still exists, the house is located in Apache Junction
on Ironwood Blvd. between Apache Trail and University Drive.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway I had my bed set cater-cornered between two windows for maximum
airflow. Everything was fine for the first few nights, when I was awakened
by the feeling of someone sitting down on me.&nbsp; I was sleeping on my
stomach at the time and I remember thinking that my cat must have jumped
up on me.&nbsp; But when I opened my eyes I could see Billy ( that was
his name) sleeping next to me.&nbsp; I tried to turn over but it was like
I was frozen in place.&nbsp; Finally after what seemed like an eternity
I was able to force my way up and the weight just suddenly disappeared.&nbsp;
I looked around and no one was in the room.&nbsp; I figured I must have
been dreaming.&nbsp; Anyway I worked nights at the time so I just got up
and went to work.&nbsp; I didn't think much about it until a couple of
nights later it happened again.&nbsp; I woke and almost went into a panic
but then I got angry and pushed up and it was gone again.&nbsp; I really
didn't want to say anything around my boys because I didn't want to scare
them. So a few nights later I was in bed and I could hear the t.v. in the
other room.&nbsp; I wasn't sleeping, just laying there.&nbsp; Suddenly
I could hear the sound of footsteps approaching the bed. It wasn't that
dark in the room because light was coming under the bedroom door....there
was no one there.&nbsp; I tried to roll to the other side of the bed but
I didn't make it.&nbsp; I was pinned again. When I was finally able to
move I jumped up yelling and my sons came running in.&nbsp; I was upset
so I told them what had happened thinking it would really freak them out.
But my oldest son told me that one day he was watching t.v. in the living
(dining) room when he went to the refrigerator. He saw, out of the corner
of his eye, what looked like and old lady sitting on my bed.&nbsp; He did
a double take and when he looked again nobody was there. I think they thought
it was cool to have what seemed to be a ghost.&nbsp; A couple of days later,
I saw her.</B>
<BR><B>Some of my friends were over for a barbecue and a couple of them
were going to the store.&nbsp; I let them out the front door in my bedroom
because it was closer to the cars.&nbsp; The over head light was on in
the room and it wasn't quite dark outside.&nbsp; As I turned away from
the door I saw this "person " walk past me heading in the direction of
my bed.&nbsp; I continued to turn but they weren't there anymore.&nbsp;
This figure was taller than me (I'm 5' 4") and was out of "focus" like
looking through opaque glass.&nbsp; I was floored!</B>
<BR><B>I really loved this little house and didn't want to give it up so
I tried an experiment.&nbsp; I moved my bed.&nbsp; My theory was that my
bed was situated where she had her chair.&nbsp; If I give her back her
space it should stop.&nbsp; She never sat on me again and as far as I know,
my son never saw her again.&nbsp; We coexisted peacefully for months after
that until we moved.&nbsp; If anyone else knows of this house or of someone
else who had experiences there please post it here.&nbsp; I am sorry if
this posting is too long.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Animal Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tarquin1589@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dear Dave</B>
<BR><B>You've said that you have an affinity for animal ghost stories.&nbsp;
Well, let me start off by saying that I am a sensitive, the only one in
my family, and every time I mention what I'm telling you, I get a look
like I'm crazy.</B>
<BR><B>I've been living in my current home for about eight years now, since
I was about six.&nbsp; And for the past eight years I've been seeing a
large white cat that I've dubbed "Tanner" sauntering around my kitchen.&nbsp;
Tanner was my first ghost, and I've grown very fond of him.&nbsp; My own
two living cats, I'm sure, can see him too.&nbsp; Sometimes I catch them
watching him while I do.&nbsp; Tanner is invisible to the rest of my family.</B>
<BR><B>Though I cannot physically touch him, I can hear Tanner purr.&nbsp;
I believe he belonged to a man who owned my house about thirty years ago.&nbsp;
Whatever the case, watching this ghostly feline is a wonderful thing.&nbsp;
When I found a friend who can see him just as well as I can, I was thankful,
because it reaffirmed my sanity.&nbsp; At the time, all I knew of apparitions
was that they were, in my mind, synonomous with hallucinations.&nbsp; Now
knowing this is not the case, I revel in the fact that I am a sensitive.</B>
<BR><B>I love your website, by the way, great job.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: topper31948@ncol.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I read a story on your message board that triggered a memory from
my childhood. I'm from South Carolina. The sub division I grew up in was
at one time a huge rice plantation. Lots of creeks and black sandy soil.
Basically a swampy area complete with gators and cottonmouths as big as
you arm. There was this path at the end of one of the roads and we were
forever going down that path into the swamp to play. Being kids it didn't
take us long to recognize what was safe and what wasn't. Set a good ways
back from the road and at the end of the path was an old house. It had
no electricity and no running water and much to our delight it had a bunch
of kids around our age to play with and play we did usually til dark time.(back
then it was a much safer world) We played there with those kids all that
summer. We did at times wonder about the clothing they wore as it was so
different from ours. We even ate lunch with them but we never saw the adult
that fixed the lunches. Fall came and of course so did school and homework
then chores so we didn't have time to go play there like we did in the
summer. The following late spring when school got out..You got it! Back
to the swamp to play with our friends from the summer before. You can imagine
our shock when we got there and there was no house not even any sign of
a house ever having been there. No foundation no old crumbling chimney
and no kids! There was nothing there but over grown weeds and big trees
where the house once stood. Even at that age we all know there was no way
trees got that big from one summer to the next. We all looked at each other
and kinda shrugged our shoulders and none of us ever talked about it. To
this day none of us has been able to explain what happened so we still
don't talk about it. I am curious as the what it was and still think about
it from time to time when I read something like your story. I think if
I am not mistaken it was called The Stuckey Plantation. There is a family
graveyard on the street that I lived on with a number of graves in it some
dating back to the late 1700's if I remember correctly. I don't know if
this had anything to do with it or not. Sadly, the last time I was home(1987)
The graveyard had been vandalized and I'm not sure if there is anyone taking
care of it now or not.</B>

<BR><B>Uncle Kennys Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CoolBreezes4Me@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened to my uncle Kenny. I was a young child when this occured.
This took place in the 1970's</B>
<BR><B>My grandfather Augustus passed away while working in California
of a heart attack. He never made it back home to South Carolina to see
his 8 children, wife and grand children ever again. Everyone was ofcourse
upset over his death, but it hit my uncle especially hard because he had
argued with his father before he left. He felt so guilty and cried alot
over it. After months had passed and he began to come to terms with everything,
he had a long talk with my grandmother one night and she assured him that
his father knew his son loved him. Everyone said that he felt much better
and had stopped feeling guilty .</B>
<BR><B>Well, my uncle would come in late at night, this is what the arguement
had been about, he thought he should be allowed to stay out later than
his 11:30 curfew because he was 17. Grandpa felt different. He demanded
that he be in at that time or he would be grounded. My uncle had a few
choice words for grandpa and stormed out of the house. He didn't come home
until the day grandpa was supposed to leave for California, he was gone
for 3 days. He stayed at a friends house. He and grandpa didn't speak except
to argue a little more that morning when he came back home and that was
it. He went to his room and didn't come out to say good-bye when he left.
We are a very huggy family, lots of hugs and "I love you" before whe all
leave eachothers homes etc... It's always been this way, even now. Uncle
Kenny didn't get to hug or say I love you to grandpa. Grandpa died almost
3 months later.</B>
<BR><B>My uncle was visited...he&nbsp; came home at 1:30 in the morning,
past curfew ofcourse. Grandma didn't get up to fuss at him this morning,
she just went back to sleep. Uncle Kenny came in, got some pepsi and ate
a sandwich before going to bed.</B>
<BR><B>His room was down the hallway to the left right off the kitchen.&nbsp;
Well, grandpa used to sit at the table waiting on uncle Kenny to get home.
We still have that table in our family. About 10 minutes after he laid
down, uncle Kenny hearda chair in the kitchen move and smelled ciagarette
smoke, he rolled over and thought nobody in this house smokes except dad.
So he got up, walked out his door a few steps and look down the hallway.
He saw his father sitting at the table with a white t-shirt on... like
he always wore that time of night.&nbsp; He said grandpa "would always
sit at the table with his hand on his forehead (it would always have a
cigarette in it) and cigarette smoke would stream up into the air." This
is how he would find grandpa waiting on him. This is how grandpa was this
time too. He took a few steps closer and said "dad", grandpa then looked
up at him, smiled and just kept looking straight at him for a minute or
so. Uncle Kenny didn't get to say anything else before grandpa vanished.
He went and woke up grandma and all the kids. They still smelled the smoke
when they went int o the kitchen. They all sat and laughed, cried and talked
about it. Uncle Kenny says that he got the feeling that it was dad's way
of letting me know he forgave me and that he knew I loved him. My uncle
always was home on time after that out of respect for his dad and mom from
then on. He broke curfew one time and waited for another visit, but didn't
get another one. He just knew grandpa was around, but never saw him again.
I love this story.&nbsp; It brings my family closer together every time
we hear again.</B>
<BR><B>My grandma always smells Vitalis. It is what my grandpa always put
on his hair. She smelled it earlier that night while lying in bed waiting
on my uncle.</B>
<BR><B>I have a story of my on, but I wil send it later. These things are
hard to write out, you have to make sure that people actually understand
..step by step, how it happened exactly. It's easier to tell in person.</B>

<BR><B>Uncle Babe, and Pepe</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: koalakels@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello everyone. I want to tell you about an experience that I had
last year that really freaked me out, and still does freak me out. I live
in an apartment with two stories. You need to understand that my parents
are divorced. Last year one day I was playing outside my apartment, and
my Dad comes by. At the apartment I live with my Mom. My Dad comes by to
tell me that my Uncle Babe just died that morning.&nbsp; Uncle Babe got
his name "Babe" because he was in world was two, and everyone used to call
him Babe. Uncle Babe is really my great grandfather's brother. I never
knew I had an Uncle Babe until just recently. Well, I was very upset, even
I wasn't as attached to him as everyone else in my family because I never
really knew him. Well at that time in my life I&nbsp; was having a hard
time with things, and was really depressed. Every night I would cry myself
to sleep. This night was no acceptation. I was crying about Uncle Babe.
I was kind of praying while I was crying. I kept asking Uncle Babe to somehow
tell me if he was alright, and that there was a heaven. I have done this
before, and didn't expect an answer at all. Well, at the time I was sleeping
with my two other brothers in the same room. I just finished crying, and
praying, and just trying to get to sleep at this point. My bed was straight
in front of the door, that was open. Anyway, I just stopped praying no
more than fifteen seconds ago when I heard what sounded like a little girl
or boy walking towards the door, but not exactly in view. Then it stopped,
I was still really scared. Then, my little brother that was seven at the
time, in a really high pitched voice, that wasn't his own, said, "I'm ok"
really slow. That freaked me out. Right now while I'm typing this, I asked
him to go as high as he can, and it wasn't nearly as high as that night.
There hasn't been anything else unusual except for one other time. I was
at my great grandmother's house, she was the wife of Uncle Babe's brother
I mentioned earlier on. Well, my great grandfather, Pepe, had died, and
Meme, my great grandmother, missed him dearly. Well, pepe had a chair that
he loved, and was his only. It was almost the only chair he would sit in.
Well, meme still had it. I went into her house, because I needed to get
some thread from her sewing machine for a project I was doing. I had to
go past the chair to get to the sewing machine. It was a light chair, but
wind from a person going past it couldn't make it move. I went passed it,
but when I came back, I stopped dead in my tracks. the chair was rocking
back and forth, and when I went passed it, it was really cold in that area.
I was kind of scared, but mostly peaceful because I knew it was pepe. I
told him I loved him, and he stopped for a minute, then stated rocking
again.</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a True Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: healing@nex.net.au</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 6 months ago I was looking for a dwelling
to lease here in North Queensland Australia and one of the dwellings I
was keen to lease, had I was toold by an Asian woman with whom I was purchasing
ingredients with which to 'purify' the home should I take up the lease.
However, she remarked to me that when i had mentioned the word house, she
was overcome with a strage feeling about it. When i arrived home i shared
this with my son, who like myself is a keen, very exoerienced energy dowser.
He dowsed and proclaimed that it contained a ghost, however, it was not
until I was actually inside the inspecting the interior it the following
day, that I remembered that it was housing a ghost, and proceeded to take
my crystal pendulum from its pouch and began seeking out the ghost. I began
in the third bedroom, but the pendulum girated in the negative, and it
was not until i entered the halway that the pendulum began to girate in
the positive direction and as I followed the direction of the energy, I
walked into the major bedroom and over to the window. For some reason I
took one step to the right and actually stood within the presence of the
ghost. The feeling that came over me as the energy began to coem from the
floor up through my entire body was a feeling that i had never in all my
life experienced as the hairs on my body seemed to stand on end as it (the
ghosts) energy rose up through me. I was not scared, but fascinated that
I was actually standing in the energy of a dis-embodied soul, that had
for some reason failed to walk through the door to the other side at the
point of death of its physical body. I spoke to it and could feel that
it was actually terrified of me as I gently told it I knew that one thing
was for sertain it now knew there was no such thing as death of the soul.
I encouraged it to leave, for I wished to occupy the home now. However,
it did not leave until i engaged a friend of mine to send it up to the
realm where it was meant to be. When I left the house after the inspection,
I had a headache around my temples and across my forehead, plus I experienced
3 occasions of disorientation. My headache lasted for three days and I
am a person who never gets a headache.&nbsp; When I arrived home, my son
encouraged me to take a shower, wash my entire body and the ghost's energy
down through the shower - to change my entire clothing. I decided to launder
the clothes I had worn during my encounter, just in case it held some of
the ghosts energy. However, I decided that I would not take the dwelling
after all, even after the entity had left.</B><B></B>

<P><B>THE SPIRITS THAT WOULDN’T LEAVE</B><B></B>

<P><B>by Joe Olivio</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;My wife and I were married in 1959 and living with my parents
while we were lookingfor a place to live.</B>
<BR><B>We went to look at an upstairs flat on topher off Van Dyke in Warren,
MI</B>
<BR><B>After looking at the place she didn’t want to live there. We had
been looking two weeks. We were tired.&nbsp; Against my wife’s better judgment
we rented the flat.</B>
<BR><B>Strange things began to happen on the day we moved in. There was
a strong presence</B>
<BR><B>through out the place.&nbsp; There were times we were afraid to
walk from one room to another.</B>
<BR><B>I remember standing in the bedroom doorway talking to my wife as
she stood in the</B>
<BR><B>hallway. The bathroom door opened behind her. I was staring up at
the door expecting to see someone walk through, but there was no one there.
My wife turned around to look and screamed with fear as we felt the presence.</B>
<BR><B>It was a very large bathroom. My wife discovered a small door designed
to hide</B>
<BR><B>things. It had no latch and it blended in with the wallpaper. It
was very hard to</B>
<BR><B>see. When she opened it she found books on witchcraft, evil spirits,
white and black magic, the works of Satan etc.&nbsp; We threw them all
in the garbage.</B>
<BR><B>I was alone in the flat one day and I followed the spirit images
with my eyes as they moved through the rooms.</B>
<BR><B>When I would set the clock to go to Church on Sunday it would be
moved an hour ahead in the morning making me late.</B>
<BR><B>I remember having a dream so fierce and evil that even till this
days I am troubled about it. Many times I would stay up all night reading
the Bible for comfort.</B>
<BR><B>One early afternoon I had a flat tire in the driveway. I went down
to the corner gas station</B>
<BR><B>to have it fixed. I had gotten friendly with Frank the attendant
in the two months living in</B>
<BR><B>the neighborhood. He ask me, “Joe, where do you live?” I answered,
“On topher at the</B>
<BR><B>dead end street.”&nbsp; He said, “You mean in the grey house in
the up stairs flat?” I said, “Yes” He said, “Do you know that a man killed
his wife upstairs in that flat where you live about 2 &frac12;&nbsp; months
ago?&nbsp; He tried to stuff a car title down her throat and then strangled
her.&nbsp; She lay dead there for two days.” I immediately checked it out
with the local newspaper morgue file and it was true.&nbsp; I didn’t tell
my wife, because she was already beside her self.</B>
<BR><B>I came up the steps that same afternoon.&nbsp; The door was jammed
and without warning like a man possessed, suddenly I kicked the glass and
received 153 stitches in my right leg.&nbsp; We left the hospital and never
went back to the flat, not even to get our clothes.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We move to Frazho rd. off Fern in Rslv., MI&nbsp;&nbsp; One night
as I was in a twilight sleep. I saw through two walls, a creature walk
up the walkway onto the porch, open the front door, walk through the kitchen
and living room.&nbsp; It then turned and walked into my</B>
<BR><B>bed room. It lifted the covers off of me and with both hands started
down to possess me!&nbsp; It was with a scream of terror and a cry to the
Lord for mercy that drove it back and it vanished. Many nights I slept
with the lights on. These things that moved about were not physical, but
spiritual.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Next, we moved into a basement apartment on carlye off Evergreen
in Dearborn, MI</B>
<BR><B>It was here we heard voices. People talking to each other and no
one there.&nbsp; At other times we could see groups of people standing
or sitting together. We could feel them and</B>
<BR><B>hear their footsteps&nbsp; as the walked by us.</B>
<BR><B>One morning as I walked out the side door I saw two persons sitting
in my car.&nbsp; When</B>
<BR><B>I got to the car, only 40 feet away and they were gone. It was that
morning I had</B>
<BR><B>an accident on the way to work.</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was then we moved back to Warren, MI on Helle and 8 mile rd. It
was for an entire year I would dream and the dreams would come to pass
the next day.&nbsp; Most all the dreams were of a troubling nature.</B>
<BR><B>We then moved into another up stairs flat on Detroit’s east side.&nbsp;
A high crime area.</B>
<BR><B>I came home from work early and was sitting on the couch playing
a guitar. I heard the</B>
<BR><B>down stairs door open. It was my wife coming home from work. She
walked up the stairs, into the hallway and kicked an empty soda bottle.
It rolled through the living room on the hardwood floor right in front
of me.&nbsp; She walked down the hall and through the living room where
I was and then into the kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>I walked into the kitchen to ask her if she wanted to go out to
eat.&nbsp; She was not in there.</B>
<BR><B>There was only one entrance into that flat. It was the way she walked
in. I called the store where she worked to find out what time she left
and she answered the phone.</B>
<BR><B>My wife said to me that night, “Joe, I will not sleep in the front
bedroom tonight!”&nbsp; I ask</B>
<BR><B>her, “Why?” She just said, “I’m scared.”&nbsp; So, we slept in the
other bedroom down the hall.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning I left for work. I went down the stairs and out
the door.&nbsp; I saw a young</B>
<BR><B>boy of about 15 years of age standing and he was looking up to the
front bedroom window. I ask him, “Why are you staring up at the window?”</B>
<BR><B>He looked at me so sad almost in tears and said, “My little sister
died in that room of an incurable disease last month.&nbsp; As I walked
away, he just kept staring up at the window as if he was in a trance.&nbsp;
The place was erie.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Murray House Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: spiegelbiegel@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well after reading all of these stories I decided to submit my own
experiences.&nbsp; I live with my mother and younger sister in a house
that we rent from Murray family. The Murray s a predominant family in the
town and owns a heating oil company. I m not sure the exact dates but I
do believe the settled in the town around 1850 and the finished construction
of their house, which I currently reside in, in 1854, or so the foundation
block says. The house had an addition added at a date that I m not sure
of. The addition has since been turned into a second apartment of the back
of the house. Well now that you now the history I can get down to the story.
My family and I moved in about 3 years ago, around March 2000. When we
first found the house for rent my mother immediately called and decided
to move. However, the house needed some work, mostly just some paint and
putty, so my mother often went to a local hard ware store to pick up paint
and such. The store s staff was very friendly and asked her what all the
paint was for and she replied that we were moving into the&nbsp; old Murray
house&nbsp; as its referred to by many. The employees then asked if we
had heard the ghost stories, and my mother said no. So for about the next
hour we sat there and listened to what I thought were stupid made up stories
about the house. My mother thought it was cool but she s always thought
that kind of thing was cool. So when we returned to my house I decided
to try an experiment. The hard ware store s employees had told us the ghost
was the Murray s Uncle, Jim Murray, and thus we referred to him as Uncle
Jimmy. So as my mom was walking to the car I sat my stairs and Yelled out,&nbsp;
Uncle Jimmy is you really do exist come and prove it.&nbsp; The very instant
I ended that sentence, a persons hand ran through my hair and the railing
on the stairs began to shake so violently that I ran out of the house.
Well that s what started it all, for that very night I was laying in my
bed looking around my new room my bed sank down as if my mother was sitting
on. So I turned and looked only to see no one there but my bed still had
the weight pushing down on it like someone was sitting on there next to
me. Once again I found myself running to my mother. I actually slept in
my sleeping bag on her bedroom floor that night. The next day we talked
about what had happened and I learned that my little sister had seen a
man walking just outside the house. She referred to him as the&nbsp; Shadow
Man&nbsp; because even when he entered the area of lit by the streetlight
he remained completely black without features. I was at this time of course
very freaked out and sometimes slept with my light on. My whole family
would often see things out of the corner of their eye only to see nothing
when they turned to look. Once, my mother was on the computer typing up
some paper work for her job. She said she heard someone breathing and walking
up behind her and she assumed my sister was sneaking up behind her to scar
her, so she quickly turned around to see no one. Small sightings continued
for a while, as did the disappearance and reappearance of objects throughout
the house at times. However, lately more and more large things happen.
Just last week I was walking up my front steps after walking the dog when
something caught my eye on the roof. I looked up to see the&nbsp; shadow
man&nbsp; run right across the roof and disappear. Only 2 hours ago I was
walking out of the kitchen and down the hall way, which leads to the living
room were a mirror hangs, when I looked up to see a figure behind me in
the reflection in the mirror, of course I took a flying leap up the stairs
to the computer desk where my mother was. I told my friends about all the
previous stories and 1 of my friends was very skeptical about it. I invited
him over to perform a little experiment with a checkerboard. We set up
the pieces and moved a single piece. We then walked around the upstairs
calling for the ghost to move a piece and to play a checker game with us.
We checked back and nothing happened so we sat at the bottom of the steps
and talked. After a while we had almost forgot about the checkerboard when
I suddenly remembered. So we went to check and found that another piece
of the opposite color had been moved. I thought I was my friend and turned
to accuse him only to see him pale white and unblinking, he then asked
if we could go do something outside. I guess uncle jimmy made him a believer
really quick. I later had him spend the night a week or so latter and he
set up his sleeping bag next to my bed. I had just fallen asleep when we
woke me up in a panic. I asked what was wrong and he said that something
under my bed had growled at him, I thought it was my do so I looked round
only to realize my dog had been locked out of my room for the night. Needless
to say my friends don t like to come over or spend the night very much
anymore. Some other sitting have occurred including my neighbor s, in the
second apartment attached to house, son crying and screaming to&nbsp; Get
that man out of his room&nbsp; and pointing at blank air stating a man
is standing there. My mother has claimed to have seen him and will no longer
leave her room for her favorite midnight snaking events at night unless
I too am still awake. Although scary things do happen it doesn t worry
us. We almost consider Uncle Jimmy a member of the family and almost a
protector of the house. Its actually cool having things happen sometimes
after the initial shock and it s a great icebreaker with the chicks. HAHA.
If you d like to know more email me at Spiegelbiegel@yahoo.com, cause there
is plenty more just don t feel like writing an entire book on it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Lady in the Rocker</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DebbieS@hubenterprises.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It all started when my husband and I were living in Monroe, Louisiana.&nbsp;
He was going to pharmacy school and I had taken a leave of absence from
work as I was 8 months pregnant.&nbsp; We had been married about 3 years
and was pregnant for our first child.&nbsp; When we moved to Monroe, my
mother-in-law gave us an old rocker, which was solid oak arms and legs,
with an old cloth that was tearing, which we refinished.&nbsp; We had this
rocker the whole three years of our marriage.&nbsp; My husband would go
to school and work till 11:00 p.m. every night; and sometimes would not
get home until close to midnight; therefore, I was left alone many late
nights.&nbsp; It all started one night when I was watching television and
the rocker started to rock slowly on its own. I became very frantic and
went to my next door neighbor, which by the way, we resided in a mobile
home park. I did not tell her what I saw, only that I was not feeling well
and was waiting on my husband to return home.&nbsp; When he did, he did
not believe me of course, and related it to me being pregnant and being
alone.&nbsp; He did check where the rocker was situated on the floor; as
you know the air condition vents or on the floor in the old mobile homes.&nbsp;
He said that the air condoner could not have made the rocker rock and it
was just my imagination.&nbsp; Well, the rocking did not stop from then
on, it was almost every night, and only when I was by myself.&nbsp; I gave
every reason in the book, to visit my neighbors for as long as I could
every night.&nbsp; When my daughter was born it only got worst, but I became
use to it, not really, but whatever it was it was not hurting me.&nbsp;
We moved from Monroe approximately one month after my daughter was born;
as he had graduated from pharmacy school and landed a job in New Iberia,
Louisiana.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course we moved the mobile home, along with the
rocker still in it.&nbsp; As my daughter grew, the rocker stop rocking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
UNTIL&nbsp; I was 8 months pregnant with my second child,. approximately
1 1/2 years later.&nbsp; At this time we were building a new home and I
was praying that he would not bring the rocker with us.&nbsp; But he did.&nbsp;
He said it was within family and did not want to get rid of it.&nbsp; Well,
the rocker still rocked and I was now really afraid.&nbsp; I beg him to
give it back to his mother and to ask his mother about the rocker and he
refused and still did not believe me.&nbsp; When my second child was born,&nbsp;
the man who my husband was working furs child, took a liking to my daughter
who was now almost three years old.&nbsp; She was about 9 years old and
always wanted to come sleep to play with her.&nbsp; Well, she had to sleep
in the living room of the mobile home, where the rocker was.&nbsp; Well
she woke up one night at 1:00 in the morning and came to our room crying
wanting us to take her home and she would not tell us why.&nbsp; The next
morning I went to her parent's residence and spoke with her mom.&nbsp;
Her mom said well you know kids, she imagine she saw your old black rocker
rocking and she got afraid.&nbsp; Now remember I never told a soul except
for my husband, and of course, being a pharmacist in town, he was not about
to tell anyone nor would he allow me to tell anyone.&nbsp; Well she never
came back to my house again.&nbsp; After my son was born the rocking again
increased.&nbsp; In the meantime we had finished our home and had moved
in around November.&nbsp; I bought all new furniture and told my husband
I flat refused to leave that old black rocker in my living room, so he
put it in the fourth bedroom, which was a spare bedroom and I SHUT THE
DOOR AND LEFT THE DOOR SHUT, only to go in and occasionally to do house
cleaning.&nbsp; Around December of the same year, my husband and I had
joined the Jaycee Jayne's, which is a local organization.&nbsp; My husband
had volunteered to play Santa Claus at Wal-Mart and called me at home and
said that two other Jaycees were coming over to borrow the rocker for Santa
Claus to sit on.&nbsp; I said GREAT.&nbsp; Well the two Jaycees came over
and it took both of them to lift the rocker into the bed of their truck,
that is how heavy it was.&nbsp; Well about 1/2 hour later my husband called
and was saying to me, I can't believe it, I can't believe it.&nbsp; Of
course, I was like what can't you believe.&nbsp; He said well the two Jaycees
were traveling down the highway going 25 MPH, when the passenger, out of
the corner of his eye saw something going on.&nbsp; He turned around and
said the rocker just lifted itself straight up and threw itself out of
the bed of the truck onto the highway and of course breaking.&nbsp; They
said it was tooooo scary the way it happened, like someone had lifted it
up and threw it out.&nbsp; Well that story was told at party after party
by these two guys and my husband still refused for me to tell anybody my
story.&nbsp; Well I finally got the nerve to call my mother-in-law and
I told her that the rocker had fell out of the bed of the truck when we
had loaned it to the Jaycees.&nbsp; AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID.&nbsp; OH
MY, THAT ROCKER BELONG TO MY GREAT AUNT, WHO ACTUALLY DIED IN THAT CHAIR
WHILE ROCKING ONE OF HER GRANDCHILDREN, SHE JUST DIED RIGHT THERE WITH
THE BABY IN HER HANDS.&nbsp; SHE USE TO ROCK ALL OF HER 12 GRANDCHILDREN
ALL THE TIME IN THAT ROCKER.&nbsp; I GUESS IT WAS A GOOD PLACE FOR HER
TO GO.&nbsp; Well that is my story and believe me I never believed in ghost,

<P><B>The Brick</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SMader@columbus.rr.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother at one time lived in a brick farmhouse in rural Ohio.&nbsp;
There were no modern amenities and water had to be fetched from a spring
through the woods a bit in back of the house.&nbsp; Sometimes when she
would go to the spring she said there would come with her "little gray
smokey looking shadows" on each side of her a little above the ground.&nbsp;
She would never see where they came from or where they went when they got
back to the house.&nbsp; She said she was never frightened.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;She had also told me that one time as she was baking bread
in the morning she looked out the window and saw a locket hanging in the
tree outside.&nbsp; The sun was coming up and it was just catching the
morning light and glinting a little.&nbsp; She said she glanced at it from
time to time and finally after a bit she went out only to find nothing
there.&nbsp; Later that evening when she was coming up towards the house
after some chores she said she saw a woman with a baby sitting on a blanket
under that very tree.&nbsp; As she had some things in her hands she walked
up to the front of the house and went in to set down her things.&nbsp;
She said she could still see them out the window as she went past and down
the hall to the back door to see who it was.&nbsp; When she rounded the
corner, there was no one there.&nbsp; She said then she knew that they
were ghosts because there was just no where anyone could have gone that
you wouldn't have seen them walking away.&nbsp; Also she said the grass
wasn't pressed down or anything.&nbsp; I've often wondered if the shadows
that walked with her sometimes might have been this woman and her child.</B>
<BR><B>Another story at this house involves a relative that was ill and
dying in a bedroom.&nbsp; People had brought flowers and such to her.&nbsp;
My aunt said as she sat in the bedroom with her the bedroom door opened
and a basket full of fresh flowers just floated in a few inches above the
floor and then sat down at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; No one could remember
if they were some flowers that had already been brought by someone or if
they were picked by an unseen hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandmother eventually
moved from this house and it still stands today.&nbsp; I have always wanted
to stop and ask the folks that now live there it they have experienced
any thing strange...................</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now mind you I'm just repeating what my Mom and Dad have told me, but I
thought you might be interested. This would have happened 41 years ago,
when my oldest sister was a baby. My Mom and Dad just moved in to an old
house somewhere in W.V. At night when they went to bed my Mom would hear
a baby crying, and she would go check on my sister, the strange thing is
my sister would be sound asleep and my Mom could still hear the crying.
To say the least this scared her to death she looked and looked for where
the crying was coming from and could never find anything. After a few nights
of this my parents were not sleeping to well and hear a noise at the door.
They saw a huge rat.&nbsp; The next day they were packing to leave when
a lady next door asked them if they were leaving already. My Mom asked
her what she was talking about she told her that a few years before the
family who lived there had a young baby and that it had been killed by
the rats, Well it didn't take my family long to finish packing. Mom said
she would never go back to that house.</B>

<BR><B>Terrified</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: naomi_wiebe@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, my name is Naomi, and I have several paranormal stories to
share.</B>
<BR><B>Ever since I was young, I have always been terrified of the paranormal,
and</B>
<BR><B>have had vivid, terrifying dreams.&nbsp; As a child, I would frequently
awake to</B>
<BR><B>see a dark, shadowy figure standing by the door frame of my bedroom.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>would feel a presence behind me when I would walk upstairs at night.&nbsp;
At a</B>
<BR><B>slightly older age, I dismissed the possibilities of ghosts, because
I</B>
<BR><B>figured it was impossible, but later had a change of heart when
I went to</B>
<BR><B>this haunted yard.&nbsp; I had heard many stories about a small
yard where stange</B>
<BR><B>happenings had occurred.&nbsp; One night I thought it might be interesting
to go</B>
<BR><B>take a look at it and see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp; The
yard is almost</B>
<BR><B>impossible to find, totally surrounded by trees.&nbsp; If you are
able to find</B>
<BR><B>it, go there in winter.&nbsp; The snow is always perfect, not a
single flaw.&nbsp; If</B>
<BR><B>it's a windy night, there will be no wind within the yard.&nbsp;
The freaky part</B>
<BR><B>about it is that there is an old building which used to be an insane</B>
<BR><B>asylum...now abandoned.&nbsp; It's boarded up, but one night we
opened it up, and</B>
<BR><B>we heard a faint barking of dogs from within, but there were no
dogs</B>
<BR><B>anywhere near-by.&nbsp; Next to it, there is a small trailer.&nbsp;
No one lives in</B>
<BR><B>the trailer, but a light and the tv are always on.&nbsp; There is
an old swing on</B>
<BR><B>the yard, if you watch it for long enough, it will begin to swing
lightly.</B>
<BR><B>The strangest part is that there are two old native american tombstones.</B>
<BR><B>Every time you go back, they have been redug and moved to another
location</B>
<BR><B>on the yard.&nbsp; I'm not sure if any of this is ghost-related,
but it certainly</B>
<BR><B>is freaky.</B>
<BR><B>An incident happened to me this evening as well.&nbsp; I was walking
with some of</B>
<BR><B>my friends along the railroad tracks in my town.&nbsp; On the street
next to the</B>
<BR><B>tracks, a hundred years ago, there was a man who went insane, killed
his</B>
<BR><B>family, and was hanged in the court yard.&nbsp; Anyway, tonight
as we were</B>
<BR><B>walking, we all of a sudden simultaneously stopped, and looked at
each</B>
<BR><B>other, terrified.&nbsp; We all felt a strange presence brushing
against our</B>
<BR><B>backs.&nbsp; Later, we were sharing stories about screams people
frequently hear</B>
<BR><B>coming from the park.&nbsp; We decided to sit out on the deck of
my friends</B>
<BR><B>house, who lives right by the park.&nbsp; We were just sitting around,
talking,</B>
<BR><B>when we hear the scream of a little girl, as if she was being murdered,</B>
<BR><B>coming from across the park.&nbsp; We immediately ran inside.</B>
<BR><B>Once inside, we began to share ghost stories.&nbsp; One of my friends
believes</B>
<BR><B>his house in haunted.&nbsp; He always feels things in his room when
he is</B>
<BR><B>sleeping.&nbsp; With one particular experience, back in Winter,
he would wake up</B>
<BR><B>in the morning with claw marks in his shirts, and slight scratches
on his</B>
<BR><B>back.&nbsp; This happened about 6 times.&nbsp; Another time, he
woke up and all of his</B>
<BR><B>blankets were totally flipped upside down, but looked as though
they had</B>
<BR><B>been untouched.&nbsp; He talked to his grandmother about it, because
she is able</B>
<BR><B>to communicate with the dead, and she visited their house and told
the</B>
<BR><B>spirit to leave.&nbsp; Since then, there have been no strange occurances.</B>

<P><B>Summerfield Florida</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: xXxOnLookerxXx@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>After my parents separated when I was 13 my mother moved us into
a house in Summerfield, Florida; on Little Lake Weir.&nbsp; We had lived
there only a couple of weeks when things started getting weird.&nbsp; This
house is a duplex and my mother, brother, and myself lived on the larger
side. My Grandmother and Her boyfriend lived on the one bedroom smaller
side.&nbsp; When we moved in there were only 2 bedrooms on our side so
we had to build another room for my younger brother.&nbsp; Like I said
we'd only been there a couple of weeks when things started getting creepy.&nbsp;
I was home alone (on my side of the house) sitting in a recliner in the
living room watching TV. My dog Goldie was laying next to me sleeping when
she suddenly jumped up and started barking at something on the ceiling,
in the kitchen directly behind me. Startled I jumped up to find nothing.
I sat back down and tried to calm my dog. The next morning I went to ask
my grandmother if maybe her boyfriend had come home late.&nbsp; Then recollected
the story to her.&nbsp; She got extremely quiet and almost started crying.
She then told me that she was woken up at the same time with the smell
of her grandmother's homemade soap.&nbsp; This isn't the only happening
though. One night my mother was "next door" visiting with my grandmother
and I was getting ready to go to bed.&nbsp; I had just shut off my television
and it came back on. Not unusual, sometimes I'd hit the button twice and
there was my voucher. I went to turn it off again when it turned itself
off, and then on, and then off again. It kept doing this and nothing else
in the house was flickering. I got scared and out of instinct ran out of
the room.&nbsp; Though I don't know why even 'til this day why I ran outside.&nbsp;
Another instance was after I had moved out and my brother had moved to
my father's.&nbsp; My step sister was staying with my mom and step dad
and had been told to go to sleep in my old room. Which is now a guest room.
She had just fallen asleep when she was woken up by what she thought was
someone crawling into bed with her.&nbsp; She opened her eyes to what she
says was a dream. A small blonde hair boy sitting next to her almost touching
her.&nbsp; She said she didn't feel scared and then he started to talk.&nbsp;
She says he said "Where is Celeste, I miss Celeste?" Celeste being myself.&nbsp;
A couple of years later my step sister and I moved into the smaller side
of the house (my grandmother had moved out) until we could find another
apartment.&nbsp; We had a close friend over and were relaxing. I had gone
to bed, my sister laid on the couch watching TV, and our friend sat on
the porch doing his homework.&nbsp; I had just fallen asleep and had the
feeling I was being watched. When my friend on the porch yelled "WHOA!"
This woke me up and I ran out to see him sitting there eyes bugged out
and pale. He then without even seeing me ran outside to the same spot I
did when my TV freaked out. We had never told any of our friends about
our happenings so they would actually come stay with us. He turned to me
and looked me in the eye and said "I saw him." Then he recollected what
he saw. To our surprise, it was the little blonde hair boy. He said he
was sitting at the bar table reading his text book and he heard a slight
thump on the window. When he looked up he saw this little boy peeking into
the window. He said then the little boy ran into the yard and disappeared.&nbsp;
So we all went and walked on the deck to further investigate.&nbsp; When
we sat there looking out into the lake goosebumps covered our entire bodies,
and we all saw the same thing.&nbsp; What looked to be a small smoky figure
moving towards the lake past the gated fence towards a very tall black
object that looked and felt to be scolding this smaller figure.&nbsp; I
haven't been back for a lengthy period of time since I got my new place.&nbsp;
But I always feel as though I'm being watched.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Shadows in the House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: myrnalee50@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have always been so amazed with sprits. As a child, I have always
wondered if there were really spirits and ghosts. I have been told many
stories about them but in the back of my mind, I figured it was just a
made up tale that everyone tells just to get your excitement going. Then,
I figured out from reading shadowlands that all the experences I have had
werent just a made up tale and I really am sane and that I believe now
that there is the supernatural exzistance. I have many stories to tell
but, I want to start with the recent one. My boyfriend and I decided after
going out for 3 years that I would move into his house with him. He has
a daughter age 18 who lives home also. One night I was sitting on the coutch
watching T.V. by myself. Everyone else was gone at that time. I didnt have
any lights on because there was just me so, I used the light from the T.V.
All the blinds were shut at the time also. As I was watching the show on
T.V. a black shadow caught my eye. It moved across the room in the dining
area which our bedroom is to the left of it. The shadow moved across the
room straight to our bedroom. On the right of the livingroom is the upstairs
door which goes to my boyfriends daughters bedroom. My boyfriends daughter
had told me that she has been seeing a little boy in her room for quite
a while. She said he was harmless and just wanted to be by her. At first
I thought she was just scaring me. Well, I saw this shadow twice but never
said nothing to anyone for fear that they would think I was nuts. One night
as I was talking to my boyfriend, we got on the subject about ghosts. He
told me about the shadow he has been seeing. I was dumbfounded. Then I
finally told him that I have been seeing the same shadow. He said that
most everyone in the house has seen it. It always comes from the stairway
in the dinning room and goes into our bedroom. I had the lights on one
night over the bed in our room as I was reading. You have to turn the switch
before the light goes off and the switch has to go around until it makes
a klick sound. As I was reading, the light turned off. I thought I hadnt
turned the switch all the way on but, I checked it and it was completly
off. At first I thought someone was playing a joke on me but it happened
two or three times again. Now I am somewhat skepticle but I do believe
that someone of the suppernatural is lurking around. It doesnt bother me
anymore because it has become a part of my life and its harmless. I just
figure whoever it is is just having some fun because nothing bad happens
because of it. This is why I joined shadowlands. It lets me know that these
spirits do exest and its normal to experence.&nbsp; A woman in Scottville,
Michigan who feels better now.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>but this one has to do with a ice skater</B>
<BR><B>i am sure everyone who is a fan of figure skating knows the russian
pair gordeeva and grinkov</B>
<BR><B>my story is around sergei</B>
<BR><B>t was said sergei died in katias arms on november 20,1995 lake placid</B>

him sergei</B>
<BR><B>my friends told me i would be sorry but i didnt listen</B>
<BR><B>he followed me everywhere and i watched him grow every day till
he was a full grown cat</B>
<BR><B>i loved him so much and i was very close to him he was my favorite
cat!</B>
<BR><B>i have others but sergei stood out from all of them!</B>
<BR><B>1997 i got two black puppies from next door neighbor and i kept
them outside</B>
<BR><B>sergei loved to go outside and run around in my backyard and always
scratched to come in when he wanted inside</B>
<BR><B>one day my puppies were outside and&nbsp; i noticed sergei didnt
asked to come in for hours so i went outside to find him</B>
<BR><B>i came across this black and white body laying in the backyard</B>
<BR><B>now sergei would lay outside sometimes in the sun so i figured that
is what he was doing</B>
<BR><B>i went over to him and touched him and his body was cold!</B>
<BR><B>sergei was dead</B>
<BR><B>i couldnt figure how he died because no dogs teeth marks were on
him</B>
<BR><B>it had to been a heartattack?</B>

and just held on to him as tight as i could tears running down my face</B>
<BR><B>i started rubbing his heart and his foot</B>
<BR><B>then i started to sing my favorite gordeeva and grinkov song they
skated to reverie</B>
<BR><B>and sergeis paw moved and reached out for my hand his eyes rolled
back and when i finished humming the song sergei died in my arms</B>
<BR><B>just like sergei died in katias arms in 1995</B>
<BR><B>i believe the ghost of sergei lived in my cat one last time because
for some reason wanted to be near to me and died in my arms again like
he died in katias 2 years ago</B>
<BR><B>to this day i will never forget my cat sergei or sergei the ice
skater</B>
<BR><B>i know now they are together in peace forever</B>
<BR><B>but i will never forget&nbsp; the day he came back and the joy he
brought me if only for a short time !</B>
<BR><B>they will always be in my heart forever!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Pushed me Down</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rhirhodes@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well. I've no idea how to say this. Even to this day I'm still afraid.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know how it happpened. I'm 20 year sold and have no clue
as to why it happened either, butit was one experiance that's pretty much
tormented me since then, and now I keep looking over my shoulder to realize
just what the hell made it happen to me of all people, and what it was.</B>
<BR><B>It happened when I w as about five years old. I was staying at my
uncle's house while my parents moved our stuff into my new house, the next
town away. My mother always hated this house, my uncle's, and didn't really
feel comfortable with her kid staying there, but my dad begged her, saying
that we'd, my siblings and I, be too tired to do anything at the new house,
and it was only for a few hours or so, so she relented. I was sitting on
the couch watching some absurd telivision show, when the room got suddenly
very cold, and something smelled pretty bad. I wondered if my uncle had
a fan on or had opened a window, but that wasn't the case. I looked to
my left and saw somethng completely weird.</B>
<BR><B>A funny looking figure was there, not human looking, but human shaped.
It was bright violent, tinged with pink, and probably wasn't too tall,
but looked huge to me at the time, considering I was only five. Sitting
on the couch, I told it, "Hi" and asked who it was. It just merely tilted
it's head and even though it didn't have any features, it felt like it
was staring at me.</B>
<BR><B>I don't really recall what happened next. I don't know how it happened.
But whatever that.. thing.. was, it had picked me up by the neck, and held
me over it's head, and smashed me through the glass table my uncle had
front body first. I remember hearing a huge crash, and kneeling with my
hands to the floor amidst glass and wood, and then feeling a huge pressure
on my back, shoving me down. It succeeded, and pushed me down hard into
the glass, and all I remember then is that I couldn't breathe, and I felt
a pain in my neck, and then my chest, and then everything went black.</B>
<BR><B>When I came too, my mother, father, and uncle were standing in the
doorway, and I was kneeling down amongst the glass, my hands to my neck,
with blood on them. I still couldn't breathe. My mother shouted something
to my father, grabbed me, and ran out of the house to the car with my dad
behind her. I was put in the car, and my mom got in the driver's seat and
my uncle got in the backseat with me and my other siblings.</B>
<BR><B>When I spoke to my mom of the even when I turned 19, she told me
about that day, I ended up with purple marks around my neck and a tennis
shoe print on my back, all in bruises.</B>
<BR><B>To this day I'm still afraid of anything resulting in the paranormal,
and I've got a small scar on the side of my neck. If anyone can explain
just exactly what attacked me and why, I'd be grateful.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Nursing Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: d2684@btopenworld.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i work in a nursing home and didnt believe in ghosts till i was offered
a nightshift position. one of the girls said that the home was pretty bad
with spirits but i thought because of my age (19) she was trying to scare
me. i was walking alone after answering a buzzer past the dining room when
someone touched my shoulder. i turned round and no one was there. i was
convinced it was the other two girls but they were in the lounge and could'nt
have got there without me seeing them. Later we were sitting talking when
the door which is a fire door and doesn't move was slamming and opening
for about a minute and abruptly stopped. we all got out our seats, dont
know why, and then a black figure appeared at the door and just stared
at us for five minutes and walked off. the ledest girl went after it so
we followed and no one was there. we sat down to calm ourselves because
we were pretty freaked by then when the emergency buzzers started going
off simultaneously from room one to thirty but there are patients who cant
reach them and others are on medication so we went and turned them off
and checked our residents. We went to one lady who was dying of cancer
and i turned off the buzzer when my co-worker said she was gone. we can
only think this was her having a laugh because she was a great lady or
she was trying to let us know she was gone.</B>

<P><B>By: jessicaiskool@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is really strange....my middles school is about 50 or 60 years
old, and has been used for many things. The science building was used as
a hospital during a plane crash one year and there has always been a feeling
of a 'presence' in that particular part of the school. But the most weird
thing happened to me one day when we were in the gym, rehearsing for a
play. They sent me off to the janitor's closet to get a broom, and I entered
and saw a shower-type thing in the corner, obviously for rinsing mops and
such. Well, as I looked over at it, this feeling of total dread came over
me, and all I can remember thinking at that moment was "Oh my god, I'm
gonna die, I'm gonna die." I ran out and back up to the stage, shaking
and white, then realizing that I could defenatly feel a presence on the
stage too.</B>
<BR><B>That evening I was in bed, really freaked out, and I fell asleep.
I had a dream about a guy named Darien, and he clamed me in the dream and
explained that he had died in the janitor's closet. In the dream, he took
me to the gym and showed me his football picture.</B>
<BR><B>The next day i went out to the lobby of our gym and looked for the
football picture. And there he was, number 32, in a football picture dated
1973.</B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is Alicia. I've had a few ghost encounters in my life-
I think.</B>
<BR><B>You see, the problem with ghosts is that you never know if it's
really them. Sometimes it might be just a freaky coincidence. Who knows?</B>
<BR><B>#1 Well, this is a really short one. Okay. I had just come out of
the bathroom when my mom's bedroom door just went THUNK. I saw it close
a little bit, and it doesn't close very well. Oooh, creepy.</B>
<BR><B>#2 One day I had come home from a sleepover and was kind of tired.
I sat down on the couch, and something said "Alicia," in a very faint voice.
It was NOT my mom, because she was sitting at the table reading her Bible,
paying much attention to the story. Anyway, I turned my head and there
were these three heat-wave figures standing behind the couch! They were
moving, sort of, and they were giggling. Three girls whispering, obviously
talking about me or something. One said my name again, and that was enough.
Later, I was about to take my shower and I heard, again, a whisper that
said, "Be careful, okay?" I wasn't really scared of these "visitors", they
were just plain annoying! When I was in my bed, I sensed their presence
again, so I politely told them to go away. What do you know? They did.</B>
<BR><B>#3 One night before supper I was chatting with a pal on the phone.
I laid down on my bed and a ghost that looked like the oatmeal man was
standing over me! I ran out of my room, in the process telling my friend
what I saw. She laughed hysterically. But to me it was no joke.</B>
<BR><B>#4 This is actually what happened to my 23 month old nephew. He
was downstairs in the basement with his mom when all of a sudden he starts
screaming. LOUD. She calmed him down and let him back in his playpen. A
few minutes later, he stood up and started saying "GET!" to the space in
between the radiator and the wall. He only says "Get" to his dog, Ginger.
Who knows what really lurks in their basement?</B>
<BR><B>Well, thank you for letting me share my stories with you and I hope
you use them on your site.</B>

<P><B>My Life Experiences....so far</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Keldor6715@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I've sent in the same story to another site, but I can't seem to
find it anymore. It was tilted "The Sixth Sense is True.....For Me." Sometimes
others think I'm crazy, but I know I'm not. Just having strange experiences,
sometimes they're hard to believe. I know this is going to be a long story,
so please, bear with me.</B>
<BR><B>Most of my experiences started when I was 7 years old. The most
memorable one from this time, was I had an uncle in the hospital. An aneurysm
had burst in his head. My Mom didn't go into detail about it until later
on. I was told that he had a chance of coming home, but wouldn't remember
any of us.</B>
<BR><B>I went to sleep that night, and he showed up in my room, trying
to explain what was going on. He was actually trying to explain to me that
he was going to pass on, but being 7, I didn't really understand what he
was telling me. The next morning, my Mom was sitting at the table crying,
and first thing I said was, 'Mom, it's him, isn't it? He's not coming back,
is he?'&nbsp; She then tried to explain it to me, but I told her I already
knew, and it was okay. And she asked me how I knew, and how much I knew,
so I told her that all I knew was that he wasn't coming back, he still
loved us, and he said that he would check up on us once in a while to make
sure we were doing all right.</B>
<BR><B>A few years later, my Dad (I should maybe explain that I was adopted
by my grandparents) showed up, to tell me that he was coming to take my
Mom. So my Dad and I got into an argument about how he couldn't take her
with him yet, because I still needed her. The next morning, I told my Mom
about my "dream." I think it surprised her, because she gave me a puzzled
look, then asked me who I saw. I told her who it was and she told me she
had a dream the same night. My Dad showed up on an airplane, and told her
it was time to go home. She argued with him that she couldn't go yet, she
still had things to do, and he said 'Okay, but I miss you and want you
to come home with me soon.'</B>
<BR><B>I've gotten to see and hear my Dad off and on ever since. The strange
thing is that I was 8 months old when he passed on. And it's the neatest
thing that he's still there, helping me through hard times and sharing
in the good. In fact, I saw him and my uncle in the hospital sharing in
the birth of my daughter.</B>
<BR><B>When I was around 12, I saw a man in our hall closet. He was young
and dressed in army fatigues. He was holding a rifle and had red hair.
If I saw a picture of him, I could point him out. A few days after seeing
him in the closet, I had a dream that he was sitting in a rocking chair
with the rifle on one side and a white German shepherd on the other side
lying at his feet. When I came home from school the next day, The rocking
chair was rocking, but no one was home. I thought it may have been one
of my cats or my mom's dog (one of my cats knew how to open doors, he taught
himself) but they were all in their rooms (because no one was home). Needless
to say, I didn't stick around for very long, I went outside until my Mom
got home.</B>
<BR><B>I've also had some less than enjoyable things happen. I've seen,
heard, and talked with many different classes of demons. Like I said, less
than enjoyable. I was told no one can fully understand what they say, but
I can understand them perfectly, word for word. I've had them also play
mind games with me, they found that a lot of fun, I think.</B>
<BR><B>I've also seen the Grim Reaper. The old saying "Death stares you
in the face (looks you in the eye)," I found out is true. That had to be
the scariest. I've seen him twice. The last time, he physically lifted
me out of my bed. I still can't figure out why he visited me and left me
here. I was always told that if he visits you, that's it.</B>
<BR><B>I've had multiple experiences with poltergeists. They love to hide
things, and follow me around. The reason I say they're poltergeists, it
that I've heard them stomping around, bumping into things, moving things,
turning things off (mostly the stereo and TV), I've been kicked by them,
one tried to pick up my cat, and I've been touched by one (I'll explain
him later).</B>
<BR><B>I saw my (then friend) boyfriend's Dad one night. I didn't know
it then. I didn't find out until about 4 years later, when I told my boyfriend,
and then perfectly described him. I had never met his Dad before, or seen
a picture of him. I asked my boyfriend why he would show up in my room
one night and tell me he was asked to look after me. My boyfriend told
me that after I had moved 4 states away, he had asked his Dad to look after
me and keep me safe.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend and I talked (even without using phones) most of the
time I was gone. I even knew what he was doing without him telling me,
because I could see it. He was only able to talk to me, he couldn't see
me. The reason I mention this, is that some of these experiences we've
shared, and we'll probably share a lot more. Together, even at different
houses, we've either seen or heard things. We both heard his Dad walking
down the hallway (he didn't tell me until later because it surprised him
that I heard it too). He always thought he was either crazy or imagining
it, because no one else had ever heard it before. We've both seen orbs,
running shadows (we were walking), and other things of the like. He's heard
the demons but couldn't understand them. And he had one playing tricks
on him (now you see me, now you don't, oops! too slow, I'm over here) at
school.</B>
<BR><B>After I moved, a lot of my senses got stronger (I guess). I also
got to a point to where I could smell them, on top of everything else.
I was at a point where I knew which one was there by the smell. One smelled
like rancid meat, one smelled like spoiled milk. I was able to see "watchers"
(kind of like demons, but you only see their eyes, nothing else). There
was an old man that "lived" in our house. He was always harassing me. He'd
be in the bathroom anytime I was in there. He pretty well "molested" me
(he ran his hand up my inner thighs), and he was the one that tried to
pick up my cat (I didn't see this, only heard her scream, and saw the grooves
in her fur). He also constantly commented on the shows I watched on TV.
He made me feel like he was going to hurt me.</B>
<BR><B>Among some of the "talents" I developed, I've been able to see babies
before they were born (my own two years before conception). I knew if they
were boys or girls, what color their hair would be, and what color their
eyes would be, and exactly what they would look like. The only problem
with seeing all these babies, I don't always know who's pregnant. I could
also hear my own baby before she born, she clearly spoke to me.</B>
<BR><B>One of the oddest things was spending time with John Lennon. It
was really nice, but I don't know why he was visiting me. I did enjoy talking
with him though, he was really nice. He also showed me some interesting
places, which I found out were places he liked go on real life.</B>
<BR><B>I think my daughter (3 now) has the same abilities. She kept talking
to people (that I couldn't see) and she would repeat things that they would
tell her. One night, she told my boyfriend that "Charlie" says Hi. He had
to ask her who said that, and she told him. Then it struck him that he
knew a Charlie when he was 6. One day, she asked me for a cherry popsicle.
I forgot that we had popsicles in our freezer, so I asked her who told
her we had popsicles, and she said 'an old man.' I found the popsicles
about 2 weeks later, and suddenly remembered my step-grandpa always had
popsicles for us when we were kids. She also let us know that she saw my
boyfriend's Dad. The way she proved it was telling us his name. We never
said his name in front of her. She told me one day that I had her brother
(she called him "Bubbas") in my belly. I didn't know I was pregnant. Well,
I had (as far as the doctors could figure) a miscarriage, never even knew,
but my daughter did. She couldn't watch The Tigger Movie (her favorite
at the time), without going into a massive crying bout. Then she swore
she could him. He liked to hide in the bathroom. I couldn't see him, but
I could sense him and smelled baby lotion whenever he was in the house.
To be sure, my boyfriend and I named him (without her knowledge) and told
her next time to ask what his name was. We decided on the name Anthoney
James. When she told us a few days later that his name was "Tony," we were
kind of surprised. She's told me about "monsters." Sure all kids go through
the Monster Stage, but what she described, sounded like a perfect description
of a demon. She also told me of a little boy who was staying here. We figure
he's Hispanic, because he taught her some Spanish. The way we figured this
out was we asked her the normal questions. "What's his name?" She didn't
know. So we asked if she knew how old he was and (she was 1 1/2 at this
time) she held up 3 fingers and said "tres." We never spoke in Spanish
in front of her, and her father's family believes that if you're white,
you speak English (no exceptions).</B>
<BR><B>Well, none of these visitations have stopped. In some ways, it's
stronger than ever. My boyfriend is now an "automatic artist." He goes
into a trance (I've actually seen this) and looks like he isn't there.
When the drawing is finished, he has no recollection of it, it's not his
"style," there's smudges on the edge of the paper and eraser marks (he's
very neat about his drawings, he never smudges, and hardly ever erases),
his hand moves differently than normal, and it's different pencil strokes
than he uses. My boyfriend has also talks in his sleep, but a lot of the
time, it's something out the ordinary, and in someone else's voice.</B>
<BR><B>We both can see things that are going to happen, bad things, we
just don't know who it's going to happen to. And we also have been able
to sense when something's wrong, we just don't know what until a day or
two later.</B>
<BR><B>My family has had a history of this, so it didn't bother me so much
as it would have if there was no history of it. It seems to get stronger
with every generation, though mine seems to be the strongest so far (with
the exception of my biological Mom, who has strong visions in spurts).</B>
<BR><B>Among some of our latest happenings, there has been a two week visit
by a poltergeist (who kept bumping into our couch, and scared my daughter),
some wandering spirits who stick around for a day or two then drop by at
a later time to visit, a thing that reminded me of an imp (it was a shadowy
creature with wings and a long tail), lights and orbs, faces in the walls
or mirrors, and moving shadows. One of the things I make very clear to
any spirits who stop by is that if they're nice, and behave, they're welcome
to stay for as long as they'd like. If they're here to cause trouble or
hurt any of us, they're not welcome, they can go somewhere else. I think
it's reasonable. Every so often, I have to threaten the really troublesome
ones with talking to my boyfriend about the situation.</B>
<BR><B>As far as this year, I've had the normal contact with my deceased
family members, and my boyfriend and I have seen this thing that looks
like the "Reaper" but wears white and you can see every detail of his face,
and he emits light. I kind of wish that I can get them to stick around
long enough to ask for a picture. Other than that, I've been hearing voices,
sometimes one specific, sometimes many at once. There was a "dark" kind
of "demonic" voice telling me to "Beware". There was a woman saying something
about a recipe, then she started singing. And another one that's more familiar
for me. Above, I stated seeing my babies before they're ever conceived.
I saw a baby boy about 3 years ago. I know this one's my baby. And I also
stated above, I've heard them before they were born. Well, about a week
or two ago, I heard a little boy calling "Mommy, Mommy, wake up" then I
heard a baby crying. As a note, so no one thinks I'm reading anything into
this, neither of my neighbors have young children, or babies.</B>
<BR><B>I think I may try to record the voices in my home at night, and
I'll definitely ask if I can take their pictures. Hopefully, they won't
mind.</B>
<BR><B>Good luck to you and all of yours.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My House and I</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: HitchinARide8086@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My house and I don't get along. I know that is quite weird
to say because my house is..well, a house! But I do believe my house doesn't
like me. In my house, my Mom, grandma, and my grandpa live with me (I am
a 13 year old girl.) I have had a lot of strange experiences in my house,
but they are all feelings, nothing physical. Most of the experiences circulate
around me. Therefore I am the only one in my house who has any strange
feelings. As a matter of fact, I don't think that anyone in my house has
feelings like I do. I'll start with the events that happened when I was
smaller.</B>
<BR><B>My Mom used to work nights when I was a small child, so in the night,
I slept in her bed. When I laid in my mom's bed, I thought there was someone
in my doorway. (I was a very impressionable child and I watched a lot of
supernatural shows on the TV) Also, when I tried to go to sleep, I had
to have someone, like my grandma come sleep with me, because I was that
scared. I even held her hand to make sure she wouldn't leave me in the
night! I used to go "hunting" in my house. I took my flashlight and my
toy rifle. (I was a hillbilly child) I would hunt mostly in my grandma's
junk room. Also known as our living room.&nbsp; But this room was connected
to our dining room also. I would not go into the dining room though. I
always felt as though someone/thing was watching me. Like a monster. I
used to lay in front of&nbsp; our TV and watch the show "Cops" with my
grandpa. From the corner of my left eye, I could see the dining room, and
I saw two shiny, I don't know what to call them, but I thought of them
as eyes. So I would scoot back so I couldn't see that room anymore.</B>
<BR><B>Now to the sort-of present events. I have never told anyone about
my house but my boyfriend. Even he has had some experiences at my house.
Where I sit at my computer desk, to my left are the stairs to upstairs.
When I am on the computer, sometimes I hear my basement door opening, a
weird screeching noise, like an animal or something non-human, and then
footsteps (like shoes from the 80's with high needle heels) walk past me
and then up the stairs, and when they get to the stairs, a red haze travels
up the stairs. My stairs are orange, but it is yellow-orange and there
is nothing that could reflect on the wall to look red. Also, when that
happens, I sometimes get a feeling like I shoudlnt look at what is going
by me. So, I look to my right, into the huge china cabinet we have. I see
a reflection of a man, at least I think it's a man,(but that would be kind
of odd, because I hear highheels..) And sometimes, he stops, looks directly
at me in the glass, and then his face gets all distorted and it is very
scary looking. Then he walks up the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>(Whoa, my story is getting long!) Now this is my boyfreind's experiences.
He was upstairs, in my bathroom using the facilities and he got the feeling
someone was watching him. And another time, he was in my kitchen, getting
a chair, and my basement door opened.</B>
<BR><B>These are just a few of my expereinces, maybe later i'll submit
more! (Shadowlands.net rocks)</B>

<P><B>My Grandma Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Pammmm86@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The story I am about to tell you about is totally true. It happened&nbsp;
about 3 years ago (I am now 14) when I was 11.</B>
<BR><B>I got home from school one day earlier than everyone else and decided
to clean the house for my mother. I was in my room on one of the top bunks
of one of our bunkbeds making the bed when I heard the distinct sound of
slippers shuffling along carpet. Because noone was home and my house didn't
usually make strange noises, I was a little spooked. I ran out into the
hallway where the noise was coming from and there was nothing there. By
then I was extremely scared because even though I could not see the source
of the noise, I could still here it, and it sounded like it was getting
closer. I then ran outside and waited there until my mom got home.</B>
<BR><B>Another time my sister and I had ridden to the grocery store on
our bikes and were at home unpacking everything. We were home alone. My
sister was just about to put a carton of eggs into the refridgerator when
we heard the same shuffling noise I had heard only a couple weeks ago,
except now it sounded like it was in the kitchen and someone was walking
on the tile floor in slippers. My sister and I just stood there for a few
moments staring at the spot where the noise seemed to be coming from, then
my sister threw an egg at&nbsp; it and we bolted.</B>
<BR><B>The third and last occurence happened just 3 days after the "egg
incident". I woke up in the middle of&nbsp; the night to use the bathroom.
I didnt bother turning on the bathroom light or shutting the bathroom door
because the bathroom is in my room and I didnt feel like hurting my eyes.
As I was sitting on the toilet, I heard a noise coming from the bathroom
window which is right next to the toilet. It was a tapping on the glass
and then I heard a small child's voice crying, "Help me, help me." Of course,
I was frozen on the spot. I couldnt even pee anymore. I just sat there
for a minute then got up and ran out of the bathroom and hid under my covers.</B>
<BR><B>I know that the last one could have been anything, my brothers playing
a joke on me, or maybe just the wind and my imagination playing tricks
on me. But what if it wasn't. I am convinced there is a ghost in my house
and after telling my family of the happenings, we all believe it might
be my grandmother's ghost.</B>

<P><B>In the early 1990's as my sister, brother, and myself sat on the
tail gate of my grandmothers truck in our driveway at home facing some
brush, my mom stood facing us. We were just talking story that s when I
saw this figure which appeared to step forth from the brush behind my mom
about twenty some odd feet, this figure smiled and then vanished. My mom
shook my leg and asked me "what are you starring at? You kind of phased
for nearly three minutes." I told my mom that great grandpa appeared over
there, pointing to the area of brush. She replied that there was no one
there during that time, but she noticed I teared, I said that I felt something
was wrong. We all went back into the house and within five minutes our
telephone rang, it was one of my grandaunts, she was all in tears and told
my grandma that daddy died, my mom seen grandma's reaction and inquired,
mom asked my grandaunt how long ago did he pass? About ten minutes ago,
she said. My mom looked at me and said that s about the same time you phased
and later said you seen grandpa.</B>

<P><B>By: jovialjanna@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My dad died on Christmas when I was 16 years old. Being only 18 now,
this is</B>
<BR><B>a fairly recent event for me. Out of my dad's five children I was
the</B>
<BR><B>closest to him and have always been "daddy's little girl." Previous
to my</B>
<BR><B>dad's death, I lost my aunt and my brother, which is when my strange
dreams</B>
<BR><B>started, nightmares about death and I would get premonitions that
would come</B>
<BR><B>true, strange things that I never could have known.</B>
<BR><B>I couldnt be with my dad that Christmas, but just before it I was
very</B>
<BR><B>uneasy and crying, feeling that something was wrong. Then finding
out my dad</B>
<BR><B>died alone on Christmas shook me, I was truly broken down. A few
days went</B>
<BR><B>by with nothing but tears, I would lay in my bed at night apologizing
to him</B>
<BR><B>for leaving him alone on Christmas. It was truly a sad time for
me.</B>
<BR><B>Being a HS student, I didnt have the time to mourn very long, soon
I was</B>
<BR><B>back to school, and back working at my part-time job at a local
card shop.</B>
<BR><B>The card store had a basement and I had to do storeroom work down
there. I</B>
<BR><B>had been working there for a year, and had been down in the room
multiple</B>
<BR><B>times a day every day I worked, but that day was different. As I
was</B>
<BR><B>counting some stock I all of the sudden felt very warm (not cold),
and then</B>
<BR><B>I felt a touch on my back, firm like a hand dead in the center of
my back.</B>
<BR><B>While not extermely alarming, I was still frightened, so I ran upstairs
and</B>
<BR><B>refused to go back down for days.</B>
<BR><B>However, my feeling of his presense didnt end there...a few days
after I was</B>
<BR><B>driving in the car (windows rolled up) with my mom and all of the
sudden I</B>
<BR><B>could smell stuffed bell peppers (a food I hated, but my dad loved).
The</B>
<BR><B>smell was so strong it made my eyes water and I started to cry,
and my mom,</B>
<BR><B>sitting only a few feet away couldn't smell it.</B>
<BR><B>After those incidents I knew he was with me, and I feel him everyday,
feel</B>
<BR><B>his eyes upon me and I think about him alot. My boyfriend says I
talk to him</B>
<BR><B>in my sleep and no one doubts me when I tell them he is there.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Work Place</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lc6196@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>A couple of years back I worked for a nationally established autoparts
store in Bakersfield CA.&nbsp; I worked at this particular store for a
couple of years and previously was a skeptic when it came to the paranormal.&nbsp;
After working there for only a month I became a true believer.&nbsp; It
all started when one evening I was doing the closing paperwork and one
of my employees was cleaning up.&nbsp; I was starltled by her loud scream
and then the sound of something sliding across the floor.&nbsp; I was quick
to check out the situation and was told that an oil filter levitated off
of a shelf and was flung down the isle.&nbsp; I passed it off as a practical
joke.</B>
<BR><B>Later that week I was told by the store manager about a brutal murder
of an assistant manager that had happened in the building about 7-8 years
earlier, and that many people have had different experiences in the store.&nbsp;
I soon learned about different experiences from everyone else.&nbsp; Although
I was still skeptical I was to soon find out that there was something going
on in that building.&nbsp; It started with things falling off shelves,&nbsp;
then there was the TV.&nbsp; At the store there was a TV in the managers
office that all of a sudden decided to turn on and off at will.&nbsp; It
was kind of funny that it would turn on and off by it's self when you would
walk by it or lock the store up the night before and be the first one through
the door in the morning and find it on.&nbsp; However it was a different
story one day when I decided to eat my lunch in the office and while sitting
there alone the TV decided to turn on.&nbsp; The hair on my neck stood
up as the volume turned up and the channels began to change.&nbsp; After
a few seconds I said out loud that there was nothing on TV, and the TV
turned off.&nbsp; I quickly left the room.</B>
<BR><B>Then there was the instance where the store was empty except for
another manager and I.&nbsp; We were up at the front of the store conversing
when from the rear of the store we heard a voice of an old lady call out
his name.&nbsp; We stopped talking and I asked him if he heard that.&nbsp;
He looked very frightened and refused to talk about it and would not speak
to me the rest of the evening.</B>
<BR><B>After a while of no experiences, one night after hours. I was up
above the restrooms in the back room where we kept all the store fixtures.&nbsp;
I had a eye shot of both isles below me leading back to the front room.&nbsp;
That night when I was up there I saw what I thought was the other assistant
manager walking down the isle and into the restroom below me.&nbsp; I needed
help lifting up some items so I looked over the edge and called his name,
there was no response.&nbsp; I noticed that the lights in both restrooms
were off and realized that I could hear the noise of the calculator in
the office up front.&nbsp; It took a few minutes for me to come down from
up there, but when I did, I did it quickly and stood next to the other
manager the next hour until we left.</B>
<BR><B>After that experience I always felt eyes on me and a couple times
when I was in the back alone washing my hands I would see between my legs,
a pair of black shoes walk closely past me.&nbsp; After these experiences
I became a true believer.</B>

<P><B>My family and I moved to this ranch with our friends. When we got
here, they (as in our friends) put their three horses out to pasture by
a road. About a week into the school year someone took down the fence and
a mare got loose. Then later someone found her dead on the side of the
road... I think. any way&nbsp; sometime after that my parents saw a shadow
of a horse on the barn, only problem was all the horses were in the barn
or in the sheds. They said the shadow looked so real like the horse was
stand next to the barn with the wind in it's mane on a calm evening. I
thought this story was interesting not scary, just interesting.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Ghost Cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: WENDYEDWIN@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>25 yrs ago I lived in an old house in Belmar, NJ.</B>
<BR><B>For all the years I'd lived there-never had any ghostly encounters.</B>
<BR><B>After having resided there around 5 years, I began seeing a white
cat</B>
<BR><B>walking through the dining room....over &amp; over again-like an
instant</B>
<BR><B>replay.</B>
<BR><B>I really thought I was "loosing it". No one else who was there with
me</B>
<BR><B>saw it.</B>
<BR><B>I was in the basement one day, cleaning up old coal ashes and there
he</B>
<BR><B>was...a perfectly preserved white cat....exactly underneath the
spot</B>
<BR><B>above I'd been "halucinating" seeing him pass by repeatedly.</B>
<BR><B>I showed him to my housemate-whose family had built the house in
early</B>
<BR><B>1800's-and he said when he was a child he had lost a white cat named</B>
<BR><B>"Puff"-25 years ago- and he was sure that it was him.</B>
<BR><B>The old furnace had exlpoded in the basement and he apparently was
down</B>
<BR><B>there and died as a result.</B>
<BR><B>After having found him - I never saw him again. Very sad, but true</B>
