<b><font size=+1>Balls of Light</font></b>
<p><b>by:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rmr3599@worldnet.att.net</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early part of 74' I and
three other people saw</b>
<br><b>numerous balls of light in a wooded area in the Florida Panhandle.
The</b>
<br><b>area mentioned was off Hwy. 20 between Freeport and Bruce Fla. on
the</b>
<br><b>northern side of Hwy. 20 in a commercial pine forest.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the others had
been parking with a date the</b>
<br><b>night before and had seen several of these lights.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
turned north</b>
<br><b>off the Hwy. and to my recollection went @ 300 ft up an unimproved
road.</b>
<br><b>The road was not a through road but more of a trail that came to
a small</b>
<br><b>turn-around.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We stopped the car and turned the motor off and sat approx.
15 to 20</b>
<br><b>min..&nbsp; during that time we did not see anything.</b>
<br><b>Then appearing off in the distance a light just to the northeast
through</b>
<br><b>the trees. The trees in the being pines were pretty tall and fairly</b>
<br><b>close together. Due to this being the case the lower limbs were
not too</b>
<br><b>heavily branched. The light I guess, was probably @ 200 ft away
from us.</b>
<br><b>I asked&nbsp; the one who lived in the area and saw the lights the
night</b>
<br><b>before if there was a house over there. He said there weren't any
houses</b>
<br><b>anywhere in that area.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We watched the light move back and forth through the trees
and then</b>
<br><b>it separated into two distinct lights as a set of car headlights
would</b>
<br><b>appear. These now, two lights were&nbsp; getting closer to the car.
I asked</b>
<br><b>my buddy if there was a road over there and he stated again that
there</b>
<br><b>wasn't "anything" over in that area, just trees.</b>
<br><b>The lights started going back and forth in a crisscrossing pattern
and</b>
<br><b>all the time getting closer. I'm not sure of the time frame it took
for</b>
<br><b>the lights to reach the area of the car, but would guess 10 minutes.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; my recollection the
lights were of cantaloupe</b>
<br><b>size and the color of these were of a white center and a bluish
outer</b>
<br><b>fuzzy halo type of light.&nbsp; These were not extremely bright
lights,</b>
<br><b>but more of a glowing foggy ball. They were bright enough that when
they</b>
<br><b>floated up next to tree you could make out the branch and the clumps
of</b>
<br><b>pine needles upon the branches.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really know where they came
from but other balls</b>
<br><b>of light appeared after the first two came into the area where we
were.</b>
<br><b>But I do know they did not come through the woods as the first two
did.</b>
<br><b>My recollection is kind of dim here but I know there were at least
a</b>
<br><b>total of 6 lights to 12 at the most. The lights moved back and forth
and</b>
<br><b>up and down in various patterns. I do not remember if there was
a breeze</b>
<br><b>or not but the lights did</b>
<br><b>not move in the same direction as if being blown around by a wind,
they</b>
<br><b>each moved independently of each other. This was really different
from</b>
<br><b>the first two lights as they moved together.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lights were just in the area
of the car and nowhere</b>
<br><b>else.&nbsp; They did come up over the car and in front and behind
us. They</b>
<br><b>came within several feet of us .&nbsp; At one point I turned on
the car</b>
<br><b>headlights and we did not see anything, I then turned the lights
off and</b>
<br><b>did not see the balls of light, but then noticed they were upon
the</b>
<br><b>ground. They then started rising up off the ground and floating
around</b>
<br><b>again..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure how long we sat and
watched these lights</b>
<br><b>but I estimate that after first sighting the first lights we watched</b>
<br><b>them a good hour to an hour and a half.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We finally decided it was time to go and
I can't remember</b>
<br><b>if we turned around or backed out to the highway but the lights
were</b>
<br><b>still present when we left.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We told some co-workers about our encounter
but got the</b>
<br><b>usual razzing. We talked a little about the lights but never really</b>
<br><b>discussed exactly what each other saw that night. To me now looking
back</b>
<br><b>this was really odd.&nbsp; During the last 24 some years I reasoned
that</b>
<br><b>these were swamp gas or something of the sorts.&nbsp; But logically,
we</b>
<br><b>were not in a wet area as we had no trouble with any kind of standing</b>
<br><b>water , or trouble getting into the area where we saw these.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>lights did not change in intensity, did not change colors anytime,
did</b>
<br><b>not&nbsp; burn out, nor did new ones appear. The fuzzy mass did
seem to</b>
<br><b>move around within it self though.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have recently talked&nbsp; to one of the other guys that
was with us</b>
<br><b>that night and he said he had not thought about the lights in years.
He</b>
<br><b>really did not say much more except that they were strange.. About
two</b>
<br><b>weeks later I called him again and brought up the subject again
and</b>
<br><b>asked him what color they were and he remembered them being a greenish</b>
<br><b>color and foggy. This being different than mine as I remember a
bluish</b>
<br><b>fuzzy light.&nbsp; He said he didn't remember how many there were
but he</b>
<br><b>just knew it was more than one.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time this was a chilling event&nbsp;
as we locked</b>
<br><b>the car doors when the lights approached the car. Another person</b>
<br><b>suggested that they might have been checking us out. I'm not trying
to</b>
<br><b>tell you this was some kind of intelligence but it does seem that
we</b>
<br><b>were being checked out. We were the only ones there and the lights
came</b>
<br><b>to us, then more appeared and then they stayed right there with
us the</b>
<br><b>whole time...</b>
<br><b>I've conveyed this to several researchers and have had several</b>
<br><b>responses. One of which is that the way the lights were acting and
the</b>
<br><b>length of time that they were illuminated, this was not swamp gas.</b>
<br><b>Another was that these types of lights are usually present where
a UFO</b>
<br><b>has been recently present. The only other explaination is</b>
<br><b>that they might have been a spirit form.</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Everything is Missing</font></b>
<p><b>By: maryh@bmcloans.com</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I moved into a new house seven months ago.&nbsp; Two months
after I</b>
<br><b>moved in, I started to notice very strange things.&nbsp; The first
couple of</b>
<br><b>weeks (when it started) the front door would slam shut about twice
a</b>
<br><b>day.&nbsp; I corrected this problem by always locking the door.&nbsp;
A few days</b>
<br><b>later, I noticed the front porch swinging , even though there was
no</b>
<br><b>wind.&nbsp; This went on for a couple of days until I chose to completely</b>
<br><b>ignore it.&nbsp; Then the worst started happening.&nbsp; Every night
when I would</b>
<br><b>get ready for bed in the bathroom, the wall of the bathroom would
just</b>
<br><b>start pounding.&nbsp; Almost like someone was trying to scratch
or knock it</b>
<br><b>down.&nbsp; This would last about 15 seconds, every night.&nbsp;
The wall where</b>
<br><b>these sounds would occur was the wall next to my bedroom, with the
attic</b>
<br><b>stairs in between.&nbsp; If my boyfriend was spending the night,
I would run</b>
<br><b>into the bedroom while the noise was happening to see if he was
playing</b>
<br><b>a joke on me.&nbsp; He wasn't.&nbsp; This stopped after almost two
months and then</b>
<br><b>things would disappear and re-appear where I knew they hadn't been</b>
<br><b>before.&nbsp; I lost an earring and for two days I looked for it.&nbsp;
Then it</b>
<br><b>appeared setting next to the earring I had not lost.&nbsp; The funny
thing</b>
<br><b>about that is, I was so frustrated with things disappearing, that
I had</b>
<br><b>hid the earring -and the matching&nbsp; lost earring still appeared
next to</b>
<br><b>it (two days later).&nbsp; Everything that disappeared were things
I needed</b>
<br><b>and would notice were gone.&nbsp; They would always appear&nbsp;
later, where they</b>
<br><b>weren't before.&nbsp; When the disappearing acts stopped, "my ghost"
made an</b>
<br><b>appearance.&nbsp; I was blow drying my hair in the morning and I
saw my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend standing in the hall (from the corner of my eye) looking
at</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I thought he was mad because I hadn't shut the door and
the</b>
<br><b>blowdryer was loud.&nbsp; I finished and went into the bedroom to
apologize</b>
<br><b>and he was sound asleep and he swears he was never up.&nbsp; I know
I saw a</b>
<br><b>male figure watching me.&nbsp; Recently the milk and O.J. disappeared
out of</b>
<br><b>the fridge and we found the milk in the cabinet and the O.J. in
the</b>
<br><b>sunroom.&nbsp; I also hear twinkling sometimes around the top of
the blinds</b>
<br><b>of the front window.&nbsp; I usually hear the twinkling after I
feel a weird</b>
<br><b>feeling or chills.&nbsp; I just really feel that something is wrong.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>sounds in the bathroom always made me feel like&nbsp; I wanted to
cry and</b>
<br><b>they really didn't scare me that much.&nbsp; It was almost like
a forced</b>
<br><b>feeling. I don't know if I should confront theses occurances or
continue</b>
<br><b>to ignore them?</b>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Grey Cloud Island Cemetary-St. Paul Park......Entrance to the cemetary
is marked with a sign warning late night visitors not to enter between
sunset &amp; sunrise.&nbsp; Upon entering the cemetary it is obviously
colder inside the cemetary then on the outside, a noticeable calmness is
also present, fog is sometimes also present along with the other conditions.&nbsp;
Visiting group sizies vary from 2 to 10, stange phenomina occur less frequently
when larger groups are present.&nbsp; On many occasions 2 people enter
the cemetary and experience several differnent types</b>
<br><b>of phenomina such as orbs, moving shadows, high-pitched moans originating
from in front and behind or either side, sudden gusts of wind blow throughout
and only inside the cemetary along with the presence of rustling of leaves
on the tops of the trees although no leaves where in the trees.&nbsp; The
ghost of Chief Grey Cloud &amp; his horse is also present walking along
side in the woods outside of the cemetary while whistling(communicating
with other indian sprits) and stopping once you enter the cemetery.&nbsp;
A mysterious grey&nbsp; truck has also been sighted,</b>
<br><b>local legend has it that a man was driving past the cemetary when
he suddenly lost control of his truck and plunged into the Mississippi
river.&nbsp; The end of the legend warns that if you see a grey truck 3
times, you will not make it out of Grey Cloud Island alive.&nbsp; Only
2 sightings have occured, 1 sighting outside the cemetary gate, another
while driving out of the cemetary.&nbsp; The occupants quickly turned around
to follow the truck, and as soon as they caught up to where the truck was
supposed to be, the truck was no where to be found, the roads leading to
and from the cemetary are very twisty and curvy, making it impossible for
a truck to make 15 to 20 mph turns doing 50+</b>
<br><b>mph.&nbsp; I sencerely believe that this place is seriously haunted
due to the fact that I have experienced so many of these strange occurences.&nbsp;
My only advice to those who venture out to the cemetery is to come with
a fast car, an open mind, good running shoes.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Germany Ghost Experience</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: jnorman@kscable.com</b>
<p><b>In 1980 I was assigned to Spangdahlem Airbase in Germany. There was
very</b>
<br><b>limited family housing available on-base so most military families
had to</b>
<br><b>live off-base. This was called "living on the economy". I was "fortunate"
to</b>
<br><b>find a house not too far away in the village of Picklesheim (pik-lee-sum).
I</b>
<br><b>was eager to rent a house so my wife and children would be able
to come over</b>
<br><b>from the States and stay with me. The house was old enough that
the stone</b>
<br><b>steps in the front of the house were worn about 1/3rd of the way
through</b>
<br><b>from the wear of feet. The first floor had the living room, dining
area and</b>
<br><b>kitchen. The second floor had sort of a split level appearance.
There was a</b>
<br><b>large walkin closet to the right of the stairs, the 1st bedroom
on the</b>
<br><b>right, the 2nd bedroom on the right and the bathroom on the left,
up 2 steps</b>
<br><b>and then the last two bedrooms on the right and left. The last bedroom
on</b>
<br><b>the left had a window that looked into the bathroom. The 3rd floor
was the</b>
<br><b>attic. There was a "smoking chamber" built onto the chimney that&nbsp;
had a door</b>
<br><b>on it. I assume the chamber was big enough to walk into, but I never
went</b>
<br><b>into it, as you will read about in a little while.</b>
<p><b>We were only in the house a short time when we knew the house had
some other</b>
<br><b>occupants. There wasn't too much activity on the first floor, just
the</b>
<br><b>feeling of being watched or seeing something out of the corner of
your eye.</b>
<br><b>Since it mainly was in the kitchen area, I had the feeling it was
a female</b>
<br><b>entity. I guess she was just checking to see that we were keeping
"her"</b>
<br><b>house clean. The only thing that would happen would be an occasional</b>
<br><b>relocation of dishes as if "she" didn't like where we stored them.</b>
<p><b>The 2nd floor was where it started getting creepy. The closet at
the head of</b>
<br><b>the stairs was never used by us. The closet door had a screen window
for</b>
<br><b>ventilation. Both my wife and I distinctly saw a face pressed against
the</b>
<br><b>screen looking at us when we first unpacked. I, being stupider than
braver,</b>
<br><b>went into the closet to see if there was anything that might appear
like a</b>
<br><b>face. It was an empty closet, but my stomach was tied into knot
and I backed</b>
<br><b>out of the closet. We never put anything in that closet and I tacked
a cover</b>
<br><b>over the screen. We never moved that cover because we both knew
we would see</b>
<br><b>that face. My wife kept the window covered that looked into the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>because she felt someone watching her whenever she was taking a
bath. I went</b>
<br><b>into the bedroom, when will I ever learn, and looked through the
window to</b>
<br><b>reassure her that "nobody" would see her in the bathtub. While she
was</b>
<br><b>sitting in the tub and I was looking through the window I had the
distinct</b>
<br><b>impression that someone was standing behind me. (Waiting their turn,
I</b>
<br><b>guess). Needless to say, the towels stayed over the window looking
into the</b>
<br><b>bathroom. The 1st bedroom was our bedroom. Just about every night
around</b>
<br><b>10pm, my wife would hear the floor squeak and groan like someone
in stocking</b>
<br><b>feet was walking from her side of the bed to mine. I worked until
2am so</b>
<br><b>never really had a chance to hear it. When she told me about it,
I said it</b>
<br><b>was rats under the floor. (Yeah, thats a real reassuring thing to
tell her)</b>
<br><b>Well, one night I was home early and was in bed reading. 10pm, creak,
creak,</b>
<br><b>creak, someone is walking around the bed! I scoot over next to my
wife and</b>
<br><b>smooth out the blankets on my side. She says "Whats the matter?
Scared?" I</b>
<br><b>tell her, "No, but if somebody sits on my side of the bed, the suction
from</b>
<br><b>my running out of the room will pull you with me!" Nothing else
than what I</b>
<br><b>already described ever happened on the 2nd floor.</b>
<p><b>The 3rd floor almost killed me. There are 3 doors in the attic. The
stairway</b>
<br><b>door, the door into the "smoking chamber" and a door into thin air
over the</b>
<br><b>garage. That door is about 20 feet up and there is nothing under
except some</b>
<br><b>very hard concrete. The 1st time I went into the attic was to check
for</b>
<br><b>storage space. While looking around I checked out the door over
the garage</b>
<br><b>and found out it what it was. I went over to the "smoking chamber"
door and</b>
<br><b>was about to open it when I heard clear as day a voice behind me
say "Don't</b>
<br><b>open it". (I just had goosebumps raise up on me because I can still
hear</b>
<br><b>that voice.) I then had a vision of what I would have seen if I
had opened</b>
<br><b>that door, I would have seen the legs of the person who hung themself
in</b>
<br><b>that little room. I turned away and headed to the stairway door,
just in</b>
<br><b>time to keep it from swinging shut. Now I later checked that door
with a</b>
<br><b>level and plumbob, that door was hung to swing open, you have to
pull it</b>
<br><b>shut. There was no wind or air circulation to blow it closed. The
2nd time I</b>
<br><b>went up was to adjust the tv antenna, I put a wedge under the door.
I turned</b>
<br><b>around from adjusting the antenna and could see the upper half of
the door</b>
<br><b>bowing under pressure to push it closed. I kicked the door open,
moving the</b>
<br><b>wedge with my foot and jumped from the top of the stairs to the
next</b>
<br><b>landing. I didn't want to waste time walking, hell, running down
them. When</b>
<br><b>I hit the landing, I turned to look up the stairs, just in time
to see (and</b>
<br><b>hear) the door slam shut. The last time I went up there was the
last until</b>
<br><b>we moved out. It also was almost how "it" got me. I wedged the door
open</b>
<br><b>again and by the light of the stairway light was adjusting the antenna</b>
<br><b>again. When I was done, I walked to the open door getting ready
to do a</b>
<br><b>repeat of my "getting the hell outta the attic" manuever. Just as
I was</b>
<br><b>starting through the door, "something" stopped me. I had walked
to the open</b>
<br><b>doorway with the light shining through it. Like a curtain had lifted,
I</b>
<br><b>could see another doorway with a light shining through it, THE STAIRWAY</b>
<br><b>LIGHT!!! Somehow, the doorway over the garage which is never opened
and had</b>
<br><b>been locked was open. Somehow, my view of the stairway door had
been</b>
<br><b>obscured by something black almost long enough for me to have exited
through</b>
<br><b>a doorway that would have landed me on a concrete floor. I scrambled
through</b>
<br><b>the right door, locking the attic door behind me. When I came downstairs,
my</b>
<br><b>wife was shocked at my appearance, I was as white as a sheet, drenched
in</b>
<br><b>sweat and trembling like a leaf. I told her never under ANY circumstance
was</b>
<br><b>she to go to the attic. Later, I took some water and salt to the
attic steps</b>
<br><b>and placed a "barrier" across the doorway. I know it may not have
been the</b>
<br><b>proper things to use but it has always worked for me before. In
all of the</b>
<br><b>house, I never once felt the usual cold spots, foul odors or any
of the</b>
<br><b>other signals. Thats right, not even in the attic. I had asked the
neighbors</b>
<br><b>about the house and it's history and everyone of them assured me
"Why, No I</b>
<br><b>never heard anything like that".</b>
<p><b>Sorry for such a long story but it was quite a lot of things that
happened.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Angry Grandmother</font></b>
<p><b>By: bharper23@hotmail.com</b>
<p><b>When I was 9 my grandfather died in the dining room of his house,
it was not unexpected; he had been very ill and was bed ridden.&nbsp; Shortly
after his death we moved in with my grandmother due to the fact that she
was also ill.&nbsp; She was a very unhappy and hateful person, she blamed
all of life’s injustice on my late grandfather and hated him for dieing.&nbsp;
After we moved in with her we realized how serious he illness was and took
her to the doctor, she had Alzheimer’s.&nbsp; As her illness progressed
my parents could no longer take care of her and 4 children so</b>
<br><b>they placed he in a nursing home.&nbsp; Big mistake, she transferred
all of her anger from my late grandfather onto my father.&nbsp; During
the last stages of her illness she would repeatedly tell us that she did
not want to be buried near my grandfather, that she had spent all of her
living years with him and she did not want to spend eternity next to him.</b>
<br><b>Well as fate would have it when my grandmother passed away funds
were tight and we not only had to bury with my grandfather but her casket
was placed on top of his.&nbsp; We had no other choice because all of the
extra money we had for her funeral was used to care for her in the home.&nbsp;
Anyway, on with the story . . . after my grandmother’s death strange things
began to happen.&nbsp; During dinner the back door would just fly open
or at night the sheet would be tucked tight around my body while I slept.&nbsp;
We always made jokes say that grandfather was home or he was</b>
<br><b>looking in on us.&nbsp; Then things took a turn for the worse, one
night my father awoke to the sensation of his legs being pressed into the
waterbed mattress.&nbsp; Once he was fully awake he realized he could not
move and whatever was pressing him into the mattress was continuing up
his body.&nbsp; He glanced over to get my mothers attention but could not
speak, this entity was now cutting of this breathing!&nbsp; Finally he
thought mom I am sorry I had nowhere else to put you and then it all stopped,
as fast as it started.&nbsp; The next morning at breakfast was when</b>
<br><b>dad told us about his experience.&nbsp; The next night I had a similar
experience but chalked it up to dreaming.&nbsp; I figured that I heard
my dad telling us about his experience and that I was just dreaming based
on that.</b>
<br><b>Now lets jump ahead 9 years, I am married and have just given birth
to my first son.&nbsp; It was morning time and my husband had already left
for&nbsp; work, I thought I would take a short nap and rest while that
baby was not fussing.&nbsp; So I doze off to that place between sleep and
wakefulness where you are not totally asleep but resting, when I begin
to feel my body being pressed down into my waterbed mattress.&nbsp; I could
not open my eyes but I knew I was awake I could hear the television and
my son cooing, I could not move and then I began to hear this</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;voice, a horrible evil voice that not even word can describe
saying “You know I love you, you know I love you” this went on for what
seemed&nbsp; like eternity but was only probably about 2 minutes.&nbsp;
Then in my mind I thought dear God what is my baby seeing and just as quickly
as it started it stopped.&nbsp; I have not had any experiences since then
and that was 2 years ago.&nbsp; My question is, was it my angry grandmother
or something else. If anyone has any suggestions please email me at bharper23@hotmail.com.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Another story from me.</font></b>
<p><b>By: BLynne18@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I can see and sense "ghosts" all of the time. I have a "gift" to
do this.</b>
<br><b>Everywhere I go, I know their there watching me. I have seen "ghosts
my whole</b>
<br><b>life. I've seen them materialize right in front of me and disappear
right in</b>
<br><b>front of me. Yet it still scares me to my wits end. ANYWAYS.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A couple days ago I was following my cat around the apartment
(he was into</b>
<br><b>destroying things again). I was walking towards the back when I
was</b>
<br><b>approaching the bathroom I got an overwhelming feeling of dread,
then I heard</b>
<br><b>a sound like someone was struggling to breath. I went back into
my mom's</b>
<br><b>bedroom where I had started to follow my cat around. My mom's dog's
head was</b>
<br><b>up and his ears were standing tall like he was listening to something.
Then</b>
<br><b>just 2 days ago I was sitting at the computer in my mom's room and
her dog</b>
<br><b>was on the bed right in my view. My cat was who knows where. I saw
out of the</b>
<br><b>corner of my eye a cat's head poke around the corner by the door.
When I</b>
<br><b>turned my head to call for my cat, the head just disappeared. My
mom's dog</b>
<br><b>was staring into the hallway and he started shaking. Just then my
cat came</b>
<br><b>flying into the room and underneith the bed. I knew it was the ghost
cat that</b>
<br><b>I have seen so many times before.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I hope you've enjoyed all the many stories I have submitted

<p><b><font size=+1>Ghost Moves With Us</font></b>
<p><b>By:garn@cableregina.com</b>
<p><b>&nbsp; My first experience happened when I was about 7 years old.I
was in the</b>
<br><b>playroom in the basement when Iwas overcome with terror for no reason.I</b>
<br><b>would close my eyes and count to 5,on 5 I would run as fast as I
could</b>
<br><b>upstairs,not looking back.I felt cold on my back all the way</b>
<br><b>upstairs.This happend for about 3 years,only in the basement and
only to</b>
<br><b>me.My mother felt this once in the rec-room which was to later be
my</b>
<br><b>room.When I was 12 I moved in to the basement rec-room and got the</b>
<br><b>feeling on my first night.Shortly after I began having nightmares
and my</b>
<br><b>room would get very cold even with my waterbed heater turned hottest.Two</b>
<br><b>of my friends also experienced a terror feeling with me on separate</b>
<br><b>occasions.The last year we lived in that house I was just dozing
off one</b>
<br><b>night when a model fighter-jet on my dresser began to rock from</b>
<br><b>wing-to-wing violently.Iflung my lamp on and for 5-10 seconds,rocked
to</b>
<br><b>a halt. I threw the model across my room and slept on the couch</b>
<br><b>upstairs.The last year we lived in that house I frequently seen
shadows</b>
<br><b>behind the old bar and on the ceiling.I also seen about four tiny
sets</b>
<br><b>of red eyes on top of and beside the bar.I pulled the covers over
my</b>
<br><b>head till mourning.We moved when I was 13,much to my relief and
I was</b>
<br><b>untroubled for the first year.One night while I layed in bed,I heard
the</b>
<br><b>sound of feet slowly dragging on the carpet in the hall outside
my</b>
<br><b>room.It was as though they stayed in one spot rather than going
up and</b>
<br><b>down the hallway.When I got up to look the noise stopped and I seen
that</b>
<br><b>my parents and brother,their rooms on either side of mine,lay fast</b>
<br><b>asleep.When I went back to bed,the noises came back.This happend
on and</b>
<br><b>off,once again only to me and once to my brother.Myself,my brother,my</b>
<br><b>mother and friends all felt the terror feeling in the sub-basement
where</b>
<br><b>the washing machine and a small T.V.room were located.The house
was a</b>
<br><b>bi-level split with four half-floors,most of the abnormal occuring
on</b>
<br><b>the top and bottom floors.The doors in the sub-basement would sometimes</b>
<br><b>slam shut or swing open with force .The most frightening incident</b>
<br><b>occured one night when I was home by myself .My dog,a pitbull terrier</b>
<br><b>started to snarl at the dining room corner,the hair on his back
straight</b>
<br><b>up.I felt safe with the dog and mistakenly joked to the presence</b>
<br><b>that,"the dog would cut it up like a razor" and I must have angered</b>
<br><b>whatever it was because the heat vent in the floor started to shake</b>
<br><b>wildly,almost coming right out of the floor.The dog attacked the
vent</b>
<br><b>savagely and repeatedly lunged at nothing.The dog even shook his
head</b>
<br><b>like he had something in his jaws.This went on for about 2-3 minutes</b>
<br><b>until I could call the dog off.The room felt like a deepfreeze.The
last</b>
<br><b>incident in that house occured when we were moving from the house
to our</b>
<br><b>present house.I was spending the night at the old house and my family</b>
<br><b>stayed at the new one as we had belongings in both houses.It was</b>
<br><b>2:43am.I remember looking at the clock on the VCR when I was startled</b>
<br><b>awake by the sound of breaking billiard balls on our pool table
in the</b>
<br><b>sub-basement.I ran to the switch at the top of the stairs and flicked
it</b>
<br><b>on to see a few balls rolling on the table,a fresh break as I racked
the</b>
<br><b>balls after I played that afternoon.The room was cold and I was
overcome</b>
<br><b>by an intense feeling of anxiety and nervousness opposed to fear.I
told</b>
<br><b>my parents sometime later and they told me that same night in the
new</b>
<br><b>house,they were woke by the sound of a baby crying,distinctly coming</b>
<br><b>from inside the house but on investigation of the entire house they</b>
<br><b>found nothing.Only one thing has happend to me in our new house
in our 6</b>
<br><b>years here.One night I lay in bed reading and I clearly heard music,all</b>
<br><b>favorite songs of mine coming from nowhere.I got up and searched
around</b>
<br><b>the house for a source such as a T.V. or stereo but the house was
dead.I</b>
<br><b>went back to bed and the music returned word for word,note for note
for</b>
<br><b>about an hour.All were favorite songs of mine except one short song
that</b>
<br><b>I 've never heard before.I was definetely awake and hearing it.It
was</b>
<br><b>clear and quiet and distinct.I said thank-you when the music stopped
and</b>
<br><b>to this day nothing else out of the ordinary has happened except</b>
<br><b>occasional flickering of lights in the basement.It has been 6 years.My</b>
<br><b>friend has also had some activity in his house,just a block from
the</b>
<br><b>second house and 5 blocks from the first house.He has the same sound
of</b>
<br><b>feet on carpet and his dad has seen the figure of a woman in white</b>
<br><b>twice.A few others in the area also report weird activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is</b>
<br><b>believed that this area of regina was a large burial ground bought
from</b>
<br><b>the Indians around 1940.</b>
