Ghosts in my Home<br>
<br>
<br>
By: suzanne@mayercorp.com<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Growing up In Gardena we didnt have ghosts it was a quiet town. But at
the age of 6 we had strange things happening in our house. One of these
was a visitor in all white glowing with a bright white light that
surrounded him, I mean you could feel it vibrate from his body... and
he would hover above the ground in our hallway between our living room
and dining room holding a bookand in his hands.. My dad tried to read
it, and the mysterious visitor heldit out for my dad, but the light was
so bright, he couldnt, my mom said seh read it but never told us what
it said. But the air around him was all static charged and warm when he
would vanish. He would just show up every now and then. And repeat the
motion of us to read the book.<br>
The second event was a bit&nbsp; scary- we had a dear family friend
that was my grandmothers neighbor- her name was Rosie and we called her
Grandma Rosie, well her nephew sent her to a nursing home because he
didnt want to deal with her anymore, he prefrred to travel... My
younger brother and I, we jsut hated to see her there in the
place...and we didnt want to see her like that, it was so hard&nbsp; to
go. Well one day she died, natural causes they said.....her nephew had
her cremated, and didnt tell us, until after he had done it. We were
brokenhearted..we missed our grandma Rosie and our grandmother Bea was
so upset she had just lost her best friend. Well about&nbsp; a month
later, the phone we had in the back of the house by the bedrooms rang
and it was a seperate number from our main phone, so I answered it and
I heard just static but very loud static and whispering and clicking
sounds. Because I couldnt make out any voices, I handed the phone to my
mom, she said hello? hello? and then my mom said, Rosie is that you?
and then you heard through the static, Belle? Belle? where are my
babies? how are my babies? So my mom answered, Oh Rosie, we love you so
much, the babies are here they miss you but are ok, please take care
Rosie we love you so much and&nbsp; we miss you..Then Rosie said, "Take
care of my babies- I love my babies.." Then my mom handed me the phone
and I said, I love you grandma Rosie, and then there was static and
voices and clicking on the phone line again, then it went to dial tone.
<br>
My younger brother and I were called "Her Babies". Rosie never had kids
and it was only Rosie and her nephew who treated her with little love.
Everytime I tell this story, I remember her and how much she loved us.
I am 39 now, and I hear her voice like it was yesterday.<br>

Story for the Website<br>
<br>
By: jesssikahhh_x3@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I have a story. My grandmother died recently, about 8 months ago
actually. Since she died there have been a lot of mysterious things
happening. My grandfater has reported seeing her twice, having actually
talked to her. Once the day after she died, and the last on their
wedding anniverary in February. He also reports that when he's sleeping
he feels her grabbing his toes to wake him up, something she used to do
all the time when she was alive. Me and my mom have since moved in with
my grandfather for various resons and I have to say, I have had some
experiences myself. As I'm writing this I'm pretty sure she's in the
room with me.<br>
The first of my experiences happened while living in my old house. I
had just drove to my grandpa's house for the first time(I had my
learners permit) and&nbsp; I had a dream that night, she told me she
was proud of me. Then next time I heard anything from her was a few
weeks later, I had decided to start collecting Vinyl. She had an old
record player but I wasnt sure if it worked, I asked my granpa and he
said no, it doesnt work. I had a dream that night where she told me
"Dont listen to you Papa, he doesnt know what he's talking about. The
record player works, take it." The next day I went to my grandpa's
house and me and my mom were trying to get the record player to work.
My mom turned it on, and it did nothing. We went back upstairs, and I
was like "She wouldnt have told me it worked if it didnt." So I went
back in the cellar and turned it on. I just put a record on it, and it
just started working, just like that. It sounded perfect.<br>
More Recently I have felt her rubbing my back one night. And I have
felt her presence. My whole family was here on my grandpa's birthday
and there is a picture on top of the tv of my grandparents at my
parents wedding. It never falls over. It kept falling over, if someone
tried to make it stand up, as soon as they werent touching it, it fell
over.<br>
That's all for now. But I'm sure there will be more. Thanks for reading.<br>

My Stories<br>
<br>
By: moistlips2@wildmail.com<br>
<br>
I find your web site stories amazing and thought provoking. Used to be
I found it difficult to believe 'ghost stories' I would hear from
friends and family. I thought it was just wishful thinking on their
part. My youngest sister and her husband claim to have many experiences
with spirits. Anyway, on to my own story. My parents were the
caretakers for a women's club in Pomona, CA for twenty-four years. They
lived in an apartment upstairs in the clubhouse, which was 102 years
old. I was the Philanthropy Chairman and vice-president of the club for
the last five years it existed. The clubhouse had a large hall that was
rented out for wedding receptions and other events. My mother died in
her sleep in the clubhouse in 2003. I was forced to take over her
duties as the club manager to help my dad out. Several weeks after mom
passed away, on a Saturday night, a birthday party was happening. I was
in the big hall talking to the two DJ's while they set up their
equipment.! It was their first time at the Ebell Club. Everything went
as normal that evening, but at the end of the night, one of the
Security guards came to me and told me that one of the DJ's had ask him
who the woman was that stayed on stage all night watching them work. He
then described my mother, even down to her beautiful painted nails. The
party was for a Mexican family and all of the guests were Hispanic, my
family is Caucasian as was the woman they described. My mom was only 4'
11 inches tall with beautiful silver hair. She always dressed like a
million dollars. The DJ's had never met her nor were they aware that
she had died in the building yet the woman they saw had to be mom! Mom
loved the Ebell Club very much and I could understand her wanting to be
there. I will tell my other story later, I'm too emotional right now.
Thanks for your time. <br>

A Dinner I won't Forget<br>
<br>
By: whoredogg69@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
March 20 1999, my dad passed away with cancer and June of the same
year, my mother passed away also.&nbsp; Anyways, I have a stepsister
that lives in Arkansas and my mom said before she died, she wanted to
see her grandkids.&nbsp; So my mom, my ex girlfrind (at the time) and
myself were on our way to Arkansas.&nbsp; When we got back to our
homestate, we all was there at my mom's house.&nbsp; My stepsister had
to leave a few days later, so my stepsister wanted to go out and have a
few drinks before she left, so we did.&nbsp; I remember my mom sitting
at the dining room table playing Skip-Bo (some card game) in her night
gown and the rest of us took off for a few hours of fun.&nbsp; We
arrived back home about 1 am and we all went to bed.&nbsp; The next
morning, my stepsister woke me up (i guess i had a hangover) and said
"mom wasnt waking up", so i threw on some pants and went to her room
and as soon as i touched her arm to shake her slightly, i knew without
a doubt she had passed.&nbsp; It was about 3 days later,&nbsp; my ex
girlfriend and some of her family was over to the house and they made
spaghetti and my brother was in the living room reading the paper, all
of a sudden, my mom's bedroom light came on and the bathroom sink came
on FULL blast and i (somewhat chicken at the time) went to look and no1
was there and as i sit here and think about it, it still gives me
chills.....Thankx<br>

Faith in Jesus<br>
<br>

I have always believed in GOD,&nbsp; but have not been a devout
Christian.&nbsp; We went to church as youngsters, but haven&#8217;t been avid
churchgoers since.&nbsp; One evening I was putting my daughter to
bed.&nbsp; I always stay with her until she falls asleep.&nbsp; She had
fallen asleep, and I was just lying there contemplating on getting back
up when I saw this white orb appearing very small and getting
larger.&nbsp; Then it would disappear, and another one would take its
place just to the right of the other one.&nbsp; This sequence happened
three, maybe four times when I finally started feeling brave and said
outloud, Bring It ON!&nbsp; Now you have to understand that I thought
possibly these were angels or Passed on loved ones that were trying to
communicate with me.&nbsp; As soon as I said this, both orbs appeared
and started getting bigger.&nbsp; 1 or 2 seconds later, to the right of
these 2 orbs,&nbsp; I started seeing something else.&nbsp; Lets back
up.&nbsp; These orbs were the size of a baseball and they continued to
grow bigger after saying bring it on.&nbsp; I was very curious to see
exactly what it was I was seeing.&nbsp; Then just to the right of these
2 orbs, a deep, dark, and bright purple light appeared.&nbsp; It was
the color of a black light, but much more vivid.&nbsp; This purple
light continued to grow about the size of 2 maybe 3 heads worth.&nbsp;
As this light continued to grow, the 2 white, transparent orbs
continued to dissipate.&nbsp; After the purple, oval shaped light
stopped growing, and the 2 white orbs disappeared, I looked again at
the purple figurine, and what I saw would have brought me to my knees
had I been standing.&nbsp; Looking into this brilliant, beautiful
purple oval shaped mass, I distinctively saw our great Lord, JESUS&#8217;
face.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t tell you how humbled I was Looking into our LORDS
face.&nbsp; As I said in the beginning,&nbsp; I have always believed in
GOD, a higher being, but sometimes it takes actually seeing, to
believe.&nbsp; This is an experience that I will never forget,
ever.&nbsp; I now know that I had better watch my actions more
carefully because in the end,&nbsp; I will have to own up to my
sins.&nbsp; I do hope this story does indeed enlighten and encourage
those individuals out there that there is something definitely better
than this place we call life.&nbsp; AFTERLIFE!&nbsp; <br>
One other note before finishing,&nbsp; I am now a complete believer and
noone will ever be able to convince me
otherwise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

Ghost Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: hazerob@bvu.edu Ghost Experience<br>
<br>
Shadowlands:<br>
I recently experienced quite the night in Edson, a music building on
our campus at Buena Vista University, Storm Lake, IA.&nbsp; A small
group of my friends and I decided to stay the night in the upstairs
area of the building.&nbsp; Around midnight, we began to call out to
the ghosts, asking for their presence.<br>
As we waited a cold breeze shot up the elevator shaft and music chairs
and stands began sliding around in the choir room below us.&nbsp; This
continued for almost five minutes and then stopped.&nbsp; Other things
we experienced that night included knocking on doors, doors opening
which were previously locked, voices and piano sounds from locked
rooms, and lights and fans turning on by themselves.<br>
Other students have experienced basketball noises coming from the choir
and band rooms, which used to be the basketball court for the
campus.&nbsp; Other students have seen aspirations of ghosts and the
sounds of other instruments playing from empty rooms.<br>
Upstairs in the attic, there is just storage.&nbsp; However, the attic
used to house dorm rooms for students involved in athletics.&nbsp; Upon
going up there, you can still see the lines on the floor where the
walls used to be for the students' rooms.<br>
I am currently a senior at BVU.&nbsp; I plan on spending another night
with the small group in the building again soon to attempt experiencing
more.<br>

Haunted Michigan Personal Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: darc145@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Hi there<br>
My name is Darcey from Jackson,Michigan, writing to you about a
location on the Haunted Michigan website....In Vanderbilt, a very small
town wayyyy up north in Michigan, there is a cemetary listed, called
Fox Tower...My family has a cottage on Lake Louise, its about 2 miles
from the cemetary itself...you can see the tower that is adjacent to it
when you look across the lake...its very interesting,t he whole area,
really. Anyway, when my cousins and I were teenagers we would take
paper and crayons and do gravestone rubbings at the cemetary, some of
them were from the late 1800s and and very cool to look at.&nbsp; We
never went at night though, too creepy for me...there are even some
spots in the cemetary that I wont even step because the ground is so
soft and I dont want to imagine what would happen there!&nbsp; Well,
our cottage has been around since the late 1950s, and my uncle, mother
and aunt used to visit the cemetary as well.&nbsp; My uncle Paul was
about 14 and he and a friend used to go to the graveyard and look UNDER
the headstones for small items families used to leave there, like coins
and pieces of paper, which my grandfather warned him against but he
never listened. One day they were at it again and a fairly large
headstone he was standing next to tipped over out of nowhere onto his
foot and broke it.&nbsp; He never went back after that.&nbsp; Kind of
creepy!!!&nbsp; Anyway, the area is beautiful and during the day, the
graveyard is a pretty peaceful place, set back in the woods, but even
after going up there for nearly 23 years, I will never head there at
nite!&nbsp; Just thought you might enjoy that story!<br>

These are Ghosts<br>
<br>
<br>
By: staceydschmidt@comcast.net<br>
<br>
I wanted to share my story, but wasn't sure how.&nbsp; Well here it
goes. First off I will tell you who all was there. My sister, my
mother, my two nephews, my brother-in-law, my son, and myself.&nbsp; We
all went out for a drive to see these freaky houses. Well we ended up
going to a cemetery that is reported to be haunted. We all got out
(although my nephews chickened out and stayed in the van) my son, who
is 2, started shaking really bad and saying 'it's cold' which he never
says. My son never gets cold. Well we were walking around, and my
sister had my video camera trying to see if we could catch something on
film. About 20 minutes go by and we were just about to go when out of
nowhere it started to get freezing cold. It seemed to follow us out of
the cemetery. As soon as we got out of the cemetery it was warm. Well
it freaked us out some so we left. We decided to drive back, and my
sister and I got out of the car. Coming from the cemetery was this
really cold air.&nbsp; We said a prayer and left.&nbsp; We then decided
to go to another cemetery.&nbsp; We got out of the van for a little
while.&nbsp; Well in this one spot if you held the camera up you could
see 'lights' moving.&nbsp; I know for a fact it wasn't car lights
because I also got those on tape. Besides you could see the car lights
when the camera wasn't on that spot.&nbsp; You couldn't see these
'lights' with the naked eye. My mother was holding my 2yr old son and
he starts to get cold again and says mommy look at the bugs and he
pointed in the direction of the 'lights.' I never seen anything like
them.&nbsp; We freaked out some (and the fact that the cemetery isn't
hidden and we were afraid someone would call the cops) so we decided to
leave.&nbsp; When I got home I looked at the footage I got on my
camera. I got the same 'lights' in both cemeteries. The only problem is
you couldn't see them from the camera in the first one.&nbsp; In the
2nd cemetery the 'lights' seem to be dancing, and then it looks like
they attack each other.&nbsp; I fully believe that I have caught ghosts
on film.&nbsp; I know there are skeptics out there who will try their
best to disprove it, but I know for myself that these are ghosts. I
have found no other explanation for them. For the fact that they are
different colors, they move every way possible, and I just don't
believe they are bugs. I do have to say that I am a believer that
something was trying to reach out to us.<br>

The Distance is Relative<br>
<br>
<br>

My mother and father were taking care of one of our relatives. This
summer she passed away. The day before I had a feeling something bad
was going to happen, but I dismissed it because I was at work. There
everyday is a bad day. The next morning, my husband and I where on our
way to work and my parents called to tell us Roena had passed away. At
that time, I knew my feelings had been right.<br>
Since her passing our family has been contacted many times by Roena.
She likes to tickle the feet of my father and brother. My parents had
to stay on at the house to watch over things until her son got out of
jail. I have seen and sensed her many times. Once in the hallway, I saw
a shadow and its reflection pass in front of the mirror. Just a couple
of days after the funeral, my parents reported that something was
causing the magnets to fall off of the refrigerator. She has come to my
mother in dreams. In the most recent dream, she was telling my mother
that Randy was getting out of jail and we (meaning her and my mother)
needed to get the house ready. That morning, his older brother called
to say Randy would be home that day. I am glad that Roena is contacting
us because we miss her and love her very much. <br>
Her youngest son just got out of jail. He is now staying in her house
by himself. He hasn&#8217;t reported any abnormal phenomenon yet.<br>
