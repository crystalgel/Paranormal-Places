<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Creepy House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By: hotaugustnite28@sisna.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My story takes place in
1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had just moved into a small
house by myself but near some friends.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The house was part of a small group of houses built around a main front
lawn. My house was one bedroom and still had the original refrigerator from the
1930's.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">At first, it seemed like a nice
little place and it was close to work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes in the evening, I would hear water running and I would check
to see if I had forgotten to turn of a tap in the kitchen or bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everytime, there would be no water running,
not even a drip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As time went on, not
only would the running water sound continue, but I would get the feeling that
someone was walking around the house outside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had a small sidewalk on the kitchen side of the house that went to a
small backdoor and screen door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would
still sense that someone was walking all around the house at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This really freaked me out because our city
was experiencing a serial rapist and, of course, all of us girls were afraid of
being next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I chalked the feelings up to
being scared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Winter came and my little house
was never warm enough no matter how much I turned up the heat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the walls started to mold and the
sound of water was still happening every night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, I called the landlord to come and do something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came and opened a trap door in the floor
of the small storage room!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't even
know the door was there because moving boxes had been stacked on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He crawled down a small wooden ladder into an
earthen basement and checked all around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The basement was completely dry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a tap sticking out of the back wall of the basement, but it
was shut off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My landlord brought me a large
electric heater and that seemed to help with the mold a little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began to notice that even my clothes in the
closet and the towels in the bathroom always felt damp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The running water sound never stopped now,
and even the landlord heard it when he was checking my bathroom heater one
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was also starting to feel
depressed and had a very hard time falling asleep at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked a friend, who was/is quite psychic to
come over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had never told her of any
of the creepy things mostly because I was embarrassed about it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">She walked through the front door
and stood for a moment and looked around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told me that I needed to move as soon as possible because there was
an unhappy spirit attached to the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without any clue from me, she said there was a man (spirit), in his late
sixties who guarded the house, but probably stayed outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She made it clear, he wasn't guarding me, he
was guarding the house...in fact, the spirit didn't like me living there because
he didn't really like women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she
said that the water noise was happening to drive me out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made up my mind that day that I would find
a new place to live even if my year's lease wasn't up.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Then, it seemed I couldn't get
out of there fast enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, a few
weeks later, I came home to a very shaken landlord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My house smelled of smoke and he told me that
a fire had started in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said a cardboard box he had placed outside of the bathroom and somehow gotten
placed up next to the wall heater IN the bathroom and had he not come back to
finish fixing some tile, the house would have burned down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now everything was damp and smoky
smelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't stay there that
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to my parent's house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The next day, I called the
landlord and said I needed to move out because I was afraid to live there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he understood and let me out of the
rest of my lease.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About a month later,
I was packing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when all of a sudden I
heard cars screeching and racing down the street next to the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stepped outside to see what was going on
when two cars came flying past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
just enough time to see a small sports car and another sports car chasing
behind it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found out later that what I
had witnessed was the rapist being chased by undercover cops in an unmarked car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed like the little house was drawing
negative energy to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was never more
glad to move in my life!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The thing that looks like me</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By: ladymissy18@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">This is my first ghostly
experience of many.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was ten when it
happened I am nineteen now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was staying all night with a
friend and we were sitting up talking about what we wanted to do at that
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course we wanted to do some
pretty bizarre things at that time, I wanted to be a storm chaser and my friend
wanted to be a ghost hunter, in fact sometimes i think she still does after all
shes the one that told me about this website.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway I had to get up to go to the bathroom so i walked to her bathroom
which was down the hall at the main end of their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went and was coming back to my friends room
when i heard her scream, i started to run away but instead forced myself to go
back to her room, once i got there i saw myself standing over her bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It looked just like me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I screamed it turned and looked at me it was
like looking in a mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i ran away
then leaving her alone with the "me thing" for better lack of
words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the first time i ever
saw it and i kept seeing it for about five years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The scariest time i ever saw it
was when it was bending over me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was about four years ago, she'd told me that it might help to talk to it, so i
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked it what did it want, of
course it didn't answer me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So then i
asked it to go away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It kind of started
looking sad before it disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
not seen it since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My Dog Tipsy</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Three years ago i had a dog a
small <st1:State><st1:place>Chihuahua</st1:place></st1:State> named Tipsy she
was so pretty and sweet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Id had her six
years, when she was hit by a eighteen wheeler.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I cried for three weeks over her, then one night i heard little tapping on
the living room rug, it was the sound I'd grown used to over six years, it was
the sound Tipsy had made when she was alive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I ran to the living room almost forgetting that she had died, i got
there and it was her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was standing
there wagging her tail and barking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
then remembered she was dead and began to cry, she walked over to where i was
kneeling and crying at and began licking my face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt the most serenity I'd ever felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at her and began talking to
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Tipsy I'll miss you baby
girl, but you are dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't want to
say this but baby you don't belong here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe someday I'll see you again i have to believe that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But its time for you to go on." i
said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked like she was so happy
when i said that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe that was my
imagination finding a way for me to deal with her death or maybe not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll never know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By: Wildwindsbg@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I am a regular visitor to your
web site because I have had several experiences of my own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am writing you tonight to tell you that
under Palmer Massachusetts, you have a site for Palmer High.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must tell you that I am a police officer in
Palmer and have told this story to many of my fellow co-workers and few
"believe" me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">While on routine patrol I
frequently patrol the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Palmer</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>High
  School</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
work the evening shift, so we<span style="">&nbsp; </span>often find
teenagers and kids hanging around there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On two occasions I have seen a man dressed in a beige jacket and blue
jeans with dark hair, walk down the front stairs and towards the lower parking
lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please note that I have extra
lighting on the cruiser and this image seems to be very clear!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The man continues walking into
the parking lot then simply vanishes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first encounter that I had with him, I of course tried to
justify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my instincts and past
experiences told me otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second encounter happened two weeks after the first and the figure was exactly
the same and did the same thing!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have not seen this mystery
figure in a few years now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I frequently
speak with my co-workers since they too have experienced someone in the corner
of their eye at that location. ( There is a cemetery below the high school
).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have also experienced numerous
activities on <st1:Street><st1:address>Flynt Street</st1:address></st1:Street>
in the old cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have taken
photographes and the results were simply unexplainable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Thank you for the opportunity to
share the experiences that I have had.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Do you have any information about an old "slave hole"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on <st1:Street><st1:address>Old Warren Road</st1:address></st1:Street>
in Palmer?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is said to be haunted but
I can find no information regarding this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Who better than you guys to get that information from!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I am the new owner of the Old
Applebrook Farms in <st1:place><st1:City>Fremont</st1:City>, <st1:State>Michigan</st1:State></st1:place>
and I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">have lived here for 6 years. I am
glad I found the house I live in on</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">this web site so that now I know
my house is haunted. I seen a ghost walk</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">in my kitchen . He was a tall,
skinny man wearing a red plaid shirt and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">blue jeans. He also had on a
baseball cap. My husband seen him sitting on</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the couch next to him when he
woke from a nap. He said he looked like the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">crypt keeper from the tails of
the crypt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter also seen him and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my friends have had weird things
happen to them when they spent the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">night. We moved here before
Thanksgiving and between Thanksgiving and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Christmas it sounded like someone
in my basement having big parties. I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was to afraid to go see what it
was. That happened for about 3 years and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">then it stopped or I just sleep
through it now. Our TV channels would</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">change by their self, the radio
would turn itself off, our car blinker</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">started blinking and we had four
teenage boys witness that . My husband</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">could not get it to quit working
and then it just stopped. My car has</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">weird stuff happen, and my
husband has a lot of bad luck,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>really bad
and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">a lot of it. He was hit head on
by a semi, but Thank God he did not get a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">scratch on him. Then he almost
died when a heart doctor screwed him up</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and sent him home. He then got a
bad infection and almost died but funny</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">we could not sue the doctor because
nothing really happened to him except</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">that he lost 6 weeks of pay. I
think this ghost put a curse on him</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">because he never had that kind of
luck until we moved here. Then right</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">after we moved here I got really
sick and the doctors never could figure</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">it out. Can ghosts make people
get sick. Then every three months</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">something bad happens no matter
what. March was the third month and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Andy's dad just died on March
first. But every time something happens it</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">ends up costing a lot of money.
Like that semi accident cost me $7500.00.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Before I moved, I lived in <st1:place><st1:City>Lenexa</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Kansas</st1:State></st1:place> in a 15 year old house. It was said
that their was a couple that lived in the house before us and the husband had
killed the wife. she supposedly was buried in the backyard. I had experienced
at night, the sound of footsteps in our kitchen but i knew no one was down
their since we had an alarm system. Also, when we were playing hide and go
seek, we would always see someone behind the shed but ust thought it was
someone hiding, but then when we went to go find them nobody was there. and
then the i found the shed door to be open even though it had a lock on the
door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When i was 8 we moved on a block
called <st1:Street><st1:address>Irving Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street> It was a
nice house and i met new firends who lived just a few homes away. Not to much
later after we moved in i started seeing and hearing things. At first it was
usually things that go bump in the night, but being 8 it was enough to send me
to my mom's room. About 4 mounths after we moved in my firend Katie ( who lived
on the same block) was telling me that she kept seeing a little girl named
Linda. At first i did'nt believe her but than what was frighting her was very
similar to what was going on at my house. I did'nt want to tell her that
similar things were going on at my house because i did'nt know how to say it
with out sounding like im just saying what she said. I did'nt know the spirits
name that was woundering in my house. When i told her to was in a way re-leaved
that she was'nt the only one who was seeing and hearing things. After about 6
mounths in that house i was sleeping in my sister's bedroom EVERY NIGHT. One
night i awoke to find a man standing by my side. He said ''excuse me" but
before he would finish i hid under my covers. I peeked out a few seconds later,
he was still there. I shot under my cover's once agian and this time when i
took a look, he was gone. When ever i had sleep over's we would always end up
in the liveing room and on one acashion Katie and i slept on my sisters floor.
We were playing in my toy room ( which was in my basement) and we heard a
voice. We could not make out what it said but we were'nt going to stay to find
out. Six of us lived there. Though my step sisters came on a rarely bases, we
all had our little stories to tell about that house. That house was the only
house that i saw and felt my father in. When i was three he died. I was crying
for him one night and i felt him touch my shoulder. Other times a got to see
him. But still the activity in the house scard us all.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">It was later after we moved out
my mom and step dad told me that they had put holy water around the house
because they would have knocking on her door at night and no one would be
there. My mother even told me that one day when she was home for launch, she
heard banging from in my room. She went up stairs to see what was going on and
it stopped once she hit the top of the stairs. When she got back down she said
it started up agian. She took my dog ginger and left for my grandma's. I have
always been intregued by ghost and strange things that go bump in the night.i
have so many stories i can write a book. And i am only 14</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We live in a big house built in
the 1920's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one time, it had been
turned into apartments, but is now back to a single residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have a basement garage and we enter
through the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coming home from
work one day, I heard footsteps on the first floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our grandchildren know where we hide the
house key, so I just thought the kids had come in to help themselves to a
snack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I came upstairs, no one was
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went up to the 2nd floor and
again, no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the
outside door locks, and the doors were still locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know without a doubt, I heard
footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandkids won't sleep
upstairs by themselves because they say it's haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never told them the story about me
hearing footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I ask them why
they think the upstairs is haunted, they don't know why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They say they just get a weird feeling when
they are up there alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have often
heard sounds coming from upstairs, more like a dog or something jumping off a
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We've been here 30 years and have
never had anything threatening, so I guess my ghost is just hanging around
making sure we are taking good care of "his place."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">This all happened about two years
ago.It was around 8:oopm and i was sitting in my desk doing homework and
daydreaming.Something got in my eye so i was rubbing it alot until it got
red.When i looked over to my door i swear i saw a little girl about the age of
10,in a big white dress(sort of like a flower girl dress)just standing at my
door way and looking at me!I kept on looking at her for about 10 seconds not
beleaveing my own<span style="">&nbsp; </span>eyes!All of a sudden
she started to vanish and dissaper.I ran though my door not beleaveing what i
just saw,i went into my brothers room and stayed there till about 9:00.When it
was time to go back into my room so i could get my bookbag and stuff for school
tomarrow,i asked my brother if he could come with me.When i got to the doorway
where the little girl was standing,their was smoke everywhere and it was hard
for me to breath,i grabbed my bookbag and i ran out as fast as i possibly
could.I slept in the living room that night too afard to go back to my
room.That room still haunts me even though i havent seen the little girl
since.About a year after all that passed i went to look up the history on my
house and found out that i was a school for boys and girl back then in the 50's
and 60's,im still not sure if that girl died in my house or if it was my
guardian angel.I am still currently living in the house and sometimes am awakein
by my cat,she is always looking at a certain corner and hissing,last time when
i took a picture of that corner to see if anything would come up,their was a
big orb right their,it was bigger then my cat!!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Friends and I lived in a
townhouse in <st1:City><st1:place>Woodbridge</st1:place></st1:City> across from
Woobridge Center Mall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a dinner
get together, all of us came home to go to bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The windows had been open for several hours and the house was cold, so I
shut them and went up to bed at about 11pm, ALONE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my slumber, I kept feeling someone poking
me in my left arm, which annoyed me, but did not wake me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again I felt someone poke me in my left arm
harder, but remained asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly I
heard the highest pitch woman's voice screech in desperation and I startled
awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instantly, I smelled the distinct
smell of natural gas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke my room
mates and dragged them outside, still groggy, all 3 of us with headaches and
called the gas company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned
out, the breeze from the open windows had blown out all 3 of our pilot lights,

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I just thought I would share a personal
paranormal experience with you. One night while ghost hunting the <st1:City><st1:place>Gettysburg</st1:place></st1:City>
battlefield with my hunting partner and father in law we met up with a group
from Berks <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>county</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName>pennsylvania</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.
We swapped stories for a bit then we decided to take them to a spot in the
triangular field that most people were not familiar with. At the backside of
the field where it meets the woods a sniper pit was being set up when opposing
troops overan it and there were several deaths. Every time my group goes there without
fail we pick up something. So as we showed this other group around I had
wandered off by myself to shoot some pics on the digital camera. I was picking
up several orb and ecto shots so I called my father in law to come with his
video camera. I was standing about five feet in front of him at the edge of the
treeline explaining the direction I was photographing when out of nowhere it
seemed as if someone or something just walked past me and shoved me to the
ground. Now I am not a small man standing 6' 2" and weighing in at an even
200lbs. but this "thing" grabbed my left shoulder and shoved me to
the ground with such force that my body was horizontal before I hit the ground.
I could not believe what had happened and my father in law witnessed it with
his own eyes. Little did I know that just minutes before this the other group
we were showing around got a pic of a full shadow apparition about 30 feet from
where we were. You can view this pic on the berks county paranormal website as
well as in the pic section of the yahoo group <st1:City><st1:place>gettysburg</st1:place></st1:City>
ghosts. Needless to say I was a bit tentative to return but have several times,
still never failing to bring out whatever is lingering in that spot. It has
never gotten physical with me again but It always seems to follow me. The last
time out we had video footage of orbs and ecto swirling and circling me as I
sat indian style on the path through the woods. You can contact me at
dhaynie27@hotmail.com for more info or if you would like to hear more of our
stories and possibly a get together for the viewing of pics and video. Thanks
for taking the time to hear my story and I hope your readers enjoy it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Dear Webmaster,I just read your
site about Oklahoma haunted places and I must tell you about an old house we
once lived in.I would like to say that personally,I don't believe in
Ghosts,with the exception of the Holy Ghost of the Bible.But,In 1980-81 my
family moved into a house located on the out skirts of Sallisaw,In the Jimmy
Rogers addition.My Older sister claims that she was tormented by a hooded
figure wearing all white on almost a nightly basis.She also heard voices and
saw shadows in this place..Some people might say,Oh she just had emotional
problems or she prevaricated the whole thing,but other people who lived in the
house since then told similar stories.While I lived there personally,I never
saw anything,but she insists to this day that she is telling the truth and
defends herself adamantly.The Directions to this house,Which is a private
residence is Turn North off of Redwood to go to Jimmy Rogers addition,Take
first right,Then take first left,It's the first house on the right.It was
yellow in color,the last time I saw it a few years ago.It may be worth adding.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My name is Nichole and all my
life ive delt with abnormale experences. my family has as well, but me mostly,
that i know of. and nothing bad, frightening- no- surprising- but not scary. at
least not to me. maybe more beautiful. thats the way i see it...beautiful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>let me just say, that it is not a house that
haunts me, maybe its just me, that haunts me. and ive lost every body in my
family to death, except for my childred (god bless), but it started when my
grandfather died. i was 13 when i lost him. i wasnt close to my grandfather,
but nobody was, except my mother, he was a hermet who spent all his time in his
room. watching tv. my mother was very close to him and when she was little he
use to walk by her bedroom every morning to say goodbye when he went to work.
one morning he said goodbye to her and she went back to sleep. when she woke up
she found out that he had a stroke in the middle of the night and was in the
hospital, still alive though. she told my grandmother that he had said goodbye
to her that morning, and nana said it was impossable since papa had his stroke
hours before he was soppossed to be at work. now years later with me, when papa
was sick, like i said we were never close, the night after we had his "funeral"
i remember being thirsty and going downstairs to get a glass of milk. as i was
down there, sitting on the couch drinking the milk, papa appeared to me. from
my left side he started to walk. he walked passed my three times before i
said..."papa?" when i said that he stopped and turned to me. when he
saw me he held out his arms and started walking twards me. he said, i recall
exactally, " i love you. i never told you i loved you but i do. tell your
mother i love her too." and he dissapeared. never had anything happen with
him since. and i was never frightened. always felt loved. still do. i have many
more recent things happen though. if your interested you can email me, and we
can talk about them...thank you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I just wanted to comment on your
entry for <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Cottey</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a student there from 1984 - 86.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghostly "man in black or black
man" is new since my day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never
had tales of that sort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Vera was a real person,
though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I worked in the library and
handled the yearbook with her picture in it myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She died the autumn of 1918 or 1919.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was actually burned in her room on the
second floor of Main Hall (at the time <st1:place>Main</st1:place> and Rosemary
Halls were connected) and died at the sanitorium which then stood on the
present site of the library.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
connection with Rosemary Hall (since torn down, sadly) was that she was a music
major and Rosemary held the music rooms.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I never encountered her myself,
but some of my friends did, including a couple who were solid, levelheaded
young women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosemary Hall was the
auditorium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Girls involved with plays on
campus often heard footsteps from the deserted second and third floors, voices
in the basement, felt they were being followed on the stairs, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The drama teacher (whose name escapes me)
claimed that he often saw Vera sitting in the back row of the auditorium.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">One of my friends was practicing
her musical instrument in a practice room on the second floor of Main
Hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only piano in the practice
rooms was in a cubicle that opened off the room she was in and had no other
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While she was practicing she could
hear someone playing piano, but thought nothing of it until she was ready to
leave and leaned her head in to see which pianist it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she opened the door the music stopped and
the room was empty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">To begin I would like to say that
I have been experiencing things similar to this one ever since I was age 5. I'm
now 16 and would like to share the story of one particular experience that has
defiantly affected me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">About eight to nine years ago, my
brother who lives in Westbury <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>
purchased a three bedroom one bathroom home with his wife. Ever since then they
have been adding stories on to the house. In my most recent visit, the house
was now 3 stories and had five bathrooms, two bathrooms, and a newly finished
attic. My parents and I were to spend the week sleeping in the master bedroom
while my brother and his wife slept in the baby's room. During my stay I
experienced a chain of unusual happenings. First, while I was taking a shower as
I stepped out of the tub, I heard what sounded like a child giggling at first I
thought it was my niece but it didn't sound like her, I passed it off as either
the TV or radio. After that we were all downstairs talking about the people who
used to live in the house. Apparently it was a family of three. The parents
were older and had a bit of a hard time caring for their child, a female,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>who died around age 7. Out of curiosity I
asked my brother if he knew how the child died. He told me that he wasn't quite
sure, but the couple had told him that the she died tragically after spending
the day on a relative's boat. Apparently the little girl had spent too much
time in the cold water and after being pulled back onto the boat suffered from
hypothermia. At first I didn't think much of the story, it was sad, but what
were the odds that the giggling was the dead girl? Nothing else happened until
the third day when in the middle of the night I woke up for no apparent reason,
while laying in bed, I felt this intense pressure on my chest, as if someone
was sitting on it after about 10 seconds or so the sensation wen away and I
fell asleep again. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The mornings of the 4th, 5th, and
6th days when I was the only one awake and in the kitchen I would look in the
backyard to see what looked like a shadow that seemed to be
"skipping" and "hopping" from place to place. his scared me
a little because I didn't know what to make of it. On the last night at the
house, I had one of the most horrifying paranormal experiences of my life. It
was around <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30</st1:time> in the morning and I
woke with a start. Then I began to have a coughing fit. Since my parents and I
were sharing a room they woke up after hearing me and came to see if I was all
right. As my dad puts his had on my back, I began to cough up water. At first I
thought it was spit or phlegm from my throat, then I started to cough up what
seemed like cups of the water. What caused me to become frightened was the
water had a salty taste, like lake or ocean water. I was coughing up the water
for roughly 2 minutes and then it became extremely hard for me to breathe I
couldn't inhale. Whenever I tried I would swallow the salt water that seemed to
come from nowhere! While I was unable to breathe, after what felt like a
lifetime, I heard a little girl say "they didn't know" and suddenly
everything stopped. I was able to breathe, I wasn't coughing up salt water, and
everything was fine. After calming down and managing to sit up in the bed I
noticed a small child's figure in the doorway. It seemed to look at me and then
walk away. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">After this experience I was never
able to forget that little girl, or the message she was trying to send to me. I
still haven't completely gotten over the experience, and still continue to have
various others.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i live in shelbyville and have
been to cry baby bridge numerous of times..i have to say that I have never
witnessed the actual baby cries and the foot prints have never appeared for us,
but my friends and i do believe we have seen the "car" that was
wrecked on the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my
friends and I thought we would sit on crybaby bridge, pur the powder on the car
and wait to see if anything would happen or be heard. After a while of
nothing..one of the girls and i started walking on the bridge looking over the
edge and being stupid we stared calling for the baby...well on both sides of
crybaby bridge are curves and w/the high brush and trees you can't see around
the curves...the girl and myself heard a car comming and seen headlights
comkming from the left side of the bridge ..where our car was parked...we
stared to run to the opposite side of the bridge to get away from the car (the
bridge is only big enough for 1 car, unless u drive in the ditch) the car was
to fast and we seen it comming right at us..and the it was gone. we just stood
there long enough to realize we were still alive then jumped in the car w/ our
other freaked out friends and hauled ass away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few years ago me and 2 different friends went back to the bridge to
once again see what would happen..this time we just sat in my car (brand new)
on the bridge and chilled for a few.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
smartass friend in the back started making baby cry sounds...all of a sudden
something slamed into my car , the whole car shook, when i tried to put the car
in drive and go .. the car wouldn't move... we then heard a splash in the creek
below and as soon as we heard it my car could drive again... that was the
scarist thing ...ever since that we don't go anywhere near that bridge at
night.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Haunted House</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By: Cozmo831@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">along time ago a teenager had
hung himself in the back yard of his house. I was a little girl when i first
moved there with my parents. As i grew up in that house i had heard and seen
many weird things. My parents never believed me when i told them the house was
haunted. only me and my oldest brother had witness the sightings. the first one
was with my oldest brother he had heard a radio playing in the attic many times
finally my father had went up there to prove nothing was going on, but he had
found a radio in a little hole with the teens name on it. there were no
batteries or a plug. I had seen the teen many times and had spoke to him
obviously i had no response from him but my bed would also shake every night
and i would feel cold breezes through my room. My dogs and cat were very afraid
to go in the attic. My parents finally believed me as they started hearing
things abnormally. Doors would open and shut and you can see a faint picture of
him in the attic window. I know this is not recorded any where but it is very
true. after we moved a man that had lived up the street from us had baught the
house for his daughter and fixed it up. One morning he had walked in the house
to find that the teens name was burned into the wood bordering the door. No one
was able to get in the house since all the doors were locked so it must be the
ghost. We had told many people the house was haunted and no one would believe
us. The mans daughter and her husband moved out of the house leaving it to him,
she could not handle the hauntings. even though it has been 5 years since i
lived there i know its still haunted and as i drive by it or walk by it i still
see that teens face in the attic window. This ghost was friendly but he tried
his best to scare everyone, he had never tried to hurt or damage anything in
the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">most people see dead people. i
see dead animals. not</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">even kidding. my parents divorced
when i was real</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">young-like 2 or so. i never had
any real paranormal</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">experiences then, even though at
the time I lived on a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">farm. no, the trouble came when I
moved away from the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">farm. when i was about 7 my dad
got engaged to be</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">remarried. we moved in with his
fiancee and her two</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">kids. i ended up having to share
a room with her</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">daughter, who was about two years
younger than me. i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">have always been a bad insomniac,
falling asleep</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">around one or two in the morning.
well one night, at</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">about two fifty something or
other, i saw something</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">come out of the wall at the end
of my sisters bed. it</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">kinda came out as if it were
coming through a hole in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the wall, though there wasn't
actually one there. it</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was a girl of about sixteen or
seventeen. i still</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">remember her vividly. she was
pretty tall...but then,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">everyone looks tall to a seven
year old...and she had</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">blonde hair that reached halfway
down her back. she</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">wore a pink shirt with a kinda
roxy-ish symbol in a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">strip across it and jeans. she
walked right over to my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">bed, and i remember that she
looked really solid.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">there wasn't supposed to be
anyone else in the room at</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the time-my younger sister was
only five and a sound</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">sleeper (she swears she never saw
anyone). anyways, i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">knew i wasn't dreaming, and when
she leaned over at</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the side of my bed like she was
going to whisper</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">something in my ear, i freaked
and drew the covers</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">over my head. it was about a year
before i would sleep</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">without three blankets firmly
held over my head.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">anyhow, i never saw that girl
again, but the day after</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">she did that, i started seeing
animals where they</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">REALLY shouldn't be. IE: school,
the supermarket, the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">theater, my room, etc. i once saw
a squirrel in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">krogers. i did a double take and
tried to show my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">friend, though she couldn't see
it. I see all kinds of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">animals these days, mostly i see
them out of the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">corner of my eye as they dash
across and disappear. i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">hear meowing and ringing bells,
only to find there's</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">nothing there. i have weird
dreams, like an OBE, where</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">it's really vivid, and always
there are animals</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">involved. mostly cats, as the
most ghosts i see are</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">cats, haunt my dreams. one ghost,
a black cat with</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">white paws and a white splotch on
its right eye, seems</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">to follow me in the day and
night. usually i see it</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">right before something BIG
happens...it distracted me</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">right before my first
kiss....only one other person i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">know of sees these things. she's
my best friends, and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i guess you could say my soul
sister. anything that</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">happens to one happens to the
other, though more like</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">it would happen in a mirror. if
her dad does</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">something, my mother will do the
same thing. we have</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">parallel dreams and so on...but
im sixteen now and the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">sightings of any animal except
this cat are starting</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">to grow fewer. you hear about
children growing out of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">their hauntings when they grow

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was midway through me 7th grade
year, and I remember it was all going easy all A's and B's and maybe one C, I
was stress free and one morning I woke up with brutal scratches on my
shoulders, I wore a short sleeved shirt every night and had no fingernails
because of my bad habbits, I hid them from my parents because they knew more
than half my friends were either Gothic, Alternative, or Athiest and they think
they all cut themselves, well I wasn't Gothic, Alternative, or Athiest I was
pretty much just a good Catholic never cut my arms wrists nothing I wasn't a
psyco. Anyway I woke up with these brutal cuts on my shoulders and didn't tell
my folks, but my good grades got me in P.E. so I had to change my shirt as we
had a dress code you had to wear a collard shirt, and a classmate of mine,
Robert, noticed them. "Damn Darrin! What they hel did you do to your
sholders?!" </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Anyway days past and they were
still there, like knife cuts...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Roughly a week later they went
away, they didn't fade or anything, they just vanished then 2-5 days later they
returned the next day gone, no trace nothing, I finally told my parents and
thankfully they didn't even mention anything about me doing it, they said maybe
it was my book bag, it was middle school I didn't carry one anymore, eilier in
the year I did, but because of secerity issues they banned them. My book bag
was in my locker thats where it stayed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The scars have been gone for some
time now last time I had them it was about 4-6 months ago and it was only for a
day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I stumble upon your site while
doing research for a completely unrelated topic, but couldn't help poking
around. Since ghost and the paranormal have always been a topic of fascination
for me. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I personally have had very few
encounters with the unexplained, a fact I am grateful for. At least not that I
recognized as being unusaul or other worldly. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Accept<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one day in my high school library. My school
is over a hundred years old. The builiding itself dates back to the the 1900's.
Rumors about ghosts come with the territory. When your a teenager things like
this are "kinda cool". </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We have a two floor library located
in the middle of the building. Two stair wells connect the lower library with
the upper. The library is so large that the classrooms that encircle it have
back doors that open directly into the library. The upper section of the
library has a computer lab situated in the corner of it. There is one door
there that leads to the hall and 2 "back" doors to classrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The computers are set up in a long row
parallel to this row of doors. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was sitting at this row of
computers on the end nearest the hallway entrance. With my back to it and the
other two doors. I was typing away frantically having procastinated on a paper
that was to be handed in that day. The doors are wood with metal hinging and
very noisy. I don't think anyone has oiled them in years. They're not hard to
move nor are they easy. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I heard someone open the hallway
door and walk in and turn towards the row of doors directly behind me. When I
turned around to see who was walking behind me and why they had stopped
(without going into a classroom) no one was there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I know what I heard, it was the
distinct sound of someone having entered the library through the hall door and
start walking behind me. Both "back doors" were closed and no one
else was even in the upper library area but me. If a person had gone into a
classroom I would have heard that door as well or seen it shutting. Not to
mention I turned around to quick for any real person to disappear so quickly. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">At the exact time this was all
happening an overwhelming feeling of being chilled encompassed me. My arms
broke out in goose bumps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then as quick
as it had come the chill left. And I scramble to gather up my papers, retrieve
my disk and beat a hasty retreat to the lower section of the library. Where I
finished my paper in the company of people I could see. I don't know why the
encounter made me so unnerved me so, but it did. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It Really Happened</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By: momluc@cox.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have only told a few people
this story. It is all true&#8230;.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I was a little girl about
11years old, my family moved in to an old rental house in southern <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>.
It was a big house for what we were used to. I remember the front doors being
these huge</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Black double doors. They opened
to a large entry room. To the left of the entry was the living room family room
and kitchen; to the right was the Hall way to all the bedrooms. The first room
on the left was mine and my older sister&#8217;s. I remember always feeling a chill
when we walked down that hall like you had to run and get out fast. I remember
the closet for some reason. It was a walk in and it was raised up a foot off
the floor, it was just odd.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Many strange things happened in
that house, but the thing that has haunted me is what I saw one night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I was sleeping, when I felt a
hand lightly touch my shoulder as if to wake me. I rolled over to see all I can
describe as a doll like face with a green like glow to it. It was had an evil
grimace on its face as if it new how afraid I was of it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I am about to cry or have a heart
attack retelling this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">After being paralyzed with fear
for a minute that seemed like an hour I was able to make way to the light
switch. As I turned on the light the expression turned to anger and it
disappeared in flash of green light. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I woke my sister who said I
looked white as sheet.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">This seriously scarred me. I
still am afraid it will reappear to me one night. But I do feel it was attached
to that house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My sister (who would see
something too later in that same room) was practicing witch craft in that
house. I sometimes wonder if that was the cause or it was there before. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Still afraid to roll over and
open my eyes in the night</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I am what they call an Old boy, I
used to live in Marine Hall as a Cadet, the place was extremely spooky, we
wouldn&#8217;t go out into the hall late at night even if we had to goto the
bathroom, we would pee into pledge bottles or whatever we had and wait tell
morning, it was sometimes funny because outside you would see the full
containers sitting on the window cells in the morning. But besides that&#8230; you
can say they were kids and were to lazy or maybe other kids would jump them at
night&#8230; it was a military academy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Fact, the heating system in that
building was radiator, and it would pop ting and make all sorts of groaning
sounds, so now as an adult, we know what that was. Also as kids we would attach
strings to doors and slam them open or shut, to scare other kids.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Fact. Cadet Pool did hang himself
I was there, Eddy Kirk was his &#8220;Big Brother/Mentor&#8221; He saw first what had
happened, I was out side with about 700 other cadets, when we were all waiting
to go eat and he didn&#8217;t show and all hell broke loose, Recently Marine Hall was
torn down because it was getting out of hand haunted&#8230; It was crazy doors were
opening and closing groans.. it was spooky, the problem was when we were kids
fucking around playing jokes&#8230; we thought someone was playing a joke on us&#8230; and
we couldn&#8217;t figure out how they were doing it&#8230; fact was there was no figuring
out how they did it, it was haunted then to, you can ask any old boy
&#8220;Foxtroter&#8221; on the inside and they will admit, Wentworth has some spooky stuff
going on around there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I live in <st1:State><st1:place>Missouri</st1:place></st1:State>,
there are all sorts of haunted houses here. My house was built in the early
1800 and we have our own stories, but we don&#8217;t want them published because we
are trying to sell this old haunted house. But if your ever this way, I will
show you move by its self, war medals and marbles, foot steps and doors
slamming</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I was 13</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By: kellysgurl1989@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I was only 13 we lived in a
haunted house. It was something I never want to again. My Grandfather lived
with us after his stroke and we took care of him. He was a loving man. He
passed away in our house. Later, when I got really sick, I would be lying in my
bed at night and just watch an orb flow in my room and then come to my bed and
leave the room. I would feel a rug at my hair, like he did when he was alive
and I knew it was him. My mother saw him going and coming from my room and then
go back to his. Even though I knew it was him, it still gave me chills.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Thats when he finally left and
the real weird stuff started happening. At <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>,
the water all through the house would come on full blast every night! Then
since it's been a while back, we didn't have a remote tv, you had to get up,
turn it on or change channels and then set down again. Well, in the middle of
the night, the television would come on by itself. No it didn't have a timer
either. A very high, high,pitched sound would emit anywhere you were in the
house and you knew something was going to happen. Sometimes<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it would sound like dishes breaking or pots
and pans being thrown around in the kitchen. Knocks on the doors from the
outside and no one there. It got to be so bad that I started sleeping with my
parents at 13. We would watch our curtains fly up over our bed, the window is
not open! My dad sat on someone on our couch, he jumped up and no one there,
but an impression, not his. My Aunt stayed one night and she felt a cat she
said jump on the bed and walk around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She didn't know, we had no cat. My dad had slept alone one night, and
finally got to my mother and I. He said something was trying to choke him, he
actuall had what looked to be rope burns around his neck! Things calmed down a
bit after we lived with my Grandparents for a while. But one night my friend
was staying over and my parents were at my Grandparents for a bit. We were
playing with Barbie dolls and decided we wanted to listen to a record 45 ya
know. Well, it was going well and then it sped up, so I went to see what was up
and stopped power on it. It still played! I unplugged it, still it played, then
the high pitched sound again. You should have seen us running out of that house
for a few blocks to my G-parents. We had to finally move. The house was very
old and we learned 2 people had died there also, and one of them in my room.
Never want to go through that again</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We rented a small home in
northern <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State> and believe
that perhaps a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">former resident may never have
left.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Early one morning I was just
waking, kind of twilite sleep I guess you'd</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">call it when I distinctly heard
the front door in the living room close. I'm</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">sure most people can identify
that sound as we hear it all the time. My wife</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was next to me so I knew it
wasn't her. Both of my children were small so I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was concerned that one of them
had gotten up an wondered out. I left the bed</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and went to the front door fully
expecting to open it and find one of my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">children outside. The door was
closed and bolted. Both children sound asleep</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">in their beds. I didn't think
about ghost at that time and thought maybe I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">just dreamed it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Shortly there after I was
starting dinner one evening, put a pot on the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">range top to start boiling water.
I turned around to the sink and when</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">turning back to the range I
noticed that the burner knob was turned off.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Thinking that I just didn't turn
it on I twisted it to the on position and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">continued about my chore. When
returning to the range top again I found that</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the knob was again in the off
position. Again not giving it much thought</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">other than "Uh, must have a
ghost."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My daughter at the time was about
12 and one evening was waiting for one of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">her friends to come over for a
nights stay. It was dusk, not much light</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">shining through the windows. My
daughter was laying on the couch, half</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">asleep and heard the front door
open then close and latch. Thinking it was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">her friend she said " just
throw your stuff on the chair" this she said as</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">she was openiong her eyes and
starting to rise only to find that no one else</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was in the room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">On one other evening,I believe we
were visited again witnessed by my dog. I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was seated on the couch and the
dog was standing in the dining room. I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">stared at her because she was
looking to her left into an area that has the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">wet bar and out of my direct line
of sight. Looking up she began to wag her</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">tail and for an instant I thought
my wife may have been standing there out</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">of my line of sight. I called the
dogs name, she looked at me then turned</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">back to whatever drew her
attention, looked back to me and walked over to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">me. I rose to inspect the area
only to find that nothing was there. So what</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">did she see? Why did she wag her
tail?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I don't think that anyone of
these would rate on it's own but looking back</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and tieing them togeather just
maybe, Maybe.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">This happened in 2003 when me ,my
husband and two kids had moved into a house.. it was a qaud level house,,
meaning we had four levels. the three bedrooms and bathrooms on the fourth
level and the living room and kitchen on the third and two underneath leading
to garage and basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We Had already
had eerie experiences duing Christmas and daytime naps with voices and doors
opening and closing, and orbs at night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this one was the most creepy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">It was about 3 in the afternoon
and my husband was on the phone with his brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were just about to go to the park or
something and i was just walking in the front door after packing the car. The
kids were in the front room waiting for us which is where the 7 steps to the
floor that goes to the bedrooms go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
Husband was sitting on the third or fourth step when i walked in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as i was asking him who he was on the
phone with,, the kids bedroom door (which was closed) started to shake, as if
someone was on the the other side trying to get out. I took a step back and
said ,"HONEY, Look.. What is that?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>he ignored me and kept talking til the door started shaking again so he
could hear it,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stood up immediately
and turned around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took a step back
and said, "Did yu see that?"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I didn't see anything,, he swears he saw something cross the hallway
into our room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the while the door
continued shaking. He looked at me and we just stood there for about a min
while the door continued to shake,, the kids were freaked out and we debated
who would go and check.. my Hubsband chickened out and followed me as i walked
up to the door and opened it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">As i opened the door all i saw
were the curtains moving as if the windows were open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Problem was,, the windows were closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is just one of the stories that happened
in that house and the apartment i lived in before that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since we bought a house i have felt so comfortable
i have no worries here.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But The things
i experienced before still make the hair stand up...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I am from a small city in England
called Wolverhampton.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">been fascinated by ghosts but was
of the 'seeing is believing'</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am now 22 years old but when I was about
18, I vividly</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">remember going out with my older
sister one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were staying at</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my brothers flat for the night as
he lived closer to the city centre,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">which is where the bars and clubs
are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The flat is a converted</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Victorian house, he had one of
the top apartments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we arrived in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the car, my sister drove round
the back of the property and parked on</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the gravel spaces at the top of
the sloped garden, that led to the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">back door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got out of the car first and waited at the
top of the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">garden path, while my sister was
leaning inside her car, getting her</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">overnight bags out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I became aware of a man also being in the
car-</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">parking area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was night-time darkness and I was standing
under the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">only lamp-post, but this gave off
sufficient light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">approximately two cars distance
away from me and appeared to be</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">walking 'jerkily' and quite
slowly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember staring at the man
and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">feeling confused as I could not
make out any of his features; he was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">literally a 3D, solid, black
figure of a man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then stopped and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">stood about five metres in front
of me and seemed to look at me for 5</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I nearly asked him if he was alright, but I
seemed unable to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">speak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think to myself now that I was just stunned
and confused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">only realised he was a ghost when
he turned and walked into the garden</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">bushes, completely without a
sound, not down the path but along the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">grass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He literally disintegrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kind of got the impression</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">that, before he turned, he
chuckled to himself and shook his head, as</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">though my stunned face was
funny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this time my sister was out of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the car and had joined me at the
top of the garden, ready to walk down</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the garden path.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think i've moved so quick to get into
a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">house before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not tell my sister what I had seen
until we were</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">both in my brothers flat, as I
knew she would be terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">thought of all possibilities as
to whether my eyes were playing tricks</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">on me, but I had not had any
alcohol whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't looking for</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">anything suspicious, merely minding
my own business, and there's no</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">way it could have been a trick of
the light or shadows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody will</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">convince me that what I saw
wasn't paranormal and something that can</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">be scientifically explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am definitely now a believer, although</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have never seen anything again,
only had sensations in various</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">places that there was another
presence around.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">More recently, whilst in my step
parents house the other day</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">showering, I heard a mans voice
shout something outside the bathroom</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had the only keys to the house, and had
locked the front door</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">as nobody else was in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it had've been night-time I probably would</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">have jumped out the bathroom
window, but as it was daylight, I wasn't</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">so perturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house is actually a bungalow and I don't
feel</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">comfortable sleeping in my old

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">sharing the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although I don't think there is anything
sinister</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My husband was in the service and
worked nights, sometimes he would come home in the middle of the night but I
was never frightened like the night I'm about to tell you. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">After putting the kids to bed and
going to bed myself I was sleeping sound when about 1:13 AM I had a rude
awaking. I was lying on my back, which is odd since I always sleep on my
stomach, a very cold feeling came over me and someone touched my foot, I sat
straight up in the bed as a man said my name. To scared to move I sat there for
what seemed to be a long time. When suddenly a very hard push, pushed me back
down in the bed and again it felt like ice was thrown through me. It took my
breathe away. I looked<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at the clock
again But it still read 1:13 AM. I was terrified all I could think of was my
kids and husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some how I fell back
to sleep but the next day a neighbor asked me if I had heard about the
motorcycle accident that happen the night before. I said no and she told me
that a man with same name as my husband was killed while riding his motorcycle.
I asked her what time was this. She said 1:13 AM. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My husband crashed his motorcycle
the very next day, but no injuries. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I still get chills when I think
about this.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Me and my cousin were browsing
the net one night and kind of stumbled onto </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">your site. We both live in
Virginia and we decided to go out for a little </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">while tonight and knew we were
going to be near a place you mention on your </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">site....Crawford Road in
Yorktown, to be specific.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Though we didn't see anything, on
the stretch of road, there WAS something </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">weird going on with her car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we turned off the main road onto </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Crawford road, she happened to
glance into her rearview and saw that her </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">dome brake light (in the back
window) had burned out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She figured that
it </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">had just "gone out" and
needed to replace it, but when we passed under the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">bridge and got to the next main
road, her dome brake light came BACK ON when </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">she hit the brakes.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Well, we turned around in a
parking lot and headed back towards the bridge </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and, once again, the dome brake
light did not work while we were on Crawford </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Road...and as we passed back
under the bridge, her car kind of jerked to the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">side and tried to cut off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She accelerated, got the car straight again,
and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">as we got back on the main road
back towards Newpoert News...the dome brake </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">light AGAIN was working fine and
we had no more problems with it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Just thought it was kinda eerie
and thought I'd share it with you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like
I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">said we didn't see anything, but
it seemed like something didn't like her </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">car too much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did get out when we first were pulling up
to the bridge </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and snapped a few pics...and if

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">These Are mostly my wife's
experiences. At the corner of 11th St. East &amp; 6th Avenue, these occurances
happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My wife's first of many
experiences is: This actually occurred to her mother in 2002. While her mother
was asleep, she was awoken by someone or something poking her to get up. She
woke and turned on the light, and thought it was me or my wife. But noone was
there and occurred for a couple of nights. She kept her light on after that, so
it does not bother again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Another experience happened while
my wife was at the computer. She was on the net and it took it's time to switch
to another page. Then all of a sudden, she heard a "SIGH" on her her
left side. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Other things that occurred is
that a ghostly couple would be heard arguing through the vents and this usually
occurred at around 3:00AM.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Then, my wife and cousin were
visiting, she noticed a apparition of a small, skinny female, with her hair up,
in a bun, like they had long ago. She smiled at my wife and backed up into the
porch and slowly vanished.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Then there was this occurrance
that me and my wife experinced. We were watching TV and then all of a sudden we
heard this loud noise that hit the front door. We thought it was a snowball,
seeing the snow was almost gone. I went to check to see if there was a
snowball, but I did not see a snowball.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Another occurrance happened when
we were watching "Scariest Places On Earth", which was on YTV at the
time. Anyway, it was dark and my wife saw a figure going into our bedroom. We
were sitting in the living room when she saw this. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We also hear mysterious knocking
on the back door, we would go and check. We asked "Who's there?, but there
was no reply and it happened again and this time we heard the doorknob
rattling, like someone wanted to come in. We ckecked again but noone was there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Our Little Boy Ghost</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">By:
pmr.warehousestlouis@cibasc.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have written to you my
personnel experiences, now I would like to talk about my wife and her
experiences as well. Before I tell you about our little boy ghost Aaron I have
to give you a little history. I have always been interested in the paranormal
and have had my wife constantly chide me in my interests. However she scheduled
several trips to locations that are known to be haunted. Alton Ill. And the
Lemp mansion in St. Louis Mo. Like I said she was extremely skeptical and found
it unbelievable. She has sinced changed her mind. In short we were at Lemp
mansion at a late night gathering in the 3rd floor attic. The lady that was in
charge of this outing gave us a history of the mansion then let us wonder
around and just experience what we could. My wife (Jan) and I with her son
Andrew went from room to room. We took several pics using our digital camera
with some interesting results. Back to Jan. She walked in front of a closet and
as she told us later felt like she just had to reach inside. As she did so she
felt what she called an electric charge shoot up her arm jolted her back all
with a audible "pop". She jerked back immediately and asked if I
heard that noise. I stated yes and so did the people around us. The paranormal
reseacher told us that she felt an entity around my wife. What is strange is
that in almost all the pics I have taken at several other "haunted"
location with her in them, there is always at least one orb around her
someplace. This ability to scense these things I feel is a gift - we she has
second thoughts if it is a gift or not. Either way - she has never had or
remembers any type of activity around her before that event. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">She has lived in our house for 16
years and has never had any experiences. Until one night she awoke and was
freezing cold. As she sat up she looked to the side of the bed and saw a little
boy dressed in 1920's type clothing. She said at first she was afraid but
immediately felt an inner peace and calm come over her. She asked the boy what
he wanted and he replied not in an audible way but she could hear him in her
mind that he was looking for his mommy. She then asked him his name that is
when she found out his name was Aaron. She said that he was as life like as
could be and first thought that it was one of her sons coming into the room but
soon figured out that he was to short and was dressed in modern clothing. She
said he vanished as fast as he appeared. After he left the room returned to
normal. He appeared to her again about a week later. He has never been mean
just like a frightened little boy looking for his mother. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We have several pets - 2 cats and
2 dogs. None of them react to anything except for Gracie a little Cairn
terrier. She will be asleep and out of nowhere start to growl and bark and act
like she is going to attack a intruder. ( Little dog outside Big dog
inside!!!). She was lying in bed with me one night all of a sudden she jumps up
and start to bark wildly. I look up and see a black shadow less than 4 feet
tall walk past the end of our bed. I could not see through it at all. It
stopped in front of the closet turned and walked through the glass door and
disappeared. Gracie immediately calmed down and went back to sleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">We had cable T.V. in our house
and on several occasions the T.V in the livingroom would be on when we came
home or it would come on when we were in the house somplace other than the
livingroom. I had always thought that there was something wrong with the cable
box ( it controlled the on/off part to the T.V.) and that is why we would find
the T.V.on. Well like so many we left cable and went to dish T.V. Now you can
turn on the T.V. with the on/off switch but it does not turn on the satlite
receiver. So all you get is "snow" on the screen. To get a picture
you must use the remote for the receiver this turns on the T.V and the satelite
receiver. There is a 3rd button that you have to hit to get reception. Well for
about a week the T.V. never turned itself on after we went to Dish T.V.. Then
all of a suden it started up again. The funny part is that the T.V. would be on
but like I said you had to hit a 3rd button for it to connect to the receiver.
After finding the set on for the umteenth time I took the remote and said
outloud " You need to hit this button here if you want to watch
T.V.". The very next day the T.V. was on and not on a station that we
generaly watch. My Wife has seen him many times anf felt him even more.Our dog
Gracie sees or feels him more than we do. All we have done is told him he could
stay and that was OK as long as he did not scare the boys. To this day they
have not seen nor felt him. I feel sorry for him and wish him well but at the
same time he is welcome in our home. I have no idea where he came from. Jan and
I have wracked our brain trying to figure out where he came from and why now
and not before. If you have any questions please feel free to write me at the
E-mail address listed. Your thoughts on where he may have came from is also appreciated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Okay here's another one of my
strange night terrors. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My parents came to visit one
summer, they had driven 30 hours and 8 states. So we were very glad to see them
safe. We spent 2 weeks together and had lots of fun but like everything else
fun comes to an end. As we told my parents goodbye I was more worried about
their trip home. I told them to call when they stopped at night so I knew they
were okay. The first night they called but the second night I didn't hear from
them. I went to bed after calling my sister who also had not heard from them.
She assured me everything was fine and they may have traveled through just to
get home. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I went to bed only to be woken a
few hours later with a toe tug and my parents saying my name. This was a way of
waking me as a child. I answered back with a "what" but didn't get an
answer then realized that my parents were not in my room. I called my sister
who had just gotten home from work she calmed me down and said she would call
our parents when the sun came up. Not wanting to wait I started calling every
few minutes for the next hour, no answer at their home. Finally I decided to go
back to bed I was just being silly. A few hours later my sister calls me and tells
me our parents just made it home from their trip. She asked if everything went
well on the trip home. My dad tells her that they were going to drive straight
through last night but got tired so decided to just get the first hotel that
came up. It was after midnight and they were more tired than they had thought.
After getting a room and settling into bed the people in the next room began to
fight and argue, they think they may have been drinking. My mom looked out the
window and saw<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the two men fighting. One
of them fell onto the hood of my parents car as the other man stabbed him to
death. My dad said he wasn't tired anymore and just wanted to get home. My mom
told us when she saw that happen she thought of her own family. I must have
felt her terror. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Back during the depression in
Humboldt, TN, Mr. Jones was president of People's Bank on Main Street.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was so upset about the depression that he
hung himself in the vault.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Years later,
the bank moved and in the mid 1970's the building became a gift shop<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the vault , with it's wooden floor was
used as a display room.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was working
there by myself and heard footsteps in the vault that made the floor
creak.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another time, I heard someone
coming down from the attic. on the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>new
metal stairs that had been recently installed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Also, Mr. Jones had good taste because sometimes I would come into work
and an item that was rather tacky would be off the shelf onto the floor or a
particular painting would be very crooked on the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Jones was a friendly ghost and I greeted
him every morning and told him goodnite.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">let me preface this by stating

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">remember anything about him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all i know of him is</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">from photos and conversations
with my family.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i was 7 years old or so and
asleep in bed, my room</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">being near the rear of the house,
close to my parents'</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i awoke to a sound and found myself wrapped</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">deeply in my sheets, freezing in
the middle of August</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">or thereabouts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it sounded like one of my parents on</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the other end of the house, possibly
in the kitchen,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">rummaging for a midnight
snack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i remember a faint</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">light as well, like the light
from an open</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">refrigerator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it didn't really begin to frighten me</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">until both the light and sound
began to get closer to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my door was open, peering into
inky blackness,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">gradually getting brighter from
the slowly approaching</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the sound now reminded me of chains; someone</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">or something tied down by heavy
chains, each step a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">painful struggle.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i actually called out, "Mom,
Dad" but not nearly loud</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">enough for them to hear me, even
though they were only</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">across the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>suddenly the source of light and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">sound made it's appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a hotel cart came into</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">view outside my door, being
pushed toward the end of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the outline of the cart was fuzzy due to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the extremely bright white light
engulfing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">white sheet was draped over it as
well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then i saw</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">what was pushing the cart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a man, also draped in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">white appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>tall and completely featureless due</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">to the white robe he wore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he reminded me of a monk</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">or the Grim Reaper himself
dressed in such a cowl. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">his hands were covered by this
robe so i couldn't tell</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">where the cart ended and the man
began.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was as if</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the two were meshed
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as for the sound, it</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">was very loud, chains rattling and
scraping the floor</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">as he walked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i could not see them, assuming they</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">were under his robe.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">as he came fully into view, the
sounds stopped along</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">with the man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>slowly, he turned his head towards me</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and i couldn't look away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>where his face should have</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">been, there was only blackness, a
void that seemed to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">go on forever inside the hood of
his robe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">such a contrast to the brilliant
white of the rest of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">his body and cart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i felt as if he was looking deep</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">into my soul for what seemed like
ages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it couldn't</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">have been more than five seconds
and he slowly faced</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">forward again, the chains
startling me out of my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">trance as he began pushing his
cart again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>slowly the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">figure disappeared past my
doorway, only light and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">chains in my ears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and then they were gone as well,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">leaving me very scared in the
silent cold dark.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">seven years had past and i was
around 14 and had</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">virtually forgotten my experience
with what i had seen</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>our family had expanded with the birth of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my sister and brother, and we had
moved to a new</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was closer to October but still very mild</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i had always loved the woods; climbing</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">trees, listening to birds,
watching squirrels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">naturally, i took to exploring
the woods in my new</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">neighborhood.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">it was on one of these explorations
that i had my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">second encounter with the
paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was walking</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">in the woods by myself, nowhere
near another house by</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">at least 100 yards in any
direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i suddenly felt</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">very cold as i heard a twig snap
behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>startled,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i whirled around and saw what i
thought to be a man,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">20 to 30 feet in front of
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i stepped back a few</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">steps, ready to run back to my
house when i realized</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">that i couldn't distinguish any
clothing on him and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">that he was completely black.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">at first i thought he was wearing
a black outfit, but</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">then i noticed no discernible
signs of where clothing</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and bare skin would meet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he had no features at all,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">almost like i was looking at a
shadow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as this sunk</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">into my mind, i stepped forward,
intending to get a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">closer look.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as i did so, the black figure</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">side-stepped between 2 small
trees and completely</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">vanished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i thought he had hid behind one of the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">trees but when i reached them,
the man was nowhere in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">sight.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">as i stood there, i finally
noticed how quiet the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">woods had become.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>no birds singing, no chattering of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">animals; the air itself seemed to
be still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">searched the whole area where the
man had been, but</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">never found any signs of
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i remember how small</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">the 2 trees were and how if he
had been a real man,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">there was no way he could have
hid behind either one. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">scared and tired from my search,
i went back home,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">wondering if i would ever visit
those woods again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">of course i did and still
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at the time of this 2nd</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">encounter, i really didn't think
anything remarkable</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it had scared me and caused me to wonder if</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i had really even seen anything
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it wouldn't</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">be until the next time that i
would put 2 and 2</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">together... or rather 7 and 7.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i was 21 when my 3rd encounter
occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i had not</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">thought about my past experiences
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i had</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">graduated from high school and
was attending college</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>sometime around September or so i had</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">come home for a weekend
visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this was the same</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">house that i had lived in when i
saw the man in the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one night during that weekend, i was working</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">on my computer in my
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i had my door closed</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and all the lights were out.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">suddenly i felt very cold and
thought i heard a noise</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">from my bathroom, not even 5 feet
to my left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">hairs bristled up and i got
goose-flesh all over my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">body as i slowly turned my head
toward the bathroom. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i didn't see anything, but i was
not relieved by this.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>i was still scared and i didn't even know
why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">turned around to make sure my
bedroom door was still</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>seeing that it was, i looked around my room</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">for any sign of what could have
made the thump i had</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">heard.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i almost started to calm down
when i heard my name</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">called out in something above a
whisper,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">"Braaanndonnn."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was so scared i became almost</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">paralyzed as i realized that this
voice had come from</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">my bathroom, where i had heard
that noise not even 10</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">seconds before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i couldn't move my head to look,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">rather using my peripheral vision
to no avail. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">finally i could move my head,
looking into my bathroom</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">and seeing no source of a voice
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i didn't move</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">from my chair for what seemed
like hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>eventually</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i got the courage to get up,
turning all the lights on</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">in my room and bathroom, finding
nothing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i checked on my brother and
sister to see if they were</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">awake, and had possibly called my
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>both were</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">sound asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then i went downstairs to my parents'</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">bedroom and they too were
sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i actually woke</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">them up and asked if either one
had called out my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they both denied it and i was left to wonder</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">what or who had been in my
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>needless to say, i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">stayed up the rest of the night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i had never noticed the 7 year
time span between</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">experiences until i told a buddy
of mine my stories. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">he was the one who pointed it out
and that really blew</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">me away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the more i thought about it, the more i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">wanted to know more about ghosts
and hauntings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">started to think it might be my
biological father,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">trying to communicate with me for
some unknown reason,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">but i honestly do not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it seems that each</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">experience has lost detail as
i've had them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i don't</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">know if that has to do with me
growing up or loosing a</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">connection with this ghost or
what.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for all i know it</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">could be 3 different ghosts, but
my gut says</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">otherwise.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">such encounters have influenced
my interests in life;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">from horror movies about death,
ghosts, and UFOs to</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">books about vampirism and the
occult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as i grew</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">older, it sparked a religious
flare that never really</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">went out, but smolders defiantly
despite my own</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">neglect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i consider myself a Christian and have</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">accepted Jesus as my lord and
savior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i even went so</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">far as to join a Methodist
church, get baptized, the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">whole shebang.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>however, i never felt moved by the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">holy spirit as it were and became
quite angry towards</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">organized religion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so now i rarely go to a church,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">but feel strongly about my
beliefs, which only leads</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">credence to what i have seen and
heard in the past.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i have even been foolish enough
to have gone ghost</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">hunting myself after a little
research, with some nice</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">photos and some obscure noises
and voices recorded. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">but alas everyday life does take
hold and i haven't</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">ventured into a cemetery or near
a haunted place in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>yet watching that movie, along with friends</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">reminding me now that i'm 28 and
my 7 years are up, i</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">felt compelled to write to your

forget all about it and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">i'll experience something that
will take me completely</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">When I was ten years old or so,
my grandparents purchased a gorgeous two story home with a haunting
history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It towered above the others on
its street, and was covered by green ivy for most of the year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole ambiance was straight out of a
classic horror story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day when they
were touring the house, they came across a back bedroom atop the second
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its remote location in the house
was strange enough, but the narrow hallway that lead to it was worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt many chills and daunting presences, it
seemed, of someone standing behind me or following me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I reached the bedroom however, the
feelings disappeared completely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
room, the walls were half wooden and half wallpaper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the wood, someone had stuck a memorial
card, the likes of which a family member would receive at a funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandparents kept it, and the house was
infested ever since.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">-Blaire S. -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house, which we nicknamed the Bailey
House because of the street it sat upon, is located still today in Joliet,

swing at all. The last time i was there at about 9:30 in the evening the swing
was going as though some one was on it yet the other three swings were moving
left to right with the wind. We walked to the grave site and after four or five
min. heard childred playing on the waters edge, we left pretty fast and on the
way out noticed the swing that looked as though someone was on it was now
swinging with the wind. I really belive the "child" followed us to

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">In the 70's my parents moved us
from the city to the country. My were from Baltimore Md and moved to Marion Md
on the EasternShore. We moved from nice urban row house to a falling down wreck
of a farmhouse. It was a 100 yr old house that my folks though they could fix
up. Well it was in the middle of nowhere and that's where we had to stay. My
sister Mary and I were in the 8th and 9th grade and we hated it there. Not long
after we moved in strange things started to happen, Not demon stuff just wierd
things, The place had been abandon for years in fact the Realator had stopped
showing it,but somehow MY folks found out about it. Anyway, we would hear stuff
rolling around up in the attic and stuff would disappear and then show up
somewhere eles. Doors would lock by themselves.The house was one of the old
house that had servent quarters and a special entry to the kitchen. It needed
alot of work, But we made<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it liveable.
But there was one room that was painted balck that was in the front of the
house and my sister and I had to go by it when we wanted to go to our rooms
upstairs, And we both had strange feelings that someone was watching us.We both
grew up and when we both got married,Mary one year and I the next ,both of our
wedding pictures (taken at the house only) didin't come out. I guess our ghost
didn't want us to leave, There are lots of strange stories that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>happened there, too numerous to mention.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">All my life I have had strange
encounters, as most of my extended family. Wierd things have always followed
us. Now stange things are happening to my children. On Thanksgiving back a
couple years ago, some family members were down visiting us and the children
and their cousins were outside playing and decided to go across the street into
the woods and look around. Now our kids know theres a graveyard there, on our
neighbors land. They don't have a problem with the kids being there,because
they know they respect the graves. The kids were bored and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>were just looking at the headstones because
the stones date back to the Civil War. While they were over there, a man they
never saw before came up to them and asked them if they knew whos grave one of
the stones was because the lettering was worn off. They said no and before they
knew it he was gone..They discribed him as wearing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>old time clothing and his face was real pale.
A couple of weeks later my son Ben was studying the Civil War in school and
they had their textbooks open and he saw that man in one of the pictures, but
he didn't have a name. But that was the man they all saw.. Weird</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">My Cousin and I recently went to
the <st1:City><st1:place>hayward</st1:place></st1:City> plunge. And we have
discovered more than we have bargained for. We walked the path to the 8 rock
circle by the creek were the children were supposedly murdered and discovered
that a tree had fallen right ontop of the rock circle. I turned on my Hi 8
samsung camcorder and filmed the surrounding area by the fallen tree. My cousin
then asked "Is anybody here"? Then he asked "If your here what
happened to you"? We paused for a moment and heard a ghostly wind. I then
asked "how you die"?(In all respects) My cousin then said "let
us know your here".We heard More ghostly demon like wind. I asked
"What is your name"?(I heard nothing till we played back the footage)
it sounded like it was a male voice saying robert. Both of our flash lights
died at the same time at that very moment.(VERY CREEPY) Luckily my camcorder
Has a light. I wanted to walk further but my cousin wanted to leave So I
decided to leave my camcorder on. On the way back It sounded live a female in
pain saying Help me or He cut <st1:State><st1:place>me.</st1:place></st1:State>(We
Didnt hear it until we played back the footage). We got back to the parking lot
and the alarm Suddenly went on in the plunge then turned off and then came back
on.(ODD) I have all of this on film but I still need to anylize it. I will keep
you posted</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I have been a long-term care
nurse working exclusively in nursing homes for the last 15 years. In 1997, at a
very large home where I worked I was charting early morning at the nurses'
station which faced directly down each hall, since the building was built in a
spoked-wheel layout with the stations at the center where the halls intersected.
One of the halls which I supervised (a heavily secure unit for Alzheimer's
patients) opened into a wide dining room on the end, with an alarmed and locked
door and several windows which were always kept locked except during the warmer
days when people were being fed under full supervision. I glanced up the hall
because some movement caught my eye in the dining room. It was an elderly lady
with a walker and short hair walking from one end of the dining room towareds
the opposite end of the dining room. She was too far away to determine if she
was a specific patient, and I immediately notified the aide working that hall
that someone was awake that late (about <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2 AM</st1:time>)
and he looked down the hall, saw her, and immediately went down towards the
dining room. I watched as the lady worked her way across the dining room until
she was out of the visual area (from my perspective) and watched as the aide
turned towards the right when he got into the dining room, which is where the
lady was headed. He disappeared around the corner from my view too. Moments
later he came back up the hall shrugging his shoulders and holding his open
hands out. I laughed and said, "very funny", and proceeded down to
the dining room with hime expecting to see her seated in a chair at one of the
dining tables. The dining room was empty. The windows were shut and latched.
The alarmed door was locked and undisturbed. The only people there were the
aide and me. He said, "I saw her too...she was there. If she'd come back
up the hall she'd have walked right towards us. She didn't do that. Where'd she
go?"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I had too much to do to think
about it right at that time. I just shook my head. The lady was not
transparent, I didn't get chills down my spine, and I really was surprised at
how anti-climatic it all was.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I asked around among those who'd
worked there much longer, and one employee related this story to me.
Intentionally I did not divulge too many details so I could find out truth
without making too many suggestions. He told me he'd known of a short-haired
lady that walked from one end of the dining room to the other down at the end
of the Alzheimer's unit. She had short hair, a walker, and always walked from
the left side (if viewed from the nurses' station) to the right side of the
dining room and then was not there when people went looking for her. Now I got
the chills a bit. He recalled a lady that was short-haired who lived - a died
there. She was short-haired, used a walker, but had started to fall far too
often. Regrettably, back in the days when restraints were used, it was decided
to used an old type of "geri-chair" that had a locking table that
went up in front of the patient and locked into place. I was told that after
the freedom of walking was removed from her she quickly lost the will to live,
stopped eating and died. He said he believed that was that woman coming back
and doing what she wanted to do - now that she was freed from her restraints. I
said, "walk on, dear lady, walk on..."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">The aide that worked with me
moved over 1500 miles away, and none of us had remained in touch with him.
About a year later I was relating this strange occurrence with a new nurse
there, and she was disbelieving... I told her how much I wished that the one
person who could corroborate my story were there. Just as she started to
laught, the phone rang and I answered. Guess who was on the line... I now had
my witness and I said to him "Hey, perfect timing! Remember that lady in
the dining room at the end of the Alzheimer's unit?" To which he replied,
"Yeah, you mean the one that disappeared?" "Yes...well, I got a
disbeliever here..." and passed the phone over. She was amazed by the fact
that he called precisely at that time, and that he relayed the exact same story
I just told her...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">I've seen nothing similar since,
nor had I ever prior. I do not claim to be mystic, psychic, clairvoyant. All I
know is what I saw that night, and I can't explain it with what we presently
know scientifically. Ghost? Trapped energy? Spirit? Whatever it may be called,
I know what I saw, and believe.</p>
