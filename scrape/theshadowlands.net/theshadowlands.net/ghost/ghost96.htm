<P>
<P><B>My dog, a female Cairn Terrier, had a big German Shepherd/collie
friend</B>
<P><B>who was about twice her size and some six years older. Nevertheless,</B>
<P><B>they got along fine, and whenever my dog came past her friends house</B>
<P><B>she&#180;d whine for him, and he&#180;d open the door with his paws
and come</B>
<P><B>outside to say hello.</B>
<P><B>But this friend of hers died some weeks ago, of a heart attack. My
dog</B>
<P><B>didn&#180;t know, of course, and she&#180;d still whine for him.About
the third or</B>
<P><B>fourth time we came past that house she whined again, and suddenly</B>
<P><B>started staring at the door and then at the place where her friend
used</B>
<P><B>to sit whe he was outside. All her hair rose and then she started</B>
<P><B>running home as if all the devils in hell where chasing her, and I
after</B>
<P><B>her, being scared shitless by her fear.I must admit I haven&#180;t
dared to</B>
<P><B>go near that house again (coward, yeah :-) but will give it a try
this</B>
<P><B>weekend, to see if the dog&#180;s ghost (I&#180;m sure it was him)
is still there.</B>
<P><B>Maybe he wanted to tell my dog that he&#180;s dead and she noticed
that there</B>
<P><B>was something strange about him? I wished my dog could have told me
what</B>
<P><B>she&#180;d seen!</B>

<P>
<P><B>This story is all true. It isnt scarey in the slightest bit, but
spiritually </B>
<P><B>involved all the way. On Oct. 6, 1998, my best friend whom I grew up
with</B>
<P><B>was murdered. Someone we all knew and thought we could trust. A friend
at that. </B>
<P><B>Her uncle had gotten out of jail and desided that he needed a car for
him</B>
<P><B>and our "friend" to run away in. Jenn, being the only one who the girl
talked to </B>
<P><B>that drove (other than a couple other friends of mine who turned her
uncle </B>
<P><B>and her down), desided that since she wasnt doing anything at the time,
she </B>
<P><B>would give them a ride to the local park. The three of them walked
down into </B>
<P><B>the woods as they wanted Jenn to think they were going to meet some
other </B>
<P><B>people there. A gun shot went off, and the two girls dropped to the
ground. </B>
<P><B>Jenn was shot twice in the back of the neck and the head. This happened
</B>
<P><B>pretty late, and I did not feel well that night. I went to sleep early
that </B>
<P><B>evening. I woke up around 1:00 a.m. in a cold sweat. Out of the blue,
like </B>
<P><B>something loud went off by my ear, though the whole house was quiet.
I laid </B>
<P><B>there for about an hour, troubled and uneasy for unknown reasons when
the </B>
<P><B>phone rang. I didnt answer it, my mom did and came upstairs to ask
me if i </B>
<P><B>knew where Jenny was. I said no, and she informed me that she was
missing</B>
<P><B>and they found her car totalled. Turns out that my "friend" had been
found in</B>
<P><B>the car and showed officers where to find Jennifer. The next afternoon,
I came </B>
<P><B>straight home after school and fell asleep on my bed from lack of sleep
the </B>
<P><B>previous night. I dreamt that I was walking in the woods and I dropped
to the </B>
<P><B>ground as if being pushed down. Then I heard a loud roar and everything
went </B>
<P><B>silent again. I saw nothing but my hand in front of my face unable
to move. </B>
<P><B>The dream ended and I woke up with Jenny lying in the bed next to me.
She </B>
<P><B>talked to me for the longest time, and i talked back to her, even though
I </B>
<P><B>couldnt hear anything we said. She was dressed in her normal clothes,
jeans, </B>
<P><B>a tee shirt, adidas, and her pager and keys in hand. After what seemed
like </B>
<P><B>an hour, though only being a few minutes, we sat up. She gave me the
biggest </B>
<P><B>hug in the world. Then as she dissappeared, she smiled wider than id
ever </B>
<P><B>seen her smile. And then she was gone. I thought to myself, " Is this
a </B>
<P><B>dream? Did Jenn just dissappear into thin air? No..." and the weird
thing</B>
<P><B>is, I never went back to sleep. I actually left my house and shared
my encounter </B>
<P><B>with my two other best friends. That was no dream...  I know that wasnt
</B>
<P><B>scarey, but it still had to do with spiritual encounters. I have some
other </B>
<P><B>stories of ghosts and dreams and paranormal activities, but I'll save
those </B>
<P><B>for another time. If you'd like to hear some of them (some of which
are </B>
<P><B>indeed scarey), Email me at ShrmPrnSes@aol.com...   I hope you enjoyed
my </B>
<P><B>story. Until next time, bye bye.</B>

<P><B>A Passing Spirit</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  "Armetta Wireman" metta@uswest.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have always be intrigued by the paranormal.  As far back as I can
remember</B>
<P><B>I have loved ghost stories, but always thought of it as something
that</B>
<P><B>happened to other people in other places.  Three years ago I found
out</B>
<P><B>different when a passing sprit dropped in on us for a short time.</B>
<P><B>To set the seen I will tell you a little about the place it visited
and the</B>
<P><B>people living there.</B>
<P><B>The place was a large duplex in Des Moines Iowa not to far from the
Iowa</B>
<P><B>state fair grounds. Ten years back my mother had rented out the front
part</B>
<P><B>and along with my sister Jenny and I we lived there for about two
years.</B>
<P><B>Nothing happened then it was just weird when 7 years later the entire
duplex</B>
<P><B>came up for sale, and my mother decided to buy it.</B>
<P><B>My older sister by this time was married and had two children and moved
into</B>
<P><B>the front half of the duplex. My mother and I moved into the back half.
 My</B>
<P><B>oldest sister Betta lived one house away.</B>
<P><B>The years passed and I got married had a child of my own and my the
basement</B>
<P><B>of my mothers side of the duplex into an apartment. So at the time
of the</B>
<P><B>visit the we were all really close and the duplex was seen and one
big house</B>
<P><B>with lots of rooms.</B>
<P><B>It had been about 6 years after my mother bought the duplex when our
brief</B>
<P><B>visitor came.</B>
<P><B>Through the years I had read several books on ghosts and haunting,
and in</B>
<P><B>many of them they say that animals and children often pick up on sprits
that</B>
<P><B>others don't see. These were the first to witness the visitor.</B>
<P><B>One night my little girl (age 3 at the time) was in the living room
on my</B>
<P><B>mothers side of the duplex watching t.v. My mother and I were in the
kitchen</B>
<P><B>talking. When all the sudden she came running in screaming and crying.
 I</B>
<P><B>asked her what was wrong and she said there was someone in the
livingroom.</B>
<P><B>So I went in there, but I saw nothing.</B>
<P><B>I asked her where the person was and she said they were sitting on
the foot</B>
<P><B>stool.  The footstool she was talking about was large, brown, and
square.</B>
<P><B>Its size was 3ft by 3ft and sat in the between to large arm chairs.</B>
<P><B>I went over to the footstool and sat on it and said honey there is
nothing</B>
<P><B>here.  She said it was gone now, but went into the kitchen and would
not go</B>
<P><B>back into the living room the rest of the night.  I wasn't sure what
to</B>
<P><B>think about the incident at that time, but I didn't get the feeling
she was</B>
<P><B>making it up.  I felt strange about the whole thing, my mother just
laughed</B>
<P><B>it off.</B>
<P><B>Two nights later my mothers dog Jasmine (a small black Pomeranian)</B>
<P><B>was in the living room by herself, my daughter was downstairs with
her dad</B>
<P><B>and my mother and I were again at the kitchen table talking. ( the
kitchen</B>
<P><B>table has always been where our family sits to visit). There was without
a</B>
<P><B>doubt no one in the living room but the dog. There is a mirror on the
wall</B>
<P><B>of the kitchen just as you start to enter the living room and you can
see</B>
<P><B>half of the living room when you look in the mirror while your sitting
at</B>
<P><B>the kitchen table.</B>
<P><B>This dog is the type of dog that just loves people. She don't care
if your a</B>
<P><B>stranger or a member of the family.  She never barks or growls at anyone
and</B>
<P><B>shes not scared of anything. Even if this dog knows she did something
wrong</B>
<P><B>she came right to ya. She didn't run and hide like alot of dogs due.</B>
<P><B>As I was saying my mother and I were in the kitchen talking when all
of the</B>
<P><B>sudden Jasmine goes nuts.  She starts barking and growling. Then she
let out</B>
<P><B>a big yelp.  I glanced in the mirror and saw nothing. Thats when we
got up</B>
<P><B>and in to see what was up.</B>
<P><B>When we got into the living room Jasmine was nowhere to be seen.</B>
<P><B>My mother called for her, and we heard her whimper from under the
couch.</B>
<P><B>She didn't come out for a while after that.  This happened a few more
times</B>
<P><B>during the time of the visit as well as my daughter's experience.</B>
<P><B>At this point I remember what I had read about children and animals
seeing</B>
<P><B>things that we can't. This is when I really start to wonder.</B>
<P><B>Two weeks went by after this and nothing happened.</B>
<P><B>one late afternoon I came upstairs set some meat to thaw for supper.
 My</B>
<P><B>mother was in the bathroom.  I took some chicken out of the freezer,
and</B>
<P><B>looked in the living room to see what mom was up to.  I saw her bible</B>
<P><B>sitting on the table and the bathroom door was closed.  I went back</B>
<P><B>downstairs.  Two minutes later my mom hollers down and ask me if what
I had</B>
<P><B>wanted.</B>
<P><B>I said nothing I just came up to set some chicken out to thaw.  She
said she</B>
<P><B>could have swore that I asked her a question while I was up there.
 I told</B>
<P><B>her nope I just set the chicken out.  She then goes into the living
room to</B>
<P><B>continue her reading (My mother likes to sit at a dining room table
in the</B>
<P><B>living room  read her bible, and watch t.v. ) I heard her footsteps
as she</B>
<P><B>walked in there and then heard her stomping right back to the basement
door.</B>
<P><B>(the door is just off the kitchen)</B>
<P><B>She then yells down "What is this for?"</B>
<P><B>I said "What are you talking about?"</B>
<P><B>she yells "This feather"</B>
<P><B>I said "What feather?"</B>
<P><B>she goes "The feather you left on the table in the living room"</B>
<P><B>I said "Mom I never even went in the living room.  I just came up and
set</B>
<P><B>the chicken out"</B>
<P><B>she goes "Are you trying to make me feel like I am going nuts."</B>
<P><B>At this point I came upstairs and asked her what she was talking about.
 She</B>
<P><B>took me into the living room and pointed to the table on the table
next to</B>
<P><B>her bible there was a long white feather. She goes why did you put
that</B>
<P><B>there.</B>
<P><B>I said " I didn't.  I just came out and set out the chicken and looked
in</B>
<P><B>the living room to see what your were doing, and went back down
stairs."</B>
<P><B>She looks at me and I can tell she don't believe me.  I proceed to
deny</B>
<P><B>leaving her a feather and show her step by step what I did.</B>
<P><B>Finally she believes me and then asks if I had seen the feather when
I</B>
<P><B>looked into the living room.  I told her I had not.  The only thing
I had</B>
<P><B>seen was her bible sitting on the table.  She says well maybe Jenny
left it.</B>
<P><B>I told her Jenny wasn't home she left about two hours ago to with the
kids</B>
<P><B>and her husband to go see her husband's mother on the other side of
town.</B>
<P><B>Not to mention we would have heard them come in.  The back door sticks
and</B>
<P><B>the front door has chimes on it that jingle whenever the door is
opened.</B>
<P><B>She stuck the feather in her bible and she still has it to this day.</B>
<P><B>A couple days later my sisters husband and her son went fishing.  Her
son</B>
<P><B>caught two tiny blue gill and refused to toss them back.  His father
let him</B>
<P><B>bring them home and my mother let him stick them in her bathtub for
night.</B>
<P><B>(He was afraid to leave them outside because he thought a cat might
get</B>
<P><B>them.) She told him they had to be out in two days she would use the
shower</B>
<P><B>downstairs until then.  The next day he brought one of his friends
over to</B>
<P><B>see the fish. My mom led them to the bathroom and opened up the
bathroom</B>
<P><B>door.  My mother had been in the bathroom just an hour earlier and
both fish</B>
<P><B>were swimming around without a care in the world, but when she took
the boys</B>
<P><B>in to see the fish there was only one in the tub.</B>
<P><B>No one had been in that bathroom since she was in there last.</B>
<P><B>The dog was outside.  No one had even been in my moms part of the
duplex</B>
<P><B>except for her. Between the time she took the boys into the bathroom
and the</B>
<P><B>last time that she herself had been in there.</B>
<P><B>The fish was no where to be found the bathroom was searched the toilet
lid</B>
<P><B>was down. Both fish had been in there when she closed the door to leave
the</B>
<P><B>last time, but now one was missing. There are no windows in the bathroom
and</B>
<P><B>you have to go thur the living room to get to it.  No one had passed
my</B>
<P><B>mother.  No noises had come from the bathroom.  The fish was never
found.</B>
<P><B>Its buddy was taken out of the tub and set free in the creek behind
the</B>
<P><B>house that day.</B>
<P><B>Other things disappeared. My moms favorite pan that she loved to make</B>
<P><B>spagetti in. The entire family had been there one night and we had
spagetti</B>
<P><B>and garlic bread.  The night ran late and she decided to save the pans
for</B>
<P><B>the morning, but when she got up her big pan was gone.</B>
<P><B>The final visit happened one night when my oldest sister Betta had
came over</B>
<P><B>to visit with my mother.  They were sitting at the kitchen table. I
was not</B>
<P><B>home me, my child and my husband were out for the night, and my other
sister</B>
<P><B>jenny was at home on her side of the duplex.</B>
<P><B>They were the only ones on mom's side of the duplex.</B>
<P><B>As they were talking Betta caught a movement in the mirror on the wall
out</B>
<P><B>the corner of her eye.  But when she looked she saw nothing.</B>
<P><B>Betta said nothing about it and her and mom continued to keep
talking.</B>
<P><B>Until Betta sees movement again.  She looked at the doorway into the</B>
<P><B>livingroom this time and saw briefly someone poke their head around
the</B>
<P><B>corner and look at her.</B>
<P><B>She asked mom who was in the livingroom.  Mom said no one Jenny is
at home</B>
<P><B>and Peppy, Steve and Amber are gone tonight.</B>
<P><B>Betta goes "There is someone in the living room they just poked their
head</B>
<P><B>in and looked at me".</B>
<P><B>Mom said "There is no one in there that I know of."</B>
<P><B>So Betta went in and looked.  No one was to be seen.</B>
<P><B>She comes back in and tells mom. " I know there was someone in there
she had</B>
<P><B>blonde hair and it was up on her head like a bun.  She was peeking
around</B>
<P><B>the corner and then seemed to walk away."</B>
<P><B>They both got the chills.</B>
<P><B>After that night nothing else happened in our house.</B>
<P><B>But the next day Betta was at home sitting in her livingroom.  No one
else</B>
<P><B>was home.</B>
<P><B>When she heard a noise in her kitchen. Just as she walked in everything
on</B>
<P><B>the top of her fridge fell to the floor like someone had just flung
there</B>
<P><B>arm acrossed the top and pushed everything off.</B>
<P><B>Then nothing. Nothing else happened there or at my moms, and hasn't
since.</B>
<P><B>That was about 4 years ago.  And nothing else has happened since.</B>
<P><B>The sprit just passed thur on its way to somewhere else to played
some</B>
<P><B>tricks and then moved on. But i for one will never forget it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Cold Fog</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: b2tslu1@fuse.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several years back, 1983, the summer of I think, or 1982, my girl
friend</B>
<P><B>and I where in my old 4x4 dodge on my dad's farm, being teenagers at
the</B>
<P><B>time and wanting to be alone for the night, we figured that no one
would</B>
<P><B>bother us on my dads farm unless they had a 4x4 or tractor to get
where</B>
<P><B>we was at....we both had our own stories fabricated and friends to
cover</B>
<P><B>for us, I'm sure you know how teenagers are....We had parked in a
field</B>
<P><B>below the barn, really close the the wood line or forest area of the</B>
<P><B>farm, the tree scenery was really romantic,  we hadn't been there a
half</B>
<P><B>an hour when we both felt as if something terrible wrong was about
to</B>
<P><B>happen, that gut feeling of half panic and fear you get in your chest,
I</B>
<P><B>rationalized it as being the fear of being caught together in the
middle</B>
<P><B>of nowhere by our parents when we had lied about our where abouts for</B>
<P><B>the weekend. The feeling got more intense for the both of us, we got</B>
<P><B>back in the truck and listened to the radio and talked about our</B>
<P><B>friends, school, anything that seemed to put us at ease, it seemed
to</B>
<P><B>work, but then it happened, I still have no explanation for it, and
it</B>
<P><B>does ( the feeling we encountered)  bothers me to this day, we had</B>
<P><B>parked facing a small pond, the field that we where in was
relativlately</B>
<P><B>square, and this pond was in one corner, to our left was the opposite</B>
<P><B>corner, also lined with trees, through the trees we could see a faint</B>
<P><B>light, a whitish green dim light, it looked like a light in a fog,
we</B>
<P><B>could see the shadows of the trees through this fog lit light, and
it</B>
<P><B>was moving towards us, I thought that maybe someone was looking for
us,</B>
<P><B>or that somebody was out spot lighting, but the light seemed to be
in a</B>
<P><B>fog, this fog of light had me puzzled, my girl friend mentioned the</B>
<P><B>possibility that one of our friends maybe playing a trick on us,
trying</B>
<P><B>to scare us, the practical joke thing, and that was what it was, so
I</B>
<P><B>thought that I would drive right up to the tree line and shine my
head</B>
<P><B>lights on them, as I fumbled to get my keys out of my pocket, the
light</B>
<P><B>sped up as it came through the trees, I realized , as did she that
no</B>
<P><B>one could move that quick through the woods and she grabbed unto me,
the</B>
<P><B>fog of light came out of the tree line and into the field, it was
about</B>
<P><B>10 to 12 feet wide by about 6 to 8 feet tall and was about 20 feet
long,</B>
<P><B>it seemed to pause for a few seconds after it broke the tree line and</B>
<P><B>then it rushed the truck, she screamed and I screamed, It enveloped
the</B>
<P><B>truck, the temperature dropped what seemed like 20 degrees, and there</B>
<P><B>was static electric in the air, (even after it was gone) it moved off</B>
<P><B>going on through the field, and passing into the tree line opposite
of</B>
<P><B>where it entered, where it seemed to fade away into the woods, do you</B>
<P><B>have an explanation as to what this could have been? This has bugged
me</B>
<P><B>for years.....</B>
<P>
<P><B>Dad's Presence</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: melissa@languageline.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My father passed away November 19, 1986 after a four month battle with
the</B>
<P><B>same cancer that had caused his father's death July 1, 1986. He was
always</B>
<P><B>the "rock of Gibralter" for our family. Four years after my mom and
dad</B>
<P><B>married, my mom contracted polio meningitis and almost died. I remember
my</B>
<P><B>mom and dad telling me how their belief in God was what helped them
through</B>
<P><B>those terrible times (eight operations in three months, in an iron
lung for</B>
<P><B>almost as long, being told she would never walk or breathe on her own</B>
<P><B>again). When she had recovered enough so she could walk with a cane,
she was</B>
<P><B>informed that in order to have children she would literally need to
stay in</B>
<P><B>bed for 9 months. Well since this was not an option they adopted me
in 1960</B>
<P><B>and my sister in 1963. This background is so you understand the bond
my</B>
<P><B>family shares. Mom's attitude was always "don't tell me I can't do
it, help</B>
<P><B>me find a way to do it" and Dad was totally devoted to her and to us
girls.</B>
<P><B>When he became so ill that he could no longer tolerate the chemo he
told the</B>
<P><B>doctor that he wanted to die at home. We set up 'round the clock home</B>
<P><B>nursing and my mom was an RN prior to her illness and had kept up over
the</B>
<P><B>years so she was able to help. One week before he died, my mom called
me at</B>
<P><B>work to tell me the Dr. had said "It might be a week, a day or an hour
but</B>
<P><B>come home soon." Needless to say I rushed home. The morning of his
death, I</B>
<P><B>was headed out to my parents home with donuts and I was approx 11 miles
from</B>
<P><B>their home when I felt him "let go". I looked up and said "I love you
daddy</B>
<P><B>- see you on the other side." When I pulled into the driveway our family
Dr</B>
<P><B>was just leaving the house and I asked (though a part of me already
knew)</B>
<P><B>"How's he doing this morning?" To which he replied that he had died
approx</B>
<P><B>15 minutes before - WHEN I FELT HIM LET GO!. Well a few years later
my</B>
<P><B>sister had married and moved to New Mexico and was having some health</B>
<P><B>problems of her own. She was a vegetarian, exercised daily and never
drank</B>
<P><B>or smoked. She thought perhaps she had pulled a muscle while in training
to</B>
<P><B>become an FBI agent. The pain started to migrate and she and her hubby
were</B>
<P><B>at the mercy of their HMO. Finally after months (March - November 97)
of no</B>
<P><B>ans and her getting sicker and sicker - her hubby ran her to the hospital
in</B>
<P><B>the little town where they had lived since June. The Thursday before</B>
<P><B>Thanksgiving that year she was admitted and she was scaring the DR's
because</B>
<P><B>they could not figure out what was wrong. That Saturday they life
flighted</B>
<P><B>her to Albuquerque where by Monday they had a diffinitive diagnosis
of</B>
<P><B>terminal breast cancer. What a waste! The Wednesday prior to this was</B>
<P><B>November 19th and my father and mom used to be part of the church
choir.</B>
<P><B>Wednedsdays where rehearsal night. A good friend of the family was
openning</B>
<P><B>up the church and getting set for rehearsal. She came in the door and
looked</B>
<P><B>up into the choir loft behind the podiums and there was Dad smiling
at her.</B>
<P><B>Really spooked her and she could not figure out why she would be the
one to</B>
<P><B>see him there. Later in the night when she was getting ready to leave
she</B>
<P><B>could hear a sound like keys jingling - my father had a habit that
when</B>
<P><B>impatient or bored he would jingle his key and loose change in is
pocket.</B>
<P><B>Only when my mom shared by sisters plight did she realize that the
night she</B>
<P><B>saw him was the night before my sister went into the hospital for the
last</B>
<P><B>time. Mom and I like to think that he was just letting us know that
he was</B>
<P><B>waiting for my sis when her turn came - January 7,1998 - her 35th
birthday</B>
<P><B>would have been that January 24th.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Experiencing Ernie</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: bolt0007@algonquinc.on.ca</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>At my grandparents place, a long time ago, they decided to make an</B>
<P><B>addition to the house. A man name Ernie was helping them. To make a
long</B>
<P><B>story short, he fell off a latter, and died on the spot.</B>
<P><B>Years latter, I go to their house all the time. One night, we were</B>
<P><B>sitting, watching television. I saw someone walk to the side door,
but</B>
<P><B>the dog didn't bark, so I told my granmother. She asked me what I
saw,</B>
<P><B>and I said a guy with a feather cap. She told me it was just Ernie,
the</B>
<P><B>ghost. He walks up the driveway ever now an again. iwas kinda
shocked.</B>
<P><B>About thre emonths later, I saw the man again, so I ran to the
upstairs</B>
<P><B>window. I looked out. My grandparents have a large back yard that
ends</B>
<P><B>in a forest.</B>
<P><B>Anyway, I proceeded to watch him walk to the edge of the trees.</B>
<P><B>Suddenly, he just stopped. I was kinda shocked again. He turned
around.</B>
<P><B>and looked at me. It felt lik ehe looked through me. Suddenly, he was</B>
<P><B>right in front of my face. I coul dmake out everything, and then he
was</B>
<P><B>gone. I have not seen him since.</B>

<P><B>Ghostly Experience</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Vilna6@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>   This is probably not considered a ghost story, but more of an</B>
<P><B>out-of-body experience.  I am 17 and experienced this at least three
times in my </B>
<P><B>lifetime.  This only happened to me in my bedroom.  I remember once,
I fell asleep from the </B>
<P><B>boredom of reading a school book.  However, I wasn't sure if I was</B>
<P><B>completely asleep because I felt that I was still conscious.  Then,
my legs slowly began to </B>
<P><B>rise up in the air, and I knew that I wasn't controlling this movement.
 I opened my eyes </B>
<P><B>and tried to move my arms, but I couldn't.  Also, I couldn't scream
nor even open my </B>
<P><B>mouth, and I was terrified.  Then, slowly, my entire body began to
rise up in the </B>
<P><B>air and I started to float around the room, hitting every corner in
the ceiling.  I </B>
<P><B>realized that this was a dream and tried to wake up, but I couldn't.
 You see, I heard stories </B>
<P><B>before about such experiences and others said the person involved could
go anywhere </B>
<P><B>he or she desired.  Its like I knew all this during the dream.  I
willingly</B>
<P><B>floated to the window and began to wish that I was at my school....I
wanted to go to my </B>
<P><B>school for some odd reason.  I even closed my eyes, wishing desperately,
but when I </B>
<P><B>opened them, I was lying on my bed as if nothing happened.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Ghosts</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: J117400000@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I guess what I have is a minor experience but it doesnt seem so mild
when it </B>
<P><B>happens!  I've never really considered myself a believer in the paranormal
</B>
<P><B>but I have never been able to explain this.  I grew up in a house with
only </B>
<P><B>one previous owner before my parents.  Nothing that I know of ever
happened </B>
<P><B>to explain a haunting.  Basically if you look down the hall on the
first </B>
<P><B>floor to the left is the bathroom, in the middle is my old
bedroom(now</B>
<P><B>just a junk room), and on the right is my parent's room. All of my
family members </B>
<P><B>has encountered this "thing", yet no one really has taken it seriously.
Its </B>
<P><B>as if we just dont think about it until we see it. Sitting in the
living</B>
<P><B>room (most of the room can be seen from the hallway and vice versa)
what is seen </B>
<P><B>is comparable to seeing a person walking from the corner of your eye.
More</B>
<P><B>or less just a movement of a shape.  However this happens when you
are looking </B>
<P><B>directly down the hall, just the same as catching a glimpse out of
the</B>
<P><B>corner of your eye.</B>
<P><B>"It" is a flash or a flowing movement. Its really hard to explain.
It seems </B>
<P><B>transparent, with no describable form or shape yet it seems to move
as a </B>
<P><B>human does.  When it happens to each of my family , we are aware of
our </B>
<P><B>surroundings, no wind, no cars, nothing to create a glare or shadow
to </B>
<P><B>explain this.  And the shape always moves from the bathroom to my parents
</B>
<P><B>room. My mother says she has never had reason to believe "It" has
entered</B>
<P><B>the room.  None of us are frightened by it, though it is disconcerting
to say</B>
<P><B>the least.  We all have our theories on it.  I seem to identify "It"
as male,  </B>
<P><B>but my mother likes to think its her dead mother "checking up on things".
 I </B>
<P><B>would never go to the bathroom at night because I just didnt want to
run</B>
<P><B>into "It"  I remember as a child moving to an upstairs bedroom after
my brother </B>
<P><B>moved out, I thought I saw something move up the steps.  I didn't like
that </B>
<P><B>idea after thinking about the shadow so i snuck down the hall one
night</B>
<P><B>and i remember whispering " I don't mind that you are here, it's ok
we like you, </B>
<P><B>but could you please stay downstairs?  I get scared at night"  I laugh
now </B>
<P><B>thinking about that, but you know what? i never saw the movement on
the </B>
<P><B>stairways or in my room after that! I guess "It" appreciated my </B>
<P><B>politeness....I've seen "It" once or twice when visiting my parents,
and my </B>
<P><B>mother just looked at me with eyebrows raised and I looked at the tv
saying </B>
<P><B>"Nope, didnt just see that"  My exboyfriend was not a believer yet
I saw him </B>
<P><B>once or twice doing a doubletake and peering down the hall, but he
never </B>
<P><B>admitted seeing anything. My current boyfriend is a complete skeptic
and </B>
<P><B>laughs off the story, but I have to laugh and just wait until he gets
to</B>
<P><B>meet our resident "It".  It's something I actually look forward to...like
</B>
<P><B>introducing him to an old family friend....</B>

<P><B>Grandmother</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: lhammond@uswest.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ok, A few years ago I wanted to know more about my</B>
<P><B>grandmother whom I had never met. I went to my father, since</B>
<P><B>it was his mother, and asked him some questions. He wouldn't</B>
<P><B>give me any answers, so naturally I dwelled on it and talked</B>
<P><B>about it with everyone I knew. One night a friend of mine</B>
<P><B>and myself though it would be "fun" to dabble with some</B>
<P><B>supernatural, paranormal...whatever you wish to call it,</B>
<P><B>kind of things. All I had for light were candles {because</B>
<P><B>I'm up at night and don't care for electric bills being too</B>
<P><B>high}. After a while of talking about her {my grandmother} I</B>
<P><B>saw someone hanging in the corner of my bedroom. {What was</B>
<P><B>odd is I saw the image clearly, very well lit even though I</B>
<P><B>only had candles lit.} After staring at it for what felt</B>
<P><B>like forever, I looked over at my friend and ran out of the</B>
<P><B>room. I went to my father and got a picture of my</B>
<P><B>grandmother {I had never even seen a picture of her, not one</B>
<P><B>when she was close to the time of her death} and realized</B>
<P><B>that it was her that I had seen. I knew then that something</B>
<P><B>was wrong. I had been told all my life that she had died of</B>
<P><B>breast cancer. I asked my father repeatedly how she had died</B>
<P><B>and he told me the same thing, breast cancer. I knew he was</B>
<P><B>lying, but I didn't know why. So I went back up to my room,</B>
<P><B>where I found my friend hysterical. When I asked her what</B>
<P><B>was wrong she told me that I had been staring in the corner</B>
<P><B>for at least five minutes, and that she thought I was going</B>
<P><B>to die or something because I was shaking, rocking and</B>
<P><B>crying. She didn't know what to do. And then when I just</B>
<P><B>snapped out of it, it had scared her. I told her what I had</B>
<P><B>seen and then called my mother. Still being somewhat</B>
<P><B>hysterical myself, my mother was very concerned. I asked how</B>
<P><B>my grandmother had really died. She knew something was wrong</B>
<P><B>immediately when I asked that question because I had called</B>
<P><B>her when she was away on business, and I never do that. She</B>
<P><B>asked what was wrong and I told her too what had just</B>
<P><B>happened. All she could say for a response was "Lizzy, she</B>
<P><B>hung herself!" Ever since that day I can't get rid of the</B>
<P><B>feeling that she is always around me, I feel protected but</B>
<P><B>sometimes I also feel uncomfortable. That wasn't the first</B>
<P><B>time anything weird had ever happened to me, but since then</B>
<P><B>things keep getting worse...and more regular.</B>
<P><B>I was wondering if you had ever heard of this happening</B>
<P><B>before {which I'm sure you have} and if you know what I can</B>
<P><B>do to...I don't know, make things so they aren't as akward?</B>
<P><B>And if you don't, if you know someone who may know? Thank</B>
<P><B>you.</B>

<P><B>Grandma's Ghosts</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  cherdallascowboy@hotmail.com&gt;</B>
<P>
<P><B>This web site is great. Keep up the good work! Ever since I can remember,
my </B>
<P><B>grandma told me tales of things that happened in her moms house, from
when </B>
<P><B>she was little up to when my mother was little.(That is when my </B>
<P><B>great-grandpa decided to sell the house, QUICK.)</B>
<P><B>The first big thing happened when my grandma was in high school. Her
older </B>
<P><B>sister used to crawl out the window, because my great-grandpa wouldn't
allow </B>
<P><B>her to date. One night my grandma woke up to the window rattling. Thinking
</B>
<P><B>it was her sister, she rolled over and put the pillow over her head.
The </B>
<P><B>rattling didn't quit. She looked up and saw a big dark figure at the
window. </B>
<P><B>She screamed which brought in the whole family. My great grandpa sent
his </B>
<P><B>son to get the cops and he jerked the window up to crawl through.(He
thought </B>
<P><B>it was a boy in high school messing around). He stopped dead in his
tracks </B>
<P><B>when lying on the window sill was a BLOODY knife. The cops arrived
and they </B>
<P><B>went to check for footprints.(It was winter and lots of snow). The
only </B>
<P><B>prints there were going towards the window-none leaving- and they started
</B>
<P><B>already half-way to the window. No prints on the knife. I still have
a </B>
<P><B>police report from this. More later.</B>
