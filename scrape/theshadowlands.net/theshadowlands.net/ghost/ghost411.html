Arlesey, Beds<br>
<br>
By: addresss withheld by request<br>
<br>
Almost 17 years ago my husband and I rented an old (possibly Victorian)
two-bedroomed cottage in Davis Row in Arlesey, Bedfordshire.&nbsp;
During our stay there I was pregnant on two occasions.&nbsp; Something
or someone in that house did not seem to like pregnant women.&nbsp;
During my first pregnancy my husband would leave the house around
5.30am to go to work.&nbsp; Within minutes of his closing the
door&nbsp; I would sense a presence moving around my bed, leaving me
frozen to the spot, petrified.&nbsp; This would last for around 2-3
minutes (although it seemed like an eternity at the time) and would go
away as suddenly as it began.&nbsp; There were no such further
sensations after our baby was born (I put it down to pregnancy hormones
and an overactive imagination at the time).&nbsp; Two and a half years
later, during my second pregnancy the same thing would happen, but this
time my husband also noticed some strange occurrences in the
cottage.&nbsp; One of the most memorable for him was being woken up
(he'd been asleep during the day having worked a night shift) early
afternoon by a loud rustling of plastic carrier bags coming from
downstairs.&nbsp; After going to investigate (he'd assumed I'd come
home from work early, laden with shopping bags), he found no-one
there.&nbsp; This happened on a couple of occasions.&nbsp; We later
found out that the cupboard in which we stored our spare plastic
shopping bags had previously been the back door to the cottage (it had
since been extended and the doorway turned into a
cupboard).&nbsp;&nbsp; At other times we individually sensed someone or
something behind us in the house (on separate occasions) and I swear to
this day that something/someone actually prodded my shoulder from
behind a few times.&nbsp; My husband has always believed in ghosts (he
claims he saw one whilst staying at his grandparents' house in Swindon
as a child); I, however, am a sceptic.&nbsp; However, I must admit to
being mightily relieved when we finally moved out of that cottage some
3 months before our second child was born.&nbsp; We lived just 5
minutes walk away from the former Fairfield Hospital in Arlesey.&nbsp;
We never discussed this with any of our neighbours there in case they
suggested we were in need of a break at Fairfield!<br>

My Experience<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
When I was about 12 I use to go to Washington Heights Baptist Church in
South Ogden.&nbsp; My brother and I and two friends went to the end of
the parking lot to hike down the hill.&nbsp; The hill goes down to
Uinta Cemetary is where it opens up to.&nbsp; Well we all walk down a
little trail down there, they got ahead of me when I stopped to look at
a footprint.&nbsp; All of a sudden I heard something in the
trees,&nbsp; I was so scared at the&nbsp; time after seeing a big foot
print there.&nbsp; We lived in South Weber at the time so we always
heard stories about Satschwatch.&nbsp; I took off running up that hill
so fast and I could hear something big behind me coming after me.&nbsp;
I made it up the hill and started crying until my brother got up there
and I told him about it.&nbsp; It was so real and I know something was
chasing me I just don't know what.&nbsp; I thought maybe it had
something to do with being so close to that cemetary.&nbsp; To this day
I am 22 years old and I will never catch myself down there.&nbsp;
Whatever it is, it was enough to keep me away from there.&nbsp; Just
thought that would be interesting for someone to check out.&nbsp; This
was in the middle of the day, but it is so quiet when you go down there
also you just never know.&nbsp; <br>

are three bedrooms,one kitcken,one dining and one living room.when I
was 9-10 (I,m 13 now) I saw a strange shadowy figure in the 3rd
bedroom.And then a box of toys fell as the shadow went through it.I was
scared and didn't go to investigate.I told my parents about it but they
didn't believe me.<br>
The next few months it was quiet but then I saw it again.I went to investigate but he wasn't there.<br>
two years later,when I&nbsp; was 12 I saw him again.This time he was
looking for something and making a lot of noise.I went in and saw him
looking through my old toy box,the one which fell when he went through
it years ago.I went closer and he saw me.his eyes were red,blood red.He
soon floated out the window.<br>
I had many paranormal experiences in the last 3 years.I saw a white
figure at my friends house but he didn't see anything.And once at my
aunts house i saw a cloudy woman under a tree who disappeared.If you

Our family house in Caloocan City, Philippines<br>
<br>
<br>
By: proud_pinoy7193@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
These are my experiences in our house erected in the City of Caloocan, Philippines<br>
First and foremost, we bought a corner lot land with a house already
erected upon it. The house was so old and a loony, but firendly man,
lived there. His family owned the house. I don't know what made him
crazy though(ghosts?). Moving on. We demolished the whole house to the
ground. Take note, the house is old, very old. And I beleive the
mothero f the family died there. But, we didn't demolish the main
bathroom. The bathroom was 5X4 feet small. That particular bathroom was
lit by strong, long-lasting bulbs. But, the lgiht bulbs we put on, only
lasts for a week. Ghosts are reported to take energy from
batteries/bulbs when present, causing run-outs. <br>
The ground floor of the house was a clinic/mini-hospital. My dad owned
it. My dad was a doctor. He conducted maternal operations, you nkow,
women have babies in our clinic. SOmetimes, the baby comes out DEAD.
The clinic staff then started hearing small cries of babies at night.
And small footsteps upstairs in the residential section of the
buliding. I lived up there. <br>
Sometimes, I go downstairs to check on my dad. One night, he asked me
to lock-up the garage door. So, I did. I had to walk a short hallway to
get to the garage door. WHiel I was walking, I had this feeling that
someone was watching me. But I was all alone. <br>
But, the freakiest of them all, is the night puller. I called
him/her/it the night puller becuaseo f this story. One night, I was
sleeping in the bedroom with my smaller brothers since we shared it.
one night, my brothers were fast asleep, snoring actually. I never
shared blankets with them, since I'm bigger. Then all of a sudden, I
felt my blanket moving toward a certain direction. I looked, it was
going toward the lower end of my bed and down under it. I was so
shocked I tried to scream, but I coudln't. When I woke up, I saw my
blanket all crumpled up to a ball, sitting on my reading
chair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

The Undead<br>
<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When I was 6 and I had just moved into my new house I started to feel
uneasy. I had just finished making my bed and was getting my shoes on
when I heard a faint call. It sounded like a screem from far away. I
didn't care but whan it got closer and closer I relised it was calling
my name. It got so close it was practilly out my window. I ran down the
stares and into the kitchen where my mom was making breakfast. I told
her about it and she just told me it was all in my head. I slept with
my mom that night.<br>
The next time I heard the ghostly screems was when I was 7. I was in my
bed watching a movie when I herd someone walking up the steps. "Mom?" I
asked coming out of my room. I saw fog and I heard breathing. It yelled
softly and I heard it. I screamed and mom came running up the steps.
The fog went away. She asked me what was wrong. Then the power went
out. I had to leave the house me and my mom. She didn't believe me when
I said the house was haunted. But it is. The power and the heat would
shut off and somethimes the stove wouldn't turn on. We moved and that
was the very last time the ghost stured up my life. And after 4 years
it may never come back.<br>
If u know any info on this can u please e-mail me<br>

A Presence<br>
<br>
By: SCARED IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY <br>
<br>
THERE IS SOMETHING IN OUR HOUSE AND IT IS NOT AFRAID TO BE SEEN OR
FELT. EVERYTHING FROM A BUMP FROM THE NEXT ROOM, SEEING IT FROM THE
CORNER OF YOUR EYE AND SOMETIMES EVEN COMING FACE TO FACE WITH IT.
EVERYTHING STARTED SINCE I CAN REMEMBER. WE MOVED INTO THIS HOUSE WHEN
I WAS ONLY FIVE I'M 19 RIGHT NOW. THATS WHEN WIERD THINGS STARTED
HAPPENING. EVERYONE FELT IT, BUT IT STARTED CONCENTRATING ON ME FOR
SOME REASON. THERE SO MANY STORIES (YOU MIGHT CALL THAM THAT) BUT RIGHT
NOW I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT TWO. <br>
THE FIRST ONE HAPPENED WHEN I WAS 17. MY GRANDMOTHER FROM FLORIDA CAME
TO VISIT. SHE WAS HOME ALONE AND WAS IN THE DINNING ROOM READING THE
PAPER. AFTER A WHILE SHE GOT TIRED AND HEADED TO MY MOTHERS ROOM TO LAY
DOWN. MY GRANDMOTHER WALKED DOWN THE HALLWAY TO THE RROM AND WHEN SHE
GOT TO THE DOORWAY SHE SAW ME ON MY HANDS AND KNEES LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING UNDER THE BED. TO NOT DISTURB ME SHE WENT BACK TO THE DINNING
ROOM. AND JUST AS SHE SAT DOWN I WALKED IN THE FRONT DOOR.(NOW IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE SNEEKED OUT WITH OUT MY GRANDMA SEEING ME, CAUSE MY
PARENTS ROOM IS JONIED TO THE HOUSE BY A NARROW HALL WHICH GOES INTO
THE DINNING ROOM) MY GRANDMOTHER GOT SCARED FOR NOW SHE THOUGHT&nbsp;
THERE WAS A BURGALAR IN THE HOUSE. UPON TELLING ME WHAT SHE JUST SAW, I
WENT STRAIGHT TO MY PARENTS ROOM TO SEE WHO WAS IN OUR HOME. BUT AFTER
INSPECTING THE ROOM AND WALK IN CLOSET, THERE WAS NO ONE THERE. <br>
THE SECOND STORY HAPPENED WHEN I WAS ALONE AT THE HOUSE. MY PARENTS
WERE VISITING MY OTHER GRANDMOTHER WHO LIVED IN THE NEXT TOWN, ABOUT
30min AWAY. I WAS WATCHING T.V. IN THE DEN WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I FELT
UNEASY, LIKE I WAS BEIING WATCHED. FEAR JUST TOOK A HOLD ME. THAT WHEN
THE BATHROOM DOOR CLOSED NOT JUST A SEMI CLOSED BUT A FULL CLOSED DOOR.
THE TYPE WERE YOU HERE THE CLICK. IN THIS POSITION THE DOOR WILL NOT
OPEN WITH A SIMPLE PUSH. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO TURN THE KNOB TO RE-OPEN
IT.AND OUR BATHROOM DOOR, YOU CAN HEAR FROM ONE END OF THE HOUSE TO THE
OTHER. IT HAS THIS CREAK.&nbsp; AT FIRST I THOUHGT IT WAS THE WIND BUT
OUR WINDOWS WERE CLOSED. MAYBE THE HOUSE SETTLED AND THAT IS WHAT
CAUSED THE DOOR TO CLOSE. AS I STARTED TO MAKE UP REASONS WHY IT
CLOSED. THE DANM DOOR OPENED AND YOU CAN IT CREAK. FOR A WHOLE THIRTY
MINUTES THE DOOR KEPT OPENING AND CLOSING. THROUGHT OUT THE WHOLE TIME
I WAS IN THE DEN TERRIFIED. I DID NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE CAUSE IN ORDER TO
DO SO I HAD TO PASS IN FRONT OF THE BATHROOM. I STAYED THERE SCARED TIL
MY PARENTS GOT HOME. AND RIGHT WHN THEY PULLED INTO THE DRIVE WAY,
THATS WHEN IT STOPPED. ALL THIS STILL HAPPENS BUT THOSE ARE OTHER
STORIES. THIS MIGHT NOT SOUND SCARY TO YOU ALL, BUT IT SCARED THE HECK
OUT OF ME AND IT STILL DOES.<br>

Construction Site<br>
<br>
<br>
By: sulphur0039@msn.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Hi all.&nbsp; this is a great site and I enjoy reading all the
articles and experiences here. I have written in before, and I was
reminded of an experience that happened to myself and a few other
construction workers at a job site at an old farmhouse/ log cabin we
were contracted to rehabilitate in the middle '80's<br>
&nbsp;The two story house was in between mechanicsburg and carlisle pa.
on a very overgrown plot of land and was basically abandoned for years.<br>
&nbsp; It was back a loooong dirt road that wound off the main road
that connected Mechanicsburg&nbsp; and Carlisle, and was surrounded by
trees and a lot of overgrowth, and the fields surrounding it were old
overgrown pastureland.<br>
&nbsp;On inspecting the house for the first time we found that it has
been stripped of all fixtures and woodwork and only the plaster walls
and flooring remained in the house, <br>
&nbsp;and most of the glass was broken and was laying outside on the ground. <br>
&nbsp;You could see that the first floor was an original log cabin and
the second floor was added later, and there was still some cloth
covered wiring still in place in the 1/2 basement area.<br>
&nbsp;The people that wanted us to renovate the place were from
someplace in New York and, we were told , wanted this to be a vacation
home and wanted the log cabin effect enhanced instead of covered up.<br>
&nbsp;After we looked at the blueprints, we all realized it would have
been easier and a lot less expensive to raze the place and start new
than to renovate it, but the house and 100 acres surrounding it had
been in one of the peoples' family for generations and they wanted it
kept, at least the shell, and my boss wasn't going to turn down that
kind of money regardless.<br>
&nbsp;It was getting on to late spring when we started to gut the
building, starting with the front and rear porches that were all but
impassable.<br>
&nbsp;There was an area about 1/2 way down the lane heading towards the
main road, that if you took the left branch, that you really couldn't
see coming in from the main road, went into a hidden cul-de-sac that
was just overgrown with weeds and trees, and in the center of the
cul-de-sac, was a 70 yard round center area that was completely
impassable with trees and brambles, and once headed around the curve
you couldn't see the entrance road that you had just came down&nbsp;
until you made it all the way 'round to go back out. this is where we
staged a refuse dump, at the back end of this area. We couldn't get
dumpsters in there until summer, and we didn't want the refuse at the
house in case the homeowners showed up later on.<br>
&nbsp;After we tore off the front and rear porches and built temporary
entrances and ramps, we set about gutting the place. Myself and another
guy, Bob, were assigned this job. <br>
We started upstairs in the front rooms after we made a chute system to
dump the plaster and lathe into the dump truck to haul to the dump.
After we knocked all the plaster off the walls and shoveled it into the
dump truck, we started to rip off the lathing (thin wood strips that
hold the plaster on the walls), and it was after finishing the walls
and the ceilings, we went to lunch to let the air clear of the dust so
we could inspect the framework when we got back.<br>
&nbsp;After we came back, we took flashlights in so we could see
better, and when we came into the first room, what caught our eye first
wasn't the pile of lathe, or the old hand hewn, pegged beams that we
exposed, but the crosses, all kinds of crosses, hanging, nailed every
four feet, between the joists, all the way around the room and on the
ceilings arranged in a circle at the center of the rooms. <br>
We hadn't seen them before because of all the dust flying, and Bob went
to see if the crosses were fastened to the walls( they were), and
tripped on some lathe and cut his hand pretty good.<br>
&nbsp;We went out to the truck and fixed him up, and decided not to
tell the boss until we finished the gutting, and let him get freaked
out when he saw it. The boss was a semi- devout catholic and
superstitious to boot, but he went golfing more than he went to church!<br>
&nbsp;I called a friend of mine that was into 'alternative' religions,
and a few days later after we had exposed all the interior walls, and
found literally hundreds of crosses, some of rough wood, some metal,
some plaster, some pulpit quality some just hand made, all very old and
none with Jesus hanging on them, She came out with me and basically
refused to even enter the house. Just looking in through the windows
freaked her out. <br>
&nbsp;It was an awesome and somewhat eerie sight, to say the least. <br>
&nbsp;I asked her what could be out here that they would have gone to
all that trouble to nail those crosses on the wall to keep it out (she
claimed to be psychic), and she said " I think it was to keep something
in, not out."<br>
&nbsp;Well, that was the last thing I wanted to hear, but being young
and unaware, and had a 'fear nothing' attitude, I basically ignored her
remarks and took her back to her car. Later that day the boss came out
and completely peed his pants when he saw the crosses, and was a
nervous wreck by the time we were done with the tour, because we
completely ignored the crosses and any mention of them during the tour
and showed him all the trouble spots and generally acted like we
weren't aware of the crosses. He finally freaked and asked, rather
loudly, "Don't you see all the Damn Crosses, You idiots?"<br>
&nbsp;We looked around at the room and at each other and said in unison (all planned),<br>
&nbsp;"how did they get there?"<br>
&nbsp;He just flipped out and started shaking and cursing and got the
heck out of there. Whenever he had to come to the site after that he
stayed outside. Period.<br>
&nbsp;The decision came from New York to leave the crosses in place and
build around them, so we did, and as the demolition and the digging out
of the basement progressed, some of the old farmers in the area would
come over and talk with us and find out what we were up to. One old guy
would always show up with a little girl and she would wander thru the
site while he would talk to the foreman and sometimes he would bring
lunch down to us. <br>
&nbsp;Every once in a while the girl (about 9 yrs. old) would ride up
on a rusty old bike and would talk to Bob and the foreman a lot, and
would take a rock or piece of wood from the site and ride off. <br>
&nbsp;We were about ready by fall to start roughing in the plumbing and
electric, and had run power along the road to the main located on a
pole in the front yard, so we had lights and power for the tools. The
old man and the girl showed up and as usual the girl wandered around
and picked up an old green insulator off the ground, held it up to the
sun and smiling, took it back to the truck and threw it into the trucks
front seat, and wandered off again.<br>
I saw this as I was loading trash and scraps into the dump truck to
take to the trash area And as I started the truck up to go to the dump
I noticed the girl sitting in the truck looking over the insulator
again,.<br>
&nbsp;Bob and I went to the dump area with two other laborers to off
load the truck and had made it to the other end of the cul-de-sac and
were off loading the junk, when the old man in his truck pulled up and
walked over to us and said " I wondered where you guys were dumping
this stuff."<br>
&nbsp;He then told us that this was the old dump from when the last
family that lived here, and he walked us back in the thicket and showed
us old rusted cars and appliances, cans and old bottles and old broken
furniture and such.<br>
&nbsp;As we made it back out to the truck, He reached in the truck and
pulled out a small garbage bag and I asked him where the little girl
that was with him at the site was, If she was walking home.<br>
&nbsp;He got a dumbfounded look on his face and asked me what I was
talking about, he had no kids with him and he lived in carlisle, 40
min. away.<br>
&nbsp;Bob said "the little girl that rides up with you when you come,
The little black haired girl that always talks to me. Looks like my kid
a little". The old man got pale and said "I don't have any kids of my
own much less little ones, what are you guys talking about?"<br>
&nbsp; I told him about the girl and how that morning I saw her pick up
an insulator and then as we were driving to the dump she was in the
passenger seat with the insulator looking at the sun through it as we
left.<br>
&nbsp;Now, all of us on the crew had seen this kid and most of us
talked to her, including the boss, and here was the guy that brought
her there saying he didn't know her?<br>
&nbsp;I walked over to his truck and looked around and didn't see the
insulator, and just then, we ALL heard a girl laugh, and we looked into
the center island of the cul-de-sac, and there stood the girl, holding
the green insulator. She turned and went into the bushes in the center
and we lost site of her.<br>
&nbsp;I turned to the old man and said" that kid, remember?" <br>
&nbsp;He looked as if he was going to have a heart attack and said "I
have no idea who that is, no idea, and you say she rides in with ME?"<br>
&nbsp;We all told him the same thing and then we went to look for the
girl to see where she went. It was a hard go, as everything was so
overgrown and the brambles&nbsp; tore at us every step and we finally
came upon.. Headstones. Old grey broken and leaning headstones from a
family plot. All overgrown and greenish from lichen and no sun.<br>
&nbsp;There were old wrought iron fences around two of the graves, all
rusted, and on one of the head stones inside one of these fences was
the green insulator perched on top, with a shaft of sunlight shining
right through it.<br>
Around the base of the headstone was a pile of rocks, pieces of brick
and wood chunks from the jobsite that we all had seen her walk off with
and chills just ran through me at that sight, let me tell you.<br>
&nbsp;The old man Looked wrung out, and said " I lived next to this place all my youth and never knew this was here, Good Lord!"<br>
&nbsp;We left and went back to the site and brought back all the guys
that had contact wit her and while we were all standing there we told
them about how we found the place and who we thought the girl was. You
couldn't read the inscription on the stone, but one of the carpenters
found his pocketknife he had lost a month earlier in the pile of stuff.
He left it there.<br>
&nbsp;We later brought the boss there, after we spent the next 2 days
clearing out the grave site instead of working on the house (boy was he
pissed!) and after we told him, all of us in turn, what we saw and how
the girl was always on the site and he saw the pile of stuff for
himself, he basically had a nervous breakdown, because he too had
talked to this girl several times and the weird thing was, no one, not
one of us, had ever asked her her name, not once.<br>
&nbsp; He had the owners come down to the house, and we took them
through the whole house, and after they were happy with the results so
far, The boss had them sit down and had us , one at a time, tell them
our story of the girl and the pile of stuff, and then we took them to
the family plot and showed them around.<br>
&nbsp;The land had been in the man's family forever, and so these must
have been his relatives and he was very pleased that we had cleared out
the area so he could see the site.<br>
&nbsp;Soon after, we got word that we would be shutting down the
project and that it would be finished at a later date. We weren't told
why, we just shut it down and packed up, Covered up the windows and
doors and left. We never saw the girl after we found the graves and
Truth be told, I didn't want to either.<br>
&nbsp;I have, on occasion, had to travel that way over the years and I
can't find the entrance to the house off the main road anymore or even
see where the roadway snaked around towards the house. The nearest I
can tell, the entrance must have been bulldozed or plowed shut and the
dirt road plowed under and seeded because it is all farmland again, and
you never could see the house from the road anyway.<br>
&nbsp;I know our company never finished the job, and my former boss,
when I see him, says he never heard from those people again after he
got his final check for the work we did, So Who knows?<br>
&nbsp;Hope you enjoyed it. It's all true, as much as I can recollect.<br>

Well my story begins here ,when my mum,brother and myself were on our
way to our hoilday in a small wood cabin in the forest last summer .<br>
But of course I was totally against it.I hated any kind of hoiliday that had the word FOREST in it.<br>
Well anyway when we got there by the look of the cabin I could tell it
was haunted.It had scattered pieces of wood and glass around the front
door area.<br>
I kept on telling my brother and mom that I wanted to go home because I
hated the look of&nbsp; the house,My mother just said that I should
stop complaining.<br>
When i walked inside the front door I kinda had a funny vibe like there was a presence in the house.<br>
After an hour or two the door started creaking ,I was petrifed to hear
any think because of what had happened when I first arrived.<br>
When it was dark I double checked that the doors were locked just to
make nothing else weird would happen.anyway half way through the night
I could hear sometin picking at the lock.<br>
when I woke my mum she said she too could hear sometin and that was
when I realised that there actually was a ghost in the house.<br>
well my mum and I decided that we should leave the house immediatelyI
told my my mum I will get my brother while she does the packing.<br>
When I got to my brothers room he was standing in the corner petrifed.I
asked him what was wrong and he said something white and see-through
had walked past the window .<br>
I told him that we better get out of here before something else creepy
happens.All of a sudden there was a boom boom boom on the back door.<br>
I went to my mums room and told her that we definetely have to go she
was nodding while zipping up the last suitcase.We ran to the dsoor
straight to the car ,<br>
and we vroomed out that driveway as quick as you can say BOO.When we
got home I went on the internet and looked up the catagorie GHOSTS.<br>
well about last year I found a book about ghosts and it said that they usually try to get back what writefully belongs to them<br>
So I guess that that house was his and he was trying to get it back and he succeeded.ever since I have so interested in ghosts.<br><br>

Knock<br>

my dad died, so I wanted to look at his old children room. My grandma
suggested I sleep over in his room to see if he still lives here.I did
and it was an experience I will never forget. First a few minutes after
I shut my eyes, I heard and felt bumping under the bed. Then a whisper
called my name. So I believed he was still here. But to make sure, I
asked him to knock if it was him, or knock twice if not. All of a
sudden, I heard a knock in the closet. I believed.<br>

"The Ghost in my Uncle's House"<br>
<br>
By: tylercarlson1982@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hey my name is Tyler and this is the story of my sightings of the ghost
in my uncle's house. I moved to Bend Oregon to live and work with my
uncle and I slept upstairs where nothing happened at all&nbsp; for
three months. Then my Dad and two brothers moved in also so I had to
move downstairs. Well downstairs had like it's own living room, a
bathroom and the bedroom with it's door next to the stairs. Well we
used to hear two sets of foot steps up stairs walking around when there
was no one up there. Sometimes we would think it was my brother and his
friends, but when my little brother went up there to check the door was
locked and they were still out. One night my brother fell asleep on the
couch and when he woke up he hear a very loud scream like a woman being
killed downstairs. When the scream happened our cat ran up the stairs,
hit the hardwood floors and ran right into the room under the bed. Also
right up the stairs our fridge faced the window with the oven right
infront of the friedge door. There was a magnet calendar on the freezer
door and one night while watching television me, my brother and my dad
where scared when we heard a loud bang in the kitchen and then the
calendar was thrown hard down the stairs and hit the door downstairs.
The thing about it is that there is no way that the calendar could have
went down the stairs at the angle it was. And then the thing that made
me believe in ghost was this one night. After my dad went to bed I
watched some tv and it was summer time out so it was hot so I decided
to sleep on the floor. When I was about to fall into sleep I heard a
light chuckle behind me which I thought was my dad, but when I looked
behind me there was no one there. I tried to go to sleep again and the
same thing happened and I got a little mad. Well again I was about to
fall asleep when I had the feeling that some one was looking at me.
When I opened my eyes there was a gray male figure about 6 feet and a
dark figure about 5'10 standing right next to me. And when I looked at
them they both looked&nbsp; back at me. I got so scared that I closed
my eyes and prayed that they would leave and when I opened my eyes
again they were both walking next past me. Again I closed my eyes and
when I opened them again they turned the corner and went up stairs. I
picked up my pillow and ran into my dads room. He woke up right when I
got into his room and when he asked what happened I told him and a very
shaken voice that I saw a ghost......right when that happened we both
heard two sets of foot steps right above our heads and the door opened
and closed with alot of force. After that night I believe in ghosts and
there is nothing that will ever change my mind.<br>

(my age 13[now 14])its not all that scarry but kinda freakky and
weird.1st of all my grandma has a dog,nick.well after years of having
him he was getting old and ill so we decided to put him to sleep.After
that we heard him barking and saw him running around and coming to the
back screen door looking at us and sniffing-waiting for his food-.it
was weird but quite interesting.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly,,my grandpa is a very religious guy and goes with
the bible and so on.He's mexican so when he was small he was a bit
poor..but not too bad.he had a small house with a LOOONNGG
driveway.Well one day he came home from school and saw a man on the
porch.TALL,6-8 feet he says. <br>
wearing a top hat and long coat.Glowing bright red eyes.The Devil he
says. That figure is seen again-when he's quite older-hes pulling out
of the driveway going to a Drive-In Theatre. and sees tht same figure
at <br>
the end of the driveway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarry(in my opinion) but True.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, i always c a man open my sister's window
curtain from the corner of my eye.but then goes away when to look at
it.i see that often as this..i see a shadow or man go across my door. a
ghostly shadow.<br>

Simple Yet Creepy<br>
<br>
By: purpleropes@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
This didn't happen in my house but at a friend's friend's house. <br>
Amanda and I wanted to go visit her friend Jake one evening after he
got off from his shift at Dairy Queen. The neighborhood he lives in is
kind of old and unkept and barely has any lights on the sidewalk when
it gets dark. After chatting with him out on the driveway we decided to
go inside and hang out in his room since it was now dark outside. Us
three were the only ones home besides his old smelly (but really
friendly) dog. His house alone was very creepy since there was NO
lights on which left us stumbling around and what's worse is his
parents keep a 4ft doll standing at the entrance of the hallway. While
we were being lead to his room he mentioned briefly that his house was
haunted but at the time I thought he was just pulling our leg and
trying to scare us while we were in the dark. <br>
We were all sitting on his bed with the tv on chatting about the story/characters <br>
we had been working on and I had the smelly friendly dog in my lap, half asleep <br>
from all the pets. The tv was to the right of his door and his closet was to the left, <br>
and his room had the only light in the entire house. <br>
We all stopped talking at the same time when his door started to move
on its own, shutting all by itself. It didn't close in a slow,
gradually manner and there were no drafts in the hallway or in his
room. It was as if someone walked by, stopped, and shut his door
because we were all being too loud. When we heard the door click shut,
Jake said "Ooookay.." as if he were used to it and we all continued
talking, not freaking out too much but at the same time not opening the
door again. In retrospect, I laugh at the thought of our conversation
abruptly stopping just to watch a door shut all by itself.<br>

A Ghost Under the Stairs<br>
<br>
By: nickf2@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If ghosts exist, I might have seen one. For a few years after the
event, I tried to rationalise the experience as being a product of a
minor illness that I had at the time. But the more I thought about it,
it actually led me to &#8216;rationalise&#8217; the sighting as being one of a
genuine ghost!<br>
This was about six years ago. I was aged 30 and living in a Victorian
house in London with two friends. It was roughly 3.30 in the morning
and I could not sleep due to pain and discomfort from shingles (an
adult form of chicken pox). I finished the last chapter of a book I was
reading and decided to get up and make a cup of tea.<br>
As I walked out into the passage, on the landing below me to my right,
out of the corner of my eye in the darkness I saw the outline of what
looked like a man. I must be honest and say that I don&#8217;t think I
managed to put my eyes directly on this. It happened very quickly, but
having seen this silhouette, I assumed it to be my housemate. But then
it struck me that there had not been any sound whatsoever. As I turned
to try and look properly at the figure, it appeared to quickly morph
into a small white orb, roughly the size of a cricket/baseball ball,
but not radiating any light beyond its own actual point in space. It
seemed to be coming up the stairs, but literally at the point that I
was about to properly fix my eyes on it, it did a sharp 90 degree turn
and went under the stairs below me, and out of sight.<br>
I stood there rather amazed!<br>
Although I was certain that this had happened, I could not rule out
that I was: a) probably overtired due to the lateness and not having
slept for over 24 hours; and b) I was not well. So I rationalised the
experience as being due to dust on my retina, or a product of my
sickness, or tiredness, or all three.<br>
However, I must say that although I was inevitably tired, I did not
actually feel tired. In fact, I felt perfectly awake. I&#8217;m only assuming
that I was somewhat profoundly tired having gone more than 24 hours
without sleep. Also, despite being ill, I was in perfectly good
spirits. Nor was I on medicine, booze etc. I actually felt perfectly
well mentally. In fact mentally I felt great and was enjoying a bit of
time off work!<br>
The first reason why I think that what I saw could have been a ghost is
that the random figure I saw was distinctly that of a man. Why not a
wardrobe, why not a chest of draws, why not a car or indeed any number
of infinite abstract shapes that my imagination could throw at me? <br>
Being distinctly the shape of a man I think is significant.<br>
Second, the orb that this &#8216;man&#8217; turned into appeared to be moving
exactly in the centre of the stairway and exactly at the same angle of
incline as the stairs. In other words, the thing conformed to its
physical surroundings, it was acting logically: so it was actually
there!&nbsp; It did not do anything out of the ordinary, baring its
actual existence in the first place!!!<br>
One last thought: when the orb turned to move under the stairs, could
this have been in response to my presence? Was it conscious? I like the
idea that it wanted to keep out my way - this meant I never worried
about it.<br>
Interested to hear anyone's thoughts.<br>

Animal Spirits<br>
<br>
By: FRESHISM14@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I strongly think that animal spirits roam the earth along with human spirits...<br>
One night when me and my cousins were hanging out, we decided to start
talking about how weird it is that animals can be 'ghosts' too. One
cousin reminded me of the time we were at there house about ten years
ago, when I was about 5. I remember this too. We were all playin at the
swing-set in their backyard. It was near a fence. The fence had no
holes under it or in it. Then this black cat came walking slowly
by...then it walked straight threw the fence! We all ran inside the
house screaming...lol. My cousin told me that sometimes she would go
into her room at night and hear the cat meowing--and she would see the
cat again at occasions. But thank goodness they moved!<br>
My other cousin brought up this really weird event that happened about
2 weeks ago..Her sister also saw it too. They were driving by a corner
and they saw a dead dog laying in the road. It was obviously hit
because she said she saw blood and all that other stuff on it. Then all
of the sudden a dog that looked JUSSSST like that one came out of it
and happily ran away. They said it had no scratches or anything. I
would love to witness something like that!<br>

EERIE scream...<br>
<br>

Hi, my story happened a long time ago.&nbsp; I was 17 and it was the
evening of the 1989 earthquake here in Northern California.&nbsp; I was
staying at a family friends house for the night.&nbsp; I had known them
for several years and they had always told "ghost stories" while we
would camp.&nbsp; I never knew to believe them or not, the husband's
brother had died when he was just 5 years old, he got hit by a
car.&nbsp; He said he thinks that his brother was still around, they
still lived on the same property that he grew up on.&nbsp; Anyway, to
get to the story, that evening we all went to bed.&nbsp; They had a
small house, and had me sleep in the kids room and the kids slept in
the living room.&nbsp; Everyone was turned in for the night.&nbsp; All
of a sudden the lights started flickering, the dad yelled for the kids
to stop messing around.&nbsp; It wasn't them.&nbsp; We all ended up
getting up out of bed, the lights continued to flicker and then turn
off completely.&nbsp; We turned the light switches on and
nothing.&nbsp; We looked outside and other people homes were still lit
up so it wasn't a power outage.&nbsp; I just figured with the
earthquake and all who knows, I wasn't that scared at the time.&nbsp;
We all went back to bed and giggled a little and made a few jokes about
the "ghost".&nbsp; I lied back down and before long the lights started
up again and then the drawers in the bathroom started opening and
closing, slamming hard.&nbsp; At this point I was scared!&nbsp; I ran
into the master bedroom and told them I wasn't sleeping by
myself.&nbsp; I thought I would sleep on the floor at the foot of the
bed.&nbsp; We were all a little scared.&nbsp; All of a sudden&nbsp; the
most horrible inhuman sound came.&nbsp; Like I said it was a small
house.&nbsp; It sounded like the home had surround sound, it came from
every corner of the house.&nbsp; This loud guttural scream/moan.&nbsp;
It was a long moment and then it all stopped.&nbsp; I sat there and
cried.&nbsp; I didn't sleep a wink that night.&nbsp; I couldn't wait to
get out of there.&nbsp; I told them in the morning that I would never
be back to there home.&nbsp; I felt that whatever it was didn't like an
outsider in the home.&nbsp; I look back on that night and wonder about
it.&nbsp; I lost contact with the family, it has been close to 20 years
now.&nbsp; At the time it made me a firm believer in the
paranormal.&nbsp; Now as I get older and more skeptical I can't help
but wonder if it was some kind of joke.&nbsp; I don't see how.&nbsp; At
the time I don't even think there was such a thing as surround
sound!&nbsp; And that is the only way that sound could have came from
the house.&nbsp; It was as if the house itself was screaming.&nbsp;
That is the only "paranormal" experience that I have ever had.&nbsp;
Just thought I would share it.&nbsp; Thanks!<br>

Hi, I have a story to share about a night at the Baja Inn/Country Club
hotel in Tijauan,Mexico. I've been staying at this hotel about twice a
year since I was 4 years old because we often go to Tijuana either on
our way to Rosarito/Ensenada or to have a cheaper doctor/dentist
appointment. About April of this year we were staying in a different
part of the hotel with larger rooms because my grandmother was also
with us so we needed the two larger beds to accomodate my parents my
grandmother my sister and me. I opted to sleep on the floor because I'm
wierd and get reallyuncomfortable when people are to close to me. I was
having a hard time sleeping, kind of going in and out of what felt like
10 minute intervals of light sleep. It was during one of my long
periods of stareing at the wall that I began to hear what sounded like
a small dog walking on the wood floor of the mini kitchen area of the
room and I felt a little like something was standing near me, I decided
that I really didn't feel like freaking out about ghosts right now
because I was tired and feeling slightly nausios (excuse my momentary
lapse in spelling) from something I had eaten that evening so I decided
to just call it roaches. This might have made everything better if the
sound hadn't then moved from the wooden kitchen floor to the carpet....
I could then clearly hear small feet walking near the bottom of the bed
farthest from me and kind of pacing a small circle around the room I
still didn't want to pay much attention as I was feeling bad and really
wanted to get soem sleep but of course it then started coming closer to
me it was pacing about three feet from my feet when I decided to just
suck it up and go sleep with my parents. Later that morning I explained
to my family what brought about my sudden change of heart about
sleeping in a bed and my mom told me that she had heard a childish
voice near my head say "ven a jugar con migo" which means 'come play
with me' that sounds very cliche I know but it's what she told me. I'd
never had any strange experiences at that hotel before and hadn't
really been looking for one but it's definitely making me think twice
about ever sleeping ont he floor again =P<br>
