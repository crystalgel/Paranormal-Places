<br><b>My Real Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TrumpSwordz@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've decided to share real encounters I had when I was at a very
young age,</b>
<br><b>maybe around six, seven, or eight, and then later on, during adolesence,
to</b>
<br><b>the present. It's not as exciting or fantastic as some of the other</b>
<br><b>contributions on your site (which is wonderful, by the way) but
its the</b>
<br><b>truth, and I need to get it told before the whole story slips my
memory...</b>
<br><b>1993-1995&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really remember much else about that
night. I was around</b>
<br><b>six, seven, or eight years old, and I was sitting on the sofa, watching</b>
<br><b>television. My father works nights, so he was gone, and my mother
was in the</b>
<br><b>garage, doing something. Well, quite suddenly, I became cold. It
wasn't the</b>
<br><b>fact that my mother had opened the garage door or anything, because
the</b>
<br><b>garage and living room were on opposite sides of the house. So,
using my</b>
<br><b>pre-adolescent ingenuity, I got up to turn on a light. Somehow,
I thought</b>
<br><b>doing so would make the room warmer. Go figure. Anyway, while reaching
to</b>
<br><b>turn on the light, I glanced over, and saw woman standing in our
den, looking</b>
<br><b>into the mirror there. She was leaning over, as if she was checking
something</b>
<br><b>on her face, or maybe applying makeup. She somehow looked faded,
and her</b>
<br><b>features all blended together. Maybe it wasn't like that at the
time, but its</b>
<br><b>the best I can remember. As luck would have it, before I could say
or do</b>
<br><b>anything, my mom opened the garage door, and called to me, wanting
me to go</b>
<br><b>do something, probaby a chore. When Ilooked back at the den, she
had</b>
<br><b>vanished. I never did find out what it was. Your guess is as good
as mine.</b>
<br><b>1996-1998&nbsp;&nbsp; After moving to our new house, (from Missouri
to Indiana,) we</b>
<br><b>began to expirience what I've concluded as to be poltergeist activity.
In our</b>
<br><b>backyard were two very heavy patio chairs, each weighing anywhere
from</b>
<br><b>fifteen to twenty pounds. Well, for a period of about a month, almost
every</b>
<br><b>morning we would find both chairs pushed all the way to the back
of our yard,</b>
<br><b>so that they were leaning against our fence. I can't think of anything
else</b>
<br><b>that would have caused it. No one I know would have done a prank
so stupid,</b>
<br><b>my dog wouldn't and probably couldn't, and the wind simply wouldn't
be strong</b>
<br><b>enough to push them that far -- besides, why were they both still
upright?</b>
<br><b>1999 - Present Day&nbsp; I can't explain it, perhaps its just paranoia,
but every</b>
<br><b>time I'm alone,&nbsp; I swear I feel like I'm being watched. And
still, maybe its</b>
<br><b>paranoia, but sometimes I swear I can hear voices. They're quiet,
and I can't</b>
<br><b>figure out what they're saying, but I do hear them. And no, the</b>
<br><b>radio/television isnt on, as my parents have suggested.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for reading! I'm a big fan of Shadowlands!!</b>

<p><b>Unexplained Presence</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: melefab@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a corner house that is located near the cemetery
strip in Colma, California. This house used to be occupied by some of our
relatives, but they were not the first people to live there. There have
been different owners of that house. When they first moved in everything
seemed normal, but after a few months or so everyone started to experience
strange occurences.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; According to their statements, it started with dishes
moving across tables, counters opening by themselves, doors slamming in
the middle of the night, and cold gusts of air even though there were no
windows or doors open. There were other times when they would be watching
t.v. and the channels would change or the t.v. would turn on by itself
late at night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Other skeptical relatives wanted to check it out for
themselves so two of our cousins decided to spend a few nights at the house
just the two of them. There was an incident when one of them was up late
at night reciting poetry and when he was about to fall asleep he felt an
icy caress upon his cheek. On a different occasion both of them went downstairs
to check out the garage/basement since the occupants described that part
of the house as particularly creepy. According to them, when they go down
there they always feel some sort of prescence or like somenone is watching
them. While my cousins were inspecting the garage/basement, they opened
the door to the boiler room, looked inside briefly then shut the door and
as they stepped away they suddenly saw the door knob turn and shake as
if someone was trying to get out. They got soo scared and frightened so
they ran up the stairs and out of the basement as fast as they could. Other
strange things have happened to them while they spent the night there and
after there experiences in that house they are definitely no longer skeptical,
but totally believe there is something there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; It got to the point where my relatives were too scared to
live in their own home. They became desperate and didn't know who to turn
to so they sought religious help. They asked another cousin who was a deacon
to see what he could do. Since he was only a deacon and didn't have much
experience in these matters, he brought along two other priests from his
church. They went from room to room praying or trying to exorcise whatever
was there. They stated that as they went from room to room they felt cold
gusts of air pass by and a very strong prescence, especially in the garage.
While they were praying in the that area a black or dark mist rose up from
out of no where and just hovered there. They kept reciting their prayers
over and over and the mist or whatever it was vanished.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, blessing the house didn't help and eventually
our relatives moved out since the hauntings or whatever you want to call
it did not stop. Our relatives later told us that there are new occupants
of that house and we wonder if they are also experiencing strange occurences.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Strange but True</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bossk@peoplepc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Steve and i'm from Cleveland Ohio. Everything that i tell
you is absolutely true. It all started</b>
<br><b>when I was 18 yrs. of age. If I did not see half of it myselef I
would mot believe it. My friends and I found</b>
<br><b>the paranormal very facsinating. We had no ghosts living in our
homes so we went out looking for them.</b>
<br><b>We would ask ourselves " where do we find ghosts"?? We all heard
rumors about places out side of town,</b>
<br><b>but most of them were a hoax!&nbsp; A friend of mine was in Sandusky
for the weekend near lake Erie with family.</b>
<br><b>He had met somebody out there at the camp grounds and they began
talking about ghosts and the person</b>
<br><b>he met told him about this house in Vermillion that is most definitly
haunted. It has been abandoned for years.</b>
<br><b>John was all excited to come back home to tell us all what he had
learned! The day he came home is the same</b>
<br><b>night we all made way to this house in Vermillion. It took us a
little over an hour to reach our destination. The per-</b>
<br><b>son john met had given him pefect directions! There were a total
of 13 of us that evening and when we had finally found the place all of
us were quiet. You could feel it! We all new we should never of went there.
The house stood back from the street a little way. It was hard to find
at first with all of the trees and brush that grew over the house. Most
windows were missing and the house had a slight lean. There was a grand
piano sticking half way in &amp;out of the house. The gravel driveway could
not be seen anymore (grass was 3 feet tall).We parked the cars in the street
a little ways down and made way to the house. We stood outside for abuot
20 min. when we all decided to go inside. I knew it was not a good idea
and i followed anyway.</b>
<br><b>We entered in through the back right above the cellar doors that
lead into the basement. I think we were standing in what once was the kitchen.
We walked down a small hallway into the living room. there was a firplace
a broken chair and writing all over the wall writen in a forien languge
you could see the other half of the piano all of the strings were sticking
out. There was a pentagram painted perfect on the floor with candles at
each of the 5 points. I wanted to leave. It was all still very quiet when
a loud thud came from underneath us from the basement. We all jumped at
least a foot high. Another friend of ours Brian We called him loony, was
sort of crazy wanted to investigate. There was only one way into the basement
and that was outside (the pantry doors) and they were still shut!! We all
got scared and left!! The next day it was all we could talk about!! Ithought
i would never go back. Two friend of ours who were there that night were
in photography class in college had a project. Well they decided to shoot
the house! Of course I went and there was only 5 of us this time!! The
sun was setting and was almost dusk when we arrive, the house was as sick
as ever!! They had all of their equipment set up in a matter of minutes
and went to take the first picture when the flash did not work!! So Sean
went to use his camera when his flash did not work either. They messed
around with their camers for about 20 minutes before they gave up. They
thought there was something wrong with the battery packs so we packed up
and left. We got about a quarter of a mile down the road when the flashes
started to work. There still was enough day light so we turned around.
They took their cameras out again and the flashed did not wirk again!!
Now we were all freaking out so we left again!! We got to the same place
in the road where the flashes worked when they started to work again so
like fools we turned one last time. We got about 50 yards away from the
house when the flashes started to go off by themselfes!! We heard the same
loud thud come from inside the house and we booked! While we were running
my buddy was shooting pics. That night we went into his darkroom and developed
7 pics.</b>
<br><b>the rest did not come out. At first it seemed like they were just
cools pictures if the house when John looked closer at one of the pics.
and noticed a long face smiling down at us from one of the windows!! It
definitly was not a mask because you could see through to the other side!!
It had long pointy ears A wide smile glowing beaty eyes and a stubby nose.
This was all real!!! We showed everybody the picture and with in days rumors
started to fly around about us be devil worshipers. Some people were curious
and wanted to come with us!! One day we decided to go there again. This
time there was more of us. Walking up the drive way was sary enough when
we all seen shadows moving inside the house spooked us out even more!!
Right away a buddy got sick a threw up. At one time the moon was white
but now redish-orange. Everything about the house was wrong!! I don't know
how but we found courage to enter again. We explored every room hearing
the same noises every wehere we went. You could definitly see shadows moving
from one corner to the other. I felt like I was watching a horror movie
And I was the star!! I left the house first and many followed! When we
all grouped up every one was really scares and it was a good time to leave!!
I know what I seen was real and I still talk about it to this day!! The
place still haunts some of us and we don't even visit no more!! My best
friends brother still travels there in his dreams and outerbody experiences.
Like I was saying we explored every room in the house except for the attic.
We could not get in, it was sealed shut!! But my friends brother would
travel there out of his body. Along the way in his hazy dream he met a
soul named mike. Mike led him to the attic of the house where he confronted
a demon. The same deomon in the picture! Scott (buddy's brother) Told us
all he lost his soul to this demon and would never get it back!! It is
wierd that a couple of experinces can change one's life. Now Scott is into
crystals and that sort of thing. He belives he can read others minds!!
To this day he traveles back to the house,for what I don't know. One day
Scott was in his mom&amp;dad's living room talking to this Mike when his
mom heard him talking and no one was there! She got all worried and went
to find help! There was a psychic around the corner from our homes and
they went there. The lady was taking care of a client in the back when
they walked in and as soon as they sat down the lady came immediatly out
and asked Scott to leave! Some how she knew there was an evil presence
with him. They tried a psychiatrist but still no help. We still were curous
about the house though. We had no explanation. Six of us went to the Vermillion
Library And found out a lot of sick information about the house!! We learned
that the kelm's were the only owners of the home and was abbandoned in
the earky 20's. We found a small article that read something like the family
adopted alot of children into there family and the MR. abused molested
and killed most of the children in that house!!</b>

<br><b>The Unexplained!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bahowey@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a small sized Indian gaming casino in the mid-west,
strange things happen that are not readily explained.&nbsp; The only ‘logical’
explanation is super natural doings.&nbsp; Things have been happening for
a long time.&nbsp; Some people see things or hear things; other people
hear or feel things.&nbsp; The occurrence is not limited to any one area
of the casino.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Voices are heard in certain areas, calling a person’s name.&nbsp;
The individual will hear his or her name called but there is no one there
that called the name.&nbsp; The individual will look around and eventually
continue on about their business.&nbsp; This is noticed in the lounge area
and the elevator area.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Human like or partial humans will be observed in different
areas.&nbsp; Sometimes the image will be standing other times the image
will be moving.&nbsp; The image can look like a person, a dark shadow or
sometimes a light colored shadow.&nbsp; One example; on a New Year’s Eve
drinks were being collected by a lounge waitress and a security officer.&nbsp;
The pair decided to take the elevator to the second floor instead of using
the stair.&nbsp; As the pair approached the elevator, a person was observed
inside the elevator standing there as the doors were closing.&nbsp; The
waitress ran ahead to catch and hold the elevator.&nbsp; The officer coming
up from behind observed the person leaning on a cane, as the door closed.&nbsp;
The waitress hit the door button and the elevator doors opened and the
waitress entered and held the door.&nbsp; The officer arrived and asked
where the person was.&nbsp; The waitress advised that when she entered
the elevator it was empty.&nbsp; The officer advised that the door were
closed and then started to open and the figure was still standing there.&nbsp;
There is no logical explanation to what happened to the elderly person
in the blue windbreaker leaning on the cane.&nbsp; Needless to say, the
waitress would not take the elevator back to the main floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The casino was remodeled during the last couple
of years.&nbsp; After the remodeling, several other incidents have been
witnessed.&nbsp; In the Security Office, which was once a change booth
and then a check-cashing booth, is a door that will not stay open without
coasting shut?&nbsp; The only time the door does not coast shut is when
there is shadows or the sounds of someone moving around in the weapons
locker.&nbsp; At different times, a dark shadow has been seen entering
or moving about in the locker.&nbsp; The chair to the Captain of Security’s
desk will move and squeak as if someone is sitting in the chair.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the high limit slot area, a man has been observed
sitting by a machine.&nbsp; Later, the same man is observed either entering
or leaving the casino.&nbsp; Surveillance cameras show an officer talking
to an empty chair; the officer when asked advised that there is a man sitting
there that spoke with him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous times voices have been
heard in the same area.&nbsp; Laughing and the sound of a slot machine
being played and coins dropping into the tray, and the officer posted in
the area hears their name called to come and join them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; A ladies restroom on the second floor will have the door
locked and the sound of a toilet flushing can be heard or the sound of
a crying person.&nbsp; When the room is checked, there is nothing there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The elevator has been observed going to the second floor
and the doors opening.&nbsp; Then the lights come on as if the buttons
had been pushed and the elevator will descend to the main floor.&nbsp;
The doors will open before returning to the second floor and the doors
opening again.&nbsp; The doors will then stay open for awhile, the doors
will close and then the elevator will return to the main floor.&nbsp; There
is no one around the elevator area, first or second floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gift shop area, the sound of cups clinking together
can be heard.&nbsp; A rack of cigarettes will suddenly move forward and
then will crash to the floor.&nbsp; A waste receptacle lid will sway back
and forth or spin completely around with no one near it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the catwalk, a shadow or a person will be seen standing
and waving at people or moving from one end of the catwalk to the other.&nbsp;
Sometimes disappearing into a locked area.&nbsp; The majority of the ‘sightings’
occur on the grave or late shift.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Some people will talk about what they have seen or see, while
others will not.&nbsp; There have been a couple of people that have died
in the casino in the last few years.&nbsp; When the casino was built, human
remains were found doing digging of the footings.&nbsp; A reasonable explanation
is welcome, if there is none.&nbsp; Then the people that believe and or
see the happenings will continue to believe in GHOSTS.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Storm Footsteps!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: girl_on_fire@gurlmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; My mom and dad had gone out for their 11th aniversery.This
is when my two older</b>
<br><b>sisters used to live at home.Me and my other younger sister wanted
to watch a movie.We</b>
<br><b>were getting a little scares because it started to storm.When we
watched</b>
<br><b>about a quarter of the movie the lights went out.And I was about
10yrs old then so all</b>
<br><b>I did was curl up in a little ball and try to hide.Then we heard
our two older sisters</b>
<br><b>say,hey you guys come up here with us if your scared.So me and my
sister tried to</b>
<br><b>find our way through the pitch black darkness to get to the stairway.Finally
we saw</b>
<br><b>a light and it was one of our sister's candles lit.So we got upstairs
in their room.One</b>
<br><b>of my sisters and my youngest sister were in the corner on the bed
away from the</b>
<br><b>door.Me and my other oldest sister were kindof&nbsp; by the door
playing a game called</b>
<br><b>20 questions.All of a sudden me and my other sister heard these
footsteps coming</b>
<br><b>up the steps.Then we were like,hey you guys do you hear something?They
both said,</b>
<br><b>no,what are you talking about!!It seemed like the footsteps were
just in one place,so</b>
<br><b>we finally told my other two sisters to quick come over there to
listen.But no,they</b>
<br><b>didn't hear a thing.Here's another thing,when me and my other older
sister were</b>
<br><b>younger we both saw what we call,the devil of my dad.I was not born
yet when she</b>
<br><b>saw it.Then when I was the same age as she was when she saw it,I
saw it too,the</b>
<br><b>same thing,that devil.Knowone else in our family saw it.So thats
what we think we</b>
<br><b>heard,the devil coming up the stairs.And thats why WE only heard
it,cause nobody</b>
<br><b>saw it when they were younger.So my other sister that heard it grabed
her metal bat,</b>
<br><b>opened the door and swung but there was not anyone there.So we all
gathered up,</b>
<br><b>(cause we got out other sisters scared by telling them we heard
footsteps) and went</b>
<br><b>downstairs.And then,my mom and dad pulled in,when they came in we
were like,</b>
<br><b>thank god you guys are home,we heard footsteps!!!Of course out parents
didn't</b>
<br><b>believe a word we were saying.So my dad tried to calm us down.And
this is why I</b>
<br><b>am TERRIFIED of storms.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Severed Arm</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: susan_h@postoffice.pacbell.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thanks for your site. I am really enjoying it!! I do have one</b>
<br><b>experience to share with you...</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was about three weeks before my wedding. I was trying to take
a</b>
<br><b>nap in the bedroom I shared with my fiance. It was early evening,
so</b>
<br><b>it wasn't too dark yet.&nbsp; I had my eyes open, and something
caught my</b>
<br><b>eye above the bed. It looked like an opaque arm, severed below the</b>
<br><b>elbow. In its hand, it was holding a long stemmed rose. The entire</b>
<br><b>image was opaque--I couldn't make out any color.&nbsp; But, the
image</b>
<br><b>glowed brightly. It descended from near the ceiling, and placed
the</b>
<br><b>rose on the pillow next to my head. I had never seen a ghost, or
any</b>
<br><b>vision before, so I wasn't sure if this was real. I immediately&nbsp;
ran</b>
<br><b>out of the room, telling my fiance what had happened. He ran to
the</b>
<br><b>bedroom, and got a flashlight. He looked in the closet, under the</b>
<br><b>bed, out the window, etc. I thought it was funny that he was looking</b>
<br><b>rationally for something which was irrational. Three days later
my</b>
<br><b>mother died.</b>

<p><b>The Passenger</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sydlen@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to share a story that has been haunting me for over
15 years</b>
<br><b>and I would really like to get some sort of explanation or any kind
of</b>
<br><b>feedback to this experience...</b>
<br><b>I was 18 at the time, it was midsummer and early in the afternoon.
I was</b>
<br><b>driving my Volvo singing to myself on my way to a party. Taking
a shortcut</b>
<br><b>thru a very rural and wooded area.</b>
<br><b>Out of nowhere came this feeling of a passenger right behind me
in the</b>
<br><b>backseat, it felt so close as it was almost breathing down my neck
and it</b>
<br><b>was EVIL. I have had my share of meeting ghosts and other stuff
but this was</b>
<br><b>nothing close to it, this was something very different and so scary
I was</b>
<br><b>certain my life was in danger. The air was so thick I couln't breathe
and</b>
<br><b>not for all the money in the world I could have looked in the review
mirror</b>
<br><b>to see what was in the back seat.</b>
<br><b>This maybe lasted for about 2-3 minutes and then it was all gone
- just like</b>
<br><b>that. I have never ever been so scared in my life as during those
2 minutes</b>
<br><b>and I have no explanation to it. Been up and down that road 100
of times</b>
<br><b>since then but never picked up another passenger. I always had an
uneasy</b>
<br><b>feeling around that place since, but not exactly sure if it's just
me or if</b>
<br><b>it is the place itself. Gives me the creeps just to think about
it.</b>
<br><b>Anyone out there had an experience like this??</b>

<p><b>The Party in My Attic</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: elizabeth_m_singer@loveable.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>One summer when I was about 11 or 12 years old, my parents, my little
sister, 2 of my older sisters and myself moved into this old gray house
in Northern Indiana.&nbsp; It had a cement sidewalk that went around to
the back of the house and at the back be the door there was a date and
2 foot prints and a hand print.&nbsp; The date was about 1810 if I remember
correctly.&nbsp; It has been at least 10 years since this has happend.&nbsp;
Anyway, right before we moved in my 2 older sisters wanted to stay the
night at the house.&nbsp; So they did.&nbsp; They felt real uneasy after
being there for a while.&nbsp; They sat on the floor back to back wishing
they hadn't done this.&nbsp; All of the sudden they heard a loud banging
noise coming from the basement.&nbsp; They&nbsp; called the police from
the neighbors house.&nbsp; After the police checked everything out and
found nothing they left.&nbsp; Once again, my sisters, still scared out
of their mind sat on the floor.&nbsp; They heard it again.&nbsp; So once
again they called the police.&nbsp; They showed up and stuck around a while
to see if maybe they could hear it.&nbsp; About 15 minutes or so later
they heard it.&nbsp; One of the police officers told them that it was just
the old furnace in the basement making noises.&nbsp; My sisters had a good
laugh and finally drifted off to sleep.&nbsp; When we were finally moved
in and settled down I wanted to really check the place out.&nbsp; In my
room there was a walk-in closet about 12 feet in length and on the left
right inside the door was a smaller door that we assumed led to the attic.&nbsp;
I felt very odd everytime I had to go to the closet.&nbsp; One night my
little sister decided that she was going to sleep in my bed with me.&nbsp;
Of course being the brave sister I was I picked up my little book of ghost
stories and began to read a story entitled 'Phone Calls From A Ghost'.&nbsp;
All of the sudden, the light in the hall way began to flicker, it was the
light we were using to read the book by.&nbsp; We got scared and I threw
the book out my bedroom door.&nbsp; We laid there talking wondering what
caused that to happen when we began to hear music and lots of voices coming
from the attic.&nbsp; I could hear a child running around and laughing
also but my sister says she didn't hear that.&nbsp; We decided to go downstair
and sleep in her room that night.&nbsp; A few weeks go by and 1 of my older
sisters bought a Ouija Board.&nbsp; My mom didn't like the idea of it being
in her house because her mother always told her they were of the devil.&nbsp;
But, being a little curious herself we all sat down and watch as my mother
and older sister began to play the 'game'.&nbsp; The spirit in the board
said his name was Gule. I'm not sure who it would be pronounced but I remember
how it was spelled.&nbsp; We asked it some silly questions and then my
mom asked it a more serious question about if one of us was going to die,
when, and how.&nbsp; The board told her something, she wouldn't tell us,
then she got really mad at this spirit and began calling it names. The
little device that you put your hands on began moving around the board
really fast in a figure 8 patter, no one was&nbsp; touching.&nbsp; Then
it flew off the board and sail across the front room into the dining room.&nbsp;
My mom told my sister to get it out of her house and never mention anything
about what had happend.&nbsp; But, she didn't take it out.&nbsp; She just
put it in the closet in my room.&nbsp; One night, me and my little sister
deiced that we were going to be gypsies.&nbsp; So we got our crystal ball
which was nothing more then an electric candle with a blue bulb, and sat
in the play room and turned off all the lights.&nbsp; My mom was the only
one home and she was down stairs.&nbsp; We sat next to the candle and began
chanting "Oh spirits, if you are here give us a sign."&nbsp; "We want to
know who you really are, and why your here"&nbsp; Over and over we chanted.&nbsp;
Just then, I felt this cold chill.&nbsp; the window were closed and it
was mid-summer.&nbsp; The bulb in the candle flashed and then went out
and I heard someone whisper, "I'm here".&nbsp; It sounded like a child's
voice.&nbsp; Then the hall light flashed twice and then stayed on for about
5 or 10 seconds and went out.&nbsp; My sister and I ran down the stairs,
across the dining room and into the front room to where my mother was sitting
reading a book.&nbsp; We asked her if she flashed the lights just now and
she said now.&nbsp; See, my mom can't walk very well, she can't run or
walk fast either.&nbsp; So she wouldn't have been able to get to the stair
well, flash the lights, and get back to her seat in time before we made
it down the stairs.&nbsp; She didn't even notice the lights flash.&nbsp;
Needless to say we didn't go back upstairs.&nbsp; The next weekend I stay
with my friend Robin.&nbsp; I didn't say anything about what was going
on in our house.&nbsp; My mom and little sister were home alone.&nbsp;
During the night my sister woke up because she heard a woman scream. She
ran to moms room and woke her up and told her. Mom called the police.&nbsp;
They showed up, checked everything out, nothing. After my mom got her calmed
down and they both fell asleep my sister heard the screaming again.&nbsp;
So, once again mom called the police.&nbsp; They still didn't find anything.&nbsp;
I wanted to find out why all this stuff was happening so I began to ask
around.&nbsp; A few of the neighbor hood kids got together and helped me
find out.&nbsp; Of course they thought my sister and I were crazy.&nbsp;
Then my friend Erin talked to the lady at the library.&nbsp; She told Erin
what happend and then Erin came to my house to tell me.&nbsp; We were standing
outside the house on the side where my room is below the window in my walk-in
closet.&nbsp; She told me that there was a mom, dad, and child who lived
here a long time ago.&nbsp; One evening after school the little boy was
up in his room, (which was the same room I had at the time).&nbsp; The
mom was standing in the hall talking to him when the dad came home.&nbsp;
He was drunk and told her tom come down.&nbsp; She looked at the boy and
told him not to come down.&nbsp; He could here his mom and dad yelling
and then all the sudden he heard his mom scream and she just kept screaming.&nbsp;
He ran down the stair and into the kitchen.&nbsp; There was blood everywhere.&nbsp;
And his dad was still stabbing her in the chest and stomach. He turned
to the boy and siad you're next.&nbsp; He ran up the stairs and locked
himself in the attic.&nbsp; The dad took the mothers body and went down
to the basement.&nbsp; In the basement there was a little cubby hole in
the wall.&nbsp; Inside that hole was another hole.&nbsp; He put her in
the second cubby hole and went after the boy.&nbsp; He kicked the attic
door open and when he found the boy he began stabbing him a little at a
time just enough to make him bleed a little.&nbsp; The neighbors heard
the boys screams and called the police.&nbsp; The dad took the boy, still
screaming, and went down to the basement and climbed into the 2nd little
cubby hole and finished killing the boy.&nbsp; He then took his own life.&nbsp;
After Erin finished telling me the story I looked up at my window and it
was like I was looking at a family photo.&nbsp; I could see the mom, dad
and boy looking down at me.&nbsp; She was wearing a whitish sweater, the
dad was wearing over all and a plaid shirt, and the boy was wearing a pair
of overalls and a plain t-shirt.&nbsp; They looked happy.&nbsp; Then I
looked at Erin who didn't seem to notice them and I looked back and they
were gone.&nbsp; After everyone went home and I could sit and tell my mom
about it, who didn't believe me anyway, I began putting things together.&nbsp;
The childs voice in the attic, the woman screaming, the banging in the
basement.&nbsp; I know it couldn't of been the furnace, it was the middle
of summer and there wasn't a need for the furnace to be on so it wasn't
in use.&nbsp; I still had little visits from the family but nothing as
bad or as horible as what they went through when they were alive.</b>

<p><b>The Old Farm</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: andrew110@bigpond.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to share an experience that happened in our old Farm
house about 10 years ago. The house has had a history of strange goings
on the earliest noted in the 1940's an old lady who lived on the place
fell down the back stairs and died before she was found . A friend of Dads
Dooly Collins was only a boy at the time and used to do a bit of odd work
at the place came out to visit and seen old Mrs Richards was waving at
him from the house gate as he entered the gate at the front paddock then
turned and went inside at this time she had been gone for about a week.Dad
bought the Farm in 1961 the house always has had a happy homely feeling
about it and no one in our immediate family experienced any thing. A couple
of years after moving in I was born and my cousin Bill was out helping
Dad out and sleeping in the same room my cot was in awoke to see a little
old Lady with a bonnet on leaning over my cot looking at me I was born
in 1962 Bill would have been about 17 at the time and still wont sleep
in the house to this day .Another time Dads sister Aunty Aileen was visiting
and was sleeping in the same room in the early 80's an awoke with a heavy
weight pushing on her chest and tried to yell out but couldn't and was
very shaken by the experience there were children in the room again at
this time also. My first and only odd experience happened in 1990 it was
Halloween eave Ravenswood always has a Dance on this time every year and
people from all around the district attend as its a good old time Dance.
We had a house full of guests our cousins Tommy and Elaine from Normanton
and their kids , Ernie and Bev from Homehill and my cousin John and his
Girl friend Karen from Ayr . I usually like to go to the dance but our
Daughter Elsie was only 4 months old so we decided to stay home and baby-sit
toms kids so they could have a night out free of kids.John and Karen decided
to stay home as well with Dianne and myself and play cards .We had put
the children to bed Elsie and Toms Kids were in separate rooms with a door
adjoining the rooms we were talking and playing cards downstairs when we
heard footsteps going from one room to the other as the rooms are directly
above the kitchen which has no ceiling the footsteps were as plain as day
at first I thought the dogs are in the house as we were all downstairs
John and I went to investigate but found the doors closed on checking the
children we found them all asleep it was then I remembered I had put a
cupboard in front of the door in the adjoining rooms to give tom and Elaine
a bit more privacy so nobody could have walked between the rooms.We went
back downstairs and were laughing about ghosts when the footsteps sounded
again John looked at me and I looked at him then grabbed the torch to investigate
again but found nothing the rest of the night passed without any other
incidents I firmly believe in ghosts now .We still own the old place although
I don't live there any more as I left to find work and better schooling
for our children my brother still lives there with his family and we visit
often and the place still has a friendly feel about it but my hair still
stands up when I remember that night.</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>It was about midnight. The room was pitch balck, and in the moonlight
I saw a very tall thing. It had on a brown cloak, and pointed to the window.
I was not scared, but as I was about to freak, it turned and ran through
the bedroom door. I was shocked. I only saw it twice, and have never seen
it since.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Well, im 26 years old, and have a trailer out at Redberry Lake, but
in order</b>
<br><b>to get there you have to turn off the highway and drive down an

<br><b>country road that hardly anyone uses.&nbsp; Its about a 30min drive
and about</b>
<br><b>15min into the drive, I passed what looked like a little boy standing
on the</b>

and looked</b>
<br><b>back but there was nobody there, so I figured it must have been
a stump or</b>
<br><b>something so I started on my way, then about 2 seconds later a really
white</b>

infront of</b>

in an</b>

but the car</b>

<br><b>then the deer just ran into the bush.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day I

<br><b>The Jockey</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bogonmoth@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story was told to me by my mother.</b>
<br><b>She works at a nursing home in the Blue Mountains, Australia.</b>
<br><b>For some reason a few days before the death of a resident, a man
in black</b>
<br><b>appears.</b>
<br><b>Early one morning while my mother was doing her shift, she was on
her way to</b>
<br><b>the pan room when she saw it for the first time. She said it was
about 4ft</b>
<br><b>tall, and was wearing a bowlers hat. He was dressed in black and
had no</b>
<br><b>features.The figure was sitting in a chair. My mother thought she
was seeing</b>
<br><b>things, and paid no attention to this. On her way back from the
pan room,</b>
<br><b>the figure was still there! This really freaked her out so she went</b>
<br><b>downstairs and told the head nurse. The nurse told my mother that
this</b>
<br><b>figure was always seen a few days before someone passed away, and
they had</b>
<br><b>named it "The Jockey" because of it's size. She said she had no
explanation</b>
<br><b>as to what it was, and that some of the other workers had also seen
it.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks after this, my mother was going about her normal duties
when she</b>
<br><b>saw this figure again. This time it was standing beside a wardrobe
in one of</b>
<br><b>the resident's rooms. It so happens that the room the figure appeared
in,</b>
<br><b>was of a lady who was sick with cancer. Surely enough, a few days
after</b>
<br><b>this, the lady passed away.</b>
<br><b>Over the past two years, this figure has been seen a number of times
by</b>
<br><b>different workers, with someone passing away after it is seen.</b>
<br><b>A friend of my mums who works there, told her one night while he
was doing</b>
<br><b>his shift, he saw the jockey standing at the sink washing it's hands!
He</b>
<br><b>stood there for a few minutes and watched it, then it disappeared.</b>
<br><b>The nursing home was built in the 1850's and it's believed to have
been a</b>
<br><b>hospital before this. Mum said that the second floor of the home
also has</b>
<br><b>some sort of entity there, and some of the nurses refuse to work
up there at</b>
<br><b>night.</b>

<p><b>Very Scarey</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mosie@pivot.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Maureen .&nbsp; I live in ME with my husband and three
children, all boys, Zachary, Jonah and Elijah.&nbsp; My husband and I married
in 1991 and in 1993 we decided to buy a home.&nbsp; I never shared with
my husband that I was "sensitive", that I sometimes "saw", "felt" or "heard"
things that others did not.&nbsp; Not until 1993 that is.&nbsp; We first
looked at an absolutely beautiful farmhouse.&nbsp; It was wonderful but
you couldn't have paid me any amount of money to live there.&nbsp; When
I first looked at the house, even before getting out of the car, I "knew"
there was more to this house than what could be seen.&nbsp; We went inside,
looked around and although both my husband and I loved it, we chose not
to buy it for a number of reasons.&nbsp; My number one reason though was
because whatever was there, which was unseen, was evil.&nbsp; You, rather
I, could feel it.&nbsp; My husband, who is quite a skeptic regarding the
supernatural even said to me, before I said anything to him, that the house
seemed to have spirits that weren't going to welcome anyone.&nbsp; I then
told my husband not only my take on the house itself, but how I've always
"been".&nbsp; Needless to say, he wasn't impressed and he was a little
"freaked out".&nbsp; Regardless, we soon looked at another home.&nbsp;
We walked in and we just fell in love with it.&nbsp; I also, once again,
"felt" that something was in this house but I didn't at all feel threatened
by it and I also didn't say a word to my husband.&nbsp; We bought this
particular home and we've been here for almost eight years now.&nbsp; This
is where it all begins.....</b>
<br><b>I always felt "them" here but they hadn't made themselves known
to me.&nbsp; At this point in time, it was myself, my husband and Zachary.&nbsp;
One particular day I was washing the dishes in the kitchen.&nbsp; Directly
off the kitchen is a bedroom which at that time was being used as my sons
playroom.&nbsp; The door was shut to the room, my husband was at work and
my son was at pre-school.&nbsp; I was the only one in the house.&nbsp;
I heard children behind me saying, "Mommy?&nbsp; Mommy?&nbsp; Mommy!"&nbsp;
I didn't even turn around because I knew that whatever it was that I was
feeling was finally making itself known to me and that they were children.&nbsp;
After hearing this, I continued doing the dishes and I heard them in the
playroom playing, laughing and just having a great time.&nbsp; I finished
up the dishes, went into the playroom and sat down.&nbsp; I saw nothing,
I heard nothing but I felt them.&nbsp; I knew that they were there.&nbsp;
I told them that they are certainly welcome here, that they were here first
but that they were dead and they truly needed to go to the other side and
I was certain they would find their mother there because I wasn't their
mother.&nbsp; I told them about the other side, about God, about Christ
and heaven and I encouraged them to look toward the light and to follow
it and it would lead them to heaven.&nbsp; I also told them though, that
if for some reason they couldn't or wouldn't go on to the other side, they
were welcome here on one condition, that they didn't freak me out!&nbsp;
I know it sounds strange but I felt like they understood me and agreed
and I also knew that they weren't leaving.&nbsp; I continued hearing the
children.&nbsp; I started to hear them cry sometimes and call out to me,
who they truly believe is their mother and I would once again tell them
that I'm not their mother and that everything would be okay.&nbsp; I never
mentioned a word to my husband.&nbsp; One night after putting my son to
bed my husband and I were sitting reading.&nbsp; I was hearing the children
playing but I was keeping it to myself.&nbsp; My husband put his book down
and asked me if I heard "that".&nbsp; I asked him what he was hearing and
he said, "It's like children playing at recess or something."&nbsp; I then
told him about my experiences with the children and once again, he wasn't
impressed.&nbsp; The children had never shown themselves to me until one
night in particular, but I still didn't see all the children, only two,
beautiful girls.&nbsp; I knew of the children yes but I wasn't willing
to admit to myself that I was now feeling "uncomfortable" at certain times
because of a male presence.&nbsp; Just as I know there is good, I know
there is evil.&nbsp; I was in bed one night and I WAS NOT ASLEEP.&nbsp;
I was pregnant with my second son and he was moving about and I was in
awe at the feeling inside of me so I KNOW I was not asleep.&nbsp; I was
lying there when I suddenly got very cold.&nbsp; I looked to my left and
I saw demons coming towards me.&nbsp; I swear to you, I saw demons coming
towards me.&nbsp; I looked in front of me and at the end of my bed were
two beautiful, young girls dressed in 1800 era clothing, with their backs
towards me, kneeling and praying.&nbsp; I was terrified and in awe at the
same time.&nbsp; I knew they were praying for me.&nbsp; I looked and still
saw the demons, I looked and the two girls were still there so I tried
with all my might to keep my eyes on them.&nbsp; Knowing they were praying
for me helped my fear so I kept looking at them.&nbsp; They never turned
toward me and then they just disappeared.&nbsp; I looked and I no longer
saw the demons.&nbsp; That was the first time I saw these two girls.&nbsp;
I still thank them for their efforts today.&nbsp; They were beautiful.&nbsp;
They're not the only children here though, they're the ones that allowed
themselves to be seen.&nbsp; The children seemed to stay in the playroom,
which is now my oldest sons bedroom but they seem to have wandered a bit.&nbsp;
I'll now sense, feel and hear them in the living room as well.&nbsp; The
only time I saw them upstairs was the night in which I told you about.</b>
<br><b>Another spirit we have in the house is down in my basement.&nbsp;
He seems to stay on my husbands side of the basement, his workshop.&nbsp;
I'll go downstairs to do laundry or go work in my craft room and I'll feel
him, I'll sense him.&nbsp; I do not like him at all.&nbsp; He doesn't scare
me or even try to scare me but he just doesn't "feel" peaceful.&nbsp; So,
I made the same deal with him that I made with the children.&nbsp; Do not
freak me out!&nbsp; Sometimes though I will start feeling a bit on edge.&nbsp;
I'll be doing the laundry and when doing so my back is turned toward the
workshop and I'll know he's there.&nbsp; I just get such an uneasy feeling
and one time in particular it got to intense for my liking so I told him
he was freaking me out and I reminded him of our deal.&nbsp; I immediately
felt the intense feeling subside a bit.&nbsp; He stays in the basement,
he doesn't wander around the house.</b>
<br><b>There is another spirit, male, but he really hasn't made himself
known to me for quite some time.&nbsp; I ended up getting very angry with
him and told him just what I thought of him and of him being in MY house.&nbsp;
Since that time I haven't felt him more than three or four times.&nbsp;
He was the voyeur type.&nbsp; I would always, since the day I moved in
the house, feel him watching me shower, dress, undress and I'm sorry for
being so personal but even while my husband and I made love.&nbsp; It got
to the point where I didn't want to be intimate with my husband because
I felt so uncomfortable with his "prying eyes".&nbsp; Like I mentioned
though, he really hasn't been around since my "head fit" on him.&nbsp;
:)</b>
<br><b>There is another male spirit, an older one.&nbsp; He is very unpleasant
in my opinion.&nbsp; I first felt him while cleaning my sons bedroom.&nbsp;
The temperature in the room dropped so quickly I couldn't believe it!&nbsp;
He likes to taunt me.&nbsp; I again made the same "deal" with him and he
most of the time abides by it but sometimes he doesn't.&nbsp; For instance,
just the other night all three of my children had gone to Cub Scouts with
my husband.&nbsp; Again, only me in the house.&nbsp; Well, I feel him behind
me.&nbsp; I feel him trying to taunt me.&nbsp; I somehow "know" he's just
looking for a reaction.&nbsp; Well, after fifteen minutes of this, he got
a reaction.&nbsp; He reacted to me by going into the kitchen and slamming
open and shut the cupboard doors.&nbsp; I went back to the computer and
felt him behind me again.&nbsp; I once again told him he just needed to
get the heck away from me and I "saw" him in my minds eye turn around,
walk over to my rocking chair, put his hand on his chin with a little (sinister)
grin on his face.&nbsp; I just went on doing what I was doing and he eventually
got up and walked back out into the kitchen while I heard his footsteps
the entire way.&nbsp; This man (spirit) also likes to go outside of my
house.&nbsp; We have two decks attached to my house.&nbsp; A covered deck
is on the kitchen side and not only have I seen him walking there, back
and forth, but so has my husband.&nbsp; The other deck goes off of our
living room and surrounds to the front of the house.&nbsp; We both have
seen him walking on this deck also.&nbsp; He just walks back and forth,
pacing, as if thinking about something.&nbsp; Just a little note:&nbsp;
My husband and I both saw "something" while we lived in our condo before
buying our house.&nbsp; This spirit is the same spirit in my belief.</b>
<br><b>Another spirit in my home is an older lady.&nbsp; I absolutely adore
her.&nbsp; She is comforting and soothing.&nbsp; I'll sometimes get very
down and whenever I feel this way I'll feel her with me.&nbsp; I love having
my blankets tucked in tightly around me in bed.&nbsp; When I'm down, basically
having a pity party, she'll tuck me in.&nbsp; I can't see her but I feel
her.&nbsp; I feel her presence, I feel the blankets move and I see the
blankets move.&nbsp; Sometimes she'll sit at the end of the bed until I
fall asleep.&nbsp; I feel blessed that she's here.</b>
<br><b>There is another "spirit" here but he isn't a spirit, he's an angel.&nbsp;
I want to tell you this story because eventually Zachary, my oldest child
will become a key factor in why I wrote to you.&nbsp; I told you we'd be
here for quite some time!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; The same month that my husband
and I moved into our house he had a terrible truck accident.&nbsp; He was
in his truck, unconscious and a "man" who is about my size, let's just
say petite, dragged my 300 pound husband out of his truck (my husband lifts
weights, a lot of weights :).&nbsp; He woke my husband up while he was
still lying on the road waiting for the ambulance to arrive.&nbsp; My husband
has told me that when the ambulance arrived, this "man" was nowhere to
be found.&nbsp; I was walking into work (I was still working at the time)
and I got "the phone call".&nbsp; It was awful.&nbsp; I got to the hospital
and there stood the state trooper waiting to talk to me.&nbsp; My husband
was in X-Ray because he wasn't having any feeling on his right side.&nbsp;
The nurses told me that he would be in X-Ray for quite some time so I decided
to take a walk and go have a much needed cigarette.&nbsp; I took a certain
way through the hospital that I don't think many people know about (I was
in labor with Zachary for 39 hours, I know every inch of that hospital
:) and I ended up outside where no one else was.&nbsp; I hadn't told anyone
where I was going, simply that I would be back in about 15 minutes.&nbsp;
I was standing by the door when a "man" came out and simply said to me,
"Hello Maureen.&nbsp; I'm the man that helped your husband and I just want
you to know that he will be okay."&nbsp; That was it!&nbsp; I was still
looking at him and he was gone.&nbsp; POOF!&nbsp; My family has very strong
Christian beliefs and we're very steadfast in them.&nbsp; I knew he was
angel, not a man.&nbsp; My husband was okay.&nbsp; They even released him
that night.&nbsp; The "man" that I saw wore jeans and a sweatshirt with
a blondish-gray beard.&nbsp; Jason, my husband, couldn't remember what
he wore.&nbsp; Something else that happened, which leads me to my son is
one night I asked my husband to make me a cup of coffee (instant).&nbsp;
He accidentally turned the wrong burner on which caused the bacon grease
on the lit burner to catch fire.&nbsp; The next thing I knew the kitchen
was on fire.&nbsp; At this time I had my second son and he was two where
Zachary was four.&nbsp; My husband yelled for me to take the boys out of
the house and go out on the deck.&nbsp; I did as he said, terrified of
course but when I turned around after getting the boys out I was even more
terrified.&nbsp; MY HUSBAND WAS ON FIRE.&nbsp; I don't (well, I do but
I didn't at that time) know how he did it but he had gotten the kitchen
fire out and he had gotten the fire out on his clothing with burns only
on his hands which didn't even lead to scaring.&nbsp; That night, after
my husband came home from the hospital and I was tucking Zachary into bed
he asked if I had seen "them".&nbsp; I asked him who "them" was and he
said, "The angels Mommy.&nbsp; There were four angels surrounding the table
helping Daddy put out the fire and they helped the put out the fire on
his clothes."&nbsp; What could I say?&nbsp; I cried, told him to say his
prayers and thank God for keeping us all safe and I went and did the same.&nbsp;
My point in telling you all of this?&nbsp; I knew that night that Zachary
could see, hear and sense some of the same things I could and I knew that
he would eventually be telling me more of things he's seen.&nbsp; He's
now eight.&nbsp; It's taken four years but he's proven me right.&nbsp;
Zachary told me the other night he was lying in bed and he looked and he
saw a "little man wearing jeans and a blue sweatshirt with a beard type
of thing."&nbsp; A coincidence?&nbsp; Nope, you can't convince me of it.</b>
<br><b>The reason for me writing to you in the first place is because of
Zachary.&nbsp; He to has seen the older woman, the one I love so much.&nbsp;
My son suffers from Bipolar and has had a difficult time of it lately.&nbsp;
He told me that he looked over to his desk and she sat in his chair, just
looking at him, not scaring him in least.&nbsp; He said he just "knew"
she wouldn't hurt him.&nbsp; But then he told me that he's also seen an
old man who isn't very nice.&nbsp; He hasn't done anything to scare Zachary
with the one exception of showing himself to Zach.&nbsp; The same man that
I've seen and my husband has seen?&nbsp; I think so.....&nbsp; He also
told me that he's heard the children.&nbsp; He said it sounds like they're
playing.&nbsp; He has also said that he's seen them playing in our living
room.&nbsp; He can describe these things to me.&nbsp; He told the "man"
(the good one) was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt.&nbsp; He described the
older lady down to her boots!&nbsp; He's described the children as wearing
clothes, "like they wear on Little House And The Prairie."&nbsp; The same
children?&nbsp; I do believe so.&nbsp; Zachary has been having a very difficult
time sleeping.&nbsp; He now sleeps downstairs in the room which was once
the playroom.&nbsp; He told me just the other night that he doesn't want
to hurt "her" feelings but he wishes that she would leave him alone so
he could get some sleep.&nbsp; I asked him if he's asked her to leave him
alone and he told me that she comes over, tucks him in and he then falls
right to sleep.&nbsp; I had a talk with the woman.&nbsp; I asked her to
please leave Zach alone and that I know she's here to only help and comfort,
but he's having a difficult time with it.&nbsp; I "heard" her tell me that
she understood and we agreed that she would still look after Zachary but
she would wait until he was sound asleep.&nbsp; He's now telling me that
something else is waking him up.&nbsp; He tells me that he feels like he's
being watched all the time.&nbsp; He sleeps in our room half the time to
be perfectly honest with you, especially lately.&nbsp; He's been calling
me in every night telling me that "they" have been waking him up and he'll
tell them to leave him alone and that, "sometimes they do, sometimes they
don't."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My son as enough "issues" right now and I truly
believe that some of his issues are not just from his Bipolar but from
a reaction to a "negative" force.&nbsp; Not the older woman, not the children
but the old man.</b>
<br><b>I do feel that I need to share something else with you.&nbsp; About
two years ago I was speaking to an older woman friend of mine, telling
her of the circumstances in my home and she referred me to a woman called
Nischa who lives in California.&nbsp; Nischa is a "healer".&nbsp; Well,
I wanted to know what the heck was going on in my house and why.&nbsp;
I wanted to know why I would have "flashbacks" in which I couldn't explain
and I suppose I just wanted someone to validate me, my experiences and
the fact that there are spirits here.&nbsp; Now I made a deal with God
a long time ago.&nbsp; I promised God that I wouldn't speak to a physic,
that I would trust what I hear Him tell me in my heart.&nbsp; Well, I convinced
myself that she was in fact a healer and not a physic but I think they
intertwined while speaking to her.&nbsp; What she told me was VERY interesting
and I think you may find it interesting as well.</b>
<br><b>I spoke with Nischa on two separate occasions for an hour each time.&nbsp;
These are the things that she's told me.&nbsp; Please bear with me, I told
you I had a lot to tell you.&nbsp; Please also keep in mind one very important
factor - I did not tell her anything about anything.&nbsp; She only knew
that "things" were happening.&nbsp; Okay, here's what she told me during
our conversations:</b>
<br><b>- I had a male spirit who liked to watch me.&nbsp; He was a lover
from a past life that I lived in the 1800's.&nbsp; I fell victim to his
charms and soon became pregnant with his child and when he learned of the
baby he of course declined any knowledge of my existence.&nbsp; When my
parents found out that I was pregnant, I was sent to relatives in Virginia
where I gave birth to my baby who after a few months died of measles.&nbsp;
The relatives in which I stayed with were not nice to me nor were they
sympathetic at all and basically treated me as if I were a slave.&nbsp;
I died at the age of 17 from being treated the way I had been by these
relatives but also because of a broken heart from the loss of my child.&nbsp;
She then told me that the cemetery across the street from me, the baby's
tombstone that I always go to but don't know why, that is my baby.&nbsp;
Okay, well, what can I say?&nbsp; I didn't tell her there was a cemetery
across the street from me nor did I tell her that I was always drawn to
this particular baby's tombstone.&nbsp; I didn't tell her that I felt a
male presence always watching me (by the way, she said that the reason
why he was here was because he felt I owed him something) nor did I tell
her that I've always wanted to go to Virginia because I've always felt
that I "belong" there and I did not tell her that I fantasize about living
in the 1800's and that I somehow "know" I once lived during that time.&nbsp;
This particular male spirit she spoke of - he's the one I told you about.&nbsp;
The one that always watched me undress among other things.&nbsp; Well after
I found who he was and why he was here, I got angry.&nbsp; I told him that
I didn't owe him anything and he needed to leave because he wasn't welcome
here.&nbsp; After that his presence was SO strong that I wouldn't even
take a shower without my husband in the bathroom with me.&nbsp; One day
though, I had to.&nbsp; I felt him so close to me, as if he was in the
shower with me.&nbsp; I yelled at him again and I "heard" him just laugh.&nbsp;
Well didn't that make me angry!&nbsp; That same night (now you're going
get a kick out of this one) I was putting away the dishes.&nbsp; I was
putting the silverware in the drawer and I felt him behind me.&nbsp; I
could actually feel him breathing on my neck.&nbsp; Well I had enough of
him.&nbsp; I took a fork and just started poking at the air!&nbsp; I know,
crazy, but I was really mad and fed up with him.&nbsp; I just kept poking
and told him exactly what I thought of him, what he once did and this is
a different lifetime for me and I belonged to someone else so just LEAVE.&nbsp;
Well, like I mentioned earlier, since that time I've only felt him three
or four times.&nbsp; Whenever I feel him around I always tell him to just
leave, he's not welcome and he usually does.</b>
<br><b>-I have an older woman in my house who is a distant aunt of my husbands.&nbsp;
She is here to look out for my family, to give them comfort and support.&nbsp;
Well, this certainly sounded familiar.</b>
<br><b>-There was an older man in my home in which believes that I am his
daughter who during their lifetime would not allow him to see her children,
his grandchildren.&nbsp; He is very angry with me because of this.&nbsp;
The old man that likes to taunt me?</b>
<br><b>-The mother of the children in the house is also in the house.&nbsp;
She lost her children one day and had never found them before she died.&nbsp;
She is continuing to look for them.&nbsp; Nischa said that this particular
spirit is drawing on my "light" and that is why I suffer from depression.&nbsp;
She is taking my happiness and in turn, I am feeling her depression.&nbsp;
Well I didn't know anything about her but I will tell you that I never
suffered from depression since I've moved into this house.&nbsp; I have
now been diagnosed myself with Bipolar.</b>
<br><b>-She said there were many children in the house and that they were
simply "stuck" and they quite simply did not want to leave.&nbsp; She tried
having them go to the other side and she told me that she was "seeing"
two of them leave but she didn't think they would stay gone.&nbsp; She
told me about five minutes later that the children were returning, they
were running toward my home because it was safe and it was what they knew.&nbsp;
They would not leave no matter the circumstances.&nbsp; I found this very
interesting to say the least.....</b>
<br><b>-She then told me something very interesting, something VERY SCARY.&nbsp;
She told me that the wall in my bedroom was a "vortex to hell".&nbsp; Well,
you can just imagine what I was thinking when I heard this.&nbsp; She told
me that at one time my bed was positioned against this wall and I saw demons
coming toward me and that what I saw was truth, not a dream.&nbsp; She
"cleared" this particular part of my house and she said that more than
1500 lost souls went toward the light but then an angry "man" realized
what was happening and "slammed down a concrete cover to the hole".&nbsp;
Well, my bed was positioned on this particular wall the night that I saw
the demons coming towards me and the two girls showed themselves to me.&nbsp;
My bed was also positioned on this wall the night that I heard the thundering
footsteps racing up my stairs and the glass of water broke for no reason
at all.&nbsp; My bed was moved that night and will never again be put against
that wall!</b>
<br><b>-She also told me that beneath the cemetery across the street is
an old Indian burial ground.&nbsp; Underneath the child's tombstone that
I am always drawn to lye's an Indian man who doesn't care much for me.&nbsp;
She said he is in the basement of my house and that he will not wander.&nbsp;
Ok, at this point, I was sitting there with my mouth open, not believing
anything she was telling me but at the same time knowing that it all made
sense and therefore I did believe it.</b>
<br><b>-She told me that it wasn't my house itself.&nbsp; She said it was
the land in which it was on.&nbsp; Now, the land long ago was all mill
land.&nbsp; This is true.&nbsp; I didn't tell her this though.&nbsp; Right
behind my house is what I call a little "bog".&nbsp; Just a tiny little
body of water in which always gives me the creeps.&nbsp; I do not allow
my children down there because I simply feel evil when near it.&nbsp; I
of course did not tell Nischa of this bog but she told me.&nbsp; She said
that a man was responsible for the death of the children in my home and
that they suffered their fate where this bog is.</b>
<br><b>-She said that my oldest son would soon be telling me of things
that he's always seen.</b>
<br><b>-She said that my Grandfather visited my baby, Elijah, and that
is what I hear when I hear Elijah playing and laughing and "talking" (baby
talk of course) in his crib.</b>
<br><b>-She said that the spirits, all spirits are attracted to me and
will follow me because of my "light" and the fact that I recognize their
existence.&nbsp; She said just as they will give to me, they will take
from me.</b>
<br><b>She told me some other things but I don't think they really belong
here.</b>
<br><b>Now, as far as the typical signs, we have them all.&nbsp; The temperature
will drop in the house.&nbsp; Whenever I'm on the phone speaking of "them",
the phone will cut out.&nbsp; We will all experience cold spots.&nbsp;
We'll walk in the house after being gone and the lights will be on, the
TV will be on and certain doors will be open.&nbsp; Things will be moved
to a different spot.&nbsp; Things will be seen out of the corner of our
eyes and things will always be heard.&nbsp; The lights will flicker and
sometimes, anything electronic will just "act weird".&nbsp; My husband
and I will sometime see "gray forms" wandering about.&nbsp; This past Thanksgiving
we had my parents over.&nbsp; We were telling them of the things going
on the house and all of a sudden a spatula that was behind me on the counter
went flying!</b>
<br><b>I should also mention to you that my middle son, Jonah has been
experiencing terrible nightmares.&nbsp; Actually the doctors have called
them night terrors.&nbsp; Yes, I do realize that these are a common occurrence
for children but I sometimes wonder if there's more to it.&nbsp; Also,
my "baby", my two year old Elijah will point to a particular place in the
house, all different places at different times and say "ghost".&nbsp; I
also have two dogs and they will all of a sudden just go crazy.&nbsp; They'll
bark and bark and run around the house like there's no tomorrow.&nbsp;
Sometimes Jasper, my Golden Retriever will act as if he's "playing" with
someone.&nbsp; He'll be positioned as if he were jumping up on someone
but being held and patted, in mid air I might remind you.</b>
<br><b>My husband, the skeptic isn't such a skeptic anymore.&nbsp; After
seeing some of the things he's seen he believes there are "others" here.&nbsp;
He has even been touched by a spirit here and he does not like that in
the least.&nbsp; He's just not used to it.&nbsp; Sometimes I will have
my hair pulled back from my face for me or I'll feel a hand on my shoulder,
always comforting, never threatening.&nbsp; He also has witnessed the lights
flickering, the temperature drops, the phone cutting out, the TV acting
weird, the lights being on when they were off and doors being open when
they were shut.&nbsp; He seems to think that I have control over these
spirits so he's always telling me to make them stop.&nbsp; He himself though
has become somewhat sensitive I believe.&nbsp; He is a contractor and he
was working at an old mill not far from here.&nbsp; He said there were
spirits in this place and there was NO doubt about it.&nbsp; He told me
that he along with many other grown men wouldn't go up and down a particular
staircase because of the sensation there.&nbsp; One other thing that I
should mention about my husband.&nbsp; There was a period of time that
he was hearing a male voice speak to him.&nbsp; This voice would always
tell him to do evil things.&nbsp; It would sometimes tell him to do things
to other people but also to himself.&nbsp; One time in particular my husband
was driving to work and the male voice told him to simply drive off the
side of the road, that wouldn't be painful and he wouldn't have to work
anymore.&nbsp; Jason of course never acted upon any of these instructions
but he did say that he sometimes felt as if he were in a trance when he
heard the male voice.&nbsp; My husband hasn't mentioned hearing him for
quite some time now.</b>
<br><b>Just a little note:&nbsp; The spirit on my husbands side of the
basement will always let my dog outside.&nbsp; I always keep Jasper on
a lead whereas he isn't fixed and I don't want little "Jasper puppies"
but if he should get downstairs, and even though the door is locked tight,
he always ends up outside.&nbsp; This doesn't impress me.</b>
<br><b>As far as things I've tried.&nbsp; I'd done the white candle thing.&nbsp;
I've talked to them.&nbsp; I've told them they were dead and they needed
to go to the other side.&nbsp; I've done this and I've done that.&nbsp;
My last effort was burning sage whereas I learned it is a "cleansing" herb.&nbsp;
Well, wrong thing to do.&nbsp; After I burned the sage, I felt SO many
spirits in my house it was unbelievable and the ones that were already
here, weren't exactly thrilled that I would do such a thing.&nbsp; I haven't
burned the sage since.</b>

<p><b>The Dead Girl in the School Walls</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: scrossfield@semo.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>One day after Brittany and mine basketball game we were walking around
the highschool. I was telling her about this girl that had died there and
was buried in the walls somewhere, so we walked into a passage in the wall
trying to see if we could find her. Then suddenly all the noise stopped
and the cars on the highway wern't to be seen. We walked out the passage
into the gym. We said, "IS ANYBODY HERE?" Nody answered. We stopped. We
heard some girl crying. We walked into the locker room where it was coming
from. We saw a glowing figure wearing a white dress, brown short hair,
cold blue eyes, and white skin. When she saw us she floated to us and said
help. Then she disappeared. It was really freaky.</b><b></b>

AT</b>
<br><b>THAT TIME, WE DECIDED THAT IT WAS HIGH TIME TO LEAVE.&nbsp; AS WE
QUICKLY WALKED</b>
<br><b>TOWARDS THE DOOR, SHE TURNED TO SAY SOMETHING TO ME AND SHE SAW

<p><b>That's My Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lynn85lv@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>okay uh--I don't know where to start....</b>
<br><b>My mother tells me of a man (she tells me she just can sense its
a male) who</b>
<br><b>walks through our hallway and sits on the edge of her bed. She tells
me that</b>
<br><b>she knows that he is staring at her and then sometime later get
up and walk</b>
<br><b>to our sunroom and disappear. I have several times stayed up late
because I</b>
<br><b>am not able to fall asleep and hear footsteps through our kitchen
to the</b>
<br><b>bedrooms. I once looked up and in the shadows of the kitchen I saw
a dark</b>
<br><b>figure. I never screamed because for some reason he made me feel
at ease. I</b>
<br><b>couldn't get a good look at him because it was so dark but the outline
of</b>
<br><b>him</b>
<br><b>made me know he was a man. Whenever I see him though I am frozen
and</b>
<br><b>motionless for some time until he decides to walk through the hallway
and</b>
<br><b>disappear. My mom once told me of someone hanging themselves in
a house. She</b>
<br><b>wasn't sure if it was our house or the one that got burnt down awhile
back</b>

<p><b>By: ylynn@gte.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was around ten(10) years old I was visited by what looked

in the bedroom that I shared with my baby sister.&nbsp; This closet was
to the right / foot our bed and every night a black shadow would stand
at the foot of my bed.&nbsp; This figure was tall, evil looking and feeling.
For for several weeks I was scared to go to bed for it was alwaystanding
there watching me from outside my closet.My sister either didnt see or
never mentioned for she was but two(2)years old.I finally had enough, I
went to my mother and explained what I was seeing.&nbsp; She and a neighbor
prayed and oinoted our house and especially my room.&nbsp; After that this

<br><b>Strange House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: WinterFairy3000@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Ever since i was little I've believed my house was haunted. I've
been in this</b>
<br><b>house for 12 years and ever since I could remember I've seen some
pretty</b>
<br><b>strange things in there. It all started around 9 years ago when
I was 6 years</b>
<br><b>old. I've always seen lights zipping across the room out of the
corner of my</b>
<br><b>eye for the longest time. Around two or three years ago was when
I saw a</b>
<br><b>black figure in my house. My friends were spending the night and
we were in</b>
<br><b>the living room. We were talking when I had the feeling that I should
look</b>
<br><b>behind me but the feeling was scary so instead I looked into my
tv (it was</b>
<br><b>right in front of me and would show things behind me. And it was
off) and</b>
<br><b>standing behind me was a black figure so I turned arund to see if
anything</b>
<br><b>was actually there and nothing was there so I turned back to my
tv to see if</b>
<br><b>the same thing was showing in the tv and the black figure wasn't
reflecting</b>
<br><b>off it anymore, only me and my friends were. Well nothing liked
that happened</b>
<br><b>for a while except the occasional creaking when I wasn't walking
and I was</b>
<br><b>alone and a face in the wall. Well last year the black figure came
back when</b>
<br><b>I was talking on the phone to my friend. I had that feeling again
to look at</b>
<br><b>something so I turned my head slightly and there was the dark figure.
I</b>
<br><b>couldn't make out of what it was but it did have it's own shadow
for some</b>
<br><b>reason and I told my friend and was crying cause I had this scary
feeling and</b>
<br><b>she was telling me to not look at it again and to turn on all the
lights, but</b>
<br><b>the problem was that the figure was by the lights so I just sat
where I was</b>
<br><b>and cried untill the figure dissapeard then I turned on every light
I could</b>
<br><b>find. I haven't seen the figure since then.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bernieeallen@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>What this this is me passing on a story. The story being an incident
that</b>
<br><b>occured to my grandfather. Let me begin by setting the scene. This
occurance</b>
<br><b>happened in northern Queensland, Australia. (The best country in
the world</b>
<br><b>lol) Nth Qld is a very hot and dry place. very aird as well, lots
of bush</b>
<br><b>and not exactly an over-aboundance of civilisation.</b>
<br><b>He used to travel to work on horseback. It was a rather lengthy
trip, around</b>
<br><b>an hour or so, give or take. One day he was travelling home and
came accross</b>
<br><b>a little girl standing in the bush waving to him. He wondered why
she was so</b>
<br><b>far in the forest and assumed she was lost so went up to her, only
to freak</b>
<br><b>out when he realised he could see straight through her. He managed
to gather</b>
<br><b>himself together and realised she was in fact pointing. She began
to walk</b>
<br><b>away and he realised that she wanted him to follow her, so he did.</b>
<br><b>After around an hour or so of pursueing the girl he began to become</b>
<br><b>concerned as he was lost and the further he was travelling the more
lost he</b>
<br><b>was becoming. Having said this, however, and against his common
sense, he</b>
<br><b>continued to follow. Not too long after his little friend decided
to vanish.</b>
<br><b>So there he was, alone, confused, lost and scared as the sun was
quickly</b>
<br><b>giving way to night.</b>
<br><b>He decided to sit down and attempt to regain his bearings when he
heard a</b>
<br><b>noise, albeit muffeled, coming from not too far away. Investigating,
he came</b>
<br><b>accross a man who was trapped under his horse. the horse had suffered
a</b>
<br><b>heart attack and came down on top of its passanfer, pinning him
to the</b>
<br><b>earth. grand-dad freed the man from his predicament.</b>
<br><b>The man, very thankful and emotional, asked Grand-dad what he was
doing in</b>
<br><b>the area as no one ever came out that way. My grand dad told him
the story</b>
<br><b>of the girl and how he followed her. The man asked what she looked
like to</b>
<br><b>which my grand dad replied. the man began to shake and turned white.</b>
<br><b>My grand dad asked what was wrong and he replied that that was his
daughter,</b>
<br><b>who had died a week before.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Thru most of my adult life I have had several repeticious dreams

<br><b>In March of 1975 I gave birth to a beautiful daughter.&nbsp; When

<br><b>that night, I vividly dreamt about losing a baby girl.&nbsp; I heard</b>
<br><b>conversations, in reference to losing her, how sad everyone was,
such a</b>
<br><b>tragedy and then I woke up.&nbsp; My mother came into my hospital
room right after</b>
<br><b>I awoke and I really thought I had lost my daugter.&nbsp; I was
insistant that</b>
<br><b>something had happened to her.&nbsp; My mother&nbsp; was confused
and said everything</b>
<br><b>was alright, just a bad dream.&nbsp; I ran to the nursery to check
on her and sure</b>
<br><b>enough she was fine.&nbsp; Then in 1983 I was pregnant.&nbsp; Pregancy
was normal,</b>
<br><b>except for the baby being in a breach position.&nbsp; I knew it
was a girl from an</b>
<br><b>ultrasound.&nbsp; For some reason during the end of the pregnancy
I felt inside</b>
<br><b>that I would never see her.&nbsp; I knew something was wrong and
it scared me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>wrote my husband a note expressing my fears and two days later I
ended up in</b>
<br><b>the hospital, in labor, too early.&nbsp; I lost a beutiful little
girl on Feb. 6,</b>
<br><b>1983.&nbsp; The placenta had abrupted and the hospital staff said
there was</b>
<br><b>nothing they could do to save her, even though it took 11 hours
for her to</b>
<br><b>die inside of me.</b>
<br><b>When I got home from the hospital I started having another strange
dream.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was about a place where I would eventually move to - 3 years later.&nbsp;
Then in</b>
<br><b>1987 I had another strange dream about a baby, a different house,
another</b>
<br><b>man, and flowers.&nbsp; My first husband left me that same year.&nbsp;
It was meant to</b>
<br><b>be, it wasn't working.&nbsp; In 1988 I met someone else, fell in
love, and on</b>
<br><b>Oct 1,&nbsp; 1990 had a beutiful son, lived in the place I saw in&nbsp;
my dream and my</b>
<br><b>furniture was exactly like my dream,&nbsp; with a floral print on
it.&nbsp; All of this</b>
<br><b>has had me bewildered for years.&nbsp; I can't explain it to people
because they</b>
<br><b>look at me weird.</b>
<br><b>I had one more dream in 1998, it came true also.&nbsp; That was
the last strange</b>
<br><b>dream that came true.&nbsp; I haven't had any more.&nbsp; Could
my dreams be spirits</b>
<br><b>showing me what was to be, or God letting me know what the future
would</b>
<br><b>bring.&nbsp; I am not psychic in any way, that I am aware of.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I&nbsp; suppose I will</b>
<br><b>never know why any of the dreams occured, and in a way&nbsp; I&nbsp;
am happy about not</b>
<br><b>having them any more.</b>
<br><b>Last November I had to buy a used car because mine was totaled in
an</b>
<br><b>accident.&nbsp; I bought an older model convertable that was in
great condition.</b>
<br><b>In December someone ran into the back of me and totaled the car.&nbsp;
Thank God,</b>
<br><b>no one was hurt but I was extremely upset because of all the damage
to my</b>
<br><b>car.&nbsp; I&nbsp; kept the car for awhile because it was still
driveable and because</b>
<br><b>of personal problems I couldn't afford another one.</b>
<br><b>In June of the same year I did get another car, or should I say
"lemon" that</b>
<br><b>I bought from a private owner that had a psychic business.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The car was</b>
<br><b>impossible, from the very beginning, but I spent alot of money on
it to fix</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew I was taken after I bought it but when you
buy from a private</b>
<br><b>owner there are no returns.&nbsp; Anyway, I still had the convertable
parked</b>
<br><b>outside.&nbsp;&nbsp; During that summer the woman I had bought the
convertable from had</b>
<br><b>a tragic event happen in her life.&nbsp; Her only son was killed
in a car</b>
<br><b>accident.&nbsp; After the accident I started hearing noises in my
apartment late</b>
<br><b>at night.</b>
<br><b>Creaking, light footsteps especially down my hallway.&nbsp; I was
spooked but</b>
<br><b>chalked it up to my imagination getting away with me.&nbsp; This
went on</b>
<br><b>everynight, until I got rid of the convertable.&nbsp; The very night
the car was</b>
<br><b>towed away the noises stopped.&nbsp; My imagination got the best
of me again, and</b>
<br><b>I actually had a thought about the previous owners'&nbsp; son being
killed in a</b>
<br><b>car accident and the fact that his mothers' favorite car was parked
outside</b>
<br><b>my apartment.&nbsp; Really scared me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; the
noises are gone and so&nbsp; is the</b>
<br><b>car.</b>
<br><b>Everything I have written above is true accounts of strange events
that I</b>
<br><b>have experienced in my life.&nbsp; I may never know the reasons
why, but somehow I</b>
<br><b>wish I could.</b>

<p><b>Spirit or Bad Energy?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CYBORG4777@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When I was about 10 or 11 I used to sleep in the smallest room in
my</b>
<br><b>appartment. My uncle lived with us for a while because he was doing
things he</b>
<br><b>shouldn't and so he took that room and slept in there. After he
left I moved</b>
<br><b>back into that room. After a while I started to see things move
and I would</b>
<br><b>see people and I would call to my mom and ask to sleep in her room.
This went</b>
<br><b>on for about a month. Then we talked to my aunt about and she said
she would</b>
<br><b>bring some sage over and try to flush the spirit and/or bad energy
out.(This</b>
<br><b>is an indian ritual) So after she did that it stopped for a while.
Somtimes</b>
<br><b>I'll hear things or feel like someone is in the room with me and
watching me.</b>
<br><b>Mabe it was my uncles bad energy that was in the room or mabe it
was my mom's</b>

<br><b>Somebodies Following Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: [CrystalAbts@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happend just last year before Christmas time when me and my
family</b>
<br><b>went to spend the night at my dads brothers house.&nbsp; Theres
a rode that</b>
<br><b>goes down to the docks by the river were I like to go just to walk</b>
<br><b>around the river.&nbsp; When you go out side you walk around the
house and</b>
<br><b>walk down to the river thats by a bar and other houses.&nbsp; Anyway
I was</b>
<br><b>bored so I wanted to walk down by the docks so I got my coat and
mittens</b>
<br><b>and ect. on and walked down to the docks.&nbsp; I just walked around
on the</b>
<br><b>docks and looked at the water with the sun going down and it looked</b>
<br><b>pretty.&nbsp; So I got off the docks and went above it a little
and sat by</b>
<br><b>the frozen ice water and just watched the sunset and relaxed.&nbsp;
There was</b>
<br><b>a pach of water that wasnt frozen so when I looked down at it bubbles</b>
<br><b>came up and was splashing a lot.&nbsp; I thought it was a snake
so I got up</b>
<br><b>and decided to go back to the house.&nbsp; Before I could turn around
I heard</b>
<br><b>footlike steps right across from the river.&nbsp; It was just like
a island</b>
<br><b>with trees but you could see anything through them because they
werent</b>
<br><b>thick.&nbsp; I looked around and say nothing, but I still heard
footsteps</b>
<br><b>across the river.&nbsp; They were cruching in the snow.&nbsp; I
thought that was</b>
<br><b>weird so I just started walking back.&nbsp; I heard the footsteps
again and</b>
<br><b>this time they were like 5 feet behind me.&nbsp; I kepted walking
faster and</b>
<br><b>faster, but he footsteps were right behind me.&nbsp; I took a glance
like</b>
<br><b>every second ,but nothing was there.&nbsp; Not a person or anything.&nbsp;
So then</b>
<br><b>I finally made it to the house and was safe inside.&nbsp; As I got
into the</b>
<br><b>poch I felt a really cold feeling pass through me and I got the
chills</b>
<br><b>so I ran in the doorway.&nbsp; From this day on I still think it
was a ghost</b>

<p><b>Scary Story From My Past</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: WdD5498@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I grew up in small town in central New Hampshire. When I was eighteen
one of</b>
<br><b>my friends took me to a grave which is located on the side of a
road. The</b>
<br><b>grave lies off from the road about ten feet. The grave is that of
a young boy</b>
<br><b>named Miles Tyler who died in 1811. He then told me about some of
the</b>
<br><b>experiences he had had or heard of from this sight. I was a little
skeptical</b>
<br><b>of the stories. He had said that some times you will hear leaves
and braches</b>
<br><b>moving and there is no wind. Also branches will crack and break.He
had also</b>
<br><b>mentioned that if you left food out it would end up unwrapped and
partially</b>
<br><b>or completly eaten; even unopened cans of soda.The next day I was
over to a</b>
<br><b>friends house and told him of the story and he also admitted of
hearing of</b>
<br><b>this and being true. So we planned a trip up there with a group
of friends.</b>
<br><b>One of these people was a girl who was into the ghost and spirit
thing at</b>
<br><b>that time. She was in to the Ouija board and seyaunces. We arrived
there</b>
<br><b>about eleven at night so this way we wouldn't have any traffic or
intrussions</b>
<br><b>by passer-by's. The girl and her friend started to try and communicate
with</b>
<br><b>the boy who was burried at the grave. While the rest of us watched
intensely.</b>
<br><b>There was one person there who was mocking the whole thing and deffinitely</b>
<br><b>was a complete non-believer and had no respect for the dead what
so ever.</b>
<br><b>They had made contact with the boy with in two or three minutes
of trying.</b>
<br><b>The spirit they where talking to was getting aggrivated at the person
who had</b>
<br><b>been mocking him. I at that time didn't know what to believe. I
just kept</b>
<br><b>watching, my eyes glued on the ever moving oracle. Soon we all heard
the</b>
<br><b>leaves and limbs rustling in the woods around the grave. We all
started to</b>
<br><b>get nervous. While the person who had been mocking this whole event
picked up</b>
<br><b>his own pace. This just made things go completely out of control.
Now we</b>
<br><b>could definitely hear the branches breaking and it started to rain.
Suddenly</b>
<br><b>the guy who had been mocking this whole event was staring at the
head stone</b>
<br><b>in complete fear. Thats when we all noticed that it had moved. It
had tilted</b>
<br><b>to the left at least 2-3 inches. Thats when we all decided to leave.
Me and</b>
<br><b>two of my friends jumped in my truck to leave. It wouldn't start.
I tried for</b>
<br><b>what seemed like forever, still scared out of my mind. I jumped
out of the</b>
<br><b>truck and told my friend get in the drivers seat. I got out and
started</b>
<br><b>pushing the truck down the road. Within fifty feet the truck started
and the</b>
<br><b>rain stoped; so did the wind.We left and never looked back. I haven't
been</b>
<br><b>back since.We all stayed up to daylight and I dropped them off and
went home.</b>
<br><b>We where all shaken up by this and we didn't even talk about after.
That</b>
<br><b>morning I told my mom what had happened. Funny thing was is that
she did not</b>
<br><b>say that she didn't believe me , but chose to say I hope you have
learned</b>
<br><b>your lesson and don't go back. I'm sorry for the lack of names,
but didn't</b>
<br><b>want to involve any one without their permission. I know live out
of state</b>
<br><b>and have lost track of most of them.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Real Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mfaucey@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi. My name is Shannon. I have two experiences that I wanted to share
and find out what you think.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The first one happened in 1990 or 91. A friend was killed
in a car accident a month or so earlier. I was not very close with her,
but my best friend was. She was also very upset by her death. There were
photos all over her room of the girl.&nbsp; I always felt a strong presence
when I was in there. I spent the night with my friend often, since we were
seven.&nbsp; On this particular occasion, I had great difficulty falling
asleep.&nbsp; I roused once I finally did fall asleep, and realized that
I was talking out loud in my half waking state. I drowsily wondered why
I could hear my own voice but had no idea what I was saying, when the thought
literally screamed in my mind, "IT'S KIM!!!" I sat up in bed sweating profusely.
I looked at the clock and it read 3:33 am. For some reason, that gave me
a chill. I woke up every night for over a month at precisely 3:33am. Was
this really a communication with my dead friend?I have never told my best
friend about this, for fear it would upset her.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My second story just happened a few months ago. My husband
and I were living in an old family home that was built by my great great
grandparents in approx. 1893.&nbsp; I know a lot of the stories of the
house and the land because I was fortunate enough to have my great grandmother
with me until she was 107 yrs old, and my Grandma would tell me stories
and memories of when she would visit her grandparents there.&nbsp; I've
always felt a major presence there, particularly in one corner of the dining
room. Odd things happened from the beginning. I went to the house alone
to finish up some painting before we moved in. It was a rainy day. As soon
as I stepped out of the car, My hair stood on end. I then went into the
house and said, "I'm not sure who's here, but I'm sure you're family. I'm
glad that you're here, but please don't just appear 'cause you'll scare
me to death."&nbsp; The paint colors I had chosen to paint each room before
I had ever seen the house. After my first visit to the house, I told my
husband I wanted to change my mind. I showed him all the new colors and
had even chosen one to paint the floor of the porches.&nbsp; As we scraped
away the paint and got to the original layer, every color that I had chosen
was exactly what we found!!!!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That is just the weird stuff. Now for the actual experience.&nbsp;
My hubby and I were watching a special about Waco and the flubs involved.
It was storming. Afterwards, we were both very charged about the info in
the show and were debating it very hotly. I suddenly saw a&nbsp; ball of
light move about three feet away. I interrupted my hubby and asked if he
saw it. No car had driven by, so I knew that it wasn't headlights reflecting.
He hadn't seen it. I walked over to the spot and held my hand out where
the light had been and began "It was right he..." I stopped in mid sentence.
My hand began to tingle sharply. I looked at my hubby and said "Oh my God",
while almost laughing. I felt overcome by a sense of joy. The tingle spread
slowly down my arm and into my entire body. There was a distinct line as
it went, like someone was pouring water over me. I looked at my hubby and
began saying over and over, "She's here! Oh my God, she's here!" and burst
into tears of joy. I don't really remember saying the words, only the feeling
of happiness</b><b></b>

<br><b>Quite an Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: linda@mystical-magic.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Here is my story!</b>
<br><b>As i entered the cemetery, i was a little in distress, for it was
plain to</b>
<br><b>see how this cemetery was abandoned,</b>
<br><b>I got a strange feeling sort of like a drawing to go to a certain
area of the</b>
<br><b>cemetery, which of course i did follow.</b>
<br><b>i knew that at this part of the cemetery, was where the slaves had
been</b>
<br><b>buried, it was quite literally destroyed, graves were almost turned
over</b>
<br><b>i have dealt with spirits before, the feeling that i had was just
a warm</b>
<br><b>welcome, i could have actually communicated with one of the spirits
who</b>
<br><b>called himself Douglas, he proceeded to tell me about the history
of this</b>
<br><b>cemetery, and how at that time the slaves were just put in burlap
bags or</b>
<br><b>wrapped in sheets, if the slave was a good one there masters on
occasion took</b>
<br><b>the time by hand to make them a box made out of wood.</b>
<br><b>I found this experience to be most good, at this point I said my
prayer and</b>
<br><b>placed a rose on one of the graves and left.</b>
<br><b>But I guess you can say that I was somewhat still wanting to actually
know</b>
<br><b>from someone real the history of this cemetery, and so I drove around
the</b>
<br><b>area,</b>
<br><b>There was and elderly man at the end of the road and so I stopped
him and</b>
<br><b>approached him to ask if he knew about this particular cemetery,</b>
<br><b>indeed he told me the same of what Douglas said.</b>
<br><b>At this point and time he told me of a cemetery located in Ocala
on 318</b>
<br><b>which the people in the area called spook hill, he said that people
were</b>
<br><b>actually able to see ghosts and feel there presence tremendously,</b>
<br><b>he said it was a small cemetery within a gate, on the top of a hill,</b>
<br><b>of course my curiosity was rising, and so i decided to go and check
it out,</b>
<br><b>It was just about getting dark, when I found it,</b>
<br><b>and yes, it was quite different from the first one, for I felt the
presence</b>
<br><b>of many different entities.</b>
<br><b>I walked in the cemetery, which is surrounded by heavily dense woods,</b>
<br><b>i heard many strange noises in the woods, as the wind started to
pick up</b>
<br><b>quite strongly, i had seen a haze of white that were sort of embedded
in a</b>
<br><b>certain area of trees, i immediately went for my camera</b>
<br><b>but for some unknown reason it had not worked and it had worked
in the</b>
<br><b>cemetery before,</b>
<br><b>I felt a very strange feeling to look at a certain place which was
also in</b>
<br><b>the wooded area, but not very heavily, and there i seen a green
face,</b>
<br><b>i started to walk towards it as i grab my camera again, but once
again was</b>
<br><b>not able to snap a picture of this, as i walked closer it disappeared</b>
<br><b>i felt an uneasy feeling, but comfortable at the same time.</b>
<br><b>i said a prayer and walked out of the cemetery, as i close the gate,</b>
<br><b>i again took the camera out and at this time was able to take 2
pictures,</b>
<br><b>which strangely enough the camera&nbsp; both times went off by itself.</b>
<br><b>upon developing the pictures i will add to this story and send them
to you.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was around 10 or 11 years old, and my younger sister Laura was
around 5 or 6, we were in our shared bedroom playing on the floor with
our corgi matchbox cars, as we did quite regularly.</b>
<br><b>My favourite car was a bright red Ferrari, and I zoomed it across
our rug and it went straight under my sisters dolls pram in the corner
of our room,&nbsp; I went to retrieve it but couldn't find it anywhere,
I continued to search for it for roughly a couple of minutes, (As I said,
it was my favourite car), but to no avail, I just could not find it, I
moved back into the middle of our room and decided to continue playing
cars with my sister, but before I did, I glanced back towards where my
favourite car had dissappeared, I still couldn't see it but I remember
noticing the name printed on the side of my sisters dolls pram.</b>
<br><b>It said "GRACE", to me at the time it meant nothing, and I went
back to our game of cars.</b>
<br><b>As we were tidying our cars away, getting ready to go and eat our
evening meal, my red Ferrari came tumbling through the air and fell virtually
at my feet, it spooked me quite a bit and I grabbed my sister and we left
the room at a speed.</b>
<br><b>I told my mother that my car had vanished and that it had fallen
from mid-air to land at my feet after I'd given up all hope of finding
it, my mother told me that my sister had more than likely hidden it from
me and then thrown it to me when she was bored with hiding it, but I knew
that this was not the case.</b>
<br><b>After our evening meal, we were all watching tv when my mum got
up to answer the telephone, she became very quiet all of a sudden and when
she got off of the phone, she told my sister and I that the old lady next
door to our home, who had watched us grow up, had died that afternoon,
we were all upset by the news but only a couple of years later did I make
the connection.</b>
<br><b>(1) The old lady who lived next door to us had lost her husband
the year before, the old man always bought my sister and I gifts for birthdays
and xmas, he had bought me a set of cars, of which my red Ferrari was one
of the set.</b>
<br><b>(2)The old ladies name was Grace.</b>
<br><b>(3) The old lady had died at ( in my eyes ) the time my car went
missing and I noticed the name "GRACE" on the side of my siters dolls pram.</b>

<br><b>Years later, I had the same feeling when I was in an abandoned house
in my community.&nbsp; I remember watching me and my friends walk around
the outside of the house.&nbsp; Next thing I knew, I was in the library.&nbsp;
I had never been to this house, so I didn't know it had a library.&nbsp;
My friends began calling for me.&nbsp; I panicked because I couldnt find
the door to the outside.&nbsp; Then someone grabbed my hair and slammed
me back into my body.&nbsp; The next thing I remember, I was sitting on
the fence next to one of my friends.&nbsp; He was asking me if I was okay.</b>
<br><b>About a month after that, we were again in an abandoned house.&nbsp;
I remember laughing at one of my friends because she was scared to go inside.&nbsp;
I told her I would be right behind her and everything would be okay.&nbsp;
Everything was until I decided to go upstairs.&nbsp; No one else wanted
to go, and they all tried to talk me out of it.&nbsp; I heard them in the
kitchen.&nbsp; I made it halfway up the stairs and was about to turn the
corner when I felt someone push me back.&nbsp; I tried to move forward
and this time was pushed down several steps.&nbsp; I twisted my ankle.&nbsp;
As I was hobbling down the stairs, I distinctly heard a female voice ask
me if I had ever gotten over the flu when I was 14?&nbsp; I started yelling
for my friends.</b>
<br><b>Now, every time I go into an old house, I am always aware of things
that have happened in the past--good and bad.</b>

<br><b>The Unwanted House</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: AzNiNvA5iOn@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I too have lived with a ghost in my home in Ohio. I had bought a
home there</b>
<br><b>and didn't know the history of it. I heard that it a widow lived
there all</b>
<br><b>her life and died there as well After about staying there for 2
days I</b>
<br><b>noticed strange things happening; things missing, items moved and
I heard</b>
<br><b>sounds coming from places around the house. There was one event
where i saw</b>
<br><b>an object move by its self.My phone moved about 3 inches to the
side. I also</b>
<br><b>felt that something was behind me or that i saw something at the
coner of my</b>
<br><b>eye. It was strange living there. After about a week, I tried to
sell the</b>
<br><b>house but, no one from around the town wanted to buy , even at a
very low</b>
<br><b>price. So I put a add on the internet and then after about two weeks
it was</b>
<br><b>sold to a family from Washington.&nbsp; I left and never came back
there again. I</b>
<br><b>dont know what happened to the family and never heard from them
again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Not Very Sensitive</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: estep@toad.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have not had many experiences with ghosts and do not think that
i am very sensitive.&nbsp; So far, I think that's a good thing.&nbsp; I
have had two experiences that I can't write off as something natural or
normal.</b>
<br><b>The first experience happened about 8 or 9 years ago, when i was
in middle school.&nbsp; i was lying in my bed and was just about asleep
when i thought i heard someone walk across my room and stop, standing right
next to my bed.&nbsp; no one could have been in the room because the door
was shut and locked from the inside, and the rest of my family sleeps upstairs,
completely across the house.&nbsp; i am the only one in the basement (we
live in a split level house).&nbsp; the footsteps sounded like they walked
across all the junk i had on the floor (a very messy room), like a plastic
bag, so it wasn't an echo from someone walking around upstairs.&nbsp; i
laid there with my eyes shut, afraid to move.&nbsp; when i finally opened
my eyes, there was nothing there, just a feeling of a thickness in the
air, and intense fear.&nbsp; i have no idea what it was to this day.</b>
<br><b>my second experience happened my freshman year of college.&nbsp;
a group of friends and i decided to go to an old, abandoned house on a
relatively secluded road.&nbsp; no houses are close by, and we did not
see anyone else on the road.&nbsp; as the house is set back pretty far
from the road, we decided to drive across the lawn and park directly in
front of it.&nbsp; i was sitting shotgun and saw a figure standing in front
of the house.&nbsp; i made my friend who was driving stop the car and we
just sat there for a few seconds.&nbsp; the figure looked like someone
wearing a black robe with a black hood, like an executioner.&nbsp; it started
to move towards our car and then the rest of the people with me saw it.&nbsp;
we booked out of there- it never got any closer.&nbsp; it was extremely
frightening, especially since i'm pretty sure it couldn't be someone playing
a trick on us, as the house was in the middle of nowhere, there were no
other cars around, and no one lives out there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Strange but True</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Lucifer2077@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>well, let me start with the fact that i have no religion. i've never
even</b>
<br><b>gone to church, but we do have some bible studies once a week. maybe
that has</b>
<br><b>something to do with it; i don't know. anyway, when i was about
four, my</b>
<br><b>brother and i used to share a room. we had a shelf that was full
of little</b>
<br><b>action figures. one time, my brother was spending the night at his
friend's</b>
<br><b>house, and i was trying to go to sleep. i heard a constant rattle
and i</b>
<br><b>opened my eyes to see what it was. what i saw freaked me out. all
of the toys</b>
<br><b>were shaking. i just closed my eyes until i fell asleep (about three
hours</b>
<br><b>later). when i was five years old, i saw a ghost. i was in the shower,
facing</b>
<br><b>the wall. when i turned around, there was a man in a brown trench
coat. he</b>
<br><b>had a brown hat on (like the ones they use in the mafia movies),
and his face</b>
<br><b>was all scaly. it looked as if he had been burned. he was holding
the shower</b>
<br><b>curtain open, and just looking right into my eyes. filled with fright,
i</b>
<br><b>screamed. when i did, he just vanished. the curtain was left swaying
there,</b>
<br><b>and i put a towel around my waist and ran out of the restroom soaked.
about</b>
<br><b>two years ago, when i was in a bible study, a tickle me elmo kept
on turning</b>
<br><b>on for about three times. at the end of the study, we always pray.
as we were</b>
<br><b>doing that, the radio tuned on for about five seconds, and then
it turned off</b>
<br><b>by itself. a lot of things have also happened to my family. when
my aunt was</b>
<br><b>young, she used to love to play with fire. one time, she was playing
with</b>
<br><b>fire in the closet, and she dropped a match. it wasn't lighted,
but when it</b>
<br><b>hit the floor, it was. the fire was blue, and it was shaped in the
form of</b>
<br><b>eyes. the weird thing was that nothing else caught fire. she opened
the</b>
<br><b>closet door to run out, and when she did, the match was there as
if it hadn't</b>
<br><b>been burning at all. my other aunt (also when she was small) was
playing in</b>
<br><b>the backyard in my grandma's house. the backyard was surrounded
by a brick</b>
<br><b>wall that had broken bottles all over the top of it so that no one
could get</b>
<br><b>in. well, my aunt saw a blonde girl that was about her age holding
a bat in</b>
<br><b>her hands. the weird thing was that the girl was sitting on the
brick wall.</b>
<br><b>the little girl asked my aunt if she wanted to play. naturally,
my aunt was</b>
<br><b>really scared, and she ran inside to tell my grandma. when she went
back</b>
<br><b>outside, the bat was rolling on the floor as if somebody had just
thrown it.</b>
<br><b>one more thing. during the bible studies, we pray to some of the
people, and</b>
<br><b>we put our hands on top of their heads as we do it. there was always
this one</b>
<br><b>lady that we suspected to be a witch. everytime she entered the
room, i would</b>
<br><b>feel dizzy or get a headache. as we were praying to her, we could
feel two</b>
<br><b>stumps on her head. it was as if horns were growing on her head.
we think</b>
<br><b>that it was the spirits that she manipulates that made us feel those
bumps.&nbsp; i don't</b>
<br><b>really care if you don't believe my stories because i know that
they are true.</b>

<br><b>Happy Mother's Day</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fiona_hayden@yahoo.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>First of all, my name is Fiona.&nbsp; I would like to begin</b>
<br><b>by saying that my story isn't scary.&nbsp; Rather, it</b>
<br><b>wasn't scary.&nbsp; It was euphoric, more so for the other</b>
<br><b>people in the room, as you'll see....</b>
<br><b>I went to University in the spring of 1997.&nbsp; I moved</b>
<br><b>into a house off-campus with two girls I'd never met</b>
<br><b>before, but we got on well.</b>
<br><b>The other two girls had their parents within a few</b>
<br><b>hours' drive of school, whereas mine were 2000 miles</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; So it was natural that I was invited to spend</b>
<br><b>Mother's Day with Judy's (name changed of course)</b>
<br><b>family.</b>
<br><b>Judy had an older brother who had drowned two years</b>
<br><b>previously at 28 years of age in a swollen river after</b>
<br><b>a big storm.&nbsp; She also had two older sisters who lived</b>
<br><b>thousands of miles away.&nbsp; One of her sisters had been</b>
<br><b>so far away when their brother died, she couldn't make</b>
<br><b>it home for the funeral.</b>
<br><b>They were all at Judy Mother's house (I'll call her</b>
<br><b>Noelene) on that Mother's Day.</b>
<br><b>We were standing in the kitchen, Noelene, Judy, her</b>
<br><b>sisters and myself, doing some dishes after a lovely</b>
<br><b>lunch, when Judy realised something.</b>
<br><b>"Mum," she said, "Do you realise that this is the</b>
<br><b>first time we've all been together in one room</b>
<br><b>since....?"</b>
<br><b>"Wow, you're right," said Noelene.&nbsp; "It's a pity he</b>
<br><b>isn't here to share it."</b>
<br><b>Here's the ghosty bit:&nbsp; At that precise moment, a</b>
<br><b>glass I had just set on the bench completely exploded.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;For no reason, it flew into a thousand pieces, making</b>
<br><b>a great banging noise which made us all jump a mile</b>
<br><b>high.&nbsp; Noelene burst into tears, but Judy just put her</b>
<br><b>arm around her Mum's shoulders and said, "Mum, don't</b>
<br><b>worry.&nbsp; That was just his way of telling us that he</b>
<br><b>really *is* here to see us together.&nbsp; We're a whole</b>
<br><b>family again."</b>
<br><b>None of us were scared.&nbsp; We just know it was his way</b>
<br><b>of saying "Happy Mother's Day".</b><b></b>

<br><b>Weird Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tooshort2000@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am not sure to say when wierd things began to happen to me. At
first they wouldn't happen very often, maybe once or twice a year, but
now i get a haunting experience about once a week.</b>
<br><b>I am very fond of ghost stories, and scary movies, so when I explain
the things that happen to me to my mother, she would say it's my imagination
and that i need to stop watching all those scary movies. Well the first
most scariest event that i can remember...I was about 12 years old. I was
always the first one to get home during the week, from school. So one time
i was in my living room watching TV, when the airconditioner turned off
and i could hear my sorroundings better, but it was normal for the airconditioner
to turn off by itself since we left it on automatic..Anyways about 3 min.
after it turned off i got this very chilling feeling, and all of a sudden
my eyes started to cry, I had no reason to cry, for i was not sad or scared,
and i had no idea why I was crying, it was just a very weird feeling, and
my eyes continued to let out buckets of tears, and still I had no idea
why. I went a looked in the mirror and my face was all red and my nose
stuffed up just like it is when you have actually been crying. So with
that i got extremely terrified, I went outside where my dog was, and brought
her inside. When my mom got home, I told her what had happened, she didnt
say anything just looked down. And for the 3 more months I got that unexplainable
urge to cry. When i told my little brother about it, it freaked him out,
and my mom got mad at me for scarying him, and he was too scared to sleep
by himself for about a week.</b>
<br><b>So for the next couple of months very strange things happened to
me, usually when I was by myself, but there was one incident when I had
a friend over, and we where in the den, and in the den there is the door
that leads into the garage. So we were in the den, when all of the sudden
the door slowly opens, then slams shut. my friend and I looked at each
other, and ran out of the room. Then i explained to her all the weird things
that were happening to me, and she really nothing to say to me just that
"how freaky"</b>
<br><b>I would always get the strange feeling that someone was behind me
when i would be on the couch, and turn around and no one was there.</b>
<br><b>Then when I went on my summer vacation to Colombia to visit family,</b>
<br><b>was when things really got weird....</b>
<br><b>At first it would be small things, like in the corner of my eye
Would see a flash of light, but then the images would get more life-like,
i would start to see small figures, like bugs, then one time I was in the
car&nbsp; with my cousin, it was at night, and as we were slowing down
to stop at a redlight, i saw a man standing on the side of a rode holding
up a sign, when i turned back to try to read the sign, there was nothing
there. I didn't say anything though.</b>
<br><b>Later was when things would start happening to my family too. One
time i was in the back room and i heard my cousin get home, i heard her
footsteps, and also heard her voice, as if she was talking to my aunt who
was also at home. so i walked out of the room, and went into her room,
there was no one there, Then i went into the kitchen and my aunt was there
cutting up vegetables, i asked her if my cousin had walked out and then
left, and she said she hasn't gotten home yet. And this exact same experience
would start happening to my Aunt and other two cousins, they would think
there would be someone esle was there and It turned out they were still
alone, we all heard each others voices, like if we were calling out to
another, and it would turn out we were asleep, or not there at all. Doors
would slam shut by themselves or open, the radio would turn off by itself.
So my aunt had had enough, and she called a Priest. So my three cousins,
my Aunt and I gathered around as the Priest arrived. He started praying
to us and blessing the house. Then each one of us would explain what each
one of us had experienced, so when I told him that weird things had been
happening to me for about 3 years, he told me I was the one who had brought
the spirits, he was an exorcist priest, and knew what he was talking about.
He said i might have a sixth sense, since i would see figures, and was
the first one in the house to hear werid things. And he told me next time
to try to see what they want. But after the priest left nothing else happened.
That is until i returned to the USA, after my vacations. After about 2
weeks of being back, in the middle of the night i would wake up by a very
cold cold feeling, and every time i would wake up the time was 2:26 in
the morning, so for about the past month i have been sleeping with my mom,
nothing has really happened again, but i'm not sure if what ever wants
me has gone away....</b>

<br><b>Psychic Family</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: asabear@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I come from a very psychic family.&nbsp; I have encountered 3 different
spirits at 3 different sites (other members have seen things too, but those
are their stories).&nbsp; The first was at a friend's home.&nbsp; She was
aware of the spirit but had never told me about her.&nbsp; I was sitting
in the basement family room on a sofa (in the location where her mother
usually sat) and heard a noise like someone was walking down the stairs.&nbsp;
I looked up and saw a foot in an old black button up shoe and the hem of
a long black dress.&nbsp; I froze.&nbsp; My friend looked at me and said
something to the effect of "You saw her."&nbsp; My reaction was "I saw
WHO?"&nbsp; She told me the story of the spirit who was connected to my
friend's mother (the spirit had told her that she was the mother's mother
from a former life).&nbsp; I was the only person other than her mother
who had ever seen it.&nbsp; The second occurance was in the presence of
the same friend but in a large cemetary in Lexington KY.&nbsp; We were
at the tomb of Henry Clay (the statesman) and I saw at the head of the
left hand casket a large black blob and it was not happy that I was there.&nbsp;
We ran from the tomb and I have not returned.&nbsp; Other people I know
(including my eldest brother) have been there and confirmed my sighting
for me.&nbsp; The third was very commonplace.&nbsp; I was walking to my
brother's home in Lexington from my classes at the University of Kentucky.&nbsp;
It was a hot day and I was very tired.&nbsp; I was walking along looking
at the ground.&nbsp; I noticed just ahead of me a pair of the old "granny
shoes", like were worn in the 1940's.&nbsp; I slowly raised my head and
as I looked up I saw an old, faded, floral print housedress and got the
impression of a face that was very tired, hair pulled back fairly tightly
and as I got to where I would have looked into her face, she was gone.&nbsp;
I just walked on and when I got to my brother's I told him about her.&nbsp;
I may have had others and not noticed because they always seem very solid
and real to me.</b>

<p><b>My Paranormal Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: stephie</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I realize that my name will appear on the heading of</b>
<br><b>my email, but I would prefer if you just put my first</b>
<br><b>name on the website, I have a very unique last name</b>
<br><b>and would like anonyminity.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;First of all, I would like to state that I am a very</b>
<br><b>average person but with high intelligence. If you were</b>
<br><b>to see me on the street, you wouldn't think there was</b>
<br><b>anything unusal about me. I am a senior in college and</b>
<br><b>will be graduating with a degree in English this May.</b>
<br><b>My point is, I am not the type of person to make up</b>
<br><b>stories nor do I have any unusal personality traits</b>
<br><b>nor any history of mental problems or drug use. The</b>
<br><b>only reason that use to possibly explain my</b>
<br><b>experiences with the paranormal is that I have an open</b>
<br><b>mind, and a very strong one at that. I think I have</b>
<br><b>been visited because of my ability to understand.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My experiences vary, and are scattered over different</b>
<br><b>places and different years. But my first experience</b>
<br><b>was when I was 16 years old, and it occured in my</b>
<br><b>bedroom at my parents' house.&nbsp; Like many 16 year olds,</b>
<br><b>I was going through a minor teenage depression. I call</b>
<br><b>it a slump. After I had been dealing with my</b>
<br><b>depression for about six months, I was visited by a</b>
<br><b>strange figure one night. I was sound asleep when I</b>
<br><b>woke suddenly, even though everyone else in the house</b>
<br><b>was asleep and there was no noise outside to disturb</b>
<br><b>me. At the edge of my bed was a white mist, floating</b>
<br><b>just above my feet. I checked the clock (this is how I</b>
<br><b>test and see if I am awake, if I can remember the time</b>
<br><b>in the morning, I know I was awake and not dreaming)</b>
<br><b>and it read 3:40 AM. I looked back expecting the mist</b>
<br><b>to be gone, but it was still there. I literally</b>
<br><b>pinched myself, but I was wide awake, which was unusal</b>
<br><b>in itself, because it usually takes me a few minutes</b>
<br><b>to overcome the grogginess of sleep. I watched as the</b>
<br><b>mist slowly floated toward the ceiling and dissipated.</b>
<br><b>Despite the fact that I had never had an experience</b>
<br><b>like this before, I was completely calm and unafraid.</b>
<br><b>I really believe that whatever the entity was, it was</b>
<br><b>watching out for me and protecting me at the height of</b>
<br><b>my depression. After this experience, I began to feel</b>
<br><b>better, and shortly afterward, shook off my depression</b>
<br><b>and returned to my normal, happy self.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Only one other experience occured at my parents'</b>
<br><b>house, and it occured about a year later. I took a</b>
<br><b>picture of my friends' car parked in our driveway, and</b>
<br><b>when the picture came back from the developers, there</b>
<br><b>was a large, white mist over my friend's car that none</b>
<br><b>of us had seen while I was snapping the picture. The</b>
<br><b>car had only been driven for about 30 seconds to move</b>
<br><b>down the street from her house to mine, so the engine</b>
<br><b>was not hot. As soon as I find the picture, I will</b>
<br><b>send it in to be posted on the website.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The remainder of my experiences have occured much</b>
<br><b>more recently. I am 23 years old now, and sometimes I</b>
<br><b>think spirits are drawn to me. Two months ago, over</b>
<br><b>Christmas break, I played a war-type game with my</b>
<br><b>fiancee and some friends. Being the only girl, I</b>
<br><b>really had to prove myself to the guys. We were</b>
<br><b>playing out in a field near a river and a house</b>
<br><b>belonging to my fiancee's parents. It was my team's</b>
<br><b>turn to hide, and I took of for a hill near the river</b>
<br><b>and hid near the brush with my gun (paintball-type)</b>
<br><b>ready. ALthough my teammates had seen which direction</b>
<br><b>I headed off in, I was hidden so well and remained so</b>
<br><b>quiet that they did not know where I was. I could see</b>
<br><b>all of my friends and/or their hiding places, but the</b>
<br><b>closest one was at least 100 feet away from me. It was</b>
<br><b>real quiet and dark on the hill, when all of a sudden</b>
<br><b>I heard a voice behind me say "Stephanie, is that</b>
<br><b>you?" The voice was so real I answered it, "yes, who</b>
<br><b>is it?" thinking one of the opposite team had somehow</b>
<br><b>snuck behind me to ambush me. When I turned around to</b>
<br><b>see who had found me, no one was there, or anywhere</b>
<br><b>behind me for that matter. Everyone was still out in</b>
<br><b>front of me in their original spots--I know for sure</b>
<br><b>because everyone came out a minute later, and everyone</b>
<br><b>was accounted for. This type, the paranormal entity</b>
<br><b>even knew my name. I lay there for a few more minutes,</b>
<br><b>but nothing else happened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The most recent experience happened at work. I work</b>
<br><b>at the university I attend, in a research center</b>
<br><b>devoted to a famous author, who died a number of years</b>
<br><b>ago. Because I want to remain anonymous, I will call</b>
<br><b>him "Bob." There are only three employees here, so I</b>
<br><b>am often in the center by myself. We have a storage</b>
<br><b>room in the back, with a smaller additional store room</b>
<br><b>with its own security system off to the side of the</b>
<br><b>larger room. Many times when I am here alone, I hear</b>
<br><b>strange noises like boxes moving around coming from</b>
<br><b>the store room--like somebody trying to organize the</b>
<br><b>mess that characterizes that room. I also hear thuds</b>
<br><b>as if something was dropping boxes on the floor. When</b>
<br><b>I have to set the alarm in the room, I have to do it</b>
<br><b>in the dark with the door closed, because it is light</b>
<br><b>senstive. A few times as I was setting the alarm, I</b>
<br><b>felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up, and</b>
<br><b>anxiously awaited for the alarm to set so I could</b>
<br><b>leave. The other day I was in the storeroom looking</b>
<br><b>for some photo files to match the photos in a book I</b>
<br><b>was holding in my hand. I was alone at work as usual,</b>
<br><b>and I couldn't dig through the file folders with the</b>
<br><b>book in my hands, so I tossed the book on a chair. But</b>
<br><b>the book hit the chair at a wrong angle, so I quickly</b>
<br><b>dug it out as I was in a hurry. This time I placed in</b>
<br><b>on a level spot where it could not possibly fall over.</b>
<br><b>About ten seconds after I turned around to look trough</b>
<br><b>the photo files again, I heard the book slide and fall</b>
<br><b>of its perch. I turned around, frustrated to see the</b>
<br><b>book back on the floor behind piles of stuff. As I</b>
<br><b>reached over to grab it again, I realized something</b>
<br><b>playing a trick on me as I noticed the title: "Looking</b>
<br><b>for 'Bob's' Ghost." Out loud I said "Ha, ha, that's</b>
<br><b>very amusing but I am in a hurry" and placed the book</b>
