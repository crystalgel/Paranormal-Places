<b>Spirits in my life</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: b.august@iopener.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Being a single mother of two, I had a lot to do at home, the house
was a two bedroom frame painted white with green trim, neatly kept yard
and large basement. My two year old son and fourteen year old daughter
played through the summer months, outside in the yard in nice weather,
inside in the den and their bedrooms in rain or fog, we had lots of fog
living near the sea. The house had been refurbished by a couple married
late in life, the wife a short cute woman in her forties, the husband thirty-seven
loved her to distraction, he built sidewalks and cut designs in to the
concrete and painted lovely colors over the sections creating a picture
of love from his heart, she had been married to a beast of a man, beatings
were a daily thing, she ran away many times but he found her and almost
killed her twice, while in the hospital recovering from near death after
another beating. An attorney was brought to her room,&nbsp; a sheriff brought
him and stood by and witnessed while she was legaly divorced and all her
money and property returned to her, she couldn't understand how this could
happen, bandages covered most</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;of her face, a skull fracture left her dazed, a judge entered
and signed the divorce decree, in a small town where her family had been
respected since the town was formed, they gave her husband a choice, sign
these papers or go to prison for attempted murder. He signed and was driven
to the edge of town and put on a bus headed to Mississippi with the driver
a deputy sheriff, there to escort him all the way.Her second marriage was
six years later, she had worked to get her life together, scars were on
her face and arms left to remind her love does not last, she met a handsome
carpenter, he began coming to her church, he began courting her, she was
cold to him, after all her friends and loved ones told her he was deeply
in love with her, she finally agreed to marry him, but he got none of her
money ever. He agreed to that, he had a good business, he worked building
homes and reconstruction of antique houses that needed the love his hands
created . Two years passed they lived quietly, he had many friends and
so did she, the cottage she owned needed attention, he began to do many
lovely things to keep it nice for her, the yards glowed with colors, different
flowers for all seasons, they lived there content, but she never trusted
him fully and told him so many times. The phone rang several times, she
was sleeping in, he and two workers had left in the big flat bed truck
to go to the city , one more day would finish a job there and the money
was good, he had an investment in mind, life was good. Two busses&nbsp;
traveling down highway 101, passed one another twice, one falling in behind
the other then pulling out again, they did this until the passengers began
to get nervous, the truck was there, nobody saw it come around the bend
in the highway, the bus had pulled out again, right into the path of the
on coming truck, with the happy manand his workers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
headed for the final day on a big job, with the good payday. She buried
him in the nicest gravesite she could find, she walked in a daze, she didn't
cry, she was all business, every body thought she didn't really love him,
she loved him. She lasted three months, she stopped eating, no water touched
her lips, she was already dead inside, she stood looking at the lovely
yard all blossoms of every color filled the whole area,the air filled with
fragrance, as she stood looking at a fountain he had placed gold fish and
turned on the lights built into the edge of the ledge he had put there
for her to sit and watch the fish as they flashed gold against the dancing
light as it touched the ripples of the water, she had loved it but never
told him . She died, her friends found her body in their bed, covered with
the silk bedspread they bought in San Francisco just last month. It was
easy to get into the cottage, she kept the doors and windows open so he
could get in when he came home. I was told this story by many people once
they knew I had moved my family into the cottage, I never thought</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;anything about it being anything more than romantic. Until
one night I saw a dark shadow standing in the bathroom, I rushed toward
the open bathroom door and pushed in, no body was there, I had seen a tall
heavy set form standing inside the bathroom, but no body was any place
in the house except my two children and me. That night some loud knocking
woke my daughter, it was coming from her closet, thinking it was her little
brother playing a game, she got up and tho sleepy and ticked off at his
silly two a m games, she opened the closet door, the kitchen light was
on, and light shined into her room, she could see clearly, nobody was there
but something brushed past her. She looked all over the house and got me
and her sleeping brother up to search, no door or window lock was open.Two
weeks passed, my daughter was in the kitchen, a pink mist passed thru the
room in front of her, that was the last we saw of any thing different or
unusual, it all stopped and we lived there two more good and happy years,
not a day passed that I didn't think of the lovers who never really exchanged
feelings of love for</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;one another, but all anyone had to do to be sure , look out
at the yard and the gold fish flitting about in the fountain while the
lights are shining against the rippling water.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Grandma &amp; Grandpa's House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: 1cartoon@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I live in my Grandparents house, after they passed away, I was
totally excited!&nbsp; I was on my own and living in a house on the river
that was so fun to live in.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I experienced some phanomanons
that really freeked me out!&nbsp;&nbsp; One day I was just sitting in the
livingroom, by myself, and I felt some kind of presents in the upper corner
of the room.&nbsp; I don't know why but I found myself talking to it saying
"I know you are there, what do you want?!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing ever came of it except for my knowing I was talking to my grandmother
somehow.&nbsp; Days and Nights went by and I still occationally felt a
presents (it is hard to explain).&nbsp;&nbsp; One night my boyfriend was
staying the night with me, and we were sleeping in what used to be my mothers
room (I would never go into my granparents room which was just in the next
room).&nbsp; After we were asleep I heard the sound of someone cutting
the window in my grandparents room.&nbsp; It sounded like someone was breaking
into the house!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes later, a shadow
of a man was peeking into the doorway of the room I was in.&nbsp; I was
so scared that I couldn't breathe.&nbsp; I really thought I was going to
die because there was an intruder standing right in the doorway of the
bedroom.&nbsp; The shadow was scarry because it was so tall, and stood
there for such a long time. I WAS SCARED BEYOND BELIEFE.&nbsp; (my boyfriend
never woke up to confirm the situation, and I really tried to wake him,
quietly).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was just like a scarry movie
where you try to wake the other person and they just lay there totally
asleep.&nbsp; The dark figure in the doorway was staring into the room
for such a long time, and then it just went away.&nbsp; It was days later
that I reolized that a burgler couldn't have entered the house and it must
have been an apperation because the window in the other room was undisturbed.
Then another day the sterio in the livingroom started changing channels
by itself!&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran to another room and called my sister because
I was so freeked out.&nbsp; She tried to tell me there was probably some
cause for it, and not to worry about it.&nbsp; I could hear the radio change
from one station to another, with the static in between, and I was not
doing it!!!!!!!!... No one could convince me that there was a logical reason
for the interference, or the way it was happening.Another time,&nbsp; my
sister spent the night with me.&nbsp; We had been so afraid in the middle
of the night because we , both of us,heard foot steps go from my grandparents
room, to the kitchen.&nbsp; Then the water from the faucet turned on, and
foot steps went back to their bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
reolizing that there is no possible way wood could creek in such a uniform
manor,&nbsp; we remembered how my grandmother used to get up in the middle
of the night to get my grandfathers medicine and brint it to him. Now,
it was not just me hearing these things, but some one else.&nbsp; I was
told that it is just the wood settled, but since I had someone else there,
and they were able to hear what I was talking about, I knew It was not
just my imagination. This house was still harboring my grandparents daily
routines!!!!&nbsp; People have moved into this place, and they have remodled,
but we have never asked them if they have heard anything out of</b>
<br><b>the ordinary.I wonder if they are still there??!!</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Granpa's Ghostly Eferdent Tablet</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: zumbars@fidalgo.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story happen to me in 1988. My grandfather had died, and his
second wife had moved out of his home. My parents,Aunt, Uncle and my two
year old Son went to his home for a final inspection before turning it
over to the Realtor to sell. The house was completely empty, and spotless.
I was walking around, remembering all the summers I had spent there, and
suddenly I just felt like my Grandparents were there, and were trying to
let me know they were. It was really earie. I said in my head, Grandma,
Grampa, if you are here, and you can hear me, give me a sign. Well I walked
into a bathroom I had just been in, and there on the floor, perfectly positioned
in the middle of the floor, was a denture tablet that had not been there
a minute before. I knew this was them, because we had always teased them
about how they looked when they took out their teeth, and they knew this
sign would make me laugh. I ran out to get the rest of the family to come
and see, and when we got back&nbsp; to the bathroom, the tablet was nowhere
to be found.</b>

<p><b>Ghostly Experiences?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gsuszkowski@dc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been reading all of these stories and would like to share
the experiences that I have encountered over the last few years.</b>
<br><b>My name is Greg and my wife and I bought a house in the boro of
Forest Hills, a small town just east of Pittsburgh. We have been in the
house since the spring of 1998. The house is approximately 80 years old,
as are the rest of the houses in the neighborhood. They were built by the
Westinghouse Corp. for their employees between 1919 and 1923. As one would
expect, the house needed some cosmetic work done before we could fully
move in. My wife Carla and I spent most of the month of June '98 refinishing
hardwood floors, tearing done old paneling, painting, putting in bathroom
fixtures and all that goes into refurbishing older homes. I know very little
of the history of the former occupants, but I do know that previous owners
did not have the best taste in decorating :) (Lime green and yellow trim?)</b>
<br><b>Anyway, shortly after we finished and moved in odd things began
to happen. The house has ceiling fans in just about every room. During
that summer we would go to work, knowing we turned all the fans off, and
come home to find one or more of thefans on! This happened on several different
occasions. My wife is a stickler for turning them off because of the fear
of fire and the electric bill. That kind of freaked us out at first.Passing
this off as our forgetfulness, we didn't think much of it. Then, I guess
the next incident happened in the Fall of '99. My wife was already in bed
asleep. I usually go to bed later than she and she has the habit of falling
asleep with the TV on. As I was getting into bed, I hit the remote turning
off Jay Leno, when all of a sudden on or in the wall behind the bed came
3 loud and deliberate bangs on the wall. They were very LOUD! BANG-BANG-BANG
just as the TV went off. It rattled&nbsp; the picture hanging on that very
wall, I remember this distinctly. I got up and searched the entire house,
basement and even outside. Nothing. My wife slept through the entire thing.
I told her the story and I think she believes it. I couldn't believe she
slept through it!</b>
<br><b>The floors downstairs are very creaky as you would expect in old
homes. There are particularly loud when going into the living room from
the dining room. Loud enough that you can hear them throughout the house.
Since the banging incident we have both heard, independently and together,
what seems to sound like a person walking between the rooms. This always
happens at between 3:30 and 4:00AM and just at this time. My wife woke
me the first time she heard this thinking someone had gotten in, but upon
investigation there wasn't anyone there. As a matter of fact I woke up
to the noise 2 nights ago, at 3:30AM!</b>
<br><b>Well, I'll try to wrap this up. I know I heard my name called when
I was showering one day, I answered thinking it my wife, but she said she
never said anything and was downstairs in the kitchen. I have also thought
that late at night while on the computer I have seen the typical shadows
darting just out of the corner of my eye and the feeling that something
or somebody else is in the room. I have also heard what I keep thinking
is footfalls on the upstairs hallway carpeting. The sound of shoes scuffing
the carpet. Maybe it's me or the old house settling or both. I just don't
know.</b>

<p><b>By: kpre@tir.com</b><b></b>

Alick's room he was in our grandma's.&nbsp; I couldnt sleep and couldnt
get my eyes off of the bedroom door, i saw a person about the same size
as my grandma come from the kitchen and look in the room. Well my grandma
had never left her room or i would have heard her, but anyways, i said
"Grandma?" and whome ever it was looked straight at me but it had no face
then it disappeared.&nbsp; Maybe a week after me and my mom was over for
a visit, i was out side, and the only ones in the house was my mom and
aunt Michelle.&nbsp; My mom went to the basement to put clothes in the
washer and my aunt michelle was going to fix something to eat, and she
had left the frige door open.&nbsp; Something walked past Michell and shut
the frige door, she thought it was my mom, but it was a ghost, my mom was

<p><b>Grandpa</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: corbymead@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever since I can remember I have been sensitive to paranormal activity,
which is something my grandmother says runs on our side of the family.&nbsp;
Anyway, in the summer of 1998 my wife was pregnant with our first child
and my grandpa was dying of cancer.&nbsp; It was a very stressful time
for me.&nbsp; I was always real close to my Grandpa, mostly because he
gave me my first guitar and taught me how to play it.&nbsp; This meant
allot to me because I now play lead guitar for a local band and have had
the time of my life because of it.&nbsp; My grandpa had got cancer when
my wife was about 5 months pregnant and not long after that his cancer
got worse.&nbsp; He was put in the VA Hospital about a week before my wife
gave birth and the only thing I wanted (after finding out the baby was
alright) was for my grandpa to get to see her.&nbsp; Out of nowhere my
Grandfather recovered enough that he could go home.&nbsp; He got to hold
her one time before the cancer took a strong hold on him for the last time.&nbsp;
The next Two months of his life were spent in agony and mostly without
any mental capacity.&nbsp; My Daughter was just about to turn Two years
old the next time I would visit him (his grave).&nbsp; My wife, daughter
and I went to the grave yard and I "talked" to papaw for about 15 minutes
before we decided to go.&nbsp; we turned to leave and there was a big dog
standing just inside the entrance to the cemetery.&nbsp; We stopped and
the dog just stood there, tilted it's head slightly and bolted the</b>
<br><b>other direction with it's tail between it's legs.&nbsp; We started
towards the car and my daughter turned around, started waving and saying
goodbye.&nbsp; I didn't think much of it till we got home and my daughter
(who can talk pretty good for a 2 year old) was telling my best friend
that there was a doggie and papaw made it go away.&nbsp; Hearing that made
me start crying right then and there, I'm a little misty eyed now thinking
about it.&nbsp; I loved my papaw very much and I'm glad that he got to
see his great grand daughter again.Sorry the story was so long, I hope
you enjoyed it.</b>
<br><b>P.S.&nbsp; I have allot more experiences to share, this one just
meant the most to me.</b>

<p><b>Haunted House...TX style</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cherie@ctesc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1977 or thereabouts, I moved to Kerrville, TX to be near my eldest</b>
<br><b>daughter.&nbsp; I worked as a map draftsman for a now defunct&nbsp;
map company</b>
<br><b>about 15 miles from there. Kerrville began as a small TX town founded
by</b>
<br><b>an ex-Ranger..was a&nbsp; rather cliqueish town, one department
store,city</b>
<br><b>hall, a couple of churches. In the 50's it became the home of a</b>
<br><b>silversmith who capitalized on the "hippie" movement's wearing of
silver</b>
<br><b>crosses.&nbsp; His business is now national and well-known. Kerrville
is now</b>
<br><b>much larger, in the Hill Country and a mecca for the retired Military.</b>
<br><b>I rented a small Victorian home, suddenly vacated by&nbsp; two couples
who</b>
<br><b>shared it.&nbsp; My job required me to be at work at 7 a.m., so
sleep was</b>
<br><b>vital.&nbsp; I was raised in a family accepting ghosts as a natural</b>
<br><b>phenomena, but they still frightened me.&nbsp; I am an artist and
was a</b>
<br><b>musician which probably heightens my sensitivity. If there is a</b>
<br><b>spirit..my initial impression is of a "shadowy" area. There was
such an</b>
<br><b>area in the kitchen in front of the sink, although there was a window</b>
<br><b>above the sink so it was well lighted. On the first night, my little
dog</b>
<br><b>and I retired...I have a habit of shutting my bedroom door.&nbsp;
Soon there</b>
<br><b>was activity outside my door,(the LR).&nbsp; Definite movement,
throwing of</b>
<br><b>things around.&nbsp; This continued each night until I began to
sleep on my</b>
<br><b>daughter's couch for a few nights.&nbsp; Her husband objected.&nbsp;
He's a</b>
<br><b>skeptic and I knew it wouldn't help if I explained.&nbsp; Across
from my bed</b>
<br><b>was a solid wall of casement windows.&nbsp; Not able to afford curtains,
I</b>
<br><b>hung sheets over these.&nbsp; When I came home from work, they would
always</b>
<br><b>be on the floor. There was a closet door in my room that would not
stay</b>
<br><b>shut.&nbsp; The last night I spent in the house, I dragged a heavy</b>
<br><b>bonnet-type hair dryer over to hold the door shut. The door creaked
open</b>
<br><b>in front of my eyes as I sat shaking in my room...not as soon as
I</b>
<br><b>closed it....but hours later in the middle of the night.&nbsp; I
began</b>
<br><b>sleeping in the car with my dog in the driveway,and&nbsp; trying
to find</b>
<br><b>another house. An older couple who lived across the street came
to the</b>
<br><b>door one afternoon and told me they had noticed I was sleeping in
the</b>
<br><b>car and told me the story of the house.&nbsp; It was built for a
lady by her</b>
<br><b>husband, they raised two sons there.The husband died.&nbsp; Later,
the old</b>
<br><b>lady had stomach cancer and was in a nursing home.&nbsp; In the
final stages,</b>
<br><b>she begged her son to let her go to her home.&nbsp; He lived in
another city</b>
<br><b>and travelled.&nbsp; She would be in pain and go to the kitchen
and drink</b>
<br><b>milk to ease it.&nbsp; She died in the kitchen and lay there for
days until</b>
<br><b>her son came to town to check on her. They couldn't open the door</b>
<br><b>because her body was wedged against it.&nbsp; She died in the "shadowy"</b>
<br><b>area.&nbsp; I guess she didn't want others in her home and sheets
at her</b>
<br><b>bedroom windows.</b>

<p><b>Silhouetted, hoop skirted, door shadow</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bpcoffey@gis.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My ex-boyfriend lived in a very old part of town in a house that
was</b>
<br><b>built in the 1800's.&nbsp; At one time, the home had been a stately
and</b>
<br><b>elegant one, with a long and gracefully curving stair as the focal
point</b>
<br><b>upon entrance into the foyer.&nbsp; Through time, and with the coming
of</b>
<br><b>rough economic periods, the home grew into disrepair and was eventually</b>
<br><b>sectioned off into a two family home. One side housed a family of
bikers</b>
<br><b>whose moonshine sent many a folk into orbit (we didn't have any</b>
<br><b>moonshine the night this happened) and in the other lived my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>and his roommate.</b>
<br><b>One night myself,&nbsp; my boyfriend Nick, Nick's friend Dave, and
my friend</b>
<br><b>Stacy, who was dating Dave at the time, were at the house.&nbsp;
We were</b>
<br><b>descending the grand staircase I mentioned earlier on our way out
to</b>
<br><b>enjoy our Saturday night.&nbsp; All was dark, except for the soft
lighting</b>
<br><b>coming from the kitchen which was illuminating the front doorway.</b>
<br><b>On the front door we saw the unmistakable silhouette of a woman
in a</b>
<br><b>long old fashioned hoop skirt like women wore in the 1800's.&nbsp;
She scared</b>
<br><b>the wits out of me and Stacy and we both refused to go any further
down</b>
<br><b>the stairs until the rest of the lights were put on.&nbsp; Chickens,
aren't</b>
<br><b>we?&nbsp; Although Nick and Dave were in a position to see the woman"s
shadow</b>
<br><b>as well, for some strange reason, they were unable to see her.&nbsp;
Maybe</b>
<br><b>she only liked women.</b>

<p><b>The Black Figure at My Bedroom Door!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ron78979@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've always been hesitnt to talk about this story, but what I tell
you is</b>
<br><b>true!&nbsp; In 1992 when I was seperated from my wife for the first
time I was</b>
<br><b>living at Old Farm in an apartment.&nbsp; One Saturday night when
my kids were off</b>
<br><b>to their grandmothers and my girlfriend who was a teacher had an
event to</b>
<br><b>attend, I found myself in my apartment alone.&nbsp; I rented a couple
of movies,</b>
<br><b>ordered a Pizza Hut, went over to the whirl pool for awhile, and
sat down to</b>
<br><b>enjoy a peaceful night alone at last.&nbsp; I was really looking
forward to a</b>
<br><b>night by myself!</b>
<br><b>When I was reading in bed, I noticed a black sillouetted figure
standing in</b>
<br><b>my bedroom door.&nbsp; The figure appeared to have a cloak drawn
over its head.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>could not recognize any features nor was there any attempt to verbally</b>
<br><b>communicate.&nbsp; I was wide awake and terrified.&nbsp; My heart
was racing and I kept</b>
<br><b>pulling the covers over my head.&nbsp; It seemed like every second
was one of</b>
<br><b>terror.&nbsp; The figure stood in my doorway well into the morning
hours.&nbsp; I knew</b>
<br><b>my eyes were as big as they could get.&nbsp; When the sillouette
disappeared, I</b>
<br><b>was covered with sweat.&nbsp; My hair was ringing wet.&nbsp; When
the sillouette</b>
<br><b>disappeared, I rushed out to the front room because I really couldn't
believe</b>
<br><b>it had left me.&nbsp; No, the only thing I had to drink was a Diet
Coke with</b>
<br><b>popcorn.&nbsp; I'm not a big drinker.</b>
<br><b>After the ordeal, I quickly showered, and raced off to go hiking.&nbsp;
I can</b>
<br><b>honestly tell you that no communication with the figure was made.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>would ask who are you, there was no response.&nbsp; This went on
all night until</b>
<br><b>by the grace of God it went away.&nbsp; This event has always effected
my life.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>know of another person who had a similiar experience like mine.</b>
<br><b>Can you tell me what was standing in my door, why there was no communication,</b>
<br><b>and why me!&nbsp; Have you ever had any stories like this reported
to you!&nbsp; Until</b>
<br><b>now, the only person I ever told this story to was a good friend
who is a</b>
<br><b>Catholic priest.&nbsp; It still scares me to tell this story!&nbsp;
Why was there no</b>
<br><b>attempt to communicate?&nbsp; And yes, when I checked my doors they
were all</b>
<br><b>bolted and locked.</b>

<p><b>The Front Door</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: francis.grogan@fmglobal.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My father loved the state of Maine. Not enough however to give up
his cush</b>
<br><b>job in Boston to live on the going wage of a "downeaster". So every
summer</b>
<br><b>from the mid 50's until I reached high school we would vacation
on the</b>
<br><b>scenic Maine coast. Very seldom would we stay in the same place
twice.</b>
<br><b>Usually it was some remote cottage located on the outskirts of some
tiny</b>
<br><b>coastal town.</b>
<br><b>A two week ordeal was in store for me with no TV or friends to speak
of. To</b>
<br><b>keep me sane my mother would buy me comic books and play board games
with me long into the night.</b>
<br><b>We'd been at this cottage now for about ten days and I was counting
the</b>
<br><b>hours until we would leave. It was a chilly August night and dear
old dad</b>
<br><b>had a few to many and drifted off to bed.</b>
<br><b>Our terrier "Joe" was snoozing on the carpet in front of the fireplace
and</b>
<br><b>through the big picture window the surf was like something out of
a south</b>
<br><b>pacific movie. The waves were gently breaking on the rocky shore
not twenty</b>
<br><b>yards from the cottage. The only sound was the revelry coming from
a cruise</b>
<br><b>ship that was passing off the point, in summary the night was calm.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly Joe jumped to his feet with his hackles up and growled
at the door.</b>
<br><b>I yelled at the dog to be quiet as he'd interrupted our card game.
In an</b>
<br><b>instant the front door blew open and with a bang it hit the interior
wall.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say nothing was there. Joe cowered and my mother's hair
moved</b>
<br><b>like it had been ruffled by some invisible breeze. The playing cards</b>
<br><b>scattered about and before we could take a breath the door slammed
shut and</b>
<br><b>Joe went back to his sleeping position.</b>
<br><b>We decided not to tell the old man as he wouldn't believe it anyway.
A few</b>
<br><b>days later we were filling up the old Plymouth for the return trip
to</b>
<br><b>Boston, and my father started gabbing with the local about his vacation.</b>
<br><b>With the windows of the car down we heard every word.</b>
<br><b>"So where did you stay?" The man asked with a maine dialect. "Down
on the</b>
<br><b>point at the Jensen cottage", my old man answered.</b>
<br><b>"Folks around here know that place well," the man said flatly.....they
refer</b>
<br><b>to it as the front door!"</b><b></b>
<p>

<p><b>Haunted In England</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: john.ligema@ntlworld.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is John. I am 41 years of age and currently live in the city
of</b>
<br><b>Lincoln, England.</b>
<br><b>During my life to date I have seen several ghosts and whilst I still
find</b>
<br><b>them surprising and fascinating I am no longer afraid of whatever
they are,</b>
<br><b>or appear to be.</b>
<br><b>I saw my first ghost at around the age of eight whilst living in
my</b>
<br><b>childhood home - a large Victorian house on the edge of Manchester,
England.</b>
<br><b>The ghost was one of a young boy of a similar age to mine at the
time; he</b>
<br><b>was leaning over the banister rail of the stairway landing outside
my</b>
<br><b>bedroom as I was making my way up to bed. The shock and surprise
of seeing</b>
<br><b>him sent me flying downstairs into the front room of my house; needless
to</b>
<br><b>say that none of my family appeared to believe what I told them
I had seen.</b>
<br><b>Although over the years I have experienced strong sensations of
ghostly</b>
<br><b>presence's, my next positive encounter was not until I was 22 whilst
living</b>
<br><b>and working in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in northern England.
I had</b>
<br><b>obtained the keys to a vacant industrial building which my firm
were taking</b>
<br><b>over. My job was to assess the work involved in converting the building
for</b>
<br><b>its future use. I had locked myself in the building (and was therefore
sure</b>
<br><b>that no other person was on the premises) and was proceeding up
some steep</b>
<br><b>and narrow stairs when I felt a hand touch the top of my head and
give my</b>
<br><b>hair a friendly ruffle - rather like an affectionate parent may
give their</b>
<br><b>child; I immediately turned round only to find the stairway completely</b>
<br><b>empty. Surprised, but not afraid this time, I continued my inspection
of the</b>
<br><b>building. We moved into the premises, and although I had my office
at the</b>
<br><b>top of the stairs where I had my encounter, and worked there often
late into</b>
<br><b>the night, I never saw, heard or felt anything unusual there again.</b>
<br><b>My next encounter took place right here in Lincoln, about three
years ago.</b>
<br><b>Walking our dog out late one night I noticed a cyclist approaching
me along</b>
<br><b>a side street.</b>
<br><b>I thought the cyclist appeared a little unusual in so far as he
was riding</b>
<br><b>an old style 'sit up and beg' cycle. His hairstyle looked rather
old</b>
<br><b>fashioned too, and most curiously of all he appeared to be wearing
an old</b>
<br><b>style Royal Air Force uniform. I could see the street light reflecting
off</b>
<br><b>the silver buttons on his uniform tunic and from the chrome handlebars
of</b>
<br><b>his cycle. He got to within about 30 yards of me when for some reason
I</b>
<br><b>glanced down for a second. When I looked up again he had completely</b>
<br><b>disappeared from the street, and there was no way in which he could
have</b>
<br><b>left the street in the vicinity of where I last saw him. I wonder
whether</b>
<br><b>his appearance was in some way connected to the fact that there
used to be</b>
<br><b>an open air swimming pool adjacent to where I saw him. This pool
was very</b>
<br><b>popular with aircrews during W.W.II, and I can only assume he may
have been</b>
<br><b>on his way for a midnight swim...</b>
<br><b>My most recent encounter was very brief, occurring during the first
time I</b>
<br><b>visited my mother's cottage in North Wales. Built around 200 years
ago, the</b>
<br><b>back room opens directly out into the rear garden, with the narrow
stairs</b>
<br><b>descending into the back room right beside the back door to the
building.</b>
<br><b>Whilst coming down the stairs I saw an elderly woman walk in through
the</b>
<br><b>back door and disappear. She was aged about 80, approximately 5
feet tall,</b>
<br><b>wearing a grey dress with long sleeves, a white apron and her straight
grey</b>
<br><b>hair was tied up in a sort of bun which in turn was covered by a
small</b>
<br><b>kerchief on the top of her head. She was followed immediately by
a young</b>
<br><b>girl aged about 10 or 12 dressed in a long light coloured smock.
Her hair</b>
<br><b>was long, blonde and straight, falling down her back. She also disappeared</b>
<br><b>straight away.</b>
<br><b>I have no idea what ghosts are, or why they appear. I do not see
them as</b>
<br><b>threatening, in fact on more than one occasion a curious sensation
of</b>
<br><b>contentment seems to fill the air after they have gone. I have noticed
that</b>
<br><b>my mind is often not thinking about anything in particular at the
times I</b>
<br><b>have come across them.</b>

<p><b>Haunted place?</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: WNYWitch@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up in Western New York and knew the local
legends of ghosts(the</b>
<br><b>Rochester-Durand White Lady, for example); I never really put much
faith in</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; I never had an experience until I left new york.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October of 99 I was transferred to Elyria,
Ohio.&nbsp; After a few weeks I</b>
<br><b>was asked to work in Sandusky.&nbsp; I accepted the promotion, but
having just</b>
<br><b>settled into a new apartment I decided to commute rather than move
again.</b>
<br><b>Halfway between Elyria and Sandusky there is a rest stop on I-90/Rt.2
just</b>
<br><b>outside Vermilion.&nbsp; I would stop sometimes on the way home
for a bathroom</b>
<br><b>break or rest a bit.&nbsp; It's a funny design, you drive around
and park in back</b>
<br><b>of the building between the building and wooded walking trails.&nbsp;
I usually</b>
<br><b>got off work after 11pm but it was usually pretty busy so I never
gave much</b>
<br><b>though to stopping there late at night.&nbsp; One night in march
of this year I</b>
<br><b>had stopped for a bathroom break.&nbsp; I noticed that there were
only a few cars</b>
<br><b>in the lot, it was a warm spring night, I wondered why more people
weren't</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; As I returned to my car I had this urge to walk into
the wooded area, a</b>
<br><b>stupid thing to do as it would be easy for a human assailant to
hide on the</b>
<br><b>trails.&nbsp; I walked in about ten feet and the path spilt to the
left and</b>
<br><b>straight ahead, I walked a little further straight ahead and felt
something</b>
<br><b>in there with me.&nbsp; I turned and started to walk out when I
heard a noise kind</b>
<br><b>of a lumbering sound.&nbsp; Feeling foolish and thinking there was
probably an</b>
<br><b>animal like a hedgehog or deer, walking through the woods, I looked
back and</b>
<br><b>saw a pair of yellow eyes on the path quite aways back.&nbsp; I
knew it could not</b>
<br><b>be an animal as only the parking area was lighted.&nbsp; The only
light in the</b>
<br><b>woods came from ambient light and the moon.&nbsp; I quickly closed
the distance</b>
<br><b>between myself and the parking area keys in hand.&nbsp; To my relief
nothing</b>
<br><b>pursued me and the eyes were gone or at least I couldn't see them
anymore.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>went straight home.&nbsp; The next day I felt rather silly, thinking
about the</b>
<br><b>matter during the day none of it seemed like it should have scared
me I</b>
<br><b>rationalized the whole thing.&nbsp; That night I stopped for a bathroom
break.</b>
<br><b>Feeling brave I decided once again to check out the woods and dispel
my fear</b>
<br><b>once and for all.&nbsp; This time I walked only halfway to the fork
and I felt an</b>
<br><b>overwhelming sense of dread building.&nbsp; I was not afraid in
the usual sense,</b>
<br><b>rapid heart beat, sweating, etc.&nbsp; I just had this feeling of
not being able</b>
<br><b>to walk any deeper into the woods.&nbsp; It was like the air got
heavier the</b>
<br><b>farther I walked.&nbsp; As I walked out of the woods the feeling
went away just as</b>
<br><b>it had come.&nbsp; I decided to come back on my day off and investigate,
during</b>
<br><b>the day.&nbsp; I had never been in the day and I didn't know where
the trails lead</b>
<br><b>or what was in the woods that attracted people to them.&nbsp; I
returned a few</b>
<br><b>days later with my jogging shoes, ready to explore.&nbsp; The trails
wrapped</b>
<br><b>around to each other and only totaled a 1 mile loop.&nbsp; There
was a ledge/cliff</b>
<br><b>area, but it was fenced off and there was no way to get down but
I could see</b>
<br><b>a stream in the distance.&nbsp; I didn't feel anything strange at
all.</b>
<br><b>Nonetheless I made it a point not to stop there after dark.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months later I was transferred to New Castle,
Pa, which leads me to</b>
<br><b>my next story...but we are still looking into it and it's a.m. now
so I need</b>
<br><b>some sleep.</b>

<br><b>Haunting in Central Phoenix?</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I don't usually share this with anyone since most people would consider
me crazy for believing in this stuff.&nbsp; My husband and father included.
When I was about 2 years old back in 1973 (I have very vivid memories about
my childhood and my mother confirms my memories) we rented an old house
about a 100 years old.&nbsp; It was there when Phoenix, AZ was not much
but a lot of farm land.&nbsp; There was&nbsp; a smaller house next to it
that used to be the old barn.&nbsp; It's still there today but surrounded
by huge mansions!&nbsp; Anyway, things were peaceful there until our next
door neighbor hung himself in the kitchen and my father found him.&nbsp;
I never knew about it.&nbsp; But about 3 months after things began to happen.&nbsp;
My mother was having an argument with my father one morning before getting
out of bed.&nbsp; She got real mad and got up and went to the kitchen.&nbsp;
She saw a man sitting at the table with his head in his hands on the table
so that she couldn't see his face.&nbsp; She turned around and went back
to bed not saying a word to my dad.&nbsp; Later I began to see a hand floating
in my room and would hear it "talk" to me.&nbsp; I called it (this is weird)
About Bugs but now I think it could have been Abbott Bugs or something
like that.&nbsp; As a child that young it was difficult to express myself
with words yet.&nbsp; I didn't have the word for ghost and would get spanked
by my father for crying at night when this thing would appear and talk
to me.&nbsp; One time I was sitting on the potty with my mom there to supervise.&nbsp;
I couldn't get off the toilet - like someone was holding me down.&nbsp;
My mother was pulling me by the arms to try to get me off but couldn't.&nbsp;
Finally it let go.&nbsp; Sometimes the door would slam shut and lock with
me on the other side and I couldn't get out - only the lock on the door
didn't work anymore.&nbsp; No matter how hard my mother would pull the
door would not open.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden it would as if nothing
had happened.&nbsp; At night you could hear scratching noises under the
wood floor in the master bedroom.&nbsp; Dad said it was just animals.&nbsp;
He crawled under the house but didn't find anything. He never believes
in this stuff. At night when I would go to bed (always fussed about not
wanting to go because I was scared) before falling asleep I felt like something
was trying to pull me through the wall!&nbsp; Sometimes I felt like I was
floating (like in another</b>
<br><b>dimension or something) and that hand ghost was there with me.&nbsp;
My mother finally had enough and made my Dad find a house to buy.&nbsp;
We moved and nothing quite as drastic as that ever happened to me again.&nbsp;
The new house had it's little incidents but</b>
<br><b>that's another story!&nbsp; My parent still live in the house they
bought 27 years ago!</b>

<p><b>He Came Back</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: melinda333@mail.icnet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My first husband committed suicide at the age of 29. Less than a
year</b>
<br><b>after he died, some strange things occurred over a period of a few</b>
<br><b>days.&nbsp; First, the thermostat had been turned all the way to
the right in</b>
<br><b>order to cut off the air conditioning. It was 102 degrees outside!
I did</b>
<br><b>not move the thermostat, and my daughter was too short. I asked
her</b>
<br><b>anyway, just to be sure, but she had not moved it. Later that night,
the</b>
<br><b>internal clock on my computer had been changed. The next day, upon</b>
<br><b>opening the refrigerator, I found the temperature to feel somewhat
low.</b>
<br><b>It had been turned down. It takes a screwdriver to turn the temperature</b>
<br><b>down on this unit. Sometime that afternoon, while my daughter was
alone</b>
<br><b>in her room playing, and I was hanging picture is my room, I heard
my</b>
<br><b>daughter talking in a way that sounded conversational, and not make</b>
<br><b>believe. I yelled down the hall,"Who are you talking to, honey?"&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>said that she was not talking to anyone.&nbsp; I heard her speak
again, this</b>
<br><b>time in more of a hushed tone. Concerned, I walked down the hall,
and</b>
<br><b>into her room. I asked her who she was talking to again. She said
no</b>
<br><b>one, that she had just been playing. I did not believe her, but
I could</b>
<br><b>not figure it out. The next day, when I was home for lunch, I felt
some</b>
<br><b>sort of "presence."&nbsp; I turned quickly to the right to see a
fading image</b>
<br><b>of light, almost in a static-like form. I felt like it was the spirit
of</b>
<br><b>my dead husband, and I asked him to please move on, that hanging
around</b>
<br><b>was just going to make it harder for our daughter and I to move
on</b>
<br><b>without him. I then left my house, skipped lunch, and returned to
work!</b>
<br><b>Once back at work, upon storing my purse in a closet, I turned around</b>
<br><b>and saw the same image again!&nbsp; About 20 minutes later, I was
standing</b>
<br><b>shoulder to shoulder with a co-worker, while reviewing paperwork.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, I became very dizzy, lost my balance, and nearly fell.
I</b>
<br><b>gathered myself together quickly, embarrassed and what my co-worker
or</b>
<br><b>anyone else might say. I said nothing to anyone to explain what
had just</b>
<br><b>happened to me. However, the co-worker turned to me with her hand
on her</b>
<br><b>forehead, and said,"Oh my gosh! The weirdest thing just happened!
I</b>
<br><b>suddenly got really dizzy and nearly fell down! It's like I was
spun</b>
<br><b>around or something!!"&nbsp; I just looked at her and said,"Oh,
really?</b>
<br><b>That's strange. Are you okay?" I did not want to tell her that I
thought</b>
<br><b>my dead husband just passed between us! That night, while tucking
my</b>
<br><b>daughter in (she was 5 at the time), she asked me if I had been
watching</b>
<br><b>her sleep the night before. I told her that I had not, and she stated</b>
<br><b>that she was pretty sure that someone was watching her sleep. Concerned,</b>
<br><b>I asked her if it made her feel afraid. Her response was no, that
it was</b>
<br><b>okay, that it felt safe to her. Within the next couple of days,
my</b>
<br><b>daughter told me that the day I asked her who she had been talking
to in</b>
<br><b>her room, that it had been her Daddy, that he had come to see her.
I</b>
<br><b>asked her to tell me about it. She said that while she was playing
in</b>
<br><b>her room, a wolf came in, but that she was not afraid, because she
knew</b>
<br><b>that he was a friendly wolf. She said that the wolf then turned
into her</b>
<br><b>Daddy, and she described every article of clothing that he was wearing.</b>
<br><b>She said that he said that he came to see her because he did not
get to</b>
<br><b>tell her goodbye. She said that he knelt down, hugged her, and told
her</b>
<br><b>goodbye and she told him goodbye. All of these things told me that
my</b>
<br><b>dead husband's spirit was lingering among us living folks. What
do you</b>
<br><b>think??</b>

<p><b>Haunted Office Building</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JayLee</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is not my story, but that of a friend.&nbsp; To give her a name
we shall</b>
<br><b>call her Rose.Rose works as a security guard in an office building
during the day.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>told me stories of how the building had housed labs for a nearby
University</b>
<br><b>and, even at one point, somewhere in the 30's or 40's, a morgue.&nbsp;
In the</b>
<br><b>labs they disected cadavers and performed experiments on animals
up until</b>
<br><b>the mid part of the 20th century.&nbsp; After that the building
was vacant for</b>
<br><b>several years, until it was converted into an office building about
20 years</b>
<br><b>ago.</b>
<br><b>Well on with the story...</b>
<br><b>One day when Rose was doing her routine walk of the stairwell (which
was</b>
<br><b>required of her), she got sidetracked and wondered right past the
first</b>
<br><b>floor and down into the basement.&nbsp; She opened the door expecting
to see the</b>
<br><b>first floor lobby and instead she saw black... the kind of black
that</b>
<br><b>instills terror.&nbsp; Suddenly she felt a gust of cold air rush
past her and</b>
<br><b>heard a voice say "Leave now!"&nbsp; Rose said she had never run
so quicky in her</b>
<br><b>life.&nbsp; Other people who work in the building express a fear
of the basement,</b>
<br><b>which is the boiler room and maintenance access to plumbing and
such.</b>
<br><b>Another time Rose had been standing in the hallway of the top floor
of the</b>
<br><b>office building and heard whispering coming from a closet.&nbsp;
She opened the</b>
<br><b>door to see nothing or no one.&nbsp; The closet was completely empty
except for a</b>
<br><b>broom and dustpan.She also told me of how the night shift housekeeping
personnel will not stay in the building alone.&nbsp; They said that they
would hear footsteps behind them</b>
<br><b>or see the elevators operate when no one is on them or even near
them.</b>
<br><b>Many people in the office building have heard a dark barking from
a first</b>
<br><b>floor storage room, but the only thing kept in that room is file
cabinets</b>
<br><b>and other unused furniture.&nbsp; Rose said that the room had been
one of the</b>
<br><b>labs. The most dramatic off all the stories Rose told me was about
the third floor</b>
<br><b>office.&nbsp; The third floor is mostly&nbsp; occupied by one company/department.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>largest office is at the end of the hallway to the left of the elevators.</b>
<br><b>People who work in the office have reported the weighted doors (the
kind</b>
<br><b>that have to be pushed to open and will close on their own) opening
by</b>
<br><b>themselves.&nbsp; Those doors are large and wooden with a glass
window in the</b>
<br><b>middle.&nbsp; No one is seen through the window when the doors open.&nbsp;
Also,</b>
<br><b>computers turn on and off without warning. Rose said that there
is also a</b>
<br><b>spot in the rear corner of the office that is always cold and the
feels very</b>
<br><b>damp, similar to how a cold, rainy day feels.&nbsp; But what makes
it so dramatic</b>
<br><b>is the fact that a ghost is actually seen.&nbsp; A blond haired
woman dressed in</b>
<br><b>1940's fashion walks through a wall (a walled off door), turns towards
the</b>
<br><b>front of the office, stumbles, and pitches face first through the
floor.</b>
<br><b>Rose said that there !</b>
<br><b>is a back staircase that runs from the first floor to the third
floor, but</b>
<br><b>that the staircase is walled off on the third floor in the area
where the</b>
<br><b>ghost disappears.&nbsp; Rumor has it that a woman had fallen to
her death down</b>
<br><b>the staircase and that is why it is no longer in use.</b>

<br><b>to find logical reasons for many incidents..sounds of someone walking..a</b>
<br><b>breeze when the windows are shut and I'm sitting in a part of the
room where</b>
<br><b>there shouldn't be any air currents. I once had a dog who would
bark at my</b>
<br><b>clock in the kitchen..some nights it would tick so loud I would
wake up and</b>
<br><b>close the bedroom door ( which was a bit of a distance away from
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen)&nbsp; My bank card went missing on a Friday night just
as I was about to</b>
<br><b>meet a friend and I spent hours looking for it..months later I found
it on a</b>
<br><b>shelf behind my clothes in the closet..my dog would become jumpy
and watch</b>
<br><b>the walls...the television came on its' own. I moved three more
times..in</b>
<br><b>one apartment the bedroom door would open and close with no windows
being</b>
<br><b>open..one night my partner and I were going to sleep when the door
opened</b>
<br><b>and then slammed shut.&nbsp; In my current residence..I hear walking
only after</b>
<br><b>I've gone to bed..there was a loose board outside the door way to
my bedroom</b>
<br><b>and it sound as if someone was rocking back and forth on this one</b>
<br><b>spot..sometimes I wonder if I'm being followed or am I losing sense
of</b>
<br><b>reality at times.&nbsp; I have suggested at time to whom ever is
there to go away</b>
<br><b>and leave me alone..I've been getting short tempered especially
when I've</b>
<br><b>been woken up at 3am knowing someone was in the room..I mutter and

<br><b>Haunting???</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LilGreenGyco@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>The summer after 4th grade, my parents and I had to move due to my
father's</b>
<br><b>business.&nbsp; We were from a rather large family, and the only
branch that moved</b>
<br><b>out of state.&nbsp; The 1st year went by without any occurrences.&nbsp;
The 2nd year we</b>
<br><b>were there, strange things started to happen.&nbsp; First of all,
if my Mom and I</b>
<br><b>were in the car together, or at home together, a strange perfume
smell</b>
<br><b>surrounded us.&nbsp; Kind of a fruity, flowery smell.&nbsp; My Mom
had told me it</b>
<br><b>smelled kinda familiar.&nbsp; It took a good 5 to 10 of these "smellings"
to</b>
<br><b>finally figure out where she knew this scent from.&nbsp; It smelled
just like the</b>
<br><b>perfume my great-grandmother wore.&nbsp; She died about a year before
I was born.</b>
<br><b>She had always told my Mom that she would look after her no matter
what.</b>
<br><b>When I was born, my Mom named me after her grandmother.&nbsp; She
was convinced</b>
<br><b>that this ghost had come to our new home to make sure we would be
all right.</b>
<br><b>Besides the perfume, we never had any "real" contact with her.&nbsp;
Doors opened</b>
<br><b>and closed on a regular basis.&nbsp; I also had an extensive stuffed
animal</b>
<br><b>collection.&nbsp; One day, before school, I had lined up the stuffed
animals</b>
<br><b>according to size.&nbsp; By the time I got home in the afternoon,
the toys were in</b>
<br><b>a disarray.&nbsp; We stayed there for 3 years, then moved back home
to our family.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Since then, we had never heard or smelled the ghost again.</b>

<br><b>frightening to me,&nbsp; I would see a ton of strange shadows that
seemed to</b>
<br><b>"run" away when I came down.&nbsp; Things would disapear and reapear
somewhere</b>
<br><b>else.&nbsp; I don't have any brothers or sisters, didn't thave my
dog than and</b>
<br><b>only lived with my mom.&nbsp; At night i would always hear strange
sounds right</b>
<br><b>by my window and from the basement.&nbsp; A couple times I heard
what sounded</b>
<br><b>like scrathing on the attik door.&nbsp; When my mom was walking
down the hall</b>
<br><b>way once the second she stood under the lightbulb and stopped it
blew up.</b>
<br><b>She didn't get hurt luckily.&nbsp; That same type of thing happened
to me when i</b>
<br><b>walk passed a picture on the wall.&nbsp; When i was home alone once
my cat was</b>
<br><b>on my bed with me.&nbsp; She was calm and purring.&nbsp; She doesn't
like anyone but</b>
<br><b>me and growls at people.&nbsp; Suddenly she stared almost straight
up and</b>
<br><b>growled.&nbsp; Her tail puffed up and she started shaking it.&nbsp;
I was terrified</b>
<br><b>and didn't look.&nbsp; She must have been doing that for about 2
mins.&nbsp; One good</b>
<br><b>thing I remember about that house was a ghost of my first dog casey.&nbsp;
When</b>
<br><b>my dad, me, and my friend came home with my new dog which was the
same</b>
<br><b>breed, we asked my dad if we should let him in cause we saw the
dog next to</b>
<br><b>my dad.&nbsp; Looking up at him and wagging his tail.&nbsp; My dad
said he already</b>
<br><b>did.&nbsp; We freaked out of course.&nbsp; Later I was happy about
it cause it was</b>
<br><b>the ghost of my old dog, I think.&nbsp; My cat had something else
happen to her</b>
<br><b>occanially.&nbsp; She would be (appeared to be) walking down a hallway
or in a</b>
<br><b>window and I would say "Hi Sam" like I always do.&nbsp; She would
continue on</b>
<br><b>her way.&nbsp; Then a couple minutes later I would hear her meowing
and</b>
<br><b>scrathing and she would be in a closet</b>
<br><b>the closest of the room i was in.&nbsp; There's know way she could
open it.&nbsp; If</b>

<p><b>Mysterious Ways-</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jbkioko1@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; and my husband recently moved into an
apartment that I</b>
<br><b>fell very much in like with so to speak.&nbsp; French Quarter apartments
are about</b>
<br><b>36 years old.&nbsp; The apartment has a staircase and&nbsp; bedroom
is located on the</b>
<br><b>top floor. The first night that we moved in we heard the sound of
wings</b>
<br><b>flapping .&nbsp; Like a small bird within&nbsp; an inch or two of
our ears as we tried</b>
<br><b>to go to sleep. We did not see anything and it was a very short
encounter.</b>
<br><b>Then within a few days more, our stove came on by itself? there&nbsp;
are noises</b>
<br><b>around the whole apt. and so we decided to take afew pictures.&nbsp;
I am catholic</b>
<br><b>my husband buddist.&nbsp; Well our photo of Jesus had an apparition
like effect to</b>
<br><b>it, I believe that it is either an angel or Mary herself.&nbsp;
The pictures at</b>
<br><b>the courtyard at my church have images of a pope or bishop and a
man appears</b>
<br><b>in the photo who was not there. I know that God can work in mysterious
ways.</b>
<br><b>I cant explain the supernatural though. I love where I live and
would not</b>
<br><b>trade it for anything the things that I experience although smetimes
I do get</b>
<br><b>somewhat nervous...life itself is so mysterious.</b>

<p><b>Lady and Her Dog</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: deblou@gvtel.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My house is haunted by the ghost of an 83 year old woman and her
dog.&nbsp; About 90 years ago there was a different house on this foundation
and it burnt down, but the old woman didn't get out.The old woman had a
terrier that she loved almost more than life.&nbsp; When the fire started
the dog got scared and hid in the basment, the old woman went down after
it because it was the only family she had.&nbsp; She hunted for it for
about five minutes</b>
<br><b>and by that time the smoke had grown so thick she couldn't find
her way out of the basment, was over taken by smoke, and a few minutes
later burnt to death.</b>
<br><b>She is still in my basment searching for her dog because I can hear
her every night around 10:30 pm, the time the fire started, clanging abound
on the pipes.&nbsp; I have even seen her on two occasions.&nbsp; The first
time was when I woke up in the middle of the night a few years ago, I heard
noises in the basment so I went to go chaeck it out, and I saw her in the
south west corner calling her dogs name then she looked at me and disappered.&nbsp;
The second time I saw her in my room because from what I have found out
my room is almost exactly where hers was.&nbsp; She came and stood by my
bed with a contented smile on her face the just disappered again.</b>
<br><b>I can still hear her sounds in the basement and often hear a dog
barking when my dog is silent right next to me.</b>

<br><b>Athens Ohio</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tracy_Conger@nyc.cohnwolfe.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Moonville (Athens, Ohio) -&nbsp; Moonville in located in Southeastern
Ohio, not</b>
<br><b>SW.&nbsp; It was actually a mining town, way back when.&nbsp; Though
the story you</b>
<br><b>had, may be true, I have another.&nbsp; Probably another variation.&nbsp;
I have been</b>
<br><b>there about twenty times.&nbsp; It is tough to find, as it is located
in the</b>
<br><b>Zeliski (I believe I have it spelled correctly) State Park.&nbsp;
It is a</b>
<br><b>national park ? complete forest - and not only do you have to watch
out for</b>
<br><b>the locals, but armed park rangers are also a tough deterrent.&nbsp;
The story</b>
<br><b>that I was always told was that the town of Moonville was infected
with</b>
<br><b>Cholera (I believe that was the disease).&nbsp; Most of the townspeople
were</b>
<br><b>dying, and they sent a local man to flag down a passing train, to
notify a</b>
<br><b>neighboring town, so they could get help.&nbsp; Legend has it that
he was struck</b>
<br><b>by the train and killed. His ghost still haunts the tunnel; supposedly
you</b>
<br><b>can see his ghost swinging a lantern trying to flag down the train.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>been there many times, and although I have never seen the specter,
I have</b>
<br><b>had the shit scared out of me.&nbsp; It is something right out of
the Blair</b>
<br><b>Witch Project.&nbsp; In fact, when I saw the movie, memories of
MV came rushing</b>
<br><b>back, and scared me ten times more than the film did.&nbsp; Not
to get into</b>
<br><b>great detail, but we had been sitting in the middle of the railway
tunnel,</b>
<br><b>which is about the length of a football field.&nbsp; It is huge..&nbsp;
The tracks</b>
<br><b>are gone, but the rocks and a few stakes still remain.&nbsp; We
had set up a</b>
<br><b>campfire and three of us were sitting there talking.&nbsp; It was
about 3 in the</b>
<br><b>morning, and due to being inside the tunnel, moonlight was scarce.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>only light came from the campfire.&nbsp; At one point, one of my
friends began</b>
<br><b>telling the "legend" to another.&nbsp; When he finished the tale,
he remarked</b>
<br><b>that he had been there many times, but had never seen a ghost.&nbsp;
At that</b>
<br><b>moment the wind picked up inside the tunnel, and blew the fire completely</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; If you have ever been camping, you may know how stubborn
some fires</b>
<br><b>are to extinguish.&nbsp; That is what I think about now when I recall
that the</b>
<br><b>entire thing went out like a match.&nbsp; We all jumped up, and
ran through the</b>
<br><b>complete darkness of the tunnel, for about two miles to where the
car was</b>
<br><b>parked.&nbsp; And were pretty much silent all the way home.&nbsp;
We returned the</b>
<br><b>next day to get our gear.&nbsp; And that was the last time that
I ever went to</b>
<br><b>Moonville at night.</b>
<br><b>Just a side note.&nbsp; There are acutally two tunnels.&nbsp; I
have a map to the</b>
<br><b>second, but have never been there myself.&nbsp; I also have pictures
of the</b>
<br><b>tunnel and surrounding area.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Cat</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: FireRam131@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I recently came across your webpage and have read several of the
stories so fa</b>
<br><b>r. This has prompted me to submit my own. I had a cat that I loved
very much n</b>
<br><b>amed Charles. He was a black cat that was very large. People who
visited would</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;ask if he was part Maine Coon. We had had him for several
years when he becam</b>
<br><b>e seriously sick. After several hundred dollars in vet bills I finally
decided</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the humane thing to do was to put him to sleep and let him
go with some digni</b>
<br><b>ty. Not long after that I was sitting in the kitchen after coming
home from wo</b>
<br><b>rking the nite shift I worked for the local newpaper. As I was eating
my break</b>
<br><b>fast out of the corner of my eye I clearly saw him walking past
me to the corn</b>
<br><b>er where we had put his food bowls. Of&nbsp; course when I looked
he wasnt there.</b>
<br><b>The second time I saw him I was downstairs in the tv room. For some
strange</b>
<br><b>reason I had the sudden urge to look behind me. By turning around
you can clea</b>
<br><b>rly see the hallway and the doorway to where youd enter the utility
room. Ther</b>
<br><b>es no way someone could not be seen going into that room. On the
left were the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;stairs. I clearly saw my dead cat&lt; his ghost> leap from
what would of been</b>
<br><b>the second stair from the bottom considering the angle to which
he jumped. He</b>
<br><b>then ran under my moms sewing machine just to the right but behind
the wall...</b>
<br><b>........I never took my eyes off the doorway. I never saw my cat
run from out</b>
<br><b>from under the sewing machine. If he had the only place he could
of gone was</b>
<br><b>the utility room. I even closed the door looking. IF he was in there
he</b>
<br><b>wouldndt of been able to get out. That the only two times I remember
seeing</b>
<br><b>him. I think he was just coming back to say he was ok :)</b>

<br><b>House Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pfontana@MAIL.HARTFORD.EDU</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've been with my boyfriend for two years. I've been stayign at his</b>
<br><b>house for those two years on and off.&nbsp; Often I would feel as
though I've</b>
<br><b>been watched but just htough it was my imagination while bieng home</b>
<br><b>alone.</b>
<br><b>so last summer while sleep ingover one night. I woke up out of a
sound</b>
<br><b>sleep and saw a dark figure come into the bedroom with a briefcase.
I</b>
<br><b>woke up my boyfiend and he saw it too.&nbsp; a couple of nights
later I</b>
<br><b>wokeup again this tiem saw a women encircled in bright golden light.</b>
<br><b>that was the last time I saw anythign. occationally I would come
over</b>
<br><b>and feel eerie but safe.&nbsp;&nbsp; WellI just moved into the hosue
permanantly</b>
<br><b>about a month and a half ago.&nbsp; SInce I've moved in. I've had
the feelign</b>
<br><b>of being watched whether it's day or ngiht.&nbsp; So the most recenlt
events</b>
<br><b>have been lsoign items aroudnd the house and then they appear where
I</b>
<br><b>left them an dhave looked a ton of times. They appear wehn I leave
and</b>
<br><b>come back home.</b>
<br><b>this past week has been the worst with feelign scared and uncomfortable.</b>
<br><b>I feel any room I go in I"M being watched and feel a presense but
not</b>
<br><b>see anything.&nbsp; Last sat I came home and went up the stairs
to go to</b>
<br><b>sleep. out of the corner of my eye was the bedroom. the door was
open</b>
<br><b>and I looked in. on&nbsp; the bed I saw a little boy sitting. I
did a double</b>
<br><b>take and he was gone. so I was definalte spooked considering that
is the</b>
<br><b>bed I would have to climb into alone in&nbsp; a copule of minutes.&nbsp;
so I had</b>
<br><b>a very sleepless ngiht and have been for a couple of weeks.</b>
<br><b>so in other words.&nbsp; in the hosue I feel something watching

<br><b>Houston Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Unknown</b><b></b>
<p><b>The location is by Fulshear, TX. Very close to Hunt Rd (About 15-20
min. outside of houston. Here is what happened. Me and my friend were going
out to see the japanees commet around 1998 (the one that was close enough
to see with a naked eye) and decided to get out of the city light to see
the commet better. We live on the west side of houston so decided to go
to the west (tward fulshear). We drove looking for nothing but a safe place
that is sucluded from cops harrasing us. We drove down the streets and
last remember driving down hunt rd. before we ended up at a dead end. We
got out a looked at the commet. There were fields on all sides but the
ways which the road ran with cows grazing. As we stood there, i would guess
about 10 min. we heard chatering in front of us. The noise seemed very
close, probably feet, and sounded for about 20 sec. then would stop. After
the first time we heard the sound I asked&nbsp; my friend if it sounded
like children in a play ground and he said he was not sure. Then a min.
later the sound accured again but from the rear right and was equally close.
At this point we were freaked by the sound because it did sond like children
in a play ground. If you can imagine standing in a play ground somewhere
off in the distance and listen to dozens of children play but cannot distinguis
a single conversation because they overlap and cut in on each other, that
is what it sounded like. Then after 20 or so seconds the sound would stop
then a minute later start from the left rear. This continued for about
3 or 4 cycles then stoped for good. At this point i was standing by the
car door trying to get my friend to leave and as he began to walk toward
the car i heard someone say help three times. I turned to look in the direction
of the voice and there was a house with the lights on. It was about 1 am
and this really scared me because I didn't know if the voice was someone,
like a convict from the prison down the way, hurting someone. We left and
sine then i have looked for this place about 30 times but have never got
to the dead end again. The roads have been changed or i am not remembering
the way we got there. However, I do know it is of 1489 and hunt rd. (south
of brookshire). I have thought about the sounds i heard and have talked
to people about it and many people say that maybe there were animals, like
coons, making noises. However, the field (by fields i mean low lying grass
due to the cows in eating) was visable from the moonlight to a point and
if there were animals in the field it wound have had to be enough to sound
like a playground full of children. And there clearly was not. Another
thing is that there are forests beyond the fields but it was about 200-300
yards and could not have sounded that close as it would have been an echo
sound and more faint.</b><b></b>
