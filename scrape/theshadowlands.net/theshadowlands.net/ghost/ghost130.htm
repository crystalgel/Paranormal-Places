<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>the story begins in what i believe was the spring of 1998.it was
a nice</b>
<br><b>day and my friend and i decided to go downtown.at this time i was</b>
<br><b>working at an historic site as a tour guide.the tall old structure
of a</b>
<br><b>house was downtown and since my friend had never been inside i easily</b>
<br><b>talked her into going.after making a quick stop in on my boss to</b>
<br><b>asertain weather or not it would be alright to go in there by ourselves</b>
<br><b>we waited for the tour that was already in progress to leave.now
let me</b>
<br><b>make this clear as possible,no one had ever reported any strange
or</b>
<br><b>ghostly occarances in the 120 year old house.though many had attested
to</b>
<br><b>the creepy feeling one would get when in there at night or when</b>
<br><b>alone.well finally we went in.i gave her a tour of the first floor</b>
<br><b>without a hitch.my boss came in to cheak up on things(he always
did)and</b>
<br><b>i saw him leave as we two prepared to go to the second floor.the
doors</b>
<br><b>to the place are always locked to keep strangers out.if anyone would</b>
<br><b>have come into the house i would have heard it.the floors are really
old</b>
<br><b>and creeky.my friend and i mounted the staires,which go up to the
second</b>
<br><b>floor twice,so to speak.the main part of the staircase goes up to
a sun</b>
<br><b>porch the you turn around and go up 4 more steps.we turned to the
left</b>
<br><b>to go into one of the rooms.i stoped to turn and say something to</b>
<br><b>her.from that angle you can see a portion of the hallway down stairs</b>
<br><b>including two doors.out of the corner of my eye i saw what looked
like a</b>
<br><b>big black cape like coat move swiftly into one of the rooms.i dont
get</b>
<br><b>easily scared but my friend does so i said nothing and moved quickly</b>
<br><b>into the room.when i turned to talk to her she looked scared i asked</b>
<br><b>what was wrong and she told me she had seen it to!after that she
was</b>
<br><b>freaked so i had to remove her from the house.but let me state with
this</b>
<br><b>strange object niether of us heard anything.....the room ironically</b>
<br><b>enough that the figure had gone into leads to the room a man died
in!</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>My True Stories</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tennfox@intermind.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had strange things happen around me since I was
little.&nbsp; But my</b>
<br><b>favorite story is the one my grandmother told me that happened to
her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandmother grew up in Warrington, England and lived
there until she</b>
<br><b>met my grandfather during WWII.&nbsp; It was about a week or so
after her sister,</b>
<br><b>Hilda, died.&nbsp; (My grandmother was the youngest of 9.)&nbsp;
It was late at night</b>
<br><b>and my grandmother was sitting at the kitchen table talking with
Hilda's</b>
<br><b>husband/widower.&nbsp; It was getting quite late and my grandmother
decided she</b>
<br><b>should head on up to bed.&nbsp; She started up the stairs in the
dark, thinking</b>
<br><b>she didn't need to turn on the light.&nbsp; She was about half-way
up, when she</b>
<br><b>decided it was really too dark.&nbsp; But insted of going back down
the stairs to</b>
<br><b>flip the switch, she leaned over the banister to reach the switch.&nbsp;
She lost</b>
<br><b>her footing and almost toppled over the railing when she felt hands
on her</b>
<br><b>hips steadiing her.&nbsp; She managed to flip the light on and swung
around just</b>
<br><b>in time to see Hilda running up the stairs in front of her wearing
some kind</b>
<br><b>of coat.&nbsp; My grandmother followed her dead sister into a room....there
was</b>
<br><b>nobody there, but the coat that her sister had been wearing was
hanging in</b>
<br><b>the closet, swinging on the hanger.&nbsp; My grandmother said that
she wasn't</b>
<br><b>frightened by this, because she and her sister had always been close
and she</b>
<br><b>knew Hilda would never hurt her.&nbsp; But it still gives me goose
bumps just</b>
<br><b>thinking about it.&nbsp; My grandmother and Hilda got into an argument
shortly</b>
<br><b>before Hilda died.&nbsp; My grandmother was so mad at the time that
she told</b>
<br><b>Hilda that she would dance on her grave wearing a red dress.&nbsp;
Hilda died</b>
<br><b>suddenly...there was no warning.&nbsp; But my grandmother felt so
bad about what</b>
<br><b>she had said that she never wore red again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm glad I got to share this story.&nbsp; My grandmother
passed away 5 years</b>
<br><b>ago.&nbsp; While on her death bed, my mother and I heard her calling
out to Hilda</b>
<br><b>and my grandfather as if they were in the room.&nbsp; I believe
they were there</b>
<br><b>to lead her to heaven.&nbsp; During that time, I always had the
feeling of being</b>
<br><b>watched from grandma's backyard.&nbsp; I felt there was someone
(not unkind)</b>
<br><b>watching me from the corner near the house.&nbsp; I was pretty sure
grandpa was</b>
<br><b>there (he died 3 years earlier)&nbsp; but I was possitive when my
daughter came</b>
<br><b>out the back door and she looked into that very corner, smiled,
waved, and</b>
<br><b>said "Hi."&nbsp; I asked her who she was talking to, she didn't
seem afraid at</b>
<br><b>all.....she said she was just saying hi to that man over there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>daughter and I were the only living people in that yard.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that my stories are not scary.&nbsp; But it
makes me feel better to</b>
<br><b>have some kind of proof that we don't just end up as worm food and
that</b>
<br><b>there is some sort of life after death.&nbsp; I have a few other
stories, but I</b>
<br><b>will put them in another e-mail.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for making a web site where people can share
their experiences</b>
<br><b>and feel that they are not so alone in these feelings.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>What To Do</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CHARMMSTR@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am an honest man. I'm not the one who lives for the excitement
of lies and fabrications, but i dont know whether to be scared or laugh.
I live in Tyler,Tx. the apartment ..townhouse ..complex I live in use to
be an old indian site. Which some parts as you may have guessed are burial
grounds. I am not for sure where or as to what part i may be living on..but
it is freaky. I have lived here since November of 99 and today is February
25 or something like that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Since we first moved in..we knew it was strange, but nothing
out of the ordinary. Noises got louder...sounds of water running came louder
and more and more...music stopping..starting on its own...voices chatting
at late hours of the night...consistent thumps at consistent times of the
night...This was getting weird or strange...but it gets even better. One
girlfriend notices a grey crown moving above my head a few times.. another
girl starts feeling presences..We challenged the spirits to do something
to prove themselves...well..they did.&nbsp; We came home from work on night
and a chair had been moved to the center of the room facing another chair..But
it was an out of place spot that no human would be in...the next day our
fridge door was open wide..no problem...the next day comes and we notice
an almost empty bottle of ajax liquid dtergent on the counter wit a spoon
that had gooey goo from the ajax. the deal is..we dont own any ajax...
and why was this on our counter like it was??? This girl is over and she
pulls the covers over her..and the spirits move the covers off of her...My
roomate and his girlfriend are lying</b>
<br><b>in his room..when.. something stops the minidisc player completely...rustles
throught the room with ambient light and thoughts of seeing a hand rustling
the clths hanging from the ceilings are seen....They start making more
noticable noises upstairs when we are downstairs...and then tonight...a
few of us are on the couch watching a movie when....i feel someone tapping
me on the shoulder..but the thing is..it didntfeel like a normal tap of
a human..and there was no possible way that anyone could have done this
to me. I jumped and cussed the spirit.It</b>
<br><b>scared the hell out of me.I left the scene for a few and went back
with a native american talking stick and told them that i wasnt scared&nbsp;
of them...Just dont touch me..and we could get along fine..if they wouldnt
touch me..What to do??Please..I cant let go of this feeling and i want
to.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: THEBORG@erinet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>to whom it may concern,i had an experience while i was sleeping and
i dont know if it was a ghost or an angel.i had a dream that i was in bed
with the covers pulled up over me because i was scared.like i use to do
when i was a kid.i remember the window on the left the dresser and door
to my right and the closet with a light on facing me.a person came in the
door. i felt it was a woman.she walked around the bed watched me sleep.all
the while i had the covers pulled up and my eyes closed.i could see her
through my closed eyes.her aura.my legs were paralyzed from fear in my
dream.i told her in my head to go away your scaring me.she said dont be
scared i wont hurt you.she did leave,after i said something in my mind.but
when she opened the door to leave i got up enough courage to open my eyes.i
saw a woman dressed in 1800's clothes.with her dress that goes all the
way to the bottom and all the way up her collar and wrist.but she was silhouetted
(she was all black) and this white glow was all around her.then i woke
up.i found myself still paralyzed and couldn't remember where i was for
awhile.&nbsp; i later had to get up for work and went to work for an 8
hour day. came home remembered everything about the dream and drew it on
paper.that</b>
<br><b>happened 8 years ago and i still remember it.very unusual for me.what
do you think it was. just my over active imagination or something else.&nbsp;
would love to know what you think.been wondering about it ever since.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Hot Quarter</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: DrakeKLDrake@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a strange experience back in October
of 99. I have a desk in my</b>
<br><b>bedroom where I like to spend my quiet time. It is in the corner
of my</b>
<br><b>bedroom,and looks out my window.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day
as I was sitting there, a quarter fell straight down from the</b>
<br><b>ceiling onto my desk. It was hot!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got
up and went to my bedroom door, which was closed. I opened it and</b>
<br><b>walked out. My husband and daughter were both sitting in the living
room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I questioned them closely about the quarter,
and they both denied any</b>
<br><b>knowledge of it. I believe I would have heard the door open or shut
if one of</b>
<br><b>them had threw it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it fell straight
down, not at a angle or any thing. And it was hot</b>
<br><b>to the touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weird, huh?</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My frien d chris ,his brother,the cat,and I are

into space (</b>
<br><b>this was after i became a wierdness "magnet " and I&nbsp; think
that was a factor</b>
<br><b>in this all ) , and then i decided to make fun of ghosts , which
at the time</b>
<br><b>was funny to me&nbsp; ,&nbsp; and then it happened...a bloodcurtling
scream rang out in</b>
<br><b>the hallway, right outside the door! and we knew it was no joke
because no</b>
<br><b>one else was home ,and because of the shaking bodies that were us</b>
<br><b>...something was shaking us. and then with a bang the door flew

<p><b>By: Candyapplezzz@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My experiences started when I was about 3 years old, we lived in
a very small</b>
<br><b>old house in Paso Robles Ca.&nbsp; My dad told me when when I was
older things</b>
<br><b>that happened in this house.&nbsp; I would go in to my parents room
to the closet</b>
<br><b>and point to the corner and cry, they couldn't see anything but
I guess I</b>
<br><b>could but do not remember what.&nbsp; My dad told me he could hear
foot steps</b>
<br><b>outside his window on the gravel, look out and know one was there.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I joined the navy in 1985 and got married shortly after that, we
moved to an</b>
<br><b>apt. in Chula vista Ca. and had a baby.&nbsp; We had a two bedroom
apt., things</b>
<br><b>started happening when the baby was young.&nbsp; Her bedroom was
always Ice cold</b>
<br><b>even during the summer.&nbsp; I opened the blinds during the day
and closed them</b>
<br><b>at night, but every mourning they would be open when I went into
the room.</b>
<br><b>My baby cried all the time when she was in there, she hated that
room. We</b>
<br><b>moved!!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>We moved to New Port Richey Florida in 1990, lived in another apt.had
another</b>
<br><b>baby and things still were happening.&nbsp; I never felt comfortable
there.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>would see black things dart in the corner of my eye, coldness in
certain</b>
<br><b>parts of the house.&nbsp; My neighbor upstairs had books fly off
her dresser and</b>
<br><b>door knobs turn, knocking on the doors.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Then we bought a house, the lady we bought it from, her husband died
in one</b>
<br><b>of the rooms, the room was off the kicthen, my son would sit in
his highchair</b>
<br><b>with his hands covering his face and then peek out and point to
the corner of</b>
<br><b>the room that the man died in.&nbsp; I got the chance to talk to
this lady again</b>
<br><b>and she said her husbands favorite chair was in that corner that
my son was</b>
<br><b>pointing to.&nbsp; I believe the old man's spirit was sitting there.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Then I moved to South America and we lived in an apt. that had wood
floors</b>
<br><b>and wood furniture.&nbsp; We were walking to the kicthen when my
husband said "</b>
<br><b>Did you see that?", you got to understand my husband dosen't beleive
in</b>
<br><b>anything he can't explain or see.&nbsp; Of course I didn't, he said
the chair</b>
<br><b>pulled out by itself and moved the table slighty.&nbsp; We moved
once again back</b>
<br><b>to the states.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My sister in law see's a women in her bedroom at night, and shadows
on her</b>
<br><b>walls.</b>
<br><b>My brother in law see's a man in a dark cloak on the streets all
the time.</b>
<br><b>My Friend lived in a house where she would see a man walk up her
walkway and</b>
<br><b>ring her bell, but, noone is there.&nbsp; She says this happens
twice a day,</b>
<br><b>everyday.</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Experiences Happening all the Time</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cdarl@ctelcom.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello ,, my name is don and i have a few stories to share with all
you ghost hunters and readers.</b>
<br><b>Here is the first one ..It was back in 1995 and i was living in
seattle washington at the time.I was around the age of 22. it was forth
of july and i was with my girl friend. at the time i was into the gothic
scene and so was my girl. we used to go and visit the cemetary around the
seattle area with friends and by our selves. one of them was the cemetary
close by capital hill in seattle. capital hill being a famous art and music
area for a freaks geaks and stoners. This cemetary was very special since
brandon lee and his father were burried there. well</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;this 4th of jusly night my girl and i were extreamly bored
and we had a few crakers with us. and we had the greated idea to spend
the rest of the 4th of july night at that cemetary with brandon and all
his new friends in that cemetary close by capital hill in seattle washington.&nbsp;&nbsp;
so we went and tress passed of course. i tmust of ben around 8 or 9 pm.
and we safely succeeded this plan and project. parking the car far away
so no one would get the idead of tresspassers. we got in the cemetary and
had a good time ..letting of lady fingers., spinners , a few</b>
<br><b>smal rockets and other colorful crackers. to my opinon we were sharing
this fine day with the dead,and we both had and i still have no guilt on
doing this.actualy i think it was very nice,but you couldnt explain that
to the cops. so my girl and i and about 1000 dead people including brandon
and his father enjoyed the forth of july as well. after celebrateing this
we took a rest on a popular grassy family knoll my girl and i used to have
picnics at ,,during the day of course.we kissed and talked and laughed
about all sorts of things and had alot of</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;respect of our surroundings,,in fact the dead must have been
quite used to us cause we visited this quite often bringing flowers and
gifts to brandon his father and other fav graves that caught our interests
and spirit. so while we were hanging there just sitting there not so much
in the dark since there was moon light giving us serenity. my girl caught
a glimpse of a lady running about from tree to tree and from bush to bush
and from grave stone to grave stone. watching us. and peeking over every
obstacle in it s way. well i ahd to see this for my self, and with a little
trust and belief i saw thsi my self..WITH MY OWN EYES. i actualy saw a
womennning about 50 feet away from us and this grassy hill knoll thing..there
was a road that wrap around this knoll and led up and around other knolls
and to the front of the gate. it was quite intersting and cool. to see
this. we just laughed and smiled..we had the idead that this lady was very
interested in us&nbsp; since we problay woke them all up.. we were not
high or drunk at the time of this sighting..about an hour passed and then
we were very startled to see a car soming around this road that was even
closer that the lady was. it even had a spotlight shinning all over the
cemetary . and the</b>
<br><b>spot light was headed our way. the car drove right passed us and
the spotlight even was on us for more than 3 secs enough time to see us
.a bigh ole spot light ,, and the car kept going, this was a cop car and
for sure the cop would of saw us and stop and took us to jail for all sorts
of arogant charges. but he or she did not and kept going . we had came
to the concluison that the ghosts in the cemetary had protected us from
the cops light and made us invisibla so we would not get caught. cause
for a fact the cop would of stoped . we were ver y scared</b>
<br><b>from this and we left soon after wards not testing the situation
any more..the ghosts did not bother us at all but the cops did ,,and that
was the last thing i wanted to do was go to jail and pay for a big ol ticket.</b>
<br><b>there is another story ..i was living in fort wort at the time and
iwas about the age of 9 or 10. a friend ad&nbsp; i was walking down our
street in our neiborhood. this was wabout 81 or 82. w e had walked passed
our neiborhood play ground which was very spooky at night cause there was
a huge land of tress behind it and in the day time we had forts and trailsthat
led every where and there were many tales of a ghost man that lived deep
in the woods in a old abandoned house. well any ways we walked passed it
and something caught my eye. i saw a swing on a swing set just swinging
by it self, like a kid was on it or something, and it was not windy what
so ever ..well i pointed out this to my friend and we were extreamly spooked
by this. and we step closer,, ther were streets lamps the light the street
so we could see this very well. and the closer we got we could both see
there was soemthing very small that was sitting in this swing while it
was swinging. it&nbsp; must have been about a foot and half foot tall.
and it was balck and very small. not the size of a child . and it was jsut
swinging away like nothing i picked up a rock and threw it at the the swing
. it hit the metal park and a big CLANG came out of that and with this
noise, that little</b>
<br><b>black thing jumped off and ran back in to the forest. we freaked
and ran off and never stoped unti lwe got to my house. now i figured it
must have been some kind of creature from beyound having a goodimewith
the swings. it must have watch the other children and wanted to try this
. i feel kind of sory for it now.. i would hope later on it came back out
to enjoy a nice swing on the set late at night.well my mom and her sister
when they were kids use to hear a female voice calling their names out
loud at their home and it was nothing alive they did all the investigating
. my father and his friend saw a a green glowing haze form int oa face
and then laugh at them in the</b>
<br><b>dark long ago and he saw many other ghosts in his life. my grand
mother and grand father in the 1950's saw a ufo take off from ground way
up north texas. my brother has seen many ghosts in his room and stuff.</b>
<br><b>i have many dreams of people like a little girl that was killed,,n
my dreams talking to me telling me that she is alright and that i am to.
and the way i talk to her is by anserwing a toy telephone in this dream.</b>
<br><b>i guess in my dreams i can talk to the dead and communicate with
them. i had one the other day .</b>
<br><b>and every now and then i see children in the corner of my eye, and
then disapere. the other day my new girl friend and i went ghost hunting
taking pics in the cemetary here in fort worth hope ing to catch some stuff
on film and we ask for their permisson and said our prayers and all that
. the phone rings alot with no answer on the other line. i hear knocking
and sounds in my home with no one here. sometimes i hear people calling
my name . and once i heard just out side my windown or what i thought was
outside my window it could have been in my room or in a</b>
<br><b>the other dimension a littlegirlher dad what i was doing and he
told her i was scrathing my head, and it had been about 20 min seicne i
woke up and i was laying there in my room and i had to scratch my head
cause it itch and i heard this, and i looked out side my window and no
one was there. and there was no little girl in my room or my home.i have
had a death exprience once and since then i have been more sencesitve to
all this.</b>
<br><b>most of the things that have happened to me other than the minie
me ghost playing on the swing i never get scared from it . well i hope
you enjoy my stories and share this with othersand have good life and a
great millenium thanks ,,DON 2000 feburay 29</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Was it a ghost?</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: lindaspc@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>My story goes back some six or seven years now.&nbsp; Let</b>
<br><b>me preface it by saying that at the time I had been</b>
<br><b>having some instances of precognition and had decided</b>
<br><b>to investigate what might be causing this.&nbsp; My next</b>
<br><b>step would have been to see a medical doctor, because</b>
<br><b>it kind of scared me and I really wanted an</b>
<br><b>explanation.&nbsp; As it turns out, I learned that having</b>
<br><b>been struck by lightning some years before, and also</b>
<br><b>having had a grandmother, aunt and cousin who were</b>
<br><b>"intuitives" gave me a predisposition for psychic</b>
<br><b>ability.</b><b></b>
<p><b>At any rate, in early 1994 a good friend of mine was</b>
<br><b>in the hospital in a coma.&nbsp; He had become ill suddenly</b>
<br><b>and refused to see a doctor until he was unable to</b>
<br><b>resist and his family had him taken to the hospital by</b>
<br><b>ambulance.&nbsp; He slipped into the coma on the way.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband and I went to visit, and naturally spent</b>
<br><b>our time talking with his wife (who was by his side</b>
<br><b>every evening during his 4-month stay in the</b>
<br><b>hospital).&nbsp; From time to time I would wander over to</b>
<br><b>his bed and pat his leg or rub his arm -- not really</b>
<br><b>knowing if he was still in his body or not.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When he finally woke up (about 11 weeks into his stay)</b>
<br><b>we went to visit again.&nbsp; He told me that he had kept</b>
<br><b>having a dream in which I was a nurse and came to his</b>
<br><b>room to help him.&nbsp; My friend eventually got well</b>
<br><b>enough to come home, but never really seemed to regain</b>
<br><b>his strength.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I drove by their house every day on my way home from</b>
<br><b>work, and one day, about 9 or 10 months after he</b>
<br><b>returned from the hospital I started to turn on the</b>
<br><b>street that would take me past there.&nbsp; A voice in my</b>
<br><b>head said, "No, don't go that way.&nbsp; Ben is dead."&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had such an awful feeling in my stomach that I didn't</b>
<br><b>make the turn and took another way home.&nbsp; When I got</b>
<br><b>home, the answering machine light was flashing, and I</b>
<br><b>knew it would be Ben's wife telling me that he was</b>
<br><b>gone.&nbsp; I played the message, and sure enough, Ben had</b>
<br><b>died about an hour earlier, a massive heart attack.</b>
<br><b>The ambulance had just taken his body away.&nbsp; I would</b>
<br><b>have seen it if I had gone down the usual street.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I didn't question why I had known these things, but</b>
<br><b>went on learning more about metaphysics and trying to</b>
<br><b>train my abilities.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night, about a year after Ben's death, I had a</b>
<br><b>dream that I was sitting in my car on the side of a</b>
<br><b>road.&nbsp; I saw Ben walking toward my car from the</b>
<br><b>opposite way.&nbsp; I looked at him and thought, 'What's</b>
<br><b>Ben doing here?&nbsp; Doesn't he know he's dead?'&nbsp; He came</b>
<br><b>up to my window and told me that he was looking for a</b>
<br><b>light.&nbsp; I checked in my glove compartment and under my</b>
<br><b>seat and on my key ring looking for a light of some</b>
<br><b>kind that I could give to him, but nothing I found was</b>
<br><b>right.&nbsp; I asked him to be more specific, but he said</b>
<br><b>he wasn't sure what it was he needed, all he knew was</b>
<br><b>that he had to find a light.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of course, when I woke up and thought about the dream</b>
<br><b>I knew what "light" he was referring to.&nbsp; Over the</b>
<br><b>next six months I researched things that could be done</b>
<br><b>for those who had passed over to the other side.</b>
<br><b>Eventually I found a nice candle/prayer ceremony which</b>
<br><b>I performed for my friend Ben.&nbsp; In it I asked that he</b>
<br><b>be shown the light and the way to go towards it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>About a week after the ceremony I had another dream.</b>
<br><b>In this dream, I was seated on my living room couch</b>
<br><b>and Ben came in and sat down beside me.&nbsp; I started to</b>
<br><b>tell him that I had performed this ceremony for him</b>
<br><b>(by this time it seemed normal in my dreams to talk</b>
<br><b>with Ben even though I knew he was dead), but before I</b>
<br><b>could say more than a couple of words he burst into</b>
<br><b>tears of pure joy!&nbsp; He thanked me, he said he had had</b>
<br><b>no idea of what had been awaiting him while he spent</b>
<br><b>time between worlds.&nbsp; He was so happy and so grateful</b>
<br><b>that I cried with him.&nbsp; When I woke up, I had the</b>
<br><b>dried tears on my cheeks to prove it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was visiting his wife a couple of months after the</b>
<br><b>time of last dream.&nbsp; I didn't tell her about any of</b>
<br><b>this, because I was afraid she would think I was</b>
<br><b>crazy.&nbsp; She told me that she had frequently seen Ben</b>
<br><b>around the house 'out of the corner of her eye', but</b>
<br><b>when she turned to look directly at him, he would be</b>
<br><b>gone.&nbsp; She thought she heard him calling, or smelled</b>
<br><b>his cigarette smoke -- and her mother and two sons had</b>
<br><b>had the same experiences.&nbsp; It seems though, that it</b>
<br><b>had all stopped at around the same time I did the</b>
<br><b>ceremony.&nbsp; They didn't know why, but they all felt</b>
<br><b>that he was finally at peace.</b><b></b>
<p><b>So, you tell me, was I dreaming, or was I talking with</b>
<br><b>a ghost?</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>Was it a wraith?</font></b>

<p><b>I work at night and one of my parents drives me to work.&nbsp; Every
night I</b>
<br><b>get up late and go to work late.&nbsp; Anyway, this is what happened.&nbsp;
I sat</b>
<br><b>in the passenger side of the car and just stared out the window
like I</b>
<br><b>always do.&nbsp; Watching everything pass by me.&nbsp; I put my
attention on the</b>
<br><b>radio and suddenly noticed something in the corner of my eye.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>looked out of the window, there was something quickly going past
my</b>
<br><b>window.&nbsp; It looked like a large gust of white fog.&nbsp; It
had the same look</b>
<br><b>as when you pour milk into water.&nbsp; It was flowing like a cloud
but went</b>
<br><b>by very quickly.&nbsp; I saw it pass a lot of cars and disappeared
ahead of</b>
<br><b>some other cars.&nbsp; Then about 2 seconds later that car tried
to pass the</b>
<br><b>red light but a pick-up truck came from the intersection and slammed</b>
<br><b>into its side.&nbsp; I didn't find out anything else until the next
morning</b>
<br><b>when my dad picked me up from work.&nbsp; I asked him about what
happened and</b>
<br><b>he said that when he drove through there again, there were fire</b>
<br><b>trucks,ambulances and the entire intersection was blocked off and
he had</b>
<br><b>to go around.&nbsp; The reason I believe it was a wraith is for
the simple</b>
<br><b>reason that I had believed in them since I was a little kid.&nbsp;
Another</b>
<br><b>incedent occurred months ago when my family and I were looking for
the</b>
<br><b>car keys.&nbsp; As I searched on the mantle, the picture of my girlfriends</b>
<br><b>grandfather fell over face down.&nbsp; I immediately got a bad feeling
and</b>
<br><b>thought to myself that something would happen to him.&nbsp; I told
her and</b>
<br><b>she told me that he was sick.&nbsp; A week later she called me,crying.&nbsp;
Her</b>
<br><b>grandfather had passed away.&nbsp; I believe that I have seen many
ghosts,</b>
<br><b>had many visions about things and had lots of deja vu.&nbsp; I never
bother</b>
<br><b>to try to explain I just live with it.</b>

<p><b><font size=+2>My Weird Story</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: eddie@fpc.tamu.edu</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I wanted to send my stories so that I could share them with</b>
<br><b>everyone :-) Enjoy!</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in Texas, where along the border especially, legends are</b>
<br><b>passed on through generations. One particular story my father told</b>
<br><b>me happened to my grandfather (who seems to attract</b>
<br><b>unexplainable things :-)).</b>
<br><b>On one occasion my grandfather was traveling on a bus from San</b>
<br><b>Antonio to somewhere in Texas(it has slipped my mind). His seat</b>
<br><b>was next to another passenger who was ill. The bus driver had</b>
<br><b>asked him to sit with the ill passenger and keep an eye on him.</b>
<br><b>Well, at one point the passenger got ill and my grandfather told
the</b>
<br><b>bus driver to pull over.&nbsp; So the bus driver pulled over out
in the</b>
<br><b>middle of nowhere and the sick passenger got out of the bus to be</b>
<br><b>sick.</b>
<br><b>They waited and waited and about 15 minutes later my grandfather</b>
<br><b>went out to check on him and he wasn't there. Both him and the</b>
<br><b>bus driver looked all around the bus but couldn't find anyone.</b>
<br><b>So when the bus reached its destination my grandfather gave the</b>
<br><b>bus driver his address and phone number so that if he heard</b>
<br><b>anything about the ill passenger.</b>
<br><b>About three days later they found the ill passenger crazy, he had</b>
<br><b>gone out of his mind. Legend has it that when people are</b>
<br><b>possessed they tend to go crazy. My grandfather never found out</b>
<br><b>what the passenger saw or what happened.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Another story occured when my father was a young boy, my</b>
<br><b>grandfather and grandmother were sitting outside on the porch after</b>
<br><b>my father and his brothers were asleep. They saw three nuns</b>
<br><b>gliding up the road to the church. He swears they were literaly</b>
<br><b>gliding b/c the loose dogs, where biting at what was supposed to</b>
<br><b>by their feet but nothing was there. My grandfather got dressed
and</b>
<br><b>got into the car and proceeded to look for them and could never
find</b>
<br><b>them or any trace of them.</b>
