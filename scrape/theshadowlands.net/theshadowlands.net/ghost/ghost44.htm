<H3><A NAME=more>Ghosts and More Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by DSp1051</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been interested in ghosts ever since I was a little girl. It
started when my family (which at the time was my mother, father, brother,
and me) moved into an old house. For some reason my parents began to fight
all the time (they never fought like that before or after that house). My
dreams became nightmares. The dreams were that of my toys coming to life
and coming for me (which is very scary for a little girl). Then one night
as I lay in bed looking at my door I saw her. It was a girl or maybe young
women. I could see through but still see her. the only light in the room
the light from the moon. She did not glow that I remember. This is the one
time I remember seeing her, but my mother told me later that I always would
tell her about seeing the ghost. To say the least I was glad to move. Next
time I would be at a haunted house would be prom night this year '98. I had
just meet this girl (we later became good friends). I took her home on prom
night to chage out of her dress. This is the frist time I walked into this
girls home. I felt the presents in her home. I did not tell her or ask her
about it. But that night when the subject of ghost came up she said, "My
home is haunted by a little boy. He followed us from another house. He usually



just truns the tv on and off." But she has also seen the little boy and all
the pictures with just her in the taken at her house have blurs or lights
across them. JUST THE ONES WITH HER.  Another time that I was able to feel
the presents of a ghost was when at was at my great-grandfather's house.
He had just died. I was about 16 when this happened. When I was little I
would spend every summer up there (he lives in NY and I live in LA). When
I was littl e we would sleep in the basement which was an apartment. I was
never afraid of any part of the house until my mother and I went up there
to clean the house at with the help of my Aunt Sherry, Uncle Mike and his
wife (all these people slept in the house as while as my mother and I). My
Uncle Mike and his wife slept in the basement. She would NOT go down there



without someone else. The basement did not bother me, but ever time I would
hit the top two steps leading to the second floor I would feel a strong presents.



The second floor had two bedrooms and a bathroom. While after a while of
getting the feeling I stopped going up stairs. It was getting late and I
had to take bath (which was upstairs), so my mother told me she would go
with me. She sat on the bed of my great Uncle (who had passed away 8 years
ago). the bed faced the stairs in such a  way you could only the top 2 -3
stairs. Before this my mother and Aunt Sherry had been making fun of me because
I would not go upstairs by myself. While I was in the shower my mother heard



footsteps. Thinking it was my Aunt she got up and walked to the stairs. There
was no one there and my Aunt was on the phone in the kitchen and was not
able to be the one on the stairs (by the way my Uncle and his wife were not
even at the house at the time).</B>
<P><B>I will quickly tell you something my mother told me oneday. Her brother



died of cancer on the day she went into surgery for breast cancer. She for
some reason felt totally at peace on that day all day long. Any way about
4-5 months after my Uncle David died my mother was going through a very hard



time. That night she had a dream about my Uncle. It was like no other dream
she had ever had. He was floating next to her bed. He was health and smiling.
She said the any thigh she can remember is that he was complaining (like
he liked to do). After that night she felt much better. Not even a year after
my Uncle died so did my mother. It has been only a little over a year now,
but before she died she promised me she would come to me in a dream like
her brother did to her. She not come yet. I think she is waiting for the
right time. Thank you for your time.</B>

<H3><A NAME=campus>Campus Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by rshort@wam.umd.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello, my name is Rebecca and I used to attend Point Loma Nazarene
    </B>
<P><B>University, or as it was known up until this May, Point Loma Nazarene



    </B>
<P><B>College. The school has a very interesting history. The campus used
to be     </B>
<P><B>the site of a utopia of sorts run by a woman who created her own religion



    </B>
<P><B>from many ancient world religions. She built seven different enterances
to     </B>
<P><B>campus to symbolize the seven different religions and people would
enter     </B>
<P><B>the campus through thier respective religion's enterance. She also
built     </B>
<P><B>on campus the first Greek Amphitheater on the West Coast. </B>
<P><B>Anyhow, she lived in a house on campus, that has since been relocated
and     </B>
<P><B>had a basement added on. She lived upstairs in a small room with a
little     </B>
<P><B>coupala (sp?) on the second floor. One year she went to Sweden, I think
it     </B>
<P><B>was Sweden, and while there was hit by a car or vehicle of some sort.
I     </B>
<P><B>believe it was a car though. Anyhow, she was in bad shape, yet she
made it     </B>
<P><B>back to the USA and to San Diego. She spent the rest of her life in
that     </B>
<P><B>room and eventually died there. </B>
<P><B>The house is now the site of continual paranormal experiences. It has
been     </B>
<P><B>exorcised repeatedly to no avail. When the campus was first purchased
it     </B>
<P><B>was supposed to have been exorcise by many different religions, even
    </B>
<P><B>thought the current school is Wesleyan Protestant. Students regularly



    </B>
<P><B>spend Halloween in the house, yet always leave very soon.</B>
<P><B>Some friends of mine spent Halloween in the house. I thought about
    </B>
<P><B>spending it there with them, but by ten o'clock I was way too freaked



out.</B>
<P><B>We were already hearing wierd sounds and the elevator was giving us
    </B>
<P><B>grief-showing up and doors opening without our request and all. I was
a     </B>
<P><B>Journalism student and the student newspaper office is the in the basement



    </B>
<P><B>of this building and when we were unlocking the door to get in that
night     </B>
<P><B>I felt the floor raise up under my feet. No one else felt it but I
did and     </B>
<P><B>it was really unnerving. </B>
<P><B>Anyhow, that night I left and went home and spent the night with some



    </B>
<P><B>friends, but the people who did stay went through a terribly tramatic



    </B>
<P><B>experience. They went out and rented some horror movies, hoping to
bring     </B>
<P><B>on a paranormal experience. I think they even rented Exorcist, which
    </B>
<P><B>everyone found really amusing and thought a good film. Well, the VCR,</B>
<P><B>which really never had problems before didn't work that night and the



    </B>
<P><B>picture kept having problems. Finally the phone rang. One of them picked



    </B>
<P><B>it up and there was a monotone, berating voice on the other end that
told     </B>
<P><B>them, "get out. get out. leave my house and don't come back." Or something



    </B>
<P><B>to that effect. They immediatly dropped the phone back on the



reciever,</B>
<P><B>and bolted out of the house, leaving backpacks, homework and whatnot
in     </B>
<P><B>their wake. They left everything there except car keys. They existed
the     </B>
<P><B>house via back stairs that led up out of the house from the basement,
so     </B>
<P><B>one had to come from below ground level to above ground level. Then,
as     </B>
<P><B>they came up out of the house the four of them parted and two went
around     </B>
<P><B>one side of the house and vise versa. Now the house is built symmetrically



    </B>
<P><B>on the ground floor. One enters into a hallway flanked by two rooms,</B>
<P><B>flanked by really big windows. Well, if you stand on one side of the
house     </B>
<P><B>and your friend on the other, outside both of you, you can look through



    </B>
<P><B>the window, through the room, through the door, through the hall, through



    </B>
<P><B>the door, through the room, through the other window and see your



friend:</B>
<P><B>     | 		    |			       |	       |</B>
<P><B>You  |Window   Room  Door     Hallway     Door	  Room   Window| Friend



    </B>
<P><B>     |              | 			       |               |</B>
<P>
<P><B>I hope that makes sense. It is integral to the next part. So, two of
them     </B>
<P><B>were standing on one side of the house and two of them were on the
other     </B>
<P><B>side of the house, both pairs could see the other pairs. And then this



    </B>
<P><B>banging began. Someone was clearly banging on the windows, very



loudly,</B>
<P><B>almost as if someone had gone mad. Just this incesant banging as if
a     </B>
<P><B>person had both fists raised over their head and were hitting the window



    </B>
<P><B>with them with all of their body put into it. My friends jumped in
their     </B>
<P><B>cars and sped away off campus and didn't come back on campus until
the     </B>
<P><B>following morning when it was light. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I had experiences with this ghost before I knew it was a ghost. I was



    </B>
<P><B>downstairs in the student newspaper room typing an article and I heard



    </B>
<P><B>people upstairs running around, and it sounded like people were upstairs



    </B>
<P><B>playing basketball. So, I went to the elevator and got in and, since
the     </B>
<P><B>house is on the National Register of Historic Places, I felt it my
duty to     </B>
<P><B>tell them to go away and stop playing around. What if they broke  
  </B>
<P><B>something. So, I went in the elevator and when the doors closed I 
   </B>
<P><B>immediatly had this apparant feeling that I ought not be in there.
So I     </B>
<P><B>came to the ground floor, I got out, holding the door and I said,



"Hello?</B>
<P><B>Is anyone here? Well, you need to leave. This is a National Historic
    </B>
<P><B>Monument and you need to leave. This is not a place to play." Then
I went     </B>
<P><B>to the next floor, the second floor, and said generally the same thing.
If     </B>
<P><B>anyone had been on either floors they would have heard what I had said
on     </B>
<P><B>the other floor, but I wanted to make it clear. Then I got back on
the     </B>
<P><B>elevator and felt really bad on the way back down. I went back into
the     </B>
<P><B>newsroom and got a Bible and put one on my computer and I held one
in my     </B>
<P><B>lap, luckily someone came soon, because after I went downstairs I heard



    </B>
<P><B>the running again, but it stopped and it felt like it had stopped for
the     </B>
<P><B>night, and then the elevator had come down, the doors opened and closed



    </B>
<P><B>and it went back up, without my calling it. Very unnerving. So, later
I     </B>
<P><B>told someone that I heard somebody running around upstairs and they
told     </B>
<P><B>me what had been going on for years. </B>
<P>
<P><B>This all takes place, all of the stories I know first or second hand,
in     </B>
<P><B>like a three week period or so. So, this next one just compounds the
    </B>
<P><B>others. Two of my friends had been downstairs typing their stories
in the     </B>
<P><B>newsroom and all of a sudden the computers froze up and an alarm clock
we     </B>
<P><B>had down there went off and the radio came on. Then a picture starting



    </B>
<P><B>scanning onto the screen. Now, the scanner had been broken for what,
two     </B>
<P><B>weeks? And it wasn't even plugged in. So, this picture scans onto the



    </B>
<P><B>screen and my friends are really just about ready to die, this is so
    </B>
<P><B>wierd. So they wait and then the picture appears and it is of another



    </B>
<P><B>utopia era building on campus that has a spiral staircase that leads
from     </B>
<P><B>the groud to the roof. The picture is of the staircase and the gate
that     </B>
<P><B>is ALWAYS locked and chained shut is open and the gate is laying



aside.</B>
<P><B>So, my friends delete the picture and bolt. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Two more stories I know about the place. </B>
<P>
<P><B>This one is another one that happened in the app. three week period.
One     </B>
<P><B>of the friends who had experienced the scanning incident was downstairs
in     </B>
<P><B>the newsroom with a friend who had previously graduated from the



school.</B>
<P><B>He does not believe in this sort of thing at all. (Well, now he



does.)</B>
<P><B>They were hanging out talking in the room and doing some work. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The room gets all outside light from, I think, three windows at the
bottom     </B>
<P><B>of 8 foot wells which are guarded by three to four foot high guard
rails     </B>
<P><B>around their edges. In short, if anyone were to try to get to the



bottom,</B>
<P><B>it would be a long (11-12 ft) painful fall as the wells are only about
two     </B>
<P><B>feet across and three feet wide. </B>
<P>
<P><B>So, my friend and her friend are chatting away and all of a sudden
they     </B>
<P><B>hear a smack of a fist, a big "wham!" kind of sound on one of the windows



    </B>
<P><B>and they look up real fast and see a man with blond hair upside down
in     </B>
<P><B>period clothing quickly whisking (read:rising really, really,really



fast)</B>
<P><B>upward out of sight. So fast they barely saw him. They left. They looked



    </B>
<P><B>all around the well but didn't find anybody or anything and there really



    </B>
<P><B>is no rational explanation for how someone could suspend themself upside



    </B>
<P><B>down into this well, smack the window, and get away fast, in period
    </B>
<P><B>clothing. Really wierd. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Finally, this one is just an ongoing occurance, but the room where
the     </B>
<P><B>Purple Lady, (the woman who died,) died is now the campus radio



station.</B>
<P><B>They have Christmas lights up there and all kinds of stuff. Well, they
are     </B>
<P><B>constantly having windows open up, Christmas lights flicker, the room
get     </B>
<P><B>cold, equipment stop working and then start up again and all kinds
of     </B>
<P><B>stuff. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I guess this is not as bad as it used to be before the house was moved.
It     </B>
<P><B>used to be across the street and down a block or so and supposedly
things     </B>
<P><B>were really bad then, but I have no first hand knowledge of that. </B>
<P><B>However, I would definetly nominate this for the register. The place
is     </B>
<P><B>wierd. The campus is wierd and definetly haunted. I have heard that
the     </B>
<P><B>theater on campus is also haunted-bad. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As an interesting sidenote, Spalding of Spalding sports equipment fame



    </B>
<P><B>lived on campus in a house he had constructed in the shape of a turtle



    </B>
<P><B>facing the sea. He believed that when one died they would become a
turtle     </B>
<P><B>and go toward the sea. Also, many of the buildings have purple balls
on     </B>
<P><B>top that light up. When the Purple Lady was on campus they would turn
the     </B>
<P><B>lights on so everyone knew she was there and many sailors remember
coming     </B>
<P><B>to the area of Point Loma and seeing these purple balls glowing on
the     </B>
<P><B>coast. Also, this lady brought over lots of Cuban and Dominican (I



think)</B>
<P><B>children to populate her utopia. The place is wierd and definetly



haunted.</B>
<P><B>Have fun. Let me know if you need sources or information. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Oh, I forgot, after my experiences with the house I had trouble sleeping



    </B>
<P><B>for weeks after. I would wake up in the middle of the night and see
a dark     </B>
<P><B>shape like figure in my room. Scared the hell out of me. I slept with
my     </B>
<P><B>Bible pressed close to my chest and before I went to sleep each night
I     </B>
<P><B>took two Nyquil in hopes of not waking up. Scared the HELL out of me.
I     </B>
<P><B>slept with light on a lot, which didn't make my roommate too happy,
but I     </B>
<P><B>explained to her what was going on she dealt with it. I was really,</B>
<P><B>really, really scared. I don't ever want to be in that building again
at     </B>
<P><B>night alone and I haven't been since my experience with the people
running     </B>
<P><B>around upstairs. I only go in with people and I don't let them leave
my     </B>
<P><B>side. Really. When I was leaving a meeting for the student paper once,
we     </B>
<P><B>had all been talking about "her" and making jokes and laughing and
really     </B>
<P><B>ridiculing the situation. I was one of the first to leave and I walked
out     </B>
<P><B>of the room and it just felt evil. I went from complete laughter to
    </B>
<P><B>jubilation and dread. I walked right back in the room, told a friend
how I     </B>
<P><B>felt and we walked out together with a group of other people. I can't



    </B>
<P><B>explain it well, but I was totally laughing and cracking up. Just having
a     </B>
<P><B>ball and making light of the situation and when I walked out of the
room     </B>
<P><B>it was as if someone had slapped me. I was downed immediatly and I
won't     </B>
<P><B>ever cross that woman again. I respect her greatly and I don't ever
want     </B>
<P><B>to cross her path. She is not to be messed with. Everyone now really
    </B>
<P><B>respects her. We have a student from Kenya who attends at school and
she     </B>
<P><B>painted a picture in memoriam of "her" up on the wall and no one really



    </B>
<P><B>ridicules it. If they do other people will let them know exactly how
real     </B>
<P><B>this is. I don't even want to experience that again. It is not something



    </B>
<P><B>to play with.</B>

<H3><A NAME=topo>My Poodle Topo</A>
</H3><P><B>by caine@ecol.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>This all happened many years ago.</B>
<P><B>When I was about seventeen years old and still in high school,</B>
<P><B>my parents bought me a miniature poodle puppy. He was just</B>
<P><B>a little, round white ball of fluff (about eight weeks old) when</B>
<P><B>we got him. I decided to name him "Topo" because as a child</B>
<P><B>I had liked to watch the mouse puppet on the Ed Sullivan show.</B>
<P><B>The years went by and we moved, the family split up with my</B>
<P><B>brother and one of my sisters leaving to get married, my parents</B>
<P><B>divorced, but Topo always came with me. He was a very bright</B>
<P><B>and happy little animal whose favorite game was "Hide The</B>
<P><B>Frisbee". I would send him upstairs to wait while I hid his frisbee</B>
<P><B>in a closet or cabinet, with the door ajar just a tiny bit. Then I'd</B>
<P><B>yell "Topo!" and he would come racing down and search all</B>
<P><B>over the living room until he'd found the frisbee and dragged it</B>
<P><B>out of its hiding spot.</B>
<P><B>One day when I'd just given Topo a piece of jerky treat and</B>
<P><B>told him what a good boy he was, he was prancing happily</B>
<P><B>around- then suddenly keeled off to one side and collapsed.</B>
<P><B>He died of a heart attack, the veterinarian told us afterward.</B>
<P><B>Topo was eleven years old when this happened and it really</B>
<P><B>broke my heart.</B>
<P><B>A few nights after he had died, I was lying in bed in the dark,</B>
<P><B>still missing him but not really thinking about it at the moment</B>
<P><B>as I had other things going on in my life also, when I heard</B>
<P><B>the old familiar scampering noise on the carpet next to my bed</B>
<P><B>(the run- and- jump he always did to get up there). Then I felt</B>
<P><B>the little feet padding up alongside of me on top of the covers,</B>
<P><B>and the sensation of Topo sort of curling up and cozying in</B>
<P><B>next to me the way he had always done. I remember stiffening</B>
<P><B>up because I was just a lttle afraid (though I don't know why)</B>
<P><B>and I didn't want to open my eyes to see if anything was</B>
<P><B>there. I have always been nervous about the thought of</B>
<P><B>seeing spirits or whatever.</B>
<P><B>I now feel he was just letting me know that he was fine and</B>
<P><B>as as far as he was concerned, life was still going on as</B>
<P><B>usual. But again, events happened, we moved once more .Now</B>
<P><B>I myself am married and have my own family, living in an entirely</B>
<P><B>different part of the country, and I still think about Topo. I</B>
<P><B>wonder if he moved on too, or is still rambling around in his old</B>
<P><B>home.</B>
<P><HR>
<H3><A NAME=family>My family's Experience with Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by Bustersmum@mailexcite.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>To some degree, I have inherited from my father's side of the family,



a</B>
<P><B>psychic ability to see or sense ghosts.  One tale I have to tell is
about my</B>
<P><B>Great-Uncle Gord when he was walking home from work one night.  It
was at</B>
<P><B>the height of the depression and my uncle was working where-ever he



could.</B>
<P><B>He and my aunt lived up north near Haliburton, Ontario and he had to
walk in</B>
<P><B>from the main road and travel along an old lumber trail to get to his



house.</B>
<P><B>This particular night, it was the middle of winter and all my uncle



wanted</B>
<P><B>to do was to get home.  He was walking along minding his own business



when</B>
<P><B>he saw a gentleman approaching him from the opposite way.  "Cold night",



he</B>
<P><B>said to the man.  The man never answered him, but kept his head down



and</B>
<P><B>walked on.  My uncle thought nothing of his impoliteness and went on



his</B>
<P><B>way.  Not more than 1/2 a mile from his home, he saw the same man



again,</B>
<P><B>travelling in the same direction.  There was no way this man could



have</B>
<P><B>walked that fast through dense brush without my uncle seeing him again.



 The</B>
<P><B>trail was U-shaped and ended at the woods or the main road.  Once again



my</B>
<P><B>uncle greeted him by saying "Good evening sir".  This time the man
looked up</B>
<P><B>and he had no face.  When he arrived at home, his face was as white
as a</B>
<P><B>sheet and his wife was concerned for him.  The next morning, he decided



to</B>
<P><B>check out whether the man might have gotten lost or frozen in the bad</B>
<P><B>whether.  When he got to where he had last seen the man, there was
only one</B>
<P><B>set of footsteps - his- and none going in the opposite direction.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As for myself, my first experience with a ghost was when I was five



years</B>

which was</B>
<P><B>closed.  All of a sudden a man on a horse came riding out!  He got
to the</B>

calmly</B>
<P><B>rode out through my bedroom window.  This was not a dream as remember



every</B>
<P><B>aspect of this experience even to the appearance of my room highlighted



by</B>
<P><B>the street lights (and it wasn't the street lights either!)  Since
then, I</B>

I cannot</B>

<H3><A NAME=home>Haunting in My Home</A>
</H3><P><B>by jphillips@freewwweb.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>My Name is Julie and I am 39 years old, married mother of two.</B>
<P><B>I grew up in a haunted house and remember feeling the joy of being
</B>
<P><B>free of a presence, when I moved into a new home with my



husband.After</B>
<P><B>so many years of bizarre experiences, you just couldn't talk about,</B>
<P><B>it was nice to have some normalcy in setting up housekeeping. It did</B>
<P><B>not last forever though. We moved into our present home three years



ago.</B>
<P><B>I did not feel a presence right away. Believe me it is a feeling you</B>
<P><B>never forget and recognize immediatly when it returns. One night I



was</B>
<P><B>carrying an armload of clean clothes to be put away in my room. As
I </B>
<P><B>opened the door to step in, I gasped outloud. The overwhelming



feeling</B>
<P><B>of an evil hate-filled prescence pulsated at me from the far corner



of</B>
<P><B>the room. I was frozen with fear and confusion. Instead of stepping</B>
<P><B>backwards out of the room,(I still don't know why I did not), I



jumped</B>
<P><B>into the open closet door and flicked on light. I just felt if I got</B>
<P><B>that light on I would be safe. I peered out the door, and though



there</B>
<P><B>was nothing to see, I knew in my heart IT was still there, radiating</B>
<P><B>it's evil towards me. I knew by experience I could not give into this</B>
<P><B>fear. I said I'm not afraid over and over and faced that corner of
the </B>
<P><B>room. I felt it diminish, and when I said the Lord's Prayer, it went</B>
<P><B>away completely. I did not know what all that was about, or why it



was</B>
<P><B>there but I chose to ignore it. It had other ideas. This happened in</B>
<P><B>Aug. '96. The following June '97, I had trouble sleeping one night.</B>
<P><B>Around 5 a.m., I felt sharp claws run up and down my right foot,



twice</B>
<P><B>quickly. I jerked my feet up in horror. I felt the same malevelant</B>
<P><B>presence next to the bed. I layed frozen to the spot, even too scared</B>
<P><B>to get up and use the bathroom. I couldn't even nudge my husband



awake.</B>
<P><B>I felt if I moved it would pounce. So I laid there, kidneys aching



till</B>
<P><B>daylight. All day my right foot was tender where the claws had run
</B>
<P><B>across my foot. The next night I slept with slippers on. Two months</B>
<P><B>later, again around 5 a.m., I woke from a deep sleep already saying



the</B>
<P><B>Lord's Prayer even before I was fully awake or realized what was going



</B>
<P><B>on. I felt the presence inches from my face and dared not open my



eyes.</B>
<P><B>I repeated the prayer until it was gone.Five days later I was in my



room</B>
<P><B>and heard the strangest sound at ny window. It was a keening noise



like</B>
<P><B>a cross between a baby bird And a screeching animal, with scratching</B>
<P><B>noises. I went to look, I wasn't frightened, but figured it was



nothing.</B>
<P><B>As I walked away from the window, it got louder and faster. I stopped</B>
<P><B>then headed out the room. By now it was so loud and persistant, I had



to</B>
<P><B>look. It was really putting up a fuss now, but when I pulled back the</B>
<P><B>curtain, it immediatly stopped. I mean cut off like with a switch.



And</B>
<P><B>I noticed my son had left his headlights on. It was like I was



supposed</B>
<P><B>to notice that. But I could not figure why an evil spirit would be</B>
<P><B>helpful. The following day, My daughter noticed the dog acting very</B>
<P><B>strange. He was hiding in the hall way in the dark, eyes bulging,</B>
<P><B>looking terrified. My daughter said he had just run out of the



kitchen</B>
<P><B>as if he were afraid. He began to run about the house looking for



places</B>
<P><B>to hide. Anywhere but the kitchen. In all his 6 years, he had never</B>
<P><B>acted this way. We even tried to lure him in the kitchen with



cookies,</B>
<P><B>which never fail to entice him, but he would have none of it. This



went</B>
<P><B>on for 45 minutes. Then all of a sudden, he was fine. Even wandered



into</B>
<P><B>the kitchen to see if the cookie offer still held. </B>
<P><B>The last episode was this past January. I was sleeping face down,



arms</B>
<P><B>above my head, When I was jolted awake by sharp claws digging into
my</B>
<P><B>arms. I was paralized with fear and tried to get my husband to wake



up.</B>
<P><B>I tried to nudge closer to him, but couln't move. He always seems to



be</B>
<P><B>in a deep sleep when these things occur. I have heard of phsyic



sleep,</B>
<P><B>and wonder if that is why I can't wake him. Nothing has happened



since,</B>
<P><B>But it seems to be more active during summer months, and anyhting



could</B>
<P><B>change I guess. It isn't a constant feeling of presence. I think it</B>
<P><B>comes and goes at will, and only shows up to remind me it's around.
I</B>
<P><B>can only guess as to it's motives.</B>
<P><B>My husband and I went on a haunted ghost tour one night and joked



that</B>
<P><B>we hoped none of the ghost would hitch a ride home. That night as we</B>
<P><B>lay in bed watching T.V., still talking about the night's adventures,</B>
<P><B>almost on cue, something hit our window hard. We both bolted upright</B>
<P><B>and stared at each other. My husband went outside to look at the



window.</B>
<P><B>He said the window was fine, but there was a claw mark in the</B>
<P><B>sreen, which is still there to this day.</B>

began</B>

thousands</B>

<P>
<P><B>I am a senior enlisted member in the U S Navy.  Being stationed over
sea's for most of my twenty plus years in the service, I have seen alot of


strange and ghostly things.  This particular incident happened to me while
I was living in Yokosuka, Japan.  My wife and I had just moved into a small


japanese house set on top of a large hill over looking the city.  The house
was very old and must have been there pryer to the war.  One night while
I was sleeping, I was awaken by the feeling of a strange presence and the


sensation of something or someone sitting on my chest.  As I opened my eyes
I saw an elderly women sitting on my chest and chanting in Japanese.  I could
not move my body nor could I breath.  My body slowly started to curl up into
a tight ball. I tried with all my power and strength to free myself to no
eval.  I had actually stopped breathing and was on the verge of passing out
when I started praying to God, this did the trick.  I was released and the
older women vanished.  This incident happened twice more.  I was reluctant
to tell my wife about it for fear that It would scare her, but by the third


incident she knew something was up and she questioned me about it.  I told
her what was going on and she being japanese herself knew of this type of
spirit.  According to her this spirit is common in japan and is thought to
cause many deaths in that island country.</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My House</A>
</H3><P><B>by CherokeeLP@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is about the house I live in with my boyfriend and two other


friends....It's not a 300 year old castle, or built on a cemetary...at least
we don't think it is....It's just your average NJ ranch house, that is


approximatly 40 years old, and some interesting things have been happening
here for at least half of its existence....Aside from the almost everyday
feeling of being watched.....here's the rest....</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>This is a long one..</B>
<P><B>         I live in a house, in Manville, NJ, and have lived here for
4 years.  When I first moved in, I rented a room upstairs where the land
lord, Lisa lived also.  Two friends, Joe and Brian lived in the basement


apartment. Lisa told me of strange happenings which went on before my arrival,


things like echo's of whistling in the shower. Also, in one of the bedrooms
in the basement,  whomever had that room as their bedroom, never wanted to
sleep in it and never specified as to why.  This same room is the one where
a former 'boarder' shot bullets through the ceiling for no apparent reason.
 And ironically, Joe and Brian always slept out on the couch instead of in
their rooms....and they had NOT been told the stories of the strange sounds
etc. </B>
<P><B>       Three years ago  a few friends moved in with me, and Lisa moved
out.  Stranger things began to happen.  My one cat, Toby would sit in the
above mentioned room for hours on end and scream at the the wall .  We would


bring him upstairs, and he would proceed down again to scream and growl some


more.  A few years ago one of my present roommates would be awakened by an
odd feeling that he was being watched,  he opened his eyes and saw a white


silouhette only inches away from his face....staring at him.  About the same
time frame, I would have a repeated dream of a civil soldier walking down
the hallway by my bedroom door.  The odd thing was a friend who spent alot
of overnites would share with me the same dream.  Being of Cherokee descent,
I asked my step mother, who is a medicine woman, what I should do.  She


instructed us to "clense" the house, which we did.  Things got better for
a while.....</B>
<P><B>         Then.... last year, shortly after my best friend passed away,
 the stereo turned itself on,  at 1 a.m. at full blast, jumping back and
forth to different settings (cd, tape)  it stopped at CD and played


Metallica....the same evening the bathroom door was shut and the light was
on so when my fiancee woke up and heard the water running he naturally, assumed


someone was in the bathroom... I discovered the next morning that the bathroom


was empty!  Four of us live here now, all of us have seen or experienced
similar things at different times. </B>
<P><B>        In the past 4 weeks we have individually been in the basement
and experienced a phantom "cat?" leaping off the stairs and then disappearing.


The most recent incident(s):   We all have at one time or another witnessed
a white, smokey figure or blob floating nearly playful peeking and ducking
behind doorways.   The past few days we and friends alike have all witnessed
some kind of energy force (like static shock from the carpet) only it's been


above the counter in the kitchen and by the bookshelf in the livingroom (not


carpeted - wood floors). Or the feeling of someone grabbing your hand......also,


a strange scratching noise witnessed by three cats and three humans in our


upstairs livingroom.  </B>
<P><B>       My sister was visiting several months ago and saw a tall man
wearing who appeared to have been wearing a 'Zoot Suit', broad shoulders,
dark grey, wearing a sharp cut, tailored suit.  Today my sister and I are


visiting and we discussed the strange happenings, dreams......we have discovered


that this male figure is essentially the same one I saw 3 or 4 years ago
in my dream, and my friend's dream.  Our home is only 40 years old...to the
best of our knowledge no one has past away here. Though, the house has never
been occupied by your typical "family". </B>
<P><B>       Before Lisa bought the house in the early 80's, it  was owned
by a "belly dancer"...(of all things) who had teenage children.  When Lisa
bought the house and was cleaning everything out, she found in the loft in
the garage, what seemed to be a mini-prostitution room, equiped with old


matresses and pornography magazines. We have talked to our neighbors...Al
and Gert, they are in their 70's or 80's and have the oldest house in the


area...they informed us that the civil war troops did in fact cross over
the soil which rests under our home today.  </B>
<P><B>     Also, 3 of us who live here and 2 other visiting guests have


experienced being "touched" a sort of tingly sensation...always on the back,


shoulder or side.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>    As I said before, I am of Cherokee descent,  and very spiritually


sensitive and have had many a ghostly experience from the time I was 2 or
3 years of age.  I know there is some thing or some one here, but am curious
as to who it is.  Or who THEY are.  I can also tell you that many many of
our friends who have felt quite uncomfortable upon entering the house, especially


the basement.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We would like to find someone who would be interested in investigating


these unusual occurances.  I am an animal health technician, and have 2 dogs
and 4 cats, among other caged animals, and all of them seem to be sensing
things and reacting to things which we cannot see.  My roommates are concerned


and interested in solving OUR 4 year old mystery.  Can you help?  </B>

</H3><P><B>by littledebo@naxs.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Here's one of the many ghostly occurrences I have experienced. 


Though</B>
<P><B>many  have sent chills along my spine, none has ever frightened me


the</B>
<P><B>way this one has.  It is the only time I have actually been attacked


my</B>
<P><B>an unseen presence.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My best friend, Angie, and her family lived in an old farmhouse far


out</B>
<P><B>in the country, several miles from my home.  The valley where their


home</B>
<P><B>was situated was a beautiful, scenic area. Trouble was, from the very</B>
<P><B>first time I entered the roadway that led through this valley, I was</B>
<P><B>overtaken by a chilled, uneasy feeling.  It was as if there were some</B>
<P><B>type of dark cloud that hung over the valley, though this was more
an</B>
<P><B>inward feeling than an actual physical manifestation.  There was an</B>
<P><B>uncomfortable feel to the area, as though one were constantly being</B>
<P><B>watched, and the feeling that you were trespassing on forbidden ground.


</B>
<P><B>A large portion of the land in this valley belonged to Angie's


family,</B>
<P><B>and there were constant struggles among the family with the uncle who</B>
<P><B>maintained control of the land.  There were at least four houses, and


a</B>
<P><B>church, controlled by Angie's uncle, which either remained empty and</B>
<P><B>unused, or were only rented for short periods of time.  People rarely</B>
<P><B>stayed long in this valley, and were usually the victims of one type


of</B>
<P><B>bad luck or the other while living there.  Angie's husband was at the</B>
<P><B>time unemployed, and so the family was forced to stay in this valley,</B>
<P><B>since they were able to live there rent free for several years.  Bad</B>
<P><B>luck seemed to plague her family.  Accidents, sickness and money woes</B>
<P><B>were common.</B>
<P><B>One weekend, I went for an overnight visit.  I was to sleep in the</B>
<P><B>living room on the couch.  We sat talking till about one in the


morning,</B>
<P><B>and then everyone retired to their respective rooms.  Being prone to</B>
<P><B>insomnia, I sat quietly, reclining on the couch, reading a magazine,


and</B>
<P><B>waiting to feel sleepy enough to turn out the lamp situated by the</B>
<P><B>couch.  Over a period of time, I became increasingly aware of a


rustling</B>
<P><B>noise coming from the corner of the room, opposite the couch.  I


could</B>
<P><B>clearly see into the corner from where I was sitting, and nothing was</B>
<P><B>visible.  At first, I thought that the noise might be created by a</B>
<P><B>wandering mouse in the old farmhouse.  But then, I realized that the</B>
<P><B>sound was coming from about a foot and a half off the floor, and as
I</B>
<P><B>listened, became louder and more active.  I could consciously feel
a</B>
<P><B>presence in that corner, growing stronger by the minute.  It was a


very</B>
<P><B>unpleasant sensation, with a sense of evil permeating the area around</B>
<P><B>the noise.</B>
<P><B>Suddenly, as I sat there, this presence, sensed though unseen, seemed


to</B>
<P><B>rise out of the corner, spread out, and settle over me.  I felt</B>
<P><B>smothered, pinned to the couch.  I could not move, and could barely</B>
<P><B>breathe. I struggled to sit upright, and call out, but was held


totally</B>
<P><B>immobile and speechless by the enveloping presence. Realizing that


this</B>
<P><B>attack was somehow evil or demonic, I began, in my mind, to pray,</B>
<P><B>calling on the name of Jesus, and binding the power of the entity.


 For</B>
<P><B>a short time, the presence became even heavier.  Then, as I prayed,


it</B>
<P><B>seemed to loose some strength.  Finally, I was able to speak aloud,


and</B>
<P><B>began to whisper my prayer out loud.  As I did this, the presence


seemed</B>
<P><B>to struggle, and then, suddenly abated.  It was gone.  Needless to


say,</B>
<P><B>the remainder of the night was sleepless, as I sat there praying, and</B>
<P><B>awaiting the family to rise.  When the family finally stirred, I


caught</B>
<P><B>Angie in the kitchen fixing coffee, and making sure her two children</B>
<P><B>were not around (I didn't want to frighten them) I began to tell her


of</B>
<P><B>the attack. In the middle of my story, Angie interrupted me with the</B>
<P><B>exclamation, "You've felt it too!"  She went on to tell me that her</B>
<P><B>husband Ed had been awakened on several prior nights, sensing an evil</B>
<P><B>presence in the corner of their bedroom.  Though it had not attacked


him</B>
<P><B>physically, he had suffered hours of terror, awaiting daybreak, frozen


</B>
<P><B>with fear in his bed.  On two occasions, they had been awakened</B>
<P><B>suddenly, to witness their toy poodle, Sassy, being attacked by some</B>
<P><B>unseen force.  The poor dog had been lifted from her spot on the bed,</B>
<P><B>gasping and choking, suspended in mid air,  as though being strangled


by</B>
<P><B>an invisible hand. </B>
<P><B>This was not the only manifestations in this particular valley of


this</B>
<P><B>unknown evil.  Angie's aunt, who lived in the same valley, had been</B>
<P><B>disturbed in the night by unexplained sounds, and by the vision of
an</B>
<P><B>Old Hag, faced coated grotesquely in war paint, telling her that


death</B>
<P><B>was approaching for both Angie's aunt, and her family.  These</B>
<P><B>manifestations drove Angie's aunt and her family from their home. </B>
<P><B>Later, a group from a local church were contacted to come and bless


the</B>
<P><B>house they had vacated.  It was a newly built house, and the family


had</B>
<P><B>hopes of returning there.  Starting in the basement, the group began</B>
<P><B>praying, binding the evil spirit and anointing the house with oil.
 As</B>
<P><B>the traveled through the house, members of the group encountered cold</B>
<P><B>spots, and could feel the entity retreating upward, floor by floor,</B>
<P><B>until they reached the attic.  There, the presence was "cornered" in


a</B>
<P><B>dark area of the room.  The group, praying in earnest, closed in on


the</B>
<P><B>presence, and, just as the leader of the group entered the dark


corner,</B>
<P><B>taking authority over the spirit, and demanding that it go, a loud


"POP"</B>
<P><B>was heard, and tinkling glass.  The spirit was gone.   But there in


the</B>
<P><B>corner of the darkened attic, a huge, full length mirror, stored


there,</B>
<P><B>had shattered as the entity escaped.</B>
<P><B>Angie and her family moved soon after these occurrences, and


thankfully,</B>
<P><B>they have not been followed by whatever was present in the valley.
</B>
<P><B>Unfortunately, her aunt has not been so lucky.  Though the family</B>
<P><B>returned to their house after the "exorcism", within months, the


entity</B>
<P><B>had returned. The aunt, terrorized by the strange happenings there,</B>
<P><B>suffered a nervous breakdown, and as a result the family has moved</B>

</H3><P><B>by LennyFun1@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandma had 3 children and my dad was one of them and she would
go and stay with all of her children at 6 months at a time. It was time for
my grandma to leave our house and go to her daughters. I remember waving
goodbye to her and thinking that this may be the last time I see her since
she was 72. After she was gone for awhile we found out that she was inflicted


with stomach cancer.  Unfortunately it spread fast and she died in November
about 4 months after staying with us. I remember that night being in my bed,
the bed she slept in while she was here. I was laying there sobbing from
losing my favorite grandma. I had a lamp at the foot of my bed on a small
table, while laying there....... the lamp turned off.  I held my breath.
First thing that came to my mind is that my grandma came to me and turned
it off to let me know she was ok, at least thats what I hope happened.  This


bedroom of mine in my parents house has had its share of odd happenings.
My lamp turning off the night my grandma died was just the first one. Another


time I was just about to fall asleep and I felt my body start to slowly rise
from the bed. Being that I wasnt quite asleep I knew that I shouldnt be doing


this! So I quickly opened my eyes and felt my body slightly bounce back on
to the bed as if I was let go. I didnt know what to think and I just pretended


that I must have been dreaming or something. This bedroom has such a strange
oder to it. It smells old. No matter what my mother and I tried we couldnt
get rid of the smell. The other rooms don't have this smell. Then I find
out not to long ago just this year in fact, That my cousins' son had an


experience in that bedroom. When they were visiting me one time about 5 years
ago my cousin's son J.P. was playing with a Sega game in that bedroom and
he told his mom that something pushed him backwards by way of his forehead
on the bed he was sitting on. If you knew this kid you would know he wasnt
the type to lie or make up that story. Another time when I was living across
the street from my place of employment My sons girlfriend asked me if I had
seen anything strange happen in the kitchen because she had heard cupboard
doors shut when no one was in there. Then one summer day about 4 of us were


sitting in the living room of that apartment and all of a sudden the water
from the kitchen sink turned on. We all looked at each other knowing that
no one there was in the kitchen. My sons girlfriend  said to me, " thats
what I'm talking about. You have weird things going on in that kitchen" 
 I slowly went in the kitchen feeling awfully spooked and saw the faucet
on. The fixture was the kind with one arm that has to pivot to the right
or left for hot or cold. You also have to pull up on the handle to turn it
 on. The apartment wasnt old so there wasnt anything of previous dwellers
of years ago.</B>

<H3><A NAME=house>Haunted House in Greenville</A>
</H3><P><B>by mgriffith@stlnet.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was in the third grade our family moved to a small town in


Ohio.</B>
<P><B>We rented a house on the outskirts of town, next door to the National</B>
<P><B>Guard Armory.  This house gave me a creepy feeling, and I absolutely</B>
<P><B>refused to stay home alone with my brother and sister.  I always had


the</B>
<P><B>sensation of being watched.  My mother had the same feeling, and even</B>
<P><B>felt someone breath on the back of her neck one day while she was


doing</B>
<P><B>the dishes.  When she turned around, no one was there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day my mother left me and my brother home while she went to do


the</B>
<P><B>laundry.  I was instructed to be sure to lock the door after she


left.</B>
<P><B>Being a typical kid, I forgot to do so.  My brother and I played


records</B>
<P><B>for a while then he fell asleep on the couch.  Shortly after this,


the</B>
<P><B>back door came open about a foot.  The top portion of the back door


was</B>
<P><B>glass, and I could see the shadowy outline of a man with a hat on;


the</B>
<P><B>kind of hat men wore in the 50's movies.  I cowered behind a chaise</B>
<P><B>lounge in the corner and prayed my mother would come home soon.  When</B>
<P><B>she did, the image was gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On another occasion, at this same house, I saw a man looking in the</B>
<P><B>window from the front porch.  My mother went to check it out, but no


one</B>
<P><B>was there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The final straw was late one night after we were asleep my parents


went</B>
<P><B>to bed.  They were talking with the lights off, when all of a sudden</B>
<P><B>someone (something?) with a pair of heavy boots on took off running


down</B>
<P><B>the hall (wooden floors).  It started at their bedroom door.  My


father,</B>
<P><B>an unbeliever at the time, thought someone was in the house and took</B>
<P><B>chase.  By the time he reached the bedroom door, the intruder had


gone</B>
<P><B>down the stairs to the first landing.  He was out of my father's


range</B>
<P><B>of vision.  By the time my father reached the first landing, the</B>
<P><B>intruder was on the bottom landing and again out of my father's range


of</B>
<P><B>vision, since the stairs turned.  One point my father noticed as he</B>
<P><B>pursued the intruder down the stairs was that whoever/whatever it


was,</B>
<P><B>it had gone through a closed door without opening it.  (There was a


door</B>
<P><B>on the first landing of the stairs.)</B>
<P>
<P><B>My father pursued the intruder into the basement, thinking he had</B>
<P><B>trapped him/it.  There was no exit from the basement.  There was also


no</B>
<P><B>intruder.  My father spent several evenings trying to discover what


had</B>
<P><B>made the noise, but to no avail.  There just simply was no


explanation</B>
<P><B>that fit.  He moved into this house an unbeliever, and, after two</B>
<P><B>months, he moved out very much a believer.  He spent the rest of his</B>
<P><B>life reading everything he could find on ghosts and the supernatural.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This house was something like 100 years old at the time.  It had an</B>
<P><B>apple orchard next to it.  Rumor had it that the old man who lived


there</B>
<P><B>had killed his wife and buried her body in the apple orchard.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 15 years later, while living in Florida, a friend of ours came


to</B>
<P><B>visit.  He brought with him some friends of his that were visiting


from</B>
<P><B>out of state.  We got on the subject of haunted houses.  I told them


my</B>
<P><B>story, and, amazingly, they had had similar experiences in a house


they</B>
<P><B>lived in.  Come to find out it was the same house!!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>No one ever lived in this house for very long.  It would stand empty


for</B>
<P><B>months, you would see people move in, then two or three months later


you</B>
<P><B>would see them move out and the place would be empty again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The house is now gone, and a fast food restaurant stands in its


place.</B>
<P><B>I wonder if it's haunted as well?</B>

<H3><A NAME=tavern>Haunted Tavern</A>
</H3><P><B>by wolfmanz@execpc.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a letter carrier in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Recently I took over


a</B>
<P><B>route on the city's south side.  Before I even got started, some of


the</B>
<P><B>old timers started teasing and saying "Make sure you say hello to the</B>
<P><B>ghost" or have you seen ol Bob yet?"  Being somewhat skeptical by


nature</B>
<P><B>I just let these comments pass until one day in early June.  I had


just</B>
<P><B>entered the bar and started to hand the mail to the owner when a door</B>
<P><B>opened completely and no one came into the room.  The owner (Max)


payed</B>
<P><B>absolutely no attention to this until I asked if he saw what I saw.</B>
<P><B>    He just smiled and said "That door will not stay closed".  "My


dad</B>
<P><B>owned this place since the sixties,  I grew up in this tavern and no</B>
<P><B>matter what we try, that door will not stay shut.  I told Max that


some</B>
<P><B>of the guys at work claim his bar is haunted.  "They don't know the


half</B>
<P><B>of it." Max said with a smile.  Stop by after work sometime and I'll</B>
<P><B>tell you all about it.  Several weeks passed by and although I was</B>
<P><B>curious, I was not curious enough to visit this questionable</B>
<P><B>neighborhood on my own time.  Until one Saturday in September 97 when</B>
<P><B>Max told me he was having an estate sale in the bar.  He had items


laid</B>
<P><B>out all over the bar area and the downstairs kitchen.  The upstairs


had</B>
<P><B>6 rooms that had been rented out in the 30's and 40's. but were now</B>
<P><B>dusty and empty.  He had the upstairs and the entrance to the


basement</B>
<P><B>closed off with that yellow tape you see on TV crime shows.    I was


in</B>
<P><B>the kitchen looking at a blender when I felt someone standing right</B>
<P><B>behind me.  I quickly turned around and thought I saw a shadow out
of</B>
<P><B>the corner of my eye.  "Allright I'm ready to listen" I said to Max,</B>
<P><B>"but first I'll need a beer".  The building turns out to be one of


the</B>
<P><B>oldest in the city built before 1880.  There was a rooming house


accross</B>
<P><B>the street where workers from a local foundry lived.  On payday they</B>
<P><B>would cash their checks at the tavern and cut loose a little bit.


 Some</B>
<P><B>professional ladies plied their trade in the upstairs rooms at this</B>
<P><B>time.  In the early 20s a man died in the upstairs bathroom scalded


to</B>
<P><B>death in the bath tub.  It was assumed he fell asleep while drunk</B>
<P><B>although foul play was not ruled out.  The presence I felt in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen is thought to be one of the ladies who ran the kitchen for


many</B>
<P><B>years after she became less desirable to the patrons.  The most</B>
<P><B>frightening stories happened to Max himself.   In the late 1980s he


was</B>
<P><B>doing some remodeling and living upstairs at the tavern.  Although
he</B>
<P><B>admits to being tired he swears he was standing in the upstairs</B>
<P><B>bathroom, looked sideways and saw a man in clothing from the 30s or


40s</B>
<P><B>staring at him.  He looked again and there was no one there.  About
a</B>
<P><B>month later, he was sleeping in the bar on the floor, since he would


no</B>
<P><B>longer go upstairs, and he swears someone shook him awake and said</B>
<P><B>"Someones trying to break in!"  Thinking it was just a dream Max


turned</B>
<P><B>over and went back to sleep until the police were at the door with
a</B>
<P><B>burgler in tow!  There are many more stories from several eye


witnesses</B>
<P><B>which I will save for another time. </B>

</H3><P><B>by Basd1@flash.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Supposedly, Bldg 900, The Air Training Command (now Air Education And


Training Command) Headquarters Bldg is haunted by the ghost of Gen James
Simler, a former Commander of ATC once stationed at Randolph. </B>
<P><B>    The story is: In 1982 General Simler was leaving Randolph and ATC
to take over as Commander of one of the other Air Force Commands, but was
killed in a crash on Randolph's runway on take off while attempting an aileron


roll. He loved doing aileron rolls (some pilots call them Victory Rolls)
in Viet-Nam after some of the missions he flew.</B>
<P><B>     General Simler was in the back seat of the fighter he and his
Aide de Camp was in, and something mechanically failed on the plane as they


rotated for take-off. Instead of pulling out as usual, the planed nose dived
into the ground exploding on impact halfway through one of those "Victory
Rolls".  Both he and his Aide de Camp were killed instantly. </B>
<P><B>    On the third floor of bldg 900, down the hallway leading to and
from the Commander''s office are portraits of each former Air Training Command


Commander. Over each portrait, is a light that lights each portrait. Sometimes


after the lights have been turned out each night, a security check is


accomplished at specified times. One can go back up and the light above General


Simler's will be back on.  This doesn't happen on a regular basis, but as
if the Genral is saying, "I'm watching you to make sure you're doing your
job." At other times, the smell of General Simler's cologne can be sensed
in the hallway. </B>
<P><B>    At different times, people who have worked in the building and
the last to leave the third floor, have reported hearing footsteps following
them on the carpeted floor.</B>
<P><B>Once when working in the building, I have personally seen doors, that
were closed  on one security check, be standing open on the next security
check. This during those hours when only myself and another co-worker were
on duty.</B>
<P><B>    All doors entering the building, have security cameras viewing
the entrances 24 hours a day, so it is impossible for someone to enter the


building and not be seen.</B>
<P><B>I got used to the "feelings" and strange noises heard once in a great


while, while others sometimes were un-nerved.  But if you were a newly assigned


person, sooner or later, General Simler "introduces" himself to you in one
way or other.</B>

<H3><A NAME=a>A Haunting</A>
</H3><P><B>by CONCETT@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Years ago in a small town in N.J. almost a whole city block was taken


up</B>
<P><B>by a very large funeral parlors..  When it was torn down..they


decided</B>
<P><B>to built 8 new houses on that property.</B>
<P><B>My mother bought one of the houses and my aunt both one too.</B>
<P><B>My moms backyard faced the area where they had the slabs for their</B>
<P><B>bodies..they had left the cement there...</B>
<P><B>It started one night...I was sound asleep and flet like someone was</B>
<P><B>shoving my arm as if they wanted to wake me..I quickly opened my eyes</B>
<P><B>and there was no one there...</B>
<P><B>Also in this room there was one very cold spot.</B>
<P><B>My dad was a tough Italian man..not into ghosts or such...He also</B>
<P><B>complained to my mom</B>
<P><B>to stop shoving his arm when he as asleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I always though if I ever saw a ghost I would die of fright....I


didnt'</B>
<P><B>but when I saw one I was actually paralyzed with fear...</B>
<P><B>In the same room..this happened .I was sleeping and all of a sudden
I</B>
<P><B>dont know why I opened my eyes..to the left of my bed was a figure</B>
<P><B>floating above my little sister...I don't know why I knew it was a


young</B>
<P><B>girl but I did.</B>
<P><B>There werent' any facial features...but again I knew it was a</B>
<P><B>girl...they eyes were hollow and her hands were stretched out over
my</B>
<P><B>little sister...I closed my eyes hoping it would leave.</B>
<P><B>When I opened them it was still there....</B>
<P><B>I started to pray very hard.....in the middle of my prayer it


left.....I</B>
<P><B>never saw it again..but I was so scared for my sister.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another occasion was  when I was sleeping I woke up to a big crash
in</B>
<P><B>the kitchen...it sounded as if all the dishes and pots and pans were</B>
<P><B>being thrown to the floor....I ran out to the kitched and there stood


my</B>
<P><B>mom...we looked at each other and then looked at the floor.</B>
<P><B>She stried to defuse the situation saying it must have been from the</B>
<P><B>tenants upstairs...</B>
<P><B>I asked them the next day and they said there were asleept at that


time.</B>
<P><B>We had the basement finished off and at times I slept there too..One</B>
<P><B>night I heard alot of voices and heavy footsteps all over..like a


bunch</B>
<P><B>of people walking.....I froze again...I couldn't even open my mouth


to</B>
<P><B>call to my mom who was upstairs.....it was as if I was yelling but
no</B>
<P><B>sound came out of me....</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well..more happened but these are the things that  really scared me..</B>
<P><B>After my mom sold the house....and years later we start talking about</B>
<P><B>the house...and my mom said she never wanted to tell me but she had


seen</B>
<P><B>a little boy in the living room watching her while she was working</B>
<P><B>around the house.</B>
<P><B>She also said her pocket book flew to another room.</B>
<P><B>Now my mom is a level headed person not prone to hysterics or


believes</B>
<P><B>in ghosts...so if she said she saw this  she sure did.</B>
<P><B>My aunt also complained(in her house) that she heard someone coming


up</B>
<P><B>her stairs from the basemen to the kitchen door..but thats when it</B>
<P><B>stopped...</B>
<P><B>I thank God I  never saw or heard anything like that again my life...</B>
<P><B>Interesting too is the fact that  every house from the first one on


on</B>
<P><B>the block..to the five after..</B>
<P><B>were marred by divorces..strange all in a row.</B>
<P><B>There was also a shooting in one of them.</B>
<P><B>Oh yes I also was part of the divorce line there.</B>
<P><B>Well. that's my experience...if someone asked me if I believed in


ghosts</B>
<P><B>or whatever these things were that happened ....I would laugh at</B>
<P><B>them....But seeing is believing and I would be willing to take a lie</B>
<P><B>detector test to substantiate this.....others may laugh or not


believe</B>
<P><B>but there is somethings we  can't explain .........What these things


are</B>
<P><B>I don't know I'm not an expert..but they exist and I now believe...</B>

<H3><A NAME=lonely>The Lonely Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by akhogpm@get2net.dk </B>
<P>
<P><B>The story is happening in Dalmose, Denmark.</B>
<P><B>When my family, my horse, and I, moved to Denmark in 1994, a ghost


moved</B>
<P><B>with us. I don't know where from, any how and why, but the ghost


started</B>
<P><B>hunting me.</B>
<P><B>It all started, when my friend and I went out to feed my horse.</B>
<P><B>It was a dark fall day, so we were nearly running. Suddenly I saw


something</B>
<P><B>standing beside me, and I turned around to see what it was. The thing


was</B>
<P><B>like a fog, but formed like a human, a girl with face and clothes.
And it</B>
<P><B>was standing right beside my friend. I was shocked, so was my friend.


The</B>
<P><B>only thing we could say was: " Did you saw that too?". We wasen't


sure</B>
<P><B>about the sight of the ghostgirl, so we just continued our work.</B>
<P><B>A little week after.</B>
<P><B>We were sitting in my room and talking. Suddenly something was


walking</B>
<P><B>outside the window. We knew for sure, nobody, but us, were home at


that</B>
<P><B>time. So we went out for a look. And there she was again, the


ghostgirl.</B>
<P><B>The mystery continued for about a month, without any troubles. </B>
<P><B>But one day we were going for a walk, we heard a voice from one of


the</B>
<P><B>corners in the field. The voice sounded like a child, who was crying.


Since</B>
<P><B>that day, the horse were afraid for that corner. </B>
<P><B>A lot of strange things took place, and we were scared. We didn't


tell</B>
<P><B>anyone, course they would think that we were crazy. So we kept it as


a</B>
<P><B>secret.</B>
<P><B>My interest for horses was going away. So I decided to sell my horse.</B>
<P><B>When the horse was sold and the new owner picked him up. Nothing ever</B>
<P><B>happened since then.</B>
