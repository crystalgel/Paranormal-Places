<P><B>Members of my generation of my family have been visited by a ghost.
 </B>
<P><B>This encounter happened when I was 3.  I woke up early in the morning

</B>
<P><B>to find a young, very life-like boy in early 1900's French clothing
</B>
<P><B>standing in my closet ( where I kept all my toys). </B>
<P><B> "These are my toys...this is my room," he said in an annoyed and </B>
<P><B>aggressive tone. </B>
<P><B>    Frankly, this scared the you-know-what out of me and I ran scared

</B>
<P><B>into my parents bedroom and told them (crying) that there was a boy
in </B>
<P><B>my room.  Both of my parents returned to my room to find nothing of
the </B>
<P><B>sort, and the only reason they have ever believed this is that the
same </B>
<P><B>the happened to my older sister before I was born.  My older cousin
has </B>
<P><B>told that he was visited by this child, and we now refer to the ghost

</B>
<P><B>as Pierre.  My other younger cousin has never been encountered, so
I </B>
<P><B>guess Pierre found his place.  Except that my family is French, I've
</B>
<P><B>made no connection between the ghost and my family.   </B>
<P><B>    No other supernatural encounter has happened except the eerie event

</B>
<P><B>when I was five.  I was in the living room of my house and I think
I </B>
<P><B>was watching television, but I honestly can't remember.  In the room,

</B>
<P><B>the couch is directly across the room from the t.v.  A door on the
left </B>
<P><B>leads to the kitchen, and on the right side of the room about 15 feet

</B>
<P><B>from the couch is a small, half enclosed bar.  </B>
<P><B>    In the bar, there is a glass shelf that holds all of our liquor
</B>
<P><B>glasses (Note: All glasses are upside down and of course empty).</B>
<P><B>I was on the couch when a crystal wine glass full of wine flew across

</B>
<P><B>the room and shattered on the tile kitchen floor.  Directly after that,

</B>
<P><B>the light bulbs in the bar (hung from the ceiling) flickered as the
</B>
<P><B>bulbs shook rather violently back and forth.  Our carpet still carries

</B>
<P><B>a stain from the wine.</B>

<H3><A NAME="old farm">The Old Farm House</A>
</H3><P><B>by STU950341@GCC.EDU</B>
<P>
<P><B>My aunt lives in an old farm-house in Wellsville, NY. The house has
a </B>
<P><B>strange history which I think might have explained what I saw there.
</B>
<P><B>Wheither it was a ghost or not, I can't tell, because I saw it when
I was </B>
<P><B>very young and it might have been the product of my imagination.

Anyways,</B>
<P><B>her house is kind of old, and during the fifties or sixties a young
man </B>
<P><B>lived there with his mother who was insane. One day the man went into

</B>
<P><B>town to get some stuff, and while he was gone his mother burned down
the </B>
<P><B>barn and killed herself. The foundation of the old barn is still there

</B>
<P><B>and my cousin, my brother, and myself used to dig up the old, burnt
</B>
<P><B>animal bones which we thought were dinosaur bones. </B>
<P>
<P><B>One night while I was eight years old, I was sleeping in my cousin's
</B>
<P><B>room, which also happened to have been the old lady's. I remember being

</B>
<P><B>awaken suddenly and when I opened my eyes I saw a black figure that
</B>
<P><B>looked like a shadow, but was standing over me. It had no facail features

</B>
<P><B>but I saw what looked like hands curled and held out over me. The figure

</B>
<P><B>didn't move at all. I couldn't move either. I was terrified and all
I </B>
<P><B>could do was close my eyes. While I had my eyes closed, I thought that
I </B>
<P><B>had to do something, or else the figure would get my brother or my
</B>
<P><B>cousin, who were both asleep and didn't see anything. I still could
not </B>
<P><B>move, but I opened my eyes, which took a great deal of will power to
do. </B>
<P><B>The figure was still there, but it seemed to shrink or move backwards

</B>
<P><B>into the adjoining room, which was kind of like a large closet. Even
as </B>
<P><B>it move away, however, I did not change position or give any indication

</B>
<P><B>that it was anything more than a shadow. As soon as it was gone I raced

</B>
<P><B>down stairs to where my parents and my aunt and uncle were talking.
I </B>
<P><B>couldn't go to sleep that night. Lately, I think what I saw might have

</B>
<P><B>been a shadow of tree from a passing headlight, but the way it behaved

</B>
<P><B>(or the way I remember it behaving) it would have been quite the </B>
<P><B>illusion. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Another interesting thing happened at that house, this time to my aunt.

</B>
<P><B>The man who owned the house prior to her was a friendly old man named

</B>
<P><B>Dale. Dale died of natural causes and there is no reason that he might
be </B>
<P><B>haunting the house. Dale was, however, extremely attached to the house,

</B>
<P><B>and as a consequence, whenever something strange (keys missing etc.)
</B>
<P><B>happened in the house they would jokingly make some comment about Dale's

</B>
<P><B>ghost being responsable. One night there was a bad thunderstorm. Mu
aunt </B>
<P><B>was watching TV alone when all of the sudden, the screen went blank
and </B>
<P><B>the TV begain to move slowly toward the wall. My aunt was scared, of
</B>
<P><B>course, but it turns out the storm had knocked over their sattelite
dish </B>
<P><B>and as it fell the cable had dragged the TV toward the wall. </B>

</H3><P><B>by jmckee@goodnet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I retired in 1987 my wife and I relocated to a small town in</B>
<P><B>Kentucky and purchased a historical property that was built in 1790
for an</B>
<P><B>ancestor of mine, James McKee, by master stone mason, John Metcalf
and his</B>
<P><B>brother.  The home was a three story structure that had been

beautifully</B>
<P><B>preserved through the years and was a lovely home to entertain in.

 There</B>
<P><B>was just one small</B>
<P><B>problem....The place was haunted!</B>
<P><B>	My wife and I grew quite apprehensive in the wee hours of the morning

a</B>
<P><B>day or so after moving in.  We were both awakened by the scuffling,</B>
<P><B>shuffling footsteps coming from the  attic directly over our bed in

the</B>
<P><B>large master bedroom.  It sounded as though the ghost was interested

in</B>
<P><B>viewing the contents of some of the boxes we had stored there the

previous</B>
<P><B>day, for we could hear the distinct noise of cardboard on lumber that

was</B>
<P><B>made as they were slid around for inspection.</B>
<P><B>	We prudently decided the next morning at first light would be soon

enough</B>
<P><B>to check into it and after listening for a while, the noises subsided

and</B>
<P><B>we both finally got back to sleep.  The following morning I journeyed

up</B>
<P><B>the creaky steps to the dark attic and as you might expect, saw

nothing</B>
<P><B>out of the ordinary.  The boxes were unharmed and didn't appear to
be</B>
<P><B>scattered at all. </B>
<P><B>	We chalked it up as an interesting experience and before we had sold

the</B>
<P><B>home and moved six years later, the following incidents took place

that</B>
<P><B>amused us more than frightened us:</B>
<P><B>	Item:  On a bright sunshiny day as I was in the front foyer

refinishing</B>
<P><B>an antique armoire, I heard the distinct sounds of footsteps  pacing

back</B>
<P><B>and forth with strong, measured paces in the guest bedroom above the</B>
<P><B>library.  I was the only person in the house with the exception of
my 2</B>
<P><B>dogs.  The pacing continued for about 15 minutes before subsiding.</B>
<P><B>	Item: on numerous occasions, the spirit has tapped me on the

shoulder</B>
<P><B>(always during the daytime), or whistled as if to get our attention.</B>
<P><B>	Item:  Our dog on several occasions was observed in the front foyer</B>
<P><B>looking into the library toward the large fireplace barking and

growling</B>
<P><B>loudly.  Every hair on her back was raised.  This was always during

the</B>
<P><B>daylight hours and upon investigation of the cause of her anxiety,

neither</B>
<P><B>my wife or I ever observed anything untoward in the library that

should</B>
<P><B>upset her.  After a few minutes she would cease barking, cock her head

to</B>
<P><B>the side as if to understand where the object of her attack had</B>
<P><B>disappeared to, snort loudly and trot off proudly.</B>
<P><B>	Item: At 5:30 AM. the morning following Halloween, my wife discovered

a</B>
<P><B>candle votive to be lit inside one of the 2 jack-o-lanterns in the

dark</B>
<P><B>kitchen.  She thought I had lit it to scare her and I assured her I

had</B>
<P><B>not, and further, there was no possible way it could have been left</B>
<P><B>burning all night, for the votive would have been used up, and the
lid of</B>
<P><B>the jack-o-lantern would have been charred. The lid was only tanned

and</B>
<P><B>warm to the touch.   Hmmmm.</B>
<P><B>	Item: the following Halloween, as my wife and I started upstairs for

bed</B>
<P><B>after the trick or treaters had all stopped coming around;  I made
a</B>
<P><B>statement to her that the ghost had behaved himself very well all</B>
<P><B>night....Before the words were out of my mouth, the grandfather clock

in</B>
<P><B>the foyer at the foot of the stairs chimed 1 o'clock.  The time was

10:23</B>
<P><B>P.M. . The clock had never done that before or since.</B>
<P><B>	These things sound strange, but I can assure you, they happened!</B>

</H3><P><B>by kjl@cray.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This incident happened in November of 1994. It was a blustery fall
night and I was </B>
<P><B>leaving my apartment, located on the edge of town,  to attend night
school.  A block </B>
<P><B>or so down the street is an isolated road that is about a half mile
long that </B>
<P><B>connects with main road leading out of my neighborhood This is the
same road that</B>
<P><B>I used to goto work, school and take nightly walks when I can't sleep.
As I turned </B>
<P><B>onto this road I thought, at first, my headlights flashed onto a jogger.
So I swerved </B>
<P><B>to miss him, but when I looked there was nothing there. After breathing
a sign of </B>
<P><B>relief I continued on my way. Driving approximately 35 - 40 MPH I continued

down </B>
<P><B>this road when I noticed through the corner of my eye some sort of
white object </B>
<P><B>flapping in the wind. At first I thought it was a plastic, white super

market bag </B>
<P><B>that had snagged itself on the side of my car.  But when I turned to
look at it... </B>
<P><B>it was gone. I looked away to focus on the road  and again it reappeared

flapping </B>
<P><B>in the wind. As soon as I turned to look, it again disappeared. A little

confused </B>
<P><B>as to what my eye was telling me I looked again but this time the white

object floated </B>
<P><B>across the hood my car and floated "straight" into an abandon gravel
pit / wooded area. </B>
<P><B>It wasn't affected by winds that were blowing that night.  I wasn't
a bit frighten </B>
<P><B>by what I witnessed but tried to find a logical answer; what is debris
or ... something </B>
<P><B>else? I still to this day can not figure out what I had seen. Was it
some white plastic </B>
<P><B>debris that my car picked up? Garbage doesn't float  straight across
your car, it </B>
<P><B>usually rolls up and over. I still continued to drive and walk this
area until I </B>
<P><B>move out the following spring. But I never saw... what ever it was...

again. </B>

<P>
<P><B>When I was five, my family moved from Port Huron Michigan to Portland

Oregon.  Th We moved into a beautiful Old Portland home, three stories plus
and attic.</B>
<P><B>The year prior to our move, the family who lived in that home experienced
a horrible tragedy.  Their 5 year old son was hit by a car and killed outside
the home.  They moved away.</B>
<P><B>The first night I slept there, I slept upstairs with my sister.  I
was horrified of the bathroon closet.  Inside the bathroon closet, there
was a door to the attic.  I kept saying there were ghosts up there to my
parents.  They thought I was just being imaginative.</B>
<P><B>My mother had a collection of wind chimes, and as she also had a collection

of teenage and near teen age children in my brothers and sister, she hung
one of the wind chimes on the front door.  </B>
<P><B>At least once a week, those chimes would ring with no earthly reason.</B>
<P><B>As I grew older, the activity in the home, the non-earthly activity,
seemed to focus on me.  Mostly it was playful.  My room, which I had just
cleaned would be ransacked while I was at school.  My toys would disappear.

 Normal prank things.</B>
<P><B>In my early teens, I saw something in the hallway.  A little boy. 
And I knew his name instantly.  His name was David.   I walked towards him
and poof, he was gone.  Armed with a name, I asked our landlord who the little

boy was.  It appears the little boy who was killed was named David.</B>
<P><B>My friends and I decided to play with and Ouija board, upstairs in
my room.  I asked why David was still here.</B>
<P><B>The board spelled out, slowly I might add, david knew he was dead,
but that he wanted to be my friend.  He would be with me always.</B>
<P><B>I freaked out a little.  Knowing you are going to have ghost for life
is a little strange.  But once I got over it, the thought was comforting.
 David continued to play pranks on my for years, and he still does.</B>
<P><B>When I started dating, David would signal his disapprova of any particular

date  by stealing my shoes.  I don't mean I lost them.  I would place them
on my bed, turn around to get something out of my closet.  When I reached
for the shoes, they were gone.  If I broke up with the boy, the shoes would
FALL from the sky and land in front of my parents and I.</B>
<P><B>Now that I am married, David torments my poor husband by stealing car
keys, medication, ties anythings small and replacable.</B>
<P><B>All in all, David is a friendly little boy, who just wants a friend.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My grandparents owned a Greek Revival frame farmhouse, </B>
<P><B>built in te 1830's, on Cape Cod.  It was passed on to my </B>
<P><B>mother and two uncles when they died.  I remember spending </B>
<P><B>very many happy summer days visiting there when I was a </B>
<P><B>child, and I loved waking up in my little dormer room to </B>
<P><B>the sound of the gulls, the smell of the ocean, and the </B>
<P><B>sounds of early risers.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After both grandparents had died, our families still spent </B>
<P><B>a couple of weeks a year there, overlapping a week so that </B>
<P><B>we could visit together.  One year, when I was about 15, my </B>
<P><B>uncle and his family left to return home about 9:00 in the </B>
<P><B>morning, leaving the house blessedly quiet!  My mom, dad, </B>
<P><B>and I had been sitting downstairs in the family room, all </B>
<P><B>reading, when overhead, from the attic, we heard about a </B>
<P><B>half dozen heavy footsteps, headed towards the stair.  We </B>
<P><B>all sat there, not saying a single word, trying to pretend </B>
<P><B>we didn't hear, when my father got up, saying,"I'll check </B>
<P><B>the dining room."  He returned, having found nothing.  He </B>
<P><B>then asked my mother and me if we had heard anything.  We </B>
<P><B>both nodded.  This is especially remarkable as my dad was </B>
<P><B>the kind to believe in just about any crazy thing, and my </B>
<P><B>mom is the kind to only believe what she sees, and even </B>
<P><B>then maybe not.  We all knew there was absolutely no one </B>
<P><B>else in the house.  We settled on the explanation that it </B>
<P><B>was my grandfather's ghost footsteps that we heard, as this </B>
<P><B>house was his very favorite spot on earth, and he used to </B>
<P><B>sleep in the attic, waking early each morning to work in </B>
<P><B>his garden.  I can still remember hearing his workboots </B>
<P><B>clomp across the attic floor in the early morning.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To this day, both my husband and a good friend have both </B>
<P><B>heard the footsteps.  Both thought another person had </B>
<P><B>caused them -- persons accounted for outside the house or </B>
<P><B>in another part of the house.  Neither had been told of the </B>
<P><B>original story.  Both uncles think we're completely full of </B>
<P><B>it, even when mom corroborates the story.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Go grampa!</B>
<P>
<P><B>p.s.  A cousin's wife said she saw a lady in black standing </B>
<P><B>at the foot of the bed one night when they were visiting.  </B>
<P><B>Isn't it ironic that none of us can quite swallow that one </B>
<P><B>even when expecting them to believe our own stories?</B>
<P>
<P><B>How come I always hear them, but I never see them?</B>

<H3><A NAME="spirit encounter">My personal Spirit Encounter</A>
</H3><P><B>by jbrady@vnet.ibm.com</B>
<P><B>Hello my Name Is Kevin I have something that is not a story but the
truth. Here it is.</B>
<P><B>I was about 1 years old when my mothers friend who is a Psychic and
her friend went into a Quigy board. They found a spirit named Regis who is
still to this day their guider through life. Well during this they let out
a spirit by the name of Marhta. Martha is a poltergise and despite what the
movie say's that is not a demon. A Poltergise is a thief or a trickster.
Well we did not have contact with Marhta or Regis until I was about 11 years
old when My mother work with her friend in a doctors office..</B>
<P><B>Martha would call my mother at work. She would talk or even use Morse
code. This was fine I even talked to Martha.. But she began to steel from
us.. But even though we blamed each other we knew it was her.. This went
on for about a year.. Than Martha stopped calling etc..... for about 3-4
months.. She came back but diffrent.. I was in my mothers office when I saw
a sphere that was clear almost appear.. It chased me and my mother or her
boss did not see it.... Than about a week later I was in school and it appeared

again.. This time it was what I would say trying to attack me.. it charged
and ramed at me..</B>
<P><B>This became annouying so I went to my mothers friend and asked her
to tell Martha to leave me alone.. It worked.. Than about 3 years later.
I woke up and my head was cut open and bleeding.. I did not know where it
came from..  woke my mother up and she cleaned the cut and looked to see
what cut me.. Well while doing this another cut opened on my cheek infront
of my mother.. It just opened out of no where.. at this time we went to the

Doctor to get it checked.. he said there was no cut. Blood was just coming

out.... This continued for about 6 months..</B>
<P><B>Than the day I turned 16 I was out with my girlfriend with my license
and an old car. Well the car flipped over 4 times. But I was not hurt nor
was my girlfriend..</B>
<P><B>Then about 2 months later me and my family went upstate to the catskills..

Like we did every summer... It was normal until july 23 when I was in my
room playing nintendo and a Native American figure apeared through my nintendo
on the floor with force and lifted me up yelling "It is my land..... No

technology" It was hanging me by my shirt. I was about 2 feet off the ground.
I tried to screem and my voice just was no more. I could not talk... I was
thrown into a wall and knocked out.. While I was knocked out the other spirit

regis came to me. He said that Martha is pissed that she cant get to the
other side and it was to late to help her.. He than said "I will try" and
I woke up and the Nintendo was never touch and neither was I. I figured that
the attack was to warn me...</B>
<P><B>About 7-8 months later, I was once again attack by this Native American..

When Regis appeared he told me to stand to Martha with Quigy board in hand
and write out go back you can make it.. When I awoke once again I was never

touched.. I went to my addict got the Quigy Board and waited for Martha.
It was about 7 hours later when She came in the sphere shape. I did what
Regis told me.. She neglected to pay attaention until I wrote it out.. she
than dissapeared instently..... </B>
<P><B>That was the last I saw her but one more time I was aproched by Regis
he told me that it might not hold.. And I must destroy the board I had NO
proble with that. So I did.. But since than weired stuff has happened. Which

craft books have appeared in my home and Satanic bibles as well.. My Parents
and I put crosses in every room and since then nothing and I say nothing
has happened...</B>

<H3><A NAME=horid>A Pastors's Horrid Prayer</A>
</H3><P><B>by barnesp@kic.or.jp</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was younger my grandmother (who is an avid pentecostal</B>
<P><B>christian) told me a true story that her church pastor, at the time,</B>
<P><B>told his congregation.	</B>
<P><B>	He told of a student pastor who he was in college with that claimed

not</B>
<P><B>to believe in the devil, demons, or evil spirits. He believed that
a</B>
<P><B>truly holy God would not create such a thing and despite the

professor's</B>
<P><B>teachings, he would not agree that they existed. </B>
<P><B>	He eventually began praying to god to show him one of the demons if</B>
<P><B>they in fact existed. He prayed every day several times a day in

hopes</B>
<P><B>of seeing what he did not believe in. After weeks of this he began
to</B>
<P><B>lose faith in the Lord, so he began praying to the devil himself. He</B>
<P><B>prayed two or three days straight, several times per day and finally

had</B>
<P><B>just about given up. One evening while sitting at home watching t.v.

he</B>
<P><B>heard a unfamiliar sound that originated at the far end of his

hallway.</B>
<P><B>Still sitting in his chair, he looked down the hall as far as his

angle</B>
<P><B>on it would permit. At the point at which he could not see any

further</B>
<P><B>down the corridor appeared a burnt orange glow that seemed to get</B>
<P><B>brighter as if it were coming down the hall. </B>
<P><B>	The pastor did not scare easily according to the story and stood

fast</B>
<P><B>as the glow and the now undescribably horrid sounds neared his end
of</B>
<P><B>the hallway. </B>
<P><B>	Finally a figure appeared near the living room end of the hall and

the</B>
<P><B>pastor described to his colleagues the most fear instilling,

grotesque</B>
<P><B>creature that he could muster.</B>
<P><B>	Now, filled with the worst fear he had ever felt he began to pray
to</B>
<P><B>God to intervene and deliver him from this evil beast. He began to</B>
<P><B>shout,"I plead the blood of Jesus over this home!" </B>
<P><B>	After several of these plees the figure dissipated and the sound

muted.</B>
<P><B>The pastor told his story to all his colleagues, his professor and

most</B>
<P><B>of his congregations thereafter........</B>
<P>
<P><B>	This story is true to the best of my knowlege.</B>

<P><B>Inn.  There was a little introduction to the Inn in our room which
stated</B>
<P><B>that there was a ghost at the Inn.  She was reported to appear from
the</B>
<P><B>waist up and it was said that she had beautiful red hair.  Anyway,
my</B>
<P><B>husband didn't believe in ghosts and just blew it off.  The first night
we</B>
<P><B>slept there I was so tired that a nuclear blast wouldn't have awakened
me. </B>
<P><B>The next morning, my husband asked me if I had seen the bright light
in the</B>
<P><B>room.  Of course I hadn't because I had slept like a rock.  He didn't
say</B>
<P><B>too much more about it.  The last night of our stay we had packed all
of</B>
<P><B>our hard luggage which consisted of 2 pieces and they were standing
right</B>
<P><B>infront of the door to our room, next to the bed.  At 2:30 am I awoke
to a</B>
<P><B>loud bang.  I looked over my husband towards the door and my suitcases
were</B>
<P><B>rocking back and forth into each other.  My husband woke up and watched
for</B>
<P><B>a few seconds and then it stopped.  We went back to sleep and left
the next</B>
<P><B>morning without even mentioning it to the Innkeeper.  My husband
believes</B>
<P><B>in ghosts now.</B>

<H3><A NAME="haunted apartment">Haunted Apartment in Okinawa</A>
</H3><P><B>by rudym@kdn0.attnet.or.jp</B>
<P>
<P><B>When my husband was stationed to Kadena AFB, in Okinawa you are required
</B>
<P><B>to live off base until housing on base becomes avialable.  We were
lucky </B>
<P><B>enough to find a large two bedroom apartment that was on the third
</B>
<P><B>floor, just outside gate five.  Only americans lived in the complex,
</B>
<P><B>Okinawans won't live in a place that is haunted or thought to be, but
I </B>
<P><B>really don't know if that's why they didn't live there or not.  Anyway,
</B>
<P><B>nothing weird happened for about the first two months, then on night
I </B>
<P><B>was washing up the dishes from dinner and while I was rinsing the silver
</B>
<P><B>ware, I had accidently put the steak knives in the drainer with the
</B>
<P><B>blades facing up.  While I was rinsing some plates and putting them
in </B>
<P><B>the draining rack, I scraped my arm on the blades of the knives.  So,
I </B>
<P><B>turned them all over blades down and went back washing dishes.  My
</B>
<P><B>husband came in and was talking to me for a few moments, and when I
got </B>
<P><B>through rinsing some dishes and was in the process of putting them
in </B>
<P><B>the rack, I discovered all the knives were turned over again with the
</B>
<P><B>blades up.  This shocked me, and I asked my husband if he turned them
</B>
<P><B>over while he was talking to me, and he said that he had not.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The next thing that happened, was around Christmas.  My husband was
</B>
<P><B>sitting at the desk working on the computer when all of a sudden he
</B>
<P><B>gasped, jerked his glasses off and scooted his chair back all at the
</B>
<P><B>same time.  My son and I asked him what was the matter and he said
that </B>
<P><B>something poked him in the forehead just above his left eyebrow.  After
</B>
<P><B>he calmed down, he decided that it was a muscle spasm and went back
to </B>
<P><B>the computer.  About ten or so minutes my son, who was sitting in the
</B>
<P><B>front room yelled, "Mom! There's smoke comming out of the bathroom
and </B>
<P><B>it's going up the hall!"  By the time I got in there it had
disappeared.</B>
<P><B>I asked him what it looked like, and he said like a grey smoke or mist
</B>
<P><B>that floated up the hall toward the front door and vanished.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Then things would turn up missing, you would tear the house up looking
</B>
<P><B>for them and then you would find them in plain sight.  And, I would
</B>
<P><B>always see these dark darting shadows from the corner of my eyes. 
At </B>
<P><B>first I thought it was someone passing be the front window, but as
time </B>
<P><B>went on I noticed that there was never anyone there.  You could aways
</B>
<P><B>feel the cool breeze sweep across the floor, I seems to just happen
to </B>
<P><B>me.  One afternoon, I was at the sink filling ice trays and the cold
</B>
<P><B>breeze blew just on the right side of my face, it blew my hair on that
</B>
<P><B>side and felt like someones was touching me.  Now, I know what you
are </B>
<P><B>gonna say, and no I did't have any windows open, no fans going, and
</B>
<P><B>the airconditioner was not on,(It was still early spring).  About that
</B>
<P><B>time, eary April, our neighbors upstairs moved on base.  Their apartment
</B>
<P><B>stayed empty for three weeks and during that time you could hear </B>
<P><B>footsteps.  The would sound heavy like an adults, or run like a childs.
</B>
<P><B>You could hear furniture being dragged across the floor, rapping, </B>
<P><B>tappings, and bangings.  I thought someone must have moved in and went
</B>
<P><B>upstair to meet the new family, only to find that the apartment was
</B>
<P><B>still empty. </B>
<P>
<P><B>During the last of May we were getting ready to move on base and the
</B>
<P><B>activity increased.  I was taking a nap and my son came in and woke
me </B>
<P><B>up.  He was a little scared and told me he saw a ghost.  So, I got
up </B>
<P><B>and he showed me where he saw it.  There is a small hall that leads
to </B>
<P><B>the bathroom and on one side is a small japanese washer and on the
other </B>
<P><B>side is a sink with a large mirror.  He was trying to pull out a loose
</B>
<P><B>tooth, he is eleven, and he had climbed up in the sink to see better.
 </B>
<P><B>While he was wiggling his tooth, the happened to look up and in the
</B>
<P><B>mirror he could see a greyish thing watching him. It was peeking from
</B>
<P><B>the right side of the washer.  He said it was kind of wrinkled and
had </B>
<P><B>black holes where it's eyes were, a slit for a mouth and looked kind
of </B>
<P><B>skull like.  He said it startled him and when he turned to look at
it it </B>
<P><B>vanished.  He thought he was just seeing something and blew it off
and </B>
<P><B>went back to wiggling his tooth.  He looked up in the mirror again
and </B>
<P><B>there it was, only this time it was peeking from the left side of the
</B>
<P><B>washer and again it vanished when he turned to look at him.  That's
when </B>
<P><B>he came an got me.  It wouldn't show it's self to me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day my son and I was playing a computer game and we heard
this </B>
<P><B>crash come from my bedroom.  We got up to see what it was and my lamp
</B>
<P><B>had been knocked off in the floor.  Now there is no way it could have
</B>
<P><B>just fell of on it's own, it is heavy about 15 or 20 pounds.  We cleaned
</B>
<P><B>up the mess and when my husband came home from work I told him what
had </B>
<P><B>happened.  Well, later on that night I got dressed for bed and I decided
</B>
<P><B>to look at my coins, I have several including three mercury head dimes.
</B>
<P><B> I got out my magnifing glass and was digging through my collection
</B>
<P><B>looking for a certin mercury dime.  It wasn't there, I found the other
</B>
<P><B>two, but I couldn't find the one I was looking for.  So, I tore up
my </B>
<P><B>bedroom looking for it, I went through my nightstand, drawers and under
</B>
<P><B>the bed, but I couldn't find it.  I finally gave up and put the coins
</B>
<P><B>away and went to sleep.  In the morning when I woke up, guess what,
it </B>
<P><B>was laying on my night stand right beside my head.  Now, I know for
a </B>
<P><B>fact there was nothing on there when I went to bed, cause the lamp
had </B>
<P><B>fell of earlier that day and there was nothing left.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The last thing that happened, was when we had moved everything out
of </B>
<P><B>the apartment and all that was left was the gov't furniture that they
</B>
<P><B>were going to pick up the next day.  We were cleaning the furniture
as </B>
<P><B>well as the apartment, my husband was in the bedroom and I was in the
</B>
<P><B>hall with the washer cleaning the sink.  My husband, had the only roll
</B>
<P><B>of paper towels that we had left with him.  I asked him if he had </B>
<P><B>anymore, he said yes that they were on the dresser.  I went to get
them </B>
<P><B>and I couldn't find them, we looked in the bedroom, front room, and
</B>
<P><B>kitchen.  He was getting all frustrated, because he couldn't find them.
</B>
<P><B> After a while we gave up and went to bed.  In the morning when we
got </B>
<P><B>up, my son was already up and he was eating a pop tart wraped in a
paper </B>
<P><B>towel.  My husband asked him where he got the towel from and he said
</B>
<P><B>they are laying by the phone.  And sure enough, there they were in
plain </B>
<P><B>sight.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>One last thing, ever since we moved into the apartment, there was a
bad </B>
<P><B>smell.  It was like rotten eggs or sulfur, it wasn't there all the
time, </B>
<P><B>it would just come and go.  If it is connected to the hauntings, who
</B>
<P><B>knows.  Well, thanks for listening, it wasn't scary, just kind of
weird.</B>
