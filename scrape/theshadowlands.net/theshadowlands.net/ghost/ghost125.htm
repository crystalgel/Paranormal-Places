<font size=+2>My Friend Raina</font>
<p>By: pentacle_69@hotmail.com
<p>When I was a senior in High-School, I had a friend named Raina that
died of
<br>arythmia in her sleep one night. She was a year younger than me. The
week
<br>before she died, her and I sort of got in a little argument, and I
was kind
<br>of snotty to her a little bit, and never really got a chance to say
I was
<br>sorry. Well anyway, after she died, her family decided that they wanted
to
<br>have private family services and that they didn't want alot of people
to
<br>attend. And I had just started to be really close friends with her
those
<br>last few months, so her family didn't really know I was friends with
her,
<br>and so I didn't get to go to her funeral, and also never had a chance
to say
<br>good-bye to her.
<br>Well, a couple days later, I was completely overcome with grief, and
with
<br>the bathroom door halfway open, just completely broke down and cried,
as I
<br>looked up towards heaven, and proceeded to tell her how sorry I was,
and how
<br>much I wanted to be there at her funeral, and&nbsp; how much I had
wanted a
<br>chance to tell her good-bye. Well, halfway through this breaking down
<br>process, I saw her ghost standing in the doorway. I jumped back and
almost
<br>screamed. I turned to her slowly and asked " Raina, what are you doing
here?
<br>", and all she said to me
<br>" It's okay, don't cry ", and then she disappeared into thin air, and
I
<br>haven't seen her since.

<p><font size=+2>Michigan Hauntings</font>
<p>By: esther@ncats.net
<p>When I was almost 6 yrs. old, my family and I moved from Texas to Michigan.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We rented a house only to find later that it
<br>was not a normal house.Being so young (we moved two years later), I
do not remember much except the extreme terror I felt at
<br>night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My best friend and I would put things down
in one spot only to return later to find them moved.
<br>My mother experienced most of the frightening experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One night she awoke to find the house so hot she could hardly
<br>breathe.&nbsp; She went out of her room to check the thermostat and
immediately felt an evil presence.&nbsp; She looked at the
<br>thermometer and it was as high as the heat would go, although she had
only turned it to 60 degrees.
<br>She called my dad out and as soon as he stepped out of the room, the
hairs on the back of his neck stood straight out.
<br>He said he had never been so scared. Another night my mom was doing
dishes after everyone was asleep.
<br>She felt a tugging on her skirt and thought one of us kids had gotten
up to get her.&nbsp; But when she turned around there was
<br>&nbsp;nothing but that feeling of evil. I just recently found out that
our next door neighbors at that time also have a haunted
<br>house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their ghost however, has never tried to harm
them, and they have even gone so far as to name him "George".
<br>My grandfather has had several experiences as well.
<br>Thank you for letting me tell my story!

<br><font size=+2>Japanese Hauntings/Yokohama City Nishi-ward (Tobe-Cho)</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>BY: FSamNomi@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In 1992, I visited my aunt and uncle's home in Yokohama city. They live
in a
<br>small area called Tobe-cho in the Nishi (West) ward of the city. Although
<br>Yokohama is not a place that you would equate with "hauntings" it does
have
<br>it's fair share of sightings and paranormal activity. I first heard
of
<br>Yokohama's haunted past when I rented my first apartment. I was told
that
<br>some areas are cheaper than others due to "strange" circumstances of
the
<br>prior occupants. I soon learned that this meant that someone had either
died
<br>in the apt.,committed suicide, or the place was genuinely haunted by
spirits.
<p>The first area of interest is located near Nishitobe-Cho, about a 10
minute
<br>walk from the Tobe-train station. The area is infamous as it is where
the
<br>Tokugawa Shogunate carried out their public executions, hence the name
<br>"Kubi-Kirizaka"&nbsp; (the place of beheading) local residents will
not walk in
<br>the area at night an will avoid going through the small alley ways
which pass
<br>the area. Stories of a woman in white walking late into the night are
told by
<br>long time residents of the area and a Japanese TV crew even reported
<br>"filming" an unexplained object on their video tape. Footsteps and
weeping
<br>can be heard late into the night with no explaination. The strangest
thing is
<br>that human neck bones come to the surface from time to time. The original
<br>well used to clean the swords used for execution are still there and
water
<br>can be drawn from this spring. The well water is said to turn blood
red. The
<br>area is not officially recognized as a place of national importance,
but
<br>contractors and builders refuse to build anything on this land. The
home that
<br>sits adjacent to the property has never had a person living in the
home for
<br>more than a year. Kaoru Sugiyama (a business owner in the area) said
that the
<br>house is noted for its' hauntings, leaving in its wake several people
who
<br>have committed suicide by hanging themselves in the house.
<p>Sugiyama also said that the reason people hear weeping and footsteps
is becaus
<br>e of the ancient tradition of the death procession. The accused are
lead to
<br>the place of execution and asked if they would like to "relieve" themselves
<br>behind the stone wall (This wall seperates the house mentioned earlier)
the
<br>criminals are then given a final farewell with their families that
are
<br>waiting for them on the other side of the wall.
<p>Added to all this is the fact that Tobe-cho was severly bombed during
the
<br>Second World War. Hundreds perished by fire near Goshoyama-Cho (small
hill
<br>near Tobe) a stone stairwell now leads people from Tobe to Goshoyama
via this
<br>area where the bombing took place. The stairwell and the land under
the pass
<br>connecting Goshoyama and Tobe is said to be haunted by the spirits
of the
<br>dead killed by fire. Reports of Children dressed in kimono of the period
are
<br>said to materialize then disappear, as if playing then vanishing into
air.
<br>Soldiers voices and the sound of someone bellowing orders can be heard
from
<br>time to time in this area, and like the Nishitobe area is avoided at
night.
<p>Lastly, the tomb of a famous general of the Taira Clan is a "national
<br>monument" in Goshoyama. It sits wedged between my aunts' house and
a
<br>neighbor's. As people pass by the tombstone, they reverently bow and
pay
<br>their respects. The residents claim that the warrior wanders the streets&nbsp;
and
<br>oldr residents say that he was seen during the Tobe bombings.
<p>These stories are among a few that I have heard about through relatives
and
<br>residents of Japan..... The girl on the train and the Apt. house ghost
story
<br>is also interesting....if your interested I will complete those as
well.
<br>Please let me know and I will post them for you again via e-mail. Thanks
for
<br>listening.

<p><font size=+2>My Ghost Story</font>
<p>By: athrower@vs-gencorp.com
<p>I've never recounted this story to anyone who believed the way I and
the
<br>people actually involved do. It disturbs me to this day. I've always
<br>"sensed" things in my environment, and, between you &amp; me, can communicate
<br>somewhat.I've been touched by spirits on numerous occasions. They aren't
all
<br>the same. When you encounter the "BAD ONES"...well, you KNOW it. On
with my
<br>story...
<br>We'd found a house in a remote area of southeastern Connecticut. A
town
<br>called Versailles. No mail was delivered there, we had to have a p.o.
box at
<br>the local p.o. It was gorgeous, too. Bigger than our one bedroom apartment.
<br>We needed the space since we'd had our first child and she was a year
old
<br>and getting around. The new house accomodated three adults (my mom
included)
<br>and our daghter.
<br>I stayed in the house by myself the first night and picked up a certain
<br>strange feeling being there. It didn't scare me, but I immediately
was
<br>engulfed in a thickly sweet perfume like summer lilacs or honeysuckle.
Being
<br>familiar with the supernatural, I recognized that I was in a closed
up house
<br>and it was October. I welcomed whoever it was as a friendly presence
because
<br>I was feeling accepted.
<br>A few months later, my boyfriend of 7 years and I broke up and he left
the
<br>house. That's when "things" began to occur. I awoke the first night
alone to
<br>see a full apparition of a cloaked figure standing looking out the
window of
<br>the adjoining room. I knew it was a woman by her slight build and a
feeling
<br>I got just looking at her. She just stood there, no movement at all,
and
<br>gazed out toward the road, as if she were waiting for something or
someone.
<br>Scared the pee outta me!! But I just went back to sleep.
<br>A couple weeks later, my best friend and her two young boys moved in.
My mom
<br>still lived in the house in one of the two back rooms. We kept these
rooms
<br>closed off from the rest of the house because they were always frigidly
<br>cold. Brenda moved her things into the other room.
<br>As the winter succumbed to summer, more activity began in the house.
Objects
<br>were moved and stacked into shapes. Doorknobs would rattle and doors
would
<br>open. Toys would be sent rolling across floors. All after dark. We
began to
<br>experience two kinds of smells in the house. The main areas we lived
in
<br>would occasionally smell of perfume. Sweet, yummy... The second odor
always
<br>came from the two back rooms. Sewer-like, garbage... We'd gag. Brenda
began
<br>sleeping in my room with me.
<br>We were doing a tarot card spread one night and were told by the card
that
<br>we had "manifested" something. We both looked at each other and our
first
<br>thoughts centered on the kids. We bolted up and threw open the door
to the
<br>kids room and my daughter was levitating, just hanging from the center
of
<br>the room totally asleep. I froze and watched her little body dropped
to the
<br>floor as Brenda shoved me back and charged into the room. Megan, my
<br>daughter, began to cry. Vinny, Brenda's oldest began to scream "Why
does she
<br>talk without moving her mouth?" he said over and over. "Who?" Brenda
asked.
<br>"The lady with the white hair?" We found out later that the Lady with
the
<br>White Hair came to him often and talked to him, but he wasn't afraid
of her.
<p>My first encounter with the "Bad One" was in the back rooms. I'd gone
in to
<br>get something for Brenda since the smell of garbage was too strong
to sleep
<br>back there and from directly behind my ear came the unmistakeable sound
of
<br>hissing. It was so close it made my hair move and the skin of my neck
crawl.
<br>We decided to contact someone for help.
<br>We were instructed on how to perform a purification/excorcism of the
house
<br>using sea salt and visualization. We did this rite all night, over
and over,
<br>until we were exhausted. We protected ourselves by using Carnation
oil on
<br>our foreheads and putting onyx around where we slept. Laugh if you
will, but
<br>it actually worked.
<br>The next day we were contacted by a perfect stranger claiming to be
a
<br>psychic. She told us she'd been visited by our white haired lady who
told
<br>her she'd only meant to help us with the children (since we were young
and
<br>inexperienced and full of impatience). Her name was Sarah and she'd
died in
<br>a fire on the very foundation of the house where we lived. As a matter
of
<br>fact, the rebuilt house shared the very same rock foundation.
<br>She had no information on the "Bad One". But we had no more problems
from
<br>that one and moved out shortly thereafter.
<br>Since then, I'm always aware of beings not of my immediate environment.
I
<br>know when they're there, which is a great deal of the time. I know
they are
<br>drawn to certain people and vice-versa. I disagree with the idea that
they
<br>are stuck behind in most cases. I know they do things deliberately.
<br>I felt both good and evil forces at work in that house and was terrified.
<br>I'm a little wiser for the experience, though, and am thankful for
what I
<br>learned.

<p><font size=+2>TRUCK OR GHOST??</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: SILERIOA@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When I was fifteen I went on a hunting trip with my father and cousin
in
<br>Durango, Mexico.&nbsp; We arrived on a Friday around one or two in
the morning.
<br>After unloading my cousin and I couldn't sleep because we had slept
most of
<br>the way so we decided to jump in the truck and go hunting for a while.&nbsp;
The
<br>town we were in is very small.&nbsp; I estimate the population in being
less than
<br>100 people.&nbsp; We hit the road that let us to the mountains.&nbsp;
We drove up the
<br>steep hill lighting the sides with lanterns looking for the shiny eyes
as a
<br>hunter does when hunting at night.&nbsp; On top of the hill there is
an old cave
<br>called "LA CUEVA PINTA" which means "THE PAINTED CAVE."&nbsp; This
cave contains
<br>some old indian paintings on its wall.&nbsp; We passed the cave and
drove about
<br>another mile or so then we headed back.&nbsp; Once we got to the cave
on our way
<br>back, my cousin stopped and pointed me toward a light shining on the
road.
<br>Since we were on top of the hill, the road lead down in an "L" pattern.&nbsp;
We
<br>stared at the light for a couple of minutes and then it started to
move.&nbsp; It
<br>looked like a truck making its way down the road.&nbsp; We thought
to ourselves
<br>that the only truck out this late at night has to be the police and
since we
<br>were hunting with no permit, we decided to hide the rifles on the side
of the
<br>road.&nbsp; We quickly gathered all the bullets and our rifles and
hid them by an
<br>old bob-wired fence.&nbsp; I paused and took a quick glance at the
light and it
<br>was still moving but very slowly.&nbsp; We got back in the truck and
we were both
<br>breathing hard because of the nervousness.&nbsp; We came down the road.&nbsp;
The light
<br>was still visible and it seemed to have gotten brighter as we got closer.&nbsp;
We
<br>came upon the curve of the road and the reflection of the light was
<br>noticeable on the trees.&nbsp; We turned and my cousin quickly slammed
the brakes.
<br>&nbsp;There was nothing there.&nbsp; No truck, no lights no nothing.&nbsp;
My cousin then
<br>flashed the high beams to see if we can catch a reflection of a brake
light
<br>or something but there was nothing.&nbsp; We sat there in the truck
amazed.&nbsp; We
<br>then came to think that maybe the truck pulled over and is hiding behind
some
<br>bushes so we continued down the road.&nbsp; Branches from the mesquite
trees were
<br>scraping the sides of the truck as we made our way through the rough
area.
<br>It was about a half a mile drive to town and we made it all the way
without
<br>seeing any truck.&nbsp; We arrived at my grandfather's house and told
my father
<br>about our experiance.&nbsp; He gave us his video camera and told us
to record the
<br>light.&nbsp; Up again the road we came and again we saw the light.&nbsp;
My cousin
<br>parked the truck so we can collect the rifles we had hidden by the
fence.
<br>This time the light stood in one place and it seemed to get brighter
at times
<br>and then it would go dim.&nbsp; We got the camera and started recording.&nbsp;
The
<br>light continued to change sizes getting very bright to very dim.&nbsp;
At its
<br>brightest moment, I would say the light appeared to be the size of
a
<br>basketball.&nbsp; We recorded for a good while and we sat there and
exchanged
<br>thoughts of what it was we were seeing.&nbsp; We arrived at my grandfather's
house
<br>and hooked up the VCR.&nbsp; My father was already asleep so we prepared
the tape
<br>to see it in the morning.&nbsp; In the morning we viewed the tape,
my father was
<br>amazed.&nbsp; He said when he was a kid he used to see a light similar
to this one
<br>we had recorded but the one he saw was more like a fireball moving
about the
<br>mountains!&nbsp; We haved showed to the tape to many people in this
town and
<br>everybody says the have seen lights similar to the one we captured,
but not
<br>this large.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>P.S. I have many other true stories about happeinings in Mexico as well
as
<br>here in my hometown Houston that I will send to you on a later date.&nbsp;
If you
<br>would, reply to this message and let me know what you think.

<br><font size=+2>Life of Experiences</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: sea_of_rainbows@hotmail.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp; All my life I have had experiences (along with my entire family)
<br>concerning apperitions and hauntings. This has gone on in my family
for
<br>generations.
<br>&nbsp; For example, my grandmother had a child on new years, in those
days they
<br>did not have pennicillin to cure pnemonia so my uncle became very ill.
<br>&nbsp; For two weeks my grandmother kept seeing a white misty cloud
but said that
<br>she could not look into it. Two weeks prior to my uncles death, she
had
<br>heard and seen a white dog howl under the window where Lyle (my uncle)
<br>slept. She also heard an owl hooting, which is rare where she lived.
<br>Well, the night that Lyle died (right before he died) she looked into
the
<br>mist, and what she saw was Lyles face, immediately after&nbsp;&nbsp;
looking into the
<br>mist and seeing his face, he died.
<br>&nbsp; Also right after he died, my older uncle awoke my grandmother
and said
<br>everything down stairs in the basement cellar was flying all over the
place,
<br>it soulnded as if glass was breaking and the whole basement was in
havoc.
<br>Upon going downstairs my grandmother said nothing was out of place.
<br>&nbsp; These incidences are not abnormnal and have happened to every
member of my
<br>family.
<br>&nbsp; In the home in which I now reside, approxamitely two weeks ago
I went to
<br>lay down to sleep. My eyes were wide open when I saw the apperance
of a
<br>white mist above my face. I kept looking til the mist opened up (mind
you,
<br>my eyes were open and I was totally alert) and I saw a man smiling
at me. He
<br>was a handsome man and looked as if he were either native american
or
<br>african american, or a mixture of both.
<br>All I did was become somewhat startled, but I was not frightened as
these
<br>types of things have happened to me and members of my family all of
our
<br>lives.
<br>&nbsp; Anyway, all I did was ask,&nbsp; "who are you?" and as soon
as I said this, he
<br>left.
<br>&nbsp; In the home I now reside in with my husband and three children,
we have
<br>all seen and heard a person walking, slamming doors, and sometimes
a white
<br>mist appears in the hallway.
<br>&nbsp; We heard that a man had died in this home, but I have no proof
of this.
<br>&nbsp; On New Years eve, at exactly 12:00am, our firealarm went off
(there are no
<br>batteries in it!) and the hot water faucet went on full blast. There
was no
<br>one in the kitchen at the time.
<br>&nbsp; My Mother passed on two years ago and we often talked about
these kinds of
<br>things. Whoever these people are, they follow our family.
<br>&nbsp; When my mother passed on, I saw her spirit leave her body. I
know that
<br>people will probably think I am off the wall or what ever, but I have
seen
<br>things as well as my extended family all our lives.
<br>&nbsp; To go on with this story, after my mother's death, I kept sending
my
<br>children into the bathroom to turn off my hairblower that kept turning
on by
<br>itself..
<br>&nbsp; I would also feel someone poke me on the shoulder, what my mother
ALWAYS
<br>did to get my attention or to give me a love tap.
<br>&nbsp; I know that if anyone were to investigate my home they would
get plenty of
<br>readings. I am not sure what you do to research everything (I have
not yet
<br>gotten to that part in your web site) but I do know that these so called
<br>ghosts or "apperitions" have followed my entire family and extended
family
<br>all our lives.
<br>&nbsp; There is SO much more and so many more stories that I could
tell you but
<br>that could take all night. So for now I will submit these couple of
things
<br>to you and ask you just what is this mist with this man's face that
I saw
<br>hovering over me??? It wasn't frightening, just kind of startled me
as I was
<br>not expecting this.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time to read this and I would
like to tell you
<br>that so far I have enjoyed your site immensley.
<br>&nbsp; I have many stories to tell you, but I will wait to see if I
recieve a
<br>response back.

<br><font size=+2>The Watcher</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: myq13@hotmail.com
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp; This is just one of several stories I have to contribute.&nbsp;
I have a
<br>"watcher" ghost that I've been seeing as far back as I can remember.&nbsp;
As far
<br>as I know it's male, and he watches me either as a protector, or just
for
<br>fun, I'm not sure.
<br>&nbsp; My first experience I don't even remember, but my mom told me
about when I
<br>was little (like 3-4) she'd hear me talking after I went to bed, she
came in
<br>the room thinking I was awake, she found me lying in bed, talking in
my
<br>sleep, saying "I only see the shadows when they're creeping around
me."
<br>&nbsp; The first time I remember seeing him was a few years later when
I was
<br>about 6 or 7, I was in the woods with some friends, and I saw this
pitch
<br>black man run across the trail about a hundred yards away from me,
now this
<br>was in the middle of the day, on a well lit trail with no trees around.
<br>&nbsp; The next sighting I had was when I was about 10, after we had
moved
<br>sleeping over a friends house.&nbsp; We were in the den watching T.V.
and I got
<br>up to get a book from his room,&nbsp; I went through the house not
bothering to
<br>turn on lights as I went, cuz I knew the way.&nbsp; When I get to the
living
<br>room, I saw the black man again.&nbsp; He was standing half in a shadow,
about 3
<br>feet away from me, and looking out watching me,&nbsp; the really freaky
part was
<br>that when I looked into his face, it looked like he was made of shadow,
<br>completely 2 dimensional, and his eyes were cut outs (I saw the rest
of the
<br>room behind him).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From then on I saw him all the time.&nbsp; Wherever I
was my house, a friends
<br>house, driving, at night, or during the day, I'd see him watching me,
as
<br>soon as he saw that I saw him, he'd hide disappear, or hide behind
<br>something.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 2 occasions when someone else saw him, the first
was my
<br>girlfriend.&nbsp; She was staying over one night, this was in my parents
house,
<br>before we were married, so we slept in separate rooms, she had my bed,
and I
<br>got the couch.&nbsp; Well the next morning she told me that she woke
up in the
<br>middle of the night, and felt as if she was being watched, she opened
her
<br>eyes and saw him standing over her, she felt very threatened, like
he was
<br>extremely angry at her.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other time someone else him was a few days after that,
I was lying on
<br>my bed, home alone, with my pet rat.&nbsp; I had her out of the cage,
and ket her
<br>run around while I was relaxing.&nbsp; Suddenly the rat got very scared,
and ran
<br>over to me and hid, all the time squeaking, and clicking her teeth
<br>nervously, this was very odd behavior for her.&nbsp; At that point
I decided to
<br>get some answers, I had been studying the supernatural for some time,
and
<br>decided to try and communicate with him.&nbsp; I put myself into a
trance and
<br>asked him to identify himself.&nbsp; He said he couldn't, but told
me he meant no
<br>harm, and that he is here to watch me.&nbsp; He couldn't explain any
more.&nbsp; He
<br>apologized for scaring the rat and my girlfriend, he then explained
why he
<br>was so angry at her, according to him, that was my bed, and I should've
been
<br>there.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if I'm alone or not, but no one should
use it
<br>without me.&nbsp; I told him it was ok with me for her to be there,
and that he
<br>was free to watch me as long as he wanted, but not interfere with my
life,
<br>or the lives of those around me, at the point he said that was ok with
him.
<br>&nbsp; I still see him all the time, and whenever i do I feel safe
in that
<br>whatever happens to me, it won't go unnoticed, and if necessary, I'm
sure
<br>he'd do what he could to help.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I am a civil war reenactor and my unit and I were down to Gettysburg
for the
<br>Rememberance Day parade. It was the Friday that sarted the weekend,and
we
<br>decided to walk through devils den and the Traingular Feild. We all
sat down
<br>and started telling ghost stories. I got up to tell my one expreience,
and
<br>then my grandfather got up to tell his, and so on. As I finished I
silnlently
<br>refelceted on the beautiful place I was in. As my pap pap started telling
his
<br>story I heard drums in the woods to my left. Then I smelled a strong
odor of
<br>sulfer {gunpowder}. I looked to my right at my grandmother and said"
Do you
<br>smell that?" I was very familiar with the smell, and I have heared
of
<br>smelling it before on the ghost tours I have been on. I figured I am
just
<br>going to let it go. Then these people {tourists} came up to us said
" Their
<br>isn't any reenactments going on tonight right, because we heard drums."
I
<br>told them that we had heard it too, and all of my freinds said that
they
<br>heard the drums and smelled the sulfer. The also mentioned that all
the cars
<br>by the woods would go on the road, pause for a mintue, and continue.
I am
<br>very sensitive to paranormalactivity and I think this was just more
ghosts
<br>trying to tell us of their horrible experince.

<br><font size=+2>The Bedroom Set</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: RGLASS@eecnet.com
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>i have had a few run-ins with the supernatural throughout my life, but
the
<br>most recent occurance was in the fall of 1996. i decided that i wanted
to
<br>buy a bedroom set with a vanity. i picked up a newspaper that i had
never
<br>read before (nor have i read since) but i had a "feeling" that i would
find
<br>my set advertised in there. i called about the set and talked to an
older
<br>woman (mrs. t.) who was selling off the estate of her sister and
<br>brother-in-law who had passed on in the last few years. mrs.t. said
i could
<br>come over to see it. as weird as it sounds, she "interviewed" me before
i
<br>was allowed upstairs to look at it. mrs t. told me she had turned away
<br>others because she did not think they would take good care of the bedroom
<br>set or just plain because she did not like them. fortunately she took
a
<br>liking to me and i had "permission" to buy the set. i fell in love
with it
<br>and got all seven antique pieces for a steal! immediately upon taking
it
<br>home and polishing it up, strange things started to happen. i would
wake up
<br>every morning with my quilt folded very neatly at the end of the bed.
for
<br>some reason i assumed it was my mother's doings so i never mentioned
it.
<br>this happened every night for about a month. then one night i woke
up and
<br>bending over me, looking directly into my face, was a woman with long
white
<br>curly hair. i yelped and shot up out of bed. i looked back towards
the
<br>headboard but there was no one there. i convinced myself i had been
dreaming
<br>and went back to bed. a few nights later i mentioned the occurances
to my
<br>mother. she said she was not folding my quilt but she was going to
call mrs.
<br>t. to ask her about it. as it turns out, the original owner of the
set mrs.
<br>t.'s younger sister, whom we shall call victoria. victoria came from
a
<br>prominant italian family in the boston area. all of the children had
dark
<br>hair and eyes, except victoria, who had platinum WHITE hair her entire
life.
<br>her brothers and sisters used to tease her as a child saying she was
the
<br>milkman's daughter! she married and had always dreamed of having a
duaghter,
<br>but the couple never had any children. she was very proud of her beautiful
<br>bedroom set, but even more proud of the handmade quilt she kept FOLDED
AT
<br>THE END OF HER BED!&nbsp; mrs. t. discussed what had happened with
her family and
<br>they all decided that i was the "daughter" victoria had never had and
fate
<br>had directed mrs. t. to let me buy the set. they felt that victoria
was
<br>folding my quilt just like she had folded her own for so many years.
they
<br>also felt that she had been bending over me to give me a kiss when
i woke up
<br>and I scared HER! the night i found this out i went home and sat down
on my
<br>bed. i spoke to victoria and told her i would take very good care of
her
<br>beloved bedroom set, but i did not want her "hanging out" in my room
anymore
<br>because she had scared me. all was quiet for about a week until one
night
<br>when i noticed my cat looking at the spot where victoria had appeared
and he
<br>was purring. then he stretched out his paw to that spot as if reaching
out
<br>to her. i yelled at him, telling him he was not allowed to "be nice"
to her
<br>because she wasn't supposed to be there! he blinked slowly a few times
at
<br>the spot, then jumped off the bed and left the room. that was the last
i
<br>heard from victoria.

<br><font size=+2>&nbsp;Family History</font>
<p>By: spiritwulf75@yahoo.com
<p>It seems that my family has had a sort of "history" of experiencing
strange things.&nbsp; It all seems
<br>so normal to us, that I guess we just blow certain things off as imagination.&nbsp;
It's when instances
<br>happen so closely together that we begin to think.&nbsp; I have story
that is the perfect example of
<br>this.
<br>My grandfather had died just last month.&nbsp; January 17 to be exact.&nbsp;
But this story takes place on
<br>the 15th.&nbsp; I was at my cousin Dee's house.&nbsp; It was me, her,
her husband, another cousin and her
<br>boyfriend, and a few friends.&nbsp; At about 10:30 p.m., Dee's mom,
Carol (I'm almost the spitting
<br>image of her), had called to ask if Dee had been to her house that
day.&nbsp; My cousin said no, and
<br>asked why.&nbsp; This is what my aunt had told her.
<br>Carol had left earlier that afternoon with her boyfriend to go to lunch.&nbsp;
Well, knowing that she
<br>wasn't going to be back until that evening, she said aloud that she
wished she had left her porch
<br>light on.&nbsp; When she got home, BOTH porch lights were on.&nbsp;
She thought it was funny, but didn't
<br>think too much of it, until she went into the house.&nbsp; Every rug
had been turned upside-down.&nbsp; The
<br>larger area rug in her living room had even been rolled up in front
of her house.&nbsp; Now, my aunt is
<br>a serious stickler for everything in its place, so this freaked her
out quite a bit.&nbsp; But, what
<br>made matters even more bizarre were her curtains she had just hung
up that morning.&nbsp; She keeps
<br>them at a height of one inch from the ground.&nbsp; Both curtains were
not only touching the floor, but
<br>one had been turned around.&nbsp; Understandably, my aunt was terrified.&nbsp;
She thought someone was in
<br>her house.&nbsp; So, she locked herself in her garage.
<br>She usually keeps a couple trash containers out there, one for dog
food and the other for yard
<br>waste.&nbsp; Her dog was out in the garage as well.&nbsp; Now, her
dog is almost as old as the hills, and
<br>his hips are going bad.&nbsp; Besides, the only container he would
ever touch is the one with the food
<br>in it.&nbsp; Well, as the situation would have it, the yard waste container
had been knocked over and
<br>the weeds and twigs spread all over the garage floor.&nbsp; She immediately
called her son-in-law, who
<br>lives just a couple houses away.&nbsp; (Yes, she had a phone in the
garage as well.&nbsp; Luckily.)&nbsp; He,
<br>along with a neighbor, had come over and searched the house thoroughly.&nbsp;
No one could be found.
<br>No one living, anyway.&nbsp; She absolutely refused to sleep that night
until another, more skeptical,
<br>aunt came over.&nbsp; Not much else happened that night.
<br>Or so it would seem.&nbsp; Apparently, when she had called her son-in-law,
my aunt was talking to her
<br>other daughter, Carolyn, until he came over.&nbsp; Carolyn had claimed
that their conversation was
<br>being monitored by someone on an extension in the house.&nbsp; (There
are three phones in the house:
<br>one in the master bedroom, one in the kitchen, and one in the garage.)&nbsp;
When Carolyn had made
<br>mention of someone else being on the phone, there was an audible click
as the extension was hung
<br>up.&nbsp; This made matters worse for my aunt, because she was still
alone in the house.
<br>This wasn't the beginning, though.&nbsp; It actually started earlier
that morning.&nbsp; My aunt's former
<br>mother-in-law, Ruby, had called.&nbsp; She asked Carol if she had called
her the previous night, the
<br>14th.&nbsp; My aunt said no, and asked why.&nbsp; Well, Ruby's Caller
ID showed that a call was made to her
<br>from my aunt's house at exactly 12 midnight.&nbsp; But my aunt was
asleep at the time, and she lives
<br>alone.&nbsp; So, who made the call?
<br>Well, this is getting to be long-winded, so I'm going to stop it here.&nbsp;
There's more to this
<br>story, so I'll just send it in another post.&nbsp; Thanks so much for
reading.&nbsp; If anyone has any
<br>questions or advice, please feel free to e-mail me.
<p>As promised, here's the rest of the story.&nbsp; As I said in the beginning,
my grandfather had died
<br>last month.&nbsp; We had finally figured that all of the activity that
was going on was because of him.
<br>So, on Sunday, Jan. 16th, my cousin Dee and I decided to buy an Ouija
board.&nbsp; I had used them
<br>before, so I knew what to do.&nbsp; We had contacted our great-uncle
Kenny.&nbsp; He was our grandpa's
<br>brother, but I'm not sure if he was younger or older.&nbsp; I believe
he was younger, though.&nbsp; Anyway,
<br>he had been dead for quite some time, early 80's.&nbsp; He said he
was the prankster who was behind the
<br>hijinks at my aunt's house.&nbsp; He had been trying to get her attention.&nbsp;
Boy, did he get it!!
<br>Anyway, he wanted to let us know that grandpa would be leaving us soon,
and that he had come to
<br>take him home.&nbsp; We asked him when, and he said that there will
a party for grandpa on Thursday.
<br>So, naturally, we assumed we had until Thursday to be with grandpa.&nbsp;
But this was not to be.&nbsp; We
<br>thanked Uncle Kenny for the message and said our goodbyes.
<br>The next day, all of us kids had gone over to my grandparents' house.&nbsp;
At first, my fiance didn't
<br>want me to go since I was there the day before.&nbsp; But I told him
that I had this feeling that I
<br>should be there, so I went.&nbsp; There were kids and grandkids coming
and going from the house all
<br>day. It was like we all knew.&nbsp; At about 5:00 that evening, grandpa
took a turn for the worse.&nbsp; (He
<br>had cancer, and his kidneys had failed at this time.)&nbsp; He asked
my grandma where everyone was, so
<br>she had me call his last two living sisters, one older and the other
was the baby.&nbsp; They got to
<br>the house at about 5:45.&nbsp; They immediately went in to see him.&nbsp;
I had called my sister over too.
<br>Her boyfriend had been an EMT and was a big help to grandma when taking
care of grandpa.&nbsp; They had
<br>just walked in the house, when he went in to check my grandpa's vitals.&nbsp;
Right at the moment that
<br>Mike (the EMT) called for my grandma, everyone knew.&nbsp; It was exactly
6:00 p.m. on January 17, that
<br>my grandpa passed away.
<br>Now, I know I had said that Uncle Kenny said it would be Thursday,
but oddly enough, technically
<br>it was Thursday when he left us.&nbsp; That Thursday, January 20, was
our dear grandpa's wake.&nbsp; It was
<br>a rather large to-do, as grandpa would put it, as far as the people
who came.&nbsp; People who I
<br>haven't seen in years were there, and then some.
<br>But this doesn't necessarily end the story.&nbsp; This will go on.&nbsp;
I was very close to my grandpa, and
<br>hope to continue to be, even though he's passed on.&nbsp; I've talked
to him through the Ouija, and
<br>know he's okay.&nbsp; One last thing to add before I go.&nbsp; My aunt,
Carol, had woke up one night not too
<br>long ago.&nbsp; She looked over by her bedroom door, where this eerie
light was coming from.&nbsp; She says
<br>she saw both my grandpa and uncle Kenny standing there, smiling at
her.&nbsp; She told them good night,
<br>and they were gone.&nbsp; So, I'm assuming grandpa did make it to heaven.&nbsp;
(He had been concerned with
<br>where his brother was coming from to take him back.&nbsp; If it was
hell, he wasn't going.)
<br>Well, so far, this is the end of my story.&nbsp; That is, until the
next strange thing happens.&nbsp; I'll
<br>keep you posted on any interesting new developments.&nbsp; Thanks.

<br><font size=+2>Evil Spirits</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: kmoore4656@prodigy.net
<p>Hello,&nbsp; I just read the section you have on whether a haunting
is caused
<br>by a earth bound human spirit or something evil.&nbsp; Yes, I believe
that
<br>the evil ones are much more rare, but I can attest to the fact that
if a
<br>spirit is evil you will have no doubt about it's intentions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was first married about 8 years ago many
things began to
<br>happen in my home.&nbsp; My husband had been heavily involved in the
game
<br>Dungeons and Dragons, very heavily involved.&nbsp; He had also delved
into
<br>satanism and witchcraft. The music and books that he enjoyed of course
<br>leaned in these directions.&nbsp; He had denounced all of these things
before
<br>moving into my home and I figured that they were just a teenage phase.
<br>I was wrong.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some time he had actually began to call
on a specific demon that
<br>he believed in.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; When he moved in my then 2 year old began to have an imaginary
<br>friend, a normal childhood thing, right?&nbsp; She called him chewy,
after
<br>the Star Wars character,&nbsp; She would talk to him as if he was actually
<br>responding&nbsp; Soon she became afraid of him and started hiding in
strange
<br>places.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give you a short list of the things that
happened over the
<br>next four years.
<p>There were horrible smells, sulfur, decay, feces
<br>There were objects in mirrors, halls, etc. that could never be looked
at
<br>directly
<br>Things were broken
<br>Friends would not even come in the door
<br>My husband once experienced a "creature" on his chest with a smothering,
<br>unable to respond feeling.&nbsp; At the same time he felt as if something
was
<br>after my daughter.&nbsp; She soon woke with nightmare of a lion trying
to get
<br>to her.
<br>I once woke to a voice and a black on black image in the door to my
room
<br>that I felt was threatening my new born son.
<br>Soon after my son was born a large spot of mildew began to spread over
<br>his bed, we moved the bed and the spot spread over that spot too. There
<br>were no leaks and attempts to clean it or stop it were useless.&nbsp;
We
<br>sprayed Kilz on it to no avail.
<br>I also began to have horrible feelings of not just being watched, but
<br>stalked, nightmares of violent rape. and murder
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know all of this could have come out of some movie,
but it
<br>didn't.&nbsp; Please let me know if you've heard any similar stories.&nbsp;
There
<br>is a lot more to this one but I won't take all of your time.

<br><font size=+2>Strange happenings</font>
<p>By:&nbsp; Bowlin1der@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I really don't know where to begin but I'm certainly glad that i found
your
<br>website and know now i'm not crazy or alone.My first experience with
what i
<br>think are ghosts is the house we are currently living in in Tempe,Arizona.
I
<br>have two other roommates and my boyfriend living in this house. Two
days
<br>after we moved in, the garage door that leads into the living room
flew
<br>opened and stopped at a specific point before the wall.I thought maybe
it
<br>was our roommate playing a joke on us&nbsp; because he is the only
one with
<br>access of opening that door.Nope not him, he's still at work. Then
we went
<br>to investigate and nothing in garage. I still can't explained that
door but
<br>if my boyfriend hadn't of seen the same thing people would not believe
us.
<p>The next experience in the same house happened a couple of months ago,
I was
<br>making dinner and heard my roommates bedroom door open and shut and
keys
<br>rattle like he was leaving, so i called to him that dinners ready if
your
<br>hungry.No answer so i thought maybe he didn't hear me, Twenty minutes
later
<br>my roommate came out of his room and i asked how did you get back so
soon
<br>and in your room so fast. He told me that he was sleeping for about
a few
<br>hours. I asked him did he hear me call his name and he said "No, I
was
<br>sleeping." I know that him &amp; I were the only two people in that
house or so
<br>I thought.
<p>My last instance is the broken fan in the bathroom. We never use it
because
<br>of the clanking sound it makes when turned on.My roommate asked one
day if i
<br>left the fan on in the bathroom and i said "no, i thought you said
not to
<br>use it." Four other times that day the fan would be on and not one
of us did
<br>it. I can't explain that one, except for it has to be a ghost in the
house.

<p><font size=+2>Black Figures in the Bedroom</font>
<p>By: indreams@danceart.net
<p>&nbsp;At the time I was 13. But here I go and I was wondering if you
could put this in your web page. Well this is how it started
<br>&nbsp;out.
<br>&nbsp;This all started happening when I moved my grandma's bedroom
set down we went up there and she gave me this beautiful
<br>bedroom set. well anyways she gave us alot of other stuff like really
old pictures and stuff like that. Well let me get to
<br>the pointe. before this all happened I had a dream that I was walking
down a hall way but it looked like I was in a mine or
<br>&nbsp;an undergroung mine (where they try and find gold) and I was
walking and there were these guys and they were digging and
<br>one turned around and smiled and me and i thought that I have seen
him before but then I kept walking down the hallway
<br>and one guy stood up and he told me not to go down there because it
was haunted. But of course I did not listen and I kept
<br>on going but when i was walking i could see this figure of white smoke
and then it started to get fuller and then it was a
<br>women in a white victorian dress but she had not feet and her hair
was pulled back and she had a pale face and she came
<br>towords me and she grabbed my arm but i was scared and I tryed to get
away. Then after that I woke up. never had the dream
<br>agian but it scared me and anyways time passed and my mom told me to
go get the pictures that my grandma gave me and i went
<br>&nbsp;and got them and when we were going through them picked up one
and looked at it and was freaked out and my mom ask me what
<br>&nbsp;was wrong and I told her that this was the same woman that was
in my dream. And it was this picture she was happy and it
<br>was an old picture and she had white frizzy hair and was pulled back.
And i was really scared. that is only the begining and
<br>&nbsp;then i was going through the rest and I picked up a picture of
these guys and i looked at it and the same guy that i saw in my dream
<br>that smiled at me was in there and all the other guys that were in
my dream was in there two. I was soooo freaked out. But
<br>them time passed and I got my bedroom set done and I got it set up
and that i when things started to happen. I was sick one
<br>time i mean really sick and i was sleeping and it was about 3:00 a.m.
and i woke up and I saw the same women in my dream
<br>standing there in my bathroom and she was just looking at me and I
was just laying there and she would never leave untill i
<br>fell asleep. well anyways the other time was when i was laying there
in my bed and i was tired that night am i have been
<br>crying and i woke up and i saw her agian and this time she was right
by my bedside and she smiled and i could feel something
<br>&nbsp;cold rubbing my arm and it was her hand and she did the same
thing she did go away untill i fell asleep. Anways I was
<br>getting use to her and when ever i saw her she did not scare me but
when i was talking to my mom one day she was saying to me that she
<br>has had some things happen to here she would have things dissapear
and she would have things move when her back was turned.
<br>And she also told me that when i am downstairs she can hear footsteps
in my bedroom. and after i had this talk with her the
<br>women was never there anymore but then i started seeing black figures
in my bedroom.
<br>oh yeah and i also found out that the guy that was smiling at me was
her brother. that is my story and I was wondrering if
<br>you could please write me back as soon as you read this letter and
know i am starting to see the black figure more and more.
<br>&nbsp;the other thing that i wanted to tell u was that i can always
tell when there is a ghost in the room. i get this high pitch
<br>&nbsp;nose in my ears and i think that there are three ghost living
in my house and i think there is a guy a women and a little
<br>girl. but if you could please write me back that would be great.

<p>Five years ago my wife and I purchased a 2 bedroom cottage in the foothills
of the Sierras.&nbsp; The day we closed on the
<br>mortgage I got busy cleaning to get ready to move.&nbsp; At about two
in the afternoon I was cleaning in the kitchen when I had
<br>to stop, climb down from the ladder and go to the dining room.&nbsp;
As I entered the room I was face to face with a young girl.
<br>&nbsp;She was transparent but her features were somewhat visible.&nbsp;
In a moment she was gone.
<br>That evening I told my wife the story and we both discounted it.&nbsp;
I decided that since our kids were grown maybe it was sort
<br>&nbsp;of "wishful thinking" on my part.&nbsp; Soon after we moved in
my wife saw an image in the kitchen. She described it as a "white
<br>blur" that raced from the dining room into the living room and then
through the front door.&nbsp; Note that the door was shut
<br>when the "blur" when by.&nbsp; Now it was my wife's turn to tell me
of her experience.&nbsp; She mentioned that she also saw a black
<br>spot in the kitchen at the same time she saw the white one.&nbsp; The
black area gave her a really bad feeling.&nbsp; For months
<br>nothing more transpired other than we noticed our cat keeping a close
eye on the built in hutch that is original to the house
<br>.&nbsp; Then one afternoon I was in the kitchen when our cockatiel
started going wild in her cage.&nbsp; Suddenly a dried flower
<br>arrangement that my wife had me anchor tightly on a shelf above the
bird fell to the floor.&nbsp; A moment later the lid on the
<br>kitchen trash can flipped open on its own.&nbsp; Now I know we live
in California but there were no tremors and with the money
<br>that flower arrangement cost-- I assure you I anchored it tightly to
the wall and it was sitting on a six inch deep shelf.
<br>&nbsp;I really had no fear, for some reason the whole event seemed
like a natural occurrence.&nbsp; I gotta tell you however, my eyes
<br>were wide open and my jaw dropped shut.
<br>A few days later I decided to go into the dining room where I first
"had the pleasure of its company" to ask a name.&nbsp; I did
<br>feel a bit odd as a grown man, a husband and father of two.&nbsp; I
just said "okay,so what is your name?"&nbsp; "Amy" was the reply.
<br>&nbsp;I was out of the house really quick and scared this time.&nbsp;
I walked back in and asked Amy what her situation is (or was).
<br>Amy, I believe is the child of owners of the home during the flu epidemic
of the late teens of the twentieth century.&nbsp; My
<br>&nbsp;wife often sees the image of a white blur wooshing through the
front door.&nbsp; My wife now believes it would be just like a
<br>kid to be running in and out the door.&nbsp; We got another cat two
years ago that loves to play next to the hutch.&nbsp; It occured
<br>to me that maybe that built-in hutch would make a wonderful place for
a small child to play.
<br>I finally bought a new computer and had it set up in the back of the
house.&nbsp; I plugged it in and it started typing on its
<br>own.&nbsp; Then it went into the CMOS settings.&nbsp; Norton antivirus
said the computer was fine.&nbsp; I then set the system up in another
<br>&nbsp;area with no problems.&nbsp; I had an expert look into some sort
of electical fields in the area the computer had been in but
<br>nothing was found.&nbsp; My son was out for a few weeks and he and
I were watching a ball game when the water turned itself on in
<br>&nbsp;the restroom 12 feet away.&nbsp; Nobody was in the house but
he and I and we both looked at each other mistified.&nbsp; I also
<br>enjoyed the visit from my devout baptist mother-in-law who stays up
'till all hours knitting and watching television.&nbsp; My
<br>mother-in-law had thought I was just, well "seeing things".&nbsp; To
this I agreed.&nbsp; As did my wife and our grown son.&nbsp; One
<br>morning I got up to find her still on the couch.&nbsp; She looked at
me with a serious eye and said "I saw her". I asked who
<br>she saw.&nbsp; She said "Amy stood over me and watched me knit and
then went through the front door".
<br>My wife and I are both happy, healthy and mature adults who questioned
this situation.&nbsp; We both love this beautiful home
<br>in the area of the California gold rush.&nbsp; This is a happy place
that would be hard to leave.&nbsp; I have had people tell me she
<br>&nbsp;needs to be sent on her way to a greater glory.&nbsp; My wife
and I suggested it to her one day and for about a year there was
<br>nothing.&nbsp; Every now and then there is a small reminder of her
in the house.&nbsp; I hope we have been some help to this little
<br>soul, we are a family with a lot of love; enough love for this little
lost soul.

<br><font size=+2>Very Dim Light</font>
<p>By: nick@newnet.com
<p>This happed at my parents house when I was about 8 years old and my
<br>parents still live there Im 30yrs old today and telling this the first
time.
<br>From what I remember we just finished eating dinner, it was about
<br>6:00pm andI remember going to my room and laying on my bed, about to
get up and
<br>go to the living room to watch some tv I turned my head and noticed
a light
<br>on the floor&nbsp; I remember looking up at the light on the ceiling
it was
<br>a very dimm light about 15 watts not enough power to shine on the floor
like a flash
<br>light. I then glanced down again at the floor the light got brighter
woundering what
<br>was happening.Then very slowly a woman was floating up from the ground
were the
<br>light was coming from she was a black lady dressed in a maides uniform
white apron like they
<br>use to wear in the 1800 she started floating towards me and had a nife
in her hand
<br>slowly raising it up I screamed out to my mother and she quickly disappeared
and the light
<br>was gone .
<br>Later that night when I went to bed and fell asleep I felt some thing
<br>percing me on the side and I just kept my eyes closed to scared to
open them thinking she
<br>came back and then that night i dreamed about her chasing me arount
the house trying to kill
<br>me but it was not my parents house I think it was her house&nbsp; and
then woke up.
<br>never saw her again thank god!!! untill the white little boy when i
<br>was 9yrs old but i tell it another time.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>By: Hawiifiveo@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am writing to you in the hopes
that you may be able to help me. I am
<br>19 years old and I live in Brooklyn ,New York. I have always had an
interest
<br>in the paranormal and I think that I can attribute that to my Grandmother
who
<br>instilled in me, the many ghost stories she experienced. I can recall
the
<br>many times that I knew there were other presences in the room with
me...but I
<br>always put it off. My Aunt recognized something in me and she sent
me to the
<br>house of a friend of hers , and that is where I found that I was able
to see
<br>and feel what most people can't. I "saw" ( although I wasn't convinced
that
<br>it wasn't my imagination) 4 definite entities in her house and I was
able to
<br>touch articles that the family had found in the walls, during remodeling,
and
<br>"see" what were like movies playing behind my eyes - of the articles
being
<br>used or held. It was EXTREMELY unnerving. There was a small boot,circa
early
<br>1900's, a small bottle of Ipocac, a small spoon, a piece of pottery,
and the
<br>base of an old iron stove and a stamp. Upon holding the boot, I immediatly
<br>saw a curtain blowing in a breeze and I "heard" someone coughing. As
I was
<br>able to move my gaze around the room, I saw a little boy with dirty-blond
<br>hair lying in a big bed. He looked very pale and sick. I saw a hand
reaching
<br>towards his mouth with what looked like a spoonful of medicine..and
he just
<br>kept coughing. He had his hair cut in a bowl shape. Then it was gone.
I
<br>didn't know what to think. I just told the owner what I had seen.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I "felt" a rightness in
saying the name Alexander, or Alex and she
<br>just smiled. She said that I was absolutley right in what I was saying.
She
<br>had had psychics come into the house and they too had described a boy
by the
<br>name of Alex who died of TB. Later,I found him hiding behind the bar
in the
<br>basement. I could feel that he was upset that I was&nbsp; trying to
find him and
<br>he peeked at me from the bar with a scowl on his face. I told him that
I was
<br>his friend and that I was leaving. The minute that I shut the door,
I felt
<br>him at my back and he proceeded to follow me around the rest of my
time
<br>there. There were other beings in the house that I "saw", including
an old
<br>man in a high-backed wheelchair, he looked directly at me, and I saw
the
<br>hands of a nurse on the handles but that was all that I could see of
her.(
<br>Pretty scared by this point). They supposedly starved to death in the
house
<br>during the war. There is also a beautiful Spanish - looking girl in
a high
<br>necked brown taffeta dress. She supposedly drowned in the river behind
the
<br>house( the house dates back to the early 1700's). I "felt" that her
name was
<br>Merna? Mirna?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I touched a
black marble table in the foyer and I saw many faces
<br>rushing up from the table. The most prominent being the face of an
elderly
<br>women with blond hair and light blue eyeshadow and pink stained lips.
When I
<br>offered that information to the owner, she laughed and told me that
the women
<br>who owned the table before her had looked just as I had described.
The whole
<br>family accepts the "roommates" and usually speaks to them and treats
them as
<br>if they are family.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it possible
that I don't really have a special abilty, and that
<br>I am just picking up leftover energy? I "feel"&nbsp; things that others
don't and
<br>I have a hard time getting others to listen to me without cynicism
or
<br>scoffing. I would like to use this ability? to help others if I have
it. I
<br>too have had a bad experience with the ouija and with evil entities
<br>inhabiting the household. I have also felt extreme tension and dislike
from
<br>various entities in different places. I know how it feels and if I
can
<br>further this ability in order to help others , then please tell me
how I
<br>could approach that task. Is it possible at all? I would love to hear
any
<br>input on this subject so if anyone gets a quick minute...please drop
me a
<br>note. Ok? :} Thanks so much.

<p><font size=+2>My College</font>
<p>By: joann.ethridge@sympatico.ca
<p>Hey. I had an expierence(s) I thought I should share. I go to a college
<br>where one of the campuses
<br>is haunted. I am in a Paramedic course at a well known Toronto, Ontario
<br>college. And my girlfriend is in the "haunted" campus taking Accounting.
<br>I went one evening to pick her up because we were supposed to go out
for
<br>dinner, and as soon as a walked in the old building a caught really
cold
<br>gust of of air in one spot of the hallway while the rest of the hallway
<br>is at room temperature. Its one freaky place,&nbsp; man. There is these
rooms
<br>that make the hair on the back of neck stand up. Apparently this was
an
<br>old mental hospital (I think I might have given too much away about
what
<br>college it is). Anyway, my other story. I lived with a ghost for a
few
<br>years in my parents' old house, I take it this ghost like "Man Who
Sold
<br>The World" from Nirvana because cd could be in its case on the damn
<br>shelf, and I'd come home and it old be in my player on repeat very
low
<br>volume. Im pretty sure my mom or dad wouldn't listen to Nirvana, because
<br>they hate Kurt Cobain. One night I was coming home late from work and
<br>walked in and heard a voice from the kitchen say "hey Mike", I thought
<br>it was my dad but when I looked nobody was there, I thought "damn I
must
<br>be tired", and went to bed. The next night I was in the basement lifting
<br>some weights (pumpin' some iron) when out to the corner of my eye I
<br>caught sight of a figure coming down the stairs, when I looked it was
my
<br>grandpa, I turned my head, blessed myself and prayed "no, not me, don't
<br>take me". And when I looked back he was gone. It's been a few years
<br>since that, and I always say that if I had my time back I would have
<br>talked to him and see what it was he wanted from me. I told my mom
about
<br>this just the other day and she said that she had saw the same thing
<br>while folding laundry, he would come down to the second last step,
smile
<br>and disappear, so I am not nuts I guess, my dad had felt a presence
but
<br>not seen anything. But about that college my girlfriend had seen little
<br>streaks of light and shadows, and many other other strange things.
It's
<br>mostly the feeling you get from being in there. Anyway that's all.

<p><font size=+2>Haunted because of Me and Her</font>
<p>By: Scriptshb@aol.com
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I've lived in my house for about 9 years now. we moved in the summer
before i
<br>started third grade and I'm now 17.i know that the stuff i'm about
to
<br>describe could never have happened but it did and its the truth. at
first i
<br>would see things out of the corner of my eye and write it off and not
think
<br>about but when i was nine or ten is when i had my first experance.
my friend
<br>was reading the story Bloody Mary (a well known ghost story) and my
bedroom
<br>door burst open and a cold wind came in my room knocking all the hats
off my
<br>wall. my parents were gone it was just her and i. then i started to
notice a
<br>tall black shadow of a man walk into my kitchen and the first couple
of times
<br>i though it was my dad but then i woul remember no one was home but
me. and a
<br>couple of years ago i notice that when i would have to go to the bathroom
in
<br>the middle of the night and i'd go into the hall way i felt like someone
was
<br>running towards me. the last year he stoped running at me but would
be at the
<br>end of the hall standing next to the couch with another black shadow
sitting
<br>on the middle of the couch looking at me.i was starting to think i
was isane
<br>untill one day me and my to best friends started talking about ghost
and
<br>stuff like it and i told them about what i had saw and they said they
saw it
<br>to and this not a once and a while thing this is everynight. well after
<br>talking to them so wierd stuff started to happen like a pack of my
friends
<br>gum disappeared and then about six months later i found it under my
wallunit
<br>which is on the other side of the room.another event that happened
to me was
<br>i was sitting on the floor of my room listening to music with the lights
off
<br>i saw someone walking towards me i mean i could see the shoes and the
crease
<br>in the pants but like that it was gone. now i've noticed the older
i get the
<br>more i see things where ever i go. like walking home from school i
was
<br>looking down at my shirt but could still see the road clearly i saw
someone
<br>on a bike on the other side of the road go into on coming traffic and
get hit
<br>by a car but when i looked up no one was there. i see the shadow people
as me
<br>and my two friends call them at my grandma's house. once when i was
in the
<br>shower i heard my friends voice say my name but she was in the desert
<br>somewhere. but the most recent and puzzling were at another one of
my friend
<br>birthday party we went to a park near her house. they were off playing
hide
<br>and go seek. my friend Lacieand i were sitting on the swings and i
got this
<br>feeling of someone needings help then all hell broke out and some wierd
<br>things started happening by the end though we figured out the some
kid had
<br>hurt and killed another kid we don't know if the kid meant to or not
but when
<br>we left something want us to go back but at the same time something
wanted us
<br>to leave.Lacie was walking next to me when she turned around and took
off
<br>towards the park and i started after knowing if she reached the park
<br>something bad would happen as i was running after her something told
my to
<br>stop and just as i did lacie triped over something and hit the ground
hard.
<br>but the one that has me really freaked out is a couple of weeks ago
lacie ws
<br>telling me about this picture of a magician smiled at her so we held
a
<br>seince(you know where you are in a group and try to contact the dead)
well we
<br>found out that lacie reminded this dead magician Cardini of his wife.
and now
<br>when a slow song plays she will start dancing by her self but she's
not
<br>because if i close my eyes i can see him and feel what he is thinking.lacie
<br>wants to ignore all the things we have seen but i know that the older
we get
<br>and the more she tries not to believe the more we'll see these things
