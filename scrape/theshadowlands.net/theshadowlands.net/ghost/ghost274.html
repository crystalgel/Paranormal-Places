<P><B>Ghosts Lights of Cherokee</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: HMoore6016@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a year ago, i graduated from Western Carolina
University in Cullowhee, NC</B>
<BR><B>and this story relates to lights that can be seen similar to the
brown mountain lights</B>
<BR><B>but apparently have not been as publicized. Anyway it is located
off of an overlook off&nbsp; the blueridge parkway exit in Cherokee, NC.
I was first told of this by one of my friends who was a local of the area
and used to go up there with his high school friends and witness the same
thing. If you park your car facing the distant valley on a clear moonlit
night, you will see these unexplainable lights moving up and down the mountain
and into the valley on a usual basis. Its nothing scary, but it does arouse
your imagination for sure. Knowing college students and their incredible
amount of free time, there were several occasions where i would go up there
along with several friends just to see them and to prove the skeptics wrong.
the lights would sway back and forth and change colors from bright white
to all other colors associated with a spectrum, as if there was someone
swaying a lantern back and forth. I would then flash my bright lights at
them and they would scatter out moving quicker as if they were coming toward
us. On one occasion, we heard a coyote howl so that spelled LEAVE for us.
Sometimes a single very bright light would beam out at us from the peak
of the far mountain. There are no roads on the far mountain, so they are
definitely not headlights like some might suspect. Whether earthly gases
associated with a fault line are to blame as the culprit or actual ghostly
anomolies, they sure do arouse the imagination. Also the tunnel right before
the overlook is spooky for sure. I feel that this should be investigated
further and added to North Carolina's questionable places. The Blue Ridge
mountains do have a lot of history especially in the Cherokee region.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Siting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ace101@prodigy.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>It all started about 6 months ago.I would always start whistling
for no reason.My mom would always tell me to be quiet when she was on the
phone or when my dad and her were wacthing tv.I would stop for a minute
then start again and get yelled at.Well one night i had just went to bed
and i deciced tonight i would sleep with the tv off so i did.The room was
silent for about 5 minutes then i heard whistling.My mom and dad were sleeping
and they hated my noise anyway and my brother was not home.No one was awake
but me,and at first i said just my imagination.Then i went back to sleep
and it seemed like as soon as I laid my head down,the whistling started
again.I woke up turned on the light again and there was no one there and
the window was closed.I stayed up till 4 that night with the tv on too
scared to go to sleep.I do believe in the supernatural and I thought a
ghost was trying to scare me.I told my friends and family but they never
believed me.Well after that night i have never whistled again.I think this
happened because this sprit maybe was trying to show me how annoying my
whistling was.Maybe it was trying to say you know how you want me to stop,
well thats how your parents feel.And since I stoped I never heard that
noise again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghostly Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: devilish_angel4ever@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello I just recently found your sight and I love it. I don't share
my stories on many websights. Matter of fact I think you are the 2nd. Anyhoo
I have had many ghostly encounters ever sence I could remember. I'm pretty
use to them, but I will admitt that sometimes they freak me out. Well I'm
just going to write a couple for now I will probably write some later.</B>
<BR><B>Well my earliest memory of seeing a ghost happened when I was about
4. I woke up lying in my bed looking up at the cealing. Floating in mid
air I saw a man in a rocking chair reading. He seemed to be in his late
20's or early 30's. He was solid but multi-coloured (I know it sounds weird).
I remember that she was mostly purple and pink. I wasn't scared at all.
I just lyed there and looked at him I guess I was curious more than anything.
All of a sudden I saw him turn towards me and noticing I was awake and
looking at him he just melted away. I ran up to my grandma's room and described
the man to her. She took out a picture and it was him. Turned out that
he was my uncle. I didn't even know that I had an uncle. He had died when
my mom was only 3 so I had never heard of him. I guess he just wanted to
meet me :)</B>
<BR><B>The same sort of thing happened to me a few years later. I will
start by explaining that I grew up around a dobermin. He thought I was
his puppy and followed me around every where and protected me. He was put
to sleep when I was really young yet I still remeber. I think it was about
a year after and I couldn't sleep one night. I lyed awake in my bed starring
at the cealing. I was already kind of scared ( I was scared of the dark).
When all of a sudden I saw my dog come into the room (floating a couple
inches off the floor). He looked the same as I had remembered but he was
see-through. I watched him for a couple of minutes untill he hovered over
my bed. He came really close as if he was going to lick my face. I tried
to put my hand out to pet him but it just went through him. So of course
me being very young I screamed and cried. My dog seemed sad that I wasn't
happy to see him but he slowly left melting slowly into thin air. By the
time my parents came in the room he was already gone. Surprizingly they
beleived me.</B>
<BR><B>Sorry I hope that wasn't too long. Thoughs are my earliest ghost
memories. I'll share more later. Keep up the good work on the sight, I
love it ! :)</B>

<P><B>He Was Harmless</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: heathershaw78@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have never seen a ghost myself, but my mother has had a couple
of encounters over the years.&nbsp; When she was about 5, she was staying
overnight at her aunt's or grandma's house, I am not sure which, when she
woke up sometime in the night and saw a lady in white slowly walk by her.
She stopped and looked at my mother, who then proceeded to hide under the
blankets.&nbsp; Many years later, my mother told her sister about this
incident, and to her shock, her sister admitted to also seeing this lady
in white wander the house late at night.&nbsp; My mother's next incident
took place in the house I was born in, my mother still lives there.&nbsp;
I was probably about 13 at the time, my father works on the road, so he
was out of town at the time of this occurrence.&nbsp; My sister, younger
brother and myself were asleep upstairs, while my mother was asleep downstairs.&nbsp;
She was awoken with a start at around 3:00 in the morning.&nbsp; Standing
next to her bed was the shadow of a man wearing a hat, staring at my mom.&nbsp;
The kitchen is right outside my mom's room and we always leave the kitchen
light on, so the man was somewhat illuminated although she could not make
out any features.&nbsp; She had to go to the bathroom really bad, but could
not get up because the man was standing right there. So she kept closing
and opening her eyes until&nbsp; finally he was gone.&nbsp; We haven't
really had any other incidents.&nbsp; My mother felt that the man was harmless.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Jerome Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Leighsagoddess@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Our story... we went to Jerome Cemetery in Jerome, Indiana.&nbsp;
I, myself, had been there a few times before, but nothing exciting had
really happened except being thoroughly creeped out and swearing someone
was walking behind me.&nbsp; Since one of us owned a video camera, we took
it along for the ride.&nbsp; When we arrived we walked around and I showed
my two friends some of the interesting graves there.&nbsp; It still sounded
like someone was walking right behind us (as it always does), but we just
brushed it off.&nbsp; We were filming most of the time we were there and
just having regular everyday conversation about nothing in particular.&nbsp;
Then we started to see stuff in the woods.&nbsp; We still brushed it off
... but we all had a bad feeling.&nbsp; The time came for me to film and
we started to walk around the cemetery again and I noticed a bluish light
in the camera that I couldn't see otherwise.&nbsp; The light couldn't have
been from the sun because we were in a shadowy area.&nbsp; And when I started
to walk backward, it started to come forward.&nbsp; So we all ran back
to my car... we didn't want to stay any longer.&nbsp; Upon viewing the
tape, we found a lot of different things.&nbsp; There are people with actual
shapes and features.&nbsp; It looks like they're real, but we were the
only ones there.&nbsp; So we went back that night to see if we could get
more.&nbsp; One of my friends was too afraid to come back, so her cousin
came in her stead.&nbsp; While there, he filmed most of the time.&nbsp;
I left my headlights in my car on because I had never been there at night
and didn't feel like being there in the dark.&nbsp; We didn't go far because
myself and my other friend (both of us are female) had a really bad feeling
again.&nbsp; We were about to head back to the car, and i started to take
the camera from my friend's cousin and i felt a hand pushing me toward
him as i was reaching for the camera.&nbsp; Something literally touched
my back.&nbsp; So i decided i was getting out of there right then.&nbsp;
Upon viewing the video, there is an orb that goes across the screen right
as i was touched.&nbsp; there wasn't as much in the background of the night
video in terms of other "people" but there is the orb and the touching
experience to make up for it.&nbsp; That's it... we're planning another
trip, but only after we fully recover from this one...</B><B></B>

<P><B>Lady on the Stairs</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lpe1962@aol.com.</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I live in a Northern suburb of Boston in a 9 year old home.&nbsp;
My home backs to conservation land and there is no history of a home being
on this site prior.&nbsp; It was always forest.&nbsp; I have lived here
3 years and have a ghost that lives on my staircase and the front foyer
of the house.&nbsp; She wasn't always here but made herself known about
2 years ago.&nbsp; I have also had other "guest" ghost pass through my
house but not take up permanent residence*.&nbsp; Up until 2 weeks ago
I never saw the lady on the stairs but heard her and felt her "watching"
me.&nbsp; She's watching me right know as I type on the computer. . .&nbsp;
She doesn't scare me anymore.&nbsp; Somehow (I don't know how) I know that
she just enjoys watching my family live life.&nbsp; She's harmless.&nbsp;
My two small children have seen and felt things (my 16 month old says "hi"
to someone nearly every time I take him up and down the stairs) my three
year old has always had issues with the stairs always telling me he was
afraid. I consulted a professional and they told me to tell my lady ghost
not to let herself be seen or heard anymore or else she would have to leave-this
helped a lot).&nbsp;&nbsp; Things were relatively calm until last month
when we decided to put our house on the market.&nbsp; My 3 year old claims
his bed bumps (this is a 3 year old word) and there are noises in his room
(I again told her to stop and she did).&nbsp; I am very tuned in to my
lady ghost's feelings.&nbsp; I can feel when she is happy or sad or disturbed.&nbsp;
When I'm stressed out and yelling at my kids she gets upset - I'll hear
her opening and closing the baby gates at the bottom of the stairs.&nbsp;
If I talk to someone about her in while I'm in the house and make a comment
like "She's been really quiet lately, perhaps she went to the light" she
will then make herself noticed with sounds.&nbsp; Lately I haven't been
able to sleep very well due to the stress of having to sell my house.&nbsp;
Two weeks ago instead of tossing and turning and disturbing my husband
I decided to check that my kids were under their duvets.&nbsp; As I walked
from one end of the house to the other (whilst passing the stairwell),
I got a "flash" glimpse of my lady standing three steps from the bottom
steps, body facing the front door but her face turned toward me.&nbsp;
She is a small elderly lady dressed in black clothes from a century or
so ago.&nbsp; She is also very sad.&nbsp; I can somehow tell she doesn't
want me to move away.&nbsp; I either dream these messages or I just get
them somehow but I do get them and I don't know how.&nbsp; I know she is
originally from the town of Winchester and her life was a good one with
lots of family around her.&nbsp; My husband has also heard this woman noises
and we both have seen black and white flashes throughout various rooms
on the first floor of the house at different times.&nbsp; Initially everything
is threatening but after the fact it is not.&nbsp; We have "cold" spots
in the house (when you get that creepy feeling your being watched).</B>
<BR><B>*Other ghosts were noises of heavy footsteps and smells.&nbsp; I
had a smelly, person in my house that really scared me.&nbsp; It happened
last summer and I was home alone with my kids sound asleep in their beds.&nbsp;
I went to throw the garbage out by going down though the basement into
the garage.&nbsp; I heard heavy footsteps in the great room above the garage
and I was terrified and ran upstairs (thinking someone was potentially
hurting my children).&nbsp; My dog was lying in the kitchen (not something
he would do if someone entered our house uninvited) so I went into the
great room and could smell the strong scent of old sweat on a man (like
dirty workout clothes that were recycled).&nbsp; As I walked around the
great room, the smell moved around.&nbsp; I was really scared&nbsp; The
smell (and cold spot) went from the great room to the dining room and back
to the great room and then the sun room.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told him to leave
and he left.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Montevallo Dorm Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Madkld@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>When I was a student at the University of Montevallo, in Montevallo,
Alabama, I had heard of the supposed ghosts that roamed the campus. I thought
the stories were fascinating but never really put much stock into them.
I've always been intrigued by the paranormal and have had strange "feelings"
about places but had never come face-to-face with a ghost. In the fall
of '91, I was staying with two of my best friends in their dorm room in
Main Hall, the largest and oldest dormitory on campus. I was having problems
getting to sleep and was rather restless. Well, when trying to get comfortable,
I happened to look at the door, which was directly in front of me. Standing
in front of the door was a girl. For a split second thought she was one
of my friends, but as soon as I thought "Why is Jane standing at the door?"
Jane moved in her bed, and I immediately knew the person in front of the
door was not either of my friends. Then I thought, "Perhaps, it's my imagination,
and if I stare at it long enough, I'll realize it's picture or something,
hanging on the door." After watching this person watch me with a smile
on her face for about two minutes, I realized it wasn't a picture and it
wasn't my imagination. She had on a short sleeve, white shirt, short bobbed,
black hair, and her skin was pail. She had her hands on her hips and just
moved her head and watched the three of us sleep. Being the coward that
I am, I threw the covers over my head and asked her to go away. (I don't
know what good throwing the covers over my head would have done, but it
allowed me an escape from looking at her.) Anyway, I would still stay with
my friends from time-to-time, after that, but whenever I'd get ready to
go to bed. I just closed my eyes, and never looked around.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Since I had not scene or heard anything besides that one time,
I chalked it up to an over active imagination and decided to move on campus,
in the same dorm, the following school year. One night, right before Christmas,
I had been cramming for finals and was so wired I couldn't get to sleep.
I remember thinking how load the dorm seemed. The girls in the hall above
sounded like they were doing gymnastics, and the girls who walked up the
flight of stairs that shared my dorm room wall seemed to open and close
the doors a little louder than usual. It was strange; it was as if my senses
were heightened. So, needless to say, since I was feeling a bit put off
by the noise, and stressing over my Biology final, I couldn't sleep. I
remember tossing and turning a couple of times until I found a comfortable
position, and then I heard it. I heard something hit my wardrobe. We had
really old wardrobes in each room. The closing mechanism in my wardrobe
had a problem working, and when it was shut, it had a very distinct sound.
There was no other way it could make a noise unless it were hit or closed.
I immediately turned over and there she was! It was the same girl I had
seen the previous year! She was standing with her arms on her hips, as
she looked at me and smiled. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. So, I
tried to wake up my roommate. Nothing seemed to come out, except a squeak!
When I finally got my roommates name out, the girl turned her head to look
at my roommate. I then turned my head to see if my roommate had woken up,
but all she did was roll over! When I looked back, the girl was still there.
So, what did I do? That's right, I threw the covers over my head and asked
her to leave and never return. I looked again, and she was gone. I never
saw or heard her again. I can't say that I didn't feel like she was there
from time to time, because I did. However, I was not disappointed to have
never seen her again. It was just too much to be the only one that saw
her. Thanks for letting me tell my story!</B><B></B>

and</B>
<BR><B>wife's room, they were still up and he could here them talking as</B>
<BR><B>couples sometimes do in bed.&nbsp; When they got to the archway

<P><B>Presidio Hall</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BNR61903@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>First off I want you to know I am sharing my experience because I
think you website is GREAT!&nbsp; Anyway moving on, I have always been
wanting to see a ghost or something out of the ordinary, some weird phenomenon.
Anyway I was looking at your site and looking for places to go and find
ghost, well I'm here in San Diego and I found some places on your site
and checked them out, no luck the first couple places so I figured I would
never get the chance to see something strange. Well, last night 7/21/03
at about 10 PM we headed out to Old Town to see what we could find. We
checked out the Whaley House, (which I have been to before) hoping to maybe
see a peeking face through the windows. Or maybe catch one of those orb
things. I'm pretty new at all this ghost hunting stuff so you'll have to
bare with me. After we checked out the Whaley House, we decided to check
out another place on your site, on Presidio Hill, the shed across from
the mission. OK here it goes, we pull up to this little adobe looking thing,
(the shed) about 20 ft high or so, and about 20 ft wide. I'm going to try
to explain it as best as possible. there are stairs leading up to the top
of this adobe structure, at the top the is a place where you can stand
on top and look around the park, there's about a 3 ft wall that borders
the top of this shed. Well, on your site it says the is a Pentagram made
of cobblestones, and a guardian watching over the shed has been seen, so
we thought we would see. Well unfortunately we never made it to the top,
on our way up the stairs before you are to enter the top part of the shed,
my buddy handed me his flashlight while he recorded with the cam recorder,
being pretty scared at this point he decided to peek over the wall with
the camera before we walked all the way up, he raised the camera above
his head trying to peek over the wall, as he swept the camera to the right
towards the access to the top, out of nowhere we hear something that sounds
like a snarl, NO SH*T, well we booked it, ran as fast as we could back
to the truck, we went back down the hill freaking out. At the bottom we
reviewed the tape and on tape it sounded a bit different, BUT STILL VERY
UNUSUAL* on the tape it sounds like someone took a deep breath right by
the camera. Now, we went over all aspects of what could have caused this,
we know it was not us, i was right next to him and i know it did not come
from him, even if he did, with the camera at least 2 ft above his head,
it would not have been as loud and as clear as it is on film, so we said
maybe there is a bum at the top sleeping and just so happened he snored
as we were up there, well we decided to go back to the shed, and we did,
BUT this time there was a cop in the parking lot, we puled up and he was
coming down from the top of the shed, i guess checking out the place, (
i think the park people saw our flashlights and told the cops to check
it out) anyway, IF there was somebody up there the cop would have had them
leave the place, BUT he was by himself, so that knocked out the "what if
somebody was up there" So i truly think that something, Don't know what,
but something very strange made that sound. I don't know what to believe,
but i am really still freaked out about it. If you could i would like a
response to tell me what you think and IF you really want a better picture
of what went on, i will send you a copy of what happened, and you can hear
it with your own ears!!! Truly Weird!!! very wicked noise**</B>

<BR><B>Hand of Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: malc2112@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My aunt used to babysit me when I was a kid. She used to take me
with her to the old folks home where she would hang out and visit with
the people.I remember one particular time I was there with her and we were
all holding hands singing. There were probably about 20 of us in a circle.
I was only about seven or so ,I dont remember what the song was or what
or if I knew the words but what I do remeber is feeling someone put their
hand over my heart. It didn't startle me. I couldn't tell where it was
coming(or standing) from but I could feel it press my shirt! Well this
lasted until the song was over and the sensation went away.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Later on after we hopped in my aunt's Bug to go home I told
her what had happened. She didn't seem very suprised! She said to me ,"That's
the hand of God you felt".</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I never told anyone this story . I think it could have very
well been a ghost.</B><B></B>

<P><B>It Happened</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: fruipy69@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my husband and I rented our first apartment we should have been
informed of what had happened there 10 years earlier but I think the landlord
forgot to mention it when we signed the lease!</B>
<BR><B>We rented a two bedroom apartment in Schuyler Falls, New York. It
was a piecefull little place and our children loved the huge backyard.
The building was well over a hundred years old and was the old shoolhouse.
The only thing that remained was the foundation and so the 4 apartment
house was built. There's also an old cemetary in the woods no more than
50 yards away. That should have been my first clue that something wasnt
quite right there since it was mostly children and babies buried in it.
Well anyhow, we had lived there for only about 2-3 months when strange
things started to happen. The first incident happened when we left to go
for a late night drive. When we returned, ALL of our lights were on! Figuring
the landlord was fixing something we paid no attention until we went to
walk in. The door was still locked. When we entered however, there was
something else entirerly going on other than lights on. The tv was flipping
channels by itself! We went around and turned most things off and put the
kids to bed. That was all for that night but it didnt end all together.
The tv had an odd habit of the sleep timer counting down even though we
didnt have a working remote to turn it on (my tv was older and the only
way to set the timer was by remote only). It seemed everytime we turned
around the tv would flip through the channels despite the fact there was
no remote! Things just heated up as time went on. Bread would fall off
the refriderator even though it was placed in the center because we thouht
it was just to close to the edge. Another thing was we had an antique table
that held an old ashtray. The ashtray sat on an old doily my grandmother
had made. We had a few friends over one evening and the 5 of us witnessed
the ashtray slowly slide to the edge of the table and fall onto the kitchen
floor, shattering into a million pieces. Needless to say Stephen and the
other 2 guys left rather hastily that night and refused to come back. Only
on a few occasions did we hear children talking. About a month before we
moved out we went to our fuel company to have some fuel delivered. We had
heard rumors that someone had died in that building but dismissed them
as gossip despite what had happened. While ordering fuel that day we ere
talking to an elderly lady who remembered going to school in that building.
The topic turned to the man who died. Turns out it was her daughter's ex-boyfriend.
She had broken up with him for another man and he turned to alcohol. One
night he took a gun and shot himself in the head in our kitchen! The apartment
was closed down for a year for the investigation. Had I known that before
I looked at the place I would have passed it up. My guess is he didnt want
us there and had a nice way of showing it!</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;My Wife's Hospital Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: vancouverdandan@yahoo.ca</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My wife has been a nurse at Vancouver General Hospital in Vancouver,
Canada for nearly 25 years this year.</B>
<BR><B>There used to be a building called the Fairview Pavilion across
12th Ave. but it was torn down several years ago and a staff exercise building
was put up in its place. Anyhow she told me of some weird happenings both
funny and odd. Funny as in stories of visiting patients from the local
jail or pen who would try to escape. Its the little odd ones that I'd like
to share with you Shadowland readers.</B>
<BR><B>One story she related to me had to do with a radio. There was one
time during the night shift when she was doing her rounds that one patient
was having a tough time resting. She would come back to check up on the
patient regulary and was very upset that the patient was suffering so.
She said to herself in her mind that hmmm some soft soothing music might
help calm the patient down. Right after she thought that the radio on the
bedside table came on!</B>
<BR><B>Other stories I heard were of pranks played by the ghosts. One time
as my wife was sitting at the station at night she saw the attention light
come on. Her colleague and her looked at each other as they both knew that
there weren't any patients in that room at the time! Well guess who had
to go turn off the light? They both went together for support and of course
they couldn't find anything. Other odd pranks were flushing toilets when
no one was in that particular room. As there were gov't funding cutbacks
one of the upper floors was closed down but all of the furniture was left
in place. This particular building had those old elevators with the folding
cage doors like you see in the movies. Sometimes the elevator would be
called up to that floor!</B>
<BR><B>The most spectacular incident (which I don't think was ghostly at
all but had to do with a guardian angel) involved my wife goes like this:</B>
<BR><B>My wife was diagnosed with lupus during that time. This was a couple
of years before they tore the building down. The doctors could not figure
out what were the causes of her illness for the longest time prior. Her
insides would go into a knot and she would go into anaphalactic shock.
She had to carry those self administering adrenalin injectors like those
that people who are allergic to bee and wasp stings.</B>
<BR><B>Anyhow her stomach wasn't feeling very good and she told one of
her colleages that she was going downstairs to the locker room. She told
me that the stomach problem brought on the shock and she collapsed on the
floor and passed out. At that precise moment the wife of one of the patients
that passed away a while ago while under my wife's care came in and asked
to see my wife. Nobody at the station knew where my wife went until the
colleague who did know came back from her rounds and said "oh, she told
me she went down to the locker room". Well she checked her time and noted
that its been quite a while and should have been back. At that moment the
staff went down to search for her and found her on the floor passed out.
My wife was wheeled to Emergency and she recovered.</B>
<BR><B>My wife and her colleagues afterwards discussed the incident when
she went back to work later in the week and said that it was very very
odd that this nice lady would show up at that moment to look for her just
to say thank you for looking after her husband.</B><B></B>

approched</B>
<BR><B>the Almy Coal Mines,</B>
<BR><B>We looked at eachother asking what the heck are those people doing
there!!??</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I was driving and slid to a stop becouse I did not want to
hit them. As</B>
<BR><B>they came closer I got an eerie feeling then the people walked right
through</B>
<BR><B>the car...we were dumbfounded..We did not see any deer just those
eerie</B>
<BR><B>people. It was very strange.&nbsp; It was well known in Wyoming
that 500 or more</B>
<BR><B>souls died in the</B>
<BR><B>Almy Coal mines that are still on fire today (2003)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If one takes a ride</B>
<BR><B>towards Jackson Hole Wyoming in the middle of the night, by the
Almy Coal</B>
<BR><B>Mines, they may see the ghostly figures of the Chinese who died
walking to</B>
<BR><B>the coal mines...It was a very very strange sighting.</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story took place at an old house we rented in Bradley Beach,
NJ.&nbsp; One night my ex-girlfriend and I had just laid down for bed.
She fell asleep right away but I lay there on my back for about five minutes
when all of a sudden I see someone out of the corner of my eye leaning
into the doorway. Well ....I turn my head and sure as s**t, there's a dark
shadow sillhouette of a women leaning into the room and she's looking dead
at me! I could see her sillhouette but no detail of her face and judging
by her hairstyle it could not have been the only other grown-up in the
house(my ex's sister).Plus ..she was already in bed. The shadow then just
pulled the door shut a little and left out into the hallway. I never heard
any footsteps. I was too darn tired to give chase. Yeah right! I was like...No
way! I ended up just falling asleep. I never saw the thing again.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My great-aunt and uncle live in Indiana. I'm not sure what part,
because I</B>
<BR><B>have only been there once and it was when I was in the 4th grade...I
don't ever</B>
<BR><B>intend on going back there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandmother has told me several different
stories that has happened at</B>
<BR><B>her sister and brother-in-law's house,which would be my great-aunt
and uncle,</B>
<BR><B>and I never believed her until I had an experience of my own. This
house is</B>
<BR><B>over 100 years old. Upstairs there is an area stacked with chairs.
My</B>
<BR><B>great-uncle told me,my little brother, and my cousin that if you
go into that area it</B>
<BR><B>becomes very cold, because there is a ghost in their house and that
is where it</B>
<BR><B>stays. Ofcourse, we didn't believe him, because when you're a little
kid your</B>
<BR><B>parents tell you that ghosts are not real...and you believe them,
because</B>
<BR><B>they are your parents. So, we walked upstairs and stood in the area
where all of</B>
<BR><B>the chairs were...and...nothing happened. As we were about to leave
the area</B>
<BR><B>and walk back downstairs we stepped into this spot that was icey
cold. It made</B>
<BR><B>every hair on my arms stand up. We looked at each other and ran
down the</B>
<BR><B>stairs as fast as we could. We were so thankful that our grandparents
brought their</B>
<BR><B>motor-home for us to sleep in the week that we were going to be
there. They</B>
<BR><B>wouldn't even stay in the house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second experience there was once again upstairs.
But, this time it was</B>
<BR><B>in the play room. My cousin and I were babysitting our two little
cousins,</B>
<BR><B>one which was only a couple of months old and the other 2. Matthew,
the youngest</B>
<BR><B>was sitting up playing with a wiffle ball and all of the sudden
he looked up</B>
<BR><B>and just started crying hysterically. We tried to calm him down
and he just</B>
<BR><B>wouldn't stop. Then his sister, who was 2, had her eyes fixed on
something, but</B>
<BR><B>when we looked there was nothing there. We picked them both up and
took them</B>
<BR><B>downstairs...he quite crying...</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those were only experiences that I myself had
in that house. But, my</B>
<BR><B>grandmother has told us other stories that have happened there.
My 2 year old</B>
<BR><B>cousin that I meantioned...when she was only a couple of months
old my great-aunt</B>
<BR><B>left her upstairs in the playroom. She went downstairs for not even
a second,</B>
<BR><B>but she put the "babygate" up infront of the stairs so that Alaina
wouldn't</B>
<BR><B>fall or try to climb down them and hurt herself. When my great-aunt
came</B>
<BR><B>back...Alaina was sitting at the bottom of the stairs...the babygate
was still up...</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will never set foot inside that house again...or
if I ever decide</B>
<BR><B>to...I definately won't go upstairs...sinks turn on...toilets flush...the
dog barks</B>
<BR><B>at thin air...my great-uncle told us that he has seen the ghost
before...it's</B>
<BR><B>a woman...whoever she is...doesn't want anyone upstairs...</B>

<P><B>I felt this true-life happening would be</B>
<BR><B>a good one for your site to see if somethng like it has ever happened
to</B>
<BR><B>anyone else.&nbsp; I'm sure it has..</B>
<BR><B>This all happened when I was 13 yrs old. I am 19 now. One night
while myself</B>
<BR><B>and my two brothers and my cousin were staying the night at my Grandmothers</B>
<BR><B>house strange occurences happened.</B>
<BR><B>My Grandfather has been passed away for about 15 years now.&nbsp;
He and my</B>
<BR><B>Grandmother built the house my Grandma still lives in.&nbsp; That
night while</B>
<BR><B>watching Late night TV with Grandma she fell asleep and everyone
else went</B>
<BR><B>to bed.&nbsp; I was sitting and Watching TV as usual and Grandma
fell into a very</B>
<BR><B>deep sleep.&nbsp; I heard this heavy breathing coming from just
on the other side</B>
<BR><B>of the coffee table.&nbsp; I was sitting on the couch and I couldn't
see the</B>
<BR><B>other side of the table from where I was.&nbsp; It is a very old
table that sits</B>
<BR><B>up pretty high and you cannot see through the sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The heavy breathing</B>
<BR><B>grew louder and louder.&nbsp; I started to call for my Grandma to
wake up, wake</B>
<BR><B>up then started to basically yell at her to wake up.&nbsp; But,
she just would</B>
<BR><B>not wake up.&nbsp; I also noticed that the breathing pattern wasn't
the same</B>
<BR><B>pattern as my grandma by watching her and listening.&nbsp; The breathing</B>
<BR><B>eventually stopped and my Grandma woke up as soon as it did.&nbsp;
By the way she</B>
<BR><B>has a large living room and she was sitting in the other end of
it.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>tolded her what had happened and she said that right in front of
the coffee</B>
<BR><B>table is the last place my grandfather ever laid down in the house
before he</B>
<BR><B>got up to go to the hospital where he passed away at.&nbsp; The
next morning my</B>
<BR><B>brother and my cousin said they were in the room talking before
they fell</B>
<BR><B>asleep and all the sudden the door opened about half way.&nbsp;
They said they</B>
<BR><B>were aksing who was there time and time over, but no one ever answered.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>grandma, my other brother and myself were all in bed at the time
they said</B>
<BR><B>it happened.&nbsp; None of us were afraid of this then or now, because
we feel</B>
<BR><B>that it is my Grandpa just checking in on his Grandchildren.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Crying Child</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BRUBALCABA@CNBTX.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is Betty and I would like to share an experience that
my family and I have had.</B>
<BR><B>Although I live in Texas, I was born in California, and it was there
that I had my first encounter.</B>
<BR><B>In the summer of 1984, I was 4 years old, and my parents, my new-born
baby sister and I were spending the night at my unlce aunt's house, who
lived about two hours away.&nbsp; Around three in the morning, I was awakened
by a child crying.&nbsp; Since I was asleep in my cousin's bedroom, I looked
over to her bed to see if maybe she had woken up and wanted something (she's
two years younger than myself and has Down's Syndrome, so half the time
she yells or cries to get our attention).&nbsp; She was sound asleep, so
it couldn't have been her.&nbsp; I then thought that maybe my new baby
sister, who was about 4 weeks old at the time, was crying and my parents
hadn't heard her, so I peeked into the bedroom they were sleeping, but
all three of them were fast asleep.&nbsp; Being so young, I didn't feel
scared, just curious as to who was crying and where were their parents?&nbsp;
Since it was so late and I was really sleepy, I decided to forget about
it and go back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>The entire year of 1984, every time we visited my aunt's house,
I would hear crying really late at night.&nbsp; I never felt fear, just
pity for the child who's crying was never comforted.</B>
<BR><B>For the next couple of years, as I grew, I forgot about the crying
and focused on the important things in my life - school, playing with my
friends, etc.&nbsp; I hadn't thought about it until about four years ago,
when I was 19.&nbsp; My aunt and uncle had moved to New Mexico two years
prior, wanting to be closer to us.&nbsp; I don't know why suddenly the
memory of some child came to me one afternoon when we were visiting them.&nbsp;
So wanting to know the story behind the crying, I asked my unlce.&nbsp;
I was already imagining that it was the trapped soul of a little boy who
had been brutally murdered somewhere in the neighborhood, or that it was
a little boy who had been run over by a speeding teen, who left him there
to die...anyways, the ideas in my head were immense, each more violent
than the other!&nbsp; Imagine my disappointment when my uncle said that
he had no idea what I was talking about.&nbsp; So, not to be left wondering
the truth, I asked my aunt.&nbsp; Can you imagine my joy when she confided
that she had also heard it?</B>
<BR><B>It turns out that in the year 1983, my uncle and aunt's neighbors
had a six-and-a-half year old son who had been diagnosed with leukemia.&nbsp;
He was given a very slim chance to live, but there was hope for him.&nbsp;
If he lived to be seven, he would be able to have a blood tranfusion which
would undoubtably save his life.&nbsp; His mother fought for the doctors
to give them the transfusion right then and there, but the doctors refused,
saying he was too young (remember this is in the 1980's).</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately, the little boy never made it to his seventh birthday.&nbsp;
He died two weeks before.</B>
<BR><B>After his death, his mom went numb.&nbsp; She spent all her free
time at his grave, neglecting her other two children.&nbsp; Her marriage
became strained and soon after the boy's death his dad filed for divorce.&nbsp;
Not knowning what to do, she called the pastor of her parish and asked
for his help.&nbsp; The pastor went over and immediately felt a very sad
presence, and said that her constant mourning did not let the little boy
rest, and that his soul was trapped in this house.&nbsp; The crying we
heard was his way of telling his mom to free his soul, which she had did
not want to let go.&nbsp; Until she gave in to the fact that the little
boy was gone, his soul would never have rest and would wander around her
house, crying.&nbsp; So little by little, she began to face reality.&nbsp;
Her son may have been gone, but she wasn't going to forget him, and she
also had two more sons to care for.&nbsp; She began going to his grave
only once a month, until one night when she dreamed about him.&nbsp; Then
she knew he had made it to the otherside.</B>
<BR><B>My aunt said that after she stopped mourning him so much, the crying
stopped.</B>
<BR><B>But sometimes, on a real quiet night, if you listen hard enough,
you can still hear his crying.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dbehr@klodt.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story did not happen to me, but to a very good friend.&nbsp;
I'll change names to keep his confidentiality.&nbsp; Andy and I graduated
highschool together a few years ago.&nbsp; I believe it was our junior
year that his mom passed away.&nbsp; I've never heard the story directly
from Andy, his girlfriend told me a few years later.</B>
<BR><B>Andy and his girlfriend Jen met and began dating.&nbsp; When Andy's
mom fell ill, Jen was there thoughout the whole thing.&nbsp; Andy and I
graduated together and Jen a year before us.&nbsp; One day, after school
during our senior year, Andy and Jen were hanging out at his house.&nbsp;
They were both worn out from the day, Jen from working and Andy from school.&nbsp;
They decided, since nobody was home to bother them, to lay down and take
a nap.&nbsp; Throughout Andy's house was an intercom system that had never
worked, from the day they moved in.&nbsp; Andy's room was upstairs.&nbsp;
As was the room his father (and late mother) slept in.&nbsp; Andy and Jen
had been sleeping lightly for about 20 minutes when they both were awoken
by soft music.&nbsp; It was a familiar tune for Andy, but he couldn't put
his finger on it.&nbsp; They lay there, sleepily wondering where it was
coming from when Andy got up and pointed at the intercom speaker in his
room.&nbsp; He was a little creeped out, as it has never worked in the
past.&nbsp; He walked out of his room, Jen following behind, to investigate
where the music was coming from.&nbsp; As he walked by his father's room,
his question was answered.&nbsp; There on his dad's dresser, was his late
mother's jewelry box, wide open, playing the soft music they could hear
throughout the house.&nbsp; Andy stood there, paralyzed, wondering first,
who could have wound up and opened the box, and second, why did the intercom
system suddenly work.&nbsp; As the reality of what happened set in, andy
shut the box, silencing the eerie music.&nbsp; Jen said he was ghostly
white.&nbsp; The two of them grabbed their coats and ran out of the house.&nbsp;
Andy stayed at Jen's that night, but returned home the next day.&nbsp;
Nothing like that ever happened again, and andy never really talked about
it.&nbsp; It seems to me that his mother was saying hi, and maybe that's
why andy wasn't afraid after that night.&nbsp; He knew his mom was still
near.</B>

<P><B>Poor Woman</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: ally_cat_meow@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm from Newfoundland and my ancestors are from out ports all along
the</B>
<BR><B>Northern coast.When I was about 10 years old, I would spent my summer
at</B>
<BR><B>my grandma's and grandpa's house. There was always something to
do, but</B>
<BR><B>what interested me the most was the idea of resettlement in outpost</B>
<BR><B>Newfoundland in the the early 20th century. Many families were forced
to</B>
<BR><B>leave their homes, fishing grounds and family grave plots (which
was the</B>
<BR><B>hardest thing to do, as family is very important in Newfoundland).</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, my grandpa was forced to leave his home of King's cove,
when he</B>
<BR><B>was only 15 years old. He remembers the day they left and how everyone</B>
<BR><B>was in the cemetery saying their last good byes to their loved ones.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, one day we decided that we'd go camping and
pitched a tent on</B>
<BR><B>the beach in King's Cove (only a 15 min boat ride from his existing</B>
<BR><B>house). That evening was filled with fun! We went swimming and fishing</B>
<BR><B>and took a walk along the road he traveled everyday to go to school.
He</B>
<BR><B>told me of a 14 year old girl&nbsp; who lived by herself&nbsp; after
her husband</B>
<BR><B>died of TB. She was 7 months pregnant, was looked down upon in the
town</B>
<BR><B>and tried to hide her pregnancy, and had no way of an income. So,
one</B>
<BR><B>fateful night, over a&nbsp; half a century ago, she went to the
main fishing</B>
<BR><B>house and hung herself from a beam, her body found the next morning
by</B>
<BR><B>the merchant when he arrived for work.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night all I could only think about the poor
woman. But surely,</B>
<BR><B>I slowly fell asleep and drifted into dreams. But suddenly in the
middle</B>
<BR><B>of the night, I awoke to the sound of crying. At first, my first</B>
<BR><B>reaction was to wake up grandpa, but, being a typical 10 year old,
I</B>
<BR><B>wanted to investigate myself. I slipped on my sneakers and opened
the</B>
<BR><B>tent door. The crying persisted, and I followed the sound till I
reached</B>
<BR><B>the cove head, and there standing was a beautiful woman with a child
in</B>
<BR><B>her arms. I started to step closer, but, when she turned around,
I saw a</B>
<BR><B>mangled face, torn and scratched, her hair scraggly and dirty. She</B>
<BR><B>screamed at me in rage and of defense of her child. In a panic,
I ran</B>
<BR><B>back to the tent in crawled in my grandpa's sleeping bag crying.
That</B>
<BR><B>was by far the scariest experience I've ever encountered in my live.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Undead and Death Shadows</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: redthunder_80@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Where do I begin.... I have seen many things in my</B>
<BR><B>life...it all started when I was only 6 years old. I</B>
<BR><B>remember this occurence like it was yesterday, being</B>
<BR><B>my first sighting, it is hard to forget.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My family and I had lived in a small house in San</B>
<BR><B>Bernandino CA, located at 777 West 18th st. I had</B>
<BR><B>never believed in ghosts before, being only 5 years</B>
<BR><B>old, I didnt much care about the supernatural. I was a</B>
<BR><B>very intelligent kid, who was always reading books,</B>
<BR><B>especially on ghost stories and stories of aliens!</B>
<BR><B>Anyways, back to the first sighting.... one night</B>
<BR><B>after i was playing in my room, our mother came in and</B>
<BR><B>told us to stop opening the attic door. Being half</B>
<BR><B>asleep, I just said ok mom. well later on that night,</B>
<BR><B>I was jolted from my sleep by my mother yelling at me</B>
<BR><B>to not to open the attic door! I yelled back at her</B>
<BR><B>telling her that i wasnt doing anything, and started</B>
<BR><B>to go back to sleep. Just then the light came on and</B>
<BR><B>in walked my mother(looking like she had just woke</B>
<BR><B>up), and said to me, what are you yelling about? did</B>
<BR><B>you have a nightmare?. I looked at my mother and said</B>
<BR><B>to her, i wasnt playing with the attic door. She</B>
<BR><B>looked at me and said what are you talking about? She</B>
<BR><B>said, go back to sleep, you have to get up in 5 hours.</B>
<BR><B>I said ok mom, and went back to sleep. Once again I</B>
<BR><B>was jolted from my sleep by the same voice yelling the</B>
<BR><B>same thing. I stayed awake for a little while longer,</B>
<BR><B>hoping to hear the voice again, and maybe find out</B>
<BR><B>what the hell was going on. I remember this</B>
<BR><B>clearly.... I just started to drift to sleep, when i</B>
<BR><B>heard what sounded like someone had opened an old</B>
<BR><B>creaky door! I layed where i was at, and turned my</B>
<BR><B>head slightly to see a woman who looked to be a young</B>
<BR><B>mother, who appeared to be yelling at or scolding</B>
<BR><B>(with no words), a young boy who looked to be about my</B>
<BR><B>age. Being my first occurence with something like</B>
<BR><B>this, i sreamed like hell for my mother. She ran into</B>
<BR><B>the room with a baseball bat swinging for a few</B>
<BR><B>seconds, thinking maybe someone was there. She turned</B>
<BR><B>on the light, and said she could swear it sounded like</B>
<BR><B>i was yelling like someone was killing me. She asked</B>
<BR><B>me why i was screaming, and waited for an answer. As i</B>
<BR><B>told her about what i had seen, she became very angry,</B>
<BR><B>and said it was all my imagination, she then told me</B>
<BR><B>to go back to bed, and calmly(not yelling, but</B>
<BR><B>cursing) walked back into her room. The next night i</B>
<BR><B>had the same occurence, only this time i was not</B>
<BR><B>frightened. This time i wanted to see it all, i was</B>
<BR><B>eager to find out who they were, and why they were</B>
<BR><B>here. After i had seen the mother scolding her son,</B>
<BR><B>they dissapeared, just like the night before. I was a</B>
<BR><B>little upset, but decided to go back to sleep. I woke</B>
<BR><B>up suddenly, and looked to my left side of the bed,</B>
<BR><B>and saw a little black puppy playing on the floor. I</B>
<BR><B>watched as the little puppy played, and was shocked</B>
<BR><B>when i saw the little boy enter the room and start</B>
<BR><B>playing with the puppy. Only a few minutes had passed,</B>
<BR><B>before they dissapeared, and i went back to sleep,</B>
<BR><B>figuring it was the last i would see of this. Yet</B>
<BR><B>again i was jolted from my sleep, to see the familiar</B>
<BR><B>little boy, and puppy, playing underneath the attic</B>
<BR><B>access. They seemed happy, and were having a great</B>
<BR><B>time, when the little boy decided to get a chair, and</B>
<BR><B>open the attic door. As he grabbed the cord, i had</B>
<BR><B>this weird feeling wash over me, as if something bad</B>
<BR><B>was going to happen. I eagerly watched, and as the boy</B>
<BR><B>pulled the string, i saw all kinds oh heavy things</B>
<BR><B>come crashing down on the boy and his puppy(no sound</B>
<BR><B>whatsoever). Then i saw the woman come rushing in, she</B>
<BR><B>appeared to be screaming, and crying, as she grabbed</B>
<BR><B>her little boy up into her arms. The boys head was</B>
<BR><B>crushed from what i could tell, and i will never</B>
<BR><B>forget the sickness i felt in my stomache. They</B>
<BR><B>dissapeared, and i had no occurence for a couple of</B>
<BR><B>years. I was now 8 years old, and my sister(who was</B>
<BR><B>only a year old at the first sightings), was now 3</B>
<BR><B>years old, and sharing a room with me. We were both</B>
<BR><B>asleep, and i woke to hear my sister talking to</B>
<BR><B>someone. I looked down and said to my sister, who are</B>
<BR><B>you talking to?. She did not answer, as if she didnt</B>
<BR><B>hear me, so i jumped down off of the top bunk, a</B>
<BR><B>looked at her, and she was sound asleep! I shook her</B>
<BR><B>awake, and told her to stop talking to herself, then</B>
<BR><B>hopped back up into the top bunk and went back to</B>
<BR><B>sleep. I woke again to what sounded like cries from my</B>
<BR><B>mother(like sad cries), i immediately knew who it was,</B>
<BR><B>and i just turned to see that familiar woman standing</B>
<BR><B>by the same spot where her child was crushed, looking</B>
<BR><B>directly at me. All i heard was, stay away from the</B>
<BR><B>attic.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My second occurence was when i was 22 years old. I</B>
<BR><B>have studied martial arts for awhile, and i love to</B>
<BR><B>read ghost stories and supernatural stories. I would</B>
<BR><B>like to say i have no fear, but i would be lying if i</B>
<BR><B>said that this occurence didnt scare me. It was a</B>
<BR><B>friday night, and i got off of work late. I began</B>
<BR><B>walking home(i had no car) through the shopping center</B>
<BR><B>where i worked, which had some of the brightest lights</B>
<BR><B>in all of Waldorf MD. My cell phone rang, and it was</B>
<BR><B>one of my best friends ( who i referred to as a little</B>
<BR><B>sister)who was living with me at the time. She had</B>
<BR><B>told me she had a terrible feeling, and wondered when</B>
<BR><B>i would be home. I told her i was only about 15</B>
<BR><B>minutes away, and that i was supposed to be going</B>
<BR><B>somewhere tonight. At this point my phone began to</B>
<BR><B>break up a little, so i stopped where i was, and began</B>
<BR><B>to finish our conversation. As we were talking, i</B>
<BR><B>noticed that my shadow was awfully big, and on the</B>
<BR><B>wrong side of my body! Being that i just got off of</B>
<BR><B>work, and being tired, i thought nothing of it. I</B>
<BR><B>finished talking to my friend, and continued walking</B>
<BR><B>home. My phone rang again, and it was my friend. I</B>
<BR><B>said what do you want, i am like 10 minutes from home!</B>
<BR><B>She said she got that feeling again, like something</B>
<BR><B>bad was going to happen to me. I told her she was</B>
<BR><B>crazy, and as i began to tell her not to worry, i</B>
<BR><B>would be home in 10 nminutes, i noticed my shadow</B>
<BR><B>again, only.. there were no lights where i was at!! I</B>
<BR><B>began to get a little freaked out, and just began</B>
<BR><B>staring at my shadow, as if i could not move from that</B>
<BR><B>spot! Just then a car came, and drove right through my</B>
<BR><B>shadow, as it did, i noticed that the shadow did not</B>
<BR><B>dissapear, and i got this really cold chill when the</B>
<BR><B>car passed. I told my friend what was happening, and</B>
<BR><B>began to walk home really, really fast. As i turned</B>
<BR><B>onto the road conecting to my street, i was still</B>
<BR><B>telling her what i had seen. Just as i began to cross</B>
<BR><B>the street, I saw that shadow again, only this time it</B>
<BR><B>was moving away from me, as if it were running down</B>
<BR><B>the middle of the road! I told my friend what i had</B>
<BR><B>seen, and began to follow the shadow, until i had</B>
<BR><B>reached my street. My house was directly at the end of</B>
<BR><B>the street(literally in a straight line from me), and</B>
<BR><B>as i rounded the corner, i watched in horror as the</B>
<BR><B>shadow i had been following, moved directly towards my</B>
<BR><B>house, and dissapeared in the light at the front</B>
<BR><B>porch. I was still on the phone with my friend, and</B>
<BR><B>told her to come outside right away, and told her what</B>
<BR><B>i had seen. I hung up the phone, and continued</B>
<BR><B>walking, and saw her come running out of the house at</B>
<BR><B>such a fevered pace, that she nearly ran past me. She</B>
<BR><B>was pale and looked as if she were sick to her</B>
<BR><B>stomache, and could barely utter a word. I asked her</B>
<BR><B>what was wrong, and she told me as she opened the door</B>
<BR><B>to our room, she saw a rather large shadowlike cloud</B>
<BR><B>in front of the doorway that seemed to go down the</B>
<BR><B>hall and dissapear. We both went into the house</B>
<BR><B>together, both of us scared beyond all belief, and</B>
<BR><B>went straight to our room. we began talking about what</B>
<BR><B>took place, and no sooner had she said that it</B>
<BR><B>dissapeard in the hallway, that my dog in the back</B>
<BR><B>yard started barking like someone was back there. We</B>
<BR><B>heard loud footsteps like someone was on the</B>
<BR><B>roof,(then as my dog folled barking the whole time)the</B>
<BR><B>footsteps on the roof stopped, and we heard a loud</B>
<BR><B>crash into the chain link fence just outside my</B>
<BR><B>window. As we both looked out the window, we saw my</B>
<BR><B>dog just arrive at the fence, barking and growling! I</B>
<BR><B>peered through the window, and could not see anything</B>
<BR><B>because of the light being on in our room, so i told</B>
<BR><B>my friend to turn off the light. No sooner had she</B>
<BR><B>turned off the light, is when i saw what appeared to</B>
<BR><B>be a very large man standing in all black, right next</B>
<BR><B>to our fence, and next to our neighbors shed! I told</B>
<BR><B>my frind to call the police, and grabbed a small</B>
<BR><B>baseball bat(novelty bat about 6 inches long)and ran</B>
<BR><B>oout the front door. As i got out the front door, my</B>
<BR><B>friend followed with my cell phone, on the phone with</B>
<BR><B>the dispatcher for the charles county sheriffs office.</B>
<BR><B>I cautiosly walked to the side yard where i had seen</B>
<BR><B>the figure, with my friend just behind me, and peered</B>
<BR><B>through the darkness towards our neighbors shed. I</B>
<BR><B>told her to stay there, and began to slowly walk</B>
<BR><B>towards the shed. As i did, the figure took off</B>
<BR><B>towards the back of our neighbors house and towards</B>
<BR><B>his neighbors fence! So i did what i thought was the</B>
<BR><B>right thing and gave chase. As i rounded the corner of</B>
<BR><B>our neighbors house, i saw the figure approaching the</B>
<BR><B>fence, the fence made a sound like someone was</B>
<BR><B>climbing it, but there was nothing there(the yard next</B>
<BR><B>to our neighbors yard was well lit). As i ran around</B>
<BR><B>to the front of the house, where my friend had run to</B>
<BR><B>when we saw the figure run, she was explaining all of</B>
<BR><B>this in a frantic fashion to the dispatcher. I began</B>
<BR><B>to walk down the center of the street, as the police</B>
<BR><B>cars pulled up, and told them which direction he or it</B>
<BR><B>had headed. The officers checked the area, and came</B>
<BR><B>back with nothing. One officer stayed and began to</B>
<BR><B>talk to us, and as i explained what i had seen</B>
<BR><B>throughout the night, told me that he had seen a weird</B>
<BR><B>shadow cast on the side of a house, that he just</B>
<BR><B>assumed was the lighting when he drove by it. To this</B>
<BR><B>day, we have never figured out what really took place,</B>
<BR><B>and rarely ever talk about it. Every once in a while i</B>
<BR><B>will see an ominous shadow lurking about, but i show</B>
<BR><B>it no fear, and go about my buisness!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;This last occurence may seem funny, but i assure you</B>
<BR><B>it is real! I am now 24, about to turn 25 years old,</B>
<BR><B>and i am often visited by the ghost of a clown!! It is</B>
<BR><B>really quite weird, i have never seen any clowns or</B>
<BR><B>been a part of a party involving a clown, but i will</B>
<BR><B>often awake to the sound of a bicycle horn, or the</B>
<BR><B>squeeking of a nose!!! (i still find it hard to</B>
<BR><B>believe sometimes)The only time i have actually seen</B>
<BR><B>the clown, is when i had just finished checking my</B>
<BR><B>email, and was about to go to bed. I was home alone,</B>
<BR><B>and my roommates were out partying. I walked into my</B>
<BR><B>room, and looked at my waterbed, to find what appeared</B>
<BR><B>to be a ballon animal on my bed! As soon as i</B>
<BR><B>approached it, our dogs began barking feverishly, and</B>
<BR><B>ran downstairs. Naturally i went downstairs to see</B>
<BR><B>what was going on, and all of the dogs were huddled</B>
<BR><B>together, cowering under the table. I called them</B>
<BR><B>cowards and went back upstairs, but as i hit the top</B>
<BR><B>step, i looked and saw the funnyiest looking clown i</B>
<BR><B>had ever seen. All he did was squeek his horn and go</B>
<BR><B>into my room, where i followed, and he was gone!! That</B>
<BR><B>happened about 2 weeks ago, and last night i heard the</B>
<BR><B>same old noises, only this time one of my roommates</B>
<BR><B>was home. I went into the hall to see if my roomate</B>
<BR><B>was there, but found that he and his girlfriend were</B>
<BR><B>sound asleep. I dont feel threatened at all by this</B>
<BR><B>clown ghost, and i actually think he just maybe a</B>
<BR><B>playful spirit,</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Upstairs</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lechelerj@blue-ridge.navy.mil</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; This is kindof trippy to me but this is a real experience
that i just had</B>
<BR><B>when i was home on leave in Palestine, illinois.&nbsp; My fiance's
room is the</B>
<BR><B>upstairs of an old house that is built in the middle of the town
park.&nbsp; Late</B>
<BR><B>at night when we would be up talking and stuff, the radio would
just for no</B>
<BR><B>reason turn up really loud and one of us would have to get up to
go turn it</B>
<BR><B>down but as soon as we would get right up in front of it, the volume
would</B>
<BR><B>turn back down to where it was.&nbsp; She also has an alarm clock
that WE never</B>
<BR><B>set that would go off&nbsp; when ever it feels like it, usually
three or four in</B>
<BR><B>the mourning, sometimes even eight at night.&nbsp; We were just
laying on her</B>
<BR><B>couch one night and looked over by the top of the stairs which leads
down to</B>
<BR><B>her living room and both of US had chills run through our bodies
and we both</B>
<BR><B>claim to have seen the same shadowy figure just standing there looking
at</B>
<BR><B>us.&nbsp; We often have the feeling of something watching US.&nbsp;
Niether one of US</B>
<BR><B>is scared of this presence but its not exactly a comfortable feeling
to feel</B>
<BR><B>like your being watched all the time, and the disturbances get annoying
too.</B>
<BR><B>We are just going to deal with it though because it doesnt intend
US any</B>
<BR><B>harm.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.</B>

My grandma couldnt sleep so she sat up on her bed staring out into the
dining room. Suddenly joey appeared he just stood there and smiled. My
grand mother began to cry and thought she was dreaming. she closed her
eyes and counted to ten and when she opened them he was still there. he
simply said "thankyou" he stood there and smiled when my grandmother got
up to hug him and talk to him he vanished. No one believed her but to this
day she swears that she saw him. I believe her.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes at night i would here creaky downstairs near my grandmas
room when she wasnt home. Sometimes the hallway light would suddenly turn
on.</B>
<BR><B>One thing i remeber my friends heather and i were playing with a
quija bored in the basement of the house. At the time i was around 13.
when we asked to contact any spirits then courser began to move it simply

<P><B>Not Very Scary</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: marshaarmywife@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Teri Bourquin, im now 18 years old and very used to
ghosts becuase of what happened 4 years earlier about the time i turned
14 after my birthday party. My story begins when we moved into this house
and everything was fine until i stepped that first step into the house,
i didnt tell anyone because i didnt want them to think i was a freak. My
room that my parents gave me use very unsual because the carpet was white
and there was red stains that looked not like that they were not from paint.
Then about 4 months after we moved in i was just getting use to the house
and feeling very compfortable when i heard a little girls voice coming
form the dining room that was just beside my room. I pused it off and went
on my way, thinking it was just me losing my mind and thought it might
be the tv. The next weekend i had my two best frineds over and my parents
hadnt come home yet from work. We were on the porch talking about what
and who we could see that night at the football game and just girl talks,
When the front door shut locking us out of the house. We thinking it was
the wind got the dining room window opened. As soon as my friend cindy
got inside out away from the window it shut and the glass broke. We went
into my room thinking what was going on and how was i going to explain
the window to my mom. We then decide to just sit in my room and listin
to the radio when we heard the little girl giggle in the dining room and
heard foot steps in the living room my two friends ran outside after they
fought with the door trying to get the lock to open and i went to get my
moms dog from the kitchen because she was crying like she has never done
before.When i gave the dog to my best friend the door shut which left me
inside and wouldnt let me out. I then went to the window that was broken
in the dining room and the window was fixed!!!!!!!!! I then was scared
for my life, i didnt know what to do when i heard the little girl again.
I screamed for her and told her to let my out of the damn house and to
leave me alone including my family and anyone near me. I then heard gun
shots and alot of screaming and then just like that my friends came into
the house and everything was quiet again. From that day one nothing happened
and i did some research on the house and found out the a family once lived
their and the dad came home on night drunk and shot his wife and his little
girl and then hung himself in the garage. This was back in the 1900's and
nothing was told to anyone that lived their. I hope u liked this story
i know its not scary but put urself in my shoes and just think of how u
would have felt.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dans050247@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>about three months ago,I sent a very true story that happened to
me in pleasantville new jersey about the happenings at the old CUTHBERT
MANSION on the corner of main street and glendale avenue.you accepted it
and put the story in your timelines already,but I cannot remember the number
you put it in-I am guessing.but that would not be right where it is.if
you have a way of looking under any stories that took place in the summertime
of the early 1960's(1960--1962) ,you will find it.the house as incredible
as it was to see inside .was definitly built for a very wealthy family
before the civil war began consisted of seven bedrroms,five bathrooms,two
dinning rooms,two staircases,chandeliers hung throughout the huge mansion.it
was a two story mansion.had a very huge basement with some kind of a passage
way leading upwards behind the walls,remember I was a thirteen year old
boy and my younger brother was twelve.it seems these passage ways ran all
over the huge house,when it was for sale in th eearly 1960's,it sat on
the market for a lot of years,my uncle and aunt even called the realtor
about it and was taken thru it,it wa sfor sale at a price of $60,000 back
then,I understand from my grandmother that in about 1965,it was a functioning
retirement home and had caught fire and killed a lot of people inside it.when
I was along with my brother and two other friends snooping thru the house,up
in th every huge attic,I was the only one that wanted to spend time there
as next to one wall near the chimney,there was an old stack of "leatherneck
magizines" with dates on them from the late 1940's and early 1950's.when
I was about to leave as I was alone,something made the pages flip thru
very quickly and there was "no wind or breeze up there",the pages stopped
at pictures of "very famous battle scences durring world wars one,world
world two and the korean war.I was very shaken and could not get out of
the attic fast enough,telling my accounts to my brother ,pat and our two
friends,they just laughed at me.more about the house: it had real shudders
on the windows,built-in light sockets for xmas lights.chandaliers looked
like they had been made in europe as they were very fancy,no carpeting
or furniture in the house,in one huge dining room,inside a built-in cabinet
for china and dishes,we had found a "revolving shelf" that led thru the
what seemed like "secret passage ways".this huge mansion was definitely
built for a very wealthy family around 1859-1860 according to my uncle
and aunt from info from the realtor.the roof on it was made of green slate,the
house had very huge exterior wall slats all painted in white,the shutters
were painted white also,the brick around th efoundation was painted red.it
wa son a huge lot and it consisted of a very big garage with some old car
parts(pre-ww1 era) and parts for old wagons similar to horse drawn buggies.in
th eattic of the garage which was very big and had an skylight which we
had opened&nbsp; because it was hot,stood stacked more than forty old paintings.I
remember taking only one called "victor of the glen".other buildings on
the lot included a huge walk-in area for a kennel club with old pictures
of champion dogs looking like cocker spanials,there were two huge fountains
in the yard filled dirty water,each fountain was about twenty-five feet
in diameter,at the rear of the property was a very huge hen house and it
smelled in there as looked like it was about the sam elegth as the garage-about
seventyfive feet to my recolletion.there was also five huge birdhouses
or purple martin houses sitting on top of very huge pipes and these were
built to look like the huge mansion.all outbuildings were painted similar
to the mansion.there were very huge trees on the lot and a wood-covered
semi-awning covering the driveway.in the basement along with a lot of old
automobile parts which I had described to my grandfather was an old standard
oil company hand oil pump used for cleaning old car parts,these car parts
according to my grandfather as I described to him came from either "old
rolls royces or puegots" and from the 1920's era.the three storys I sent
to you previously on this weekend actually happened in my lifetime and
I am talking of the buried veterans at point loma lighthouse when I was
drunk along with three other marines outside of camp pendleton calif in
1966 and we had called a cab to hurry back and tell the other marines and
got one hell of a ribbing about it.the occasions here at huntington beach
that occurred shortly after the dec 7,1941 attack also took place and only
the contractors and older people in this area know of the story of the
eleven year old boy accidently killed by a marine from a machine gunners
nest near the bolsa chica wetlands happened as a result there was a lights-out
situation and no-smoking-lamps-lit policy in force and finally the story
where I used to work for northrop corp at pico revera califonia where the
b-2 bombers were developed and previously and old ford plant where an employee
bled to death in the underground tunnel leading to the first-aid station
actually happened and the story was shared by only northrop employees(in
the thousands) and if you joked about it around a northrop security guard,an
employee could be called in for questioning about the matter as only northrop
security was allowed in those tunnels under the very huge northrop complex
building belonging to the united states air force,first few bombers were
actually built inside the building to give you an idea of the deminsions
of the building.if you would like some more audience for your website.can
I suggest the coast to coast radio station with george norary as hw had
a guest writer on about the book called "the hauntings of the presidents"</B>

<P><B>Ghost Cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: selig10@juno.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>One day I was outside in my backyard, walking by a big old tree bordering</B>
<BR><B>our neighbor's property. Sitting at the base of the tree was a cat.
At</B>
<BR><B>that moment I thought it was our cat, Alex, so I greeted him. He
looked a</B>
<BR><B>little pale, but I didn't really notice that.</B>
<BR><B>I turned back to go inside. Whan I opened the backdoor, Alex was
sitting</B>
<BR><B>on the floor, eating. A shock ran through my body. That was not
a living</B>
<BR><B>cat outside.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Ghost of Mrs Henneman.....</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; malc2112@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; This story took place some time in 1991.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My cousin and I rented a half of an old house in Ocean Grove,
NJ. My room was in the front of the house and would have once been someones
livingroom.&nbsp; There were french doors leading from my room to the rest
of the house.At one time these doors would have swung freely...in the days
before wall to wall carpet. The hardwood floors beneath had been covered
over thus the doors made a distinct "woosh " sound when opened.That sound
was the door "sweeping" across the carpet.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I was not alone that night. My cousin was fast asleep in the
next room.Plus, we had another male guest (freeloader) over that night
but he was passed out too, even further away from where my room was.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Well...I lay in my bed....on my back ,just staring stright
ahead.Which gives me a perfect view of the french doors which I had closed.
All of a sudden I hear and see one of the doors open!Then I saw a dark
figure of a woman lean in and look directly over at me! I couldn't make
out any details only a dark shadowy outline. She was only about ten feet
away from me.I was looking straight at her....it did not alarm me...and
I was just thinking in my mind.. "Yes? What's up?"</B>

<P><B>By: owenleverett@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I grew up in a house near Murphy Candler Park (about a mile from
Perimeter Mall in the Atlanta area). At about 1:00 am I would hear footsteps
in the upstairs hallway. The floor made a distinctive squeaking noise when
you walked on it. I had gone as far as to wake up my parents and brother
to see if anyone had been walking in the hall. My brother had night terrors
for a few years also. No one would stay in the dirt crawl for more than
a few minutes. You would get a really eerie feeling and an unmistakable
urge to get the &amp;*#$ out! Nobody had ever died there, but the previous
owner's son had cancer when they moved out (I never knew if he survived).</B>
<BR><B>More recently, shortly after my grandmother's death (about 15 years
ago) she had been seen twice. Once by a friends' girfriends' son who stayed
for a few nights. He would state that he was scared of the old lady. He
was about 4 at the time. A few weeks later my brother was having band practice
in the basement and one of the band members asked who the lady upstairs
was. No women were present that day. We lived in the house for about 10
years. Almost everyone on the street has had a divorce. The property is
located on an old slave plantation between Suwanee and Duluth. There are
2 adjacent cemetaries at the end of the road. One for slaves and current
family, the other for the masters who have no surviving family. Contact
me if you wish to be taken to the cemetary. I live in Duluth which is only
about 15 minutes away. I know of one person who's car died when he pulled
in one night, but it has seemed peaceful otherwise. I have not taken photos
there, but am considerring going there soon to see if anything shows up.</B>

<P><B>Haunted spa in Toronto</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jodii66@sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>For two years, I worked as a makeup artist in Mira Linder Spa in
Toronto, On. Having had experiences with ghosts in my family home growing
up, what I saw and heard in the spa didn't bother me.</B>
<BR><B>When I first got the job in the spa, one of the spa owners, John
Alexander, was sick and hospitalized. He died soonafter and the spa was
left to his wife and two daughters. When the spa was closing at night,
I was to clean the upstairs floor where John's office was located. The
door was always closed, but I often heard a man's voice from inside, sounding
like he was arguing on the phone (John was not known for his kindness).</B>
<BR><B>If that wasn't enough, one night I was shutting down the second
floor when I saw in the mirror of one of the treatment room a little girl
in a pinnaphor run by laughing. The next day on the same floor, I saw a
little boy, peeking around a corner like he was playing hide and go seek,
in the same area, in the same old clothing. I told one of the guys that
closed with me nd he said he has seen them as well and was glad he wasn't
crazy. I found out later that the house, built in the 1800s, was once a
children's bookstore.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Haunted House in Amana</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: teresa_smith83@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My best friend's family helped to found the Amana's some seven generations
back, and their home is teaming with spirits.The most noisy of the spirits
is a man by the name of Fry. His family lived in the house probably in
the fifties. He committed suicide in the room my friend slept in. At night
my friend's mother hears him walking up and down the stairs, opening doors.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I have seen the spirit of what would have been my friend's
great-uncle. At age six while playing near the family car, his head was
crushed under the back wheel, he died instantly.I was living in their home
for a short time, and one morning while eating breakfast I saw the little
boy out of the corner of my eye- thinking it was her little brother joking
around I went to sneak up on him, by going around the the hall into the
room. But no one was down stairs at all. And my friends little brother
was sleeping. Thats when I was let in on the story of this ghost. Apparently,this
ghost has gotten stronger, as since my friend has moved out and gotten
married, and I don't see her family very often. Her mother was telling
me the other day that lately the kids in the neighborhood have asked to
played with her son. She would say [son's name] was gone(at boy scouts
or something) and they would say "No, not [son's name] the blonde boy."
(who is the ghost of the great-uncle.)</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Finally the ghost with a sense of humor, Great-grandma. I
met the funny lady when she was alive. For instance, I slept in the basement
apartment in their house. I spent nearly an hour putting my hair in rollers
for some school thing . I went to bed -hair securely</B>
<BR><B>rolled. I remember thinking my friend was talking to me while I
slept, and for some reason poking me in the ear. Next morning I awoke-
curlers all across the room, even under the bed - and dryer lint in my
ear. I went to go dump ice water on my friend when I realized I had locked
my door from the inside. So I put my hair in a bun and went to school.When
I got home my friend and I made chocolate pudding and got out the video
camera to make our own cooking show. While I made faces at the camera squeezing
pudding out of my teeth something yanked my hair, hard. I stopped, my friend
asked what was wrong- the my bun pin came out of my hair stayed in the
air then flew across the room. All on video!!!</B>
<BR><B>Her mother said it was definitely the work of grandma.</B>
<BR><B>there are about fifty other spirits roaming her halls. None of them
are harmful, you get used to sharing a bathroom with five people you can't
see.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Since I Was Young</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Alyxe8@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have felt spirits since I was a child.&nbsp; My entire life I have
always been afraid to be alone.&nbsp; I don't so much see them as I do
sense them.&nbsp; I didn't believe it until I was 21 years old and had
an experience that frightened me so much that I had to leave my house.
I had always been frightened in&nbsp; the house that my husband&nbsp; sonand
I lived in at the time.&nbsp; My husband worked midnights and in the middle
of the night I could hear footsteps when there was no one else there bet
my sleeping two year old.&nbsp; The hair on the back of my neck would stand
up.&nbsp; I was sure someone was there.&nbsp; There was a drop ceiling
and I would hear what sounded like someone tapping on it.&nbsp; I even
had my husband remove tiles to see if an animal was up there.&nbsp; Then
one night I was standing in my kitchen washing dishes, my husband was outside
working on a car and my son was asleep in the bedroom next to the kitchen,
where I was at.&nbsp; All of a sudden the hair on the back of my neck stood
up and I could hear someone running from the living room into the kitchen
where I was.&nbsp; I whirled around to see who It was, but no one was there.&nbsp;
I then felt cold air rush by me. I freaked out and ran from the house to
tell my husband what had happened.&nbsp; I was too scared to return to
the house, but eventually did.&nbsp; Afterwards when I told my mother what
had happened and that now I believed that everything I had always experienced(felling
a persons presence when no one was there) was really ghosts, She then told
me about when I was a child and would sit next to her and scoot closer
and point and say"I don't like them"&nbsp; she would then reply "who?"
and I would just say "Them".&nbsp; She says I used to scare her and that
she truly believes that I saw People that she couldn't.&nbsp; I rarely
ever actually see anything it's more like I Feel them and know that their
there.&nbsp; Some times I do see them though.&nbsp; And I am terrified.&nbsp;
I hate that feeling.&nbsp; I think that as a child i saw ghosts more often
because I was more open to it.&nbsp; Now I more or less try to ignore it
otherwise I am to scared to be alone</B>

<BR><B>Grandpa John</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jo011f0389@blueyonder.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was a child, growing up in Scotland, my Grandpa John lived
with us until I was about 11, then he went to live with my Aunty Madeline
and Uncle Henry as my sister Katherine had just been born and my mum and
dad needed the room.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I loved my Grandpa so much.&nbsp; To me he was the best
person that ever walked the face of the earth and I saw him every day.&nbsp;
He would come to the house about 10 a.m. every day and leave in the evening.&nbsp;
He was a big bear of a man, 6 feet tall and with a 54' chest, 21' neck,
weighing 20 stone.&nbsp; Anyway, he obviously had a very distinctive heavy
footstep that I used to recognise instantly coming into the house, going
through into the living room and then into the kitchen, where I would hear
him pottering about making my breakfast.</B>
<BR><B>When I was 21 and my sister was 10, Grandpa John died suddenly in
my mum's arms whilst sitting in the living room.&nbsp; We were all absolutely
devastated, my sister and me especially, but very shortly after he died
my sister and I started to hear strange noises.&nbsp; We would be in our
rooms and at about the time that Grandpa used to come down, we would hear
his distinctive, heavy footfall coming up the garden path.&nbsp; We would
then hear what sounded like his key fumbling in the lock and then him walking
through the house to the kitchen.&nbsp; Then we would hear him start to
potter about and the chair creaking as he pulled it out to sit on it.&nbsp;
We weren't frightened at all, just pleased that Grandpa still came to see
us.</B>
<BR><B>I have now left home but Katherine still stays at home and she hears
the noises still going on, 12 years later.&nbsp; Quite often when I'm at
mum's and go into the living room I'll smell Grandpa and my sister and
I also have this really realistic dream, always on the same night with
the same details that we go out into the back garden and my Grandpa is
standing there.&nbsp; He says to us that it's okay because he has come
home and he's not dead any more and I have been told my spiritualists on
3 occasions that I have an "large gentleman" standing behind me, and the
description fits him perfectly.</B>
<BR><B>So I dont't know, is it wishful thinking, or is Grandpa John keeping
an eye on his "little princesses?"</B><B></B>

<P><B>My House in Roxborough, Manayunk, PA</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Fallen_Angel_13MM@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>the house is over a hundred years old and full of ghosts. Seriously!
it used to be a house but in the 40' or 50's was split into 4 apartments.
i'm now 14, but we moved in when i was 4, into one of the second floor
apartments. we had one ghost named Mary who did nothing at all... you just
saw her shadow glide along the wall. When the family on the first floor
moved away, everything was fine until about 3 or 4 years later when i felt
like i was being watched in my bathroom. around that same time, we found
out that the father that lived downstairs shot himself in front of his
kids. He loved the house so he decided to come back (obviously). usually
people who commit suicide end up to be confused spirits (he was in my apartment
instead of the one on the first floor). He was always the nicest man, but
now, his spirit was very disturbing. i couldnt take a bath, go to the bathroom
or even brush my teeth alone in there. when i was home alone, if i had
to pee,i went in a glass and waited until my mom got home. my room was
next to the bathroom and we would leave the light on at night and every
night i would see a black shadow cross the doorway. i was so scared that
i would hide under the covers and scream for my mom and i ended up sleeping
with her. my CD player also acted weird, as did my cat. everytime i prayed,
the bathroom door would slam. i was so scared that i had my mom walk me
to the bathroom when i had to go at night. But one day, while i was in
the bath, i was relaxing when all of a sudden i hear a crash right next
to me and a sharp pain in my head. turns out, a glass bottle flew off the
window pane across the room and landed next to my head and lodged a chunk
of glass in my head. that was the last straw so my mom and i moved up to
the third floor apartment when i was 13. the couple that lived on the first
floor broke up, so the guy moved into our apartment (we didnt tell him
about the ghost). Ok, this guy is weird..ill tell you that now. well, it's
been about 7 months since we moved</B>
<BR><B>upstairs and everything's great in my mom's place. but i always
have the guy come upstairs and telling me about things he's seen. on his
first night in the apartment, he woke up to see a big guy standing over
him in bed. and just as recently as 2 weeks ago, he told me he was in the
bath(the house has the original tubs... no showers)and felt a prescence
behind him. when he turned around, he saw the guy and said he was really
livid looking. he was in work clothes and he said to the guy in a low voice
" Get the f*ck out of my house!" and dissapeared in front of him! I swear
it's all true and if you don't believe me, i have a picture of the bathroom
with a whispy thing in it... right in the spot where i felt the most uncomfortable
(OF COURSE it had to be right next to the toilet!) If you're looking for
the house, it's on ridge avenue, across from Speedy's in Roxborough/Manayunk.
if you do go, you might meet me and i can tell you all about the other
ghosts in the house. other than that, e-mail me at Fallen_Angel_13MM@hotmail.com.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Black Cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: brittany122585@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. My name is Brittany. I've always been facinated with ghosts and
the paranormal, but that's not why I'm writing. I have a story to tell
you about a mysterious black cat that roams around my apartment (we dont
have any cats...only a bird). My grandmother, father, and oldest sister
moved in to this appartment before I did. They moved in at least 10 years
ago. I moved in about 4 years ago. This used to be a house, which was later
separated to make two separate apartments. Anyways, sometimes my grandmother
(Whom passed away 2 years ago), my sister and I would talk about all the
ghosts and experiences that we have had in the past. The one that sticks
out most is this black cat that we have all seen, except for my father.
Before I moved in I would spend weekends here to visit. I used to sleep
on the couch whenever I stayed, but I remember always being a little scared.
If you sat on the right side of the couch, right next to the arm you could
see into the dining room. If you watched tv you could always see whatever
was going on. At first we couldnt figure out what this figure was. This
figure would run across the dining room but it would do it all night, always
going the same way. As the months progressed the figure would follow us
to different parts of the appartment. For a year it remained in my sisters
bedroom and this is when we figured out it was a cat. You could hear it
meowing at night in that room. Of course we could hear other cats outside
but this was not outside. It scared us but we always shrugged it off and
went about our lives, every now and then hearing it or seeing it. It wasnt
out to hurt us we knew that, but the thought of having a ghost cat scared
me. Four years ago I moved in. My grandmother moved to the sun-porch bedroom,
and my sister and I moved into my grandmothers bedroom because it was larger.
We could sense that the cat had followed us into that bedroom. Every night
almost we would wake up and hear its meowing. A few years pass, and my
sister is out more and more often but I still slept in that room by my
self. One night I went to turn off the light, just before it turned off
and was completley dark in the room I saw this black...transparent cat
with green eyes. It was looking right at me. I was scared but I continued
towards my bed and climbed up (it is a bunk bed). After that incident we
hadn't heard or seen the cat in a while. Every once in a while I will hear
it but I have never seen it. There have been other happenings in this apartment
but I don't have the time to tell them to you right now. Thanks for listening.
It always helps to talk.</B>

<P><B>The House I grew up in.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Msinardi81@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I grew up in an old house that we were told was built in the late
1920's. The</B>
<BR><B>first strange thing that happened was to my brother and his wife
who at that</B>
<BR><B>time were dating. The rest of the family was on vacation and my
brother had</B>
<BR><B>stayed home because he had just started a new job and couldn't take
time off.</B>
<BR><B>One night he and my sister-in-law went out to dinner and then went
to the house to feed the Dog and Cat. As they got in the car to leave,
the saw a flash of&nbsp; light in the house, that looked like a lighting
flash. They got out of the car and went back in the house, everything was
fine and they could find no reason for this flash. Another strange thing
was the handprint on one of the back bedroom windows, now matter how hard
you scrubbed, scraped or wiped that handprint would not go away. One day
my Mom was washing the window and it broke, after that my sister always
heard strange noises coming from the corner of the room where the window
was. My Grandmother also haunted the house after she died, she lived with
us for about 5 years before she died. She had trouble walking and always
wore slippers. Her bedroom was at the back of the house off the kitchen.
She had to go through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. Several times
after she died both my Mother and I (we were the closest one's to my grandmother)
heard her slippers scuffing across the kitchen floor just like they did
when she was alive. My grandmother always called my Mom "Mare", my mom's
name is</B>
<BR><B>Marion, several times after she died, again my Mother and I heard
her calling my Mom. My dad had two experiences in the house where he saw
an evil looking hooded figure once sitting on the couch and another time
standing in the room. Both times my dad would say "What in God's name do
you want" and the figure disappeared. Lastly when we moved out of the house
my brother was there alone one day and was standing in the livingroom near
one of the bedroom doors. The house only had window air conditioners and
they were already taken out. As my brother stood in the living room a icy
cold air passed right through him. This was in Florida in October and the
temperature was about 90 degrees. My brother</B>
<BR><B>was glad to finish what he was doing and leave the house. All of
these</B>
<BR><B>happenings are true.</B>

<P><B>By: DivaDancer082@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>We moved into the house we are currently living in now about 17
years ago. At first it was the perfect family house --or so we thought.
One night when my brother was in his room he heard a soft whisper of his
name..."Craig" ...it called to him. Thinking it was my mom he went out
to the living room and my mom was fast asleep on the couch! A few weeks
later my mom was out of the house and my brother was in his room. I came
downstairs to get something to drink and as i stood at the bottom of the
stairs i heard someone call MY name "Heather"...it said to me...I was scared!
I never wanted to tell anyone this from fear they may laugh at me but one
night me and my brother we sitting around talking and he told me his experience--i
had to tell him mine. At that time he told me that our mom told him that
she had also heard her name as well as my step dad. It hasnt happened in
awhile however. BUT, we still continue to "misplace" things only to go
searching in the same spots later and finding them there. One praticular
incident was my step dad's watch. He looked all over the room and so did
my mom.Only to find the watch under the bed where they had looked only
a couple hours earlier! When no one else is home i still here people walking
around upstairs and im too scared to go investigate.</B>
<BR><B>I got so scared one time i ran out of my house and wouldnt come
back until someone else came home!&nbsp; These experiences have led us
to believe that we are not the only ones living here!</B>

<P><B>Achill</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sue-allyson-doggies@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I have a story I just remembered and very much want it to be
posted up. This happended back in 1998, when I was 6. Im 12 now. My dog,
Achill, had died a while ago. My family all missed him. One night, I was
laying in bed, watching T.V. I had turned it off, and then the weird thing
happened: About 5 minutes later, I felt something jump up on my bed (you
know, when a dog jumps up on a bed like that feeling.) I looked around,
for&nbsp; my other two dogs, but no one was there. Thats when I said,
"Hi, Achill." After that, nothing really happened until 2002. (you can
read my other stories.) I think that was my dog, or Achill, just saying,
"Goodbye, I'll miss you." before going to Heaven.</B>

<P><B>Our Ghosts Come Back</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: deanbed@ntlworld.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Our house was built in 1948 in the grounds of the old Manor house,
Cardington Road, Bedford, England, (famous for the R101 Airship).</B>
<BR><B>There was a previous family here who have now passed on and we moved
here in 1977.</B>
<BR><B>There has constantly been small spooky goings on, shadows seen passing
the bedroom door accompanied by the creaking of floor boards, pictures
dropping off the stairs wall, my daughter often talking to someone she
saw in the bedroom, alarm clock constantly being unplugged, very annoying,
my 18 year old brother in law was sitting outside while baby sitting when
we got back from a night out, too frightened to go back in after hearing
noises.</B>
<BR><B>About 3.00am in 1998 I was woken with a start I looked straight
to the wifes side of the bed, she slept on the right side by the alarm
clock, and I saw a dark figure with a trilby hat and glasses heading for
the alarm clock, I got out of bed and sat up watching I shook myself knowing
I was awake, when he looked straight at me and he knew he had been caught,
he then disolved slowly right in front of me, It clicked that what I saw
was probably a ghost but I didn't have time to take that in and be frightened,
I am now a beleiver in ghosts and I am also not afraid to meet another.</B>
<BR><B>It is now 2003 and we have had no problems since that night, I ruined
his games, that was until about 3 months ago when we decided we would like
a mirror in the hallway firmly fixed it fell down and smashed a month later,
thats all very well these things do happen by accident, so I ignored it.</B>
<BR><B>A month ago I put up another mirror in its place and made sure this
would not come down by using a 5 strand strong wire, the day I wrote this
the mirror has just come off the wall and smashed, while trying to find
out what caused it, I found the wire has been cut cleanly in half it is
not the part that would touch the screw in the wall so it had not rubbed,
we have decided to not have a mirror there anymore, why smash the mirror?,
is it the same person responsible. I dunno perhaps I will ask if I ever
see this one.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Hey how's it goin'. Anyway I respect a lot of the people who share
their experiences because I know exactly what your talking about. All of
my life I had things happen to me. My Mom said it's some kind of gift I
have but I actually think it's some kind of a curse. The scariest thing
that has happened to me actually happened when I was at school. Everyone
knows not to go to the girls locker room by yourself but stupid me, I ended
up doing it. I remember that I got out of seventh period early so I went
the locker room to change for softball practice. right when I was finished
I was walking out when I heard the gate to the varsity locker room open.
I turned around like an idiot and saw a girl standing there. At first I
thought my mind was playing tricks on me but she started walking towards
me. I remember telling myself to run but my legs wouldn't move. She stopped
when she was about ten feet away from me and just stared at me. I looked
at the exit door and she said "Your not leaving" as corny as it sounds
she actually said that. She started walking closer and I started to back
up. Right when she was about two feet away, my coach walked in and she
was gone. My coach asked how I got in the locker room. I told her I knocked
on the door and she opened it for me. She told me she had been at the front
office all of seventh period and this was her first time back to her office.
To this day I don't know who that girl was but when I saw my coach she
said that she often hears somebody walking around I n the showers and opening
and closing the lockers, she also told me that time and time again she'll
look up from her desk and see a girl walk by the locker room window. So
any San Pasqual students, don't go into the girls locker room by yourself
OK!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: projectshadow316@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is the third time I have written to you.&nbsp; I just</B>
<BR><B>keep thinking of unusual things that have happened to</B>
<BR><B>me over the years.&nbsp; Well, I just thought of another</B>
<BR><B>one that happened in Junior High.</B>
<BR><B>We were playing afterschool Floor Hockey, one of my</B>
<BR><B>favorite sports.&nbsp; Our team crushed the opposition, and</B>
<BR><B>we were sitting on the bleachers.&nbsp; However, instead of</B>
<BR><B>laying them out so they form stairs, we had to climb</B>
<BR><B>them otherwise there wouldn't have been enough room to</B>
<BR><B>play 2 games at once.&nbsp; Anyway, we were all sitting up</B>
<BR><B>there when I went to climb down, when my foot got</B>
<BR><B>caught and I fell about 7-10 feet headfirst (at</B>
<BR><B>least.)</B>
<BR><B>Problem is I don't remember the fall, just landing on</B>
<BR><B>my back.&nbsp; It didn't hurt, in fact, I felt no pain at</B>
<BR><B>all.&nbsp; It's just like I was standing and slipped.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>teacher asked me if I was alright and I told him I</B>
<BR><B>was.&nbsp; To this day I think some outside force saved me</B>
<BR><B>from potential death</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Shadows</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sriddle@IngeniumCapital.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm not entirely sure I want to share my experiences.&nbsp; I suppose
it is nothing too exciting compared to some.&nbsp; Most of the time I am
in denial and I don't talk abou it cause it scares me and makes me think
that if I talk or think about ghosts, then it is inviting spirits into
my life.</B>
<BR><B>I suppose my story starts when I was 4 or 5, but I don't remember
clearly when it started, it could have been since infancy.&nbsp; But when
I was around 4 we moved into a house in central Tucson.&nbsp; The house
is about 50 years old now, but this was 20 years ago, so it was a used
house but only 30 years old.&nbsp; It has no history that I am aware of,
it isn't in the best neighborhood however.&nbsp; Well basically there is
no story, just that I was haunted as a child.&nbsp; I would see these 3
dimensinal pure black figures.&nbsp; I used to think of them and call them
shadows, which makes the whold shadowlands thing pretty ironic.&nbsp; I
suppose these figures are common, certainly many people have seen or written
about them.&nbsp; I though of them as the absence of light, like a negative
for a picture, darkness instead of light.&nbsp; These figures visited me
a lot, perhaps every night, but I don't think it was that often.&nbsp;
It was certainly most nights, they just walked toward me.&nbsp; They came
through the doorway and walked toward me.&nbsp; I don't know what happened
when they reached me I was always too scared to look once they got too
close.&nbsp; I would just lay perfectly motionless under the covers and
pray for morning.&nbsp; There were men shapes and women shapes, and I think
even child shapes but I'm not sure.</B>
<BR><B>The figures were always coming toward me.&nbsp; I didn't understand
them being so young, and I don't think my parents understood why I was
so afraid of the "shadows". I remember sleeping in the living room one
night, my dad had told me that if I saw anything that I was to stand up
and comand that the presence leave in the name of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; So
a man's figure started toward me that night.&nbsp; I stood on the pullout
bed and said, "In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave,"&nbsp;
the presence turned from a man's shape to a woman's without losing a step.&nbsp;
So I tried again, "In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave,"&nbsp;
and it turned from woman to child or smaller form.&nbsp; At this point
I lost all bravery and hid motionless under the covers as usual. In retrospect
I think I should have tried commanding "all spirits" to depart.</B>
<BR><B>I don't really know what or why.&nbsp; I kinda always thought they
wanted my mortal form, and as a child I was susceptible to them.&nbsp;
I thought they were spirits that wanted the chance to live, but because
they had followed Satan they would never be given an opportunity at humanity.&nbsp;
Anyway, we moved before I turned 8, and I didn't really ever see them in
the new house.&nbsp; Sometimes I would think I saw something, or wake up
suddenly in the middle of the night. Actually still to this day I usually
wake up between 3 and 4 am, but then go back to sleep.&nbsp; As I said,
nothing ever really happened, and nothing has happened in years.&nbsp;
Except that my younger siblings and cousins blame any unexplained occurance
on "ghosts", and most of them will not sleep an any room that I have lived
in.&nbsp; They say wierd things happen in my rooms.&nbsp; I'm not so sure
about that, just stories they have heard maybe.&nbsp; Though I certainly
don't talk about such things anymore.&nbsp; But I did effect my life.&nbsp;
I fear ghosts, I'm more afraid of them then of actual danger.&nbsp; If
someone broke into my house I would probably just be releaved that they
were human!&nbsp; But as I said I try not to talk or think about it anymore
cause it makes me feel susceptible and afraid.&nbsp; I deeply fear mirrors
at this time, and if I am feeling scared I refuse to look in them.&nbsp;
Usually I'm not afraid, but I don't trust them, they lie and are only a
fascimile or reality, and I find that disturbing.&nbsp; I suppose that
makes me sound crazy, but I did once see one in the mirror, and that is
an experience I choose to believe I imagined.</B>

<BR><B>Ghost Stories of Sort</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ladyjynx@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One of my earliest memories is actually a ghost story</B>
<BR><B>of sorts.&nbsp; In fact, my whole life has been littered</B>
<BR><B>with odd occurrences up until the last few years which</B>
<BR><B>have (thankfully) been exceptionally quiet.&nbsp; I seem to</B>
<BR><B>be some sort of magnet for this stuff or something.</B>
<BR><B>Here's a few of the most interesting ones...</B>
<BR><B>SHADOW ON THE WALL</B>
<BR><B>When I was only about 1 1/2 I lived in a house out in</B>
<BR><B>Estacada, OR.&nbsp; One night I woke up scared out of my</B>
<BR><B>little toddler mind and found a shadow on my wall</B>
<BR><B>shaped like a goat.&nbsp; The shadow had a definate</B>
<BR><B>presence and was watching me.&nbsp; I crawled out of my</B>
<BR><B>crib and peeked out the window.&nbsp; No goat.&nbsp; So I ran</B>
<BR><B>screaming into my parents' room and was promptly told</B>
<BR><B>I was having a bad dream, go back to bed.&nbsp; That shadow</B>
<BR><B>was there every night until my mom left my dad and we</B>
<BR><B>moved but even though I've never seen it since, there</B>
<BR><B>hasn't been a day go by that I don't still feel it's</B>
<BR><B>presence.</B>
<BR><B>WHERE THE HECK DID I JUST GO?</B>
<BR><B>At an older age, I remember lying in bed reading and</B>
<BR><B>suddenly I was someplace else, completely black.&nbsp; All</B>
<BR><B>of a sudden a pair of glowing eyes (resembling flying</B>
<BR><B>headlights) appeared and flew at me.&nbsp; Just before they</B>
<BR><B>hit me I was back in my room...and fell about six</B>
<BR><B>inches back onto my bed.</B>
<BR><B>TAP ON THE SHOULDER</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after getting my license I was driving home in</B>
<BR><B>my old Chevy Blazer when someone in the back seat</B>
<BR><B>tapped me on the shoulder.&nbsp; I had my head turned about</B>
<BR><B>half way around to answer them before I remembered</B>
<BR><B>that there was nobody else in my car.&nbsp; Almost drove</B>
<BR><B>off the road.</B>
<BR><B>ABANDONED RAILWAY STATION</B>
<BR><B>Got dragged out with my friend Suzie (Not her real</B>
<BR><B>name) and her boyfriend and another guy to some old</B>
<BR><B>railway station in Sherwood, OR.&nbsp; The boys said it was</B>
<BR><B>haunted.&nbsp; They saw nothing strangely, but Suzie and I</B>
<BR><B>both felt it.&nbsp; (and Suzie doesn't even normally pick</B>
<BR><B>up on stuff like that)&nbsp; As we were leaving there was a</B>
<BR><B>dog that suddenly appeared snarling and growling at</B>
<BR><B>the car.&nbsp; The boys didn't see it.&nbsp; I was drawn</B>
<BR><B>backthere repeatedly over the next month or so.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>don't know why but some other things happened like a</B>
<BR><B>big black shape flying down from the ceiling and</B>
<BR><B>ripping my hand open when I reflexively threw my arms</B>
<BR><B>up.&nbsp; And a friend of mine who lived in Vancouver, WA</B>
<BR><B>found himself scared and upset one night and went for</B>
<BR><B>a drive.&nbsp; He found himself sitting in front of the</B>
<BR><B>place for no reason, he freaked out and showed up at</B>
<BR><B>my place.&nbsp; After describing the building I told him</B>
<BR><B>where he had been.&nbsp; Strangely, I'd never told him</B>
<BR><B>where the place was.&nbsp; He'd actually spent a lot of</B>
<BR><B>time looking for the supernatural and never found</B>
<BR><B>evidence.&nbsp; He has now stopped looking.</B>
<BR><B>CANTURBURY CEMETARY</B>
<BR><B>And then there is the Canturbury Cemetery in Tigard,</B>
<BR><B>OR off of Hwy 99. (I found it mentioned on your</B>
<BR><B>Haunted Places Page, too!)&nbsp; My friend Joel lived in</B>
<BR><B>apartments right next to it.&nbsp; There was even a little</B>
<BR><B>trail that led from his parking lot to there.&nbsp; We went</B>
<BR><B>originally out of curiosity and found that several of</B>
<BR><B>the gravestones were broken and tipped over.&nbsp; A few</B>
<BR><B>someone had actually picked up and carried several</B>
<BR><B>feet from their bases.&nbsp; So, trying to be nice we set</B>
<BR><B>them all back up the next morning when it was light.</B>
<BR><B>Few night later we went back and they were tipped</B>
<BR><B>again and some of the graves had freshly turned dirt</B>
<BR><B>and depressions like someone had dug up the bodies.</B>
<BR><B>(ew!) While we were putting them back up one of my</B>
<BR><B>friends pointed into the trees (very wooded cemetery)</B>
<BR><B>and there were little green balls of light floating</B>
<BR><B>around out there.&nbsp; As we got more scared, they got</B>
<BR><B>brighter.&nbsp; We continued putting the stones back and we</B>
<BR><B>all suddenly felt like something big was coming and</B>
<BR><B>left. (The howling and screaming mentioned on the</B>
<BR><B>Haunted Places page might very well have been us</B>
<BR><B>running like scared children).&nbsp; So for a couple months</B>
<BR><B>this went on.&nbsp; someone knocked the graves down, we put</B>
<BR><B>them back.&nbsp; The big whatever stayed absent.&nbsp; Then one</B>
<BR><B>night as I was putting back one of the smaller</B>
<BR><B>gravestones...for 11 year old Louis Armstrong</B>
<BR><B>(Schaumberg?) I actually saw him.&nbsp; He was kinda fuzzy</B>
<BR><B>and out of focus sort of.&nbsp; He told me "it" was coming</B>
<BR><B>and we should leave.&nbsp; I told my friends and we began</B>
<BR><B>bugging out.&nbsp; As we were nearing the edge we felt the</B>
<BR><B>big whatever-it-was settle over the graveyard and for</B>
<BR><B>the last few yards out of the trees it got too dark to</B>
<BR><B>see.&nbsp; I have no idea what was going on in that place</B>
<BR><B>and I simply prefer not to speculate about it.&nbsp; (Oh,</B>
<BR><B>and if any adventurous people go to check it out,</B>
<BR><B>beware of poison oak.)</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, there's a few of my stories.&nbsp; Hope I didn't</B>
<BR><B>babble on for too long.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Just a Few....</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: disgustipated8083@mindless.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have only recently found your website but I must admit, that I
truly love reading all of the stories you have posted. I was debating on
whether or not to add in my own, and finally decided after reading the
Imps or Dreams story. Okay, here goes.</B>
<BR><B>My dad died when I was seven years old. I remember always feeling
different from everyone in my school because they all had mothers and fathers
that lived in the same house. It was so bad that I wouldn't tell anyone
that he was dead, but that he had moved away and was "living" on the street
that his cemetery was on. I refused to think of him as dead, and sometimes,
so did my mom. I would talk to him and take comfort in remembering him,
even if my memories are precious few.</B>
<BR><B>My mother decided to move shortly after the death of my dad. It
took two years for her to find the right house for us. The day that she
moved out, after all of our things were packed and out in trucks with the
rest of my family, my mother called loudly, "Richard, you can come with
us, too." She didn't want to leave him in the apartment all alone.</B>
<BR><B>Since she told me this, and being that I was only nine at the time,
I was more fierce in telling people about my guardian angel father, who
was watching my every move. Every now and then, I get a good feeling that
he's near me and when my mother decided to move to TX, she asked him to
come along again. He did, of course.</B>
<BR><B>Before we moved, my mother asked my best friend's mother questions
about her dreams. She can see and dream about the dead, a lot more often
than I can. She hates having the power, but because my mom is her best
friend, agreed to asking my dad questions, should the time arise. Instead,
my father came to her, after my mom told him to, and told her a bunch of
stuff about our family, and what might happen. All but one prophecy has
come true, concerning us kids, but I don't know what he told my mom, except
that he loves us and is very proud of me.</B>
<BR><B>Now, my father isn't my only ghost. After we moved into the house
in MA, I started to see and feel things. There were three ghosts that I
could find sufficient evidence of, but my brother saw more of them, including
our dad. One was stationed eternally by our bathroom doorway. He was a
malevolent ghost who insisted on scaring the crap out of me at every chance
he could. My belief is that he had something to do with the attic, the
doorway being right beside our bathroom.</B>
<BR><B>The second I have never seen but my brother and, later on, my best
friend have. He's a Vietnam vet that stands guard by the closet in that
bedroom. The room was always cold, but that could also be because of the
other ghosts, I don't know. My brother described him perfectly to me and
my best friend, and later on, she said that she had seen him and had been
so scared she couldn't move. I don't think he meant to scare them.</B>
<BR><B>The third was a benevolent spirit. I used to joke around about him,
calling him something like Herbie, but maybe not. He used to move things,
like car keys, school books and the such. He was a very happy kind of guy
and often-times played jokes on me and my brother, for the sheer fun of
it.</B>
<BR><B>Just before we moved, my mom, like I said, invited my dad to Texas
with us. My mom and I were talking to her best friend about it and she
reemed us out like crazy. The last time we had invited him with us to move,
it had been okay, there were no other spirits in that apartment. However,
we had a great many in the next house, and our invitation, although not
meant to be, somehow extended to the others. Herbie's okay, but a lot less
playful. I've seen and felt the angry spirit a few times. Now, he's hanging
out in the shower to my room.</B>
<BR><B>My dad's still around, and he still takes care of me. It's harder
for him to do so because my husband doesn't believe in that kind of stuff.
I talk to him now and again, too, and I always know that he is there listening.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Attic Door</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: buffierenee@prodigy.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>The house i used to live in was 98 years old.Really creaky.Alot of
the doors wouldnt open or close without a fight.One day i was going up
to my bedroom.You have to go through my bedroom to get to the attic.The
attic door sags badly.I always have to get my dad to shut it.Anyways&nbsp;
i was trying to close it on my own it wasnt working so i gave up.All of
a sudden the door started opening and closing rapidly on its own.As i said
my house&nbsp; is old&nbsp; there was a hole in the ceiling of the starcase.You
can see into the attic from it.I was so scared i ran to the stars (right
before running downstairs to my mom )and i looked through the hole to see
if maybe i was dreaming it.But the door was still moving.Latter that day
i went back upstairs and the attic door was open like it had been in the
first place.I told my parents but i wonder if they believe me.Nothing else
has happened.But i never felt alone again while i was in my room.It was
like&nbsp; i was being watched</B>
<BR><B>from the attic.</B>

<BR><B>Aware of the Supernatural</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: chrissy_loon@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Chrissy and I am 17 years old. I am intrigued by this
site and it has inspired me to tell of an experience that I went through.</B>
<BR><B>Last year, I had travelled to a remote town of about 2000 people
for personal reasons. For the time I was there (not long), I was to stay
in a trailer with a few others. We each had our own rooms. The rooms were
on either side a long hallway the ran throughout the whole trailer. That
night, everyone was in bed and most likely sleeping, I was in my room getting
ready for bed. I turned out the lights and was lying in the dark. All of
a sudden, I heard noises. I quickly dismissed them. Then I heard footsteps
in the hallway. I assumed it was the others walking around so I poked my
head out in the hall to see who it was. No one was out there. Again, I
dismissed it. A couple minutes later I heard something that scared me to
death and still scares me. All the doors in the hall except mine sounded
like they were being thrown open and shut over and over again with great
force, all at the same time. I knew that only 3 other rooms other than
mine were occupied, so it wasn't a joke or something. I debated whether
to go and check just in case it was people who were doing this. The noise
went on as I got up and opened my door. I looked out in the hallway...nobody
was out there and the doors were all closed. I closed my door as my heart
began beating faster, as soon as my door closed the noises resumed with
the same force. I opened my door and the noises stopped. I closed the door
and the noises resumed once again. I decided whatever entity was doing
this, I didn't want to mess with it so I locked my door and crawled back
into my bed scared to death. The door slamming eventually stopped. The
next morning, my door was open... nobody could have gained entry without
me opening the door. Also, I found that only one other person in the trailer
was awake to hear the same noises I did the night before. He was just as
spooked as I was. I still don't know who or what was throwing those doors
open that night and I'd rather not know. Needless to say, I much more aware
of supernatural beings and the power they possess.</B>

<BR><B>My Girl</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ltownsend1@cfl.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had my pet golden retriever My Girl since I was five. Sadly I had
to put her to sleep around July of 2000. She had a tumor on her heart and
every breath that she gave around that time was another gasp for air. It
had enlarged her heart where there was nothing that could be done. My Girl
was many things to me. A best friend and dear companion, a member of the
family, and my baby. We had the strongest bond. Around Christmas of 2000
we went around looking at Christmas lights as we had previous years. Normally
we would take My Girl with us. Since her passing I think she tried to show
us she was still with us. The guy at one of the houses we saw lights at
took a picture of us with one of those instant picture cameras.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Something is in the picture. I know she is still with us.</B>

friend and I was told of something that happend in that room.&nbsp; Apparantly
a student killed herself in the exact room I was in.&nbsp; Well ( and I
know I was NOT&nbsp; dreaming) one night I woke to to the real hard slamming
of the sceen door&nbsp; that was attached to .&nbsp; (the screen&nbsp;
doors swung out.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It was real loud I was surprized no one else
heard it. But I have been told that "when you are being haunted others
will not hear your cries.&nbsp; So I lay back down then about 30 minutes
later I hear&nbsp; a noise like some one is rusling stuff around&nbsp;
on my dresser.&nbsp; I look up&nbsp; to see if my roommate is up.&nbsp;
no, she was sound asleep.&nbsp; So I lay back down again&nbsp; only to
here the sound&nbsp; of my creeking wood floors.&nbsp; It sounded like
someone was walking on my floor.&nbsp; After that stopped I stood up&nbsp;
and&nbsp; sceamed at the top of my lungs&nbsp; my roomates name."" JULIA!&nbsp;&nbsp;
JULIA"&nbsp;&nbsp; She was laying on her side and never moved.&nbsp; I
decided to get the nerve up and go to the bathroom so I left my room&nbsp;
feeling safe that I was out only to find I was wrong,&nbsp; the hallway
window was up and it&nbsp; slammed down just as I exited my room.&nbsp;
I stayed&nbsp; in the bathroom till dawn and thats all I remember.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nedless to say to this day it scares the hell out of me. that sometimes
I think I have someone or thing is with me.&nbsp; Maybe that is why I have

<BR><B>Nana's On the Staircase</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tulsa_mclean@elvis.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here is a ghost story for your website.</B>
<BR><B>This happened to a family friend of mine named Heather.</B>
<BR><B>It was the early 90s and her great grandmother had just</B>
<BR><B>died.&nbsp; Everyone called her Nana.&nbsp; Heather was really</B>
<BR><B>close to her so she was taking it really hard being</B>
<BR><B>only 11 years-old.</B>
<BR><B>Heather's mother was basically trying remove everything</B>
<BR><B>from sight that had a "great grandma" memory attached</B>
<BR><B>to it because she was taking it even harder.&nbsp; So she</B>
<BR><B>asked Heather and a friend to move a dresser mirror</B>
<BR><B>downstairs to the basement that was a wedding present</B>
<BR><B>from Nana.&nbsp; As they reached the landing above the final</B>
<BR><B>set of stairs Heather felt a tap on her should and she</B>
<BR><B>turned--it was Nana plain as day.&nbsp; Heather started to</B>
<BR><B>shake--her other friend counldn't see this woman but it</B>
<BR><B>was apparent to her that Heather was in some sort of</B>
<BR><B>trance.&nbsp; She said that Nana reached out her hand to</B>
<BR><B>steady the mirror and said, "Now becareful with that</B>
<BR><B>hon, it's old."--she said her voice sounded like it was</B>
<BR><B>coming from the end of a hall--it had an echo to it.</B>
<BR><B>That was all Heather needed and she said she ran into</B>
<BR><B>the bedroom that was only about ten feet away and she</B>
<BR><B>and her friend threw the mirror on the bed (obviously</B>
<BR><B>she was too scared to care about the mirror's safety</B>
<BR><B>like Nana asked) and ran downstairs hysterical and</B>
<BR><B>refused to touch it or move it.&nbsp; Her mom wound up doing</B>
<BR><B>it.</B>
<BR><B>I never can do the tale justice--Heather of course</B>
<BR><B>tells it better.&nbsp; Just&nbsp; a few years ago she married and</B>
<BR><B>lit a candle at the wedding in her memory.</B>
