<p><b>Herbie</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JerryFOGE@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm writing to share my experience of living in a haunted house.I
lived in</b>
<br><b>the top half of a duplex for 8 years,&amp; for most of those years,I
had a ghost</b>
<br><b>in my house.I never saw it,nor heard it,but I had no doubt that
it was</b>
<br><b>there.My question wasn't did it exist;my question was who was it,where
did it</b>
<br><b>come from,&amp;why was it there.I had roommates from time to time;I
would warn</b>
<br><b>them about our uninvited guest.Though most were skeptical at 1st,they
all had</b>
<br><b>experiences with "Herbie"-as I named him-&amp; became just as convinced
as I was</b>
<br><b>of his presence.My girlfriend was scared,but she was the only one
of us that</b>
<br><b>really was.In time,the rest of us got a sense that Herbie wasn't</b>
<br><b>dangerous,just mischievous.He liked to make his presence known.From
the</b>
<br><b>nature of the pranks,I got the feeling that Herbie was a child.I
could almost</b>
<br><b>picture him hiding around the corner &amp; giggling after one of
his tricks.My</b>
<br><b>1st encoumter with him was when I was toweling off after a bath.There
was a</b>
<br><b>shelf on the wall where I kept my toiletries;all of a sudden,before
my</b>
<br><b>eyes,all the bottles started slowly falling off the shelf,as though
someone</b>
<br><b>were walking along dragging their arm,knocking them over.I wasn't
panicked;I</b>
<br><b>simply thought,"hmmm,that shouldn't happen!"......In the following
months,the</b>
<br><b>phone would get knocked off the hook,light switches would turn on
&amp;</b>
<br><b>off,envelopes &amp; tablets would go flying off the table,pictures
would get</b>
<br><b>knocked off the wall.The most bizarre episode occured one Friday.My
roomie</b>
<br><b>Dave was asleep;I was the only other person there.Dave then awoke
&amp; asked me</b>
<br><b>if Lu-my girlfriend-had left.I told him he must have been dreaming,Lu
hadn't</b>
<br><b>been there.He insisted that he had heard her in the kitchen.We stared
at each</b>
<br><b>other&amp;then searched the kitchen to make sure we hadn't been</b>
<br><b>burglarized.Finding nothing missing,we shrugged our shoulders &amp;
admitted we</b>
<br><b>had no explanation.Later that night,I got an emergency phone call
at work;it</b>
<br><b>was Lu,crying &amp; begging me to come home.I told her I couldn't
leave work,&amp;</b>
<br><b>asked her what had happened.She told me that she had heard Dave
put his key</b>
<br><b>in the lock,open it,&amp;enter his room.She said,"Hi,Dave",but he
didn't</b>
<br><b>answer,though she could hear him walking around.He always wore cowboy
boots,&amp;</b>
<br><b>I had hardwood floors,so obviously his footsteps were distinctive.When
he</b>
<br><b>didn't answer,she looked in his room...but it was empty.That was
when she</b>
<br><b>called me,terror-stricken.I managed to calm her down;I thought it
best not to</b>
<br><b>mention Dave's experience that morning until I got home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; At times,I would lose patience,&amp; stomp around yelling
for Herbie to show</b>
<br><b>himself.He never did.None of us ever did.Other times,I would laugh
at his</b>
<br><b>antics,&amp; almost began to regard him as an old friend.So much
for people who</b>
<br><b>think that all ghosts should be feared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I never found out Herbie's identity.It was an old house;anything
was</b>
<br><b>possible.After a while he became dormant,&amp; peace reigned.Eventually
the</b>
<br><b>pranks stopped altogether.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Anyway,a friend told me about this web site &amp; when I
saw the invitation to</b>
<br><b>share experiences,I thought I would tell you about Herbie.Thank
you.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Log Cabin</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Daydreamr0739532@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My aunt and Uncle used to live in a old log cabin.
We think it was by an</b>
<br><b>indian burial ground. But it was definetly haunted. And the spirit(s)
there</b>
<br><b>was not good at all.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, my aunt and uncle woke up to find
they couldn't move at all.</b>
<br><b>They were being held down by something.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that's not my story.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My three cousins all shared the same room. It
was the only room on the</b>
<br><b>second level. I hated going up there by myself. I never had to before,
but</b>
<br><b>this time I did.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about six or seven.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sisters and I had been playing board games
with our cousins up in</b>
<br><b>their room. When we went downstairs to watch movies, I left my shoes
up there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the time came to go, I couldn't find my
shoes. I looked everywhere.</b>
<br><b>Then my sister reminded me I left them in my cousin's bedroom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went up stairs and planned to run into the
room, get my shoes, then run</b>
<br><b>out and down te stairs as fast as I could.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran into the room and picked up the shoes.
But as i was turning around,</b>
<br><b>I felt something behind me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so afraid to trun around, but at the same
time, I wanted to run</b>
<br><b>down the stairs, right out of the house and into our car.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I slowely truned around, there I saw a small
little Indian girl, maybe</b>
<br><b>about my age. She was surrounded by a blue and white light.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just stood there, until she just vanished.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran out to the car, where my parents where
waiting. And until now, I</b>
<br><b>have never told anyone my story exept for my ant, who also sees
things.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later I found out that my aunt and uncle would
pray to the Indians to</b>
<br><b>watch over them, to protect them from whatever was in that house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the little Indian gril was just watching
over my cousins.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Abilities</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Val6618@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Although I have never "seen" a ghost, I believe that they have contacted
me.</b>
<br><b>My Papa died four months before I was to be married and we were
extremely</b>
<br><b>close to one another.&nbsp; He was supposed to walk me down the
aisle and when he</b>
<br><b>died in May, I was devestated.&nbsp; I had always known him as "the
epitomy of</b>
<br><b>what a man should be" and so his death caused me a great deal of
grief.</b>
<br><b>However, I am known in my family as "the strong one" and was told
not to cry</b>
<br><b>that I needed to be strong for my Granny, so I was.</b>
<br><b>At my wedding in September, I was walking down the stairs of the
antebellum</b>
<br><b>home I was married at and stopped suddenly on the landing while
my daddy just</b>
<br><b>stared at me.&nbsp; My blusher was over my face and I couldn't see
anything, but I</b>
<br><b>felt a hand on my left shoulder and could smell my papa's cologne.</b>
<br><b>Two months later, I was sitting in my Granny's house in their old
bedroom</b>
<br><b>(she still doesn't sleep in there) and my husband was in the shower.&nbsp;
I sat</b>
<br><b>up in the bed and noticed an indention on my papa's side of the
bed, yet,</b>
<br><b>noone was there.&nbsp; Then, the TV turned itself on and it was
a program about</b>
<br><b>talking with the dead.&nbsp; Although I was scared, it wasn't a
fear of any harm,</b>
<br><b>just caught off guard.</b>
<br><b>Since this time, I have felt people tapping my shoulder and noone
being</b>
<br><b>there, I dream things and just as I forget about them, they happen
and I can</b>
<br><b>walk in a house and "know" something has happened.</b>
<br><b>I am trying to work my courage up to study this ability . . .</b>

<p><b>House from 1865</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: goth97@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Living in a house built in 1865, the noises we heard never bothered
us.</b>
<br><b>Noises come with old houses,we expected them. What we did not expect
were</b>
<br><b>the other things that came with the house. We learned that the house
was at</b>
<br><b>one time a funeral home and the room in which the coffins were lowered
to</b>
<br><b>the basement was the original room left on the house. This room,
we used it</b>
<br><b>as a den, left us in awe. One night, while sitting in my sisters
bedroom</b>
<br><b>talking, my sister and I both saw something in the kitchen, right
in front</b>
<br><b>of the door to our den. Neither of us said anything figuring it
was just our</b>
<br><b>imaginations. The second time we saw it, we both said at the same
time, "Did</b>
<br><b>you see that?" We both saw the figures of two women, one who looked
like she</b>
<br><b>was knitting and the other pacing back and forth. These women became
a part</b>
<br><b>of our everyday life, appearing usually at night. The way we knew
when they</b>
<br><b>were there, was by the anniversary clock. The battery had died and
my sister</b>
<br><b>had never replaced, yet, somehow, every night around the same time,11:00,
it</b>
<br><b>would start working, and the time would be right. In the morning,
the clock</b>
<br><b>would stop again and it would stay at whatever time it stopped until
11:00</b>
<br><b>that night. We have since moved and we believe they may have moved
with us.</b>
<br><b>The anniversary clock works every once in a while and we sometimes
wtill get</b>
<br><b>the feeling that someone or something is living here with us.</b><b></b>

<br><b>unknown experiences while in the navy</b><b></b>
<p><b>by: deckfam92@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;my wife and i had moved to the naval station at mare island</b>
<br><b>at vallejo ca. i was attached to the personnel support office. about
4 months</b>
<br><b>after reporting i was sent to the combat systems tech. schools command
to</b>
<br><b>process new students. i hadnt heard about the schools past until
my</b>
<br><b>encounter(?)&nbsp; one day in the fall of 1993. i was typing up
a report about</b>
<br><b>0730, before the 3 other civilans and 1 other sailor got there.
the type</b>
<br><b>writer was next to the door to my office so i didnt miss anyone
coming or</b>
<br><b>going. there also was just that one main entry way into the office
cluster.</b>
<br><b>no other exits except for a fire door with the alarm connected.
anyway</b>
<br><b>someone walked by my door and i thought it was my shipmate so i
asked how he</b>
<br><b>was doing. i got no reply so i thought he hadnt heard me&nbsp; and
i decided to</b>
<br><b>bug him after i finished my report. i went to his office and found
it locked.</b>
<br><b>then i noticed a light on down the hall. i stuck my head in and
saw one of</b>
<br><b>the civialn computer programmers at work on her terminal. i told
her i</b>
<br><b>thought brian had walked by but didnt realize it was her. she looked
at me</b>
<br><b>and said that she hadnt moved from her computer since she got there
at about</b>
<br><b>15 minutes to 700. i then told her what had just happaned. she said
that</b>
<br><b>brian could tell me stuff since he'd been ther awile. it was then
i learned</b>
<br><b>that the school was a fleet hospital for the san fran bay area,
built back in</b>
<br><b>approx. 185os. the night watch detail would find locked doors open,
and hear</b>
<br><b>footsteps at night. i was told the one that i should really hear&nbsp;
is the</b>
<br><b>sound of a little girl playing ball near the main staircase. i never
had the</b>
<br><b>chance, and the base is now closed. but it was very intresting.
one other</b>
<br><b>experience was shared by my wife , myself and my mother in law at
hickam afb</b>
<br><b>in hawaii in 1995. my wife had been flown to tripler army hospital
due to</b>
<br><b>complications with our first child. my mother in law arrived a day
before i</b>
<br><b>got there from my ship. any way we were put up in the guest house
at hickam</b>
<br><b>for a couple of nights before being moved temporarily to a officers
quarter</b>
<br><b>in the corner of the base. it was a well furnished room and had
a pleasent</b>
<br><b>air about it. that was until the night arrived. we saw nothing or
heard</b>
<br><b>nothing, but the next morning upon leaving the quarters we all let
out a sigh</b>
<br><b>and each suprised the other by relating what we had felt that night.
it was</b>
<br><b>an extremly uncomfortable feeling. kind of oppresive. like being
at a party</b>
<br><b>and the guests changed their mind about you being there. i just
thought it</b>
<br><b>was funny that we couldnt talk about it in the room but only when
we left.</b>
<br><b>thank you for taking the time to hear me babble. my wife and i would
like to</b>
<br><b>know if you had any experiences while with the military.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Lion's Roar</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: angela.vest@fuse.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is the first time I have ever submitted any thing.&nbsp; I have
a couple of</b>
<br><b>experiences and have some from my parents also.</b>
<br><b>We'll start off with my parents.&nbsp; When I was about 21 I was
still living</b>
<br><b>with my parents and they were working for a company that shipped
things over</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; One particular night they were getting ready to go
on a run at about</b>
<br><b>2:00 am in the middle of the week.&nbsp; My mom Nancy was in the
bathroom with</b>
<br><b>the door open and my father Dave was in the bedroom, and the bathroom
is one</b>
<br><b>that is connected to the bedroom so matter where you are you right
next to</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; My father was putting on his socks and my mother was brushing
her hair</b>
<br><b>when all of a sudden a lion roar loud.&nbsp; My mother immediately
stopped and</b>
<br><b>looked at my father and my father did the same at my mother.&nbsp;
My mother</b>
<br><b>asked my father what the heck was that?&nbsp; He replied "It almost
sounded like</b>
<br><b>a lion's roar!"&nbsp; and she confirmed that that was in fact what
it sounded</b>
<br><b>like.&nbsp; To this day they can't figure out what that was.</b>
<br><b>There also was another time that my mother was sleeping and she
woke her</b>
<br><b>self up by talking in her sleep.&nbsp; She was telling someone to
stay away.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>the process my father woke up.&nbsp; When my mother opened her eyes
she saw a orb</b>
<br><b>floating around her.&nbsp; (Obviously the orb was trying to communicate
with her</b>
<br><b>as she slept, as I hear that is the only true way that you can get
through</b>
<br><b>to someone who isn't a medium.)&nbsp; Any way she stared at it for
a few seconds</b>
<br><b>and then it floated away.&nbsp; Well she thought that she was dreaming
and</b>
<br><b>disregarded it.&nbsp; The next morning they went out for breakfast
and did their</b>
<br><b>normal things and the afternoon rolled around and she had remembered
the</b>
<br><b>weird dream she had from the night before and wanted to tell my
father about</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; But before she could he said something.&nbsp; He had mentioned
that he had</b>
<br><b>seen a strange round orb floating, and went on to describe it.&nbsp;
So both of</b>
<br><b>them had seen this orb.&nbsp; She just told me about it a few weeks
ago,</b>
<br><b>apparently this happened a month or 2 ago.</b>
<br><b>My father has a special gift.&nbsp; He has dreams about planes.&nbsp;
He knows a few</b>
<br><b>days ahead what is going to happen he just doesn't know where or
what.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have the same capabilities except not at night in sleep but during
the day</b>
<br><b>like a day dream.&nbsp; Mine is with death in general.&nbsp; I have
predicted one</b>
<br><b>death and one possible.&nbsp; When he was a child he saw one hit
in to a mountain</b>
<br><b>and there was a woman who had broken her ankles and was walking
around on</b>
<br><b>them asking where her baby was, she was the only survivor.&nbsp;
He was only 5 or</b>
<br><b>6 years old.&nbsp; He also as a smaller child saw someone crash
in a car and burn</b>
<br><b>to death.&nbsp; He asked his father what happened and he told him
it was a dream</b>
<br><b>and nothing was wrong to go back to bed.&nbsp; So I think he is
debating whether</b>
<br><b>or not that was a dream or not.&nbsp; I believe it was true.</b>
<br><b>The one death was when I was a roofer and I was sitting there and
looking at</b>
<br><b>my boyfriends uncle and it happened.&nbsp; I saw him in a coffin
and saw the</b>
<br><b>number six and I couldn't tell if weeks, months or what, but it
felt like</b>
<br><b>months.&nbsp; But I wasn't sure.&nbsp; I had never had this happen
before and I</b>
<br><b>thought I had a sick mind.&nbsp; I told my boyfriend about it and
he freaked.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>didn't tell me anything till six months when his uncle was hospitalized
for</b>
<br><b>AIDS and Lung Cancer.&nbsp; The only thing that I knew was he got
a lot of pills</b>
<br><b>sent to my boyfriends moms house.&nbsp; Other than that it was a
family secret.</b>
<br><b>His uncle died at 6 months and I went to his funeral.</b>
<br><b>I had another encounter with my own family member.&nbsp; I saw my
aunt in a</b>
<br><b>coffin and the numbers 222.&nbsp; I couldn't figure it out then
it came to me as</b>
<br><b>a date 2-22.&nbsp; On Feb 22, she fell and broke her hip and she
lived by her</b>
<br><b>self and one of her neighbors happen to notice her paper was still
outside.</b>
<br><b>So she went over there and saw what happened so she called the paramedics</b>
<br><b>and so forth.&nbsp; She was force into a nursing home after that.&nbsp;
My mom and dad</b>
<br><b>knew about it and that was it.&nbsp; I haven't had anything since
then but I was</b>
<br><b>freaked out.&nbsp; I think I have special abilities but I don't
know how to use</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; I am scared of spirits.&nbsp; I am scared of the evil
ones especially!</b>
<br><b>Sometimes I wonder.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Unsolved Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kirkg263@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Kirk. I'm about to turn 18 and I</b>
<br><b>live in New York State. I apologize in advance for the</b>
<br><b>length of my story, but I never get to talk to anyone</b>
<br><b>about these things that happen. I am looking for</b>
<br><b>answers as to whether or not the house I live in is</b>
<br><b>haunted. I don't talk to my friends about them because</b>
<br><b>I always get the weirdest reactions when I mention</b>
<br><b>them. Ya know, the kind of look someone makes when</b>
<br><b>they think you're insane. Since I was a little kid, I</b>
<br><b>had always found the paranormal amusing. My Mom</b>
<br><b>believes in ghosts based on her own experiences, which</b>
<br><b>I might say are quite frightening. I have two older</b>
<br><b>sisters and both have related their own personal</b>
<br><b>experiences to me. So in a way, I suppose I was</b>
<br><b>influenced into finding the supernatural interesting.</b>
<br><b>I live in a two family house that my family owns. We</b>
<br><b>used to rent the bottom apartment out to people, back</b>
<br><b>in late 80's, early 90's. The tenants have said that</b>
<br><b>the downstairs apartment in haunted, and a psychic my</b>
<br><b>Mom brought over one time said that the apartment was</b>
<br><b>indeed haunted. In one of the rooms downstairs, my</b>
<br><b>great grandfather passed away (The house has been in</b>
<br><b>our family for a while). Also, my Moms nephew who came</b>
<br><b>over from Ecuador was living with us when I was about</b>
<br><b>7 or 8, hard to remember. He died while living here in</b>
<br><b>a car accident in Lake George. Is it possible he has</b>
<br><b>unfinished business because his wife and daughter live</b>
<br><b>in another country? Also, my Moms boyfriend of a long</b>
<br><b>time ago (this is back in Ecuador, which was probably</b>
<br><b>in the 60's) died on a hiking trip. My Mom loved him</b>
<br><b>and always insists that he watches over her. That's</b>
<br><b>just some backround information because they could all</b>
<br><b>be possible haunts. The experiences I'm remembering,</b>
<br><b>are all recent ones. We moved from our old house in</b>
<br><b>the early 90's and moved to Salem Mass. After three</b>
<br><b>years we moved back to our house in NY, and after that</b>
<br><b>time is the only experiences I remember. My older</b>
<br><b>sisters slept in our redone attic when they were</b>
<br><b>teenagers. I was envious because they were on a whole</b>
<br><b>different floor of the house, I used to think the</b>
<br><b>attic was cool. Both my sisters have stories about the</b>
<br><b>attic. My sisters moved out long ago, which gave me</b>
<br><b>the advantage of choosing a room up in the attic,</b>
<br><b>being older and all. I chose the room which was my</b>
<br><b>oldest sisters, because of it's size and location in</b>
<br><b>the house, it was the last room and had stairs in the</b>
<br><b>room going down and leading into the second floor</b>
<br><b>apartment. The first night I slept up there, a good</b>
<br><b>friend of 10 years stayed the night with me. He is the</b>
<br><b>only one I talk with about my experiences. it was</b>
<br><b>about 2:00 AM and we were lying awake, starting to</b>
<br><b>doze off. He had his discman with him and was playing</b>
<br><b>a CD, with the headphones off his head, so we could</b>
<br><b>both hear the music. I was laying there when all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden I heard the distinct and startling noise of a</b>
<br><b>marble rolling down the stairs that were in my room.</b>
<br><b>It finally hit the bottom of the stairs and I asked my</b>
<br><b>friend if it was him that did that. I remember</b>
<br><b>thinking "great, the first damn night I'm in here</b>
<br><b>something weird has to happen". I definitely would</b>
<br><b>have seen if my friend had thrown the marble down the</b>
<br><b>stairs but he didn't (by the way this actually</b>
<br><b>happened one more time before not happening since).</b>
<br><b>That story can probably be explained easily, but there</b>
<br><b>are other weird ones. In the same room I was sleeping</b>
<br><b>one night. I'm 95% sure I would have closed my closet</b>
<br><b>all the way before I went to bed because a thing like</b>
<br><b>that would bother the hell out of me and I wouldn't be</b>
<br><b>able to sleep. I woke up suddenly in the middle of the</b>
<br><b>night to a very strange noise. It was a quick and</b>
<br><b>harsh boom mixed with a WOOSH sound. I looked around</b>
<br><b>my room to find the source and my eyes focused on my</b>
<br><b>closet door. The door was open. I sort of stood up and</b>
<br><b>chuckled because it was like 3 in the morning. I</b>
<br><b>closed the door and went back to sleep. I later</b>
<br><b>analyzed the sound because I remembered when I woke</b>
<br><b>up. What it sounded like, was the closet door being</b>
<br><b>pushed hard from the inside, and rubbing on the carpet</b>
<br><b>as it opened, which would account for the woosh. I was</b>
<br><b>never scared, just sort of curious as to whether or</b>
<br><b>not I was insane. The next experience was definitely</b>
<br><b>an odd one. It was the morning (morning is like 12</b>
<br><b>noon to me, especially in the summer)and I had woken</b>
<br><b>up and was getting ready to take a shower. I made my</b>
<br><b>way downstairs and was heading to my Moms room to get</b>
<br><b>a towel. No one else was in the house at this time, my</b>
<br><b>Mom was working and so was her boyfriend. As I was</b>
<br><b>passing through our dining room I felt something cold</b>
<br><b>hit my right earlobe. Within a couple seconds my</b>
<br><b>fingers were up to my ear to pinch what was ever on my</b>
<br><b>ear, because I thought it was a bug. I took my fingers</b>
<br><b>away and realized that what hit my ear was a drop of</b>
<br><b>some liquid. It didn't feel like water, it almost felt</b>
<br><b>like oil, and it had a strange smell to it, almost</b>
<br><b>like a perfume oil smell. Very confused I rubbed it in</b>
<br><b>my fingers and looked around the ceiling for the</b>
<br><b>source. But if you think about it, an earlobe is an</b>
<br><b>awkward place for something like that to land on. If</b>
<br><b>it was coming from above, it would have hit the top of</b>
<br><b>my ear right? But that's not the end. I shrugged it</b>
<br><b>off, got my towel and went into the bathroom. I took</b>
<br><b>my shirt off and splot, I felt a drop hit my chest.</b>
<br><b>Now this was weird because I was in a totally</b>
<br><b>different part of my house. And again, the chest is an</b>
<br><b>odd place if the drop is falling from above. Before</b>
<br><b>touching the spot I looked at it. It had definitely</b>
<br><b>splattered with some force because it was spread out a</b>
<br><b>little. I touched it and smelled it, and it was the</b>
<br><b>same damn substance. I found that very interesting,</b>
<br><b>and later told my mom about it. She started to laugh</b>
<br><b>because something similar had happened to her. And a</b>
<br><b>very recent but small and unexplained experience</b>
<br><b>happened in my room. One of my cats was sleeping on my</b>
<br><b>bed and I was sitting in this love seat I have,</b>
<br><b>watching TV. My lights were off so I couldn't see</b>
<br><b>anything clearly other than the TV. It wasn't</b>
<br><b>startling or anything, but I heard something hit my</b>
<br><b>wall, as if being thrown. One side of my bed was right</b>
<br><b>against the wall, and when I got up to examen what hit</b>
<br><b>the wall, I found a staple remover lying on my bed.</b>
<br><b>You know, those things with big sharp metal teeth to</b>
<br><b>remove staples from paper. I have no doubt in my mind</b>
<br><b>that the staple remover is what hit my wall with a</b>
<br><b>good amount of force. I'm pretty sure my cat did not</b>
<br><b>do it as he was not moving, and suprisingly didn't</b>
<br><b>move after it hit the wall. These things bug me out</b>
<br><b>because I still have no explanation for them. Is my</b>
<br><b>house haunted by a timid spirit who wants me to know</b>
<br><b>that it is there? Any comments or advice would be</b>
<br><b>appreciated, hope you found my story interesting.</b><b></b>

<p><b>i haven't really told anybody but my Uncle Fred this story. Well,
I was about</b>
<br><b>ten years old and driving down 9W with my uncle Fred. It was February
19, my</b>
<br><b>Uncle Johnny's birthday ( Uncle Johnny had died when he was 19,
3 days after</b>
<br><b>his birthday in a motorcycle accident) so naturally i was thinking
about him.</b>
<br><b>I was thinking " I wonder if he can hear me? I wish I could find
out</b>
<br><b>somehow!" So I looked up, and my Uncle Fred said, " Hey! Look at
that</b>
<br><b>liscense plate!" On the car ahead of us, the liscense plate read
"213-KCF".</b>
<br><b>2-13, my brithday, and KCF, my initials. I figured " Maybe this
is a sign</b>
<br><b>that he can hear me!" Then, a band of bikers rode by, and one, who
pulled up</b>
<br><b>along side us had the name "John" on his Helmet. John was Uncle

<p><b>USS Forrestal</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: graywolf333@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Darren B. I am in the Navy and had</b>
<br><b>many encounters with spirits. One of these encounters</b>
<br><b>happened when I was stationed on the U.S.S. Forrestal</b>
<br><b>from 1991 to 1993. We were in the shipyards in</b>
<br><b>Philadelphia ,I just got off work around 11:00pm(2300)</b>
<br><b>from a watch. I took a bus to the barracks that the</b>
<br><b>ships company stays in while work was been done on the</b>
<br><b>ship. I lived on the second floor of the building. I</b>
<br><b>go to my room and get ready for bed. As I am laying in</b>
<br><b>bed trying to go to sleep I feel as if a female</b>
<br><b>climbed in to bed with me. Now at this time, I know</b>
<br><b>this could not be a female, because no females were</b>
<br><b>allowed in the barracks. It started at my feet and</b>
<br><b>felt as if something lifted the covers and slid up my</b>
<br><b>body and put their arm around me. I had my eyes open</b>
<br><b>feeling all this going on. I could feel her body</b>
<br><b>pressed against mine and her fingers interlocked with</b>
<br><b>mine. I could feel the fingers but could not see them.</b>
<br><b>I was not scared but I was curious . I could not move</b>
<br><b>at all. I tried to move my fingers but could not.</b>
<br><b>After what seems like forever I managed to nudge her</b>
<br><b>off of me. As she left I heard what sounded like</b>
<br><b>"bye". The whole time she was laying there it was a</b>
<br><b>warm peaceful feeling. I guess when I nudged her off ,</b>
<br><b>I may have got her mad , because the next night I felt</b>
<br><b>her or something else place their feet under my arms</b>
<br><b>and pin me down. I opened my eyes and there was</b>
<br><b>nothing there. The pressure left me. I told my friend</b>
<br><b>Mike about it, He laughed about it and said "you are</b>
<br><b>lucky that little demon came back last night, again".</b>
<br><b>We looked at an old map of the base and a old runway</b>
<br><b>from what I believe was left there by the Air Force is</b>
<br><b>where the barracks sit now.</b>
<br><b>If you have any questions or comments please write me.</b>
<br><b>I love hearing about the unexplained.......</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Smiley Face</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sebberoni@home.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I love your site, I'm really fascinated by ghosts, etc, so
when my mom told me of a story that happened to her, I figured this was
the perfect place to share it. When my mom was about 10 years old, she,
her sister, and her father were painting her bedroom. My grandfather, being
the joker that he was, thought it would be funny to paint a huge smiley
face on the wall. So they did, just this gigantic smiley face that covered
the wall. My grandmother came in and after they had a good laugh, she told
them to paint over it. So they did, and that was the end of that. About
3 years later, when my mom was 13, her father passed away. A little while
after his death, one night she walked into her room and screamed, because
the smiley face her dad had painted 3 years earlier had bled through the
paint and was showing. To this day, my mom swears it was her father coming
back for one last goodbye.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Roommate</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RXYASHLEY@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>In the summer of 1999, I bought a house in small town in Washington
State.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I'm a California native so as you can imagine, I had a difficult
time</b>
<br><b>adjusting to the calmer settings.&nbsp; It was almost too quiet
for my liking.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;About three weeks after I moved into my new home, an old colonial
styled</b>
<br><b>house, I decided and began looking for a roommate.&nbsp; Soon after
I placed the</b>
<br><b>ad, I got a phone call from a very willing young lady who said it
sounded</b>
<br><b>like the perfect location for her.&nbsp; I took her name down and
she said she</b>
<br><b>would call me the next day to set up a time and place to meet.&nbsp;
I waited all</b>
<br><b>day for her phone call, but it never came.&nbsp; I figured she must
have found</b>
<br><b>some other place to stay, but I kept the spot vacant incase she
called back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A few weeks later, she did call again, and as before told
me she would call</b>
<br><b>back the next day to set up a time and place to meet.&nbsp; I faithfully
awaited</b>
<br><b>her return call, but same as the first time...it never came.&nbsp;
I began to get</b>
<br><b>suspicious as to weather it was a prank caller or a real person
of interest.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I thought it was odd how she'd given me a name without a number.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>attempts to find her in the phone book failed, so without anyother
place to</b>
<br><b>turn, I gave up on the search.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a three months later,
I was up in the Attic storing some</b>
<br><b>Christmas decorations I wouldn't be needing for sometime, when my
eyes fell</b>
<br><b>upon an old stack of newspapers in the corner.&nbsp; I was somehow
intrigued by a</b>
<br><b>perticular paper laying at the top of the stack.&nbsp; As I thumbed
through it I</b>
<br><b>was quite shocked to read an article printed about a young woman
who died in</b>
<br><b>her house (the house I was currently living in!) at the age of 22.&nbsp;
Even more</b>
<br><b>shocking was the name of the woman.&nbsp; It was an identical match
to the woman</b>
<br><b>who called about sharing my home.&nbsp; I couldn't catch my breath!&nbsp;
I went down</b>
<br><b>to the local historical library and discovered that this woman did
indeed</b>
<br><b>live in the very house I now owned, in the late 1800's.&nbsp; My
visit to the</b>
<br><b>Library occurred close to six months ago.&nbsp; Since then, late
at night, I've</b>
<br><b>heard crying downstairs in my living room</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Elderly Lady</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sailorsparrow@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;there is a ghost in my house.(i think)there were a series of
events that lead up to me thinking this:</b>
<br><b>1.&nbsp; when i moved into this house,no one lived there in 7 years.the
people who used to live there had died,and the family didn't want the house,so
the house was probly ready to colapse,but it was practically rebuilt.</b>
<br><b>2.one night, i was asleep and i heard nocking on my bedroom door,
i figured that it was my sister, so i ignored it. it knocked again. without
opening the door, i shouted in a half- awake voice "stop it!!" then i got
up and figured that someone would knock again,so i waited by my door ,
and another knock came.i quickly opened the door,and no one was there.
i heard snoring of everyone in my house,so there was no way that anyone
could have done this.</b>
<br><b>3. about a week later , i had a dream that there was an old lady
that killed people if they didn't give her 5 dollars and the lady died,then
came back for 5 bucks f/m me,then she killed me. that was definitly not
a prophacy, cuz i,m still alive(duh...) ,but, this did happen:when i woke
up,i'm almost positive that i saw a pair of red eyes on my wall,staring
at me.also,there was light coming out of the top of my window(my window
has curtins on 3/4 of my window) when it was 3 :30 a.m.(aproximatly) there
is no light outside at that time @ my house.</b>
<br><b>4. one day ,i was geting ready 4 school,the t.v. was off, my grandma
was asleep,i was brushing my teeth,then my dog went absolutly ape-s**t,
so i went to see what it was,and the dog was barking @ the wall that is
by my telephone,there&nbsp; was no messages,it wasn't ringing, then i heard
a voice that sounds like an old lady on crack say"it's o.k., it's me "
to my dog!!! i just stood there in shock 4 about 5 min., and almost missed
the bus.</b>
<br><b>5.one day when i was taking a shower,i got out and heard the same
voice say my first &amp; middle name.</b>
<br><b>6.one day when i was on the bus,my friend said that she called me
around 1 p.m. (no one was home then) and a person answered it,and my friend
asked if i was there,and in the same voice that i have known said in a
ticked off &amp; insane sounding tone of voice said that she'd leave a
message about 7 times.i know that i didn't tell her about the ghost &amp;
she wouldn't lie about something like that,cuz she didn't believe in the
paranormal,but after that expriance, she is now a believer.</b>
<br><b>all of these event s happened between september 2000 and january
2001,and i don't think that anything else will happen anytime soon,cuz
i told it to leave and never return.</b>

<br><b>The Haunted Summer, Pt. 1.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RGarza3rd@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>During the summer of 1976, my Mom, older brother and I decide to</b>
<br><b>accompany my Aunt and her family to West Virginia/North Carolina
to work</b>
<br><b>in the tobacco fields.&nbsp; I was about 11yrs old at the time.&nbsp;
After a 2-day</b>
<br><b>trip from Texas to West Virginia, we were assigned a house to stay
in</b>
<br><b>while were settled in to work.&nbsp; There were several of us (10
in all), and</b>
<br><b>we were tired from the trip, so everyone basically just picked a
spot in</b>
<br><b>the place and readied ourselves for bed for that first night.&nbsp;
It was NOT</b>
<br><b>a restful night!&nbsp; At about 3 AM, we were awakened by the sounds
of a</b>
<br><b>woman crying and wailing in the room WITH us!&nbsp; Looking around
the room,</b>
<br><b>we could see that everyone was accounted for and NOONE was crying!&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>sounds increased in intensity and lasted for about 45 mins.&nbsp;
When I say</b>
<br><b>"Wailing", I mean JUST that: a horrible, low sad sound. VERY similar
to</b>
<br><b>some of the sound effects heard in the old "Scooby-Doo" cartoons&nbsp;
(I</b>
<br><b>realize that sounds somewhat funny,...but I SWEAR its</b>
<br><b>TRUE!)....Thankfully, we werent to stay in that house for very long;</b>
<br><b>another house (with more room for 10 people) was assigned to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
THAT</b>
<br><b>was not an improvement!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The next house was a two-story one, located somewhere between</b>
<br><b>Hendersonville, NC and a small town known as Soul City.&nbsp; It
was situated</b>
<br><b>about 200 yards off a road, with a long driveway and a set of railroad</b>
<br><b>tracks that ran along the other side of the road.&nbsp; There was
a large</b>
<br><b>white house off to the north of&nbsp; "our" house, about another
300 yards</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; The house had a large open field in front, and was surrounded
by</b>
<br><b>woods on the other three sides,&nbsp; and a shed and an old open
waterwell in</b>
<br><b>back.&nbsp; Spooky enough setting during the day.&nbsp; At night,
things would</b>
<br><b>happen such as : lights turning on by themselves, footsteps heard</b>
<br><b>upstairs when everyone was in plain sight downstairs, the sounds
of</b>
<br><b>something heavy being all dragged through the house late at night
after</b>
<br><b>everyone had gone to bed, knocking on the walls and my brother swears</b>
<br><b>he'd seen what appeared to be a black-hooded figure at the foot
of his</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I swear to anyone reading this, these events REALLY
happened!</b>
<br><b>I'm 36 now, an Army Veteran, college educated and I have an interest
in</b>
<br><b>ghosts and the Supernatural.&nbsp; If anyone has any clues about
this house</b>
<br><b>(the one near Soul City, NC), its owners, or perhaps even its history,</b>
<br><b>please email me at RGarza3rd@juno.com&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be glad to
give detailed</b>
<br><b>accounts of what happened in either house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanx for

<br><b>The Grace Drive House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SunnyMarie4@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When I was in eighth grade, my mother, younger brother and I moved
into a</b>
<br><b>rental home on Grace Dr. in Wilson, NC.&nbsp; I had always been
interested in</b>
<br><b>ghosts and hauntings but had never had any experiences.&nbsp; This
house would</b>
<br><b>change that fact.</b>
<br><b>As soon as we moved into the home, I had a very uneasy feeling,
only in my</b>
<br><b>room; I always felt like someone was watching me from my closest.&nbsp;
Also,</b>
<br><b>feeling uneasy, I could not sleep with my door closed and forbid
my mother to</b>
<br><b>close her door while we were sleeping.&nbsp; I also started sleeping
with my</b>
<br><b>pillow on top of my head in order to feel safe and secure in this
room.&nbsp; On</b>
<br><b>several occasions, I felt someone pushing the pillow down hard on
my head as</b>
<br><b>I was trying to go to sleep.&nbsp; It was not sleep paralysis because
I had just</b>
<br><b>layed down.&nbsp; At first I thought that it was my brother playing
with me, to</b>
<br><b>the point where I yelled out his name for him to stop because the
pushing</b>
<br><b>hurt.&nbsp; However, when the pushing stopped, no one was in the
room, I was all</b>
<br><b>alone.</b>
<br><b>One evening around dusk, my mother and I were sitting on the front
steps that</b>
<br><b>were located between the bedroom end of the home and the living
room, where</b>
<br><b>my brother was alone watching television.&nbsp; My bedroom was located
on the</b>
<br><b>front of the house with only one window.&nbsp; I had a lamp on sitting
on my</b>
<br><b>bedstand in front of the window and beside the bed.&nbsp; I stood
up in order to</b>
<br><b>illustrate a point to my mother, now facing the house with my bedroom
window</b>
<br><b>in sight.&nbsp; All of a sudden I saw movement in my window; it
was a shadow in</b>
<br><b>the act of sitting on my bed.&nbsp; Once it sat down, the shadow
seemed to fade</b>
<br><b>into the shadows of my bedroom.</b>
<br><b>I stood there looking at my window and said to my mother that my
brother was</b>
<br><b>in my room and that he needs to get out.&nbsp; I immediately went
into the house</b>
<br><b>to find my brother still watching telelevision.&nbsp; I asked him
what he was</b>
<br><b>doing in my room and he just stared at me like I was crazy, saying
that he</b>
<br><b>had not left the living room.&nbsp; Of course, I went to my room
to find no one</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>We lived in that house for about two years and only when we moved
into our</b>
<br><b>new house was I able to sleep with my door closed and with my mother's
door</b>
<br><b>closed.</b>
<br><b>However, this new house was where my mother saw her first ghost.</b>
<br><b>This happened about two months after we moved into the house.&nbsp;
She said that</b>
<br><b>she was laying in bed one night, unable to sleep because the street
lights in</b>
<br><b>the city were so bright.&nbsp; She said that she looked over to
her window and saw</b>
<br><b>an old man standing in her room in front of the window.&nbsp; The
old man walked</b>
<br><b>over to the bed and looked down at her and then backed away only
to</b>
<br><b>disappear.&nbsp; She, smartly, did not tell me this story until
I had been away at</b>
<br><b>college for three years.&nbsp; We are assuming that the old man
was Mr. Barnes who</b>
<br><b>we think may have died in the house and was just checking in on
the new</b>
<br><b>occupants.&nbsp; That was the first and last incidence that occurred
in that home.</b><b></b>

<br><b>hi , im Amanda , i live in Staten Island . Around near the bay area

<br><b>. a few years ago my school was holding a brunch at the Old Bermuda
Inn . It</b>
<br><b>was just for the students in my class who had been Helping in the
Fashion</b>
<br><b>Show that year . Anyway , me and my Best friend , Kristy&nbsp; where
sitting in</b>
<br><b>the dinning area enjoying the , might i add , very very good food
. when my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend sat down at our table and dared Kristy and I to check
out the</b>
<br><b>upstairs , where i herd that on the stairs was a very active supernatural</b>
<br><b>spot . Kristy was not one who was into Paranormal yet she belived
in ghosts .</b>
<br><b>I had always been interested and involved with Paranormal things
. So me and</b>
<br><b>Kristy went upstairs and stayed there chatting while sitting on
the stairs</b>
<br><b>when i started feeling very cold . But it wasent the kind of cold
you get</b>
<br><b>from the icy wind or the temp. , it was so strange . i asked Kristy
if she</b>
<br><b>felt it and she said yes , she had felt it . I decided i was sort
of creeped</b>
<br><b>out and told her we better go . As we left i turned around to see
a faint but</b>
<br><b>clear enough to see image of a woman in a light pink dress with
light blonde</b>
<br><b>hair. She looked sort of like she wanted to leave or somthing .
me and Kristy</b>
<br><b>ran down the stairs as fast as Lightning . Im 15 now and this happend
around</b>
<br><b>the time when i was 13 . i know that it was real because iv heard
various</b>
<br><b>storys of that happening to other people . What i have not heards
about was</b>
<br><b>what happend to my friend Laurie . She was standing the the hallway
looking</b>
<br><b>at photo album with contained pictures of people getting married
in The Old</b>
<br><b>Brumuda Inn . im guessing that The woman i saw was married there
. So anyway</b>
<br><b>Laurie was there alone ( not a good idea if u ask me) and she though
she</b>
<br><b>heard a faint sound of " hear comes the bride" , she also admitted
that she</b>
<br><b>saw the windows opening and closing . Im pretty sure this did happend
though</b>
<br><b>im not positive . Yet for some reason she was hysterical crying
because she</b>
<br><b>said she had tryed to get into the dining area but the doors where
locked .</b>
<br><b>Id be crying to if that happend to me , yet i belive that what happend
with</b>
<br><b>the music was the weddings happing over and over . since iv read
and heard</b>
<br><b>that the engery trapped in a somewhat haunted house or place causes
the scene</b>
<br><b>to happen over and over . i belive thats what happend to Laurie

<br><b>Europe in World War 2 I saw Nazi soldigers take my husband and I
to a ditch</b>
<br><b>in the middle of no where, there they shot my husban .&nbsp; In
my drean I</b>
<br><b>understood German.&nbsp; Next they killed me by cutting my throught,
as I died in</b>
<br><b>my drean I woke up in real life.&nbsp; As I awoke I heard more foot
steps marching</b>
<br><b>they sounded like Soildgers, Germans I assumed.&nbsp; they marched
through my</b>
<br><b>kitchen and some by my bed room door kind of like they ware watching
me.</b>
<br><b>This is the first thing that happened to me, it didn't make sense
because i</b>
<br><b>thought they would be dead miners or something.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; About 2 years ago i became very depressed as many young
people do and I</b>
<br><b>attempted to kill my self by overdosing.&nbsp; My mother came home
from work and</b>
<br><b>found me passed out and throwing up in the kitchen sink.&nbsp; they
russhed me to</b>
<br><b>the nearest hospital where they thought I was going to die.&nbsp;
I saw my mom</b>
<br><b>crying next to me, and became relaxed.&nbsp; I was in total peace,
i felt</b>
<br><b>completly happy.&nbsp; Suddenly I Felt two men walking around me
talking, I tried</b>
<br><b>to turn my head to see them but could not.&nbsp; I heard them speaking
to each</b>
<br><b>other and one sounded older than the other, they said"look it's
so sad shes</b>
<br><b>so young" the other said "look at her mother she's so pretty" then
the other</b>
<br><b>said "their both so beautiful" at this point they quit talking and
continued</b>
<br><b>to walk around us staring.&nbsp; Then the feeling of peace was gone
and I heard</b>
<br><b>two other voices I kept saying what who is that, and i was scaring
my mom to</b>
<br><b>death.&nbsp; right after that I passed out when I woke up i was
in a hospital room</b>
<br><b>.&nbsp; I didn't tell any one exactly what it was i heard tell I
told my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>of the time.&nbsp; I'm not sure he belived me.&nbsp; After that
I wold hear voices at</b>
<br><b>my house, people talking to me but there was no one there.&nbsp;
I heard them</b>
<br><b>almost everywhere i went but i didn't tell anyone.&nbsp; After a
while I tried</b>
<br><b>talking back but never got a response.&nbsp; The voices were never
really clear</b>
<br><b>there were many at one time it just sounded mumbled. I tried not
to tell</b>
<br><b>people about my voices because I was afraid they would not talk
to me any</b>
<br><b>more, I felt I had a gift.&nbsp; They have stopped talking now.
I haven't heard</b>
<br><b>them for about a year now.&nbsp; I know it all sounds wierd but
it's true.&nbsp; I also</b>
<br><b>live next to a grave yard which is wierd I know, it's where most
of the dead</b>
<br><b>miners are buried.&nbsp; I think they try to talk to me some times.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; there is also one last account I had more recently.&nbsp;
I was trying to go</b>
<br><b>to sleep one night in the house all by myself, I looked out into
the living</b>
<br><b>room and saw a solid black figure running aroune he looked as if
he were</b>
<br><b>hiding, he ran behind furniture and walls and really just scared
the hell out</b>
<br><b>of me.&nbsp; It was the only time I saw him though. It was the last

<br><b>The Basement</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>First of all before I start this story I would like to say I am not
on any</b>
<br><b>perscription or over the counter drugs, I don't drink and am not
given to</b>
<br><b>tell stories. This is an incident that happened in my Aunts home
in Ohio.</b>
<br><b>I got the dreaded call that my grandfather had passed away of a
heart attack.</b>
<br><b>Everyone was to meet in Ohio for the funeral as most of my family
lived</b>
<br><b>there. I decided to stay at my Aunts house because we got along
so well and</b>
<br><b>so did her daughter (my cousin) and I.</b>
<br><b>I am a smoker as well as my cousin and Aunt but her husband is not
so we were</b>
<br><b>confined to the basement if we wanted to have a smoke. No problem
with me as</b>
<br><b>the basement had a couch and was heated as well. I went downstairs
with my</b>
<br><b>cousin to take a smoke and watched curiously as her dog waited at
the top of</b>
<br><b>the steps and moaned and whined. I asked her as to why her dog was
acting so</b>
<br><b>oddly (It was a big chow chow dog) and I wondered why it seemed
so afraid.</b>
<br><b>She said Oh, well, something happened to the dog one night in the
basement.</b>
<br><b>She said he always used to come down here but ever since that night
you can't</b>
<br><b>drag him down. Really I said. Why is that? She said we found him
one night</b>
<br><b>down in the basement with his collar tightened up around his neck
as if</b>
<br><b>someone had taken it and intentially tried to choke him. Really
I said to</b>
<br><b>her? Then I tried to make logical senerios as to why this may have
happened</b>
<br><b>when she told me thats not all....She said pictures sometimes fly
off the</b>
<br><b>wall and break. I myself seeing some odd things in my lifetime didn't
dismiss</b>
<br><b>the fact that she was in all probablity telling me the truth. Grandpa's</b>
<br><b>funeral was to be in two days so we were getting ready to settle
in for the</b>
<br><b>night. I put my ciggarette out in the ashtray when I noticed a stuffed
bear</b>
<br><b>with a red dress on sitting on top of the clothes basket and picked
it up. I</b>
<br><b>began teasing my cousin and punched the bear in the face a few times
and</b>
<br><b>threw it around. She said the usual phrases you hear from someone
that adores</b>
<br><b>stuffed animals "stop that!" and of course I did stop. I ended up
putting the</b>
<br><b>bear in the clothes basket face down and the both of us went back
upstairs</b>
<br><b>for bed. The house was not that big so the two of us (my cousin
and I) bunked</b>
<br><b>up together for the night. Here comes the odd part it's like straight
out of</b>
<br><b>a movie..... I woke up about 6 AM and felt the need to go take a
smoke when I</b>
<br><b>remembered that I had to go down in the basement. No big deal....our
earlier</b>
<br><b>conversation about ghost and the like was far out of my mind. I
pulled the</b>
<br><b>string for the light to come on down in the basement and walked
down the</b>
<br><b>stairs. I sat on the couch and took out a cigarette and noticed
that the bear</b>
<br><b>I had played with earlier that night was now on top of the dryer.
To my</b>
<br><b>knowledge no one had been in the basement since my cousin and I
went to bed</b>
<br><b>so I thought hmmm no big deal my Aunt or Uncle must have come down
here and</b>
<br><b>moved it. That's when I went to light my cigarette and realized
I left my</b>
<br><b>lighter on the table by the basement stairs I got up and grabbed
it and lit</b>
<br><b>my cigarette and went to sit back down on the couch (this took all
of about 3</b>
<br><b>seconds) when I went to sit down the bear in the red dress that
was on the</b>
<br><b>dryer was now sitting on the couch where I had just been sitting!
That may</b>
<br><b>not sound like a big deal to any of you but let me tell you I was
FRIGHTENED!</b>
<br><b>Something had moved that bear in all of about 2 to 3 seconds and
I was</b>
<br><b>completly alone down there! My heart was beating a mile a minute.
I remember</b>
<br><b>saying okayyyyyy and quickly putting out my cigarette and running
upstairs. I</b>
<br><b>immediatly woke up my cousin and told her what happened. She agreed
to go</b>
<br><b>downstairs with me so that I could smoke and decided to have one
too. My Aunt</b>
<br><b>does not believe me and I am not to sure my cousin does either all
though she</b>
<br><b>did say she believed me. The only thing I do know is that I did
NOT imagine</b>
<br><b>it and it DID happen. With that said I am not very likely to discredit</b>
<br><b>someone who tells a story that seems odd or out of the norm because
something</b>
<br><b>did happen to me. I often wonder was my grandpa trying to say he's
okay. If</b>
<br><b>so he could have used a better way of telling me instead of scaring
the</b>
<br><b>jeepers out of me.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for listening.</b>

<p><b>The Antique Watch</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RandJab@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have a story for your readers to ponder that still has me stumped.
Here</b>
<br><b>goes....</b>
<br><b>I enjoy going to online auctions always looking for that "perfect
bargain"</b>
<br><b>item to bid on. I began thinking to myself that I needed a watch
and how</b>
<br><b>wonderful it would be to own a solid gold ladies watch. I have never
owned</b>
<br><b>one and was in need of a watch but I digress.</b>
<br><b>One night I was online looking at items when I decided to go look
at watches,</b>
<br><b>it still burned in my mind on how I just must have a solid gold
watch and to</b>
<br><b>my surprise I spotted one that was a old antique bulova ladies watch
going</b>
<br><b>for a price that was hard to beat. Wonderful! I exclaimed, this
is my chance</b>
<br><b>to get my hearts desire, the add stated that the watch was in excellent
shape</b>
<br><b>and had been well taken care of with 17 jewels and was in fine working</b>
<br><b>condition. I placed my bid a ridiculous low price if you ask me
for a solid</b>
<br><b>gold watch. I waited to see if I would be outbid and hoped for the
best.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>won the auction to my surprise and promptly sent out the money and
waited for</b>
<br><b>my fabulous buy to arrive. I finally got it and found that it was
just as the</b>
<br><b>add said, I kept thinking how I ever got it for such a low price.
I checked</b>
<br><b>it often to make sure it was keeping time and I would always wind
it and make</b>
<br><b>sure not to "overwind" the watch as I wanted to keep it in pristeen
working</b>
<br><b>condition, it kept great time until.....</b>
<br><b>Here is the weird thing the watch works perfectly in the day time,
I would</b>
<br><b>make sure it was wound before bed so as not to lose time on the
watch. Every</b>
<br><b>morning no matter what time I would finally crawl out of bed that
watch would</b>
<br><b>be stopped on the time 3:15, I would pick it up thinking great I
got a bum</b>
<br><b>watch no wonder it was such a steal! But to my surprise it would
still be</b>
<br><b>TICKING. It was still wound and ticking but stuck on 3:15 all I
would have to</b>
<br><b>do is set it again and it would work just great throughout the day
and all</b>
<br><b>the time before I went to bed. Still every time I get up it is still
running</b>
<br><b>but stopped on 3:15, I told this to my friends and they have told
me to get</b>
<br><b>rid of it. NO WAY I would exclaim it's solid gold! The thing is
I have dreams</b>
<br><b>about this watch and am afraid to wear it to bed for fear that something</b>
<br><b>terrible will happen when the watch gets to 3:15 AM. I refuse to
wear it to</b>
<br><b>bed but on the same token refuse to quit wearing it or get rid of
it. I think</b>
<br><b>maybe the woman who owned it died at 3:15 long ago, who knows maybe
under bad</b>
<br><b>circumstances. I told this story to my father who being the realist
that he</b>
<br><b>is tried to give a mechanical explaination as to why it stops at
that time.</b>
<br><b>He says maybe the watch is on a 24 hour mechanism and one of the
small</b>
<br><b>grooves are missing and it stops on 3:15 and thats why it still
ticks but it</b>
<br><b>is just stuck. Thats all swell and a good senerio but the thing
that bothers</b>
<br><b>me is that no matter what time the watch is set to it stops at 3:15
am never</b>
<br><b>in the daytime and I have tried several experiments with it. I don't
always</b>
<br><b>go to bed at the same time so if it is on a timer of sorts and I
wind it at</b>
<br><b>different times technicly it should stop hours early or hours later
than</b>
<br><b>previous nights I have set it. Makes you wonder. All I know is I
will never</b>
<br><b>wear the blasted thing to bed. Maybe the lady who owned it didn't
want anyone</b>
<br><b>else to have it. Some great deal I got on this watch huh?!!!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Syracuse New York</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kbernardp@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had just moved into my fraternity house at the
beginning of my junior year over the summer when I first heard about the
reputation of the room I was moving into.&nbsp; Until this time I had never
experienced a haunting first hand, but the very first night moving in I
was a believer.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend Ethan and I had just moved my couch
into the room which faced down the hill and across the street.&nbsp; The
ceiling had been painted black and I remember the light fixture looking
like it had been stolen from a submarine.&nbsp; Ethan and I sat down on
the couch after getting it situated and he said "isn't this room creepy?&nbsp;
have you seen the back of your door?"&nbsp; As soon as he said that the
door closed itself to reveal a strange black painting on the back of the
door.&nbsp; Coincidence came to mind, but it still freaked me out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the course of the next two weeks and the
remainder of the summer I would come home to a locked room.&nbsp; When
I unlocked it I found my television to be on nearly every other day.&nbsp;
Because my room was deadbolted there was no way anyone could have gotten
in there to turn it on.&nbsp; At this point I thought I was prepared for
anything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One very specific recollection I have was coming
home from work one day and noticing my CD player paused ten seconds into
a song.&nbsp; I figured that I must have left for work that morning and
left it paused so I let it play.&nbsp; The song was "hallelujah" by Jeff
Buckley, a very sweet ballad written by Leonard Cohen.&nbsp; Not that I
was displeased with the selection, but I decided to go through my CD's
anyway and halfway through my stack of CD's was my only Jeff Buckley CD,
in my hand, and playing on the stereo.&nbsp; I opened up the carousel on
the CD player and it opened up with a Jamiroquai disc.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This event made me a true believer.&nbsp; Throughout
the semester I frequently saw apparitions of cats walking across my floor,
once I heard a female voice, people complained that they couldn't get through
to my phone number or that it rang and I didn't hear it, and twice I was
nudged in my bed by something.&nbsp; I know this sounds hard to believe,
but it happened.&nbsp; The amazing thing was that most of these things
only happened when I was listening to Jeff Buckley.&nbsp; Upon playing
hallelujah with no windows open the first sign of a presence would be from
my closet.&nbsp; Clothes would very very slowly and slightly sway from
left to right, but one specific sleeve would always move in an entirely
different pattern.&nbsp; The sleeve would lift and fill as if it was being
worn, but there was no shape of a body.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curiosity got the best of me by October of that
year so I decided to do some research on the house.&nbsp; I went to the
university library and asked for information on Whitman Hall (this is the
name of the dorm that the fraternity house used to be.)&nbsp; I scanned
through the student death files all afternoon until I found something on
Whitman..&nbsp; The building itself used to be located where the library
now stands.&nbsp; It was moved up to the hill on Comstock Avenue sometime
after the university bought the 100 block of Walnut Park to build the library.&nbsp;
At this time Whitman hall became a women's dorm after serving as a sorority
house for several years.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was all the information I could find on
the building itself.&nbsp; So I went through the student death files as
suggested by the librarian to see if there might be any explanation there
for any hauntings.&nbsp; What I found there scared the hell out of me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a section of newspaper clippings about
a student suicide on campus.&nbsp; This isn't a very common thing at this
school.&nbsp; In the four years I've been here very few reported cases
of student suicide have been brought to my attention.&nbsp; Because of
this the article itself was very extensive including interviews of witnesses.&nbsp;
The story goes as follows.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennifer was apparently a shy girl with good
grades and an even better reputation.&nbsp; Apparently she had told friends
of hers that she was planning to go home one weekend and then never came
back.&nbsp; Nobody saw her leave, her room was locked and no questions
were asked about her because everyone had assumed she had taken a longer
than normal leave.&nbsp; She never went home.&nbsp; Two weeks after she
had left for home a member of the fraternity next door noticed through
the third floor window a hanging figure.&nbsp; Officials opened her door
and found her hanging from a drain pipe that still goes across the ceiling
of the room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She grew up locally so her parents opted to bury
her in the large cemetery located just north of campus.&nbsp; I had the
opportunity to visit her grave and I know this sounds strange, but I feel
that during the time I spent in that room I came to befriend Jennifer.&nbsp;
She was so reliable at times that I could consistently say almost jokingly
"okay, Jennifer I have to wake up at 9 tomorrow or I'm in big trouble."&nbsp;
Whenever I made any statement like that she never let me down.... not once.&nbsp;
I would feel a tap or some kind of energy waking me up.&nbsp; The story
goes on and on...&nbsp; Even after I moved out of that room and went downstairs
I could feel her there at times.&nbsp; Almost protecting me or watching
out for me like a good friend.&nbsp; I would stay up and talk to her (lightly
so that nobody outside could hear me talking to the 'ghost') and maybe
it was just a meditational thing, but I always felt better after our little
discussions even though I was the only one talking.&nbsp; Like I said,
I only heard what I thought was her voice once.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just a short description of the events
that took place living with Jennifer, and of course, I am not the only
witness.&nbsp; I tell very few people about the story only for the reason
that I don't want to give the impression of lost sanity, but I'll never
say I don't believe in ghosts again.&nbsp; Besides, everyone needs a friend..&nbsp;
even ghosts.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Strange Happenings</b><b></b>

<p><b>The house in which I grew up in always had strange unexplained things</b>

several</b>

<br><b>Topsy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jessikat@excite.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi. I am twenty years old and have had many ghostly experiences.
My parents</b>
<br><b>like to visit historic places while on vacation, so I have been
to many</b>
<br><b>historically haunted places. I have felt cold spots in these places
when no</b>
<br><b>one else did and watched as a rocking chair rocked by itself in
one Monterey</b>
<br><b>home. But my favorite experience would have to be the time a ghost
talked to</b>
<br><b>me.</b>
<br><b>My mom wanted to visit the hometown of her father, Canton, Mississippi.
Last</b>
<br><b>summer we stayed a couple of days in the town searching for her
father's old</b>
<br><b>farm. We stayed in a bed and breakfast that was built in 1852 by
the local</b>
<br><b>doctor. During the home's long life it housed Confederate soldiers
in a</b>
<br><b>hidden underground basement room and was added on to many times,
though</b>
<br><b>ownership of the house stayed in the family up until very recent.
The house</b>
<br><b>even still has the original slave quarters and slave stairs. Needless
to</b>
<br><b>say, this house had a lot of history, and I was worried when I found
out</b>
<br><b>that we were staying there. I was even more worried when the present
owner</b>
<br><b>of the home told us about their ghost, since I seem to be receptive
to them.</b>
<br><b>She said that the ghost's name was Topsy - who was the wife of the
first</b>
<br><b>owner of the home - and that she was a nice, friendly ghost. She
said that</b>
<br><b>she had not experienced Topsy yet (they had only recently purchased
the</b>
<br><b>home) but past owners of the home had.</b>
<br><b>Our first night sleeping there, two strange things happened to me.
Before</b>
<br><b>going to sleep, I went the huge stairs to get a bottle of water
from the</b>
<br><b>fridge. Before I got the bottom, my right foot seemed to kick my
left foot -</b>
<br><b>as if someone kicked it from behind - and I fell down the last two
stairs</b>
<br><b>onto my side (a way I don't usually fall). I frightened my parents
(who were</b>
<br><b>staying in a room on the first floor) when they heard my loud fall
echo up</b>
<br><b>the huge staircase. That shook me up a bit, but I didn't think of
it as</b>
<br><b>being ghost related (I am a complete klutz all of the time so it
didn't</b>
<br><b>surprise me that I fell down the stairs!) After I got the water,
I went back</b>
<br><b>upstairs. We turned out the lights and I tried to go to sleep. I
didn't</b>
<br><b>sleep more than fifteen minutes that night. I kept having this feeling
that</b>
<br><b>something was in the window in front of the bed and I found myself</b>
<br><b>continually waking up and staring at it. I never saw anything but
I also</b>
<br><b>didn't have my glasses or contacts on and can hardly see without
them. That</b>
<br><b>night was very long!</b>
<br><b>The next day I was exhausted but couldn't take a nap due to the
extereme</b>
<br><b>heat. By the time night rolled around I was more than ready to sleep.
I had</b>
<br><b>told my sister and best friend about my night and my ideas about
where the</b>
<br><b>ghost was mainly found (the owner of the house wouldn't tell us
due to worry</b>
<br><b>of frightening us). They were in the same room as I and got a little
freaked</b>
<br><b>out by what I told them. I was feeling very calm and tired when
we finally</b>
<br><b>turned out the lights and slept wonderfully. My sister and best
friend did</b>
<br><b>not sleep well, and both complained of waking up a lot later on.
I woke up</b>
<br><b>around 5am (I looked at the clock) the following morning and was
laying</b>
<br><b>there thinking about how nice it was since we were going home that
day. We</b>
<br><b>had been on vacation for two weeks by then so I was ready to go.
Suddenly,</b>
<br><b>after thinking about home, something said very clearly in my ear
or head,</b>
<br><b>"Come Back." I instantly rolled over to my friend who was sharing
the bed</b>
<br><b>with me and asked her, "What did you say?" She woke up then and
looked at me</b>
<br><b>very confused and said, "Nothing." I rolled back over and felt as
if someone</b>
<br><b>was standing right next to me and that someone had a very happy
aura. I went</b>
<br><b>back to sleep for the next couple of hours smiling. When I finally
got up</b>
<br><b>that morning and told the owner of my experience she was very excited.
She</b>
<br><b>confirmed my belief that the ghost did stay mainly in the room we
slept in,</b>
<br><b>and even said that people have seen her from the outside in a window</b>
<br><b>upstairs...the window that I kept staring at the night before. I
think Topsy</b>
<br><b>may have been testing me out or something, since no one in the new
owner's</b>
<br><b>family had really experienced anything like I had. Perhaps they
have had</b>
<br><b>some new ones with her by now. I just hope she doesn't trip everone
who</b>
<br><b>tries to go down those huge stairs!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Thanksgiving Day</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: myq13@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>Thanksgiving day my wife and I were preparing dinner, and waiting
for our quests to arrive.&nbsp; We had lit soem incense in the living room.&nbsp;
I was in the bedroom, my wife was in the kitchen and she called out to
me to "come look at this".&nbsp; I came out into the living room and saw
what can be described as a smoke tentacle (similar to the water Tentacle
in The Abyss) rising up from the incense stick, and reaching across the
room at eye level.&nbsp; The smoke was just collecting there, and thickening,
instead of dispersing as normal.&nbsp; I wanted to see it from my wife's
perspective, but to do so I had to walk through the smoke.&nbsp; It was
very cold, but I wasn't frightened at all.&nbsp; When I got to her on the
other side, we watched the smoke for a good 5 minutes as it moved about
the room, as we started into it we could see facial features appear and
disappear.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Childhood</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mudpie1@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a lot of interest in the paranormal and the supernatural,
though I</b>
<br><b>don't "mess around" with things like Ouija boards. I don't know
if I've</b>
<br><b>ever seen a ghost, but I have had a few strange things happen to
me that</b>
<br><b>I thought I would share.</b>
<br><b>When I was just a small baby, not even able to walk yet, my parents
were</b>
<br><b>very poor and we lived in a house with another family. One day everyone
was</b>
<br><b>off the property except for my father, who was outside chopping
wood, and</b>
<br><b>me, asleep upstairs in my crib. My father came inside and walked
past the</b>
<br><b>kitchen doorway when he heard me cry. He walked back to the kitchen
and saw</b>
<br><b>me there, standing upright support myself on a chair. What he was
curious</b>
<br><b>about was how I had managed to get out of my crib and opens doors
and come</b>
<br><b>downstairs and get through rooms all by myself. Years later, when
I was old</b>
<br><b>enough to talk, my parents asked me more than once how I got downstairs,
and</b>
<br><b>I always gave one of two answers: "I flew," or "The lady brought
me." My</b>
<br><b>memory is not very good from that age, but I have a vague feeling
of that</b>
<br><b>day and not being afraid of the woman who picked me up. My parents
tell me</b>
<br><b>the story of the house as they know it is that way back when the
house was</b>
<br><b>originally built, the wife of the builder died (natural causes)
and she was</b>
<br><b>buried in the cellar (presumably back when it was still legal to
do so.) She</b>
<br><b>was never a frightening spirit to anyone who felt her, and my godmother
said</b>
<br><b>she actually felt safer that babies in the house had another person
to watch</b>
<br><b>over them.</b>
<br><b>Another experience happened a few years later when I was between
3 and 4.</b>
<br><b>This one I personally remember well. One night I was sleeping in
an upstairs</b>
<br><b>bedroom of a different house when I woke up to hear noises and light
coming</b>
<br><b>from downstairs. I got out of bed and went to the staircase, and
as I was</b>
<br><b>about to start walking down my feet raised about 2 inches off of
the floor.</b>
<br><b>I reached out to the banister for support and floated down the stairs,</b>
<br><b>coming back down to the floor only as the stairs made a turn into
the room</b>
<br><b>at the bottom of them. A short time later (I was still not yet 4)
I wanted</b>
<br><b>to try to fly again but all I got was a depression skull fracture.</b>
<br><b>The last thing I have to tell you is the first physical phenomena
I have</b>
<br><b>felt in a long time; it was less than a week ago. I was sleeping
in my dorm</b>
<br><b>room here at college when I felt violently, physically shaken, as
if someone</b>
<br><b>had grabbed my shoulder and shook. I woke up thinking someone had
somehow</b>
<br><b>gotten in and needed to tell me something, but no one was there.
My door was</b>
<br><b>still locked. I kinda joked about how my room is now haunted, and
even</b>
<br><b>though I don't really think it is, I wonder what that was that woke
me up.</b>
<br><b>Those are my stories, and you can put them on the website if you
like.</b>
