<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
am currently residing in a town called Loganville, Georgia. Last night
I was at
a friends house and her son came home with a buddy saying that when
they went
down there and the frame of the house was there and they saw a ghost
girl
running after them. Well the son took off like a bat outta hell in his
truck
and when his buddy looked back it was gone. They went to Alcovy
cemetary where
the family is buried, stating that the ground was sinking in and there
were
cold spots. I told them to never go back there because its too close to
the
equinox to be messing with spirits, especially restless ones like the
murdered
family of Jack Pittman. Not to mention I bet some of his evil lingers
there and
it always will. I do not believe it is guarded, because I have rode by
there
once during the day, and even then it gave me the creeps. You have to
post this
in your haunted places index. Also there is a confederate cemetary is
Resaca,
Georgia that is worth mentioning. The way the cemetary is set up, the
graves
are in circles, not rows, that get bigger as they go out. I would
compare it to
the shape of a bullseye. Well when you take pictures, there are SO MANY
orbs and
when you take pictures of the graves they do not show up in photos.
This place
is definitely haunted as well. I had a strong urge to just get the hell
outta
there, feeling that our presence wasnt wanted.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
have had a personal experience my girlfriend and I have lived there
four years
from 2004-2008. My girlfriend and I have both seen the ghost of the
little girl,
and have had experiences. One night after watching The Grudge, we went
to bed,
had everything off and then we heard footsteps, and a strange noise,
she was
mimicking the noise the boy made on the movie scared us both. We have
even
heard her laugh and her cry. It was a strange experience but pretty
cool. Other
tenants there have also had experiences, doors closing, things moving
and
hearing her.</big></p>

St. Andrews Parsonage</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>hi
this is about the house for the St Andrews church in Goodrich WI , we
are the
former owners for 19 years and had several strange things happen while
living
there. the church got the place in 1903 and I guess then there was a
stick
built home built on the site and it was also used for the church&nbsp;
and school on a 1/2&nbsp; lot on the south east corner and across the
road there is 10 acres were the graveyard and ball field and the new
church and
parsonage was built in 76. on august 17 1935 the house was hit by a
twister and
vaporized, I seen a photo, nothing left but splinters. I was told by
members
that it was hit twice and once it was pushed of the foundation once by
3 feet.
the place was rebuilt using a $100 worth of used donated bricks&nbsp;
and a new pastor came he was told the place
was done and he got up here and it wasn't done , no inside walls and no
windows
and the argument started , the new pastor wasn't a happy camper. we got
the
place in 89 , the wife was the first one she was in the basement doing
wash and
she seen a pair of green eyes glowing down there and I have sensed that
there
was someone or thing in the place from time to time that was angry,
there was a
lot of banging and slamming and pounding going on over the years and
then I
heard footsteps late at night on several occasions and the last time
was a few
weeks before Easter , as clear as a bell I heard someone come in the
front door
into what was the pastors study, stomp across the floor into the
dinning room ,
then into the kitchen, back to the study and then up the stairs to the
second
floor. I called out to the wife is that you walking&nbsp; I got no
answer and the footsteps stopped. I
was napping on the couch facing the back of it , with a cat and I had
shut off the
TV a few minutes earlier , I got up and checked around the wife was in
bed with
the other cat asleep what ever was walking had two legs I looked around
it was
after midnight I didn't see nothing , no shadows or mists or orbs. also
one
summer a friends mothers grave had a large pine next to it and lighting
hit it
and split it in half and his dad&nbsp; died 3
or 4 days after that now we have sold the place and moved out , and
went
traveling with our camper and stayed by southern Wisconsin for the
summer and
moved back up north to Ogema Wisconsin , we have rented a old house in
town and
the other tenets stayed 2 months and moved out we again for the month
of
September have been waking up at 4:45 am or so several times to the
smell of
fresh brewed coffee , coffee and French toast and maple syrup and one
great
smelling breakfast casserole and then someone kicked the bed in the
night.&nbsp; and I heard the cellar door close twice at
night too,i forgot to put the lock on it. i told who ever it was to
stop
cooking ya never put none on the table for us and we dont get up that
early
anyway and none of our food is missing . it now seems to have stop as
of this
date.....</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Murder</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lao4po420@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>There's
a house in NJ that has quite a sorted past. The oldest house on the
street, and
one of the oldest in its neighborhood, was owned by an old lady in the
40's who
rented some rooms out, like a boarding house I guess. In one case, a
man
renting one of them kidnapped a young boy from the "Strawberry Hill"
section of Woodbridge and brought him back to that house. He killed the
young
boy just before police arrived. As I heard it, police stormed the house
and
shot him, but I've also heard he killed himself. A friend of mine lived
in the
house back in the early 1970's and I stayed over and saw the ghost of
young boy
in her mother's sewing room. I came to find out, this was the room the
murder
had taken place in.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Scaring
Ghost </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; raesrose@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When
I was a young single parent I lived for a while in a small house
adjacent to
Owens Farm (Owens Country Sausage) in Richardson, Texas.&nbsp; Being a
sensitive, I would feel things pass
through frequently.&nbsp; I worked nights on
the computer, and had my back to the door.&nbsp;
I would frequently feel "things" peek in on me or try to scare
me.&nbsp; One night, one of these things snuck
into the room instead of staying at the door, and crept up behind my
chair.&nbsp; Irked, I decided the turn the
tables and without physically turning around, in my mind I turned my
head
completely around and made a scary monster face and yelled BOO!&nbsp;
Believe it or not, it worked.&nbsp; I think the poor thing went Poof!
or melted
into ectoplasm because it was instantly gone and the atmosphere in the
house
was completely different.&nbsp; I think it worked
because I didn't have time to get scared, I just reacted, and whatever
it was
must have been fairly benign.</big></p>

of Wolfe Woods </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
 href="mailto:ghostgoddess1@yahoo.com">ghostgoddess1@yahoo.com</a> </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Our
house was just down from what we called Dead Mans Curve. There were a
lot of
accidents there, usually in the Spring, and Winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the spring of 1963 about 3:30 AM we all
were woke by a woman screaming "Help Me, Help Me " My Mother,&nbsp;
Grandparents, and myself all met in the living
room. The woman's voice was very loud, we all assumed there had been
another
car accident up on the curve. It was extremely foggy that night, so
much so you
could not see more than four to five feet in front of you. My
Grandfather
grabbed a flashlight, and headed out to the woods across the road to
search for
the woman in distress. In the mean time she is still screaming "Help Me
" My mother called my uncle who lived just down the road. He too joined
in
the search, and heard the woman's screams. After a good 15 minutes my
Grandfather came back, to call the County Sheriff's Dept to send a car
out. One
car came, then two, then three. They combed the woods, in search of the
woman's
voice that slowly became weaker &amp; weaker, finally as the sun came
up, her
voice had completely faded. They never found her, a car, or any
evidence of any
kind. I remember standing in our driveway hearing the police officers
telling
my grandfather, that this was best kept quiet, not to tell anyone,
because no
one would believe this. They decided they were not going to file a
report, even
though they too had heard the screams.&nbsp;
My grandfather searched that woods every day for weeks to see if he
could find any signs of any kind, but nothing was ever found. We moved
out of
that area in 1976 after my grandmother died, and I often wonder if the
people
that live in the old brick house ever hear the screams of an unknown
woman on
foggy spring nights.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>2005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35
Years Later</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It
was late October 1970, Halloween was only a few days away. I had woke
up
feeling a bit odd, I couldn't quite put my finger on what was bothering
me,
but&nbsp; as the day went on I became more
worried, and anxious.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother was in
the kitchen doing dishes, and I went out to talk with her, about how
strange I
was feeling, she told me it was nothing more than me being pregnant,
and that
sometimes pregnant women just get those weird feelings, from all the
hormonal
changes going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I insisted this was
not the problem, I told her I &nbsp;was
afraid, but I didn't know what I was afraid of, I just felt like
something bad
was going to happen,&nbsp; she laughed, and
told me nothing bad was going to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As the day went on the fear grew,&nbsp;
I became a real mess, and begged my mother not to go to work that
night.
Once again she told me I was being silly, and to knock it off,&nbsp;
she said she was not going to take off
work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was close to tears when it was
time for her to leave at 11:30 PM that night. I didn't know what I was
afraid
of, but it was a feeling of dread &amp; fear I had never experienced
before. &nbsp;&nbsp;I walked my mother out to the car, thru the
breezeway to the attached garage, as she pulled out of the garage, I
pulled the
garage door down, and locked it. I then went through the house,&nbsp;
locked all the doors, pulled down all the
windows and locked them, I put the chain lock on the basement door,
checked on
my grandmother, who was sleeping in her room, with our dog Happy laying
at the
foot of her bed. My daughter was sleeping in my bed, and I decided to
call one
of my girlfriends since I was too afraid to go to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While I was on the phone, I noticed the
wind had picked up, and started to rain, I could hear the autumn leaves
rustling about, and the branches of the shrubs rubbing against my
bedroom
window . I continued talking with my friend, and asked her if she could
come
out, but her husband was not home from work yet, so she didn't have a
way to
get there. At that moment I saw a shadow of a person's head go past the
window,
I told my friend,&nbsp; she said it was
probably nothing more than shadows from the branches blowing in the
wind. I
said, "ya you are right, I am just letting my imagination run wild
here" but I did tell her if I scream she was to either call my Uncle
who
lived down the road, or call the sheriffs department, she laughed said
ok, and
asked for my Uncle's phone number.&nbsp; Right
after I gave her the phone number, I heard someone walking in the
bathroom,
which was right next to my bedroom. It spooked me a bit, but figured it
was my
grandmother. I decided to check to make sure, as soon as I opened my
door, I
could see my grandmother and Happy were still laying in the exact same
spot
when I first &nbsp;&nbsp;went to my room. I walked
in to the bathroom, nothing was there, I looked out the window, and saw
it was
still raining. Everything seemed fine, I went back to my room, picked
up the
phone, told my friend " that was weird, Grandma and Happy are laying in
the same exact positions, neither one have moved" &nbsp;Right after I
told her that, I heard the foot
steps in the bathroom again! About that time my 12 month old daughter
woke up,
I told my friend to hang on, I was going back to the bathroom, I took
my
daughter by the hand, as we walked into the bathroom. I noticed the
shower
curtain was moving, and the bathroom window was wide open, even the
storm
window that had been locked! I wanted to scream, but knew I had to stay
calm
not to scare my little girl, so I said "OK honey there's nothing in
here,
let's got back to bed" we walked out, and as soon as I got around the
cornor, and into the room I slammed the bedroon door closed, and
screamed
"someone's in the house call the police!" Naturally that scared my
baby girl, she crawled up on the bed, scurried to the cornor up against
the
headboard, </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>she
was sitting there crying. About that time the door knob started
turning, I
threw myself against the door trying to keep the intruder out, and was
screaming "he is trying to get in here" I was terrified for my baby
and myself, and unborn child. I thought I had a pretty good chance of
holding
him off, since the glass door knob had fell off some time ago, and it
was quite
tricky to get the door open from the outside. Well I was wrong! The
door was
opening, I was using all my strength to push the door closed, but I
couldn't
hold! The door was open about 6 to 8 inches, and then this great force
pushed
so hard I slid 7 feet across the hard wood floor, I ran to the window,
fliped
the lock, opened the window, screaming bloody murder, when I was hit in
the
face with this bright light that blinded me! I was hysterical now!&nbsp;
I then heard my uncle's voice, I screamed
"He's in here" my uncle crawled through the bedroom window, and
didn't see anyone in the room. He said he had been trying to get in the
house
but everything was locked up. I kept saying "he's in here" My uncle
and I then search the whole house, closets, under beds, and every
cornor,
basement..nothing was there. &nbsp;We walk
back to towards the hall, and bedrooms, and there was my grandma &amp;
the dog
laying in the exact same place still sleeping! They never moved! We
went back
towards my room, there in the doorway was a 12 to 18 inch high perfect
cone
shaped pile of black, loamy, dry dirt, that felt like no dirt I have
ever felt
before! I asked my uncle "How did that get there, and what is it?" he
said it looked like dirt, and was quite puzzled how it got there. He
then said
if I was you I would sweep it up and throw it in the trash. I asked him
to
spend the night, but he refused and said everything was fine, and I
didn't need
to be worried! Ya, &nbsp;Right! As he was
getting ready to leave, my girlfriend and her husband pulled in the
driveway. I
was so glad they came out, and stayed until my Mother got home from
work.&nbsp; The strange thing is it had been raining all
night, and there were no traces of mud anywhere in the house. The
bathroom
window that had been opened was closed and locked when my uncle checked
the
bathroom. It could only be locked from the inside. My grandmother and
dog never
woke once during any of this. Happy was a collie shepard mix, and was a
protective watch dog! My girlfriend did call my uncle, and came out as
soon as
her husband got home from work, she heard&nbsp;
my screams..they both saw the cone shaped dirt in my doorway... What
was
this unseen force? Where did that strange silky dirt come from? When I
was
holding the door shut, and it was starting to open, why didn't I see
anyone's
hands? How was I pushed 7 feet across the floor with such great force?
This has
always been a mystery to me. Many strange things happened at the house
here in
Granger before and after that, but this one has always bugged me the
most!&nbsp; </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My
Ghost Story 1 Of &nbsp;Many</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
smoothartistry@hotmail.com&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A
while ago, when I was about 15 years old, I dozed off on the very
comfortable
couch on our sunporch while watching tv.&nbsp;
I woke up after about an hour and looked out the door to the backyard
and saw a tall, dark shadowy figure standing, looking into the window
on the
door (it was one of those doors where half is window).&nbsp; I didn't
see a face, let alone eyes, just a
black mass that looked like the shape of a big man.&nbsp; I was
experiencing sleep paralysis at the
time so I was unable to get up, or even make a noise, not that it would
matter,
i was home alone.&nbsp; I looked at the other
end of the couch and saw a bright light.&nbsp;
It didn't exactly make me calm, although I got the feeling it was there
to protect me.&nbsp; Neither the shadow or the
light moved, they just stood motionless.&nbsp;
I felt the only way to escape this was to ignore it and fall back to
sleep, so I did.&nbsp; When I woke up 20
minutes later there was nothing in the window or at the other end of
the
couch.&nbsp; I realized I needed to let our
dog out since it had been a while so I called her to the front door and
let her
do what she needed to do.&nbsp; I looked across
the street and saw the shadow again.&nbsp; I
know it wasn't a person because people walk up and down our street all
the time
and this was just not the same.&nbsp; I
blinked my eyes and then it was gone.&nbsp; I
hadn't experienced this again until very recently. My sister asked me
to dogsit
for a couple weeks while she was away for job training.&nbsp; The dogs
had a very strict schedule.&nbsp; They had to eat breakfast at about
8am, and
go for a 2 mile walk by 9am. I'm the type to sleep til about 10a so
during this
time I found myself taking lots of naps.&nbsp;
One day I woke from my nap it was about 11a, again experiencing sleep
paralysis.&nbsp; She has glass sliding doors
that lead out to a deck and then to the backyard.&nbsp; I was facing
the glass doors when I woke and
saw the same dark figure that I saw 10 years earlier at my mother's
house.&nbsp; This time there was no bright light.&nbsp; It was a rainy
day and I thought it couldn't
be the same experience again, I must be dreaming, the dogs didn't seem
phased
by the dark man standing at the door. &nbsp;Maybe its the neighbor,
maybe its the handyman
(yes, my sister has a handyman.) but it wasn't.&nbsp;
The figure just faded away.&nbsp; I
don't remember anything after that, I must have drifted off to sleep.&nbsp;
When I woke it was time for the dogs to go
outside so reluctantly I went to the sliding doors to let the dogs out
and
neither of them would go.&nbsp; They seemed to
be afraid of something.&nbsp; From then on
when the dogs followed me to the bathroom (the shower was in the
bathroom in my
sister's room) they always seemed to be agitated by something.&nbsp;
Still not sure what though.&nbsp; And my sister hasn't noticed anything
strange.&nbsp; Could something or someone be
following me???</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Unusual
Incident</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp; vktackett@hotmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
was just reading some of the stories in my area on your website and
thought
that I would share one of my own.&nbsp; I
attended college at EKU in Richmond, KY and lived in the dorm called
McGregor
Hall for 3 years.&nbsp; I lived in several
rooms in different parts of the building during my 3 years there and
heard the
exact same noises in each room I lived in.&nbsp;
There were often the sounds of people walking in heels, it sounded like
large groups of girls were walking in the stairwell in heels, which
wouldn't be
unheard of in a girls dorm.&nbsp; But it was
all the time during quite times in the dorm, who could walk that much
at all
hours of the day and night?&nbsp; I would also
hear what sounded like what I would describe as a bag of marbles being
dumped
out onto the floor.&nbsp; It would be really
loud and would soften as the marbles began to slow and scatter.&nbsp;
Again, I heard the same noises in all of the
rooms I lived in while staying in the dorms, I lived in three different
rooms
in different areas/floors of the dorm.&nbsp;
The only other experience I had was one time at the end of the semester
I was packing my stuff to leave for the summer.&nbsp;
Most of my stuff was already packed in boxes and nearly all of the
people had already left for home.&nbsp; In our
rooms there was a long wooden shelf that ran the length of the wall
above our
beds and I had laid a marker on the shelf beside me to use to write on
my
boxes.&nbsp; I looked over and the marker was
rolling side-to-side on the self by itself.&nbsp;
I hadn't just used it or laid it down, which is what make it an unusual
incident to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Storm
Lake, IA - Swope Hall Haunting</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp; schmmeg@bvu.edu</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi!
I've been reading your site for some time, and I noticed the
information on a
haunting of Swope Hall at Buena Vista University listed on your site.
I'm a
resident of Swope Hall and I figured that, in the interest of you
providing the
most accurate &nbsp;information possible, you
might want to know that the story of "Mary Swope" &nbsp;going insane
and leaping out of the window of
her house (and now haunting the residence hall) was completely
fabricated by
several students. (There's an article dealing the whole caper here:
https://bvu.edu/bvbriefs/fall_2009/detail.dot?id=124557 ) (It's also
worth
noting that very few, if any, of &nbsp;the
rooms in the hall have closet doors, although it looks like they did at
one
time, since there's hinges still.) There was probably never a house
here; the
land was owned by the university already, it seems, and the hall was
built
after H.E. Swope donated the money to build the hall.&nbsp; This isn't
to say that the hall isn't
haunted, just probably not by this Mary figure. Like it says, people
are afraid
of the third floor of Swope, and the hall in general is rather creepy,
especially at night. I've returned to my room several times to find the
door unlocked,
and while my first instinct isn't to blame it on a ghost, it's hard to
believe
that I've forgotten so many times. :-P Things such as weird drafts,
creaking
sounds, </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>etc,
all that standard ghostly stuff. It's a rather old building - it's been
here since
the 1940s. &nbsp;There have been some other
stories of hauntings on campus, other than McAllister Cottage - Lage
Hall
(haven't heard any stories of this, although like it says in the
article, it
could be that people were just creeped out by being there at night),
Schaller
Memorial Chapel (supposedly hearing voices), and Edson Hall (more
voices,
pianos being played, and strange whooshing sounds in the vents). Edson
Hall is
the music hall and I'll admit that it's super-mega-creepy; I feel like
something's watching me when I'm upstairs in the practice rooms.&nbsp;
Make of this information what you will. :-P
Keep up the good work!</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunting
in Louisville KY</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp; kbear_04401@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi,
I came across your website looking for some information about an
experience I had
when I was in high school in Louisville KY. I just feel I need to tell
this
story to someone as it still haunts me to this day. My family was
looking for a
house and for fun one weekend we decided to visit an open house for a
historic
house that was for sale, the house is called Hayfield. While touring
the house
we went to one of the attic rooms and when I went towards a corner of
the room
I felt a coldness and an overwhelming sense of malevolence. I was
scared and I
told my dad that we had to get out of there and get out now. He said my
face
was white and I was nearly shaking. I will never forget that day. In
talking
with others at my school about this I heard others had experienced
something
similar. I would be interested in ever hearing if anyone else has had a
similar
experience with this house.&nbsp; It is on the
National Register of Historic Places. The people who originally built
and lived
in the house were confederate supporters during the Civil War. I don't
know
much more about it than that but I intend to do more research. I have
had some
other paranormal experiences but they were much more genial and
mischievous
than anything else, I have never before or since felt a spirit that I
felt
wished me harm like that. Thank you for being there to hear these
stories.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp; darkened_raven@hotmail.com </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>First
time I can recall anything happening was when I was 4 or so years old.
We used
to live in Oamaru, which is a small town of about 12, 000 people about
an hour
and a half north of Dunedin. Our house was up the top of a hill and
fairly
rural, the back of our property backed onto what I can only assume was
a
paddock of gorse, or at least a huge area of it. As far as I'm aware
there were
no neighbours living up that way, we also lived next to a sheep paddock
that
had gaps into the gorse as well. Our back door had a ramp that led very
close
to the gate that led to the backyard, though there was very little
seperating
the backyard from the empty gorse paddock. When I was little I would
always get
this feeling of utter dread about going anywhere near that back section
as soon
as it even started getting dark, to the point where if we were getting
home
late from anywhere I would always just climb up the middle of the ramp
instead
of going anywhere near the back section. I never knew why it terrified
me so
much, but it's left me with a lasting fear of what I can't see. When I
was 5 or
so, I suddenly developed a fear of my closet. It would never close
properly,
and would just swing open on its own. Wasn't very big, but seemed to
connect up
to the attic by a manhole, and I never felt comfortable going near it.
Didn't
ever see anything though, not at that house. We moved down to Dunedin
when I
was 8 and for the first couple of years everything was okay, but when I
was
about 10 I started getting spooked going through the hallway and
livingroom to
get through to the bathroom at night. I would always sprint through to
the
bathroom, and then back to my room and wouldn't be able to relax for a
good
half an hour afterwards. I just felt like I was being watched and
followed, the
feeling was that if I slowed down at all I would be attacked by
something. I
could not sleep in my bedroom at the time unless I was completely
covered by my
blankets. It was always colder than the rest of the house, and I never
felt
comfortable in there without a light on or someone else in the room.
When I was
about 13 I started suffering from depression and still slept in that
room. One
night I recall waking up because my leg was freezing, I uncovered
myself to
discover that it had been pulled out between the slats of the bed (very
awkward
to get my foot out of there on its own, involves a lot of twisting and
squeezing) by what looked like a hulking 6 foot shadow of something
with horns
that was sitting on the end of my bed. I covered myself up, pulled my
leg back
up as fast as it could, and began screaming. My room and my mother's
was only
seperated by about half an inch of MDF and yet she didn't wakeup at all
from me
screaming for an hour solid. I eventually fell asleep. In the morning I
had a
handshaped bruise on my leg where the creature had pulled me out by. I
was
never comfortable in that room to begin with, and after that point I
had to
sleep with the main lights on, not just a bedside light (which had been
turned
off on that night by something). Closet didn't shut properly in that
room
either and I felt like I was being watched from the gap (it had two
sliding
doors that the natural wood's patterns had made to look like it was
covered in
faces of people screaming, and even an evil monk ie the robes and a
malicious
looking face). After then the room was colder, and my bed would shake
randomly.
Even now it's still the coldest room in my mother's house despite
getting most
of the afternoon sun. &nbsp;&nbsp;While my mother
and her husband were renovating the house they found a hearth, part of
a thigh
bone, and the top of a broken porcelin gollywog doll under the lounge
floor.
The house was built sometime between 1900 and 1908. At the time we had
to run
around the outside of the house to get to the bathroom, and so one time
after
coming back to the bedroom, my step-sister and I were just entering
back into
our front door, when out of nowhere a man appeared on the street just
outside
the gate. Scared us enough that we didn't make that trip again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of this year I moved into a flat
with my fiance, and a few weird things have happened since. &nbsp;Mostly,
its going through the kitchen which
has one entire wall covered in floor to ceiling windows that opens up
into the
backyard which is accessable from a street above ours, and the street
we're on.
I can't walk through there at night, I have to run and always feel like
I'm
being watched, unfortunately the bathroom is through there and I'm
pregnant so
needing to do it rather often. Coming back through I have noticed a
shadow
figure that will bolt through into the hallway, and occasionally little
blue
balls of light. It makes the hackles on my neck rise, and I don't feel
comfortable til I'm back in the bedroom I share with my fiance. Lately
I've
been hearing strange noises. It's not unheard of in this house because
we have
a possum in our ceiling space, however the noises I hear have been
coming from
my room upstairs which is being used as storage. I keep hearing sounds
like
things being knocked over, or rustling. Originally I just thought my
flatmate's
kitten had gotten in and was causing a ruckus, but every time I go up
to check
there is nothing in there and nothing has been disturbed. Its happened
several
times, and my fiance has heard it too. We're not sure whats going on,
but he's
definitely got a few stories of his own to do with the supernatural.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Salt
Lake City Area 51</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:
djlaurenx@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
read the existing description of Area51 and would like to clarify a
couple
things and add to it. I was an employee at Area51 and would clean the
entire
building on Saturdays. This building is very old. &nbsp;It was first a
mink farm. It was also the
first building in the state to ever show porn films. It has been
various strip
and night clubs until it became Area51. To clear up the girl's death,
it was by
anurism but for some reason the story keeps being told as cocaine or
drug overdose.
There was also another death of a male patron on the 1st (main) floor
by
overdose.&nbsp; I've had 2 personal
experiences while working there. They both happened upstairs. Once I
was
cleaning the womens bathroom (where the girl died). The way it is
constructed
is that there is no entrance door you get an echo of any movement or
people
that can travel into the bathroom. While cleaning in there, I heard a
barstool
being shuffled and moved around on the wood floor outside the bathroom
entrance. I thought it was the maintenence man. I went out there a
minute
later, and nobody was around. I looked out the windows to see who was
parked
outside since there is usually only 1 or 2 others in the building as I
clean.
NOBODY was parked out there. I was not aware I had been alone until
that time
(sometimes they leave to get supplies). &nbsp;&nbsp;Another time I was
upstairs cleaning the
juice bar area and I heard my name being called by a man's voice. I
looked
around and nobody was there. Also to note, these older buildings around
downtown salt lake are all connected by underground tunnels that are
boarded up
or barred. Area51 has an access point in the basement. There have been
reports
of noises, creepy feelings and of being pushed when one is in the
basement.
It's not a pleasant place. A bartender has reported to a local
publication that
he was stocking shelves alone one night and was standing on a ladder.
He looked
down to see the apparition of a pair of bare feet walking toward him.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>True
Stories - Elementary School Book Thief </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
deftonesmike@gmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
don't know if it's really haunted, but i had a experience as a child i
can't
explain. I attended Dardenne Elementary many years ago. I was in a
reading
class and it was library day. You know &nbsp;those
days as a child were your supposed to go to the library and find a book
to
write a book report on?&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember
grabbing a book and sitting down at a table with 2 fellow classmates.
Both of
them sat across from me at the table. I had picked up a book on space,
and for
some odd reason i decided to lift the book up to look at the pic. I
believe it
was because the light was too dim at the table. Now keep in mind there
is no
one behind me at this point, the rest of my class is at the other end
of the
library. There are no teachers, no classmates, nothing but a walls of
books
behind me. So i looked at the photo and was bringing the book back down
to the
table. As i am bringing the book down it was as if someone had grabbed
onto the
book and was trying to take it from me. I yanked really hard and
whomever had
grabbed it had let go. When i turned to see who was messing with me,
there was
no one there. Now if it had been a fellow classmate they would have
still been
standing there, or I would have at least caught them running off. Nope,
nothing
at all. I asked the two classmates at the table if they had seen anyone
behind
me, but they were buried in there books and didn't see anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now i haven't heard anything about my old
elementary school on here, but seeing as it is a school i wouldn't
doubt it if
something still roams the halls or haunts the library. I was hoping i
wasn't
the only one that experienced something in the school library. </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Universal
Studios</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
aquagirl800@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;I work at Universal Studios currently
and I
was sent to your site &nbsp;by my boyfriend. I
went through the haunted locations you have for California and I read
the
Universal Studio's hauntings. I just wanted to add to the Back to the
Future
which is now the ride for The Simpsons. I work over at Shrek 4D which
replaced
the Rugrats/Nicktoons &nbsp;game show a few
years back. The little girl that died at the Back to the
Future/Simpsons
building doesn't just reside there. She takes trips over to Shrek 4D as
well.
I'm not sure if you know but Shrek 4D is a motional simulator but it
looks just
like a movie theater. We play a 15 minute film between the first and
second
Shrek in 3D.&nbsp; I've had a personal
experience where I was sitting in the theater as one of our shows were
going on
and I had noticed a shadow of a person moving along the aisle closest
to our
first set of automatic doors. It looked like they were walking up the
aisle to
sit in one of our stationary seats in the back of the theater so I had
gotten
up from my position to check on them but they disappeared. I thought
they
probably found another seat just farther back but when i looked farther
ahead
at the back aisle, I saw the figure walking across it. I was confused
because I
would have seen them round the corner and past the stationary seats.
The shadow
continued to walk to my aisle, closest to the main exit and it stopped
at the
top of my aisle. It was blocking out one of the lights we have for
guest to see
when they exit the theater and it looked at me and when I stared at it,
it
looked just like a little girl in a white dress or a long shirt and
pants. I
was scared and curious at the same time and then she just disappeared.
I didn't
know of any spirits or hauntings or any accidents at the themepark
before that
incident. When I told my other coworkers, they told me of the little
girl that
died at Back to the Future from an asthma attack. That was the only
experience
I had with the little girl. Other coworkers though have told me what
they
experienced. They've seen the little hanging around in the theater like
walking
across the rows, running up and down the aisles. A recent experience
was from
my friend that as he was running the show during the same part I had
seen her,
she was sitting in the front row, watching the movie without the
glasses and
she was by herself. He was sitting on the chair nearby and he smiled at
her,
wondering where her family was and she smiled back and when he looked
at the
movie and turned back to her, she was gone. He described her the same
way, with
the long shirt and pants. He was never so scared in his life at Shrek.
Others
had the same experience I did. They have also told me that she plays
behind the
curtains of the screen, in our backstage area. Lights wouldn't turn on
sometimes back there for no reason. Footsteps are heard in the cooridor
when no
one was around while the park was closed and no music was going on. It
would
also be heard in the "torture chamber" in our preshow room. My other
worker had also told me of seeing a male worker that past away a couple
years
back, walking across the projector on the aisle infront of it. Other
than that,
the typical calling of everyones names inside the auditorium and
preshow room,
the footsteps, the feeling of someone following behind you, and the
shawdows
and full apparition of the little girl. Those are the experiences as
far as I
am aware of.I personally will not go behind to the backstage by myself
because
of the weird feeling I get.&nbsp; </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>At
the age of 19, I was engaged to the boy I'd been in love with since 4th
grade.
My fiance had fulfilled his dream of joining the Air Force and was, at
the
time, going through Basic Training. I missed him terribly and waited
impatiently for a letter from him. One night about a week before
Christmas I
had gone to bed early, my mother had complained earlier that my cat
kept waking
her up too early so I brought her in and shut my bedroom door and
locked it.
The cat and I curled up on the bed and drifted off to sleep.&nbsp; I
remember having a dream about my fiance, he
was dressed in the Air Force Blues and looked unhappy. His dream self
informed
me he was breaking up with me. Before I could reply to the dream, a
loud BANG &nbsp;startled me awake, half asleep at first I
assumed the bang was a gun going off and started to scramble out of bed
to
check my parents...when I saw my closet door slowly swinging back into
place. &nbsp;I always kept the sliding doors of my closet
open, one of the doors had jumped off the track...it took a lot of
&nbsp;force to make it swing into the closet so I
never bothered to try and fix it. It occurred to me that someone &nbsp;might
have shoved it, causing it to swing
quickly inside and hit the shelf...producing the bang that woke me up.
I looked
for my cat and found her in the same spot she had been in when I fell
asleep,
looking just as startled as I was. I climbed out of bed trembling [and
despite
my bedroom door being locked] assumed &nbsp;someone
had sneaked into my room. I looked all over the place and came up empty
handed.
Still a bit freaked out I climbed back into bed... I guess a gentle
spirit
realized I was having a nightmare and did the only thing it could to
wake me
up.</big></p>

Teasing Ghost </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp; debra_kay92@yahoo.com </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;When i was younger i lived in this
house that
my family and I rented. I experienced all kinds of paranormal activity.
It only
happened to my little sisters and I, my parents never experienced
anything. My
sister and I would lay in her room at night and talk and we would see a
dark
figure walk through her bedrrom and just dissappear into the closet
door, when
we would get up and open the door there would be nothing in sight. We
would be
home alone and hear talking. I had an attic door in my cieling above my
bed and
i would lay there at night and listen to whispering although i couldn't
make
out what was being said i could hear voices. My things would get moved,
stuff
would fall off my dresser for no reason, some of my belongings would
slide
across my dresser. One night i was lying on my side in bed watching a
movie and
something came up behind me and tapped my shoulder i ignored it the
first time,
so it happened again. I thought it was my sister so i rolled over to
see what
she wanted but to my surprise i found nobody. So i rolled back over and
it
happened again so i got up and walked around my house to find everyone
sound
asleep. I got very freaked out and told myself it was just my nerves,
then a
movie fell off my dresser. So i just went to sleep. Doors would also
shut and
open for no reason. </big></p>
