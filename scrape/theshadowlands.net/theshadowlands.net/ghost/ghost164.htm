<p><b>My Friends Mom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GTCollinz@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Okay, something weird happend to me the other night.&nbsp; I was
sleeping.. And</b>
<br><b>the phone rang at 5:05am exactly.. I of course didn't even wake
up by the</b>
<br><b>phone call, i saw it on the caller id when i woke up.&nbsp; It was
a cell number..</b>
<br><b>So i looked through my numbers to see if it was someone i knew,
and sure</b>
<br><b>enough it was my friend Brian's number..So when i got home from
work that</b>
<br><b>day, i talked to him.. and i said, why did you call me ay 5 am ?&nbsp;
And he</b>
<br><b>thought i was joking.. I said, no your cell number is on my caller
id, did</b>
<br><b>someone else call here with your phone?&nbsp; He said, no.. no one
could have</b>
<br><b>called it was charging..I sat and thought about it for a minute..Then
i</b>
<br><b>remembered a dream i had that night... I dreamt i saw his mom, and
i gave her</b>
<br><b>a hug.. His mother passed away 6 months ago.&nbsp; I told him about
that, and he</b>
<br><b>said.. "Yes, that is weird.. she passed away exactly 6 months to
the day</b>
<br><b>today" it was the same day.&nbsp; That alone creeped me out, but
what added to it</b>
<br><b>was when i told my mom.. After my friend left that night.. i locked
up the</b>
<br><b>door.. and she asked.. did your friend lock the door when he left,
i said.. i</b>
<br><b>did.. Because it was open.. Something woke her up, she said the
dog and cat</b>
<br><b>were acting funny, so she went to check.. and it was open.. this
happend the</b>
<br><b>day before yesterday.&nbsp; And it's kind of cool, because I have
known him and</b>
<br><b>his mom all my life, and i didn't get to go to her funeral, i feel
like it</b>
<br><b>was her way of saying goodbye maybe.&nbsp; Anyways, I thought it
would be</b>
<br><b>interesting for your page..Thanks!</b>

<p><b>Ghost Cat</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PortilloRodas@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi! My name is Samantha and I am 14 years old. This story is about
a cat who</b>
<br><b>used to live with my grandma. He named was Malo. We are a Spanish
family. I used</b>
<br><b>to be good friends with Malo the cat. He was a beautiful cat but
he always fought</b>
<br><b>with the neighborhood cats. So everytime he came home he was hurt.
Years passed and</b>
<br><b>Malo was getting old so one day my aunt who lives with my grandma
found Malo.</b>
<br><b>He lay on the ground and didn't move he was dead. I have no idea
what my aunt</b>
<br><b>did with Malo but I think she buried him. A couple weeks later my
brother and I were</b>
<br><b>playing catch inside the house even we weren't allowed to. So me
and my brother were</b>
<br><b>playing in the living room when I felt something was behind me.
When I look</b>
<br><b>around it was Malo but I could see right through him! He was walking
toward me and then he disapper! That was the only time I saw Malo. My brother
told me Malo was</b>
<br><b>saying goodbye to me and he was alright. Thanks for reading my story.</b>

<br><b>Massachusettes</b><b></b>
<p><b>By AndyAbad10@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I have some ghost experiences/haunted places to share. While
I read your</b>
<br><b>Haunted Places page, under Massachusetts, I noticed some stories
I knew</b>
<br><b>weren't there. First, there is The Hornbine School in Rehoboth,
MA. This</b>
<br><b>place dates to the 1800's, and is a single-roomed school, normal
for that</b>
<br><b>time period. Well, the story goes that many people who live in the
area go</b>
<br><b>out and walk their dogs or walking, etc., and hear people in the
building, as</b>
<br><b>if there was a "class" in session. The last time the school was
used for as a</b>
<br><b>school was early-1900's. My own personal experiences while ghosthunting
was</b>
<br><b>a) I opened up on of the shutters on the outside of the school,
and looked</b>
<br><b>inside&nbsp; and saw&nbsp; a strange&nbsp; red glow from the inside.
My friend, Gerald put</b>
<br><b>his hand on the shutter to close it,&nbsp; and noticed a dramatic
drop in</b>
<br><b>temperature near his hand. So, of course, we ran into his car and
took off!</b>
<br><b>Another site is also in Rehoboth, MA. It is a "Rehoboth Historic
Cemetetary,</b>
<br><b>#43 or #44". While with a bunch of friends, we patrolled a this
cemetary.</b>
<br><b>After about 3-4 minutes, we saw a "light" above one of the graves.
Anyone who</b>
<br><b>knows this area knows that it wasn't the glow from a streetlight,
because</b>
<br><b>there are no streetlights in Rehoboth. Other places that I know
are the Old</b>
<br><b>Shad Factory, The Giggling Ghost Cemetary, and "another" Ghost of
Route 44,</b>
<br><b>except this one is a jogger. All of these places are in Rehoboth,
MA.</b>

<p><b>All Hallows Eve</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: evangelionunitrt@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was six years old, I probably had my first encounter before
All</b>
<br><b>Hallow's Eve. What happened was that I was moved to a different
room in</b>
<br><b>my house that I wasn't used to. I constantly tried to stay away
from</b>
<br><b>this room, even in the hallway. It had this dark magnetic grip to
it.</b>
<br><b>The first time I slept there, I was scared beyond belief. I had
no idea</b>
<br><b>ghosts really exist. This ghost was a terror, taking shapes and
forms of</b>
<br><b>people I knew and other unworldly creatures. Next morning, I awoke
to see my parents standing over me while I lay in bed, trembling and my
nose bleeding for some odd reason.( I associated this "bleed" as a pinpoint
ghost detector as I grew a bit.)</b>
<br><b>As I aged, I had one last encounter with a ghost. This one was different</b>
<br><b>in a way. It was feminine down to a fault. I could feel its touch
and I could hear</b>
<br><b>it talk( more like hushed whispering). It once took form to what
may</b>
<br><b>have been "her" human form. I only saw blue eyes and slightly grayish
brown hair that was waist length.</b>
<br><b>But now, these days have been very quiet. No ghosts...</b>
<br><b>WHY?</b>

<br><b>The Bed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: radioprincess@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 3 or 4 my parents bought me my first real bed. My
Dad got</b>
<br><b>it from Ikea brand spanking new.&nbsp; It was white,pretty and simple.
Quickly, I</b>
<br><b>developed a huge fear of this bed because weird scarry things happened
to me</b>
<br><b>in it.&nbsp; Sometimes toys spoke to me and I had visions of people
in my room.</b>
<br><b>Even though I was a child at the time I know it was not my imagination.</b>
<br><b>Unfortunatley, I can't remember how old I was when most of these
thing</b>
<br><b>happened to me but this stuff happened between the ages of 4 and
13.</b>
<br><b>-As a small child I woke up because I felt like someone was in my
room.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>dresser had a big mirror on it and it was located opposite the bed.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>looked into the mirror and saw smoke around my head.&nbsp; I remember
looking up</b>
<br><b>and throwing my arms up over my head to get rid of the smoke.&nbsp;
I thought</b>
<br><b>there was a fire and I started crying and rocking in my bed because
I was so</b>
<br><b>afraid.</b>
<br><b>-One night I believed their was wasps in my room buzzing around
my head so I</b>
<br><b>hid under the blanket.&nbsp; I could hear them and feel them landing
on my</b>
<br><b>blanket.&nbsp; I was trying to swat at them with a smaller blanket.&nbsp;
Eventually I</b>
<br><b>fell asleep.&nbsp; When I awoke in the morning I found a wasp in
that small</b>
<br><b>blanket.</b>
<br><b>-One night I heard a noise in my closet.&nbsp; I had a small yellow
dino the</b>
<br><b>dinosaur stuffed animal in there.&nbsp; I picked it up and it's
eyes disappeared</b>
<br><b>as if to blink.&nbsp; This stuffed animal had buttons for eyes.</b>
<br><b>-I was having a nightmare that there was a snake under the covers
at the end</b>
<br><b>of the bed.&nbsp; I was afraid it would bite me so my legs were
pulled up to my</b>
<br><b>body.&nbsp; That wasn't close enough because the dream snake bit
me in my dream.</b>
<br><b>I woke up with a start because the dream bite hurt!&nbsp; I pulled
my foot out</b>
<br><b>from under the covers and my big toe was very red and sore.</b>
<br><b>-I was at home sick one morning when I woke up to a loating transparent</b>
<br><b>image of a street with people standing together in groups. It was
like</b>
<br><b>watching TV.&nbsp; The people were smaller and each was dressed
in a different</b>
<br><b>era of clothing.&nbsp; I remember a Victorian lady, and Indian and
a small child</b>
<br><b>but there were more.&nbsp; They were standing talking in group to
each other.</b>
<br><b>There was no sound so I couldn't hear what they were saying.&nbsp;
Just like</b>
<br><b>watching TV.</b>
<br><b>-Numerous times things would disappear from my room never to be
found again.</b>
<br><b>-Sometimes I'd hear a thumping sound under the bed and feel like
I was being</b>
<br><b>watched.&nbsp; I had a such a fear of putting my feet over the side
of the bed</b>
<br><b>because I thought whatever lived under the bed would get me.&nbsp;
I always</b>
<br><b>jumped off the bed as far as possible so nothing could catch me
and pull me</b>
<br><b>under.</b>
<br><b>-*-*This is the kicker that coresponds with your story.&nbsp; One
night I was</b>
<br><b>lying on my side facing the wall.&nbsp; My butt was hanging off
the edge of the</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; All of a sudden I felt fingers rake down my back and
butt.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>frozen with fear.&nbsp; I was too scared to move but I stood up
fast on the bed</b>
<br><b>and jumped as far away as I could from the bed.&nbsp; I was scared
to put my feet</b>
<br><b>over the side of the bed for fear whatever touched me would pull
me under</b>
<br><b>the bed.&nbsp; To this day I have no idea what actually happened.</b>
<br><b>Everything strange that happened to me centered around that Ikea
bed. I</b>
<br><b>believe that bed was haunted.&nbsp; I spent countless nights sleeping
on the</b>
<br><b>floor beside my parents bed. When my parents bought me a new bed
when I was</b>
<br><b>13 and they got rid of the Ikea bed, all that scarry stuff stopped
that day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I believe it was that bed that was doing these horrible things
to me.</b>

<br><b>Haunted Nicely</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PDISTLER@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up in very old house in rural Virginia.&nbsp;
The bottom floor of the</b>
<br><b>house was a hospital during the Revolutionary War.&nbsp; My sister
and I saw,</b>
<br><b>felt,&nbsp; and heard many "unexplainable" things as we grew up.&nbsp;
I will tell you</b>
<br><b>of my most vivid and very true ghost memory.&nbsp; I was about seven
yrs. old and</b>
<br><b>had a nightmare one night.&nbsp; My parents were still awake, three
floors down.</b>
<br><b>Outside my bedroom door is a staircase with four steps, a landing,
and then</b>
<br><b>18 steps to the main hall (this was where I saw a very vivid ghost
on one or</b>
<br><b>two occasions).&nbsp; At that age if I was in a hurry to get downstairs,
I would</b>
<br><b>usually jump off of the last couple of steps into the hall.&nbsp;
On this</b>
<br><b>particular night, I jumped from the 15th step.&nbsp; As soon as
my feet left the</b>
<br><b>step, I felt someone scoop me up and I was floated down the rest
of the way</b>
<br><b>in the arms of someone invisible.&nbsp; I didn't see anything, but
to this day I</b>
<br><b>am sure that at least one of the spirits in our house saved me from
a VERY</b>
<br><b>bad fall, if not death. This is an absolutely true story.&nbsp;
I am well educated</b>
<br><b>and do not seek anything except to tell you about this.&nbsp; My
sister and I have</b>
<br><b>always felt that the ghosts that we grew up with were kind and looked
out for</b>
<br><b>us.&nbsp; We never were really scared, just kind of awed.</b><b></b>
<p>

<br><b>I Must be Sensitive</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CristenL@itt-tech.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well My first experience was several years back and I never really
thought</b>
<br><b>much about it except that if I ever came face to face with one I
would most</b>
<br><b>likely die.&nbsp; I stayed with a friend of mine at her Mothers
house one night</b>
<br><b>and she told me that the house was haunted.&nbsp; I didn't believe
her until I</b>
<br><b>saw her son play with the "ghost".&nbsp; We looked at each other
and just smiled.</b>
<br><b>That was in the living room.&nbsp; Later on that night we went into
the kitchen</b>
<br><b>to talk and her son came in there and he was playing with some paper
plates.</b>
<br><b>He's 18 months and all he can really say is Daddy.&nbsp; While we
were talking I</b>
<br><b>noticed that he was handing everyone a paper plate.&nbsp; Well he
looked like he</b>
<br><b>was trying to hand one to thin air.&nbsp; I looked at my friend
and we didn't</b>
<br><b>know what to do.&nbsp; Her son got mad because who ever was there
would not take</b>
<br><b>the paper plate.&nbsp; Well he put it down and his head started
to turn like he</b>
<br><b>was watching someone walk away.&nbsp; Well when he looked at me
it felt like</b>
<br><b>someone walked right through me.&nbsp; I had never felt anything
like that</b>
<br><b>before.&nbsp; My friend I looked at each other and she asked me
if I felt that</b>
<br><b>too?&nbsp; I was scared.&nbsp; I wanted to sleep outside but I couldn't.&nbsp;
She told me</b>
<br><b>that for two years nothing would stay on her walls in her room.&nbsp;
They would</b>
<br><b>hear baby's crying when there was none there and they would smell
incense</b>
<br><b>burning when they never burned any.&nbsp; Doors would open and all
kind of stuff</b>
<br><b>would happen.&nbsp; When I went to bed that night I knew someone
was watching me.</b>
<br><b>I could feel them watching over the bed.&nbsp; I even dreamed about
a boy in the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; It so happened that her dads brother died in the house
and the boy I</b>
<br><b>described to them in my dream sounded like his brother.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well I wanted to let you know about my first experience.&nbsp; I
have been told</b>
<br><b>that ghost don't follow you well if they don't then I must be sensitive</b>
<br><b>because it seems lately no matter where I go I can feel one.&nbsp;
It started a</b>
<br><b>couple of years ago when I moved in with my fianc&eacute;.&nbsp;
He is in the military</b>
<br><b>so he would have to go away for a week or so sometimes.&nbsp; Well
this one time</b>
<br><b>he was gone and I was sound asleep when something shocked my finger.&nbsp;
(Have</b>
<br><b>you ever touched something while you were plugging it in and it
shocked</b>
<br><b>you?)&nbsp; Well that's what it felt like.&nbsp; I sat up in bed
and it felt like</b>
<br><b>there was someone there but I couldn't see anyone.&nbsp; I really
got scared.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>didn't know what was going on.&nbsp; I could feel this presence
and yet I</b>
<br><b>couldn't see anyone.&nbsp; I was so cold and hair was standing up
in places I</b>
<br><b>never even thought of.&nbsp; I sat down on the couch and stretched
my legs out.</b>
<br><b>Well it felt like someone sat down on them.&nbsp; The coldness started
moving up</b>
<br><b>my legs.&nbsp; I pulled my legs to me and started crying telling
it to leave me</b>
<br><b>alone.&nbsp; I finally fell asleep a couple of hours later.&nbsp;
I had to get some</b>
<br><b>one to stay with me till my fianc&eacute; got back.&nbsp; I never
felt anything again in</b>
<br><b>that house.&nbsp; Well we have since moved and we are married and
I have a little</b>
<br><b>girl now.&nbsp; My husband started working another job (besides
the military) so</b>
<br><b>he was gone till late at night.&nbsp; One night I was going to bed,
I had just</b>
<br><b>laid down when I felt someone come in the room.&nbsp; I got real
cold and my hair</b>
<br><b>started standing up again.&nbsp; I could feel it in my room.&nbsp;
I got up and went</b>
<br><b>into the living room and sat there for a minute.&nbsp; My mother
told me when I</b>
<br><b>was younger to say this little saying and what ever was scaring
me would go</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; Well I said it and it wouldn't go away.&nbsp; Later
on it did.&nbsp; Well when</b>
<br><b>I got to work I started looking for someone to share this with.&nbsp;
If I told</b>
<br><b>my husband he'd have me locked up.&nbsp; Well I found someone and
they said try</b>
<br><b>talking to it and see what happens.&nbsp; Well when I got home I
waited till my</b>
<br><b>daughter was asleep and I sat in our rocker and waited till I could
feel it.</b>
<br><b>I said a prayer and asked for comfort and the strength I needed.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>could feel it I told them that I didn't like the way they were making
me</b>
<br><b>feel.&nbsp; I told them that I had talked to someone and that they
told me you</b>
<br><b>might need help.&nbsp; I told them that I would help them but they
couldn't make</b>
<br><b>anything move and they couldn't make any weird noises and they could
not</b>
<br><b>hurt my daughter.&nbsp; I told them that I didn't want to be scared
anymore.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>even asked them if they would let my husband know they were real
but I don't</b>
<br><b>know if anything has happened in that area.&nbsp; Well after I said
what I</b>
<br><b>thought needed to be said I just sat there and I felt this calmness
come</b>
<br><b>over me and I could feel them it was like they were telling me it
was ok.</b>
<br><b>My chair even started rocking.&nbsp; It really felt like they were
telling me it</b>
<br><b>was ok.&nbsp; After that they went away.&nbsp; I still felt them
every now and then</b>
<br><b>through the night.&nbsp; I wasn't about to tell my husband that
the chair started</b>
<br><b>rocking.&nbsp; I know some people are skeptics but the air wasn't
on and it</b>
<br><b>really takes some body motion to get the chair rocking.&nbsp; I
was sitting</b>
<br><b>still.&nbsp; Well my husband didn't work late for a couple of nights
so I thought</b>
<br><b>they had gone away till last night.&nbsp; I started getting sick
and my husband</b>
<br><b>took my daughter over to a friends house so I could get some rest.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>wasn't long that I felt them come in the room.&nbsp; I told them
that I wasn't</b>
<br><b>feeling good and that this wasn't a good time to be there.&nbsp;
It felt like it</b>
<br><b>hugged me.&nbsp; It then started to rub my head like it was trying
to make it</b>
<br><b>feel better. and the weird thing was when it did that the coldness
did make</b>
<br><b>my head feel better.&nbsp; I know that to some people this may not
seem like much</b>
<br><b>but it is.&nbsp; It's not scary but that's the good thing.&nbsp;
I think what I was</b>
<br><b>scared of most was coming face to face with a ghost.&nbsp; When
I realized that I</b>
<br><b>could lay down the laws it helped.&nbsp; I'm not scared anymore
and sometimes</b>
<br><b>when I ask them to leave it does take a moment but I can at least
sleep now.</b>
<br><b>There was a couple of things I did leave out.&nbsp; One night after
my husband</b>
<br><b>came home we went to bed and while I was sleeping I could feel it
and it</b>
<br><b>felt like it was trying to take over my body or something.&nbsp;
It even felt</b>
<br><b>like it was tugging at my arm and head.&nbsp; This is while my husband
is</b>
<br><b>sleeping next to me.&nbsp; Another time we went to his mothers hose
to visit and</b>
<br><b>since she lives 5 hours away we stayed the night.&nbsp; That night
I felt someone</b>
<br><b>come into the room.&nbsp; I could feel them trying to touch me or
something.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>couldn't make it out because it scared me.&nbsp; This was before
I got the guts</b>
<br><b>to talk to whatever is at my house.&nbsp; And before I met my husband
I lived in</b>
<br><b>a house that I could feel someone there.&nbsp; I would even say
hello to it when</b>
<br><b>I would come home.&nbsp; I had to let it know that it was me coming
in.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>night while I was asleep it tried to get my attention and I finally
asked it</b>
<br><b>to show itself to me.&nbsp; When it did it was a little girl.&nbsp;
I woke up after</b>
<br><b>that and I ended up moving.&nbsp; I haven't been able to get the
history on the</b>
<br><b>places I have lived but the house we are in now is only ten years
old and we</b>
<br><b>are the second family to live there.&nbsp; And from what the neighbors
have said</b>
<br><b>no one has died there.</b>
<br><b>Well that's my story.&nbsp; I will keep you informed of any other
happenings.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>don't think this will be my last.&nbsp; If you have any questions
please ask.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>would welcome any kind of theory's as to what I might be experiencing.</b><b></b>

<br><b>John's Exit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:bpcoffey@gis.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I once worked as a cafeteria&nbsp; cashier at a local hospital and&nbsp;
became</b>
<br><b>quite familiar with many of the staff members who came to the lunchroom</b>
<br><b>to eat everyday.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the many people I met was a
maintenence worker</b>
<br><b>named John.&nbsp; He was a very friendly man and sometimes we had</b>
<br><b>conversations while he waited in line to pay for his food.</b>
<br><b>Well, one day one of his friends mentioned to me that John hadn't
come</b>
<br><b>in to work that morning, and, what was especially unusual for someone</b>
<br><b>responsible like John, was that he didn't even call to say he was
sick</b>
<br><b>or give some other such excuse.&nbsp; His friend was perplexed since
this was</b>
<br><b>so out of character for John.</b>
<br><b>A little while later I was in the hall outside the cafeteria on
the way</b>
<br><b>outside for my break when the electric exit sign's blinking caught
my</b>
<br><b>eye.&nbsp; It was flickering in a strange manner and I stood and
watched it</b>
<br><b>for a few minutes, thinking, "That's John saying goodbye."&nbsp;
I don't know</b>
<br><b>what made me think this but that is what I thought.</b>
<br><b>The next day I found out the reason why John hadn't come to work.&nbsp;
When</b>
<br><b>the supervisor&nbsp; called his house and paged him on the&nbsp;
beeper and got no</b>
<br><b>answer, someone elected to go to John's house.&nbsp; When there
was no answer</b>
<br><b>to the repeated knocking at John's door, they decided to break the
door</b>
<br><b>down.&nbsp; That's when they found John lying dead in his bed.&nbsp;
He had died</b>
<br><b>in his sleep the night before of a heart attack.&nbsp; He was only
43.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>hope wherever you are John, that you're in a good place.</b>

<br><b>The 'Light'</b>
<br><b>By: longbranch@ddminc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the summer of 1968 my girlfriend and I were visiting friends in
Beaufort South Carolina. We were invited out one night on&nbsp; a dare
to see what the locals call the 'light'.I can't remember the name or highway
number,but the road was very long and straight. It was dark and spooky
sitting there at 10 that night. We were in the back seat. Somebody up front
saw the "light' first. I looked over the seat and through the windshield
and saw that it appeared to be coming straight down the road. The best
way that I can describe it is that it looked like a train engine light
from a long distance,except there were no trains or tracks in the area.
We never saw a car the hour that we sat there.This was a very lonely place!
I thought somebody could be walking down the road with a flashlight,but
as we sat there the 'light' kept getting bigger and never wavered at all!
It became obvious to me that it was getting closer and was coming down
the middle of the road ! I looked out the window and it seemed to be coming
at a slow to medium pace from about a half mile away! I'm a reasonable
and logical thinking&nbsp; person and certainly not a scared cat, but I
found I could not sit there ! None of us could ! We started the car and
left. After we got back I asked the other couple if they were playing some
kind of joke on us. They assured us they had never seen this incident all
way to the end before. I believe they were really scared too! Several years
later I saw this very same 'light' incident on a TV program similar to
Ripley's and they explained it away as swamp gas[ there was a swamp to
the right of where we sat that night]. I am not at all convinced that it
was swamp gas that caused this. I&nbsp; have told this to a lot of people
over the years,but no one can give an explanation. Can anyone help with
this?</b>

<p><b>Town House in Tustin, CA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DesertSage1a@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When my husband and I were first married we moved into an old townhouse
in</b>
<br><b>Tustin, CA. It was located in old town Tustin.&nbsp; We chose to
move into the</b>
<br><b>townhouse because it was the only place we could find in our budget
that</b>
<br><b>allowed us to keep our two large dogs.&nbsp; I didn't feel comfortable
when we did</b>
<br><b>the walk through but it was the only place we could find so there
we moved.</b>
<br><b>My husband was going to night school at the time so I was often
alone in the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; One night I was downstairs watching t.v. my dogs were
at my feet.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>heard what sounded like people running up the stairs and loud footsteps</b>
<br><b>running into the first bedroom.&nbsp; It sounded like the furniture
was being</b>
<br><b>knocked over and then the window breaking.&nbsp; The stairs which
was a metal</b>
<br><b>winding staircase was in clear view from where I was sitting.&nbsp;
I saw nothing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The dogs barked when they heard the noise but refused to go
up the stairs.</b>
<br><b>This really frightened me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband came home
from class shortly after</b>
<br><b>this and went upstairs to investigate. There was nothing there and
nothing</b>
<br><b>was disturbed.&nbsp; I was sure he would find the window broken.
The window was</b>
<br><b>intact but there were shards of glass on the roof below indicating
the window</b>
<br><b>had been broken before.&nbsp; My husband said it was my imagination
running away</b>
<br><b>with me.&nbsp; He didn't believe there was a ghost.</b>
<br><b>Another time I walked into our bedroom, my husband was asleep in
the bed and</b>
<br><b>their was a red hazy figure standing next to him looking down on
him.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>immediately told it to leave and it was gone.</b>
<br><b>We did not have an air conditioner so on hot summer nights we would
sleep</b>
<br><b>downstairs.&nbsp; One night I awoke feeling a presence in the room
with us.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>turned over and saw a man standing in the middle of the room looking
at us.</b>
<br><b>He had dark hair and was wearing dark slacks and a white shirt.
I think he</b>
<br><b>was surprised we were sleeping downstairs.</b>
<br><b>Another time I saw a large black dog about the size of a great dane
in our</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; I was shocked when I saw it and blinked my eyes several
times to</b>
<br><b>clear my vision.&nbsp; My husband had not seen or felt anything
out of the</b>
<br><b>ordinary until he saw the dog.&nbsp; He didn't believe there were
ghosts until he</b>
<br><b>saw the dog too.&nbsp; He still is skeptical about the ghosts but
I remind him of</b>
<br><b>the dog and he won't argue that.</b>
<br><b>Another time I was running up the stairs emotionally upset and I
heard</b>
<br><b>someone call my name from the base of the stairs.&nbsp; No one else
was home.</b>
<br><b>We moved out two years later and I was glad to leave.&nbsp; The
townhouse always</b>
<br><b>had a faint unpleasant odor that would never leave also.&nbsp; We
just learned to</b>
<br><b>live with it.&nbsp; Anyway these are some experiences I had in that
townhouse.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>have had nothing like this happen in the two houses we've lived
in since.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Possible Haunting?</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: speterso@siemens-psc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi there. I really don't know where to start. I guess you could say
I have</b>
<br><b>had "experiences" off and on since I was a child. But nothing like
what been</b>
<br><b>happening lately.&nbsp; We bought a house in April of 1996. Around
May or June of</b>
<br><b>'96 my Husband was out for the evening and our Son (Who was 5 at
the time)</b>
<br><b>was asleep.&nbsp; I was heading downstairs to do some laundry. The
light above</b>
<br><b>the stairs flickered and then went out. I thought "Oh great! That's
gonna be</b>
<br><b>a pain in the neck to change" When I got to the bottom of the stairs
I tried</b>
<br><b>the switch and the light came back on "Great! Maybe it was just
a glitch."</b>
<br><b>I loaded up my basket and a few minutes later I headed back up the
stairs.</b>
<br><b>About half way up the light went off, went on and went off again.
Not too</b>
<br><b>quickly but it was as if someone was flicking the switch on and
off. I</b>
<br><b>stopped and looked up in the air and yelled "It's not very nice
to mess with</b>
<br><b>people when they have their arms full and are trying to walk up
a flight of</b>
<br><b>stairs!" I really had no idea who I was yelling at, I was just yelling
in</b>
<br><b>general. Then the light came back on and I proceeded with my laundry.
This</b>
<br><b>did make me wonder, but I dismissed it as an electrical glitch and
an</b>
<br><b>overactive imagination. Then things started disappearing. I would
set</b>
<br><b>something down, go back for it a few minutes later and it would
be gone!</b>
<br><b>Sometimes I would find it within a short amount of time but it would
be in</b>
<br><b>the most obscure spot and I would have no idea why I would even
look for it</b>
<br><b>there. Other times it would disappear for days or even weeks and
then show</b>
<br><b>up EXACTLY where I had left it to begin with. This was and still
is very</b>
<br><b>frustrating.&nbsp; Then the REALLY weird stuff happened a couple
of months ago. I</b>
<br><b>haven't told my Husband any of this because he doesn't believe in
ghosts,</b>
<br><b>spirits and the like. ANYWAY! I started having nightmares. These
nightmares</b>
<br><b>were very violent and very graphic. I would wake from them exactly
one hour</b>
<br><b>and a half from the time I last looked at the clock before I fell
asleep. I</b>
<br><b>would be so freaked out I would have to get up, take a walk around
to clear</b>
<br><b>my head and go back to bed. One night (Probably the 3rd night) I
woke from a</b>
<br><b>nightmare and I could "feel" someone in the room with me. It was
like they</b>
<br><b>were standing over the bed looking at me. I felt like I couldn't
get up to</b>
<br><b>do my "routine" to calm down. I had a second nightmare that night.
The next</b>
<br><b>night, I woke from a nightmare and I could feel someone in the room
again</b>
<br><b>but this time everything felt "heavy" (I really can't explain what
I mean by</b>
<br><b>heavy) and I could smell aftershave ALL OVER ME! It wasn't the kind
my</b>
<br><b>Husband uses. But I could smell it on my hands, shirt, and sheets.
As if</b>
<br><b>someone was lying on me. The next morning I woke our Son (Who is
9 now) for</b>
<br><b>school. I started to get a little gruff with him because he was
being very</b>
<br><b>sluggish that morning and we were running late (as usual). He came
into the</b>
<br><b>Bathroom where I was getting ready for work and told me he was so
tired</b>
<br><b>because the voices kept him awake again last night. I asked him
"What</b>
<br><b>voices?" "The voices that whisper to me at night." he said. I asked
if he</b>
<br><b>meant his radio (Even thought I turn it off before I go to bed every
night).</b>
<br><b>he said "No. The man and the wman who talk to me at night." I asked
if he</b>
<br><b>could understand what they were whispering and he said "Yeah. They
call me</b>
<br><b>by name and they want me to go somewhere with them but I can't understand</b>
<br><b>that part." I was FREAKED!&nbsp; I told him NOT TO GO WITH THEM!&nbsp;
I said if they</b>
<br><b>asked him again he was to say "No!" I did a little checking and
the only</b>
<br><b>thing I could come up with is the previous owners Wife spent some
time in an</b>
<br><b>asylum. I don't know if that would have anything to do with our
"visitors"</b>

<br><b>Warning or What?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: clschultz@tc3net.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I grew up in a house that had a lot of spirit activity. Sometimes
it would just be noises and other times I would see or sense something.
I never feared it. I was quite confortable there. Besides they had never
caused any harm. There was only one room in my parents home that I felt
quite unconfortable in. It just happend to be my bedroom. Evently I took
on a differnt room to sleep in. Anyhow, my senior year My Dad met a woman
and they planned on buying a new house together. (My Mom had passed away
when I was eleven) My Dad and his new found girlfriend came home and told
us they found a house but they wanted us kids to look at it first. That
night I went to sleep and had a strange dream about the home that they
wanted us to look at. Keep in mind I haven't seen the house at this point
yet. I dreamt the kitchen lights flickered on and off. When I awoke in
the mornig I didn't think much of it. Later that day we drove out to look
at the house. It was so weird the kitchen looked exzactly how I had dreamt
it. They turned on the kitchen lights and they began to flicker. I passed
it off as old lights. I didn't want to freak myself out anymore then I
already was. They ended up buying the house. We moved in and everything
was fine. I shared a room with my sorta step sister. Things happened between
my Dad and his girlfriend and she moved out. I was very timid about sleeping
alone in my room, because of that dream. But then I thought, nothing has
happend</b>
<br><b>so there is nothing to fear. I was laying in my bed one night and
although I didn't see anything, I felt something grab my shoulder. I jumped
out of my bed and my dog was stareing at something I couldn't see. She
was growling and barking. I picked up my little dog and ran down the stairs.
I never did go back up in that room at night. A year or so went by and
nothing happened. My Dad's ex girlfriend son wanted to stay the night with
us and he had some friends stay too. I had a room downstairs at this time.
I never kept my room clean. Papers were scatterd across the floor. I was
laying in bed with the lights off and the door shut. I heard the door open
and shut. I then heard footsteps. I kept my eyes closed pretending that
I was sleeping. I figured it was one of the boys trying to scare me. I
could tell where it was walking by the differnt sounds of notebook paper,
newspapers and what not. finally it was next to my bed and I heard a slight
breathing. I swung my leg out to kick what I thought was one of the boys.
I didn't hit anything. I got up and turned my light on and didn't see anything.
I went out to check on the boys and they were all there. This time I wasn't
going to let it scare me and I told what ever it was that they it was not
going to drive me away and I stayed in the room. I know it didn't leave
I could still sense that something was there. Even now when I visit my
Dad I can still sense something. I felt very uncofortable in that home.
My other home I didn't fear anything and was quite confortable. It's so
strange to feel completetly two differnt ways in each home. I've wonderd
if something at my old home was warning me about the new home or if it
simply didn't want us to go. Which makes me wonder if the spirit in my
new home was the same spirit in my old home except angry with me for leaveing.
What do you think? I tend to believe it was differnt spirits and I was
being warned through my dream by a spirit that didn't want me to fear it.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Light Story &amp; misc.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: WebMaster@fire-star.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Great site as usual, was pleased to see that you added information
about ghost lights. I have been searching for information&nbsp; on such
phenomena for several months. Here's my story: My 14 YO nephew was killed
by a hit an run on the country road aprox 50 yards from the house that
I am now living in. It was&nbsp; a terrible tragedy to say the least. This
happened 3 years ago. The hit and run driver was never found, but according
to my</b>
<br><b>friends in the PA State Police, 2 people were questioned, but the
evidence was too circumstantial to prosecute them. The State Police have
the car, but found it 2 months after the incident over 55 miles away, it
was abandoned. The site where he was killed has become a shrine so to speak,
which bothers me deeply, it is adorned with photographs, memorabilia, crosses,
banners etc... I feel as if his mother and her side of the family is in
a way keeping him from resting. Not a holiday goes by that it is not decorated
for the occasion, and the media has been at this site off and on for the
past 3 years... it's very disheartening for me now that I must see it on
a daily basis since I moved into this old house where he lived, where my
grandparents lived also.We call this area where these past events happened:
"the hollow" it's always been creepy to me for as long as I remember.My
mother recently told me a story of a man that had died very close to the
spot over 50 years ago, there is a huge oak tree (which has always bothered
me and given me bad vibes since my childhood) that supposedly this man
died of a heart attack</b>
<br><b>while sitting at the base. Also, aprox 6 years ago my now deceased
father-in-law (who was retired State Police and owned his own investigation
agency) investigated another tragic accident in the same spot. A woman,
she was a nurse, on her way to work very early one morning was killed by
a pick-up truck that totally ran over her vehicle by drifting into her
lane. I have never seen these ghost lights, but from my family members
that live in this small coal mining area outside of Hazleton Pennsylvania,
they have told of seeing red orbs/globes that would actually follow them
while driving past this area by car. My 24 year old brother had told me
of the most recent incident a few months ago. He describes this red "orb"
as glowing from within, it will only follow the car so far, and also speeds
up to sort of "hang" near the back end of the drivers side window. He was
really shaken up about this, and tried to get away from it by speeding
up. My 84 yo aunt had a very similar incident. My mother had the same incident
happen to her nearly 20 years ago. On all accounts, they all say that the
red orb seems to only follow so far, then disappears.We have many "old"
stories from this area about ghost activities, the European people that
came to this coal mining area&nbsp; where always telling stories of ghosts
and hauntings, seems that the old Catholics are the most superstitious
of all.</b>
<br><b>I'll share a few stories with you, and I'll keep them brief:</b>
<br><b>My grandfather has returned to the house I am living in now, after
his death. My mom was in deep morning for months and he returned to put
her mind at ease. He also died in a tragic car accident. He returned to
her in broad daylight dressed as if he was going off to work in the mines
stating "Annette, it was hell in the beginning, but look at me, I am ok
now."He returned to shake my grandmother awake one night, my parents where
not quite asleep in the adjoining bedroom, when they heard footsteps and
heard my grandfathers voice say "Mary...MARY!" my grandmothers name. My
grandmother was shaken awake by him so she recalls.</b>
<br><b>Also, they have heard him whistle thru the house, he always whistled
certain tunes. The family dog at that time would appear to jump up on nothing
at all, and get all excited wagging it's tail and barking. My grandmother,
God rest her soul, always told me a story of a Ghost Horse, that would
follow the women home thru the woods when they were walking home from town
from working in the silk mill.The story that bothered me the most, was
of these fuzzy creatures, doglike, that would bump and rub up next to them,
and they only appeared to be an outline of some sort of animal. My gram
told me you could actually feel them with your hands, sort of like hairy
or fuzzy... electrical field? *shrug* I have never heard of such a thing
before.. but I am looking.My gram and my mother have said that my grandfather
and a few of the villages men went out one night with rifles and they accounted
to them that when they shot at these things they exploded into white light.
I am not so sure I believe these stories, but scared the bejesus out of
me when I was young.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Cadilliac...</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dsutekh@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A friend of mine and I went to Laguna Beach, CA
to visit my aunt and uncle. My uncle provided us with an old black Cadillac
from his car dealership for us to drive while we were there. The first
odd occurrence in this automobile happened when my friend and I decided
to drive to San Diego at around 9 p.m.. It takes about an hour and a half
to get there from my aunts house so we had a long drive. Despite the fact
that we were supposed to be out having fun and enjoying ourselves, there
was an overwhelming dismal atmosphere in the car the entire drive. There
seemed to be faint moans and groans coming from the back seat but those
were easily disregarded due to the age of the car. By the time we got to
San Diego, we both felt so awful we turned around and went back home and
suffered this overbearing atmosphere of sadness and despair. A few days
later, we had a more tangible experience. I was driving through a strip
mall, my friend in the passenger seat, when both of us distinctly heard
a male voice call my name from behind my left shoulder. Thinking it was
coming from someone in the parking lot who knew me, I looked over my shoulder
only to find that there was no one around and even if there was all of
the windows in the car were up so it obviously came from the back seat.
I immediately looked to my friend and acknowledged that we both heard my
name and there was no way it could have come from anywhere else other than
the back seat.</b>

<br><b>Found My Gift</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ksmcgee@interbel.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I've always felt alone in the many experiences that I've had,
so your website provides is of great comfort and interest to me.&nbsp;
The story I will write below shares one of my earliest experiences with
a spirit.&nbsp; Well, here goes...</b>
<br><b>When I was a girl (about 8 years old) living in northern New Jersey
in what used to be an old farmstead, my Grandmother gifted me with an old
watch of hers that I loved.&nbsp; The watch was tiny and covered in rhinestones
- really gaudy, but I loved it anyway even though it didn't work any longer.&nbsp;
I wore the watch every day faithfully until one day I lost it.&nbsp; I
searched the house and the grounds and couldn't find it.&nbsp; I was so
heartbroken that I even had my father snake all the toilets and drains
in the house looking for it.&nbsp; I cried and cried over the watch and
apologized to my grandmother for losing it.&nbsp; I went to bed crying
that night and was awoken by a feeling that I couldn't move my legs underneath
the blankets.&nbsp; I opened my eyes and looked down at the foot of my
bed, and a woman was sitting there with her back to me.&nbsp; Her hair
was piled atop her head and she wore a high-necked shirt.&nbsp; I knew
that I wasn't seeing things, because my night-light was on (being afraid
of the dark as I was) and it was bright enough to see her clearly.&nbsp;
I didn't feel scared for some reason though.&nbsp; She never turned to
face me, but she patted the bed ever so lightly near my feet several times.&nbsp;
When I asked her why she was here, she did the same - patting the bed with
the palm of her right hand several times.&nbsp; She was suddenly gone.&nbsp;
I somehow got back to sleep and awoke remembering her visit.&nbsp; I got
out of bed and began to inspect the spot where she was sitting.&nbsp; I
unfolded several layers of blankets and to my surprise, there was the watch.&nbsp;
I thanked her out loud right there</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and then, even though I wasn't sure if she could hear me.&nbsp;
I asked her to come back and visit, but I never saw her again.&nbsp; After
that incident, I sometimes felt as though I was being watched and would
turn quickly to see who was there - I never saw anyone.&nbsp; I was never
able to find out who had lived in the house when it was first built, but
I have a feeling it was her.&nbsp; She came to help me and I am still grateful.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for providing an outlet for people like me to share their
experiences.&nbsp; Your website is great and I visit it often.</b><b></b>

<p><b>House Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: suzielda@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Here is some details of the past year. In my final year of university
I</b>
<br><b>moved into a house with a girl and a guy that were already living
there. The</b>
<br><b>girl that had my room before me was a little bit odd and didn’t
speak to me</b>
<br><b>when I came round but at the time I didn’t really think anything
of it.</b>
<br><b>>From the moment I moved in I was uncomfortable in my room.&nbsp;
I tried to</b>
<br><b>ignore it and even considered that it may be ‘bad vibes’ (whatever
they are)</b>
<br><b>left behind from the girl before. In fact I even tried against my
better</b>
<br><b>judgement some crystals which were supposed to get rid of the bad
energy but</b>
<br><b>amazingly enough that didn’t work!</b>
<br><b>For the first time in my life (can I just say I have lived in lots
of places</b>
<br><b>and am quite independent) I couldn’t sleep in my room with the light
off and</b>
<br><b>eventually I developed really bad insomnia. I started hearing voices
at</b>
<br><b>night arguing. This would go on for hours at a time, a man and woman.
I</b>
<br><b>convinced myself this was something coming through the walls and
started</b>
<br><b>having the tv as well as the light on to drown out the noise.&nbsp;
(I am quite</b>
<br><b>deaf and rarely hear people in the same room nevermind through walls.)</b>
<br><b>This pretty much went on all year whilst I was trying to ignore
it and</b>
<br><b>really I didn’t think too much about it as I was busy at uni. During
the</b>
<br><b>course of the year I met the neighbours on both sides and discovered
that a</b>
<br><b>single girl lived on one side and a single guy on the other so I
dunno what</b>
<br><b>the voices were.</b>
<br><b>A couple of months before I left I was having real trouble sleeping
one</b>
<br><b>night and so I decided to try sleeping in the living room. As soon
as I lay</b>
<br><b>down on the sofa I heard somebody say quite clearly and loudly in
my ear</b>
<br><b>‘hello and my name’ I jumped up at once but there was nobody in
the room. In</b>
<br><b>hindsight I should have said something but I was so shocked I just
got up</b>
<br><b>and went back upstairs.</b>
<br><b>A couple of other times I was up late in the living room and I heard</b>
<br><b>somebody walk in the door behind me and felt a tug on my t-shirt.
I would</b>
<br><b>turn round and there was nobody there. Eventually I told my house
mate and</b>
<br><b>joked about going mad. She said that’s odd because apparently my
other house</b>
<br><b>mate had joked about being mad too. The guy had got up late one
night to get</b>
<br><b>a drink one time when I was away and saw me sitting in the living
room. He</b>
<br><b>had told my other housemate I was back but when he realised I was
still away</b>
<br><b>decided it was a dream. It occurred to me later that if he had seen
someone</b>
<br><b>a bit like me sitting in the living room whilst he was half asleep
he may</b>
<br><b>have thought it was me.</b>
<br><b>One evening I came back in late and fell asleep on the sofa whilst
watching</b>
<br><b>tv. I woke up suddenly to find an invisible force pushing me really
hard off</b>
<br><b>the sofa. Always bad tempered when I am woken up I pushed back very
hard for</b>
<br><b>a while until it stopped and I fell asleep again. I think that I
had a dream</b>
<br><b>about having a row with a woman in the living room but it is a bit
hazy. I</b>
<br><b>was woken up by my bloke housemate coming in and asking me if I
had been</b>
<br><b>moving about. I said no I was asleep and he said that he had heard
someone</b>
<br><b>come in the door and jangle their keys and was coming down to see
who it</b>
<br><b>was. I was reluctant to say that I thought it was someone invisible
and he</b>
<br><b>later told me that I looked so awful he thought I may have had carbon</b>
<br><b>monoxide poisoning (I didn’t) and he told me to go to bed.</b>
<br><b>After this I was a bit reluctant to stay in the house as whilst
‘hello’s are</b>
<br><b>a bit weird being pushed off the sofa is more nasty. I started sleeping
on</b>
<br><b>friend’s floors and only coming back in the daytime. One time I
stayed a bit</b>
<br><b>late after it got dark and I found like a scratched handprint on
my leg</b>
<br><b>which couldn’t have been mine. When I showed my housemate she started</b>
<br><b>believing me. I thought I saw a figure walk into the living room
once and</b>
<br><b>really freaked out. I stayed out of the house until it was time
to move.</b>
<br><b>On the last night I was stuck there packing my stuff up and for
the final</b>
<br><b>two hours I felt constant scratching down my back. I had to finish
packing</b>
<br><b>so I ignored it as it wasn’t really painful just uncomfortable.
Every so</b>
<br><b>often the scratching would stop and I would feel something like
someone</b>
<br><b>stoking down the side of my face. Every time that happened I would
turn in</b>
<br><b>that direction and say hello and the scratching on my back would
begin</b>
<br><b>again.</b>
<br><b>The girl who used to live in my room before me apparently was totally
fine</b>
<br><b>before she moved in became slowly weirder over the year, she began
accusing</b>
<br><b>my housemates of having an affair (which they weren’t) and insisted
they</b>
<br><b>were going in her room when she was out. This makes me wonder now
whether</b>
<br><b>she was experiencing weird stuff but she entirely stopped speaking
to anyone</b>
<br><b>by the time she left so it is hard to know.</b>
<br><b>When I left I said ‘goodbye and please don’t follow me’ to the living
room</b>
<br><b>and my bloke housemate who was already a bit dodgy about me decided
I was</b>
<br><b>definitely mad. He did say he thought that he was going to be stabbed
once</b>
<br><b>in the kitchen but that it was just his imagination.</b>
<br><b>Sorry to go on so long. I did investigate the house a bit (which
is over a</b>
<br><b>hundred years old) but I haven’t found anything interesting.</b>

<p><b>Lady in Mauve</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: vanessa@quickclic.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>One day at work my friend and myself went to get something to eat
at the cafeteria that was in the far end of where we worked .&nbsp; It
was christmas time so there was only a few people working at the time.I
was standing with my friend&nbsp; and we were both looking at the vending
machines.&nbsp; All of a sudden my friend said to me, "What is that old
lady doing here at work"&nbsp; I turned around and noticed a figure about
25 feet away from us.</b>
<br><b>She was dressed in a mauve flowered dress and had her hair in a
bun.&nbsp; I said to my friend, "I wonder what she is doing here, sshe
must be lost or something"&nbsp; My friend said</b>
<br><b>to me "what old lady" and when I turned to look at the old lady
she was gone.&nbsp; The floor was old and made creaky noises when walked
on and we never heard her leave, unless she was a very light and fast walker
to leave so quick.When I got home I mentioned this to my mother and my
mother informed me that my Grandmother was buried in a mauve flowered dress,
and I remember that she wore her hair in a bun just like the figure did.</b>
<br><b>The most weird part of the whole eposide is that my friend who saw
the old lady and told me to look around said she never saw her, just something
told her to tell me to turn around and look at the back of the room we
were in.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Old Orphanage</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dannyf152@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This isn't about a personal experience.&nbsp; Ive never had one but
it interests</b>
<br><b>me very much.&nbsp; Anyways, my mom is a teacher and she works at
a school that</b>
<br><b>is very old and used to be an orphanage in the early 1900's.&nbsp;
This building</b>
<br><b>has four floors and the fourth floor has been condemned because
it is</b>
<br><b>unsafe.&nbsp; There have been a lot of weird things that have happened
in this</b>
<br><b>building.</b>
<br><b>The first in recent memory was about in 1990.&nbsp; A woman was
working late and</b>
<br><b>she was the last person in the entire building.&nbsp; It was about
10 at night</b>
<br><b>and she was leaving so she locked up the building and on her way
out to her</b>
<br><b>car, she noticed out of the corner of her eye that a light in a
room on the</b>
<br><b>fourth floor went on.&nbsp; She thought this was weird, and she
quickly got out</b>
<br><b>of there because she thought that someone else had been in the building
whit</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; The next day she told the guy thats in charge of the
building about</b>
<br><b>what happened and he informed her that the electricity on the fourth
floor</b>
<br><b>had been turned off 20 years ago.</b>
<br><b>The next thing that happened was on the first floor a clock on the
wall in</b>
<br><b>one of the classrooms just flew out of the wall and landed in the
middle of</b>
<br><b>the floor.&nbsp; It didn't just fall down, it projected outwards.&nbsp;
This could</b>
<br><b>have been something else like electrical problems but it was kind
of weird.</b>
<br><b>The next thing was one day a woman that was new to the school went
up on to</b>
<br><b>the fourth floor (it is condemned, but they still have keys to it
and if you</b>
<br><b>really want to you can go up there.) and she walked around the corner
and in</b>
<br><b>what used to be the orphans bathroom one of the sinks was on full
blast and</b>
<br><b>water was pouring out of it.&nbsp; She went over and turned it off
and went</b>
<br><b>downstairs and told the guy in charge of what happened and they
both went</b>
<br><b>back upstairs and he saw that the sink was still wet, he tried to
turn the</b>
<br><b>faucet back on but nothing came out.&nbsp; He told her that this
was really weird</b>
<br><b>because the water had been shut off on the fourth floor the same
time the</b>
<br><b>electricity had been.&nbsp; In about the early 70's.</b>
<br><b>The weirdest thing that happened i think was one night a woman was
working</b>
<br><b>late and she was the last one in the building.&nbsp; She was on
the second floor</b>
<br><b>and she was walking past the stairs that went up to the third floor
and all</b>
<br><b>of the sudden she heard distinct singing.&nbsp; It was like a childrens
choir</b>
<br><b>that she described.&nbsp; She didn't really think anything of it
and she left.</b>
<br><b>About a month after this an old woman that used to be an orphan
there was</b>
<br><b>visiting and walking around the whole building with a few people.&nbsp;
The woman</b>
<br><b>that heard the singing was one of them.&nbsp; When they got to the
stairs to the</b>
<br><b>third floor the old woman stopped and said, " Oh and this is where
we all</b>
<br><b>used to gather and sing."</b>
<br><b>Since then no real significant events have happened, but in the
room where</b>
<br><b>they used to hold funeral services, which is now an office, people
have</b>
<br><b>heard distinct weeping.</b>
<br><b>Ive been up to the fourth floor once during the day but nothing
weird</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; My friends and I talk about going up to the fourth
floor one</b>
<br><b>night and attempting to spend the night but Im pretty sure that
this will</b>
<br><b>never happen, or even if they will let us.</b>

<br><b>Ghost Siting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ricco@beighton63.freeserve.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in the United Kingdom in Sussex and saw
a Ghost last October , two weeks before Halloween.&nbsp; I still have difficulty
coming&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to terms with what happened and what I saw.
As up to that point I didnot believe in Ghosts. I was travelling back after
an evening out with a friend&nbsp; along a road which is the B2012 which
runs from Ardingly</b>
<br><b>to Haywards Heath. There had been a storm and I remember that a
full moon was shining. The road is twisty with many bends and passes Ardingly
college before entering woodland. On the corner of the bend 4000 yards
in front of us was a misty patch which grew rapidly in size . I didnot&nbsp;
think&nbsp; much of it at first , but as we drew nearer I saw a</b>
<br><b>shape moving or gliding in front of the vechicle. The shape which
was illuminated in the car headlights was of a human figure which was completely
invisible. (The nearest way of describing it was like in the film predator).
The</b>
<br><b>figure which was gliding stopped completely in the middle of the
road. I could see it clearly and the light from the beams shone through
it to the other side. The figure continued its journey to the passanger
side where I was seated. To my horror and surprise a full ghost materialised
in the road. It was of a man in his fifties and he was bald wearing a stripy
jumper , with a large buckle. and he had workmans boots on . The figure
stood there grinning at me in an evil way . It seemed to me to be aware
of us and was enjoying the scare it had given to us. I thought i was seeing
things so I shut my eyes and reopened them thinking the figure would go
away , but to my horror it was still there . When the ghost saw it was
having no effect in scaring me I swear that its expression became downcast
and it no longer grinned and it looked dissappointed . The car got closer
to it until we were about 500 yards , I thought we were going to hit it
, but to my surprise the ghost dematerialised. As we passed the spot in
the road I looked for it , but the figure was no were to be seen. I remarked
to my friend whether he had seen it but he claims he didnot.</b>

<br><b>Our House and Our Daughter</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Debnhar427@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened to my family ten years ago.&nbsp; We lived in a rental
house in the</b>
<br><b>small town of Portland, Tennessee.&nbsp; My daughter, Mattie, was
six months old</b>
<br><b>at the time that we moved into this house.&nbsp; It may sound strange
to some</b>
<br><b>people, but sometimes when I would look at my beautiful baby girl,
I would</b>
<br><b>get the spookiest feeling, like she was looking straight into my
soul.</b>
<br><b>The first time we really noticed something strange was one night
when I was</b>
<br><b>awakened by a rat-a-tat sound that kept repeating over and over.&nbsp;
I woke my</b>
<br><b>husband up from his sleep.&nbsp; He heard it too.&nbsp; He grabbed
the flashlight and</b>
<br><b>creeped to the door.&nbsp; We always slept with our door open, so
I could hear</b>
<br><b>Mattie if she woke up in the night.&nbsp; Her bedroom door was directly
opposite</b>
<br><b>ours down the hall.&nbsp; My husband sent the flashlight beam down
the hallway,</b>
<br><b>and let out a slight explicative.&nbsp; I went to see what was wrong.&nbsp;
Mattie was</b>
<br><b>sitting up in her baby crib looking at us.&nbsp; She was as white
as a sheet and</b>
<br><b>her eyes looked like two black holes.&nbsp; She had a stuffed koala
that she slept</b>
<br><b>with in her hand and was running it up and down the bars of her
crib...hence,</b>
<br><b>the rat-a-tat we heard.&nbsp; My husband quietly said, "Mattie stop
that and lay</b>
<br><b>down."&nbsp; She fell straight backwards in her bed.&nbsp; We went
in there, and Mattie</b>
<br><b>was sound asleep.</b>
<br><b>When Mattie was around eighteen months, she absolutely refused to
sleep in</b>
<br><b>her room.&nbsp; She would scream all night.&nbsp; She had no problem
playing in there</b>
<br><b>during the day, but at night, she would not go near the door.&nbsp;
She claimed</b>
<br><b>there was a "witch" in her toy box.&nbsp; She would not watch anything
on</b>
<br><b>television that may have a witch in it...not even the comedy show
"Bewitched"</b>
<br><b>or Disney's "Ducktales" if she thought Magica the witch would be
on it.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>never watched violent movies or anything with gore.&nbsp; One night,
we came home</b>
<br><b>from my in-laws' house and Mattie fell asleep in her carseat.&nbsp;
I thought I</b>
<br><b>could sneak her into her bed and we would all get a good night's
sleep.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>kind of woke up as I carried her into her bedroom so I sat in a
chair and</b>
<br><b>rocked her (I didn't turn on the light so I wouldn't wake her further).&nbsp;
All</b>
<br><b>of the sudden, the worst screeching noise came from inside the closet.&nbsp;
Not a</b>
<br><b>voice, but the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard.&nbsp; It was
like someone was</b>
<br><b>clawing at the inside of her closet door.&nbsp; I screamed for my
husband and ran</b>
<br><b>out of the room with Mattie screaming in my arms "The witch!&nbsp;
The witch!"&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>never put her in that room again, nor did I go in there after dark.</b>
<br><b>When Mattie was around three, she began having "conversations" with
someone</b>
<br><b>in her room during the day (remember, I said she would play in there
during</b>
<br><b>daylight hours).&nbsp; I thought it was just your typical imaginary
friend thing</b>
<br><b>going on.&nbsp; Mattie was an only child at the time, and didn't
have anyone</b>
<br><b>around our neighborhood to play with.&nbsp; That's when the stereo
started going</b>
<br><b>whacko.&nbsp; I was sitting in the living room, my husband was in
the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>The stereo came on by itself.&nbsp; Well, it had a remote control,
and I thought</b>
<br><b>my husband was playing a prank.&nbsp; I told him to stop.&nbsp;
He came into the room</b>
<br><b>empty handed.&nbsp; The remote was in a drawer on the stereo that
held tapes.</b>
<br><b>Okay, we thought, it got caught on something, pressed down and the
power</b>
<br><b>button depressed turning on the stereo.&nbsp; The remote had no
batteries in it.</b>
<br><b>The stereo kept coming on and off, on and off.&nbsp; My husband
unplugged it.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>stereo came on and off, on and off...with the power cord in my husband's</b>
<br><b>hand.&nbsp; Then the stations changed...tuner went up and down the
dial and back</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; Volume went up and down too.&nbsp; We were slightly
unnerved.&nbsp; We did get</b>
<br><b>used to this, in fact it eventually became the family joke.&nbsp;
A girl of ten</b>
<br><b>lived next door to us and used to like to come over and help me
in the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She played with Mattie some, but would leave when Mattie would
include her</b>
<br><b>"friend."&nbsp; One day, Charity (the neighbor girl) was helping
me with the</b>
<br><b>decorations for Mattie's fourth birthday.&nbsp; We were in the kitchen
when the</b>
<br><b>stereo suddenly came on by itself.&nbsp; The volume started doing
its loud/soft</b>
<br><b>thing.&nbsp; It finally went to maximum volume.&nbsp; I laughed
and said "okay, that's</b>
<br><b>enough, turn it back down or turn it off."&nbsp; The volume turned
down and the</b>
<br><b>music played normally.&nbsp; Charity jumped off the chair and ran
out of the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; She did not come back for a long time.&nbsp; To this
day, she is still</b>
<br><b>unnerved by that memory.</b>
<br><b>Mattie had named her "friend" Tee-Nee-Aww-Nah.&nbsp; She became
engrossed in</b>
<br><b>playing with her friend.&nbsp; Sometimes, I would hear a woman humming
a</b>
<br><b>lullabye-sounding song.&nbsp; While I was out washing the car one
day, I saw a</b>
<br><b>woman in an old-time homespun dress, perhaps from the early 1800s,
standing</b>
<br><b>at the doorway of the livingroom looking out at me...she smiled.&nbsp;
After that,</b>
<br><b>I was never really afraid.&nbsp; We had lived here for three years,
and nothing</b>
<br><b>really bad had happened.&nbsp; But Mattie would still not sleep
in her room.</b>
<br><b>One night at dinner, I decided to ask Mattie about Tee-Nee-Aww-Nah
(her</b>
<br><b>spelling).&nbsp; Mattie said she had long black hair, dark eyes,
and was wearing a</b>
<br><b>pink dress.&nbsp; She said her lips were black and she had "blood
all over her,</b>
<br><b>right here."&nbsp; She rubbed a circle on her chest.&nbsp; THIS
unnerved me.&nbsp; I asked</b>
<br><b>why she had blood on her.&nbsp; Mattie said she was killed by her
father with an</b>
<br><b>ax.&nbsp; That scared me, but it didn't seem to bother Mattie.</b>
<br><b>Mattie continued to play with Tee-Nee-Aww-Nah.&nbsp; When Mattie
turned five, her</b>
<br><b>grandmother bought her a Disney Little Mermaid comforter for her
bed and</b>
<br><b>matching curtains.&nbsp; Mattie was never afraid to sleep in her
room again.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>said "Ariel is protecting me and Tee-Nee-Aww-Nah."&nbsp; That year
she also got a</b>
<br><b>little sister and we needed a bigger house.</b>
<br><b>We moved two doors down from this house.&nbsp; Mattie was sad because
she said</b>
<br><b>Tee-Nee-Aww-Nah could not come with us.&nbsp; I asked her why not,
and she said</b>
<br><b>because she couldn't she had to stay at the old house.&nbsp; We
didn't hear of</b>
<br><b>Tee-Nee-Aww-Nah for along time.&nbsp; Mattie grew up, and we moved
to Nashville.</b>
<br><b>She is now fourteen.&nbsp; Her dad and I divorced, and while he
stayed in</b>
<br><b>Nashville, I moved back to my hometown of Portland.&nbsp; We live
just around the</b>
<br><b>corner from our old house.&nbsp; Mattie came in from "exploring"
one day and said</b>
<br><b>she saw Tee-Nee-Aww-Nah at our old house.&nbsp; We live in a house
now that is 130</b>
<br><b>years old, and directly across the street from the city cemetery
(am I asking</b>
<br><b>for it or what?).&nbsp; Mattie is thriving.&nbsp; She sometimes
still talks to people</b>
<br><b>who aren't there, and I don't mean to herself.&nbsp; It is like
I can only hear</b>
<br><b>one side of the conversation (like she is on the telephone).&nbsp;
We hear noises</b>
<br><b>and bumps and groans and occasional voices here too, but as long
as Mattie</b>
<br><b>keeps her mind open, I believe we have nothing to fear.</b>
<br><b>Mattie would never tell us what scared her so badly in her room
for those</b>
<br><b>three years that she wouldn't sleep in there.&nbsp; Or why she thought
the Little</b>
<br><b>Mermaid would protect her.&nbsp; Whenever we brought it up, just
in conversation,</b>
<br><b>she would clam up.&nbsp; She would talk about Tee-Nee-Aww-Nah, she
even talks</b>
<br><b>about seeing a couple of our friends and family that have passed
away, but</b>
<br><b>she never will talk about what evil horrible thing "The Witch in
the toybox"</b>
<br><b>was.</b>
<br><b>No one has stayed in that house for longer than six months after
we moved</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; It is empty as I write this.&nbsp; I sometimes want to
go to it and see what</b>
<br><b>will happen...but I never do. Mattie does sometimes.&nbsp; She also
enjoys walking</b>
<br><b>in the cemetery.&nbsp; Is Mattie psychic?&nbsp; Does she have a
gift?&nbsp; Is she sensitive</b>
<br><b>to the nonliving beings that walk this earth?&nbsp; Yes, I believe
she is, and I</b>
<br><b>think she always has been, from the day she was born.&nbsp; I encourage
her to</b>
<br><b>keep her mind open to these ideas, not to close herself off from
the idea of</b>
<br><b>ghosts.&nbsp; She is your typical teenage girl, with a twist.&nbsp;
Did we have a</b>
<br><b>ghost?&nbsp; Yes, I believe we had several...Tee-Nee-Aww-Nah, the
woman I saw and</b>
<br><b>heard singing (her mother?) and the evil Witch (her father?).&nbsp;
I believe we</b>
<br><b>still have them.&nbsp; I will always believe in ghosts.</b>

<br><b>Figure in the Bedroom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ocupante@minn.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My friend's father told us this story this summer;</b>
<br><b>When he was a child, about five years old, his family lived in an</b>
<br><b>apartment building in Minneapolis. They had the whole floor to</b>
<br><b>themselves, about nine rooms. He shared a room with his younger
brother.</b>
<br><b>I don't know how long the haunting went on but one night, he remembers</b>
<br><b>waking up and seeing a tall, dark figure standing over his brother's</b>
<br><b>bed. His brother was asleep and unaware of the figure. It was dressed
in</b>
<br><b>an overcoat and a hat. He could see the glint of it's eyes beneath
the</b>
<br><b>hat. He pulled the covers up over his head and hoped that it would
go</b>
<br><b>away. When he looked over the covers again, the figure was standing
at</b>
<br><b>the foot of his bed, looking down at him. He could see the eyes
beneath</b>
<br><b>the brim of the hat but no other facial features. He started screaming</b>
<br><b>and pulled the covers up again. His parents ran into the but the
figure</b>
<br><b>had vanished by then. He didn't think that the figure was threatening</b>
<br><b>but he didn't get the impression that it was friendly either. It
wasn't</b>
<br><b>a happy experience.</b>

<p><b>"sleep paralysis"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: WillsMermaid@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In 1995 I was living in the house I grew up in, with my brother and
family</b>
<br><b>friend.&nbsp; The house is located in Long Beach, California.</b>
<br><b>Two days before I moved in the house my brother and room mate told
me that</b>
<br><b>strange things had been happening in the home. The beds were shaking,</b>
<br><b>floating heads were scene, and voices were heard. I blew it off
as them</b>
<br><b>having too much to drink.</b>
<br><b>The day before I moved in, I was picking up my last load of things
from my</b>
<br><b>former apartment. The drive normally took 30 minutes. On this trip
(at 12 am)</b>
<br><b>It took 2 1/2 hours.&nbsp; When I got back to the Long Beach house
my room mate</b>
<br><b>came running out of the house saying that he was missing 2 1/2 hours.
I</b>
<br><b>freaked out ands told him what had happened to me.&nbsp; We had
both missed 2 1/2</b>
<br><b>hours at the exact same time.</b>
<br><b>In the next few weeks I started to see a man in the house. I could
see him as</b>
<br><b>plain as I could see my own reflection. He was wearing brown pants
and a plad</b>
<br><b>flannel shirt. He had dark hair and a tan complexion.&nbsp; My room
mate had seen</b>
<br><b>him a few times also.&nbsp; Until one night we had some friends
over and a vapor</b>
<br><b>appeared from the floor.&nbsp; It was about 3-4 feet tall. Then
it disappeared and</b>
<br><b>about 1 foot away from where it disappeared, it reappeared this
time out of</b>
<br><b>the sealing. (still 3-4 feet long)&nbsp; Needless to say the party
didn't last</b>
<br><b>much longer.</b>
<br><b>Later that night my room mate, Nick, was asleep on the couch. He
awoke to a</b>
<br><b>man saying "Nick get up now!!!!".&nbsp; At the foot of the couch
was a large</b>
<br><b>mirror. In the mirror you could see the reflection of the living
room and the</b>
<br><b>window on the far wall. In the reflection of the window&nbsp; Nick
could see a</b>
<br><b>dark figure crawling through into the room. He turned to look at
the window</b>
<br><b>itself, nothing was there. He then looked at the reflection and
saw the dark</b>
<br><b>figure was crouching beside him. Nick closed his eyes in hopes that
when he</b>
<br><b>reopened them the thing would be gone. Instead his was pinned to
the couch.</b>
<br><b>He says that he couldn't open his eyes, nor move any part of his
body.&nbsp; Then</b>
<br><b>he thought to himself, "Nick, just move your arm!". At that moment
he heard a</b>
<br><b>deep "death metal" voice say "Nick just move your arm," and then
a laugh. He</b>
<br><b>jumped up, turned on the lights and came to get me. He told me the
story, and</b>
<br><b>after a few hours we fell asleep. Me on the floor, and Nick on the
couch.</b>
<br><b>Sometime later I heard someone trying to tell me something. I opened
my eyes</b>
<br><b>to see if it was Nick, but he was asleep. Then the mirror caught
my eye. The</b>
<br><b>dark figure that Nick was talking about was coming back. I screamed
and Nick</b>
<br><b>jumped up. I ran for the lights and turned them on. The air in the
room</b>
<br><b>smelled electric and foul. Almost like a cross between an electrical
short</b>
<br><b>and fecal matter.</b>
<br><b>With in a month all of us had abandoned the house. I have never
spoken of</b>
<br><b>this with anyone except Nick, until now.&nbsp; Hopefully things
like this can be</b>
<br><b>explained.&nbsp; I just pray that nobody else has to go through
the things that</b>
<br><b>Nick and I did.</b>
