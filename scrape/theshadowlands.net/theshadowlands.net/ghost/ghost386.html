<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Anndi, I'm
from<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mi, and this is my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When i was younger, my
family and I had moved up here to Gladwin from downstate. We were moving into
an apartment in this Small little town until we could find the house we wanted.
The apartment was visibly older and we were moving into the upstairs. It seemed
nice, and we liked it, especially my sister and i because we were able to have
our own rooms finally! But then... things started changing. I would be walking
down the hallway to my room, and get scared (no one really thought anything of
it, i was eight years old, all eight year olds get scared in the dark) but then
when we thought we could hear someone running up and down the hall, was when we
started wondering. I had a night light in my room, and i would always see
shadow's, scary shawdow's that would leave me up all night afraid to go to
sleep. I would have dreams about a girl my age in an older looking night gown,
walking up and down the hallway to my room, and when she would come in my room,
she would go over to the window facing the neighbor's house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It all seemed scary, until
it actually happened. I was woke up by her, this real ghost that would wander
around in my room. I was scared half to death and would scream for my mother
almost every night. One night we were going to another neighbor's house for
a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>New Year's Eve party, and I was called
into the living room to talk to the adult's. somehow they had gotten on the
subject of the phenomena that was waking me up every night. My dad had
explained to them what i described this girl to looked like, and well, a couple
at the party seemed to know exactly who i was talking about. Come to find out,
the house my family was renting at the time being, was the original funeral
home from back when Gladwin was first originated (early 1800's), and later,
there was a girl who had died one night from being hit by a car, right in front
of her house, the house facing MY bedroom window. The lady that still lives in
the house, was the girls mother, and at the time the girl had died, the funeral
home was still in business. The girls funeral, had been held in the home i was
living in. (How dreadful, yes i know....)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So, one day, my dad had
finally saw the ghost i claimed to see, and he spoke to her. He said, You need
to go where it is you need to go, and leave my home, because your scaring my
daughter, and she doesn't like this. Go where it is.....and after that, we
never saw her again, so we're guessing she must have went to the light, or
maybe the house next door...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">other things like the piano
my sister and i had, would start playing in the middle of the night when we
would have friends over, or the window in my room facing my neighbor's house
would be open, or kitchen cupboard doors would be wide open, but, that's what
the spirits do i guess. I have other haunting's i have experienced i could
share with you, but maybe another day. Thank You for your time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When i was about 5 or 6
years old i lived in a little house in millstone. This house is about 1 minute
from where i live now and i feel alot of paranormal actions. Well when i lived
in the little house me and my grandma were sitting watching t.v on the couch
when i heard a bang.I got up and looked around nothing was there. So i sat back
down and i heard the sound again and this time my grandmother heard it to. We
noticed that the sound had been comeing from the front door. so we went to the
door and saw<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2 figures one of a woman
and the other of a man. They looked like they were haveing an argument slaming
our door. So then my grandmother had actually know those figures once before.
The females ghost was named Marian and the males name was Tom. They had lived
there years before us and were married for along time. I was freaked out. I
went to sleep when the very next day i awoke with the female figure beside my
bed and she said to me Bianca (my name) you have grown<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my darling it was like she was right there .
Then the next sighting was when i was in the bathroom in the shower my gram had
just left to get me a towle and i saw Marian again in the mirror humming you
are my sunshine the song i loved when i was little while brushing her hair. I
got out of the shower and steapted closer to her and said do you need help to
cross over to the other side. She answered to me no my sweet this is my home
and vanished. There was one last sighting before we moved. That was when i was
staring at my door when the male sight walked in he said to me you have changed
my room this is where i was hung. I ran out screaming and asked my grandmother
how he died and she said he was hanged i was shacking. No more sightings came
after that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was about 15 years
old, I was at home by myself. I was at home on a school afternoon, home a
little early. I wasn't feeling well that day and wanting to come home to rest.
So I headed upstairs to my bedroom. Where I shut the door and laid down to read
my homework book. As I lay there I heard strange noises like my mom was home
and walking up the stairs. So I opended the door to my room to say hello. No
one there. I looked out the window to see if I could see her car, nothing
there. I decided I better get the cordless phone in case she calls. So I went
downstairs and grabbed it. I made sure that all of the windows and doors were
shut and locked too while I was at it. When I returned to my room, I noticed
that it was very cold in there. So I checked my window and it was shut and
locked too. I turned my heat up a little and continued to lay down again. Soon
I felt a little sleepy so I put my book down. Then I heard the same noises
again but louder. I was scared this time, so I just laid there in my bed. I
tried to listen for the noise a little better. Then I got up off my bed and
slowly walked towards my door. I kept hearing noises and I called out for my
mom. No answer. I was getting really scared now but I wanted to open the door
and make sure no one was there. But when I went to grab the door handle, I felt
something pass my shoulder. Something windy, yet could still be a person. Then
I felt cold air coming out from under my door from the other side. I stopped
and said hello, still no answer. I was just about to grab the handle when
suddenly the door started jerking about like as if someone was pulling and
pushing on the handle. Trying to open it. It was not locked and it could have
been opened. So then I thought this must be a joke my mom is trying to play on
me. I tried to open the door and I couldn't. I let go and it jerked again. I
was really scared now...so I ran back to my bed and began to call my mom. There
was no dial tone. The phone wasn't even on. I got back up again to try and get
out, this time the door opened. It was so cold in the hallway and I didn't see
any one. I continued to call out. I walked over the heater, only to find that
it was all the way off. I then got my shoes on and walked over to my friends
house, I didn't want to stay home. But on my way there I felt that same thing
move past me like a windy person. Whispering in my ear:
"chicken"...and then I got hot. I realized I had 2 sweaters and a
jacket on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I don't know what it was all
about, but it was enough to scare me and make me believe that there are other
forces in this world other than us humans. I do believe in ghosts, and now I'm
not so much of a chicken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: fasslgm81@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i have several stories of
hauntings in a house i grew up in on the south side of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">chicago</st1:City></st1:place>. We lived in the house for around 17
years. Anywho....where to begin? my first experience with the supernatural was
when i was about 5 years old. I saw red eyes in my sister's room in the attic.
I know that red eyes can't be a good thing, but since you have had experiences
with the paranormal, why do you think red eyes are bad, or are they bad? This
question still lies within after 19 years. I never experienced anything like
that after that happened. I have also heard footsteps, felt a heaviness in the
air, heard voices, heard things being thrown to the floor, but I've never
actually seen a ghost. I think i saw a silhouette of a person at the foot of my
bed, but I don't know if i really saw it because it was like as soon as i saw
it, it ran out of my room. I'm not sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me,
or if i really saw it. i am also curious about the fact that out of the five
people that lived in my house, more things have happened to me than to any of
them. My sister heard a man and a woman's voice outside of her bedroom door
only once or twice, but I heard it every night after it became my room. I can
also remember everyone in the house hated going in the basement and in the
attic after dark because you constantly felt like someone was watching over
your shoulder. if you have an feedback for me from the things you've
experienced, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks for your time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi I would like to enter a
story of my own to your collection. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Growing up between the ages
of 10-18 we lived in a two story house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Houston</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>. I have always been
sensitive to "feelings" or "presence of good or evil". My
mother &amp; I would go different garage sales and if I got "that
feeling" I would tell I will stay in the car and just not go up that
particular house. Anyway, we lived in this house I have always felt a presence
there. Alot of times I would be doing girlie things in the mirror makeup hair
etc, killing time (at home by myself) and I would someone actually running up
the stairs awaiting to see someone turn the corner and nothing. So I would look
down the stairs and no one would be there. On one occasion I heard my mother
call out my name I went into her bedroom where I thought she was I said
"Ma'am!" then only to find her snoring. Over time little things would
happen then one while I was at school my mother told me of a day she claimed to
have been taking a nap in my room (I really think she was snooping throug my
stuff) well any how she was taking a "nap" on my bed which was set
underneath an outside window (next to a window was a large drawing of my late
grandparents). So she is sleeping only to wake up to "something"
tickling her face. She opened her eyes and found this spirit hovering over her
head running it's hands quickly and softly over her face. She opened her eyes
and looked at it, when it realized she was awake looking at it, it flew through
that picture and out of the house. One time a preacher had come over (not for
the spirits) he was a family friend and even he mentioned that the house was
evil, and blessed it while he was there. He wasn't the only person who said
that same thing about that house. We moved out approx. 9 yrs ago. We now live
in a house I personally think is haunted but no one seems to believe me. Still
living in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:City>
I was at my computer in the den and I was home alone, my boyfriend was over and
said he was running to the corner store and would be right back. So when I
heard the toilet flush (A FULL FLEDGED FLUSH!!!) (b/c having worked for a
plumbing company for 3 yrs I know they sometimes flush by them selves but not
likely) I thought oh well he's back and started taking aloud about what I had
found on the Internet, I walked in the room where I thought he would be and
didn't see him so I walked through the house calling his name and then I walked
outside and the car was not there he was still gone. This<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PAN class=correction
id=""&gt;freaked me out. I stayed out side. Our commode didn't even
run meaning the flapper was not broken so I KNOW SOMEONE OR Something FLUSHED
IT! My sister-in-law when she comes over refuses to go in the back part of the
house where the master bedroom is. (She can feel presence) I too find that area
a little uneasy. Another night my boyfriend &amp; I had just come from watching
the Exercisim of Emily Rose and we were talking about it and telling stories of
the house I told him about my bedroom door opening by itself (mind you my
father just had the slab replaced or leveled two yrs prior) and about that
time, it opens. Well my father now lives there by himself and I still say it is
haunted but he seems to oblivious to it, except he says he here our Rottwieler
every now and again we had her for 10yrs and she died in the master
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Also one more thing and I
was hoping someone could give me some insight, this started about a year ago
maybe a couple of times a week, I would look at the clock and it will 1:23,
3:45, 2:34, 12:34, 4:56, always in sequence, now for the past 3mo everyday no
matter what I am doing I will look at the clock at exactly 12:34p.m. Am I going
crazy? Does anyone have an explanation? kitty2794@aim.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: jenp_96@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have always beleived in
ghosts, but it wasn't until I had my own experience where I new they were real
for sure. I had grown up listening to to all my moms old ghost stories which I
loved to hear, but it wasn't till my own experience where I didn't think of it as
fun and games anymore. I live in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Calgary</st1:City>
 <st1:State w:st="on">Alberta</st1:State></st1:place>. When I was about 3 my
parents had built our own home. It was only a few years laters when the
marriage began to run into some trouble. My house bacame a place where you
didn't want to be. After that strange things began to happen that we couldn't
explains to all of us. One night my mom woke up to a shadow walking at the end
of the bed, and when she sat up to see it disapeared. Another time my dad was
sleeping in the basement, cause of the failing marriage, and area where
whenever I went there the hair stood up on only one of my arms, which I found
strange. Anyway he saw someone standing at the end of the bed and shouted what.
We could here him talking to himself, but no one was there. But the scariest
thing that happend was one night I was sleeping in my moms bad, I was a little
freaked out from things that had been happening. I awoke at about 2am to my
back turned to my mom. All of the sudden I could feel her playing with my hair,
and I began to wonder what she was doing, all of the sud n I felt hands grab me
by my sides, almost like the person had long nails or something. It startled me
so I flipped around to see why my mom did that and she was sound asleep. To
this day I'm not sure what it was, I know it happend cause I could still feel
the touch of someone after it had happend. Not to mention I sweat I was awake.
I just couldn't explain it cause no one had ever lived in that home prior. We
sold it soon after and it has been on the market ever since, I continually see
it up for sale. I'm not sure if it was all the bad carma or what, but something
was in that house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: kc430@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've had a weird experience
when my step-grandmother was ill in March 2004.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Before visiting her in the
rehabilitation center, I stopped at Pick n' Save to buy her some flowers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wandered around trying to find something
that I thought she would like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a
sudden I discovered a small potted yellow daffodil and thought it would be
perfect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I gave my grandmother the
flower she told me three things: daffodils were her favorite flower, daffodils
are the flowers for March and her birthday was in March.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't think anything of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Three days later when my
cousin was in town, we received a phone call from my aunt telling us that my
grandmother was getting worse and they weren't sure if she would make it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, my grandmother was always a
fighter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Just when you thought that
God was going to call her home, she proved you wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My cousin and I decided to
go out with a friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about 12:00
am when my cousin got really quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked her what was wrong and she said that she just didn't feel like herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We decided to go home and sleep, because it
was getting late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 4:30 am my parents
woke us and told us that my grandmother had passed away at 12:00 am...March 11,
her birthday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Later that morning, I opened
my frontroom shade to let some light in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My cousin froze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked as
though she had seen a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me
that sometime after we got home and went to bed, she had a dream that my
grandmother was sitting in a car parked in the front of my house staring in the
direction of my house. Something kept telling my cousin to look out of my
frontroom window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She said she was too afraid
to look by herself and tried to wake me, but I was sound asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It turned out that the car
my cousin visualized in her dream was in fact the car that was parked in the
front of my house, owned by neighbors across the street, which she had never seen
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I believe that my
grandmother said goodbye to me when I visited her in the rehabilitation
center.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I honestly believe that the
dream my cousin had was a way for my grandmother to say goodbye to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dream was meant only for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's why she was unable to wake me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stilborn.....he took the baby and put it in a box and buried it under a old
barn....in time the barn had fallen down on the babys grave.....when the men
and boys would go coon hunting they would feel something watching them and they
would look around and see a small white figure of a baby following
them.....they say that if you are in the woods after midnight on a full moon
night and special holidays.....that the baby will try to follow you home
............ (2) The second story my family told was that there was a family of
3.....a daddy,mommy and a daughter back in the horse and buggy days....they was
riding down the old train tracks in Meadowbrook....something had spooked the
horse and the horse went into the swamp....they say that there are times when
you can hear them screaming and crying out for help....if you look in the
direction of the train tracks when you hear the cry that you will see the horse
and the family trying to get out of the swamp...... Thank you, Debbie (<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>) Dunn<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi, my name is Becca and i
was reading your real-life ghost stories and thought i'd add my experiences to
the list.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first experience i had
was when i was living in my family's second house, and i remember being woken
up by something strange, then there was this big shadow shaped like a bear in
one corner of my room. When my dad came in and checked, it vanished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Other things that have
happened include the fact that the back door at my old house always used to
open by itself. Also the first school i attended, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Knowles</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Middle School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
was supposedly haunted. One night, after dark, me and a friend of mine,
Heather, were walking along a corridor and we heard this noise behind us. We
both turned round, but no one was in the corridor except us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then at my third school, <st1:place w:st="on">St. Andrews</st1:place>, one of the top-floor classrooms has a white
board that moves by itself when no one is nearby. Lots of people have seen it
happen. Also i remember seeing, in my last year there, someone, a colored
person, dressed in what seemed to be a Chimney sweep's uniform walk past me and
turn the corner of the corridor and vanish. I was right behind her, and there
was no way she could have opened a door without out me hearing it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The last and most recent
occurence happened last year in the house we live in now. I had a personal
stereo sitting above my computer on a shelf, and it started to turn itself on and
off randomly. Then after a while it stopped, then started up again, only this
time the sound would increase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For 1 year I rented a large
5 bedroom farmhouse with several friends. 5 months after we moved in I saw the
apparition of a little girl (aprox. 10) in one of the downstairs bedrooms.
Several weeks later one of my roommates saw her as well in the upstairs
hallway. He gave a description of the girl that matched mine perfectly. I had not
told him what she looked like, only that I saw her. A few weeks later I saw her
again in my upstairs bedroom. A friend was visiting went upstairs and when she
came back down, she told us she thought she saw someone at the bottom of the
stairs. I asked her what she saw and she described a little girl wearing a
white floor length dress/nightgown, the same thing my roommate and I had seen,
and we'd never told anyone not living in the house about her...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">well ive had a few
experiances but ill only tell one so here it goes i have always been interested
in ghosts so heres the story "i was at the house we recently moved out of
and my aunt and her 3 kids were renting it well me and my sister were staying
all night one night and my aunt was downstairs showing my sister some stuff she
got for my 5 year old cousins well<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her
and my sister heard my other little cousins toy go off and they came running
upstairs and they said we heard grandpa so me and him went down there and then
I said grandpa if your here pull my pony tail up and it slowly moved up i was
already freaked out but i knew nothing would happen because he was our grandpa
me and my 9 year old cousin said at the same time if your here touch us we both
had a pair of shorts on and we felt somthing like fur run across our legs and
the cats or the dogs werent in the room so we<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>figured it was him crawling on the floor. so now my aunt moved out of
that house because of her ex but anyways my uncle now lives there and i stayed
with his girls and then he woke up screaming one nig for no reason and me and
my cousin said the next morning you know you woke up screaming last night he
said " i Know "<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i saw your dad

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the other day someone said
aloud in our house, " we're moving." apparently, not very smart to
say in my house. after that comment, the usual loving, keep to themselves,(
mostly ) and the quiet, ( again, mostly ) ghosts started to get VERY loud.and
not to mention wierd. for example, we had lost a remote over a year ago to our
satellite and mom and dad found it in the middle of their bed. now i KNOW<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they had changed their sheets more than once
a year. another occasion is my favorite cd has came up missing.i found the
other one that had been "misplaced" in my television which i have not
been in my room since i have partly moved out. Then there is the thumping. we
have french doors to our sunroom where i sleep.whoever it was, started banging
on them. now i can see right through the window panes and noone was there. i have
never been frightened by the spirit world, but that did it for me. i told it to
stop and it got louder and went to other rooms in the house. this went on for
three days. they have quieted down somewhat but that really did scare me and i
don't scare easily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I enjoy reading and seeing
the many things you have on your site. The queen mary truly cought my interest.
I too have had many experiences there. On one occasion in particular, My aunt,
her family and I spent the day at on the ship. My aunts crazy in a fun way so
as always we went all over the ship, even into places we<span style="">&nbsp; </span>werent supose to including employees only
places. When we were going down a stairway, almost stepping down on a last
steps before the next set of steps, we heard things be throwing about a person
yelling or arguing with someone, thing is when we tip toed down to not be
spotted we looked in and there was absolutly noone there, the room with only
one exit was a mess, only thing was noone was there. IN shock we paused then
ran. We ended up in some unknown part of the hotel portion. We came across this
old elevator shaft that hasnt been used in who knows when. We paused cause we
thought it was cool. When we did, we heard people talking and nosies as if it
was moving or working, we looked down the hallways it was only us in the
hallway. well needless to say we listened some more then ran. Other things
happened in that ship but these two incedences were so clear and could not be
explained at all. We had a great day. well anyways just wanted to stop bye and
share my story. have a nice day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3 Haunted Rentals and 2
Other Supernatural Incidents<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By:
perfectshopping@yahoo.com <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first supernatural
incident happened when I was 11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a
dream that was so realistic I woke up and thought it had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandfather was saying Goodbye to me at
the airport and telling me that he had to go now but my grandmother would stay
with me for a while longer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two weeks
later he passed away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The second supernatural
incident happened July 2005 when my father passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother called to break the news to me and
I broke down crying and said I wish he could call me just one more time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the exact moment I said that an old cell
phone that was out of service for years started to ring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was physically impossible to ring as the
battery was dead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The hauntings I have
experienced started with unlocking my car one evening under a streetlight -
there was a clear reflection of someone wearing 70s style clothing standing
right behind me but the apparition had no head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I then moved into an
apartment in an older area of town - the first incident was waking up to an
apple laying outside the fruit bowl that had child size bites all over it (I
had no children at the time).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then in
the same apartment which was a second floor apartment the window frosted over
completely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back to look out of
the window 10 minutes later and the word LIE was written in the window on the
outside behind the reens (no one could even reach that high up without a
ladder).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In another apartment my son
experienced a little girl coming out of his closet telling him to leave her
room immediately or he would die and also some decorative masks I kept on the
wall talking to him and telling him to leave or he would die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dismissed this as childish imagination
until my sons room door slammed shut and started shaking by itself (my son was
in the living room with me and nowhere near the door).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After speaking with neighbors they told me
that a woman lived there before me that practiced black magic and in the months
it was unoccupied they heard constant footsteps overhead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say I switched my apartment
immediately!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The third incident happened
at our last rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter kept
complaining there was a voodoo doll apparition that floated by her door and was
scared to sleep in her room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again
dismissing this as imagination I offered to sleep next to her that night - she
awoke in the middle of the night and pointed it out to me - it was indeed a
voodoo doll figure floating at the exact spot and moving and swaying slightly
and stayed there until I we left the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was reading your page and
I realized that I had an experience not too long ago in my apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing has happened since but I think maybe
there was something paranormal going on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night I was up about 10:00 or so and I was out on the deck of my
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I went to go back inside
I felt a twinge in the middle of my back like there was someone stading behind
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just ignored it thinking I just
had a twinge but then I distinctly felt when it left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The twinge was gone and I was certain that
there had been some kind of presence there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't see or hear anything thankfully or I would have jumped out of
my skin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was kinda cool and
looked forward to the next night to see if I would have any other strange
sensations or feelings of presences in my apartment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next night I woke up in the middle of the
night just terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't have
anything to be scared of nor did I see or hear anything but I just felt this
fear that was very strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally I
calmed down and went back to sleep but the experience taught me that you don't
go looking for trouble where you don't want it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I haven't had anything happen since thankfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I don't know if this would
count as an actual encounter or anything but it certainly made an impression on
me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I went road tripping wiith
some friends to Gilberts Cemetary (which should probably be listed in Friend,
not <st1:place w:st="on">Dorchester</st1:place>) around midnight once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got there and went up to the gilberts
grave, which was on its foundation, one of my friends layed down on the grave
and started making lude comments about Gilbert.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we got back to my car somebody shined a flashlight on my back tire
and it was flat as a pancake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last
couple of times I have been there were during the day and Gilberts headstone
has gone from laying down to upright again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also legend has it that if you see 3 dead animals on the way to the
grave you won't make it home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night
we saw two of them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The quote on the grave is
"Think of a peace of fifty years, of lives devoid of hellish fears, died
without fear of gods or ghosts, or heaven or hell with all their
hosts."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just kind of a neat
inscription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One last thing is that
another one of the taller headstones has a shotgun blast entry marking in the
front yet no exit on the backside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have pictures if you are interested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Also Me and quite a few
people have gone to Smitty's Curves on several occasions, used to live in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Geneva</st1:City></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night we took and Ouija board out to the
curves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While playing all the questions
I asked the board were answered perfectly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I asked the board what the first letter of my name was and it went to
A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everybody calls me Tony but my real
name is Anthony, nobody using the board at the time knew that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I asked it what the name of the song on
the radio was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody else listened to
Metal, and it spelled out One, which was correct, One-by Metallica.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around that time strange noises started
occuring and everybody else wanted to leave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other thing is that if you park on the bridge, turn off your car and
honk your horn three times Smitty will appear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No personal sightings yet but i have heard odd things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By:realignbaby@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The house I lived in from
age 9 to 18 was around 100 yrs. old when we moved into it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I experienced several things,
so I'll I'll try to make each story/ experience short.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I started experiencing sleep
paralysis (that's what the "experts" call it anyways) around 15 yrs.
of age and the worst s.p. episode I had happened in this house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was just falling asleep
when I started feeling tingly and weird and became instantly paralyzed. I
couldn't move or feel any part of my body and I felt enormous fear/dread --and
a very loud, almost deafening humming noise engulfed my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As the deafening humming
noise continued , my whole room started glowing the whitest light I ever seen.
The white light seemed to come from the sky....almost as if my ceiling was no
longer there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As the noise continued and
the white light practically blinded me---my stereo ( which was about two feet
away from the foot of my bed)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>turned on
and the dial started moving from station to station. It kept changing stations,
going from the lowest numbers to the highest.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>(this weird experience was semi-validated by my mom the next morning,
because she heard my radio on and then said it was off later....and when I went
to bed I did NOT have it on at all.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Other unexplained
experiences in this house all happened when I was alone EXCEPT for one that
happened when my older sister and a friend of mine spent the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We were watching t.v. and
talking and my siste had rolled a ball out into our kitchen for our dog a
couple times and our dog would go get it and come back to where we were sitting
in the livingroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About the third or fourth
time the ball was rolled out into the kitchen our dog refused to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>go get the ball and stayed right by our side.
We soon forgot about the ball.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About a half an hour later,
(we were still sitting on the couch watching t.v. and talking ) the ball rolled
all by itself from the kitchen into the livingroom and stopped at our feet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(I recently went to my high
school class reunion and my friend that spent the night and witnessed this
experience started talking about how she has never forgotten the fear we felt
and how we all screamed.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another experience I had in
this house happened when my parents went to church and I was home alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went out into the kitchen to get some ice
cream out of the freezer and my back was to the laundry room--which didn't have
a door on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've always hated the
laundry since we moved into the house. I've always felt like someone was right
behind me or close to my neck when I would walk through the laundry room (you
had to go through the laundry room to get to the only bathroom that we
had)....anyways while my back was to the laundry room doorway.....my dog came
running out into the kitchen and jumped up onto one of the kitchen chairs
closest to the laundry room door and started growling so ferociously. This dog
would NOT stop growling, even after repeated commands from me to stop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I felt such overwhelming
fear (you just had to be there to see how this dog was acting...it was NOT
normal.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyways I ended up grabbing the
dog and sitting on the couch with the dog on my lap until my parents came home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another experience was when
I was babysitting at this house for my two little cousins, who we around 6 and
7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I had put this same dog-- that
growled at the laundry room --outside on his chain to go potty. The chain was
hooked to our back screen door. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After a few minutes I asked
my cousin Todd to let the dog in (I was talking on the phone) and he stepped
outside and came right back in and said "I don't see the dog
anywhere."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I thought he was
kidding, so I went out to get the dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could not see the dog anywhere and started calling for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't see the chain anywhere on the
ground, so I turned around to look at the screen door to see if the chain was
still hooked to the metal guards on the door. To my surprise the chain was
still hooked to the door......but went straight from the door up to our roof
top!!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The chain was hanging over the
side of our roof and the collar was still attached but was snapped in two.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I started frantically calling for the dog
and he finally came running up from our backyard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was so freaked out by this
that I called the church and asked them to get my mom out of service to I could
tell her to come home. (This dog was a dachshund...so there is NO way in hell
he climbed unto our roof.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Other experiences include me
hearing someone/something VERY distinctly walking down our creaky stairsteps-
(that lead into the livingroom) where I was watching t.v.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I remember thinking "oh
Michelle (my sister) is coming downstairs"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>....then I remembered she was at work
!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and no one else was home!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>AGAIN...this house is very old and every step
creaks when you walk down it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I also had another very REAL
sleep paralysis experience when I was older and lived in an apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I remember that I got very sleepy in the
early afternoon and decided to lay down for a quick nap---I didn't even get
under the covers----<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I layed at the end
of my bed and within a ew seconds.....I started to feel that same tingly, weird
feeling that I always do when I'm going to have a s.p. experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Once I became paralyzed and
couldn't move I saw the most amazing things------I saw three seperate white
mist-like beings flying in a circle above my head. They just flew continuously
in a circle above me until I came out of my paralyzed state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have had two experiences
in the house I live in now...where someone calls my name VERY loudly and
clearly. I have been so sure that someone really called me that I have<span style="">&nbsp; </span>turned around and said "what?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Both times that this has
happened I've been home alone, exept for my husband who sleeps during the day,
because he works midnights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When this
has happened I go directly upstairs to see if he called me and both times when
I open our bedroom door he has been sound asleep snoring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've had an another
experience that happened while spending the night at my friends house when I
was about 15 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sleeping
on her bedroom floor and she was in her bed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sometime in the middle of
the night she sat up in her bed and in the pitch black of darkness she started
repeatedly saying, while looking directly at me-----"who are you, what are
you ??...who are you, what are you?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She kept saying this over and over while I was freaking out and asking
her who she was talking to.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I kept
repeatedly telling her to turn on her bed side light because I was afraid to
move.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She finally reached over and
turned on her light......BUT she just sat there staring at me.....I asked her
who she was talking to again.....and she said that she saw something FLOATING
above me while I was sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Needless to say.....I jumped
sooooo fast into her bed and slept there for the rest of the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These experiences really
happened and are still VERY VIVID in my mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi, I have seen and
experienced many different things in my life so far, but I will share the most
important to me of them with you. For as long as I can remember my mother has
had visions, seen apparitions and come into contact with some very different
things. When I was young I never believed her, that is until the night after I
turned 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother always said she was
a psyche medium. She was never loud about it, or talked about it much, she just
shared things sometimes with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
when I was really young I could sense things and had feelings about people or
things differently than other kids my age, an intuition of sorts, and as I got
older I started to put some substance behind the things my mother told me.
Well, the night after I turned 13 was the first night I actually believed with out
a shadow of a doubt what my mother had been slowly showing and sharing with me
my entire life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about eleven
thirty pm in the evening and I got ready for bed just like any other 13 year
old would. My grandmother was in her bedroom sewing and my mother was in the
living room reading a book. I brushed my teeth and told them both goodnight and
went to my room (which was in the back of the house) and climbed into bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always sleep with all the doors and curtains
closed so it was pitch black.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fell
asleep almost immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t
remember dreaming, which is odd, because even today I remember almost every
dream I have, and have had since I was a toddler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About three am in the morning, (I remember
the time because the clock was always right next to my head) I awoke suddenly
and was frightened. I was sweating, and breathing heavily. From my bed in my
room I could see the living room and the front door. My mother was standing in
the doorway telling a large scruffy looking older man in overalls, and a straw
hat, that &#8220;you can&#8217;t have her&#8221; and to go away. I sat there for a minute seeing
this in my head and trying to make myself believe that it was a dream. But it
wasn&#8217;t, because I could feel him as well as see him. I knew immediately that he
was bad. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>After sitting there for some
time I got out of bed and walked down the hall and into the living room. My
grandmother woke up hearing me open my door and asked me why I was out of bed.
My mother simply told her that I had had a bad dream and that I was sitting up
with her until I felt better. My grandmother went back to bed and my mother and
I went out on the front porch and sat there until I couldn&#8217;t feel him anymore.
She told me that it would be okay and that I would learn to better deal with
these things as I grew. And that until then, she would be there to protect me.
My mother and I have never been real close but that night I felt extremely
connected to here and have been on that level ever since. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">a couple of my buddies and i
were out going to haunted places like the headless statues in palmyra <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">tennessee</st1:State></st1:place>, and we also
went to the bell witch farm. when we were headed towards the headless statues
it was about 2 in the morning and there was a huge white horse standing in the
middle of the road, so i slammed on my brakes trying the miss it. it was really
off the wall and set up our night. after the headless statues we went to adams
tennessee to the bell witch farm, so we parked the car and went up to the bell
witch house at about 4 and we heard a train that sounded like it was 10 feet
from us, the wind was also blowing, and my friend pointed out something that
completely freaked us out, there was an evil face in the clouds and it was just
the creepiest thing, i have it on video and everytime i see it, i get cold
chills. we then wanted to go further and get on the front porch of the bell
witch house and when we went to the front steps, the lights turned on out of no
where, and you have to remember there is no one that lives in this house. so we
turned back got in the car and took off. i have all of this on video, so if you
want some screen shots of it just ask.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">yesterday, march 21 2006. I
was driving back to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">wichita</st1:City></st1:place>,
ks. from my parents house in severy. I was with my fiance and I had to pee. We
stopped at Kistlers gas station outside <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I tried the door knob and it
was locked. I barely heard a small voice, so I waited. A man used the mens room
and was in there a while. when he left I got impatient and knocked on the door.
I asked "I'm sorry, is there anyone in there." I heard clearly
"just a minute please" I thought since she was so polite i should try
to wait. After a while I got impatient again and got the attendant to check on
the bathroom. I didn't want to admit my rudeness so I only asked if someone was
in there, knowing full well I had just heard a voice in there. I did not leave
eye shot in this small gas station, and the two attendants and I were alone in
the building by this point. my fiance was still waiting patiently outside. The
attendant knocked on the door and then turned the knob. She tried again but
real hard and shoved the door inward. I was worried the (Child?) would be
startled, but the room was empty. When I went up to pay I told the girl that
opened the door that "I swear I heard a voice say 'just a minute
please'." I said I think this place is haunted. The other attendant at
this point looked at me and said "don't say that." she explained they
both thought it was haunted. I immediately went out and told Jesse. I was
shaken and I couldn't stop talking about it. He believed me but i still didn't
calm down. I have been consumed with curiosity and concern for the spirit who
may be stuck. If you investigate this at all, please contact me. If I can help
please let me know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and a few strange things have happen here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There seems to be an older man, very distinguished in the master suite
on the second floor, a woman who in the '20s was an opra singer in Toronto has
been heard singing Christmas carols, windows slamming when all 43 windows have
been replaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also there is a man who
walks around the outside of the house in a black mid length wool type winter
coat with a hat on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never does
anything other than look at the house from the back drive way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are turning this manor into a bed and
breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We don't know if our guests

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Before even hearing about
your website, I had some encounter with one of the "things" on your
website. I lived in <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Lennox Place</st1:address></st1:Street>
subdivision until last year. When I was in highschool, a buddy of mine stayed
over one night. My bed was next to the window and the couch where he was
sleeping was on the wall. We had just turned out the lights when my friend
asked where I was. I turned on the light and he was amazed to see me still in
my bed. He said he saw a shadow standing over the bed, walk over to the window,
and then walk over to him and wave it's hand in his face. It was almost as if
it was used to being ignored and was surprised to see him watch it. He said it
disappeared when the light turned on. I had never seen it before and I guess
because i wear glasses, i never saw it at night, even if it was waving it's
hand in my face. On another occasion, I was walking from the bathroom to my room.
I was looking down and when I got to my door, I waved my hand to push the door
open. Because I used to hang my bathrobe(white) on the back of the door, out of
the corner of my eye it looked like it had swung closed. My hand passed through
whatever it was. I decided not to look it in the face, I walked into my room,
and closed the door. Let me know if you have heard anything new about this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello, I had an experience
that does not scare me but always come to mind when thinking about spirits as
such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Great Aunty was dying of cancer
at the very young age of 41.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone
had been to visit her except a cousin of mine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I dragged him around to see her and he just sat there in stunned
silence, not knowing what to say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was sleeping but you could tell she was not going to be with us much
longer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her that I had brought my
cousin to see her so that she was aware of his very quiet presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later we left and I told him that it was good
that he went just incase she did pass away and he didn&#8217;t get a chance to see
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway went home and went to
bed..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night I was woken to what
felt like someone sitting beside me on my bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remembered smiling and thinking to myself, yay shes gone and isn&#8217;t
suffering anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got up to get
ready for work the next morning the phone rung at 6am and it was my Nana saying
that my Aunty had passed away through the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had passed about 1am, I really wish I had
of had a clock in my room so I could see what the time was that I felt someone
sit on my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Im positive that it was
her and that she was saying goodbye to me before she crossed over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I talked to a few family members who had also
experienced a similar thing that night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have other experiences but nothing so obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alot of it is just sensing someone is there
but not really wanting to believe it cause the thought does scare me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion I was walking down our
hallway, for some reason I never feel alone in that part of the house, during
the day Im fine but at night it is very eery, anyway I was walking down our
hallway to our bedroom and I swore that my partner was walking right behind
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When turning to talk to him he was
only just entering the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt
very uneasy about this feeling..<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By:
kouryuu_no_sakura@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Okay, so I wrote again. This
time I will tell you the story my junior high school friend told me. Again, I&#8217;d
like to apologize for my bad English. This happened to my friend, whose name is
Dalyes. This happened a few years ago, when we were still in our 9th grade.
Dalyes attended a tae kwon do course and it wasn&#8217;t my school activity. There
was some kind of training camp day and the tae kwon do group took a trip in a
mountain countryside, which is popular in my province. He told me they were
staying in some sort of small hall several feet above ground, held by wooden
structures, there&#8217;s roof but no wall. People here called them &#8220;bale-bale&#8221;. It&#8217;s
something you can find everywhere in a rice field. And it was really near a
rice fields. You can squeeze about five people in it. At that time, everyone
was asleep because they were tired from the training. At 5 a.m or so Dalyes
woke up. He still lied on the ground however as he was still sleepy. Then he
looked at one point in the rice field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There, in the darkness of
near sunrise Dalyes saw three little girls, they were playing jump ropes. He
was confused, who could&#8217;ve played jump ropes while it&#8217;s still dark. He looked
again at the girls and he noticed they wore elementary school uniform (which
would be white shirt and red skirt, the elementary school uniform in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>). But
the attires looked weird, it was almost like the white shirt had faded away its
color. Somehow Dalyes felt like it was a scene from a long time ago. He
shivered and closed his eyes with blanket. The next morning he asked his friend
if anyone s he girls, but no one did. Dalyes then thought they may be spirits
of girls from the colonial era, when the Dutch occupied Indonesia, or at least
he felt they was alive a very long time ago (Indonesian kids rarely could go to
school at the time Dutch occupied our territory and there wasn&#8217;t such school
uniform then).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dalyes also have a
paranormal experience when we was in the 6th grade. That time our school had a
retreat program. We stayed in a place called &#8220;Civita&#8221;. It was divided to Civita
1 and Civita 2. The 6th-a class stayed in Civita 2, while the b class stayed in
Civita 1. Dalyes and me was in the b class. We stayed for 2 night. I forgot at
which night, Dalyes&#8217; friend named Fandi asked Dalyes to accompany him to the
restroom. It was late night and the boy apparently afraid to go by himself. But
Dalyes was so sleepy that he refused Fandi&#8217;s request. He asked everyone else
but no one would accompany him. So he decided not to go to the restroom and
sleep. Then, hours later Dalyes woke up and he need to go to restroom too. He
woke one of his friend up and they both went to the rest room. In the hallway
to the restroom (it was separated with the bedrooms, and located between girls
and boys bedrooms) Dalyes saw a figure in front of him. He thought it was Fandi
because the figure wore the same shirt and looked just like him. Dalyes asked
him to go to the restroom together, but no answer. He then entered one of the
bathroom or so (I forget...). Dalyes went to his restroom and after he and his
friend finished they went back to the room. He didn&#8217;t meet Fandi or anyone
else. At his room he saw Fandi and he thought Fandi already asleep after he
went to the bathroom. They slept the rest of the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the morning, Fandi yelled
at Dalyes and the other roommates because nobody would accompany him to the
restroom e other night so he had to hold not to pee. Dalyes of course confused
and said he saw Fandi went to the bathroom alone and when he greeted him he
didn&#8217;t say anything. But fandi said he went nowhere outside the room the last
night. They asked if anyone else went to the bathroom and heard Dalyes talked
to them. No one did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">And then we knew that the
place where we stayed was indeed had some ghost stories...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Good evening to all. I'm
excited to say I've had several super-<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">natural experiences. I
strongly believe in spirits. This November will be 18 years since I lost my
Mom. We were very close. Well, 11 years ago, when my son was 6 months old, I
was changing his diaper in his crib and I noticed something out of the corner
of my eye and looked up to see my Mom walking past my son's door. I was SO
happy to see her! I walked to the door but she was gone. In that same house( In
Georgia), my daughter &amp; I heard quite a few things. Foot steps up and down
the hallway, doors opening and closing and sometimes even whispers. I never
felt threatened or scared there. I work at a prison here in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region> and I
have seen 3 ghosts so far and heard ALOT of things. My daughter and I are very
interested in the supernatural. I love this web site. It is full of so much
information and interesting things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi, I want to share some
experiences that may related to &#8220;ghost&#8221; or paranormal world. But first I want
to apologize my bad English. My mother deceased at December 23, 2003. I was 13
years old and in the middle of my 9th grade. I live in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indonesia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and
my house is located in a crowded neighborhood. As in Buddhist beliefs, a
deceased person&#8217;s spirit will stay in earthly world for 49 days after the day
they died. A few days or weeks (I don&#8217;t quite remember) after my mother was cremated,
something strange happened in my house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was around or almost
midnight, I was in front of my television. After since my mother passed away I
became quiet. I live with my aunt then and I till do now. As usual my aunt was
already asleep while I still watched the tv. Then I felt thirsty and need to
have a drink. So I went to the kitchen. It is located in the back of my house,
there&#8217;s a hallway that connect the kitchen and the door to my backyard. And
there&#8217;s a huge window in my kitchen so you can see to the backyard. The
backyard itself is not big, and surrounded by wall without roof. There&#8217;s a
bathroom and toilet in my backyard. So if you want to go to the bathroom you
have to go through the hallway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyway, i was there, pouring
water to a bottle, and suddenly the door to the backyard slided open! I heard
the door&#8217;s sound and surprised a bit. Because of course, the door was shut off,
even though not locked. My aunt usually yelled at me if I ever forget to close
the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I looked to the backyard
through the big window, which is exactly beside me. No one was there. My aunt
was still fast asleep. I finished pouring the water and walked to the door. It
was almost fully opened, my two dogs was there, silent. I was confused because
no wind would open the door by itself. I mean, you have to held the doorknob to
open it. I wasn&#8217;t scared and went back to watch tv, later on I told this to
several family members and they said it could&#8217;ve been my mother&#8217;s spirit. And I
recall my mother was always went to bathroom to pee when she was alive.
Everynight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Some times after that I
heard something else in the hallway to the backyard. I was just came from the
bathroom. Oh, there&#8217;s actually no single light/lamp in my bathroom. This is an
old house and I never mind the darkness because I&#8217;m more fond of darkness than
light. There, as I was almost closed the door I heard a voice, a voice of a
well reel. I wasn&#8217;t move the door yet, and there&#8217;s thing in the house that can
possibly made such sound. And the sound was sounded like it was so close to me.
I frost for a moment and thought of what I just heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yes, there is a well outside
of my house, located in a &#8220;ghetto&#8221; area and used everyday by my neighbors. But
I swear in my whole life i never heard anything even though anyone use the
well! And I thought if there was someone there and used the well, I would have
heard the sound for a long moment, as it takes at least a minute to take a
bucket of water. But what I&#8217;ve heard was just a brief moment of sound. It
couldn&#8217;t have been really someone taking water since it was almost 1 or 2 a.m.
And there&#8217;s two layers of wall divide the well with my house wall. What sound
could it be then?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: eucikoala@comcast.net<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello. I have been a fan of
the Shadowlands for quite some time and just now have worked up the courage to
send you a few of my own personal true ghost story. So, here goes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have always had a
fascination with the supernatural, despite the fact that I get ever so paranoid
and I'm easily scared. It's a guilty pleasure, I suppose. So, because I had
exhausted my newest volume of ghost stories I had checked out from the library,
I asked my mother if any supernatural hauntings had ever gone on in our old
house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She told me that one morning
several years ago, when I was at day care, the ceiling fan in my room had
crashed to the floor without the slightest provocation. Nobody was in my
bedroom at that time and the pieces used to hold the fan to the ceiling were
all in place. Not a missing nut, bolt, or screw. There was NOTHING that could
have caused that fan to fall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Afterwards, there was always
a bit of a chill in my room. I remember complaining to my parents of how cold
it was later in life. No matter how high they turned up the thermostat, it
remained chilly within the confines of my room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another strange feature of
my room was that always, before going to sleep, I would see pictures of my
ceiling. Now, these pictures weren't just playing connect the dots on the
popcorn-like white bulges, but real, moving, animated, colorful pictures. I
distinctly remember one night when I was six, a miniature train roared across
my ceiling, complete with sound. And I was wide awake. After all, who could
sleep with such noise? I often wondered why my parents never came in to see the
source of the sound, but I always dismissed it as being<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the fact that they were already too fast
asleep to really hear anything. (I always remained awake an hour after my
parents went to sleep).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These images were often
pleasant and did not bother me at all. In fact, they had a rather soothing
presence that relaxed me enough to fall asleep. I thought nothing of them,
never telling my friends or parents. They sort of left after I entered the
fifth grade and I only had a vaguely similar experience during that year. In
fact, I had all but forgotten about them until I asked my mother on whether any
spirits had ever been in our house. Although, I certainly can't imagine why a
spirit would knock down my fan and then provide me with a sort of illusion
lullaby several years later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We moved out of that house a
year or two ago and I have not had another supernatural experience since. I
kind of miss it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was real young my
friends and I decided to go out to this house everyone said was haunted. When
we get there no one would go up to the house so I started walking on the lawn
and I heard a radio kinda like an old fashioned radio the ones you had to tune.
I looked in the window and there was this old man standing in the window. I
could see right through him and I remember he had the blackest eyes I had ever
seen. I have been a believer since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This is a true story.... I
had purchased my 1st home there, around 1974, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the back yard<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>parralleled a drainage ditch that was almost a stream.... When I first
moved in, it was always cold, even for <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">florida</st1:State></st1:place>...
so I never needed airconditioning. The winter was another thing, the
heater[electric] was in the hallway, but within 10 or 15 feet from it, it would
be ineffective, and any heat coming from it would die out , and it would be ice
cold.. It was a three bedroom house, and after the child was born, I put him in
his own bedroom... People would say that the baby was crying, and when I went
to check on him, he was always fine, sleeping happily, and undisturbed.
However, ,I heard many nights of a child crying, and 2 years later, after I had
moved out, My mother, by accident, met the next door neighbor that lived next
door before I moved in. She started talking about how the people before me had
moved out at 2 in the morning , and altho they had 2 kids, she only saw them
leave with one . My idea is that they had killed the baby, buried it in the
drainage ditch, and left before they were ever in trouble over it. Altho the
"hauntings" went on for over 2 yrs, it all stopped when I had a
minister come by to baptise my child. He must have felt the prescense of bad
vibes, because, altho he said to wait until my son was old enough to choose to
be baptised, he did say a prayer with me and my wife and blessed the house, and
anyone, and everyone who ever lived there... It never happened again, and Im
sure that the sopirits were released and freed<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and are now at peace. True story, and I have witnesses that I had
allowed to live with me until they found a place to live in.. yours , honestly<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in alabama.me and my sis had to share a room,and we had bunkbeds and she slept
on the top bunk and i slept on the bottom bunk. it was a summer night kinda hot
so my mom opened the window which was right by me but u couldnt see out it was
pitch black.well i was trying to get to sleep and as i try to sleep i always
open my eyes every once in a while.when i opened my eyes and looked at the
screen on my window it was pushing in,well i thought it was just the wind so i
ignored it and tryed to go to sleep then i heard it kinda crack.i could see a
dent in the screen so i took my hand and pushed the screen and i felt someone
or somethings head or something soft and this scared the crap out of me and i
ran to my mom and dads room and jumped in bed with my mom i think my dad was
out of town working and he always left a gun for my mom b/c we were so far out

put a Story on here This is My Story, but now I write to you My dads story. It
was a few days after we buried my oldest brother and since my brother had
passed, my dad hadn't had sleep in 5 days and he was on his way home from work
one night and he was drowsy and he was on the highway and all over the road and
had dozed off and my brother was his copiolet that night. My dad said he heard
my brother holler his name and he woke up like with in seconds later a 18
wheeler had went by his going fast if it wasn't for my brother my dad wouldn't
be with us today. This started on March 15th of 2005 10 years later. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>My dad was at work as usual and something told
him to turn around well when he did my oldest brother that passed away 10 years
ago was right there infront of him to let him know that someone in our family
was going to pass away and then he disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well on saturday the 18th all the family was called to the nursing home
where my grandad was when he was suffering from altemziers. He passed around
3:50pm my other brother and his wife was outside and my sister, my brother in
law, and myself were int the room when he passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother and sister inlaw said around
3:50pm that the wind outside the nursing home had picked up and the wind chimes
were going crazy blowing and they knew that our grandad had passed away. Well
for now that is all until something else happens that is dealing with
spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know that my granddad is in
heaven with my grandmother that i never knew and my oldest brother as well.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Between me and my family we
have had many encounters of diffrent sorts but I'll start with my story:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about 4 years ago and I was pregnate
with my first son Riley it was a very tough pregnacy for me because I had mano
on top of all the other pregnacy simptoms so i was at home alone alot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My now ex husband and I had a nice apartment
that had a lower half to it that was turned into a bar and we would sit down
there sometimes while we were doing our laundry and such or having people over
and we would hear music from up stairs we would run up stairs and then it would
sound like the music would come from down<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>stairs it always freaked us out. Then one time we had some people over
and the guys had gone to get pizza my nephew was upstairs playing a video game
and the girls were all sitting down stairs and we heard this strange eerie
laugh that sounded like it had come from the closet so i ran up stairs to see
if it had been chris and he had no idea what i was talking about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time i was all alone and all of a
sudden the railing to the downstairs started to shake back and forth really
violently it was very spooky. Doors would always be open and we always shut
them the shower curtin would always be open and we would always shut it one
time it opened when i was in the shower.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The scarest thing to me was though the whole time we lived there for
some reason i had called the ghost Huey and I had found out from a friend that
the old man that had built the bar had drank himself to death down there and
his name was Louey wierd coincidence that the names were so close I don't know
but scary none the less.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fascinated by the Paranormal<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've always been fascinated
by the paranormal. Now that I think about all the stories my parents have told
me and my own personal experience, I know my childhood home was haunted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was little, my family
and I lived in a big beautiful house in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indianapolis</st1:place></st1:City>.
However, strange things kept happening which couldn't be explained even when
seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My parents had a wonderful
bedroom with a big bathroom. As soon as they fell asleep, though, the water
faucets would turn on and the toilet would flush. Every time my mother would
get up to turn it off, the same thing happened as soon as she went back to
sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The outside water faucet
would turn on full blast periodically. One of my parents would go out to turn
it off. This would happen day or night. My parents would start walking away and
the handle would spin again, turning it on. My parents weren't more than 5 feet
away from it. They checked around to see if there was anyone messing with it.
They could never find anyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We had the water pipes and
such checked and all the plumbers said the same thing; everything was perfect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Something stranger happened
to me. Whenever I think about it, I get sick to my stomach. I would always have
to take a nap around four o'clock. One day I couldn't sleep because there was
an older woman standing next to my bed. I asked what she wanted as I climbed
out of my bed. She didn't say much then, but pulled out a long rope from her
purse. As soon as she pulled the rope out, she began to teach me how to tie a
neuse. I watched silently, trying to be respectful to an elder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I didn't really think much
of it because we lived around a lot of older people. My mother heard me quietly
talking and came up to check on me since I was suppose to be asleep. She didn't
see anyone, nor did she hear it. She asked me what I was doing and I said I was
simply playing with the old woman. My mother looked at me as if I was crazy and
looked around the room to double-check to see if anyone was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I don't really know if
anything happened at that house before we lived there, but I know what I
experienced and I know what went on there and I have no doubt that that house
was haunted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had to put to sleep my
male black lab 9/24/00 (Boss) .. he was my best friend and very protected of my
grandson since birth. My grandson has always live with me and I am raising him.
Every time my grandson cried, Boss would check on him and then come get me.
After his death (Boss), my grandson woke up crying and I was holding him to
calm him down and within a few moments I felt something under my foot that was
hanging over the side of the bed. I felt Boss's presents and looked and nothing
was there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had a black female
(Sabrina), 1 year apart from Boss and finally got another dog, a chocolate male
2/04 (Hunter). I had to put Sabrina to sleep<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>2/4/05 due to a brain tumor. When I told my grandson of her death he started
crying and went to sit in his chair. He wanted to call his mother to talk to
her. Hunter went over to him and laid beside him they way he lays. I went to
get the phone and when I got back Hunter was laying in the position as Boss
laid. When I seen it, I thought to myself, Boss is here telling me that
Sabrina, was with him and OK. Then Hunter went right into the way he always
sits. Hunter has not laid in that position before Sabrina's death and did it a
couples of times more when he seen me crying for Sabrina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ever since Sabrina's death I
have been calling Hunter, Boss and I never did that before. I have been seeing
Hunter doing things now that Boss did every now and then and Hunter never did
it before Sabrina's death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">You may think I am crazy,
sometimes I think I am going crazy, but I really feel something and truly
believe Boss came back to let me know that Sabrina is OK and with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Back many years ago when I
was a young boy, This happen to me. I was on my way to school and decided to
play hooky from school. I knew this guy who worked at an oil company in
tilton/northfield that is the name of the town I lived in. Anyhoo I asked if I
could stay at his place to skip school which he said I could. So he went to
work and I stayed and started to watch the tv . I had only been there for afew
minutes when I heard pots and pans banging around out in the kitchen. I thought
my friend decided to stay home and hang out with me. I got up off the couch and
went into the kitchen to see if he needed any help. when I got in to the
kitchen there was no body there. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. I
went back out to livingroom and started to watch tv again I was a little scared
from the pots and pans banging around. This was winter time and the heat was
on. So I heared some walking around out in the kitchen and I went back into
kitchen again. This time the kitchen window was open and I thought for sure
that It was closed, so I closed the window and went back to watch tv. I just
sat down when a loud bang came from the kitchen I jumped up off the couch ran
into the kitchen to see if I could catch who was in there. This time<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the window was back open and the kitchen was
all messed up. Needless say I was only late for school that day. I do'nt know
what happend in that old house and I never will,but I never went back in there
and my friend never said anything about the kitchen being messed up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nursing Home Haunts<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ok so everyone would think
that a nursing home is haunted. Well of course, this is where people come to
die. So of course it was no big surprise to me to start feeling that people
were around when there was physically no one else there. I always love being by
our main dining room because there are two elevators right there for the
residents and almost everytime I walk by when I'm by myself the elevator door
on the right opens by itself. The button hasn't been pushed or anything and
it's usually near the end of my shift which is after dinner when everyone has
gone back to their rooms. If you walk into the elevator there is this scent
that you don't smell any other time and it's only this elevator. It's the smell
of soap and powder sort of like after you just get out of the shower. I don't
know who this mystery ghost is but I always smile when I walk into the elevator
and smell that scent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Also I work in the kitchen
of the nursing home and there is a hallway that has some of our coolers there
and if you follow it back you will come to the furnace rooms. I've been told
that when the nursing home first opened the furnace room was used as a
temporary morgue until the funeral homes or families came to pick up the
bodies. I haven't been able to go back and explore that area yet but I know
there are spirits back th e. Whenever I am mopping up floors at the end of the
night and I go back that way I can feel them. I can't wait to explore these
areas more when I have lots of free time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I'm 20 years old and i have
lived in my house in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>
since the day i came home from the hospital and my family lived here 5 years
prior from just after my brother turned 1.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The house itself was a new
build, part of a small estate built around a church called the Clare College
Mission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As I grew up my dad would
always tell me ghost stories, but i always assumed they were just aimed at
scaring me, he would tell me that in the room that me and my brother used to
share they used to find us sitting up in our cots laughing at the ceiling, and
door handles moved by themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Over the past 8 or 9 years i
slowly came to believe these stories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My brother started<span style="">&nbsp; </span>sitting up in his crib and talking to the
ceiling when he was just a few months from 2, in the months previously my
grandfather passed away and only after did it start. We strongly believe that
he was talking to my grandfather as two weeks after he passed my nana was
staying with us in the same room, she awoke in the middle of the night to find
my grandad walking around the room dressed in his navy uniform. When she called
out to him to mind the cabinet he smiled at her and faded away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">theres also an overwhelming
feeling in the room, which i don't know quite how to lable. It sometimes feels
hostile but it only seems to be under darkness and other times it's a perfectly
harmless atmosphere. A Particular friend of mine, refuses to go in the room due
to a feeling of breathlessness that she gets as she enters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mum was lying in bed a
few months ago, she works as a teaching assistant and was on a school break so
layed in after everyone else left the house. she told me that she'd laid with
one leg uncovered and was woken by the feeling of a finger being trailed up and
down her calf but when she opened her eyes the room was empty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The hall way of the house
has a continuously hostile feeling to it, and it feels as though i am
constantly being watched from both the top floor and the bottom and when i walk
up the stairs i walk flat to the wall glancing backwards and forwards in both
directions and i find myself unable to look into 'that' room as i walk passed
and sometimes feel compeled to close the door to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the occurances do seem to
travel around the house. when I was 10 I bought a brand new stationary set for
school, and when family vistited i placed it underneath my bed but when i went
back it was gone and we never have found it. A school locker key went missing
for years only to turn up in a drawer that had been gone through many times
almost a year after i finished my final exams. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I came back from a
holiday last year I bought a shell back and placed it on the mantel in the dead
centre, my mum went in to the room one day to find it half way across the
mantel and no one has admitted to moving it, although after i told a friend she
thought it would be funny to move it and not tell us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Also in 2002 my other nan
passed away from cancer, and this christmas my grandad went to dinner at my
uncles, their eldest sons house. While they were there my uncle wanted to play
a cd that had my nans favourite christmas song on it but after searching for it
in the living room he couldn't find it. He went back into the kitchen with the
rest of the family but after a few minutes they heard music playing in the
living room. they found that it was coming from an old cd player that had been
disconnected months ealier and playing my nans favourite christmas song.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I lived in an apartment near
the university in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kirksville</st1:place></st1:City>
in the summer during the late 1970's with my roomate. Every night at around
1:00 to 2:00 I would hear footsteps coming from the second floor. They never
varied much, and the ghost could be heard<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>walking from one end of the apartment to the other. This went on the
whole time we lived there, and the second floor was not rented out that summer.
My roomate and I talked about it, and we even went upstairs one time, and the
apartment had a long hallway with rooms at either end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I know of at least two other
stories from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kirksville</st1:place></st1:City>,
one involving a dorm on campus and the other a cemetery and the recording of
evps that a friend of mine and I recorded as part of a parapyschology class at
the university. Sometimes I still dream about the evps we taped that night.
They were very errie and strange. I can still hear the voices in my mind after
more than 20 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
