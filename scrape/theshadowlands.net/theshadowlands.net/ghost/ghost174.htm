<p><b>College Days</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: butch@conwaycorp.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I thought I would relate some experiences I had in 1985 during my
college years.</b>
<br><b>My best friend from high school and I rented an old house from his
grandmother. I was told before moving in about some strange happenings
that sometimes took place in the house, but knowing my friend and his dead-pan
sense of humor, I shrugged it off.</b>
<br><b>In a 6 month period, we had a LOT of unexplained things take place.</b>
<br><b>The first was with a window air conditioning unit. It was completely
manual control. Not one with a thermostat, but one you had to turn a dial
to turn on and off. We were sitting in the living room about a week after
I moved in when the unit stopped. We looked at it and realized that the
dial had been turned to the off posistion. We were the only ones in the
room and both of us were at least 10 feet away from the air conditioner.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks later, I was in the house alone, and went to the kitchen
to wash dishes. If you have ever been in an old house with wooden floors
and someone else was in another part of the house, you know how you can
hear and feel foot steps when someone is walking around? Well, while I
was standing at the sink, I heard someone walking around in the room just
beside the kitchen. When I looked in the room, no one was there.</b>
<br><b>Another incident occured when my friend and I were coming home from
a movie one night, and noticed the front porch light was on, and the door
was cracked open about an inch. When we got out of my car, the door suddenly
shut and porch light went off. We thought someone was in the house, so
we ran to the door and tried to open it. It was locked. After we unlocked
the door, we searched the whole house. The only other way out of the house
was the back door in the kitchen. When we got there, it was locked with
a chain lock from the inside. No one could have left that way and locked
it.</b>
<br><b>Besides those incidents, I can't count how many bangs and sounds
of things falling to the floor we heard only to investigate and see that
nothing on the floor or disturbed in anyway.</b>
<br><b>I never felt threatened, but it was kinda spooky at times.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Childhood Memories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lucy</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just got done reading some of the stories on your website and boy
am I goosepimply!&nbsp; I know I will not sleep tonight because I will
be too busy going over the memories of my own experience with the supernatural.&nbsp;
Here's my story and please believe me&nbsp; it is all true.&nbsp; My parents
were poor Mexican farm workers who had 6 children altogether.&nbsp; From
the year 1965 to 1969 we traveled around looking for fruit to pick, traveling
in a circle from Bakersfield up as far as Washington, living where we could
and surviving on very little money.&nbsp; My older brother and sister would
go out to work with my parents in the summer and I would be left behind
to babysit my little brother and 2 little sisters.&nbsp; One year we traveled
to Bingen, Washington for the strawberry harvest.&nbsp; I was about 9 years
old at the time.&nbsp; Being accustomed to living in one room cabins and
the like, I can remember being pleasantly surprised when my parents moved
us into a very nice little house for the summer.&nbsp; It was white, had
a big picture window in the front, three bedrooms, and a full kitchen.&nbsp;
I remember it overlooked a river, a well known river but I can’t remember
now which river it was, and there was a creek which ran along the back
of the house and past a couple of the bedrooms.&nbsp; My sisters and I
shared one bedroom along teh creek and hte other one was so cold no one
could sleep in it so it was left empty except for a big armoire which was
the only piece of furniture in the room.&nbsp; I would often hear footsteps
running along the creek and past the bedroom at night.&nbsp; There were
two beds in our bedroom.&nbsp; One was shared by two of my sisters and
I slept in the other with my baby sister.&nbsp; One night, my other sisters
had fallen asleep.&nbsp; Baby sis and I lay in bed talking softly with
each other as we often did before we drifted off to sleep when we both
suddenly stopped talking.&nbsp; I was filled with a feeling of dread and
eeriness which my sister says she felt too (she hates to talk about it
even to this day but we sometimes do just to verify it really happened).&nbsp;
We felt something come into the dark bedroom.&nbsp; We could not see it
as we had pulled the blankets up tight over our heads.&nbsp; My mouth went
dry and my throat closed up so I couldn't scream.&nbsp; This young woman
(and I don’t know how I know it was a young woman) came in and sat on our
bed.&nbsp; We can both remember the bed compressing or leaning down on
the bottom end on the side where my sister lay.&nbsp; It sat there for
a bit then got up silently and left.&nbsp; Another time, I was babysitting
during the day and had deposited my brother and little sisters in the bathtub
and was standing in the living room looking out the window.&nbsp; In the
picture window there were three decorative bottles filled with colored
water.&nbsp; I picked up the one in the middle (it had green water in it)
and shook it and watched the sediment float down to the bottom of the bottle.&nbsp;
As I stood there holding the bottle, I felt something come up behind me.&nbsp;
It made the hair on teh back of my neck prickle like it was blowing on
my neck or something -- I dropped the bottle which shattered and broke.&nbsp;
I will try my best to describe what happened next.&nbsp; At the precise
moment I dropped the bottle, my little brother and sisters started singing
this little song -- I ran terrified into the bathroom only to see them
-- and all three of them -- sitting in the tub -- they were making sawing
motions on their little necks, chanting.&nbsp; They chanted "kotchie kotchie
kotch kotch", then wagged their little heads from one side to another while
making boo hoo noises and rubbing imaginary tears from their eyes with
their balled up fists.&nbsp; I screamed at them to stop it and asked them
where they had heard the song and they said they had just made it up and
were playing a game.&nbsp; It scared the hell out of me.&nbsp; All three
of them distinctly remember this happening.&nbsp; Incidentally, the Spanish
name for knife is "cuchillo" which is very close to what they were saying.&nbsp;
There were other things that happened in that house too, but this message
is already too long.</b>
<br><b>I recounted everything to my parents but they just laughed and said
I had an overactive imagination.&nbsp; I sure wish I knew where the house
was located so I could look into the history of the house but every time
I try to bring it up to my mother, she makes me feel ridiculous for asking
and clams up tight.</b>
<br><b>The years went by and my parents finally settled down and stopped
migrating but I was plagued with night terrors after living in that house.&nbsp;
I would be afraid to go to sleep at night for fear I would have nightmares.&nbsp;
They abruptly stopped when I moved out of my parents house and went off
to live on my own.</b><b></b>

<p><b>CHATANOOGA TN.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: countryresurrection@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Im somewhat reluctant to tell this and dont know the name of the
hotel. It is the only historic first class hotel in chatanooga so will
be easy to find.</b>
<br><b>I was staying in a suite on the 12th floor and was in the hotel
bar. I asked the bartended to tell me the most interesting piece of history
about the hotel.</b>
<br><b>He said if youll notice on the outside one room has bars over the
window.</b>
<br><b>I got a cold chill.</b>
<br><b>He continued that room 311 (as I recall) is haunted. That&nbsp;
a mans mistress was murdered there.</b>
<br><b>I asked him if it was occupied and he said no. He again pointed
out that it had bars on the window and really couldnt explain why.</b>
<br><b>I asked if I might get a key just to go in there at midnight. (why
midnight was just straight out of the movies)</b>
<br><b>At 11:55 pm I went to the third floor and to the door of the room.
I slipped in the plastic "key" and opened the door. I proceeded slowly
and had the most intence feeling of an evil presence I have ever felt in
my life. While looking straight ahead I reached behind me and flipped the
light switch...nothing happened. (keep in mind this is a luxury hotel)
I took two more slow steps and there was single bed straight ahead with
the covers twisted in a knot. A luggage holder was laying on its side.
In an anjacent room there was an evil spirit, evil beyond comprehension,
waiting for me. I stopped and backed out and closed the door.</b>
<br><b>When I returned to my room I phoned the front desk and and thanked
them for the key. I told them the room was trashed and that I certainly
had no part in that. There was a long silence. They had sent a cleaning
crew up at 10pm to insure its order for me to go in at midnight.</b>
<br><b>I was dumbfounded.</b>
<br><b>This is a true story I promise and gives me a chill yet to recount.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Cemetery</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bourget@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was told by my kids that I could not scare them, so I decided I
was going to take them to the cemetery at night and light candles and just
sit there,. Well I had heard a story of how haunted this grave yard was
but never believed it. well&nbsp; while I was telling them about a&nbsp;
guy who is buried in that grave yard the candles started to do some strange
things. We had two candles side by side one candle was almost being blown
out and the other was not even flickering. This I pointed out to my brave
kids and even though it was strange I still did not believe at this time
the place was haunted.. So I kept on with the story about Tony. the farther
into the story I got the more the one candle was going nuts. We finally
had to relight the one while the other was still not moving. So on with
the story of Tony I went, now we started hearing things in the back ground
of the grave yard like some thing moving around even though we knew we
were alone. I thought this was the perfect time to pull my cute little
scare tactic. I was going to go behind a tree and act like some one pulled
me back. ( So I thought ). When I did get up to go next to the tree some
one did grab my shoulder, When I looked back there was no human being there
, that I could see. That was it Mom was the one scared now. I left the
yard never to return at night. Later a few friends told me they left tapes
when they were kids there in the same yard I was at and they said they
heard whispers on the tape the next day when they went and got it.&nbsp;
Several people since that night&nbsp; said they have had experiences there
in that yard. no one goes in there at night any more except for unbelievers
and they all leave believing.</b>

the cemetary</b>
<br><b>with my girlfriend and my friend, Jeff.&nbsp; The bargain was 5$
an hour.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>figured it was easy money, so we agreed.&nbsp; Late one night we
went in.&nbsp; We were</b>
<br><b>walking around and we rested at a grave.&nbsp; Then we decided to
rest elsewhere.</b>
<br><b>When we came back to the first grave we were at, a red rose was
there.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was fresh.&nbsp; That was the first time we freaked.&nbsp; Then
we began hearing</b>
<br><b>laughter, ! like a child.&nbsp; Little footprints appeared where
we were standing</b>
<br><b>moments ago.&nbsp; We freaked.&nbsp; In the end, we stayed for 45

<br><b>The Can Cellar Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Morgan</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I think my Grandmother's old house was haunted. But since she moved
out</b>
<br><b>of it while I was nine, I never got any positive evidence. It was
huge.</b>
<br><b>(her house) It had the whole 9-yards; 2 white pillars in the front,
a</b>
<br><b>foyer, a long dining room with authentic crystal chandelier, a sun
room,</b>
<br><b>4 bedrooms... everything. It also had a large, multi-room attic,
a 3</b>
<br><b>room basement, a can cellar, and a wine cellar. I was fine with
the</b>
<br><b>attic- even at night. But I could NOT go into that basement. A lot
of</b>
<br><b>people have told me that I was just a kid and no kids like going
to</b>
<br><b>basements because they're dark. Not this one. It had windows everywhere.</b>
<br><b>There was more light down there than in the sunroom. Probably because
it</b>
<br><b>was so big. Anyway, I'd never heard of, let alone been into, the
wine</b>
<br><b>celler because when my mom was little they cleaned it out and boarded
it</b>
<br><b>up. (it was right under the stairs) One afternoon, (when I was 7
I</b>
<br><b>think) I was walking down the stairs. To my right was the can cellar,</b>
<br><b>and to my left were the other 2 rooms. I heard the washing machine
going</b>
<br><b>and figured my mom was down here helping out All of a sudden I heard</b>
<br><b>glass shatter. It sounded like it had come from under me, but I
"knew"</b>
<br><b>that couldn't happen. So I ran into the other room</b>
<br><b>to see if my mom was hurt, and there was no one there. The washing</b>
<br><b>machine had never been running because the lid was open. I checked
the</b>
<br><b>drier, and there was nothing in there either. I was really scared
at</b>
<br><b>this point. I stil had to go to the can cellar to get peaches for
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother. I will NEVER forget what happened next. I HATED the
can</b>
<br><b>celler with all my heart. It just didn't feel right in there. I
passed</b>
<br><b>the stairs and my grandfather's old desk and chair. All of a sudden
the</b>
<br><b>chair spun. Well, I RAN to that can cellar so fast my feet couldn't</b>
<br><b>carry me. The can cellar was L shaped, and it had a small 40 watt
bulb</b>
<br><b>w/ chain hanging from the celing. The peaches were in the WAY back,</b>
<br><b>and needless to say, 40 watts didn't cut it.</b>
<br><b>Since the light was in the middle of the room, You had to enter
in</b>
<br><b>darkness. Well Since I was running, and there was no door, but a
very</b>
<br><b>high step, I&nbsp; tripped and fell into the cellar. All of a sudden
the air</b>
<br><b>changed. It got really cold and really dense. Which I could understand</b>
<br><b>if the room had a door, but like I mentioned, it didn't. I heard
a faint</b>
<br><b>laughing, and I looked up. There was this dark cloud that was almost
the</b>
<br><b>shape of an over-easy egg; kind of undefined with a REALLY dark
spot in</b>
<br><b>the middle. I screamed, grabbed the first can I saw, and bolted
out of</b>
<br><b>there. They have since torn the house down, and I'm glad, because</b>
<br><b>whatever was there didn't want to have company.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Shrine at Auriesville</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Avelinodom@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>About 30 years ago, my sister-in-law and I visited the Shrine at
Auriesville,</b>
<br><b>New York in the Mohawk Valley.&nbsp; It's a Catholic shrine dedicated
to St. Isaac</b>
<br><b>Jogues and his followers who were martyred there by the Mohawk indians.</b>
<br><b>We were walking around enjoying a beautiful crisp winter day when
we saw a</b>
<br><b>nun in the old fashioned nun's habit the reached the ankles playfully
holding</b>
<br><b>on to a very thin tree and swinging around it.&nbsp; She never showed
up on the</b>
<br><b>other side.&nbsp; We were both looking at it and were flabbergasted.&nbsp;
We shook our</b>
<br><b>heads and said, "Naaahhh".</b>
<br><b>So then we went into the huge circular church.&nbsp; We were in
there about 5</b>
<br><b>minutes when a nun came walking down the aisle.&nbsp; She headed
toward the altar.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We were busy looking at the ceiling and the carvings when
my sister-in-law</b>
<br><b>said, "O.K.&nbsp; Where's the nun?!!?"&nbsp; We had turned away
for not even 15 seconds</b>
<br><b>and she was gone.&nbsp; If you ever were in the church at Auriesville
you would</b>
<br><b>know that because it's built in a circle you can't hide and to reach
an exit</b>
<br><b>would take more than 15 seconds because it's so big.</b>
<br><b>Years later my husband and brother were walking around the grounds
and down</b>
<br><b>in a ravine is a dying figure of Christ laid out on a slab.&nbsp;
They saw a woman</b>
<br><b>with long black hair praying over it.&nbsp; The blinked their eyes
and she was</b>
<br><b>gone.</b>
<br><b>So to make a long story short . . . Auriesville, the scene of much
tragedy is</b>
<br><b>probably overrun with spirits.&nbsp; The entire place is dedicated
to death.&nbsp; And</b>
<br><b>it's about 50 or more acres of sorrowful statues and scenes in the
museum of</b>
<br><b>the saints having their fingers chewed off by indians.&nbsp; I'll
never go back.</b>
<br><b>I prefer my religion to be happy and good.</b>
<br><b>It's very easy to find if you would like to investigate.&nbsp; It's
right on the</b>
<br><b>Mohawk River between Amsterdam and Fultonville.</b>

<p><b>An Odd Conversation</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lison@socal.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The year was 1985, and I was 15 years old.&nbsp; My father had sent
me to</b>
<br><b>Northern Germany to an old farmhouse that belonged to a childhood
friend of</b>
<br><b>his.&nbsp; The primary objective was for me to learn to speak some
German.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>farmhouse was built in approximately the 1780's.&nbsp; Built of
giant timbers and</b>
<br><b>pieced together in a fascinating method that used no nails or brackets,
I</b>
<br><b>was immediately fascinated by the entire structure and I took it
upon myself</b>
<br><b>to begin exploring every square inch of it.&nbsp; After spending
several days</b>
<br><b>exploring all of the rooms from the inside as well as studying the
structure</b>
<br><b>from the outside, I discovered that an entire portion of the house
was</b>
<br><b>actually, "missing."&nbsp; Not missing, of course, but rather, "sealed
off."&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>became fascinated by this and spent hours combing all of the walls
adjoining</b>
<br><b>the sealed off area attempting to determine where hallways or doors
were</b>
<br><b>most likely sealed off.&nbsp; Due to the odd layout of the floorplan,
I wasn't</b>
<br><b>able to precisely figure out where sections had been sealed off.&nbsp;
In</b>
<br><b>frustration, I sat down on an old trunk located on the third floor
(which</b>
<br><b>was a semi attic converted to a bedroom.)&nbsp; As I sat quietly
pondering why</b>
<br><b>someone would seal off a section of the house, I began to hear voices.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>wasn't frightened.&nbsp; The voices were of two men having what
sounded like a</b>
<br><b>normal conversation, and they very well could have been coming from
just the</b>
<br><b>next room...&nbsp; They were speaking in German so I actually didn't
understand</b>
<br><b>much of it.&nbsp; I sat and listened to the conversation for what
seemed like 2</b>
<br><b>or 3 minutes.&nbsp; Oddly, I simply accepted that the voices were
those of the</b>
<br><b>workmen who had been repairing sections of the roof for the past
few days.</b>
<br><b>I had seem them working up there, and I subconsciously accepted
the</b>
<br><b>conversation to be the workers.&nbsp; Eventually, I walked back
down the stairs</b>
<br><b>and met my father's friends in the Kitchen.&nbsp; I casually asked
when the</b>
<br><b>workmen would be finished with the roof.&nbsp; The Mrs. replied
that the workers</b>
<br><b>had already completed yesterday and the workers were already gone.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>struck me as odd, although I didn't mention what I had heard.&nbsp;
I then</b>
<br><b>presented my theory to her about how I thought a section of the
house was</b>
<br><b>sealed off.&nbsp; She grew very quiet and gazed upon me for a few
uncomfortable</b>
<br><b>moments.&nbsp; From what I understood, she explained that a section
of the house</b>
<br><b>was used to hide Jewish families during WWII and that was why it
was hidden</b>
<br><b>so well.&nbsp; After the war, no one ever bothered to take the walls
back down.</b>
<br><b>She, herself, had never even been in that part of the house.&nbsp;
She also</b>
<br><b>claimed that she didn't even know where the secret entrance was.&nbsp;
Now the</b>
<br><b>hairs on the back of my neck were bristling.&nbsp; I still didn't
say anything</b>
<br><b>about the voices.&nbsp; A few hours later, one of the daughter's
came home from</b>
<br><b>work, and I asked her if she ever had any weird experiences around
the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; She was all to eager to tell me that she had oftentimes
heard voices</b>
<br><b>in the middle of the night, and she said that she once even saw
a man</b>
<br><b>standing in the corner of the attic on the third floor.&nbsp; She
admitted that</b>
<br><b>she hated it up there and she tried to avoid going up there.&nbsp;
At that point,</b>
<br><b>I admitted my experience and she didn't appear that surprised except
for the</b>
<br><b>fact that I claimed the voices were so clear.&nbsp; The voices she
heard were</b>
<br><b>always muffled and indistinguishable, however the conversation I
hear was</b>
<br><b>loud and clear!&nbsp; If only I had spoken better German, I could
possibly have</b>
<br><b>know what they were talking about!&nbsp; I have visited that old
farmhouse at</b>
<br><b>least 5 times since 1985 and I have since married one of the daughters,
but</b>
<br><b>I have never heard or seen anything odd in the house since that
first visit.</b>

<p><b>By: gentlegiant@sathackers.freeserve.co.uk</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I had an experience about 10 years ago which has left me baffled,</b>
<br><b>and my friends thinking im derranged.</b>
<br><b>I live in rural Northamptonshire in the UK and have a real sad hobby.</b>
<br><b>I'm into Victorian railway architecture. The area I live in is a
haven</b>
<br><b>for people with such an interest as it was the hub of a once vast
rail</b>
<br><b>network. This is all now dissused and abandoned but the main engineering</b>
<br><b>features still abound, and I spend many hours taking photographs.</b>
<br><b>The incedent took place, as I said about 10 years ago. I was in
a very</b>
<br><b>remote rural area with only a tiny village within proximity, and
I was</b>
<br><b>walking an old trackbed photographing bridges and other features,
but</b>
<br><b>I was constantly being thwarted by the presence of a lady out walking
her</b>
<br><b>dog, a border collie. Not to be outdone I decided to continue my
photo</b>
<br><b>shoot and tried to keep them both either well into the distance,
or as</b>
<br><b>far out of camera as possible, despite my efforts however she, or
the dog</b>
<br><b>seemed to get into every shot. She eventually left with her dog
and I then</b>
<br><b>continued uninterrupted for about another hour or so, untill the
light began</b>
<br><b>to fade, and I decided to call it a day, having shot three rolls
of film.</b>
<br><b>I began my long walk back to the car and started my journey home.
This is</b>
<br><b>where things take a twist. As I turned a corner in my car I was
suddenly forced to</b>
<br><b>stop due to a dog lying injured in the road, having apparently being
hit by a</b>
<br><b>car. As I got out of my car and approached the dog I recognised
it as being the</b>
<br><b>dog belonging to the lady im most of my pictures. The dog was badly
injured and</b>
<br><b>any attempt to touch it would have resulted in a serious bite, so
I could'nt</b>
<br><b>move it from the road to a safer place, so I decided to wait to
see if someone</b>
<br><b>came along who could go into the village for help. Eventualy a young
guy</b>
<br><b>came by on a cycle and said he knew the owner and would go for help.
I sat on the</b>
<br><b>hood of my car and lit a cigarette, and waited. Then the dog raised
its head and</b>
<br><b>looked at me and said In the most frightening thing I have ever
witnessed "Help Me". I</b>
<br><b>still cannot totally accept that this thing really took place. Anyway,
to cut it</b>
<br><b>short the dog had to be destroyed as it had severe head and spinal
injuries. Two</b>
<br><b>days later when I collected my films from the lab, two complete
rolls of film</b>
<br><b>were completely blank, just total black kness. These were the rolls
of film shot</b>
<br><b>with the woman and the dog in, the third roll of film had no problem
at all and</b>
<br><b>provided some really nice shots. It later transpired that the woman
had died</b>
<br><b>some 18 months prior to the incedent and the dog was in fact being
looked</b>
<br><b>after by her sister, who was unaware that the dog had got loose
and was wandering</b>
<br><b>the area where his former owner used to walk him. Does any of this
make sense to you,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;because it sure makes no sense to me.Kindest regards</b><b></b>

<br><b>Albino Lady of Rochester Cemetary</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ssgoku98@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am 21 years old and I have been interested in
the paranormal for a relatively short time.&nbsp; Well, my friends and
I were talking about the subject the other day and the Albino Lady came
up.&nbsp; So we decided to go to Rochester Cemetary and try to catch a
glimpse, or get some positive proof of the existence of the Albino Lady.&nbsp;
She has been a legend around Topeka that I have heard about ever since
I moved here in March of 1993.&nbsp; So this is what we all together have
heard.&nbsp; The Albino Lady supposedly was raped and killed in that cemetary.&nbsp;
Whenever a group of guys and a girl go in, she comes out to watch after
the girl.&nbsp; Now, I must say that I have been there quite a few times,
and at first we never saw her.&nbsp; I'm guessing it was because it was
usually me and my guy friends going out there.&nbsp; But, recently we started
going out there with girls in the group.&nbsp; The results have been better
when there have been fewer people.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time we went with a girl, it was myself
and two of my friends; one male, one female.&nbsp; We were there for about
twenty minutes or so before we saw, or heard what we think is our first
sign of the Albino Lady.&nbsp; We walked around the right perimeter of
the cemetary first, because there was a full moon, and that area was clear
and well lit.&nbsp; When we stopped walking for a bit, both me and my male
friend got a sharp chill in total unison.&nbsp; So we decided to move.&nbsp;
We moved right into the heart of Rochester.&nbsp; We stood right in the
middle, being wary of the surrounding graves,&nbsp;&nbsp; For about another
ten minutes, we stood there, and nothing.&nbsp; So I said "Why don't we
move over there?" and we proceided to do so.&nbsp; We hadn't taken our
first step, when we all heard the most bone chilling scream any of us have
ever heard.&nbsp; And this was no I'm scared, there's a wolf after me scream.&nbsp;
It was nasty.&nbsp; I would compare it more to a very angry animal, but
I have never in my life heard any animal make that noise.&nbsp; We then
started walking very briskly towards the car.&nbsp; If you had heard it,
you would understand.&nbsp; It was scary.&nbsp; It kind of gained strength,
like it took a second or so to get to full volume and octave level.&nbsp;
As we were briskly walking back, we felt as if something was following
us, and the scream started up again.&nbsp; We then ran back to the car.&nbsp;
We left there for the evening.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next time was very uneventful.&nbsp; There
were too many people.&nbsp; It wasn't organized or well planned at all.&nbsp;
We also got busted by the cops and had to get out about ten minutes after
we got there.&nbsp; So we cut our losses, and went home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last time we were there, which was four nights
ago, everyone that went with us saw her.&nbsp; I'm kicking myself for not
bringing a camera, but I won't make the same mistake twice.&nbsp; So we
got there and did dthe exact same thing as we did the first time.&nbsp;
Right perimeter, wait a while, everything the same.&nbsp; This time it
was the same female friend from the first time and two of my male friends.&nbsp;
We waited, as I said, in the clearing for a bit, then just as the first
time, moved up into the middle.&nbsp; We waited there for a while and still
saw nothing.&nbsp; I then said that I wanted to go back to the back of
the place because out of all the times I had been there, I never went all
the way back.&nbsp; So we started walking back, and got about 50 feet from
the left perimeter wood line and we saw some movement of some sort, still
undecided on, but we started to freak out and run away.&nbsp; But I stopped
and decided that I was not leaving until I had fully proven to myself that
she is real.&nbsp; And let me tell you, I DID.&nbsp; We started walking
back to the rear again, and the girl with us saw her and started going
over by her.&nbsp; I didn't see her at this time, but she was back in the
trees to the left where we had seen the movement.&nbsp; We got about 20feet
away from the wood line and we could tell there was something white moveing
in the woods.&nbsp; It wasn't glowing or anything, it was simply reflecting
the light the moon was putting on her.&nbsp; I still wnted a closer look
and decided to move up a little farther.&nbsp; I was then about ten feet
away from the trees and I saw a white figure simply standing right in front
of me along the treeline.&nbsp; I turned and said "I'm going to shine my
flashlight on it." and turned back around to shine the light and the white
figure was gone.&nbsp; We started running towards the exit at that time.&nbsp;
We're still new at this so we don't really have the legs for it quite yet,
you could say.&nbsp; We are still very serious about it.&nbsp; So my two
guy friends got separated from me and my girlfriend.&nbsp; We slowed down
and started walking to look for them.&nbsp; We saw a reflection of a reflector
on a gate that we thought was our friends but was not.&nbsp; We were standing
there, hwever, trying to figure out what it was when I looked back and
saw the same white figure about twenty feet behind us.&nbsp; We started
running again.&nbsp; We ran a good 50 feet when I looked back and she was
gone.&nbsp; We slowed to a walk again, but I still felt weird.&nbsp; As
soon as we slowed down, I looked back yet again and saw the figure, still
about twenty feet behind us.&nbsp; We ran down the hill and on to the road,
right in front of a police car.&nbsp; He was cool and let us go.&nbsp;
Our friends met us back at our car and we drove away, all scared s**tless,
but at the same time felling exhilerated.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally have all the proof I need of not only
general paranormal activity, but the Albino Lady herself.&nbsp; Next time,
I'm taking a camera and anything else I can to help document my findings.&nbsp;
I will swear to this story until the day I die, and my friends will to.&nbsp;
In fact, they'll tell you the exact same story.&nbsp; I have to say it
was great fun, and I can't wait to do it again.</b>

<br><b>A TRUE STORY</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: FRANEYJARKER@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My boss and a salesperson and I were driving the van back to my boss's
house</b>
<br><b>in an older nieghborhood they both lived in in Macon when they got
into a</b>
<br><b>conversation about on old house in his neighborhood that had been
on the</b>
<br><b>market unsold for years.&nbsp; The story was that several people
had died there</b>
<br><b>under odd circumstances, and one girl who lived there had died in
a car wreck nearby.&nbsp; At the time, I dismissed it as a good story and
forgot the whole thing.</b>
<br><b>About a month later, I had a dream that I was somehow in a girls
car as if</b>
<br><b>sitting in the back seat while she drove down a nearby road.&nbsp;
I could</b>
<br><b>vividly see the orange on the dash.&nbsp; Suddenly she veered off
the road and hit a</b>
<br><b>utility pole at the bottom of a steep hill and I found myself looking
at her</b>
<br><b>from the front and her distinct eyes were</b>
<br><b>gesturing as if to say, "do you see it?!"&nbsp; I shot out of bed
and was awake</b>
<br><b>and sweating just like the lame cliche you see in the movies.&nbsp;
The dream</b>
<br><b>bothered me so much that I began to do a bit of research on the
house.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>did find out that 4 people with the house had indeed died between
1 and 3 in the</b>
<br><b>morning.&nbsp; Most disturbing was the story I pieced together about
the girl.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had NEVER seen a picture of her</b>
<br><b>and in fact lived in another state when she died in 1985 at age
19.</b>
<br><b>What I found was that she was a model who had been on Christmas
break from</b>
<br><b>college and visiting home when she was killed.&nbsp; She had been
drinking at a</b>
<br><b>party and her friends took her home and put her to bed.&nbsp; Sometime
between 1</b>
<br><b>and 3 in the morning, she had snuck out of the house and gotten
into her</b>
<br><b>grey Mazda RX7.&nbsp; She plowed into a utility pole at the bottom
of a steep hill less that a quarter mile from the house, but the head injuries
did not kill her.&nbsp; She had a</b>
<br><b>cigarette that tumbled into her lap and smoldered a wool skirt she
was</b>
<br><b>wearing while she was dazed.&nbsp; From the vantage point of neighbors
it was</b>
<br><b>impossible to see the wreck due to a high rising</b>
<br><b>hill which would have obscured the view.&nbsp; Nobody heard it and
she died of</b>
<br><b>asphyxiation while in the car.&nbsp; I located an obituary which
did not show a</b>
<br><b>clear phot, so then I managed to find a yearbook from her school
in the</b>
<br><b>library.&nbsp; I just about fell over when I saw her eyes staring
back at me!!</b>
<br><b>It was the SAME girl from my dream!!</b>
<br><b>I never told anybody about this or a couple of susequent dreams
I've had</b>
<br><b>Over the years.&nbsp; I later learned, however, that she had showed
me the exact spot</b>
<br><b>she had died.</b>

<p><b>Playmates</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dinky@sgi.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;i work at a catholic school . i work as an aid with the pre
school</b>
<br><b>teacher.one day we were sitting on the floor with the children in
what we</b>
<br><b>call circle time.while the teacher and i and the children were sitting
on</b>
<br><b>the floor the floor got very warm next to us and then a smell of
something</b>
<br><b>burning got very strong so i went and got the janitor and we took
the kids</b>
<br><b>out of the room. nothing was found.this happened about a year and
a half</b>
<br><b>ago.i still work at the same place and just recently i was in the
office</b>
<br><b>running off something on the xerox and one of the teachers in the
upper</b>
<br><b>grades came running in the office and said he just got the wits
scared out</b>
<br><b>of him because he was sitting at his desk and he could feel someone</b>
<br><b>standing in front of him.when he looked up a young girl was standing
in</b>
<br><b>front of him.(his class was not in the room at the time ,they were
out to</b>
<br><b>gym)well, when he had come in the office and told what happened
the</b>
<br><b>principal said that he heard children laughing as he was coming
up to the</b>
<br><b>second floor of the school.when he got by the rooms none of the
children</b>
<br><b>were in the rooms.what do you think of that.after i heard that i
thought</b>
<br><b>back to the warm spots on the floor and think that maybe they were
children</b>
<br><b>of ghosts sitting in with us.ialso have another story to tell.i
bought a</b>
<br><b>house in 1979 and already had one child that was three and pregant
with my</b>
<br><b>second.my daughter used to stay in the upstairs and talk and play
with</b>
<br><b>someone.i would ask her who she was talking to and she would tell
me aunt</b>
<br><b>sally and her kids.so one day i got tired of her doing this and
i said show</b>
<br><b>me where the are and she took me upstairs and pulled the door back
and said</b>
<br><b>they were in behind the door.i just figured they were imaginary</b>
<br><b>friends.then one day she came down the steps and told me that sally
said to</b>
<br><b>name the baby kelly.i was almost due and was still not sure of a
name.i</b>
<br><b>never thought anything else about it and i delivered my baby and
i named</b>
<br><b>her kelly.my girls are now out of high school and i have been divorced
from</b>
<br><b>their father since they were 5 and 3.one day kelly decided that
she wanted</b>
<br><b>to go live with her father .so she did .( she was in 9th grade).she
was</b>
<br><b>there for a few weeks and called me on the phone and said that the&nbsp;
house</b>
<br><b>was haunted and she wanted to come back home.well, she ended up
coming back</b>
<br><b>and her and her sister were talking and she said why didn't you
want to</b>
<br><b>stay at daddys house.she thought that she just used that as an excuse
to</b>
<br><b>not stay there anymore amd kelly told her sister that the place
was haunted</b>
<br><b>and she was scared and she described the ghosts to her and it turned
out</b>
<br><b>that it was the same imaginary friends that told her sister when
she was</b>
<br><b>three to tell me to name her kelly. so the bottom line here is that
a ghost</b>
<br><b>named my child for me 19 years ago. there dad still lives in that
house to</b>
<br><b>this day.i am remarried.kelly has not been in that house since 9th
grade.</b>
<br><b>ive owned 3 houses in my life time and two were haunted.the one
i live in</b>
<br><b>now is a new constuction because i am tired of the ghosts.my second
house</b>
<br><b>was haunted with a young women in a white gown.i could keep going
on about</b>
<br><b>my experiences but i would be glad if you could just take the time

<br><b>A Phantom Fire</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bayliving@hotmail.com.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was driving to work one mid afternoon
a few years back, (I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worked nights at the time.) I noticed a
column of smoke in the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distance that was rising into the sky.&nbsp;
I thought it might be a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house that was on fire, or that maybe someone
was clearing brush.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I got closer, I was able to follow the
column of smoke to the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; edge of the woods.&nbsp; As I passed, I
noticed what seemed to be a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bonfire that had gotten out of control
and was now starting to</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catch the trees under it on fire.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did what any good citizen would do and
called the fire department</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from my cell phone to inform them of the
spreading fire.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; asked for an exact location, but because
the fire was at the edge</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the woods and there were several miles
between crossing roads, I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could not do that.&nbsp; I instead told
the dispatcher that I would turn</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; around and try to give landmarks for the
firemen to use to find the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funny thing was, as I was heading back
the other way towards the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; growing fire, there was no longer any smoke.&nbsp;
Since I had the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dispatcher on the phone still, I informed
him of this and offered</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to him that maybe the property owners had
put out the fire.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drove back by the area that was engulfed
in flames not minutes</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before, to my bemusement I could not see
even the slightest trace</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that a fire was ever there!&nbsp; The trees
were not burnt and the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ground was green.&nbsp; There was no smoke
in the air or anything.&nbsp; Not</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even the smell of smoke!!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To say the least, I was a bit embarrassed
and told the dispatcher</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to disregard my call and hoped he would
not call the cops to have</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me arrested for making a prank phone call.&nbsp;
He said understood</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (probably thought I was crazy) and would
not report me to the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; police.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still see that phantom fire burning like
it was yesterday!!&nbsp; Has</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anybody else had this kind of experience?&nbsp;
If so, drop me an email</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at bayliving@hotmail.com.&nbsp; I'd like
to know that I'm not alone.</b>

<p><b>A Most Unusual Experience</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: thesparrow19@juno.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have got to share what happened just last night (well, actually
it was</b>
<br><b>about two in the morning). A couple of friends and I just got to
my house</b>
<br><b>after helping with the inventory of my aunts Trade Secret store
at Eagle</b>
<br><b>Ridge Mall. As soon as we entered through the screen door, I was
fumbling</b>
<br><b>with my keys when I heard my TV on. I unlocked the door and grabbed
my</b>
<br><b>sword (an old ceremonial blade I got at an antique store) and went</b>
<br><b>through the house, looking in every room and checking locks. No
one was</b>
<br><b>there, all the locks were the same as I left them. I turned off
the TV,</b>
<br><b>it had been on channel 4, the one channel we use whenever we put
a movie</b>
<br><b>in the VCR, which was also on. Curious, I looked in the VCR and
there was</b>
<br><b>a Ninja Turtles cartoon tape that I had just gotten for my 4-year
old</b>
<br><b>cousin! Now, I know I have a ghost in my house. It opens doors,
once</b>
<br><b>tried to lock me out, messes with my swords and sunglasses (always
hiding</b>
<br><b>them), looks through the papers in my grandmother's room whenever
she's</b>
<br><b>asleep, and just making the odd noise every now and then. My friends
and</b>
<br><b>I realized that the ghost, whom I've named Susie Q, had been watching
a</b>
<br><b>Ninja Turtles tape! Unusual, eh? Trust me, it happened. Before I
typed</b>
<br><b>this, I asked everybody if they had been in the house during the
day. No</b>
<br><b>one had.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Maine Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: paulcarro@mediaone.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'll be honest, even though I have had three seperate experiences
over</b>
<br><b>the years, I have never really let them be a big part of my life
but</b>
<br><b>have told them to friends over the years, normally during this time
of</b>
<br><b>year.&nbsp; I wouldn't even be writing if I didn't see this sight
mentioned</b>
<br><b>on the news due to our proximity to Halloween but the events that</b>
<br><b>happened to me were very real.&nbsp; I have not read readers stories
here yet</b>
<br><b>so I am unfamiliar with format so edit this at will as long as you
don't</b>
<br><b>tamper with the events as they occured.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am from Maine but have lived in Los Angeles
for the last ten years</b>
<br><b>but my extended family is still there.&nbsp; My Aunt and Uncle lived
in a</b>
<br><b>town called Norway, Maine, in a two story house that was on top
of a</b>
<br><b>very steep hill, so that from the lowered back yard, the house was</b>
<br><b>stilted and looked far more than two stories.&nbsp; It also contained
an</b>
<br><b>attic that, technically was a third floor as it had it's own windows,</b>
<br><b>and also a basement that in some sense was a fourth floor as my
two</b>
<br><b>cousins had a play room down there and the laundry room also.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, when I was seven I went to spend the
weekend because my</b>
<br><b>cousins were the same age and a year younger so I always enjoyed</b>
<br><b>spending time with them.&nbsp; We had a great time playing as usual
though I</b>
<br><b>felt uneasy in the basement for some reason.&nbsp; Finally on my
second night</b>
<br><b>there as I lay in bed - they had a big house and I was given my
own room</b>
<br><b>to sleep in- was when my unease took shape.&nbsp; Understand that
I had</b>
<br><b>already spent a night and was fine, and also that particular night
we</b>
<br><b>were playing with a light bright which was something my family couldn't</b>
<br><b>afford at the time so I was having a good time, no reason to feel</b>
<br><b>uneasy.&nbsp; But that night about midnight I awoke, if I ever managed
to get</b>
<br><b>to sleep at all, and I looked at the doorway&nbsp; which was purposefully</b>
<br><b>left open so I could get the benefit of the hallway light if I needed
to</b>
<br><b>find my way to the restroom at night, and what did I see but a tall
thin</b>
<br><b>figure standing in the doorway.&nbsp; The figure was pure black
and his head</b>
<br><b>literally touched the top of the doorframe but he was strangely
thin for</b>
<br><b>someone so tall.&nbsp; There was no sense of calm in me, I freaked.&nbsp;
This was</b>
<br><b>not my uncle checking in on me as he was short and to put it politely,</b>
<br><b>girth challenged.&nbsp; Since I was on the second floor there was
only one</b>
<br><b>way out, through that doorway and I ran for it.&nbsp; I ran around
or through</b>
<br><b>the figure, screaming, straight to my Aunt and Uncle's room where
I</b>
<br><b>spent the night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning I didn my best to believe it
was a dream but when</b>
<br><b>my cousins and I went to the basement to play I was so uneasy I</b>
<br><b>convinced them to spend the rest of the day outside until my parents</b>
<br><b>came that afternoon.&nbsp; As we played at the sandpit in the lowered</b>
<br><b>backyead I looked up towards the attic window and saw a person I
did</b>
<br><b>not recognize staring down at us.&nbsp; It was not a black figure,
it had a</b>
<br><b>face but I don't know the person, he seemed rather old.&nbsp; I
looked away</b>
<br><b>and didn't want to scare my cousins as they had to live there so
I</b>
<br><b>didn't say anything but looking back twice, he was still looking
down.</b>
<br><b>The third time he was gone.&nbsp; Needless to say I was glad when
my parents</b>
<br><b>picked me up that afternoon.&nbsp; I went back a few times and experienced</b>
<br><b>nothing but my relatives moved out shortly thereafter to a new house</b>
<br><b>which I never had any bad feelings about.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I reached high school and had relayed another
experience to my</b>
<br><b>family, that Aunt, without knowing what I had experienced that weekend</b>
<br><b>went on to tell me the story of what was going on in her old house.</b>
<br><b>According to her things were constantly moving in the house and
things</b>
<br><b>were constantly disappearing.&nbsp; Also water constantly appeared
around the</b>
<br><b>laundry room but every plumber who came out couldn't find anything
wrong</b>
<br><b>with the washer or the plumbing.&nbsp; The more problematic thing
was that</b>
<br><b>when they would go out they would return and every light in the
house</b>
<br><b>would be on, including the attic and the heat would be turned up</b>
<br><b>unbearably high.&nbsp; They would search the house for intruders
but no one</b>
<br><b>was there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The camel back straw came one night when my uncle
walked from the</b>
<br><b>second floor to the first to get a drink late at night and the t.v.</b>
<br><b>suddenly turned on at full blast.&nbsp; The next day my Aunt and
Uncle went</b>
<br><b>to the base of the basement stairs where many of the odd happenings</b>
<br><b>seemed to occur and yelled out, "Look, we know you're here but if
you're</b>
<br><b>going to be here look after us and protect us, don't bother us."</b>
<br><b>Apparently the weirdness stopped after that but they moved soon
after</b>
<br><b>anyway.&nbsp; My Aunt says the new people moving in called them
within a week</b>
<br><b>and she told them what to say but I don't know what happened after</b>
<br><b>that.&nbsp; In the new house my relatives have led a great and happy
life,</b>
<br><b>and everyone is doing very well.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had two other totally unrelated experiences
since then which</b>
<br><b>I will write about later.&nbsp; As I said, I don't dwell on these
events,</b>
<br><b>though they terrified me, but they did happen.&nbsp; – PC</b>

<p><b>A Little Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TFryant@csraeoa.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was seven months pregnant with my third child I started to
stay home with my 2 year old daughter instead of working.&nbsp; Almost
daily my daughter around the same time each day would stop watching TV
and annouce that she was going to go play with "that little girl" or either
"that little girl is here to play with me".&nbsp; I thought nothing of
it figuring that she was lonely in our new house and had developed an imaginary
friend.</b>
<br><b>One night while in bed with my husband I was awaken by my daughter
calling for me "Mommy, Mommy..." Without even opening my eyes I told her
to come into my room.&nbsp; After saying this I must have dozed back off
because again I was awaken by my daughter calling "Mommy, Mommy" Only this
time she was crying like she could'nt find me.&nbsp; I got up and went
to my bedroom door which was right beside my side of the bed, but where
I could not see out without getting out of bed.&nbsp; I stood in the doorway
and could still clearly hear her calling to me only the voice was coming
from right in front of me and I could see down the hall into my daughter's
room where she was sound asleep.&nbsp; I jumped back into bed and woke
up my husband who immediatley told me I was crazy and that I had dreamed
the whole thing.&nbsp; I tried to sleep but needless to say I could not.&nbsp;
The next day right on schedule my daughter announced that she was going
to play with "that little girl".&nbsp; I peeked in on her playing but did
not see anything unusual although she did talk as if someone was in the
room with her (not unusual for a 2 year old).&nbsp; I decided that my husband
was right and that I had dreamed the whole thing up, probabley pregnancy
hormones.&nbsp; That night when I fell asleep the same thing happened again.&nbsp;
The little voice sounded afraid so lost and scared.&nbsp; This continued
daily with my daughter's playmate and nightly with me hearing voices.&nbsp;
I asked my mother who was very concerned and told me to be careful of letting
a spirit in because they could be deceitful and may only be pretending
to be a child so that we would welcome it.&nbsp; We also began trying to
find out where the spirit may had come from but to no avail.&nbsp; The
voices became so frequent that whenever I would get up at night like most
pregnant women do I would expect to see "her".&nbsp; In my mind I had a
perfect picture of how she looked right down to the clothes that she wore
even though I never saw her.&nbsp; This continued for months until one
evening...</b>
<br><b>I was sound asleep when I was awoken by my husband shaking me.&nbsp;
He was terrified.&nbsp; I asked him what was wrong.&nbsp; He said "I heard
it."&nbsp; Not understanding I asked him what he had heard. "The little
girl she was standing by you calling for her mommy.&nbsp; I didn't see
her but her voice was right beside you."&nbsp; He then wanted to pull my
daughter out of bed and make her sleep with us until we found a new house
(we needed a bigger place with a new baby coming).&nbsp; I explained to
my husband that the spirit was friendly and would not harm her if it had
not already.&nbsp; My husband lay awake all night shaking so badly that
he kept me awake.&nbsp; After that I never heard from her&nbsp; and my
daughter never went to play with "that little girl" again.</b>
<br><b>If anyone knows why this spirit came to me or why she may have left
after my husband's encounter with her or if you have similar stories please
e-mail me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>" Unknown Happenings "</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: master@optusnet.com.au</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I live in an ordinary 3 bedroom house</b>
<br><b>in South Australia. Since I have moved in some weird things have
happened but</b>
<br><b>are beginning to happen more often since 2x other friends of mine
have moved in</b>
<br><b>with me. I was sharing the place with another friend of mine who
is very plain</b>
<br><b>and simple and believes in what he can see and feel. I never asked
him or spoke</b>
<br><b>to him about my experiences simply out of being told I was an idiot.
The first</b>
<br><b>occurance was in a dream *Sounds ordinary enough - just my imagination*
I was</b>
<br><b>standing in my kitchen looking out the window when in the corner
of my eye I</b>
<br><b>could see a black figure of a man wearing a hat. He was a solid
black figure,</b>
<br><b>just standing there in the doorway. When I turned to look straight
on at him he</b>
<br><b>vanished. I began screaming and ran towards my lounge room where
there were</b>
<br><b>around 7-8 children 10 - 12 years old with sleeping bags. I am not
sure what</b>
<br><b>they were doing but they didn't acknowledge me being in the room
trying to call</b>
<br><b>to them for help.... This was my dream. After this dream things
in my bedroom</b>
<br><b>were happing. I would wake up and the television would be on. I
would get home</b>
<br><b>from work and the computer was on. The time on my alarm clock was
o.k - so it</b>
<br><b>wasn't a black out or anything. I am more the person, I want to
see something</b>
<br><b>and when I think I have I will try and prove it wrong to see if
it was real or</b>
<br><b>not !!!! I don't want to look the fool when what I have witnessed
was something</b>
<br><b>stupid like a blackout or something etc... My aunty is a religious
person (I am</b>
<br><b>not !!!) and I told her the next day at work and she said straight
away that was</b>
<br><b>going to come round with someone to check out the house. She ended
up coming</b>
<br><b>around and 'anointing' the house with some oil in all of the bedrooms.
She said</b>
<br><b>that the place would be o.k now, but if anything happened again
I would the only</b>
<br><b>one who could stop it by saying Jesus Name !!! Well after this nothing
happened</b>
<br><b>and I didn't have to say Jesus name. My friend moved out and I have
had 2x other</b>
<br><b>people move in within the last 2 weeks. They have said that have
witnessed the</b>
<br><b>following. The girl who moved in, into my old room is having similar
issues with</b>
<br><b>her telvision and video player - this could be anything, electrical
fault or</b>
<br><b>what ever. But this has been happening right infront of her. She
said she</b>
<br><b>couldn't explain how it happened. The other guy who just moved in,
he was</b>
<br><b>putting stuff into his room and would go out to get more stuff to
put in there.</b>
<br><b>When he got back the stuff he had put in there had moved to another
postion of</b>
<br><b>the bedroom. This freaked him out and told me straight away. Last
night I</b>
<br><b>witnessed the dark figure again, for real - not in a dream. I was
standing in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen looking out the windows drinking orange juice from the
carton. In</b>
<br><b>the corner of my eye the dark figure walked past the doorway towards
the lounge.</b>
<br><b>As soon as I saw this I ran to the lounge room - nothing !!! My
other 2x room</b>
<br><b>mates were inbed with the lights off. Also my house mate's Grandma
passed away</b>
<br><b>very recently - 6 months ago.. He has inheritted all of her belongings
for when</b>
<br><b>he moved out of home. Lounge chair / kitchen utensiles / cups +
plates + bowls /</b>
<br><b>Drawers / Cabinets etc... Could this have anything to do with it
??? I emailed</b>
<br><b>my friend today at work what happened and he was checking out your
site today. I</b>
<br><b>thought I would email you and let you know what you think. Well
this is what has</b>
<br><b>happended. I guess it is pretty lame to what you have heard and
encountered, but</b>
<br><b>just want an opinion to what we could do to see if it is for real
or just silly</b>
<br><b>things. Also the landlord said that the previous tennats of this
house used to</b>
<br><b>be drug dealers and did a runner leaving the house in a horrible
state. They had</b>
<br><b>ripped up all the carpets and smashed the walls in with hammers.
They had stole</b>
<br><b>their antique$1000 curtains in the 3x bedrooms and lounge. They
had Marajuiana</b>
<br><b>crops within the roof of the house and had the police doing raids
into the house</b>
<br><b>very frequently for this and other drugs. The landlord doesn't know
if anyone</b>
<br><b>was killed here or anything, but has had a pretty rough time with
the previous</b>
<br><b>tenants. This is all the information I can provide to you. Hope
you can help or</b>
<br><b>shed some light to these happenings.</b>

<p><b>A House in TN</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sukey@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband,myself and two young children,ages 7 and 5 moved into
this</b>
<br><b>very large homey feeling old home,but after a while we did not feel
too</b>
<br><b>welcome.The daughter,age 7 1/2 had nightmares of a hovering woman.The</b>
<br><b>two side porches,one had wheelchair ramp.My five year old son,running</b>
<br><b>barefoot down this ramp,fell,screaming there was something sticking
in</b>
<br><b>his foot.I could find only a small hole just under the big toe that
bled</b>
<br><b>very little at the time.But the foot began to swell,we took him
to</b>
<br><b>doctors in Bolivar,X-rays were taken,nothing showed up in his foot.It</b>
<br><b>got worse and worse.But other bad things were happening,a closet
door in</b>
<br><b>the master bedroom,a sort of walk-in closet,would not stay closed
at</b>
<br><b>night,a creaking noise,as if some one was rolling something across
the</b>
<br><b>bedroom floor.The light that would come,a white cold feeling would
seem</b>
<br><b>to hold me in the bed although I could hear my son calling me,when
I</b>
<br><b>could finally get to him,he would be sound asleep.My husband woke
one</b>
<br><b>night screaming because of the heat.He worked at the Toone Arsenal;that</b>
<br><b>afternoon,one man was burned to death,another burned very badly,my</b>
<br><b>husband said the ordor and the heat was what he had felt and smelled
the</b>
<br><b>night before.My daughter finally got to the point where she would
not</b>
<br><b>sleep at night,only after the sun came up.Our son's foot was really</b>
<br><b>getting to the point that red streaks were running from his toe
to his</b>
<br><b>ankle.When we got out of that house,took him to a specalist in</b>
<br><b>Bensenville,Illinois,where we had lived before moving to Bolivar,The</b>
<br><b>surgeon did no e-xays,numbed the foot,and cut out a splinter of
wood one</b>
<br><b>&amp; 1/2 inches long.The infection was well on the way of costing
him his</b>
<br><b>foot.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The neighbor across the street finally gave us the story of
the house</b>
<br><b>when she found out we were moving.A doctor and his family,wife and</b>
<br><b>daughter,had built and lived in this house for many happy years.The
wife</b>
<br><b>had died by her own hand,the doctor in an accident had an infured</b>
<br><b>foot,not properly cared for,lost the left leg to gangrene.My son's</b>
<br><b>injury was his left foot.The walk-in closet was where the daughter
slept</b>
<br><b>to care for her father at night.My daughter's bedroom was the room
the</b>
<br><b>daughter had as a child.the daughter was fatally burned in an accident</b>
<br><b>at her place of employment after her father's death. The house was

<br><b>A Haunted Cottage</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: doug.engstrom@sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Up at my cottage there are many stories involving death.&nbsp; Like
the</b>
<br><b>cottage next to me had three deaths.&nbsp; And the cottage next
to that had</b>
<br><b>had a shooting on the front lawn.&nbsp; And further up the road
is an</b>
<br><b>abandoned cottage that has dishes and a bed and covers and has been
left</b>
<br><b>like that for over 20 years.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My friends know these stories and loved to hear them.&nbsp;
One day though</b>
<br><b>we were all scared out of our wits.&nbsp; It was unbelievable and
we are</b>
<br><b>still trying to find a logical explanation.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was around dusk when my father took three
of our group up to the</b>
<br><b>abandoned cottage. My two other friends and myself were just trying
to</b>
<br><b>find ways to amuse ourselves. About an hour later we saw my dad
walking</b>
<br><b>towards my cottage.&nbsp; Figuring we could scare our friends we
waited until</b>
<br><b>we saw them.&nbsp; Once we saw them we ran out of hiding to scare
them, but</b>
<br><b>found nobody there.&nbsp; As we were starting to look for them I
saw a white</b>
<br><b>mist that just appeared and disappeared.&nbsp; Figuring it was my
imagination</b>
<br><b>I didn't mention it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes later two of our friends came running
up from the lake.</b>
<br><b>They asked us how we had gotten up from the bush on the road to
the pit</b>
<br><b>so quickly.&nbsp; We asked them what they meant and they said a
bush had been</b>
<br><b>moving and they had heard giggling coming from it.&nbsp; We told
hem that we</b>
<br><b>had been in the opposite direction.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we went with them to the pit with them discussing
what we had</b>
<br><b>seen.&nbsp; We met up with the other friend in the pit.&nbsp; As
we were talking</b>
<br><b>it started to get dark.&nbsp; That's when the faces started to appear.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>each saw them all around us, hiding in the bushes.&nbsp; At that
time we ran</b>
<br><b>back to the cottage.&nbsp; Then my friend saw the mist I had seen.&nbsp;
This time</b>
<br><b>outside her window.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember I said there are a lot of
deaths around the cottage well,</b>
<br><b>the pit is thought to be a native burial ground.&nbsp; And now I
never go</b>
<br><b>into the pit at dark.</b>

<br><b>A Childs Cry</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cleatus1999@gateway.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A few years back, I worked as a house keeper at a Childerns</b>
<br><b>Home.</b>
<br><b>My co-workers and I use to joke around about this one cottage that
was empty because it gave us the creeps. One of my workers would not go
in there unless she was aloud to leave all the doors open. She was terrified
even if someone was in there with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that I'm more
aware of spirits than most people around me. I always tell my husband "there's
a ghost here, or this place is haunted,etc."&nbsp; Anyway, I know without
a doubt that there is a child's spirit in this building.&nbsp; I have heard
him run,I have heard him chatter,and call my name, and he has scared the
living daylites out of me by pulling the shower curtains shut on me while
I was cleaning a stall!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give a few examples:
On this one occasion, my workers and I were taking a break after mopping
the halls. We were sitting in a little area with chairs and coffee tables.
The floors were starting to dry but they were still damp enough that if
you walked on them it would leave footprints. My workers and I were talking
and laughing when one of my friend's said to</b>
<br><b>listen. All 4 of us heard what sounded like tennis shoes squeaking
on tile. We actually heard him running down the halls. I jumped up to see
who was in the building besides us and to my suprise I found only small
shoe prints on the drying floors.&nbsp; No one would come see except my
one friend that knew what we were encountering.&nbsp;&nbsp; I questioned
my boss about the history of this compound, not telling her of our encounters,
just wanting to know more about the place since it is very old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I did find out however about the cemetary on the grounds and the many unmarked
graves of children who die with no loving family to put up a cement stone
with even a name. I spent alot of time back there and most of the headstones
only had first names and the dates of thier deaths.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However
I did find out a little of the history from a man who spent his youth in
the custody of the state annd lived there for some time.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;4 Years of Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rockchic28@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I had a ghost live with my family and I for about 4 years.
Weird huh? not all that weird if you compare to what happened in that house.
I may have been young at the time but I knew a few cold spots and people
that didn't live with me when I see them.</b>
<br><b>It all starts off in Chicago, IL. I was about 8 years old (possibility
older) and me and my family moved into this house, it was very small for
a family of 5. The house only had 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen/dinning
room/and living room. My older sister shared a room with me, we had bunk
beds but I never liked to stay in the room. I could never sleep! Well I
liked the couch better, and my mom worked nights so my dad was up with
my little sister (who was only about 3 or 4 months old). One night I left
the kitchen light on. and from where your laying on the couch you can see
the dinning room, the bathroom, my mom and dads room and the kitchen. the
kitchen was long and narrow. It was about 3 AM and I woke up to a bunch
of pounding on the floor. I sit up and there's someone crawling on the
floor! It couldn't have been the baby this person that was crawling on
the floor was full grown! and it crawled in to what we called the desk
room. I don't know when this house was built but I sure it had MANY owners..
In go up like that? My older sister (who is now 19) had seen it too. Sometimes
me and my older sister will be in our room talking or something and we
would hear the dragging of the dinning room chairs being moved around.
We would go out with something to hit who ever is out there and not a soul
was out there. I stay home alone often, we had an alarm system so I would
turn that on for safety. I was sitting there and the chandler (over the
dinning room table) is swing back and forth and its winter so there is
NO windows open. The chandler is heavy and very old. and it was just swinging
around like someone pushed it. It scared me to death! I wasn't the only
one who had an experience in that house, my mom came home one day (keep
in mind she works nights) it was about 6:00 am and everyone was sleeping
she was in the kitchen and she was just standing there. It was so peaceful
then something just walked right though her. she said she felt it just
pass through her it was an odd feeling. My dad also heard the chairs being
moved.</b>

<p><b>A Couple of Tales</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pcontrol@stny.rr.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>There is a local legend about a haunted tombstone. It is said that
a woman</b>
<br><b>on her death bed made her husband promise never to remarry. A few
years</b>
<br><b>passed and he fell in love. They say the moment he put the ring
on his new</b>
<br><b>wife his dead wife started to come through the tombstone to haunt
him. An</b>
<br><b>ghostly image appears on the stone - looking like a woman lying
in a coffin</b>
<br><b>and slowly it starts to look like she is sitting up as months go
by. They</b>
<br><b>have done tests on the soil and the stone and have replaced the
stone 4</b>
<br><b>times. There is no scientific reason for it.</b>
<br><b>I went with a friend and sure enough it looked as though there was
an image</b>
<br><b>of a woman with long hair done up in a bun with her head resting
on a</b>
<br><b>pillow. I went back 4 months later with another friend and the image
had</b>
<br><b>changed to a woman sitting up at a 45degree angle, as though she
was sitting</b>
<br><b>up to get out of the coffin.</b>
<br><b>The strangess part is what happened to my film. I had purposely
left the</b>
<br><b>same roll of film in my camera to take these pictures months apart
and</b>
<br><b>compare them. A friend of mine worked in a photo shop so one night
when she</b>
<br><b>was there alone I took them in for her to develop. She put them
on top of</b>
<br><b>the processor and went to get some chemicals to refill the machine.
She was</b>
<br><b>the only person there - the machine was behind a locked gate so
nobody could</b>
<br><b>get to it but her. When she came back a few minutes later my film
was gone.</b>
<br><b>She searched all over the room which was empty except for the machine
and th</b>
<br><b>machine itself had coverings all the way down to the floor so it
couldn't</b>
<br><b>have rolled under it. She told everyone she'd lost a roll of film
and if</b>
<br><b>they found it to let her know. The store moved locations 2 months
later and</b>
<br><b>nobody ever found it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The other story is about a ghost that lives in my parents house.</b>
<br><b>A man died in the basement of a heart attack shortly before my parents</b>
<br><b>bought the house. As we grew up we got a piano and a pool table,
putting</b>
<br><b>both of them in the basement. A few days later we starting hearing
pool</b>
<br><b>balls clinking around the table (and we always cleared the balls
off the</b>
<br><b>table when we finished playing) and a few bars of music played on
the piano.</b>
<br><b>There were also foot steps heard coming up from the basement into
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen.</b>
<br><b>Several times I would be sitting on the couch in the family room
and through</b>
<br><b>the window cut into the kitchen wall I could see the man walking
through the</b>
<br><b>kitchen when I was the only one home. Most of the time he would
disappear</b>
<br><b>before he got to the doorway of the family room but once in a while
he would</b>
<br><b>walk to the doorway, look into the room and disappear.</b>
<br><b>We grew used to it - it was a friendly spirit so we didn't mind.
I forgot to</b>
<br><b>tell a friend about it when I was 12 and one day I went upstairs
to use the</b>
<br><b>bathroom. She heard footsteps on the back stairs and thought I had
gone</b>
<br><b>downstairs to the other bathroom. I heard a scream and went downstairs
to</b>
<br><b>see her putting on her shoes. She had walked into the kitchen and
seen the</b>
<br><b>man coming across the floor!</b>
<br><b>It was actually funny one time. I had a boyfriend spending the night
when my</b>
<br><b>parents were gone for the weekend. My bedroom was off the steps
that led to</b>
<br><b>the kitchen. Sure enough we heard footsteps. The boyfriend thought
somebody</b>
<br><b>had come home and somehow he wasn't reassured when I told him it
was just a</b>
<br><b>ghost. He insisted on sleeping with an empty champagne bottle in
his hand. I</b>
<br><b>got no sleep that night - every little noise he heard he'd grab
me and say,</b>
<br><b>"did you hear that?"</b>
<br><b>The last night that I lived at home the ghost appeared in my bedroom
and</b>
<br><b>stayed for a few minutes smiling at me. I think he was saying goodbye.
I</b>
<br><b>also smelled his cologne (not a kind anyone in my family wears)
the first</b>
<br><b>time I took my son to my parents.</b>

<p><b>2 Summertime Encounters....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NAN752@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This happened last summer one night about 1am. in our house in Ma.
My son who</b>
<br><b>was 14 at the time had gone to bed a few hours before. My husband
was at work</b>
<br><b>(he is on 12 hr. shifts at a Plastics Plant, 5PM-5AM.). I was sitting
at the</b>
<br><b>computer surfing the Web and all was quiet in the house. Our dog
was in the</b>
<br><b>room with me and the 2 cats were asleep in the living room. Now
at this time,</b>
<br><b>I wasn't thinking about anything scary or feeling nervous about
anything</b>
<br><b>either. Suddenly, I heard a strange mans' voice out in the kitchen.
I</b>
<br><b>thought, "What the hell is this ? Did someone get in the house or
what?" I</b>
<br><b>got up and slowly, quietly, opened the door to see what was going
on. There</b>
<br><b>was noone there at all! Just at that moment, the phone rang and
it was my</b>
<br><b>son. He has his own phone in his room and he dialed our number.
He asked me</b>
<br><b>if I had just been knocking on his door a few seconds ago. I said
"What? Come</b>
<br><b>on out here for a minute" He sounded really nervous. He said he
was woken up</b>
<br><b>by the sound of light rapping on his door, he called out (not too

<br><b>"Ma?" a few times and got no response. That's when he called our

<br><b>Apparently while I was hearing this "man's voice" out in the kitchen,</b>

<p><b>Cabin in the Woods</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: XxPreciousRainxX@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was first born in&nbsp; September 21, 1985 my Great Grandfather,
John</b>
<br><b>Pierce built&nbsp; a huge cabin deep in the woods of Colorado. Two
days after he</b>
<br><b>finished building the cabin he died in the back bedroom in his sleep,
it was</b>
<br><b>always so cold in there even when the rest of the house and out
side was hot</b>
<br><b>or warm. My Grandma and Grandpa Pierce didn't want the cabin to
sit in the</b>
<br><b>woods empty after he put so much work into the house so me, my Mom,
and my</b>
<br><b>Dad moved into the cabin a few weeks after his dead. My mother told
me when I</b>
<br><b>was little I would sit in my room alone and talk to someone who
she couldn't</b>
<br><b>see, I myself can't remember having an "imaginary" friend or talking
to</b>
<br><b>anyone. TV's would turn on and flip through the channels until the
point</b>
<br><b>where my Mom and Dad got upset and unplugged them just to have them
plug back</b>
<br><b>in and repeat the process. Every pet we owned died from a strange
illness.</b>
<br><b>Footsteps were heard during the day and night walking through every
room and</b>
<br><b>hall of the house. Objects would be thrown across the room only
to shatter or</b>
<br><b>slam into the walls. We put up with it for years because it never
really hurt</b>
<br><b>anyone, well, only the pets...</b>
<br><b>When I turned 12 the ghost became more active. Pinching me so hard
it would</b>
<br><b>leave bruises, scratching me, and pulling my hair. One night I was
kicked out</b>
<br><b>of my bed and slapped repeatedly. I kept kicking and punching, but
my hits</b>
<br><b>just hit air. When whatever got off of me I ran to my parents room
crying</b>
<br><b>hysterically. My Dad was so upset he went into my room and started
to scream,</b>
<br><b>telling&nbsp; whatever to show it's self. He got what he asked for,
being pushed</b>
<br><b>out of my room and looking into the room he saw a rather tall figure,
it had</b>
<br><b>no features only an outline full of black. Then the door flew shut.
I was</b>
<br><b>never allowed in the room again.</b>
<br><b>A few months later we moved out and the cabin was tore down and
sent back</b>
<br><b>into the earth it came from. Now living in Arizona and me 15, my
Dad left me</b>
<br><b>and my Mom so we live alone. Sometimes in our apartment we hear
soft</b>
<br><b>whispering, talking, footsteps, someone laying beside me in bed,
my stuffed</b>
<br><b>animals being moved and the TV turning channels, and we still can't
keep an</b>
<br><b>animal alive. But it wasn't as bad as before. Nothing close to it...</b><b></b>

<br><b>Our Old House and Our Son</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dfouch@armasson.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>We, my husband and I, moved into this house in 1997. I was raised
in this house since 1982. My dad and stepmom lived in this house at the
time of my dads' death in 1991. He did not die in the home. Our house is
very old. One section of the house is at least 100 years old and was moved
up from the river to its present location. The second part of the house
was built in the 30's. Our house also happens to be right across the street
from&nbsp; a cemetary dating back to 1870. This particular cemetary is
almost all children. Most of the headstones have deteriorated to the point
where you can barely make them out now. Of course growing up here we used
to think we saw lights in there all the time but were told it was just
our imagination. When my husband and I first moved in here in march of
'97 I was 5 months pregnant with our son. We have two older boys whose
rooms are upstairs in the older part of the home. Our bedroom and living
room are directly under their rooms. We used to hear (quite often) muffled
sounds of children laughing and moving around upstairs after our kids had
gone to bed. Numerous times we went upstairs to see what they were doing
only to find them sound asleep. After the birth of our youngest son in
July of 97 I do not remember hearing this as much. This though is where
it gets interesting to me. ( I guess I should also say that both of my
husbands parents are also deceased) When my son was old enough to walk
but not yet talking he started physically letting us know that he saw things.
He would run up to the archway and stop. He would stare at something in
the darkness of the other room (once again this would be in the older part
of the home). At first we thought he was just playing but after 30-45 minutes
of this we decided he really saw something. We asked him what it was and
he "growled" which is how he thought he was saying monster or scary. He
would not go into that room. He did this a few times. ( Another important
event at the time was that my husband got very ill around this time and
was missing alot of work, was in and out of the hospital...) After that
it did not happen for quite awhile. Then here a couple months ago my husband
was in the hospital again and the first night he had to stay there I came
home and my son was still up. I was sitting here at my desk (in the newer
part of the home) He came in and was play sword fighting. He said (now
that he is finally talking) mommy, spooky. I asked him where and he pointed
up by the archway separating the dining room from the entry to the upstairs.
I told him to get it with his sword thinking that he was still play fighting.
He said ok and ran over toward it with his sword up over his shoulder.
When he got to the archway he suddenly stopped. He was just staring up
at the same spot not saying a word. I told him to get it and he shook his
head no. I asked if he was nice and he shook his head no. Then he started
backing up slowly not taking his eyes off the spot. Once he got back to
me he just started watching something move across the room just with his
eyes. I asked him where he was now and he pointed to the corner right above
us. We just went on with our business like we always do. Then when we went
to bed I let him sleep with me. We were laying in bed and he started watching
it again. I started to say something to him and he said "shh mommy wake
him up". He said this several times. When he decided that he was going
to sleep he told me that he had to hide. So he pulled the covers over his
head. Once I thought he was asleep and pulled down the covers and he immediatly
woke up and told me no he had to hide. So I let him pull the covers back
up. After about 30 minutes I was ready to go to sleep and I did not want
him sleeping all covered up because it was too hot. So this time when I
pulled them off I had to literally pry them from his hands. I don't know
what he sees but I know he definatly sees it. Because of the timing of
his visits I wonder if it is not one of my husbands parents. His mom died
of cancer and his father killed himself six months later. I feel that all
of our parents are around us at different times so I am not sure&nbsp;
who it is that he is seeing. The only other strange thing is that when
I turn on the baby moniter which is located up in my 7 year olds room (that
is where all the kids play ) I can always hear the very muffled voices
of children talking. I think if I could just turn it up loud enough I would
be able to understand them. Because it sounds like when your kids are just
out of range of the monitor and they know that you are listening and they
whisper...</b>
<br><b>I know this is not some great sighting but... I never tell him that
what he sees is not there. I try to ask him questions about it hoping that
if he is that intuative that he will be able to keep on using it. I fully
believe in ghosts. I have had dreams that foretold of my fathers heart
attack but not when it really counted when he died. I hope that my son
can keep on using this gift.</b>
