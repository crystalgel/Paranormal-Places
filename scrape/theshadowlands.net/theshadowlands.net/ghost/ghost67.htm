</H3><P><B>By: Knreynolds@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 6 or 7, we moved into a small house in a small
peaceful</B>
<P><B>neighborhood.  Shortly after moving in, I began to hear crying sounds
in my</B>
<P><B>bedroom.  I told my mother about it and she dismissed it as a childs</B>
<P><B>imagination running wild.  Soon I began to see a full figured little
boy</B>
<P><B>sitting at the foot of my bed with his head in his hands, crying. 
He was</B>
<P><B>wearing a shorts and shirt outfit with anchors all over it.  (Which
years</B>
<P><B>later we began to refer to him as "The Little Sailer Boy.") Although
I spent</B>
<P><B>many nights in my parents bed, every night I was in my room was the
same</B>
<P><B>thing.  A short time later, I became afraid to walk down the hallway
by myself</B>
<P><B>because one night while on my way to the bathroom I saw him standing
outside</B>
<P><B>my brothers room which was next to mine.  From then on whether night
or day, I</B>
<P><B>would run down the hall instead of walking.  "The little boy" never
looked</B>
<P><B>straight at me, never moved from those two areas and never "said"
anything.</B>
<P><B>Years later in a conversation with my mother, I found out that she
had seen</B>
<P><B>and heard him a time or two.  One night she heard him and thought it
was me,</B>
<P><B>she went into my room to see why I was crying only to find me sound
asleep.</B>
<P><B>This prompted her to start asking around to find out if the neighbors
knew of</B>
<P><B>anything happening in this house in the past and several told her about
a fire</B>
<P><B>that happened in that house late at night a few years before.  She
was told</B>
<P><B>that there was a family there with two young boys, and their mother
and father</B>
<P><B>and that the whole back of the house burnt.  They had no information
however</B>
<P><B>on whether or not it had been fatal.  She questioned the owner of the
house as</B>
<P><B>well, but to my knowlede got no sure answers. We lived in that house
for about</B>
<P><B>a year, seeing and hearing him nightly until a house next door opened
up, we</B>
<P><B>then moved into that house and the owner of the original house we lived
in</B>
<P><B>moved in and about a month or so later he moved out,  boarded up the
windows</B>
<P><B>and doors and the house remained vacant for years.  I have no idea
if the</B>
<P><B>house is still standing or what happened to the "Little Sailer Boy"
although</B>
<P><B>sometimes I still wonder about him.  Until now I had only talked of
this with</B>
<P><B>my mother, and my fiance for fear of talk that may occur.  Thank you
for this</B>
<P><B>chance to finally share this story.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I don`t know if this was a actual haunting, but after years of
pondering</B>
<P><B>this strange visit I can think of no other conclusion.  I have always</B>
<P><B>been reluctant to share this story because directly after it happened,
I</B>
<P><B>met with nothing but ridicule.  I shared this story with my best
friend</B>
<P><B>at the time (she was with me when I witnessed my first haunting at
our</B>
<P><B>summer/lake house the previous summer) and she only laughed at me and</B>
<P><B>said I was making the whole thing up, she believed me only after I
still</B>
<P><B>insisted it had happened after 15 years.  When she finally and</B>
<P><B>reluctanly believed me, she raised the question that maybe I had
visited</B>
<P><B>once again by an apparition.  So, lets see what you, the readers,
think</B>
<P><B>of this story.  I swear it happened and have no idea what to make of</B>
<P><B>it.  If anybody has any input or comments, feel free to email.    So,</B>
<P><B>here it goes.  You be the judge if I have/had a vivid imagination
(this</B>
<P><B>comment one particulary irrates me) or if I actually saw and
conversed</B>
<P><B>with an apparition.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was around 14 or 15 years old and home alone.  It was a late</B>
<P><B>afternoon/early  summer evening.  I heard the doorbell ring and</B>
<P><B>immediately went to answer it.  I saw standing on our porch a man,
I</B>
<P><B>will never forget him.  He was heavy, with scruffy black hair and
beard,</B>
<P><B>and he was wearing worn out dirty overalls.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The man spoke in a southern accent and told me, and I swear this is</B>
<P><B>true, he and his son were out "PEDDLIN MUSTARD" and his son had
dropped</B>
<P><B>and broke a jar of mustard on our porch.  He asked my permission to</B>
<P><B>clean it up.  I looked out on the porch and couldn`t see any spilled</B>
<P><B>mustard but thought maybe it was out of my view.  I granted him</B>
<P><B>permission and closed and locked the door.  I peered out the window,
but</B>
<P><B>the Mustard Peddler was nowhere in sight.  Nor did I ever see his son
or</B>
<P><B>the mustard he was supposedly "peddling".</B>
<P>
<P><B>I always found this very strange.  This happened in the mid-80`s and
I</B>
<P><B>had never heard of anybody "peddling mustard" door to door.  Actually,
I</B>
<P><B>had never heard of anybody "peddling" anything.  That was not a word</B>
<P><B>commonly used for selling at the time (we used the word selling).</B>
<P><B>Peddling was an antiquated term where I was living.  I recently told</B>
<P><B>this story to a friend and he came up with a conclusion that fit this</B>
<P><B>story.  He thought it was an apparition and he was from the
Depression</B>
<P><B>Era.  When he told me this, it just clicked.  "YES", I thought.  That</B>
<P><B>was how I would of described the Mustard Peddlar.</B>
<P><B>Well, there it is, the story that has made me the butt of many jokes</B>
<P><B>during my teenage years, the story that has made some think I either
had</B>
<P><B>a vivid imagination or was in need of a psychiarist.  You be the
judge,</B>
<P><B>but, don`t judge too harshly.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=room>The Basement Room </A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:ajstokes@mindspring.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> I moved with my parents to our house in GA in 1991 and</B>
<P><B>experienced nothing out of the ordinary for 3 years until we finished
the</B>
<P><B>stud walls in the basement and I took that as my room.</B>
<P><B> Before long I began having strange experiences in that</B>
<P><B>room. One morning I woke up to see a small girl (9-10yrs) sitting</B>
<P><B>on the love seat I had pushed under my window. She was looking toward</B>
<P><B>my bed and was dressed in a fashion I associate with the late 19th
century.</B>
<P><B>I stared for several seconds then rubbed my eyes, and when I looked
again</B>
<P><B>she was gone.</B>
<P><B> About 2 weeks later the same thing happened, only this</B>
<P><B>time the same girl was joined by a young boy of about the same age
and</B>
<P><B>dress. She was looking over at me again (the love seat was
perpendicular</B>
<P><B>to the bed) but he was staring straight ahead at my bookcase on the
opposite</B>
<P><B>wall. Both had very solemn, but not really dour or unhappy
expressions</B>
<P><B>on their faces.</B>
<P><B> Another time, when I had just turned out the light to</B>
<P><B>go to bed, a very deep voice called my name from the direction of</B>
<P><B>the bookcase It was definitely inside the room and loud. Just</B>
<P><B>to be sure though, I went out into the rest of the basement to see
if anyone</B>
<P><B>was out there (after turning on all the lights of course!) I was</B>
<P><B>alone.</B>
<P><B> One night I felt my cat jump up on the bed at my feet</B>
<P><B>and said "Hello, Fuzz" before I realized that I had closed and locked
all</B>
<P><B>3 doors to my room and was alone in there. When I turned on the light</B>
<P><B>there was nothing on the bed, but I could still feel the weight.</B>
<P><B> Also, my fiancee at the time and I were sitting on the</B>
<P><B>foot of the bed watching the tv on my dresser when we heard scraping
noise</B>
<P><B>behind us. We turned just in time to see all of the things that I</B>
<P><B>kept on the headboard jump off to land on the bed, except the picture
of</B>
<P><B>my fiancee - it landed a good 3' from the bed, face down on the
concrete</B>
<P><B>floor.</B>
<P><B> Other than the one incidence with the voice, I have never</B>
<P><B>felt threatened down there, and that also the only auditory
experience.</B>
<P><B>However, many of my friends get a bad feeling going there, and won't
go</B>
<P><B>down alone.</B>
<P><B> The happenings seem to be confined to that one room and</B>
<P><B>there appears to be some connection with the bookcase, but if there
is</B>
<P><B>I don't get it. It is a very modern model bought when I moved into</B>
<P><B>that room, and there are no occult books in there except some Stephen
King</B>
<P><B>and Anne Rice.</B>
<P><B> Any professional feedback would be appreciated.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My story is about not 1 but 3 ghosts that reside in our house.we have
pictures</B>
<P><B>of 2 of them taken in the 1997 october snowstorm.There is a small boy
who</B>
<P><B>visits my daughter Brittany fairly frequently.She says he makes her
angry</B>
<P><B>because he always wants to tell her things at bedtime.Then we have
an adult</B>
<P><B>female who goes around and checks on everyone in the middle of the
night.This</B>
<P><B>has unnerved my son so much he will not sleep downstairs ever again.He
said he</B>
<P><B>felt her checking his feet and made sure his covers were pulled up.Then
we</B>
<P><B>have a mischievious male ghost who I believe likes to play catch.There
have</B>
<P><B>been at least 3 times he has thrown something at me or my sisters to
get our</B>
<P><B>attention.He has also made himself known to my brothers.For many years
my</B>
<P><B>brothers had a beer can collection going.one night they were in the
model</B>
<P><B>room(where the can collection was)working on their models when they
felt his</B>
<P><B>hand come down in a swooshing motion and hit the table knocking down
the beer</B>
<P><B>can collection.Now my mother had her own experience with one of the
ghosts</B>
<P><B>many years ago when her and my dad were fighting.She had decided to
sleep</B>
<P><B>downstairs on the couch.She was wakened suddenly by what she described
as hot</B>
<P><B>breath on her face.Well she thought my dad had come to apologize.when
she</B>
<P><B>looked around there was no one there.So then she thought it must be
the cat we</B>
<P><B>had.That too was nowhere to be seen.By this time she was really getting
scared</B>
<P><B>and moved to leave the room.The ghost moved her from the room to the
bottom</B>
<P><B>step in an instant.She didn't hesitate to look back she ran all the
way up the</B>
<P><B>stairs.This is only a small portion of my experiences with ghosts.Thank
you</B>
<P><B>for letting me share with you. 		  	   	 	 	  </B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I just want to say that I love this page and </B>
<P><B>thank you for letting us share our stories. I have always had an interest
</B>
<P><B>in the paranormal, so when my boyfriend told me what happened to his
</B>
<P><B>grandmother, I was extremely fascinated.I love this story because it
is so nice and </B>
<P><B>there is nothing frightening or bad about it. My boyfriend's grandfather
</B>
<P><B>died almost ten years ago when my boyfriend was about 13 or 14. I never
</B>
<P><B>met his grandfather, but his grandmother is a wonderful woman. After
his </B>
<P><B>grandfather's death, strange things ocurred. A little while after the
</B>
<P><B>death, his grandmother was redoing the den. She wanted to put new </B>
<P><B>wallpaper up. After putting the wallpaper up, she left for a little
while </B>
<P><B>to let it dry. When she came back into the room, all of the wallpaper
was </B>
<P><B>on the floor. I'm not sure why. I think when his grandfather was </B>
<P><B>sick he spent a lot of time in the den, but I'm not sure exactly why
the den was </B>
<P><B>important. Well, I didn't think that was too weird, but it gets </B>
<P><B>better. His grandmother has a picture of her and her husband together
</B>
<P><B>hanging by her stairs. One day she noticed a small red dot between
their </B>
<P><B>heads in the picture. Slowly, over time, this dot grew to a larger,
</B>
<P><B>heart-shaped thing between their heads. My boyfriend and his grandmother
</B>
<P><B>took the picture out of the frame to check it to see if something had
happened </B>
<P><B>to it, but they couldn't see anything wrong with it. The texture of
the </B>
<P><B>picture was the same, and it didn't appear to be a stain since the
surface was </B>
<P><B>no different. There didn't appear to be anything wrong with the </B>
<P><B>picture. I have seen this picture with my own eyes. The best part is
</B>
<P><B>the last part I will tell. His grandmother complained of waking up
in the </B>
<P><B>middle of the night because it felt like someone was touching her.
She </B>
<P><B>also said sometimes it looked like someone was sitting on the bed because
she </B>
<P><B>could see the indentation on her sheets, but no one was there. So one
</B>
<P><B>night my boyfriend slept over her house. He slept in a bedroom right
</B>
<P><B>across from hers. They agreed that if she screamed he should come into
her </B>
<P><B>room right away. Well, during the night he heard her scream. He came
</B>
<P><B>running in the room. He didn't see anything, but she complained of
feeling </B>
<P><B>someone touch her again. He turned on the light, and in the middle
of her </B>
<P><B>floor was a crucifix. The only problem was that she had never seen
this </B>
<P><B>particular crucifix before She had no idea where it came from. So </B>
<P><B>to this day she has it hanging on her bedroom wall. It is beautiful.
</B>
<P><B>I think it is her dead husband's way of letting her know he is watching
over her </B>
<P><B>and still loves her.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=doors>My Grandfather Closes the Doors</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  jdavis@MNSi.Net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I have a story to tell you about my deceased </B>
<P><B>grandfather.He died in November 1996. We were all very depressed about
his </B>
<P><B>passing. A few days after we found out he had died, we heard doors
gently </B>
<P><B>closing, things being rearranged, things like that. Well my grandfather
</B>
<P><B>always shut the doors quietly as not to disturb anyone. He was also
a neat </B>
<P><B>freak. If something was out of order he would rearrange it until it
suited to </B>
<P><B>his liking. One night when I was trying to fall asleep, I heard someone
</B>
<P><B>rearranging cups in the cupboards. My room faced the kitchen so if
I looked at </B>
<P><B>the end of my bed..I could see anything that happened in the kitchen.Well
</B>
<P><B>when I heard this I was going to tell the person to be a little more
quiet so I </B>
<P><B>could sleep. I crawled down to the end of my bed. and I looked around
the </B>
<P><B>corner of my door out towards the kitchen. There was no one in the
kitchen and </B>
<P><B>all the cupboard doors were shut. I thought this was so weird. </B>
<P><B>I walked into the kitchen to look around at what happened. I looked
in the glass </B>
<P><B>cupboard, and all of the coffee mugs were turned around so that the
handles were </B>
<P><B>all facing left..My family always puts the handles towards the right.
But when </B>
<P><B>my grandfather was alive he always grabbed the cup with his left </B>
<P><B>hand. The next day I did a </B>
<P><B>test. I put some things in dissaray so he could fix them. Just to see
if </B>
<P><B>it worked.. That night I heard the same rummaging again, I looked at
the </B>
<P><B>objects..and they were arranged alphabetically.  My grandfather was
also very </B>
<P><B>careful about how we closed the doors in the house and not to slam
them or leave </B>
<P><B>them open. Well one day I was going out to the garage to get something
to </B>
<P><B>drink. I knew I was all by myself...and the weather was really nice
and hot and </B>
<P><B>there was no wind, so I left the door wide open. When I opened up the
fridge </B>
<P><B>door I heard a creaking sound, I turned around just as I saw the door
to </B>
<P><B>the garage slowly closing and when it shut it click softly. I was so
</B>
<P><B>scared and I didn't know what to do. I went into the house and thought
nothing </B>
<P><B>of it. But as I walked into the house I felt very cold as I walked
through </B>
<P><B>the doorway, like something very cold had been standing there moments
</B>
<P><B>before.That </B>
<P><B>night I tried to sleep again. I dreamt about a grandfather clock that
he used to </B>
<P><B>have. Every time the clock struck midnight in my dream...my grandfather
would </B>
<P><B>appear in my room trying to talk to me. I was kinda scared after it
</B>
<P><B>happened 2 times. But the third night I felt so confident. I tried
to talk </B>
<P><B>back to him. He told me he was ok and was watching out for me. He </B>
<P><B>said he missed me and can't wait to meet up with me again. I said I
missed </B>
<P><B>and loved him very much.. Then in a cloud of smoke he dissappeared.
I woke </B>
<P><B>up crying.. to this day I will not forget him.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  jumbojac@gte.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My family and I are originaly from San Diego so naturally I have been
in</B>
<P><B>and experienced some of the strange anomalies that occur in that
house</B>
<P><B>including having an super 8 video of what I can only explain as some
one</B>
<P><B>or something tugging on the curtain between the upstair bedrooms
closet</B>
<P><B>that connects the two. This area became a focus for me because of an</B>
<P><B>incident that happened to my mother,grandmother and my since departed</B>
<P><B>grandfather. When they were on a guided tour of the house my
grandmother</B>
<P><B>and mother experienced a cold breeze on the staircase(of which I am
sure</B>
<P><B>you are familiar with the background story on this.)Anyways, they</B>
<P><B>continued on the tour at first they really didn't notice anything.
When</B>
<P><B>they returned downstairs the tour guide told them that Mrs. Whaley
was</B>
<P><B>being very active that day and did they notice her tugging on the</B>
<P><B>curtains of the closet. My mother and grandmother proceeded to go up</B>
<P><B>stairs  and sure enough the curtains were moving like somebody was</B>
<P><B>gently pulling on them. My mother naturally being kind of excited by
this</B>
<P><B>went down and proceeded to get my grandfather(who insisted that there</B>
<P><B>was no such thing as ghosts)anyways they went upstairs and the
curtains</B>
<P><B>were not moving at all. My grandfather proceeded to turn around and
very</B>
<P><B>sternly tell my mother that there was no such things as gho... at
this</B>
<P><B>point the curtains shook quite violently. Any ways my encounter with
this</B>
<P><B>same area came at Easter time last year my son and I were in the
house</B>
<P><B>and we struck up a conversation with one of the volunteers and I told
her</B>
<P><B>the story of my families encounters. A man carrying a portable tape</B>
<P><B>recorder introduced himself as someone who was writing about the
house</B>
<P><B>and wanted to record my story because he thought it might be
interesting</B>
<P><B>for his book. Anyways this occurred in the room where my family had</B>
<P><B>previously had the experience. I proceeded to tell him the story and
when</B>
<P><B>I came to the point of the curtain moving I just happened to glance
in</B>
<P><B>the direction of the curtain to which I said"just like now!"at that</B>
<P><B>point I proceeded to film the movement and then the windows in either</B>
<P><B>room to show that they were not open.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=watches>My Grampa Watches</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  squashywoman@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello.  I have visited your page many times to read the stories</B>
<P><B>people have put about their encounters with ghosts and spirits.  My</B>
<P><B>stories are not much compared to other stories people have. But they</B>
<P><B>really happend.  The first one I have to tell you is one that happend</B>
<P><B>to me and my sister a few years back. We live in a small house and
I</B>
<P><B>was only about 6 years old. We both awoke in the night to the sound
of</B>
<P><B>a rocking chair in our living room rocking really fast.  We would</B>
<P><B>sleep with our door half open and so my older sis looked out and saw</B>
<P><B>it rocking! There was no one on it though! We both started to shake</B>
<P><B>and I was asking her what was out there.  WE both clung to eachother</B>
<P><B>and we could still hear the chair rocking for about 10 minutes at the</B>
<P><B>same pace as earlier! Finally we became tired again and went to
sleep.</B>
<P><B> The next morning we asked out mom about it and she tried to make it</B>
<P><B>so we wouldn't be scared and she said that our dad was up and sitting</B>
<P><B>on the chair rocking! But that is impossible since we could not see</B>
<P><B>any one on the chair and it kept up a steady pace for that long of
a</B>
<P><B>time.</B>
<P><B>  The next story I am going to tell you is about the time just after</B>
<P><B>my grampa died.  My grandma got up one night to go to the washroom.
</B>
<P><B>After she went she walked into the kitchen for a drink of water! She</B>
<P><B>lived in a trailer so the living room was right in the open to the</B>
<P><B>kitchen!  She got a glass from the cuboard and turned around to fill</B>
<P><B>it when she saw what looked like my grampa sitting on his favorite</B>
<P><B>chair!  She thought she was seeing things so she turned around and</B>
<P><B>filled her glass! But when she looked around he was still there. He</B>
<P><B>was saying something and it sounded like he was saying. Its ok I am
ok</B>
<P><B>now. He died of lung cancer and was really ill.</B>
<P><B>  Another time was still dealing with my same grampa.  Only this one</B>
<P><B>has to deal with my Aunty. My Aunty is married to a carpenter and he</B>
<P><B>travels a long ways away from home for a long period of time. My
aunty</B>
<P><B>has a sickness and she gets anxiety attacks and stuff like that and</B>
<P><B>headaches and she gets really sick at night!  One night she woke up</B>
<P><B>and seen a glowing in the room. She was sick and she was having</B>
<P><B>problems breathing.  She all of a sudden seen our grampa and he was</B>
<P><B>standing near the door.  He was moving his mouth but she couldn't
hear</B>
<P><B>anything. My Aunty use to remeber how he would always be there for
her</B>
<P><B>whenever she was sick.  After a few minutes she began to feel better</B>
<P><B>and soon went back to sleep.  </B>
<P><B>These aren't really anything compared to what I have heard.  But I</B>
<P><B>thought it was kind of weird.  My grampa has also been seen by my mom</B>
<P><B>late at night and my other aunties.  I believe he is watching over
all</B>
<P><B>of his daughters and wife. </B>

<P><B>this part of the country, and their is alot a wide open spaces.  And
alot</B>
<P><B>of ghost stories.  I never thought I would ever encounter a ghost or
even</B>
<P><B>think of seeing one.  But this night changed everything.  We were on
a</B>
<P><B>deserted strech of road, not a town or person in sight.  The lights
in the</B>
<P><B>bus were turned out and is was pitch dark outside.  I glanced out of
my</B>
<P><B>window and saw something on the side of the road, in a heart beat it
was</B>
<P><B>gone.  I though nothing of it, it was probably a road sign or something.
 I</B>
<P><B>shook it of and tried to get some sleep.  When I looked out, for a
split</B>
<P><B>second.  I saw two people walking down the road.  A man and a women
hand in</B>
<P><B>hand.  I sat up, quite shook up.  But once again I dismissed it as
my mind</B>
<P><B>playing tricks on me.  But for the third time I look out, and I saw
them</B>
<P><B>again!  Hand in hand walking, I could see them more clearly now, it
was an</B>
<P><B>older coupple.  I blinked and they were gone.</B>
<P><B>This is my story, I dont know if anyone will believe it, but feel free
to</B>
<P><B>put it on your page.  Thank you.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Hello! I really enjoy reading the experiences on your page.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In any case....</B>
<P><B>I have a few stories I would like to share.</B>
<P><B>I grew up on a farm on the Southern end of Vancouver Island, Canada.
For</B>
<P><B>thousands of years this area has been the home of the West Coast Haida
</B>
<P><B>Indians. One summer afternoon 10 years ago, my father was working with
</B>
<P><B>the tractor behind our barn digging up the soil for some reason or</B>
<P><B>another, when the sunlight glinted of an object buried in the dirt.
My</B>
<P><B>dad hopped down to investigate and discovered the object was a  black
</B>
<P><B>stone spearhead in rather good condition considering it's age.</B>
<P><B>He brought in the house to show my mother, sister and I and placed
it in</B>
<P><B>a shallow box on top of our side board to protect it from the curious
</B>
<P><B>hands of a 9 and 7 year old. A few days later my mum and I were at
home </B>
<P><B>together alone (I think I was sick)my dad being at work and my sister
at</B>
<P><B>school. Suddenly we heard a crash from the sideboard. The box and </B>
<P><B>spearhead had fallen off the top self. This was a little odd
considering</B>
<P><B>my father had pushed it a good 4 inches away from the edge. The box
and </B>
<P><B>spearhead have been kept in the cupboard since.</B>
<P><B>During the Christmas of 1997 my family and I went to Louisiana</B>
<P><B>to visit friends. When in Louisiana you must go and visit the</B>
<P><B>plantation</B> <B>houses in the area which we did. First my family
went to Oak Alley</B>
<P><B>plantation house (where they filmed the opening scene on "Interview</B>
<P><B>with the Vampire") built in 1839. As we followed the tour guide upstairs
to </B>
<P><B>the bedrooms, both my mum and I felt a strong presence in the master
</B>
<P><B>bedroom; not evil nor good but rather sad. Later in the tour we learned
</B>
<P><B>that the upstairs is haunted by the ghost of what appears to be an
</B>
<P><B>unidentified young woman with long brown hair (you can buy a photo
of</B>
<P><B>her in the gift shop). She has been known to move about objects
upstairs</B>
<P><B>but she has never harmed anyone. Sometimes, if you stand on the lawn</B>
<P><B>outside the bedroom window, you can see her looking out at you.</B>
<P><B>Anyway, moving on.....</B>
<P><B>Next we went to Nottoway Plantation house in Baton Rouge. This house
was</B>
<P><B>not quite as old as Oak Alley but much grander. Once again we were
</B>
<P><B>upstairs and I felt there was someone still there as well. The family
</B>
<P><B>that lived there during the Civil War, I believed had 8 children (6
</B>
<P><B>daughters &amp; 2 sons). In the bottom level of the house there are
a few</B>
<P><B>artifacts from the Civil War including a bayonette, bullets and a</B>
<P><B>sword.</B>
<P><B>Also amoung these items is a picture of the family's 17-year-old son
who</B>
<P><B>fought and died in the Civil War, so it may be his ghost who walks
the</B>
<P><B>halls of the house.</B>
<P><B>That evening when we were back at our friends house and in bed I was</B>
<P><B>sure I felt the presence of the young soldier in my bedroom with me.
I</B>
<P><B>didn't feel scared, but protected as if he were watching over me as
I slept.</B>
<P><B>Or perhaps it was the romantic fancies of a 17-year-old girls' mind?</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=hotel>Hotel in England</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  karen21@home.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 16 I went to Europe with a program with the school
district.</B>
<P><B>The trip ended in London, England. Although I wasn't around to bear</B>
<P><B>witness to them, two different groups of people heard different</B>
<P><B>hauntings; one on the top floor, and one on the very bottom. This
hotel</B>
<P><B>was very old, and most every step would creak. The next night, there
was</B>
<P><B>a knocking on the door, but no creaks. We found no one was there.
This</B>
<P><B>happened two more times that night. We also found a room with an open</B>
<P><B>door and the television was on; it was on in that there was sound
coming</B>
<P><B>from it, but no picture on the screen. The hall on the top floor
would</B>
<P><B>creak when no one else was around, and sounds would come from inside
the</B>
<P><B>walls. One girl claimed to have seen a figure disappear. Two others
said</B>
<P><B>they saw its face suspended in the air. Different parts of the hotel</B>
<P><B>would feel cooler than others. On the floor below us, two others
claimed</B>
<P><B>the television would suddenly turn on. I was in this hotel, and though
I</B>
<P><B>didn't witness everything, I did see the empty television room, feel
the</B>
<P><B>cool air, and hear the knockings on the door, and sounds in the hall.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=haunted>My Haunted House</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  NM1RT@prodigy.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>When I was growing up I have had several experiences which led </B>
<P><B>me to believe the house was haunted.The first, I was about 6 years
</B>
<P><B>old. I was lying in bed just about to fall asleep when I heard what
I </B>
<P><B>thought was laughing. I turned over to tell my sister to be quiet when
I </B>
<P><B>saw a black form floating beside my bed. My sister was sound asleep.
</B>
<P><B>This form had no legs that I could see. It did have a smile on what
I call </B>
<P><B>Its face. The next encounter did not happen until I was 16. I was </B>
<P><B>coming home late one night and came face to face with this </B>
<P><B>thing. It was the same thing I saw when I was 6 only this time there
was </B>
<P><B>no smile. After an indescernable amount of time I ran to my room. I
</B>
<P><B>have had several encounters with this thing throughout my teen years
and began </B>
<P><B>calling it Paul Don't ask me why because I dont know </B>
<P><B>myself. My sister and brothers claim they have never saw it but one
</B>
<P><B>brother says he has had haunting experiences such as things floating
in his </B>
<P><B>room. My mother says she knows the house was haunted but she refused
to </B>
<P><B>give any examples. I know this thing was not harmful because nothing
</B>
<P><B>harmful ever happened. I also came to feel that this thing was protective
</B>
<P><B>of us because I never felt alone or afraid in the house when I was
alone. </B>
<P><B>When ever something was going to happen we were given warning signs
such as </B>
<P><B>popping noises on the stove that we found out had a gas leak and </B>
<P><B>uneasy feelings using the garbage disposal that checked out to have
a bare wire </B>
<P><B>that an electrician said could have caused a fire. This is my story,
hope </B>
<P><B>it wasnt too long.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  ttyler1@herald-leader.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My father died in Las Vegas in 1993. The youngest of his five
children,</B>
<P><B>I was the first one to make it out to Vegas for his funeral. (He was</B>
<P><B>cremated.) I got there on a Wednesday. Thursday morning, one of my</B>
<P><B>mother's friends came over to our house with some soda and other
things</B>
<P><B>for us. I ran out of the house to help her unload her car. Out of the</B>
<P><B>corner of my eye, I saw my father standing beside the house. He had
his</B>
<P><B>right hand on his hip and held his left hand in mid-air, as if he
were</B>
<P><B>going to take a puff of a cigarette (ironic, because he died of lung</B>
<P><B>cancer) or as if he wanted to wave at or beckon to me. It was only
a few</B>
<P><B>seconds, but a whole jumble of thoughts ran through my mind: "He's
going</B>
<P><B>to say something to me! I don't want to hear it!" So I looked away,
and</B>
<P><B>when I looked back, he was gone. I regret not stopping to hear what
he</B>
<P><B>had to say to me. My brother says he chose me to say good-bye to.
This</B>
<P><B>was the first time I've ever seen a ghost. I'm waiting to see my
mother,</B>
<P><B>who died in May 1998. A footnote: When I saw him, I noticed that my</B>
<P><B>father was wearing his favorite khaki pants and a gold-and-white
striped</B>
<P><B>shirt. That afternoon, I went to my father's office to work on the</B>
<P><B>program for the memorial service. His boss gave me a picture of my</B>
<P><B>father. In it, he was wearing that gold-and-white striped shirt.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=childhood>Childhood Poltergeist</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: zygant@tdsecurities.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>From the time I was 4, until I was about 16, my grandparents lived
in a</B>
<P><B>house on Cloverdale road that had a poltergeist in it.  I lived with
them</B>
<P><B>for the first four years, then moved out with my mother, but even after
we</B>
<P><B>moved I would spend weekends or holidays at my grandparents house.
 The</B>
<P><B>happenings were noticed by everyone in the family, my grandfather was
the</B>
<P><B>only one who never said anything was out of the ordinary.  He's a
staunch</B>
<P><B>man of God and kept pictures of Jesus around, and he prayed daily,
to bless</B>
<P><B>our house, and everyone in it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The house had a sunroom that was added on the second floor, over the
front</B>
<P><B>porch, this became my room.  The wall between my bedroom and the
master</B>
<P><B>bedroom (where my mother slept) was brick, and had two small windows
on</B>
<P><B>either side of the door.  I had to walk through her room to get to
the</B>
<P><B>upstairs hall, where there was a door leading to the middle room
(always</B>
<P><B>dark, because the only window was 2 feet from the house next door),
and the</B>
<P><B>back of the upstairs had a small kitchen over top of the one on the
first</B>
<P><B>floor, and a bathroom at the very back over top of my grandparents
room on</B>
<P><B>the first floor.  The downstairs had a living/dining combination that
was</B>
<P><B>curtained off, the front room was a bedroom, the middle the dining
room,</B>
<P><B>and stairs to the basement went down at the doorway to the kitchen,
(beyond</B>
<P><B>was my grandparents room, as I mentioned).</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandparents, my mother, my aunts and myself all lived there at
once.</B>
<P><B>My aunts were teenagers, and experimenting with the occult and spirit</B>
<P><B>invocations- I really think this had a lot to do with everything. 
At their</B>
<P><B>age, they couldn't have understood the consequences of what they were</B>
<P><B>asking.</B>
<P>
<P><B>You could clearly hear footsteps in the middle bedroom, even during
the</B>
<P><B>day, and then find out later that my aunt wasn't home.  So many things
got</B>
<P><B>moved around in Susan's middle room, that she put a lock on her door.
 But</B>
<P><B>it wasn't any of us.  We heard walking, someone laying down heavily
on the</B>
<P><B>bed, drawers opening and closing, the closet opening and closing- not
loud</B>
<P><B>or frightening, just the normal noises Susan would have made if she
was</B>
<P><B>there.  Many times, when I was very young, I'd scamper up the stairs,</B>
<P><B>convinced she was there, and wanting to play with her, and when I got
there</B>
<P><B>the door would be locked and noone would answer me when I knocked.
 Once I</B>
<P><B>even saw that the light was on in her room, it was shining around the
door.</B>
<P><B>I called to her, and tried to open it, but it went out and the noises</B>
<P><B>stopped, my scalp would tingle with fear, and I'd run crying to my</B>
<P><B>grandmother and tell her what happened.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Once, when I was about 5 or 6, I got up to go to the bathroom in the
middle</B>
<P><B>of the night, my room was awash with streetlamp light, but my mothers
(with</B>
<P><B>no other windows) was very dark, I had to go slowly even though I was
dying</B>
<P><B>to goto the bathroom, because I didn't want to crash into something
and wake her up.</B>
<P><B>When I got there, I was just flushing and was suddenly possessed (no
pun</B>
<P><B>intended) with the most abject horror for no apparent reason, I
screamed</B>
<P><B>and screamed and screamed, I ran all the way from the bathroom past
my</B>
<P><B>mother who was struggling to get up, into my room and under my blankets,
I</B>
<P><B>was trembling and pale and shaking.  It woke up the whole house, and
it</B>
<P><B>took me hours to calm down and sleep, with the light on.  I never knew
what</B>
<P><B>had set me off, just blind panic.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Our pots and pans could be heard falling out of the cupboards, and
when</B>
<P><B>you'd go check, everything would be in place, except maybe one thing,
and</B>
<P><B>that would turn up days or weeks later.  My mother saw a "black
shadow</B>
<P><B>about 2-3 feet high", at the foot of her bed when she'd wake up in
the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night.   One day it waited until she was awake, then
slowly,</B>
<P><B>deliberately came around the side of the bed and advanced towards her
head,</B>
<P><B>she prayed fervently while it just stayed there, then mysteriously
it faded</B>
<P><B>away.  But it would always come back another night.  She was the only
one</B>
<P><B>who saw anything.  The rest of us just heard disturbances.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was playing with my toys one sunny day, in my room, I was about 7
at the</B>
<P><B>time.  I picked up a bunting-bag (sort of like a baby sleeper but like
a</B>
<P><B>gown sewed closed at the bottom instead of two legs, and also the ends
of</B>
<P><B>the sleeve are sewn closed, and it had a hood).  It was made of
flannel,</B>
<P><B>and had flowers on it.  I loved putting my baby dolls in it, it fit
the</B>
<P><B>ones that were about 12" high.  I had a doll prepared to put in it,
and</B>
<P><B>reached for the flannel bag on the floor next to me, then I shrieked
and</B>
<P><B>jumped up, flinging it away from me.  I could feel there was
something</B>
<P><B>(felt like a garter snake, or two) writhing inside of it, and making
a</B>
<P><B>buzzing noise like the world's biggest housefly or bee.  I stared at
it in</B>
<P><B>horror as it lay on the floor, and the writhing could be seen.  Then
the</B>
<P><B>noise died down, and as it did so, the shapes quit squirming, and
went</B>
<P><B>flat.  I was screaming for help.  My mother and aunt came upstairs,
and I</B>
<P><B>told them what happened.  I was sobbing so hard they could barely</B>
<P><B>understand me.  They picked it up (even though I screamed and begged
them</B>
<P><B>not to) and looked inside, there was nothing.  The only way out, if</B>
<P><B>something was in there was through the neckhole and it was laying face
up a</B>
<P><B>couple of feet from me, and I had not taken my eyes off it for
anything.</B>
<P><B>They searched the room and found nothing.  They said I imagined it,
and</B>
<P><B>took me downstairs to have juice to drink.  I swear I never played
with it</B>
<P><B>ever again.  I put that thing in the bottom of a box and left a pile
of</B>
<P><B>heavy toys on top of it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The house still stands, and when we all left none of those things
ever</B>
<P><B>followed us, I wonder what else has happened there, over the last
twenty</B>
<P><B>years?</B>
<P><HR>
<H3><B><A NAME=path>The Haunted Path</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  name withheld by request</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>The story I am about to relay was told to me by a very reliable
friend</B>
<P><B>during my years in college.  I had no reason to question the</B>
<P><B>authenticity of his story since I knew him to be a very "level
headed"</B>
<P><B>man and was not given to "ghosts and goblin stories".  </B>
<P>
<P><B>It appears that his grandfather lived in an old home out in the
lonely</B>
<P><B>countryside of North Carolina during the 30's and 40's.  He was a
farmer</B>
<P><B>by trade and a very religious man.  He lived there some years alone,
his</B>
<P><B>wife having died of an unusual sickness.  I had occasion to visit the</B>
<P><B>area myself and if you go to this area of North Carolina today you
will</B>
<P><B>still find many cousins and aunts and uncles living very near one</B>
<P><B>another.  It was the same way during his grandfathers time where he</B>
<P><B>lived very near to his son (my friends father).  In fact the homes
were</B>
<P><B>only 2 miles apart and connected via a dark path that wound through
a</B>
<P><B>gloomy forest through which the relatives often traveled on visits
back</B>
<P><B>and forth.  It was always the goal to leave well before sunset. Lamp
oil</B>
<P><B>was a precious commodity before and during the war years (W.W.II) and</B>
<P><B>one could not waste it on long trips in the dark.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On this particular occasion, my friends grandfather went to visit the</B>
<P><B>relatives on the other side of the forest.  It was Thanksgiving time
and</B>
<P><B>the trees had shed most of their leaves going into winter and there
was</B>
<P><B>a chill in the air.  The family had a joyous time together feasting
on</B>
<P><B>turkey and all the trimmings.  Grandfather was deeply engrossed in
the</B>
<P><B>family time and no one noticed the sun starting to dip low on the</B>
<P><B>horizon - in fact too low for the safe journey back through the
forest.</B>
<P><B>Even though members of the family pleaded with him to stay the night,</B>
<P><B>grandfather shrugged them off, "I have to start out early tomorrow</B>
<P><B>morning for town, my house is closer, I'll be alright."  He departed</B>
<P><B>just as the sun disappeared behind the horizon and everything was
bathed</B>
<P><B>in the misty light of twilight.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I said before, Grandfather was a very religious man and wasn't in
the</B>
<P><B>least bit intimidated by ghosts and ghouls.  So the trek back through</B>
<P><B>the forest, although very dark without a lamp, didn't even cross his</B>
<P><B>mind as being risky.  It was a waning moon that evening and cloudy,
so</B>
<P><B>there was very little light, and under the eaves of the forest it was</B>
<P><B>even darker.  He told his grandson later that even though he knew the</B>
<P><B>trail well he found himself thrashing around in underbrush on several</B>
<P><B>occasions.  He even miscalculated the stream that crossed the path</B>
<P><B>around halfway through the forest and got his feet soaking wet.  It
had</B>
<P><B>rained the night before so the trail itself was muddy and his feet</B>
<P><B>started getting heavy from the mud.  It was at about this point in
the</B>
<P><B>trail that he "felt" something.  As if something were following him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Never having been on the trail after dark he explained it away as his</B>
<P><B>"imagination".  Perhaps another 50 yards down the dark trail (as he</B>
<P><B>recalled) he heard something behind him splash through the creek he
had</B>
<P><B>just crossed only moments before.  "I didn't know what to think of
that,</B>
<P><B>maybe a deer or something that was spooked back down the trail by his</B>
<P><B>passing", he later told his grandson.  It sounded like it was in a
big</B>
<P><B>hurry whatever it was.  Perhaps it was the uncertainty derived from
the</B>
<P><B>extreme darkness, maybe it WAS his imagination, but when he heard a
twig</B>
<P><B>snap no more than 20 yards behind him only seconds later, he new it
was</B>
<P><B>time to make tracks.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>His grandfather was in his early forties at the time and was in</B>
<P><B>excellent physical condition (like many farmers from years of working</B>
<P><B>with their hands).  From his estimation he was only a half mile from</B>
<P><B>home when he had started running (more of a jog than anything - as
he</B>
<P><B>recalled).  The mud made it tricky work and his feet were pretty
heavy</B>
<P><B>with the thickness of mud clinging to them.  But when he broke from
the</B>
<P><B>trees and saw the shadow of the house around 100 yards away, he
*heard*</B>
<P><B>what ever it was behind him give out a guttural growl as if it were</B>
<P><B>exerting itself by pouring on the steam for the final stretch.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>That was his queue to let loose with a full out run for his life -
mud</B>
<P><B>or no mud.  He didn't look back, but heard the beastly thing behind
him</B>
<P><B>chugging for air and crashing through the underbrush as it too broke</B>
<P><B>into the open.  He then thought it might be a cougar or panther
because</B>
<P><B>of the snarl, he didn't turn around to find out!  He made for the
back</B>
<P><B>door that was unlocked and at full speed, dove through the door.  The</B>
<P><B>door crashed open at the force of his huge frame.  He promptly
slammed</B>
<P><B>it shut with his foot and quickly locked it.  No sooner had he gotten
to</B>
<P><B>his feet and backed away from the door (perhaps 3 second time lapse)</B>
<P><B>when "something" hit the door - the force of which shook the house.
 The</B>
<P><B>center of the door bowed in and he heard the hinges creak under the</B>
<P><B>stress, but thankfully (as he was to recall later) it held solid. 
He</B>
<P><B>quickly reached for his shotgun and like many hearty folk of his era,</B>
<P><B>leapt at the window just next to the door and aimed his shotgun out</B>
<P><B>at... NOTHING!  There was nothing there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Immediately he went around the house to make sure all the doors and</B>
<P><B>windows were locked (of course they were all wide open).  But nothing</B>
<P><B>got in that he could find.  It didn't rain that night so the next</B>
<P><B>morning, before he went to town, he went to check out the tracks of
the</B>
<P><B>great beast that chased him.  To his surprise, and dismay, he found</B>
<P><B>none.  Nothing to verify his story - that he didn't imagine it.  Only</B>
<P><B>his word (which was significant since he grew up in an era where a
mans</B>
<P><B>word really WAS his bond).  He rarely told the story because he just</B>
<P><B>figured it was a panther or maybe a bear.  He did find it strange
that</B>
<P><B>between the time it took him to grab his shotgun and get to the
window</B>
<P><B>was less than a second and there was nothing there.  He couldn't see</B>
<P><B>anything racing off back toward the forest in the decreasing light.</B>
<P><B>What about footprints?  Certainly something that knocks down trees
and</B>
<P><B>crashes into doors with such force should leave tracks.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To this day it remains unexplained.</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>	I live in Spartanburg, SC I live fairly close to the Cowpens
Battlefield</B>
<P><B>area. I am going to tell you about one of the times I went there. A
couple of</B>
<P><B>weeks ago I visited the battlefield for a picnic. It was weird from
the start</B>
<P><B>because I swear I could no longer find the visitor's center. The asphalt
roads</B>
<P><B>had been replaced with dirt roads. In the clearing where concerts are
held was</B>
<P><B>all covered with trees and bushes. When I finally found my way to the
area</B>
<P><B>where the big Calvary battle was fought I began to feel an eerie presence
like</B>
<P><B>I was being watched. I turned around to find a bush shaking furiously.
From</B>
<P><B>the bush a big flash quickly followed by the sound of a loud bang erupted.
I</B>
<P><B>quickly turned to see who or what was shooting at. In the clearing
a good 50</B>
<P><B>yards away a blue Calvary rider surely American stood with a traditional
17th</B>
<P><B>century revolutionary uniform on. And before my eyes he vanished into
thin</B>
<P><B>air. I have not been back since.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  DOCJAYMES@JUNO.COM.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have experienced hauntings in almost every place I've ever lived
in.  </B>
<P><B>(That's probably because my mother never sees ghosts, but loves </B>
<P><B>old-fashioned houses!)</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first house I grew up in, was a single-level 2-bedroom with a </B>
<P><B>basement.  When you passed inside the front door, you came upon a </B>
<P><B>hallway with 4 doors -- first my parents' bedroom door, then the </B>
<P><B>bathroom door, then the basement door, then the door to the bedroom
that </B>
<P><B>I shared with my brother.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was little I was always the first one awake.  (How I wish I
had </B>
<P><B>that kind of energy now!)  I would walk into the hallway to go to the
</B>
<P><B>bathroom.  Once, I saw a carved wooden chair with big wheels, one on
</B>
<P><B>each side, sitting right outside my parents' bedroom.  Normally, I
would </B>
<P><B>have lost no time in climbing all over this new piece of furniture,
but </B>
<P><B>this one, for no apparent reason, made the hair stand up on the back
of </B>
<P><B>my neck.  I ran back into my room and slammed the door.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Later that day, I asked my father to please get rid of the big wooden
</B>
<P><B>chair in the hallway.  Thinking I was playing a game, he said there
</B>
<P><B>weren't any chairs in the hallway but if he ever saw one, he'd be sure
</B>
<P><B>to move it.  I didn't see the chair again for almost 6 years.  When
I </B>
<P><B>saw it the next time, it was sitting in the exact same place as before.
 </B>
<P><B>I was older now and wasn't quite so afraid, so I came closer.  The
chair </B>
<P><B>was battered and scarred this time.  Part of the back corner had been
</B>
<P><B>broken off, and the seat was yellowed.  It smelled like very old, musty
</B>
<P><B>leather.  I still couldn't bring myself to actually touch the chair,
but </B>
<P><B>I managed to go to the bathroom, anyway.  While I was brushing my teeth,
</B>
<P><B>I heard a metallic crash in the basement.  I figured my dad was </B>
<P><B>downstairs trying to fix the furnace again (it was October, after all),
</B>
<P><B>but that was odd, since I hadn't heard him go down there -- but maybe
he </B>
<P><B>was up before me.  When I came back out, the chair was gone.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I went to the refrigerator and poured myself some juice.  My mother
came </B>
<P><B>into the kitchen in her nightrobe, and I asked her if Dad had gotten
the </B>
<P><B>furnace fixed yet.  She said no, but he'd probably try again once he
got </B>
<P><B>out of bed.  I said he's already up, I heard him in the basement. 
She </B>
<P><B>told me, "You mean that loud noise?  I heard it too, it woke me up.
 </B>
<P><B>Your dad's still in bed.  Go downstairs, maybe a stray got into the
</B>
<P><B>basement last night." and I went.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The basement was very cold, colder than usual even for an October </B>
<P><B>morning.  I searched the entire area (not too difficult since it was
</B>
<P><B>just a big, concrete floor -- not much on it except for shelves of
</B>
<P><B>canned goods), but I didn't find any signs of an animal being there:
 no </B>
<P><B>droppings, claw marks, paw prints, or jars of food broken.  There was
no </B>
<P><B>animal smell, either.  I thought for a moment.  The crash I heard was
</B>
<P><B>too loud to be just any animal, unless something had been knocked over,
</B>
<P><B>and everything appeared to be in its usual place.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That wasn't the first time we had heard strange noises coming from
the </B>
<P><B>basement, either.  They normally happened around winter or late fall,
</B>
<P><B>and the noises always sounded like metal clanking -- like someone </B>
<P><B>banging a shovel against a wall.  The sounds would come at night or
</B>
<P><B>early morning, and one week they got so bad that we all had to move
into </B>
<P><B>the living room just to get some sleep!  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I didn't put two and two together until many years later, when I was
a </B>
<P><B>teenager.  Mother finally told me the story of how they had bought
the </B>
<P><B>house.  It had been cheap to buy because a man had fallen to his death
</B>
<P><B>down the basement stairs a few months prior to Dad buying the place.
 </B>
<P><B>The man was fairly wealthy, and had the house built (one story high)
to </B>
<P><B>his accomodate his special needs -- because he was in a wheelchair.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I told my mother about the chair I had seen in the hallway twice before
</B>
<P><B>("chair with wheels": I was too little to have seen a wheelchair) and
</B>
<P><B>she told me what our next-door neighbor had told her: that when the
man </B>
<P><B>had died, he was sitting in the hallway while his nurse ran a bath
for </B>
<P><B>him, and the basement door opened (or had been left open -- who knows?).
 </B>
<P><B>The man was a miser, according to neighbors, and probably didn't want
a </B>
<P><B>draft coming into the house, so he wheeled himself over to shut the
</B>
<P><B>door.  One of the wheels accidentally went over the edge, somehow,
and </B>
<P><B>the poor guy fell down the stairs and split his head open.  (There
were </B>
<P><B>still bloodstains at the bottom of the stairway!  My brother and I
had </B>
<P><B>always just assumed it was old red paint!)  The nurse called out for
him </B>
<P><B>to come and take his bath, and heard him flailing around downstairs,
</B>
<P><B>trying to get back  into his chair.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Mom and Dad never told me or my brother.  I guess they didn't want
us to </B>
<P><B>grow up nervous or jittery.  The ghost (if that's what it was) was
never </B>
<P><B>really mean.  I guess he just wanted his wheelchair back.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  gypsnjoeyd@webtv.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Hello! I would like to tell you of a strange thing that happened to
me.</B>
<P><B>It started with a dream that would not leave me alone. It was about
a</B>
<P><B>house that was important to me for some reason. I dreamt of it over
and</B>
<P><B>over seeing all of its different owners as they moved in and changed
the</B>
<P><B>houses layout. Parties they had and everyday things that were done</B>
<P><B>there. One early owner was an older female that did not like me being</B>
<P><B>there. I wondered about this house for years until I moved to my
recent</B>
<P><B>address and ran across the house on a drive. I was angry because they</B>
<P><B>had moved "my garden" and replaced it with a pool! I was surprised
by</B>
<P><B>this feeling! Why did I feel angry about that? I decided to talk with</B>
<P><B>the recent owners and  tell them of the remodeling I had seen and
about</B>
<P><B>the baby that was lost in the home early on. The owner was astonished</B>
<P><B>that everything I said was true and explaned to me the house was</B>
<P><B>haunted! I was surprised at this and wondered who was haunting this</B>
<P><B>place. Could it have been me ? Was I haunting them while I was
deaming?</B>
<P><B>Can this happen? Why was I drawn to this house? I assure you I had
never</B>
<P><B>visited the house in real time and am in awe as to what secret this</B>
<P><B>house holds for me. Could I be the woman who died in childbirth in
this</B>
<P><B>house over 100 yrs ago? Also, the woman who I spoke of earlier who
did</B>
<P><B>not want me in the house, she turned out to be the original owners</B>
<P><B>second wife. The first died in childbirth.</B>
<P><B>Please write back with any insight you might have on this subject.
I</B>
<P><B>have not dreamt of the house since finding it. Thank you.</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I don't think I need any help now , I sure wish</B>
<P><B>the help would have been there in 1974, we didn't know where to turn
at</B>
<P><B>the time. I thought you might be interested in what happened to us.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>The couple who rented the apt. to my daughter</B>
<P><B>were 80 plus yrs old. We told them about the lights going out at</B>
<P><B>different times and they couldn't figure it out.  So we never told
them</B>
<P><B>any thing else. </B>
<P>
<P><B>One time my 2 daughters and my 2 yr old grandson were sitting on the</B>
<P><B>floor and way back in the kitchen they suddenly started to hear a</B>
<P><B>strange sound. And my grandson said Tiger </B>
<P><B>Mommy Tiger. It was a growling sound. My Grandson was  scared and
jumped</B>
<P><B>up and made a bee line for the stairs. Then my daughters also jumped
up</B>
<P><B>and they left the house for the night . </B>
<P>
<P><B>Every other day or so they would here pots and pans falling out of
the</B>
<P><B>cupboards , but when they would go look nothing was out of order.</B>
<P><B>It was a very nice apt. very clean and pleasant looking. </B>
<P>
<P><B>It was getting close to xmas and she decided to move. She couldn't
take</B>
<P><B>it any more. Too scary. So I would go over in the day time and
thinking</B>
<P><B>nothing scary would happen then in day light, </B>
<P><B>I went over to pack some things up while she was at class. I started
to</B>
<P><B>grab some things off the shelf but I had a funny feeling that I
didn't</B>
<P><B>want to reach in the closed. And all of a sudden it sounded like a
100</B>
<P><B>footsteps in there, walking.</B>
<P><B>So I ran out of there an quick as I could and </B>
<P><B>refused to go back there by myself. </B>
<P>
<P><B>From then on we would go over at least 2 of us.</B>
<P><B>at a time. Then one of the last times I went over</B>
<P><B>I was standing waiting for my grandson to finish in the bathroom ,
and I</B>
<P><B>was afraid to stand with </B>
<P><B>my back to the hall for some reason . I kept thinking someone was
going</B>
<P><B>to touch me .</B>
<P><B>Sure enough I turned to ask my grandson if he was finished yet , and
it</B>
<P><B>felt like someones hand touched me on my left arm . I grabbed my</B>
<P><B>grandson and ran to the front room with my family and told them what</B>
<P><B>happened. So after that we pretty much stayed together and worked to
get</B>
<P><B>her move out of there. </B>
<P>
<P><B>A friend of my daughters knew the couple who lived in that apt.
before</B>
<P><B>her. and they got in touch with the woman and told her what hapened</B>
<P><B>there. She wanted to meet with my daughter because she had some scary</B>
<P><B>things happen to her..</B>
<P>
<P><B>Her husband had drowned in the Maumee River in Toledo Ohio. under</B>
<P><B>suspicious circumstances. the police were never able to prove it ,
but</B>
<P><B>thought he might have been murdered.</B>
<P>
<P><B>So his wife had a seance in the apt. where they lived. And she said
she</B>
<P><B>brought him there and he told her he was murdered.She had a big</B>
<P><B>insurance on him that he had taken out on himself. and when she went</B>
<P><B>home from work at night her house would be all messed up with </B>
<P><B>things tossed all around. She had to move away couldn't take it .</B>
<P>
<P><B>Over these past 24 yrs. we've had strange things happen. Spiritual</B>
<P><B>things.and such.</B>
<P><B>Seems to have settled down now.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But I thought you would be interested to hear our story . And all
that</B>
<P><B>I've have told you is true. There are no lies here. Let me know what
you</B>
<P><B>think. It's comforting to have someone to tell this stuff to . A lot
of</B>
<P><B>people think your nuts when you mention these things. So we pretty
much</B>
<P><B>keep it to ourselves. I'm interested to hear what you have to say
about</B>
<P><B>these things.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I think my house is haunted. I was really terrified, but after a year
I'm used</B>
<P><B>to it, for example me and my boyfriend have heard footsteps up and
down the</B>
<P><B>hall outside our bedroom. Sometimes it sounds like someone is checking
the doors </B>
<P><B>and windows, and one night me and my boyfriend had a fight and I went
to go stay </B>
<P><B>at a friend's house. When my boyfriend came home, he sat on the sofa
and started </B>
<P><B>dozing off. When all of a sudden there was a series of loud banging
up and down </B>
<P><B>the hall like someone was angry.  He jumped up and came ran out the
door and came </B>
<P><B>to my friends to ask me to come home. Another strange time my boyfriend
came home</B>
<P><B>for a few hours to take a nap. He called me at work, I was about 45
minutes away, we</B>
<P><B>talked for a few minutes. After we hung up he went into the bedroom
to lay down </B>
<P><B>when again all of a sudden it sounded like someone was putting dishes
away and </B>
<P><B>moving around.  So my boyfriend says he thought to himself "oh, Ivy's
home" after </B>
<P><B>about a minute he realized it could not have been me  because he just
got off the </B>
<P><B>phone with me and I was 45 minutes away. Alot of unexplained things
have happened.  </B>
<P><B>Sometimes when we've been in the house alone and sworn that we're not
alone even </B>
<P><B>when we are alone. Iit feels like someone is watching us. We've been
together in the</B>
<P><B>house and feel like we are being watched. I don't feel afraid anymore
 but now we are</B>
<P><B>moving out of this apartment and it may sound even stranger but you
can almost</B>
<P><B>feel a sad feeling like whatever is with us knows we are going and
is sad. But I </B>
<P><B>find myself feeling sad too. I hope it likes who moves in.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  mef@telusplanet.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've had strange things happen to me for most of my </B>
<P><B>life. Unexplainable things.... but the the strangest things happened
at my </B>
<P><B>last home. We built our home on a property that had a suicide committed
on </B>
<P><B>it. We often heard loud bangs and crashes that had no explanations.
The </B>
<P><B>doorbell would ring and no one would be there (we had 40 acres and
it would have </B>
<P><B>been impossible for anyone to be playing jokes on us), water faucets
would turn </B>
<P><B>off and on, off and on, strong cologne smells that would wake me in
the middle </B>
<P><B>of the night (my husband would still be at work and no, I wasn't having
an </B>
<P><B>affair) people talking and laughing in our bedroom, only we couldn't
see them, </B>
<P><B>light switches turning off by themselves, loud, heavy footsteps coming
into my </B>
<P><B>room, stopping and then leaving, plants and lamps being turned upside
</B>
<P><B>down. My mother and her dog would come for a visit. Mom would feel
a real </B>
<P><B>presence in her room and the dog would stand at the foot of the stairs,
barking </B>
<P><B>madly. I left the home 5 years ago and it doesn't seem like whatever
was </B>
<P><B>there followed ... thank the the Lord.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  rushentk@cadvision.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure why, but both my cousin Jessie and I, who now own a
house</B>
<P><B>together, seem to be overwhelmed by ghostly happenings.  Several
months</B>
<P><B>after her father's death, she witnessed a bright light materialize
in a</B>
<P><B>rocking chair in her home back in Ontario, and, as the chair began
to rock</B>
<P><B>steadily, she smelled her dad's favorite aftershave wafting through
the</B>
<P><B>room; about the same time, my whole family was rocked by the nightly</B>
<P><B>sing-song of Neil Diamond's "Song Sung Blue" upstairs in the kitchen
while</B>
<P><B>we stared nervously up the stairs, both fascinated and frightened on</B>
<P><B>hearing the voice of my late brother, a mildly retarded young man who
had</B>
<P><B>died of nephritis years before.  Once Alan decided to stop serenading,
our</B>
<P><B>old dog died... but we continued to hear the slow "pit-a-pat" of her</B>
<P><B>footsteps up the stairs every day until my parents sold the house and
moved</B>
<P><B>away.  Later, by peculiar chance, my art consultant lived in the
house.</B>
<P><B>The dog, apparently, was still there too.</B>
<P><B>  About six years ago, Jess and I (at that point unaware that we were
first</B>
<P><B>cousins!) moved into an ancient and rickety house downtown here in
Calgary.</B>
<P><B> Three days later, as I hung up clothes in the deep closet in my room,
a</B>
<P><B>cheerful voice, that of an elderly man, from BEHIND the barrier of</B>
<P><B>clothing, said, "Hello."  That guy said hello to me every morning until
we</B>
<P><B>moved out-- from down the stairs, in the foyer as I came inside,
everywhere</B>
<P><B>and anywhere... except down in the basement.  Down there was something
we</B>
<P><B>called the Lump; I don't know what the Lump was, but I had the
impression</B>
<P><B>it might have been a severely disturbed or retarded adolescent that
had</B>
<P><B>been kept locked in the canning kitchen down in that hellhole of a
lower</B>
<P><B>level.  His presence was overwhelming, even stifling: our roommate,
Gloria,</B>
<P><B>wouldn't even go downstairs, and, if she needed anything from the
boxes</B>
<P><B>that we all kept stored down there, she insisted we go fetch it.  Still,
if</B>
<P><B>she wouldn't visit the Lump, it would visit her.  More than once the</B>
<P><B>sliding door of her bedroom on the main floor was pushed open, and
she</B>
<P><B>would sense someone looking at her, checking on her.  She blamed us.</B>
<P><B>Funny... our bedrooms were upstairs... and she was really too much
of a</B>
<P><B>bi**h to bother visiting in the middle of the night.</B>
<P><B>  Jessie also saw a white poodle run down the upstairs hallway a few
times.</B>
<P><B>  Right now, in our new house, things move about and disappear,
sometimes</B>
<P><B>for a week or more.  They always reappear clean and dusted.
 Hopefully,</B>
<P><B>that's the extent of this poltergeist-type activity... and if they
move my</B>
<P><B>keyboard or monitor, I think I'll consult an exorcist.</B>
<P><B>  All true, and thanks for listening</B>
