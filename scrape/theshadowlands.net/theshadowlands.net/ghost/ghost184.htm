<p><b>Missing Night Gown</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ratnest9@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>H One night, I was getting ready for bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>always tried to be IN bed at night before my husband left for work.&nbsp;
Silly</b>
<br><b>as it sounds, I could just pull the covers over my head when I started
hearing</b>
<br><b>noises.&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; Well I had this pink nightie.&nbsp; I wore
this night gown every</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; I mean EVERY night.&nbsp; I had it for years and it
was comfortable.&nbsp; (I</b>
<br><b>washed it of course)&nbsp; anyway, one night Brian was getting ready
for work and</b>
<br><b>I was getting ready for bed and I pulled my night gown out from
under my</b>
<br><b>pillow and laid it on the bed.&nbsp; I went in the bathroom to brush
my teeth and</b>
<br><b>when I came back the night gown was gone.&nbsp; The bed was still
neatly made and</b>
<br><b>Brian was still down stairs getting ready.&nbsp; I looked under
my pillow and all</b>
<br><b>over the room for my nightie.&nbsp; I went downstairs and asked
Brian if he took</b>
<br><b>my night gown ... he said "no, I haven't been upstairs".&nbsp;&nbsp;
So, I went back</b>
<br><b>up stairs and checked all of my dresser drawers, looked under the
bed, and ALL</b>
<br><b>over again.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no sight of my night gown.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I conceded to wear</b>
<br><b>one of Brian's old t shirts to bed since it was as close as I could
get to</b>
<br><b>my pink night gown.&nbsp;&nbsp; I put his shirt on and went down
stairs to kiss Brian</b>
<br><b>good night.&nbsp; I went back upstairs, pulled down the covers and
got into bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was sitting Indian style under the covers waiting for the news to
come on when I</b>
<br><b>looked down and there, in my LAP was my night gown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just sat there</b>
<br><b>staring at it.&nbsp; I was unable to move and in total disbelief.&nbsp;
Brian came</b>
<br><b>upstairs to say "good-bye" and I just looked at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This episode didn't</b>
<br><b>scare me though, I felt like she was almost playing with me.</b>

<p><b>Trio Of Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cwilson85@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've three experiences which ghosts one in England, one at McChord
AFB, and</b>
<br><b>two at NAS North Island.</b>
<br><b>The first one was when I was about 9-11 yrs old, living in Banbury,</b>
<br><b>Oxfordshire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the large bedroom to the right
of the</b>
<br><b>stairs across from the bathroom.&nbsp; My room.&nbsp; The "feeling"
came from the</b>
<br><b>closet around nightfall it was like someone was in the closet angry
yet</b>
<br><b>upset and my cat would not even enter the room at the time.&nbsp;
Several months</b>
<br><b>later I moved to the smaller room next to it and the "feelings"
were still</b>
<br><b>in the bigger room.&nbsp; I never told my parents.</b>
<br><b>The second one was in base housing at McChord AFB,&nbsp; my room
again.&nbsp; The only</b>
<br><b>thing I heard was a sawing noise and then a scream at different
times but</b>
<br><b>always between 5-7pm.&nbsp; And again my cat (different cat) refused
to enter the</b>
<br><b>room at those times. the hamsters weren't too happy either.&nbsp;
This was after</b>
<br><b>my father was transferred to Washington from England. This one I
told my</b>
<br><b>parents but they didn't believe me.</b>
<br><b>My third was is on NAS North Island on the 7th floor.&nbsp; This
one</b>
<br><b>I have a history for.&nbsp; A couple were on the top floor aruging
they were</b>
<br><b>drunk&nbsp; the guy pushed the girl and she fall from the 7th deck
and hitting</b>
<br><b>the stone table below killing her.&nbsp; Anyway, 0230-0300 one can
hear arguing,</b>
<br><b>a girl scream and then something go crash(sort of). But if you look
out you</b>
<br><b>see nothing and the noise stops only to continue whe you go back
inside.</b>
<br><b>The table still has a crack in it.&nbsp; The young man was courtmartialed
and</b>
<br><b>found guilty for murder.&nbsp; But for some reason then scene plays
over and over</b>
<br><b>again at the eve of her death</b>

<p><b>Distinct Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: zechony@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am really curious about three completely separate and distinct
experiences</b>
<br><b>I've had over the years where I must have seen a ghost but it appeared
in</b>
<br><b>the form of people who were and are still alive.</b>
<br><b>I have been trying to research this but I can't find any stories
like this.</b>
<br><b>Now I am wondering if maybe I saw something that my mind didn't
want to see</b>
<br><b>and I 'made' it look like someone who was still alive so I wouldn't
get</b>
<br><b>scared?&nbsp; But I"m don't think so becuase never did I feel scared
when I saw</b>
<br><b>it..only when I realized that it couldn't have been what I saw did
I get</b>
<br><b>chills.</b>
<br><b>Here, let me try and give you a quick synopsis.. first time this
happened I</b>
<br><b>was in highschool.&nbsp; I was at my friend Jasmine's house and
she lived</b>
<br><b>upstairs and there was only one staircase to get to her room.&nbsp;
but their</b>
<br><b>bathroom was downstairs.&nbsp; We were just hanging out one day
and I had to go</b>
<br><b>to the bathroom and I went downstairs and when I came out of the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>she was standing in the kitchen and she looked right at me and I
just walked</b>
<br><b>by her and headed back upstairs.&nbsp; when I got upstairs she was
upstairs!&nbsp; and</b>
<br><b>I was just like how the hell can you be upstairs already if you
were just</b>
<br><b>downstairs!&nbsp; and she swore to me she had been up there the
whole time.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>mean I walked by this thing like only a few feet away and it looked
JUST</b>
<br><b>like her.&nbsp; a real person. I wasn't scared or anything til i
realized it</b>
<br><b>couldn't have been her.</b>
<br><b>then it happened again when I was a senior in highschool and I was
at my</b>
<br><b>best friend Jen's house and we were watching blue velvet with the
lights off</b>
<br><b>in her tv room.&nbsp; Jen has five brothers and sister and they
always have</b>
<br><b>friends and boyfriends over so I just figured when I saw this that
itw as</b>
<br><b>somebody else in the house.&nbsp; we were watching tv when out ofthe
corner of my</b>
<br><b>eye I saw somebody get up off a bench at the bottom of the stairs
and walk</b>
<br><b>silently up the stairs.&nbsp; It looked exactly like her sister
sally.&nbsp; only it</b>
<br><b>irked me because I hadn't realized she had been down there the whole
time.</b>
<br><b>so I said to jen, I didn't realize sally was home?&nbsp; and jen
was just like</b>
<br><b>waht are you talking about, she's not.&nbsp; and then i said I thought
I saw</b>
<br><b>sally walk upstairs from the bench..and Jen totally freaked out
adn started</b>
<br><b>crying and made me promise to shut up adn not talk about it anymore
and she</b>
<br><b>was hysterical and said no one else was home and she refused to
talk about</b>
<br><b>it or hear anything I was gonna say until her parents got home.</b>
<br><b>(as it turned outher parents had seen ghosts in the laundry room
but jen had</b>
<br><b>never seen them)</b>
<br><b>then it happened again when I was in college and commuting to rutgers.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>was coming home one night and it was sort of late.. maybe 11ish
and when I</b>
<br><b>opened the front door I heard what sounded like the television set
switch</b>
<br><b>off.&nbsp; I could even feel that static crackly feeling when you
turn off the</b>
<br><b>tv. and my dog was there and I walked intot he tv room and the light
was on</b>
<br><b>and I saw my dad get up and run into the living room from the sofa!&nbsp;
and for</b>
<br><b>whatever reason I was compelled to RUN after him.. so me and tonka
ran into</b>
<br><b>the living room adn followed it around back to the front foyer to
the bottom</b>
<br><b>of the steps and there is just no way my dad could have ran up the
stairs</b>
<br><b>without me hearing or seeing him.&nbsp; so my dog is going bonkers
now and I'm</b>
<br><b>thinking waht did I just do?&nbsp; and so I asked my mom if dad
just ran upstairs</b>
<br><b>and she woke up and said no your fathers right here sleeping.&nbsp;
and I just</b>
<br><b>was weirded out.&nbsp; the next morning my parents asked me what
happened adn I</b>
<br><b>told them the same thing.&nbsp; the thing I remember that really
struck me about</b>
<br><b>what I saw, was that my dad was wearing this old mustard yellow
sweater from</b>
<br><b>liket he 70's that he used to wear when me and my sister were little.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>had the leather patches on the elbows.&nbsp; I just thought that
was odd.</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: angelwings211@lycos.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This ghost experience happened about
5 years ago. Me and my family lived in a big old house that was at least
80 or 90 years old.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had just moved to this little
town in California that not many people knew about.&nbsp; We knew our landlady
very well and she had told us that her husband (which had passed away not
long before then) grew up in that house with many brothers and sisters.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first few weeks we had lived
there nothing majorly paranormal happened..... but just a few little odd
things that we didnt pay much attention to.&nbsp; Like a few nights while
we were all eating dinner.... the dining room ligth kept on flashing on
and off.... but we didn't expect any paranormal activity... we just thought
it was because of the age of the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We first started getting suspicius when
in the middle of the night, all the sinks and faucets in the house would&nbsp;
turn on full blast and we would have to get up and turn them all off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time while we were all about to
go to sleep, our electricity went out.&nbsp; We all thought it was just
a power outage so my dad went back to turn the breaker swiches back on
.&nbsp; After we all got back in our beds we heard a big "FLIP" ... that
was the sound of someone turning off the breaker swiches.&nbsp; Me and
my sister went in the back room to turn them back on.&nbsp; While we were
heading out of the back room i screamed and my sister looked at what i
was looking at... it was a little boy standing in the corner of the back
room.&nbsp; We ran out of there and told our mom but you know how moms
are..."it was nothing".... but we both knew it was something.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few other things started to happen
that convinced my mom that our housse was not normal.</b>
<br><b>One night when my aunt and uncle came over.me, my sister and my
aunt were sitting on the couch when we saw a little naked boy run across
the kitchen!&nbsp; We all thought it was my little brother but then my
brother came out of his room screaming because he saaw a figure of a blck
crow flying around his room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We always saw this little boy but
we had a feeling he wasnt an evil ghost he was just a playful little boy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of the times we would set something
on the table and the next minute it would be gone, we would look everywhere
but it wasnt anywhere! A few times our clocks would be set like 4 hours
off the real time, and&nbsp; our clocks would run even with no batteries
..and also our washer and dryer would be runnning with nothing in .nobody
would want to stay the nigth or come over for dinner.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my friends and I ran over
to her house to get something that she needed....she lived next door...we
had never told her about our ghost...but while we were comeing back to
my house....she started screaming and ran into my house... i asked her
what happened and she said she saw a little kid sitting on my roof.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few times while stting down somewhere
we would feel a very cold draft run through the house.at that time we were
fully convinced that we had a little ghost boy living in our house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before we had moved from that house
we where cleaning out out garrage .me and my brother found a small set
of footprints..it looked like a little boys foot prints.it looked like
the footprints of a 3 or 4 year old child.... ingraved in the cement..and
unnder the footprints was a name, it was "Billy".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had lived 4 full years in that house
with a little boy named Billy.</b>

<p><b>Something In the House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rdiheath@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It happened at about 0400 yesterday morning. My wife</b>
<br><b>and 10 month old son and I were all fast asleep and he</b>
<br><b>woke up a bit fussy and wanting something to drink. My</b>
<br><b>wife woke me and handed me the bottle to go down to</b>
<br><b>the kitchen and fill it and as I layed there forcing</b>
<br><b>myself to wake up our son suddenly dropped int a deep</b>
<br><b>sleep and there was a loud "pop" sound out in the</b>
<br><b>hall. The best description of the sound was that of a</b>
<br><b>light bulb blowing. My wife started as did I and asked</b>
<br><b>me if I hear that. " I did" and layed there listening</b>
<br><b>intently as the only lights on in the house was the</b>
<br><b>light down in the living room and the light over the</b>
<br><b>sink in the kitchen. As we sat there listening and</b>
<br><b>trying to decide if we had actually heard something it</b>
<br><b>got frigidly cold in the room and then there was</b>
<br><b>another&nbsp; of the "pop" sounds only this time coming</b>
<br><b>from the other side of the room as opposed to the</b>
<br><b>other side of the bedroom door. There were NO lights</b>
<br><b>on in the room. The windows were all closed as it was</b>
<br><b>chilly out that night and there are no trees anywhere</b>
<br><b>near the house or any windows in the house to blame</b>
<br><b>for the sounds. I got up and turned on the light and</b>
<br><b>it worked fine, I went out into the hall and checked</b>
<br><b>the light there, in the bathroom and in our sons room</b>
<br><b>and all worked fine. I went downstairs where I found</b>
<br><b>the LR light still on and checked all other lights and</b>
<br><b>they too were working fine. As I went through the DR I</b>
<br><b>hit a spot just before the kitchen door that was</b>
<br><b>stifling hot. Like in the winter when you enter a</b>
<br><b>department store and they have the heat cranked to</b>
<br><b>inferno level to warm you up. I quickly filled the</b>
<br><b>bottle and went right back through the hot spot that</b>
<br><b>was now normal temperature ( there are no heat vents</b>
<br><b>in that part of the dining room) I returned to the</b>
<br><b>bedroom to report that all was fine and just wrote it</b>
<br><b>off to the house settling. Our house is an old house</b>
<br><b>built in the early 1900's. We didnt think anything</b>
<br><b>else about it until last evening when we were sitting</b>
<br><b>in the living room and our son was on the floor</b>
<br><b>playing and crawling around like a wild man. It was</b>
<br><b>really windy out and starting to storm somewhat and</b>
<br><b>the lights went out for about 3 seconds and then came</b>
<br><b>back on again. Our son was sitting on the floor as I</b>
<br><b>said and he sat up and was staring up the stairs as if</b>
<br><b>he saw something and then started to smile and then</b>
<br><b>laugh. Hes into pointing at everything and he was</b>
<br><b>pointing up the stairs and kept turning back to us and</b>
<br><b>smiling and then going back to the stairs again. As we</b>
<br><b>sat and watched him he was " following" or "tracking"</b>
<br><b>something down the stairs and across the living room</b>
<br><b>into the dining room and then he smiled and looked</b>
<br><b>back at us and started crawling to the dining room. He</b>
<br><b>got to the gate blocking his retreat and pulled</b>
<br><b>himself up and was still pointing and laughing, and</b>
<br><b>then he turned around and went back to the stairs and</b>
<br><b>was looking up them again as if he saw something</b>
<br><b>again. Then he started to cry very hard as if he had</b>
<br><b>hurt himself and came over to us sitting on the floor</b>
<br><b>and was nearly hysterical. He kept burying his face</b>
<br><b>into my wifes shoulder and then looking back to the</b>
<br><b>stairs and crying. then he again followed with his</b>
<br><b>eyes something ( we saw nothing there) down the stairs</b>
<br><b>and to the front door. The wind picked up and the</b>
<br><b>lights flickered again and immediately he was happy</b>
<br><b>and wanting to get back to the floor and his playing.</b>
<br><b>I do not believe in ghosts but I have NO explanation</b>
<br><b>of what happened. our neighbors experienced nothing</b>
<br><b>out of the ordinary pertaining to electricity going</b>
<br><b>out at any time. My wife said that this was not the</b>
<br><b>first time that our son acted like he was watching</b>
<br><b>someone or something in the house.....</b>

<p><b>I Heard Many Ghosts as a Child</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: redhotmagma@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about 6 yrs old and I got to move up into the
room up stairs that</b>
<br><b>was forbidden to me before I moved up there. No one was up stairs
accept me</b>
<br><b>and the house was before the civil war. The room I got was huge
and the room</b>
<br><b>used to be the old servant's&nbsp; quarters. Anyway write when I
was about to</b>
<br><b>fall asleep I would here somone coming up the stairs and they would
never</b>
<br><b>stop, I just fell asleep to them being scared because no one would
answer</b>
<br><b>when I called out to ask who was there. Every night this would happen
and I</b>
<br><b>would tell my mother and she would just say, "Whatever it was it
won't hurt</b>
<br><b>you, because Jesus is watching out for you." That put my 6 yr old
mind at</b>
<br><b>ease. Then one night I was so currious I got out of bed slowly as
the foot</b>
<br><b>steps were going up the stairs and as soon as I stuck my head around
the</b>
<br><b>door way the foot steps stopped and I saw nothing. I then started
walking</b>
<br><b>back to the bed and they started up again. Then I ran and jumped
on my bed</b>
<br><b>and went to bed scared again. So this kept going on and I finally
got used</b>
<br><b>to them and then I quit hearing them. Years went buy untill I was
about 11</b>
<br><b>and I had a friend, Matt, stay over and he heard the foot steps
and he was</b>
<br><b>all freaked out. I told him to ignore them and they would go away.
Well he</b>
<br><b>stayed over so much that he didn't hear them anymore either. Then
Another</b>
<br><b>kid,Kenny,&nbsp; stayed over while Matt was over and kenny woke
us both up and</b>
<br><b>was holding my M16 water gun out in front of him freaking out asking
what</b>
<br><b>the hell is coming up the stairs. We both told him to ignore the
foot steps</b>
<br><b>and to go to sleep. So two other people heard them so I know it
just wasn't</b>
<br><b>my imagination. I have always been kinda into ghosts ever since
then. I used</b>
<br><b>to go to cemetaries all the time and to freaky abandoned places
to see if I</b>
<br><b>could apot some ghosts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I do think that kids can see more spirits
because they don't have the</b>
<br><b>'reallity' blanket over there heads. I think grown ups just see
things and</b>
<br><b>they just write them off as not being there or just something they
just</b>
<br><b>don't care about.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LS23701@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My daughter and future son in law purchased a home approximately
one year ago</b>
<br><b>in Portsmouth, Virginia.&nbsp; Since renovating the house and moving
in, they have</b>
<br><b>had some very disturbing happenings and they do not know where to
turn for</b>
<br><b>fear of being thought "crazy."&nbsp; Initially, the workers in the
house</b>
<br><b>complained of doors closing and hearing "footsteps" and nobody was
there.</b>
<br><b>Tools seemed to be misplaced, and all of this was dismissed.</b>
<br><b>Finally, the house was ready to move into and my daughter was alone
in the</b>
<br><b>house one day and she sensed that she was not alone.&nbsp; This
frightened her, as</b>
<br><b>she had come into the home, locked the door and started about her
work.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>was standing in the dining room and she slowly turned to find what
she</b>
<br><b>describes only as a cloud or "mist" and upon seeing the vapor, she
dropped</b>
<br><b>what she had in her hand and she said the vapor "swirled" and headed
out of</b>
<br><b>the door and vanished, whereupon she ran for the kitchen door, unlocked
it</b>
<br><b>and ran down the street crying and shaking. She was stopped by a
concerned</b>
<br><b>neighbor who took her into his home and tried to calm her.&nbsp;
Imagine our</b>
<br><b>surprise at finding that on this particular day, the former owner
of the home</b>
<br><b>had died in the dining room.&nbsp; Apparently, the dining room had
been converted</b>
<br><b>to a sick room which was downstairs and close to the kitchen and
half bath, a</b>
<br><b>location easier for the care of this dying woman.&nbsp; My daughter
said that</b>
<br><b>although this vapor had no physical appearance of a woman or a man,
she</b>
<br><b>sensed that it was a woman and this vapor appeared to be peering
into the</b>
<br><b>china cabinet at the newly arranged silver and china.&nbsp; Obviously,&nbsp;
we all</b>
<br><b>thought my daughter was "over stressed" or had a very vivid imagination
and</b>
<br><b>we all tried to assure her that this was just her immagination playing
tricks</b>
<br><b>on her.</b>
<br><b>Several times since, they have either seen, heard of smelled something
in the</b>
<br><b>house that was not normal.&nbsp; Once, my future son in law came
upstairs,</b>
<br><b>complaining that someone had been smoking in the house, and it smelled
of</b>
<br><b>cigarette smoke in the den.&nbsp; He was angry, thinking my daughter
had allowed</b>
<br><b>someone to smoke in the home, which she had not.&nbsp; This was
upon rising in the</b>
<br><b>morning and there had been no visitors to the home the previous
day.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>arose, came downstairs adn confirmed that the den did, indeed, smell
strongly</b>
<br><b>of cigarette smoke. They opened the windows and aired the house.</b>
<br><b>My daughter has had several hair-raising experiences in the home,
but never</b>
<br><b>seen anything again, however, she has been awakened in the morning,
alone in</b>
<br><b>the house, by hearing footsteps coming from the hardwood floors
towards her</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; There has been water spilled on the nightstand and on
the floor and</b>
<br><b>there was no water in the bedroom.&nbsp; She simply wiped it up
and did not say</b>
<br><b>anything about it.&nbsp; She said that since the initial "sighting",
she has just</b>
<br><b>kept the footsteps and the water episodes to herself, thinking her
fiance</b>
<br><b>would think she was "off" a bit.&nbsp; Finally, last night, HE heard
it.&nbsp; At</b>
<br><b>approximately 3 a.m., he was awakened by definite footsteps coming
up the</b>
<br><b>stairs (it appeared if someone were walking heavily up the stairs)
and he sat</b>
<br><b>upright in bed, sook&nbsp; my daughter awake and in a state of panic,
told her</b>
<br><b>there was someone in the house, and together they listened, heard
the</b>
<br><b>footsteps and he jumped out of bed, ran to the door and shouted
"stop" and</b>
<br><b>popped on the light, only to be greeted by an empty hallway and
no human in</b>
<br><b>sight.&nbsp; They looked out the windows for cars ( still believing
there was a</b>
<br><b>person in the house), went all over the house, turning on every
light and</b>
<br><b>finding nothing.&nbsp; Now he is a believer!&nbsp; He was unable

<p><b>Haunting in Utah</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sk8achase@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have a true story about a place that is haunted in&nbsp; Ut, on
the 13th of</b>
<br><b>October, It is at a friend of mines house, we were playing one night
at we</b>
<br><b>decided to record EVP in one bedroom that a person has died of old
age</b>
<br><b>sleeping, we already knew the place was haunted because of deaths
in the</b>
<br><b>house and the things that happen such as: the faucet in the kitchen
turning</b>
<br><b>on for no reason, it really turns on, we stuck a bowl under it empty,
and in</b>
<br><b>the morning it was half full of water, also down in the basement
the closet</b>
<br><b>is big and long, it is a dark place, we suspect a haunting going
on because</b>
<br><b>the hangars go back and forth frequently, and another thing is that
the house</b>
<br><b>is from the 1800s, very old, probably mid-1800s. So we decided to
record EVP</b>
<br><b>in the bedroom and the closet, and various places in the house.
Not even</b>
<br><b>thinking what we were getting into we started recording in the bedroom,</b>
<br><b>asking for a name, how the ghost died, and how long has the ghost
been there,</b>
<br><b>then we went to other rooms to record and we asked various questions.
We</b>
<br><b>played the tape back and the first question was, "What was your
name?" we</b>
<br><b>heard a response saying Mable, the same name of their grandma that
died in</b>
<br><b>the house. We heard things on the tape from the closet saying "Get
Away", and</b>
<br><b>"Shhh!!" We decided to stop messing with the recorder and go back
upstairs to</b>
<br><b>play, we started playing when we heard something like the sound
of the</b>
<br><b>hangars going back and forth, so we got really scared and tense,
nobody dared</b>
<br><b>to go near the stairs, then all of a sudden my friend's Mom called
from her</b>
<br><b>work and asked, "What is going on, I have a bad feeling about leaving
you</b>
<br><b>guys all alone." We knew something was going on too, so we went
to the</b>
<br><b>neighbors house across the street to get away, the neighbor didn't
believe</b>
<br><b>us, and thought we were scared for no reason, but she took us in
anyways, and</b>
<br><b>said, "I am going to call your Mom," to my friends. Then I looked
outside and</b>
<br><b>all the lights in the house were off!! I know we didn't turn any
lights off,</b>
<br><b>so I decided to go in the house all alone, because nobody dared
to follow,</b>
<br><b>and the door was locked!!!&nbsp; Then their Mom came home, and unlocked
the door,</b>
<br><b>our neighbor told her about how we were scared and came over, she
didn't</b>
<br><b>believe us either, this is a true story and we were not exaggerating,
I am</b>
<br><b>still scared to go in that house, that was one night I will never
forget.</b>

<p><b>Haunting in Nebraska</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: louda_99@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi! I've loved reading these stories. I keep getting</b>
<br><b>goose bumps though! I figure it's about time that I</b>
<br><b>tell our own story.</b>
<br><b>Although it isn't as dramatic as some of those listed</b>
<br><b>here, it was real enough for me. Right out of college,</b>
<br><b>my husband and I moved to a rental in a small Nebraska</b>
<br><b>town. This house was very cute and well-maintained. It</b>
<br><b>had two strange features, though. In the</b>
<br><b>bathroom/laundry room, there were three doors – one to</b>
<br><b>the hallway and out the back door (on the south end),</b>
<br><b>one to the basement (in the center), and one to a</b>
<br><b>closet room (on the north end). The basement was one</b>
<br><b>of those spooky basements: one big room; creaky, old</b>
<br><b>stairs; dimly lit. The closet room was a strange room</b>
<br><b>about 12 feet by 12 feet, lined with cabinets from</b>
<br><b>floor to ceiling on three sides.</b>
<br><b>Throughout the rest of this house, I felt very</b>
<br><b>comfortable and relaxed. It had a warm feeling to it.</b>
<br><b>But as I would turn down the hall and head to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, the feeling of dread would increase. I was</b>
<br><b>never comfortable in the bathroom (the only one in the</b>
<br><b>house) and would rush through showers and getting</b>
<br><b>ready and all the other duties done in the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>And I would never go in there in without a light on.</b>
<br><b>But the experience wasn't based just on my hunches.</b>
<br><b>The bathroom door leading to the hallway would never</b>
<br><b>stay open. Eventually, my resourceful husband rigged</b>
<br><b>up a rope that we used to tie the door open. I would</b>
<br><b>blame this on the house settling or a crooked doorjam,</b>
<br><b>but the door to the basement – right next to the</b>
<br><b>hallway door – would never stay closed. It would</b>
<br><b>randomly open itself, even if you weren't in the room</b>
<br><b>or were across the room no where near the door.</b>
<br><b>Eventually, we learned if we slammed the door shut and</b>
<br><b>locked it, it would usually stay closed. But even</b>
<br><b>then, it occasionally opened after we had locked it.</b>
<br><b>My husband worked strange hours with his job in</b>
<br><b>Nebraska, so often times I would be getting ready by</b>
<br><b>myself in the morning. I'm the first to admit I have</b>
<br><b>an active imagination, but I also don't like others to</b>
<br><b>know when I overreact to something. One morning when I</b>
<br><b>was getting ready for work and my husband had already</b>
<br><b>left, I was in the bathroom curling my hair when I</b>
<br><b>distinctly heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I</b>
<br><b>stopped what I was doing and stood perfectly still to</b>
<br><b>see if I actually was hearing what I thought I was</b>
<br><b>hearing. And the footsteps continued, very slowly,</b>
<br><b>almost as if someone was trying to sneak up the stairs</b>
<br><b>without making any noise. I tried to write it off as</b>
<br><b>an over active imagination – until I saw the door knob</b>
<br><b>turn on the basement door. Thank God I had locked that</b>
<br><b>door! Well I bolted out of that room so fast! But, not</b>
<br><b>wanting to appear the fool, I called my mom instead of</b>
<br><b>leaving the house. I was so scared! Mom assured me, if</b>
<br><b>I heard what I did, to get out of the house (better</b>
<br><b>safe than sorry) and get some help. Well, we were new</b>
<br><b>in the neighborhood so I wasn't comfortable doing</b>
<br><b>this. But my fear over-rode my shyness. So I headed to</b>
<br><b>our neighbors house and met one of our new neighbors –</b>
<br><b>a big, strong fireman. (Well, if anyone's going to</b>
<br><b>give me confidence to go back into the house, he did!)</b>
<br><b>So I explained what I had heard, and he escorted me</b>
<br><b>back to the bathroom. Together, we opened the basement</b>
<br><b>door – and found nothing! There was no way anyone</b>
<br><b>could have exited the house without me seeing him/her.</b>
<br><b>And even the neighbor was spooked down there. He</b>
<br><b>walked around the room, making sure no one was hiding</b>
<br><b>down there. And after assuring that I was okay, he</b>
<br><b>beat it out of the house, with goosebumps on his arms!</b>
<br><b>That wasn't the only incident. From then on, I'd joke</b>
<br><b>with family and friends about our Casper. He didn't</b>
<br><b>mean harm, but he enjoyed scaring the bejebus out of</b>
<br><b>us. Even my husband left the light on over night. But</b>
<br><b>Casper didn't limit himself to the bathroom area. One</b>
<br><b>night, I had just finished the dishes and pulled down</b>
<br><b>the shade in the kitchen window. I walked out of the</b>
<br><b>room and sat down in the living room to watch TV.</b>
<br><b>About 2 minutes later, I heard a loud noise in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen. I got up to investigate and found the kitchen</b>
<br><b>shade still shaking from being rolled up. I would</b>
<br><b>shake it off as it snapping up, but it was 2 minutes</b>
<br><b>later.</b>
<br><b>The same reasoning goes for the "dryer" incident. My</b>
<br><b>husband was brushing his teeth in the bathroom and I</b>
<br><b>was changing batches in the washer and dryer. I moved</b>
<br><b>the clothes from the washer to the dryer and turned it</b>
<br><b>on. Then, I began putting clothes in the washer for</b>
<br><b>the next batch. Suddenly, the dryer door opened by</b>
<br><b>itself. Okay, I can attribute that to something in the</b>
<br><b>batch "hitting" the door open. But then the door</b>
<br><b>closed itself and the dryer started up again. Now, the</b>
<br><b>once the door opens on the dryer, the dryer turns off</b>
<br><b>and won't restart unless you push the button up top.</b>
<br><b>And the door was open too long for it to have just</b>
<br><b>sprung shut. I just looked at my stunned husband and</b>
<br><b>booked it out of that room, telling Casper that I</b>
<br><b>didn't like him scaring me. I guess he listened,</b>
<br><b>because from then on, the only incidents we had were</b>
<br><b>the bathroom doors opening and closing and the front</b>
<br><b>door opening by itself. We have sensed moved from the</b>
<br><b>house and only after moving into our current home did</b>
<br><b>I realize how much I felt like an intruding visitor in</b>
<br><b>that house. I wonder about the history of that house.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for the chance to tell my story.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Townhome</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: houstonian2000@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Some years ago I was living in Tulsa, OK in a beautiful two-story
duplex townhome. The master bedroom was down with two guest bedrooms upstairs.
I was single and living alone. I am a physician with a specialty in emergency
medicine and considered myself very skeptical of paranormal phenomena (and
still am, though a bit more open-minded now). I had decided to convert
one of the upstairs bedrooms to an office. I had a desk and other office
furniture moved in and purchased an electric typewriter (home computers
were still just a novelty then). I was scheduled to work the 4pm - 12am
shift that evening. As I left the house, I checked to see that all the
lights except the carport and kitchen lights were off (while the formal
entry was through the living area, I always entered the home through kitchen
from the carport). All lights were off and I went to work. When I arrived
back home after my shift, I could clearly see that the light in the office-bedroom
was on. I swore that it was off when I left, but vowed to be more careful
the next time. Nothing else was out of the ordinary. In the townhome, the
stairs separated the living area from the master bedroom, creating a hallway
from the bedroom to the kitchen. On the wall facing the bedroom were all
my diplomas, licenses and certificates -- about eight or nine total. Around
this time I began noticing that they were just a little bit askew when
I got up in the morning, though not drastically -- at first. Over the next
week or two, the frames holding the certicates etc. would be grossly displaced
each morning, some of them almost sideways. I was at a loss as to why this
was occurring. There were no heavy vibrations, no construction work and
certainly no earth tremors.</b>
<br><b>Then the light in the office-bedroom began coming on by itself.
Again, I was 100% certain that the light was off when I left home (it had
become an issue with me at this point), yet when I would return from work,
it was always on. By now it was winter and snow was everywhere. Since I
had the following day off, I stayed up late one evening working in the
office-bedroom. There was a very large window (almost a picture window)
in the office that overlooked the roof of the carport and my desk was next
to it. About 12:30 am there was a tremendous "thud" on the wall just below
the window and next to where I was sitting. It caused the window glass
to shake and scared the daylights out of me. I jumped up to see if there
was anyone on the carport roof&nbsp; (there wasn't) or out in the street
(again, noone). There was no disturbance of the snow on the carport roof,
either.To create a thump that strong, someone would have to have been standing
next to the window and given it a powerful kick. This occurred again several
times before morning and persisted for weeks, always beginning after midnight
and ceasing before dawn. I had a guest over one evening who left at 3:00
am after the second thump. The thumping never occured during the day.</b>
<br><b>One evening I was lying in bed watching television downstairs in
the master bedroom. There were sliding doors that opened from the bedroom
to the carport. Whenever a car turned into the cul-de-sac at night where
my townhome was located, the headlights would shine through the glass doors
and make an arc across the wall opposite my bed. At that point, the house
blocked anymore light and the arc would disappear. I remember seeing one
or two lights shine in the room -- nothing out of the ordinary. Then a
third light. I didn't pay much attention at first until I noticed that
the light circled my bedroom three or four times -- striking all four walls!
This could not occur unless the light was IN THE ROOM ITSELF! And this
was definitely before midnight.</b>
<br><b>Around this time (but not the same night) I began hearing a sound
that later became discernible as a voice. It was high-pitched and no, it
was not telling me vile or strange things -- it would just shout "Hey!"
as though it was trying to get my attention. The intonation was high, but
it could have been either male or female and I did not recognize it as
a familiar voice. The tone of voice seemed to say "Can't you see me? Don't
you know I'm here?" But all it actually said was "Hey!" I heard this five
or six times over the next few weeks.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after that incident, I had another 4pm to 12am shift. This
time, the upstairs light remained off and I was very relieved. Since I
was not sleepy, I decided to stay up a while and play the piano which was
downstairs. Noone lived in the other half of the duplex at that time, so
I wouldn't be disturbing anyone. I had been playing about 5 or 10 minutes
when the strangest thing happened. I suddenly "knew" that I was being summoned
upstairs. I had never had a feeling like that before or since and let me
assure you -- it was a POWERFUL and UNEQUIVOCAL message. It could not have
been plainer if I had actually heard someone say "Come up here right now!"&nbsp;
I started up the stairs -- I never felt exactly "forced" to go, but I really
felt I had to. Now, I don't know how many people remember electric typewriters,
but whenever you turn on some models, the carriage return is automatically
activated and you hear a very characteristic "whirr, zip,ding" sound. I
was about two steps from the top of the stairs when: "whirr, zip, ding".
I turned around immediately and spent the rest of the night at a friend's
house. (I had purposely left the electric typewriter on several times to
see if any message might be waiting for me when I returned home, but that
never happened.)</b>
<br><b>I had a very good friend at the time who was known for collecting
teddy bears. We unfortunately had a very serious and emotional argument
in the townhome a few days after the typewriter incident (the argument
had nothing to do with any of the strange events). My friend left through
the kitchen door. I had followed as far as the kitchen. I was wrecked emotionally
and just stood there in the kitchen silently. Suddenly, an object fell
out of one of the kitchen cabinets (which had never happened before). I
was standing AWAY FROM THE CABINETS and was PERFECTLY STILL AND SILENT
and all cabinet doors were CLOSED! There was no slamming of doors (my friend
did not slam any doors either). The object that fell out of the cabinet
was a jar of honey IN THE SHAPE OF A BEAR! I felt like someone or something
was telling me that I had really screwed up and needed to make amends (which
I did).</b>
<br><b>Eventually, the phenomena stopped and never returned -- the diploma
frames stopped moving, no noises or voices were heard and the light stayed
off when turned off. I have long since moved from Tulsa and nothing of
this sort has happened to me again.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Quarantine Station - Manly</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: al.caton@bigpond.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In the 1800's if a ship came from overseas and someone on board was
ill, all the passengers and crew were quarantined at a station situated
on a headland near Manly.&nbsp; All the ship's inhabitants would stay until
the contagious period had passed, some passengers never left at all.&nbsp;
High walls and high cliffs surrounded the hospitals, lodges, cemetary and
staff quarters.</b>
<br><b>The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service runs tours by lantern
after dark and not only do you find out about the history of the place,
but you may also see a ghostly inhabitant!</b>
<br><b>One of the eeriest places is the old graveyard.&nbsp; Thousands
of people who died from diseases such as cholera, smallpox and diptheria
were buried there. Nothing much grows there now.&nbsp; Authorities eventually
removed all of the gravestones as the sight was upsetting to the arriving
immigrants.&nbsp; Only one tombstone remains, that of a young girl.&nbsp;
No-one knows why her tomb was spared.&nbsp; She is sometimes said to join
the tour near this site and is often mistaken for one of the group.</b>
<br><b>There is quite a collection of visitor's photos to see.&nbsp; Many
people have taken pictures of unexplained phenonema and human shapes inside
the buildings.</b>
<br><b>Locks in various gates are said to be unlocked by a ghostly gatekeeper
who does his rounds at midnight, and a doctor who drowned whilst crossing
to the station still resides in the senior doctor's quarters.&nbsp; He
walks the first story verandah and looks towards the sea where he died
over 100 years ago.</b>
<br><b>Visitors can stay on site at the conference facilities or sleep
in the old hospital.&nbsp; Visitors are often awaken by crying and phantom
lantern lights in the old wards.&nbsp; One old grounds keeper has been
known to haunt the area around his cottage and is considered quite dangerous.&nbsp;
It is said that he once pushed a lady near a cliff edge and she would have
been killed if she fallen over.&nbsp; Other nurses' quarters are uninhabitable
due to the dead that still haunt their old rooms.</b>
<br><b>All up, it is an amazing place to visit when next you visit Sydney
town.&nbsp; More information can be obtained by contacting the local tourism
authorities.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Holiday Inn Select</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hi, I am writing this regarding an experience that a friend of mine
recently had in a Hotel in San Diego, CA. She was attending a training
for work at this hotel and she and another attendee who were in separate
rooms on different floors had very eerie experiences that were definately
paranormal and should be checked into. When the hotel staff was told about
it, the comments were, "yes, we believe you. This was at a Holiday Inn
Select, and if you would be interested in checking it out and would like
the address and more detailed information on the incidents, please mail
me back and I will gladly get the information for you. I have had experiences

<p><b>Ghosts?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: roadnottaken2002@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Round One</b>
<br><b>When I was 14, my family moved to Seattle where my</b>
<br><b>father was to do some teaching.&nbsp; We rented a beautiful</b>
<br><b>old house.&nbsp; From the time we moved in I was</b>
<br><b>uncomfortable.&nbsp; I would turn quickly to think I saw</b>
<br><b>someone move, just out of sight.&nbsp; I was placed in the</b>
<br><b>downstairs room, which seemed to have the largest</b>
<br><b>amount of activity.&nbsp; Each night my dog would awake</b>
<br><b>barking at what seemed to be nothing and my cat would</b>
<br><b>become very alert.&nbsp; I eventually moved myself upstairs</b>
<br><b>into my baby brother’s room and he was sleeping with</b>
<br><b>my parents.&nbsp; One day while my father was away on</b>
<br><b>business, my mother and I heard what sounded like a</b>
<br><b>large box drop.&nbsp; We looked all around the house and</b>
<br><b>found nothing to have made the noise.&nbsp; Because I was</b>
<br><b>scared I asked to spend the night with my mother.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was to sleep that night in my brother’s bed and my</b>
<br><b>brother would sleep with my mom.&nbsp; My mother and I were</b>
<br><b>facing each other, me with my back to the closets.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>said good night and turned out the light.&nbsp; A moment</b>
<br><b>later my mother bolted upright.&nbsp; Startled I said,</b>
<br><b>“what is it? she told me to be quiet and reached into</b>
<br><b>the nightstand for some mace.&nbsp; I turned to see what</b>
<br><b>she was looking at.&nbsp; Out from the closet came light,</b>
<br><b>as though someone had switched on a light.&nbsp; There was</b>
<br><b>no light in the closet!&nbsp; We looked through the closet</b>
<br><b>and through the house for 2 hours and found nothing.</b>
<br><b>I remember my mother saying, don’t worry, it’s just a</b>
<br><b>ghost it won’t hurt you".&nbsp; She was right, it never did</b>
<br><b>but I continued to feel uncomfortable and see what I</b>
<br><b>think was a woman until we finally moved from the</b>
<br><b>house.</b>
<br><b>Round Two</b>
<br><b>In 1990 my grandfather was in a retirement home.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>had several strokes and could no longer talk.&nbsp; His</b>
<br><b>hearing was always bad, but it had gotten to the point</b>
<br><b>that he could no longer hear.&nbsp; He had recently come</b>
<br><b>down with shingles and was not doing well.&nbsp; That</b>
<br><b>night, as I was drifting off to sleep, I clearly heard</b>
<br><b>my grandfather talking to me.&nbsp; He told me he loved me</b>
<br><b>and then said goodbye.&nbsp; The following morning I got a</b>
<br><b>call saying he had died.&nbsp; I already knew.</b>
<br><b>Round Three</b>
<br><b>My husband, two kids and myself took a trip to Alaska</b>
<br><b>last summer.&nbsp; We made it to the border of Canada</b>
<br><b>somewhere around eight in the evening.&nbsp; We were told</b>
<br><b>that the nearest town was a place called Hope about</b>
<br><b>thirty miles up the road.&nbsp; When we got to the town, we</b>
<br><b>found that there was no place to stay.&nbsp; Seems it was a</b>
<br><b>national holiday.&nbsp; A kind woman at a local hotel</b>
<br><b>phoned the next town up the road to see about</b>
<br><b>vacancies.&nbsp; She reserved a room for us and off we</b>
<br><b>went.&nbsp; We reached the Yale Hotel around Ten O’clock</b>
<br><b>and checked into our room.&nbsp; I turned on the TV for the</b>
<br><b>kids and they watched ‘the Family Channel’ until we</b>
<br><b>were ready for bed.&nbsp; We turned out the lights and went</b>
<br><b>to sleep.&nbsp; Sometime later, the TV awakened me.&nbsp; It had</b>
<br><b>turned on by itself.&nbsp; What was showing appeared to be</b>
<br><b>a sitcom, What was being said was far from funny.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>seemed, as though the voice was dubbed, what was said</b>
<br><b>did not match the mouth movements.&nbsp; It was a man</b>
<br><b>smiling and talking to his wife in a kitchen, what I</b>
<br><b>heard was a man with a rough voice screaming</b>
<br><b>.&nbsp; My husband had woke up with me</b>
<br><b>and asked why I had turned on the television.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>told him I didn’t, he asked that I turn it off.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>accidentally switched channels and when I turned the</b>
<br><b>knob back, the ‘show’ was gone (just snow).&nbsp; It’s</b>
<br><b>funny; it really didn’t dawn on me until the following</b>
<br><b>day how very strange it was.&nbsp; I have never before or</b>
<br><b>since had a television turn itself on to what was the</b>
<br><b>‘family channel’ and have it spew profanities at me</b>
<br><b>Round Four</b>
<br><b>My family and I moved into our first house last</b>
<br><b>October.&nbsp; My husband and I had been looking for houses</b>
<br><b>for some time.&nbsp; When we found this house, we loved it</b>
<br><b>from the start.&nbsp; It has a good warm feel to it.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after having moved in, my husband and I</b>
<br><b>compared notes and admitted that we were both having</b>
<br><b>strange feelings ‘creepy’ was the word we agreed on.</b>
<br><b>We were both finding the closet in our children’s room</b>
<br><b>open.&nbsp; The door would stay closed sometimes and other</b>
<br><b>times you’d return to find it ajar or fully opened.</b>
<br><b>My husband shared with me that he was outside doing</b>
<br><b>some digging on the French drain.&nbsp; He had set down a</b>
<br><b>piece chalk he had found.&nbsp; He turned around to pick it</b>
<br><b>up and it was gone.&nbsp; On another occasion my family and</b>
<br><b>I were sitting on the couch.&nbsp; My husband asked me to</b>
<br><b>smell my sons hair.&nbsp; It smelled intensely of perfume.</b>
<br><b>Being that neither my husband nor myself wear any</b>
<br><b>fragrance we began looking around for something that</b>
<br><b>may be carrying the scent.&nbsp; To refresh his memory he</b>
<br><b>sniffed my son’s hair again and asked me to do the</b>
<br><b>same.&nbsp; The smell was completely gone.&nbsp; The oddness</b>
<br><b>seemed to subside for months.&nbsp; Then, this year around</b>
<br><b>the same time it seems to have started again.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>closet door is again not staying closed.&nbsp; We are</b>
<br><b>having trouble finding things again.&nbsp; The other night</b>
<br><b>I felt a cold breeze coming across my face as though</b>
<br><b>the windows were open&nbsp; they were closed.&nbsp; I got up to</b>
<br><b>find the back door unlocked, knowing that I had locked</b>
<br><b>it the night before. A few nights ago when I closed my</b>
<br><b>eyes, I heard someone say to me ‘It’s All Right’.</b>
<br><b>After looking up this site and looking at the</b>
<br><b>pictures, I decided to try my hand at photographing</b>
<br><b>the potential presence.&nbsp; I went into the bedroom that</b>
<br><b>has the closet door that doesn’t close.&nbsp; I said out</b>
<br><b>loud, ‘though I’m not comfortable with the idea of</b>
<br><b>having a presence in my home I think I could deal with</b>
<br><b>it better if I knew whether or not you exist and since</b>
<br><b>I have children and they would be able to see you (if</b>
<br><b>you exist) I feel I need to be aware of that fact.</b>
<br><b>So, I’m going to take pictures of the house and if you</b>
<br><b>are comfortable having me take your picture you can</b>
<br><b>get in front of the camera.&nbsp; If you’re not comfortable</b>
<br><b>I can respect that.&nbsp; I’m guessing you’re a good</b>
<br><b>entity, because my cat seems to like you’.&nbsp; (Note: my</b>
<br><b>cat is very insistent on spending time in this room).</b>
<br><b>I must say I felt a little silly talking to the air,</b>
<br><b>but it seemed the right thing to do.&nbsp; So, I took</b>
<br><b>pictures of the house.&nbsp; I frankly was hoping that</b>
<br><b>nothing would be found and that I would find my</b>
<br><b>imagination had run away with itself.&nbsp; When I got the</b>
<br><b>pictures back I found that the photos taken in the</b>
<br><b>bedroom and in the closet have what I understand to be</b>
<br><b>a vortex. Needless to say, I’m pretty spooked.&nbsp; I’m</b>
<br><b>planning on finding out the history of the house to</b>
<br><b>see if I can figure out who our roommate is.&nbsp; Also,</b>
<br><b>I’m hoping to contact some people that are</b>
<br><b>knowledgeable on the subject of ghosts.&nbsp; If this</b>
<br><b>entity needs my assistance I hope to help.&nbsp; If it just</b>
<br><b>wants to hang out with us, that’s fine too and if it’s</b>
<br><b>bad news I need to know.&nbsp; I’m hoping that my initial</b>
<br><b>feeling of my house was correct and that what I</b>
<br><b>believe is a ghost is of the non-threatening variety.</b>
<br><b>I just keep telling myself. The ghost has been very</b>
<br><b>polite for the last year and those that should be able</b>
<br><b>to sense the presence seem not to mind it (the cats</b>
<br><b>and my two children who’s room the ghost seems to</b>
<br><b>live/spend time in).</b>

<br><b>Ghosts- haunting my house</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: the_real_billy_the_kid@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I guess my whole life I had never really ever being sheltered from
spirits.</b>
<br><b>In my family, Every third generation, the youngest child(female),
has a gift</b>
<br><b>for seeing ghosts.&nbsp; And as it turns out thats me.&nbsp; I am
15, and i think i</b>
<br><b>have seen more ghosts in my 15 years than anyone would see in a
life</b>
<br><b>generation.&nbsp; We moved into this really, big and old house.&nbsp;
It is on about</b>
<br><b>half an acre, and it consists of three buildings, the front house
is a</b>
<br><b>surgery, (both my parents are doctors) the middle house is our living
house</b>
<br><b>with our bedrooms and everything and the last house behind this
is our</b>
<br><b>garage.&nbsp; The lady who we bought our house from told us it was
haunted, and i</b>
<br><b>guess at the age of 8 i had no idea of what i was about to encounter.&nbsp;
when</b>
<br><b>we first moved in, i found it terribly frightening.&nbsp; Well my
whole family</b>
<br><b>did.&nbsp; we moved in, in one of the hottest summers of australia,
but we didnt</b>
<br><b>need an airconditioner as the house was always so cold.&nbsp; Many
atimes we</b>
<br><b>would be asleep at night and i would hear footsteps of people walking
over</b>
<br><b>the polished floors.&nbsp; You see the lady who we bought our house
from, her</b>
<br><b>husband who was also a doctor died in our house.&nbsp; We would
have showers</b>
<br><b>turning off and on by themselves, and it would be terrible frightening
to go</b>
<br><b>and have a bath to find the bath already filled.&nbsp; i remember
one of the most</b>
<br><b>scariest things that happened was one morning we had heard all this
noise</b>
<br><b>downstairs, so all four of us ( mum dad me and my sister) trooped</b>
<br><b>downstairs, there to find a full breakfast made, including toast
made from</b>
<br><b>the grill, (consider the day before we had an electrician come and
tell us</b>
<br><b>there was no way it could work, because it wasnt connected in) coffee
made,</b>
<br><b>and fruit all set on our table, none of us ate that food, but i
tell you</b>
<br><b>what, that was the day i really realised that we had a ghost in
our house.</b>
<br><b>we always had one room in our house upstairs, which we called the
spare</b>
<br><b>room, Dad forbid us from going in there as it was always so cold,
and once</b>
<br><b>dad went in and had being locked in. he said he often saw spirits
enter that</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; Dad has a gift for seeing spirits too, not as strong
as mine, but</b>
<br><b>more than once he has being chased up the stairs by something not
human.</b>
<br><b>After a couple of years, of hearing noises like this they started
to die</b>
<br><b>down, and it was possible he was starting to accept us.</b>
<br><b>The most amazing thing that happened to me, that possible proved
to everyone</b>
<br><b>my gift, was when one night i was sleeping and i woke up, to find
Dr hawkins</b>
<br><b>(the person who died in our house) lying beside me, i found it amazing
and</b>
<br><b>for what reason i did not know i did not get scared he only was
there for</b>
<br><b>about 30 seconds and before he left he said one word "piano".&nbsp;
I rang up Mrs</b>
<br><b>HAwkins and i told her about the ghost i saw, i described him to
her, and</b>
<br><b>she was shocked, for i had described Dr hawkins exactly to her,
when i had</b>
<br><b>never seen him before.&nbsp; I told her about him telling me Piano,
and she told</b>
<br><b>me he loved to play the piano.</b>
<br><b>There have being also some humerous times as well, it is not just
the family</b>
<br><b>who has seen him, once when my friends slept over, my best friend
awoke me</b>
<br><b>to say, "Anna i dont know what is with your house, but last night
someone</b>
<br><b>was singing in the shower", and that someone is Dr HAwkins.</b>
<br><b>There have being times when the electrician has come, and on one
day Dr</b>
<br><b>Hawkins was really bad and we didnt tell the electrician, so anyway
he went</b>
<br><b>to work and 5 minutes later he ran out white faced, and said " i
dont know</b>
<br><b>what was there but whatever it was it didnt want me there".&nbsp;
There have</b>
<br><b>being many many more times like this.</b>
<br><b>Now i am 15, i have moved into that room, "the spare room", and
suddenly for</b>
<br><b>some reason, alot of the coldness has gone although sometimes it
is so dark</b>
<br><b>in there, i am afraid to go in and on hot&nbsp; airless days, it
is always my</b>
<br><b>door which opens and shuts by itself, no one elses.&nbsp; Another
freaky thing</b>
<br><b>was i was in my room once and we have these big windows which are
really</b>
<br><b>hard to open and close you have to push them, and i came in once
and they</b>
<br><b>were opening and closing. So i said "open Dr hawkins" and they did
and</b>
<br><b>"Close Dr hawkins" and they did, in the middle of commanding these
windows</b>
<br><b>my grandmother came in to see me doing this, and i will never forget
the</b>
<br><b>look of fear on her face.&nbsp; One last story before i go, is the
recent one, I</b>
<br><b>walk to school on this old bush track, and on my way to school i
met this</b>
<br><b>man who was a fisherman, i greeted him and went on my way, this
continued to</b>
<br><b>happen for many days.&nbsp; I told my close friends who all know
of my gift and</b>
<br><b>my parents and i described what he looked like and then one day
they placed</b>
<br><b>in front of me a newspaper it was one that had a picture of the
man i saw</b>
<br><b>everyday on the front, it seems he had died two years ago, and it
is funny</b>
<br><b>now when i see him, after i see him, i turn around and he is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ghosts</b>
<br><b>are amazing things, they sometimes hold the answers to the future,
scare us</b>
<br><b>and reasure us, but we must always respect them as they hold powers
we dont</b>
<br><b>know.&nbsp; i thank you for this home page as i always felt like
a freak for what</b>
<br><b>i saw, now there are others like me!!&nbsp; so thankyou!! but if
i had to chose a</b>
<br><b>life without ghosts i wouldnt, as they have become a part of me
that no one</b>
<br><b>can take away.</b>

<p><b>Ghost in my Bedroom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:katy2781@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, My name is Katy and about 1 year ago me and my family moved
into a new house. The house had been unoccupied for quite a few years,
and we got it at a very good deal. I've read some of your other stories
and this is not half as scarey as any olther, but I hope you will listin
and tell me what you think it might be.</b>
<br><b>About 1 year after we had moved into that house weird things have
started happening. I would be asleep and wake up to feeling another presence
in the room. One night I woke up to an intense pressure on my back as if
someone was holding me to the bed. Frozen in fear I closed my eyes and
hoped it would go away. Soon enough I did not feel it but heard footsteps
outside my bedroom door. I soon fell asleep after that.</b>
<br><b>Another time was when me and my friend where home alone at about
11 o'clock. We where whatching TV when we heard the garage door open and
shut. My parents weren't going to be home till much later we were very
scared. To this day we still don't know about these stange happening and
yet they still happen. If you think you may know what it is please tell
me!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost Follows Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Eencinc@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>hi i have lived in a haunted house for 15 years it took a long time
for me</b>
<br><b>to</b>
<br><b>write this i read your story and it kind of shook me a bit. our
ghost only</b>
<br><b>bothered my brother and me my parents were unwilling to even disguss
the</b>
<br><b>subject. what seemed so familiar was the grouping of ghosts it had
a similar</b>
<br><b>feel. i don't live in the house any more but i have a lot of weird
little</b>
<br><b>habits because of it. i cant sleep unless others are in the house
or i am</b>
<br><b>completly covered no matter how hot it is. i hate constantly questioning
my</b>
<br><b>sanity because not every one saw or heard or felt these things.
i was</b>
<br><b>wondering if any of the entities that you encountered followed you
to your</b>
<br><b>newer houses or if you feel that the other intensities in other
places you</b>
<br><b>have lived have appeared to you. the first story is the most convincing
to</b>
<br><b>me</b>
<br><b>that this really is real i try to forget but it doesnt work so maybe
if you</b>
<br><b>can help me understand i can accept what happened in a&nbsp; more
healthy way. i</b>
<br><b>have trouble establishing my experience to any one belief system
and it is</b>
<br><b>very stressful for me.</b>
<br><b>when we first moved into the house i began hearing the sound of
footsteps</b>
<br><b>paseing in the hallway at night and heavy breathing. my brother
and i kept</b>
<br><b>out doors open mom and dad closed theirs. it would pace about 15
min.</b>
<br><b>dissapear for about 5 min (during which i would pray for it to go
away) then</b>
<br><b>it would return and stand at the foot of my bed sometimes sitting
on the</b>
<br><b>corner where i could feel its weight on the mattress without being
able to</b>
<br><b>see it. i would fall asleep terrified and trying to convince myself
it was</b>
<br><b>in</b>
<br><b>my head. during the day after about 2 weeks i began seeing small
figures in</b>
<br><b>the corner of my eye when i turned my head it would dissapear i
would walk</b>
<br><b>around the corner but nothing would be there they seemed to be located
near</b>
<br><b>the hall closet where there was an entry to the very small crawl
space under</b>
<br><b>the house. after seeing them frequently over 3 months i had a full
picture</b>
<br><b>of</b>
<br><b>them sort of like a 2.5 to 3 foot vikings. (god that sounds silly)
i ignored</b>
<br><b>it . i was ratiionalising that it was hot(summer) i am creative
and our new</b>
<br><b>home was in the country with no one for me to play with my mind
must be</b>
<br><b>bored</b>
<br><b>but it was so intense i didn't get any comfort.at 12 years old i
began</b>
<br><b>instinctively to place heavy objects on the lid of the cover. there
was one</b>
<br><b>that was different it was tall 5.5 feet very skinny and it moved
like smoke</b>
<br><b>it was a black silliuet only implied in shape. it always appeared
in the</b>
<br><b>entry hall when i was doing dishes. it was very slow to jump back.
sometimes</b>
<br><b>fully exposing itself in the enrtryway. anyway this keeps going
on and i was</b>
<br><b>very distressed and worried they would lock me up in a crazy house
if i</b>
<br><b>told.</b>
<br><b>when my 9 year old brother approached me and asked if i had seen
the "little</b>
<br><b>people" running around the house. in the years later we discovered
patterns</b>
<br><b>and seasons of it and small ways to control it. we saw a lot of
small things</b>
<br><b>that change form about every 6 months 2 apparitions and started
having, im</b>
<br><b>not sure how to describe it, other than psycic dreams and images.
we also</b>
<br><b>had</b>
<br><b>outside witnesses exchange students, and sleepover guests. what
really gets</b>
<br><b>me is that i keep seeing a ball about 6 inches around it changes
its</b>
<br><b>covering</b>
<br><b>it was orange plastic last now it is grey fur. i spot it at work
sometimes.</b>
<br><b>have you encountered anything like this? ive had one person tell
me that it</b>
<br><b>is a protector spirit. another&nbsp; told me that it was a soul
mate. i dont know</b>
<br><b>. i work in a pet store. lastime&nbsp; i saw it it rolled on the
ground about</b>
<br><b>3feet back and left of me and dissapeared into the base board i
saw it and</b>
<br><b>ignored it. later a cashier that was bored asked me if she could
help. i had</b>
<br><b>her scrub tanks she got near to the spot where i had seen the ball
go and</b>
<br><b>then she suddenly left. at the time i didnt think much of it, i
figured she</b>
<br><b>had gotten called onto the front and i finished the job. 2 days
later she</b>
<br><b>approached me and said im so sorry i left you the other day but
i was</b>
<br><b>cleaning a tank and all the sudden all these voices started going
off in my</b>
<br><b>head 'can you help me' it freaked me out so bad i just ran off!
then i put</b>
<br><b>together the positional likeness of the two events. wierd haw?</b>

<p><b>Do You Believe?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ROBANDKAREN@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, for those of you who do or do not believe
in ghosts, have I got one</b>
<br><b>for you!!!</b>
<br><b>This happened to me in the year 1989 in the state of Maine. I was
a sitter</b>
<br><b>and I went to old peoples homes and helped them in their daily routines.
The</b>
<br><b>house I was in was build back in the 1800s. The occupants were 2
young</b>
<br><b>sisters and the grandmother that I was helping. On interviewing
with the</b>
<br><b>young sisters they told me that if I see or hear anything unusual
to please</b>
<br><b>not be alarmed. Back in the 1800s there was a little boy that hung
himself in</b>
<br><b>one of the bedrooms upstairs. They told me that many times they
would hear</b>
<br><b>laughing, have nightly visits from him (standing at the end of the
bed), walk</b>
<br><b>through cold spots and will hear him playing with a ball. They also
told me</b>
<br><b>that sometimes dishes would crash to the floor when the little boy
was angry</b>
<br><b>I guess.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, the sisters decided to go shopping
and I was there alone in the</b>
<br><b>house with the old lady. We had put on a Fred Estair movie downstairs
in the</b>
<br><b>living room. Well, the games began after the sisters left. In the
corner of</b>
<br><b>my left eye, I could see something there. I felt like I was being
starred at</b>
<br><b>and I kept looking around to my left to see nothing. It caught my
eye again</b>
<br><b>and it was moving. I started to get scared and I just sat there
with the old</b>
<br><b>woman who was watching the TV and never saw what I did. Soon, after
that, I</b>
<br><b>heard something up stairs. It sounded like a ball was bouncing off
the wall,</b>
<br><b>like it was being thrown up against the wall and landed on the floor
again.</b>
<br><b>The went on for about 30 min. I was really scared and then the footsteps</b>
<br><b>began. They walked up and down the hall. Some steps were of running,
others</b>
<br><b>were of hard clip clops like on a hard wood floor (which they did
have) and</b>
<br><b>the ball was bouncing at the same time. Well, I just could not take
it</b>
<br><b>anymore so I told the old lady I was going to go to the bathroom
and I would</b>
<br><b>be back. I went to the bottom of the stairs and slowly with shaking
legs from</b>
<br><b>being nervous, I slowly went up the stairs. As I got halfway up
the stairs I</b>
<br><b>could see down the long hall and there was a ball in the middle
of the floor.</b>
<br><b>It was moving like it had been thrown down and left there cause
I guess the</b>
<br><b>little boy saw me and I heard running foot steps. I went back down
stairs</b>
<br><b>really scared and with my knees knocking I went back to the couch
and sat</b>
<br><b>there on the couch and did not move a muscle. The old lady did not
even know</b>
<br><b>what was going on cause she was so into the movie.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sisters returned I told them what
happened and they said to me</b>
<br><b>that they know about this and it happens all the time. They invited
me</b>
<br><b>upstairs to the room where the little boy killed himself. When entering
the</b>
<br><b>room, the hair on my arms stood up cause I was warm then all of
a sudden I</b>
<br><b>felt a rush of cold air and I mean bitter cold air. Its like walking
through</b>
<br><b>a breeze of a fan to describe it. Hot again then&nbsp; a rush of
cold air hitting</b>
<br><b>you like a knife. So, cold that you want to reach for a jacket.
That kind of</b>
<br><b>cold, and then I would walk a few more feet then warm again. I was
ready to</b>
<br><b>get out of there!!! The sisters told me that sometimes he comes
to visit them</b>
<br><b>in the night. One of the sisters awoke and she told me that she
saw a</b>
<br><b>silhouette of a boy standing at the end of her bed. He stood there
for the</b>
<br><b>longest time and then walked away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I go back to the house? Yes,
but with caution and I would take the</b>
<br><b>old lady on outings as much as I could to stay out of that house.
This is a</b>
<br><b>true story and this happened to me the summer of 1989. Hope you
have found</b>
<br><b>this interesting.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Great Grandmother is that you?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Blnksweetie182@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Sometimes late at night while I lay in my bed, I see things floating
by, or</b>
<br><b>something move out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; Whenever I see
this, I flick on</b>
<br><b>the light by my bed and it goes away, or I run out into the hallway
and then</b>
<br><b>slowly make my way back into my room and fall asleep.&nbsp; Sometimes,
I hear</b>
<br><b>footsteps after everyone else in the house is asleep.&nbsp; At first
I was scared</b>
<br><b>and didn't want to tell anyone about it because they would think
I was lying.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Being as I live in a new house, I figured there's nothing
there to haunt it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It got to where, one night a saw a figure leaning over me
while I was laying</b>
<br><b>in bed, I quickly flipped on my light and it disappeared.&nbsp;
Then the next</b>
<br><b>night I saw a figure floating over me.&nbsp; So, the next day I
told my parents</b>
<br><b>that I had been seeing things in my room and they told me that as
a child in</b>
<br><b>our old house, whenever they would take me past these! curtains
in their room,</b>
<br><b>I would start laughing and staring at the curtains, for no reason.&nbsp;
If I</b>
<br><b>started crying they only had to sit me in front of the curtains
to make me</b>
<br><b>laugh.&nbsp; So they think that when I was younger I could see something
there</b>
<br><b>that they didn't.&nbsp; I also had an experience when I went to
England when I was</b>
<br><b>in 9th grade.&nbsp; I've never heard anything try to contact me,
when the spirit</b>
<br><b>or whatever it is, is in human form it just looks at me, so I'm
not to sure</b>
<br><b>what its doing.&nbsp; If you have any ideas on what I should do
about it feel free</b>
<br><b>to e-mail me.&nbsp; I don't think its an evil ghost and I don't
want to cast it</b>
<br><b>away because I'm thinking it might be my great grandmother, but
I'm not sure.</b>

<p><b>Boiler Room Voice</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: btk_99@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is the second story I've contributed to this site, though the
first was</b>
<br><b>my own experience, while this is one my father only related to me
last week.</b>
<br><b>Like my experience, which took place over 10 years ago, this took
place at a</b>
<br><b>church where my father works. It's a church in the Chicago suburb
of Oak</b>
<br><b>Park that originally was built in the late 1860s, but burned down
in 1916</b>
<br><b>and was rebuilt on the original foundation. It's a massive looking,
somewhat</b>
<br><b>dull looking stone building, with a modern 1960s addition sticking
off to</b>
<br><b>the side like a sore thumb.</b>
<br><b>The boiler room is in a area of the basement called the Catacombs,
nicknamed</b>
<br><b>this due to the maze of passageways under the sanctuary which were</b>
<br><b>originally used to carry the coal heated air up thru various vents
in the</b>
<br><b>floor of the sanctuary (they stopped using coal in the 20s). The
boiler</b>
<br><b>room's walls are mostly dating the the mid 19th century church,
and parts of</b>
<br><b>the stone are still black. The center of the room contains the huge
old</b>
<br><b>boiler, and various pipes snaking across the low ceiling, and further
back,</b>
<br><b>more pipes and ancient machinery, all draped in cobwebs and dust.
On one</b>
<br><b>side of the boiler room are three arches leading to storage rooms,
which had</b>
<br><b>originally been coal storage areas. On the other side of the room,
is a</b>
<br><b>rickety wooden staircase leading down to the so-called Catacombs,
and behind</b>
<br><b>that an-always pitch-black area I've only seen close up once, with
piles of</b>
<br><b>old boxes, crates and who-knows what else.</b>
<br><b>My dad, who is the building superintedant, and his assistant Dan,
a guy in</b>
<br><b>his early 30s, were replacing a part of the boiler's machinery early
one</b>
<br><b>morning before anyone had come in yet (there are church offices
above the</b>
<br><b>boiler room, in the Sixties-era addition). My dad said he was having
a hard</b>
<br><b>time getting the part that had to be replaced off and was banging
on a nut</b>
<br><b>with a screwdriver, when it slipped and gauged his hand, no serious
injury,</b>
<br><b>but enough to draw blood and cause my dad to do something he doesn't</b>
<br><b>normally do, swear aloud.</b>
<br><b>"Sh**!" he shouted, and as Dan was asking him if he was okay, from
the</b>
<br><b>darkness behind the boiler, came the clear, deep voice of a man,</b>
<br><b>"Not nice!"</b>
<br><b>Both my dad and Dan looked at each other, then without thinking,
asked who</b>
<br><b>was back there, despite the fact that my dad had unlocked the metal
boiler</b>
<br><b>room door just about half an hour before. They both looked all over
the</b>
<br><b>boiler room after getting no reply, and of course, found no one.
Dan was a</b>
<br><b>bit freaked out, despite being a big and athletic guy, and told
my dad he</b>
<br><b>would go look for a band-aid for my dad, though my dad said he looked
pale</b>
<br><b>and nervous. My dad, on the other hand, was not freaked out, and
felt there</b>
<br><b>must be a logical reason for it, though he could not name one. Nothing
more</b>
<br><b>happened, and my father and Dan went about there business until
they were</b>
<br><b>done working on the boiler.</b>
<br><b>I myself have been in that room in the past, both with my dad and
alone, and</b>
<br><b>on each occaision, I've felt like from the dark corners, there were
unseen</b>
<br><b>eyes watching intently. It's definitely not a place I'd want to
spend too</b>
<br><b>much time in, especially alone.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Becoming a Believer</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jessica@baby.fsnet.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had two unexplained happenings in my life,maybe three but
as I was maybe five or six at the time I will put that down to a childhood
nightmare.</b>
<br><b>The first sighting of what I know to be a ghost was when I was thirty
two,just myself and another person on a building site which was in the
early stages of preparation, I saw a man walking at least one feet of the
ground, back towards me and wrapped in a blanket, many others had seen
or had been involved with this</b>
<br><b>apparation, and with it unexplained happenings.</b>
<br><b>It is the second one that really convinced me that these things
can be scary,you see when I saw the first Iwas amazed, I did not believe
or disbelieve, I didnt discuss the subject, I was not interested, I wnt
home that night and told my husband, amazed that I had seen this ghost,
so much so that I did not sleep for most of the night, I felt elated that
I must be one of however many people which had been shown something like
that.</b>
<br><b>However the second time was so very different that I would rather
not have been associated in any way with it.&nbsp; About two years after
my first encounter, my family and I had been living at a house, it was
a town house(I live in England) the garage is on the ground floor, and
the lounge and kitchen on the first, it was a terrace meaning that the
houses all joined onto one another, nothing remarkable just a very pleasant
cul-de-sac with a neighbour at each side, we had been living there a year
or so, on one side was a couple who had a daughter, on the other side was
a woman who had a son and daughter, both daughters were 16 years old the
son being 14, the mother with the son and daughter lived at the very end
so their house was not attached to another, and she was a very unhappy
women whose husband had left her about a year before we moved in, It had
happened out of the Blue and the shock had sent her a little over the edge,
prior to him leaving hea ha remorgaged part of the house so he was in quite
a lot of debt, but she could cope with that what she couldent mange to
accept was that he had left her, and as time went by she I think would
have done anything to have him back.</b>
<br><b>Probably the uncertainty of not knowing what might happen to her,
and the lack of self esteem drove her to do things that she otherwise would
not have done, but during that time she meddled with the ougee board, how
much I dont know for Im sure this was prior to us moving in and it was
only later that another neighbour confided in me, but she wanted so much
to know what the outcome of her life would be that she decided in her mind
that either his or her grandmother would give reassurances or help her
in some way, I dont know what she called up, but about a year after I moved
in she asked me to feed her cat,and Ican only say that on entering the
front door I scensed that I did not want to go in, I did but so uneasy
was I that my other neighbour had to continue to feed the cat during the
rest of the week, then the full story emerged from a neighbour further
down theroad that they Knew that something bad had entered the house and
she had got holy water to sit in the entrance to the house,Im sure that
it bears no relation although the girl that was freindly withe the separated
womens daughter and that had also taken part along withe the other children
in the sceance was murdered a couple of years later,but there were so many
happenings in the cul-de-sac that I often wonder, as you knew that something
would eventually happen, you often felt that you were part of a time bomb
just waiting to go off.</b>
<br><b>My story doesent end there, eventually the separated by now divorced
woman was forced to sell and move, an the next occupants went about renovating
the house into a beautiful home, however th entrance to the property between
the smell and the fact that the electricity never worked properly haunted
them, untill eventually they too had to move out, they did once ask me
if the house was haunted and I replied that I did not know, what else could
I have said, but ont hte day that they left they were elated and told me
that when they first put the house on the market and were seeing the estate
agent off they were confronted with the words shouted at them "Dont sell
this house" In a menacing tone, which scared them so much that they immediately
took it off the market, but a few months later decided to try again, and
within the week at sold, the sale went through very quickly and when the
next couple moved in they found so many chuch crossses dotted around the
place.</b>
<br><b>I dont know if they ever saw anything a few months later we moved,
although they stayed maybe two years and now the propery has had its third
owner in a little over ten years.</b>
<br><b>I dont know what went on in that house I dont know if she did get
some bad spirit, I did not like going in there, I do know that it was a
very unlucky little cul-de-sac and I do know that my house and the one
at the other end were the only houses out of eleven that some misfortune
had not befallen on, and I must say perhaps we were lucky to move on.</b>

<br><b>100 Percent True Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: david.brock2@ntlworld.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>its a story my mother told me years ago,we lived in a old railway
house in darlington 10 yards from the old train station ,where the first
train line was built.there were a set of six terrace houses</b>
<br><b>all had high staircases and huge kitchens with ranges in them,also
outside toilets and wash houses has they were called then.my mam every
night stood by the range and put her face cream on before going to bed,this
night her mam and dad had gone up first,the was only her and the dog,and
has she applied the cream she thought she heard a voice call her namewhich
was kath short for kathleen.she turned saw nothing but noticed the dog
had stood up with his ears pricked,again she applied the cream ,and the
voice a little bit louder shouted kath in a deep ominous tone.this time
she shouted upstairs to see what her parents had wanted,but there was no
answere,by this time the dog was walking nervously around with its head
lowered asif it had been told off.</b>
<br><b>my mam had finished applying her cream and was putting it away when
this time she knew it was not her parents calling her because the voice
was as loud as a clap of thunder bellowing her name,she ran upstairs screaming
explaining the was someone calling her .so my granparents went downstairs
to check the house only to find the dog covered in white frothy sweat,panting,eyes
wide open and absolutely petrified ,the dog died two days later.years later
when i was born,still in the same house,i had horrific dreams always the
same recurring dream,</b>
<br><b>at the start of the dream i was at the bottom of the stairs happily
floating to the top,it was pitch black at the top and i knew instantly
i had to stop ,but i couldnt</b>
<br><b>then i noticed someone dressed in black like a monk and woke at
this point,the thing is everybody has dreams ,but not the entire family
has the exact dream.</b>
<br><b>we never saw any ghosts but the house definately had a sense of
forboding about it,i think maybe even calling it the defination of something
evil.i would like to add its the only house my family talk about with anxiety.</b>

<br><b>Paranormal Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jennifer.schuler@wcom.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really know where to begin. It seems that
I have had some</b>
<br><b>sort of paranormal contact since I was a kid.&nbsp; I want to tell
you about</b>
<br><b>an experience I had when I rented a home in Belleville, Ill.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>incident happened during the time span of 10/95 - 10/96.&nbsp; I
lived there</b>
<br><b>with my husband and three children ages 4,10,12.&nbsp; My first
experience</b>
<br><b>was smelling coffee brewing in my sleep. I woke up thinking that
my</b>
<br><b>husband made a fresh pot of coffee. To my surprise there was none.
I</b>
<br><b>didn't mention this to anyone. Later that evening my husband said
that</b>
<br><b>when he got up for work he thought I got up to make coffee for him
and</b>
<br><b>was surprised to find none. Around the same time my daughter, age
10</b>
<br><b>said that she seen a woman on the steps, but what was funny was
that she</b>
<br><b>could only see the bottom half. she was wearing a skirt. and another</b>
<br><b>time she swore that she seen a woman sitting on the steps. I mentioned</b>
<br><b>this to my mother and she said that maybe she is a friendly spirit
and</b>
<br><b>that she was welcoming us into her home that why we smelled the
coffee.</b>
<br><b>I figured this made sense.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As time went on it seemed that things got a bit
stranger. I would</b>
<br><b>usually get up with my husband to either make him breakfast or to
just</b>
<br><b>have a cup of coffee with him. When he would leave I would go back
to</b>
<br><b>bed. Well that's when I would hear the strange sounds. Above my
room was</b>
<br><b>my eldest daughters room. I would hear sounds of furniture scooting</b>
<br><b>around (that's what it sounded like) or as if a ball was being rolled</b>
<br><b>across the floor. I kept putting it off as my imagination and as
read</b>
<br><b>many times before I questioned my sanity. There were times that
I felt</b>
<br><b>as if there was a presence in the room with me. I would hear breathing</b>
<br><b>and at times it sounded as if there was a beating noise (like a</b>
<br><b>heartbeat) but I couldn't pinpoint the location, it was all around
me. I</b>
<br><b>held my breath to assure it wasn't mine. Well i finally told my
husband</b>
<br><b>and he didn't believe me. Of course. So one morning I told myself
I was</b>
<br><b>going to be prepared. I had a flashlight by my bed and as soon as
my</b>
<br><b>husband left I went to bed like always and I waited for the sounds
to</b>
<br><b>come. Like clockwork they were right on time. I summed up the nerve
to</b>
<br><b>creep up the stairs and enter my daughters room. I was very scared</b>
<br><b>needless to say. I entered her room only to find nothing. I figured
when</b>
<br><b>they wanted me to see them they would show themselves.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got used to the noise, but my kids were afraid
to stay there by</b>
<br><b>themselves. My eldest daughter says she was sleeping one night to
awake</b>
<br><b>from the sound of a door closing. She assumed that it was me. She
said</b>
<br><b>that she could hear the footsteps come up the stairs and she said
that</b>
<br><b>she seen a light, like a flashlight. She got scared then because
she</b>
<br><b>thought someone had broke in. The noise and the light disappeared
at her</b>
<br><b>door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This next instance is what convinced my husband
that there was</b>
<br><b>something other than us living there. We were taking a shower. Now
our</b>
<br><b>bathroom is located off the foyer of the front door. Directly above
the</b>
<br><b>bathroom is the dormer or open area of the upstairs. Beside the
bathroom</b>
<br><b>is the steps that go down to the basement. (There is no door, it
is an</b>
<br><b>open staircase) Beside that is the stairs going up to the second
floor</b>
<br><b>and the kitchen. This house was laid out somewhat odd. Well we had
just</b>
<br><b>finished showering and we could hear footsteps coming from the upper</b>
<br><b>level. We automatically thought it might be Tara (our eldest) because
of</b>
<br><b>the location from where they started. We followed them as they walked</b>
<br><b>down the steps. We could hear each footstep as it made its way to
the</b>
<br><b>last step and into the foyer! I immediately reached over and shut
the</b>
<br><b>door and said "Hold on Tara we'll be out in a minute." It couldn't
have</b>
<br><b>been 2 minutes I opened the door to find no one there! To this day
my</b>
<br><b>husband is now a believer in the supernatural. I found that the
house</b>
<br><b>was built in 1928 and it was an aunt to the elderly lady next door.</b>
<br><b>Since it was a relative I felt odd telling her that we had some
weird</b>
<br><b>experiences there. The center of activity seemed to come from the
small</b>
<br><b>bedroom on the second floor. I had seen the blinds move one time
from</b>
<br><b>the driveway as if they were pulled back a little then released
as if</b>
<br><b>someone was looking out at me. The spirit in the home was never</b>
<br><b>aggressive. I told my children not to be afraid of her. If she wanted
to</b>
<br><b>harm us she would have done so by now. I just think that she wanted
to</b>
<br><b>be part of the family in some way.</b>

<p><b>Haunting or Just going Crazy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: marbear1007@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My story starts a little over a year ago. My Family,</b>
<br><b>after living in the same home for 15 years, moved into</b>
<br><b>a larger house. I was 20 at the time, so I didn't feel</b>
<br><b>too nervous about the new house. Everything was normal</b>
<br><b>at first. I had never really seen anything unusual at</b>
<br><b>our old house, other than a rare feeling of something</b>
<br><b>odd, but it would leave as soon as it started. A few</b>
<br><b>months after we had lived in the new house, I began to</b>
<br><b>get a feeling of dread every time I walked up the</b>
<br><b>stairs to my bedroom. As you come up the stairs, to</b>
<br><b>the left is a loft, and then the hallway to the</b>
<br><b>bedrooms. the first few nights I got this feeling, I</b>
<br><b>would just walk faster, and avoid lookink into the</b>
<br><b>loft. As the weeks went on, things got worse. I</b>
<br><b>couldn't walk up the stairs with out an intense</b>
<br><b>feeling a sadness, one night I actually started</b>
<br><b>crying, and I never knew why. For awhile I would feel</b>
<br><b>safe once I got to my room, but that too changed. A</b>
<br><b>few nights I would feel as if right as I drifted to</b>
<br><b>sleep, someone was there. One night, as I laid there</b>
<br><b>praying to fall asleep soon, I actually heard and felt</b>
<br><b>the breath of someone scream right into my ear, but no</b>
<br><b>one was there. Another night, as I lay there, once</b>
<br><b>again praying to go to sleep, I felt something slap my</b>
<br><b>leg.I also was unable to ever go to the basement</b>
<br><b>alone. I never knew why, but the same feeling of dread</b>
<br><b>would come over me as I approached the basement. One</b>
<br><b>day as I sat on the computer, I saw the image of a</b>
<br><b>person pass behind me, reflected in the screen,</b>
<br><b>thinking it was my mom, passing by, I looked but there</b>
<br><b>was no one there. No one else was home, besides my mom</b>
<br><b>and I, and she was sound asleep upstairs. then there</b>
<br><b>was another night when I was watching tv with my</b>
<br><b>fiancee. We heard my sister (who's room was right off</b>
<br><b>the living room) yell "Who are you? Get the Hell out!"</b>
<br><b>I went into her room, and tried to wake her, but she</b>
<br><b>was fast asleep. my fiancee and I laughed it off,</b>
<br><b>seeing as how she sometimes talks in her sleep. The</b>
<br><b>next morning she told my parents about the weird dream</b>
<br><b>she had of a man standing at the foot of her bed,</b>
<br><b>staring at her, and when she said those words he just</b>
<br><b>grinned and turned and walked out. She recalls it</b>
<br><b>vividly, and keeps saying it did not really feel like</b>
<br><b>a dream, but then again, she denies that it was real.</b>
<br><b>I tried many times to walk through the house</b>
<br><b>commanding it to leave, in the name of Jesus Christ,</b>
<br><b>but the nights after I would try it, it seemed to get</b>
<br><b>worse. I finally told my friend, and she immediately</b>
<br><b>went into the basement. I did not go with her, and to</b>
<br><b>this day do not know what she said or did, but for the</b>
<br><b>most part i have not been bothered. I have since moved</b>
<br><b>out of the house, but I have began to get that same</b>
<br><b>feeling of dread in my apartment, even in broad</b>
<br><b>daylight</b>

<p><b>My Haunting Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: princessjewels13@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was at camp for 6th grade and our teachers told us a</b>
<br><b>story about an old guy that was in a way murdered at</b>
<br><b>the camp.&nbsp; He owned the camp and he lived in an old</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; One night some kids thought it would be funny</b>
<br><b>to scare the old man and throw rocks at his window.</b>
<br><b>Now the old man used a candle for light and one of the</b>
<br><b>rocks hit the candle and set the house a fire and the</b>
<br><b>old man died.&nbsp; Now one day a long time after one of</b>
<br><b>the counslers went back into the house.&nbsp; In the</b>
<br><b>basement he discovered many weird things but the</b>
<br><b>strangest was these very humongous size 18 1940's</b>
<br><b>boots.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was only one there.&nbsp; So he took
it</b>
<br><b>with him and decided to head back.&nbsp; Well the next day</b>
<br><b>he came back and on his way there he saw these</b>
<br><b>humongous 18 size shoe prints in the mud so he looked</b>
<br><b>at them carefully and saw the 1940's sigh on them but,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;he had picked up the shoe and taken it to his house</b>
<br><b>15 miles from there.&nbsp; Then a few years later he took</b>
<br><b>some kids back there to the house.&nbsp; While they were in</b>
<br><b>the basement and just about ready to leave,&nbsp; the flash</b>
<br><b>lights died on them.&nbsp; Then they went to run out the</b>
<br><b>door but when they got there it was locked.&nbsp; They were</b>
<br><b>trapped in there for 20 minutes and finally went back</b>
<br><b>screaming.&nbsp; Well while I was at camp I not only saw</b>
<br><b>the shoe prints outside my door to the cabin but later</b>
<br><b>that night I went to go visit some of my friends and I</b>
<br><b>swear to god I saw the old man he said but not one</b>
<br><b>word.&nbsp; Some kids came right after he had left and I</b>
<br><b>decided not to tell them.&nbsp; Then on the last night I</b>
<br><b>woke my friend up so we could go to the bathroom.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>opened the door and there right in front of us was the</b>
<br><b>old man.&nbsp; This time he spoke.&nbsp; But in a strange</b>
<br><b>language and me and my friend just stood there in awe</b>
<br><b>at to what had happened.&nbsp; Then of course we headed to</b>
<br><b>the bathroom when right when we got there we realized</b>
<br><b>we were lost and very scared and when we went in and</b>
<br><b>realized it was not the bathroom there was the old man</b>
<br><b>and this time he said "Nobody ever comes in and nobody</b>
<br><b>ever comes out."&nbsp; Then the door slammed shut we</b>
<br><b>screamed and after we recovered from our 5 second</b>
<br><b>panic&nbsp; we opened the door and ran back to the cabin</b>

<p><b>What The !*#! Was That Thing?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kblarson@uswest.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, my mother and I were discussing
books and "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" by Stephen King, became the topic
of conversation.&nbsp; My mother stated that she wondered as she read that
story if Mr. King had experienced something which may have lead to this
story?&nbsp; This question reminded me of a terrifying experience I had
when I was child. As I would soon find out, I was not the only one to have
experienced something.&nbsp; The validation came that it was not an over-active
imagination.&nbsp; Then again, I already knew that. :)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I begin, I would like to state for
the record that I don't&nbsp; believe in Bigfoot and even if I did...Bigfoot
was NOT what I saw.&nbsp; This was different.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We lived in Southern Maine until I was
almost ten.&nbsp; By the time my younger brother and I were well into grade
school, both of my parents were working.&nbsp; My dad full time, just like
always, and my mother part-time.&nbsp; They didn't want us home alone.&nbsp;
They tried to coordinate their schedules so that one of them would always
be home with us within 10 or 15 minutes of the bus dropping us off after
school.&nbsp; I had a house key (of course!) and about the only thing we
had to do was to let out two dogs outside for a few minutes...for obvious
reasons.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't remember much about the day leading
up to this experience except that is was fall, fairly cool outside, and
it had been a perfectly normal day.&nbsp; We got off the school bus as
always and proceeded to walk around to the back of the house to let ourselves
inside.&nbsp; The dogs anxiously greeted us and as usual, my brother refused
to help me let them out.&nbsp; Our Shepard was a good dog and she wouldn't
run away with out a leash as long as one of us was outside with her.&nbsp;
Our Collie was still a puppy and had no sense about her at all.&nbsp; We
had one of those long runs which led from the back deck out to a large
tree in the back yard. I tied "Lady" up to the run and the Shepard scooted
off to do her business. I stood on the porch quietly waiting for them to
finish...just like always.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of minutes passed and like my
normal self, I was a little impatient waiting for the dogs.&nbsp; Even
then, even though I love our two , I was not much of a dog type person.&nbsp;
Our Shepard shot passed me and back into the house the second I called
her. Our Collie would not come to me no matter how much I called to her.&nbsp;
She had caught wind of something and had her snoopy nose to the ground,
choosing to ignore me completely.&nbsp; Just as I moved to run down the
stairs to get her, I heard something from the woods in front of me.&nbsp;
We lived on a heavily wooded acre of land.&nbsp; Although we had neighbors
on all sides...we were in the country and we all had woods surrounding
our houses.&nbsp; I remember looking up at the sound and immediately froze.&nbsp;
What I heard were huge (giant) footsteps and what I saw was something that
looked like a HUGE man with something white over his head and green clothing.&nbsp;
Sounds an awful lot like Friday the 13th right?&nbsp; I was 8 and a 1/2.&nbsp;
I had not seen Friday the 13th and Jason was unknown to me.&nbsp; This
man or thing had to stand at least nine feet tall and it sounded like he
was simply stepping on fallen trees and snapping them in half.&nbsp; I
could feel the vibrations of his footsteps from the deck.&nbsp; A couple
of seconds felt like an eternity and I could not move.&nbsp; I simply stood
there watching this thing in the small clearing behind our wood shed.&nbsp;
He or it stormed through our woods like he meant business.&nbsp; I tried
to call to Lady but I could not make my voice work.&nbsp; I remember praying;
"Please don't let him see me...don't let him see me...Don't..."&nbsp; I
don't remember how, but I managed to quickly get of the porch, grab Lady
and pull her into the house as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Funny thing,
this dog loved to bark.&nbsp; She didn't make one single sound.&nbsp; I
locked the door behind us and waited for dad.&nbsp; It was his day to come
home early.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told my brother.&nbsp; He was 7 and told
me that he was going to tell on me for trying to scare him.&nbsp; He was
too young to realize that I was not joking around.&nbsp; Not five minutes
later, dad arrived.&nbsp; I bombarded him with my story the second he walked
through the door.&nbsp; He looked concerned but he told me I must have
seen a moose or I was remembering a bad dream.&nbsp; It was no dream. It
was not a moose.&nbsp; I was really mad at him for not listening to me...this
was not like him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was telling my mom this story (I am
now almost 27 and remember that experience as though it just happened)
she smiled and said "Dad believed you, he just didn't want you to be scared.&nbsp;
He saw something once too ."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad used to chop our firewood.&nbsp; We
had a large house and two wood stoves along with our furnace.&nbsp; He
spent a lot of time in the woods behind our house chopping wood.&nbsp;
He always seemed to love it according to my mom...until one late afternoon.&nbsp;
She says it must have been about a year before I saw the thing in the woods.
As she spoke, I did sort of remember this incident.&nbsp; What I remembered
was the day that my dad came walking (sort of running) out of the woods.&nbsp;
It again was autumn (I don't remember the weather...mom told me) and it
spooked me, thus my memory.&nbsp; My dad is not one to get spooked very
easily. He is very level headed...he's an MSW. He is not a stupid man by
any means. He shot up the deck and into the house like a bullet and bluntly
stated "Something's out there!&nbsp; I'm not going back out there again!"&nbsp;
Mom asked him what it was he saw and he stated "I don't know what the hell
it was but it was big!"&nbsp; Mom asked him if it was an animal.&nbsp;
Dad slowly calming down but still pretty agitated said that he thought
at first that it might have been a moose (big foot steps) or a buck.&nbsp;
He even wondered if it was a bear.&nbsp; When he looked to see what it
was, all he knew what that it wasn't an animal.&nbsp; He also knew that
his gut was telling him to get out of the woods NOW!&nbsp; Eventually dad
got his courage up to head out to the woods for more firewood again, but
it was a good two or three weeks after that incident.&nbsp; To my knowledge,
he never saw it again.&nbsp; My grandmother did though!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our land had been divided up between my
grandparents and my parents.&nbsp; We were literally around the corner
from them.&nbsp; Quite frequently we would tromp through the woods to their
house...especially when we were too little to walk down the road by ourselves.&nbsp;
We had a tree house&nbsp; that could be seen by both my parents and my
grandparents.&nbsp; Everyone could hear us which meant that everyone could
and did keep an eye on us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One afternoon my grandmother had been outside
working in her small flower garden when she heard something. She heard
foot steps and the cracking of branches.&nbsp; Thinking it was me (I was
always sneaking over to see her) she stood up and saw instead what she
could only refer to as "a monster".&nbsp; She, like dad and me, could not
figure out what it was.&nbsp; She said it looked in her direction and just
kept going.&nbsp; My grandmother ran inside, locked the doors and refused
to step outside for a couple of days.&nbsp; To this day she does not know
what it was.&nbsp; She still calls it a monster.&nbsp; For the record,
I would also like to say that she had no prior knowledge of this "thing".&nbsp;
Dad never told her about what he saw.&nbsp; For one thing, he had felt
silly.&nbsp; Secondly, he didn't want to frighten my grandmother.&nbsp;
I was little, so no one believed me.&nbsp; At least, not that they would
admit.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully realize that this is not your average
ghost story.&nbsp; It's more like an X-Files case but the difference is
that it is all true.&nbsp; One last thing to write about.&nbsp; This is
sort of a ghost story but it also happened at my old house in Maine.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When mom and I got on this topic of conversation,
I came out and asked her if our land or house had been haunted.&nbsp; This
question was honest because as a child, I would be disturbed by my bed
shaking.&nbsp; Psychologists like to explain this away by blaming involuntary
twitching in our sleep.&nbsp; I majored in psychology, I'm well aware of
the theories.&nbsp; I however, didn't have to be asleep for this to happen.&nbsp;
My bed shook regardless.</b>
<br><b>Mom recalled one night when my dad had been working late.&nbsp;
While he attended college, he had been a security guard at the ship yard
in Portsmouth, NH.&nbsp; He worked swing and mom would often wait up for
him.&nbsp; One night, my mom sat in our lower living room watching TV.when
she saw something out of the corner of her eye through one of the windows.&nbsp;
She saw a floating ball of light.&nbsp; She thought her eyes were playing
tricks on her and got up to see if she was really seeing this.&nbsp; This
little "orb" floated past all four of the windows and just disappeared.</b>
<br><b>Her answer to my question?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Our house and land were
haunted.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Baker Hotel</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RHop169812@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1930's through the 1950's, the Baker
Hotel in Mineral Wells,</b>
<br><b>Texas, about 45 miles west of Ft. Worth, was synonomous with Hollywood
and</b>
<br><b>National celebreties.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Baker Hotel was opened in 1929 and quickly
became one of the nations</b>
<br><b>leading health spas.&nbsp; Over 100,000 people visited Mineral Wells
each year</b>
<br><b>during its heyday due directly to the medicinal values of the local
spring</b>
<br><b>fed mineral waters.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many well known folks signed the desk register
of the Baker Hotel; Clark</b>
<br><b>Gable, Marlena Deitrich,&nbsp; The Three Stooges, Ronald Reagan,
Judy Garland,</b>
<br><b>Will Rogers, and Mary Martin, just to name a few.&nbsp; Lawrence
Welke once</b>
<br><b>remarked that the Baker was one of the finest Hotels he ever played.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Baker closed its door to the public in 1970
and has sat like a stone</b>
<br><b>giant, 15 stories high and two city blocks wide.&nbsp; Many attempts
have failed</b>
<br><b>in the last 30 years to reopen the once famous hotel and the present
guests</b>
<br><b>perhaps like it better that way.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first reported hauntings of the Baker reportedly
began in the days</b>
<br><b>before it ever closed.&nbsp; Several bell men and other staff reported
seeing the</b>
<br><b>ghost of a young woman many times on the seventh floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime in the 1930's a young woman, possibly
a prostitute was reported</b>
<br><b>to have jumped to her death from the Baker.&nbsp; Her room was located
in the</b>
<br><b>southeast corner of the seventh floor.&nbsp; Many have said her
spirit seems to be</b>
<br><b>a bit flirty and will follow men down the corridor.&nbsp; Another
story is told of</b>
<br><b>a young woman who died in the building and no one knew her identity
so the</b>
<br><b>hotel placed her body in a front window in hopes that someone would
identify</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; It is not known if the two women are one in the same.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1953, a young bell boy was tragically crushed
by a frieght elevator in</b>
<br><b>the basement of the hotel.&nbsp; Some reported that the boys body
was actually</b>
<br><b>severed in two by the elevator and that his bottom half has been
seen</b>
<br><b>recently walking in the basement area.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One phsycic reported that there are, at present
count, 49 known spirits</b>
<br><b>still bound in the building.&nbsp; One is that of a young boy who
died of leukemia</b>
<br><b>while living in an apartment at the hotel during the 1930's.&nbsp;
The ghost of</b>
<br><b>the boy, the physhic reported, is watched over by an older, unidentified,</b>
<br><b>woman.&nbsp; She went on to add that most of the ghosts at the Baker
are there</b>
<br><b>because the Baker was a place of wonderful times in their lives.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fall of 2000, a paranormal investigator
group from Dallas/Ft.</b>
<br><b>Worth visited the hotel and reported finding several very interesting</b>
<br><b>phenomena in the building but at time of this story had not concluded
their</b>
<br><b>investigation and were pretty tight lipped but excited about their
soon to be</b>
<br><b>released report.</b>

<p><b>Poltergeist</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: asmodeusdream@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I recall a time only a few years ago when I was 16(I think), I was
sitting</b>
<br><b>at home watching the Television and I got a weird feeling,&nbsp;
This wasn't</b>
<br><b>anything out of the ordinary I ALWAYS get weird feelings.&nbsp;
I was on the</b>
<br><b>couch to the left of me there was a lamp that hadn't worked for
years,(It</b>
<br><b>just looked kind cool). I live in a tri level house. on my right
was the</b>
<br><b>second level, you can see it clearly due to the opening between
the floors.</b>
<br><b>The Christmas tree was on that level. Any way as I was sitting there
The</b>
<br><b>lamp turned on! At first I was scared but I figured that it was
just a short</b>
<br><b>in the lamp wiring.&nbsp; But two minutes later my Television shut
off.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>starting to get kinda spooked now because I didn't have anything
to detour</b>
<br><b>my attention away from being scared. But I heard a noise on the
second level</b>
<br><b>and as I looked up I saw the ornaments falling off the tree one
by one.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>would slowly move horizontal from the tree that drop at falling
speed.&nbsp; Then</b>
<br><b>I finally broke out and started talking" Look I know that you're
there and I</b>
<br><b>know that you are trying to get my attention, You got it I see you're
there</b>
<br><b>but I'm not liking this one bit I'm trying to watch TV and I'll
thank you to</b>
<br><b>leave me alone!", as soon as I said that the ornaments stopped the
TV turned</b>
<br><b>back on and the lamp shut off.&nbsp; I looked at the lamp and tried
to turn it on</b>
<br><b>manually and it didn't work so I followed the chord and it wasn't
even</b>
<br><b>plugged in!</b>

<p><b>Knitting Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DCRAWFORD@ci.baton-rouge.la.us</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Although I did not experience this first-hand, it was told to me
by the</b>
<br><b>eyewitness, whose story became increasingly credible as she went
along.</b>
<br><b>After you read this you'll understand.</b>
<br><b>I live in Baton Rouge, LA.&nbsp; One evening recently, I stopped
at a local</b>
<br><b>coffeehouse after work to meet a few friends.&nbsp; They had not
yet arrived, so</b>
<br><b>I got my coffee and claimed a table.</b>
<br><b>I enjoy knitting, so I usually carry a small project in my tote
bag.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>pulled out my project (a pair of hiking socks) and began knitting.</b>
<br><b>After a few moments, I noticed that a woman at the adjacent table
was</b>
<br><b>watching me very intensely.&nbsp; After a few moments, she said,
"Excuse me, but</b>
<br><b>with so many needles, is that knitting, or crochet, or what?"&nbsp;
I explained</b>
<br><b>that I was knitting, showed her my work, and explained that socks
are done</b>
<br><b>in the round, requiring the use of several needles.</b>
<br><b>The woman replied that she didn't know how to knit or crochet, and
had</b>
<br><b>always assumed that knitting involved using two needles and murmuring
"knit</b>
<br><b>one, purl two."&nbsp; Then she said, "There's a reason I'm asking.&nbsp;
You're not</b>
<br><b>going to believe this, but..."</b>
<br><b>She then went on to explain that several years ago, she was living
in a very</b>
<br><b>old house downtown that had been divided into apartments.&nbsp;
She lived</b>
<br><b>upstairs.&nbsp; One winter morning, just before dawn, she was awakened
by a</b>
<br><b>sensation of extreme cold.&nbsp; She could also hear a soft clicking
noise.</b>
<br><b>Thinking the furnace had gone out, she woke up.&nbsp; As she opened
her eyes, she</b>
<br><b>saw a figure standing across the room.&nbsp; It was the figure of
a pretty young</b>
<br><b>woman, wearing a turn-of-the-century dress, standing at the window
and</b>
<br><b>gazing outside with a worried look on her face.&nbsp; And the ghost&nbsp;
was busy</b>
<br><b>knitting what appeared to be a long sock or stocking.</b>
<br><b>The woman said she was too scared to move, and that she viewed this</b>
<br><b>apparition for at least a minute or two, possibly longer, before
it faded</b>
<br><b>and disappeared.&nbsp; She noticed that the ghost was using "really
thin yarn and</b>
<br><b>shiny silver needles" and that at one point "a needle came out of
her work</b>
<br><b>and she put it back in."</b>
<br><b>This gave the story credibility, because this woman was describing
a</b>
<br><b>knitting technique that a non-knitter would not have known about.&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>also describing archaic knitting needles.&nbsp; Very few non-knitters
know that</b>
<br><b>multiple needles are involved in knitting tubular items like socks--and</b>
<br><b>indeed, an empty needle comes out of the knitting, and is worked
back in.</b>
<br><b>Even fewer know that turn-of-the-century needles were made of steel,
which</b>
<br><b>would have appeared to be "shiny, silver needles" as viewed by the</b>
<br><b>streetlight coming in the window -- modern knitting needles are
usually made</b>
<br><b>of plastic or adonized aluminum, both having a matte finish, usually
in a</b>
<br><b>non-silver color.&nbsp; The description of "really thin yarn" would
also have</b>
<br><b>been consistent with popular knitting of the turn of the century.&nbsp;
Most</b>
<br><b>popular patterns were done in much thinner yarn, and worked on much
finer</b>
<br><b>needles, than the typical modern knitter is willing to deal with.</b><b></b>

<p><b>1, 2, 3 And You're Dead</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BubbleGirl@kc.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in fourth grade at the time the strange phenomenon
interacted with me. I am now in 7th grade at New Mark Middle School. I
still see April and Johnny. They were the ghosts me (Cami), Ashley, Christy
and Sarah saw. It all started in the third grade during recess. We were
all obsessed with s&eacute;ances, ghosts, and all the other inhuman like
things. We were all best friends and did and always will do every thing
together. Other than Christy…</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; One day at recess my best friends and I were having
a s&eacute;ance and we asked for the spirit to show itself. It did in a
way, and in a very harsh manner.&nbsp; It took Christy and smashed her
into a tree. We could tell it was mad even though we could not see it.
Christy broke her neck and got sent to the hospital. The school blamed
it on Ashley, Sarah and I, so we got sent to juvenile for three months.
It seems hard to believe but I’m serious. Christy went to a private school,
St. Charles. Well, after we got out of juvenile we went back to school
and every thing was back to normal, until fourth grade that is.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The next year we had all forgotten about it, well,
other than the fact that we couldn’t see Christy anymore. Well, once again
we were at recess and we were on the monkey bars seeing who could do the
most pull ups. Ashley screamed and fell to the ground. She said she saw
two people in the nature trail. They were all white and some red. The red
was blood. Well, she wouldn’t of screamed by seeing those two ghosts, she
would have thought that would have been really cool. But she screamed because
they pointed at us and held up a 1. Well, luckily we were having a sleepover
that night so we could talk about it. That night we went on the Internet
to check on some of this stuff because we forgot about everything on summer
vacation. So we found every thing out again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The next Monday we were at recess again and we saw
the two people. We went down to the nature trail and we got to talk to
them. They were married and died in a car wreck. They were then 30 and
31. We asked why they pointed at us and they said that’s a sign that were
going to kill you. They were bad ghosts. They said when they got to three
than they would kill you. So while we were standing right in front of them
they held up a 2. We heard the whistle to go inside. We didn’t go inside.
We asked them other questions like what there names were and where they
worked and small things like that. We saw the bus come and we hurried up
to the bus without our backpacks or any thing. We all said our good byes
and got on our separate busses.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashley and Sarah never saw the ghosts again. I do see
them in those woods sometimes just looking for another kid to pick on I
guess. My friends and I never talk about them nor do we do s&eacute;ances
anymore. And if we do ever do them again I’m only contacting people that
died I know or I’m leaving that persons house or making everyone else leave.</b>

<p><b>A Childs Cry?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cleatus1999@gateway.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My experiences with the the little boy who lived at one time (alive)
at the</b>
<br><b>"children's home" continued for some months before I&nbsp; was transferred
to</b>
<br><b>another place to work.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say
he because I feel (still to this day) that the spirit is a</b>
<br><b>child around 5 or 6 and is male. As I had previously mentioned,
we could hear</b>
<br><b>him chatter and&nbsp; a friend/co-worker also heard him call my
name.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We
got use to hearing him run through the halls on quite a few</b>
<br><b>occasions, and hearing the jibber/jabber of&nbsp; a little one in
that building. I</b>
<br><b>got very interested in finding out who he was and I did find a couple
of</b>
<br><b>facts that only peeked my intrest.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
major thing is that back in the50's or early 60's my friend's</b>
<br><b>boyfriend lived in the home. I learned from them that at the time
the kids</b>
<br><b>who lived there grew thier own food livestock and vegs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the grounds there was a grain bin that was not in use and the</b>
<br><b>boys used it as a swimming pool. The boy-friend told me that a young
boy was</b>
<br><b>drown there. His death was maybe a accident this I'll never know.
What I do</b>
<br><b>feel is that a young boy is trapped there. Maybe someone can find

<p><b>The Haunted Church</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Deepness98@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many of us, I have had a number of weird
experiences in my life</b>
<br><b>which have convinced me that there is something real about ghosts
and the</b>
<br><b>afterlife. I'd like to share one story with you.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened about five years ago when I was
still living in England. My</b>
<br><b>girlfriend and I used to love to visit old churches, and would often
pick a</b>
<br><b>new way to travel to a familiar destination, just to see what we
could fine.</b>
<br><b>And so, one winter's afternoon, we found ourselves winding up the
A146 (I</b>
<br><b>believe?) through Suffolk on the way home to Norwich.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a cold January day and the light was soon
going to fail</b>
<br><b>completely, so we looked eagerly around for an old church to drop
into,</b>
<br><b>before hightailing it home for a fire and warm bed. We were in the
village of</b>
<br><b>Stoneham Magna, and noticed an old (mostly 15th Century) church
by the side</b>
<br><b>of a farm. We dropped in...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing we noticed was that it was so,
so cold. Okay, January in</b>
<br><b>England is cold anyway, but this church seemed far colder than the
dusk</b>
<br><b>outside - I remember glancing at a thermometer on the wall because
it just</b>
<br><b>felt too cold...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally by this time the girlfriend and I are
walking around spotting</b>
<br><b>Saxon architecture or Tudor pews with glee (it is an acquired taste).
This</b>
<br><b>time we walked around in silence. And not a word was said between
us until we</b>
<br><b>left. There was a great tension to the building, as if we were not
alone and,</b>
<br><b>above all, we felt we were intruding.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the pews we noticed something we
had never seen before. The</b>
<br><b>last few pews on the left-hand side were walled off with wooden
partitions.</b>
<br><b>Thick, old glass panels would have allowed a poor view of the service,
but it</b>
<br><b>seemed that the intent was to separate some parishioners from the
rest of the</b>
<br><b>church. Being the adventurous types of course we had to investigate,
so</b>
<br><b>walked in silence down to the thick, velvet curtain that separated
the</b>
<br><b>partition from the rest of the nave.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second my girlfriend touched the curtain
she turned to me white as a</b>
<br><b>sheet, telling me we had to get out. Without a moment's hesitation
I agreed,</b>
<br><b>and we ran out of there as fast as we could. Why? Well, she told
me later</b>
<br><b>that she had heard a voice in her head, telling her to "Get out!".
I didn't</b>
<br><b>hear anything, but I felt it at the same time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have often wondered what it was - we even
contacted the local diocese</b>
<br><b>with no luck. We both think that it was human, but was certainly
intensely</b>
<br><b>angry and possessive. But why possessive of a church? We also had
a long-term</b>
<br><b>reaction, similar to many other stories here, that in some way the
spirit had</b>
<br><b>'attacked' us that day, as real as if we had been mugged...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many folks on these boards, I am a rational
guy - actually a</b>
<br><b>scientist and deal with logical data analysis every day. But any
scientist</b>
<br><b>will tell you that when you get weird data that defies all logic,
perhaps it</b>
<br><b>is time to start checking the logic? The truth is out there, guys...</b><b></b>

<p><b>Birthday Balloon</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; sookeyk@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>About a week ago or so, Me and my family were eating dinner when
my brother's</b>
<br><b>birthday balloon started mysteriously floated all the way from his
room, down</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;stairs, and into the kitchen. My mom and my brother started
laughing and</b>
<br><b>saying " A ghost! Hahahahah!" I wasn't laughing. I've been playing
games like</b>
<br><b>AMBER JOURNEYS BEYOND. And reading books like, HAUNTED KIDS TRUE
GHOST</b>
<br><b>STORIES. My brother went over to the helium balloon and started
punching it</b>
<br><b>saying " GHOST! GHOST! Hahahaha!" My mom didn't care about the balloon
so she</b>
<br><b>took a butter knife and sliced the balloon in half. later when my
bro and my</b>
<br><b>mom were taking the dog for a walk, the sliced balloon was lying
in the den</b>
<br><b>next to the open door where i was playing computer. At the corner
of my eye,</b>
<br><b>i saw a black thing from it's waist up, twist around the corner
of the the</b>
<br><b>wall, grab the balloon, and rush away in the blink of an eye. I
was freaked,</b>
<br><b>so i waited out-side for my family to return. Now I know ghosts
aren't black,</b>
<br><b>But it had to be something, on a count of my dad was still working
as a</b>
<br><b>camera man. Soon i forgot about it. Until one day when i was on
my way out of</b>
<br><b>my room, i was just about to take the first step down the stairs,
when i</b>
<br><b>heard a laugh coming from my mom's room that was right next to the
stairs. It</b>
<br><b>wasn't my mom, my dad, or my brother. It sounded like a squiling
laugh, like</b>
<br><b>a 5-year old girl's. It wasn't the tv's, because i would have seen
the</b>
<br><b>glowish light that comes from it. Because it was still dark, There
was no way</b>
<br><b>it was the tv. So i ran down the stairs. That is bacically my storie.
But</b>
<br><b>from that point on, I've been hearing bangs from the attic at night.
I told</b>
<br><b>my friend max but he said it was probobly the radiater. But the
radiater is</b>
<br><b>in the basement and the attic dosn't need heat or cool air up there.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Man in my Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; emerald30@hotmail</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping in my room one night when I was awaken for some reason.</b>
<br><b>It was about 5:30 in the morning and everybody was asleep.&nbsp;
I shared my</b>
<br><b>room with my older sister.&nbsp; I sat up, feeling very strange
and looked at</b>
<br><b>the foot of my bed.&nbsp; A man was sitting at the end of it.&nbsp;
He was wearing</b>
<br><b>a blue shirt and red pants.&nbsp; Some how I knew that they were
flairs and</b>
<br><b>that he had black shoes but I couldn't see his legs.&nbsp; He sat
there for</b>
<br><b>about two minutes and then just faded away.&nbsp; Nobody believed
me though.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just last month though, my sister complained
late one night that</b>
<br><b>she felt someone pull her hair.&nbsp; Then another night she claimed
her bed</b>
<br><b>was shaking.&nbsp; After about 15 minutes in my room on my trundle-bed
it</b>
<br><b>started to shake and then my bed started to vibrate.&nbsp; Thats
not all that</b>
<br><b>happened but it is getting off subject if I continue.</b>
