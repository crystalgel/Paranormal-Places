<b>Interesting Tidbit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Djmodels@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My tale is to be honest not much of a "story" more of an interesting
tidbit.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One evening, my boyfriend and future ex-husband, were visiting my
best friend</b>
<br><b>and cousin Robin at her mother's home.&nbsp; It was late and most
of us being fans</b>
<br><b>of the supernatural in fiction or non fiction form started relating
stories.</b>
<br><b>My aunt and her husband talked about some experiences they had while
living</b>
<br><b>upstairs over a very old bar they were leasing for a year.&nbsp;
It seems during</b>
<br><b>the time they lived there many strange things happened.&nbsp; The
usual plethora</b>
<br><b>of events, covers being ripped away while in bed, unusual raps and
noises,</b>
<br><b>and a chair that would mysteriously always move to one particular
window that</b>
<br><b>overlooked a river.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One of the more unusual events was several mornings in a row my aunt
would</b>
<br><b>awake in bed alone.&nbsp; She would find her husband sound asleep
under the bed!</b>
<br><b>He would have no memory of when or how he came to be in such a position.</b><b></b>
<p><b>As the year drug on the events increased.&nbsp; Now in addition to
all the other</b>
<br><b>aforementioned happenings my aunt started having feelings of dread
overcome</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; She refused to stay alone in the place.&nbsp; If it occurred
she would be</b>
<br><b>alone she would go outside and sit in the warm sunshine until her
husband or</b>
<br><b>an early customer would arrive.</b><b></b>
<p><b>It seems they were at first loathe to discuss these events amongst
themselves</b>
<br><b>let alone with anyone else.&nbsp; Finally after many months they
felt they could</b>
<br><b>take it no longer and when the lease for the year was up they moved
without</b>
<br><b>renewing.&nbsp; They never until this night told anyone about their
"experiences"</b>
<br><b>for fear of being laughed at or thought "crazy".</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now for my one and only experience with the supernatural.&nbsp; In
the process of</b>
<br><b>their move, my aunt's husband had to return for two boxes they had
left up</b>
<br><b>stairs.&nbsp; My cousin and I were with him.&nbsp; When we arrived
he asked if we would</b>
<br><b>mind going up and grabbing the boxes with some contrived excuse
it would be</b>
<br><b>quicker if we went.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I must stress at this point my cousin and I had no idea of the events
causing</b>
<br><b>them to move.&nbsp; The moment we started up the stairs I began
to feel at first</b>
<br><b>uneasy.&nbsp; I tried to shake off the feeling I mean it was a bright
sunny day</b>
<br><b>with loads of sunshine pouring in the windows.&nbsp; No scary dark
hallways at</b>
<br><b>night to feed the imagination.&nbsp; By the time we reached the
top of the stairs</b>
<br><b>the feeling was so intense I could feel the hairs on the back of
neck</b>
<br><b>standing up and I was absolutely terrified.&nbsp; Taking one look
at my cousin I</b>
<br><b>saw my own fear mirrored in her face as well.</b><b></b>
<p><b>We grabbed the two boxes and raced down the steps.&nbsp; Once we
were outside the</b>
<br><b>feelings of dread were gone completely.&nbsp; I began to feel silly
and more than</b>
<br><b>a little embarrassed.&nbsp; I suppose my cousin felt the same way
because she</b>
<br><b>laughed nervously and mumbled something.&nbsp; We never mentioned
it again till</b>
<br><b>the night my aunt and her husband felt comfortable in finally relating
their</b>
<br><b>experiences.</b><b></b>
<p><b>So there is my tale, not an eloquent or particularly exciting one,
but a true</b>
<br><b>one.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Betty from KY</b><b></b>
<p><b>PS Anyone care to comment or tell me of a similar story I would love
to hear.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Thanks again.</b>

<p><b>My True Story of the Dark Shadow</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hewittsb@uswest.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>i was in search of answers and still am when telling my story. i
don't know where to begin but</b>
<br><b>i will tell you about the dark shadow that has followed me throughout
my life. i remember</b>
<br><b>seeing the shadow when i was probably 12 years old i didn't say
anything to anyone. the</b>
<br><b>shadow would chase the walls. now i thought i was seeing things
until my family was sitting</b>
<br><b>down watching tv one evening and the shadow came.&nbsp; everyone
just stopped and stared at</b>
<br><b>each other the shadow was there on the wall and it ran.&nbsp; we
were all freaked out.&nbsp; then the</b>
<br><b>creepy thing happened my mother began to tell us what she had experienced
with my father 8</b>
<br><b>years earlier.&nbsp; she said it was the middle of the night and
she was laying on our couch and my</b>
<br><b>father was laying on the floor when she semi woke for some reason
she looked at the floor</b>
<br><b>where my father was and this shadow was dragging him across the
floor. well years and</b>
<br><b>several residences later the shadow was still there. but it got
worse for me i suppose though i</b>
<br><b>haven't told many instances to my family. i remember one night while
in high school reading a</b>
<br><b>library book with my sister the lights were on she was awake and
then flash the lights were</b>
<br><b>out she was cold asleep i couldn't move i was frozen in place my
lips were pierced closed</b>
<br><b>and i knew i was screaming through my shut mouth. my thought was
on fire yet i couldn't</b>
<br><b>move. there were several dark shadows around me pounding on my chest.
i could see the</b>
<br><b>silhouette and the mass of their being but i could see through them.
flash i was awake i could</b>
<br><b>move. ah! i was so relieved the lights were on i could open my mouth
there were no more</b>
<br><b>shadows . then after that only one shadow would visit me again .
always the same thing i</b>
<br><b>would be frozen and it would turn dark it could happen anywhere
but especially when it was</b>
<br><b>a peaceful moment with me. but the worst and most frightening was
the most recent</b>
<br><b>occurrence. i was just laying down to bed nothing special or disturbing
had happened in my</b>
<br><b>life when i was frozen i couldn't even budge my husband who was
inches from me. i don't</b>
<br><b>even think he was even asleep yet. when the shadow came as close
as it has ever come</b>
<br><b>before i felt it in the room staring at me then praying for it to
end i knew it was touching me i</b>
<br><b>looked right above me and it was standing over me about at my hips
it was tall and slim i</b>
<br><b>wouldn't, i mean refusing to look into its eyes trying to budge
and scream to get my husbands</b>
<br><b>attention. i saw it reaching for me the outer part of its being
was wow! it was like a dark grey</b>
<br><b>pair of shear pantyhose. poof! the shadow jumped into the wall.
now i know it might sound</b>
<br><b>crazy but my sister and i were taking a drive a few days later and
she let me in on an ongoing</b>
<br><b>occurrence of hers. when she told me i almost drove off the road
the cold chilling feeling</b>
<br><b>came over my body not only did she have an occurrence it was the
same night at the same</b>
<br><b>time of night. she said she was laying in bed watching tv when she
thought her husband had</b>
<br><b>gotten up to change the station. she had told him to move and it
turned and looked at her then</b>
<br><b>she looked over and there was her husband realizing there was someone
else there who</b>
<br><b>wasn't supposed to be. she said she was frozen and couldn't move
an inch until it had</b>
<br><b>disappeared.&nbsp; ever since then we have shared it with each other
and other sisters and they</b>
<br><b>recall similar occurrences of their own. so you see why i am still
searching for answers. what</b>
<br><b>is this shadow thing? are we cursed? haunted ? why won't it go away?</b>

<p><b>My Wife's Uncle</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jkohl@abovehealth.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Thank you for your site.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Two days ago, I attended my wife's funeral.&nbsp; I don't think he
knows that</b>
<br><b>he's dead.&nbsp; He died in his sleep in his living room chair,
and they found</b>
<br><b>him in the morning.</b><b></b>
<p><b>At the reception in his home after the funeral, I was sitting on
a picnic</b>
<br><b>table bench.&nbsp; Suddenly, the bench was knocked backward.&nbsp;
I was leaning</b>
<br><b>forward, and I didn't fall or get hurt, but I couldn't stop the
bench from</b>
<br><b>falling.&nbsp; I think he was just letting me know that he was there.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Her Uncle had a beautifully restored 1964 pickup truck which had
been at the</b>
<br><b>gravesite during the burial and returned to the house for the reception.&nbsp;
As</b>
<br><b>my wife and I were leaving, we walked by the truck and I felt chills
on my</b>
<br><b>neck and scalp.&nbsp; "He's right here by the truck."&nbsp; I said.&nbsp;
When I said that</b>
<br><b>out loud, the chills grew more intense.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have only recently started noticing this sort of phenomena.&nbsp;
Thanks for</b>
<br><b>allowing an outlet where I know people won't think I'm crazy.</b><b></b>

<br><b>I Visit Famous Haunts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: XxJJLatinGrlxX@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just wanted to say I love this web page I always come to this site
and I</b>
<br><b>also have my mom read some of this stuff you guys have. Cause me
and her have</b>
<br><b>contacted a lot of ghosts that are at historical sites like Hotel
Del</b>
<br><b>Coronado in San Diego Ca and the ever so popular Whaley House in
Old Town San</b>
<br><b>Diego ca.&nbsp; I'm sensitive to spirits but when you put us two
together if you</b>
<br><b>come near us in some of these places you can get an over whelming</b>
<br><b>feeling...Last weekend i took my mom to Hotel Del Coronado and i
took her to</b>
<br><b>this hall way that people hardly come near because of its hauntings
but i</b>
<br><b>knew she didn't know about it so i copied the room numbers down
on a piece of</b>
<br><b>paper and walked with her in that hall way as soon as we got in
there she</b>
<br><b>knew at once that a bad spirit is there and i wanted to take her
down the</b>
<br><b>stairs that were next to these rooms I think they were rooms 3305
3302 and</b>
<br><b>then 3315 she said she didn't like the feeling. she said she feels
like there</b>
<br><b>is a magnetic force pushing against her and also felt someone standing
behind</b>
<br><b>her not knowing that this hall way is where the workers have heard
and seen a</b>
<br><b>lady (i forgot her name its the one where you can put a rose on
the window</b>
<br><b>seal and she'll take it) i could feel it strongly when it was us
two instead</b>
<br><b>of when i was with my friends.&nbsp; It seems like where ever we
go if its at my</b>
<br><b>grandmothers house or something historical like these places down
here in San</b>
<br><b>Diego. CA we can feel that something or someone is with us.&nbsp;
Thanks for</b>
<br><b>listening to my stories i just wanted to let you guys know.</b>

<p><b>The Old House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nikkae@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>i guess u don't usually hear from this part of the world but then
again</b>
<br><b>thats not the point......(at this point...mr. juliano u may have
heard my</b>
<br><b>story before cos i e-mailed you yesterday......i just would like
you to</b>
<br><b>acknowledge that there is more from where my story came from.)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;i am australian born but lived in malaysia practically the
most of my</b>
<br><b>life. when i was a kid say three to four years old... i could feel
presence</b>
<br><b>around me...but i was just told to put that under my imagination.
As so i</b>
<br><b>did...however the cause of my feelings were later explained when
i heard</b>
<br><b>this saying. my granddad was a rich man and he will do anything
for family</b>
<br><b>harmony....therefore he built a street of houses so that my entire
family</b>
<br><b>could live in...the street had seven houses.... it was said that
the first</b>
<br><b>house and the fifth house had a presense....i cannot remember what
the</b>
<br><b>first house was haunted by but the fifth house (occupied by my forth
uncle) was</b>
<br><b>haunted by what the chinese called the butterfly spirit...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the row of houses could be entered by two streets...the back
street and</b>
<br><b>the front street....rumour has it that the back street is not 'clean'
(a</b>
<br><b>chinese way of saying it has a presence).....at the end of the row
of houses was a</b>
<br><b>community hall of which my grand dad builf for the family...where
we had</b>
<br><b>our > celebration dinners or barbecues.that was also considered
unclean.</b>
<br><b>one occasion of which i cannot explain nor forgot is when i was
about 4</b>
<br><b>years old... when i was young...i shared a room with my sister and
our room faced the</b>
<br><b>back street. i was having another nightmare again because ever since
i was</b>
<br><b>young... i was crazy over the paranormal and supernatural....reading
and</b>
<br><b>watching alot of ghost stories and stuff...it was nothing new....
it was</b>
<br><b>around 3:15 in the morning and i was wide awake...i could hear</b>
<br><b>laughter....not one person but 4-5 people laughing...and this laghter
came</b>
<br><b>from the back street. unaware of my situation...i calmy got up and
walked to my parents room and</b>
<br><b>told my mom that there laughter comming from the back road and i
couldn't</b>
<br><b>sleep.... my mom just told me to ignore it and go back to sleep....being
a</b>
<br><b>rather obdient child as opposed to the present me...i did as i was</b>
<br><b>told....however when i got back into my room the laughter was</b>
<br><b>louder.....and it was really scaring me cos it seemed that i was
the only one hearing</b>
<br><b>it....my sister being a light sleeper in nature would have heard
it and be</b>
<br><b>as wide awake as my.... but instead she was alseep.....dead as a
log.</b>
<br><b>i just jumped in bed, shut my eyes and tried to sleep but no avail
i was</b>
<br><b>too scared....i was up till the break of dawn.</b>
<br><b>that isn't the end....the next evening ....when my mom was preparing</b>
<br><b>dinner i was playing in the kitchen where she could keep an eye
on me.</b>
<br><b>still a lil shaken from the experience from the night before i was
just</b>
<br><b>weary of the back street....keeping an eye at it every so often....then
it</b>
<br><b>happened....i saw an old man....his face was peaceful....however
he was</b>
<br><b>gesturing me to go with him...in my mind he was telling me to join
him to</b>
<br><b>better place....i was scared....i closed my eyes turned away and
looked</b>
<br><b>back..... the old man with the peaceful face was gone! just in broad</b>
<br><b>daylight he just disapeared without a trace. when i asked my mom
whether</b>
<br><b>she saw an old man....she told me not to be silly...there was no
old man.</b>
<br><b>my encounter isn't the only encounter in the family......my sister...
she</b>
<br><b>claims she can see 'things' from time to time....she told me that
one</b>
<br><b>morning during the 7th lunar month ( chinese ghost festival...where
souls</b>
<br><b>from the underearth would be freed to roam for one lunar month)
when we</b>
<br><b>had to go to school....she saw a face thru the gate....a very pale
face</b>
<br><b>....with long grey hair away staring at her....she too during that
time was unaware</b>
<br><b>of what she was encountering......and being her aggressive self
she just</b>
<br><b>snapped at the spirit saying..."stare what stare haven't see before
ahh?"</b>
<br><b>her favevourite malaysian phrase) then just before the face the
appiration just dissolved into a mist.</b>
<br><b>a few months ago....my cousin had a rather bad car addident but
luckily</b>
<br><b>enough he had his seatbelt on and he wasn't hurt. the car was a
total</b>
<br><b>wreck. the night before this...he sister-in-law claimed she heard
him talking and</b>
<br><b>joking really loudly with a myterious person in the back street
at 1 am in</b>
<br><b>the morning.....being an early sleeper as he is he was already in
bed</b>
<br><b>snoring at 11:pm.before my parents and my 4th uncle had a conflict
in ideas and stopped</b>
<br><b>interacting..... i used to frequent his house alot....to play with
my</b>
<br><b>cousins......just one occasion when i was left in my cousin's room
when</b>
<br><b>she was getting a drink. i heard really loud breathing....i got
really scared</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and ran out of the room and practically flew downstairs in
fright. i never</b>
<br><b>told her about that occasion cos that was her room and i didn't
want to</b>
<br><b>alarm her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;now that i have moved away from my old house i am still wondering....what</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;lurks in the back street? is it good or evil i'll never ever
know.</b>
<br><b>however when we have our family reunions i try my best to steer
clear from</b>
<br><b>the back street at night.</b>

<p><b>Warnings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tlaing@blenheim.webgate.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have had very strange experiences myself. I was sitting on a beach(as
I</b>
<br><b>did very often at the time), and I had an image of police cars,
and lights</b>
<br><b>at our house.I didn't think much of it at the time, as I thought
I was</b>
<br><b>just imagining things. I was visiting my grandmother's house for
the</b>
<br><b>weekend(where I am now living), and several times, my mother would
call</b>
<br><b>and not give even a hint that anything was wrong. The last day of
my visit, my</b>
<br><b>mother called me, and told me, that our house was broken into by
the man,</b>
<br><b>that we had to house-sit for us, and several things were taken,
including</b>
<br><b>my nintendo, which was my prized possession at the time. I then
found out,</b>
<br><b>from then on that at my grandmother's house, my subconscious mind
is more</b>
<br><b>prone to signals, or messages. Why?, I still do not have that answer.
I</b>
<br><b>also had another experience, also at my grandmother's house. My</b>
<br><b>grandmother asked me, to look for Erica(my little cousin). I hopped
on my bike, and</b>
<br><b>was ready to ride down the long stretch of road, along my grandma's
house,</b>
<br><b>when I had a gut feeling to check by the water at the beach. I was
going to</b>
<br><b>ignore it, but I wanted to see, if my senses were right. I checked
by the</b>
<br><b>group of small private beaches, and there she was. I got there soon
as she</b>
<br><b>dipped her foot in the lake. I still don't know exactly what would
of</b>
<br><b>happened if I wouldn't have been there, but I try not to think to
much of</b>
<br><b>it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Window</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: keithn@txucom.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My friend Shane and his mother live in an old house in deep East
Texas. The house is an old wood frame house that was probably built in
the 1940's, or so I guess. It is a small house with 2 bedrooms and one
bath. The house sits on a hill off of a short dirt driveway and the closest
neighbor is about 2 miles away. I have witnessed many strange events at
this house,and one comes to my mind when I hear of ghost stories.</b>
<br><b>I decided to spend the night at Shane's on the first night they
moved into the old house. When I arrived, Shane and his mother were trying
to find a way to get inside because his mom locked the keys in the house.
We went to the back of the houseand pried a window open with a claw hammer.
Unfortunately, some pieces of the wooden window frame was broken off and
we put the pieces in a pile and said we would fix it later the next day.</b>
<br><b>That night when everyone was asleep in their rooms, I was tossing
and turning on the couch in the living room. The house waspretty quiet
except for the faint sound of a fan in Shane’s room. I finally drifted
off to sleep but would soon be woken up by something to this day I cannot
explain.&nbsp; At around 2:30 am, I heard a noise coming from the direction
of the window I had crawled in to unlock the house, it sounded like someone
was hammering. My eyes stayed closed for a moment and half asleep I thought
Shane’s mom must be fixing that window. Suddenly my eyes popped open, wait
a minute I thought, it is the middle of the night and no one would be outside
fixing that window. I sat up on the couch and looked into the darkness
as the loud hammering sound continued. I stood up</b>
<br><b>and started to walk toward the sound and as I got closer the sound
stopped, I didn’t hear it anymore after that. I waited for a moment thinking
Shane or his mom would come investigate with me, but they were sound asleep
and didn’t hear a thing. The next morning I told them about the sound I
heard and they were puzzled the same as I was. Shane’s mother then told
me of the time she saw her grandpa's ghost on the day of his funeral. She
saw him in the barn next to the house. Chills went down my back when I
thought that maybe it was her grandpa fixing the window in the middle of
the night. We went to look at the window and it was still broken as we
had left it. Maybe I interrupted the ghost when he was doing his repair
work? I will never know.(About a year later I was spending the night at
Shane’s house when I witnessed a car accident right in front of his house.
Around midnight, a car coming around a curve ran off the road and hit a
group of trees, four people were killed instantly. I wonder if there are
more spirits wandering around that place?)</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted House??</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Blix2276@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am a believer in ghosts having heard of many peoples experiences
with them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well, I never had oone of my own until I moved into my present
house.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have lived here now for a little over two years.&nbsp; A lot of
strange things</b>
<br><b>happen here but nothing that makes me feel threatened.&nbsp; The
first thing that</b>
<br><b>happened was right after we, my best friend and I , moved in.&nbsp;
We were</b>
<br><b>watching the television when he looked at the hallway real fast
as if he had</b>
<br><b>seen something.&nbsp; I noticed but didn't say anything yet.&nbsp;
About 5 minutes</b>
<br><b>later he looked at the hallway again.&nbsp; That was when I said
something to him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;All he said was that he had seen something, or someone, real
short, about 3</b>
<br><b>feet tall or so, run from his room into the kitchen.&nbsp; The second
time he said</b>
<br><b>it ran back into his bedroom.&nbsp; When we got up to investigate
and to see if it</b>
<br><b>were possibly my dog, the dog was sound asleep in the kitchen, which
is shut</b>
<br><b>off to the rest of the house by a half-door so the dog cant get
out.&nbsp; Well,</b>
<br><b>about a month or two later, I was home alone and I had seen the
same thing</b>
<br><b>run from his room to the kitchen.&nbsp; I blew it off like my eyes
were possibly</b>
<br><b>playing tricks on me...when I looked away I felt a cold, hard breeze
blow by</b>
<br><b>my hair.&nbsp; It felt as if someone swung their hand at my hair.&nbsp;
That kinda gave</b>
<br><b>me the creeps.&nbsp; My sister has seen this short "thing" run from
room to room</b>
<br><b>as well but I do not know the story to that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Another thing that has happened at the house involved my
new room mate.</b>
<br><b>Well, I was sleeping on the couch and she was in the bathroom getting
ready</b>
<br><b>to go to work.&nbsp; She works at a bar so it was in the evening
when this</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; Being that it was dark and there was lights on in
the house in the</b>
<br><b>living room where I was napping, the window in the front on the
opposite wall</b>
<br><b>acts like a mirror.&nbsp; Well, she could see the top of the couch
where I was</b>
<br><b>sleeping and she looked in and saw me, or what she thought was me,
standing</b>
<br><b>in front of the couch and looking down at it and scratching its
own head.&nbsp; A</b>
<br><b>minute or so later she came out to talk to me, but saw I was still
sound</b>
<br><b>asleep.&nbsp; She woke me up and asked if I was just up standing
in front of the</b>
<br><b>couch.&nbsp; I told her that I haven't even so much as sat up yet.&nbsp;
So it seems</b>
<br><b>something was standing by me and looking down at me.&nbsp; I am
just glad this</b>
<br><b>"ghost" is a friendly one.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I am friends with a girl whose brother used to own this house
and before I</b>
<br><b>could tell her of any of my ghost stories involved in the house
she blurted</b>
<br><b>out that the house is haunted.&nbsp; It seems her brother complained
of doors</b>
<br><b>slamming and cupboards opening and closing all the time.&nbsp; She
said that one</b>
<br><b>time the sliding glass door in the kitchen even flung open by itself.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Other then those few specific stories not too much has happened
other then</b>
<br><b>the occasional "noises" and footsteps.&nbsp; One could say it might
be my dog, but</b>
<br><b>most pet owners would agree that you become accustomed to your pet's
noises</b>
<br><b>after a bit of time.&nbsp; And some of the instances when I have
heard the noises,</b>
<br><b>my dog was sleeping right next to m, and I was home alone.</b><b></b>

<br><b>this time I didn't believe in...no, I didn't WANT to believe that
there</b>
<br><b>was a hell and there was satan and demons.&nbsp; To tell this story
literally</b>
<br><b>scares me to death.&nbsp; This is only the third or fourth time
I have ever</b>
<br><b>told this story.&nbsp; I was taking call on midnight shift at this
little</b>
<br><b>rural hospital in Missouri.&nbsp; It only had 40 beds at the time,
and from</b>
<br><b>the time I started work there, I always thought the place was kinda</b>
<br><b>creepy, especially at night.&nbsp; So I get this call that there
was a</b>
<br><b>housefire and that they needed xrays on a guy who jumped out of
a</b>
<br><b>window.&nbsp; I get my clothes on and go in to do my job, but for
some</b>
<br><b>strange reason, I knew this wasn't gonna be no ordinary night.&nbsp;
So I get</b>
<br><b>there, and I find the guy sitting on a stretcher in the emergency
room.</b>
<br><b>He was full of soot from the fire, but that's not what caught my</b>
<br><b>attention so much.&nbsp; It was his eyes....those eyes that looked
at me</b>
<br><b>seemed to be analyzing my soul!&nbsp; And the smell, he actually
smelled like</b>
<br><b>something dead and rotting!&nbsp; I shook off the feeling and got
down to</b>
<br><b>business.&nbsp; I told him we needed to do xrays on him, and proceeded
to</b>
<br><b>take him over to the xray department.&nbsp; I had previously turned
on all</b>
<br><b>the processors and warmed them up to develop the films, and turned
on</b>
<br><b>the indirect lights in the xray room, but didn't bother to turn
any</b>
<br><b>lights on in the workstation.&nbsp; So I brought this guy over and
start to</b>
<br><b>do the exam.&nbsp; I asked him if his family was ok after the fire,
and he</b>
<br><b>calmly said "I don't know".&nbsp; I asked him what he meant and
he said "what</b>
<br><b>does it matter?"&nbsp; So I dropped the subject, feeling VERY peculiar
about</b>
<br><b>the whole situation.&nbsp; I found it VERY strange that he didn't
give a hoot</b>
<br><b>about his family at all, or at least didn't indicate it to me.&nbsp;
So I got</b>
<br><b>done with the exam and went to develop the films.&nbsp; In the darkroom
I</b>
<br><b>started to get a little queasy of the stomach and lightheaded, and
just</b>
<br><b>blamed it on the chemicals.&nbsp; But the worst was yet to come.&nbsp;
I started</b>
<br><b>to type the information on his paperwork, and this time I got severely</b>
<br><b>sick, with a horrible sound ringing in my ears.&nbsp; My vision
got blurry</b>
<br><b>and my fingers each felt like they weighed about 500 pounds a piece.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>was paralyzed like, sick, and very confused.&nbsp; I happened to
look in the</b>
<br><b>room at my patient, and noticed him starting at me with the same</b>
<br><b>peculiar look he gave me in the emergency room!&nbsp; He had a wicked
looking</b>
<br><b>smile on his face and looked like he was about ready to come off
the</b>
<br><b>table at me.&nbsp; I yelled out "please help me God, PLEASE!" and
the feeling</b>
<br><b>subsided.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was very frightened, and was
afraid to</b>
<br><b>look in the room again.&nbsp; When I finally did, he was gone!!!!&nbsp;
I gathered</b>
<br><b>up my films and ran back over to the Emergency Room and told them
that</b>
<br><b>the guy left.&nbsp; They said that he was back over there, that
he must have</b>
<br><b>came in the back way or something.&nbsp; A little while later, the
guy got</b>
<br><b>antsy and wanted to leave right then!&nbsp; He got downright hostile
with the</b>
<br><b>nurses, and I was in the front waiting room and happened to hear
the</b>
<br><b>commotion and went to look.&nbsp; The guy ran right by me out the
Emergency</b>
<br><b>room doors and out into the night.&nbsp; As the guy ran out the
door, every</b>
<br><b>fire alarm in the hospital started going off, I sware as God as
my</b>
<br><b>witness.&nbsp; The fire department was called, and no explanation
was to be</b>
<br><b>found for the alarms tripping.&nbsp; Everyone knew, especially me,
we had had</b>
<br><b>a strange visitor that night.&nbsp; After that incident, I had read
about</b>
<br><b>people feeling dizzy and nauseated in the presence of demons.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>dumbfounded!&nbsp; Now I DO realize that what visited me that night
was a</b>
<br><b>demon of the devil himself!</b>

<p><b>The Face</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: appowell@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have experienced feeling spirits and entities many, many times,
but</b>
<br><b>i've only actually seen one once. And I think that the main reason
I</b>
<br><b>*DON'T* see them now is because that one experience scared me so</b>
<br><b>completely that I guess I thought it was enough just to know they're</b>
<br><b>there, I don't have to see them.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 15 (you ever notice that a LOT of stories occur when people</b>
<br><b>are 14 or 15? i wonder why that is?) I lived on a farm with the
second</b>
<br><b>oldest house in the area. At the time it was about 100 years old,
and</b>
<br><b>just across the lane there was a smaller house, that apparently
my great</b>
<br><b>grandmother lived in for the last years of her life, in the 50's.
She</b>
<br><b>died long before I was ever born, and I don't think I even saw a
picture</b>
<br><b>of her. Since then the house had been used as storage, but it was
pretty</b>
<br><b>much taken for granted that wierd things happened there.</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was a hot summer day, and it was my job to mow the 4 or so acres
of</b>
<br><b>grass around both houses. We had a ride on lawnmower, and i was
working</b>
<br><b>towards the back of the smaller house. There were lilac bushes about
10</b>
<br><b>feet from the house, and no one bothered to mow in between the bushes</b>
<br><b>and the house before, so I figured I would do this, up to the trees
just</b>
<br><b>south of the house. I had always gotten a bad feeling about the
trees,</b>
<br><b>and never ventured into them in the 7 years I lived there.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm riding on the lawnmower close to the trees and the small house
and</b>
<br><b>suddenly the lawnmower just stops. The engine is still running,
but it</b>
<br><b>sounds as if it's laboring, and the blade isn't working at all.
The</b>
<br><b>first thing I think of naturally is all the long grass clogging
up the</b>
<br><b>blade, so I check, but it's clear. Then I shut off the mower, turn
it</b>
<br><b>back on again, but it's still acting the same way. I checked the
oil,</b>
<br><b>the gas, everything is topped up and working fine.</b><b></b>
<p><b>You know how you could be doing something, completely preoccupied
and</b>
<br><b>suddenly you feel as if you're being watched and just naturally
turn to</b>
<br><b>the person who's looking at you? That's exactly what happened to
me. I</b>
<br><b>turn to look at the house, the side that's parallel to the trees,
the</b>
<br><b>side of the house that I hadn't seen before, and I see a small porch.
In</b>
<br><b>the porch is a window, and blocking the lower half of the window
is</b>
<br><b>something white. Above this is a face. It has asbolutely no features,</b>
<br><b>and I remember thinking, my god, it has no hair. It has no eyes,
nose or</b>
<br><b>mouth either, but that's the first thing that jumped into my head.
I was</b>
<br><b>absolutely frozen with fear. The malevolence emanating from this
thing</b>
<br><b>was like an electric shock, that just held me in place.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have no idea how long I was frozen like that. Could have been minutes,</b>
<br><b>could have been seconds. But finally I broke free and ran to the
house.</b>
<br><b>I told my mother what I had seen the ghost and that there was NO
WAY I</b>
<br><b>was going back out there. She said you just want to get out of mowing</b>
<br><b>the grass, get back out there, so I had an ice tea and calmed my
nerves</b>
<br><b>a bit, then went back out.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The lawnmower was still there, of course, only now it was idling
fine,</b>
<br><b>like nothing had happened. I refused to look at the window, and
to be</b>
<br><b>quite honest i refused to look at that part of the little house
for</b>
<br><b>several years. When I finally did, there was nothing blocking the
little</b>
<br><b>window at all...of course someone may have rearranged things, so
who</b>
<br><b>knows.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Our barn was also haunted. This was a very old barn, built the same
time</b>
<br><b>as the old farmhouse, and it had huge sliding doors into the horse</b>
<br><b>stables and the cow stables. I could barely push these doors, and
my</b>
<br><b>younger sister definately couldn't. We also had some old horses
that</b>
<br><b>were well into their 30's, enjoying retirement. One day the stallion</b>
<br><b>disappeared. We couldn't find him anywhere. We assumed he was in
some</b>
<br><b>trees north of the farm yard just hanging out there. He would do
that</b>
<br><b>every once in a while, but would always come out, so we weren't
that</b>
<br><b>concerned. A week or so after this my step father noticed the barn</b>
<br><b>lights were on. They would do this often, we thought perhaps mice</b>
<br><b>chewing through the wires or something, so he went to shut the lights</b>
<br><b>off. As he neared the barn he smelled something bad, and went into
the</b>
<br><b>barn. There was our old horse. Someone had opened the barn door,
opened</b>
<br><b>the oat bin, then CLOSED the door and left him to die a horrible
death</b>
<br><b>of bloat. There is no way one could access the barn from the road</b>
<br><b>without us seeing from the yard, and I know it wasn't one of us.
Finally</b>
<br><b>one night after I moved away, the barn just burnt to the ground.
They</b>
<br><b>never did figure out what started it. Probably a mouse.</b>
