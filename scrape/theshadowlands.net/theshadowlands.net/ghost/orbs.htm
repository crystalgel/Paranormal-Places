<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">What are these balls of transparent light we
find in photos taken in allegedly haunted places?&nbsp; I won't tell you
I know the answer to this question.&nbsp; No one has the true answer to
this question yet, but that's part of the job of researchers and investigator.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">One of the leading theories concerning what
orbs are and the one that I lean towards the most is that they are not
the spirit at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; The orb is the energy being transferred
from a source (i.e. powerlines, heat energy, batteries, people, etc) to
the spirit so they can manifest.&nbsp;&nbsp; This may not even be a conscious
thing the spirit is doing, just a natural way they get their energy.&nbsp;
This would explain why the orbs are round balls.&nbsp; According to the
laws of Physics energy being transferring like that would assume is natural
shape of a sphere.&nbsp;&nbsp; This theory can also be tied into the EMF
readings we get during spirit activity.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">I always approach things with a bit of skepticism,
so when I saw all these websites start showing off these photos as ghosts,
I was just as weary as most of you.&nbsp; I just had to try it for myself.&nbsp;
I took a 35mm camera that I had used regularly for 6 years in all types
of lighting and weather and had never gotten an orb or other unexplainable
photo before and went out with a few seasoned field investigators on a
cemetery investigation.&nbsp; One of the investigators was psychic and
she pointed out a few areas we should take photos, so I did.&nbsp; I also
had ghost footsteps walkup behind me twice and I turned around quickly
and took photos of the empty air.&nbsp; When I got my photos developed,
I had these orbs and fog in those photos that I was told to take, as well
as the footstep ones.&nbsp; All my other photos were normal.&nbsp; Coincidence?</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Since we do not know what orbs truly are, just
that they seem to be found mainly in areas where there is ghost activity,
I will tell you what they are not.&nbsp; On a normal investigation there
are about 10 people using 10 different cameras, 35mm and digital, and many
speeds and brands of film.&nbsp; They all get their film developed at separate
places.&nbsp; Let's say only half of these investigators get some orb photos.&nbsp;
Are these water spots or dirt on the lens?&nbsp; That would mean that 5
people all had similar dirt on their lens and all 5 did not clean their
lens either.&nbsp; Are these orbs film processing errors?&nbsp; Well the
35mm cameras all had their film developed in different locations and used
different film so that is very unlikely.&nbsp; The digital cameras can't
have film-processing errors.&nbsp; I am aware that some people feel that
the orbs on a digital camera are an error in the digital processing of
the image.&nbsp; When that error does occur in digital photos, the objects
tend to be square in nature, not round and they cannot be semi-transparent,
the pixel behind would have to be corrupted also.&nbsp; I will not even
address the precipitation theory, no legitimate researchers takes photos
in any form of precipitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; What about dust and dirt being
stirred up? Can that be the cause of the orbs?&nbsp;&nbsp; If that were
the case, I would think that there would not be normal photos in a sequence
of photos from the same camera and location.&nbsp; All of the shots in
a sequence should have the dust or dirt in it. We find that most orb photos
do not appear in consecutive photos.&nbsp; All photographers present should
get orbs if it is dust being stirred up as well.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">These are just a few things for the skeptics
to think of when they are condemning an orb photo as a fake or fraud and
some things for investigators to consider when checking their photos for
positives.</font></b>
