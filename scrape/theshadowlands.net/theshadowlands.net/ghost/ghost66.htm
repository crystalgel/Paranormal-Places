</H3><P><B>By:  blloyd5198@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My husband and I purchased my childhood home from my parents
approximately</B>
<P><B>three years ago.  Although I had not lived in the house for seven
years</B>
<P><B>prior to the purchase, I have experienced a continuation of the
unusual</B>
<P><B>experiences which occurred there from my childhood through my early
adult</B>
<P><B>years.  The experiences are too numerous to list at this time, but
they can</B>
<P><B>be best summarized by a series of events which occurred the week
before</B>
<P><B>Christmas of 1998. My husband and I and our two young sons occupy the
bottom</B>
<P><B>floor of our house, and two friends rent the second story master bedroom.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>In the first day of that week, I was sitting up in bed finishing up
some</B>
<P><B>work I had brought home.  It was approximately 11:30 p.m. and my husband
and</B>
<P><B>children were asleep.  The door to our bedroom was closed and I had
the t.v.</B>
<P><B>on for company.  I suddenly became aware of something that sounded
like the</B>
<P><B>buzzer on our stove but, dismissed it since I had not set the timer.
 The</B>
<P><B>sound continued for fifteen minutes so, I finally got up and went into
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen to find it was the buzzer on the stove.  I turned it off,
returned</B>
<P><B>to my room, and woke my husband up to see if he had set the timer for
any</B>
<P><B>reason.  He said he had not, and I just dismissed the whole situation
as</B>
<P><B>being caused by an electrical short.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning I went off to work while my friend, who rents our
upstairs</B>
<P><B>master bedroom with her boyfriend, watched our two year old son.  When
I</B>
<P><B>returned at noon she told me she had the strangest experience while
I was</B>
<P><B>gone.  She was in her room rocking our son when she heard the water
come on</B>
<P><B>in her bathroom.  She thought it must be my father, who lives next
door,</B>
<P><B>watering his plants, but when she got to the door of the bathroom she
found</B>
<P><B>the water going full blast in the tub.  She had to physically turn
both</B>
<P><B>handles to shut the water off.  I relayed the buzzer event from the
night</B>
<P><B>before and we laughed it off that the ghost was trying to get our
attention.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Boy was he ever!  The next morning I was driving to work when I
suddenly</B>
<P><B>heard vicious snarling, like that of a dog, coming from the rear seat
of my</B>
<P><B>car.  I was totally shocked, and whipped around to look in my rear
seat but</B>
<P><B>there was nothing there.  At that point, I was completely freaked out
and</B>
<P><B>realized that something utterly unexplainable had happened.  I recited
Hail</B>
<P><B>Marys all the way to work because it was the only way I could think
to</B>
<P><B>protect myself from what I heard.  When I arrived at work I
immediately</B>
<P><B>called my husband, and he reminded me that I had heard a similar sound
a</B>
<P><B>couple of months before on the staircase landing leading to my friends
room.</B>
<P><B>At that time, I had thought I must have been hearing something from
outside,</B>
<P><B>but after two incidents, I am afraid it is some unseen entity.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The following day I received a call from our nanny while I was at work.
 She</B>
<P><B>had just returned from picking my son up from school.  When she went
in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen she heard water running upstairs.  She went upstairs to check
it out</B>
<P><B>and found the faucets in both sinks running full blast and one of the
sinks</B>
<P><B>was about to overflow.  At that point, we decided the ghost was making
a</B>
<P><B>real nuisance of itself.  We asked our friends to put a religious object
up</B>
<P><B>in their room, since it had seemed to keep things under control
downstairs.</B>
<P><B>To my knowledge there have been no further incidents upstairs since
that</B>
<P><B>time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>On the final day of that week, my husband, myself, and our kids went
away</B>
<P><B>for a couple of days.  When we returned our friends advised that they
had</B>
<P><B>been awoken at 1:00 a.m. the first night by a huge crash from
downstairs.</B>
<P><B>When they went down to investigate they found our fireplace screen
in the</B>
<P><B>middle of the living room.  Whether it was the wind or the ghost we
will</B>
<P><B>never know, but it sure scared them!</B>
<P>
<P><B>My older sister rented our house for five years prior to our purchase
of the</B>
<P><B>property.  I saw her at Christmas and asked if she had any unusual</B>
<P><B>experiences in the upstairs bedroom which she occupied while she
lived</B>
<P><B>there.  She had also experienced the water turning on by itself, the
toilet</B>
<P><B>flushing by itself, footsteps, and someone calling her name.  On one</B>
<P><B>occasion she felt someone sit on the corner of her waterbed while she
was</B>
<P><B>sleeping.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We do not know who is haunting our house, but we know that there are
at</B>
<P><B>least three entities.  Their activity ranges from sporadic to going
on a</B>
<P><B>tirade, like the week described above.  We have learned to live with
them,</B>
<P><B>but I would love an explanation for the snarling I heard in my car.
 Is it</B>
<P><B>possible for a ghost to leave the premises and follow you around? 
I would</B>
<P><B>love to hear from anyone who has had such an experience.</B>

<P><B>      One night a friend and I were at a girlfriends house .We were
hanging</B>
<P><B>out when I   felt a strange feeling overcome me.It was  like something
telling</B>
<P><B>me to look up the staircase. So, when I did I saw an undescribable,</B>
<P><B>illuminating light cascading downward from the top of the stairs. It
looked to</B>
<P><B>be a boy child about the age of 6 years old. He had blonde hair and
bright</B>
<P><B>blue eyes. The shape of his body was out- lined in brillant white light.
 His</B>
<P><B>eyes seemed to be beaming down at me. It was not a scarry
experience,actually</B>
<P><B>it was a safe and comforting feeling . I never said anything to anyone
about</B>
<P><B>my sighting, until my friend that was there brought up that night and</B>
<P><B>proceeded to describe the same experience in full detail. I got
goosebumps</B>
<P><B>all through my body as she was telling me her story on what she saw
that</B>
<P><B>night. We </B>
<P><B>found out that we both experienced the same apperation that night,
but at</B>
<P><B>different times.  Linda and Colleen </B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Two years ago I was asked to house-sit for a </B>
<P><B>friend. I had watched their house before with no problems, but this
time </B>
<P><B>it was different. I arrived at around four that day and settled in
for the </B>
<P><B>evening. I watched TV and ate dinner. It wasn't until about 9:00 </B>
<P><B>that the strange things started to happen. I was downstairs, the only
</B>
<P><B>thing on was the TV, when all of a sudden I heard a loud bang
upstairs.</B>
<P><B>First I thought it was the cat, but I looked down and she was laying
next to </B>
<P><B>me. At that time I heard what sounded like something heavy rolling
around </B>
<P><B>on the floor upstairs. I decided to check it out. When I got </B>
<P><B>upstairs nothing was out of order. I checked everything, all doors
and windows </B>
<P><B>were locked. I went back downstairs and when I walked back into the
front </B>
<P><B>room the french doors leading to the foyer were wide open! Checking
it I </B>
<P><B>noticed that it had two latches at the top had been pulled out. I shut
the door </B>
<P><B>and decided to call it a night. I went to bed feeling uneasy. A </B>
<P><B>couple of hours passed when I heard something on the stairs right outside
the </B>
<P><B>bedroom, (the door was open and I didn't see a thing). I heard a thump
and a </B>
<P><B>womans voice, she sounded like she was crying. She asked where her
baby </B>
<P><B>was. I jumped out of bed and checked the stairs, nobody was there.
I </B>
<P><B>went into the next room and another latched door was open. I closed
the </B>
<P><B>door went back to the stairs and the cat was standing there with his
fur on </B>
<P><B>end! Thats when I went back in the bedroom and sure enough the closet
door </B>
<P><B>was hanging open. I knew I would not be able to sleep, but I knew I
had to </B>
<P><B>stay till morning. Needless to say I still didn't sleep a wink. The
</B>
<P><B>next morning I left as soon as the sun came up. I never watched their
</B>
<P><B>house again. I told them later what had happened and they told me that
</B>
<P><B>early in the houses history a fire had broken out upstairs. It was
one of </B>
<P><B>the rooms whose door I found open. It happened to be the room of the
lady </B>
<P><B>of the house. So maybe that was the voice I heard. Maybe she was </B>
<P><B>still there.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  harleyquinn10@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have two stories for now to tell 1 happened to me, the other happened
to </B>
<P><B>my mom.  In Febuary 1998 my Uncle Roy who was 27 killed himself. I
am </B>
<P><B>only 17 yrs old and grew up with him like he was my brother. His death
</B>
<P><B>hit me very hard because all Roy and I ever did was fight and argue.
</B>
<P><B>mostly just playing around.  I don't think I have ever had a serious
</B>
<P><B>fight with him. But I know I have never hugged him or told him I loved
</B>
<P><B>him. So I  resented that until last October.  Roys birthday is on the
</B>
<P><B>3rd and I knew when it was but when the day came it totally skipped
my </B>
<P><B>mind. And no one had even mentioned it.  I don't know if you are going
</B>
<P><B>to count this cause it happened in what I think was a dream but I believe
</B>
<P><B>it was more real then the other things that I have experienced. Any
way </B>
<P><B>I had gone to bed and I guess it was in my dream I was sort of in this
</B>
<P><B>sandy type beach area and my Uncle Roy had walked up to me and he told
</B>
<P><B>me he was sorry and he knew that I loved him and he gave me a hug and
he </B>
<P><B>said he would always be with me.  Any way I woke up and it was in the
</B>
<P><B>middle of the night and I had the feeling of him with me in my room
I </B>
<P><B>could sorta of smell him like he was there. and I feel totally at peace
</B>
<P><B>with it now although I do miss him. </B>
<P>
<P><B>My mothers dream happened around Christmas time.  My uncle had came
to my </B>
<P><B>mom and told him that he was sorry and he only needed to get away and
</B>
<P><B>didn't think it to be forever. (This sounds like something he would
say) </B>
<P><B>When my mom woke up she could remember exactly what he was wearing
and </B>
<P><B>called my Aunt Nancy to tell her about it and she said thats what he
was </B>
<P><B>wearing when he died. Another thing just recently I found out the </B>
<P><B>location where he died. And its near my house, I drive by there often
and </B>
<P><B>its a sandy feild where they are now erecting a highway.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Other things about Roy he has 3 children a 6yr old, 3yr old, and a
2yr old </B>
<P><B>The the 3yr, old we'll call him DL. Well DL was playing in his room
one </B>
<P><B>day and he came down and said that he was just talking with daddy.
DL is </B>
<P><B>a very bright child and would never lie.  I believe they have all come
</B>
<P><B>in contact with their father although I am not sure. </B>

</H3><P><B>By:  flowers1@mill.tds.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> Me and my best friend Angela </B>
<P><B>have had some very strange things happen to us in my and her woods.
One </B>
<P><B>time we were sitting under this huge oak tree and something in white
told us to </B>
<P><B>leave. We did and about 5 minutes after we did we heard a huge crack
and a </B>
<P><B>huge branch from the tree fell right where we were sitting.</B>
<P><B>Another time was not so nice.</B>
<P><B> We were walking through an old orchard and I was in front of her so
she couldn't </B>
<P><B>really see what had happened but at the other end of the orchard I
could see the </B>
<P><B>bottom leg of a black horse. Pretty soon I saw the whole horse. It
</B>
<P><B>was huge, about 7 feet at it's shoulders, well bigger than any horse
in the </B>
<P><B>world. Pure black with red eyes and then it charged at us. I think
</B>
<P><B>that it just wanted to keep us away from something, and it did.</B>
<P><B>Another time in her woods we were looking </B>
<P><B>down a creek that runs through her woods and we could see something
big and </B>
<P><B>white down a couple hundred feet. We investigated and found just some
</B>
<P><B>smoke. Another time I was bow hunting in my woods </B>
<P><B>and I could here wagons and horses and gun fire. I later investigated
and </B>
<P><B>found some fresh horse tracks and wagon tracks. I followed them and
they </B>
<P><B>ended where a pine tree had fallen.In me and her bedrooms we would
see </B>
<P><B>things. In my room, if you look out one of the window you can see a
sand </B>
<P><B>pitt. On most nights there are beams of light coming from it.</B>
<P><B>One last thing, when we were staying in a </B>
<P><B>camper, in my woods, we could here a paper bag. Alot of times when
we </B>
<P><B>were walking in the wood we would have a feeling that we were being
followed or </B>
<P><B>that is we went off the path something bad would happen.</B>
<P><B> All of this is true. Now you decide if it would have hurt us.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=murder> Murder on Devaughn St.</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  Pinediddle@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My story is a long one so please bare with me.</B>
<P><B>Four years ago my husband and I moved into a long vacant house.  We
knew</B>
<P><B>when we moved in ,that there had been a tradgedy in the house in
1969.</B>
<P><B>Neither of us were what you call superstitious so it really had not</B>
<P><B>bearing on us at the time.  About a month after we moved in I began</B>
<P><B>hearing conversations in the middle of the night.  It sounded like
a</B>
<P><B>radio broadcast, not quite coming in.  Then one day as I was standing
at</B>
<P><B>my stove, I saw a man with his arms crossed, leaning against the</B>
<P><B>cabinet.  My sister has also seen the same man walking by the front</B>
<P><B>bedroom door.  The front bedroom of my house is what I call my</B>
<P><B>sanctuary.  One day when I was feeling really down I went into the
front</B>
<P><B>bedroom and sat down.  After a few minutes this feeling of calm came</B>
<P><B>over me and I just felt at peace. I might add that the lights in this</B>
<P><B>room continually go off and on, despite several electrical changes.</B>
<P><B>A year ago I went to see a physical therapist for a problem I was</B>
<P><B>having, and to my surprise, she out of the blue says to me "theres</B>
<P><B>something wrong with your house"  I said yeah its old and falling
down.</B>
<P><B>She told me she had the gift of sight, and that sometimes she'll just</B>
<P><B>see things.  This is what she told me.  She said there are two
spirits</B>
<P><B>in your house, a benevolent spirit, and a manevolent spirit.  By</B>
<P><B>manevolent I don't really mean evil just mischievious, the other is
a</B>
<P><B>young mother looking for her baby.</B>
<P><B>After hearing this my sister and I went to the local library and dug
up</B>
<P><B>the old newspaper article of the murders on Devaughn St..  </B>
<P><B>A young couple lived here at the time with their 7mth old baby.  A</B>
<P><B>friend of theirs had had an argument with her husband the day before
and</B>
<P><B>had brought her two children to stay for awhile.</B>
<P><B>The following morning, the estranged husband showed up and shot them
all</B>
<P><B>in the head (in the front bedroom ), he then killed himself in the</B>
<P><B>hallway.  Now things begin to make sense.  I believe the killer and
the</B>
<P><B>lady who owned this house are my spirits.  I believe that the front</B>
<P><B>bedroom is off limits to him, that is why I feel so at peace there,
this</B>
<P><B>is her room.  I feel like the hallway is his, because this is where</B>
<P><B>everyone gets the creeps.  My husband says all this is nonsense, even</B>
<P><B>when the lights go on and off.  Even when several people tell him
they</B>
<P><B>see things.  Even when things are constantly being moved, and bread
just</B>
<P><B>flys off the cabinet.  Perhaps if he believed he'd have to move, and
I</B>
<P><B>don't want that.  I love my house on Devaughn St. By the way, none
of</B>
<P><B>the children were killed that morning, just the four adults.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  susanbates@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>     Last time I told you about Lilly, the spirit who kept me company</B>
<P><B>when we lived on our little farm in the Ozarks. Lilly was the first</B>
<P><B>spirit I met there, but she was by no means the last. Many strange</B>
<P><B>things happened there. Umbrellas, school books, and jackets would</B>
<P><B>disappear as the children were hurrying to meet the bus. Glasses of
milk</B>
<P><B>would float up over the table and slowly spill the contents in full
view</B>
<P><B>of one and all. When I would become frustrated and yell, "Stop that!"
the</B>
<P><B>front door would open and slam close. This would end the ghostly</B>
<P><B>escapades for a few days, anyway.</B>
<P><B>     One day we were painting and papering the living room. We had
taken</B>
<P><B>down the curtains and I had deposited the rod brackets in a big
wooden</B>
<P><B>bowl that set on the counter top.  Finally we were done and ready to</B>
<P><B>rehang the curtains. But when I went to retrieve the brackets, they
were</B>
<P><B>not in the bowl. I was positive I had put them there and I knew the
kids</B>
<P><B>hadn't bothered them. They had hidden in their rooms all day
terrified</B>
<P><B>that they might be drafted into action. </B>
<P><B>    By now I was tired. My husband was cranky and all I wanted to do
was</B>
<P><B>get this job over with and go to bed. My patience thin I said to no
one</B>
<P><B>in particular, "I don't know who you are, but you better give back
my</B>
<P><B>property!" Just then we heard a chink, chink, chink sound over head.</B>
<P><B>Looking up there were the curtain rod brackets floating 6 inches
below</B>
<P><B>the ceiling. We stared in tired amazement as "our spirit" toyed with
us</B>
<P><B>yet again.. Then, as if in slow motion, the brackets floated down and</B>
<P><B>landed in my upturned hand. </B>
<P><B>    Next time I'll tell you about the dimes. </B>

</H3><P><B>By:  deathdraco2001@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>   When I was a child I had a cat named Midnight. He was my best friend.
</B>
<P><B>The day he was killed I went to school like any other day and we had
a </B>
<P><B>field day. I came home so happy about my two first prize ribbons and
my </B>
<P><B>second prize ribbon. When I got inside the house I looked for him and
</B>
<P><B>couldn't find him. My mother told me that my father had ran over him
by </B>
<P><B>accident. I ran to my bedroom and shut the door and jumped onto my
bed </B>
<P><B>and cried for him. As I was crying and saying his name I felt cat paws
</B>
<P><B>on my back and a soft purring in my ear. I turned my head thinking
that </B>
<P><B>my mom was teasing me but there was nothing there even though as I
</B>
<P><B>looked the paws and purring persisted. I turned over slowly and the
paws </B>
<P><B>moved off of me and then back as I settled down on my back. The funny
</B>
<P><B>thing is Midnight use to always sleep on my chest and purr into my
ear. </B>
<P><B>That is how he got me to go to sleep on time. If I was ever late to
get </B>
<P><B>to bed he would sleep at the bottom of my bed instead. I suppose that
it </B>
<P><B>was supposed to be a punishment. This continued to happen on and off
for </B>
<P><B>about a year. I never saw him but I knew when he was there. The only
</B>
<P><B>time I saw him was on Halloween night I slipped and fell. I started
to </B>
<P><B>wimper and a tear ran down my cheek. He appeared in front of me and
</B>
<P><B>brushed up against me as it to dry my tears. I have seen him on and
off </B>
<P><B>ever since then.</B>
<P><B>   Later on I got a dog that I named Jenny. When I would play in my
</B>
<P><B>sandbox she would sit beneath the tree in our backyard. The tree was
</B>
<P><B>right next to the sandbox. She would sit there and watch me until I
got </B>
<P><B>out of the sandbox and moved on to something else. She was my protector
</B>
<P><B>and my best friend. For a long time after she died I would go and sit
in </B>
<P><B>my sandbox and I would look over at the base of the tree and she would
</B>
<P><B>be there. Sitting on the grave we made for her. I have seen her </B>
<P><B>elsewhere too. I was over at a neighbors house talking and she showed
up </B>
<P><B>in one of my neighbors chairs. My neighbor didn't see her though. </B>
<P><B>Whenever I need a friend she is there to be that friend.</B>
<P><B>   Another one of my pets that has come back is a stray cat we adopted
</B>
<P><B>he would always lay beside me and purr in my ear until he knew I was
</B>
<P><B>asleep or it was time to tuck my sister in. The night he died he went
on </B>
<P><B>his usual rounds and went into our basement. It was there he died.
The </B>
<P><B>next day we buried him next to Jenny and that night he went on his
usual </B>
<P><B>rounds. Although I never asked my sister if he came into her room I
knew </B>
<P><B>that he was with me. A few nights later I felt a cat beside me and
a cat </B>
<P><B>on my chest. That went on for about a month.</B>
<P><B>   Now at night I hear soft music and a baby crying. Not always, just
</B>
<P><B>sometimes. I also see things move out of the corner of my eye but when
I </B>
<P><B>look they are gone. I know that the occurrences that are happening
now </B>
<P><B>can be explained by my eyes playing tricks on me and someone having
</B>
<P><B>their t.v. on but what would be the explanation for the cat paws and
the </B>
<P><B>purring? Or Jenny watching over me? There is none that I can think
of.</B>

<P><B>that sticks out the most took place in 1974 in Washington state.  We
had all</B>
<P><B> gathered and was starting into the sitting when a car drove into the</B>
<P><B> driveway and four doors opened and closed then footsteps in the gravel
and</B>
<P><B> up the porch stopping at the window looking in on the living room,
I got up</B>
<P><B> to open the door for them and there was no one there. the 6 people
that were </B>
<P><B>there in the house also looked out the window to see the car and there
was no </B>
<P><B>car and we all heard it and also heard the doors opening again and
closing ,it</B>
<P><B> starting up and leaving.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=ghost>The Ghost in the Apartment</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  cwthom344@mindspring.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was raised in a high-rise apartment building where we rented a
fifth-floor</B>
<P><B>apartment. The arrangement consisted of a kitchen/breakfast room, a
living</B>
<P><B>room and a bedroom with a hallway that ran from the bedroom into a
dressing</B>
<P><B>room with a bathroom off to one side. The bedroom had a Murphy folding
bed</B>
<P><B>which folded into a closet and left the room open for daytime
activities.</B>
<P><B>When I was about six years old, I was playing on the floor in the
living</B>
<P><B>room, about six feet from the French doors (which were open) leading
to the</B>
<P><B>bedroom. My mother was in the bathroom washing something in the sink.
I was</B>
<P><B>playing with modeling clay and as I played, I became aware of movement
from</B>
<P><B>the hall into the bedroom. Assuming it was my mother, I looked up.
I saw the</B>
<P><B>figure of a very old woman dressed in a floor-length dress which was
a dusty</B>
<P><B>faded blue-gray. Around her shoulders and head she wore a light brown
knit</B>
<P><B>shawl. The apparition was moving out of the hall and parallel to the
French</B>
<P><B>door opening. I screamed out and as I did, the thing turned and looked
at</B>
<P><B>me, as though it was as startled as I was. I will never forget that
look. I</B>
<P><B>have never seen such hatred and malevolence in a look since. It stared
at me</B>
<P><B>for a fraction of a second and disappeared, not fading, but in an
instant.</B>
<P><B>When I screamed, my mother came rushing out of the bathroom. She
later</B>
<P><B>confirmed that she had "felt" someone looking at her as she washed
in the</B>
<P><B>bathroom sink, although thinking it was me, she never turned to see
it</B>
<P><B>directly.</B>
<P><B>I know when most of you read this, you will say it was just a child's</B>
<P><B>imagination or a bad dream remembered. Not so. That was almost seventy
years</B>
<P><B>ago and the memory of that look is burned deeply in my memory. Do I
believe</B>
<P><B>in ghosts? On a logical level, no, but I know what I saw and it was
not a</B>
<P><B>dream or my imagination. My mother felt as strongly about it as I do
until</B>
<P><B>the day she died in the 70's. I don't know who or what it was and there
was</B>
<P><B>never any repetition of the event. The apartment was relatively new
and as</B>
<P><B>far as I know, had no history of any violent deaths occurring in it.</B>

<P><B>-norfolk virginia-I was staying with a friend for the week back in
the mid 70's(I am now 40)</B>
<P><B>and she lived down the road from my parents home.  On that Sunday I
woke up and went down stairs</B>
<P><B> to the kitchen,now this home is very old and large,and they live on
the water.I went down to </B>
<P><B>the kitchen to get a glass of water (by the way,my friend and her parents
were a church at the</B>
<P><B> time which I did not know,I thought noone had gotten up yet)anyway
I got the glass and I </B>
<P><B>felt a very strong presence of someone standing behind me.I turned
around and there was my </B>
<P><B>friends sister who had drowned 4 or 5 yrs earlier in that body of water,as
I got the glass I </B>
<P><B>felt a very strong presence of someone standing behind me I turned
and I saw a young girl </B>
<P><B>arund 18 or so in jeans and tee shirt and she was wet,I turned around
very fast and closed</B>
<P><B> my eyes I wanted to run but could not move,as I slowly opened my eyes
out in front of me</B>
<P><B> was the window that looks across the water,I saw a young girl in the
water waving her hands</B>
<P><B> back and fourth as if she was  in trouble,I ran to the back of the
house and as I got to </B>
<P><B>the edge of were the water meets the end of the back yard there was
no one there.I got in my </B>
<P><B>car and went home thinking I can't believe I saw what I saw.A day later
I got a phone call</B>
<P><B> from my girlfriend asking was everything ok because I left without
waiting for them to come</B>
<P><B> back so I could say good-bye.</B>
<P><B>I told her no I was not feeling well,she asked me if I had seen something
or heard something </B>
<P><B>I told her yes ,why did she asked me that she asked me if I had seen
her sister Betty anywere</B>
<P><B> in the house or outside I told her both places.She said for me not
to worry they see her</B>
<P><B>on&amp;off but it was the first time they knew of that she showed herself
to someone that is not</B>
<P><B> a family member. Needless to say I never went back to the house,I
still stay in contact with</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  litonjualf@earthlink.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Although I have had many and varied experiences in the paranormal
realm,</B>
<P><B>this particular experience was at once eerie and heartwarming and
proof</B>
<P><B>positive that there is life beyond this existence.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 7 years ago my husband and oldest daughter (our youngest wasn't</B>
<P><B>even conceived yet) were living in a four-plex apartment just 10
blocks</B>
<P><B>from where we are now.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My husband had left a few days before for a five-week training course
in</B>
<P><B>the midwest, and it was the first time my child and I had been left
by</B>
<P><B>ourselves for an extended amount of time.  Amazingly, I wasn't
nervous,</B>
<P><B>but was looking forward to the freedom his absence would afford me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was a Sunday, and the day before I had been initiated as a Reiki</B>
<P><B>Master Therapist. (Reiki is an ancient Tibetan healing technique that</B>
<P><B>both my husband and I - and even my young daughter - had been
initiated</B>
<P><B>into a year or so before)  I had worked hard to reach Master level
and</B>
<P><B>was one of 7 initiated that day.  It had been a very deep spiritual</B>
<P><B>experience, and one which had left me feeling not only more powerful</B>
<P><B>psychically, but also very scared of that power.  I wasn't sure that
I</B>
<P><B>was ready to assume the responsibility but there was no turning back</B>
<P><B>now!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, by the next evening, Sunday, I had calmed down and felt more
at</B>
<P><B>ease with my new power and responsibility and was settling in for a</B>
<P><B>relaxing phone chat with a dear friend.  My six-year old daughter had</B>
<P><B>already gone to sleep and there was no one else in the place - at
least</B>
<P><B>not anyone corporeal!</B>
<P><B>I was in the bedroom and had closed the door so as not to wake up my</B>
<P><B>daughter with my chatter.  Before I had done that I had turned out
the</B>
<P><B>lights in the living room, which I could see from my bedroom doorway.</B>
<P><B>While conversing I kept hearing the sound of footsteps right outside
the</B>
<P><B>door and in the hallway.  I would open the door but there would be
no</B>
<P><B>one there. It didn't bother me much, oddly enough, and I would just</B>
<P><B>close the door and continue talking. When I had gotten off the phone
and</B>
<P><B>was getting ready to go to sleep, I opened the bedroom door.  As I</B>
<P><B>glanced out I saw the silhouette of an adult person walking through
the</B>
<P><B>living room, illuminated by the streetlight outside through a window.
I</B>
<P><B>watched for a second, then for some reason simply turned off the
light</B>
<P><B>and went to bed without investigating.  I wasn't even nervous!</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day, I got my daughter and myself ready for school and work
and</B>
<P><B>left the place at the usual time in the morning.  Because my daughter</B>
<P><B>got out earlier than I did, I had my mother-in-law pick her up from</B>
<P><B>school and take her to our apartment and wait until I got home from</B>
<P><B>work. As I walked in the door, my mother-in-law's first words were,
"Why</B>
<P><B>did you hang these earrings on the door?"  I asked her what earrings
and</B>
<P><B>she opened her hand to display a pair of small gold dangling earrings</B>
<P><B>that had been a gift from my mother when I was very young, and which</B>
<P><B>were the only ones left from my childhood.  I had recently given them
to</B>
<P><B>my daughter as a keepsake from her grandmother who had died several</B>
<P><B>years before and who she had not had a chance to meet.  Because of
her</B>
<P><B>age (she was six) and her penchant for losing things, I was keeping
them</B>
<P><B>safe for her, wrapped in tissue paper in a small box in my dresser.
 I</B>
<P><B>don't even think she knew where they were.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother-in-law related that as they were walking up the steps to
the</B>
<P><B>apartment, they both spied something glittering on the screen door
and</B>
<P><B>as they approached the door could see one earring hanging on the
inside</B>
<P><B>of the screen door at adult eye-level.  Upon opening the screen door</B>
<P><B>they saw the other one dropped on the bottom of the door.</B>
<P><B>Of course, the door had been locked and there had been no one home</B>
<P><B>during the day, until they had gotten there, so how did the earrings
get</B>
<P><B>there, especially as carefully hidden away as they had been?</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I gazed on the earrings I got a very eerie yet warm feeling that
this</B>
<P><B>was a message from my mother, telling me that she was proud of my</B>
<P><B>accomplishments and wanted to let me know.  Although I had received</B>
<P><B>previous visits from my mother, none had any proof to back it up, and</B>
<P><B>now I had absolutely no doubt that she was there, watching over us
from</B>
<P><B>beyond.</B>

<P>
<P><B>A dear friend of my family was raised an only child in south</B>
<P><B>Mississippi. Two years before she was born her parents had a son that</B>
<P><B>only lived to be three months old. Her mother died when she was only</B>
<P><B>eleven. She grew up and four children of her own. She was very close
to</B>
<P><B>her children because they were the only immediate family she had
left.</B>
<P><B>I was just a toddler at the time so all the information you are</B>
<P><B>receiving is all second-hand. It was a cold night in February, 1980
when</B>
<P><B>my mom and her dear friend received the phone call from the Methodist</B>
<P><B>Hospital saying that her oldest son, Chad, and one of his friends
were</B>
<P><B>in a fatal car accident. They went on to tell them that Chad was
alright</B>
<P><B>but when the got to the hospital they found out that it was indeed
Chad</B>
<P><B>that was dead. </B>
<P><B>My mother's dear friend couldn't take this, she had already had
enough</B>
<P><B>tragedy in her life and now her that her first born was dead at</B>
<P><B>seventeen she didn't see any point in living if her children
couldn't.</B>
<P><B>Finally, a glimpse of hope helped her, at Chad's funeral after all
of</B>
<P><B>the flowers were laid down they took a picture of the flowered cross
at</B>
<P><B>the head of his grave sight. Once the film came back she noticed a
gray,</B>
<P><B>ashy figure appeared in the top left corner.  She could not  make it
out</B>
<P><B>and got it enlarged several times finally at the 11'x14' size the
image</B>
<P><B>became clear; it was a woman holding a baby looking over Chad's
grave.</B>
<P><B>She believes to this day that the woman was her mother holding her
first</B>
<P><B>born and taking care of her first born grandson that she had never
met.</B>
<P><B>This helped my mother's friend with the grieving process of her son</B>
<P><B>knowing that her mother was taking care of her baby boy.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  cacook@bright.net</B>
<P><B>  </B>
<P>
<P><B>My story is probably similar to others, but I'll share it with you
anyway.</B>
<P><B>Up until I was 18, I never had any experiences with ghosts. That soon</B>
<P><B>changed. My fiance's grandparents were buildinng a new house, far into
the</B>
<P><B>country. One night my fiance and I decided to stay the night out there
with</B>
<P><B>some friends. We stayed in the basement, it being the only section
that was</B>
<P><B>finished enough. The first thing we heard were footsteps from the
upstairs,</B>
<P><B>they were very distinct. Upon investigation we found nothing. Later,
my</B>
<P><B>fiance and I were upstairs in a room which would be the master bathroom.
We</B>
<P><B>heard what we thought was a baby crying. Later that evening, a
skateboard</B>
<P><B>slid across the floor right in front of us. We were all quite scared,
the</B>
<P><B>telephone lines had not been run to the house yet,and no one wanted
to go</B>
<P><B>outside to get in the car.</B>
<P><B>About a year later the house was complete, and my fiance and I moved
out</B>
<P><B>there. One day I was in the kitchen when I saw something far down the
lane.</B>
<P><B>There are glass doors that go down the whole side of the kitchen. I
looked</B>
<P><B>down, and when I looked back up it was closer. The odd thing was whenever
I</B>
<P><B>would look at it, it wouldn't move. The next time it got closer, I
could</B>
<P><B>make out blue clothing. Finally I left the kitchen.</B>
<P><B>The next night his grandmother told me a story. She had gotten out
of bed</B>
<P><B>to check something, when she walked past the stairway to the
basement,</B>
<P><B>there was a boy sitting on the top step. She said he had his hand on
his</B>
<P><B>chin, as if he were thinking.</B>
<P><B>She also said he was wearing blue. She ran to get her husband, she
turned</B>
<P><B>around as she got to his door and the boy was gone. After she finished
I</B>
<P><B>told her my experience. We both agreed not to tell my fiance, he gets</B>
<P><B>spooked quite easily. A couple of days later, my fiance was working
out in</B>
<P><B>the garage. When he walked in the house I knew something was wrong.
He then</B>
<P><B>told us that while in the garage, he looked out the window and a boy
was</B>
<P><B>staring in at him. Strange things still go on out there, but it seems</B>
<P><B>pretty harmless.</B>
<P><B> We moved into a new apartment, all seemed well. One day I baked cookies.
I</B>
<P><B>put them in a bowl and sat them on the stove.I came home from work,
before</B>
<P><B>my, now husband. But he arrived soon after. I rememberd the cookies
and</B>
<P><B>went to get some. The bowl was empty. I accused my husband of coming
home</B>
<P><B>and eating them, and we got into a fight. He denys knowing the
whereabout</B>
<P><B>of the cookies. Soon other things started happening. My vacumm was
found at</B>
<P><B>the top of the stairs, knockings on the wall. But the bathroom always
made</B>
<P><B>me feel uncomfortable. Our bedroom was right next to the bathroom,
you</B>
<P><B>could hear the water being turned on in the bathtub. Whenever I would
take</B>
<P><B>a shower, I felt that if I would just look out of the shower curtain
I</B>
<P><B>would see someone watching me. I never had the courage to do
this.Nothing</B>
<P><B>ever seemed to happen to my husband, until one night. We had turned
off all</B>
<P><B>the lights it was completely dark. I was already in bed and my husband
was</B>
<P><B>on his way. As I laid there my eyes focused on a smokey white form
on the</B>
<P><B>ceiling. I don't know why I wasn't scared, I was trying to figure this
form</B>
<P><B>out. My husband laid down next to me, and I pointed it out and asked
him if</B>
<P><B>he saw it. He jumped out of bed, saying some choice words, and flipped
the</B>
<P><B>lights on. From my view of this form, all I saw was what could be
desribed</B>
<P><B>as a small white cloud. From my husbands view he says he could make
out</B>
<P><B>facial features. Thhe only other "ghost" I've ever seen was  white
mist</B>
<P><B>that once floated pass me, leaving a scent of my late grandma's
perfume.</B>
<P><B>We now live in a non-haunted apartment. We still argue over the
missing</B>
<P><B>cookies, what would a ghost want with cookies?</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>       I am not the one to believe in ghosts. I do like however to
get</B>
<P><B>scared to death reading the stories. The experiences I've had I
passed</B>
<P><B>off as me tripping.</B>
<P><B>        When I was about 13 years old, I lived with my dad and his</B>
<P><B>girlfriend Julia. Julia had 3 kids of her own one was from my dad.</B>
<P><B>Anyway the house was a three bedroom all the bedrooms were connected
by</B>
<P><B>a door. My parents bedroom had a laundry room added to it, They had
a</B>
<P><B>red curtain on the window which length was the entire length of the</B>
<P><B>room. This curtain made everything in the room dark, and whoever was
in</B>
<P><B>front of the window figure would be a siluetted.Okay the point is my</B>
<P><B>brother Terry was a practical joker. To this day he swears he had</B>
<P><B>nothing to do with this, knowing Terry he would have told me.</B>
<P><B>            This day no one was home except us two. Terry was in his</B>
<P><B>room. I failed to mention his entrance into the next room was locked</B>
<P><B>from the other side so their is no way he could have gotten into my</B>
<P><B>parents room. So anyway I was  about to go into my parents room to
put a</B>
<P><B>load of clothes into the washing machine. I was walking not watching</B>
<P><B>where I was going and my attention was on the bedroom floor. When I</B>
<P><B>heard what I thought was noises in the laundry room. Like some one
was</B>
<P><B>looking for something. I looked up to see the siluette of someone</B>
<P><B>looking down and bending and like actually looking for something. I</B>
<P><B>stopped and asked Terry, what he was looking for. The figure stood
up it</B>
<P><B>was quite tall to be Terry, but it's head was shaped just like his.
I</B>
<P><B>started walking toward the laundry room without paying any more</B>
<P><B>attention to the figure because I figured it was my brother. But the</B>
<P><B>hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, When I looked back at the</B>
<P><B>figure while I was walking toward it, it seemed surprised that I was</B>
<P><B>walking toward it. I know it was looking straight at me. It never made
a</B>
<P><B>sound just started gliding toward me staring at me. Real slow because</B>
<P><B>the way the room was it would not have took long to close the</B>
<P><B>distance.Anyway like I was saying the hairs on my neck stood straight
up</B>
<P><B>like they are now just remembering, a voice said into my ear like</B>
<P><B>someone standing right next to me said to turn around calmly and walk</B>
<P><B>out the room. It didn't take me twice. I didn't care where the voice</B>
<P><B>came from I just wanted to leave. As I walked out the room back into
the</B>
<P><B>light I was about to turn around when the voice told me not to look</B>
<P><B>back. I walked to see where my brother was, even though it was plain
and</B>
<P><B>simple I had just seen a ghost, I still hoped it was my brother trying
to</B>
<P><B>scare me. I walked into my brother's room. My brother was fast asleep
in</B>
<P><B>his bed. I tried to shake him awake he told me to leave him alone.
I</B>
<P><B>went back my parents room door but nothing was there, of course. I</B>
<P><B>watched t.v for about 30 minutes and went back into my brother room
he</B>
<P><B>was still asleep.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>My fiance Shane and I have moved into our new apartment a week ago.
The very</B>
<P><B>first day in it, I felt a presense.  It started after  Shane and I
were</B>
<P><B>intimate.  I felt a very male presence and it was not happy.  I knew
right</B>
<P><B>where he was standing and felt like i could hear his breathing.  mostly
i felt</B>
<P><B>his rage and jealousy. Frightened, i tried to wake Shane but couldn't.
 The</B>
<P><B>next day, we were cuddling on the couch, and he "arrived" again. This
time,</B>
<P><B>Shane felt him too.  Whithin days, the curtains started moving,
faucets</B>
<P><B>turned themselves on, hide and go seek with belongings and knocking
on walls</B>
<P><B>all began.  I talked to him and thought my acknowledging him would
help...it</B>
<P><B>only seemed to worsen things. I was standing in our door way, when
I took a</B>
<P><B>step, felt something brush my hand, and when I looked at it, there
was a cut</B>
<P><B>about two inches along my ring finger.  Also bruises started show up
on both</B>
<P><B>shane and I. We don't know where they came from.  I am finding scratches
on me</B>
<P><B>with no clue where they came from.  The only time Shane feels him is
after a</B>
<P><B>romantic time with me, a hug, a kiss, anything.  People who come over,
feel</B>
<P><B>something,  but can't tell what.  I have tried to bind it and am having
a Roman</B>
<P><B>Catholic priest  bless here, but I just want my home back, without
his harm. I</B>
<P><B>can deal with the knocks, the things moving by themselves, but not
his hatred</B>
<P><B>and harmful injuries. Before I tried to bind him, he was getting more
violent</B>
<P><B>towards us. Now we just feel him, and his rage.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is completely true. I have witnessed this first hand. I was the
female</B>
<P><B>guest.</B>
<P><B>My husbands grandfather had fought in WWII. He had brought back with
him</B>
<P><B>badges and guns stolen from German soldiers that he had fought and
killed.</B>
<P><B>One of the sets was given to my husband just before we moved into our
first</B>
<P><B>apartment. They hadn't been out of the box that they were kept in
since</B>
<P><B>grandpa had come back from Germany. I thought they were very
interesting</B>
<P><B>and needed to be displayed. BIG MISTAKE!! After I had taken them from
the</B>
<P><B>box, I started seeing things in the apartment. Just little shadows
out of</B>
<P><B>the corner of my eye. They always had the shape of a person but they
were</B>
<P><B>brown, like a cloud of dust. The shadows were there even when no
source</B>
<P><B>could be found for them, and always around where the badges were
displayed.</B>
<P><B>I started to get really freaked out so I put the badges in a new box
and</B>
<P><B>put them in the closet of my baby's nursery. One night about two
weeks</B>
<P><B>after I had done this I went to put my baby to bed, as I walked down
the</B>
<P><B>hall I saw a man standing in the doorway of the nursery. I saw just
his</B>
<P><B>figure outlined by the moonlight streaming in from the window behind
him.</B>
<P><B>As I walked tword it, it slammed the door shut. I turned and ran, baby
and</B>
<P><B>all to the neighbors. I stayed there until I heard my husband come
up the</B>
<P><B>stairs to our apartment. After that I begged my husband to put them
in the</B>
<P><B>storage unit. We moved a few years later to a small house. My husband</B>
<P><B>decided to put the box in our closet. One night while my husband was
on the</B>
<P><B>night shift something grabbed my foot. Thinking my husband had come
home</B>
<P><B>early I opened my eyes to look at him, but noone was there. I screamed
and</B>
<P><B>it started sqeezing my foot and violently shaking it. I beged it to
stop,</B>
<P><B>and it did.  The only people in the house at the time were myself and
my 4</B>
<P><B>year old son.  I again moved the box to the spare bedroom. This is
when it</B>
<P><B>started to get really bad. My husband would not part with these items
so I</B>
<P><B>put them in a corner of this spare room. The room was always cold
after</B>
<P><B>that and had the smell of rotten food. My husband atributed this to
bad</B>
<P><B>insulation and a mouse dead in the walls. This room did not stink
before</B>
<P><B>the box, and it wasen't cold either. I had an antique train set that
had</B>
<P><B>not worked in years on display in this room. At night the whistle
would</B>
<P><B>sound and you could hear the train running on the track. It had no</B>
<P><B>batteries and no electricity to run on. On night  my husband was
feeling</B>
<P><B>very brave and decided to go stop it. As he ran into the room the
train</B>
<P><B>whistle blew very loud and the train was running on the track. He yelled
at</B>
<P><B>it to stop, it flipped the train and threw it about 10 feet into the</B>
<P><B>hallway, missing my husbands head by inches. My husband locked the
door to</B>
<P><B>the room and forbid any of us from opening it. We heard no more for
about a</B>
<P><B>year. I had some guests stay over and we had no where for them to
stay</B>
<P><B>other than this room. Since we had not heard or seen anything since
the</B>
<P><B>train incident, and I figured that it would be safe for them to sleep
in</B>
<P><B>that room. My female guest complained that she saw a man standing by
the</B>
<P><B>closet, which was where the box now was. I told her that it was just
a</B>
<P><B>shadow and everything would be fine. I had not told them any of the
story.</B>
<P><B>The next night as she was preparing for bed something pushed her down
on</B>
<P><B>the bed and would not let her get up until she screamed.  She refused
to</B>
<P><B>sleep in the room saying that she was terribly frightened by what was
in</B>
<P><B>there. She said she felt it wanted to hurt her. They went to stay at
a</B>
<P><B>nearby hotel for the duration of the visit. We locked the room again.
Then</B>
<P><B>we started to hear growls and moans from the room, and the door knob
would</B>
<P><B>twist like it wanted out. My husband decided to get rid of the items.
He</B>
<P><B>put them in a plastic bag and sealed it with wax. We said a prayer
over it</B>
<P><B>and told whatever it was to leave our family. He then threw the items
in</B>
<P><B>the nearby dump. We have had no problems with that room, or anything
else</B>
<P><B>since.  </B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>My husband and I purchased and old English Tutdor house in Norfolk
about</B>
<P><B>two years ago.  The house had not been lived in for several years.
 I</B>
<P><B>couldn't even get to the fireplace in the huge living room because
boxes</B>
<P><B>and old furniture were every where.  The house was in disrepair but
as</B>
<P><B>soon as I walked in the door I told the agent to write a full price</B>
<P><B>offer that I just had to have the house.  She was surprised because
I</B>
<P><B>had not gone much further than the front door. I bought it and helped</B>
<P><B>the man that owned it get all of his belongings out.  He had
inherited</B>
<P><B>the house from the owner.  She grew up in the house and when her
parents</B>
<P><B>died she stayed on there. She was an invalid and she left the house
to</B>
<P><B>the man because he took care of her everyday for about twenty or so</B>
<P><B>years.  She had never married and  died without any family.  They
were</B>
<P><B>very close and we thought his imagination had the best of him because
he</B>
<P><B>sat us down before we went to closing and told us the house was
haunted</B>
<P><B>and if we wanted out of the contract he would understand.  It was his</B>
<P><B>dream to bring the house back to life but he became ill and was not
able</B>
<P><B>to do that.  We were actually the third owners of the house.  Things</B>
<P><B>started happening shortly after we moved in.  We just shrugged it off</B>
<P><B>and made up excuses.</B>
<P><B>Lights would flicker on and off and we would smell a real sweet smell
in</B>
<P><B>certain parts of the house. We have a cat and he was always a real
calm</B>
<P><B>one but when we moved there he was a nervous wreck.. He was so jumpy
and</B>
<P><B>he would all of the sudden hump up and start hissing and swatting at</B>
<P><B>air.  The first month we were there he some how managed to get
himself</B>
<P><B>in the bathroom and close the door behind him.  We came home on more</B>
<P><B>than one occasion to find him in the bathroom and the tub full of
water</B>
<P><B>not to mention the window open.  I became very good friends with the
man</B>
<P><B>we bought the house from and he showed me pictures  of the lady and
he</B>
<P><B>gave me some of her things from when she was a little girl.  He also</B>
<P><B>gave me some of the antique's that belonged to her.  I already had
a</B>
<P><B>house full of antique's myself.  One of the pieces that I have is a</B>
<P><B>secretary and I moved it where I thought I would like to have it. 
I</B>
<P><B>don't know why but for some reason I moved it the very same day.  The</B>
<P><B>man I bought the house from came over for a visit and when he walked
in</B>
<P><B>he said"Oh my, Martha had a secretary just like that and that is the</B>
<P><B>exact place she had it.  From then on things got interesting.
 Whenever</B>
<P><B>someone would go near the secretary the room would fill with the
smell</B>
<P><B>of perfume.  It was confined to that area and not any other part of
the</B>
<P><B>house.  We didn't dicuss this with any one because we thought they
would</B>
<P><B>think we were crazy.  On several visits from friends the smell
appeared</B>
<P><B>and the visitors would always ask what is that smell and the cat
would</B>
<P><B>start acting real weird and running around that area swatting at the</B>
<P><B>air.  Shortly after that the people would leave</B>
<P><B>The strange thing was that I always felt very safe in that great big
old</B>
<P><B>house and I was very happy there.  My husband's job transferred us
back</B>
<P><B>home to New Orleans and he left months before I did.  We had not</B>
<P><B>finished renovating the house and I was getting it ready to go on the</B>
<P><B>market.  I had spent an entire day in what I called "Martha's
bedroom".</B>
<P><B>The room that she pretty much spent the last ten years of her eighty</B>
<P><B>years in.  I was down on my hands and knees scrubbing the floors, then
I</B>
<P><B>painted the room, set up an antigue bed, put some pretty pictures on
the</B>
<P><B>wall and retired for the night to the third floor.  The next morning,</B>
<P><B>which was in February I went downstairs and before I walked in the</B>
<P><B>living room I could smell her perfume.  I got to the point where I
would</B>
<P><B>tell her good morning  and for some reason I was drawn to the other
side</B>
<P><B>of the house, up a few stairs to the landing opening into her
bedroom.</B>
<P><B>The door had always been kept shut and it was open wide. the windows</B>
<P><B>were open and the sun was streaming in.  I looked down on the floor
and</B>
<P><B>there were three rose petals....fresh rose petals.....</B>
<P><B>I was alone in the house and had been for some time.  I picked the</B>
<P><B>petals up and put them in my pocket and walked back through the
living</B>
<P><B>room past the secretary the smell was so strong.  I went to the phone</B>
<P><B>and called the man I bought the house from.  He was in North Carolina
at</B>
<P><B>the time.  He was very calm and  he asked me what color they were...i</B>
<P><B>told him they were a deep burgundy and all he said was that was her</B>
<P><B>favortie color.  He asked me if I had done anything to the house and
I</B>
<P><B>told him.  He didn't seem surprised at all.  I kept saying "But this
is</B>
<P><B>Feb. there aren't any roses on her bushes in the garden.  Another
very</B>
<P><B>strange thing happened a few days later.  I went with a friend to a</B>
<P><B>grave yard.  I had never been there before and we were going to put</B>
<P><B>flowers on his mothers grave.  He was walking behind me and all of
the</B>
<P><B>sudden I felt a burst of cold air go right through my body and I</B>
<P><B>screamed and turned around and he was standing there with his mouth
open</B>
<P><B>holding his chest and he said 'Did you feel that". We both just stood</B>
<P><B>there a few moments and I glanced down at a grave near my feet and
it</B>
<P><B>was her grave.  It was Martha;s grave.  I didn't even know she was</B>
<P><B>buried there.  I had the most errie feeling for days. There was no
more</B>
<P><B>movement in the house after that , no more smells or anything.  It</B>
<P><B>really made me sad because I felt like I had come to know her.  I
know</B>
<P><B>that sounds crazy.  I have gone back to visit the house and was able
to</B>
<P><B>go in.  I felt nothing at all when I stepped inside.  I went in every</B>
<P><B>room hoping she was still there but she has gone.  I talked in length</B>
<P><B>with the new owners and they said they knew the house was haunted
when</B>
<P><B>they bought it but they had not smelled her perfume or had any
strange</B>
<P><B>things happen at all.  They said they thought it would be great to
have</B>
<P><B>a house with a ghost in it but she had not shown herself at all and
it's</B>
<P><B>been well overo year and a half now  I don't think a day goes by that
I</B>
<P><B>don't think about that house and the lady that lived  in it even
after</B>
<P><B>she died. I have alot of her belongings and I think sometimes that
is</B>
<P><B>why I have such strong feelings for that house. Do you have any</B>
<P><B>explanations for the smell of perfume and the rose petals.?  Most</B>
<P><B>importantly what do you think happened at that grave yard.?  Why do
you</B>
<P><B>think I have such strong feelings about a person I didn't know?  Any</B>
<P><B>thoughts or comments would be appreciated.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=swing>The Park Swing</A></B>
</H3><P><B> By: BCDelgado@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>     Hello.  My name is Benito .  I would like to share a ghost</B>
<P><B>experience with you that took place in a small Texas town. </B>
<P><B>     One foggy morning during my band class, a student came running
in</B>
<P><B>late.  He yelled out, "ya'll need to come see this swing that is</B>
<P><B>swinging by itself at the park."  With those words the whole band
class</B>
<P><B>ran out the back door to look at what was happening.  My first look
at</B>
<P><B>the empty seat swinging back and forth at a medium swing was one of</B>
<P><B>shock.  I was confused on how the swing was swinging by itself in
still</B>
<P><B>air.  Others were frightened by the experience.  While the remaining
few</B>
<P><B>tried to convince others that it was just the wind moving it. (But
like</B>
<P><B>I said there was not even a breeze that day and if there was any wind</B>
<P><B>the other swings would also be swinging.)  </B>
<P><B>     Throught the whole day the swing continued to swing without any</B>
<P><B>pace change.  Many of the students in school were leaving during
there</B>
<P><B>breaks to see the empty swing.  Many of the teachers in school were</B>
<P><B>tired of all the commotion that was going on with the swing that they</B>
<P><B>banned anybody from going to see the swing.  Yet there were some of
us</B>
<P><B>that still decided that we were going to go see the swing close up
to</B>
<P><B>see what was causing it to swing.  </B>
<P><B>   In my last period class, which was athletics, four of us decided
to</B>
<P><B>go out to the park which was only about 80 yards away from the
school.</B>
<P><B>The funny thing about this experience is that I wasn't afraid to go
out</B>
<P><B>to the swing untill we where about 20 yards away from it.  The closer
we</B>
<P><B>got to the swing the slower it rocked untill finally it stopped.  We</B>
<P><B>became frightned and turned back.  When we turned back and walked
away</B>
<P><B>the swing began to rock at a slow pace untill finally it returned to
a</B>
<P><B>regular swing and pace.  We were so confused that we decided to make
it</B>
<P><B>stop so we rushed back to the swing and without hesataion tied it up</B>
<P><B>against one leg of its A-frame.  </B>
<P><B>     I'm sorry that my explination is a little sketchy but I am
really</B>
<P><B>tring to keep it short.  You may think that this is a hoax yet I kid
you</B>
<P><B>not, this is a true store because there was 50 to 60 students who saw
it</B>
<P><B>during my band class not to mention anyone else in school.</B>
<P><B>     Over the next couple of years many people have told stories,
gave</B>
<P><B>explinations and some possible answers for what everybody saw that
day.</B>
<P><B>For instance one story was that there was once a house at that site
and</B>
<P><B>a little girl that lived there was hit by a drunk driver.  Another
story</B>
<P><B>was that a young girl broke here neck on that swing because she
jumped</B>
<P><B>of the swing when it was  swinging too high.</B>
<P><B>     My answer is that maybe there is a ghost, but how did it get
there?</B>
<P><B>It has been five years since it has happend and to this day it has
never</B>
<P><B>happened again.</B>
<P><B>  If you have any questions please feel free to reply.  Thank you for</B>
<P><B>listening to my experience.</B>
