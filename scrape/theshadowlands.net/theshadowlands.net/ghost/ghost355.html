<p class="MsoNormal">I'm probably like most people, I didn't believe in ghosts
until I encountered one. My wife and I used to live in <st1:place><st1:City>Pasadena</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Texas</st1:State></st1:place>(southeast oh <st1:City><st1:place>Houston</st1:place></st1:City>).
We had bought a house back in 1996. It was built in 1951. The first encounter I
had was on a windy night, my wife was taking a shower and I was watching TV.
The back door opened slowly, almost all the way, then it closed, by itself. I
figured it was the wind making it open and close, so I got up to lock the door.
I almost dropped my keys when I realized the deadbolt was already set. I told
my wife about it, she laughed and said I must have dozed off on the couch and
dreamed it. I knew better. Then, not long after that, my wife said she heard
someone walking through the house. She thought it was our daughter since she is
proned to sleepwalking. She went to her room and realized that it couldn't have
been our daughter, there was not enough time for her to have been walking
around, then gotten back in bed and pulled the covers around her. My wife has
also heard the microwave bell go off in the middle of the night, when all of us
were asleep. We have a pair of pueter lamps on the end tables of our couch.
They are a 2 bulb system, with pull chains for each bulb. At least once a week,
we would be sitting watching TV or reading when all of a sudden, a chain on one
of the lamps would start banging the side of the lamp. Since they were pueter,
it was loud. The ghost never tried to harm us, so we think it was a child playing
with us. Thank you for letting me write to you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Weekend of <st1:date year="2005" day="27" month="5">5-27-05</st1:date></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: blanketal@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Before I attempt to recall this quick moment over a weekend
meant for fun and enjoying tranquility, I'll need to tell you first that: </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">1. My parents own a cabin in <st1:place><st1:City>Lupton</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Michigan</st1:State></st1:place>. We travel there every other
weekend, usually, and pretty much keep the place in tact and enjoy ourselves.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">2. There aren't many residents that actually live in the
houses around our cabin, besides one family, so many different people are up
there at all times.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now, the night before this completely dumbfounding
experience was one of some slight alcohol comsumption.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had a decent 7 hour sleep from <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2a.m.- 9a.m.</st1:time> I had woken up at 9 to turn over so the pain
in my stomach would subside. As I was doing that, I heard the storm door in the
living room open. The subject proceeded to walk past my open doorway as I was
sitting up. I was able to glance through my sleepiness to see what seemed to be
my mother. It went fast, right into the bathroom. No noise was being made in
the bathroom, and I fell asleep again. <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30 a.m.</st1:time>
comes along with me waking up to my parents coming home from grocery shopping.
My mom was asking my dad with a laugh "Honey, did you put these out here
for us?" he replied with a no and some assuring words that he did not
place them there. These things they were talking of were three granola bars
with plums. Mother came into my room and immediately asked me about the granola
bars. I didn't tell her what I had saw for some odd reason. I just didn't feel
like explaining it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Throughout the day we asked several others around and
received no confirmation. A two hour drive back home is what I wanted more than
sleeping there another night. This was all definitely a confusing, jumbled mess
of events, yet, I will return another day, hoping to find out more. Thank YOU
for reading THIS.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">a few years ago i had a run in with my grandfather who died
my mother was 15 years old. That night for no apparent reason i woke up at
about <st1:time minute="30" hour="2">2:30 A.M.</st1:time> and looked across the
hall that separates my room from my mom and dad's room and thats when i saw my
grandpa moving toward my room i was so scared i put my head under my pillow and
tried to fall asleep. This sort of the thing happened many times after that but
all i would get was a quick glance before i would hide my head.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Bed</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Stimpykate638@wmconnect.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">during the summer of 2004 i spent 4 and a half months in
switzerland, working as a nanny/farmhand/waitress/dishwasher/janitor for a
family who ran a little cafe and crappy hotel for hikers way up in the alps. my
room had two twin beds which were designed so you could push them together to
make one big bed or pull them apart to make smaller ones. i started out with my
beds pushed together, as i wasn't sharing a room at first. a few weeks later,
they told me some other girl was coming up to help out and she'd be sleeping in
my room so i pulled the beds apart. they stayed apart, and the second one was
mostly unoccupied (my roomie slept elsewhere most of the time). as this girl
left, a second one came to stay and help out- she didn't like our room much
either, apparently, she didn't sleep there anymore than the previous girl. now
that we've got through the boring setup crap... </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">one night about halfway through girl #2's time with us,
surprise- her bed was empty. i was lying in bed attempting to sleep, and i was
almost there, just at the point your brain starts to shut off, you know? and i
heard breathing from her bed, literally two and a half feet away from me. i
looked over, thinking maybe i had drifted off and she'd come back, but there
was nothing. bed empty, unmade, and breathing heavily as if in a deep sleep. so
i did what anyone else would do- i buried my head in my blankets and went to
sleep. this happened a few times after that, maybe five times during my stay.
after the first time i began paying attention to the clock and realized when
this breathing thing did happen, it was always around the same time. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">so this girl leaves, and number three shows up, sleeping in
the breathing bed (hell if I was going near that thing). she ended up leaving
us early for reasons i won't go into becuase it doesn't matter. the cook had
the room next to me, and her husband was coming to visit overnight. the last
place i wanted to be was aginst their wall, cause i'd been there before,
and...yeah. nothing i cared to hear, hehe! the second bed having been moved to
the other side of the room, i slept in it that night to give cook and hubby
their privacy. i woke up at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="2">2.30am</st1:time>
as if i had been violently startled to the oh-so pleasant feeling of being
stared at malevolently, like somebody was boring holes into my skull. of course
i didn't look, i was terrified, and again i buried my head under my covers
until i fell asleep. needless to say, i didn't sleep in that bed again! nobody
else ever mentioned anything odd happening, but now that i think about it, none
of them ever gave me a straight answer about not wanting to sleep in our room,
either. i just figured i stank, maybe they picked up on the Bed Thing too,
hehe.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Not too long ago I visited the Lost Sea Cave-Well me and my
neice were just standing around and all of a sudden we felt a cold chill and
something that felt like it was hairy brush against our legs. We didn't pay any
attention to it but later on the woman that shows us around told us about a
jaguar that fell down there and died and as it turns out we weren't the only
ones that felt it...Also one time when I looked over from one side of the cave
I saw a figure that looked tranparent almost at the time she was tellin us
about a union soldier that got shot by a confedarate soldier.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Father</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1957 my Father and his best friend were killed in a
hunting accident. I was only 7yrs old. I remember his funeral and the many
people who came to pay their respects. That night I went to bed at the usual
time and was awakened by something. I glanced at the foot of my bed where a
large chair was and saw a ghostly figure of a man sitting in this chair. At
first I was afraid but the longer I stared at this figure I realized it was my
Father. He made no movement but merely sat in this chair. After a couple of
minutes I decided to communicate with my Father so I sat up in bed and
proceeded to crawl down toward the foot of the bed. Before I could reach the
foot of the bed my Father's image faded away. It was then that I felt afraid
and climbed in bed with my Mother. However, I didn't tell her about seeing my
Father until several days later. All I know is that this wasn't a dream and I
was very thankful to have had the opportunity to have experienced this. I don't
think my Mother ever believed me about this but it doesn't matter because the
memory of it has stayed firmly in my mind. Thank you for letting me tell you my
story.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Many sightings of a little boy wandering in the recreation
area at night is seen, hes usually seen walking around the area where the old
fire house burnt down around the late 1800's. Also, numerous times, an old man
that looks poor is seen wandering. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Being that we live on long island and pride ourselves on
ghost hunting, myself and a group of my friends decided to visit the so called
haunted elementary school. After getting lost on our way there, we found the
school at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4am</st1:time> (friday night)
with the help of my cousin( who went to the school when she was younger and is
too creeped out to go there by the playground). We drove around at first and
didnt see any cars or any people so we decided to walk through the field. I
wanted to go into the playground where the little boy is supposed to be lurking
but the three guys i was with were a little too weirded out ( i was a little
scared too, i must admit) So we walk by the park in a hurry and get to the car,
and start to drive out. We were in the front of the school, ready to pull out
and waiting for the light to change, talking amongst ourselves saying how we
should go back and see if that ''poor looking ghost'' is around. A minute or so
passed while i was on the phone with my cousin, then i looked over to the drive
and saw his terrified and shocked facial expression while he was looking in the
rearview mirror. All of a sudden i hear a shreaking scream and banging on the
trunk of the car. I turned around and saw this shaggy black figure banging and
screaming on the trunk of the car, we bolted down great east neck rd and
eventually pulled over because we were all shaking. The shocked expression on
the driver's face was due to the fact that he saw this black figure come out of
nowhere and charge suddenly at our car at full speed. After a few minutes and a
couple cups of coffee in dunkin donuts, we decided to go back to see if it was
someone just trying to mess with us ( eventhough we all knew inside that
someone appearing at of nowhere at 4am and slamming on the back of our car
seemed a tad paranormal). Out of the three guys i was with, only one decided to
get out and go back with me. We didnt go near the playground or the field, and
just stood towards the front making noises so it'd come back. After a few
minutes of us clapping and whistling, the two guys in the car started to scream
at the top of the lungs for us to get back in the car. We ran in and drove off,
because they saw a black figure begininng to shuffle slowly leaning right to
left, coming out of the playground towards us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, i've never been that scared in my entire life.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So, my hauntings started when I was about 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had this strange dream one </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started
with a lady walking around or cultasac.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">, this happened to me when I was in my late teens, I think.
I was helping a friend move into her dormitory. We were outside when I locked
eyes, with a very handsome<span style="">&nbsp; </span>blue eyed guy
also helping a friend move in. We were unable to stop looking at each other
throughout the entire move. We were both very instantly attracted to each other
and we both knew it although neither of us approached the other. Later in the
day as i was sitting alone in my girlfriends room, i got the sudden urge to get
up and open the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did and directly
across the door in the next room was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nick, just standing there looking at me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He hadnt knocked on the door or anything,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our meeting each other was incredible.
Anyway, we of course became a couple very quickly. We had so much in common,
and I was very head over heels over him and I felt that the feeling was mutual.
About 2 months later, Nick told me that he would be going to <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>
with some friends for the weekend, and that he would be picking me up at the
dormitory that Sunday. He dropped me off at work , we kissed and the last thing
he said to me was that he would come for me on sunday. Then he left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that moment I was standing behind the
counter ( I worked at Mcdonalds at the time ) and in my head I clearly saw and
heard a man telling me that Nick was dead. I knew, absolutley Knew with all
certainty that he was not coming back from <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>
alive. Despite this knowledge , I dismissed it as my imagination, although I
couldnt think of why I would imagine something so horrible. Anyway, of course
Sunday comes along, and I am waiting for Nick. I went downstairs and used the
pay phone to call him. A man answered the phone,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and when I asked for Nick ,he said I'm sorry
but Nick is dead. I was completely dumbfounded and I said to him, thats not
funny. The gentleman answered,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am his
Uncle and I would not joke about this. Nick suffered a heart attack and died.
As it turns out Nick had a drug problem that i was not aware of . He did a
speedball (cocaine and heroin) and his heart stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, as I said I was completely numb, and I
just hung up the phone and went upstairs to my girlfriend. I knew at that
moment<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and still believe to this day the
Nick and I were soul mates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing else
can account for our unusual attraction and meeting, or how I was made privy to
this terrible knowledge. Time went on of course,and eventually I dealt with his
death as best i could. But every time I would think of him, my heart would<span style="">&nbsp; </span>skip a bit, because I knew that he was going
to die. This clairvoyancy stayed with me throughout the years, although it has
diminshed significantly. This is my story! Let me know if you decide to put it
on the website ! Thanks</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Before I was invited to join my friend's ghost hunting group
they had told me about a house on Doublechurch road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It got it's name from the fact that there are
only two churches along that road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
didn't tell me much, because they wanted to see if I'd experience what they
had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, a week before I went there
with them I was having dreams of the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had never seen it before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Something would give me a sense of being lured there in my dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bothered me so bad that I spoke to my
church minister about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me
simply not to go there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
listen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went to the house which was
abandoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somebody owned it but never
fixed it up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What frightened me was the
fact that it was exactly as I had seen it in my dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many things happened over the course of
several visits. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>My friends recounted
stories of seeing a glowing white panther like creature near the frontporch
steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an old windmill there
that would actually answer yes or no questions!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would creak once for yes and twice for no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We don't understand how it happened, but
there was no wind or outside factors that we could percieve that would cause
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A friend of mine went there one
night on halloween with the group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
put his left foot on the porch and suddenly couldn't move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most horrible thing there is what I
percieve to be a demon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen a
hulking creature about 6-7' tall hunched over that looked kind of like a
gargoyle with horns coming out of its head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am not the only one to have seen it either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of my friends have seen it without any of
us ever saying anything about it before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The describiton is always the same too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've experienced other things there as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was there one night with my ghost hunting
group when I foolishly tried to challenge whatever it was that was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of my friends had gone inside the house,
I stayed outside with 3 of my other friends because I'm a big guy and it was an
old house and I figured there may be some real physical dangers inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I stayed outside challenging the
ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friends kept yelling at to
stop when I heard footsteps on the porch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I turned around and there was nothing on the porch!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt something go by me and I looked down
and I could see footprints being made in the grass beside me as if something
was walking past me!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I heard a
noise coming from the barn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend
came out of the house , and like me he's sensitive to spirits, and he looked
around as if trying to sense something.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He then looked at the barn and said, "It's in the barn."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of my friends looked at me and said,
"We know".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We then headed down
to the barn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were walking to the
barn we heard what sounded like two horses and a carrage actually go through us
on the small road to the barn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
a lot of activity that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we get
to the barn and two of my friends go around the other side and go in, because
that's where the only door was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My one
friend who is sensitive too was one of them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We stood there for a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
getting chills and goose bumps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a
sudden one my friends that was with me got wide eyed and said, "They're
messing with stuff they shouldn't be!".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When my two friends came out later they were carrying some old books
they found inside the barn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't what
they were, i never looked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they
were in there we also kept hearing a screen door slamming shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We asked them about it and they said there
was no screen door!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've also seen black
shapes the size of midgets running around in the yard, I've heard footsteps
going up and down the stairs from inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stories behind all of this is that one
night the farmer killed his family in their sleep and hung himself in the
basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There has also been records of
satanistic rituals in the basement and whatnot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A lot of people who go there do get a strange urge to go into the
cellar/basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've experienced that
myself, but I've never gone in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One more
thing,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house is in the middle of a
field and even on a night of a full moon the house is dark and shadowy and you
can barely make it out without getting right inside the road to the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well i have a few storys for you. the first ghostly thing
i've ever seen was one day with my friends we were hanging out in the cemetery
after dark, just trying to have a good time and see if we can find anything
weird. well we were sitting on the far right side of the cemetery facing south
from d street. we notice that this tree we were sitting by had a strange
looking face on it. it was weird but the light of the moon on the tree showed a
old looking face it was large and look undeniabley like a face. it freaked us
out a bit and i've never seen anything that looked so much like a face show up
like that did that night.( note it was on a full moon when that happened)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another thing that happened to me and another
friend late one night. we were walking down the cemetery through the loop. as
we were coming up on the corner. i recalled a time when my wicken friend requested
some dirt from a grave for her spells and stuff. well a few months back i had
kicked some dirt up from the grave for her and bottled it up. (not much of
course but enough to make a 3 inch groove in the dirt right next to the tomb
stone.) well i was telling my friend about it and i showed him the groove that
was next to the stone. i put my foot into the groove first to find it to show
my friend, then my friend put his foot into the groove to see what i was
talking about. well we began to walk some more then i heard this noise. i
stopped and told him to listen. it was like a howling noise almost. it was
really hollow but high at the same time. sorta like when you blow into a glass
bottle but different. a noise i've never heard before. there was no way it
could have been anything in the surrounding area because it was 3 in the
morning and no one was out. then i got this cold chill running through my body.
it was a warm night since it was august and it was near 94 degrees that day.
and out of no where it got cold. i felt goose bumps run through my body. my
friend had felt it too. the noise was getting louder and the chill was just so
strange. we began to freak out and after a few minutes we decided to take a run
for it. i think i may have disturbed something with the dirt i removed. but it
happened shortly after i showed my friend the groove. it was the most realistic
ghost experience i have ever encountered. i have been in there numerous of
times and there is always a feeling of presence when you enter. but yeah thats
the two most promanant encounters i've had and i thought that it may be of
interest to you. Thank you </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A couple years ago I went ghost hunting on a regular
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Harpers Ferry</st1:place>,
Wva was one of the most frequented sites we went to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night a friend and I went there on one of
our ghost hunting trips.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was tired of
never seeing anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm a sensitive,
so I can know when they're around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
just don't see them very often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
way there we stopped at a store to get something to drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also picked up some little debbie blueberry
muffins and brownies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way there
my friend and I ate the blueberry muffins and were saving the brownies for
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well we get to <st1:place>Harpers
 Ferry</st1:place> and park the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
made sure it was locked and the windows were rolled up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had laid the brownies on the passenger side
floorboard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then we went ghost hunting
in our usual spots where strange things happen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We went to the bridge next to the railroad tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is where a lot of stuff happens like
strange sounds or civil war soldier sightings and what not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well nothing was going on that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was pretty dead (excuse the pun).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got a little angry and started to challenge
the nearby spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I challenged them to
appear or lift me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just to do
something physical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I even took off my
blessed cross I was wearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Essentially
telling them that "The gloves were off".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, nothing happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even a strange noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we walked back to the car defeated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way I remarked that, "At least
I'll be able to some of those brownies we bought, so it's not a total
loss.".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We get back to the car and
the brownies are missing, box and all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The car was locked and the windows were rolled up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We made sure there was no way to get into the
car from the outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We even checked to
see if the windows or the locks had been tampered with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We checked under the seats in the front and the backs seats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We checked everywhere inside the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We even checked the trunk for some odd
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had completely vanished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even the box or wrappers from the muffing
box were inside the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so mad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I should be careful what I wish for,
I just might get.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I insulted the
spirits in the area and they decided to get even with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in this building for many years. Three different
tenants lived in unit # 19. Often times, a cold presence is felt and an image
appears in the bathroom mirror, of someone possibly a woman, Native American
with long hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Unit # 6 , in which I lived in, on a number of occasions, I
had felt someone sit on the bed during the night. You could see a depression on
the bed where the spirit had been sitting. In addition, on numerous occasions
in all three units there were happenings of cabinets opening and drawers being
left open. This usually happened when we left the unit to take out the trash,
or change laundry. You would come back to your apartment and ALL the drawers in
the bedrooms and ALL kitchen cupboards and drawers were left open. Nothing was
ever<span style="">&nbsp; </span>disturbed or missing, just a
mischievous ghost messing around. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Although my experiences are small, they have all added up to
wonderful experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It all began when
my fiance and I moved into my grandparents old two family house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a bit hesitant at first, but after the
wall were painted and the floors recarpeted - it was easier to move in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within three months of moving in I had many
interesting moments, I would smell scents that would bring me right back to
being a toddler in that house, when I went to take a deeper inhale the scent
was gone, walking past the cellar I would smell fresh cut wood (my grandfather
was a woodworker) and every so often the air in the room would get
"heavy."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dog would often
stare off into another room, enter that room and just stand there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then one night I saw them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was <st1:time minute="15" hour="3">3:15am</st1:time> and I was awake
in bed, I looked to the foot of the bed and saw two figures standing
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not scared or shocked, I
started to laugh and smile - I just knew it was my grandparents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next day I went into the attic to "look
around" I had my grandparents in my thoughts and I asked out loud
"where is Roger?" he was my fathers brother who died a tragic death
before I was born, a voice in my head quickly answered "well...he's in the
attic."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was in the attic I
found a drawing from Roger and hung it on the wall, I'm sure he would have
liked that.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My fiance had not experienced anything directly, he would
however ask my grandfather for permission before using any tools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, one September day he was cleaning
out a cabinet in the cellar and came across a wooden perpetual calendar (the
kind where you change the wooden blocks day by day).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in his hand before he looked down at
it, October 17 it said, the date of our upcoming wedding day. I took this as
their rsvp to our wedding, and they are in a few of our wedding pictures!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now that my sister and her husband have moved upstairs the
house has been quite for a few months.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Though they do visit me in my dreams now and again, I think they are
glad to see their house being used by their only two grandchildren and their
husbands.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: celiam601@yahoo.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been wanting to spend the night at "The Myrtles
Plantation" in <st1:place><st1:City>St. Francisville</st1:City>, <st1:State>La.</st1:State></st1:place>
for years, so finally my husband decided to take me there for our anniversary
last year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed in the General
Bradford suite, the only room available for overnight stays that is
downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tour was wonderful, all
the legends of the plantation, including the one about Chloe tucking some guest
in at night were told with gusto, we were allowed to photograph the famous
mirror in the entrance hall, and the photos were wonderful, handprints appeared
in them all, also the staircase which was reflected in the mirror had some
strange thick fog appearing on each photo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only paranormal experience I had during the tour was having a gentle
breeze blowing on the back of my neck a few times (I thought it was my husband
trying to scare me, but when I turned around no one was there)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just dismissed this as a draft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once we went to bed, my husband was teasing
me, he stated "I'm not afraid of you, Chloe, bring it on."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(chloe is the slave who was hung for
poisoning the masters 2 children and his wife).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, suddenly my husband claimed he was freezing, I reached over and
believe me, he was ice cold and shivering.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was warm as toast!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few
minutes he seemed to warm up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing
else happened during the night, so about 6AM we woke up and preceeded to get
out of bed, I couldn't throw back the covers, I had to climb out from under
them, and upon inspection I realized the covers on my side of the bed were
tucked tightly under the mattress, and I can tell you with utmost confidence
they were not that way when I went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am very anxious to go back!!!!!!!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If anyone would like to see some of the photos taken at the plantation,
I will be glad to email them to you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my
email address is <a href="mailto:celiam601@yahoo.com">celiam601@yahoo.com</a>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It stared out as a
nice warm sunny day.(I was about 9 or 10) It seemed like nothing could go
wrong.... But that night when I went to bed I went to sleep with the TV and the
light off.(which is very unusual for me!) Then in the middle of the night I
woke up and my room was freezing cold! Then at the bottom of my bed I saw this
girl. She was wearing a yellow dress, and she had a cord attached to her
face,and the end of the cord was cut,and some of her hair had fallen out like
she had cancer. She was just sitting there looking at me straight in the eye
for the longest time. Then I hit myself in the head to make sure I was awake.
When I noticed that nothing had changed i threw myself from the bed to the
floor and ran to my moms room. I wanted to wake my mom up and tell her what I
saw, but I couldn't do anything. I couldn't talk,I couldn't move, I just sat in
my moms rocking chair for a long time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then my mom woke up and tried to talk to me, and right when
I told her what happened i busted into tears. For the next two weeks or so i
slept on the couch. I got over it eventually and went to sleep in my room. But
i still keep the TV on just in case.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A couple things should be mentioned before I begin my story.
First, on the front poarch, there are motion detection lights. These lights
turn on when any person/animal moves wth fifteen feet of them. Second, my
doorbell has a tendency to stick when it is pushed in and it makes an obnoxius
buzzing sound. This can only happen when someone pushes it, it then must be pushed
in again so it will stop.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'm seventeen now, but this story takes place when I was
ten. One fall night, around nine, my two uncles, my aunt, my grandma and I were
sitting in the living room watching t.v. when we heard the doorbell ring. My
uncle Jonathon gets up and looks out the peephole. He doesn't see anything and
the lights arn't on. My uncle sits down and none of us think of anything that
just happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About five minutes later we hear the doorbell ring again,
but this time it has gotten stuck. My uncle once again gets up, looks out the
peephole and, again, see nothing. He opens the, so he can push the doorbell in,
and it is then, only at that moment when the lights turn on.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Outof the five peole that were in the living rom that night,
none of us can explain what happened that night. Since the living room is five
feet away from the door and the lights sty on for five minutes, if not for
longer, there is absolutely no way a person could have rung the doorbell and
ran.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I said, this event took place when I was ten. It has been
seven years and it stil sticks with me. Nothing like this has happened again.
Every once and awhile I get a feeing of dread while i'm in the house an my
step-dad swears there's ghosts in he house, nothing has been as shocking as that
night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Happened Many Years Ago</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: C.M.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This happened many years ago. I was around the age of 20 and
was living in (what was at the time) my family's home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few bits of information first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since early childhood I have always been
scared of ghost/spirits/entities whatever you want to call them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When going to bed I always insisted on having
my bedroom door open with the hall light on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Always, prior to sleep I had a litany of prayers, e.g. "thank you
for this" and "GOD bless my family" etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last of my prayers every night was for
God to "not let anything scary happen to me, not let me see anything
scary, and to not let me think or dream of anything scary."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Back to what happened to me that night. I had my own
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was late around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> when I was finally going to bed. As
usual I kept my bedroom door open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father was still up and I remember hearing that the television was on kind of
loud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided to get up and shut my
bedroom door. (That&#8217;s where I made my mistake.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I lay back down on my bed and immediately drifted off to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed like I was dreaming as I had that
heavy half asleep half awake feeling when I started hearing a noise as though
something was being dragged slowly across the floor, back and forth, back and
forth. Then, just as quickly as I had fallen asleep, I woke up from my dreaming
state and, thinking about what I had just heard I opened my eyes. Standing to
the right of the foot of my bed was what looked like someone standing there
with a sheet or a blanket over their head. It was easy to see as my room had
outside light coming in through a sliding glass door. I immediately closed my
eyes tight and started saying prayers repeating, &#8220;Lord Jesus have mercy on me.
Lord Jesus have mercy on me&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My heart
was pounding so hard and fast. I was petrified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then after what seemed like only a couple of minutes I somehow in my
fear was able to reach over and turn on the light that was next to my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I slowly looked around and of course there
was nothing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I gathered up all
my blankets and went to my sister&#8217;s room down the hall and lay down on the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to sleep but it was
difficult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept thinking about it
again and again, did I really see that or was I still sleeping/dreaming?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But every time I recalled the sound of that
heavy type of material dragging across the floor I just knew I saw what I saw.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Dave and Tina, I 'd like to share my ghostly experience with
you. About a year ago my two cousins heard that there was a haunted road in <st1:place><st1:City>Sanger</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Calif.</st1:State></st1:place> The road was named Channel but was
given the name <st1:Street><st1:address>Snake Road</st1:address></st1:Street>
by locals because it is has many sharp twists and turns and runs alongside a
river. Legend has it that a young mother and her two daughters lost their lives
on this road when the mother failed to negotiate a turn and drove her vehicle
into the river. She was thrown from the car and died almost instantly, her two
daughters were trapped in the car , which continued to float downstream. They
both eventually drowned. Many people have reported seeing the apparition of a
woman walking along the road at night and along the riverbed. Locals believe it
is the ghost of the mother looking for her children. When my cousins told me
this story I was a little intrigued but also skeptical. After much begging and
pleading my cousins were able to convince me to drive them down the road. We
got a map of Sanger and located the whereabouts of <st1:Street><st1:address>Channel
  Road</st1:address></st1:Street>. We drove around for approximately an hour
and could not find the road, even though we followed the directions to a
"T". The area where the road supposedly is, is very dark, very
overgrown with weeds and huge bushes and trees. Also the area is not well taken
care of ( street signs missing ). Frustrated and disappointed about not finding
the road we started back home. We could not remember what streets we had taken
to get where we were so we just started taking any roads that went south ( we
knew one of these roads would get us to the main road ). We turned onto this
one road ( we could not see the name of it because as I had said earlier the
area was very poorly maintained and bushes were covering the name ) but hey it
was going south.We were on the road for approximately 2 minutes when my 12 yr.
old cousin started freaking out in the back seat, she started crying, saying
she was scared and wanted to go home. I assured her that was what we were doing
but no amount of reassurance could calm her down. I continued down the road as
fast as I could. I began slowing down when I noticed a thin patch of fog, I say
fog , my friend swears it was an apparition about 50 feet in front of me. As we
came upon this apparition it slowly began to disappear. At that point I had
almost come to a complete stop. As I passed the area where we saw the fog, okay
apparition, I began to accelerate . Just then I saw a sign about ten feet ahead
that said "Caution, Dangerous curves up ahead ". I slowed down and in
the back of my mind I'm thinking " could this be the road ". I
assumed it wasn't because up until that point the road had been fairly straight
and easy to maneuver. But the sign didn't lie, the road suddenly became very
windy, to the point where I would drive a few yards, have to make a sharp turn
to the right, drive a few more yards and suddenly have to make a sharp turn to
the left. This went on for about three miles then the road straightened out. Up
ahead I saw flashing red lights. As I drew closer I saw that it was a stop
sign. As I was approaching I told my friend to see what street we were on so I could
maybe get an idea of where we were. I'll never forget the look on my friends
face as I pulled up to the stop sign. She looked as if she'd seen a ghost. She
said, you guessed it, we were on <st1:Street><st1:address>Channel Road</st1:address></st1:Street>.
As soon as we turned off the street, my cousin who had been nearly hysterical
from the moment we turned onto it, had calmed down just as quickly. I now do
believe that the apparition we saw was of the young mother. I do not think she
was trying to scare us but quite the contrary, she probably saved our lives.
Because had I not slowed down when she appeared, I'd have suddenly come upon
the dangerous curves. And going at the speed I was up until that moment I
surely would have not been able to maneuver them, and possibly suffering the
same fate as the young mother and her daughters. Also this happened in the
middle of summer, where fog , even a small patch , is unlikely, where the temp.
is usually in the 100's. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">P.S. This past January my grandparents were looking into
buying another home. They showed me and my cousins the pictures of the two
homes they had narrowed it down to. One of them was on <st1:Street><st1:address>Channel
  Road</st1:address></st1:Street> and in the picture provided to them by the
realtor, a side view of the riverfront property, you can see a sign about five
yards away that says " Caution, Dangerous curves ahead ", we advised
them that if they bought the property we would NEVER, EVER visit them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I pride myself on being an open minded person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't have a particualar faith and will
listen to other's views.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I
sense a presence around me, and often I'll have the classic, "see
something out of the corner of your eye, turn and nothing's there" happen,
and I generally believe in the paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My story doesn't compare in the terror department like some others, but
it does occasionally give me a dark feeling in the pit of my stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It started when we first moved into out house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in second grade, so about 7 years
old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a memory of seeing blood in
the bathtub and sink in my bathroom, however as I told this story later
everyone insisted I made it up, so I dismissed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then as the years progressed I would hear a
woman's voice every single night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
sounded like an older woman, and not a happy one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hear a low moaning, and every single
time I would check on my mother because I thought it was her- it never was and
of course I was the only one who could hear it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It eventually stopped, until a few months ago I heard it again for a
short period of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These have all
been relatively dismissive and I'm fine with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However one night I got a full on, face to
face, body in body experience from something that sure wasn't alive, and sure
wasn't something a kid's imagination made up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was falling asleep, and for some reason I felt something
say, "open your mind."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then bam!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my mind I'm jogging down this hallway,
make a few turns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then suddenly, I get
to a doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's dark, and there's a
man inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to turn around and
run but it was too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next thing
I know I'm in my bed again, but I can't move.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(This part I was awake)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
floating up, did a full rotation, still couldn't move, couldn't speak,
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I descended down onto my
matress, and within about 5 seconds I felt a huge weight rise off of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so relieved, and began to breathe
normally again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then in front of my eyes
flashes a man's face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw a lot of red
and he was yelling something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The face
flashed twice and then was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried
to pass it off as a dream, but I've had plenty of weird ones and nothing
compares to this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the night
I watched TV with an unusual amount of concentration.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Nothing has happened since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But hey, you never know.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted Farm House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My uncle who is in the miliatary at the time bought a farm
house in Braxton County West Virginia. About 3 months after he bought it My
sisters, mom, and dad. Went out there and decided to stay for a week. the first
day there I woke up just at daylight and saw a white s-10 truck sitting in the
feild below the house the person sitting in it had a rifile poked out the
window of the house. It scared me so I walked out on the porch when I did the
truck pulled into the creek and vanished. Then about 2 months later no one had
been to the farm in a while. The farm got broken into almost everthing had been
stolen. And my uncle is a very wealthy person. His great great granfathers
world War 2 flag was even stolen. Eversince the break in i'm afraid to stay up
there and when I do (the house is 2 stories w/basement and attic) I hear noises
like chains dragging the steps and someone crawling in the attic. This isn't
all one day I decided to take a walk in the woods with my sisters. We came to a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>very old graveyard that you could tell no one
had been to in many years. The strangest tomb was one that was about 7 foot
tall and 4 foot wide. There was a very old rusty chair sitting right beside it.
There was the same old man that was sitting in the S-10 parked in the feild. He
looked so old that I don't know how he could even walk. So me and my two
sisters ran all the way back to the farm. (By the way i'm 13 and my parents
wern't at the farm they were at the store 10 miles away.) There the same old
man was sitting in the swing on the back porch. So my sisters and I ran into
the house and locked all the doors and windows. And that night the noises and
sounds got so bad we left. The farm has now got burned down. But sometimes my
dad and my mom and us kids all go up there to hunt and still sometimes I see
that old man sitting in that same seat with that same rifile. Thank you for
your intresest!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My sister just recently had an experience a few days after
our grandfather passed away. She was walking down the hallway to go to her room
and the door to my grandfathers old room was slightly open, She looked to the
side noticing the door was ajar and seen a outline of a long manly arm reaching
out. She looked forward and continued walking. Our grandma was resting in her
room so she told her crying. Later that night she was trying to go to sleep,
she turned to face the wall and something started tugging on her hair
violently,but nothing was there. Once again she started screaming .It's little
things like this that happen ever now and then</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My events were not as scary as some others, but they were
quite spooky at the time. We hat to have my cat Tuppy put down when i was about
12. She was 16 yrs old and quite grumpy, and not very affectionate. I was one
of the few people she really liked. Anyway, a couple of times, once at my
grandparents house which we stayed in while our new house was being built, i
was lying in bed and felt a cat walking over me. There were no animals at my
grandparents. I knew It was Tuppy beacuse it was heavy (she was a very big
cat). It padded all<span style="">&nbsp; </span>over me and i think
may have layed down. I was so scared, even though, if it was my cat, she was
friendly. I felt her again in our new house. We had 2 new cats by then, but I
had my bedroom door shut and they were not in my room. Again, it was heavy and
padded me out before lying down.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The other vent which happeded was at the housewarming we
threw. No one can recall the TV being on, but when we had the photos from that
night developed, there is a picture of my parents cutting their hosewarming
cake. In the background, the TV has the words - like the title of a TV show -
"The House of the Dead"! Like I said, none remebers the TV being on,
andI doubt it would have been in the middle<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>of a party. This was a brand new house in a relativly new subdivision.
Since then, both Mums parents have died and my Dad's adopted Aunt. None<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of them died in the house, but they all spent
a lot of time there and my Great Aunt was at our house with Pnemonia when she
got sick enough to go to the emergency doctors b4 going to the ICU.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">i lived for 3 years on <st1:Street><st1:address>east Scott
  Street</st1:address></st1:Street> in <st1:City><st1:place>Gainesville</st1:place></st1:City>.
i bought the house in 1981 because i wanted an old two story house to remodel.
down stairs was 6 rooms and a large entry. up stairs was 6 bedroom and a
bathroom with a stairway leading to the attic which was large enough for a
third floor. the house was made into apartments during the war to house army
families. i believe the house was built in 1899 by a banker the house across
the street was built by a bar owner around that time. our house was once owned
by the superintendent of <st1:City><st1:place>Gainesville</st1:place></st1:City>
schools and that is who i believe one of our ghost was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when we first moved in the very first night
my 15 year old daughters bed started shaking when we went to check this out a
mirror fell off the wall with the wire intact and the nail hanger still secure
in the wall. every night about <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1 am</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>our cocker spaniel Maundy sue would go out in
to the foyer from our bedroom and start barking, until she died a year later at
the age of 3 . a fan flew out of the window in my bedroom which was at the head
of the stairs and a ash tray shattered in to a hundred pieces sitting on my
night stand. our son would no sleep in his room for he was to scared and slept
with his sister. my great aunt came too visit and tripped on the stairs but
there was nothing to trip on. up until before i moved i really wasn't scared,
then one night i came home from work, went upstairs to my room to change and
the hair stood up on the back of my neck. i could feel something watching me
and i called out to the children but no one answered me. i walked out into the
foyer and the door knob on the twins room was turning and the door opened i
called out no one answered. i ran down the stairs not even remembering if my
feet touched the floor and all the children and my husband were watching TV and
didn't hear me call out. i then decided to sell the house for my nerves were
shot. i had called Mr. Charlmers daughter when i researched the house and she
told me her father had loved the house but she wouldn't even come up on the
porch when she came to give me a picture of what it use to look like. it has
had several owners since i moved, and i did go back to see the house which they
had removed all the fire places and made it more modern. last time i was there
it was for sale again. the kids are all grown now but still talk about it. the
house across the street was also haunted my daughter use to go over to feed the
cats for the owner when they were gone. one time when she and her friend were
over there they went upstairs and the doors were opening and closing bye them
self's my daughter never went back not even when the owners came home. i don't
remember my address but the house is on east Scott on the west side right
across the street of the Jr. high school. it is a two story with a large attic
and a balcony and a wrap around front porch with a tall black iron fence. the
house across the street is a two story brick.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>thank you for reading my story iam sure their are more as <st1:City><st1:place>Gainesville</st1:place></st1:City>
is an old town with a lot of old homes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, this is my third story that I have submitted to the
Shadowlands. The first two were my experiences but this actually is my best
friend, Jennie's story. She just recently moved to her new house in a modern
neighborhood in Apex, NC. She and her Mom and sister all have different rooms,
and she has the haunted room. Every morning at about <st1:time minute="1" hour="12">12:01</st1:time> she awakes to strange noises and the light flashing
on and off. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now I have seen this closet and I have spent nights over at
her house, heard and seen this. But even when both of our supernatural minds
are put together we can't find any explanation, logical or not to explain this.
The history of the house doesn't explain anything either.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: XvLilithHartvX@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Here is a story that happened to me in 1999 while I was
visiting a farm in <st1:place><st1:City>Arad</st1:City>, <st1:country-region>Romania</st1:country-region></st1:place>..</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the property, there is a large castle that dates back a
few centuries, as well as farm lands that were developed after the home wa
built. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">According to the current owner of the house, a man and wife
built the castle before the Communist regime came into <st1:country-region><st1:place>Romania</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The wife found out her husband was having an affair with her
own sister and consequently hung herself in an upstairs bathroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She was buried near the back of the property in a marked
grave, that was later desecrated by Communists that used the castle as a
meeting place/headquarters.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">You can see this grave if you walk an overgrown trail. There
is a large monument and a large, gaping hole in the grave itself.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Her grave was robbed and the marker was used for weapons
shooting practice during the Communist era.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">During our stay on the farm in summer 1999, we felt
virtually nothing while sleeping in the castle, albeit we did hear some creaks
from the upstairs rooms, despite the floors being unsafe for visitors, my
friend and I did venture out to the bath house, which sits opposite the castle
on the property. It is an isolated building with few windows, poor lighting and
five or six bathtubs that fill up with mineral water from a nearby well/spring.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The light switch is on the other side of the room and as we
crossed in darkness to flip it, we both felt very uncomfortable and wary.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It's a place that leaves you with a feeling of uneasiness
and the feeling of being watched.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At one point, while the tubs were filling, I had forgotten
my towel back in our room in the castle and decided to jog back and get it.
This was around 11-12 at night. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I was heading back, i got a very bad feeling and, for
reasons unknown to me, bolted back to the bath house as quickly as I could.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I arrived and burst through the door, the room was
freezing cold. As soon as I stepped in, it warmed again and the lights became
brighter.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friend was huddled in a corner, with her knees drawn up
to her chest, breathing heavily, very pale and quite frightened. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She told me as soon as I had left and the door had shut
behind me, the room had become extremely cold, the lights had flickered and
dimmed and she had seen the shadow on the wall of a woman walking through the
room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She had severe goosebumps when I found her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Crazy, huh?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The woman that lives there now is an ordained minister and
when we told her the story, insisted on doing an exorcism in the castle the
next morning. We didn't hear or feel much after that, but I still got the
impression that it hadn't cleansed the area.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is not my personal experience, this was told to me by
my mother. I've never seen a ghost or had any experiences so I was not much of
a believer in the supernatural, that was until my mother told me what my elder
sister had seen. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mother is from <st1:place><st1:City>Cape Town</st1:City>,
 <st1:country-region>South Africa</st1:country-region></st1:place> and my dad
is from a small town called <st1:place>Dundee</st1:place>, when my parents
married they moved to my fathers home town. My grandmother, my mothers mother
use to come down from <st1:City><st1:place>Cape Town</st1:place></st1:City> to <st1:place>Dundee</st1:place>
to visit us, she use to travel by train it was a 3 day journey. She use travel
alone because my grandfather passed away when my mother was 18 years old so
none of us had the pleasure of meeting my grandfather.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my sister was about 5 years old my grandmother took her
to <st1:City><st1:place>Cape Town</st1:place></st1:City> this was my sisters
first visit to <st1:City><st1:place>Cape Town</st1:place></st1:City>, I was not
even born at this time. They traveled by train.Since it's a long journey to
Cape Town you travel in a compartment which fits 6 people but my grandmother
and sister traveled alone in a compartment.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There is a portrait of my grandfather in the living room at
my grandmothers house, it hangs directly opposite the door as you enter the
house and it is the first thing you see when you enter.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So when my sister stepped into my grandmothers house for the
first time, the first thing she saw was the picture of my grandfather. When she
saw the picture she pointed towards it and said, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"Grandma, that man in the picture he was with us on the
train the whole time."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since my sister was only 5 at the time she probably could
see my grandfather since children can normally see ghosts, she never saw my
grandfather before and did not recognize him when she saw him in the train with
them. I think my grandfather was watching over my grandmother like a guardian
angel and that's why my sister was not afraid or did not feel threatened by
him, because he was watching over them. This is a true storie and it sure made
me a believer.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have been an avid reader of your site for as long as I can

believer in ghosts since child hood, although I had never seen or experienced
anything particularly "ghostly" until about a year ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was living with my boyfriend at the time
and we had a HUGE blow out argument in the wee hours of the morning (around 3
if my memory serves).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so angry my
teeth were chattering and I had the jitters, so I decided to leash up my dog
and go out on a run and burn off some of the steam.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After running for about 3 miles, I was totally exhausted but
still didn't feel much better, so I decided to take a nice walk for the rest of

passing at that hour wasn't a big deal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>howevre, as I was coming up the hill to cross the road and get home, a
nice looking 60's<span style="">&nbsp; </span>model Mustang pulled
up next to me, and then turned left and parked right in the middle of the
road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's a small town and I really
didn't find it odd that the car had stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A young guy, I'd say around 21, stepped out and said "You have a
beautiful dog." We had a small conversation and he told me he was a
pre-vet major. Soon a campus patrol car pulled up and the officer asked
"Is everything alright?" I said yes and he gave me a strange look (I
thought it was because we were in the middle of the street at 33o or 4 in the
morning) and drove off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right after, the
young man said bye and drove off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
Kicked myself for not getting his name because he seemed so nice, I would have
liked to talk to hi again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hit me: His car never made a noise (the way
older cars rumble and such) and the police officer directed his questions at
me, not the guy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
the officer didn't even aknowledge the guy being there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This story is made stranger by the fact that
I've never since seen the man or his car on campus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's a small campus and if you have an
unusual car... you're bound to be noticed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know what to make of this strange event, but I
haven't forgotten the sweet guy, the silent car, or the strange look on the
cop's face.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I would first like to say I really love your website.My
experience happened in a small town in Alabama.I was a young mother of 17 and
woke up at about 2:30 in the morning.My baby was crying and I got up ,layed him
on the couch and was warming up his bottle.As I was standing at the stove I
heard the most terrifing sound I had ever heard.It was like a growl and a roar
together.Like in the movie the exorcist.It was so loud I felt it,like loud
music.I felt very weak and almost passed out.You know how when you hear a
strange noise and you think "what was that?"?I immediately thought
the devil.I was so freaked out I left the baby on the couch and ran to the
bedroom and woke up my husband.He was very angry as he had to get up in a few
hours and go to work.He said it was the pulp mill down the road.He didn't
believe me.So I got the baby and went back to bed while he searched the house
to calm me down.He ran into the bedroom and his legs gave out from underneath
him.He said "I heard it too,we have to get out of here".We ran out of
the house and almost wreaked getting out of the driveway,saying the Lords
prayer over and over.I got all my family and friends to help us pack up the
next day and got the hell out of there.(rental)The pastor of my mother-in-laws
church said he got really bad vibes when he went by that house.Never went back
needless to say.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: Anonymous</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to write about a true experience I've had.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I would appreciate it if my details are unknown.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Living in <st1:country-region><st1:place>New Zealand</st1:place></st1:country-region>
all my life when I was younger I believe I've had an encounter with a
supernatural presence which is true percieving on the fact I had seen certain
descriptions which were unexplainable. My house is located not too distantly
away from one of the highschools in the southern area. Amongst my peers at a
certain age we were at the highschool making use of the basketball court. When
my friends had decided it was time to leave we all made our way indivually to
where we lived. I was walking alongside with a friend and then we seperately
took our own routes to get to where our houses were. I sidetracked into a left
junction at this street where it went downhill and then sloped upwards to get
to where I was heading towards. The time would have set into range of the
afternoon interacting with night estimately I would recall the logic time being
of <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5 - 6 pm</st1:time>. The atmosphere was on
the basis of getting persistently dark, practically it was setting into
nightfall and I noticed all the street lights were off. Reaching the centre of
the street and being located on the left side of the road I focussed my view
over towards the right where the surroundings were of this certain land. Prohibition
signs were placed and the area was set with tall grass like landshape covered
by big structured trees with a noticeable creek as a dividend in the landscape.
The same surroundings now have a children's playground built if mentioned at
this present time. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">With my focus on the landscape's surroundings towards the
right at the certain time of nightfall, my eyes made out a presence of a woman
standing further back in the landscape. Her description were of black dressing
I would recall in consideration to the type of a nun's, where the head is
covered by a shawl or hooded type feature though it was all black throughout
consisting into a long type of dress. The facial features were uncertain, at
the time I would probably have been verifying white like stranded hair showing
under her shawl though it was kind of unclear in views of actual facial
presence. Not knowing what a lady was doing around that area at this certain
time of night I called out to her most probably through paranoia on being
judgemental whether my mind was playing ticks on me or not. The lady seemed to
make her way to me from further back to where she was first situated. Then with
more concentration on her overall feauture I noticed the lower portion of her
body wasn't there. I had just practically called out to a lady I could see
gliding over the glass like surface with no legs. Knowing this was no human
type form I kept god in my mind and made my way away from the situated place
this encounter was happening upwards to where there were other people to my
relief with the first light I saw in the street being of some person's
ciggarette which they were holding. I made my way to where I lived and at times
would have certain paranoid thoughts interfering my conscience as to whether
that presence was on my back situated there when I wasn't in full control to
see if anyone was standing there if I turned around. Eventually through time
that type of thinking managed to clear itself though the memory remains. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks for letting me mention this experience.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Haunted Flat</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">this story is about the flat that my parents used to live in
many years ago it was in croxteth in liverpool. many starange things used to
happen there and my mum always used to have a feel about the place as though
something wasnt right. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">odd things used to happen like they could never hang a
picture or mirror on the walls cause as soon as they did the picture or mirrir
would just fall straight off. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">another time was that my mum was in bed once and my dad was
out and she was lying there and the door (which had been firmly closed) opened.
my mum thinking it was my dad coming in said hello, nut there was no one there
and then it closed tightly with a click. it then opened again and then closed
with a click. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">little things like this led my mum to believe that the flat
was haunted but her nor my dad ever saw a ghost or apparition. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the most scary and weird of all the incidents was: one
morning my mum and dad went to the kitchen of the flat and there sitting on the
kitchen table was a large black crow. there was absolutely no way that it could
have got in as the kistchen door was locked, the windows were locked and there
was no evidence that it had come down the chimney eg. soot. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i believe that my mum has a sixth sense for this sort of
thing as one time when she and my dad were house-hunting they came across a
house which my mum and a very strange feel about she stepped in the house nut
immeadiatley had to come go back out as she had a very strange feeling about the
place. my dad didnt sense anything. they didnt move there they moved to our
current house which so far (touch wood) has remained ghost free. i swear this
story is 100% true and all these events did take place.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was a foggy friday night at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12ish</st1:time>. We were right off of shoe factory road in <st1:place>Hoffman
 Estates</st1:place> and we were at a stop sign. There was a little
intersection but the next day we learned that there is no street there with a
stop sign. There was a gray old looking jeep sititng there with no lights on
and it was not on and someone was sitting in it. At first we thought that it
was a weird person. We were sitting there for while just looking at it and than
we finally made our turn. As we were making the turn one of us was looking at
the car and it just disapeared. The person in the car was all white and had
white hair all over the place. Once we discovered that it just disapeared we
flew down the road. And where the ghost was they are currently begining to
build new houses around there. (maybe the ghost doesn't want them to build them
there?)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Other Stories</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've always been fascinated by people who have managed never
to experience ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know that the
area around <st1:place><st1:City>Washington</st1:City>, <st1:State>DC</st1:State></st1:place>,
especially to the west, is the location of many Civil War deaths, and before
that, countless native American deaths.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've lived in two houses where I felt hostility from the ghost, although
nothing aggressive happened -- in one house, all of us were uncomfortable; the
other, for a long time, I was the only person who was aware of the ghost, and
after the other residents realized the house was haunted, it seemed that I was
the only person who felt uncomfortable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the most part, I've been comfortable with my various ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My present house has a very playful ghost,
and I enjoy his company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have to move
in the next year or two, and I'd really like it if he'd move with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess that's up to him, and time will
tell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The number of men who died around
here during the Civil War must have been a nightmare.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There is a privately owned, quite expensively restored
free-standing townhouse in Old Towne Alexandria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no house attached on either side, and
is apparently quite large for the area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The couple who own it are married -- he's on his second family and has
grown children from his first marriage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The house was built by a free black architect and occupied by the man
and his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently the current
residents are so used to the ghosts they forgot to tell the children from the
current owner's first family about them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One son was staying for an extended visit and came down to breakfast one
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wanted to know who the black
family in the room upstairs was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Was" was the appropriate word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They'd all been dead for several hundred
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other than occasional
appearances, I never heard of any other behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They seemed to be happy to have the house
restored to its original beauty.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my sister and I were little, she was capable of
poltergeist-like activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We're less
than a year apart, and I remember one display she did for me -- I must have
been about 10 months old, if that much.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I'm one of those people who remember some events that happened before
my first birthday, but they're random.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We lived in a tiny row-house in DC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The house was about 15 feet wide; the living room narrower because the
stairs took up 30-36".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a
knick-knack shelf that I remember looking almost like a mantle hanging on the
side of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shelf had a
pink, art deco-ish shell vase on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
sister, who still has a tendency to be manic, said "watch this," and
pointed at the vase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It popped up in the
air and landed on the floor, breaking into three or four pieces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was impressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She never did the kind of stuff you see on
TV, just weird little stunts like million other kids, until they found out it
wasn't possible to move things with their minds.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Keep up the good work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The listings of hauntings are fun to read.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My current haunted house is in a development near
Dranesville and <st1:place><st1:City>Sterling</st1:City>, <st1:State>Virginia</st1:State></st1:place>,
around Sugarland Run, which empties into the <st1:place>Potomac River</st1:place>
not far down the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The development
is called Cascades/Lowes Island.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Lowes</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> is the expensive part, east
of Sugarland Run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The price of a
townhouse in Cascades, the less expensive part of the development, is liable to
give folks a heart attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I sell
my townhouse, I should have a good safety net for my retirement, but I feel bad
for folks trying to buy inexpensive houses in safe neighborhoods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, being <st1:State><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>,
it's legal to own guns, so we don't have a lot of break-ins.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a lot of Civil War activity around
here, and most honest folks admit their houses are haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We're in a relatively new development,
started about 15 years ago and finally almost finished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've not heard of any hostile ghosts, but
I've heard of lots of ghosts in lots of houses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They seem to be comfortable with what the builders did, so they just go
on about their business and play games from time to time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mine seems to enjoy my motion-sensor light
switches.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Up the hill from "old town" (you take a curvy road
that's perpendicular to the old "market" part of town), there's a
"castle" on a large piece of land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A friend of mine owned the house some years ago; I think it sat on a
ten-acre lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inside (the last time
I was inside) was interesting, to say the least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There had apparently been a fire, and the
repairs were bizarre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a flight
of stairs that went up, and stopped, going nowhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Across the room below, they continued.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In one bedroom, used as a guest room, if you
tried to sleep in that room you could hear a baby cry all night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I never tried that and we knew nothing about
the baby, but suspected the baby was killed in the fire.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in the yard one summer, and near the
house there was a three-story stable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You could enter it on the same level as the house or on the lowest
level; I expect that the middle level was used to store hay for the
horses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house's owner and I went in
the top level with a visitor who "didn't believe in ghosts."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the center of the top floor, there was a
definite cold spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr "didn't
believe in ghosts" was suddenly covered in goose bumps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner and I had found a "new"
ghost, so we went around to the lowest level, and the cold spot was directly
below the cold spot on the third level.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We had no information on the stable ghost, but he was definitely
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no hostility that we
could feel.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was a third ghost, who was the most active.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was (is?) a treat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house's outside walls are solid, thick
stone, and even the strange fire repairs are sturdy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One New Year's Eve, a chandelier is one of the
countless parlors fell on a room full of people, but hit no one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It livened up the party a bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dining room is splendid, with a dining
table that must have been built in the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The table easily seats 30 people, and has a chandelier above it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The maid who worked at, but would not stay
in, the house would get up on the table and grab the chandelier to stop it from
swinging.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She'd get back on the floor,
and the chandelier would swing again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The story is that the active ghost lived in the house and one of her
children married, and the young couple, not wanting to wait to inherit the
house, locked the older woman in one of the attics, where she went
"mad" and died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently,
she's unsure about the dead part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was a night when I was at a small party there, and we were in a large parlor
that had classic, dark green velvet "Gone With The Wind"
draperies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a bit strange as we'd
decided to play charades, men vs. women.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the women looked at the curtains at the far end of the room at the
same time (there was no sound) and saw one of these heavy draperies with lead
in the hem (this is done in many custom-made draperies, even today) lift as if
someone wanted to peek outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of
the men saw it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At another party, in the
dining room, there was a dumbwaiter to the basement, where the kitchen had been
at one time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw the old woman at the
door of the dumbwaiter, turned to tell someone, and she was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I was quite sober.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one else ever admitted to seeing the old
woman, although a couple of people said they'd heard her speak, which I never
did.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The old woman's favorite games were in the
"tower."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one side of the
house, there was a three- or four-story square tower with windows on the three
exposed sides (the fourth side abutted the house, but only opened into the main
house on the ground floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a
challenge to keep the windows closed as the old woman apparently preferred them
open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend, who owned the house,
had her son (an adolescent), her husband, and the long-suffering maid stand
outside at the bottom of the tower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
started on the top floor of the tower and tied each of the three windows (one
of each side) closed with cord, then went down one floor and repeated the process
until she got to ground level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went
outside where her witnesses were, and all the windows were open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The witnesses only saw that the windows
opened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend went back inside, and
in the center of each floor of the tower, she found a small pile of cord from
the three windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was finally able
to find some latches that either pleased or stumped the senior ghost.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Several years later, the ceiling of the tower developed a
leak, so the electricity to the tower was disconnected until repairs could be
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at one of the parties, and
I offered to take anyone who was interested upstairs in the tower (with the
hostess's blessing).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a cigarette
lighter, not a flashlight, and on the way to the top floor, the flame grew to a
foot high and would not go out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked
the ghost to cut it out, and the flame went out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I relit the lighter, and finished the tour,
although I'd lost several folks who decided they weren't up for a REAL
ghost!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew the ghost was just
playing, but some folks were apparently frightened enough to give up on the
tour.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The basement was a rough, old-fashioned dirt cellar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had boarded up tunnels that had been part
of the Underground Railroad in the days when the Underground Railroad saved
many lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the tunnels were very
old, and there had been development and over a century of weather and wear and
tear, a previous owner had felt they were unsafe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several years after my friend sold her house,
I met a man who was familiar with the house and the fact that it was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had maps of where the Underground Railroad
tunnels went.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">No one was every hurt by the ghosts, although many people
were frightened, which was unnecessary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night, three men had escaped from the state penitentiary, and had
been traced to the area around this house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Given that my friend's son was away at school, and she and her husband
had divorced, she called the State Police to find out if she should worry about
the escaped convicts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State Police
declined to enter the house -- they knew its history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They advised her to get a 12-gauge, cause
they weren't going to be looking in the basement and attics of that house under
any circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she got a
12-gauge, which won't hurt ghosts, and remained there several more years.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I just want to share my own experience...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It happened in our house.. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When were finish eating our supper, my mom and dad go out
and have a chat. I was the only one left in the house and my brother who is
inside his room. While I'm cleaning the table I started to be curious on what
is in the living room and too bad that you can see the living room from the
dining. And then when Iooked at the living room i saw a tall man, dress in
white barong and black pants walking. And I stared at it for 2 to 3 seconds and
then it was gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second time I experienced it is when I'm fixing the
clothes then I got shocked that somebody is running in the stairs but nobody is
there and it seems like that the ghost is mad.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It happened in our school..</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At first I don't believe my classmates that there is
something special in our "comfort room" at the 8th floor of our
school. I experienced it when I'm going to change my PE uniform to school
uniform. At first there were three of us in the comfort room then afterwards my
classmates are already finished changing their clothes and faces. They already
left and I'm alone in the comfort room in the last cubicle the largest one,
while i'm dressing up my uniform I got curious because there is something
ticking then i looked for it and I got shocked when I see that the light is
moving against the wall. I got scared that time so I run away.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then I go back to the comfort room with my friends because I
want to try if the light is east to move and to my surprise it is very hard to
move you need a lot of streght to move it against the wall. After I experienced
that I never go to that comfort room alone</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It happened just the other night.I was lying awake and
watching tv on one of my couches and my older cousin was asleep on the other.
Suddenly I began to feel very hot. Then I began to hear footsteps coming down
the stairs. Thinking it was my father who would surely be angry that I was
still up watching tv, I began to pretend I was asleep.Next the sound of
footsteps went into my older sister, Liz's room. So now thinking it was nothing
I began to watch the tv again. Then I started to hear what sounded like a
doorknob turning from that direction so I began to fake sleep again.When the
sound stopped I decided to start watching tv again. But after a minute or two
of watching tv I saw that the light I had turned off just before bed was on
again. I then decided to fake sleep again just in case. So while I faked sleep
the sound a footsteps reatreated once more up the stairway.So when the sound of
footsteps stopped upstairs I began to watch tv again. Then during my veiwing of
the tv the sound returned. I was now tired of faking and wanted to see who this
person was. As I looked over toward the stairs I saw a very tall and mysterious
white glowing figure at the bottom. The figure was definatly not someone I
knew. It was tall muscular and frizzy looking. It then walked toward my
fishbowl and started to stare within it. Suddenly the "thing' disapeared
behind the fireplace. Now thinking the whole ordeal was nothing and still being
very hot I got off my couch and went to sit in my green recliner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After sitting down I put the footrest up,
took off my shirt and put a thin blakent over myself. Now I was finally able to
relax and watch tv again. But sadly I dont think my new "friend"
wanted me to do so. It began to walk through the living room and went into my
and mylittle brother's room. I s now terrified. So rememberinh something I
heard Peter on "Family Guy" say: "I chose not to believe
it" I began to say the sentace over and over again I began to watch tv
again and sat up the rest of the night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Grandfather and Dad</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Back in March, I went on an investigation with a group that
I'm in. The medium that heads the group kept telling me all weekend that I had
a very nice gentleman with me. Turns out, she got the feeling that it was a
grandfather. She described him to me and I later asked my aunt and my Mom about
him. They both said that it sounded like their grandfather, whom died when my
Mom was little. She was his favorite. Fast forward to the next weekend-I got
the call that my Dad was dying in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.
My family packed up all our stuff and headed out. We weren't but a few miles
from our house when I started to get a tingling on my right shoulder(the right
side is the maternal side). Just when I started noticing it, the cd in the
player skipped. That wouldn't be weird if it wasn't for the fact that nothing
was wrong with it the night before or during that day. I looked at the stereo.
I put my hand on my shoulder and asked if it was my grandpa to give me a sign.
The cd skipped again. I looked at my husband and started to explain to him
about what I had just thought. At the end of it, the cd skipped again and then
shut off, going to just the stereo on a station that isn't even set yet, got
nothing but static. We looked at each other again. We came around a curve,
quite fast, and there was a hearse and a funeral procession. I told my husband
to slow down. I got the feeling very strong that he needed to slow down, that
everything was going to be okay.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We made the trek from TN to OH. About an hour from my Dad's
house we stopped at my aunts to drop off my kids(Mom said she didn't think that
they needed to see him going). We weren't there three minutes when we got the
call that he had passed. I fully believe that he waited until we had stopped so
we weren't on the interstate when we got the call. So of course, I broke down,
told the kids, and left, heading to their house. After a few minutes, I kind
of, as my husband says, went behind my brick wall, and just stared out the
window. I got the strong tingling on my shoulder again, and also one on my
shoulder blades. That tingling on my shoulder blades stayed even after we got
there. It didn't leave until about 45 minutes after they had come and got Dad's
body, which was an hour after I got there. A couple of nights later, as I was
going to sleep, I heard him saying my name. Before he died, Dad slept upright
in a chair in the living room and Mom slept in their bed. They had a baby
mnonitor so if he needed Mom, he could call for her on it. During that week,
and evidently afterwards, she would hear him calling for her on it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I believe it is my Dad when I get that tingling on my
shoulder blades, just because it is usually when I am thinking about him very
strongly. Like he's telling me he's okay, and I'm going to be okay.Kind of a
comforting. It's not there all the time, just every once in awhile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My First and Last Visit with Grandpa</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: mattg8370@earthlink.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to preface this story by saying that most of
the information within is according to my mother because most of the events
that took place i only have a vague recollection.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When i was between four and five years old my mother and i
lived alone in a 2 story house in <st1:place><st1:City>Tomball</st1:City>, <st1:State>TX</st1:State></st1:place>.
It was a very rural area and so we had few visitors if any. One morning while
my mother was cooking breakfast and i was sitting at the table chattering, i
confided in her that i had a visitor the previous night. My mother of coarse
was concerned for reasons listed above and prodded me for further information.
I told her that during the night my grandfather had visited me and among other
things told me that he was going to give me a horn. My mother asked if i had
meant my father's father since he was the only one that was living at the time
and i told her no that the person i was speaking of was her father. She
insisted that i was wrong and she had every reason to do so since her father
died a year before i was born. I of coarse being a headstrong child not to
mention outgoing, of coarse insisted that she was the one that was incorrect.
We went back and forth until we both got slightly heated and my mother being
the adult, decided that it was best to let the subject drop.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Fast forward 4 years. when i was eight years old my mother
and i moved back to her place of upbringing and while our new house was being
built we stayed with her mother, my grandmother. During this time she came to
me and presented me with a fox horn made of a rams horn and told me that it was
left to me by my grandfather (he was an avid fox hunter). She also added that
he left one to all of the male grandchildren and that i was the last to recieve
mine. This of coarse brought back the memory of that long ago morning of my
youth, and spooked my mother a bit since she had assumed that my little story
back then must have been a dream.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know whether or not i really visited with my
grandfather that night, and if i did i am even more unsure if i was speaking to
an angel, an apparition, or the over active imagination of a child. What i do
know is that i had no knowledge of my inheritance, and although my memory of
early events is fuzzy my mother has never lied to me that i know of, and it
would be very strange to think that one of the few lies she has told me was
about this. I also have faith that this event really happened, and it has been
a great comfort over the years (especially during the rough times), to think that
my grandpa is watching over me somewhere in the hereafter.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks for taking the time to read this story. My
experiences have served to make me a believer in the supernatural, and i can
only hope that it might help others in deciding whether or not their
experiences are real.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lady in Red</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Buzznutx@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'd like to share my experience of seeing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a lady in a Red Dress at Cranbrook
Educational Community. Located in <st1:place><st1:City>Bloomfield Hills</st1:City>,<st1:State>Mich.</st1:State></st1:place>
I am currently an Employee on Campus at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Brookside</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Elementary School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. Oct. of last
year (2004), I became aware of a glimps of something or somone in a red dress
at the door of Brookside House which is located next to the Elementary school.
All<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Employees park in the circle drive
which faces the Brookside House. I caught many glimpses of this person dressed
in red, never saying anything to the other fellow employees. Now mind you, we
arrive at work<span style="">&nbsp; </span>anywhere between <st1:time minute="40" hour="5">5:40 a.m.</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6:00
 a.m.</st1:time> which is our starting time. This went on for a few weeks, on
and off in the mornings untill I saw this person in a red dress walk past the
window where I was standing.This is my work station every day. Facing the
windows and the road out front.Never seeing her face I finally asked my Boss,
who do I talk to about the history of <st1:City><st1:place>Cranbrook</st1:place></st1:City>.
And she<span style="">&nbsp; </span>directed me to Archives.She then
ashed me why?! I said, who's the lady in the red dress? And the look on her
face scared me more than me thinking I saw something. She told me thatshe don't
ask and she's never seen her, but I am the only one who has told her the color
of her dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seem that another
Employee saw this lady in a dress but when I talked to her she couldn't tell me
the color but she did discribe this dress to a tee! The dress was tight fitting
at the top-came down to a v at the waist, and went to the ground. I was very
interesed by now so I made a trip to the Archives and shared my story. I looked
thru books of photos to see if I could see anyone or anything that would give
me a clue of who this person was. At that time of the morning there is no-one
eles around, no students, no teachers. No one else arrives till 8:00a.m.So I
know I'm not seeing anyone who should be out there.Nothing was found but I'm
not giving up. I would like to find out who this person is or should I say was!
Verious sightings have happened at <st1:City><st1:place>Cranbrook</st1:place></st1:City>.
I'm not the only person that has seen or felt things at this 100 year old
Campus. It have many buildings and about 315 acres of property. Brookside
Elementary was the second building erected<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and it is now attached to the Meeting House where many events when on
there and was actually a school back in the early 1900's. I've never seen her
walk both ways only coming from the way of the Meeting House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a web site for <st1:City><st1:place>Cranbrook</st1:place></st1:City>
if anyone is interesed. Very informative and tells of the history of <st1:City><st1:place>Cranbrook</st1:place></st1:City>
and it's grounds. They also have tours for the public, a Science center, <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Art</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Academy</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and beautiful Flower
Gardens. I would really like someone to help me with this siteing of the Lady
in Red. Maybe some help of understanding why I'm the only one in our Kitchen
that has seen her and why when I walk into the center of the room at the
Meeting House, my hair stands up on end. I haven't seen her so far this year
and Mark at Archives asked me to keep notes of when I see her. Like the time of
day, time of year and the weather. And usually nothing is seen or any
happenings around our building unless things start to get hectic in the school.
Such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.A very busy time for the Staff and the
students.I'm glad I was able to share this with someone and know that there is
help out there to understand the other side. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghostly Encounter</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: aymeaponte@sbcglobal.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I've had many
encounters of the ghostly kind and after reading some of the stories, I decided
to share one. I was 15 years old and lived in <st1:place><st1:City>Newark</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>N.J.</st1:State></st1:place> at the time. The house I lived at was
a three story house and was divided into three apartments. The basement had
been divided into seperate rooms, which were rented out to single men. The
house had front and rear access to the three apartments, but the only access to
the basement was through the rear door. At the bottom of the steps was the door
to the basement and in order to enter the basement rooms you had to have a key.
The only ones with a key were the landlord and the men that had rooms down
there. Sorry if this is boring you, but i need to explain a few details that
will become relevant in the story. At the left of the house there was a big
driveway that had been converted into four parking slots so the drive way left
enough room for one vehicle at a time. At the end of the driveway there was a
big garage that took up the whole rear of the property, it housed six cars and
off to the right side of the garage there was a door that led to a downstairs
apartment. On the right side of the house there was a large parking lot that
was compleatly fenced in. Our house was compleatly fenced all around and at the
rear on the right of the garage near the door to the garage apartment was a
wooden fence that conected to the rear of the house and was at least eight feet
tall. On the left was a chainlink fence with a gate and padlock that led to the
yard of the neighbors' house which was also compleatly fenced in. Our next door
neighbors had a very aggresive watch dog. One night this dog started howling a
little past <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time> which would
last about five minutes. He did this every night for about two weeks. A few
nights after he stopped,I came home after going out with my boyfriend. Whenever
my boy iend brought me home he would park in front of my drive way and we would
talk for about ten to fifteen minutes before we said goodnight. As he parked I
turned in the seat so that I could face him and from this angle I had a good
view of the driveway all the way to the garage. My curfew was <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">ten thirty</st1:time> and we arrived at <st1:time minute="5" hour="10">five after ten</st1:time>. We were talking about five or
ten minutes when movement in front of the garage caught my eye. As i'm typing
this every hair on my body is standing straight up at the memory! Anyway, my
eyes are automatically drawn in that direction and what I saw surprised me. I
saw a very short ( 5' tall at the most) black woman walking from the neighbors
gate that is always padlocked to the middle of the driveway and stop dead in her
tracks. It was almost like she could feel my eyes on her, because when she
stopped she turned her head and looked straight at me. When our eyes locked I
felt goosebumps all over my body.For the few seconds that we looked at each
other, I got a good look at her. What really got my attention was what she was
wearing. She was wearing a long sleaved blouse on a hot summer day. A long
skirt that covered her feet a shawl over her shoulders and a bandana covering
her hair. Then, like a deer caught in headlights she gave a little start and
scurried behind my house and disappeared out of my sight. My boyfriend had been
talking and did not realize that my jaw was in my lap and I was not listening
to a word he had said. When she had scurreid out of sight I turned back to my
boyfriend with my eyes so wide they nearly touched my hairline. At the same
time I turned to him, he turned to look at me and noticing the look on my face
asked me what was wrong. When i told him he turned around, but of course she
was gone. I said goodnight quickly and went to investigate. I knew all our
neighbors and had never seen this woman before. So i proceeded to the garage
are and first checked the gate from the house was locked as usual. But I still
thought nothing of it and went over to the door that led to the garage
apartment And opened it. From the door you could see the apartment door and I
noticed there was no lights on, besides the apartment was vacant at this time.
I closed the door and entered the rear door of my house and locked it. I went
down to the landing that leads to the basement and looked down into the
basement entrance. And of course it was locked and no noise could be heard from
beyond that door. So i climbed the steps back to the rear door and it was still
locked and from the landing I had full view of that door. I climbed all the way
to the third floor and found no trace of her any where. At this point I
thought, for her to get out she would have had to pass me which she didn't, or
to jump over the eight foot fence which would have been imposible. I am
5'4" and I could barely touch the top of the fence. I was so spooked I ran
down to the second floor and flew into our apartment locking the door securly.
I told a friend the next day and she told me that a two days before the
neighbors dog had been poisoned by someone who later broke in and robbed their
house. The dog was found dead a little after <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">ten
 PM</st1:time>. Also while living in the house we all saw dark shadows out of
the corner of your eye, but when you looked there was nothing there. I hated
being home alone because i would see a lot of dark shadows. Well I'm still not
sure what I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>saw that night but I am sure
it was not one of our neighbors. I asked around and no one knew her or anyone
that fit that description, and no one saw her but me. So what do you think?
Ghost or not?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

happen to be<span style="">&nbsp; </span>nice to me. She was reading
a book that was on then The New York Times new paper's best selling list for a

he made famous in his books.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I happen to
have liked him and enjoy listening to his stories. One night I was alone in my

<p class="MsoNormal">One summers evening in 1981 I was on the phone talking to
someone I happen to be in a dark hallway of my home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden I had this horrible feeling
to come over me so bad that I had to turn on the hall light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden I saw a friend that I knew
since second grade that I kept in touch with on and off for years come out of
nowhere and went into the bedroom of my parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had on a white long night grown with pink
and blue ribbons in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked funny
she was just walking straight without looking to the left or right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so amazed to have seen something like
that!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cut the phone call short and
went into my parents room and asked my mother did she see anyone come into the
room?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother said she saw no one but
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to sleep something or someone woke me
up it felt like someone took a hair brush and run it across my toes no one was
there I was alone in my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next day I received a call from this same friend's family telling me she had
passed away in her sleep last night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was a young lady that had a husband and new born daughter and she was only 22
years young. I believed she passed away at the same time I saw her. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I was so surprised to hear that she died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I talked to her about a week or two before
her death she seemed happy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing
that was odd my mother kept on telling me to call her up my friend. My mother
said she had this feeling she couldn't shake. I said I would, but I ever got
the chance to talk to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
believe it was her spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe
when you die G_d takes your spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe
it could have been Satan and his demons playing jokes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was real creepy!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunting at <st1:place><st1:City>Old Farm Community Center</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Colorado</st1:State></st1:place> Springs</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: wildporche@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 8, my dad became caretaker of the community
center at Old Farm in <st1:State><st1:place>Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>
Springs from 1982-1992.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>As caretaker we lived
in the 'Private Residence' part of the farm house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can actually remember the first night I
spent there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad and I slept in
sleeping bags on the floor in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I knew from that night that something wasnt right there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could FEEL it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived there for 10 years, and many things
happened in that 10 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dont
remember the order, but here are some of the things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hear foot steps up stairs in the
middle of the night when no one was around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was playing house one day in the community center (a door connecting
our part of the house to the community center was in my bedroom, and I used to
play over there when I could tollerate it) Anyway, I had my 'bed' set up under
the up-right piano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was laying
there, the peddles on the piano started to move by themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got so scared that I made my dad go gather
my toys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I remember right, I didnt go
back in there for a very long time. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When over in that area of the house, my best friend and I
would catch glimpses out of the corner of our eyes of someone going around
corners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lady would talk, not really
to us, but it was as if she were talking to her husband about how thier party
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hear voices from my room,
but never wanted to hear what they were saying.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I always turned up my stereo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night my dad's girlfriend was sitting upstairs watching the city lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in my dad's room talking to him or
reading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came in and asked what I
wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told us that she heard her
name and turned around and saw 'me' standing at the door. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When she spoke to 'me', I guess 'I' ran down the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad knew as well as I did that I was in
his room the whole time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I remember
is putting my face in a pillow and screaming.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On one occasion I had a friend spend the night and we could hear the
piano playing...not through the wall like normal, but through the heat
vents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day when I was in high
school, I was laying on the floor in my room with headphones on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a couple of windchimes hanging around
my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed that one was swinging
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no air
disturbance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The heat wasnt on, and I
always kept my windows closed up tight...(I had a peeping 'Billy' so I
thumbtacked my curtains to the walls)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When that chime stopped moving I looked over at another one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That one was moving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It continued to go back and forth from probably
half an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One and then the other,
but never at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we were
getting ready to move, all of my black shirts came up missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I searched all over the house for them
numerous times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldnt find them for
the life of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a week before we
moved I went into the livingroom and found a black garbage bag sitting in the
middle of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened it to find
all of my black shirts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked my dad
where he found them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought I put
the bag there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didnt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two scariest things that happened where: </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I woke up one night within the first year of living
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least I think I was
awake....Anyway, there was a figure in my door way calling my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this day I sleep with my head covered by my blankets because of
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other thing that scared me
happened about the last month I was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My dad and I were fighting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
told me to go to hell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said that can
be arranged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I grabbed my exacto knife
and sat behind my door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to
move to jam it</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">into my wrist to rip it open.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Something grabbed my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">arm and didnt let go until I dropped the knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could FEEL the hand on my arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something definately grabbed me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always told my dad there was something
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would laugh it off and tell me
there was no such thing as ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
we moved to <st1:State><st1:place>Michigan</st1:place></st1:State> my dad and
my grandma were talking about how my aunt and uncles house was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my dad that no matter what he thinks,
OLD FARM WAS HAUNTED!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He decided since
we had moved out of there that it was time to tell me...Mrs. Barnes commit
suicide in the garage there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we
moved in we turned the garage into my dads room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked into it a little bit. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She killed herself in 1976.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My best friend went out to find her gave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went out there in September 1992....On
the same day that Mrs. Barnes died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
is the end of my experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know
there were tons of other things that happened, but those are the ones I can
think of right now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My wife and I moved to <st1:City><st1:place>Memphis</st1:place></st1:City>
about six years ago. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We purchased a home, we are told was build around 1908.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We began to remodel the home, tearing out
walls in two of the bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this
time, my wife Marci, told me she saw a hazy figure of a person wearing a plaid
shirt several times, always at night. Our two dogs would react, growling with
the hair on their backs standing up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
figure appeared several times throughout the first remodeling project.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had similar experiences with each remodel
project following.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in the living room, talking to my
brother on the telephone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
discussing the the experiences Marci had.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was more than a little skeptical, as I had seen nothing unusual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I expressed my skepticism to my brother,
the front stairway light switched on by itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We later learned a man named Ralph Chapman lived in this home, and died
in the home, in the 1950's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife is
still alive, and works as a crossing guard for the school district in
town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that means Mr.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Chapman died a fairly young man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Chapman told Marci that after her
husbands death, she was not able to afford the house, and had to sell it and
move out. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We have not had any unusual experiences in a couple
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">hey. everyone this is one of the weirdest experiences i have
had in a long time. its actually two stories but whatever. ok first story.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my dog jus passed away because of huge cancerous tumors in
her breasts. we had her since she was 2 weeks old. she was very sick and sore.
when she would go and lay on our couch she would groan and sigh when she got
comfy. k well she died on May 23rd and this happened on June 2nd.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was laying in bed and the living room is right next to my
room. it was at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30</st1:time> when i
heard the couch start creaking and making all these weird noises. then i heard
the sighing and the groan. it was very weird so i got up and investigated. and
in the spot where my dog always laid was a large indent in the couch. as soon
as i said her name teh couch cushion went back to normal. i was not really
scared because i knew it was her. adn then the next day. my mom was cleaning up
teh house and we got this new dog. a little french bulldog who thinks that shes
the toughest. this pup was layin on the couch and all of a sudden she started
freakin out barkin growlin and pawing at the place where my old dog used to
lay. and when my mom went tothe couch to see what the dogs problem was she saw
the imprint. she is a totally a skeptic and i didnt tell her my experience
until, the next day. it was a weird experience. thanx for listening</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">there is a house on broadway in <st1:City><st1:place>madisonville</st1:place></st1:City>,
ky that I personally know is haunted. there used to be a big wagon wheel light
fixture that would actually start to spin in the middle of the night. and the
dog would stand at the bottom of the stairs and growl, that deep gut growl. but
there was never anything or anyone that we saw there. however, you could here footsteps
on the stairs which was kind of odd, being that the stairs were carpeted. and
late at night alight would come on in ome of the upstairs bedrooms by it's
self.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dont know the story of the
house. but have been there and saw these thing's myself. if anyone happens to
know any other stories about the house, let me know. the house faces broadway
on the corner of broadway andsomething and has a glassed in front porch. brick
home that has a side entrance to. my experiences were about 15-20 years ago, but
the house is still there and occupied .</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We are moving, so I feel fine about telling everyone about
this place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:City>Lincoln</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>AL</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>it is soon to be a commercial lot - a car lot to be exact.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The land there is haunted. The 12 X 60 mobile home we live
in has been in the family since 1974 and nobody ever died in it. It will be
moved before July 2005 - as soon as it is sold. The people who are about to
occupy that property are in for a big surprise.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My oldest brother was the first to live in the mobile home -
one night after drinking too much he saw a figure in a nightgown with a
nightcap holding a candle - it walked down the hallway toward the bedroom and
disappeared. He does not believe in ghosts and put it out of his mind, not
saying anything about it until years later. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My youngest brother lived there next - in the late 80's,
early 90's. He too, saw the same figure - and he had also been drinking. It
scared him, he then went to sleep and didn't say anything about it until my
husband and I moved in and had seen it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We moved in January 1993 (non-drinkers) and for the first
six months we each saw this figure - it would cross from the back of the
trailer to the front, then 25 or 30 minutes later would cross from the front to
the back. After six months of seeing this figure and not saying anything to the
other, we both said (at the same time) "Did you see that?" Then we
started discussing it and telling each other what we saw. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had also had something touch me just shortly after moving
in - it sent icy chills down my body - I even had goose bumps on my face and
seemingly on my teeth. I ran out of there so fast! After my husband and I
talked about what we had seen, we continued to see other figures over the past
12 1/2 years. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A small dog ran down the hallway while we I was in the
bathroom and my husband was in the kitchen. I said "Where did that dog
come from?" and he looked and said "What dog?" just as he said
that, it disappeared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The state was doing construction and demolition in the area
to build a new road in 2000 - 2002 when Honda came to <st1:City><st1:place>Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City>.
During this time, there were at least 6 or 7 new figures that appeared to be
trying to get a message to me - I asked a couple of construction guys if they
had found anything in the way of human remains in this area - as they had dug a
considerable amount. He told me they hadn't, looked at me strange, and then
said "With the rush we're in, even if we did, I probably wouldn't hear
about it." I "Told" the figures this and it was really creepy.
They appeared to me one night - a black man with cut-off pants just below the
knees, the figure in pajamas, and 3 other figures that were hard to
distinguish. I had been reading a book about poltergeists. I put the book down and
got rid of it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the past 2 1/2 years I have seen only the first figure.
My neighbors have reported seeing the black man in their homes - one of my
neighbors even pointed a shotgun at it just before it disappeared into thin
air. We've all tried to find out something about the land - all we know is that
it has been in the McCaig family for years upon years upon years.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was 10 years old when my little incident happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was dark outside and i was in my room
listening to the radio and dancing, of course.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of a sudden, these kids were passing by my window and I told them to
leave so we started an arguement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
they walked away from my window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
standing in the middle of my room just listening to my radio when i heard
chains passing by my window and i felt a chill down by spin but there was no
wind. .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first i thought, it was those
kids but i was wrong, very wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
approaching the window and i noticed that my lights started flickering. I
didn't think nothing of it because i thought the light bulb popped or
somthing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And i was reaching the window
when i felt someone was behind me but it couldn't been any my family because
they were in the livingroom, any way, my neck hair was starting to stand up and
a weird feeling was in my stomach .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,
i got to the window and my hand was shaking really bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When i opened the window nobody was there and
there was no wind outside and no leaves on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, i closed the window and i turned around
and whatever it was it was gone because i heard the door slowy and squeakly
closed and the feeling i had left when the door fully closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After, the door closed the lights completely
went off then came back on. Also, the radio volume was going up and down.
Then,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>weeks after i kept seeing black
shadows, figures linguring in and out of my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And until this day i hear and see those black
shadows and hear some chains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For now,

<p class="MsoNormal">PLAY MONSTER MASH ONE MORE TIME</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Barb627417@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have written a story of mine once before called a haunting
on <st1:Street><st1:address>irving avenue</st1:address></st1:Street>. Well
once<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that house started becoming active,
i started going on web sites and doing lots of things trying to find out what
exactly was going on in my house. Then i learned that with paranormal ectivity
you cant know for sure.I found that we could never make it a home because it
was always negative to us and anyone whom steped in it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well to the story. It was holloween night and my Friend Sam
and i were home alone at my house. We went out at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> to do some more trick or treating. As we walked up my
walkway at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10ish</st1:time> we heard a noice coming from inside my
house. We went up the porch and as i unlocked the door we realized it was music
coming from the living room. When we got inside, we heard "Monster
Mash" being played. I shut it off and to comfort my friend i told her it
was probly my mother. I callled My mother and sister whom both said that they
have'nt been home. Thinking maybe they were trying to play a little holloween
joke on us i ignored the experience and went on with eating candy and telling
story's with sam. We were in my kitchen when all of the sudden<span style="">&nbsp; </span>heard "Monster Mash" being played.
We both looked at eachother as if we were seeing if the other heard it. Being
that i had already been in the house a year, i knew that something was turning
the sterio on. (being this was'nt the first time things went on on their own)
We spent the night in in fright. When finaly i said to the thing that was doing
this " just stop already!" I was more fustrated than scard. Not
exspecting a responce we heard a voice speak "one more time" we both
got frightend and ran outside on the porch which we planed on staying there
until someone came home. About 5 minutes had passed and still no sign of the
sterio going on. Whe it started up agian. We let it play because we were to
scard to go back inside. The strange thing was that Monst Mash was # 7 on the
CD out of 20 but when it went on it went straight to Monster Mash and when it ended,
The sterio simply turned off.</p>

THEN OUT OF NOWHERE THIS LITTLE GIRL WITH CURLY BLONDE HAIR APPEARED AND SAID
MY NAME. I STAYED STAIRING LIKE ALL SCARED. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE JUST
DISSAPEARED. I WAS SO QUIET THE NEXT DAY AND WHEN NIGHT CAME I WAS SO SCARED.
HAD I SEEN A GHOST I? THOUGHT TO MYSELF. SOOM EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE WAS ASLEEP
EXCEPT ME. I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING FOR A WHILE, SO I THOUGHT I WAS SEEING THINGS,
BUT THEN I HEARD THE LITTLE GIRLS VOICE AGAIN. BUT THIS TIME I DIDN'T GO CHECK,
I JUST FELL ASLEEP. LATER IN THE NIGHT, I WOKE UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND
WHEN I OPENED MY EYES I SAW THE LITTLE GIRL SITTING AT THE END OF MY BED. I
SCREANED SO LOUD THAT JUST AS SOON AS MY PARENTS GOT TO MY ROOM, SHE WAS GONE.
I SAW THE LITTLE GIRL MANY MORE TIMES, BUT I WAS NO LONGER AFRAID. SHE NEVER
DID ANYTHING TO ME. BUT NOW I LIVE IN <st1:State><st1:place>TEXAS</st1:place></st1:State>
AND I NO LONGER SEE THE LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE. AND THATS MY STORY.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">"Hi, my name is Jimmy"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: beanhead36@juno.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you so much for you site. This is a long story, but I
hope it is worth your space and time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I too, have had
"ghostly encounters", prophetic dreams(have dreams about my mom
dying, only to find out later she was in a serious accident, same with my best
friend Mike~rolled his ATV and split his head open, my stepson in a car
accident...etc). Whenever someone I am close to(emotionally), gets hurt, either
physically or emotionally, I feel it, or have symptoms of their illness. For
example, my friend Mike(he's in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">CA) shot himself in the leg. My left leg got swollen, and
stayed that way for three days, until I talked to him. My sister had an
appendicitis attack, I had abdominal cramping. Somedays I will have complete
sadness, and just want to cry for no reason, until I start making phone calls,
and find out who is in distress....Some times it sucks being so empathetic, but
I would not give up my gift.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I need to take you
back to my beginning, so I can relate my sons "encounter" in 2000,
and my daughters "encounter" last week, and why I believe them... </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was an infant(living in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>)
my mom said I would rock myself to sleep. That is, I would set my crib(on
rockers) to moving back and forth. I think this is an explanation she made up
for herself, as to why a tiny babys' crib is rocking on it's own. I remember
after I moved from my crib, to a "big girl bed" the rocking sensation
continued(my body did not move), and to this day, when I lay down at night I
can still "feel" myself being rocked,especially if I have had an
emotionally charged,(good or bad), day. As a toddler, when we moved into our
house in <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Rincon</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the shadow people would visit me, along with
a black cat.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For the longest time I was the only one who could see them,
and I learned to accept them as an every day thing. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then the dreams started. Wonderful glorious dreams of having
beautiful children~I was 8 at the time, but in my dreams I was an adult. In my
dreams, my children, a boy and a girl, would be with me when I picked my
husband up from work. In my dreams I was allowed to see every detail of my
children. They were blond haired, brown eyed beautiful children(I have brown
&amp; brown). The boy was older, but not by much. They were not allowed to tell
me their names, and I was not able to see what their father looked like. In my
dreams we were a happy family.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now back to my reality. When I met my first husband, I
thought he was the man of my dreams. Thank God, he wasn't. My first marriage
was short, and unhappy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In 1994 I met my second husband(but not for the first time,
our paths had crossed many times over the years before I moved here, to <st1:State><st1:place>Illinois</st1:place></st1:State>
in 1994). Even though he has his moments, he is a good hearted man(blond &amp;
green)~PLUS the father of my two BLOND HAIRED, BROWN EYED children, my son <st1:City><st1:place>Trenton</st1:place></st1:City>
is 22 months to the day older than my daughter Miranda. He also brought a son
along with him, Nate(brown&amp; green).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even though I am only 15 years older than my step son, I have never
treated him any different than if I had given birth to him myself. I love that
boy with my whole heart. AND...I take my husband to, and pick him up from work
everyday!!!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since I have had many(to many to relate now)encounters, when
my children started showing signs of being intuitive/sensitive, I did not
regard them as just having<span style="">&nbsp; </span>good
imaginations(which they do). </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our pictures always contain orbs, ectoplasm, and the like.
At least three out of every roll developed. My sons birth, and subsequent trip
home were some what uneventful(he just got stuck and refused to budge, the
doctors comment "He just does not want to come out"), while my
daughter was born with a hole in her heart, and the umbilical cord around her
neck. She spent her first week of life in the neonatal ICU. We had to monitor
her closely when we came home. My husband was a wreck, that was until he saw
her angels( I still tear up thinking about this). She was asleep in her
bassinet, and we were in our bed. I was out like a light, as my husband watched
over her, and started to doze off. He had been having a nightmare about
something bad happening to our daughter, when he awoke from sleep he looked
over at her, sitting around her bassinet were at least two dozen little angels.
He woke me up, and all I saw was a fading glow. I believe they were there not
only to watch over our baby girl, but to reassure my husband that she would be
fine. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have watched my children take head dives towards our
hearth, only to slow down in mid-fall, and not get a scratch or slight bump when
their heads hit(talk about heart stopping moments).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Along with these saving moments, our resident spirit is
quite the prankster. Taking things, then putting them back somewhere we had
looked moments before(mostly it's my keys, and books, and kids small toys). If
we can not find what we are looking for, all we have to do is say "please
bring it back." "He" took one of my older boys' shoes, and did
not bring it back for weeks. When "He" finally returned it, I was
doing dishes, and home alone. I got the chills then the hair on my neck stood
up. When I turned, there it was, right in the middle of the kitchen floor. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At one point, I was going to smudge the house. I had a
bundle of sage that was picked by a friends husband. My sage disappeared. I
made a deal with our ghost, I told him if he returned the sage he could stay,
but nothing bad was allowed to enter our home, and I would toss the sage on our
burn pile. Not 5 minutes later, my sage was back on my shelf.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our experiences are not confined to our home, though. My son
had his first scary encounter at the old state prison, in <st1:place><st1:City>Laramie</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Wyoming</st1:State></st1:place>, back in July of 2000. <st1:City><st1:place>Trenton</st1:place></st1:City>
was 3 almost 4, a little on the clingy side, but very well spoken for his
age(he was using complete sentences before he was 1 year old). He's as smart as
a whip, but takes a more cautious approach to life. Preferring to stand back to
check which way the current is flowing, before jumping in.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We went on a tour of the prison, and my son kept expressing
his uneasiness. He kept saying he could "feel" bad things. He was too
young to know what a gas chamber is, but when we got to it, he started to
really freak out. "NO, Mommy! don't go in there!" and so on. We
continued our tour. When we got to the gallows room, the hole in the floor was
sealed, and it looked like an ordinary small room, he just about went into
fits. Now mind you, my children are very well behaved, and not prone to acting
out in public, so his behavior was very startling to me. I went to take a step
into the room, and he started screaming "No mommy, don't go in there.
Please don't go in there it's bad." "Daddy, get out of there it's
BAD!!!" He was pulling on me, then on my husband. I decided it was time to
listen to him, and get out of there. Even though I felt the negative vibes, I understood
where they were coming from and why they were there, so it did not have the
same effect on me as it did him.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now we will fast forward to Memorial Day weekend, and Jimmy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Let me start this part of the story with a little info about
my daughter.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The hole in her heart was the only weakness my daughter has
ever had, her body, a wonderful pediatrician, and the strength of prayer &amp;
God, fixed that within a week. She did not require surgery. Miranda came out
fighting,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and is now Miss. Rough and
Tumble. She runs with the Big Dogs, and heaven help you if you get in her way.
She is as sweet as pie, and just an all around wonderful girl. She has never
had a fear of the dark, or going places on her own( for example, to the
outhouse/bathroom while we are camping). This changed last weekend, when we met
Jimmy...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">...Devil's <st1:place><st1:City>Lake</st1:City>, <st1:State>Wisconsin</st1:State></st1:place>,
site 243, there are 7 of us camping, my friend Michelle(soul family, we are),
her two boys Jack(13) &amp; Ben(11).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Their dog Vetta, Vetta plays a roll in this too. My husband,
two of our three children, <st1:City><st1:place>Trenton</st1:place></st1:City>(9)
and Miranda(7), and myself.Thursday, May 26th, 2005. It was evening, and we
just finished setting up our tents and the rest of camp, my daughter, and the
boys took off to use the bathroom. She had no problems going into the women's
room by herself (it is well lit).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When she came back she said, "I heard my imaginary
friend. He talked to me. He said 'Hi, my name is Jimmy'." I just about
crapped my pants. I ran her through about two dozen questions, are you sure you
were the only one in there, are you sure it wasn't the boys messing around, and
so on. From her answers, I concluded that it was more than an imaginary friend.
She was spooked by the experience and would not go back into the bathroom by
herself during the night. I had to go with her, and she clung like a burr to my
side. I asked her why she wouldn't go alone. All she said was
"Jimmy".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is one stall
she refused to use, and I never even opened the door of it myself.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After the kids went to bed, Michelle, my husband and I had a
talk. Well, my husband mostly listened. She said Miranda had told her the same
story, so we took it upon ourselves to go investigate. That evening we only
felt the presence of a little boy, but when we started back to camp, I felt
someone watching from the woods off to the left of us. We were just about the
only campers there, and there wasn't anyone camping directly near us.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I asked Michelle if she could feel it, she says "Nah, I
don't feel anything. Plus you're better at that than I am." I said
"Better at what?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">You're telling me you can not feel that?!" She replied
"No." then shivered very hard. I kind of giggled at her, then asked
"Do you feel it now?"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Her reply, a grumbled "Yes." Then on the way back
to camp, she kept asking it to leave her alone. It was not being mean, just
getting her attention.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next day when they all went hiking, I got to stay and
watch camp, and keep the dog company. I decided to take the dog into the
bathroom with me. She entered okay, but when I started walking toward the end
stall(it's HUGE), Vetta dropped down, and braced herself with all fours, Vetta
is a 75lb. Weinmeriener(sp?), and got a scared look on her face.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Her hackles went up, and she refused to move. I said "I
need to pee, could you please leave her be?" I walked her away, then back
to the stall. She went in with no problems. Then, when I went to wash my hands,
she would not go near the sinks bracing with all fours, again... so, I walked
away "All I want to do is wash my hands" came back, and washed my hands.
As long as I announced where I was going with the dog "We are leaving
now", our way was not blocked.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That evening, when Miranda asked me to go to the bathroom
with her, I brought along a white candle. She asked what it was for, but I did
not tell her until after we got into the bathroom. I asked her if Jimmy was
there(I could feel him, I just wanted to know if she could, too). She said
"Yes, he is." I asked her how she knew when he was there. She said
she could hear him. I said besides hearing him, how else do you know he is
here. She lowered her voice, looked in my eyes and said "I can feel him,
mom."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I took the white candle out and lit it. She asked what it
was for. I told her we would keep it lit while we were in the bathroom, then
when we were done, we would say a prayer for Jimmy and blow it out. We finished
our business, then as we were about to leave Miranda says "Is it time to
say our prayer to Jimmy?" I said "No, we do not pray to Jimmy we pray
to God.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We pray to God, and ask him to help Jimmy find peace."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had hoped this gift had passed my daughter by, and had
truly thought it had, because she had never shown any signs of having it...That
was until we met Jimmy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you so very much for your time, and letting me share
our experiences with you in a forum where I know I will not be judged.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">You may contact me if you want to, just put "Re:
Jimmy" in the subject line.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks again~</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In January of 1999 I had finished building a house about 600
feet from <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Battleship</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Mountain</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a smoke alarm system put in the house
that when smoke is detected in one room, all smoke detectors go off at the same
time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">However, quite often I would be awakened by only the alarm
going off in my master bedroom, and I would sense a presence in the room
without actually seeing anyone there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
also experienced my bed being bumped or sinking at the foot of the bed as if
someone was sitting on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then one
night, I was awaken to the sound of an Indian drum beating in a war-like
ceremony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went outside and searched as
far as was possible but found that the sound appeared to be coming from the top
of the mountain where no campfires or light of any kind could be seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes during the day I would suddenly
feel as if someone tall was starring at me and would hear movement but not see
anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then that first April I had a
visitor, a University Professor/psychologist who stayed a few days due to a 3
day seminar he was giving in <st1:City><st1:place>Scottsdale</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He announced to me that he could see what he
thought was an Apache medicine man standing by my door observing him, and that
this medicine man was here to protect me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Almost two years later I met a person who had done research on the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Superstition</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Mountains</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and written books about
it who told me about the Apache wars.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told me about one battle where the Apache men were captured by the
white man's army and when the army came to take the rest of the tribe as
prisoners, a medicine man protecting the elderly people, woman and children in
their campsite convinced them to all jump to their deaths rather than be
captured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other guests who have stayed
over night have reported hearing war drums beating and sounds of someone moving
throughout the house when everyone was a sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have also had sightings of Extraterrestrials in my house three
different people.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I first moved in my house in 1999, I was told that
there was a vortex on or near my property, and in 2003 using special equipment
it was confirmed that indeed a vortex runs through my property, through the
master bedroom and continuing on through the center of <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Battleship</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Mountain</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I and one other person have witnessed at <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2 a.m.</st1:time> one night the waving of the walls and
strange blue lighting running along the vortex line going through my house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I'm Mechelle hernandez,but I also go by chelle,(
pronounced like shell) a 16 year old resident of cooks mills, Illinois and I
have quite an experience to share with you.first I'll give you a brief past on
the situation.ever since I was three years old and saw a man who wasn't
there(my parents searched the area thoroughly no one was around our
house)outside my window watching me, I have had quite a few experiences with
ghosts, spirits, energies, flashes, and other paranormal activity(behind our
house is an old pioneer gravesite) one night when I was about 13 I was sleeping
on the couch in the living room where there was a big bay window in which my
mother hung a wind chime (inside the house)on many occasions my great
grandmother and aunt have made them chime when I had been in the room
alone,don't ask how I knew it was them, but trust me I do, but on this night it
was different. being an insomniac I was the only one left in the house still
awake,trying desperately to get to sleep when out of nowhere the chimes went
off as if they had been violently smacked then as suddenly as they chimed they
stopped,I knew it wasn't my relatives this time, then they began to chime as if
a small child was playing with them. uncertain of what else to do,and no longer
afraid of communicating, I asked if the spirit would tell me who they were and
how old they were. as I asked the chimes stopped so I figured that it left.but
after about a minute the couch seemed to get chilled and I heard a small
child's voice, it sounded like a small frightened girl and she said two things
and left 'laci"and"I am eight years old" then the heat returned
to the couch.I really had no contact with her(at least not confirmed to be her)
after that night but a few months ago(now 16 years old) my best friend, a
believer of the paranormal,whom I share my experiences with, my mother whom is
also psychic, and I decided to band together and begin paranormal
investigations beginning with a place my friend had heard of named Ashore
estates, in case you hadn't heard of it here's some info.,Ashmore Estates -
West of Ashmore - Ashmore estates was an old insane asylum, legend has it that
the government stopped the funding and all the employees left the patients.
With no where to go and the inability it help themselves. The patients all died
of starvation and dehydration. Illegal as it may be, when people venture into
the building, strange voices are heard, and when leaving people have reported
loud banging noises, and when looking back they saw the trunk of their car dent
in and out as if being pounded on.I can also tell you that it was built on the
same property that a poor house once stood on but a fire destroyed that taking
the life of a young girl. it was more of a hospital than an insane asylum, but
many of the people housed had illnesses that caused them to loose their mind
but no one can really find or know the true past of this location.well we took
a few pictures as soon as we got there(around 6:30)and set up a tape for white
noise with an offering of crackers, then we began looking through the house.as
soon as we entered I felt as if I were being followed by a presence for about
five minutes.my friend and I went to the second floor for awhile where there
was an old front desk,like for check-in at a hospital and Jessie(my friend)got
a strange feeling and told me to get my mother and bring her up there, and I
left her there alone at the front desk, nothing at this house felt right, but
when we returned I found Jessie standing pale faced behind the desk, I had
warned here she shouldn't have let me leave her alone, and she had told me she
had opened the door to the small office behind the desk to look around when she
heard a noise behind her so she turned towards the desk to see a woman in an
old nurse's uniform digging through these open drawers as if organizing them
then closing each one.sure enough the three drawers that had been open when I
left were now closed(they were very dusty so if she had done it she would have
left finger prints).things got worse the later it got,my 13 year old brother
had come with us because he was too afraid to stay home alone, so all four of
us were walking through the very bottom floor when we came to a big, heavy,
metal door and we walked through(mind you it was not on a spring nor was there
a breeze in the house) and as soon as my brother walked through it(he was
behind us) it SLAMMED shut hard and he ran outside to wait in the truck for the
rest of the night.(later he told me on his way out something kept poking the
back of his neck)Later my friend found a way in the attic, as soon as we
entered it we could feel the temperature drop as it had earlier in the ,once
hidden, crematorium where we set up the tape.as we walked through it, now about
8:30, we kept seeing a small shadow move from the corner of our eye then we got
to the middle of the room and we saw a big flash of light then the back of our
heads hurt as if we had been hit with an ax.a little later after that stopped
hurting my friend who had been walking next to me suddenly froze in place,
zoned out, I called her name but she didn't reply for about a minute then she
whispered "laci" and snapped back not remembering a thing, when I
brought up laci she turned and told me she saw a girl,for only a second, she
saw a small girl about 9 laying in the corner. as I walked over into the corner
there was this extreme energy that I felt all around me and that's when flashes
of picture memories flooded my mind of a small girl being placed in the attic
with a big man meant to do her harm, the ladder stairs being taken away,people
in old hospital beds being tortured, then the small girl dead in the corner I
was standing in from a blow to the back of the head. after that me and Jessie
went to leave the attic,immediately, when I felt this threatening energy like I
was in danger, then I lighter energy like the girl was protecting me.after we
got out of the attic, it hit me,laci,she had visited me before, why didn't I
remember that before. I knew she wanted my help. she needed me.we told my
mother what had happened, and the two of us being wiccan, we prayed to the goddess
and the god to help her find freedom, peace,and a new life as well as to send
the man away so he couldn't harm another spirit in that house.I went to
retrieve the tape and we left.we took Jessie home(this had really been her
first actual experience with those passed on) and on the way home we played the
tape hearing a heartbeat and someone saying, in a frightened voice, were not
gone(that to me proved the torturing,burning alive) jingling of janitors keys,
a small boy's voice saying "ohh crackers" and "mine"a few
other things, but the eeriest was a small girls voice<span style="">&nbsp; </span>saying
"chellie......chellie.....chellie". this is only a few of the things
that happened, if you want to talk to me , ask questions, or share experiences
with me, e-mail me at quack_moo_its_cdh7@hotmailcom </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well,there have been alot of stange things happen at my
house, here's one that freaked me out.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night I was working on my truck in the garage, it was
late,about <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2am</st1:time>. My folks were in <st1:State><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:State>
and I was enjoying the time alone. We have</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">5 acres in the wine country of Temecula and not too many
neighbors.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, I suddenly got this feeling of being watched through
the window of the garage, but when I would look,as you would expect....nothing.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This went on for about ten minutes and I looked one more
time only to see someone looking in. I got kinda freaked so I went in the house
only to find a house full of people partying. They were dressed in different
eras of clothing but they didn't seem to pay any attention to me. Was I out of
my mind? I laid down on the couch with my face in the pillows and finally fell
asleep. When I woke up the next morning, Every window and door was wide open
and every light was on.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There have been many little things happen there since<span style="">&nbsp; </span>like the other night, my girlfriend,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I were sitting at our bar talking and
above the bar, there leaks a mysterious red liquid it looks like blood but by
the amount of it, it would smell like something dead, if a mouse or a rat dies
in the attic, it stinks to beat the band. So we were talking about how they
used to use maggots to eat gang green and other rotted flesh in the medical
profession. Just as we ended that conversation two live maggots fell from the
ceiling and landed on the bar. Because both of us wittnessed it. I have no
choice but to believe it. The phone repair guy went into the attic one day to
repair the phone line to the bar and got halfway in the attic and came back
down and told to find someone else. He would in no terms go into that attic
again. He left the house with a quickness. We hear things in the attic and I
have found the door to the entry to attic open one a few times. It's only 30
year old ranch home and doesn't reall have walk space.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Make up your own mind on this one..</p>
