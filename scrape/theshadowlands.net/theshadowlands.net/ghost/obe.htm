<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I used to wear this T-shirt that said,
"Out of Body. Back in 5 Minutes." While it got the occasional chuckle from
some people who read it, the subject of out-of-body experiences (or OOBEs
or OBEs) is far from humorous. The experiences of people who have gone
through OOBEs have been frightening, spiritually invigorating, confusing
and, well, unexplained.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No one is entirely sure what an OOBE is.
Some claim it is the soul's way of visiting the hereafter. Others claim
that OOBEs are the subconscious' way of dealing with trauma (some speculate
that this is what happened to Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz).&nbsp; Numerous
books and articles have been written about OOBE, several documentaries
have been made of people trying to explain them and fiction writers have
taken advantage of this phenomena in the form of short stories, novels
and episodes of TV series such as The X-Files.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What is an OOBE? An out-of-body experience,
or OOBE/OBE, is when you are aware of being outside of your body. Sometimes
you will see your body, sometimes not. Sometimes you will interact with
others on the spiritual plane, sometimes you won't. The out-of-body experience
is known by many other labels: Astral projection, astral travel and psychic
travel. There is some speculation as to OOBEs being a part of the dream
state yet more research needs to be done before this claim can be sound.
The most common way to tell if you are indeed having an OOBE during your
dreams is when you are either flying or being lifted.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The out-of-body experience has been occurring
for hundreds of years. Proponents and researchers of OOBEs speculate that
the OOBE happened during certain parts of the Bible (see <a href="http://www.plim.org/SPIRITCALLINGMODERNMAN.html">http://www.plim.org/SPIRITCALLINGMODERNMAN.html
</a>). This has actually been noted in scripture, as you can find references
to out-of-body experiences in the book of Second Corinthians. The Greeks
believed we have a "double body," which Plato and Socrates explored in
their writing. The "double body," according to the ancient Greeks, is a
second body within the physical one which can leave the physical world
in search of answers to questions, solutions to problems, to peek into
the future or to "see" things which the mortal body cannot see -- or understand.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some have considered OOBEs to be a part
of their religious experience, as when they think they are visiting with
angels or receiving messages from God. Others more attuned to the New Age
movement consider an OOBE to be a method of spiritual meditation or spiritual
enlightenment. Shamans, for example, use OOBEs in their quest for healing.
Buddhism extols the virtues of out-of-body experiences, as well, calling
this state "nirvana." Additionally, Native Americans consider such experiences
to be a beneficial part of their ceremonies, having OOBEs during their
vision quests.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Despite the many perceptions and uses of
the OOBE, one factor in every case is the silver cord. This barely noticeable
cord is the spiritual body's attachment to its physical counterpart. No
matter where our astral body may go during an OOBE, the cord keeps it connected
to the physical body in order to ensure its safe return. Once this cord
is severed, it is believed, the physical body dies and the astral body
remains on the spiritual plane forever. Yet nothing seems to have the ability
to break the silver cord unless circumstances in the physical world cause
the death of the soul's physical body. For example, if a person is having
an OOBE during their sleep and they die, the cord is broken and the astral
body is free from its physical body. There is no limit to the length of
this cord and some out-of-body regulars have claimed they have seen it.
In fact, some have claimed that they even felt their astral bodies being
"pulled" by this cord back to their physical bodies upon the completion
of an OOBE.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What causes an OOBE? Some New Age members
claim they can cause&nbsp; an out-of-body experience at will, as with Shamans
or Yogis.&nbsp; Some believe that an OOBE will happen at any time and there's
no real way to predict when. Despite these beliefs, scientists in Switzerland
claim that an OOBE can be manually activated with the use of electrodes
on a region of the brain (see http://www.nature.com/nsu/020916/020916-8.html
). Narcotic drugs can cause an OOBE, as well as certain symbols and smells.&nbsp;
Is trauma at fault? It very well may be. It has been reported by crime
victims and by survivors of disasters that they suddenly felt like they
were "outside of themselves" during certain points of the crime or disaster.
While some think that perhaps this is the subconscious' way of coping with
trauma and that it can't really be called of out-of-body experience,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">instances like this have also been seen
as a way for the person's astral body to assist them or to help them "shut
down" during these trying times.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Is an OOBE the same as a near-death experience?
A near-death experience (NDE) is a spiritual phenomena that occurs right
before a person dies. This can be where the astral body communicates with
loved ones on the other side, observes what is happening to their physical
body or sees a great light that signifies an awaiting paradise. Some believe
that an OOBE and an NDE are the same thing yet this is not true since an
OOBE can happen to anyone, whether you are near-death or not.&nbsp; Additionally,
an NDE occurs only before you are about to cross over whereas an OOBE can
happen at any time during your life.&nbsp; However, the only time an OOBE
and an NDE can simultaneously happen is when you are having the NDE, because
these are times you will really be outside of your body.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An out-of-body experience is supposed to
be a peaceful time, where a great sense of peace, abandonment and a new
sense of happiness is said to take hold of your astral body. Some who have
experienced an OOBE, however, have often felt afraid during this state.
It's important to recognize that you are having an out-of-body experience
so that you can relax and enjoy your very unique experience. An OOBE doesn't
just happen to everyone, after all, and they are the times where you can
learn something new about yourself or see something which you may never
otherwise see as a human being. (One woman claimed, for example, that she
travelled across the planet Uranus during an OOBE.) We sometimes are given
a heads-up of a pending OOBE, in which case we enter what is called the
"vibrational state." During this time, you may feel inner vibrations or
hear strange sounds in your head. There may be a ticking sound or a humming
sound prior to the onset of an OOBE.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some have come out of their OOBE feeling
nervous or ashamed.&nbsp; Skeptics consider OOBEs to occur only for the
New Age crowd yet reports of OOBEs have shown that an OOBE can happen to
anyone, no matter what their religion or beliefs. Some devout religious
followers feel that having an OOBE is evil and considered a sin.&nbsp;
There is absolutely nothing evil about an OOBE; they are a natural part
of your spiritual self and can open virtual doors to help you in your understanding
of all things spiritual.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As we progress in this new millennium,
exploring new technology and taking away the taboos preventing us from
learning of new things, more research and discussion can be done about
OOBEs.&nbsp; Until that time, more books will be written and more documentaries
hoping for an explanation will be done. More writers will continue to explore
OOBEs in fiction yet it is in the real world where we hope to one day know
what an out-of-body experience truly is -- and what we can ultimately gain
from having one.</font>
