<P><B>   Well, I too have had a very strange experience </B>
<P><B>and I still think upon it still to this day even though it happened
along time </B>
<P><B>ago, I vividly recall in my mind the image of what I saw some 25 years
</B>
<P><B>ago!</B>
<P><B>I was around 16 or 17 years old at </B>
<P><B>the time. And it was quite late perhaps 11:30 pm ,and as I recall,
I was driving </B>
<P><B>home from my sisters place and I remember not wanting to take the main
roads </B>
<P><B>home so I took the short cut which required me to drive down old country
roads </B>
<P><B>that were not lit up and were always a little creepy to me. However,
In a </B>
<P><B>hurry to get home so as not to upset my parents, I ventured the path
and </B>
<P><B>found myself almost home, no more than 3 miles away when all of a sudden,
</B>
<P><B>from the left side of my eye, I saw a glow of light moving towards
the very path </B>
<P><B>my car was on. I remember being surprised, yet unable to make </B>
<P><B>out at first what this was I was seeing. In just a fraction of a second,
this </B>
<P><B>glow revealed itself to be a dog. A glowing almost solid shaped white
glowing </B>
<P><B>dog. The glow did not stop at the perameters of the creatures body
outline, but </B>
<P><B>went up some 12 to 20 inches above and all around the dog and a trail
of light </B>
<P><B>followed it and almost lite up the whole area in front of my car. I
</B>
<P><B>can't remember skidding or breaking my car hard, it all happened so
fast, </B>
<P><B>but I do remember not wanting to hit the *dog* but knew instantly I
could not </B>
<P><B>avoid doing so due to its path and the timing involved, it was
inevitable..I </B>
<P><B>was going to hit it. Just in the moment of conscious awareness that
my car </B>
<P><B>and the dog were on a head on collision course, the moment of impact
</B>
<P><B>occured! Much to my utter amazment, No sounds...no </B>
<P><B>thud........no cries of agony came out of my ghost dog.......my car
</B>
<P><B>glided right through this creature as if it wasn't really there. I
know had </B>
<P><B>this dog been a live dog....I would have certainly destroyed it for
I hit </B>
<P><B>it sideways while it was directly in front of my car.....it would not
have been </B>
<P><B>able to run to the side safely for it was directly ahead of me and
I saw and </B>
<P><B>watched as my car speed right through it............Stunned but to
afraid to stop, I drove </B>
<P><B>home quickly the rest of the way frightened beyond my mere ability
to express </B>
<P><B>it. I dont tell many people this storyfor I realise it is </B>
<P><B>indeed strange and I have no need to convince people of my absolute
belief that </B>
<P><B>I hit a ghost dog.  In closing....I might add.......in the corner of
</B>
<P><B>my mind where I keep this memory...l am aware it was a colli and also
that it </B>
<P><B>turned and looked at me as I speed on down the road. I feel the dog
was </B>
<P><B>concerned for my safety and had to make sure I was ok. I remember thinking
</B>
<P><B>it was a very sweet spirit on its way very quickly to his destination
when we </B>
<P><B>collided.........I hope I didnt slow him down to much!well thats it,
that is my </B>
<P><B>storyand like I said before.....for some reason after </B>
<P><B>all these years... I still think of this experience and know it happened
and it </B>
<P><B>was real....and I still shake my head in amazement.</B>

<P>
<P><B>When I was about 18 years old, my grandfather - who had suffered from
diabetes</B>
<P><B>almost his entire life - was admitted to the hospital.  He was suffering
from</B>
<P><B>gangreen that came about due to an open sore he incured on his right
leg I</B>
<P><B>believe.  Anyway, soon after my family learned that he was going to
have to</B>
<P><B>have his leg amputated but, as if that isn't tragic enough for a person
to</B>
<P><B>suffer...that should be the worst of it and recovery wasn't supposed
to have</B>
<P><B>been a problem.  The day of the amputation I remember being very solemn
and I</B>
<P><B>came home from my morning classes, louged around for a while then took
a nap</B>
<P><B>on the couch.  While I was sleeping, I distinctly remember feeling
someone - a</B>
<P><B>male - putting their hand on my shoulder...I FELT it...and telling
me "don't</B>
<P><B>worry...everything's going to be ok", and then he repeated "everything's
going</B>
<P><B>to be ok".  The voice was very familiar but had a certain appeasing
quality to</B>
<P><B>it which was not at all what I had been accustomed due to the circumstances
at</B>
<P><B>hand.  I distinctly remember waking up and looking at the clock.  I
noted the</B>
<P><B>time to be 3:15 pm.  Naturally I assumed that the person who had placed
their</B>
<P><B>hand on my shoulder had been either my brother or my father.  I soon
learned</B>
<P><B>that it was neither.  Later that night my grandfather passed away.
 I don't</B>
<P><B>know if it was coincidence or not but the time of death was noted at
3:15 am.</B>
<P><B>I was never frightened by what happened, obviously at first because
I wasn't</B>
<P><B>completely aware...but even after I learned......I've never been anything
but</B>
<P><B>comforted by the fact that my grandfather chose to stop and tell me
goodbye.</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I have read many of the</B>
<P><B>experiences that have been posted here and feel that this experience
can</B>
<P><B>find it's own place on this site.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was baptized Catholic, brought up Protestant and claim no religion.</B>
<P><B>My mother wanted me to be a priest but, to her disappointment I</B>
<P><B>questioned everything.  Often we argued and to her dismay I never
became</B>
<P><B>a priest.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In Viet Nam I had many close calls.  It was like I had a Guardian
Angel.</B>
<P><B>In 1972 President Nixon promised to end the war with "Honor".  We
were</B>
<P><B>getting our butts kicked. One day after a mission, I was called to
the</B>
<P><B>"Orderly Room"  and told that I was supposed to be out of the ARMY,
 two</B>
<P><B>weeks ago.  Nineteen hours later I was on the streets (A CIVILIAN!).
 I</B>
<P><B>was "plucked" out in the middle of combat and sent home with 72,000</B>
<P><B>troops.  I was a "Space Cadet" ( NO WAR STORIES).  During this time
I</B>
<P><B>had  lost several friends that were still in the war.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had trouble locating my family (my mom had bought a new home and
the</B>
<P><B>mail was slow to find me).  They were unprepared for me so I slept
on</B>
<P><B>the living room couch.  The living room was lighted by a street light</B>
<P><B>that shown brightly through the bay window.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My  Story:</B>
<P><B>I was awaken by something or someone shaking me violently.  I opened
my</B>
<P><B>eyes and the whole room was shaking from side to side and I was
covered</B>
<P><B>in a dark shroud.  I felt the presence of pure evil, I was right in
the</B>
<P><B>middle of it.  I could see the street light shinning through the the</B>
<P><B>window, the room was vibrating violently.  I could feel this evil
trying</B>
<P><B>to to overcome me.  I struggled to get to get to my feet and get to
the</B>
<P><B>hallway door ( I don't know why, I just knew I had to get to the</B>
<P><B>hallway). The closer I tried to get to the door the farther away it</B>
<P><B>got.  I was caught in the grasp of the evil, I was losing the battle.
 I</B>
<P><B>said, "God,  please help me!"  All of a sudden the door was right at
my</B>
<P><B>face, the room still shaking.  I opened the door and I saw a
silhouette</B>
<P><B>that I can only describe as "Cousin IT" from the Adams' Family.  It
put</B>
<P><B>its arms around me and started walking me backwards towards the
couch.</B>
<P><B>I could feel it's long thick hair, my arms were around a solid object</B>
<P><B>and all the time it was walking me backwards it   whispered in my
ear,</B>
<P><B>"Everything is all right."  It walked me backwards, laid me down on
the</B>
<P><B>couch and kissed me.  I opened my eyes, the room was still shaking
and</B>
<P><B>then it suddenly stopped.  A very strong feeling of peace suddenly</B>
<P><B>overcame me.  I have never felt this nor the evil again.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Location:  Opelousas, Louisiana</B>
<P><B>I have always been fascinated by paranormal activity.  I can remember
as a small child </B>
<P><B>breathlessly pouring through books about ghosts, hauntings, and the
paranormal.  Although</B>
<P><B> I cannot recall what the first book I read on the subject was, I can
remember being totally</B>
<P><B> enraptured exploring the subject.  I quickly exhausted my little
elementary school's resources,</B>
<P><B> although I sometimes read the books on paranormal activity over and
over and over again.</B>
<P><B>  As I grew older, my interest did not lessen and my own personal library
was becoming quite</B>
<P><B> large with books  both factual and fiction.  I began to entertain
the thought of becoming a</B>
<P><B> parapsychologist (although not very seriously) and would read late
into the night - sometimes</B>
<P><B> scaring myself silly.  If I fell asleep reading one of these
"trash" books (as they were called</B>
<P><B> by my mother and grandmother) I would wake to the inevitable lecture
on filling my mind with</B>
<P><B> such inappropriate things.  Still, my interest did not lessen.  I
did, however, never consider</B>
<P><B> that I myself would become a "victim" of  such activity.  The house
I lived in was fairly new.</B>
<P><B>  No one close to me had died in the near vacinity of my home.  We
were religious people ( devout</B>
<P><B> Roman Catholics - things like this always happen to us) and ghosts
seemed to me reserved for the</B>
<P><B> attics of old Civil War plantations or abandoned cemeteries.  Even
so, I was sure (from reading</B>
<P><B>  and watching such books and movies) that I would move directly out
of any house that showed</B>
<P><B> any sign of being "haunted".  I believed this until the summer of
1990 when my attitude became</B>
<P><B> subject to severe change.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To my shock and horror, my mother died suddenly on June 19, 1990, a
week before her 40th</B>
<P><B> birthday.  In an instant my whole life changed.  Coupled with the
horrible grief I was </B>
<P><B>experiencing at losing my mother  my family structure was also changing.
 Within that same</B>
<P><B> week my sister moved in with my maternal grandparents next door (they
had always been </B>
<P><B>guardian angels to she and I).  My step-father immediately rented an
apartment and moved </B>
<P><B>out of our home to further himself from the pain of losing his wife.
 I was left alone in </B>
<P><B>the house - by my own choice of course but alone all the same.  Although
my grandparents</B>
<P><B> lived only a few hundred yards from my front door, they seemed a million
miles away when </B>
<P><B>I walked into my empty house at night.  My world had fallen around
me.  In the two years</B>
<P><B> before my mother's death, she and my grandmother both developed cancer
and my mother</B>
<P><B> subsequently had a severe mental breakdown from which she never recovered
- topping off</B>
<P><B> her lifetime filled with broken marriages, marital abuse, and mental
illness  and she </B>
<P><B>finally died from - of all things - heat stroke.  My life was now such
that  I had just</B>
<P><B> graduated high school, lost my mother, began college, was living alone,
and was dealing</B>
<P><B> with some aspects of my sexuality that I had ignored my entire life.
 Needless to say, </B>
<P><B>I was a bundle of nerves, grief, and stress.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The first event in my house happened two weeks after my mother's funeral.
 An old friend of </B>
<P><B>mine (We'll call him Mike) and I were reunited by my mother's death
after nearly two years </B>
<P><B>of not speaking to each other.   The only light in the pit of blackness
I felt I was living </B>
<P><B>in, I kept Mike in very close contact.  It was not rare for him to
stay over in my sister's </B>
<P><B>old bedroom after a night of talking, crying, and catching up on the
time we had spent away </B>
<P><B>from each other.  One Sunday morning, Mike paid a visit to me after
going to church (Mike was</B>
<P><B> devoutly religious) He was accompanied by a friend named Kyle, whom
I had met only once before.</B>
<P><B>  We began talking and laughing, and ended up listening to some old
comedy albums on the stereo </B>
<P><B>in my bedroom.  Seemed like a great morning.  Since we were listening
to the recordings we were</B>
<P><B> all pretty quiet, so I was quite shocked when Mike looked up at me
and said "Well, aren't you</B>
<P><B> going to see what she wants?".  </B>
<P><B>"What are you talking about?" I asked, confused.</B>
<P><B>"Your grandmother is in the living room.  She just called for you."
 I immediately got up from</B>
<P><B> where I was sitting and went into the living room of my house.  It
was not strange to me that</B>
<P><B> my grandmother would have been in my house unannounced since she lived
right next door and was</B>
<P><B> accustomed to just popping over at any given time.  I was quite suprised
when I found no one</B>
<P><B> there.  I checked the entire house, calling my grandmother's name,
and then went back into my</B>
<P><B> bedroom with an odd look on my face and explained to both Mike and
Kyle that there was </B>
<P><B>absolutely no one other than the three of us in the house.  Mike protested,
claiming that he</B>
<P><B> heard her calling my name repeatedly.  Problem solving to the best
of my ability I turned and</B>
<P><B> went to the phone to call my grandmother.  She immediately answered
her phone.  She denied</B>
<P><B> being in my house and had just come in from mowing her lawn.  I explained
the situation to her,</B>
<P><B> and she laughed it off saying that the voice Mike heard must have
come from our neighbor's </B>
<P><B>home (which, incidentally, was a good 500 yards away) or that we had
had a little too much </B>
<P><B>to drink the night before.  After more discussion and realizing that
she would be of no help</B>
<P><B> to me I ended the conversation.  I was more confused than ever, but
not really bothered by </B>
<P><B>the situation.  I went back to my bedroom to give the guys an update
on my conversation. </B>
<P><B> Mike immediately went pale and said "There was somebody in this house.
 There was a voice.</B>
<P><B>  It was calling your name.  It was a woman.  Therefore it was either
your grandmother, your</B>
<P><B> sister (who was in New Orleans at the time), or your mother (he said
this rather jokingly).</B>
<P><B> So I suggest we search your house".</B>
<P><B>"I've already looked and there is no one here!"  I protested.</B>
<P><B>Kyle finally piped up.  "I don't know you very well, but I know what
I just heard.  There was </B>
<P><B>a woman in this house and she was calling your name.  I still can't
get over the fact that you</B>
<P><B> didn't hear it because it was very loud and came from the vicinity
of your living room, so if</B>
<P><B>  you guys are playing some joke on me, its becoming increasingly
unfunny."</B>
<P><B>Hoping to ease the situation I replied "Look, it must have come from
the neighbors.  So lets </B>
<P><B>all forget about it.  No harm done".   Mike looked very nervous and
scared, stated again that</B>
<P><B> he definitely heard the voice, and that it came from inside of the
house - not from neighbors</B>
<P><B> a good distance away.  Kyle was extremely nervous and expressed his
desire to leave.  After </B>
<P><B>some further discussion and my trying to calm everyone's nerves, Mike
and Kyle left my house</B>
<P><B>and I went back to my everyday activities without giving it much further
thought until two </B>
<P><B>Sundays  later.      </B>
<P>
<P><B>It was afternoon and I was on the phone with a good friend named Karen.
 I was sitting in my</B>
<P><B> recliner located in the living room, clothed in only my underwear
(a privilege granted by the</B>
<P><B> fact that I now lived alone) and was chatting away quite happily about
a party we were planning</B>
<P><B> at my house for the following Saturday.  All of a sudden I heard a
 woman's voice saying </B>
<P><B>something  from the adjoining kitchen.  I was so suprised that I
didn't pay much attention </B>
<P><B>to what was being said.  I was more concerned with having no clothes
on.  I immediately dropped</B>
<P><B> the phone, lept out of my chair, and grabbed a large T-shirt that
I had left draped over the</B>
<P><B> furniture.  As I was doing this  I said, "Who's there".  There was
no answer.  I walked in to</B>
<P><B> my kitchen and no one was there.  The kitchen door was still latched
and my house was silent.</B>
<P><B>  My grandparents were away for the afternoon visiting relatives. 
My sister was with them. </B>
<P><B> Feeling pretty spooked, I went back to the phone and said "You will
never believe what just</B>
<P><B> happened"</B>
<P><B>"Who's there?" Karen asked."No one" I replied.  "There isn't anyone
here".</B>
<P><B>"I just heard a woman talking to you" she said.</B>
<P><B>Feeling a little relieved that I was not going losing my mind, I told
her that I had heard</B>
<P><B> it too.  I asked her if she heard what was said but she could only
say that it sounded like</B>
<P><B> my mother or my grandmother (their voice inflections were very similar).
 "My grandmother is</B>
<P><B> gone, Karen.  There's nobody in the house but me."  Karen then gave
me the best advice</B>
<P><B> I could think of at the time .  She said "Get out of the
house".</B>
<P><B>I immediately hung up the phone and did so as quickly as possible.
  I was very afraid.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I stayed at my grandparents that whole afternoon.  I thought that I
might be having a mental</B>
<P><B> breakdown myself.  Yet Karen's hearing the voice ruled that one out.
 Perhaps it was the</B>
<P><B> neighbors, but they really were too far away.  I knew that the voice
came from my kitchen</B>
<P><B> and, yes, it sounded like my mother or grandmother.  Both choices
were included in the realm</B>
<P><B> of impossibility.  I was too scared to go back home and did not know
what I would do.  So I</B>
<P><B> waited...</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandparents returned at 5:00 PM that evening, and they were immediately
confronted by a</B>
<P><B> seemingly irrational grandson.  I told them about the situation. 
My grandfather, a gentle man</B>
<P><B> who was badly affected by my mother's death, listened up to the part
where I said it sounded</B>
<P><B> like my mother's s voice.  He then became uncharacteristically angry
and yelled at me, </B>
<P><B>insisting that I "get my butt home and be sure to never talk about
this again".  My grandmother</B>
<P><B> said nothing.  I begrudgly went back home.  I cautiously walked in
and for a while was too </B>
<P><B>scared to make a sound, still trying to piece together in my mind what
had happened and looking</B>
<P><B> for a viable explanation.  At one point, I opened all of the windows
and drapes, turned on the</B>
<P><B> television, and tried to make things as cheery as possible in the
house.  After all, it was my </B>
<P><B>house.  I helped a little, but I slept with the light on  for the next
few nights.</B>
<P><B>	Karen told a good number of people about the incident, so by the time
the party rolled</B>
<P><B> around that Saturday everyone was interested in my ghost whom everyone
was calling "George" </B>
<P><B>(I don't know why the male name; it was a female voice we had heard).
 At one point Karen and</B>
<P><B> Mike were retelling their stories to the group of 15 (who were all
sleeping over, incidentally).</B>
<P><B>  One girl Maria, who was feeling particularly spooked, got up and
said "I am going to the </B>
<P><B>restroom.  When I come back I want all of this nonsense stopped.  I
will not stay in a house</B>
<P><B> I cannot sleep in".  She then said to the ceiling "And George, I will
not let you ruin a </B>
<P><B>perfectly good party.  Keep yourself hidden".  She then walked away
from the group and down </B>
<P><B>the hall to the bathroom.  Just as she crossed under the attic door
, it fell open and hit </B>
<P><B>her in the back of the head knocking her to the ground.  She screamed
and we all went to her</B>
<P><B> assistance.  The attic door was one of the kind which had springs
to hold it up flush against</B>
<P><B> the ceiling and a ladder that folded out from it for easy access into
the attic.  A few years</B>
<P><B> previously one of the springs had broken and the attic door hung ajar
from the ceiling.  To </B>
<P><B>remedy this, my stepfather had put a nail in the ceiling and  bent
it back to hold the attic </B>
<P><B>door in place.  After seeing that Maria was all right, I began to fold
the ladder back up and</B>
<P><B> the lift the door to the ceiling explaining to everyone that the door
spring were broken and</B>
<P><B> that the nail had simply slipped.  The door would not go up entirely,
though; the nail was </B>
<P><B>still in its place and had not been moved.  No one slept over that
night.  Karen was nice enough</B>
<P><B> to help me clean up and was looking very apologetic for the nights
events.  I kept rambling </B>
<P><B>there being a reasonable explanation for all this.  At one point, Karen
suggested something. </B>
<P><B> "I think you should move" she said.  "Don't be silly" I responded.
 "This is my house".  At</B>
<P><B> that moment my stereo began blaring at a deafening volume.  We looked
at each other and walked</B>
<P><B> over to the stereo together.  I tried turning it off but it wouldn't
respond.  I then who</B>
<P><B> looked up a Karen who was holding the cord in her hands.  It was
unplugged.  I grabbed it </B>
<P><B>from her.  I looked at the cord and back to the stereo over and over,
not comprehending how</B>
<P><B> this could be happening.  then it just stopped.  I grabbed some things
and slept at Karen's</B>
<P><B> house that night.</B>
<P><B>	The next few weeks were relatively quiet.  I came home to an overflowing
bathtub one </B>
<P><B>night, and the lights were flashing occasionally, but nothing extremely
weird.  I was working</B>
<P><B> at night while going to school, and came home pretty tired usually.
 One of these nights I </B>
<P><B>came home exhausted and hungry, taking only enough time to fix myself
a sandwich.  I ate it </B>
<P><B>and went to bed.  When I walked in to my kitchen the next morning,
I was quite shocked to find</B>
<P><B> the entire room covered with at least an inch of small, white Styrofoam
beads, the kind which</B>
<P><B>stuffed animals are stuffed with.  I stood and stared at the floor
for what must have been a half</B>
<P><B>  hour.  The door was locked.  No one had been able to get inside.
 At some point I called my </B>
<P><B>grandmother and asked her to come over to the house without telling
her what had happened.  </B>
<P><B>Sensing that it was important, she came over right away.  She was very
confused to see me </B>
<P><B>standing in the middle of Styrofoam pellets.  I told her that I wanted
her to see this for </B>
<P><B>herself and began to explain to her what happened.  She resisted, as
I expected, claiming that</B>
<P><B> I was sleepwalking and had done this myself.  I thought about this
for a moment, but then </B>
<P><B>realized that we had no stuffed animals for me to rip apart in my sleep.
 My sister and I had</B>
<P><B> thrown them away years ago.  Where were the casings.  Why was it only
in the kitchen.  How </B>
<P><B>could even 20 stuffed animals produce as much stuffing as was on the
floor.  She had no answer</B>
<P><B> and we cleaned it up silently.  The next day, I had all of the locks
to my house changed (I </B>
<P><B>possessed the only key), locked all of the windows and taped hairs
across them to make sure </B>
<P><B>that they remained unopened.   I vowed to face my problem with a  new
resolve; I was going to</B>
<P><B> figure out whatever was going on.  I was determined that there was
a rational explanation for</B>
<P><B> these incidents (quite strange for me, considering my fascination
with the paranormal).  In </B>
<P><B>retrospect  I realize that the more I tried to ignore what was happeneing
and to explain it </B>
<P><B>away , the more things happened.  </B>
<P><B>	  It was about this time that all hell broke loose.  It would be
impossible for me to </B>
<P><B>recount every incident that happened over the next year.  Lights flashed,
doors opened and </B>
<P><B>slammed closed.  My stereo, which now was perpetually unplugged, would
take the notion to turn </B>
<P><B>itself on every now and then.  I heard whispering and laughter.  I
would find knickknacks moved</B>
<P><B> around the house.  A few pieces of jewelry showed up out of nowhere.
 I could set something </B>
<P><B>down, turn around for two seconds, and it would vanish (like the expensive
fountain pen I </B>
<P><B>received as a gift from a college friend; I still have never found
it).  I went through 17 </B>
<P><B>answering machines in 1 year, since they all seemed to malfunction,
four of them catching on </B>
<P><B>fire.  I would come home from school or work and find that picture
frames had broken and glass</B>
<P><B> scattered all over the house.  I had a collection of Chinese corkwood
creations enclosed in </B>
<P><B>glass globes on my entertainment center.  There were about 10 of them.
 Over the course of a </B>
<P><B>month  they became smashed, one every few nights, with none of the
others being touched. </B>
<P><B> There is no doubt in my mind that no one was able to get into the
house.  Still, the TV </B>
<P><B>turned on in the middle of the night.  Lightbulbs exploded for no reason,
even when they </B>
<P><B>were not turned on.  My clothes would be mysteriously spread on the
floor of my entire house </B>
<P><B>still on the hangers.  The rocking chair would rock on its own.  The
phone would ring incessantly</B>
<P><B> with no one on the other line.   I had an audio cassette tape of music
I had recorded; at the</B>
<P><B> very beginning of this tape is jarbled language (which also sounds
like speech played backwards)</B>
<P><B>  which says very clearly  "(my name) I can't get out of your
stomach!".   I can guarantee that no</B>
<P><B> one was around when this tape was being recorded.   It is the scariest
thing I have every heard,</B>
<P><B> and I still have it to this day (I have only recently thought of sending
it in for analysis). </B>
<P><B> Event after event occurred, and still I was not convinced that my
house was "haunted".   </B>
<P><B>My friends were sure that it was.  When I look back I am extremely
happy that so many of the</B>
<P><B> events that occurred happened in full of view of sometimes more than
one person.  I have had to call</B>
<P><B> on them many times to verify events.  In fact, most of the
"big" stuff happened when I was not alone.</B>
<P><B>    I can only imagine how strange it must have been for them to see
me remain so calm and say "There </B>
<P><B>has got to be  a rational explanation" when books were falling to the
floor right in front of us or</B>
<P><B> doors were slamming as we spoke.  Needless to say, my friends slowly
stopped coming by.</B>
<P><B>	Mike did not stop coming over, although he spent many restless nights
in the house.</B>
<P><B>  He once woke me in the middle of the night insisting that someone
had opened the bedroom door,</B>
<P><B> crossed the room and went into the closet.  Upon inspection, the closet
door was indeed</B>
<P><B> standing ajar.  Mike slept with a rosary that night.  He also decided
to give me a cat whom</B>
<P><B> I named Phyllis.  Phyllis was a pretty tabby/Persian mix who was as
yellow as sunshine.  She</B>
<P><B> was very affectionate and loving.  But she too, knew something was
amis.  Many times Phyllis</B>
<P><B> would hiss at the wall, or arch her back at an empty doorway.  She
would track empty air with</B>
<P><B> her eyes.  I still remained unconvinced, until the day Phyllis nearly
died.  </B>
<P><B>	I was sitting in my recliner reading a book when I heard this strange
noise.  I looked</B>
<P><B> up to see Phyllis being pulled across the floor, only nothing was
pulling her.  Whatever it was</B>
<P><B> had her by the neck and was not letting go.  I immediately went to
help her, screaming at</B>
<P><B> whatever it was to "Stop it! Stop it!" and I plucked Phyllis from
the floor (I felt no </B>
<P><B>resistance from anything, however).  She immediately had a full blown
seizure for a few minutes.</B>
<P><B>  I realized that night, holding my cat and crying, that my house was
definitely haunted.</B>
<P><B>	I gave the cat to a friend of mine the next day, hoping that Phyllis
would be in a</B>
<P><B> better environment than the one she had just been.  I also began to
wonder "who" could be </B>
<P><B>haunting my house.  The obvious nomination was my mother.  She died
quickly and was troubled </B>
<P><B>by mental illness beforehand.  Yet she was devoutly religious and was
such a kind, gentle person</B>
<P><B> - even in her times of sickness.  It hurt me to entertain the thought
that she had not gone on </B>
<P><B>to her heaven after the hard life she had led and was not at rest.
 Rather sheepishly, I spoke to</B>
<P><B> our local priest and to my relief he agreed to bless my house.  I
spoke to him about the </B>
<P><B>possibilities of a haunting and that I was concerned that my mother
was not at rest.  It did </B>
<P><B>help somewhat when he, having known my mother personally, had no doubts
that my mother was now </B>
<P><B>in peace.  He assured me that everything would be fine.  I still was
not convinced that the </B>
<P><B>spirit in my house wasn't my mother.  After all, it was her voice we
had all heard in the </B>
<P><B>beginning.   This thought bothered me for a few days until I had a
dream.  In the dream, my</B>
<P><B> mother was sitting on my living room sofa.  I walked into the room,
saw her sitting there </B>
<P><B>and thought "Doesn't she know that she's dead and not supposed to be
here?"  In the dream,</B>
<P><B> I immediately picked up the phone to call my grandmother, and while
I was explaining to her</B>
<P><B> that Mom was sitting on the couch when she was supposed to be dead,
my mother spoke up.  </B>
<P><B>"Son, please don't worry.  I have gone on but I am so happy.  So let
go of me and stop grieving.</B>
<P><B>  I love you.  Don't worry about me".  Then I woke up, with tears on
my face.  My lights </B>
<P><B>immediately began flashing off and on.  I didn't know what was doing
it, but I was certain </B>
<P><B>that it was not my mother.  </B>
<P><B>	My friend Raphael had become especially assaulted at about this point.
 Glass items</B>
<P><B> would break near him, objects hit him in the back of the head when
in the house, and his car</B>
<P><B> keys would always disappear regardless of the fact that they did not
leave his pocket to turn</B>
<P><B> up hours later in the toilet bowl, in the  kitchen sink, or in an
empty closet.  He was fairly</B>
<P><B> squeamish and our good friendship was becoming an inadequate reason
to go into my house.  The</B>
<P><B> deciding factor for him was the night the living room light fixture
and ceiling fan came </B>
<P><B>crashing down on his head as he stood below it.  He vowed never to
enter it again, and from </B>
<P><B>then on we talked outside.  </B>
<P><B>	I only got him into the house one more time, and that was the night
I decided I had</B>
<P><B> to move out.  We had decided to go out to a local nightclub.  I was
at work into the evening</B>
<P><B>  and he was going to pick me up there.  I had to shower and change
clothes.  He had suspected</B>
<P><B> this and brought his brother along with us so that he would not have
to be alone  while I </B>
<P><B>showered and changed since it was bitterly cold and he did not want
to stand outside.  </B>
<P><B>We arrived at my house and I hurried to the shower as to not make them
uncomfortable.  </B>
<P><B>Raphael and his brother, William, remained in my living room, talking.
 After showering, </B>
<P><B>I stood in my bathroom mirror to shave.  I put the shaving cream all
over my face and began</B>
<P><B> my task, setting the shaving cream can near the mirror on the other
side of the lavatory.  </B>
<P><B>As I was looking into the mirror, the shaving cream can slammed into
my chest with incredible</B>
<P><B> force.  I looked down in amazement and suprise, trying hard to find
a rational explanation for</B>
<P><B> this and remembering how terrified Raphael would be if he knew what
had just happened.  </B>
<P><B>I looked at the red mark on my chest and became very scared being alone
in the bathroom. </B>
<P><B> I wrapped a towel around myself and went into the front room.  As
soon as I entered, with only</B>
<P><B> half of my face shaven, Raphael looked at me and said "What
happened!?".  I told them what</B>
<P><B> I had just experienced and asked one of them to come with me while
I finished shaving.  Raphael</B>
<P><B> would hear none of it.  "There is no way I'm going in there with
you" he said.  William, who </B>
<P><B>thought all the stories he heard were a crock, laughed saying that
he would stand there while I</B>
<P><B> finished.  Raphael changed his mind quickly when he saw that he would
be alone in the living </B>
<P><B>room and followed suit to the bathroom with his brother and I.</B>
<P><B>	Once there I finished shaving with no incident.  I decided to then
dry my hair since it </B>
<P><B>was still wet (much to Raphaels dismay - he wanted to leave so badly).
 I wasn't talking much.  </B>
<P><B>I was suprised that the entity had been malicious toward me.  That
had never happened before.  </B>
<P><B>I had decided much earlier that if I would begin to see it (which never
happened) or if it hurt</B>
<P><B> me I would move immediately.  I was now faced with moving out of my
house.  Just then, all </B>
<P><B>three of us watched a hair spray can lift off of the counter.  It stayed
steady, just hanging </B>
<P><B>in the air for a moment, and then it threw itself through the air toward
Raphael's head.  He </B>
<P><B>ducked just in time, and there was  a huge dent in the door from where
the can struck it.  I </B>
<P><B>knew I would have to leave.  It had won.  I couldn't take anymore.</B>
<P><B>	I decided to move in with some friends in a neighboring town.  My
grandparents could not</B>
<P><B> understand why I wanted to move so badly, and I couldn't tell my
grandfather the whole story. </B>
<P><B> My grandmother, whom I did tell, just couldn't let herself believe
me.  I began to pack.  </B>
<P><B>During the packing process, everything seemed calm, as if it wanted
to make me feel foolish </B>
<P><B>for moving or as if nothing had ever happened there.  As I was packing,
I kept searching for</B>
<P><B> items which It had taken from me during the year but I never found
any.  And all was quiet.</B>
<P><B>	I eventually packed up everything but my living room furniture, consisting
of a </B>
<P><B>humongous old-time leather sofa (9 feet long and incredibly heavy -
two people could barely</B>
<P><B> move it), a recliner, a leather love seat, and a gigantic entertainment
center with television,</B>
<P><B> VCR, knickknacks and dust still on it.  In order to move these items,
and all the boxes I had</B>
<P><B> packed previously, my new roommates Darrin and Jason and their friend
Earl came over to spend</B>
<P><B> the night.  I had rented a couple of movies and we had pizza.  We
were planning to get up early</B>
<P><B> the next morning and move these items and disassemble my king-sized
waterbed.  With no other</B>
<P><B> furniture in the house, we all piled into my waterbed and slept there.
 I was nearest the door.</B>
<P><B>  Now, I had become an extremely light sleeper, as you can imagine.
 The slightest sound woke </B>
<P><B>me, not to mention a light coming on in the middle of the night.  My
bed was  the full-motion </B>
<P><B>type, so  movement made by anyone immediately woke me from sleep. 
I slept nearest the door to</B>
<P><B> the living room.  All seemed well.</B>
<P><B>	The next morning I woke before anyone else.  I planned on cooking
everyone a big</B>
<P><B> breakfast and then begin to move things directly after.  I walked
into my living room, </B>
<P><B>still sleepy, and was stunned to find that all of my living room furniture
had been turned </B>
<P><B>around to face the wall.  The huge couch, the recliner, the loveseat,
and the entertainment</B>
<P><B> center with everything on it.  I was infuriated at first, imagining
who could have played </B>
<P><B>such a stupid joke.  I was about to wake everyone when Mike pulled
up at the house.  He </B>
<P><B>walked in to find me staring at the furniture.  After we talked abut
it for some time, we</B>
<P><B> both came to the conclusion that it was a farewell gift from
"George".  No one could have</B>
<P><B> gotten out of my bed; I would have felt the bed moving violently.
 No one could have done </B>
<P><B>such a thing with no light; there were no lights turned on during the
night.  I had not heard </B>
<P><B>a sound coming from the living room.  And that couch, big as it was,
could not have been moved </B>
<P><B>easily, if at all, by one person in the dark in a strange house.  The
entertainment center,</B>
<P><B> loaded with pictures and collectibles, had completely turned itself
around, not a picture or</B>
<P><B> knick-knack was disturbed as evidenced by the undisturbed dust; this
was impossible for any</B>
<P><B> human to do.  I also watched everyone's initial shock as they woke,
one by one, to find what</B>
<P><B> had happened.</B>
<P><B>	We loaded everything that day for the move, and as I went to close
the front door and</B>
<P><B> lock it, I felt a sense of defeat looking at the empty house.  I was
angry and sad to leave </B>
<P><B>my childhood home thinking of all the memories it held for me.
 "Good-bye, you bastard" I said</B>
<P><B> to the empty house.  A bedroom  door slamming shut was the response.</B>
<P><B>	I moved in with my roommates and everything seemed all right for a
few weeks.  </B>
<P><B>Then the lights began flashing on and off as soon as I walked into
the house, and items</B>
<P><B> started to disappear.  Darrin came in from work one evening to find
me sitting on the </B>
<P><B>sofa watching television.  He walked in, set his keys on the bar, and
sat in the chair to</B>
<P><B> ask me what I wanted to do for the evening.  After some discussion
we decided that we would</B>
<P><B> rent movies and watch them at home.  He picked up the keys so we could
drive to the video</B>
<P><B> store and realized that they were not his own.  They were mine.  After
some time searching</B>
<P><B> the house, we found his keys behind a picture in his bedroom, where
neither he or I had gone</B>
<P><B> by that point.  I came home from work the next day to find my new
roommates waiting to talk</B>
<P><B> with me, and they both insisted that I would have to move out if the
events didn't stop.  </B>
<P><B>They did not want a replay of  the events in my house in their own.
 I fully understood.  </B>
<P><B>	I soon attended a lecture at the university I was attending on
parapsychology, and </B>
<P><B>spoke with the speaker about my problem.  She seemed to think that
I did not have a ghost,</B>
<P><B> but a poltergeist.  She said that my emotional stress and the changes
I was going through </B>
<P><B>caused me to emit waves of energy, animating the items in my home and
projected voices in </B>
<P><B>my mind to thin air.  I had a hard time believing her, and sometimes
still do.  I have read</B>
<P><B> up on it more and realize that all of the elements for poltergeist
activity were present </B>
<P><B>in my situation.  I slowly began to take on some stress maintenance
behavior.  The lights </B>
<P><B>stopped flashing soon afterward.  </B>
<P><B>	Many people have lived in the house since I have moved, and in some
way or another</B>
<P><B> I have asked each of them if they have experienced any unusual behavior.
 None of them have,</B>
<P><B> including my sister who lives there with her husband today.  I ask
her about it every time I</B>
<P><B> see her.  I don't feel uncomfortable going in to the house, and it
now represents happiness</B>
<P><B> to me.  It reminds me of the good times in my childhood.   I feel
surely that the incidents</B>
<P><B> which happened were fed by my energy - either by myself directly or
by some spirit running on</B>
<P><B> energy it lost long ago.  </B>
<P><B>	I am now an adult who has accomplished many things.  I am a registered
nursing student,</B>
<P><B> have recently married, and live in the wonderful city of Austin, Texas.
  I hold down a great</B>
<P><B> job with a pharmaceutical company, and seem to make ends meet every
month.  My life is filled</B>
<P><B> with many interests and loving people.  My interest in the paranormal
is stronger now than it</B>
<P><B> has ever been, and  I now seriously consider a retirement career in
parapsychology.  The subject</B>
<P><B> can enrapture me as it always has.  I still, however, stop and wonder
anytime I hear a strange</B>
<P><B> noise or am missing an item I just had in my hands if I am being plagued
again.  And I still</B>
<P><B> look back in wonder at how I stayed as long as I did.  But I know
deep inside that "George" </B>
<P><B>is gone and won't be back.  Hopefully.        </B>

</H3><P><B>BY: ZOG357@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, I was surfin the net and came across your page, and I found it
very</B>
<P><B>interesting. It started to make me look back at some of my own experiences
to</B>
<P><B>determine whether or not it was related to the supernatural. Not so
long ago,</B>
<P><B>within the past couple of years to be precise, I would have these
dreams,</B>
<P><B>sometimes they would cause me to awaken during the night, but they
were very</B>
<P><B>strange to say the least. </B>
<P><B>	There would be nights I would go to bed, and have this strange feeling
I was</B>
<P><B>being watched. Naturally, out of instict or security, I would pull
the blanket</B>
<P><B>up sometimes over my head, and sleep that way. There were never any
noises or</B>
<P><B>anything like that, I guess you could say nothing like one would say
a</B>
<P><B>'typical ghostly experience'. Sometime during the night I would be
in a half-</B>
<P><B>sleepy state, and I would feel the blanket that was covering my face
being</B>
<P><B>slowly pulled down toward the foot of my bed. In the state I was in
I couldn't</B>
<P><B>discern whether or not it was being done by my power. The only thing
is this</B>
<P><B>would happen only once during the night, and would not reoccur once
I regained</B>
<P><B>my faculties and awareness during the night. Where it really gets strange
is</B>
<P><B>that sometimes during these experiences, I would feel my neck muscles
contract</B>
<P><B>like I was looking down at my feet, but I would have the sensation
that I was</B>
<P><B>floating. Normally, I was dismissing this as a dream since I really
didn't</B>
<P><B>have the awareness as to whether or not I could prove it did in fact
happen.</B>
<P><B>Until one night I was having this experience and I felt like my face
was</B>
<P><B>touching the ceiling because I felt the condensation of my breath against
the</B>
<P><B>cold ceiling which formed a little condensation, and that night, right
after</B>
<P><B>this occurrence, my mother yelled up from downstairs, "What are you
doing up</B>
<P><B>there??". That's when I knew something was really happening.</B>
<P><B>	I've since moved away from there, my parents still live there, but
nobody</B>
<P><B>ever discusses things of that nature.  I've been reading about ghosts
since I</B>
<P><B>could remember, and in the instance skepticism had pretty much dismissed
any</B>
<P><B>other explanation for the reasons of my experiences. For a while in
high</B>
<P><B>school even I was kind of obsessed with the supernatural, I wanted
to know all</B>
<P><B>there was about it, and I read a great deal. Even now, I become engrossed
in</B>
<P><B>documentaries and any recent publications that come out with hard evidence
on</B>
<P><B>the subject. I guess now, what I'm trying to determine is how I can
gather</B>
<P><B>hard evidence on my parents house to see if there is something supernatural
is</B>
<P><B>occupying it, and by learning this I would like to investigate other
places in</B>
<P><B>my hometown area which has a great deal of large Victorian mansions.</B>
<P><B>Thanks for reading,</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=death>Life After Death</A></B>
</H3><P><B>BY:Nannyspage@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>   My grandfather and I used to argue about life after death.  I
always</B>
<P><B>said that once you are dead that is it.  I believed in a life after
but</B>
<P><B>I liked to hear him argue about it.  He was a devout Catholic and
said</B>
<P><B>that when he died he would come back and let me know that there was
a</B>
<P><B>life after death.  He died of Cancer on 1979.  My grandmother died
just</B>
<P><B>a very few months before he did.  He was in a rest home and called
my</B>
<P><B>mother and his daughter to come to the home right away.  When they
went</B>
<P><B>he said he was going Home.  They told him that he couldn't.  He said
he</B>
<P><B>was because my grandmother had come for him she had sat in the chair</B>
<P><B>beside his bed and had all those sparkly things in her hair is the
was</B>
<P><B>he put it.  He said she had gone ahead of him and made things ready
for</B>
<P><B>him like she always had.</B>
<P><B>   Shortly after that I moved into his house.  He had a big work shop</B>
<P><B>close to the house where he would go to build things.  He also had
lawn</B>
<P><B>chairs in the back yard where he sat every night before it got dark.</B>
<P><B>Every time I went into that work shop I could smell His pipe
tobacco..</B>
<P><B>It was his own blend because he mixed it himself.  It had a smell
that</B>
<P><B>was not consistent with any other tobacco.  At first I thought it was</B>
<P><B>just because I was used to it and the smell had lingered in his shop</B>
<P><B>after he died.  Then one night I was sitting in the lawn chairs and
the</B>
<P><B>chair beside me began to rock back and forth like someone was sitting
in</B>
<P><B>it and suddenly I smelled grandpa's pipe very strong.  I knew he was</B>
<P><B>telling me that there was life after we leave this one.  Until I
moved</B>
<P><B>from his house I always felt comforted and calm as though he was
always</B>
<P><B>there watching over me. </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=in>A Haunting in Vietnam</A></B>
</H3><P><B>BY: mccam@thegateway.net</B>
<P>
<P><B> A long time ago now, in 1970, a person, </B>
<P><B>we will say a friend of mine, served and suffered with the army in
Vietnam. Now, </B>
<P><B>Vietnam is a land of ghosts. Many different kinds of ghosts. Ghosts
fit well in </B>
<P><B>Vietnam.</B>
<P><B>While there is no good time to have a war, there are especially bad
times...</B>
<P><B>and one of these is during the monsoon season in Southeast Asia. </B>
<P><B>Air support is largely grounded, rivers flood, roads </B>
<P><B>dissolve and the jungle steams and drips. But the enemy went on and
so did those </B>
<P><B>that fought him. </B>&nbsp;<B>Patroling, though limited, was constant.
</B>
<P><B>My friend's unit was tasked with keeping tabs on this old rubber
plantation. </B>
<P><B>Abandoned by it's French planter, it was visited from time to time
by both </B>
<P><B>sides. With long rows of black trunks , the grey light, the dripping
leaves ; it </B>
<P><B>was a place you could see anything.</B> <B>The patrol had set up an
L shaped ambush </B>
<P><B>along one of the trails that crossed the plantation and were waiting
for sunset. </B>
<P><B>Slowly, in the twilight, figures came into view heading toward their
</B>
<P><B>position. The alarm was passed and weapons readied.</B>
<P><B>The figures resolved into men slumped </B>
<P><B>under helmets, rucksacks and weapons slouching down the trail. As they
got </B>
<P><B>nearer those in the ambush realized that the figures made no sound
as they </B>
<P><B>shuffled through the leaves covering the ground. When nearer still,
to their </B>
<P><B>shock, those waiting realized that could see the trees through the
figures as </B>
<P><B>they passed, even as they smelled the strong scent of French cigarettes.
The </B>
<P><B>figures continued on their way into the dripping dark, timeless
ghosts,</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=actual>Actual Ghost Experience?</A></B>
</H3><P><B>BY: tosades@execpc.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>First, let me begin</B>
<P><B>by telling you that I recently purchased and reside in a victorian
Gothic</B>
<P><B>home that was built in 1885. We know the last name of the family</B>
<P><B>that originally built the house and the names of the family we
purchased</B>
<P><B>it from, but nothing in between. Our family is made up of myself</B>
<P><B>and my husband and our two children, ages 10 and 2. Many "little"</B>
<P><B>things have been happening for a few months. By little I mean things</B>
<P><B>that I can usually find a rational explanation for, i.e.. doors that
open</B>
<P><B>and close by themselves, cold spots, feelings of being touched when
there's</B>
<P><B>no one else around. There was one episode, however, that I truly</B>
<P><B>cannot explain.It happened last November, I can't remember the date,</B>
<P><B>at about ten p.m. My son was staying at my parent's house for the</B>
<P><B>night and my daughter and I were just going to bed. My husband peeked</B>
<P><B>his head in the bedroom door to say that he was going to go outside
and</B>
<P><B>have a cigarette before going to bed. As I talked with my daughter</B>
<P><B>I could hear my husband go out the front door and walk across the
porch</B>
<P><B>to where he usually goes to smoke. My daughter likes me to sing songs</B>
<P><B>with her before we go to sleep, so I was singing "Old Mac Donald"
when</B>
<P><B>I heard a male voice say my name into my ear. It was very clear</B>
<P><B>and not only did I hear it, but I could FEEL it on my ear! As just</B>
<P><B>a natural response, I turned my head toward the sound and
answered"What?"</B>
<P><B>There was no one there.So I just laid there for a while, listening.</B>
<P><B>My daughter even asked what I was doing. Then I heard my husband</B>
<P><B>walk back across the porch and enter the house again. When</B>
<P><B>he came up to say good nite, I didn't tell him about what had just
happened.</B>
<P><B>I wasn't sure at the time what to think! It hasn't happened since</B>
<P><B>then, but I did announce out loud in my room one day that the
"person"</B>
<P><B>should not bother me like that. I have never felt frightened in the</B>
<P><B>house or in my bedroom, where the occurrences happen. The door has</B>
<P><B>just recently started to close by itself again...I plan to</B>
<P><B>use the information found on this web site to investigate the former
owners</B>
<P><B>of the house, any significant incidents, and possibly hunt my
"ghost".</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=living>Ghosts of the Living</A></B>
</H3><P><B>BY: SchaeffM@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B> Shadowlands Page is ever so interesting!  I have had several of</B>
<P><B>the "ghosts of the living" experiences, but when it happened, and I
spoke to</B>
<P><B>my dad later(it's always his voice I hear), there was no particular
crisis, or</B>
<P><B>anything else going on that he could think of.  Maybe he was just thinking
of</B>
<P><B>me?  Who knows........But in every instance, I heard his voice so
clearly,</B>
<P><B>that it startled me.  There is no mistaking his voice for someone else's;
it's</B>
<P><B>very distinctive. </B>
<P><B> The first time this happened was in 1970, early morning, in my apartment
near</B>
<P><B>the university where I was attending college.  Both my parents were
away out</B>
<P><B>of town on my dad's business trip and I was not thinking of either
of them at</B>
<P><B>the time this happened.   I was lying in bed about to get up to get
ready for</B>
<P><B>my class, and listening to the radio.  With absolute clarity, I heard
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen door of my apartment open up, and my dad's voice loudly called
out my</B>
<P><B>mom's name, questioning, and with urgency, as if wondering if she was
in</B>
<P><B>there.  I remember being amazed that they were back so soon from their
trip</B>
<P><B>and called out "I'm in here, Dad, come on in".   I waited a couple
of minutes,</B>
<P><B>thinking maybe he'd gone back downstairs(apt. was the second story
of a</B>
<P><B>house).  Then I got up and went into the kitchen, calling him as I
went,</B>
<P><B>curious to see that the kitchen door was still bolted from the inside,
just as</B>
<P><B>I had left it.  I looked outside; his car was nowhere around, and I
was</B>
<P><B>puzzled that he had done such a thing, and then immediately left! 
 I called</B>
<P><B>their house---no answer; called his office, and was told that both
parents</B>
<P><B>were still out of town and the secretary had just spoken with my dad
in that</B>
<P><B>city a few minutes ago!!</B>
<P><B>This very same thing has happened on  several occasions. Sometimes
Dad's voice</B>
<P><B>is calling my sister's name, sometimes my own, and sometimes my mom's
name</B>
<P><B>again;  but the same sequence of events every time.  This has not happened,
in</B>
<P><B>probably the past 10 years, but I remember each instance as if it
happened</B>
<P><B>yesterday.   </B>
<P><B>During approx. a 6-month period in the early 1980's, something
similar</B>
<P><B>happened at my sister's house (I was not there at the time)when she
and her</B>
<P><B>three children and husband were living in Amarillo, TX.  They had a
large ,</B>
<P><B>newly-built two-story house at the time, and the kids were 15,13, and
8 yrs</B>
<P><B>old then.   On several occasions, when all were at home except my
brother-in-</B>
<P><B>law, and each person was in a different room of the house, they all
clearly</B>
<P><B>heard the front door open and close, and a voice loudly calling the
oldest</B>
<P><B>child's name over and over, and sounding very frantic and agitated.
  All four</B>
<P><B>people in the house heard this very clearly, and each one thought the
voice</B>
<P><B>was one of the other two siblings calling her name.   Everyone ran
downstairs</B>
<P><B>to see what was the matter, and saw no one else around.  Each of the
other two</B>
<P><B>siblings were as puzzled as everyone else as to who it could have been.
  The</B>
<P><B>front door was locked from the inside.  This same thing happened two
or three</B>
<P><B>other times, and has not happened again since.  On two separate
occasions,</B>
<P><B>the family came home from an evening out together and opened up the
back door</B>
<P><B>to find all my brother-in-law's hunting knives plus all sharp kitchen
knives</B>
<P><B>laid out in patterns on the kitchen floor.  There was never any evidence
of</B>
<P><B>criminal entry into the house, and both times the alarm system had
been armed</B>
<P><B>and untouched.</B>
<P><B>I also had a very frightening experience with a haunting  just after
my</B>
<P><B>husband and daughter and I had moved to Virginia in 1989.  That experience
was</B>
<P><B>unrelated to any voices.  If you have an interest, I can also tell
you about</B>
<P><B>that.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=window>What I Saw in the Window</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: bsimpson@cscc.edu</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>This happened to me in early 1995.  I don't know if what I saw can
be classified as a ghost or</B>
<P><B> not...</B>
<P>
<P><B>We were newlyweds living in our first apartment.  Here's the layout
of our place.  We lived in</B>
<P><B> a rather large apartment complex and rented an apartment that was
on the top floor of a three</B>
<P><B> story building.  I'm not sure how old the buildings were...I'd say
they were built in the late</B>
<P><B> 60's or early 70's.   There were no balconies, fire escapes, or other
buildings next to us </B>
<P><B>except a one story house that had been converted to a bar and that
was probably about 80 yards</B>
<P><B> away from our building and was a little down hill from us.   As you
stood at the front door </B>
<P><B>the dining/living room was in front of you with a large picture window
on the opposite wall </B>
<P><B>and the television was just to the left of the window.  The kitchen
was directly to your right</B>
<P><B> with a wall separating the kitchen and the hallway that led to the
bedrooms. I'd say the total</B>
<P><B> depth of the apartment was about 30 feet deep from the front door
to the picture window.</B>
<P><B>Since we were on the third floor and no one could see into our place
I would usually leave </B>
<P><B>the drapes open at night.</B>
<P><B>One night my husband went to the gym to work out.  It was still winter
it was already very</B>
<P><B> dark out.  I was in the kitchen cleaning up and the TV was on in the
living room for noise.</B>
<P><B>  I can't even remember what show was on at the time but it had caught
my attention and I wanted</B>
<P><B> to watch that part of the show.  I was standing close to the kitchen,
about 20 feet away from</B>
<P><B> the window.  For some reason I looked out the window and saw what
I thought was my reflection</B>
<P><B> when I suddenly realized it was NOT!  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I saw a man from the waist up.  He had short dark hair and was wearing
a light-colored sleeveless</B>
<P><B> shirt and he had quite a muscular build.  From his reflection I surmised
he was standing between</B>
<P><B> me and the window and had his back towards me, but I couldn't quite
make out his face.  After </B>
<P><B>staring at him for what seemed to be an eternity he seemed startled,
like he realized I could </B>
<P><B>see him and he turned to his right and walked towards the hall to the
bedrooms.  I could see </B>
<P><B>his reflection as he walked until he got past the window.  Then he
was gone.  As I think about</B>
<P><B> it now he must have been pretty close to the window since I could
see him from the waist up.  </B>
<P><B>That means he was walking towards the wall that separated the living
room from our guest </B>
<P><B>bedroom.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I was frightened...I think my fear was more from the unexpectedness
of the encounter.  I did </B>
<P><B>not feel threatened by him or feel that he was harmful in any way.
 I sat on the couch until </B>
<P><B>my husband came home and hour or so later.  I told him about it and
he thought I was seeing </B>
<P><B>things.  The funny thing is that the man I saw had my husband's short
hair and muscular build </B>
<P><B>and when my husband worked out, he always wore an old grey t-shirt
with the sleeves cut off.  </B>
<P><B>But he was not under duress at any time that night so it wasn't him
trying to contact me.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I've often felt like someone was in the room with me or thought I had
seen someone out of the</B>
<P><B> corner of my eye but have always attributed it to an overactive
imagination.  There have been</B>
<P><B> a few times where I have been in dangerous situations (I'm a very
klutzy person) but have </B>
<P><B>gotten out of them...almost like someone is watching over me, protecting
me.  I sometimes </B>
<P><B>wonder if I saw my guardian angel that night.  I have not had any other
experiences since.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=story>My Parents Story</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: PECARROLL@prodigy.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>	My name is Kat, and I'm 14 years old. I have always been interested
in the</B>
<P><B>paranormal, I just figured there had to be something beyond death
besides</B>
<P><B>Heaven and Hell. It's just such a mystery......it really makes you
think!</B>
<P><B>Anyway, it was so cool to find your web sight....I do have quite a
real</B>
<P><B>story!</B>
<P><B>	Unfortunately, I was not around...I was told this by my parents. And</B>
<P><B>they're not one's to kid around about something like this. They were
newly</B>
<P><B>weds(1980 I believe) and they moved into this old house. The land
lords</B>
<P><B>were very old and "creepy", in their words. It was a two story house
and in</B>
<P><B>one room there was a cold spot...no matter how hot it was the spot
was</B>
<P><B>always cold. So that was the first sign of the possibility of a spirit.
My</B>
<P><B>father claims he would see something going around corners when he went
into</B>
<P><B>a room and both my parents said when they would turn the key to the
front</B>
<P><B>door something scampered up the stairs. My dad was working retail at
the</B>
<P><B>time and would get home late at night, and my mom says the stove
would</B>
<P><B>click when ever he came home.....and only when he came home. They said
that</B>
<P><B>they would come home and see that the magazines were straightened but
no</B>
<P><B>finger prints on the dust. Most people stop me here and say it could
have</B>
<P><B>been their imaginations running wild ..until I told them this next
part. It</B>
<P><B>was one of the first nights they were there. Their bedroom was on the</B>
<P><B>second floor and they were downstairs watching TV They heard a large</B>
<P><B>*THUMP* from their room. They rushed up to find ALL their clothes off
the</B>
<P><B>hangers...even the ones that were pinned on had no rips on them. I'd
say</B>
<P><B>the house was haunted. My dad thinks it was a woman. ( what man would</B>
<P><B>straighten up the house.) He also says he could feel her presence
while</B>
<P><B>going to sleep at night. </B>
<P><B>	I heard the story and was amazed! That happened while they lived in</B>
<P><B>Kansas. My mom got pregnant with me and moved away. They had my brother
six</B>
<P><B>years later and we moved to Florida three years later('93). We lived
in one</B>
<P><B>house an apartment and the house we live in now. This just may be my</B>
<P><B>imagination but......I was home alone and I was taking a shower and
the</B>
<P><B>door opened. I didn't think much of it so I sut it and pulled on it
so it</B>
<P><B>would not open again and right as I was standing there I watched the
door</B>
<P><B>knob turn, the door open all the way and shut right before my eyes.
I told</B>
<P><B>my parents but what could they do. Then it happened again. I was in
my</B>
<P><B>brothers room( home alone) and I was playing sega and talking on the
phone</B>
<P><B>with my friend, John. The door opened a little so I got up and shut
it.</B>
<P><B>Then the same thing happened as in the bathroom three times as I was</B>
<P><B>standing there. I was too scared to move.....John asked me why I kept
on</B>
<P><B>opening and  shutting the door. I told him it wasn't me. He's the only
one</B>
<P><B>who believed me.....I hope you will too!</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>	HI, THERE.  WELL, HERE GOES.</B>
<P><B>	ONBOARD THIS VESSEL, THERE ARE WHAT ARE CALLED "HOLDS", WHICH ARE
VOIDS</B>
<P><B>LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP TO STORE AMMUNITION. WELL, IT IS
THE JOB</B>
<P><B>OF THE GUNNERS' MATES TO STAND WATCHES ON THIS PART OF THE SHIP WHILE
IT IS</B>
<P><B>OUT TO SEA, SO YOU COULD IMAGINE HOW CREEPY IT SHOULD GET DOWN THERE
IN THE</B>
<P><B>MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I COULD SENSE THIS MYSELF, HAVING STOOD VERY
LATE</B>
<P><B>WATCHES IN MY OWN WORKSPACE AND THEN TRAVELING DOWN ABOUT 3-4 LEVELS
OF THE</B>
<P><B>SHIP JUST TO GET TO THE VENDING MACHINES IN THE LATE HOURS OF THE
NIGHT,</B>
<P><B>WHEN EVERYONE ELSE ONBOARD WAS ASLEEP. WELL, TO GET BACK TO THE STORY,
THEY</B>
<P><B>SAY THAT YOU CAN SEE A CHIEF WALKING AROUND IN  HIS KHAKI'S IN THE
VOIDS'</B>
<P><B>LATE AT NIGHT. AS MUCH AS I HAVE HEARD THOUGH, HE JUST APPEARS AT THE
VERY</B>
<P><B>CORNER OF YOUR EYE, AND YOU CANNOT SEE HIM IF HE WAS STARING STRAIGHT
AT</B>
<P><B>YOU. SO WHAT MAKES THIS STORY A LEGITIMATE HAUNT? WELL IT IS BECAUSE
ONCE,</B>
<P><B>LONG AGO, WHEN THE SHIP WAS NEWLY COMMISIONED, THERE WAS THIS STORY
ABOUT A</B>
<P><B>CHIEF, A GUNNER'S MATE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF HIS WIFE TO
VISIT</B>
<P><B>HIM. WHEN HE HAD GOTTEN WORD THAT SHE ARRIVED HE JUMPED ABOARD THIS</B>
<P><B>ELEVATOR, (WHICH IS MEANT STRICTLY FOR AMMO AND NOT PERSONNEL), WHEN
HE</B>
<P><B>TRIPPED AND HIS BODY WAS TRAPPED BETWEEN THE ELEVATOR AND THE RAPIDLY</B>
<P><B>APPROACHING CEILING, HIS HEAD BEING THE ONLY PART THAT WAS NOT ON THE</B>
<P><B>ELEVATOR. SO EVERYBODY ON THE UPPER LEVEL WAS WONDERING WHAT WAS ABOUT
TO</B>
<P><B>ARRIVE ON THE ELEVATOR WHEN WHAT THEY NOTICE WHAT DOES ARRIVE IS A
BODY,</B>
<P><B>WITH NO HEAD AND BLOOD GUSHING OUT OF THE AREA WHERE IT ONCE LAY AT.
AND</B>
<P><B>YES, SADLY THE WIDOW WAS THERE TO WITNESS THIS ALSO. </B>

</H3></H3><P><B>BY:abutterfly@n2music.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi. I myself have only had three experiences in my short life time.
I am 14 yrs old and I live in mass. </B>
<P><B>Two of my experiences have taken place at my grandmas lace in Cape
Cod. The first happened about three yrs </B>
<P><B>ago, me and my cousin had gone upstairs to their otherrefigerator to
get some juice for the BBQ we were </B>
<P><B>having with our families. Heather (my cousin) handed me the juice and
told me to go down while she grabed </B>
<P><B>us some popsicles, so I started down the stairs and I as about half
way down when Heather screamed, well I</B>
<P><B>turned around just to see a man walk across the hall and enter her
room. I ran back up there and we went </B>
<P>i<B>n to see where he had gone, we searched the whole</B> r<B>oom and
the guy had disappeared, from a SECOND story </B>
<P><B>room! The second thing I experienced there was when I</B> <B>was spending
the night there and I woke up in the </B>
<P><B>middle of the night and their light (it was one of the ones where you
touch it to turn it up)was getting </B>
<P><B>brighter and brighter! At first I thought it was just </B>&nbsp;<B>one
of my cousins doing it, but they where in their </B>
<P><B>beds, asleep. The light kept going on, and getting brighter, and going
off again. The last time it came </B>
<P><B>on it stayed on ,by this time my cousins had awoken and were freeking
out, I had ducked under my covers</B>
<P><B>and after it stopped I looked up....right into the eyes of a older
man I had never seen before! He </B>
<P><B>disappeared after a second and I never saw him again. Later when I
was looking through a old photo album </B>
<P><B>I saw the man! I asked my dad who he was and he said that man is my
father. My grandfather had been dead </B>
<P><B>since my dad was 15, long before my parents meet, way before I was
born. The creepy thing is that just </B>
<P><B>before he died he told my grandma he would never leave her! That house
had been haunted for yrs. before my </B>
<P>e<B>xperience but more on that another time. The third time I experienced
something out of the ordinary was </B>
<P><B>at my own house, I used to live in a two story duplex with my aunt
and her family, we lived on the bottom </B>
<P><B>and they lived on top,and then there was the attic where we would always
play. The attic is where the </B>
<P><B>story takes place. There was a little room in the back that always
gave me the chills, but that is a </B>
<P><B>different story. One night we were all in bed and all of a sudden we
could hear all this banging from </B>
<P><B>upstairs,at first we thought it was my cousins playing but it didn't
stop, so my dad went up there and we all </B>
<P><B>followed him,when we got up there we could tell it was coming from
the attic and my cousins and aunt and </B>
<P><B>uncle where all out in the hallway to.We all went up there and the
noise stopped but all the boxes and </B>
<P><B>stuff we had up there were turned upside down and everything was thrown
around the room! We cleaned it </B>
<P><B>up and went back to bed. In the middle of the night we awoke to the
noises again! We all ran up there and </B>
<P><B>found the boxes in the same disaray they had been in before! We went
to bed and said we would take care of </B>
<P><B>it in the morning. When we wokeup in the morning we heard a knock on
our door it was our uncle he said </B>
<P><B>that all the boxes had been returned to their original state of neatness!
Does anyone have a good </B>
<P><B>explaination for all of this? If so I would like to hear it.  </B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Not too long ago maybe about a week or three, I was sitting in my room
and </B>
<P><B>it was around 11:00 pm, I was sitting there in the dark, and I heard
</B>
<P><B>voices whispering, I started to look around and I saw these black shadows
</B>
<P><B>lingering around my room, they were like black smoke. I got freaked
and </B>
<P><B>I turned on the light. Everything stopped, and I thought it was all
in </B>
<P><B>my head. So I turned back off the light and tried to fall back asleep.
I </B>
<P><B>heard the whispering again, but I tried  to ignore it and I soon fell
</B>
<P><B>asleep. It kinda sounds like nothing right now, but at that time I
knew </B>
<P><B>something was in my room. In the next few days, every night I heard
the </B>
<P><B>voices, and I'm into wicca, and decided to try a spell to make them
go </B>
<P><B>away. And my friend told me that if they leave then they were evil,
but </B>
<P><B>if they stayed then they were good. Well when I did it, that night
I </B>
<P><B>heard nothing. And so I guess they were evil....</B>

</H3><P><B>BY: Diddleltl@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Hey, I've written before on some of my experiences, but I just read
one that</B>
<P><B>reminded me of something one of my friends told me.  The story I read
had a</B>
<P><B>part about the author hearing ghosts in the barracks while she was
in boot</B>
<P><B>camp.  My friend had similar experiences while in boot camp on Parris
Island.</B>
<P><B>&gt;From what I could understand about the set up of the barracks they
were staying</B>
<P><B>in, there were two wings connected by a big bathroom with showers.
 My friend,</B>
<P><B>we'll call her Becky, said that one night while she was up on fire
watch, she</B>
<P><B>heard what sounded like several recruits walking around with shower
shoes on</B>
<P><B>when everyone was fast asleep.  Another night, Becky heard someone
rummageing</B>
<P><B>around.  She thought it was the other person she was on watch with,
but that</B>
<P><B>person came around the corner just a few moments later.  When they
were allowed</B>
<P><B>time to socialize (which didn't happen very often) she talked to one
girl who</B>
<P><B>was staying in another haunted building.  The friend was apparently
a little</B>
<P><B>pshycic or something because she said there was something very bad
in her</B>
<P><B>barracks.  Becky actually went into her friends barracks and felt an
overly</B>
<P><B>oppressive feeling.  It was bad.</B>
<P><B>One of the popular stories that goes around Parris Island is about
a few</B>
<P><B>recruits that died in the one swampy areas on the island.  I think
it was</B>
<P><B>called either the White or Pink Elephant and some people seem to think
that it</B>
<P><B>could be some of those recruits.  </B>
