<b><font face="Arrus BT">Often we hear of cases in which a person sees
an image of a person they know while they person is really miles away at
the time, alive.&nbsp; That's correct, alive and breathing.&nbsp; This
type of apparition is called a crisis apparition and it is often studied
by ghost researchers due to the similarities in these apparitions and ghosts
of the deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; This phenomenon can also manifest in the person
hearing a voice of a friend or loved one with some message or warning while
the person who is heard speaking is no where near and totally unaware that
this has occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of these crisis apparitions occur when
a person is in some form of danger or pain.&nbsp; It appears the person
in danger makes psychic contact with a loved one miles away to let them
know something is not right.&nbsp; The person in crisis is not aware that
they are doing this.&nbsp; Here are a few examples of phenomenon:</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">December 1943:&nbsp; Mrs. Violet Almond was
awakened by an apparition of her husband that floated above her for a few
minutes.&nbsp; She learned later that her husband, who was on a battlefield
in North Africa, was being shelled heavily and was praying to God to save
him so he could see his wife again at the exact time she was seeing his
apparition in their bedroom.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arrus BT">1951 - Helen Crone saw an apparition of a close
friend who was alive miles away.&nbsp; The agitated apparition instructed
her to go check on her baby.&nbsp; When she did this she found her child
had managed to open a drawer full of sharp knives and was about to play
with them.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arrus BT">These crisis apparitions may help us understand
how and why we see ghosts., especially deceased human ones who are earthbound
or just visiting.&nbsp; The person in crisis some how projects an energy
to another person.&nbsp; The receiver's brain translates the energy into
a human like figure that resembles the sender.&nbsp; Is this the same energy
that is left behind or accompanies a deceased human spirit?&nbsp; Some
people who are more "in tune" with a particular spirit's energy may see
a full bodied apparition just like in many crisis apparitions.&nbsp; Others
may not interpret the energy the same or at all and just see a light, a
mist, or nothing.&nbsp; We can apply this theory of the spirit energy interpretation
to spirit photos as well.&nbsp; The majority of photos are not full bodied
apparitions but what researchers believe are spirits energy that the camera
translates into the form of orbs, mists, vortexes and light rods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I view crisis apparitions as more proof that there is a part of us that
can leave the physical body or live on without it and still make contact
with others, accomplish tasks and operate as an intelligent entity.&nbsp;
I think this is what we call the soul.</font></b>
