<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The Haunted Trailer Experience</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Izzatyutu@aol.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>One of the places that I investigated
over the last couple
of years was a haunted trailer in Tolono, Illinois.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A ghost hunter in Chicago got a call from a
guy who owned a haunted trailer and he told him to call me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Tolono isn't exactly next door to the Chicago
suburb that I am from, but after talking to the owner, was intrigued
enough to
make the trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My paranormal
investigation partner Connie was willing to drive down there, as I had
to save
the mileage on my leased car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we
finally arrived, waiting for us was the owner and promptly took as
around for a
tour of the trailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just the
three of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His boy was at his parent's
place. He mentioned a ghost of a woman who was in his front yard on one
occasion and she walked through the inside of his trailer from one wall
to the
other on another occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tapping
noises happening on a regular basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
branch dipping way down as his mother was leaving his trailer once,
while there
was no wind at the time, just like if an unseen hand was pulling it
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No animals in sight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Connie and myself did hear tapping noises,
but I used to live in a trailer and it was normal to hear different
noises on
occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when we heard what was
tapping noises coming from the light bulbs in the overhead lights of
the living
room, like finger nails tapping them, then I started to be intrigued.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner of the trailer turned off all the
electrical devices nearest to us so not to interfere with our
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was using the K-2 meter
that I bought from
Shadowlands ghosthunting store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of
my favorites for communication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I placed
it inches away from his boy's musical toy and had the owner start the
music.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no readings, as it wasn't
giving
off any electromagnetic frequencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
later when I had the meter several feet away from it on the couch where
I was
sitting and he set the music on, all the lights, including the red
zone, lit up
and pulsated to the music.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie
mentioned what the meter was doing and I told her that I see that and
the meter
can't do that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seems impossible.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Especially since it didn't do it with the
meter only inches away from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was
worth the trip by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something was
making the meter do that. Later into the night I heard something going
on in
his boy's toy room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was on the living
room couch at the time, so went over to the room, but there was nothing
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then set up an infra-red video
camera at the door of that room, but didn't get anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later Connie's infra-red camera captured orbs
in the owner's bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then my camera
captured a rather impressive orb in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It traveled from the floor to the
ceiling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All in all, if the meter hadn't
had all the lights on it pulsate to the music, it would have been very
tame of
an investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My motion detector
didn't go off that I had positioned in different parts of the trailer,
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The K2 meter phenomena was
totally awesome.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I also tried
some EVP's, but didn't get anything on them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Connie said she put them into her sound enhancement system later
on her
computer, but didn't detect anything.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I thought that anyone reading about this might make some sense
on why
the K2 meter would do such a thing, otherwise I find it as unexplained.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>New House, Haunted Grounds</big></big></p>

</span></big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I just moved to the Kelly's Ford area
where a huge battle
took place. Weird things started happening, creeks, drumming, all sorts
of
paranormal things. But, one day I was home alone and on the computer, I
started
hearing drumming outside, so I look out the window it stops and just
turn and
continue on the computer. Next thing I know is that it starts again. I
look it
stops. I'm always thinking that its the solders drumming their way
around.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That's not all. I
started seeing shapes
like orbs, blurry body shapes, and even once I when I was watching TV I
saw a
blue glowing head with a solder hat. I saw it as clear as a cloudless
day. But,
what really freaked me out was it's dead looking eyes just staring
strait at
me. I think I was the only one that saw it and this is the first time I
have
talked/written about it. I know I'm a psychic/mental medium/clairvoyant
and a
bunch of other stuff but my powers have never been this strong.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also was experiencing these
"death
dreams" too. Each morning I woke up feeling scared but relieved that I
was
alive for once. One of the first dreams I had right before I moved to
my new
house I had a dream. It was a snowy morning and I was digging in the
snow in
the corner of the front yard and I guess from the snow melting and
eroding the
soil away, I found a body. The body was decayed but I could still tell
what the
corpse was wearing. Blue. A Civil War solder. Then I just woke up. That
was one
of the many, many dreams I had. Most of the other dreams I had was that
I was
either being murdered,enslaved by a evil mind control person, murdered,
being a
murderer (they called me a kira), or even committing suicide. I don't
really
mind them anymore, I kinda got use to these nightmares. I'm still not
sure how
all of this adds up.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A Story Of My Brother's</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ckeehn@madrigalinsurance.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I remember this vividly, almost as if it
happened to me&#8230;.but
it actually happened to my little brother&#8230;.I was about 8 or 9 years old
and my
brother was 7 or 8&#8230;.back then (I am 43 now), we wandered the
neighborhood until
the street lights came on&#8230;.it wasn&#8217;t so dangerous as it is
today&#8230;Anyway, about
3 miles down main street in Euless, Tx. from our apartments you came to
an old
road that turned right&#8230;then down &frac12; mile there was a grave yard
with a lot of
very old gravestones in it&#8230;after the graveyard there was a rail road
track&#8230;Some
of us kids wanted to get some of the metal railroad ties as they made
super
whistles when you bent them in half&#8230;so my brother volunteered to ride
his bike
over there to get some for us&#8230;we said &#8220;great!&#8221;.About 30 minutes or so
after
that as the evening was beginning to really be upon us, he came back
and he was
sweating profusely, very white, and shaking like no body&#8217;s business&#8230;he
wouldn&#8217;t
tell us why.Later that night, I got him to tell me what happened and it
scared
me to death&#8230;When he got to the edge of the graveyard, he heard barking
behind
him&#8230;.when he turned around to look, he saw 3 white dogs slavering and
madly
coming at him&#8230;so naturally he sped up his bike as fast as he could
go&#8230;.strangely enough, once he got to the end of the graveyard, the
barking
stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked back and there was
nothing&#8230;no dogs&#8230;completely empty road.He got to the railroad track and
got the
ties we wanted him to get and turned to go back home (and back past the
graveyard)&#8230;.as soon as he got to the graveyard again he heard the
barking and
growling and turned around, sure enough, the dogs were behind him
again, but a
lot closer&#8230;.he screamed &#8220;go away&#8221; and began pedaling as if his life
depended on
it and as soon as he hit the end of the graveyard, they again were
gone&#8230;.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Andrea's Spirit</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:jemaguire@wavecable.com<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My second wife, Andrea,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>died in our home in Ontario, California in 2001 of advanced
breast
cancer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had been married less than
two years.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I remarried my new
wife
told me that she could 'feel the presence' of my previous wife. I did
not,
though I am usually quite sensitive to spirits and such feelings.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Three days before we were to leave on an
extended motorcycle trip, Debi fell down our stairs and upon landing on
the
first floor, found that her right foot had been fractured.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I asked Debi how the accident had
happened she told me that she felt as though she had been pushed as she
came
down the </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>stairs just before she reached the
bottom of the
stairway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that in
life, Andrea was quite jealous of my friends and of anyone who may ride
with me
on the motorcycle, including my children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was adament that no one except her was to ride on the
motorcycle with
me at any time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A year later Debi and I
had to move out of state and, unable to sell the Ontario house, we
decided to
rent it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was subsequently
rented by a latino woman, her mother and three children. I did not tell
the
renter anything of the aforementioned incidents.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Within two weeks of havng moved into the
house, our renter contacted us by telephone. She asked if someone had
died in
the house. I told her at that time that my second wife had.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She then told me that she and her family had
heard the sound of a woman crying in one of the downstairs rooms and
that she
had seen a foggy image at the top of the second story landing twice.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time and for the next two years my
renter and her family were not frightened by the 'spirit'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Fast
forward to November 2009.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to
travel to Ontario to work on the rental house. Immediately upon
arriving, the
renter told me that there was a 'problem'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told me of her children being awakened in the night by a
tall woman
in a blue dress standing next to their beds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The children were, by this time, being frightened and refused to
sleep
in their rooms and had started to sleep with their mother in the master
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The family had a young dog,
approximately 8 months old that slept beside the mother's bed each
night. One
night the dog awoke, ran to the bedroom door and started growling.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The dog would walk through the open door,
growl loudly toward the staircase and then back up into the bedroom.
The continued
for several minutes until the mother walked onto the landing and looked
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing nothing, she returned to
the bedroom and called the dog back to side of the bed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The next morning upon waking the mother found
the dog dead on it's bed with no outward signs of a cause for it's
death. She
took the dog to her veterinarian and asked for an autopsy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No cause was found for the death of the
dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family continued to see images
of the tall woman in the blue dress, (she was buried in the same blue
dress she
wore when we were married), from time to time. The mother called in a
Mexican
Spirit person who immediately claimed to feel the presence of a woman
who was
very upset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left the house in haste
and refused to reenter the house.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
hearing this story I contacted a woman who is a member of the Makah
indian
tribe in NW Washington, (near our new home).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told her the story and she told me that my feelings that
Andrea's
spirit were still in the house were, in all likelihood real.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She advised that I obtain some White Sage,
burn it in the Ontario house and tell Andrea that she must leave and
continue
her journey to the next world.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
returned to Ontario and did as the Makah had advised.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The renter was the only other person in the
house at the time I did this. She is catholic and prayed the entire
time I
smudged the house, told Andrea to leave and offered a Christian prayer
asking
for an angel to come and assist Andrea on her journey.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the 'ceremony' I felt a strong
presence but nothing unpleasent and was, in fact, overwhelmed by a
feeling that
Andrea was there and was happy to see and hear me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It has now been a month since I performed
the ceremony and having called the renter and asked her if all was
well, she
told me that the crying sounds and the frightening image have vanished
and all
is now well in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you for
letting me tell you of my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I
feel a bit strange having been involved in something like this, I am
more than
convinced that this sort of thing is real and that there is a way to
deal with
these occurrences.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I have confirmation that the clearfield
job corps center is
infact haunted. L dorm as listed on this site is a strange place. On my
way to
class at 7:30am every morning the light infront of this particular dorm
was
always on. none of the other dorms' lights were on at the time though,
i
thought that was very weird. Another place on Campus is infact the
Movie
Theatre. I talked to one of the staff members in the theatre and he
confirmed
that many strange things happen. The theatre gets very cold even though
the
heater and thermostat is working fine, and the projectors always had
problems.
even after buying a new one that had no faults at all. The projector
would
always freeze or shut off without any explanation. I dont know. i just
wanted
to confirm those stories that had been reported on your site. I was a
UAW
student there from August 2008 to April 2009.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ryukgirl@gmail.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My name is morgan . Since I as four I
have been suffering
from ghostly appiritions. I guess it started when my parents were away
for an
hour and I heard something on the roof. I ignored it but soon after it
sounded
like footsteps. I paniced and called the police. They told me it was
just the
wind. My parents said I was just anxious about being home alone. When I
was
seven I started waking up with cuts on my arm. I didn't even remember
how i got
them. They just appeared there. My mom thought I was doing this to
myself and
sent me to a nearbye mental institute. I swore I wasn't crazy. Every
night I
ould hear a woman singing rock a'by baby. I never felt threatened by
this, but
certain parts of my house would be freezing even in the summer. My mom
would
just say it was the house circulation. She would blame it on the house
being
old.I am<span style="">&nbsp; </span>still labeled with an anxiety
disorder. Nobody will believe me. I'm slowly losing it. My old friends
mock me
about my visions. When I saw this place I thought it would be a good
place to
let off steam.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Haunted Morse Mill Motel</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>charlenecolo@hotmail.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I would like to share a story with you
and your audience
about a VERY HAUNTED OLD HOTEL called the Morse Mill Hotel. It is
located in
Morse Mill MO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and anyone can tour
it--The Morse Mill Hotel, originally a one room house built some time
in the
early 1800's, now a supernatural landmark, open to all that are seeking
a true
haunted house experience. A look back at it's history will give you a
feel of
how it came to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the early 1800's,
the house was expanded to the current size of 5300 square feet by John
Morse.
Morse was the premier bridge builder and engineer who used the hotel as
his
family's primary residence. Since then, the hotel has been used as a
Confederate hospital, a hotel, a brothel, a speakeasy, a United States
post
office and half-way house. It was home to the first known female
American
serial killer, Bertha Gifford. Many famous people like Al Capone,
Charles
Lindburgh, Clara Bow and more have walked it's halls. I have had
several "things"
happen to me when I visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was just
there about a week ago and saw a big beautiful orb-- and it was not the
moon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See for yourself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway-- I have heard knocking on the window
and humming when there has been no one around--even my dogs heard it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I also had someone ask me if I wanted to go
swimming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen a lady dressed in
black in the "widows peak" and a white image in one of the
windows.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right now several people
have
been in and are getting tons of EVPs.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Magidragon14@aol.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>hello I really enjoy your web site and I
am glad you have
created it any way's I have had 3-4 ghostly experiences I will start
with the
first one I remember i was about 13 years old living in a house on
southwest
16nth street in Oklahoma city, well one night I was having trouble
getting to
sleep and for some reason I was drawn to look outside and there I
saw...some
thing it looked to be a small child (about my height at the time) but
it was
not transparent as people normally exp lane<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>ghosts<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was very sold but
horridly pale the only way I can describe it is if you painted your
skin the
brightest shade of white and he was glowing in a very strange way
dragging a
book bag down the street looking straight ahead<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and then he seemed to vanish I was so scared that I didn't sleep
at all
that night but i never really told any one just because I'm not sure if
I was
asleep and did not know it at the time...my second experience was
strange but
not as bad as the first I was home alone and my mom was at work and she
told me
to clean a few things while she was gone well I was being lazy and
putting it
off until I finally thought " all right I gotta get this done" and no
sooner as I walk into the bathroom that I was supposed to clean i hear
a very
loud and growling in my ear and for some reason I got very angry and
just told
it to get the hell away from me yes I know not very smart to yell at a
ghost...
but I got the bath room cleaned and I was about to walk out side when
my bird
started to squawk and I turned around to see the hair line of some one
moving
quickly under the windowsill and (yes again) i told it to leave me
alone and
nothing ever happened to me since my 3rd (and last)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>experience was with my girlfriend at the time
she was showing me where her aunt lived at the time and we were at the
bottom
of this very large hill when (she claims to see and talk to ghosts
after this I
believed her) she started saying that some thing very bad was with<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>us at the time about then the radio in my
truck started to get static and then I felt a pair of hands (felt more
like
claws really) wrap around my shoulders and call my name threw the radio
I drove
about 80 miles an hour until i got back to my house before my first
(and a little
after that really) I never really believed in an afterlife or an astral
plane
of existence but I do now and i hope to learn all I can of it </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My family used to live in Greene, NY
from the early 60's
until 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to live on North
Canal St. at the corner, across the street from the Old Burying Ground.
There
was an empty lot btw us and our neighbors. I think now anyone familiar
with the
town knows exactly which house I'm talking about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never spent one comfortable hour in that
house. I was a latch key kid so when I got home I stayed outside for as
long as
I could until someoune else got home. I was always seeing shadows out
of the
corner of my eye, hearing noises and generally being scared all the
time. It
don't take much when your ten yrs old with a cemetery across the st. My
aunt
came to visit us one summer and she said she saw an apparition of woman
in a
yellow dress with a straw hat sitting at the top of the stairs, she was
very
beautiful I was told. She also heard voices coming from my brother's
bedroom
late at night and witnessed an apparition of a small boy wearing a
sailor's
outfit (popular in the victorian era) sitting at the foot of my
brothers bed
and speaking to him while he slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother on the other hand had her own experiences. Her bedroom had a
large
walk-in closet and in the summer my father used to place a large fan in
the
window there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother awoke one night
to turn off the fan and when she walked into the walk-in closet to
reach for
the pull chain for the light, she "bumped" into what appeared to be a
robed being, much like a monk as she described it to me. She said it
made a
kind of garbled, mumbled sound, unintelligible anyway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father had to move the fan.... and the
light stayed on after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On another
occasion it was confirmed I guess that the being my mother bumped into
was a
monk. This time she got the full show. She was awakened and sat up in
bed.
There he was, a capuchin, with the brown cassock, hood up over his
head, arms
folded and tucked into his sleeves, white knotted cord around the waist
with
crucifix attached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He walked right past
her, out of her room, down the hall and right into the room me and my
sisters
shared. Then he faded and was gone. I'm glad I never saw what they did,
but I
frequently, very frequently had bad dreams and I always felt on edge.
Even now
at 46, I have 4 or 5 dreams a year about that house and they are all
very
negative and very disturbing. One last thing and this really did it for
me:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I live in Yorkville, NY now,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>and last winter while I was meditating
...there was that monk... a capuchin, exactlly as my mother had
described but
he was just standing next to me. Standing still, about two foot to my
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remember, my eyes are closed and I'm
very calm,
and in my vision I can see my living room exactlly the way it should
look
except this short, chubby monk is in it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now, this is the thing,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never
knew about my mother's experiences in Greene because she didnt want to
scare us
kids. I happened to call my mother just this morning to ask her about
that
place because a few days ago I had another dream about that house and I
was
wondering if she had any idea why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So as
we were talking about living there, she told me about what the monk.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>And that's it.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This happened to me about five years
ago. I live in the
small community of Rough Rock with population 1000. Any we have this
small
bridge as you head out of town and I had heard stories of people saying
they
have seen someone hitchhiking on the bridge but no one can identify
him. Well
on this particular night I was with friends and we all were drinking
and having
a good time. Suddenly it was time for everyone to go home and besides
we ran
out of drinks. I started home without incident and it began to drizzle.
I got
on the road and my house is just beyond the bridge. As I approached I
saw
someone standing there in the middle of the bridge. And I slowed down
to see
who it was. But I always drive with the passenger side locked because
of
carjackings in the area. Anyway I looked at the person through the
windshield
and I could see that this guy was wearing a cowboy shirt with fancy
embroidery
of flowers with jeans but I could not see his face. It was look at a
live t.v.
coverage when they blur the faces that looks like a fog is covering it.
I
almost stopped then I heard a loud bang on the roof of my car. I sped
out of
there without looking back. I got home and I felt as though my energy
was
drained. At the same time I heard my dogs begin to bark. But I did not
even get
into my pajamas and fell into bed. Has anyone ever felt this before, a
ghost
draining your energy?</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I had just broken my leg and arrived at
the hospital in
Gardener, MA. My leg was throbbing so bad I couldn&#8217;t see. The nurse was
immediately by my side with a needle when they put me in a bed in the
E.R. All
she said was turn to your side. I complied and was met with a stick in
the
bottom. The nurse then took x-rays of my leg and it showed a complete
break.
After about one hour in the E.R. I was moved to a room by myself. It
was at
this time I was really groggy from whatever was in the shot but I felt
like I
was flying and could barely hear my coach talking to me. Then I was
out. When
the medication wore off the pain woke me up at 2 in the morning. I was
kind of
disoriented and was getting my barrens when an old man was near the
doorway. He
was pushing one of those metal coat rack looking things with a bag of
saline on
it with a tube leading to his arm. I said, &#8220;hello&#8221; and he asked like he
was
confused &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; And I answered him. He was not angry or
imposing but
gentle then he asked with concern, &#8220;What happen to you?&#8221; I said I broke
my leg
playing basketball which is what really happened. He again with concern
said,
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. Rough sport isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; The pain was getting I finally
located the
nurses&#8217; station button. The light came on and I asked the old man, &#8220;Are
you
lost? Do you need someone to get you back to your room?&#8221; Like any old
independent person he said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m just tired of lying around and
decided to
take a walk. Nice to meet you young fellow. By the way what are you?&#8221;
I&#8217;m full
blooded Native American and I gave a little laugh and answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m a
Navajo.&#8221;And he responded, &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame how my ancestors made your
ancestors
walk almost a thousand miles. I hope history didn&#8217;t you bitter against
whiteman.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;No, both sides didn&#8217;t understand and I think
you&#8217;re
talking about the Cherokee tribes.&#8221; He stood at the doorway nodding and
turned
and left. As soon he was past the door frame the nurse appeared at the
door and
I asked her who that old man was. She gave me a puzzled look and asked
what old
man. I said he just went out of my room before you came in, so you&#8217;ve
had to
seen him in the hallway. That&#8217;s when she told me that people often talk
about
visitations from those that have died in the hospital. I thought my
ghostly
experience would be scary but mine was pleasant. I guess it&#8217;s the kind
of ghost
you get.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My family and I lived in JC Machuca back
in the years of
1979 to 1981. We lived in apt<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Machuca.
While we were living there, we would hear footsteps on the 2nd floor,
and our
TV downstairs would just turn on for no apparent reason at all. While
living
there the window on the 2nd floor master bedroom shattered for no
reason at
all. Our bathroom on the 2nd floor had a hole that was plastered in, we
later
found out that a boy was shot by his mother in the bathroom. Our next
door
neighbor would chase her boy with a knife, while we were living there.
She did
succeed in killing him after several attempts. She would lock the boy
in the
closet. I was only 12 at the time that I lived there, and I was so
scared to go
upstairs on the weekends and summers when my mom worked the night
shift, that I
would go out back to pee. Once while my siblings and I were in Deming
for the
summer, my mother and my step dad her finance at the time were sleeping
in the
living room, we had just purchased a sofa bed and they were using it. A
red
ball was thrown from the upstairs and a Childs voice said Come play
with me. My
Name is Daniel Gray and I thought I would share this info with you. I
always
had a feeling that Machuca was haunted. We have never experienced so
much
paranormal activity than Machuca</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Not Far From Forest Park</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By: Anonymous </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I live in riverside Il which is not far
from forest park and
can tell that people have mixed up the jewish cemetary with the
resurrection
mary legend, Some of the mix up caused a new, false story. As for
Normal IL and
ISU I am currently a student there (class of 2010) and lived on colby 3
and am
a memeber of Lambda Chi Alpha, the fraternity listed as well as
currenlty
living in the house. As for the 11th floor people have heard a person
screaming
in the storage room on top of Atkin. The fraternity has a bit more
info. The
Lambda Chi Alpha house used to be the Delta Zeta sorority house, and
the Girls
name was carol anne. As the Story is told by the "brothers and
Sisters" she was stabbed by her boyfriend (although it was never proved
who actually did it) near the train tracks (belived to be by fell ave.)
she
crawled back to the house and died on the front steps where she was
found. (Facing
the front of the house) her room was the last room on the right side of
the
secondt<span style="">&nbsp; </span>floor and there is a painting of
Carol anne on a Plywood sheet attchedto to the loft so if you were to
be
underneath looking up, that would be all you could see. Also it is said
that
the hands facing you in the painting are real tracings of her hands. (
I could
send you a picture if you like) Every year the DZs hold a candle light
vigil
outside the house in honor of carol anne. What brothers have
experienced; One of
our older brothers who will go unnamed was staying at isu and the house
for the
summer. He me up with some of the guys and hit the bars, but when they<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>got to the house after to keep partying they
found every light turned on, all the doors to the rooms unlocked and
open, and
all the entrances unlocked and open, Including the vip bathroom which
locks
automatically nad has only 2 keys. Nothing was stolen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People feel a presence, and/or get sudden
chills in the basement sometimes when doing laundry, working out, or
even
cutting through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guys have heard
laughing and crying in the basement, and late at night when everyones
asleep
(like during finals)Brothers have seen for a brief second the blurred
image of
someone behind them in the reflections off the thglss of the hallway
doors.People hear footsteps in the attic, even though there is no floor
and not
enough room to walk at the ends of the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have heard my roomates loft creaking and rustling when he
was'nt
sleeping there. And no more than three weeks ago right before break
started I
woke up around 9am and was briefly talking to my roomate who I thought
was on
his bed. Like "morning bro" with a groggy resonse "mornin"
and I asked dont you have a final this mornong?" I hear " like an
hour" and at the moment my roomate walks in. We were both freaked. I
would
like to mention that this was during finals and I was not under nor
recovering
from being under the influence of any controlled substance.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I am writing about the house in Peabody.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister used to live in the house.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I will agree that there is definitely a weird
vibe in that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am generally not
afraid of things but I used to babysit my niece and after a couple of
strange,
unexplainable events I would not stay in the house with the kids after
it got
dark outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lots of noises,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>tv&#8217;s cd players etc. turning on without
explanation (my sister used to say it must be a power surge!&#8212;ya, right)
and
one<span style="">&nbsp; </span>time there was a strange noise
coming from out on the deck which abuts the cemetery,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was inside the family room and it was dusk
outside and I went </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>to look to see what the heck was making
that noise and when
I opened the vertical blinds on the slider there were squirrels hanging
on the
screen door screaming&#8230;it was so scay I took the kids back to my house
and
wouldn&#8217;t stay there anymore after dark!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was just looking on the web for a haunted ship in boston (
it&#8217;s some
sort of attraction)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I came across
your website and was scrolling through ( actually looking to see if
there were
any haunted places in Melrose ) when I read about the house in Peabody.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>we can&#8217;t believe that her house was on this
list!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>( well I can!) well, just had
to
let you know&#8212;you are right, it certainly is haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>My grandfather used to tell this story.
Here is his story
(as well as I can recall it) While living in Mexico, my grandfather
used to
work the late shift at a bakery and each night would walk back home
along a
road for several miles. On a particular night, he was walking along as
he
normaly did and he heard a baby crying so he followed the sound and up
ahead by
the side of the road was a bundle. He picked it up and unwrapped it and
it was
a baby. He wrapped it up and rushed home. When he got there he woke my
grandmother up to show her that baby he found. He once again unwrapped
it and
it was still the size of a baby but it has the face of an ugly man. My
grandfather noticed particularly that it had fully developed teeth
because it
smiled at them then started to laugh. In his astonishment (and fright)
he threw
the bundle out of a nearby window. The "baby" was not seen
again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></big></p>
