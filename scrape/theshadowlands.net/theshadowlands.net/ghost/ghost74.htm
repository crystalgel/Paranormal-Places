</H3><P><B>By: betsy_phillips@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a story I've carried with me for 25 years.  At the age of 12
I moved </B>
<P><B>to Southern California.  I soon was befriended by a girl at school
and we </B>
<P><B>soon became best friends.  Soon thereafter she began to share with
me what </B>
<P><B>her family was experiencing in their home.</B>
<P><B>Even at 12 years old I was somewhat skeptical but intrigued by what
she told </B>
<P><B>me.  She, her mother, 5 year old sister and 4 year old twin brother
and </B>
<P><B>sister rented a modest house next to a car junk yard.  My recollection
of </B>
<P><B>some of the earlier stories of the experiences my friend and her mother
had </B>
<P><B>have escaped me somewhat over the years.  I think this has to do with
not </B>
<P><B>really being a believer in what they told me until I had my own

experiences. </B>
<P><B>  My friend related to me how toys would fly across the room on their
own </B>
<P><B>accord, particulary when Mary (5-year old sister) was in the room.

According </B>
<P><B>to my friend and here mother on occasion Mary could be heard and observed

</B>
<P><B>apparently talking and playing with this ghost.   Window draperies
would </B>
<P><B>open and close on their own and objects would turn up missing.  I reasoned

</B>
<P><B>that someone in the family was doing this.    My friend said these</B>
<P><B>objects would later turn up in a crawl space that was located above
the top </B>
<P><B>bunk in the room she shared with Mary.  Apparently my friend's mother
did </B>
<P><B>some investigation into the history of the home and discovered that
many </B>
<P><B>years before a retarded five year old</B>
<P><B>girl had been drowned by her father in the home.   I don't recall the

reason </B>
<P><B>behind this, but I believe it had something to do with his being distraught

</B>
<P><B>over having a child of this condition.</B>
<P><B>I don't know this to be the exact truth and at the time I was like
"Yeah, </B>
<P><B>right."  But whatever was happening in this home frightened the mother
and </B>
<P><B>disrupted their lives to the extent that the mother brought in a priest
to </B>
<P><B>bless the house and place rosaries beads in all the doorways.  After
this </B>
<P><B>all the previous activities quieted down considerably.  This was around
the </B>
<P><B>time I had come into the picture.  At this time we had become friends
and </B>
<P><B>practically unseparatable as only 12 year old girls can be.  I began</B>
<P><B>spending practically every weekend at her house. My friend confided
in me </B>
<P><B>that even though the priest had blessed the house that whatever had
caused </B>
<P><B>the problems before had not completely left the house.  She didn't
want her </B>
<P><B>mother to know as my friend felt that her mother had been through so
much </B>
<P><B>and didn't want to upset her. Later on we found out that her mother
knew </B>
<P><B>that the problem did not go away.  Understand that my earliest times
spent </B>
<P><B>in this house</B>
<P><B>when my friend was telling me all these stories I never personally
</B>
<P><B>experienced or saw anything that they spoke of.  I was a true skeptic.
 I </B>
<P><B>really wasn't even spooked to be the house, except I avoided the bathroom

</B>
<P><B>(it had an old claw foot tub) as much as possible.</B>
<P><B>On one of my many nights that I spent over my friend and I were in
her room </B>
<P><B>on the top and bottom bunks.  It was probably 3 o'clock in the morning
and </B>
<P><B>as girls this age naturally do we were still not asleep - still giggling

and </B>
<P><B>talking into the wee hours of the morning. At one time she said to
me "This </B>
<P><B>is what I don't want my mom to know about, listen." she told me. "Something

</B>
<P><B>is going to happen" she told me.  She explained to me that often late
at </B>
<P><B>night (or early in the morning) she heard what was soon going to happen.

  </B>
<P><B>So I listened.  I didn't hear a thing, it was dead quiet, everyone
else in </B>
<P><B>the house was asleep.  She insisted that I would hear something.  What
I </B>
<P><B>heard next will perplex me the rest of my life.</B>
<P><B>Her bedroom opened up into one large size room that was used as a </B>
<P><B>combination living room/dining room.  The living room had a front door
that </B>
<P><B>opened to a front porch and the dining room area opened into the kitchen.

</B>
<P><B>Voices, many, many voices sounded out from the living room/dining area.
 The </B>
<P><B>bedroom door was closed and it was as if someone had suddenly turned
up the </B>
<P><B>volume of a t.v.</B>
<P><B>The sounds were the sounds of a good size group of people having a
party.  I </B>
<P><B>couldn't make out any words, it was just a bunch of people talking.
 Then as </B>
<P><B>suddenly as it "turned on" it</B>
<P><B>stopped.  I am  as sure as I am alive that those sounds came from the

living </B>
<P><B>room area and there were no people in the house other than her small

family. </B>
<P><B>  It was not the neighbors, all their lights were out as it was around
3 in </B>
<P><B>the morning.  As I said,  the house was next to a car junk yard (the
living </B>
<P><B>room/dining area faced the junk yard).  My other personal experience
is one </B>
<P><B>that to this day gives me</B>
<P><B>chills.  It was during the day and I can't recall specifically what
I was </B>
<P><B>doing in the house, just spending the weekend again and the kids were

</B>
<P><B>playing in the back yard and the mother working in the kitchen.  I
had to go </B>
<P><B>into my friends bedroom for something.  I went in and got whatever
it was </B>
<P><B>and was getting ready to close the door and walk out.  My back was
facing </B>
<P><B>the room as I was getting ready to leave the  the room when I felt
someone </B>
<P><B>looking at me.  I've heard many people describe this feeling and haven't

</B>
<P><B>often felt it since.  The room was dark even though it was the middle
of the </B>
<P><B>day because the shades were pulled down to keep the house cool.  As
 looked </B>
<P><B>I saw 2</B>
<P><B>red, bright eyes glaring back at me.  Initially (and I find this kind
of </B>
<P><B>amusing to this day) I thought "Oh, its a cat."  But upon closer

observation </B>
<P><B>and adjusting my eyes to the dark, I realized it was a little girl.
 (Here </B>
<P><B>come those chills).  Her eyes glowed bright</B>
<P><B>reddish/yellow.  I cannot explain this any better but that she looked

really </B>
<P><B>mad at me for being there and seeing her.  I kind of got the feeling
she </B>
<P><B>did not want me there, but in some way she was afraid of me.  How I
felt </B>
<P><B>this and came to this conclusion at the tender</B>
<P><B>age of 12 I'll never know.  But I knew it, and I know it to this day.
 As I </B>
<P><B>stood there mezmerized she crawled (she was kind of stooped down low
on the </B>
<P><B>floor when I first observed her) into the walk thru closet that connected

</B>
<P><B>with my friend's mother room.</B>
<P><B>There were many clothes hanging in the closet and as she entered it,
not one </B>
<P><B>piece of clothing moved.  She just kind of faded into the clothing.
 I saw </B>
<P><B>the outline of her long hair.  I cannot recall if I was able to make
out her </B>
<P><B>clothing.  What memory stays is those</B>
<P><B>eyes.  I left the room not sure of what I saw, I was sort of confused.
 I </B>
<P><B>met my friends mother in the kitchen area I and asked her where Mary
was.  </B>
<P><B>She told me that she was</B>
<P><B>playing in the backyard with her brother and sister, and she was. 
After </B>
<P><B>this I never saw anything else in this house.  Strangely enough, when
my </B>
<P><B>friend's mother researched this house she discovered the little girl's
name </B>
<P><B>that supposedly died in this house was Mary.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: Mitzie21@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I don't really know what you would think of this, but it certainly</B>
<P><B>scared me. My husband thought I was crazy, and my best friend laughed</B>
<P><B>over it. Our husbands had gone fishing, something which was the norm,</B>
<P><B>and as usual Deb and I rented movies. She was a bit older than I and

her</B>
<P><B>teen-aged children were out for the evening. Well, we had both fallen</B>
<P><B>asleep watching the movies, Deb on the floor and me on the couch, I

woke</B>
<P><B>up first and on the coffee table was a brass frog (it wasn't there

when</B>
<P><B>I had fallen asleep) positioned so it was staring right at me. As you</B>
<P><B>can imagine it was very unnerving, but the worse of it came after.</B>
<P><B>Soon after that night, I borrowed a book from Deb's youngest son. I

was</B>
<P><B>reading while my husband was away sprawled across the bed. When I got

up</B>
<P><B>to use the bathroom, I laid the book on the bed, only to find it

missing</B>
<P><B>when I returned. I tore apart the bedroom looking for it, to the

point</B>
<P><B>of lifting the mattress off the bed. About a week later, my husband</B>
<P><B>found it inbetween the mattress and the headboard, thats when he

stopped</B>
<P><B>laughing at me. </B>
<P><B>There were also the nights that I would wake with the feeling of

being</B>
<P><B>watched, to terrified to move, once I got the courage to wake Jim up,

it</B>
<P><B>was gone. This happened once or twice a week, and Jim knew I wasn't

just</B>
<P><B>imaging it because of how often I woke him up.</B>
<P><B>Once we moved, there were no other occurances, but I will never

forget</B>
<P><B>that brass frog staring at me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=final><B>Don's Final Good-Bye</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: CDZEHR@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was very young, maybe 8 or 9, I woke up out of a pretty deep
sleep for </B>
<P><B>no reason at all.  I looked up into the corner of my room and there
is a </B>
<P><B>glowing ball,almost like a nucleas. It had an orangish center with
a </B>
<P><B>yellowish glowing outside. Well then  I thought it was some sort of

creature, </B>
<P><B>the way little children imagine things.  I pushed it out of my mind
until one </B>
<P><B>day about five years ago.  My good friend Don was murdered by another

person </B>
<P><B>I knew, and his brother.  I found out the day after it happened when
some of </B>
<P><B>my old friends found out my phone number.  The reason it took so long
to find </B>
<P><B>where I was is because I had gotten married and had a child.  Don was

single </B>
<P><B>and still liked to do the young partying and acting up that we used
to do.  </B>
<P><B>So we kind of split apart for a few years. But he was still there for
me, </B>
<P><B>whereas when I had my daughter he came to see me, and when I was having

</B>
<P><B>marital problems he visisted me then also.  So we weren't completely
out of </B>
<P><B>contact.  Well, anyway back to the glowing ball.  When I found out
about Don, </B>
<P><B>I went to go see a  friend of both of ours. There was other people
there to. </B>
<P><B>We sat and talked and comforted each other . Well, eventually it became

late </B>
<P><B>and I decided to leave. I  went home with my daughter, who was 1 by
then, and </B>
<P><B>went directly to bed. I was completely exhausted from crying and

emotionally </B>
<P><B>drained.  I woke up about 2 hours later, it was around 1:45, and groggily

</B>
<P><B>kind of sat up and saw a glowing ball at the edge of my bed.  It kind
of just </B>
<P><B>hovered there at the bottom. Without thinking about it I just looked
at it </B>
<P><B>and said "Hi Don!" smiling at the ball  and then just went back to
sleep. I </B>
<P><B>remebered it the next morning and thought about how we used to say
to each </B>
<P><B>other that whoever would pass away first, that person would come back
and say </B>
<P><B>Hi to let the others know that there is an afterlife. I know it sounds
kind </B>
<P><B>of crazy but I am sure it was Don and he was coming to say goodbye.
 The </B>
<P><B>reason that I think that, is because when I remembered the other occurence

</B>
<P><B>from when I was young I remembered that it happened about the same
time that </B>
<P><B>my grandfather passed away. I had always been a favorite of his, my
mom would </B>
<P><B>tell me,  and before he passed I would go to stay with him and help
him when </B>
<P><B>he was sick from the cancer he had, and from his chemotherapy.  So
I really </B>
<P><B>do believe  that it was my friend Don coming to let me know that he
was </B>
<P><B>alright, and to say a final goodbye.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Well I have stomped upon your site ;)) a kewl one ;)) Anyway I have
had alot </B>
<P><B>of experiences.  From when I was a child till now.  I had a ghost friend

when </B>
<P><B>i was young, I feel what parents like to call make believe,  well there
is </B>
<P><B>nothing made up really.  This ghost was a little boy, I'd say he was
about 9. </B>
<P><B>He would tell me to do things I was not aloud to do.  But was my friend,

that </B>
<P><B>lasted a while...till my mother taught me that in God's name You could
take </B>
<P><B>things out of your life, so I tried that out and it worked.  I have
walked </B>
<P><B>passed houses in different neighbor hoods, and saw what happened years

</B>
<P><B>ago...For instance...I was walking with my bestfriend when I saw a
man </B>
<P><B>getting stabbed in the head by to men in black skee masks...And she
freaked </B>
<P><B>out, she told me that , 5 years ago there was a robbery at that house
and two </B>
<P><B>black males with black ski masks stabbed a Chinese man in that yard..What
I </B>
<P><B>had saw.  So that went on for a while.  Then I started to dream, Like
I </B>
<P><B>dreamt that I was giving birth and 3 weeks later I had a miscarriage,
Note I </B>
<P><B>didn't know I was pregnant.  Then I got in with some friends on the
board, </B>
<P><B>calling spirits. And did I learn and see some things. All different

spirits, </B>
<P><B>females,males,young,old Sneaky ones. I have found not to trust all
of </B>
<P><B>them...the board I feel is dangerous. I have seen things break, the
curser </B>
<P><B>fly across the room, window shudders slam. That was how I got spirits
in my </B>
<P><B>life ,I believe..... I also had a friend down the street this was my
most </B>
<P><B>exciting experience....now this house is haunted!!!! Lots of action
would go </B>
<P><B>on when we all got togather...Again playing with the board... the four
of us </B>
<P><B>felt that together with all of are energy could cause alot of action.
We were </B>
<P><B>all sitting on the bed calling...not even a minute we had something

pulling, </B>
<P><B>spelled out the name Micheal, and started typing that he watched poeple

</B>
<P><B>taking showers, Out of sight things, I thought someone was moving

it...being </B>
<P><B>freaked out in all...I threw my hands off, And so everyone else jerked

theirs </B>
<P><B>also. The pointer was still moving across the board , starting going
crazy in </B>
<P><B>circles a flew across the room. All of us jumped up and were trying
to get </B>
<P><B>out the door, the door would not open, the room got very chilling,
finally </B>
<P><B>after like 2 minutes the door opened. Then we were tripping over each
other </B>
<P><B>to get out. We got out and ran in the living room. And talked about
what we </B>
<P><B>felt. The girl who lived there left her shoes in the room. So I went
in with </B>
<P><B>her,cause nobody else would, the room was totally different, the coldness

was </B>
<P><B>gone...that was the lastime i played with a board. I had always thought

</B>
<P><B>someone was moving it.but we had always felt something was in that
house. You </B>
<P><B>could stand there and it feel like something walk right threw you.
the family </B>
<P><B>in it were moving out..selling it..And they only had a few things

left...like </B>
<P><B>furniture...one night i heard glass breaking ...LOUD...I went out and
saw </B>
<P><B>smoke in the road...note this house is right triangle from my house....I

</B>
<P><B>called 911... As I was talking to them I saw people running...so I
</B>
<P><B>thought...All I know is all the neighbors got questioned. I was the
only one </B>
<P><B>to see the people running and someone had called the police before
me. The </B>
<P><B>house was checked out for a year...Nobody knows how the fire started...the

</B>
<P><B>owners were located and the next day I went in with my friend and the
only </B>
<P><B>thing not burned in the room we played Quija in...was the Ouija board
and a </B>
<P><B>bible directly across the room..Tell me that isn't wild...I have so
many </B>
<P><B>stories...between my fathers stories...his friend lived next to a cemetery

</B>
<P><B>and was in a haunted house for 20 years.</B>
<P><B>My fiance working in a nursing home with a woman he was kinda close
to </B>
<P><B>died...and she use to get mad and go in her room and slam the door.
Well once </B>
<P><B>in a while late at night early morning ...the windows can be closed.
And the </B>
<P><B>pans in the kitchen will go nuts...spinning around the thing they are

haning </B>
<P><B>on. And her old bedroom door will slam shut. I went to this home in
the </B>
<P><B>daytime and i didn't like it...why i don't know but putting your hand
in this </B>
<P><B>room is cold, and you can feel the energy feild. But she was a cranky
old </B>
<P><B>woman. One night I was walking home with a friend, and we saw a ,looked

like </B>
<P><B>a woman(dirty)like she hadn't had a bath in a long while..l.was standing
at </B>
<P><B>the corner of are house. We had passed her about 5 feet was my house..not

</B>
<P><B>even a mintute we turned around she was gone...Either she was fast
and sneaky </B>
<P><B>or she was a ghost...didn't look very healthy. I have tons of stories
from my </B>
<P><B>own to others...to the man that this is your site..I'm not a very good

</B>
<P><B>writer..But I wanted to tell you some. And write me back please and
let me </B>
<P><B>know what you think. If you wanna know more let me know I have

alot...Oneday </B>

</H3><P><B>By: Amjstjen@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Boy this is different. For some reason, I don't know why, spirits
</B>
<P><B>seem to be attracted to me. The first time was when I still lived at
my mom's </B>
<P><B>house. I always had a feeling but couldn't pin point it, as I was the
only </B>
<P><B>one in the house that ever felt anything. </B>
<P><B>	The second time was at the house I used to live at down the street.
I </B>
<P><B>started calling him Charlie. Charlie liked to play games. He was

mischievious </B>
<P><B>like a child. He first made himself known via the CD player. I had
loaded it </B>
<P><B>up with my favorite tunes and was cleaning the house. All of a sudden,
a </B>
<P><B>classical piece started playing. I didn't recognize it, and ran to
the living </B>
<P><B>room to check and make sure I hadn't hit the wrong button. I hadn't,
the </B>
<P><B>digital reading said it was playing Pearl Jam, but this was clearly
not the </B>
<P><B>music I had loaded. </B>
<P><B>	The next thing was in the bathroom. I was leaning over the sink </B>
<P><B>getting ready to go out. I had come home to an empty house. One that
had been </B>
<P><B>empty since my roomate and I had left for work that morning. I was
in such a </B>
<P><B>hurry, I hadn't even run any water. Not even the toilet. The faucet
started </B>
<P><B>dripping, steadily. I looked down and it stopped. I shrugged and continued

</B>
<P><B>with putting on my mascara. It started dripping again. I looked down
and it </B>
<P><B>stopped again. I took a deep breath and continued. This time the drip
drip </B>
<P><B>drip was very fast. I stood up and told Charlie (by name) I didn't
have time </B>
<P><B>to play right then and it stopped at once.</B>
<P><B>	Another time my boyfriend and I were each woken up  by someone </B>
<P><B>calling our names. These events were at different times, and nobody
was home </B>
<P><B>with us to be calling. </B>
<P><B>	These events weren't spectacular, but I thought I would share them
</B>
<P><B>anyway. There are more instances. If you would like to hear more, please

let </B>
<P><B>me know.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: rbf691@impop.bellatlantic.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I lived in Woodbrige my family had a nice little house and</B>
<P><B>everything.  As far back as I can remember though, every night I

would</B>
<P><B>stay up scared of waited across the hallway in my parents room.  My</B>
<P><B>parents always kept their doorway open as did I.  I was a little kid

and</B>
<P><B>was always to afraid of the dark so I never shut my door ether.  I

don't</B>
<P><B>know exactly what I saw but I know that I saw something every night.</B>
<P><B>There was a very large shadow head staring at me from across the</B>
<P><B>hallway.  I know something was there because it had a defined eyes,</B>
<P><B>nose, and mouth.  It seemed like some kinda of leader or something
of</B>
<P><B>these little black creatures.  It would watch as the the head would</B>
<P><B>actually whisper to these little creatures.  Then the mouth opened

and</B>
<P><B>closed, all I heard was a sound like flowing air.  The worst part is</B>
<P><B>though is that the little black creatures would run across the

hallway</B>
<P><B>after a couple of minutes and enter my room.  They ran like monkeys,

for</B>
<P><B>a lack of a better comparison, and they would run straight in and

walk</B>
<P><B>around my room for a couple of seconds but then they would run into
a</B>
<P><B>dark spot under my desk and disappear.  It happened every night until

I</B>
<P><B>moved away 10 years ago.  This seemed so strange to me.  They never

made</B>
<P><B>contact with me, probably cause I never confronted one of them or

told</B>
<P><B>them to leave my room.  My parents didn't believe me though.  They

said</B>
<P><B>that I was just seeing shadows of the trees, but oddly enough the</B>
<P><B>windows in my parents room where on the back side of the house that

was</B>
<P><B>next to the neighbor's house where there was no light.  I still don't</B>
<P><B>know what to make of this but I haven't seen it scince so I am

certain</B>
<P><B>that it has to do with something odd in that house.</B>

<P><B>have been together before we met in this lifetime, but thats another</B>
<P><B>story.  Anyway, when he overdosed, the paramedics brought him  back

to</B>
<P><B>where he was in a coma for 3 days. I was there the whole time, and</B>
<P><B>before he died on the 3rd day, he squeezed my hand 3 times. This was</B>
<P><B>almost 5 years ago and I still get tears in my eyes when I think

about</B>
<P><B>it. I firmly believe he had a choice to come back, but felt so much</B>
<P><B>peace where he was at that he didn't want to come back. Later, a

psychic</B>
<P><B>whose abilities I have every confidence in, told me he was in a sort

of</B>
<P><B>limbo, that he had not walked through the door because I would not

let</B>
<P><B>him go, and he was not wanting to leave me in a state like that. She</B>
<P><B>told me I had to let him go because he died for a reason and he has
a</B>
<P><B>job to do. That night I told him to go, but by God he better be

waiting</B>
<P><B>for me when I go through the door! I totally believe he will be.

Anyway,</B>
<P><B>before he died, we made this pact that if one of us died that that

one</B>
<P><B>would come back to let the other one know we were okay. One night</B>
<P><B>shortly after he died I was sleeping on my parents couch. Something</B>
<P><B>shook me awake and I knew I was not alone in the room. However, it</B>
<P><B>scared the hell out of me, and right then  was a trail of little</B>
<P><B>different colored lights kind of swoosh up and then disappear. I then</B>
<P><B>realized that this was my husband, and he didn't want to scare me so

he</B>
<P><B>left. I begged him to come back but nothing further happened. Until

one</B>
<P><B>night when I spent the night at my friends house, the same house my</B>
<P><B>husband had died in. (I guess technically he died in the hospital,

but</B>
<P><B>this was the house he first died in, and even after the paramedics</B>
<P><B>brought him back, it was just his body that was alive.) I was sitting

in</B>
<P><B>my friends bed, staring into space, when all of a sudden something

told</B>
<P><B>me to look at the TV. It was not on, but I did, and in the reflection

I</B>
<P><B>perfectly saw my husband sitting next to me.  I turned to lookbut

there</B>
<P><B>was nothing beside me, but when I looked back in the TV he was

plainly</B>
<P><B>sitting next to me! I was so happy I started crying and even though
I</B>
<P><B>had so many things to say to him all I could say was 'I Love You!!"

and</B>
<P><B>"I Miss You!!" over and over. Then I put my hand up and said "Hold
my</B>
<P><B>hand, baby!" and he did! I felt an electricity go through my hand.
He</B>
<P><B>even moved once so he was sitting exactly where I was, like he was</B>
<P><B>superimposed over me! I felt the most beautiful electricity going</B>
<P><B>through me, but then I said, "I want to SEE you sweetheart!" and he</B>
<P><B>moved again so I could see him. I would repeatedly turn around but

never</B>
<P><B>see anything nextto me, but you could see him plain as day in the</B>
<P><B>reflection of the TV! Then I heard my friend coming into the room and

I</B>
<P><B>yelled for him to stay out, I thought hed chase mybaby away, but to

my</B>
<P><B>surprise, when my friend walked in, my husband was still there! I

told</B>
<P><B>my friend what was happening and he freaked, but not before he looked

at</B>
<P><B>the TV and saw exactly what I saw! I was so glad to have someone else</B>
<P><B>see this, as I was so overcome with grief, and I know your mind can

play</B>
<P><B>tricks on you to ease the pain. After visiting for almost 5 minutes,

I</B>
<P><B>saw part of a man behind my husband, he put his hand on his shoulder

and</B>
<P><B>I knew he was saying it was time to go. I was so grateful that he

came</B>
<P><B>at all that I didnt beg him to stay, as I wanted him to now his

coming</B>
<P><B>was a good thing, and it was. Right when my husband started to fade
I</B>
<P><B>turned and saw those very same little lights swoosh up and then he

was</B>
<P><B>gone. The reflection returned to normal. However, after this happened

I</B>
<P><B>wanted more and I cannot tell you how many hours I spent staring into</B>
<P><B>the reflection of different TV's. I never saw him again, though, and</B>
<P><B>after that happened I learned about mirror gazing,  something of which

I</B>
<P><B>previosly knew nothing about. I did have a dream in which I talked
to</B>
<P><B>him but that was later to come.</B>

<H3><A NAME=a><B>A Powerful Experience</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: christinedelaney@sprint.ca</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>All my life I have experienced the paranormal. In fact </B>
<P><B>it has been such a part of my life that I have simply grown to accept
it. I have </B>
<P><B>seen, heard and felt many things. However there is one particular

experience </B>
<P><B>from my childhood that stands out from all others. This incident occurred

in what was a thoroughly haunted </B>
<P><B>house Manifestations included: noises, flying objects, cold rooms,
</B>
<P><B>pungent and unexplainable odors and the like. My childhood was often
a </B>
<P><B>frightening one. Lets just say my parents were never religious but
I learned </B>
<P><B>quickly how to pray. It was particularly unfortunate that my bedroom
was the </B>
<P><B>epicenter of the paranormal activity. However I digress.</B>
<P><B>This incident occurred on one summer night when I found </B>
<P><B>myself all alone in that house. You see my parents and sister were
</B>
<P><B>at the neighbors across the street having a get together. And so while

</B>
<P><B>playing outside with the neighborhood kids I got hungry for a popsicle.
So </B>
<P><B>knowing we had some I went my house. At first I went to get the food

upstairs. </B>
<P><B>This was no sweat since this was not a bad part of the house--it always

felt </B>
<P><B>safer.In any case after I had gotten the </B>
<P><B>popsicle I felt the urge to urinate. I do not know why I did not opt
to go </B>
<P><B>at the neighbors since my fear of the downstairs was substantial enough
to make </B>
<P><B>my blood run cold and my heart beat fiercely in my ears. But the fact
is I went </B>
<P><B>downstairs. Now it is important to understand that I always feared
having to go </B>
<P><B>downstairs alone to go to the washroom. This is because it meant passing

the </B>
<P><B>three bedroom entrances (my parents, my own and my sisters) to get
to the end of </B>
<P><B>the hall where the washroom was(our only washroom). Nonetheless I remember

</B>
<P><B>summing up the courage to go down those stairs. Although I must say</B>
<P><B>I did this very quickly while making sure not to even look inside </B>
<P><B>the rooms while I passed them. After I finished my business in a brightly

lit </B>
<P><B>bathroom I realized I would have to face those doorways again. Not
bad I thought </B>
<P><B>since I could now keep the bathroom light on as a sort of buffer (a
lit area </B>
<P><B>somehow always feels safer huh?) It was then that I pictured my Mother,
who was </B>
<P><B>energy conscious, chastising me for keeping that bathroom light on
all </B>
<P><B>night. While I dreaded shutting it off I also did not want to upset
my </B>
<P><B>Mother. And so I shut the light off and slowly started walking down
the hallway. </B>
<P><B>I moved a lot slower this time and I remember feeling particularly
odd. It </B>
<P><B>was about then that I reached my parents bedroom doorway. This door
was the </B>
<P><B>closest to the stairs so I was almost there. It was then that all previous

</B>
<P><B>experiences with flying objects and other smaller manifestations failed
to ever </B>
<P><B>compare again. My life seriously changed when I saw it. I call it </B>
<P><B>it because I still don't know what it really was. At this </B>
<P><B>point you must understand I was situated at my parents bedroom doorway
and </B>
<P><B>looking at this thing staring at me from the window. Now this is on
a ground </B>
<P><B>floor and this window looked out onto our backyard (this detail might

help). And </B>
<P><B>so let me describe this thing before I continue. It was huge and filled
up the </B>
<P><B>very large window (which was double paned and could allow for a man
to enter </B>
<P><B>through it). Although I called this thing an it, I recognized </B>
<P><B>its form. It was a bull. But with a difference. It had the features
and the feel </B>
<P><B>of something more intelligent. I remember this experience so vividly--I

always </B>
<P><B>have. It is like it is etched in my brain. Anyways, I mostly remember
its black </B>
<P><B>muscular outline which shined with a orangy-red-white light source
from who </B>
<P><B>knows where. Its horns were very large and stretched out over its head.
Its </B>
<P><B>position was one of crouching--like when a bull is about to charge.
But instead </B>
<P><B>it was still and stared at me. My most vivid memory is of those eyes.
I </B>
<P><B>was fascinated, curious and terrified all at once. I remember squinting
to prove </B>
<P><B>whether I was really seeing this. I don't know how long I stood there
for with </B>
<P><B>this thing. aI kept staring into its eyes. Then I recall moving towards

</B>
<P><B>them. I know that the outline of its body disappeared from my visual
</B>
<P><B>frame. I was closing in on its eyes. They had glints in them, a light
in them </B>
<P><B>that I can't describe. The emotions behind them are still indescribable
to me. </B>
<P><B>For certain it was evil. And I was so totally caught in its gaze. But
this </B>
<P><B>is when my faith in Good became solid for life. Someone called out
my name. It </B>
<P><B>was a women. She was stern but not mean and very serious. I snapped
out of </B>
<P><B>it. Next I was at the bedroom entrance again and it was still there
</B>
<P><B>although I never did look directly at it again. I could feel a strong,

</B>
<P><B>warm and loving presence over my back. It was then the angel (which
I consider </B>
<P><B>it) told me (in my head all this time) to go, and to (and I quote)
Turn </B>
<P><B>around and walk away. She ordered me sternly (I simply could not refuse

</B>
<P><B>her) to go to see my Mother. When I got to the door leading to the
outside I </B>
<P><B>heard her say RUN! And she did not have to say it twice.I ran </B>
<P><B>to my Mother's side for certain. So there is my story which is 100%
</B>
<P><B>true and as I have recalled it all these years. It is quite unbelievable

</B>
<P><B>and I myself find it so sometimes. But it is so true and I would swear

</B>
<P><B>anything on it.</B>

<H3><A NAME="back'"><B>The Back Room</B></A>
</H3><P><B>BY: kwalschots@altavista.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Dave In reading your story, you have reminded me of my own situation.</B>
<P><B>I cannot remember when it all started, however I do know the tall

dark</B>
<P><B>figure that you mentioned. It came connected, I believe to the

original</B>
<P><B>ghost that dwelled at 1260 Belle Isle View, Windsor, Ontario, Canada.</B>
<P><B>While we were a family of 5, only 3 of us will ever admit to our own

seperate</B>
<P><B>experiences. My father being very "old school" scoffs at the idea</B>
<P><B>but has never verbally bashed it either. My sister is of a very

scientific</B>
<P><B>nature and didn't spend much time in the rooms where these occurances

took</B>
<P><B>place. Her bedroom was upstairs, as well as was mine for a while</B>
<P><B>and nothing ever occured there. The stairway leading up was a

different</B>
<P><B>matter. Although nothing ever happened there you always felt, even</B>
<P><B>her, as if you had to run because something was behind you. You will</B>
<P><B>have to excuse me if this letter runs a little amuck but it's been
a long</B>
<P><B>time since I've spoke of it being that we moved from the house 7

years</B>
<P><B>ago. The first stories come from my mother. Most of the sightings</B>
<P><B>take place in the back room of the house on the main floor. It was</B>
<P><B>there that she saw the ghost for the first time. It was dusk and</B>
<P><B>she was at the dresser when she looked toward the window. That was</B>
<P><B>when she saw someone in the room with her. She screamed and ran into</B>
<P><B>the next room for my father. When they returned, of course, no one</B>
<P><B>was there. (These stories are not my own experiences and are

therefore</B>
<P><B>a little choppy-however as a get older I, like yourself, seem to

become</B>
<P><B>the focus of this apparition) Another of her stories goes to the</B>
<P><B>time she was going to the store and locked up all the doors, and shut

the</B>
<P><B>windows, and turned off the lights. When she arrived home, all the</B>
<P><B>windows and doors were wide open and the lights on. Knowing that</B>
<P><B>something was wrong she got a neighbour to check out the house before

going</B>
<P><B>in. This man checked every room and there was nothing. Also,</B>
<P><B>when my brother was a baby, his room was that very back room. Every</B>
<P><B>night my mother would put him to sleep in his crib and very often,
in the</B>
<P><B>morning, he would be out of his crib, out of that room. Either on</B>
<P><B>the floor in the hall, the living room, etc. So now onto him.</B>
<P><B>Of his many experiences, there is one that stands out in my mind, one

he</B>
<P><B>never related to me until I had an experience of my own. I was on</B>
<P><B>the phone in the living room, when all of a sudden our 2 cats ran by

me</B>
<P><B>to the upstairs-the farthest point in the house from the basement.</B>
<P><B>I thought that was odd, but then cats aren't always the brightest

animals</B>
<P><B>so I continued to talk. It was then that I heard footsteps coming</B>
<P><B>up the stairs from the basement. They were quite heavy and sounded</B>
<P><B>like a large man wearing construction boots walking slowy up the

stairs,</B>
<P><B>even to pause at the top and shuffle to turn left and go up the

remaining</B>
<P><B>2 steps. Now I was really scared, told the person I was talking to</B>
<P><B>to come over and ran like hell out of the house. What was odd about</B>
<P><B>this was that in talking to my brother some time later he told me the

exact</B>
<P><B>same story-before I had told him what had happened to me. And from</B>
<P><B>then on, what continued to happen, happened to me. There are a lot</B>
<P><B>of occasions in which I came to be visited so I'll try to stick to

the</B>
<P><B>major events. My bedroom became that back room when I was about 16.</B>
<P><B>Odd occurances always took place in the house. We had a large screen</B>
<P><B>t.v. in the basement that made a deep booming sound when turned on.</B>
<P><B>This would happen, and you would hear the t.v-people talking, etc.</B>
<P><B>Only upon going down there, the t.v wasn't on at all. The television</B>
<P><B>in the room next to the back room would frequently change channel

(and</B>
<P><B>over the 17 years we lived in the house, it wasn't always the same

television)</B>
<P><B>or turn off and on as would the lights. As for my personal

relationship</B>
<P><B>with this spirit, it called me by my name and I wasn't the only

person</B>
<P><B>to here "Katie" whispered in these back 2 rooms. As a matter of fact</B>
<P><B>one night a friend was sleeping over and we were lying there watching

t.v</B>
<P><B>when the light went dim, then bright, then dim, then out followed by

someone</B>
<P><B>whispering my name in the room-we were the only 2 people in the

house.</B>
<P><B>This was so scary that my friend was up and gone despite the fact

that</B>
<P><B>it was 3 a.m. and they lived on the other side of town. At night</B>
<P><B>I would lie in bed with the cat sound asleep at my feet. Suddenly</B>
<P><B>the cat would jump up and stare at a point above my head and take off

like</B>
<P><B>a bat out of hell. There were nights when I'd wake to see a dark</B>
<P><B>figure (not the man) beside my bed watching me, and on one occasion

floating</B>
<P><B>about 2-3 feet above me-that felt very oppressive. I made the mistake</B>
<P><B>after being frightened for so long to start to talk to it. I figured</B>
<P><B>that if it was going to hurt me it would have done so by then.</B>
<P><B>I started to feel the presence stronger and more often. Then I made</B>
<P><B>the mistake of going so far as to tell it when I would be leaving the

house</B>
<P><B>and when I would be coming back - even if I couldn't feel it there.</B>
<P><B>After doing this for about a week, I'd come home at night and it was

as</B>
<P><B>if the house was looking at me, watching, waiting. This began to</B>
<P><B>really scare me and I stopped talking to it. Then we put the house</B>
<P><B>up for sale and things really began to get weird. My parents split</B>
<P><B>up, my mother left home, my dad stayed at his girlfriend's, my sister

had</B>
<P><B>long since moved out-which left my brother, who would stay at his

girlfriend's</B>
<P><B>house most nights and me. It was as if the spirit knew I was about</B>
<P><B>to leave forever. I heard my name called every night at least once</B>
<P><B>a night without fail. The lights in the back room turned themselves</B>
<P><B>off and on. The basement was so full of bad vibes that people who</B>
<P><B>didn't know of the situation would still say things like "It feels

very</B>
<P><B>strange down here" And to further add to the situation, if I went</B>
<P><B>down to play pool when I was angry about something, my anger would

escalate</B>
<P><B>to a fury until I would finally leave-usually after having thrown a

ball</B>
<P><B>at the brick fireplace. Like I said it's been a while since I've</B>
<P><B>spoken of this house, and there are seperate incidences that could
be discussed</B>
<P><B>in further detail. Now on to the tall dark man. It was early</B>
<P><B>in the morning and my brother had just left for school. I was asleep</B>
<P><B>on the couch and half-watched him leave. About 5 minutes later I</B>
<P><B>heard a noise in the kitchen. I figured my brother had forgotten</B>
<P><B>something and came back through the side door. I opened my eyes only</B>
<P><B>slightly when I saw the cat run like hell for the upstairs. I kept</B>
<P><B>a watch at the hall but with my eyes still half closed as though I

was</B>
<P><B>still asleep. It was then that I saw a tall (about 7 feet) dark

figure</B>
<P><B>of a man lean around the corner and look at me, then continue down

the</B>
<P><B>hall, the closet door swung open as he walked past into the back room

where</B>
<P><B>I heard the sound of someone searching-looking through drawers and

shuffling</B>
<P><B>papers. I jumped off the couch and ran out the front door so scared</B>
<P><B>that it didn't matter that I was wearing just underwear and a

t-shirt.</B>
<P><B>There have been accounts of people visiting the house when no one was

home</B>
<P><B>and as they were leaving seeing a tall dark figure with his arms

crossed</B>
<P><B>watching from the front bay window. As for the history of the house,</B>
<P><B>I can't say for sure.The house is built on old farmland (isn't

everything</B>
<P><B>though?) and there are rumours of Indian grounds. My mother told</B>
<P><B>me there was an epileptic boy who lived in the house before us, who

had</B>
<P><B>a seizure while in the shower and died. This is very believable being</B>
<P><B>that there is always a cold breeze coming from behind, no matter how

hot</B>
<P><B>the shower and often bottles falling from the shelves. There were</B>
<P><B>also times when I felt someone tap me on the shoulder or tug on my

shirt,</B>
<P><B>only to find that there was no one there. On the day of the move</B>
<P><B>the house was filled with a thick feeling of sorrow. Not only my</B>
<P><B>sorrow of leaving the house I lived in my whole life, but also the

spirits</B>
<P><B>sorrow for losing me and I, now, it. The spirit had grown to be,</B>
<P><B>no matter how terrifying, a part of me it seemed. The house was in</B>
<P><B>a very good part of town with 4 bedrooms, a finished basement

complete</B>
<P><B>with pool table and fireplace, and an inground pool in the yard,

however</B>
<P><B>we had a very difficult time selling it. In the end, it was a

minister</B>
<P><B>and his wife who bought the place. An odd coincidence? Often</B>
<P><B>I have wanted to go back and ask if they themselves have had any

strange</B>
<P><B>experiences, and do still pass by the house quite frequently, but

have</B>
<P><B>never had the nerve to go and knock on the door. Maybe one day I</B>
<P><B>will. I am sure you get a lot of people sending you false accounts</B>
<P><B>but I swear on my life to everything I have written here and much

like</B>
<P><B>yourself take the matter very seriously. In reading your account I
do feel</B>
<P><B>a sort of bond with you. Probably because I have never heard anyone</B>
<P><B>else talk of the tall dark man who never had anything to do with the

past</B>
<P><B>hauntings but was a very strong presence once there.</B>

<H3><A NAME=hotel><B>Hotel Casino</B></A>
</H3><P><B>BY:	ZEROANJEL@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I worked as a security guard there when it was closed down for a while.
It is </B>
<P><B>an old hotel-casino. I worked a graveyard shift and I patrolled the
entire </B>
<P><B>place alone. Several times I would hear doors and large object movements
on </B>
<P><B>other floors and sometimes nearby. I never thought much about it or
jumped at </B>
<P><B>any menacing ideas; I was used to sounds in the dead of the night for
no </B>
<P><B>reason. Then one night while wandering about in a long hallway I began
to </B>
<P><B>notice a strange reverberation to my footsteps, so I stopped. The sound

</B>
<P><B>reverb stopped a split second after mine. I immediately turned thinking

</B>
<P><B>someone was fooling about, but no one was there. So I continued my
pace still </B>
<P><B>the sound started up. I thought maybe it was an echo of sorts, so I
walked </B>
<P><B>more loudly, still i heard the sound but it was not at an increased
sound </B>
<P><B>level. I ran then stopped. And the sound shuffled to a stop at a different

</B>
<P><B>rythym than I had. I have been a martial artist for close to 20 years
and </B>
<P><B>feel I have a pretty firm grasp on life energys and proven to peers
that I </B>
<P><B>can sense others prescence through this energy. That night I felt something

</B>
<P><B>there standing there. So, i broke into a full sprint for a few feet
stopped </B>
<P><B>and turned to still try to find some giveaway of a prank or self dillusion.

</B>
<P><B>When I turned I felt a prescence standing face to face with me. My

adrenaline </B>
<P><B>sky-rocketed and I bolted though the end of the hallway and down the
stair </B>
<P><B>well. I heard the foot steps trying to keep pace with me until I had
burst </B>
<P><B>through the heavy metal door at the end of the hall. From that night
on I </B>
<P><B>could feel a prescence moving from floor to floor, which I always avoided

</B>
<P><B>from there on. Keep in mind that no pranksters could have gotten in
and had </B>
<P><B>they, they would have shown up on the other security systems.</B>

<P>
<P><B>It all started at Christmas I don't remember the year only that we

were</B>
<P><B>watching the 1st show of the X-files,when the christmas tree branch</B>
<P><B>stared swinging,yes that scared us but  then we start saying "Oh we

have</B>
<P><B>a ghost".</B>
<P><B>We started  hearing strange thing like something falling but nothing</B>
<P><B>would be out of place. I did see something in my room up in the corner,

it</B>
<P><B>looked like a prism all white and about the size of your hand, I

asked</B>
<P><B>it if she was Felisha, (my oldest daughter says it told her it was
her name</B>
<P><B>and she was 12). It didn't do anything when I asked it just

disapeared.</B>
<P><B>Then quite ofton a small pinlight would race around the ceiling of
my</B>
<P><B>room, or you would see something out of the corner of your eye at

times.</B>
<P><B>There are so many thing it did I can't even start to tell, I do know</B>
<P><B>that we were never afraid and we liked having here around. </B>
<P><B>The only thing I  that bothered me is she scared our cat to death,
I had</B>
<P><B>my brother to come and put it to sleep, my poor cat would hide under</B>
<P><B>covers or pillows to get away from her, would not go into any room

that</B>
<P><B>Felisha might have been in.</B>
<P><B>Since she came to us at</B>
<P><B>christmas we joked we were going to put up a stocking for her that

year</B>
<P><B>we did not, but the next year when all the stockings were hung</B>
<P><B>we joked again about it till I was setting on the couch and all the</B>
<P><B>stockings flew off the wall         needless to say Felisha got her</B>
<P><B>stocking and we hung it every year. We also had a christmas bear that</B>
<P><B>would play music, it was hard to get it to play, but everytime you

came</B>
<P><B>home the bear would start playing. Thats how I got My friend to

believe</B>
<P><B>me and did they get freaked out when your just sittng there and the

bear</B>
<P><B>starts playing music, we thought it was a defect so we took out the</B>
<P><B>batterys, it was still her favorite toy and it stayed out all year

long.</B>
<P><B>When we moved from the house we hoped that Felisha would go with us,</B>
<P><B>sure enough she did when we were unpacking we heard the bear, we were</B>
<P><B>happy but I don't think she liked the mountains,because when my neice</B>
<P><B>came to see me(she was alway in aw with Felisha) we</B>
<P><B>did't see or have any more signs that she was with us and my neice

said</B>
<P><B>some pretty strange things were happening in her home.</B>
<P><B>Know one really believes this when I tell them but everything I have

said</B>
<P><B>is the truth and would like to have Felisha with us again. My new</B>
<P><B>husband thinks I'm nuts but what can I say.</B>
<P><B>Thanks for your websight, I truely believe,I'm just glad Felisha was</B>
<P><B>friendly and that no-one was afraid of her and we always looked

forward</B>
<P><B>to what she would do to let us know she was around. </B>
<P><B>                              A believer.</B>

<H3><A NAME=cat><B>Ghost Cat</B></A>
</H3><P>
<P><B>By:  ishmail@world-link.com.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>After reading the ghost stories posted here, I was shocked to </B>
<P><B>find a story that closely resembled an experience of my own.</B>
<P><B>I thought that, since this has happened elsewhere, it just might reassure

</B>
<P><B>my doubting coscience that this actually happened to me.</B>
<P><B>I now live in Australia, but when I was a child growingg up in </B>
<P><B>the Western New York area, my parents had purchased a new house in
a newly </B>
<P><B>developing area.The houses were brand new in a new area, but the </B>
<P><B>construction sites were deadly for any cats that might have been feral
at that </B>
<P><B>time. I was six years old when we moved in, so I didn't pay much attention

</B>
<P><B>to ghostly details, but my 8 year old brother immediately remarked
on things not </B>
<P><B>feeling right in the house. For the next 12 years, as long as </B>
<P><B>I lived there, we were victimized by our own Ghost Cat, although I
</B>
<P><B>am not so keen to accept that it was actually a ghost. The </B>
<P><B>most occurances happened to my brother, who almost regularly felt the
feet of an </B>
<P><B>advancing cat upon his blankets, which would slowly creep towards his

</B>
<P><B>head. We had a cat at the time, so when this happened he would reach
down </B>
<P><B>with his hand to first check if it was the real cat or the </B>
<P><B>ghost cat, and when he found nothing there he would flip the </B>
<P><B>blankets up into the air to get rid of the ghost. All too often the
ghost </B>
<P><B>cat would simply jump back on, and the proceedure would start anew.
This </B>
<P><B>happened a few times to myself and my parents as well, the scariest
bit about it </B>
<P><B>being the paw prints visible as it walked towards me! Of the few times
that it </B>
<P><B>happened to me, I believe one of them was the most severe of all our
</B>
<P><B>occurances. Our cat at the time, Tigger, was sleeping with me on my
</B>
<P><B>pillow. During the middle of the night Tigger jumped up and hissed.</B>
<P><B>I opened my eyes to see what she was startled by, but there was nothing
to </B>
<P><B>see! Of course, I immediately assumed Ghost Cat, but I tried </B>
<P><B>to consider other possibilities before fully freaking out. Tigger lashed

</B>
<P><B>out, and then ran to the side of the bed, looking over the edge. I
thought </B>
<P><B>she may have chased something small that I didnt see, like a mouse
or bug, over </B>
<P><B>the edge. So I peered over the edge to see what she was now growling
</B>
<P><B>at. But there was nothing that I could see! Of course, it was dark,
</B>
<P><B>so I thought my eyes were simply unable to see the bug or whatever
that she had </B>
<P><B>chased. However, suddenly Tigger was flipped onto her back as if something

</B>
<P><B>had jumped back up from the floor and attacked her, and bugs certainly

aren't </B>
<P><B>that strong. For about half a minute I watched amazed as Tigger fought

</B>
<P><B>with nothing! When I finally shook off the shock I grabbed ahjold of
my </B>
<P><B>flailing puss and ran out of the room to the safety of my parent's
</B>
<P><B>bedroom. I was very frightened, but still not perfectly convinced that
it </B>
<P><B>was in fact a ghost, skeptical of that sort of thing in my teen years.
I </B>
<P><B>always thought I had a very healthy imagination, you see. But then,
within </B>
<P><B>a couple days of this incident Tigger became very ill. We took her
to the </B>
<P><B>vet, and he had to keep her for a while to find out what was wrong
with </B>
<P><B>her.&amp;nbsp; He found a scratch that went in a straight line from
the middle of </B>
<P><B>one hind leg, all the way up to the base of her neck. Because of the
way </B>
<P><B>that cat's move, it is very strange to find such a long scratch on
their </B>
<P><B>bodies. The wound also was infected, and surgery had to be </B>
<P><B>performed. After a few days, Tigger had died of the strange </B>
<P><B>infection/illness that our vet, after consulting the Veterinary School
at </B>
<P><B>Cornell University, could only describe as being documented only </B>
<P><B>about four times in the history of vetrinary medicine. Today I am still
a </B>
<P><B>bit skeptical, but reading a story that featured a similar ghost cat
</B>
<P><B>revived old fears and wonder. After reading my story, perhaps others
</B>
<P><B>recognize some details as familiar? What do you think? Am I </B>
<P><B>nuts? I am still lookin for answers after all these years. Please </B>
<P><B>email me if you have also met a ghost cat</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Well the story starts with a close friend of my family. Lydia</B>
<P><B>has been going through a very tough time over the past few months.</B>
<P><B>To make a long story short, this friend has been suffering severe</B>
<P><B>menopause symptoms. Severe hemorrhaging and her blood level has been</B>
<P><B>very low over the past several months. She has been in and out of</B>
<P><B>the hospital, on many different drugs to help control this but

nothing</B>
<P><B>seemed to be working. A couple of days ago she had been feeling at</B>
<P><B>her worst and was getting very scared. The gynecologist had told</B>
<P><B>her that surgery had to wait (hysterectomy) until her blood level

came</B>
<P><B>up which could be months. So she was waiting and her condition</B>
<P><B>was getting worse. On Thursday (April 29th) she took her son</B>
<P><B>to his karate class and decided not to go in with him because she was

feeling</B>
<P><B>very weak. She didn't go home but stayed in the car and waited.</B>
<P><B>When the class was just about over she decided to go in and get him.</B>
<P><B>She met one of the other mothers inside and she told her "you don't

look</B>
<P><B>very well" and Lydia responded "no, I'm very weak today". Lydia</B>
<P><B>had spoken with this lady many times in the past and she had told her

that</B>
<P><B>she is able to speak with angels. Guardian angels?? I'm not</B>
<P><B>sure but, the other mother proceeded by telling her "I will say a</B>
<P><B>pray for you tonight, and ask your guardian angel to watch over you"</B>
<P><B>Lydia went home and never thought twice about what the lady said.</B>
<P><B>Morning came and Lydia was feeling worse than she did the day before.</B>
<P><B>She was getting ready to start her day when the phone rang. It was</B>
<P><B>the mother from her sons karate class. Lydia was puzzled as to why</B>
<P><B>she was calling since she only knows her from karate. This lady

proceeded</B>
<P><B>to tell her that she did pray for her last night but had spoken with

Lydia's</B>
<P><B>angel. She said that things did not look very good for her and she

was</B>
<P><B>to call her doctor right away. Needless to say that freaked Lydia.</B>
<P><B>She called her specialist and the receptionist said the doctor had</B>
<P><B>gone away for the weekend. She asked Lydia what was wrong and all</B>
<P><B>she could say was "all I know is that I need to contact the doctor"</B>
<P><B>The receptionist said she would not be speaking with him until Monday

but</B>
<P><B>she will give him the message. Lydia hung up the phone and was very</B>
<P><B>confused. Seconds later the phone rang and it was the Dr's office.</B>
<P><B>The receptionist said "I don't understand this but the doctor just

called</B>
<P><B>in (which he never has done before) and he himself doesn't know why

but</B>
<P><B>wanted to know if there were any messages for him" The receptionist</B>
<P><B>gave the doctor's only message, which was from Lydia. The doctor</B>
<P><B>in tern booked her in for a hysterectomy for Wednesday the 5th, on

his</B>
<P><B>day off because he is booked up.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Coincidence?? Maybe. All I know is Someone</B>
<P><B>is watching over her</B>

<H3><A NAME=church><B>The Haunted Church</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: thehalls@conninc.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>HI I am 19 years old I live in Morganton </B>
<P><B>NC. This is a ghost sighting that happened to me once before. About
</B>
<P><B>1993 I went to a church that was kinda of old with paint chipping off.
One </B>
<P><B>day I was in a bible school lesson. There where two </B>
<P><B>rooms down stairs, the only thing that sperated the</B>
<P><B>rooms was a big sliding door. One room was for </B>
<P><B>real young childern, and the other was for teenagers.</B>
<P><B>While we was in the middle of a lesson, I saw </B>
<P><B>something move through the crack of the door. I didn't</B>
<P><B>think anything of it at the time so I continued </B>
<P><B>the lesson. But this time I saw it, the thing that stuck</B>
<P><B>through the door looked like a hand with red </B>
<P><B>fingernails, it appeared to have held a piece of cardboard.</B>
<P><B>I got scared but didn't say anything. A few </B>
<P><B>minutes later a Boy from across the table saw it to and told everybody
but they </B>
<P><B>didn't believe him until I told them that I had saw it too. After the

</B>
<P><B>lesson we went into the other room and asked them if they saw anything

wierd, </B>
<P><B>but they said they didn't see a thing.I realy got scared and never
went back to that </B>
<P><B>church again.</B>

<H3><A NAME=tale><B>A Short Tale</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: mcooper@dlcwest.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> I am writing you with some interesting </B>
<P><B>occurrences which have taken place in the home my wife and I rent.
We first </B>
<P><B>moved here nearly a year ago and have had some interesting experiences.
The </B>
<P><B>basement of the house is old and crumbling. When you walk down the
stairs you </B>
<P><B>get an instant feeling of unease. At the base of the stairs there is
a door to </B>
<P><B>your immediate left. This door when opened reveals a room which has
a dirt slope </B>
<P><B>that runs up to ground level where there is a small door which opens
to the </B>
<P><B>outside. I presume that this is a coal chute from days gone by. I have
only </B>
<P><B>twice opened that door. Both times I was assailed by a horrible stench
and a </B>
<P><B>feeling of uncontrollable fear. I must make a note at this time that
I am not an </B>
<P><B>overly fearless person, nor do I quake in my boots when I hear a strange

noise, </B>
<P><B>and I have heard many of those in our previous apartment, but that
is another </B>
<P><B>story. </B>
<P><B> Those are my only experiences with the </B>
<P><B>door, though I believe that it has something to do with our house and
its </B>
<P><B>oddities. In the center of the basement there is the new gas furnace
and the </B>
<P><B>water heater. The washer and dryer are directly ahead when you walk
down the </B>
<P><B>stairs, and in the opposite corner from them (to your left when you
are at the </B>
<P><B>bottom of the stairs) is a spot. I have never noticed that it is a
'cold spot' </B>
<P><B>but it is certainly a location that my cats don't like. We have to
keep the </B>
<P><B>basement door closed or else they will walk around it and meow for
hours. My </B>
<P><B>wife will not enter the basement after dark.</B>
<P><B> That is the preamble, now for the odd </B>
<P><B>occurrences. The most harmless is the bathroom light. It is almost
always on. </B>
<P><B>It's not just poor wiring, the switch is constantly flipping up. My
wife is more </B>
<P><B>sensitive to these things than I and she sometimes sees things. Once
she saw the </B>
<P><B>infamous man in a black hat walk past one of our windows. It was right
near the </B>
<P><B>back door and she looked outside and did not see anyone. There is about
a 300 </B>
<P><B>foot run to the nearest cover, so I don't think that anyone was in
our yard. </B>
<P><B>Later she took a picture while standing here and there appeared on
the print </B>
<P><B>what looks like one of the vortexes shown on this site, only it was
black. As a </B>
<P><B>note, this place is right where the small wooden door to the room with
the </B>
<P><B>stench is. </B>
<P><B> Other than the cats and the light nothing </B>
<P><B>else happens except for one time our presence took the bread out of
the fridge </B>
<P><B>tore it up all down the basement stairs and then left several whole
pieces in </B>
<P><B>'the spot'. The loaf was full, minus one piece I ate before bed, in
the morning </B>
<P><B>the bag was back in the fridge with only the crusts inside. The twist
tie was </B>
<P><B>done up. That one completely inexplicable piece of evidence is the
final </B>
<P><B>incident that pushed me to believe for certain that our house has other

</B>
<P><B>presences in it. As a final note, it would seem that an old lady and
her husband </B>
<P><B>both lived in the house until their separate deaths, caused innocently
by old </B>
<P><B>age. Between that time and now the house was rented out to a series
of </B>
<P><B>individuals who did drugs and partied heavily.  </B>
<P><B> Nothing terribly serious, but interesting. </B>
