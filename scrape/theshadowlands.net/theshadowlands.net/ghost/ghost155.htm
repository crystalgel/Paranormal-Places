<b>Strange Dream</b>
<p><b>By: janicer@Princeton.EDU</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I've posted to this web site before and have something else I would
like</b>
<br><b>to share.&nbsp; It was 1986 and I was 18 years old when this occurred.&nbsp;
My sister and I were on our way home from a Bruce Springsteen concert and
I had fallen asleep in the car.&nbsp; I had a very vivid dream that my
boyfriend at the time was involved in a car accident.&nbsp; So vivid as
a matter of the fact that I dreamt that there were four people in the car.&nbsp;
Him and his friend Sean and two girls that I did not know.&nbsp; I woke
up and said out loud, "Bobby's been in an accident!"&nbsp; I didn't get
the impression that it was fatal but that they were hurt.&nbsp; My sister
said that it was just a dream and not to be upset but I knew in my heart
that it wasn't.&nbsp; When I got home it was pretty late, probably about
1:30 a.m. I went into my bedroom to get changed all the while resisting
the urge to call Bobby and confirm what I already knew.&nbsp; I felt that
if it was indeed just a dream it was too late to call though.&nbsp; As
I was wrestling with this my phone rang and it was Bobby telling me that
he and Sean had been in a car accident.&nbsp; That in and of itself was
strange but he had also been cheating on me and there were two girls in
the car with them! No one was hurt too badly, just as I had thought, but
there were injuries.&nbsp; Just thought I'd share.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.</b>

<br><b>The Ghost of my Grand-dad</b>
<p><b>By: britinnd@webtv.net</b>
<p><b>Hi,my story is very personal as it was not a haunted house I lived
in as</b>
<br><b>a child, but a visit from my deceased grandad.Just to outline why
I</b>
<br><b>believe he came to me was that I was raised by both him and my</b>
<br><b>grandmother in England from 9 days old till 10 years old.For all
intents</b>
<br><b>and purposes they were "parents.I was 14 in 1976 and my grandad
had been</b>
<br><b>slowly going down hill from his battle with scherosis of the liver.He</b>
<br><b>had been in hospital for a couple of months and we knew he wouldn't
be</b>
<br><b>spending that xmas with us.He died at 3.58 am on october 7th 1976
with</b>
<br><b>my grand mother by his bed.She had had all the monitors,IVs,tubes,pumps</b>
<br><b>and everything else that was keeping him"alive"removed so that he
may</b>
<br><b>die with dignity in a side room,privatly without the impersonal
ambiance</b>
<br><b>of intensive care.I was devastated about this loss and automatically</b>
<br><b>went into an hysterical crying fit,this went on for 2 weeks,I didn't</b>
<br><b>eat,sleep much,stayed out of school and in general became very ill
&amp;</b>
<br><b>depressed.I vaguely recall the funeral but was very over come.I
was a 14</b>
<br><b>year old girl who had lost the most important man in my life and
it was</b>
<br><b>killing me.One day I recall getting up to go to the bathroom and
hearing</b>
<br><b>my mum telling my&nbsp; dad that they should take me to a psychiatrist
due to</b>
<br><b>my emotional state.I went back to bed and cried,telling my grand&nbsp;
dad</b>
<br><b>that I wish he was here,eventually crying myself to sleep.Now most</b>
<br><b>nights before going to bed my dad would check up on me and in that
half</b>
<br><b>asleep/half awake state I was aware of his visits.This particular
night</b>
<br><b>I was turning over but found that I was stuck to my bed,on my right
side</b>
<br><b>and totally unable to move.It was that dead weight type of feeling
one</b>
<br><b>gets with the tingling sensation&nbsp; like when your leg falls
asleep but,</b>
<br><b>this had no sensation,just weight.I was scared and this caused me
to</b>
<br><b>look across directly at my bedroom door.In the doorway, dimly lit
by my</b>
<br><b>night light,I saw the dark grey,not black figure of a heavy set
man</b>
<br><b>outlined but yet I could see through it kind of.The left arm was
out</b>
<br><b>stretched toward me but I dare not move.After what now seems roughly
30</b>
<br><b>seconds to a minute the shape dissapeared and I felt a sense of
calm.I</b>
<br><b>was hungry and fixed a cheese and pickle sandwich for myself.I went
back</b>
<br><b>to bed but oddly enough this incident didn't bother me really.I
woke up</b>
<br><b>the next day,showered,dressed,put a little make up on to hide the
bug</b>
<br><b>eyes I had and went down stairs.My mum was washing dishes and my
dad was</b>
<br><b>reading the paper and they both commented on my presence and more
so</b>
<br><b>state of apparant well being.I knew I guess deep down that it was
my</b>
<br><b>grand dad who visited but although I had no proof or words to back
it</b>
<br><b>up(from grand dad) I still wanted to test my feeling.I asked my
dad if</b>
<br><b>he had come in my room and he said no.He said "we didn't hear any</b>
<br><b>noises, crying etc, so we thought we would let you sleep in peace".I</b>
<br><b>said "well in that case it was grand dad who came to see me".With
that</b>
<br><b>remark my mum through the dish towell into the sink and said"thats</b>
<br><b>it,we're taking her to a doctor".Fortunatly my dad stepped in and</b>
<br><b>suggested they hear me out.He believed me or at least looking</b>
<br><b>back,pacified me as it obviously made me feel better so he went
along</b>
<br><b>with my "visit from grand dad " story.My mum didn't believe me but
it</b>
<br><b>didn't matter,I believed it.This isn't the end, although I only
had one</b>
<br><b>visit,grand dad did appear to my grand mother.Ironically when I
called</b>
<br><b>her up to tell her,she went very quiet and said that the very same
night</b>
<br><b>he came to her too.She said she couldn't sleep and went to his study
to</b>
<br><b>sort papers,approx. 4 am,roughly the same hour he died,(I don't
know</b>
<br><b>what time my visit occured,she said she felt like someone was behind</b>
<br><b>her.She was sitting at his desk,crying,when she felt a gentle touch
on</b>
<br><b>her shoulder.She said she brushed it off sharply as it scared her
and</b>
<br><b>she turned around.Nothing was ther but she felt something.She said
she</b>
<br><b>stopped crying and felt better.These were the only 2 incidents,no
one</b>
<br><b>else had a&nbsp; visit from grand dad but we both know (gran and
I) that he</b>
<br><b>came to us to comfort.We loved him more than anything and he us.(my
mum</b>
<br><b>fell out with my grand parents so the closeness was not between
them).We</b>
<br><b>both were hit the hardest and he knew it,he came to let us know
to go</b>
<br><b>on,I feel,without the suffering that we were both enduring since
his</b>
<br><b>death.My grand mother lived till 1995,ironically dying on her 83
rd</b>
<br><b>birthday.My grand mother promised me that if she could she would
visit</b>
<br><b>me after she died,she didn't.I lit 2 white candles in her appt.
after I</b>
<br><b>had packed it all up and sat there in silence awaiting her visit,nothing</b>
<br><b>happened but I know she's ok.She was burried as per her wish with
grand</b>
<br><b>dad and finally they were together.That made me happy,they had been</b>
<br><b>married and in love since 1932,school sweetheats,survived wars and
hard</b>
<br><b>times and now eternally peaceful.Love is very powerful and although
its</b>
<br><b>hit and miss amongst those whom I tell this to in regards to belief,I</b>
<br><b>know it happened and why.</b>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I've seen two of these things. I've known people who have seen them.
And</b>
<br><b>I have seen videos of them on TV that people have filmed, and say
that</b>
<br><b>they are ghosts.</b>
<br><b>First time I was at my grandparents house, which they seem to think
is</b>
<br><b>haunted. They joke about it because they are very religious, and
have</b>
<br><b>trouble incorporating their beliefs with their senses.</b>
<br><b>I was going to bed and was having to share a bed with my grandfather
who</b>
<br><b>was already long since asleep. I crawled into bed and lay there
for a</b>
<br><b>while, my eyes adjusting to the darkness. Eventually my eyes focused
on</b>
<br><b>the brightest object in the room. What appeared to be a reflection.
I</b>
<br><b>stared at it for maybe fifteen minutes before a realization hit
me. It</b>
<br><b>WAS the brightest thing in the room. I considered, maybe there's</b>
<br><b>something outside brighter that its shining off of. But my grandparents</b>
<br><b>live in the sticks, and have only one light outside, and its quite
some</b>
<br><b>ways from the house. I had originally thought that it was a reflection</b>
<br><b>from the brass hinges on a door. After deducing that this light
was of</b>
<br><b>its own source, I investigated.</b>
<br><b>I got out of bed and walked up to it. The closer I got, the more
apparent</b>
<br><b>it became that this was not a mere reflection. It didn't move much.
It</b>
<br><b>hovered there, like a green rip in space/time, waiting. I expiramented
a</b>
<br><b>little by turning on the light. It stayed there for a split second
after</b>
<br><b>the light came on then disappeared. I wasn't able to go back to
sleep for</b>
<br><b>a while.</b>
<br><b>Second time I actually saw one, I was at my in-laws, lying in bed
with my</b>
<br><b>wife. It was near the ceiling above our heads. I woke my wife up
and</b>
<br><b>asked her if she saw it. She said she did, then went back to sleep.
I</b>
<br><b>watched it until it disappeared. After it was gone, I woke her back
up</b>
<br><b>and asked her if she could still see it. She said that she could
not, and</b>
<br><b>went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Inbetween those times, I was at a known haunted house. (Unknown
to us,</b>
<br><b>but known to the occupants.) We were staying the night, and while
some of</b>
<br><b>us were in the kitchen, two of my friends burst out of their rooms
asking</b>
<br><b>for flashlights or candles. They refused to go to sleep without
them.</b>
<br><b>They told us of an object they originally thought was a glow in
the dark</b>
<br><b>mini frisbee. Only it didn't move like a frisbee.</b>
<br><b>I don't know what these things are, but I would very much like to
study</b>
<br><b>them.</b>

<br><b>Pounding in the Night</b>
<p><b>By: Liberty@wavegate.com.</b>
<p><b>I was around 10 or 11 years old, growing up in Georgia, when this
started to take place.&nbsp; I lived with my parents, 2 brothers , and
2 sisters in a rather nice ranch style brick home.&nbsp; My father had
built this home when I was around 4-5 years old, and no one had ever passed
away in it. My 2 brothers were 5 &amp; 6 years older than I,&nbsp; 1 sister
was 7 years older, and the other sister was around 1 or 2 years old when
this happened.&nbsp; This all started very suddenly.&nbsp; I and my 2 brothers
slept in one room, in custom made bunkbeds that my father had built into
the room.&nbsp; They were built in an upside down "L" shape, with the main
bunks on the right and a single bed coming off the main bunks from the
head of the beds going towards the left.&nbsp; My oldest brother slept
in the single bed, my other brother slept in the bottom bunk, and I slept
on the top bunk.&nbsp; There were 2 windows over the single bed that my
oldest brother slept in, and during the summer these were kept open so
that the attic fan would pull cool air in.&nbsp; Sorry for so</b>
<br><b>much detail, but it helps one to understand the rest of the story.
One night we had gone to bed and around 2-3 in the morning my oldest brother
was jarred awake by a tremendous pounding on the other side of the&nbsp;
brick wall&nbsp; where he slept, outside.&nbsp; He woke both of us up very
quietly, and we listened as the pounding went across the wall as if someone
was walking the length of half of the house and back, pounding on the brick
wall&nbsp; as they went.&nbsp; Now this wasn't like someone was pounding
with their fists or even kicking the house.&nbsp; We probably couldn't
have even heard someone who was hitting the wall with their fists or feet.&nbsp;
No, this sounded as if someone had a 15 or 20</b>
<br><b>lb. rock or something very heavy and solid and was pounding the
wall with it as they walked back and forth, with the impacts coming approximately
1-2 seconds apart.&nbsp; After some very frightening few minutes had passed,&nbsp;
my oldest brother slipped into our father and mother's room and awakened
our father, telling him about what was going on.&nbsp; My father, not pleased
with being awakened at this hour, didn't really believe him at first but
quietly made his way to our room where the pounding was still going on.&nbsp;
As this was summer, he looked out the open window through the screen, but
couldn't see anyone.&nbsp; He then proceeded to collect his 20 guage pump
shotgun, and slipped out the door on the opposite side of the house from
the pounding to try to sneak up on whoever was doing it.&nbsp; As Daddy
turned the corner of the house with the shotgun at the ready, the pounding
suddenly stopped. Daddy had a flashlight of course, and there was nothing
to hide behind for at least 30 to 40 feet, where our corn field started.&nbsp;
He searched around for a bit but couldn't find anything and came back in.&nbsp;
As soon as he came in the house the pounding started again.&nbsp; He went
out immediately.&nbsp; When he turned the corner it stopped again.&nbsp;
This was repeated several times, always with the same results.&nbsp; These
happenings then continued for the next 2-3 months, almost every night.&nbsp;
My father never did find anyone or anything that could account for it.&nbsp;
There were also no marks or any kind of evidence to show where the pounding
was being done on the bricks.&nbsp; One night my brother that slept underneath
me was having a dream about playing basketball in a tournament at school,
when the pounding started.&nbsp; As the pounding was going up and down
the wall, he was dreaming that he had missed a shot and the coach had called
him to the sideline.&nbsp; He dreamed that the coach was mad at him and
while asleep he was moaning and making some kinds of noise.&nbsp; My oldest
brother who slept under the windows was trying to listen to the pounding
to figure out where it was at during that time and when my other brother
started moaning he reached over and grabbed him by the&nbsp; hair of the
head and started pulling his hair to try to shut him up.&nbsp; At this
time in the dream, my other brother was dreaming that the coach had grabbed
his hair and was pulling it for him missing the shot.&nbsp; We have always
laughed about this&nbsp; happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, my father
never did catch anyone or anything pounding on the wall, and we still wonder
to this day what it could have been.&nbsp; If anyone else out there has
had something similar with pounding on the walls and moving back and forth,
I would&nbsp; appreciate hearing from them.</b>

<p><b>"Phone Call?"</b>
<p><b>By: big_a_69er@hotmail.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This is really weird because it happen about 2 days ago. My house
doesn't</b>
<br><b>have any history of weird stuff or haunting, that's what made it
strange.</b>
<br><b>I've lived in this house for about 6 years now, I'm 17 and I had
not yet experienced anything like this. It's not really a haunting, but
I thought it was really weird. It was about 1:00am and I was in my room
on the Internet, I was looking at the Shadowlands web site. Both my parents
were asleep and nobody else was in the house other than me. My parents
were in their room which is all the way across the house, the living room,
the kitchen, the</b>
<br><b>family room and a small hallway separate my room from theirs. The
only lights that were on were the ones in my room because I was on the
computer. As I was looking trough the web site I heard my name whispered
in my ear, so I stopped and looked around to see who had whispered, but
saw nobody. So then I started to get chills and decided to go to bed. So
I turned off the computer, and this was now about 1:20am. As I was getting
ready to go to bed the phone started to ring, so I turned on the lights
of the hallway to go to</b>
<br><b>the living room. As I went to go see who it was on my caller ID,
it read "Unavailable" so then I picked up the phone. When I picked up the
phone I said "hello", but nobody answered, again I said "hello", but again
nobody answered. I started to get pissed but I tried to listen to see if
I could hear anything,&nbsp; what I heard gave me chills. As I started
to listen I heard whispering that sounded like mumbling, I couldn't make
out what was being said. It was like if someone or something wanted to
tell me something but</b>
<br><b>couldn't. I was really freaky, so I hung up the phone and I just
sat on the</b>
<br><b>couch looking around for anything unusual. When I finally got up
to go back</b>
<br><b>to my room I got the worst feeling that somebody or something was
watching</b>
<br><b>me. As I got to my room, I went straight to sleep. The next morning
felt</b>
<br><b>like if nothing had happen.</b>

<br><b>The House Of Many Tenants</b>
<p><b>By: SanguinePrincess</b>
<p><b>The House is well over 200 years old, and has many tennants over
the years.&nbsp; I was eightteen when we first moved in. It was a four
bedroom house with high celings, an attic and basement.&nbsp; My parents
and nephew had the two down stairs bedrooms.</b>
<br><b>Which left me the two upstairs rooms.&nbsp; The first night we moved
in my firend and I where setting up one of the upstairs rooms as my bedroom
as we where standing in the hall by the bathroom a little boy ran out of
the other bedroom, ran down the hall towards up, peaked around the corner
and ran into the bathroom.&nbsp; We went into the bathroom and no one was
there. Let me explain this couldn't have been my nephew because he wasn't
even there at that time, and there was no other small boys in the house.Also
Sometimes I have seen a man who dressed in what I can only call colonial
walk up the stairs and walk into the attic.&nbsp; The weird thing is I
never heard him walk up the old wooden stairs.&nbsp; Sometimes you culd
hear someone moving boxes and stuff around in the attic as if they where
looking for something.&nbsp; All the people who had stayed in the house
in the span of six years that I had lived there would never sleep upstairs
by themselves, and many reported the feeling as if someone was going to
push them down the staircase as they stood at the top of the staircase.&nbsp;
On more than one occasion you could hear a woman crying, the toliet flushing
and doors slamming.&nbsp; My older sister stayed with us for a short while
during her stay she had the shower doors cave in on her pinning her to
the wall and a fan cord lightly wrapped around her neck during her sleep
in which she had found the following morning.&nbsp; foul smells and shadows
where a constant reminder of the ghost's presances.&nbsp; I was&nbsp; glad
when we moved from the house because I found it very unnerving, and some
what frightening, I don't think I ever really had a sound night's sleep.</b>

<p><b>New Zealand Ghost</b>
<p><b>By: mostly@ihug.co.nz</b>
<p><b>In 1996 my boyfriend Daniel was living in a old New Zealand city
called</b>
<br><b>Dunedin, this city has alot of old houses and alot of history.&nbsp;
He lived</b>
<br><b>with his previous girlfriend, in one of a pair of old terraced flats</b>
<br><b>which were cold and didnt get much sun during the day but it was
cheap,</b>
<br><b>an important consideration when you're a poor student.</b>
<br><b>It was the couples flatmate that first noticed something strange,
she</b>
<br><b>proffessed to be something of an amateur mystic, reading auras and</b>
<br><b>suchlike and she claimed to sense some presence in the house, but
the</b>
<br><b>really scary stuff didnt&nbsp; start until Daniel went away for
a couple of</b>
<br><b>weeks and the two girls were in the house by themselves.</b>
<br><b>They noticed the cats were frequently taking fright and chasing</b>
<br><b>something which the girls could not see, it got worse and once the</b>
<br><b>presence pushed one of the girls down the stairs from behind.&nbsp;
Finally,</b>
<br><b>as Daniels girlfriend lay in bed one night, she felt something get
into</b>
<br><b>bed beside her, a cold presence which touched her thigh.</b>
<br><b>While Daniel was still away, the two girls had the place exorcised
and</b>
<br><b>the incidents stopped...but not for long.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after Daniel's return the strange occurances started again,
the</b>
<br><b>cats freaking out and other wierdnesses.&nbsp; The flatmate moved
out leaving</b>
<br><b>Daniel and his girlfriend to deal with it alone.</b>
<br><b>In an attempt to exorcise the ghost a second time, the couple burned</b>
<br><b>incense around the house, especially near a certain doorway which
seemed</b>
<br><b>to be central to the occurances.</b>
<br><b>But as the two watched the circling smoke they noticed it cut off,
just</b>
<br><b>disappeared into nowhere a few inches away from the wall, as if
the</b>
<br><b>smoke were travelling through some kind of invisible doorway.</b>
<br><b>In the end they moved out, unable to handle the atmosphere of the
house</b>
<br><b>any longer.I dont know who moved in afterwards, nor what became
of the ghost.</b>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>My old house that I grew up in.It was a 2 family home.The</b>
<br><b>couple that built it died in the other side of the house.Many people</b>
<br><b>including&amp; excluding immediate family and friends have heard
footsteps that would come up the third floor stairs and stop at the top
by a bedroom door.when opened no one would be there,sometimes to could
hear the "ghost" shift its weight from one foot to the other outside the
door.also it would sometimes continue down the hall to the other bedroom
making a rack of coat hangers go back and forth.Cat&amp;dogs were also
spooked about the second&amp;third floor and would not want to go up.one
sighting of an old man walking up the stairs from the 1st floor to the
2nd.jars broke in the basement and when investigated they only found the
trail marks in the dust of the moved jar and no other disterbances in the
dust around it.voices of a man and woman could be heard at night from the
3rd floor but couldn't make out what was said(at the time no one was sleeping
on the 3rd floor)also voices of a man and woman could be heard on the 1st
floor at night and the sounds of dishes being set also.the sounds would
stop when my brother reached the top of the stair,one time he was half
way down the stair in the dark when it stopped.it seems to be attracted
to children beacuse as we grew up and started to leave to the haunting
slowed down and stopped.this happened only on our side only thing we ever
heard that happened on the other side of the house was a latch on a hook
lock that never would stay latched and footsteps walking around the attic(sounded
like high heels walking about,but no one was there and if someone was the
couldn't walk around because of all the boxes.since we've moved out 2 other
families both with young children have lived there.the 1st family never
knew about the haunting but before they moevd out my father and I talked
to the husband to see if he heard or saw anything and he told us about
strange noises.the 2nd family also had their share of being spooked by
numerous things that happened to them including christmas lights being
turned on.their young daughters saying there was an old woman on the 3rd
floor and cats that would get upset for no reason and hide.they also had
the feeling of being watched from the top of the stair that led to the
second floor and footsteps that would go down the hall and up to the 3rd
floor.we haven't heard anything from the new family.</b>

<p><b>Under the Bed- My First Ghost Story</b>
<p><b>By: emgy@cddn.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;I love your site.I have many stories to share but i'll start
from the begining.when I was between three and four years old&nbsp; i shared
a home with my mom and dad.there were many nights were i would wake up
screaming until my mom or dad would come into my room to calm me down.they
were sure that it was my spider-man poster on the wall across from my bed
that scared me. maybe they were right.however one night i will never forget.i
was put to bed on the bottom bunk of my bunkbed.it was a hot night so i
leaned up against the wall for comfort because it was cool to the touch.as
i was going to sleep i slid my right hand and arm down between the wall
and bed in order to get even closer to the wall.no sooner was my arm and
hand dangling beneath the bed than something grabbed it and pulled very
hard.i leapt up freeing my hand screaming bloody murder.my dad came into
the room and eventually calmed me convincing me i'd imagined it all.nothing
else occured that night and the next day my when i persisted my dad said
it must have just been the cat or a bug hitting my hand.i assure you i
knew the difference even then.nothing else occured in this house to me
that i can recall.years later i was asking my mom about it to see if she
recalled the incident.she did and told me something she never had.she said
one night late she had gotten up to go to the bathroom.she was pregnant
with my sister and having to go several times each night.she walks through
the dining room in the darkness toward the bathroom.she said she saw something
whitish and misty hovering over the dining room table.she immediatly turned
and hurried back to bed scared to death with the hair on her neck standing
straight up.years later my friend kevin was visiting here where i live
now and he'd brought this new guy along that he'd recently met.we hung
out and later that evening we went to take him home.to my surprise he lived
in the same house that i used to where the strange things had happened.when
we pulled into the drive i asked him if anything weird ever happened there
not telling him that i once lived there and what had happened.he asked
me why i wanted to know that and i told him that i used to live there andthought
something strange had happened once.he then bluntly tells me that the house
has a ghost and how it always opens their back door at night after they've
shut and locked it.i then shared my tale and was very happy because then
i did'nt feel so crazy.this was my first encounter with the paranormal
but not the last and certainly not the most frightening.</b>
<br><b>i'll try to send those later if you'd like.thanks for reading.</b>

<br><b>anything strange, untill very recently.&nbsp; First, there is a
payphone in the</b>
<br><b>back crewroom.&nbsp; It would ring once in a while(usually late
at night.&nbsp; I cloed</b>
<br><b>the store with a dew other people)&nbsp; I would pick it up to have
noone on the</b>
<br><b>other end.&nbsp; Thats kinda easy to ignore, anyone can prank a
phone right?&nbsp; Well</b>
<br><b>not if the phone has no incoming calls, which this particular phone
had.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we also have a
stereo in the crewroom.&nbsp; It had remained</b>
<br><b>unplugged for a while as far as I could tell.&nbsp; I took the liberty
of plugging</b>
<br><b>it back in. No sooner had I walked out the room, George had decided
to play</b>
<br><b>with it.&nbsp; He turned it on, turned the volume all the way up,
then back down.</b>
<br><b>When I asked another employee about it, she had replied that not
only does he</b>
<br><b>change the volume, but had also learned to change the staion if
he is unhappy</b>
<br><b>with what is currently on.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats not so bad.&nbsp; Its actually kinda nice.
It was not much longer that I</b>
<br><b>had realized that all these incidents happened in the crewroom and
back sink</b>
<br><b>area(they are situated next to eachother along with thr stockroom)&nbsp;
When i</b>
<br><b>asked about that they told me that before this McDonalds had been
built,</b>
<br><b>there was on old diner that was there.&nbsp; Apparantly the cook,
George, hung</b>
<br><b>himself in the same area that would turn out to be freezer when
McDonalds was</b>
<br><b>built.&nbsp; He seems to hang out more often int eh backsink area
rather than the</b>
<br><b>freezer. But if you ever walk into that particular freezer, close
the door</b>
<br><b>all the way,a nd have someone turn the light off, it will take about
5</b>
<br><b>seconds before you want to LEAVE.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a Playland installed ino the McDonalds
about a year ago.&nbsp; From</b>
<br><b>what some people tell me, George did NOT like it when it was first
finished.</b>
<br><b>They say he shook the whole store upon completion of the new playland.&nbsp;
Also</b>
<br><b>the playland is ALWAYS colder than the rest of the store.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ive also been told that the later the hour you
have to work there the</b>
<br><b>more paranormal activity you will see or feel. Well thats the truth.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>time we had 2 people call out sick, and it was a busy night. We
were there</b>
<br><b>till about 3:45 when we were finally ready to go, I saw out of the
corner of</b>
<br><b>my eye, there must have been 4 or 5 little black men about the siz
of my hand</b>
<br><b>fully extended, running out of the crewroom, jumped up onto the
sink and</b>
<br><b>disappeared into the wall into the freezer.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have since then got a better job.&nbsp; But
Im sure george is up to</b>
<br><b>something right now, as it is about 3:45AM as I write this.</b>

<p><b>My Jog to Arbury Hall</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By:&nbsp; robert.p.taylor@lineone.net</b>
<p><b>Hi again here is my other weird incounter that happened to me a few
years ago. I live in a</b>
<br><b>place called nuneaton in England that has a lot of old history going
back hundreds of years and it is also where George Eliot the writer was
brought up. Well because it is old, people around here say there are quite
a few haunted places to go too including Arbury hall where she was brought
up and another place nearby called Astly castle that is supposed to be
haunted by the young lady jane grey, you know the one that was queen for
only eleven days and then got beheaded by the king of England. Well anyway
here is my story. It must of been about two and half years ago now when
me and my friend couldn't get to sleep late at night, so we thought about
having a late night jog into the country towards the ruins of Astly castle.
As we started jogging towards Astly castle at about half past one in the
morning i started to feel somewhat scared at the thought of going towards
the macabre ruins, even in daylight hours it looks eery and oppressive
and with the 600 year old church next to it,&nbsp; can you blame me for
feeling nervous at the time. So as we were jogging down these short narrow
country roads i was starting to think back to the other times when i've
been to the castle in the day time and the overpowering sadness of the
place and the cold spots too, should i go back i thought. But no me and
my buddy carried on towards the lake nearby and then towards the old run
down empty village&nbsp; and then we started to hear a faint hard tapping
sound like metal hitting metal coming from somewhere in the village or
the church near the castle. Now due to the situation we started to feel
somewhat scared and apprehensive about approaching anywhere near the village
let alone the castle. So we walked towards a phone box nearby and played
around on the phone for a while until we felt more confidant. Now you must
remember that this place is in the middle of the country and there is nobody
that lives nearby, it was just me and my friend and the greenery of the
fields, the darkness of the woods and the closeness of the ruined castle,
church and village. Anyway there we were having a bit of fun on the phone
when all of a sudden we felt as if somebody was watching us, at the same
time it got very cold in the phone booth, it felt as if somebody had just
walked over are graves. Me and my friend simon looked out of the plain
glass booth all around us</b>
<br><b>but could see nothing at all, but the feeling was still there. But
me and my friend just laughed it off and said it was all in are minds.
So we started to play around on the phone again until all off a sudden
we heard foot steps walking towards us getting louder as if somebody was
wearing heavy leather boots, but nobody was there. The footsteps got louder
and louder until they went past the phone booth and on until they stopped.
Now we were absolutely petrified and scared beyond belief, there was still
nobody there. Now the footsteps were coming back again and doing the same
thing all over again, plus the sound of the footsteps was getting louder
no doubt about it. By the time we had the courage to run out of the booth
and sprint all the way back home it must have gone past us at least four
times and it was getting much louder too.</b>
<br><b>This story is all true and i can still remember every detail of
that night like it was only</b>
<br><b>yesterday. But this is just one of many weird situations that i
have encountered over the years and i will be posting some more very soon.

<p><b>My Grandfather</b>
<p><b>By: VaMpIrEn0sFeRaTu@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout my entire life, the healthiest person
that I ever knew was my</b>
<br><b>grandfather.&nbsp; I had heard stories constantly about how he had
barely ever had</b>
<br><b>so much as a head cold.&nbsp; Then, in a flash it all changed.&nbsp;
In October of</b>
<br><b>1998, he got sick.&nbsp; As it turned out, he had cancer.&nbsp;
On Friday April 9 1909,</b>
<br><b>he died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time was around, 6:30 p.m. on the night of
April 9, I was sitting on</b>
<br><b>my computer just surfin' the net.&nbsp; Then suddenly, this giant
chill ran up my</b>
<br><b>spine and I felt nauseaus.&nbsp; The feeling passed within about
five minutes.</b>
<br><b>Around 7:00, the phone rang.&nbsp; It was my grandmother.&nbsp;
She had just returned</b>
<br><b>home from visiting my grandfather in the hospital and there was
a message on</b>
<br><b>the answer machine.&nbsp; I thought I was going to vomit all over
the keyboard.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days later was his funeral.&nbsp; All weekend
I kept seeing him in my</b>
<br><b>head, lying in the hospital bed, trying to pull the respirator away
from his</b>
<br><b>face.&nbsp; The sight was horrific.&nbsp; After the funeral we went
back to my</b>
<br><b>grandmothers apartment.&nbsp; Me and my brother, Eric were sitting
in the family</b>
<br><b>room in silence.&nbsp; My parents and grandmother were sitting at
the dinning room</b>
<br><b>table, trying to eat.&nbsp; Suddenly, me and Eric both jumped from
our seats and</b>
<br><b>ran into grandpa's bedroom.&nbsp; We both were shaking.&nbsp; I
asked him why he ran in</b>
<br><b>and he said that he thought he heard his voice.&nbsp; I heard the
same thing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we walked out, we heard a whistle from inside
the room.&nbsp; The familiar</b>
<br><b>whistle that our grandfather used every day of his life to call
for us.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>turned back into his room and saw his wheelchair rolling into the
wall.&nbsp; All</b>
<br><b>the windows were shut and the room was freezing.&nbsp; I put my
hand on the</b>
<br><b>wheelchair to move it away from the wall.&nbsp; As I pushed it back,
I felt a warm</b>
<br><b>hand touch my shouder from behind.&nbsp; At first, I thought that
it was Eric, but</b>
<br><b>he was standing in front of me.&nbsp; I turned, but nobody was there.&nbsp;
I sat down</b>
<br><b>at the foot of the bed and put my hand down onto the seat of the
wheelchair.</b>
<br><b>It was warm, as if somebody had been sitting there for a while.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got out of the room as fast as I could.&nbsp;
Eric and I walked into the</b>
<br><b>dinning room in tears.&nbsp; We sat down and tryed to eat, but it
was useless.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>had no apitite.&nbsp; Several more times that day, me and Eric heard
his voice,</b>
<br><b>calling us into the bedroom.&nbsp; At one point, the wheelchair
rolled itself into</b>
<br><b>the family room where we were watching television.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every once in a while, we hear grandpa's voice,
asking us to get him some</b>
<br><b>water, or telling us how much he cared about us.&nbsp; In the little
over a year</b>
<br><b>that he has been gone, I've seen him about ten times.&nbsp; I've
woken up in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night to see him sitting on the chair next to my bed,
I've seen</b>
<br><b>him standing online to buy tickets at the movie theater where I
work, and</b>
<br><b>I've heard his voice, telling me how talented I am while I sit at
my computer</b>
<br><b>writing.&nbsp; I think about my grandfather every single day.&nbsp;
I think about his</b>
<br><b>kindness, his love, and his devotion to his family.&nbsp; And I
know that he will</b>
<br><b>always be with me, standing next to me with a hand on my shoulder,
watching</b>
<br><b>as I work hard on my homework, or as I write a poem.&nbsp; He's
just always there.</b>

<p><b>My Kitty Stays With Me</b>
<p><b>By: FhantomFreak@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On three separate occasions I believe my late
friend Marvin (the cat not</b>
<br><b>the Martian) has visited me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time was about one year after he had
to be put down due to his</b>
<br><b>extremely old age and lack of ability to keep on. My cousin was
sleeping on a</b>
<br><b>couch in my bedroom and I was on the bed, it was maybe 20 minutes
after I had</b>
<br><b>turned out the light I was still awake when I felt my cat walking
on my bed</b>
<br><b>next to me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought to myself "oh Marvin I'm tired"when
I remembered...Marvin's</b>
<br><b>dead!..... my breath caught in my throat and I sat up very suddenly.
Brooke,</b>
<br><b>my cousin, notice my unnatural movement and asked what was the matter.
I</b>
<br><b>turned on the light and we both search the whole room for the other
cat whom</b>
<br><b>lived in my home only to find it empty of felines.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second occasion, I had just taken a shower,
when I entered my</b>
<br><b>bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed and against the bare skin
on my back I</b>
<br><b>felt a cat brush against me. Turned around and once again saw nothing
not</b>
<br><b>even a shadow.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third I was watching television when I felt my
bed move four times, like</b>
<br><b>Marvin jumped up onto the bed and took three kitty steps.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still have not seen any evidence of him, but
I often just feel another</b>
<br><b>presence in the room, like he still is a lonely cat who just wants
a little</b>
<br><b>attention.</b>

<p><b>My First Encounter.</b>
<p><b>By: robert.p.taylor@lineone.net</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Hello this is my first time on&nbsp; here and i would like to share
some of my experiences with you. When i was young kid round about eight
years of age me and my family decided to go&nbsp; on holiday to a place
called matlock&nbsp; for two weeks. We arrived at this old farmhouse that
was built in about the 17th century and looking the worse for wear. Anyway
on about the second night we were there we started to hear scratching sounds
and furniture moving downstairs but we just ignored it at first and tried
to go to sleep. But on the third night we couldn't ignore it because the
floorboards upstairs started to vibrate and the whole farmhouse was literally
shacking.It was more worse for me and my brother because we had to sleep
on the floor and we could here strange mumbling sounds coming from downstairs
and the horse in the field next to the farmhouse was making really weird
sounds too. The next morning my dad put it down to bad plumbing even though
my brother and me were getting nervous. Half way through the day i was
starting to get bored so i decided to read a few books from the bookcase
in the living room. So i sat down at the table next to the bookcase that
faced a window and started reading for a while, i remember at the time
reading a book called the IRON MAN. All of a sudden i can remember seeing
something standing in front of the window so i looked up suddenly and right
in front of me was a young pale looking lady smiling at me. She was wearing
white victorian clothes and a straw looking hat with flowers in it. I remember
sitting there just looking at this lady&nbsp; for what seemed ages even
though it must of only been a few seconds. So thinking it was somebody
for my mum or dad i shouted for them to come downstairs, as i turned to
confront my dad to tell him this lady wanted him she had vanished. So my
dad went outside and looked all round the field and at the end of the</b>
<br><b>field towards the bog area, but there was no sign of her even though
we were in the middle of nowhere. Now i think my dad was starting to get
quite spooked as well now because he kept asking me over and over again
that i wasn't lying about the women i had seen. I remember on the fourth
and last night hearing all sorts of weird and distorted sounds coming from
everywhere around the room where we were sleeping next to my mother and
fathers bed. I can also remember my dad kept telling me it was a nearby
highway that was causing the vibrations to the house and there nothing
to be scared about, funny considering the nearest highway was about&nbsp;
10 miles way. When we woke up the next morning my dad was starting to pack
all are stuff away ready for going back home. When i asked him why we were
going back home so early for he just said that it was because he thought
the place was haunted and he wasn't going to spend another night there.
When i talk to my dad these days about that holiday and about him leaving
early because it was haunted he just laughs and says don't be so stupid.
But me and my brother know the truth.&nbsp; This is just one of many weird
experiences that have happend to me over the years and i will be posting
some more very soon to this great web site.</b>

<p><b>Mason, Michigan</b>
<p><b>From: anonymous</b>
<p><b>I grew up in a very old house in Mason, MI.&nbsp; From the time I
could remember on, wierd things would happen there.&nbsp; I used to hear
footsteps all the time.&nbsp; If I was downstairs, I would hear footsteps
upstairs.&nbsp; I always slept upstairs in one of two rooms.&nbsp; When
I slept in the small bedroom, I would hear what sounded like phonograph
music, laughter and</b>
<br><b>glasses breaking.&nbsp; My wind-up music boxes would play by themselves
and I often heard a low-male voice say my name. Mine and my parents pillows
would sometimes "breathe".&nbsp; Downstairs we had a sliding glass door
leading into a back room and my parents, visiters and myself would see
a silhouette of a tall man bent over working or walking around.&nbsp; It
got so aggravating that we put a curtain up so we wouldn't see it every
time we walked by.&nbsp; Sometimes when we'd open the curtain we would
see his face pressed up against the glass.&nbsp; We found out through research
that a family had lived there and the man, John P. had his blacksmith shop
at the house, we are assuming in that room and was found dead there by
a troop of boy-scouts.&nbsp; His wife, Ida was a socialite and died a very
long</b>
<br><b>death upstairs.&nbsp; There was also a woman named Tessa Ann that
lived there during that time and we do not know what happened to her but
we know she had a son named Donell.&nbsp; When my son was a baby, I would
often hear a womans voice in his room talking to him softly and he would
be staring up like there was someone there.&nbsp; One time I had come out
of the bathroom(upstairs)and saw a woman in a long black dress with sandy
brown hair standing in the doorway to the big bedroom(Ida?).&nbsp; I saw
her and tried to go the other way, but instead I walked towards her and
put my hand out and she dissapeared.&nbsp; It was like I was in a trance
or something.&nbsp; Our friends(and myself) were always nervous about going
upstairs for anything and one time when my son was very small I was at
the top of the stairs and felt a push.&nbsp; I don't remember the fall,
but when I opened my eyes, I was on my back, head first down the stairs
and had the baby in my arms still.&nbsp; I have to wonder if something
didn't push me and something else flipped me around to save my baby.&nbsp;
May have been a reflex, I don't really know.&nbsp; I would have an ashtray
in my bedroom and would often go in there to find cigarette butts lined
up in a neat row on the bed when no-one was even there to do it.&nbsp;
My friends would leave there keys on the table and they wouldn't be there
when they'd go to leave..we'd search the house and later find them where
they had been left, even though we'd already looked there.&nbsp; I had
several occurances of someone knocking on my door and as I didn't have
a knob or anything on it, it would swing open.&nbsp; I'd hear a couple
soft knocks, it would open a little and I'd close it then as soon as I'd
lay back down I'd hear louder knocks and it would swing open farther and
this would progress until the door would slam open and hit the wall.&nbsp;
We had a lot more than that happen there, but I don't want to go into everything
because that would take too long.&nbsp; We did notice that things would
get really bad when there was tension between my&nbsp; mother and myself
and calm down when everything was okay.&nbsp; Wierd things happen to us
everywhere we go(even though we live apart now) and I have to wonder if
we don't just attract that sort of thing, give it energy or something.&nbsp;
But I've never had wierder stuff happen than what happened in the Mason
house.</b>

<br><b>I THINK I HAVE A GHOST IN MY APARTMENT</b>
<p><b>By: BUNKEYBOO20@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Lastnight, which was, Monday July 24th.&nbsp; My fiance and I were
sitting up in</b>
<br><b>the living room of my apartment watching a movie we had just rented.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>about 11:45p.m.&nbsp; Well the previews were on and I decided to
go into the</b>
<br><b>bedroom and get us a blanket and some pilliow's so we would be more</b>
<br><b>comfortable on the sofa while we watched the movie.&nbsp; As I was
coming back</b>
<br><b>into the living room my fiance said "hey honey cut off all of those
lights</b>
<br><b>before you come back in here" so I cut off all the light's and went
on into</b>
<br><b>the living room and layed down on the sofa and began to watch the
movie.</b>
<br><b>Well while I was watching the movie I noticed a light come on in
the kitchen</b>
<br><b>out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; At first I thought I was just
seeing things but</b>
<br><b>after I sat there for a second I knew I wasn't.&nbsp; Well I turned
to my fiance</b>
<br><b>and asked him if he had gotten back up since I had came back into
the living</b>
<br><b>room after I had cut all the lights off.&nbsp; I knew he hadn't
though but I was</b>
<br><b>just double checking.&nbsp; He said no why and I said because I
had just cut that</b>
<br><b>light off in the kitchen and now it is back on again.&nbsp; Well
he didn't believe</b>
<br><b>me and got up and went into the kitchen and turned it back off and
said honey</b>
<br><b>you are just seeing things.&nbsp; Well no sooner that he sat back
down the light</b>
<br><b>cut on again and this time he seen it.&nbsp; We both were like "did
you just see</b>
<br><b>that"?&nbsp; Well he got back up and went into the kitchen and didn't
see anything</b>
<br><b>and he checked the back door to make sure it was locked and it was
and he</b>
<br><b>closed the door to the wash room, cut the light back off and came
back into</b>
<br><b>the living room.&nbsp; Not even a minute later the light came back
on again.</b>
<br><b>This time we both got up and went into the kitchen and found the
light on and</b>
<br><b>the wash room door&nbsp; wide open.&nbsp; By this time we were really
freaked out.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>fiance had mention to me when he went in the kitchen the second
time to check</b>
<br><b>the back door and shut the wash room door his vision got kinda hazy
and</b>
<br><b>things in that area were blurry.&nbsp; We then went back into the
living room and</b>
<br><b>decided to call his dad and tell him what had happened.&nbsp; His
dad didn't</b>
<br><b>believe us, of course.&nbsp; I guess it is just one of those things
you have to</b>
<br><b>see for you own eyes.&nbsp; We have lived in the apartment for about
5 years.</b>
<br><b>Nothing had ever happend to us there like this.&nbsp; Although we
all have</b>
<br><b>experienced an uneasy feeling, like someone was in our presence.&nbsp;
When my</b>

had walked</b>
<br><b>into her room, sat down on her water bed, grabbed her by her legs
and started</b>
<br><b>shaking her.&nbsp; She got up and looked around but never seen anything.&nbsp;
And here</b>
<br><b>recently my mom has gotten up and found all the lights on and the
front door</b>
<br><b>wide open after the fact we know we had shut and locked it and shut</b>

<br><b>The Ghost in the Furniture Store</b>
<p><b>By: SEAAIRTX@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This Place is in Cleburne Tx. But let me tell you a little bet about</b>
<br><b>myself......... My name is Star and I have what you call a 6 sense
about</b>
<br><b>things. I didn't know I had this gift until I was about 12 yrs.
old. When I</b>
<br><b>was young My mother like to look for old bottles and things this
was before</b>
<br><b>people was interested in these things, so there where a lot of old
houses</b>
<br><b>around and at that time people didn't care if you went throw them.
So we</b>
<br><b>would go all the time and I loved it. There were times when we would
go into</b>
<br><b>an old house that no one had been in for 50 or 60 yrs.and I would
fill</b>
<br><b>something or someone looking at us. There were times when I would
see</b>
<br><b>something white behind me. But at that time I didn't know. But has
I got</b>
<br><b>older I realize what this was all about. And so I got very interested
in it</b>
<br><b>and tryed to improve what I had. So every time people thought they
had</b>
<br><b>something in there house they would call me, sometimes they would
and</b>
<br><b>sometime they didn't. I have seen over 6 ghost and talk to 3.......
So I</b>
<br><b>don't know how much experience you need to count as a Ghost Hunter....
Now I</b>
<br><b>am in my middle 40's and I still love to go and experience what
I can.... Well, enough about me............</b>
<br><b>To go on with the story........ My daughter rents an old building
in</b>
<br><b>Cleburne for her Furniture Store. She called me oneday and she was
hearing something</b>
<br><b>up stairs and I thought it might have been a cat or a rat, it got
so bad</b>
<br><b>that she called the local police to check things out because she
thought it might</b>
<br><b>be a homeless person but the police couldn't fined a thing. So I
thought I</b>
<br><b>would take time and check it out. We went up stairs to look around
when I</b>
<br><b>got that feeling and cold air went by and I told the others we have
a ghost now</b>
<br><b>lets find out who it is. When in the next room my son-in law said
everyone</b>
<br><b>get out. Well, we went to look before we could get to him he was
walking</b>
<br><b>back and said you are not going to believe what I saw. Well, he
told us about an</b>
<br><b>old man looking right at him and he ask him what was he doing there
and the</b>
<br><b>man said nothing, when all of a sudden the man turned and walk down
some</b>
<br><b>stairs that go no where. Jake followed him and he was gone. We all
talk</b>
<br><b>about this and then as we where leaving the store we look up and
there he was</b>
<br><b>looking back at us, as we where looking at him my son-in-law went
to sit</b>
<br><b>down on some benches and an old man came and sit by him. The old
man ask Jake</b>
<br><b>what was going on and Jake said nothing then the old man told Jake
about seeing</b>
<br><b>people walking around in these building all the time. When Jake
turn to his</b>
<br><b>wife (the other sister Fawn) and turn back around the old man was
gone Jake</b>
<br><b>didn't thank much about it until later. See when Jake told Fawn
about the</b>
<br><b>old man Fawn look at him and said Jake no one was sitting by you.
But what's so</b>
<br><b>funny is Jake don't believe in Ghost</b>

<br><b>after her,and my mother said that when I was a toddler I would talk
to her.Now i know this sounds hard to believe ,but my mother said that
I would say things that only her and my greatgrandmother knew.So I have

<br><b>The Valley</b>
<p><b>By: PDL147852@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Here's a story I had forgotten(on purpose) until someone asked me
about it</b>
<br><b>three days ago. My parents own a piece of a large antique store
and sometimes</b>
<br><b>one will offer us&nbsp; all the furniture in an unused house. We
will check out</b>
<br><b>the merchandise and make them an offer. It was on such an occasion
that my</b>
<br><b>father and I drove to a house in an artists community not far from
the shop</b>
<br><b>and not too far from a notoriously haunted patch of woods called
'The</b>
<br><b>Valley'. I was extra interested because I wanted to by the house
itself from</b>
<br><b>what my parents had told me of it's emence size and beauty not to
mention</b>
<br><b>that it was below dirt cheap. We drove up and I was estatic it was
surrounded</b>
<br><b>by big trees the nieghbors were&nbsp; not too close for comfort
and the garage off</b>
<br><b>the house was so big I could have lived in it by itself. We went
inside and I</b>
<br><b>was immediately blasted by wave after wave of overwelming feelings
of evil.</b>
<br><b>It was so thick you had to practically swim through it as for my
dad he</b>
<br><b>wouldn't believe in ghosts if he saw one swipe his wallet. As we
worked I</b>
<br><b>searched the place, behind one door I found some ritualistic symbols
drawn, I</b>
<br><b>had already expected as much. We cleared the place in one afternoon.</b>
<br><b>Something had kept attracting my attention. It was in the living
room an</b>
<br><b>ultra-modern type fireplace which sat in the middle of the room
painted</b>
<br><b>orange and a long metal tube going up out of the cieling. As we
were leaving</b>
<br><b>for the last time until I would have purchased the place that same
fireplace</b>
<br><b>started shaking and jumping off the floor and clanging as my dad
and I looked</b>
<br><b>on. To me it looked like it was being kicked in by invisible boots
my dad's</b>
<br><b>explianation was this, "Tis some sorta animal caught up in there
nothig</b>
<br><b>more." We left and I didn't return the last owner's calls after
that day</b>
<br><b>because I wasn't about to buy that place.</b>

<p><b>Remodeled Home</b>
<p><b>By: Oneredrhose@aol.com</b>
<p><b>I was doing a clean up job at a home that was remodeled.&nbsp; Not
knowing the history of the house I said ok.&nbsp; So my brother and I left
to go do the job.&nbsp; As I was cleaning on the inside, he did the work
out side.&nbsp; I started to clean the back bathroom.&nbsp; When I was
done, I went to the kitchen to start in there.&nbsp; I left some rags in
the bathroom and when I went back it was dirty again.&nbsp; I thought that
I had cleaned it.&nbsp; So I went back to the kitchen to</b>
<br><b>finish up in there.&nbsp; Later I started to walk down the hallway,
when I heard the toilet flush.&nbsp; I called for my brother, and he walked
in behind me.&nbsp; He asked what I wanted, and I asked him if he went
to the bathroom?&nbsp; He had been outside, and as we walked to wards the
bathroom you could here the toilet still running.&nbsp; Again, I didn't
think anything about it.&nbsp; So I went into the den where the new furniture
was at.&nbsp; It was nice and so I took a few minutes to rest.&nbsp; I
went back into the kitchen to get somemore rags to clean, and as I walked
back to the den, this man was walking towards me.&nbsp; You could see right
through him, and he was about 12 inches of the ground.&nbsp; I stopped
and froze and hi tailed it out of there.&nbsp; My brother looked at me
and said what's wrong.&nbsp; I told him what I seen, and he went to look
and didn't find anyone.&nbsp; I stayed outside in the truck the rest of
the day.&nbsp; I wouldn't go back in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found
out later, the reason the rebuilt the house because the owner committed
suicide in it.&nbsp; Earlier that week my brother took his dog with him
to work, he said that she walked down the hallway, stopped barked, peed
and left running out with her tail between her legs. They caught up with
her a few blocks away.&nbsp; She was shaking and shivering.&nbsp; They
had to fight her to put her in the truck.&nbsp; I don't even like going
down the street where this house is.</b>

<p><b>Bobby</b>
<p><b>By: jinette@sprint.ca</b>
<p><b>I have been living with a spirit for just over two years.&nbsp; I
am an assistant superintendent on a part time basis and an executive assistant
for a recycling company, also a mother and wife.&nbsp; I guess I am telling
you this so that you know I am not some one who has nothing better to do
with my time.&nbsp; it all started when a 7th floor resident who I will
call bobby, jumped of his balcony and killed himself&nbsp; just over 2
year ago.&nbsp; My sister and I (who also worked here) had to clean up
the mess (later finding out that this is supposed to be done by the fire
department).&nbsp; His family left alot of furniture in his apartment.&nbsp;
usually we give the left over stuff to the salvation army or to a needy
tenant.&nbsp; in this case my sister had just gotten separated from her
husband and was in need of a bed ( you might think this is kind of morbid,
I know I do).&nbsp; she took the bed from the former tenants apartment
for herself to use.&nbsp; in the months that followed alot of strange thing
happened at her place and mine ( she lived just down the hall from me).&nbsp;
doors would open and close for no apparent reason, lights would go on&nbsp;
and off, the toilet would flush, I would wake in the morning to find the
kitchen cabinet doors open and on 2 occasions the shower turned on.&nbsp;
so it sound like you basic haunting.&nbsp; Last November my sister move
back to our home country 3000 miles over the ocean.&nbsp; a few weeks before
she moved things got worse.&nbsp; not in the sense that it was dangerous
just that it happened more often.&nbsp; One night I was down at her apartment
with my 2 yr. old son.&nbsp; my son was standing in the hallway that lead
to the living room.&nbsp; he was looking down the hall as if watching someone
walk toward him. it was like he turned around when the person walked past
him looking up, suggesting it was an adult.&nbsp; we made a joke of it.&nbsp;
I told to my son to stay hi to the nice man, he turned around and looked
in the corner right by the front door and say in his little voice "Hi".&nbsp;
this really freaked me out so I left.&nbsp; later that night I went back
without my son.&nbsp; my 8 yr. old niece was just leaving to go to her
friends apartment down the hall.&nbsp; as she left I called out to her
to close the door.&nbsp; she did not hear me and the door stayed open a
couple of inches.&nbsp; I was sitting on the couch doing a cross word puzzle
and decided to finish my puzzle before going to close the door.&nbsp; 10
mins later my sister was in her room getting dressed (she was in the shower)&nbsp;
she called to me to go and talk to her while she did her hair.&nbsp; I
walked to the front door to close it, but it was already closed, this is
not unusual sometimes this happens,&nbsp; but what I can not explain is
that the door was also locked.&nbsp; there is no explanation for this.&nbsp;
my sister was in the shower, my niece did&nbsp; not hear me call to her
nor does she have a key or the knowledge to lock the door. it really spooked
me.&nbsp; I told my sister&nbsp; and she also got spooked.&nbsp; she told
me she had been hearing noises that did not seem to be coming from anywhere.&nbsp;
my sister and I chatted for a couple of hours until my niece came home.&nbsp;
I asked her if she locked the door and she looked at me and said "yeah
sure, with my finger"&nbsp; ( being 8 with a smart mouth).&nbsp; I left
about an hour later to go home, at this time it was approx.. 10pm.&nbsp;
my niece was sleeping on the couch and my sister was going to finish some
painting in the dining area then go to bed.&nbsp; I had been home for about
20 mins when my sister call me crying.&nbsp; she said that there was someone
in her bedroom jumping on the bed.&nbsp; I told her to go and look.&nbsp;
she took the phone with her and approached her bedroom.&nbsp; the noise
stopped just as she got to the bathroom.&nbsp; when she turned to walk
away the noise started again, she put the phone on speaker so I too could
hear it.&nbsp; it really sounded like someone jumping on</b>
<br><b>the bed.&nbsp; my sister (trying to make&nbsp; a joke of it) yelled
go away bobby, go and spook someone else.&nbsp; 2 mins later I heard a
noise in my hallway I was sitting at my computer and looked down the hallway
toward the kitchen and there was bobby&nbsp; standing just inside my front
door.&nbsp; he had on a brown leather jacket and blue jeans.&nbsp; the
clothes he was wearing when he died.&nbsp; I was really shocked.&nbsp;
I told my sister what I saw and tried to pretend that I was not scared.
I said to him "it's o.k. bobby you can go now"&nbsp; and then he was gone.&nbsp;
my sister was laughing hysterically on the other end of the phone.&nbsp;
I tried to calm her down by talking to her, but it did not work.&nbsp;
I was kind of glad that she was freaking out because it did not give me
time to freak out myself.&nbsp; I went to my sister and sat with her until
the sun came up.&nbsp; neither of us sleep that night.&nbsp; later that
day we took the bed out to the dumpster at the back of the building and
since my sister only had a&nbsp; few days left in Canada she slept on an
air mattress.&nbsp; that seemed to solve the problem for her, but bobby
has never left my apartment.&nbsp; I do not feel threatened by his presence,
but uncomfortable.&nbsp; and my cat is constantly having freak attacks
and my son talks of the man.</b>

<br><b>Ghost(?) Story</b>
<p><b>By: cbrinson@Dominionsc.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This really isn't a ghost story, but it deffinately was a spirit.&nbsp;
About 5 years</b>
<br><b>ago, when I first started practicing Wicca, I had quite the experience.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>never belonged to a coven, so I was experimenting with the Craft
to find my own</b>
<br><b>path.&nbsp; I was raising a circle of power and got quite caught
up in the ritual,</b>
<br><b>and being pleased with the amount of energy I raised and released
that night I</b>
<br><b>forgot to close the watchtowers properly and ground myself completely.</b>
<br><b>Reflecting upon it now, I belive that I attacted something from
another plane</b>
<br><b>and didn't protect myself completely.&nbsp; A few hours after I
went to bed, early</b>
<br><b>morning, about 0300 hrs according to my clock, I awoke suddenly
due to some sort</b>
<br><b>of movement in my bed room, like something lept up on my bed (no
pets in my</b>
<br><b>apartment at the time).&nbsp; I opened my eyes and was paralized
with fear as I saw a</b>
<br><b>small grining humanoid thing sitting on my chest.&nbsp; Its was
blacker than black</b>
<br><b>and I could see its outline easliy even tough there was no light
in the room.</b>
<br><b>It had long arms, with thin long fingers, and sat hunched up like
a crouched</b>
<br><b>monkey.&nbsp; Its face was kind of doglike, with a mouth too large
for its face.&nbsp; Its</b>
<br><b>eyes were glowing a bright blue as it shook its finger at me and
told me not to</b>
<br><b>shout out because I would wake my wife that was sleeping next to
me.&nbsp; It then</b>
<br><b>disappeared, laughing, and I screamed my head off!&nbsp; I was in
a cold sweat and my</b>
<br><b>wife asked me what was wrong;&nbsp; I lied and told her that it
was just a nightmare</b>
<br><b>and I desperately tried to convince myself that it was just that.&nbsp;
The next day</b>
<br><b>I was researching every book I could find to try to explain what
it was and I</b>
<br><b>researched some simple banishments incase it returned again.&nbsp;
That night I woke</b>
<br><b>up in the early morning again, and something had me by the ankles
and was</b>
<br><b>pulling me off the bed.&nbsp; My legs kind of burned like when you
grab onto dry</b>
<br><b>ice... a cold burn.&nbsp; It had me half way off before I managed
to pull myself</b>
<br><b>away, which took some doing,&nbsp; and I got out of bed, told my
wife wha had</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; She rolled over and said, "Well, you brought it
into the house, get</b>
<br><b>rid of it."&nbsp; quite calmly, like you would tell someone to take
out the trash or</b>
<br><b>throw out an old couch.&nbsp; I had something to do, and spent the
rest of the night</b>
<br><b>in cleansing the apartment and banishing any evil thing that would
come to that</b>
<br><b>place and do harm.&nbsp; Finally I laid out a couple of blessings
for a little extra</b>
<br><b>touch and I MADE SURE I CLOSED MY CIRCLE and GROUNDED!!&nbsp; I
haven't seen or heard from that thing again, and I am rather glad for that,
even though I still</b>
<br><b>practice the craft.&nbsp; I learned that no matter how caught up
you are in</b>
<br><b>Craftwork, remember that you are still dealing with something very
powerful, and</b>
<br><b>you got to protect yourself.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts on Campus</b>
<p><b>By: sna1997@yahoo.com</b>
<p><b>The stories I'm about to tell you actually happened to</b>
<br><b>a cousin of mine at his college campus.</b>
<p><b>One night this one guy was lounging around in his dorm</b>
<br><b>while his room mates were out.&nbsp; He was relaxing and</b>
<br><b>reading on his bottom bunk bed when he heared scratchy</b>
<br><b>noises in his room.&nbsp; Wondering what it was he looked</b>
<br><b>around didnt see anything unusual and went on reading</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; Few minutes later the sound started coming</b>
<br><b>around again just a bit louder he looked out his</b>
<br><b>window saw tree branches hitting on the window sill</b>
<br><b>thinking this was it he went back on reading.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>noises stopped just for a few seconds then all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden the noise came back this time it sound very</b>
<br><b>close by.&nbsp; He checked out the top bunk and saw a</b>
<br><b>ghostly image of a lady, ran out of his dorm and never</b>
<br><b>came back to live there since.</b>
<br><b>One night some student decided to have a party on</b>
<br><b>campus.&nbsp; A group of student was on the way to the</b>
<br><b>party when they ran into this girl.&nbsp; She looked like a</b>
<br><b>regular student there but nobody has seen her before.</b>
<br><b>Anyways, the group tried to get her attention to ask</b>
<br><b>her to the party but she didnt seem to hear them.</b>
<br><b>They called to her again but she just kept right on</b>
<br><b>walking.&nbsp; So one of the guys, decided to walk up to</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; The rest of the group had gone into the</b>
<br><b>building.&nbsp; As he approached the girl he noticed she</b>
<br><b>was smiling at him he looked down and saw her face was</b>
<br><b>facing him but her rest of the body faced the other</b>
<br><b>direction.&nbsp; He sereamed and ran back to his friends.</b>
<br><b>The group ran back out and tried to look for the girl</b>
<br><b>but she was nowhere to be found</b>

<br><b>West Blvd. Haunting</b>
<p><b>By: CDawg1014@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I was browsing through the internet looking up websites about ghosts,
when I</b>
<br><b>stumbled across yours&nbsp; - theshadowlands.net.&nbsp; I read that
you would help or</b>
<br><b>atleast talk and answer some questions concerning hauntings...&nbsp;
well you</b>
<br><b>might want to listen to this story... I am sorry it is so long,
but I must</b>
<br><b>explain it all, just to set it all up so it makes sense to you.</b>
<br><b>I moved in with my girlfriend last January of 2000, in a house (duplex)
she</b>
<br><b>had been renting since the previous September.&nbsp; The house was
built around</b>
<br><b>1910-11 (discovered while talking to neighbor history-buffs) and
is still in</b>
<br><b>a rather nice area of the western outskirts of the City of Cleveland,
Ohio.</b>
<br><b>The house is actually located only a few streets from the infamous
haunted</b>
<br><b>mansion in Cleveland -- Franklin's Castle.&nbsp; Back when this
house was built,</b>
<br><b>the street was home to very wealthy people -- the street actually
was one of</b>
<br><b>the first streets of the area with electricity throughout the homes.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>street also boasted a street-car line that once ran down the middle
of the</b>
<br><b>street, which provided the electricity to the homes and quick transportation</b>
<br><b>to downtown.&nbsp; Through some conversation with our landlord,
who has lived and</b>
<br><b>owned this place for the past 35 years, we discovered that our side
of the</b>
<br><b>house has been turned over by renters many times (maybe that is
why the rent</b>
<br><b>at this place is about $150-200 lower than any other place on the
same</b>
<br><b>street?).&nbsp; He also stated that it has been really hard to keep
people living</b>
<br><b>in this side for more than a month or two.&nbsp; (He must be right,
because we</b>
<br><b>get tons of mail to our address with different names.)&nbsp; Our
landlord also told</b>
<br><b>us, suprisingly, that about 15-20 years ago he was renting our side
out to</b>
<br><b>two retired priests when they were both arrested for molestation
of many,</b>
<br><b>many young boys inside our house.&nbsp; The priests were then a
part of a large</b>
<br><b>court case in which many grown-men came to report that they too--
were</b>
<br><b>molested by these priests very violently when they were younger.&nbsp;
These 2</b>
<br><b>priests lived here for a number of years, and the landlord told
us he</b>
<br><b>"always thought something weird was happening on our side".</b>
<br><b>Before I moved in with my girlfriend, she told me that as soon as
she moved</b>
<br><b>in she began getting strange feelings from the house -- like someone
was</b>
<br><b>always watching her.&nbsp; One of the main reasons I moved in with
her was</b>
<br><b>because this was very frightening, atleast for a 22 year-old!&nbsp;
A few months before I</b>
<br><b>moved in, she had 2 self-proclaimed psychics / witches over to the
house for</b>
<br><b>an inspection.&nbsp; They both claimed to "feel" 4 entities-- 2
male spirits and</b>
<br><b>2 female spirits.&nbsp; They concluded (with a walk through the
house) that one of</b>
<br><b>the male spirits was very evil, possibly a poltergeist, and that
the 2</b>
<br><b>female spirits were good and were here to watch over and protect
my girlfriend</b>
<br><b>while she lived here.</b>
<br><b>During my first visit to the house, I was very eager for a look
around.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>house is a rather large duplex with a concrete wall separating the
two</b>
<br><b>sides.&nbsp; It has 2 stories, 3 bedrooms, 1 full bath,&nbsp; a
basement and a large</b>
<br><b>unfinished storage attic.&nbsp; During my investigation of the house
I didn't</b>
<br><b>feel anything at all (i.e., a spirit watching me, etc.) and I even
told my</b>
<br><b>girlfriend that I didn't think the house was haunted and that she
had</b>
<br><b>nothing to worry about.&nbsp; Obviously, the basement did look pretty
scary and</b>
<br><b>mysterious -- but only because there is a large patch of newer concrete
just big enough</b>
<br><b>to dump a few bodies under!!</b>
<br><b>When I first moved in, my girlfriend had a temporary roommate -
an exchange</b>
<br><b>student -- living with her here until February, when she found her
own</b>
<br><b>apartment.&nbsp; She was around quite a bit, and since I worked
nights, she</b>
<br><b>provided my girlfriend with a sense of security of someone being
here</b>
<br><b>through the night.&nbsp; Since I felt no presences in the house
when I first moved in, I</b>
<br><b>was not scared of being alone and didn't even think about the haunting...</b>
<br><b>until I started to finish the basement!</b>
<br><b>The basement was really wrecked when I moved in -- pain was all
peeling off</b>
<br><b>the walls, lots of mold everywhere, mouse traps, poor lighting...
there was</b>
<br><b>even alot of old furniture that previous tenants had left down there
that no</b>
<br><b>one had the energy to remove.&nbsp; Since the basement was so large,
we decided</b>
<br><b>to fix it up a little and turn it into a rec-room and maybe put
a pool table</b>
<br><b>down there.&nbsp; So in January, I started sanding and scraping
all the paint</b>
<br><b>from the walls, repainted the walls, started putting some electrical
outlets in,</b>
<br><b>framed up some partition walls, etc.&nbsp; It was during this construction
that I</b>
<br><b>became aware of the ghosts that dwelled in the house...</b>
<br><b>One morning, while I was alone working in the basement, I heard
footsteps</b>
<br><b>upstairs -- right above my head.&nbsp; I thought that it was my
girlfriend or her</b>
<br><b>roommate home for lunch, so I went upstairs to say "hi".&nbsp; When
I got</b>
<br><b>upstairs I found nothing!&nbsp; I was so sure someone was home I
walked around the house,</b>
<br><b>even checking closets, but found no one.&nbsp; When I returned down
in the</b>
<br><b>basement.. the footsteps got harder.. as loud and stamping on the
floor...</b>
<br><b>but again I found no one upstairs or throughout the house.&nbsp;
( It is</b>
<br><b>important for me to include here that the basements of the duplex
are separated with a</b>
<br><b>large brick and concrete wall that extends up to the attic for fire</b>
<br><b>protection. Both sides are constructed as individual homes, they
don't share</b>
<br><b>anything but the concrete wall and the joints at the peak of the
roof in the</b>
<br><b>attic. Because of this wall, we can never hear much of what is going
on next</b>
<br><b>door... even if they are having a party.)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A day or two after the first incident, although "ghosts" were
still not on</b>
<br><b>my mind until sometime afterwards, I woke up late, about 10 or 11
am after my</b>
<br><b>girlfriend had left for work.&nbsp; While I laid in bed, I heard
our roommate in</b>
<br><b>the bathroom (right next to our bedroom) brushing her teeth and
getting</b>
<br><b>ready for work or something, so I continued to lay there until she
left the</b>
<br><b>bathroom.&nbsp; When I heard her leave the bathroom, I got up to
brush my teeth.</b>
<br><b>While I was in the bathroom, I heard her in her bedroom.. changing
or</b>
<br><b>whatever.&nbsp; When I was done using the bathroom, I went over
to her bedroom to</b>
<br><b>say goodmorning, but when I opened the door no one was there!&nbsp;
I quickly ran</b>
<br><b>downstairs to look for her, but no one was home.&nbsp; The first
thing I thought</b>
<br><b>to do, was to call my girlfriend at work to ask her were are roommate
was...</b>
<br><b>and she told me that they had both left for work at the same time
that</b>
<br><b>morning, around 9am!&nbsp; While I was on the phone with my girlfriend,
I became</b>
<br><b>visibly shaken, because I was hearing someone again walking around
upstairs.</b>
<br><b>When I hung up with my girlfriend, I first checked to see if the
neighbors</b>
<br><b>were home -- maybe making alot of noise next door.. however both
of their</b>
<br><b>cars were gone also.&nbsp; When I went upstairs the second time,
the noises</b>
<br><b>stopped.. however I felt a presence upstairs.&nbsp; Since I have
had a few other</b>
<br><b>experiences with ghosts before, I am not easily frightened, so I
thought</b>
<br><b>this would be a good time to go downstairs and grab the Polaroid
camera.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>was loading the camera back downstairs, the footsteps were getting
louder</b>
<br><b>and they seemed to lead from the bathroom, down the upstairs hallway
and down</b>
<br><b>the stairs.&nbsp; My girlfriend's cat even became afraid... as the
cat listened to</b>
<br><b>the steps and seemed to sit patiently and watch for whatever was
about to appear</b>
<br><b>at the bottom of the steps.&nbsp; Just before I went upstairs I
heard a loud</b>
<br><b>blast and bang come from the upstairs bathroom. When I got to the
top of the steps</b>
<br><b>with the Polaroid, I heard a woman's voice say something, eventhough
it was</b>
<br><b>clearly a woman's voice.. it sounded distorted and unable to understand.&nbsp;
As</b>
<br><b>I walked down the hallway, I started taking pictures of just about</b>
<br><b>everything, and when I reached the bathroom, I found that the cast-iron</b>
<br><b>register for the furnace had blown off the bottom of the wall and
landed</b>
<br><b>about 4 feet from the wall.&nbsp; (that was the loud blast I heard
downstairs)&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>quickly took a picture of the bathroom and headed quickly back downstairs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When I returned downstairs and began looking at the Polaroid
pictures that</b>
<br><b>were developing before my eyes... I didn't notice anything out of
the</b>
<br><b>ordinary.&nbsp; After a few times looking over the pictures, I noticed
that the</b>
<br><b>bathroom curtains looked funny.&nbsp; When I went back upstairs
to compare the</b>
<br><b>picture with the bathroom -- I was right!&nbsp; The curtains we
had in the</b>
<br><b>bathroom was the type that wrap around the very top of the window.&nbsp;
In the</b>
<br><b>picture.. the curtains came down on either side of the window...
a</b>
<br><b>white-transparent old-fashioned looking curtains.&nbsp; It was at
this time I was</b>
<br><b>pretty sure we has a ghost on our hands, maybe a residual haunting,
or some</b>
<br><b>type of portal that I captured on film of how the house was decorated
at an</b>
<br><b>earlier time when something traumatic might have happened?</b>
<br><b>Since then, many strange things have occurred ... my girlfriend
has seen a</b>
<br><b>man with a top-hat on standing behind her in the reflection of the
window</b>
<br><b>while washing dishes.&nbsp; I have seen the same man also while
watching TV in</b>
<br><b>the living room, and seeing him move quickly in the kitchen out
of the corner of</b>
<br><b>my eye.&nbsp; One night, after a party, we brought back a smoke
mating and was</b>
<br><b>playing with it in the house.&nbsp; After the downstairs was filled
up, us and a</b>
<br><b>few friends turned off the lights and were playing around.&nbsp;
I got out my</b>
<br><b>laser pointer, and discovered that it turned into a cool beam of
red light,</b>
<br><b>instead of a point.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was doing this.. the 3 others
became terrified</b>
<br><b>when they saw an outline of half-a-man standing in front of me.&nbsp;
They saw it</b>
<br><b>in the smoke when I shined the laser pointer around (although I
never saw</b>
<br><b>it). My girlfriend became so shaken, she left the house for 2 days.
The</b>
<br><b>doorbell will often ring, but no one will be at the door.&nbsp;
Sometimes lights</b>
<br><b>will go on and off at will.&nbsp; We even had to get rid of the
cat we had,</b>
<br><b>because she was acting crazy.. looking at walls for a long time..
nothing</b>
<br><b>was there, following things in the house that are invisible to us..
etc.</b>
<br><b>Many other things have happened, which include the dreams that my
girlfriend</b>
<br><b>and I sometimes have... it is a similar dream.. of the house.. and
it trying</b>
<br><b>to tell us something.. but we cannot figure it out.&nbsp; It usually
leads us to</b>
<br><b>the stairs to the attic or the bathroom (which are right across
from each</b>
<br><b>other) and then we abruptly wake up.&nbsp; Doors in the house will
open and slam</b>
<br><b>shut (mostly upstairs).&nbsp; And once, when I called home to talk
to my</b>
<br><b>girlfriend, at 3am.. from work.&nbsp; Right before she picked up
the phone.. I</b>
<br><b>heard the phone pick up, and I heard a ghostly old woman's voice
say that</b>
<br><b>"Stefanie (my&nbsp; girlfriend) isn't home"..&nbsp; then my girlfriend
picked up the</b>
<br><b>phone and the ghostly voice disappeared.</b>
<br><b>One of the stranger occurrences was when we were awaken from our
sleep at</b>
<br><b>about 4am by a loud crash...&nbsp; enough to wake me up.. which
sometimes alarms</b>
<br><b>do not wake me.&nbsp; When we heard the crash, I first thought it
was our</b>
<br><b>55-gallon fish tank falling over... because it literally shook the
bed.&nbsp; So</b>
<br><b>we ran downstairs.. and checked the whole house but found nothing...
not</b>
<br><b>until the next morning when we went to take a shower.&nbsp; Everything
that was</b>
<br><b>laying around the shower... shampoo, soap.. etc etc.&nbsp; was laying
in the tub.</b>
<br><b>This might not sound weird. until I saw the glass soap holder --
which fills</b>
<br><b>with water from showers -- laying on the floor of the tub.&nbsp;
Although</b>
<br><b>everything was knocked over.. from a good fall... the soap holder
was filled</b>
<br><b>with water to the very brim?&nbsp; This crash was so load the neighbors
called</b>
<br><b>the landlord, cause they though something on our side had fallen
and hurt us or</b>
<br><b>the house, etc?&nbsp; Since this occurrence. my girlfriend has awaken
in the</b>
<br><b>morning to loud crashes, that I never hear... and when she checks
out the</b>
<br><b>house... she finds nothing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A few weeks ago, I got really sick.. and couldn't even get
out of bed..</b>
<br><b>thought I had caught pneumonia from my girlfriend's brother.&nbsp;
One day, as I</b>
<br><b>laid in bed... I "summoned" the good spirits in the house to help
me feel</b>
<br><b>better.... kinda just as a joke.. I was desperate to feel better.&nbsp;
The very</b>
<br><b>next day.. I started feeling better, and on my way walking down
the stairs,</b>
<br><b>I heard the same female voice say "Its done"...&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't
really realize what</b>
<br><b>this meant until the next day, when I felt back to normal.&nbsp;
The voice must</b>
<br><b>have been the spirit telling me that I wouldn't be sick anymore,
and that is</b>
<br><b>was over (done).??</b>
<br><b>Just yesterday, I heard a crash upstairs, when I came upstairs..
I felt cold</b>
<br><b>brushes or air something from the bathroom, when I got there....
everything</b>
<br><b>in the bathroom was moved and placed in a different way.&nbsp; Shampoo
was in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the floor of the room, hairspray knocked off the sink..
etc.</b>
<br><b>Another common occurrence is seeing things move out the corner of
our</b>
<br><b>eyes...this happens a few times a week.. sometimes we even get a
glimpse of a</b>
<br><b>person when we enter a room.. but not a long enough glance to describe
what the</b>
<br><b>person looks like.</b>
<br><b>There are many, many other occurrences in the house.&nbsp; But mostly,
I just get</b>
<br><b>a feeling of being watched.. not all the time.. sometimes I will
not feel</b>
<br><b>anything for weeks or months.. but when it comes back.. it stays
for a few</b>
<br><b>days.. usually with some type of violent occurrence.&nbsp; Since
the house has</b>
<br><b>been lived in by so many people since 1910-11... it has been rented
by many</b>
<br><b>people ever since it was built.&nbsp; We think that maybe during
that time,</b>
<br><b>someone has died, or maybe become very attached to the residence.&nbsp;
I think</b>
<br><b>personally that something bad happened in the upstairs hallway or
steps</b>
<br><b>leading to the attic. My girlfriend thinks someone died or something
in the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, she also gets a great sense of someone hiding behind the
door in</b>
<br><b>the attic.. perhaps from the priests that were molesting him?&nbsp;
I don't get</b>
<br><b>many "bad" feelings from anywhere else in the house, eventhough
the attic</b>
<br><b>andthe basement it really scary looking.. I get the most from upstairs
hallway</b>
<br><b>and bathroom for some reason, eventhough the female voice seems
to originate</b>
<br><b>in the back bedroom. We don't know.. but it would sure be worth
further</b>
<br><b>investigation.</b>

<br><b>After Grandpa Died</b>
<p><b>By: Schmegatt@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I'll try to keep this short.&nbsp; When I was 10 years old, I saw
the ghost of my</b>
<br><b>late uncle in my parent's dining room.&nbsp; He was not transparent,
and appeared</b>
<br><b>to be just like a live person standing there motionless, but clearly
focused</b>
<br><b>on me.&nbsp; I ran upstairs totally freaked out, but that's the
only ghost I've</b>
<br><b>ever seen.&nbsp; But the real action started much later.&nbsp; About
9 years ago, my</b>
<br><b>grandfather and my dog died within a few weeks of one another.&nbsp;
They were</b>
<br><b>very close and my grandfather was truly the dog's favorite person.&nbsp;
Shortly</b>
<br><b>after their deaths, my brother and I both started to hear noises
in the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; We would hear human and dog footsteps when no one else
was around.</b>
<br><b>One time while I was home alone late at night, I heard intermittent
clapping</b>
<br><b>coming from the backyard.&nbsp; After awhile I got up the guts to
go out there and</b>
<br><b>have a smoke.&nbsp; A few minutes later, I heard the sound of a
dog growling and</b>
<br><b>someone clapping twice quickly which ended the growling.&nbsp; I
saw no one, and</b>
<br><b>the sources of both noises were definitely within 15 feet of me!&nbsp;
My parents</b>
<br><b>have neighbors on only one side and there was no one else that could
have</b>
<br><b>made that noise so close to me.&nbsp; I ran right back inside.&nbsp;
On two occassions</b>
<br><b>my brother heard a dog growling in one of our bedrooms and was scared
stiff.</b>
<br><b>Our oldest brother said he would come home from school and find
books taken</b>
<br><b>down from his bookshelf as if someone were reading them.</b>
<br><b>One time I heard the distinct sound of someone walking up and down
our stairs</b>
<br><b>while grabbing onto the squeaky railing.&nbsp; I woke up my brother
and he heard</b>
<br><b>it as well.&nbsp; We called the police, who found no signs of entry
at all.&nbsp; They</b>
<br><b>thought we were out of our minds!</b>
<br><b>Another time I was home alone and I swear I saw pages moving in
my mother's</b>
<br><b>cookbook out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; I looked at the cover
of the book,</b>
<br><b>which was about desserts and called "Heavenly Delights".&nbsp; I
left the house</b>
<br><b>until someone else came home.</b>
<br><b>My brother was in the laundry room and while a load was running
in the dryer,</b>
<br><b>the door to the dryer opened and closed right before his eyes.&nbsp;
The door to a</b>
<br><b>dryer doesn't just pop open easily, and opening it usually causes
the dryer</b>
<br><b>to stop.&nbsp; Not this time.</b>
<br><b>I've since moved out of their house, and things have been fairly
uneventful</b>
<br><b>for several years.&nbsp; During the time a lot of these things occurred,
my dad</b>
<br><b>was really skeptical.&nbsp; Then one night he told us that at the
end of a two</b>
<br><b>week vacation he felt like he was not alone in the house during
the day.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>heard doors opening and closing and footsteps as well.&nbsp; Since
then, he</b>
<br><b>brushed off the topic when we brought it up.&nbsp; This weekend,
he made a</b>
<br><b>confession.&nbsp; He recently was waiting for my brother to stop
by on his way</b>
<br><b>home from vacation.&nbsp; Dad was in the bathroom, and heard the
distinct sound of</b>
<br><b>someone right there opening our front door and taking off their
shoes.&nbsp; That</b>
<br><b>was all he heard, and could not believe it when he found no one
in the house</b>
<br><b>or in the driveway!&nbsp; He's not as skeptical as he used to be.</b>
<br><b>A few months ago, my brother was alone in my parent's house while
visiting</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; He swears he smelt my grandfather's pipe (no one was
home and no one</b>
<br><b>there smokes, anyway).&nbsp; He asked my grandfather to show himself
but it didn't</b>
<br><b>happen, and never has.&nbsp; A few minutes later, the mailman came.&nbsp;
In the mail</b>
<br><b>was a letter addressed to my grandfather (who never lived at our
house).&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was from the church asking for a donation, and included a prayer
for the</b>
<br><b>dead.&nbsp; Sorry this is so long, but reading these stories has
made me feel like</b>
<br><b>we are not completely crazy with these experiences.</b>

<p><b>An Entity in Woodstock N.Y.</b>
<p><b>By:animeted_girl@yahoo.com</b>
<p><b>Now, before you jump to conclusions, I was visiting</b>
<br><b>Woodstock back in 1995 on a sunday drive with my</b>
<br><b>husband. No partys, no drugs, no "Woodstock Fest".</b>
<br><b>Just my husband and myself, enjoying the historical</b>
<br><b>area on a sunday drive in July. (Woodstock is about</b>
<br><b>1&amp;1/2 hours from where I lived)</b>
<br><b>We were walking down the main street through town, and</b>
<br><b>I saw a shop that the sign read "Herbs/Health Food",</b>
<br><b>and asked my husband if we could stop and go inside. I</b>
<br><b>wanted to find a vegetarian cookbook, since I was a</b>
<br><b>moderately new vegetarian. It was around 90 degrees</b>
<br><b>outside and the store's door was propped open, with no</b>
<br><b>air conditioning. When I walked in the store, the last</b>
<br><b>thing I saw was a small tower of homemade fudge for</b>
<br><b>sale, and then I couldn't see. Not the funny greenish</b>
<br><b>black from being in a bright area and then trying to</b>
<br><b>see in the dark, but fully blind. I was hit by a wall</b>
<br><b>of frigid cold, and I was attacked by a raging evil</b>
<br><b>thing that tried to crush my heart to kill me. It was</b>
<br><b>so angry- just pure evil. My heart stopped completely</b>
<br><b>and I grabbed at the doorway in terror, running out to</b>
<br><b>the sidewalk (my husband later said that I lurched and</b>
<br><b>allmost fell). I couldn't speak, I was freezing, and</b>
<br><b>shaking violently. My husband had to help me walk and</b>
<br><b>hold me up, and he noticed that I was like an ice cube</b>
<br><b>to the touch. It made no sense, freezing in 90 degree</b>
<br><b>weather in July. My lips were blue with the cold. When</b>
<br><b>I could speak, I had him help me leave the store front</b>
<br><b>as quickly as possible. It took me half an hour for my</b>
<br><b>body to get back to normal temperatures.</b>
<br><b>I hadn't known that there was a psychic/seance</b>
<br><b>woorkshop room above the store until we were leaving</b>
<br><b>town to go home, when my husband told me. My guess is</b>
<br><b>that something went wrong there, and it didn't like</b>
<br><b>me.</b>
<br><b>I don't know- I never went back. Since then, the</b>
<br><b>health food store and psychic studio were closed, and</b>
<br><b>other businesses have moved in. As for the location,</b>
<br><b>it was on the left side of the town if you arrived</b>
<br><b>from the highway, about 2/3 way through the main road.</b>

<br><b>Can't Move</b>
<br><b>By: sailnwitcaptmrgn@yahoo.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;I read about</b>
<br><b>sleep paralysis on your webpage, and that is what I</b>
<br><b>can come up with as far as discerning what happened to</b>
<br><b>me. I was lying in bed around 1pm in the afternoon,</b>
<br><b>which to me is a very strange time to experience</b>
<br><b>apparitions.&nbsp; I was laying in the bed for a few</b>
<br><b>minutes, getting ready to get up, but I just didn't</b>
<br><b>feel like I wanted to get up just yet. I heard the</b>
<br><b>door to my living room open and shut so I thought it</b>
<br><b>was my dad coming home in the afternoon just to visit</b>
<br><b>my dog. I didn't hear his voice so I knew it wasn't</b>
<br><b>him. I was still laying there when I opened my eyes</b>
<br><b>and saw a small boy...maybe 5 or 6 years old with dark</b>
<br><b>black hair walking towards me. I couldn't clearly see</b>
<br><b>his face...just an image. I couldn't move nor could I</b>
<br><b>say anything. At first I thought it was my niece, but</b>
<br><b>then I realized it couldn't possibly be. I didn't know</b>
<br><b>what to do. It kept walking towards me and climbed</b>
<br><b>over me. (I was laying sideways facing left towards my</b>
<br><b>door.) All of a sudden I felt it playing with my</b>
<br><b>hair...like rubbing my hairline like someone would who</b>
<br><b>is comforting you. I realized that this isn't</b>
<br><b>conceivably possible and I turned quickly. It was no</b>
<br><b>longer there. Every hair was standing up on my body. I</b>
<br><b>knew something was in there because I could feel it. I</b>
<br><b>jumped up and ran. I then left the house. I prayed</b>
<br><b>that night and asked it never to return again. I</b>
<br><b>haven't seen it so maybe it's gone. For some reason my</b>
<br><b>sister says it could have been my guardian angel. I</b>
<br><b>was going through a rough time at that point in my</b>
<br><b>life, but I really don't know what it was. I made a</b>
<br><b>mistake a few days earlier talking with my friends</b>
<br><b>saying that it wouldn't be so bad to actually see a</b>
<br><b>ghost. Let's just say I made a big mistake. It scared</b>
<br><b>me so badly. The weird thing is, I believe in A god,</b>
<br><b>but I'm not a Christian. Agnostic, maybe. That better</b>
<br><b>describes me. Anything you can suggest to let me know</b>
<br><b>what you think would ease my mind a little. I've</b>
<br><b>always been scared to sleep in that room since. It's</b>
<br><b>in my parent's house, the room that I grew up in, but</b>
<br><b>now I'm away at college and have been for 2 years.</b>

a numerous amount cold spots, and had heard children laughing and playing
when there was none around.</b>
<br><b>They had turned the classrooms into different offices for different

<br><b>I had a talk with one guy that was working there at the time, and

<br><b>A Little Story</b>
<p><b>By: Kimmyp4136@cs.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>hi i'm Kim Pettella from cumberland Rhode Island and i have a story
for you.</b>
<br><b>When i was a freshman in high school, i took Drama 1 and had a great
teacher.</b>
<br><b>she told us a story about how when she herself was a teenager she
went to</b>
<br><b>Foster, Rhode Island to this supposedly haunted road. She had an
incredible</b>
<br><b>experience that i'll share with you to the best of my memory.</b>
<br><b>they drove up the street which is very narrow and totally dirt(
i've taken</b>
<br><b>many trips up there myself after hearing the story) and stopped
on top of a</b>
<br><b>hill that was in front of the house that was supposed to be haunted.
as they</b>
<br><b>turned the car off they waited. they began to see sparks in back
of the car</b>
<br><b>so they attempted to turn the car back on to drive away, but the
car wouldn't</b>
<br><b>start. this is kind of hrad to believe, but they saw a glowing head(
this</b>
<br><b>part is a little out there) float by the car and suddenly the car
turned on</b>
<br><b>and they drove off.&nbsp; they had a tape recorder in the back of
the car so they</b>
<br><b>could tape any noises that they heard. the tape player first had
their</b>
<br><b>voices, but a different conversation on it, they rewond it, and
it was not</b>
<br><b>them taking anymore but someone else, every time they rewond it,
it was a</b>
<br><b>different conversaton, with different voices. once mrs Frap became
a teacher,</b>
<br><b>she started to tell this story to her students. a group of them
decided to</b>
<br><b>go. so a small group of guys took a van, and a lot of film with
them and</b>
<br><b>slept the night on the road. they saw nothing and heard nothing
unusual. but</b>
<br><b>when they got the pictures back, they saw one picture with a man
sticking his</b>
<br><b>head out from the van, another of a tornado, and another into the
woods of</b>
<br><b>hundreds of red eyes.</b>
<br><b>i went down there myself a few times. ive seen a face appear on
the side of</b>
<br><b>the house, a man in my rearview mirror who was never actually there
and hear</b>
<br><b>moaning coming from all angles. it is a very creepy place. definatly

<br><b>Chilling True Story</b>
<p><b>By: JLugg13@owc.net</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never believed in ghosts, I always thought
that they were</b>
<br><b>mindless and foolish.&nbsp; That is until I encountered one myself.&nbsp;
Here is</b>
<br><b>the story...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a boy, around the age of 14, our family
took a trip to an</b>
<br><b>old house in Virginia that used to be my great-great-great</b>
<br><b>grandfathers.&nbsp; In fact it was a station on the "Underground
Railroad".</b>
<br><b>Well, anyways, my mother and father were very interested in all
the</b>
<br><b>"historic" factors of the house, I loved to explore all the little
nooks</b>
<br><b>and crannies that were used to hide run-away slaves.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was looking around in one of these little
hide-outs (the</b>
<br><b>one&nbsp; behind the pantry) I came across a small bone, about the
size of a</b>
<br><b>worn pencil, I had no idea what significance this sovenier meant
until</b>
<br><b>later that night.&nbsp; For now I just put it in my pocket and hurried
off to</b>
<br><b>find my mother and father.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that night I awoke when a sharp pain in
my arm suddenly jarred</b>
<br><b>my sleep.&nbsp; I instantly sat up and next to me was a tall black
woman, who</b>
<br><b>frightened me very much...( I guess it was because she was slightly</b>
<br><b>transparent) She pulled me by the arm back to the hide-out behind
the</b>
<br><b>pantry.&nbsp; She then explained that she had died here many years
before</b>
<br><b>when she had been found by the "slave-catchers" and had been stabbed
to</b>
<br><b>death, they left her body there to rot while my great-great-great</b>
<br><b>grandfather was hanged for being a conducter on the "Underground</b>
<br><b>Railroad".&nbsp; She then pointed to a dark corner of the tiny room,
I</b>
<br><b>followed her "command" and looked to see what she needed, to my</b>
<br><b>astonishment, there was a full skeleton sitting among a pile of
thin</b>
<br><b>rags, I noticed that one of the finger boness was missing, but I</b>
<br><b>instantly knew where to find it.&nbsp; I reached into my pocket
and there it</b>
<br><b>was, I placed it by the pile of bones and silently listened as the
woman</b>
<br><b>gave me her final command and plea.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said that she promised her family that she
would never rest</b>
<br><b>until the day she was free, so, her question was if I would take
her</b>
<br><b>skeleton to the"north" (we now know this as New England) and give
her a</b>
<br><b>proper burial. Of course, I would not turn down this plea, I mean
who</b>
<br><b>would say no to a ghost? So the next morning I told my parents the
story</b>
<br><b>and of course they didn't believe me but they agreed to have the
police</b>
<br><b>take the body with us to our home in New York. The woman was buried,
and</b>
<br><b>her promise to her family had been accomplished.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I only saw this woman once more in all my years,
the night she was</b>
<br><b>buried, I had a dream, and in the dream I only saw her for an instant,</b>
<br><b>she just smiled and nodded and I knew right then that she could
finally</b>
<br><b>rest.</b>

<p><b>Indian Friend</b>
<p><b>By: rsaa@nts-online.net</b>
<p><b>&nbsp; HI I am 11years and have had many ecounters but I only have
time for one.Once I was staying the night with a friend when&nbsp; all
of a sudden this object appeared it got closer and closer and I couldn't
tell what it was until it came to my right side.It was an Indian girl about13years
old she was mumbling something but I couldn't understand what she was saying
so I&nbsp; said to my friend what is she saying?So my friend Katie which
isn't a chicken like me said speak up to the girl and she spoke up! She
said they have my parents and she started to cry so we calmed her down
and she told us that they killed her parents.So we became frightened but
we found out it was along time ago and they would'nt come after us.The
next day we did&nbsp; some research on her house and found out her house
was built on an old Indian camp and a small family was killed by white
men.When the girl came back we told her what happened and needless to say
I guess she found her unfinished business.</b>

<p><b>Jolly Roger Hotel Ghost</b>
<p><b>By: BrookieL99@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Hi, I was recently in Wildwood NJ and stayed in a hotel called the
Jolly</b>
<br><b>Roger.&nbsp; I was sleeping on the sofa bed in the earlier morning
hours when I</b>
<br><b>felt someone sit next to me on the bed. (ya know that feeling when
like only</b>
<br><b>a part of the bed moves).&nbsp; Well I knew that I didn't hear anyone
walk in the</b>
<br><b>room but I figured I'd turn over anyway to see if someone came in
so quietly</b>
<br><b>that I didn't hear them.&nbsp; When I turned over there was nothing
there.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>first thing I did was wave my hand in the area I felt the movement
from.</b>
<br><b>When I felt nothing I looked down on the sheets.&nbsp; Sure enough
there was a</b>
<br><b>small print in the sheets that looks like when you sit on a bed.&nbsp;
I wasn't</b>
<br><b>scared, just kinda weirded out.&nbsp; I dont know what it was but
I think later in</b>
<br><b>the vacation it was messing with me turning the lights on after
I'd turn them</b>
<br><b>off and taking my room key out of my purse and putting it on the
floor right</b>
<br><b>in front of me.&nbsp; Not enough to drive me nuts but a little on
the strange</b>
<br><b>side.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well I love your site and can read it for hours.&nbsp;
This story isn't half</b>
<br><b>as good as the ones you ahve but I figured I'd put in my info.&nbsp;
Thanks for</b>
<br><b>listening...</b>

<p><b>A Few Things I've Experienced</b>
<p><b>By:melissafimreite@hotmail.com</b>
<p><b>My mother has seen ghosts (her dead aunt visiting and comforting
her), and</b>
<br><b>has always had "feelings". Two times stick out in my memory. The
first one</b>
<br><b>happened when my older sister was about 16, her boyfriend wanted
her to come</b>
<br><b>along cruising the lakes in South Minneapolis, but my mom wouldn't
let her,</b>
<br><b>and couldn't give a "logical" reason why not. There was a huge screaming</b>
<br><b>fight, but Mom prevailed (as usual). Later, we learned that the
boyfriend</b>
<br><b>had crashed the car and the person in the front passenger seat was
in a coma</b>
<br><b>and later died. My sister would have been sitting there if she had
been</b>
<br><b>allowed to go.</b>
<br><b>Another time, when I was about 12 or 13, I had been invited by some</b>
<br><b>girlfriends to go and see "Rocky Horror Picture Show" and spend
the night at</b>
<br><b>my friend's house. The friend's mom had agreed to chaperone the
party, so</b>
<br><b>all seemed kosher. Mom adamantly refused to let me go. After much
crying and</b>
<br><b>pointing out that we would be in the company of a responsible adult,
blah</b>
<br><b>blah blah, Mom agreed that I could go to the movie, but could not
sleep</b>
<br><b>over. I pouted, but took what I could get. I went home at about
2:30 am</b>
<br><b>after the movie. Well, I called my friend's house the next day to
find out</b>
<br><b>what I had missed and found out that my friends had been molested
early in</b>
<br><b>the morning by a young man who had let himself in the unlocked front
door!</b>
<br><b>(We later learned that it was the mentally handicapped paperboy.
Since that</b>
<br><b>incident, I always obey my mother's "feelings" -- If she suggests
something</b>
<br><b>is not a good idea, and has no logical explanation, I just don't
do it!</b>
<br><b>On to the present, I recently (9 months ago) moved into a house
with 3 other</b>
<br><b>people. I haven't seen or heard anything really scary, but some
unusual</b>
<br><b>things have come to my attention. We have two dogs and two cats,
and we have</b>
<br><b>all seen all four animals concentrate on one particular corner of
the living</b>
<br><b>room, up near the ceiling in the entryway. This has happened several
times.</b>
<br><b>No vocalization, cold spot, or anything, just four critters staring
at the</b>
<br><b>same corner of the ceiling. Upon investigation, there are never
any shadows,</b>
<br><b>insects, cobwebs, or anything in that corner. Before we moved in,
we</b>
<br><b>"cleansed" the house with a smudge stick, and we still have some
left, so</b>
<br><b>one of my housemates burned it in that corner for a few minutes
with the</b>
<br><b>front door open, and the animals stopped concentrating on it for
a while. A</b>
<br><b>couple of months later it happened again, we cleansed it, and it
went away.</b>
<br><b>(an aside, as I was writing this, I heard the screen door open and
close. A</b>
<br><b>very distinct sound, a latch-squeak-latch sound. Could have been
my</b>
<br><b>imagination - so many ghost stories!)</b>
<br><b>Lastly, I have smelled a "phantom odor" in our upstairs bathroom.
It smells</b>
<br><b>like a cold wood fire, you know, after the fire goes out and there's</b>
<br><b>half-burned logs laying there still smelling of smoke. We don't
have a</b>
<br><b>fireplace, nor do any of our neighbors on the block as far as I
know. It's a</b>
<br><b>really stale-smelling smokey odor. It comes and goes. For about
a week maybe</b>
<br><b>in April or May, it was really strong, like someone had left a pile
of</b>
<br><b>smokey clothes from a bonfire or camping in the bathroom, but there
were no</b>
<br><b>clothes or even dirty towels left in there. I was curious about
the smell,</b>
<br><b>so I sniffed around the room and it seemed to be centered in the
room,</b>
<br><b>slightly closer to the East side, but definitely not coming from
the window</b>
<br><b>over the bathtub or the closet just to the south of the tub. (I
sniffed</b>
<br><b>those areas first). I asked my housemates to come in and sniff,
but they</b>
<br><b>were unable to smell anything, even when the smell was very strong
to me.</b>
<br><b>Since then it's come back intermittently, but not as strong. I am
unable to</b>
<br><b>determine any cause for the smell, I just wrote it off until I started</b>
<br><b>reading other people's stories about phantom smells. As far as I
know, our</b>
<br><b>house has never burned or anything. I still have no explanation
for it.</b>
<br><b>Any questions, please feel free to email me, although I haven't
had any</b>
<br><b>direct contact with "the spirit world" I do believe that they are
all around us.</b>
