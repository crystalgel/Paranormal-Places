<b>Haunted Mansion</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PDL147852@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>On monday night I went to this haunted mansion with my friends and
two of us</b>
<br><b>walked around with a hand held tape recorder asking the at least
nine resident spirits</b>
<br><b>questions. I was mystified by the my findings. On the third floor
where suppodely the more</b>
<br><b>evil spirits were banished the local minister you can barely hear</b>
<br><b>whispering between questions, no words just a whispering. I then
went to the first</b>
<br><b>and stood on the exact spot where a murder took place and the tape
is blank of</b>
<br><b>mine or any other voices the whole time I stood on that spot. I
then went</b>
<br><b>to the downstairs kitchen where the light always turns itself on
and a lady</b>
<br><b>in a cape is seen running through the walls and door. I started
asking</b>
<br><b>questions in there when objects started banging and flying around.
You can hear the</b>
<br><b>clamor on the tape until you hear me say lets get the F outta here
and we</b>
<br><b>ran from the kitchen. Last stop the basement, me and my friends
were hiding</b>
<br><b>down there until the caretaker left then we were goin to do some
real</b>
<br><b>exploring. He wouldn't leave so we gave up for the night and slipped
out the side</b>
<br><b>door. Almost the whole time we were in the basement the loud ticking
of a clock</b>
<br><b>can be heard on the tape. My friend said it was the big clock one
floor above</b>
<br><b>but I dont think so, too distinct. Did I mention there's supposedly
a body</b>
<br><b>brried in the dirt floor of that basement? Once I get some copies
made I'll try</b>
<br><b>to send you one even though its too long and sporatic for Ghost
Sounds. I'm</b>
<br><b>also going to send you stories of my more 'In your face' ghost experiences
of</b>
<br><b>which I've had over twelve. I'm also going to send a two stories
that</b>
<br><b>happended to a former roommate of mine. One is of a cursed patch
of land</b>
<br><b>on her father's farm, the other is when she saw a neiborhood boy
walking the</b>
<br><b>streets late at night after his death.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Special Moment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: amy@farago.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I am going to attempt to retell and event that has had a long-lasting</b>
<br><b>effect on me. Unfortunately, my father passed away after a battle
with cancer and</b>
<br><b>due to circumstances beyond my control our family home was sold
and I</b>
<br><b>moved into a house of my own, a house that my father had never visited.</b>
<br><b>Fortunately, I&nbsp; inherited a number of his personal possessions
as well as</b>
<br><b>our family furniture.</b>
<br><b>It was about six weeks after my father had passed, and needless
to say it</b>
<br><b>was a very difficult time for me. Well, my mother had also passed
away and</b>
<br><b>being an only child my father was my hero, he was everything to
me. The</b>
<br><b>only family I had left was my two grandmothers and my aunt. When
an individual</b>
<br><b>dies there are so many things that need to be taken care of for
example</b>
<br><b>the reading of the will. Thank God that my father's lawyer was a
great friend</b>
<br><b>and was very serious about my future and well-being; for which I
am</b>
<br><b>grateful.</b>
<br><b>The particular event that I am about to describe occured late on
the</b>
<br><b>evening of day our lawyer read my father's will. I was home alone,
which was not</b>
<br><b>unsual because I lived alone. I was reclining in my father favorite</b>
<br><b>leather chair reflecting on my life, wondering where I would go
from here, what</b>
<br><b>would I do? I could not help but think what would my father say,
go back</b>
<br><b>to graduate school, get a job, I was so confused. Terribly frustrated,
I just</b>
<br><b>stayed in the chair, it felt so good; my hands touching the worn
leather</b>
<br><b>on the arm rests. Apparently I fell a sleep, and began to dream.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, I was in the middle of a very bizarre yet comforting dream.</b>
<br><b>Unavoidably, I was very upset about my father's death and I had
been</b>
<br><b>trying to deal with my step-mother and her needs, while supporting
my</b>
<br><b>eighty-seven year old grandmother who had burried the last of her
children. I recall</b>
<br><b>feeling very pressured by everyone, but being the person that I
am; I was</b>
<br><b>very patient. In this dream the telephone rang and it rang. I remember
how</b>
<br><b>I could not find the telephone, I could see the cord, but I could
not get to</b>
<br><b>the phone. The ringing was very loud and seemed to resonate off</b>
<br><b>everything, almost like and echo. Finally, I got to the telephone,
I answered it and</b>
<br><b>the voice on the other end of the reciever was my father's. The
first thing</b>
<br><b>that he said to me was that he wanted to apologize for not always
being there</b>
<br><b>for me and for becomming sick. He told me that he because he went
into coma he</b>
<br><b>did not have a chance to tell how much he loved me, and how he would
miss</b>
<br><b>being a part of my life.He told me that everything would eventually
work</b>
<br><b>out for me, I would finish school and then I would move to the east
coast and</b>
<br><b>get a great job. I did not beleive this at the time.</b>
<br><b>Mentally, I was so not ready for the pressures of school or for
moving,</b>
<br><b>afterall I had just moved into a new house, why would I move again?
All</b>
<br><b>that I remember saying to my father way that I loved him very much,
but I was</b>
<br><b>so angry that he became ill, why him, why now? I remember a great
feeling of</b>
<br><b>relief after hearing his voice, it was so soothing, he was no longer
sick</b>
<br><b>and was now free from the confines of his disease. My father was
now at</b>
<br><b>peace. As I awoke, I felt disorientated, for I had fallen asleep
in the</b>
<br><b>recliner, and when I realized where I was; to my amazement I was
holding</b>
<br><b>the telephone reciever in my right hand. There was no dial tone,
and there was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;not that annoying beeping; like when a phone has been left
off the hook,</b>
<br><b>it was just silence. The irony of this whole experience is that
I did go back</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;to school and recieved my degree in Art History, and I also
moved away, to</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;New York City. In some sense of the word I have achieved closure,
just</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;hearing his voice and knowing that he will always love me
and that he</b>
<br><b>knows where he can find me.</b>

<br><b>The Ghost of Victor Lawson</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Renoir1966@att.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>It's so great to hear some of these stories! They have either given
me the</b>
<br><b>chills or touched me. I have a very small experience, I don't know
if it's</b>
<br><b>"ghostly", but I believe it was something:</b>
<br><b>I live in Chicago at the Lawson House, formerly known as the Victor
Lawson</b>
<br><b>YMCA. I first moved in due to unfortunate circumstances {homelessness},</b>
<br><b>and have been here for two years. This buliding was erectecd back
in 1909 by</b>
<br><b>Victor Lawson, a prominent businessman here in Chicago back in the
early</b>
<br><b>1900s. The building has now been refurbished, but it retains many
aspects</b>
<br><b>of its original splendor: gold leafed moldings on the ceilings,
original</b>
<br><b>fixtures, and rooms on the second floor that were the original</b>
<br><b>"gentlemen's"rooms and library.</b>
<br><b>I had met my friend Bill here, who started me off on what I believed
to be</b>
<br><b>a little joke. Before building renovations began six months after
I arrived</b>
<br><b>here, one of the elevators in the building would always stop on
the third</b>
<br><b>floor. When this would happen, Bill would say "Oh- that's just Victor</b>
<br><b>getting off." As far as I know, Mr. Lawson never died in this building.</b>
<br><b>However,his offices were situated on the third floor. Possibly since
this</b>
<br><b>building was his namesake, after Victor has passed on he just might
have</b>
<br><b>come here to "keep an eye on things"? Bill most certainly believed
it.</b>
<br><b>Little did I know I would soon begin to believe it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, I got tired of waiting for those
rickety elevators, and</b>
<br><b>decided to take the stairs. As I was going up the grand stairwell
from the</b>
<br><b>second to the third floor, I caught a blur out of the corner of
my eye</b>
<br><b>that was coming down the stairs to the left of me. It was certainly
man shaped,</b>
<br><b>in a dark suit that was most definitely antiquated. At first I thought</b>
<br><b>nothing of it, as it is common for many of this building's denizens
to be</b>
<br><b>wearing ragged or out-dated attire. However, as I turned back for
a second</b>
<br><b>look to see if I could recognize this stranger, there was noone
behind me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never saw anything again, and renovations
continued. The elevator</b>
<br><b>continued its nightly ritual of stopping on the third floor until
one</b>
<br><b>night it stopped. That night was the day they rededicated the building
from the</b>
<br><b>Victor Lawson YMCA to Lawson House. I guess Victor believed his
job as</b>
<br><b>caretaker was done!</b>

<br><b>Little Cemetery In Michigan</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SMi1213286@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I come from a really small farm community in Michigan called
Sunfield.</b>
<br><b>There is this little cemetery, on the outskirts of the town, keep
in mind this is</b>
<br><b>a really small town, and when I was growing up I heard all kinds
of rumors</b>
<br><b>that their was a santanic church next to the cemetry, and witches
and warlock</b>
<br><b>gather there every seven years to do human sacrifies.&nbsp; I never
once</b>
<br><b>checked the place out until this year, and I live in lansing now.</b>
<br><b>some friends and I went to check out the church in the daylight,
and we</b>
<br><b>saw a&nbsp; really small church, it looked kind of rundown, it was
out in the middle</b>
<br><b>of a woods too.&nbsp; We walked out in the woods part, and we saw
a wooden cross,</b>
<br><b>and a pulpit outside, the whole thing really gave me the chills.</b>
<br><b>About a month later we went back there and we went to the cemetry
right</b>
<br><b>next to the church.&nbsp; It was about ten at night, so it was really
dark.&nbsp; About</b>
<br><b>five minutes before we got the cemetery I was getting some really
weird chilling</b>
<br><b>visions.&nbsp; We were shooting a movie out there, we park the car,
then we</b>
<br><b>walked out to the grave stones to shoot the movie.&nbsp; We had
brought an ouija board</b>
<br><b>just for a prop, but we had left it in the trunk of the car.&nbsp;
While we</b>
<br><b>were out in the graves we saw light s glowing from some of the headstones,
but</b>
<br><b>that might of been reflection.&nbsp; We were there about five minutes
and we hear a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;bunch of metal clinking, and I got really scared and I made
every one</b>
<br><b>leave. We were on the road for about 20 minutes to a half hour later
out of the</b>
<br><b>blue> the trunk of our car pops open.&nbsp; We opened the trunk
up and the ouija</b>
<br><b>board was still there but it had not moved, but the trunk came open
for no</b>
<br><b>reason at all.</b>

<br><b>Haunted Mortuary</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wagoncop@cei.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I have the unique prospective of having retired from the medical</b>
<br><b>examiners office as an investigator and being a licenced embalmer.
Some</b>
<br><b>years ago I was working in a funeral home as the on call embalmer
which</b>
<br><b>meant that I would be called out at all hours of the night. I lived
in</b>
<br><b>an apartment upstairs from the mortuary and on my first night there
I</b>
<br><b>went down to the chapel for something, I thought I saw a figure
turn the</b>
<br><b>corner and knowing I should be alone went in search, never found</b>
<br><b>anything and put it off to being tired. Several weeks later I was
alone</b>
<br><b>in the prep room with the body of a young girl who had been killed
in a</b>
<br><b>traffic accident, my back was to the door and I felt someone watching</b>
<br><b>me, as I quickly turned I could see out of the corner of my eye
the</b>
<br><b>figure of a tall man in a black coat turn, I went quickly to the
door</b>
<br><b>but no one was around and since the outer door was closed he could
not</b>
<br><b>have left without me at least hearing the door shut. In the next
year I</b>
<br><b>came to understand that he only appearred when a young woman had
died.</b>
<br><b>Finally I got the nerve to tell somebody about him and to my surprise,</b>
<br><b>others had seem the figure also but chose, until I spoke out, to
keep</b>
<br><b>quiet. The man who owned the mortuary was there and asked what I
had</b>
<br><b>seen, when I described the figure he went all white and said that
I had</b>
<br><b>just described his father who started the funeral home years ago
and</b>
<br><b>whom I had never even seen a picture of.</b>

<br><b>Looking for Answers</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I've written you before, and I've been kind of hesitant about
telling</b>
<br><b>you or anyone this. I guess I'm not really looking for help but
maybe</b>
<br><b>answers. First of all I am a christian and I believe that when we
depart</b>
<br><b>this world we do not come back. It says so in the bible. I was raised
in</b>
<br><b>a Catholic/Buddist home. My mother is vietnamese. Growing up she
would</b>
<br><b>tell us all these strange stories about herself and how she realized</b>
<br><b>that she was sort of pyshic. Now she couldn't touch things to see
into</b>
<br><b>the future , she'd look at the cards and what not. She claimed that
a</b>
<br><b>young girl dressed in white appeared to her when she was around
9 years</b>
<br><b>old and has remained with her. She would tell my mother what to
say to</b>
<br><b>these people. Now my siblings and myself grew up seeing people come
in</b>
<br><b>and out of our home for my mother's help. It seemed normal to us.
She</b>
<br><b>claimed that she would see the dead and that they would try to</b>
<br><b>communicate to her. Now as a child I was terrified of the dark because</b>
<br><b>of her stories. I didn't know if she was for real or if she needed
to be</b>
<br><b>committed. She has told me that some people have surprised her and
have</b>
<br><b>asked if the little girl in the white dress was her daughter. Claiming</b>
<br><b>that some people did see her invisible companion. I am not terrified
of</b>
<br><b>my mother now, but I can remember living at home and always being</b>
<br><b>terrified of being alone. It seemed like something horrible lurking</b>
<br><b>around. Like the feeling you get anticipating something bad a heaviness.</b>
<br><b>We were not the Brady Bunch, there was alot of arguing and fighting
in</b>
<br><b>our homes. I couldn't wait to leave home when I turned 16. It seemed
so</b>
<br><b>depressing. Her stories haunted me through my childhood. She still
reads</b>
<br><b>the cards to people and they always claime that she is right , I
had her</b>
<br><b>read mine one time many years ago. No more. My parents lives are
like a</b>
<br><b>dead end because they can never move up in life. And I am serious
when I</b>
<br><b>say I feel a certain heaviness when I go home. It's almost like
I'm not</b>
<br><b>really alone with her. As if this presence resents me there. I use
to</b>
<br><b>think maybe I'm overeacting because of all the things she has told
me.</b>
<br><b>Who knows. She once had this woman bring her daughter over to our
house</b>
<br><b>because the woman said she was possessed by her dead husband. She
brings</b>
<br><b>the girl and she stops dead at the entrance of our hallway because
we</b>
<br><b>have a cross hanging on the wall. She would not enter the diningroom.</b>
<br><b>This account by the way came from my younger sister, the sceptic,
but</b>
<br><b>the truthteller. Anyhow she said the girl looked almost demonic
that my</b>
<br><b>sister refused to pass her to get to the stairs to get downstairs
to our</b>
<br><b>room. We always left the room or the house if possible when my mother</b>
<br><b>was at work. And there have been other incidents but I have to go.
But</b>
<br><b>mainly about this presence she talks about. She has brainedwash
my</b>
<br><b>brother into believing all this that he claims that he has outer
body</b>
<br><b>experiences. and he has to stay high or drunk to keep them from</b>
<br><b>occuring. Needless to say that 's one heck of an excuse to stay
lit all</b>
<br><b>the time. I mean I believe there are ghosts but I don't think they
are</b>
<br><b>spirits of those who once lived. I believe that they could be something</b>
<br><b>else using these people's images to play or toy with us. Who knows.
But</b>
<br><b>thanks for your time. I've only talked to my siblings about this
we were</b>
<br><b>always afraid to talk to others about it.</b>

<br><b>TV Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LEGALBABY@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My stepmother told
me this story, and I believe her.&nbsp; She also has</b>
<br><b>two witnesses who say that what she says is true.&nbsp; About a
month ago my</b>
<br><b>step mom had an experience.&nbsp; Her daughter April walked into
her bedroom and</b>
<br><b>woke her up.&nbsp; I was in Fort Bliss, TX, and my father was in
Miss. for training.</b>
<br><b>We are both ARMY and we were out of town when this happened.&nbsp;
I live in</b>
<br><b>Alabama.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, my stepsister woke my stepmother
up and told her that she</b>
<br><b>thought that her TV was possessed.&nbsp; My mom thought that she
was crazy, and</b>
<br><b>done lost her mind or something.&nbsp; So she thought that she would
humor her</b>
<br><b>and go see what she was talking about.&nbsp; Well, when she went
in there the TV</b>
<br><b>was sure enough on and on channel 66.&nbsp; She watched it and it
went to 6 and</b>
<br><b>then to channel seven.&nbsp; 66- 6-&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; She didn't tell
me if it were 06 or 07.</b>
<br><b>Just that it would go from 66-6-7.</b>
<br><b>I am at this point all ready skeptical and looking for the punch
line.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>first thoughts was that the remote was in the bed or it was a trick
on</b>
<br><b>her. She is the real skeptical.&nbsp; Nothing scares her, she is
a nurse.&nbsp; So she</b>
<br><b>thought that the remote was messing up.&nbsp; It was a brand new
remote,</b>
<br><b>universal, and she thought that it may be messing up.&nbsp; April
told her to</b>
<br><b>pick up the remote and look at it.&nbsp; It didn't have any batteries
in it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That isn't the weird part.&nbsp;
My stepmother Sherry said it must be a</b>
<br><b>glitch in the TV and then it ran through the channels, all the channels,</b>
<br><b>really fast.&nbsp; It then dawned on her to ask if it was her brother,
her very</b>
<br><b>close brother who shot himself recently, and then the TV went to
changing</b>
<br><b>channels like crazy.&nbsp; My mom is not scared and still not a
believer at</b>
<br><b>this point.&nbsp; April however, is white as a, pardon the expression,
"GHOST."</b>
<br><b>Then she ask the "TV" another question, it again went crazy.&nbsp;
She then said</b>
<br><b>wait and told the "TV" that they had to establish some commutative
code. She</b>
<br><b>suggested that the "TV" GO UP A CHANNEL for yes and DOWN a channel
for no.</b>
<br><b>It went to channel 8, then back to 7.&nbsp; It stayed on 7, and
moved from</b>
<br><b>there. When she asked it no questions, it would go to 6 and back
to 7.&nbsp; This went</b>
<br><b>on all night long.&nbsp; I did leave one part out though, there
was another person</b>
<br><b>in the room, a 5 month old baby who stared intensely at the TV the
whole</b>
<br><b>time.</b>
<br><b>I believe my mother, and she has no reason to lie and many witnesses.&nbsp;
Two</b>
<br><b>teenagers and a 5 month old baby.&nbsp; She ask her "brother" if
she would</b>
<br><b>"talk" to him again and he said "8 and back to 7" which she interrupted
to a yes.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Hi, I would like to share an experience of mine with you.&nbsp;
When I was 16</b>
<br><b>years old my younger brother died at the age of 15.&nbsp; It was
a illness</b>
<br><b>where he got sick on Tuesday and died on Sunday never did find out
what did it.</b>
<br><b>Well anyway I had already been scheduled to have my tonsils removed
about</b>
<br><b>2 weeks after that event.&nbsp; At that time you went in the night
before you had</b>
<br><b>surgery the next day.&nbsp; So I had gone in the night before and
all and about</b>
<br><b>midnight I woke and there stood my brother standing beside the bed.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>guess I really just didn't remember where I was or that he was gone
because it</b>
<br><b>didn't scare me or even seem strange.&nbsp; He smiled at me and
I smiled back</b>
<br><b>and I went back to sleep. I feel he was just coming to let me know
that he was</b>
<br><b>okay and that I was going to be okay too.&nbsp; I had a hard time
with that</b>
<br><b>surgery and lost 16 pounds the next week.&nbsp; Never have surgery
after such a</b>
<br><b>traumatic event because it is really harder to recover because you
are so</b>
<br><b>emotionally out of it.&nbsp; I've never seen him again but it is
almost like I</b>
<br><b>can feel him though and I feel he is my guardian angel.&nbsp; Just
thought I</b>
<br><b>would share that.&nbsp; I really enjoy all the stories.&nbsp; This
was my only ghost</b>

<br><b>Saratoga Lights</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:KFord42498@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Many of you have probably heard of the Saratoga Lights located
in Texas,</b>
<br><b>for they have been on several TV shows and featured in Readers Digest.
The</b>
<br><b>skeptics claim the lights are nothing more than swamp gas. I can
assure</b>
<br><b>you from my own personal encounters, this is impossible. I have
visited the</b>
<br><b>site many times, each with something to make a believer out of me.
Here is just</b>
<br><b>one of those visits.</b>
<br><b>At the time I lived about 30 miles from the Saratoga Road and hadn't
been</b>
<br><b>there in 8 years. I was telling a friend of my husband about an
experience</b>
<br><b>I had had when I was 18. He, being a huge skeptic, insisted we go
together.</b>
<br><b>My husband agreed, having never been himself and thinking I was
making it all</b>
<br><b>up. So, my husband {we are no longer married} whose name is Gary,
myself</b>
<br><b>and our friend, Danny, took off for the Lights. Having been there
before, I</b>
<br><b>was asked to give directions. I told them we were getting near when
we pass</b>
<br><b>the old hotel on the left. Danny had lived around the area most
of his life</b>
<br><b>and said he had no idea what Hotel I was talking about. Just then
we passed it</b>
<br><b>and I told them it was the next road. Now no one saw the Hotel but
me. We</b>
<br><b>turned onto Saratoga Road and drove it to the other end. The road
is</b>
<br><b>straight as an arrow with no side roads off of it. Having seen nothing,
I began to</b>
<br><b>take a lot of ribbing from those two. I persuaded them to turn around
and</b>
<br><b>drive it one more time. As we turned the Chevy love pickup around
I began</b>
<br><b>to shout, "Come on Light, they don't believe me. Show em what ya
got." No</b>
<br><b>sooner were the words out of my mouth than the Light appeared about
100 yards in</b>
<br><b>front of us. No longer could you hear the sounds of the forest crickets</b>
<br><b>and frogs. Not a sound except the truck motor. Danny swore it was
a</b>
<br><b>motorcycle,</b>
<br><b>so Gary killed the truck to listen. Not one sound could be heard,
yet the</b>
<br><b>Light was still approaching us. It stood about waist high to the
average</b>
<br><b>person and moved ever so slightly back and forth as if it were a
lantern</b>
<br><b>in someone's hand. Getting a little spooked Gary decided to start
the truck</b>
<br><b>and get the heck out of there. The truck wouldn't start and I began
to laugh.</b>
<br><b>I could hear myself laughing louder and louder but couldn't stop.
Gary is</b>
<br><b>very much a redneck and never leaves home without his gun, a 22
rifle. My</b>
<br><b>laughter is getting worse and he insists I shut the hell up. Normally,
I would not</b>
<br><b>have given him any reason to be angry and would have loved to shut
up,</b>
<br><b>However, I couldn't stop. I literally had tears running down my
face.</b>
<br><b>Well, this infuriated Gary, and he pulled the 22 out from under
the seat and</b>
<br><b>threatened to shoot me if I didn't stop. Even that didn't work,
if</b>
<br><b>anything it made it worse. Luckily for me, Danny had the wits about
him to reach</b>
<br><b>across me and grab the rifle from Gary. I stopped laughing immediately.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; By this time we were all scared silly and just wanted
to go home. Now</b>
<br><b>the light was about 25 yards away. Gary gave the truck another try
and it</b>
<br><b>roared to life. It's a wonder he didn't blow the motor maxing out
those Rpm's. We</b>
<br><b>headed straight for the light determined to run it down. Just as
we were</b>
<br><b>almost on top of it, it disappeared. Looking behind us, it was now
a good</b>
<br><b>50 yards behind us and coming our way. We turned the truck around
to face it</b>
<br><b>and again it disappeared. Looking behind us we saw no sign of it.
Gary was so</b>
<br><b>scared he couldn't drive and stopped to switch places with Danny.
When he</b>
<br><b>got back in the truck I could hear him sniffling, but made no comment.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hardly spoke a word on the ride to Danny's.
Pulling in his yard, we</b>
<br><b>bid him good night with nervous laughter saying we would definitely
go back</b>
<br><b>again. Gary was behind the wheel sniffling and mumbling "The Light
got me"</b>
<br><b>over and over. I was so shook up I didn't respond. That is until
we got</b>
<br><b>home. Upon entering the house I flipped on the lights and saw Gary's
face. His</b>
<br><b>nose was laid open to the bone and the sniffling I had heard was
him sniffling</b>
<br><b>the blood running down it. I don't know how long I screamed, but
Gary had no</b>
<br><b>idea why I was. I convinced him to look in the mirror and when he
did, we both</b>
<br><b>began to cry. All he could remember was a cold sensation coming
over him</b>
<br><b>when he and Danny switched places and the feeling that The Light
was</b>
<br><b>responsible. His nose took 10 stitches by the way.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we did go back and the next trip was even
more unexplainable. As</b>
<br><b>for the mysterious Hotel, Danny researched it and took me there
in the</b>
<br><b>daylight. It is nothing but a vacant lot where a Hotel once stood.
It was torn down</b>
<br><b>after the family that owned it was murdered some years ago. I have
no idea</b>
<br><b>why I see it, but everytime I have ever been I always know we turn
right</b>
<br><b>past the old Hotel. I have since moved from Texas and have encounter
other</b>
<br><b>things of this nature in my travels to other states.</b>

<br><b>The Old School House Children</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: the zoo crew</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several years ago, I had moved into an old apt.
building with my three young daughters. I had</b>
<br><b>just divorced, and had to settle for what I could afford.&nbsp;
The building was old, very old.&nbsp; I had</b>
<br><b>moved into my new "home" in July.&nbsp; My daughters were 8,7 and
two months old.&nbsp; With kids this</b>
<br><b>young, I had numerous toys throughout the apartment.&nbsp; Every
night, I would give the kids their</b>
<br><b>bath, pick up their toys, then get my bath and get ready for bed,
as I had to wake up at 4:30</b>
<br><b>every morning for work.</b>
<br><b>One night, after picking up the toys, I went into the bathroom.
I heard something hit the floor,</b>
<br><b>and went to check it out.&nbsp; My daughters' Teddy Ruxpin was sitting
in the middle of the living</b>
<br><b>room floor.&nbsp; I kind of brushed it off, like no big deal.&nbsp;
Several nights later, after picking up</b>
<br><b>the toys, I was in bed, just about asleep. I heard the one toy "talking"--it
was an electronic</b>
<br><b>ball, that when rolled, would turn the picture of an animal to the
top, the ball would say "D-</b>
<br><b>Duck--the duck says Quack", or dog, cat, etc.&nbsp; This continued
several times.&nbsp; I thought another</b>
<br><b>toy was pushing against it, causing it to repeat itself.&nbsp; Being
quiet, to not wake my kids, I</b>
<br><b>tip-toed to the living room.&nbsp; The ball went rolling right in
front of me.&nbsp; I was so stunned, I</b>
<br><b>could not move. I thought I heard a Whoosh sound, but by this time,
I didn't know what I seen or</b>
<br><b>heard anymore!</b>
<br><b>Several months went past, the toys would be placed through out the
house, the Teddy Ruxpin would</b>
<br><b>play by itself all night long,&nbsp; and things were just "different"
in that apt.</b>
<br><b>One night, I was hearing the ball play over and over, and couldn't
take it anymore. I got up the</b>
<br><b>courage, went to the kitchen and got a knife and a scissors, and
placed one under each side of</b>
<br><b>the mattress.&nbsp; I told my mom about this, and as expected, she
thought I had gone Fruit Loops on</b>
<br><b>her.</b>
<br><b>A few nights later, my daughter--then 8, woke me up screaming. She
said "Mommy, make it stop!"</b>
<br><b>The light was on the other side of the room, so I went to her room
in the dark. I&nbsp; caught an</b>
<br><b>image out of the corner of my eye, and she said "why is my rocking
chair moving in the air?</b>
<br><b>Mommy, my teddy bear is swinging in the air, and I want it to stop!"&nbsp;
The kids were all to young</b>
<br><b>to understand what was happening. I didn't mention a word about
it in front of them.&nbsp; I grabbed</b>
<br><b>all three of my kids and had them sleep on my bed, as I watched
over them until daylight. I had</b>
<br><b>gone to work, told them what happened. The majority advice I got,
was " GET OUT!"</b>
<br><b>I met a guy, who was staying the night the following night after
the bear was break dancing in</b>
<br><b>mid air.&nbsp; I did not mention a word to him, as I didn't want
to chase him away.&nbsp; He went to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, long after the kids were asleep. He came over to me, woke
me up, and said "the most</b>
<br><b>eerie thing just happened to me!"&nbsp; He told me that a glowing
orange light had surrounded his feet</b>
<br><b>, it was cold.&nbsp; I told him he was crazy--the truth was I was
now terrified! The very next day, I</b>
<br><b>found another apt. to move into.&nbsp; Perhaps by mistake, we talked
about moving into a new apt. IN</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; old apt. The toys were now being moved even during day
light hours. The teddy Ruxpin was</b>
<br><b>moving its mouth constantly--but no sound emitted from it. My boyfriend
said "thats easy to</b>
<br><b>solve--take the batteries out". I told him feel free to do so. He
flipped the bear over, to</b>
<br><b>discover there were no batteries in it.&nbsp; Needless to say, I
was completely moved out that weekend</b>
<br><b>.&nbsp; While I moved out in August, it was extremely cold in the
apt.</b>
<br><b>Curiousity got the best of me, and I checked into the building.
Here, it was like the second</b>
<br><b>oldest building in the old town, and it was once a school house!&nbsp;
I was told by someone that</b>
<br><b>since I was the first one to have children live in that house, the
spirits "came out" .&nbsp; How</b>
<br><b>lucky for me, huh?&nbsp; I was also told that by having the kids
move in, they felt that I accepted</b>
<br><b>children, and they felt safe by coming out in front of me.&nbsp;
The building has been rented out</b>
<br><b>several times over the past 7-8 years.&nbsp; It is located in Robesonia,
PA.</b>
<br><b>I lived in a few other places, and only had a few "odd" things happen
to me.&nbsp; That house was</b>
<br><b>enough for me!!!!&nbsp; My kids often talk about the swinging teddy--they
remember it well, even after</b>
<br><b>all these years!</b>

<p><b>A Haunted Childhood</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: laura8@primus.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>When our family moved from Western Australia to Queensland many years</b>
<br><b>ago, strange things started to happen when we moved into our new
home.</b>
<br><b>Things never went well between our parents and my father left us.
My</b>
<br><b>sister and I always slept in the same bed because as soon as we
went to</b>
<br><b>bed strange and scary things started to happen. I remember one night
my</b>
<br><b>sister and I were fighting with each other and mum had finally had</b>
<br><b>enough so she seperated us for the night. During the course of the
night</b>
<br><b>I woke to hear a draging sound. I sat up in my bed and looked at
the</b>
<br><b>door. I had a footstool against the door and it was moving to let
the</b>
<br><b>door open. I was frozen in my bed and a woman walked in holding
a</b>
<br><b>candle. I couldn't scream or move. All I could do was look and blink
to</b>
<br><b>see if I was seeing things. She has a very long dressing gown on
and she</b>
<br><b>glowed as she walked towards me. She must have been a matter of
inches</b>
<br><b>from me when she disappeared. Finally I could move and I looked
at the</b>
<br><b>door and it was open. I jumped out of bed and ran to my brother's
room</b>
<br><b>and slept in his bed for the rest of the night. In the morning I</b>
<br><b>memtioned the nights events to my mother and her reply was I had
to be</b>
<br><b>making things up because my sister had slept in her bed because
of her</b>
<br><b>seeing a lady in a long dressing gown carrying a candle.</b>
