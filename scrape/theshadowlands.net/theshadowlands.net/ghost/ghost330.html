so I sleep over her house a lot. I was sleeping over her house one day when she
told me this story.....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>First off, I
just want to tell you that this &quot;encounter&quot; happened a couple of days
after my uncle's death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>One day she was
shopping at a store.[don't know which one, sorry]She came out of the store and
went to her car. To her surprise, there was an elderly lady standing by the
car. My grams approached this woman. The woman asked if she can have a ride to
the church. My grams would have normally said no but to her surprise she said
yes. So the lady got into the car along with my grams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>They were riding
in the car and the lady kept on saying &quot;you have to have trust in
god&quot;over and over again. Then all of a sudden the lady said she will get
off. So my grams said&quot;you sure&quot;because the church was still a ways
down the road. The lady smiled and said&quot;of course&quot;. So my grams
pulled over. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The lady got out
of the car. My grams said bye. My grams went to put the car in drive and when
she looked up the lady was gone. There was no where she could have possibly gone.
My grams got out to see if the lady was hurt and on the ground. She was no
where.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my parents
bought this home when I was 6 months old.I am know 31.But the things that went
on in that house when I was growing up are still fresh in my mind.My older
sister and brother were always telling my parents that things were happening to
them, like they would see shadows move in the house. My father said that they
were craze<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and it was just there
imagination.But he was wrong.I can remember that my father let a man stay at
our home till he got on his feet. The man stayed one night.He slept down
staires in the basment.The next morning he came up staires and wascareing his
belongings with him my father asked him what was the matter and he told my mom
and dad that he did not sleep all night that something laiyed down in the bed
with him he had seen the bed go right down were it had layed.he never stayed
with use again.There were times when the water would come on down staires in
the bathroom.Doors would open and close.As I got older it would mess with me.I
was sitting down staires watching the t.v. and a white mist came through the
sliding glass door at me I would not go back down staires for about a year.But
when I would it was like something was behind me on the staires.There were
times in the middle of the night that my bed would shake. I would tell my mom
about it but my dad did not believe use.Till it scared him half to death one
night.We had chimes that hung in the opening going in to the living room
upstaires and we had two pareketts that hung in the corner of the dinning
room.My father was sitting at the kitchen table drinking his coffee when the
bird started going nuts it was about 3 in the morning,Then something growled at
him from under the cage. That is when he started to believe us.And my dad is
really hard to scare.At times you could hear the wood stove open and it sounded
like someone putting wood in it.When you went and looked there was fresh wood
in the stove.I got to were I was scared to go to bed at nights.But things
happend in the day time to.I would hear someone calling my name when there was
no one home but me.See shadows walking down the hall and would go down
staires.Something tried to smother my mom in the night,she could not move to wake
my dad in the bed .But one night we were all playing around with a ouija board
and it told use that 3 ghost lived in the house, william, jake and nathen. two
were brothers and the other was a cousine. They said they were buried under the
house. They told use there last names were moore.My mom looked it up and it is
true an old farm house used to be were there house is today.The little kids
that moved in next door used to walk through the back yard all the time to go
down the street. Then they started going all the way around the house I asked
them why they did not go through the back yard anymore and they said that they
had seen something standing in the window with red eyes waving at them. The old
farm house that used to be there burnied down and my dad had our house built on
the foundation.Still today that house will scare you to death my parents still
own the home my brother and his family live in it know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have read
almost everything on your ghost site. LOL and that's a lot of things. I would
just like to add a few personal encounters other than the one I had at LA Tech.
The first encounter I had with a ghost took place in my old house in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> back in the early 90's. I lived on an
Airforce Base with my family. I was probably between 6-8 years old at the time.
The time period was a little fuzzy but I remember the incident like it happened
two seconds ago. Let me explain what our house was like. To me... the house was
huge. Most things are huge to a child, but later when I went back to see it one
summer it got smaller. Anyways, it was a two story house. On the first floor
one would enter through the front door and see the staircase that lead to the
second. To the right would start a wrap around of rooms (Dining room on right,
Kitchen was straight ahead through the wall, and living room was towards the
back left corner). On the left of the staircase was a slanted hall that ran to
the open living room and kitchen. There was one more room down stairs and
finally a garage. Let me take you up the stairs now. The stairs made an
&quot;L&quot; shape. It was completely open so you could see the front door and
dining room. There was also a little square in the stairs before it turned.
When upstairs the bathroom would be to the immediate left. There were two rooms
to the left past the bathroom and my parents bedroom was to<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>right. One night while my family was down
stairs watching the Simpsons, I was told to go take a bath upstairs. While I
was in the middle of my bath, the light suddenly turned off. Thinking it was
one of my siblings I yelled to turn it back on. By the way the light switch was
located on the outside of the bathroom (Brilliant contractor... lol). As I sat
there shouting at the person outside my door, I noticed that my family was
laughing at the TV. I heard everyone's laugh too. I little confused I started
to get up and out of the tub to turn it back on. I got up and walked to the
door. Right as I put my hand on the door... the light turned back on. I opened
the door to find nothing. That was the end of my experience in that house. My
mother on the other hand had a little different experience.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was asleep one night, when she was awaken
by something. Hovering right above her was a large black shadow. She was unable
to move or scream. She tried to nudge my father but was unable to do it. The
shadow eventaully hovered away from the bed and disappeared. Another account of
mine took place in my grandmother's house in Texas. My grandfather was
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer back in late 1998. One day in spring of 2000,
I decided to call and check up on him. He answered the telephone and sounded
horrible. I knew I had to see him then b/c it would be my last chance. I missed
a week of school and went up to see him. When I arrived he seemed to be hanging
on just long enough to see me. My grandfather and I were very close. The very
same day I came to see him... he past away in his bed. I sat there holding his
hand for a good 20 minutes as he layed there lifeless. I wasn't scared or sad.
I don't know why. I soon went out with my uncles to get out of the house while
all the people came to do their jobs. That night I slept on the couch in the
front room. I layed there looking at all the pictures on the wall. All of a
sudden I felt like someone was in the room with me. Still laying there I
noticed that the light that shines from the stove in the kitchen suddenly got
dim and bright again. As if someone had just walked right in front of it. The
kitchen and living room were both open to each other. I quickly turned around
to see who was there. Nothing. I called out to my grandma and she replied from
all the way in the backroom. I asked her if she had just been in the kitchen.
She replied with a no. We then both agreed that my grandfather had come to see
us one last time and say goodbye. I have yet to experience another thrilling
vent in my life with the paranormal. Please feel free to contact me about any
questions. Thanks for hearing me out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Mind you I've <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>always been a
little bit of a skeptic, I thought it sounded like fun, so I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>grabbed 2
friends (Kiley and Doug) and we went out there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Well, it's in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>middle of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>young boys from
Friend, Nebraska assist us in finding it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We got out there, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and Doug pulled
in the little driveway, keeping his lights on, and Kiley and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I headed into
the graveyard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The light illuminated a
lot of it, but it was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>still pretty
creepy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About half way up the driveway
area, we heard this <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>laughter, from
what sounded like a child.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kiley and I
just looked at each <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>other and were
totally freaked out, but we kept on walking figuring it was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>one of the
Friend kids playing a joke on us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
after going through a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>numerous amount
of shrubbery, trees, and weeds we FINALLY found GG.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stood there for
a few moments, not sure what to expect, and decided that was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>enough, cuz it
was starting to feel creepy, like the atmosphere was all <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>twacked
out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we turn around and start back
out for the main driveway, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and started
walking back towards the car.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked
up and stopped dead in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my tracks.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>towards Dougs
Monte Carlo, like the outline of him, illuminated by the car <o:p></o:p></span></p>

as the 'man' would've walked into the car, the car turned <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi, my name is
jamie i live in perry county, ky and i am now 16 years old and im writing to
you about an experience i had when i was about 9 years old around April of
1998. i was staying at my grandpa's house because we had went to visit my
grandma in the hostpital which was like 3 hours away. She had been in the
hostpital for months then because of repeated heart attacks i really dont
remeber the exact number but it was caused my alot of stress that came from two
jobs and still having to take care of her children even though they were
adults. Well anyway my brother, grandpa, uncle, aunt and me went to see her
just days before and had returned, she seemed in good condition because i had
talked to her. Well days later my brother and me was laying in my grandpa and
grandma's bed asleep when i awoke, it was real early in the morning but was
still dark outside. My grandpa had been asleep in the den in the next room. I
was about to go back to sleep when something in the corner of the room caught
my attention. It was a small white figure with somewhat of large red eyes. The
figure just stood there looking down shaking its head and looked like it was
very sad. Scared to death i went back to sleep and my brother and me had went
home the next day and i never mention what i had saw. Well that night my
mom,brother, and me went to my step aunts house to visit, when we were about to
leave my step aunt ran outside to catch us before we left and told us my
grandpa just called and my grandma had died that morning. I have always
believed in ghost and to this day i still think that the white figure that
looked sad was a warning of my grandma's death. Thank you for reading...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>spend halloween

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>first went to
Barclay Mtn Cemetary... we experienced nothing in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>particular.
There were 6 of us and when we go to the site itself there <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>were another
handful of people. My boyfriend and I both agree there's <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>some bad vibes
resonating from that area but I think because of there <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>being so much
human activity it effected anything paranormal that we may <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>have
experienced. We plan to go back just the two of us on a normal day <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>other story. The
6 of us went there not figuring to experience much and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>somewhat let down
by Barclay Mtn. When we got a little ways down the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>road to where
it's more wooded I got physically sick to my stomach, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>queezy. W/in the
next 60 seconds something kind of foglike passed in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>front of the
truck. This happened 3 more times while on this rd. There <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>were numerous
occasions in which we saw something that looked like a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>small dark
figure in the rd but when we'd get close to it, it would be <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>gone. We WILL go
back there, that was an awesome experience. I'm doing <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>some research
for myself to find out the history of that road/ area. We <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>did NOT see
anything hanging from trees as we expected, but we weren't <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>let down by the
experience. I also want to note that your site lists the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>road as being in
Dushore when even though it leads outside of Dushore <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the easier
access to the road is from RT 220 in New Albany. There's some <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>great old farm
houses on that road that add to the eerie feeling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>HI me and my
friend mike were in pine grove cemetary in lynn at about 2 am. (we were seeing
if what we heard in stories was true) well someone had told us that if you sit
on a bench anywhere in the cemetary and just listen and dont more or make a sound
you will be able to hear what is assumed to be whispering and you will be able
to see white shadows ducking in and out between grave stones. well we thought
we would take a trip there one night to see if it was true. we sat at a bench
(not really sure where) and did exactly what we were told to do. about 20 or 25
minutes passed by and we were starting to think that it was all a joke. we
waited about another 5 minutes and we found out that it wasn't. we heard not
only whispering but something that sounded like heaby dripping water. we knew
that it wasnt water though because it just started and it hadn't rrain nor was
it raining. then we also saw exactley what we were told we would see. what
looked like white shadows of people like figures running in between trees and
grave stones. we naturally got scared and started to run. we figured that the
sounds would stop and the shadows would stop because we were told to be quiet
but they didnt. they did stop as soon as we both had just barley stepped out of
the cemetary gates.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we could almost feel
like there was some sort of precense around us untill we got out. i mean the
second our feet hit the outsides of the gates everything just stopped, just
like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a scary child, scared of everything but as far as ghost well I did not know to
much about it to be scared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I was
about 8 yrs old my mother had sent us to mexico to stay with a auntie cuase she
was going though tough enconomical problems.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My grandmother, and brother shared a my cousins room, I have to explain
the way we slept it was my grandmother and brother at the headboard and me
since I was the oldest at the foot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>One
night when after everyone was out for the night me still not asleep just laying
there I looked to the right side of me and saw a figure standing there it was a
fog like figure but with features I could tell what it was wearing he was in a
suit black suite with a hat I just steared at him then put the covers over my
head and started to kick my grandmother thinking my grandmother had wokened I
again looked and he was still there just looking at me then I again start
kicking my grandmother when grandma woke I started to point and when I looked
back it was gonne that quick.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>when I
told my family they said I was having a bad dream I was not conviced but I was
only 8 and left it at that even though my family and I would go to Mexico every
other ear till one year when I was like 17 yrs old acctually in the bus station
waiting to depart the family had accompanied us and we where sitting there
talking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I remined my auntie of that and
told her till this day I remember it clearly like it just happen and I know it
was not a dream.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She then proceded to
tell me about her daughter my cousin who that room belongs to she told me
&quot;remember when that happen to u and about 2 wks later we left the house
for like a wk I said &quot;yes&quot; she then told me cause the night before we
left all the girl cousins were sleeping over and we slept at the width of the
bed so we all fit and there was a piano at the end so we would not fall well my
cusin again whos room belongs to saw a woman dressed in white walking around
the bed circling us and it was impossible for a child to do that just how small
the room was and the way the bed was positioned so she got us out of there and
we did not go back till she had a priest bless the how put crusafix in every
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>did not tell us so we would not be
scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would introduce myself to you as a true believer in the supernatural i feel
obliged to share a coupl eof my experiences with you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Last Wednesday i
was mopping a floor at the office where i work, this is normal as i do the
cleaning for the office as well as the accounts! Everyone had gone home for the
night, and the place was empty. Except however for the b*gger that slapped a
hand on my shoulder! I shot around with my heart in my mouth adn was convince
someone from the office would be standing there. There was nobody! The front
door, which is the only access to the place is a wooden door with reinforced
steel and cannot be opened and shut quietly! So it leads me to believe that
there was a prescence with me that day. Then i cam into work today and the lock
on my very heavy toilet door is also missing. Now there is only 5 people that
work here and neither one of them took the lock. Strange! also the same day
that i had the experience with the mopping i took my newphew to a drive through
McDonalds whereby i turned off the stereo to speak to the lady in the service
box. When i finished speaking to her my stereo started back up and the button
wash pushed in. I have to tell you that my newphew was extremely scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you can feel people sitting there with you or you will see <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was going to sleep on the couch because my brother-in-law comes come at about

this tall guy sitting there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought
for a second my brother in-law was home, but then I thought, right, why would
he be sitting there in the dark at the computer?<span

because I couldn't move at all, i was so scared, I thought a man was in my

glowing and orange.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't want to

light switch in the hallway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It felt
like I was standing there for a good minute or two because I didn't know what
to do, the man turned towards me really slowly and I found the light and turned
it on so fast...and no one was there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
had that pins and needles feeling in my whole body.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I went in the bathroom and went back to bed
and my sister was awake by then and she said &quot;are you okay, I could hear
you breathing loud&quot; and I just said I must have been half asleep, because
I thought that jesse was home and I thought I saw him&quot;.<span

to freak out, so she went back to sleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I stayed awake until my brother-in-law got home and then I fell back to
sleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Needless to say, I was sleeping
on the floor in their room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm such a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>about ghosts,
until that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>So, here is my

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>This summer I
was shooting some photos<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>along abandoned
narrow-gauge railroad. I've found an ex-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>station which is
about 102 years old and decided to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>photograph
fragments of railroad which remain there. The <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>rain was
approaching, so I didn't pay too much attention <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>about sudden
gust of wind wich came just about when I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stepped between
old rails and took the picture of the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>railroad looking
toward west.Later, when I got home, I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>downloaded
photos from camera, and on one picture which I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>took looking
toward west, there was a strange shape in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>bushes.First I
thought that this is some kind of error in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the picture,
caused by the leaves, and no matter how I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>edited the
picture shape remained there.Couple of days <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>later I've found
a picture of DieselMotorUnit train (it was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>called Silver
Arrow, it was painted silver with blue <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stripes on front
and rear end) which operated on that line <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>from 1960 until
closure of the line 1979.It was then when I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>saw similarities
between front side of train and shape in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the leaves, so I
pasted the front side of train in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>picture, and it
matched exactly with the shape in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>bushes.I was
suprised and in disbelief because of this, so <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I took some more
photographs of the same station looking in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the same
direction,but none of the pictures had the shape <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of my experiences was about a year ago and It was about 7:00 in the morning,
when I woke up to find a little boy standing in my doorway staring at me. We
stayed there for several seconds staring back and forth at each other. He
looked just as solid as me and you. I rubbed my eyes for a second only to find
that the little boy was gone when I opened them. Thinking it was only my
imagination I carried on out with the rest of my day. The next morning about
the same time I saw the same little boy in my room but this time he was
standing at the foot of my bed, I yelled &quot;hey &quot; but he just
disappeared in to thin air. that was the last I saw of him in sight guess you
would say but I did see him in my dreams the next night.He was chasing all my
friends<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>around with scissors trying to
cut their heads off. Then that was until I told him that he was not welcomed in
my house again ever and is not allowed to try to hurt me, my family or my
friends again. I was relieved to never see him again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>thought hat was
the end but I was proven wrong..they weren't done with me yet. It was later on
in last year when I was minding my own business in my room painting my nails
leaning against my bed(I have a bunk bed so when friends come over)when I felt
it shakes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I paid no attention to and kept
on doing my own thing when it did it again. I looked up to see what it was and
I saw a little girl with big blue eyes and short blond hair staring down at me.
I looked away froze as a bored and yelled for my sister to come in . I asked
her if any one was on my bed and she said &quot;no Jordan no ones on your
bed&quot;and stated walking out.when the bed shook again I looked back up and
saw her again so I said&quot; yes there is there's someone on my bed!&quot; so
my sister came back in and looked . She looked back down at me and said &quot;
Jordan there is no one on your bed&quot;so I said &quot; well then is there a
cat on my bed ?&quot; and she said &quot;no Jordan there is no cat there is no
person on your bed&quot; then she left. I sat there for a few minutes frozen as
a bored not doing anything when my bed started<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>shaking rapidly. I didn't even look I ran out into the hall and stopped
in between my dad and my door were you can see the edge of my bed where the
little girl was sitting then I felt this overwhelming sense of sadness and me
just wanted to cry so bad but I couldn't so I fell to my knees and just stayed
there till I finally cry ed. My dad heard all the noise and came to see what
was up.He saw me there crying silently now so he picked me up to see what was
wrong.And all I could say was &quot; the little girl is sad the little girl is
in my room the little...&quot; and was exhausted. He made me go back into my
room and show him but once I stepped foot in my room I could feel and hear tons
and tons of spirits or the paranormal. Some were mad some were sad same were
laughing some were talking and then there were two speaking gibberish just
nonsense things. I started freaking out and tried to get out of my room but my
dad was in the way of the door and I couldn't get through so I started hitting
him to make him get out of my way but I fell and landed on the floor. so I just
stayed there crying when my dad knew that I wasn't joking now so he picked me
up but before he could get me out of my room everything stopped, all the voices
and all the emotions that I was felling just stopped. I was fine for the rest
of the night but we didn't speak of what just happened. I didn't sleep in my
room for a week either<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have had many
other recurrences too with the little girl. I have even had hour long
conversations with her too. So far I have learned that her name is Jessy (
short for Jessica)and that her favorite color is purple she used to have a pet
dog, she knows that she is dead but she doesn't know how or when she died and
she doesn't know why she shows up in my room all she says when I ask her that
question is simply answered with that &quot; they send me hear&quot; and when I
ask her who is they she says&quot; they just they&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Jessy has never
tried to hurt and I fee that she is just a lost spirit looking for an friend
and has chosen me. she's even said so herself that she isn't going to leave me
for a long time and so far she's kept her word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>This story was
told to me by a friend who we shall for the sake of anonymity call Sue. Before
Sue was born, her parents rented an old townhouse in a suburb of Sydney called
Glebe. The area itself is one of the longest settled areas of Sydney and was
the home to mainly blue collar workers and their families. Sues parents had
Sues older brother with them who was around 1 at the time (still a baby). The
townhouse itself was a two story with the living areas on the lower level and
the bedrooms on the second level. The stairwell to access the upper level was
narrow and very poorly lit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The story starts
just after they move into the house and decide to go out and visit friends one
night. Upon their return, they can smell gas very strongly and on entering the
kitchen realise that the gas has been turned on, on the stove. They asked the
obvious question but each stated that they had not had the oven on all day. As
most parents of a small child do, they had an intercom and could content
themselves with hearing their baby boy gurgle and squeal. On going to bed one
night, Sues mother woke to hear a child speaking through the intercom. With
todays technology you could pass this off as the monitor being overly
sensitive and perhaps picking up children playing next door or the like. But in
the 60s the technology was in its infancy and so she listened for some time.
What she heard scared the daylights out of her. The only child that it could
have been was their infant son and he was not even saying the most basic of
words at that point. What she heard was a one sided, intelligent conversation
between a child and a silent second. The child, however did have a name for the
other person and called him Mr Stinky. Sues mother reached breaking point and
woke up Sues father who heard the exact same thing. They both sprang out of
bed upon hearing the little on say, I dont like that. Stop it, it hurts
followed by a scream. On entering the room, a pungent smell of body odour hit
the two, they checked on the little one who was sound asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>They again went
out for the night, preferring to spend time away from the house than inside it.
When they returned this time, the gas was turned on again. They turned off the
gas prior to going upstairs to bed. They both put the baby into his cot and
went into their bedroom. There, stuck in the middle of the mattress was a
carving knife. This cemented their decision to leave the house but not without
attempting to find out the source of the trouble. They approached the Land
Titles Office but without being the owners of the property they were unable to
find out any historical details of the property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In order to move
and to secure another rental property, Sues father had to take a second job to
increase the family income. The only job available for his skill set was at
night. This didnt please Sues mother at all but the lure of moving out of the
house seemed to quell her fears some. She sat at home with the intention of
waiting until her husband came home so that she could enjoy some sleep with the
knowledge that he was home. One night as she sat reading in bed, she heard the
front door open and close and footsteps coming up the stairs to the landing.
She called out her husbands name, to no response. The footsteps reached the
landing but they were definitely not her husbands and she said their was a
normal step followed by a drag as if the person had a bad leg. The footsteps
stopped outside the bedroom door as the handle of the door began to go down.
Sues mother became hysterical and she started reciting the Lords Prayer. The
handle went back up and the footsteps went back the way they came and receded
down the stairs until the front door was slammed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Sues mother
waited for the husband to come home and when he did she told him that she would
not be spending another night in the house and that they had to leave now. He
agreed with her but asked that they wait until the morning, she relented and
told her husband that she needed to use the toilet. He stated that he needed to
do the same but told her to go first, she said that she is fine and that he
could go. This went back and forth with the husband finally asking his wife why
she was so reluctant to go to the toilet. She explained that she passed the top
of thew stairs on the way to the toilet, she felt someone trying to push her
down. The husband told her that this is the reason he hated going to the
toilet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The next morning
they moved out still not knowing the history of the house or its inhabitants. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As an addition
to this story, the house was leased to an elderly lady a couple of weeks after
their departure who passed away in short order. As it turns out, her son worked
in the same factory as Sues dad, who asked him how his mother had passed. The
son advised that she had fallen down the stairs. I apologise for the length.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

send you a quick note on one of my experiences in a place mentioned on your
website.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I live in northwestern
Pennsylvania and very close to this place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We recently visited Tamarack Swamp which is also mentioned in another
place as Jaquins Pond.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The road is now
closed off to the public but we accessed it by foot.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When attempting to stop at the end of the
road our antilock brakes locked and would barely let us stop.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we walked through the road that goes right
though the swamp we heard no noises at all, much like you would think out in
the country such as birds and other animals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Well as the legend has it you must stand on Georges bridge and<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>call his name three times.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Reluctantly I did just that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a calm, cool day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We stood there very quietly when all of a
sudden a strong cold breeze came through and left as quickly as it came.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Needless to say we walked very quickly back
to our vehicle which oddly enough the abs light was off on the dashboard and we
left.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not sure if this was and

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>About nine years
ago, I was staying with my cousin at her apartment in an old building in the
small downtown area of </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style='font-family:

 color:white'>, </span><st1:State><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Kentucky</span></st1:State></st1:place><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>. We were sitting in her kitchen playing
cards and I happened to look over towards the front door of the apartment. It
was dark by the door, but I could make out the shadow figure of a man wearing
what looked to be a top hat. I got out of my seat without saying anything to
anyone and walked towards it. I expected as I got closer for it to be just a
shadow of the jackets hanging on the wall next to the door, but it wasn't. I
held my arm out straight to &quot;touch&quot; whatever it was, and I sware to
you, it felt like I was actually touching something that wasn't there. This
figure never moved and it never changed shape. Of course I ran to tell my
cousin and her friends what had happened and they thought it was the funniest
thing in the world. To this day whenever anyone starts telling ghost stories, I
tell them that I have touched a ghost.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My name is
Adrian , I live in San Benito,Tx. Im 24 years old and for 23 years I lived in
my families two story house,which by the way was built in 1929.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now im living in
a different house with my wife. But for 23 years I saw many interested yet
frightening events going on in my home. Next door to my house was a flower shop
that my mother owned. And next door to the flower shop was a 88year olf funeral
home. In my house there were 5 bedrooms. 3 upstairs and 2 downstairs. I had
mine upstairs and mom and dad had theirs downstairs. The rest of my bros and
siss were gone already on to their lives. Well anyways what Im trying to say
is sometimes wes be sitting there in the living room downstairs watching
television. Wed almost every night see white figures going up and down the
stairs. This was freaky. We got used to it after a couple of years. They never
did anything to us. All they ever did was appear. But this one time. My dad had
been spending nights in the flower shop due to the fact that people kept
throwing rocks at the windows there and breaking them. So<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>he would stay there guarding the shop. One
night he felt a tug at one of his toes while he was laying on the floor. He
awoke and say a white midst at the end of his feet. Frightened he kicked his
feet as too shake the midst off. And the midst vanished. A couple of weeks
later he layed there asleep he felt as if some one was pushing on his chest
very hard. He awoke. The midst was all over him like a blanket he claimed.
Frightened by it he got up and the midst disappeared. He explained it as fog.
The neighbor claims to have seem a man in all black with a black hat and all
passing through the alley inbetween the funeral home and the flowershop. She
claims to see him very late at night and it seems as he is floating.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She says she senses something very rare when
she sees him because no one would dress like that around here that late at
night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Upstairs in my
room. Oh let me just tell you. Me and two of my friends come back from a
fishing trip at </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="1"><span style='font-family:
 Arial;color:white'>1:00 am</span></st1:time><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:white'> in 1995. We get up stairs close and lock the two doors to the
other rooms before getting to my room. Turn off the light. Go into my room.
Turn on a candle. Sit in a circle. Open up a ghost story book. As I begin
reading the first paragraph, The lights started flickering rapidly. (Remember
the lights were all off). We heard two big bangs. And one of my friends started
to cry of sacredness. The candle Blows off .We sit there quietly frightenened.
We ask each other let go down stairs. We couldnt even bare to open the door to
my room to reach the stairs. The two doors we had locked . were wide opened.
There were hangers scattered all through the hall and the rooms were very
cold.(in the summer). Any ways we ran downstairs. My dad was in his room with
mom. Now its 2004. Almost 10 years later. We still cant explain that night. I
came to the conclusion that my whole block is haunted due to the fact for this
following case of events that im about to uncover to your website. 1999 me and
my new neighbor of two houses down. Which is the last house on the block.
Totaling to my house, the neighbors house, and the other neighbors house,
totaling to 3 houses total. Obne night while my friends parents were out of
town he asked me to spend the night at his house. We were up stairs doing
crossword puzzles. When both of us heard steps coming up the stairs. We both
told each other go check who it is. Both of us dared each other in sacredness
to open the door and check who it was. None of us did. The steps got closer.
You could hear the wood crackle. To our scary surprise. We both saw a shadow as
if some one was standing in front of the door. Oh my god,then<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we stayed quit as the shadow just stayed
there under the door. Then two knocks. We both yelled Oh shit! Both of our eyes
watered and goose bumps popped out. Then the shadow walked away. For about 5
minutes we sat there scared,Stomach aching. Nothing was there. There are many
other occurrences. But I dont even know if you would read this in the first
place. But I have a relief now that I have told some one that might be able to
explain what all of this means or is there for. Thank you for your time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>my parents bought this home when I was 6
months old.I am know 31.But the things that went on in that house when I was
growing up are still fresh in my mind.My older sister and brother were always
telling my parents that things were happening to them, like they would see
shadows move in the house. My father said that they were craze<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and it was just there imagination.But he was
wrong.I can remember that my father let a man stay at our home till he got on
his feet. The man stayed one night.He slept down staires in the basment.The
next morning he came up staires and wascareing his belongings with him my
father asked him what was the matter and he told my mom and dad that he did not
sleep all night that something laiyed down in the bed with him he had seen the
bed go right down were it had layed.he never stayed with use again.There were
times when the water would come on down staires in the bathroom.Doors would
open and close.As I got older it would mess with me.I was sitting down staires
watching the t.v. and a white mist came through the sliding glass door at me I
would not go back down staires for about a year.But when I would it was like
something was behind me on the staires.There were times in the middle of the
night that my bed would shake. I would tell my mom about it but my dad did not
believe use.Till it scared him half to death one night.We had chimes that hung
in the opening going in to the living room upstaires and we had two pareketts
that hung in the corner of the dinning room.My father was sitting at the
kitchen table drinking his coffee when the bird started going nuts it was about
3 in the morning,Then something growled at him from under the cage. That is
when he started to believe us.And my dad is really hard to scare.At times you
could hear the wood stove open and it sounded like someone putting wood in
it.When you went and looked there was fresh wood in the stove.I got to were I
was scared to go to bed at nights.But things happend in the day time to.I would
hear someone calling my name when there was no one home but me.See shadows
walking down the hall and would go down staires.Something tried to smother my
mom in the night,she could not move to wake my dad in the bed .But one night we
were all playing around with a ouija board and it told use that 3 ghost lived
in the house, william, jake and nathen. two were brothers and the other was a
cousine. They said they were buried under the house. They told use there last
names were moore.My mom looked it up and it is true an old farm house used to
be were there house is today.The little kids that moved in next door used to
walk through the back yard all the time to go down the street. Then they
started going all the way around the house I asked them why they did not go
through the back yard anymore and they said that they had seen something
standing in the window with red eyes waving at them. The old farm house that
used to be there burnied down and my dad had our house built on the
foundation.Still today that house will scare you to death my parents still own
the home my brother and his family live in it know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>like to first
point out that I live in a home that is inhabited by, who i <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>believe, is the

on the same road that my friend lost his life on his <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>motorcycle
on...ironic isn't it, and we feel that he hangs around the house <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>because one of
his sons names was Andrew.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quite
odd.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are a good <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>number of
stories I could tell about Randy but I will simply not because <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that's not what
this e-mail is about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I tell you that
story to tell you this story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I suffer
from Sleep Paralysis <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>(SP).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have had this for quite some time now and I
wish it would go away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>There is a
buzzing sound that becomes so incredibly loud that it drowns out <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>everything else
around you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It starts out quietly but
soon grows in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>intensity and as
the sound grows you begin to realize that you can not move. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems that at times I can control it by
realizing before the sound <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>becomes to loud
that I need to &quot;shake awake.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I say &quot;shake awake&quot; because <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that is what
happens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When i awake from the situation
my entire body lets <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>out a very large
shake that ends up moving me across the bed or out of the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>position that I
was lieing in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have at least
three instances that I can recall of this but I am quite <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sure that there
have been more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several years ago I
became aware that I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>couldn't move
and became terrified of it only to realize that I was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>surrounded by
&quot;things&quot; around my bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Somehow I managed to shake awake and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it went
away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I promptly covered my head with
the sheets thinking that that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>would make it
stop and fell asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Nextly was only
about a year ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't seem to
notice anything in my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>field of vision
but that feeling of imminent danger and absolute evil was so <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>bad that I
forced myself, quite tired at 11:30 PM, to stay up until nearly <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>5:30 in the
morning just so I would be able to see daylight before I went <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>back to sleep
feeling that the sun would keep me safe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>And lastly
occured perhaps 4 months ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was
the worst yet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt as <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>though I was
asleep and then suddenly the paralysis occred but there was a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>new twist.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This time I could feel what felt like a
person wrapping their <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>arms around
me...around my torso.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It got to the
point where I could <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>actually feel a
body coming up behind me and breath on my neck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At this <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>point i began
screaming and flailing my arms about wilding punching, or so I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>thought I was
doing all of this, at whatever it was that was attacking me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It was horribly
molevilent in feeling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that point it
felt as though I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sat straight up
in bed and screamed at the top of my lungs &quot;GET THE F*CK OUT <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>OF
HERE!&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Please pardon my
language.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a figure hunched
over <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>standing in my
window at the foot of my bed stairing at me as though I had <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>&quot;caught him
in the act.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Out of the same window
there were lights of green, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>blue, red, and
purple flashing about madly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The black
figure jumped out of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the window and
suddenly I shook awake but I was lieing on my side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Those are the
few times that i do remember.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You say
that this happens most <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>often when
people sleep on their backs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just want
to say that it seems an <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>impossibility
for me to sleep on my back and I have always slept on my side <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and these
occurances are no different in my sleep patterns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I live in the
middle of kansas wich most people would say the boonies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just moved in my new house a year or two
ago and the person we had lived ther before us and she died. Well we have had
alot of &quot;experiences&quot; with the<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>supernatural. One day i was getting ready for school it was pretty early
i had an offal sence some one was right behind me watching me. It was so bad i
ran to the end of the house I was so scared and all of the sudden i herd a
CRASH! I want back and come to find out my apple juice had spilt all over the
floor but the weird think it wasnt that thick of glass but yet it didnt break? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another
Exirience i had in that house was I was outside talking to one of my good
friends and all the sudden she started screaming, well come to find out she saw
some one in the mirror<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>walking across my
living room and the thing she saw she described it as a black shadow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The scary part was i was the only one home. O
yeah how she saw the shadow is theres a glass door<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and then theres the storm door and i had'nt
shut the storm door so you vould see the mirror from out side when your
standing on the side walk. Infront of the door.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>HISTORY O- You see i dont know if this has
anything to do with our &quot; expirences&quot; but in the early 40's there was
horrible flood . It was so bad that people had to cut the tops of the roofs
off. And in the late 1800 there was a small pocks epidemic that swept through
the small town.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I was reading
some of the stories here and I have to admit that a some of them <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>seem like they
might have merit but some sound a little too far fetched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyway, I will
share two situations that happened to me that gave me pause and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>made me consider
the possibilty of ghosts existing. I don't really want to use <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my name because
I don't want anyone thinking I am some kind of kook.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>1. I was
watching movies at a friend's sister's house (she works late nights <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and my friend
,her brother, watches the kids)when out of nowhere we heard <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>heavy footsteps
coming from upstairs, it sounded like heavy boots on a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>hardwood floor.
I said to Bryon, who's sister owned the house, &quot;Hey man, those <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>kids are up
messing around up there&quot;. He says matter-of-factly &quot;Naw man <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>they're
alseep&quot;. My other friend who was also there heard the footsteps too <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and said
&quot;It sounds like they're stompin' on the floor&quot;. Again Bryon <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>says &quot;Naw,
I'm tellin' you they're alseep, I hear that all night long, every <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>night my sister
is gone&quot;. I say &quot; I wanna go up there and see for myself&quot;. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Bryon says
&quot;go ahead but they're asleep&quot;. I put on a brave face and went <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>upstairs, sure
enough both the kids are sound asleep snoring in their beds. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>come back down a
little weirded out and ask for an explanation. Bryon then <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>proceeds to tell
us that his brother-in-law commited suicide in front of the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>house shortly
after his youngest daughter was born. Aparently he had some drug <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and mental
problems but I don't know exactly why he did it. Bryon even tells <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>us he actually
has the hose in the storage room his brother-in-law used to run <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the exhaust into
his car and he shows it to us. Myself and my other friend <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>were both a
little freaked that they would keep something like that but <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>nonetheless it
was there. So Bryon relates some more of this weirdness to us, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the whole time
still hearing whatever was walking across the floor upstairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>He seemed to
think it was his brother-in-law checking on the kids, but said it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was strange
because he was kind of an abusive guy in life due to his problems. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>He also said the
oldest of the kids had said in passing one day that her daddy <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>came out of her
closet and said he was going to kill her, but it could have <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>been a bad dream
due to the trauma of losing her father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>2. Same house,
later that year, Bryon called me and asked me if I could watch <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the kids
overnight because both he and his sister had to work late shifts. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>agreed before
thinking about the previous experience in the house and this <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>time I would be
alone until 5 in the morning. I was getting paid 20 bucks to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>do it and I said
to myself I can handle this what could happen? When I got <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there it was
around </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="22"><span style='font-family:Arial;
 color:white'>10:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style='font-family:Arial;
color:white'> and the kids were already in bed for the night <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and all I had to
do was make sure nothing happened like a fire or something. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>really didn't
give what had happened previously much thought and I just <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>watched TV in
Bryons room in the front of the house. I had a perfect view of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the stairs in
case one of the kids got up in the middle of the night and was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>confident I had
everything under control. As I was sitting there I decided to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>call my
girlfriend and while I was talking to her I saw kitchen door ot of my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>peripheral
vision swing closed, hard, like it was pulled shut as someone <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>walked through
it and pulled it closed behind them. I immediately thought one <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>of the kids just
got up and ran into the kitchen. I tell my girlfriend I gotta <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>go and get up to
investigate. When I reopened the kitchen door which is kitty-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>cornered to the
stairs door I realized how tough it is to move because it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>kinda sticks on
the carpet. I go into the kitchen and no kids ( the thought of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>ghost at this
point never enters my mind because I know I saw the door shut <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and that it
sticks so much someone had to have pulled it so, and so panicking <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I run outside
through the door in the kitchen that leads outside thinking that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>one of the kids
knows I'm here and is messing with the babysitter and is <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>outside playing
games. There is noone outside and it occurs to me that a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>little girl
isn't going to run outside at night in her pajamas just to mess <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>with me so I go
back in and the thought hits me like a brick &quot;HAUNTED!!!&quot;. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>start to freak a
little thinking about everyone of those things Bryon had told <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>me but I have to
go upstairs and look. Shaking the whole time a crept up the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stairs and sure
enough there they are, sound asleep. I go back downstairs and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>call my
girlfriend and say &quot;I know I can't leave these kids but I am so <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>freaked I don't
know what to do&quot;. Nothing else happened that night and I never <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>discussed it

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A couple of weeks
ago, on bonfire night, me and my fiancée decided to watch the fireworks up on
the mountain near our home, as we werent having ours until the day after. We
drove up there and realised that a lot of other people also had the same idea.
We couldnt find a decent parking place, so we decided to drive through the
forestry to the other side of the mountain and watch the fireworks from there.
When we drove through it was quite creepy as it was pitch black, there wasnt
any lighting around or any people. It took us about ten minutes until we got to
the other side, we watched the fireworks and had a really nice night. We
decided to drive back at about 10:45pm, there were still no other people or
cars around. We were about halfway through the forest and were talking about
the trees around us when suddenly on my side of the road there was this white
thing by one of the trees, which was kind of misty, it literally jumped like a
sudden flash and then disappeared. I lost my breath with a sudden gasp of shock
and turned to my fiancée, he looked just as shocked as I did and we both said
did you see that? We both went over what we saw, we were really freaked out
and I had goose bumps all over. I had this really scared feeling inside me and
I felt like I just really needed to get out of there. We got out of there and I
felt this huge sense of relief over me, I dont want to ever go there again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My house is
about thirty years old. It's very small less than 1100 square feet and with
three growing boys it is cramped. I don't know how many people lived in it or
what the history of it is and I'm convinced it is haunted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First it was weird, not scary weird but more
of the &quot;what I just looked there for it?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;How did that get there?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;It was here just here a minute
ago.&quot; comments when items, were moved, lost only to turn up in funny
places or the exact spot it was like when we couldn't find my wallet for days
only to show up in the exact stack of papers I left it on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My husband works
full time and goes to school one night a week, not coming back till about ten
or eleven in the evening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On one such
night I was in the basement watching tv with the cordless phone beside me and
heard the front door open.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I should add
that raising a two year old I placed chimes on the back of the front so I would
hear it open anywhere in the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>This night I
didn't hear the chimes, but the loud click of the door handle being pressed and
solid footsteps of men's shoes moving in the kitchen above me and then
continued upstairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not wanting to shout
up to him, in case I woke up the boys, I waited and waited and waited thinking
Dale just went to change out of his suit into more comfortable clothes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally I called him his cell phone and asked
if he was coming down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Dale wasn't
home, he was just pulling out of the school parking lot.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It has happened
a few more times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hearing footsteps in
the kitchen then going upstairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also
one night I was showering, this is a one bathroom house, and I felt uneasy, not
scared just that something wasn't right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I stepped out of the shower and the mirror was steamed over with a
child's hand print on it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wish I could
say it was my one of my kids but they were sleeping and if they came into the bathroom
I'd hear it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Just thought I'd
send in another story. This has happened a couple times over the last couple
weeks. Really freaking and not sure what to make of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>About 4 or 5
evenings ago I was sitting here at the computer and suddenly heard someone or
something whisper my name into my left ear. Now, keep in mind, both of my kids
were in bed sleeping as was my husband and there were NO windows or doors
opened, as this being November and pretty cold at night here in Maine. That
same thing also happened about 5 or 6 days prior to that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Still not really
sure who or what it was but it seems someone was trying to get my attention. I
am kinda surprised that I could hear it since I can't hear out of my left ear
very well due to fluid back up in my left ear. It could be my brother. He
passed away back in 1976 and I am in contact with him since he passed away. He
is my protector and he watches over me and my 2 girls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi my name is
Sarah and i live in south wales,uk.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
would like to share a story with you that has happened quite recently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My aunt and
uncle have many horses so about a year ago they moved to a different part of
wales that had alot more stables and more land for the horses to graze on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a lovely home with a bungalow, around
20 stables, tack room, six large fields, lake and an indoor and outdoor school
complete with cross country jumps.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
land was many years old and had been there for quite a while roughly 100 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyways in the
olden days when a horse died they would bury it in the furthest away field (
the graves are still visible to this day ), but that stopped about 50 years
ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>About 2 months
after my aunt and uncle moved in we went to see them and the new house and
stayed for a long weekend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>One afternoon
whilst having lunch in the dining room Steve and Kate ( my aunt and uncle ).
Where telling me, my parents and my older sister how at night and sometimes
during the day can hear a horse galloping around the outside of the house and
in the yard but everytime they go to the window thinking one of there 11 horses
have escaped nothing is there and all there horses are tucked away in there
stables.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My uncle even told me how one
sunday morning he was going down to the field to bring in 2 of the horses to be
ridden for the day, when just behind the tree he spotted a black horse he looked
at it for a few seconds before it cantered away behind some treees.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My uncle went to see if he could find it
thinking one of the farmers horses had escaped but could not see it anywhere
and he said there was nowhere for the horse to go as it was an open field at
the end of the trees and horse couldnt have galloped away that fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>So after lunch
me and my sister went to the do the cross country jumping ( the course is quite
near to where all the horses are buried).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We must have been down there 15 minutes when i saw a horse in the
distance of one of the fields and yes you have guessed it it was the same one
my uncle had discribed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We both watched
it for about 10 seconds before it disapeared behind a bush.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Later on that
night when having tea in the dining room all my family could hear the sound of
a horse troting and cantering around the yard and behind the house but
everytime we went to the window it was gone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My aunt and uncle have been living there now for over a year and me and
my family have benn back many time to visit and have heard and seen the same
things of that black horse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Steve and
Kate have got used to it and it dosent bother them anymore, and even some of
the people they teach have seen the horse especially the people who work there
have said that taking the horses back to the field they have seen and heard a
horse galloping up and down the fields.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would share this story with you. Thanks for reading x x x x.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I was
around 10, my Mother had passed away and it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was a very sad
time for me, as you can imagine. Since<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>her death, I
have experienced paranormal activity, but<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it wasn't
threatining, or frightining. I remember the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>first one I
experienced was a little while after my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>mother had
passed away. I remember walking down my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>hallway to my
room. I had passed my computer room,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>which is where I
am sitting right now, and saw a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>figure which
looked just like my mom. Since she had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>just died a few
weeks prior, I wasn't used to her not<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>being around, so
at the moment, i had forgotten she<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was dead, and I
said hello to her. Realizing that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>things were not
right, I went to look back to see who<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>or what that
was, but when I got back, the figure was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>gone. Later on
in life, I had heard little noises in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my house, and I
had actually seen bright lights flash<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>in my
basement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My dad once told me that once
he was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>out in our
living room with a few friends. He said<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>they were just
sitting there talking when they heard<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the back door
open and close. Since they were the only<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>ones there it
spooked them. They just assumed it was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>something
else,untill they started to hear our wooden<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>floor creak,
just as if someone was walking pass them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The most recent
experience that I have had was the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I was sleeping, and I had awoken, but<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it wasnt
abruptly, or anything like that, infact I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>woke up
refreshed. I had looked at the clock, and it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was around<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>wasnt in any
hurry to get out of bed. When I lied back<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>down, I turned
on my side. Right then, I felt an arm <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>placed around my
shoulders,and a women whispering in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my ear, very
soothingly.The weridest part was that I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>felt the
vibrations or the air(if ghosts even have<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>air) from the
women talking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My first reaction was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that I had
thought my girlfriend had spent that night<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>at my house, and
that I just didnt recall her being<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there. But when
I got up and turned to see what it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was, no one was
there. Lately when I go into my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

see orbs. I don't believe I'm<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My name is Becky
and I am 11 years old. When I was about six, I saw a ghost coming out of my
sister's closet. It was a little girl about my age and she was wearing a pink
nightgown and was holding a candle. She was walking toward me and so I looked
away and looked back and she was gone. Another time my sister, Rachel, and my
cousin, Sarah, said that one night when they were sleeping in Rachel's room
they were about to fall asleep when all of a sudden they heard a real loud
crash coming from the same closet that the ghost had come out of. They went to
open the door to find NOTHING had fallen down. One last thing that has also
happened was when we were playing around and we made up a game where we had to
stay in that closet to be apart of a club, so we all did it. Rachel and Sarah
said that when they were in there they had seen green dots flashing and
whiteish mist floating around. I saw the same thing! I believe that that is an
open portal for the dead!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>this is a story
that my mum told me few years ago,although it happened when i was just a 1 year
old baby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We moved into
the old cross about a year or so after i was born, and many of my relatives who
visited the house said that there was something not quite right in there, as
you walked through the hallway into the living room there was a small room
which had never been used and when you walked through it became deathly cold,
so cold infact that even on the hottest of summer days that room was
freezing.But that is just the first part, when my mum and dad were going to
bed,they turned the t.v off locked the doors and went upstairs to bed chatting
about the day as they got ready for bed. My mum had been in bed for a few
minutes and was just fallin asleep when she heard a strange noise,she woke up
my dad and they both lay in bed wondering what on earth could be making the
noise, finaly my mum made my dad get out of bed and go and see what it was, so
he followed the noise and he was led to my bedroom where the noise seemed to be
coming from, he peeped round the door i was fast asleep.but my little toy piano
that i had got for my birthday was playing away by it's self.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>yes many people
will say that maybe the piano had a default or something wrong with it,but tell
me this,how can a piano that has no batteries in play a tune with nobody there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>At first when my
mum told me i thought that she was trying to scare me, but i have asked many of
my relatives about that house and they have all said the same.also we recently
found ou that the old cross was built on the old town square where they used to
hang the criminals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>maybe the house
was haunted by the soul of a criminal who had been hung there so many years
before, or maybe it was something else, but i tell you this i will never go
into that house again alone or with somebody.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Although since
then the various owners of the house have had many excorcists but we still hear
now and again that something weird has happened in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>i was about 16
years of age and came from a very religeous family.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>i had accompanied my mother to one of the
households where she taught the bible to the lady of the house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we lived in an old mining town called idaho
springs in the foothills of colorado west of denver.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>this town has a tradition of stories about
local haunted house and the like. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>anyway, we sat
in the front room of this 100 year old house and my mother was attempting to
teach her beliefs about demons, ghosts, poltergeists and the like.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we had been sitting a while and i asked to
use the restroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the lady told me it
was down the hall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>on the way down the
hall i felt an eerie feeling and walked through what felt like a cold
draft.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>it scared me enough that i turned
directly around and went back into the living room without going on to the
restroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>i happened to be
sitting in a chair facing the lady and my mother but with my back to the door
of the living room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>as i sat back down
the lady looked at me with a smile but didn't say anything.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>as the conversation went on it became clear
that the lady didn't agree with the ideas my mother was putting forth about the
cause of poltergeist activities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>my
mother was trying to teach that all paranormal events are caused by
demons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the lady was saying that she
knew for a fact that poltergeists weren't demons but a spirit of a different
sort.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>now while this
conversation was going on i was sitting still a bit wigged out by what i had
felt in the hallway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>i then began to get
the feeling that someone was standing behind me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>this was a very distinct feeling and caused
me to glance behind myself a number of times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>the lady of the house kept looking at me and smiling occasionally.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the feeling of someone behind me actually got
stronger and i had the physical sensation of fingertips running up and down my
back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>i believe even now in retrospect
that something actually did touch me in this way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>it was at this point that the lady told my
mother that there was a poltergeist in this house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>it was relatively harmless although it did
like to hide things like pieces of clothing, etc. which would show up in odd
places later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>then she looked at me and
said, &quot;i can tell that you can sense his presence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>he's been standing behind you for a few minutes
now.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>i immediately
got up and went to stand next to my mother.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>she later told me she had never seen me so ashen.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>shortly after that we left. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>its been quite a
few years since then and i've only had a few experiences i would consider 'out
of the ordinary'.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>but since that time
i've had a fascination of the paranormal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>i still think i would be scared of ghosts (or whatever they are) but am
always looking to find out what it's about.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>thanks for exploring this world for us and allowing me to read about it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The story that
I'm going to tell you happened when I was around 9 or 10(I am now 14)...It's
not very scary or long but it is true..and till this day I still get goosebumps
when I think about what I saw that night.One night around 3:00 am I woke up thirsty...like
I used to do..I've stopped now..and I went to get a drink...I went to the
kitchen and got a drink from the sink.Above the sink there is a window with a
drape over it facing the front of my house...as I was drinking the water out of
curiosity I wanted to see if there was any one up at this hour wondering the
streets so I lifted the drapes and I saw across the street this girl or
woman..I'm not really sure..but she was looking at me or so it seemed I was
really scared like most ppl because this was my first ghost I dropped my water
and started running to my room..I got in my bed and covered my self with my
covers and I just shut my eyes i thought the ghost was coming after me or
something...I didn't sleep that night...in the morning I told my dad and mom
but they said I was probably dreaming...till this day they still don't belive
me..They think I got it from a scary movie(which is racticlly the only kind of
movies I watch..and comedy)from then on I bought a water bottle so I wouldn't
have to go to the kitchen at night...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My father was
stationed at Hutier and Hessen Homburg Kaserne on Lamboy Street during the 70's
and 80's. He used to tell me stories about the haunted barracks that he worked
in. The third and fourth floor of the barracks was haunted by a soldier that
had died there many years ago. The third floor was made into a unit bar where
the soldiers could have a few drinks after work and watch TV and play some
games like pool. They used a room on the fourth floor as a storage room, or
tried to use it I should say. They would put supplies in the room neatly
however the next morning things would be all messed up and moved around. After
several months of this they finally took the supplies out and just locked up
the room and gave up on using it for storage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Staff would also
say that when they were locking up for the night they could hear the toilets
flushing even though there was nobody on the floor. They searched and never
found anybody. I do not remember him ever saying that anybody ever saw a ghost,
just that they heard noises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The kaserne has
now been given back to the germans and they have been using it as a refuge camp
and have refurbished the buildings and now have several civilian businesses in
the buildings so I will never know if the ghost is still there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I also lived in
Steinheim in the early 80's and my apartment had a ghost or maybe you would
just call it a spirit. The old man that I saw (later I found out that he had
died in the apartment of old age, in his sleep) just stood by the door of the
apartment and never moved. He had on the clothes that he feel asleep in when he
died (a neighbor later told me this). However my brother took over the
apartment and never saw or heard anything. I had two girlfriends stay there and
one of them felt him but the other did not. So maybe it was a figment of my
imagination even though I saw him before I knew that a man had died in my
apartment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lot or at least some... of it is true...))<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I cannot see
spirits or gosts, or at least I can't see them very often... I have only seen a
good spirit twice and a bad spirit once. Nut my best Friend Amber can see them
24-7. She can talk to them, tell you their hair color. Everything. One day when
she came over to my house amd my cousin, Kelly was down, we went outside. Amber
wont do Ouiji vours or nothing like that. We were sitting on the deck be my
loft/garage and Kelly wanted to see them the way Amber could, not just their
form. Some spirits we know were over on the other deck by the house, so we went
over there and sat on the swing. None of us are really that scared of spirits,
or at least not anymore. There are spirits who protect us, bith light and dark.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A few feet away
we, or Amber saw a litle boy and Kelly saw his figure, standing over by a
fence. Behind our house we own about 9 acres of woods. The little boy stood
there and watched us. Then a women appeared in the forest. She had a knife,
transparent knife, in her hand. She went over to the little boy and showed her
killling him with the knife.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ghost
cannot die though. A few minutes later the boy reappeared, holding a knife. He
tried to kill the women, who we found out to be his aunt. She took the knife
and it looked to be like she tried to kill him agian. She reached for the boy
and tried to choke him. A spirit we know, went over and saved the boy and
brought him into the barrier of safty we sat in. The little boy wanted Kelly to
give him a hug. When she did, the aunt was enraged. She started throwing real,
solid acorns at us. She said she was going to follow kelly, all the way back to
her home, 2 states away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Kelly asked how
she could make the women not follow her. The women told Kellythat we had to
send her home. I'm a witch and she told me to go get my spell book. I went and
got it. She told me to go to page 43 and cast the spell. I went to the page and
a drew the circle around us. MY, Amber, Kelly, and even the little boy all held
hands. The women in the center of us. We said the spell and she told us to
leave. She said when the wind came, she would be gone. We started to walk away.
When the wind came we turned around and looked... she was gone. We sat on the
steps the little boy with us, he was playing with my hair. I could feel it
moving. I left out one important detail from before. We saw a family, a father
and son, and the mother who killed them both and later killed herself. When the
father and son forgave her becuase we had helped them by asking her to go to
them, God forgave her, i guess. She went up into the clouds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Back to the boy.
The spirit we know asked the spirit family to adopt him, they did. He went up
to the clouds with him. The Aunt was forgiven and became an angel. There was
only one problem... the little boy wanted a locket that was lost under my deck.
We looked for it but couldn't reach it when we found it. Amber had to leave. A
couple days later the boy found the locket and took it to Amber. A note was
inside it but.... he doesn't want anyone but us to know what it said. Amber
still has the locket as a gift from the boy, thanking us for his hlp. And thats
my story... A happily ever after... Sort of, more will happen and I will help
and do my best... But thats it for now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>This is my
teacher's story: When my teacher was in elementary school, every year her class
took a trip to </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:white'>Burneau</span></st1:PlaceName><span style='font-family:Arial;
 color:white'> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>College</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> to see a play of the Nutcracker (I
think). Well, she was a trouble-maker &amp; one year when they went, my teacher
looked at the ceiling &amp; discovered that there was a mural of naked people
on the ceiling. She whispered to her friend about it &amp; it was sent around
the whole class. Eventually, her teacher picked up on this &amp; told her that
if she didn't behave, the ghost of the college would get her. Well, a couple of
months ago from today, my teacher picked up a book about ghosts &amp; haunted
houses in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-family:Arial;
  color:white'>Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> (</span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span

  style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>). I don't want to make this story long
so to short-cut, in the book it said that the ghost at Burneau, was a girl who
killed herself by hanging herself by a rope on a fan or something, because the
guy she was going to marry, was secretly planning another wedding for him &amp;
another woman.Hope you like the story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
