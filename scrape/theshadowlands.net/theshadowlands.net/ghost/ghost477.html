<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Went down to fudge
road
twice, but I live near oxford.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went
down there a few friends and myself, and there are two things that are
on Fudge
rd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coming from gratis there is the
crybaby bridge as I have come to known.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are many different bizarre writings and symbols on the
bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bridge is very old&#8230; but nothing
supernatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further down the road
there is a house, not to old and condemned.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Around the house there is an 8&#8217; fence along with barbed wire to
keep
people from entering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also there is a
camera atop the house that runs to the law enforcement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The house is crazy looking, shivers in all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My buddy whose father works in corrections in
butler county helped do follow-up paper work on events that took place
in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supposedly there were a few
bikers that abducted a pregnant woman, raped her, murdered her and got
to the
baby and killed it as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His father
also talked of how the KKK has meetings that butler county law has had
to aid
in stopping by going out and breaking up gatherings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other than the story behind the house, I
again haven&#8217;t had any supernatural experiences.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, both times I went out there a truck from across the
street has
peeled out of the drive way and followed us all the way back to gratis
at high
speeds down through the curves of fudge road.<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>Hello, I am just writing you to tell you of
my story, i am 37 yrs old, and my family and i have a summer house up
in Hunter
Lake N.Y., well one summer we went hiking far back into these woods
with
waterfalls and a very old cemetary, not even it was 3 headstones a mom
dad and
daughter, from i would say the early 1900's maybe if that, well as we
were
hiking into the woods more i was the last one in line, and i heard a
noise
behind me and when i turned around i saw for a split second an Indian
form of a
man running with no shirt on and a white cloth or sheet in the air and
he
disappeared into the air.This really happened, and up till today i
swear on my
children i know what i saw! i was 12 yrs old when this happened, but i
so
strongly believe in spirits and ghosts and that they do exist! just
wanted to
share my story with you,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">2 Experiences in TN<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>uglyd0g97@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I've had experience
with 2 of
the haunted places listed for TN. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Johnson City -
Oklahoma Road
exit Actually, there is no road in Johnson City called Oklahoma Rd. but
I am
familiar with this story. It's supposed to be traveling on I-26 toward
Asheville, you take exit 27. It's the exit after University Pkwy. You
take the
exit and everything about the story is the same. You park in neutral,
yadda,
yadda, yadda. My friend Dan took me and some other friends to this
location and
was freaking out about how cool it was when I had to burst his bubble.
We got
out of the car and what I am about to mention turned out to be the
truth.The
reason your car starts rolling backwards is because you're still
traveling
uphill. It just doesn't seem like it because the road almost flattens
out after
you just came up a steeper bit of hill but not quite. It gives the
sensation
that you are going downhill again when you're really not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My second
experience was
living in Johnson City - Lucille Clement Dorm (ETSU)I lived in Luci for
3 years
(it's a co-ed dorm now) and the "marble" noises you'd hear were the
sounds of people above you walking around and the building falling
apart. ETSU
doesn't keep up with maintenance like it should Just look at the giant
crack in
the art building. The building is literally about to fall in half.
Anyway, when
you're on the 5th floor, there are no marble noises. I guess that's
because
nobody lives above them.However, the bit about the water is true. My
freshman
year, I had to tell my RA about water coming out from under another
door into
the hall. The guy was a friend of mine and I knew he was gone for the
weekend.
I don't remember the room number but it was on the 2nd floor, the hall
closest
to State of Franklin Rd. You could hear the water was on full blast.
The RA
came and opened the door and turned off the water but some of the stuff
under
his bed including a rug was ruined. Could be something to the story but
I tend
to think it was a just loose faucet. He was the only person I ever
heard
complain about it and it happened on multiple occasions in his room.
Also, with
regards to the Old Library story (Johnson City), I don't believe the
old
library building is used as a library anymore. I didn't even know it
was used
as a library until I just checked the ETSU PDF map
(http://www.etsu.edu/com/documents/MapETSU.pdf). Now days it's known as
Roy S.
Nicks Hall or the Old College of Medicine building and I've heard it
used to be
where cadavers were kept in the basement. I'm supposing that was until
ETSU
started it's program with the local hospital. There's a new library, as
you can
see on the map, that was erected in 1998.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi, i was googling
haunted
locations in Australia and it came up with the shadowland's haunted
locations
guard, i looked further into the sight and discovered that you could
send in
your own story, so i decided too send in mine.. I had been living in
the same
house for about five years and so far nothing strange or paranormal has
happened. But then one day everything started.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was sitting on my bed (which is located directly behind the
door to my
room) and i was completely alone, no one else was in the house, the
house was
locked and all the windows were closed and it wasn't windy that day,
when
suddenly the door to my room which was wide open suddenly slammed shut
of its
own accord. It scared me half to death and too this day i have no
explanation
for it. Also, nearly every night I have heard the sounds of a baby
crying late
at night from the room next to me when my mother is the only one that
stays in
that room. Another incident that happened in my room was that my CD
layer which
was switched off AND unplugged and had been for about a day suddenly
turned on
and started playing music without a CD inside it. These all happened a
few
years ago, nothing strange has happened since although i still do hear
the baby
crying at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our house was built in
around the 1950's. its in a trust home (cheap housing) area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I used to live at
the house
of 1000 stairs in Redlans Ca. I lived there for about 10 years off and
on with
my Godparents. They lived there full time I came on the weekends and
during the
summer. This place is very very active at night my god sister and I
would see
the nuns walking down the stairs they would stop to ring the bells in
the bell
towers (after a while we removed the bell that was connected to the
stairs),there were other spirits as well, and other spirits we believed
to be
denoms. I think the scariest experience we had was one night when we
were sleeping
in our room we woke up and all around us were these little green lights
and at
the end of our bed was a figure with red eyes. There are tunnels that
run under
the property and rooms as well all made out of dirt some of the rooms
doors
have been covered over with dirt and rocks so that you can not get in,
if you
stay down there at night you will see nuns going in and out of these
rooms that
have been covered over. I am not sure what the nuns did in this house
but there
are many restless spirits. I also believe this place draws mentally
unstable
people to it while we lived there we many times had to call the police
because
people would break on to the property knocking at our door telling us
the
spirits told them to come there. There are so many stories I could tell
you but
it is a very unusal place after a while my god sister and I would sleep
in the
game room next to our parents room because we were to scared to stay in
our
room. I would be glad to share more if you would like just let me know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When I lived in Bay
Head, we
had a woman in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would turn
on the stereo during the night, my children would hear a female voice
and they
would come down lto me so see what I wanted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We had 6 bathrooms and five bathrooms upstairs. Only renting.
After the
men came and put up the storm windows for the winter, the next day I
looked out
and saw my Cadillac windshield smashed with a storm window.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, I was across our bedroom getting
hot water for my husband to soak his foot in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everytime I started the water, the door would close.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband finally held the door for me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I worked the 3 to 11 shift in Point Pleasant
Hospital and one day when I was taking a shower, there was a knock on
the
bathroom door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one answered when I
asked who it was so I got out of the shower and went all thru the house
and no
one was there but me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night when I
got up to go to the bathroom, I saw a woman in the hallway,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She was sort of Opague with a long gown on
and a blue robe over it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days
later, I went down to the cellar to do a load of wash.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was an old metal spring on its side and
when I was putting the wash in the washer, the spring started to shake.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I got frightened and ran up the stairs.. I
found someone who knew about these things and she got a woman that
could feel
and see things most people don't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she came in my house, she said her hands felt cold.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She asked me to take her around the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got to a bedroom that my
little girl had tried to stay in and she went over to a corner and felt
very
cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter couldn't stay in the
room because she told me that "I can't stay in there, its not my
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman that came to us asked
the other people to leave the room and we sat on one of the beds.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She said I had a 'covering'. She explained
that my face had a covering over it that didn't look like me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She said the woman was unhappy that I
wouldn't help her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just said to tell
her I couldn't because I was too afraid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few other things happened but I am tired of typing.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We broke the lease and moved out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I just couldn't take it anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
house was across from the ocean in
Bayhead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FYI<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">i know most high
schools
claim to be haunted, but my old alma mater has everything from restless
Indian
spirits, students that died on campus, as well as the spirits of some
priests
that passed away at the campus. It's name is Bishop Alemany High
School. It is
located immediately next to the San Fernando Mission, San Fernando
Mission
Cemetary, and is directly across the street from Eden Memorial Park. (A
cemetery for Jewish believers) To make this easier I will list the
different
stories i have heard and my own limited encounters. 1. Our school was
built on
what used to be an old orange grove. It was also used a burial ground
for
Native American's who built the Mission. Several different faculty
members have
heard the sounds of an old woman crying inside our Alumni Hall, and one
claiming
to have seen her pacing back and forth. I myself went there late with
three
friends one night in an attempt to see if we could prove anything for
ourselves, we heard the same crying noises, and saw a brief glimpse of
a black
silhouette through the all glass walls of the buildings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>2. Other faculty members have claimed to seen
an Indian Chief in full ceremonial garb near the school's Chapel, and
the
hallways behind it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>3. Memebers of the
water polo, swimming team, and marching band, have heard a young boy
crying
from the old archives located underneath the buildings on the west side
of
campus. (The water polo and swimming teams use to use the old showers
that were
built for the priests when the school was an seminary, and the band
used to
store it's equipment in spare rooms down there.) One story of an
eyewitness who
saw the spirit is one of the creepiest our school has. A few of the
girls on
the swim team went down to the showers after practice, and found all of
the
shower heads on and a little boy standing in the middle of the room.
The boy
didn't respond to any attempts at conversation. The girls left to get a
coach
to try and get the boy to talk. When they got back, all of the shower
heads
were off and the boy was nowhere to be found. (This part of the school
is
directly next to the graveyard. Only a chain link fence separates the
two
properties. Our pool is technically rented space from the graveyard.)
4. In the
new school archives, located on the second floor of the building over
the old
archives, there have been reported sightings of a priest in his uniform
reading
or filing books. This same hallway, (nicknamed: the forbidden hallway,
by
students because it has all of the permanent records and school's
computer's
mainframes and is off limits to any student without permission) was
once the
dorm rooms for the young priests in training when this site still
served at the
cemetary. Several men of God passed on at this location. 5. The hallway
behind
the school's chapel has had several sightings. The indian chief, the
little
boy, and shadowy silhouette have all been seen here. The boys bathroom
is a
hotspot for strange happening late at night. I would be there late for
extracurriculars or what have you, and one night when i was there, the
door to
this bathroom closed and opened twice. No one else was there to do
this. Trying
to test the spirit, i said "Is someone here?" and the stall door i
was in flung open. It didnt feel like a bad spirit, but it was
deffanately
wanting to make itself known. there are plenty of other stories at the
school
from all different sources. those are just the ones ive heard the most,
and my
own two little encounters. i hope this haunting hot spot gets a slot on
this
website, cause i dont think the spirits are going anywhere.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have posted here
a couple
of times about ghosts in my parents house, I just think its crazy what
you can
get used to living with, I just thought I would share another
story...When I
was 14yrs old I was having a conversation with my dad in the living
room about
my pencil art work..My dad is a pastor by the way, he was telling me
that I
need to be careful with what I draw, at the time I was into aztec art
work and
had it posted all over my wall. He told me that allot of what the
aztecs did in
ritual was actually satanic such as what they worshiped and sacrifice
you know
ritualistic stuff. Of course as a teen I was disagreeing with him and
as we
argued about it, we were interrupted by the sound of<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>foot steps running to my room and the sound
as if someone threw themselves on to my floor. We looked at each other
in
surprise with a short quiet pause, then my dad said "you seee" I
didn't want to go to check it out neither did my dad, he said" you need
to
pray son", I worked up enough courage to walk through that hallway and
open my door.When I did, a picture of a dragon type character I Made
was on my
floor. I grabbed it and threw it in the trash...that was about 16yrs
back my
dad just had something happen last week my mom was going to bed and
told my dad
not to forget to blow out the candells in the living room as she said
that my
dad told me that he heard a whistle and all four of the candells were
blown out
so instead of staying up he called it a night and went to read his
bible.
things still happen in that house, and some friends of mine suggested I
do some
EVP work I am a little nervous about it cause I do not want to stir
something
up but if I can catch something on that tape it will be awesome
hopefully
someone out there will believe me.....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the full
moon my dog was attacked at 3 Am by an unseen thing! My spouse was
awakened and
I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from a deep sleep as we heard noises
of a dogd paws hitting an jumping , along with yelps. When I arrived at
the
area, she was all four legs stiff and teeth showing growling and
looking down
the stairway...there was nothing there! This went on for 10 mins. She
was
thrown on her side and spun around in circles all the while she kicked,
bit and
glided around the livingroom area? Nothing was visible to us. We let
her out to
releive herself and she refused to reenter the house?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

did something bad to be sent to my room as a punishment.. I was laying
in bed.
Not sleeping mind you just laying there looking up at the Ceiling
counting the
circle things. LOL Yea as you know I was bored out of my skull.
Anyway.. a few
moments later I looked at the head of my bed and I saw two white heads,
round
shaped, with red eyes. No teeth or anything or body for that matter.
They just
kept staring at me. I screamed as loud as I could and my mother came
running
into the room, as soon as she did the image or ghostly figure or
whatever it
was vanished. This house that happened in was known to be haunted. I'm
not sure
by what. I asked my mother years afterwards if she had any odd
experience in
that house after I told her what happened. She said yea. When she was
down in
the basement doing laundry she heard someone call her name. No one was
in the
house at the time. I'm not sure where I or my brother were at the time
but I
know we didn&#8217;t call her. We call her "mommy" not by her first name as
this thing did. She answered it. Now as I recall if something unknown
calls out
your name and you answer it, isn't that a invite? This house is located
in
Vermont on West road in Burlington. I forget the number of the house.My
mother
said I was a gifted child. Gifted meaning able to sense things, as well
sometimes able to predict the future which I've had in the past. Its
not
something that happens to me "all" the time, Just once in a blue moon
I'd get visions in my dreams that come as "warning signs" My brother
was going on spring break during the days of his high school years..
driving his
jeep over to coastal beaches in fla. I recall having a dream of him
doing this
and his jeep caught fire while he was driving down the road. Odd how
this dream
came about. I told my brother not to go. He thought I was crazy of
course he
didn&#8217;t believe in that sorta thing, nor does my husband. LOL Anyway my
brother
called me up one day and said that his jeep caught fire. He had a flat
tire and
parked on the side of the road, he wasn't going to spring break, he was
just
heading over to a friends house when this happened. Come to find out
some punks
started the fire to his jeep.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

story this
happened to my mother&#8217;s uncle<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the
fifties Her aunt and uncle were coming back to san Antonio T.X.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>on highway 87 when their car broke down
.during the night .uncle Steve went walking during the midnight hour to
get
help before he left he told my aunt to lock all the doors she did just
that . about
3 00 am three men in a car stopped to help her. They<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>told her they that they would help her but
she told them that her husband had gone to get help and he might be
coming back
. so the men told her that they will leave and they were going to leave
her
some food in a brown paper bag which they left on the hood of her car.
Hours
after she thought about the food in the bag .but she was too scared to
get out
of the car .soon a highway trooper arrived. She told him that her car
broke and
her husband had gone and never returned<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the trooper asked her if she had seen a few gentlemen<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>in a 57cheavy. she told him about the three
men that stopped and before he left he asked her about the bag on the
hood of
the car . She told him that the men left her some food in case she
would get
hungry. The officer grabbed the bag and peeked in it and out of the bag
her
husband&#8217;s head came out. She has not been the same since then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>&#8216;&#8217; The Ghost On Old
Pleasanton Rd &#8216;&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In 1977 my friend
and I were
driving on Old Pleasanton Rd. During the night. We were headed south
when we
came apon a dark colored woman wearing like a white wedding dress . We
decided
to give pull over to see if she needed assistance<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with
a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>vehicle but we didn&#8217;t see on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I saw her coming up<span style="">&nbsp; </span>through
my rear view mirror I noticed she was not walking she was floating
towards us.
Then because I was scared I decided to take off and as I picked up
speed I
noticed odometer was reading 67 miles per hour and she was banging and
floating
next to our car she soon disappeared out of sight when I got home I
told my
grandma what had happened to us and she was stunned just like I was. A
week
after this incident around the same time period I received a phone call
that my
friend was found murdered with a knife through his heart at the same
location
where we spotted the lady a week ago. My grandma told me that it could
have
been death coming for him. I still tremble at the thought of reliving
all that
had happened that dark night in 1977.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Great Aunt Amy, she
lived in
a small two room shack in the middle of a very remote wooded area in
northern
Michigan,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>next to her brother and his
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember her writing to me in
the mid 60's and telling me they had a road name and sign now)<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My younger sister and I loved
going there
to visit, we would walk in the woods and explore an old cabin and
trailer in
the woods north of them. They lived very primitive: an out house with
magazines
for toilet paper, and slaughtered their own pigs and cows...<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a great green apple tree down the
road and we always stopped to get our pickings before heading home.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One time we heard a weird noise and my mother
told us to hurry up and get in the car, we had to get going.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a bear calling for her cub, and we
were down wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom feared we may be
between the mother bear and her cub. When ever we went to visit we went
to see
The Uncle and his wife first, then Great Aunt Amy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although we would see her peering over the
tiered kitchen curtain when we arrived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Great Aunt Amy was very short and stout and you could just see
the top
of her head, from the eyes up, over the lower curtain and I am sure she
was on
tip toes at that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she was
always<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so surprised to see us and just
happen
to have cookies or rolls just out of the oven!The day of her funeral,
late
70's, my sister Kathy and I got out of the back seat of the car, on
opposite
sides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at Great Aunt Amy's
cabin and then looked over the top of the car at my sister. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>I knew she saw her too!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Great
Aunt Amy's little head, eyes peering up
over the curtain, as she always did when we came to visit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could almost smell those rolls baking; that
she just happen to be making. Recently my sister and I took a random
trip to the
area and went by to see the little old cabin once again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this time it was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A new
home stood just to the east of its
location.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very disappointed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister turned to me and said thats alright
shes still there, can you feel her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My name is Brian
and I have
been wanting to report this for the last two years and I am finally
doing
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took my family on a trip to
Western Maryland back in 2007, looking for a place to stay for a couple
of days
and had no specific destination in mind. We wound up finding a state
park in
Herrington Manor with really nice cabins. We booked cabin # 201 and
settled in
for some winter cabin fun. Little did we know that there seem to be
some strange
things happening around the cabin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
unpacked our clothing and put it into the dresser draws in the
bedrooms. When
we went to retrieve a clean pair of socks or something from the drawers
(keep
in mind, we had not left the house nor had anyone else entered), there
was
other peoples clothing on top of ours in the drawers. Men&#8217;s dress socks
and
women&#8217;s underwear. I would plug my cell phone into the wall outlet and
as soon
as it was charged, I would unplug it and it was dead in seconds (never
happened
before or after). During the evening, something would take a beer can
that was
on the kitchen counter and rock it back and forth so as to make a
tapping
sound. I would go and do the same thing and then IT would do it again
after me.
At this point, I tried to communicate with whatever we believed was
there and
attempted to make a few requests. I ask, &#8220;Ghost, turn the bathroom
light on.&#8221;
The light turned on. I then asked the reverse, &#8220;Ghost, turn the light
off.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so on, over and over. My wife
freaked at this point and would not take a shower. Last thing that
happened the
night before we left was extremely strange. My son was a little scared
so we
had him sleeping on a mattress at the foot of the bed. While we slept,
my son
came up to our bedside covered in sweat telling us that something was
wrong.
When we went to step down off the bed onto the floor, all the heat in
the room
was down at the floor, and extremely hot. From two feet off the floor
and up to
the ceiling was extremely cold. My son was on the mattress on the
floor. This
was a bit unnerving. Lastly, as we hiked around the woods by the cabin,
we
found an old graveyard from the 1700&#8217;s and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one of the stones was of a child that died on its first
birthday. Think
the family names at the site where Wolfe or something. Thanks for
listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am a current
student who
attend class on the third floor of this building twice a week in the
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have experienced the chills
described on your site all over the wesern end of the third floor.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I have also heard doors opening and closing
when i knew for a fact nobody was in the area from which i heard them
(on the
3rd floor).Also while by myself in the mens bathroom on the 3rd floor I
began
to feel the chills and scared feeling when a few seconds later I heard
a deep
roaring sigh from outside the bathroom stall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nobody else was present on the floor except the class in session
on the
other end of the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I returned to
the class room where i felt calm again and i now am fearful of walking
alone in
the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is strange as i am
one who is not easily scared, especially by mythical occurances.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I dont believe in ghosts but there is
definetly something strange about that place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I have had the feeling i was being followed, as well as
heard footsteps
from nobody at all.Earlier today a classmate mentioned to me that she
had read
reports of the "hauntings" on your site so we went there after our
class (in a different building) to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We both agreed that the chilly, fearful emotion occurs even when
we have
nothing to be afraid of, especially in the west wing on 3rd floor, the
central
atrium of the third floor, a strange feeling of clausterphobia in the
main
elevator (which i had never felt in an elevator before) coupled with
the
thought that it will take you somewhere you dont want to go, and
anywhere near
a door leading to the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
classmate said she saw people in one of the locked empty rooms out of
the
corner of her eye but when she looked again it was obviously empty,
however
there was some nonsensical random phrases written on the whiteboard in
the room
with a clear message that said "these words are no to be erased and are
vital".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While i believe it was
either written by staff as a joke, or by a student who is handy with a
lockpick,
we both agreed that the combination of words made abosutely no sense
and did
not seem to be in an attempt to scare anyone. All things aside i would
like to
investigate further but cant find anyone who has access to the locked
off parts
of the building. NEVER enter that basement alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
dont know why i say that but it is now a
very strong conviction in me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I lived in a
farmhouse for 3
years. I really could go on for hours about all the things I witnessed
there
but here are a few. I once woke up in the middle of the night to what
seemed
like every door and window in the house slamming at once; it shook the
whole
house and was very loud. One time I was laying in bed and a large
invisible
thing seeming like a large dog jumped up on the bed and walked up
between me
and my husband and then (like a dog) plopped down half laying on me and
then
just slowly the weight went away. I would be standing outside the
kitchen
window of the house, or outside hanging clothes on the line, and hear,
outside,
what sounds like three of four children laughing and playing like they
were
jumping on the bed and squealing and laughing and then I would hear
this thump
thump thump thump thump, like footsteps, then mumbling in a low males
voice rum
rum rum rum rum rum rum, then it was quiet for a minute, then the
children&#8217;s
noise would gradually get louder and louder and louder, then the
footsteps and
the mumbling and quiet. I have heard this a hundred times it just keeps
repeating the exact same thing over and over again however long you are
out
there. I also saw one time while I was in the kitchen cleaning, I
glanced out
the window, it was the middle of the day, and saw a black snake curled
around
what was a statue sitting on top a cement cover of an old well. It was
as thick
as a basketball, and 15 or more ft. long. I ran out and got my son who
was
playing in the back yard came in and shut all the doors and windows but
when I
looked out again it was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hello, my name is
Deanna I'm
22, from Northern Saskatchewan, Canada. I've admired your website for
over 6
years, and sent a couple stories. Anyway, I've had a lot of experiences
and
heard true stories from friends &amp; family these past years. I was
sixteen at
the time, and was visiting my grandparents in Frog Lake Alberta, with
my sister
Ashley, and cousin Laren (as we usually did every so often eekend).
Keep in
mind, my grandparent's house was always creepy and you'd have that
eerie
feeling like you were being watched, or you weren't alone. Anyway, we
were home
alone while my grandparents went off to their usual "bingo" nights
(LOL), and my sister was down in the basement doing laundry and
homework, while
me and my cousin Laren were upstairs watching TV. All of a sudden I
heard my
sister shout my name, so I went running downstairs and found her
sitting on a
chair and looked like she seen a ghost. She had tears running down her
face,
and I asked what was wrong, and then she said "I was folding my
clothes,
then I heard the pages from my book flipping. So I went to check it
out, and
all of a sudden my pencil came rolling towards me". And after she told
me,
I was so scared, I couldn't believe it right away, I was the skeptical
one, but
the look in her eyes and the seriousness in her voice made me believe
she had
seen something. So not long after wards, I called my cousin Laren down,
and he
came running. We had told him what had happened, and sure he looked
like he
didn't believe us. That changed when we all heard a huge bang coming
from
upstairs. Nobody was up there. And we were in a wooded area, both doors
were
locked, no pets, and the nearest house was nearly 2 miles away. We
tried
debunking it, but nothing made sense. We were the only ones home. And
then
again, to our surprise, we heard that same loud bang upstairs. It
sounded as if
someone stomping their foot on the floor. We all looked at each other,
saying
"what the hell was that? Did you hear it too?". My heart was racing.
It doesn't stop there. And then, we heard what sounded like someone
shuffling
their feet in the hallway upstairs. By this time, we were all crying,
and
didn't know what to do. The shuffling moved towards the kitchen, then
we heard
the chair pull out like someone sat down. We were just bawling like
babies,
trying to keep our voice down. Then, it got scarier, whatever it was
talked to
us in our language, sounded like an elderly woman. Luckily we had the
cordless
phone. I called my dad at first, and he didn't know what to do, because
he was
180 kms away. I don't know what I was thinking calling him, he was the
first
person I thought of. Then he told me to call my other grandpa that
lived in the
area. So I did, and it seemed like forever for him to get there. We
kept
hearing it still talking. There we were, on the stairwell waiting for
my
grandpa to get there, then he finally did. 5 minutes seemed like a
lifetime. We
heard him drive towards the back door, because he knew we were at the
bottom of
the stairwell. When he finally knocked on the back door, we told my
cousin
Laren to go unlock the door, because we were scared as hell. And we can
still
hear that voice talking to us. Then my grandpa came in, and shocked to
find us
in the basement crying. He didn't know what was going on, but he knew
something
was wrong. So yeah, that's only one of the stories that happened at my
grandparents house. Here is another one that happened upstairs this
time. And
of course, their were 3 of us home alone again. We were sitting down in
the
living room watching TV. The TV is right beside the big living room
window. And
it was about 11 pm, the usual time for my grandparents to get back,
when we saw
a vehicle's headlights come towards the house. We all said "oh, they're
home now". My grandpa always joked around, like he'd shut his
headlights
off, so that he would try and scare us. This vehicle shut their lights
off, and
I thought, and said "haha, he shut his lights off". Then we all
started to chuckle a bit. We waited at the couch, waiting to hear foot
steps at
the door. But, nothing. It was strange, we found it odd, because it
doesn't
take them 3 minutes to get out of the vehicle and walk to the front
door. We
all looked at each other, then I said "Laren, go check out the window
to
see if they need help". So he peeked out the window, he looked back at
me
with this shocked look. I said "What?", and then he said "nobody
is out there". My heart started beating really fast. We all got the
nerve
to go outside. It had snowed pretty hard that night too, and there were
no
tracks at all, in the fresh snow that just fell. We all could have
sworn, we
saw a vehicle coming to the house. But nope, there was nobody. We even
got my
grandpa to go check for tracks, he checked on the road, and all over.
Still,
nothing. To this day, we still can't explain what happened. We know
what we
saw, and we're not crazy. My grandma also told me, that there's an
abandoned
house about 2 kms south of the house I was in, that the previous owner
shot his
wife, then himself about 10 years ago. :o scary. Feel free to email me.
Thanks
for reading, I'll be sending more. :)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Back in 2000 when
my parents
decided to move in Colorado, we stayed in one of the properties owned
by my
uncle, who previously was letting my cousin rent but moved out
suddenly.
Anyways once settled there I got the room that belonged to my cousin,
one night
we were all there hanging out, just talking then my cousin asked if I
had seen
it, I said seen what? The ghost in the closet he said, I said no, he
told us
how this ghost would come out of the closet and scare his son at night;
he
would call it &#8220;the monster&#8221;. Thinking he was just trying to scare me I
didn&#8217;t
ask him anymore about it. A couple nights went by and nothing, So one
night I
was in my room with all the lights off except my little reading lamp,
reading
my bible it was really late at night, very quiet and still, when all of
sudden
I heard something moving in the closet I thought maybe a mouse, but it
sounded
like it was something way larger than a mouse so I put my bible and
lamp down
and listened, in complete darkness only light I had was the moonlight.
The
closet is right next to the window and right below my window I had a
very large
and heavy black dresser, very hard to move. Well whatever it was I
never saw it
but I heard it and felt it, as it came out of the closet and jumped on
the
dresser,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the wood actually cracked several
times from the weight of &#8220;the monster&#8221; it sounded as if it was
clutching it
with claws almost. It was so heavy that it was as if the dresser wanted
to
break as the wood was cracking as its weight was shifting on the
dresser. I was
terrified and could not move for fear that it would jump on me or
something
because I felt that it was looking at me directly. So whatever it was
jumped
off the dresser and made a very loud sound when it hit the carpet, what
made
every hair on me stand was that it hissed and growled at me in a very
deep
voice, it was getting closer to my bed, I could hear the thumps it made
as it
moved on the carpet. Somehow I managed to move my legs even though I
felt like
they were going to give out on me as I ran passed it to reach my door.
I could
feel as if a hand or something was touching the back of my head and
hair while
running to the door. I never stayed in that room again by myself. My
parents
checked the dresser for any breaks or cracks but there was none. By far
one of
the scariest experiences I&#8217;ve ever had!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My father remarried
3 years
ago and when we moved into his wifes house I began experiencing
paranormal
things. I had experiencing thins ever since I was a chilld, my mom and
siblings
were always sensitive to the paranormal. My siblings were pretty used
to it,
but I'd never seen anything significant until we moved into our new
home. It
started slowly, I couldn't sleep well at night and had been hearing
bangs. I
dismissed it all at first as being in new surroundings but it
continued. my
sister moved in and we began sharing stories about things we had heard
in the
house. They were matching up pretty well. One night I was laying in bed
and I
heard hands slam against my window and slide down it. I freaked out
because my
window had a screen on it. So I went into my sisters room to sleep with
her and
kept hearing banging from my room. There was no one in there. I slept
in my
sisters room a coupe times before I could sleep in my room again. I
began
seeing black<span style="">&nbsp; </span>masses for breif moments
after a while and my sister had one in her room that was about 8 feet
tall and
human shaped. We began doing all we knew, praying. After a few years of
this I
got a little used to it, but couldn't wander the halls at night without
being
terrified. One night I was playing on the computer and heard a very
lound bang
like a door slamming so I went to my room. I shut my door and leaned
against it
and heard running up and down the hallway. Things like this began
happening on
a regular bases and at the time I felt like my sister was the only one
I could
talk to. Then one day something on a different level happened. I was in
bed at
night and I had a bunch of glass carosells on my dresser. I'm a firm
believer
in 3 am being the witching hour and at that time, all of my carosells
went off
playing music and a couple fell off the dresser. Once again I prayed
and slept
with the lights on. I had one final major experience before I moved
out. My
dads room stayed locked during the day, so when we heard scratching on
the
walls. It sounded like something was scratching the walls and the
ceiling. I
ran to the bedroom door and it stopped but could see a shadow moving
around
under the door. The scratching then continued so I went outside. I
moved and
don't experience things like that anymore, but sometimes hear noises in
my
apartment. I just ignore it because I know my family and I are
suspectibal to
these kinds of things. Just keep my faith and know that I know its
human in my
apartment. But my dads house I'm not so sure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have without a
doubt always
believed in energies and "supernatural" events which we cannot
explain.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One day we may understand
the
spirit world more clearly, but I don't believe the subject will ever
fit into a
text book.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In ancient days when it
thundered, people claimed the gods were speaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>today
we have an explanation for thunder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
three kinds of true stories...the
outer circle is when a good friend<span style="">&nbsp; </span>tells
me a story that happened to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>someone they
knew well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The middle circle of stories
are made up of things which actually happened to good and emotionally
balanced
friends of mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third and innermost
circle are the rare things that have happened to me. I'll start out
with just
one story that is within the innermost circle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This happened in 1967.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was
eight years old and the event took place during the bright morning
sunshine of
a summer day when us kids were out of school.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In those days, we kids spent much more time outdoors doing kid
stuff, or
over at neighbors houses or just plane working, mostly yardwork.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>But one morning close to ten o'clock, one of
my brothers, who is eight years older than me, making him about sixteen
at the
time, and I were upstairs in the "boys room" where our family T.V.
was. It was about 9:55 and my brother and I were planning to watch an
old movie
on tv at ten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me to go
downstairs and get us a couple of fudge sickles before the movie
started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went downstairs and across the
living room
when my Daschund, Cleo, shot passed me from the kitchen area and ran as
fast as
she could upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was highly
unusual, as Cleo, being a pig of a dog, usually jumped up and down at
my feet
if I was heading to the kitchen because she always used to try and get
some
food from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I passed her by, and
headed into the kitchen, which was small and completely lit by a sink
area
window when I saw my yellow tabby cat, Feron, in the backroom, standing
in
front of the refrigerator and facing the front of the back room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not see the area he was looking at
because the thin kitchen opened up into this back, much larger room, so<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I could only see the back of the room from
the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cat's back was arched
and his hair was sticking up as he stared at something past my sight
and hissed
and growled as cats do when they are challenging another living
creature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I slowly walked to the opening
of the
backroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I saw gave me chills and
made the hair stand up on the back of my neck.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A very small, about five feet, two inches high, three foot wide,
closet
door that opened into a small closet beneath the stairs was open, and
slowly
shutting, by what power I could not see or know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
sprinted upstairs as fast as I could and
told my brother about this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked
half-way concerned because he could see the genuine fear in my eyes, so
he
grabbed his baseball bat and slowly headed downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My dog was on one of the beds shaking.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I followed him VERY closely on the way
down,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>through the streaming sunlight
coming through the windows, and we crossed the kitchen, hearing my cat
growl,
but not seeing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we rounded into
the back room my blood ran cold...The closet door was standing wide
open and
the cat was hissing at something unseen within the closet, our view
blocked by
the open door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we approached the open
door, my cat ran off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother looked
into the door, and completely relaxed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There was nothing in the closet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He didn't believe my story that I had seen the door shut. Let me
explain
a bit more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First of all, I was raised
in a very small-roomed house with absolutely NO weather materials
between the
walls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had dearborn heaters in
certain rooms we could keep warm by keeping certain doors closed,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>and we had four window air conditioners in
different rooms as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>if a person so much as took a step within
that house,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it could be heard in any
other room in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>the back door had shop bells hanging on the
inside of the door,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so you could always
hear an entrance from the back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my brother and I had never
heard a sound.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What closed the
door,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>scared my dog half to death,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>and worked my cat into fighting mode I will
never know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house had been built on
Park Street in Nacogdoches Texas in 1925.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know if anyone had died there or not as it was now used
as the
parsonage for my father,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>who was a
Reverend in the First Christian Church next door. There were also times
when my
brothers and sister would be out on Friday nights and I would be
sitting in the
living room alone, as my parents went to bed around 10:00 P.M.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I would be reading or listening to the radio,
and suddenly stop...an over-powering sense of something watching me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no doubt in my heart or head that I
was being watched, and it caused terror to sprout in my heart so thick
it could
be cut with a knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened two
definite times I can remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night
I was so scared I woke my father, and, being a good understanding man,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>he took his flashlight and, with me following,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>he searched every nook and cranny within the
house, then went back to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
helped a bit,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but I always knew that
what I felt couldn't be seen...luckily for me,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one of my brothers or sister would return between 11:00 and
midnight,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the feelings would leave
me immediately,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have other stories to
tell that happened to me directly,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but
many more that happened to friends of mine that are even scarier.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That's all I have the energy for at this
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hope you enjoyed the story as it
is perfectly true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
