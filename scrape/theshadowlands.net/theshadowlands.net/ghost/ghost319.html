<p><b>I am Watching You</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: mummiehead@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>My story started when I was around 7 or 8 years old. One night,
while
sharing my room with my 2 sisters I awoke up abruptly! Now I have
always
been a HEAVY sleeper, in fact, my mom would always tell me that it was
like I would die when I fell asleep because no one could wake me up
without
some effort. Anyway, this night I woke up startled. I looked around my
room with my eyes half open, pretending to still be sleeping. I didnt
see
anything so I fell asleep. A while later, I woke up again, but this
time
I was so startled that I even sat up in my bed! My heart was pounding
as
I looked around the room.&nbsp; I looked toward my closet first because
I always thought some monsters were going to come out and scare me, but
I didnt see anything. A little relieved I decided it was my imagination
and started laying down to fall back asleep. Now, my room had a big
sliding
window that spanned the length of the room, but the curtain wasnt long
enough for it so there was a space of about 2 inches that wasnt covered
by the curtain. My bed was next to that section of the window. As I
start
to lay down (I was facing towards the window) I noticed a man looking
at
me from outside of my window, through the 2 inch space of missing
curtain!!!!&nbsp;
The scariest part is that this man was right underneath a light but all
I could see was a black shadow and the white of his eyes! He had a
"Dick
Tracy" hat and everything else besides his eyes were a black shadow. My
heart started pounding SO hard that I felt the "man" was going to hear
it! I slowly laid down and closed my eyes. A little while later I
opened
my eyes again and thefigure was still the , just looking at me. In the
morning I told my mom but she told me it was just a dream.</b>

<p><b>We rented a home for 3 years every year around thanksgiving we
had
a little visitor every year.</b>
<br>
<b>I always saw things when I was little and felt presences in my homes
even till this day I still see things and feel things my daughter must
of inherited that gene of mine she also has had experiences. She was
taking
a bath and would talk to the ghost that I later found out that it was a
little girl and she was mean very mean my daughter would take a bath
and
come out with bruises and red marks she said the little girl did
because
she was mean . She would watch TV in my bedroom and said the girl lived
in my closet and she didn&#8217;t like me because all moms were mean and
didn&#8217;t
need to live she told my daughter. One night I was sleeping and would
feel
myself sliding off the bed and my body would tingle like it was
paralyzed
and I couldn&#8217;t move at all I couldn&#8217;t even talk it would surpass and I
would say please God help me and the feeling stopped as if it didn&#8217;t
like
the name God. Until this day my physic said it was an adult ghost
trying
to kill me and trying to have my daughter kill me it was pretending to
be a child so my daughter would trust it but she didn&#8217;t so it would
hurt
her so it came after me alone</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Land</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: GreenAjah21@aol.com</b>
<br>
<b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>Let me start by saying I never believed in ghosts and even
now&nbsp;
I still have a hard time with the idea. Although I do admit that now I
am not as fond of where I live as I once was three months ago and do
not
like to be home alone. I should start by saying I live in Dalzell S.C.
which is a tiny suburb of Sumter S.C. My husband and I live on a large
piece of land that his parents own and have lived on for years. My
husband
has lived on this land all of his 33 years and instead of leaving he
was
so attached he built a house here and I have lived here only a few
months.
This first started over a year ago now when we were first dating. I was
at his house alone sitting on the couch, when a white cat shot past my
vision down the hallway. I am positive it was a cat not only then but
now
because I saw it more than once. I was so excited to see he had a cat I
jumped up and went to find it. Well, I didn't and when he came home and
I asked him about it he said he didn't have a cat. Well, I saw that
white
streak of fur about four more times right after we started dating, I
was
freaked but I never saw it again so I kinda forgot about it until
recently.
I just put it up to my imagination. Well, it wasn't until right before
we got married that the subject of the white cat came up again but how
it came up is what really freaked me the most.</b>
<br>
<b>Our house is just a short walk from my husbands parents and we eat
lunch on Sundays and spend a great deal of time at his parents house.
Well
after lunch one Sunday my father-in-law told us he had to tell us his
latest,
"haunting story". Well, I was shocked to hear that he was watching T.V.
and was facing the hallway when the bathroom light came on. Well, no
one
else was in the house except my mother-in-law and she was in the bed
asleep.
Not only did the light come on but someone walked into the bathroom and
closed the door! Being the commando he is he jumped up and ran to the
bathroom
opened to the door and the light was on and no one was there. Well,
everyone
at the dinner table got completely serious after the story but they
also
looked a little guilty when they saw the horror on my face. I was then
informed that this isn't the first time stuff like this has happened.</b>
<br>
<b>It started with my husbands parents first night in the house. They
went to bed and when they were both almost to the point of sleeping a
person
screamed right underneath their bedroom window. They said it was the
scream
of a woman who was not just letting out a yell but screaming like she
was
getting beat or attacked. No words were spoken just screaming. So, my
father-in-law
jumped out of bed and went to run out the door but was stopped by my
mother-in-law
and just a few seconds later it quit. Well, he wasn't brave enough to
go
searching that night but they didn't get any sleep at all that night.
Nothing
else happened until my husband was a child and then there were three
things
he and his brother say happened. The first is that my brother-in-law
when
he was a teenager was sitting up late at night in the kitchen eating
when
a man who looked Latino in origin walked down the hallway. He was
wearing
a large hat and one of those things that wrap around your shoulder that
you use to hold bullets. The man stopped, looked at Jimmy, nodded his
head
as if to say HI then turned and walked into the refrigerator. The next
thing that happened was to my husband. He was playing cards with his
sister
when she got up to take a shower. He started reading a comic book when
someone entered the room. Thinking his sister had finished her shower
he
looked up and it was a little boy older than him with blond hair.&nbsp;
He said he just stared when the boy just disappeared in thin air. Ummm,
of course he ran into his parents room and had to be talked into
sleeping
in his own bed for about a week later. The third thing that happened
was
when my husband was older and a friend was over to spend the night.
They
were almost asleep when a large bang was heard in the kitchen and
everyone
came running in the house not just my husband and his friend. They got
to the kitchen and every drawer and cabinet was opened not just open
but
all drawers were open the same amount of length and every door was
opened
the same degree.</b>
<br>
<b>So now to what happened to me recently, well we have a cat now.
So I haven't seen any ghost cats but about three days ago, I was
sitting
on the couch with the cat in my lap. She was asleep but for some reason
looked over my head and her eyes opened wide. Well this shouldn't have
suprised me except that the lights were out in the living room and were
on in the hallway behind me. So I looked into her eyes which are huge
and
I saw movement above my head in her eyes. I jumped up because I was the
only one home and ran as hard as I could for the door, but looked
behind
me on the way out and nothing was there. Maybe it was overreaction.
That
is what I keep saying and my husband says. I still do not like being
home
alone now because I swear what I saw in her eyes was the figure of a
man
leaning over to pick something up off the floor in our hallway and
straighten
back up again.</b>
<br>
<b>So I do not think our house is haunted but I will bet our land is
by something.</b>

<b>Camping at Hanging Rock</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RCTW4@aol.com</b>
<br>
<b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p>
<p><b>Me and my husband and our 2 young children love camping up in
Hanging
Rock State Park North Carolina. One day we gathered a couple of friends
and our kids and headed out for a weekend of camping. The first night
we
stayed it started raining at about 7:30pm and my husband told me and my
friend to go to the store to get some extra firewood so we would have
enough
just in case. So me and my friend left to go to the store and as we
were
leaving the gates we looked over and saw a man standing by the gate in
a small parking lot close to the road. I observed that he had no means
of transportation and he was right up close to the road on the drivers
side. He stared at us and his whole body turned as we passed and I
can't
get the look in his eyes out of my mind. He honestly reminded me of a
killer
to know the truth but I figured he was a ranger or something. I looked
at the clock and my friend asked. "He isn't closing the gate is he?" I
looked in the rearview mirror and saw him turn and walk towards the
woods
which was out of the way away from the road across the parking lot. I
glanced
for just a second at my friend to tell her no and when I looked up
again
he was gone. She even looked and saw nothing and we both at that point
agreed that there was no way anyone could run that fast into the woods
from where he was standing. Imagine you are in a car going about 10
miles
an hour and you pass someone on the road you can see them if your
driving
maybe to the back part of the front window and then to see them you
have
to look straight up into the rearview mirror or the side mirror and you
glance down for a split second and you should still see that person at
least until you turn on a curve. We were still on a straight way when
he
disappeared. I told my husband that when we got back and he said to me
that he wouldn't doubt it one bit because he had something happen to
him
when he went fishing there at night. He was standing on the pier
fishing
minding his own business when he saw what looked like a flashlight
shining
in the woods behind him so he moved to another spot because he wanted
to
be alone. When he started fishing again he saw the light coming towards
him again so he called out "hay who's there!" and he paused and waited
for a response and then he said. "Are you the park ranger? If you are I
just want you to know I'll be leaving now." Still no one responded so
he
decided he would go towards the light to see what it was. Every time he
got a little closer it seamed to blink off and then blink on in another
spot. It made him afraid because he had an overwhelming sense of terror
run through his body. All he could think about is I better get out of
here
cause what if its a crazy person messing with him. So he headed back
towards
the path that leads out of the woods around the lake and he swears he
heard
footsteps coming behind him and he looked behind him and he saw the
light
coming towards him going at a fast pace so he started running. and when
he got up to the road the light went out. At that point he came back to
the campground but he didn't tell me because the raccoons were scaring
me and the kids enough as it was. And we have also talked to quite a
few
rangers and volunteers there we asked them if they have seen anything
strange
at the park and a lot of them say that there is a white deer with
albino
red eyes that had been spotted by a lot of people and quite a few
workers
there, but they believe that the deer is either really old or it is
albino.
This deer has frightened campers there so the rangers on occasion will
full warn campers about him and they say he is an actual live deer. I
myself
have not seen him but maybe one day And hopefully I will have my camera
ready.</b>
<br>
<b>Thank you for reading this and please don't be afraid to go camping
here because this is really a great place for family camping. And If
anyone
has had any interesting experiences camping here I would like it if you
share yours too. And if there are any legends about this State Park I
would
enjoy knowing them. Again thank you for allowing me to share this true
campfire story with you.</b>

scared
look on my face. she asked what was wrong. i told her that i could have
been hallucinating but told her anyway that i saw a tall white figure

<p><b>The Dunaway House .... A large two story home on top a hill is
the
home of several "spirits".&nbsp; This house was owned by my grandfather
FJ Slay.&nbsp; He and my grandmother lived in the lower section of the
house and over the years they rented the upper portion to various
family
members.&nbsp; My mom and dad rented from them for many years in my
adolescent
years.&nbsp; There are MANY stories of different happenings in the
house
in which the entire household would and could hear.&nbsp; One event
really
raised eyebrows when a "spirit" strolled through the hallway and into
the
kitchen.&nbsp; A storage room door (which was VERY hard to open) opened
and partially closed causing it to "creak" from rusted hinges.&nbsp; My
dad investigated (with gun in hand) and nothing was there !!!&nbsp;
Many
occasions footsteps are heard walking the stairway. Many occasions
"breathing"
could be heard throughout the house.&nbsp; Many occasions shadows could
be seen watching over us and would turn and move away when seen.&nbsp;
There are three large houses in a one block area and "folklore" has it
that there had been a family in the area that had a child and by
unknown
means the child died.&nbsp; The parents were said to have buried the
child
underneath one of the houses in a well.&nbsp; The only thing we do know
is that the spirits only live in the one house</b><b></b>

in a cold sweat an i looked out the window an everything was pitch
black
where their should have been campers an it was close to a full moon an
a cloudless night so i really should have been able to see things but
all
i saw was black an then a white wolf stood their next to where a camper
an tree was an this thing was rather big an then it turned into a women
with flowing hair an in a white dress like a wedding dress maybe but

<b>I Have Seen Shadows</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>I have seen shadows.....</b>
<br>
<b>Most recent story...</b>
<br>
<b>I mostly see the spirits as "shadows" feel them sometimes. I have
seen them in a child hood home, in Germany when I lived there and here
in Houston.</b>
<br>
<b>all of them at the homes where I have lived.</b>
<br>
<b>&nbsp;The last one was at my home. After for some inexplicable
reason
went to a cementary to look for a grave, don't ask me why. I just felt
like going and found the gravestone of a SON. I knelt and pray and
while
praying I heard footsteps getting closer where I was, I raise my head
and
turn around but no one was there. I figured out, HE came to see who was
praying for him. Later, I would visit him once in a while. The last
time,
I heard in my head HIM telling me in a sad tone, "You are not going to
see me anymore". I haven't been back although I had passed by that
cementery.
I saw a shadow in my home once, I think it was him.</b>
<br>
<b>Another story...</b>
<br>
<b>My parents lived in a house in Corpus Christi, when I went to visit
them I could feel someone watching me in the hall. My sister noticed
'someone'
sitting next to her in the bed, she could even seen the imprint of
someone
sitting in her bed. My other sister would run to use the bathroom
because
she didn't like the feel of the hall. Later, after they sold the house,
which by the way it was so close to the beach and couldn't understand
why
they sold it. She told me that it got to a point that my sisters,
parents
and everyone else would sleep together in one room!. It was not a scary
'ghost' but they were afraid.</b>
<br>
<b>Second story...</b>
<br>
<b>I saw another shadow when I lived in Germany in the house where
I used to live. It was scary because I wasn't able to get up from bed I
felt that something was keeping me there and I could not get up. I saw
the shadow of a boy (maybe a teenager) at the corner and when he
noticed
me he just move closer to the corner. I prayed inside my head, since I
could not even speak. My mom felt something in that house too. Everyone
was afraid of the hall. Even a friend of ours was afraid to use the
bathroom
unless someone was in the hall while he used the restroom. The hall was
always cold and dark. I felt being watched there all the time and
sometimes
afraid even though nothing scary happend to me with the exception of
seeing
the shadow that night.</b>
<br>
<b>My first time seeing a shadow...</b>
<br>
<b>was when I was a little girl in a house that we used to live. It
was a tall man. He was walking by the wall and disappear when he got
close
to my grandma's casket. She had died and left her casket in our living
room overnight instead of a funeral home. The shadow seemed familiar. I
could have swear that I saw him previously on roof of the church
located
across our home. It was said that our house (actually the block) was
part
of the cementary located in the next block. My mom would see underneath
her door shadows of someone walking by the hall, which she always make
sure to leave the light on. She would hear whispers and when my grandpa
went to stay for vacation, asked my mom why she was washing dishes in
the
middle of the night. Of course, my mom wasn't washing any dishes. Also,
my grandpa would feel or hear someone walking in the hall and stopping
at the frame of his bedroom door.</b>

unseen source of fingernails</b>
<br>
<b>Des Moiness Iowa- The Haunted Bridge Past Greenfield Plaza - It
is believed that A young woman was leaving a party and going to go pick
up her baby daughter from the babysitter's house. It was winter and
snow
and ice had covered the ground, causing it to be slick outside. Just
before
she had crossed the bridge, she went over a slick spot in the road
causing
her to lose control of her car. The car fell off the bridge into the
river.
Her daughter died instantly and she didn't want to live thinking it was
her fault. She decided to hang herse from the bridge with rope she had
in her trunk. Every Friday night at approximately midnight, if you park
right in the middle of the bridge, you can hear her baby screaming and
see formations of her hanging from the bridge</b>
<br>
<b>Also</b>
<br>
<b>Madrid - Mt Hope Cemetery - Toward the back of the cemetery there
are five graves of children from the same family. One of them is Sara.
She likes to follow visitors around and several have said they hear a
child's
voice asking for Ree. If she is not answered she will tug at clothes
and
touch people.</b>
<br>
<b>come to find out I live on the same Highway as this cemetery is,
I stopped there this morning around 10 am Luckily it is a small
cemetary,
I did indeed find Sarah I knew it was her as with the story she is last
in a row of a family with other dead childern they are that old sand
stone
stuff that after yrs you can't read but oddly while two have fallen and
only one you can make out the word infant Sarahs is still standing and
her name is clear, Possibly with a Rubbing the rest of her marker and
the
others might be read, I did not feel or hear anything butwsa early and
the&nbsp; there were people preparing a sight for a funeral today. Well
just after dusk My daughter and i went out to mount hope to visit the
Sarah
site. I took several pictures, my daughter is more receptive then i
am&nbsp;
she kept asking me if I knew how she died, which i have not been able
to
uncover that and finally she admited she felt the girl had been shot.
and
one does have to wonder why this family lost what appeared to me out of
the set four chilern one an infant. But also in a cemetery she could
have
been picking up anyone soul's vibe. I will be going to town thursday
afternoon
and will drop the film off at a one hour shop lets hope it yeilds
something,
i took several with my daughter in the shot since she seemed to feel

<p><b>Little Girl</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: LAXDispatch@amadotrucking.com</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>My son is 19 years old and last year he had a scary
experience.&nbsp;
Unlike my other 2 children he never really believed in the super
natural
until he found out the hard way.&nbsp; He went to take care of my
mother
and father who just got out of the hospital.&nbsp; Now to top it off my
father had dementia.&nbsp; He would tell my son that he heard a little
girl crying for help.&nbsp; In fact he told me and of course we figured
it was his condition since my mother never heard anything.&nbsp; Well
one
night my son was watching television it was about 10 or 10:30 at night
when he heard a voice call him.&nbsp; He thought it was his
grandparents
so he went to check.&nbsp; They were sound asleep. He figured oh I'm
hearing
things and went back to watch television, he sat down looked up and
there
stood a little girl in a blue dress long hair around 8 or 9 years of
age.&nbsp;
He rubbed his eyes and she was gone.&nbsp; He ran to the phone and
called
me and he said mom I'm really scared.&nbsp; I thought that was strange
because my son does not scare easily.&nbsp; He explained what he was
and
told me to talk to him to clam him down so I did.&nbsp; A few days
later
he mentioned it to his nephew who then described the little girl.&nbsp;
My son asked how do you know?&nbsp; His nephew replied I saw her
reflection
in the television when it wasn't on she was standing behind me, when I
turned around she was gone.&nbsp; Then later on he and a few more of
the
nephews were over and you know how boys are they were talking all kinds
of things when the little girl subject came up.&nbsp; Suddenly the room
got cold and my son in front of witness got pushed. Everyone asked him
what the heck was that?&nbsp; My son looked up and said she pushed
me.&nbsp;
Then his nephew began to tease him about it saying you know when a girl
pushes you, you know they like you.&nbsp; Oh great he says now I've got
a little girl who's a ghost that likes me.&nbsp; Later my older son's
girlfriend
move in with my parents to help out.&nbsp; She has a baby who was about
6 months at the time.&nbsp; I personally witness this you would hear
whispering
on the monitor when the baby was in the crib asleep and no one else was
in the room and at times when the baby was in her swing she would be
laughing
and moving as if some was tickling her.&nbsp; My older son hung sage
threw
the house and told all the sprits to leave since there was more then
one.&nbsp;
Since then there has been activity in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks
again for letting tell another story</b>

<p><b>Lambertville Highschool</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: Tortorello@turnpike.state.nj.us</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>My buddy called me up tonight and asked if I wanted to go ghost
hunting.
I</b>
<br>
<b>was quite intreaged seeing how I've been following this thread and
reading</b>
<br>
<b>way to many ghost stories lately. So he tells me we're going up
to the old</b>
<br>
<b>Lambertville High School.</b>
<br>
<b>A little back ground first. The place was built in 1854, but burnt
down in</b>
<br>
<b>1926. It was remoldeled in 1927, only to burn down again in 1982
(or</b>
<br>
<b>possibly 1992, i've heard different reports). Anyways the building
still</b>
<br>
<b>sorta stands there all burnt down.</b>
<br>
<b>Another local legend is that of "Buckeye". There is actually
two`versions
of</b>
<br>
<b>this story, but with the same basic back story. There was a
championship</b>
<br>
<b>football game between Lambertville and New Hope (PA). An intense
game was</b>
<br>
<b>going on. During a normal play, one of the New Hope Buckeyes was
tackled to</b>
<br>
<b>the ground. When all the players got up, this boy was left lying
still on</b>
<br>
<b>the grass. His neck was broken and his head was doing a 180. Because
of this</b>
<br>
<b>tragedy, the parents of the New Hope students had football removed
form the</b>
<br>
<b>schools extra-curricular activities. Urban legend #1- You are to
stand on</b>
<br>
<b>the landing between the first and second floors, just inside the
front</b>
<br>
<b>doors, and say out loud "I challenge Billy (or Buckeye, depending
on who you</b>
<br>
<b>ask) to a football game!" Then, out of nowhere, a football is
supposed
to</b>
<br>
<b>fly straight at your head, breaking your neck. Urban Legend #2-
While on the</b>
<br>
<b>football field, located somewhere further up the hill, one is
supposed
to</b>
<br>
<b>say out loud "Buckeye, I challenge you to a race!" A wind blows
in, then</b>
<br>
<b>either a mist arises or a pair of glowing, red eyes appear at one
end of the</b>
<br>
<b>field. A voices is heard saying "Run to the other end of the field
or die!"</b>
<br>
<b>Ok, most of the sites that I found this on had stories from "a
friend
of</b>
<br>
<b>mine" who always swears it's true.</b>
<br>
<b>Well regardless. We made our way up the creepy hill to the even
creepier</b>
<br>
<b>building. This place just begs for people to come and investigate
it. The</b>
<br>
<b>front is closed off by a screen door...so in other words useless.
The first</b>
<br>
<b>floor is kinda boring. Its all burnt out and nothing exicting but
some</b>
<br>
<b>entertaining graffitti.</b>
<br>
<b>So we walked up to the 2nd floor. 2 of my friends walked into the
first room</b>
<br>
<b>on the right. Nothing spectacular in there. A few of us heard
something</b>
<br>
<b>moving around in the rooms across the hall. Unfortunatly the supposed</b>
<br>
<b>mystical chalk boards that should have drawings of burning/cryin
children</b>
<br>
<b>were gone. I looked straight ahead instead of in the room and I
swear I saw</b>
<br>
<b>2 red eyes looking right at me from the top left window. I though,
"it has</b>
<br>
<b>to be a reflection or something..." You know how windows have the
cross</b>
<br>
<b>beams in them? Well I moved to the rigth a bit and sure enough one
of the</b>
<br>
<b>eyes appeared to be hidden by the beam. I moved back over and felt
the eyes</b>
<br>
<b>watching me again. I told everyone I saw something, my friend tried
to get</b>
<br>
<b>it on camera. He didnt get anything but a few seconds later they
just</b>
<br>
<b>disappeared.</b>
<br>
<b>That was it for me, I totally freaked out. We all just made our
way out fo</b>
<br>
<b>there and headed back to the car. Regardless of what my friends
migth think</b>
<br>
<b>I know what I saw. It was not a reflection, and it was deffently
not an</b>
<br>
<b>animal. I cannot explain where those red lights came from but I
wasn't about</b>
<br>
<b>to stick around long enough to find out. We never made it to the
football</b>
<br>
<b>field, and I don't think I'll be going back there any time soon.
Hope I can</b>
<br>
<b>get some sleep tonight...</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Staircase</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: n52@hotmail.com</b>
<br>
<b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was about 13 my
family moved into an old house in the</b>
<br>
<b>countryside.&nbsp; We hadn't even lived there for 6 months before
my sister and I</b>
<br>
<b>started to feel like the place was haunted.</b>
<br>
<b>The first event happened during a long rainstorm.&nbsp; The roof
leaked, so we</b>
<br>
<b>were all staying in the living room where no water was coming
in.&nbsp;
Lightning</b>
<br>
<b>struck and hit our fusebox.&nbsp; My mom was worried about the house
catching</b>
<br>
<b>fire so she made us all move to one of the rooms closer to the door.</b>
<br>
<b>After a few hours I had to go upstairs to check on our
hamsters.&nbsp;
I headed</b>
<br>
<b>into the hallway that leads to the steps.&nbsp; As a bolt of
lightning
flashed I</b>
<br>
<b>noticed what looked like a man's shadow heading for the steps.&nbsp;
It was not</b>
<br>
<b>my own, because the shadow crossed my path instead of following
it.&nbsp; This</b>
<br>
<b>creeped me out, so I hurried upstairs and back down.</b>
<br>
<b>Almost a year later I was home by myself.&nbsp; I was upstairs in
my room.&nbsp; I</b>
<br>
<b>thought I heard my mom come in the kitchen (which was right below
my room)</b>
<br>
<b>and start going through the pots and pans.&nbsp; I looked out my
window and saw</b>
<br>
<b>that her car was not there.&nbsp; Whatever was down there was not
my mom.&nbsp; So I</b>
<br>
<b>grabbed a pocket knife off my desk for protection and went to
investigate.</b>
<br>
<b>I found nothing.&nbsp; I was spooked, so I decided to stay
downstairs
and just</b>
<br>
<b>watch TV till mom got back.</b>
<br>
<b>About 30 minutes later I heard noises in my room.&nbsp; Again they
were like</b>
<br>
<b>someone was searching through my stuff.&nbsp; I grabbed my knife
again and went</b>
<br>
<b>back to my room.&nbsp; When I got there there was no trace of anyone
having been</b>
<br>
<b>there.&nbsp; At this point I had had enough and stayed upstairs
until my mom came</b>
<br>
<b>back.&nbsp; I heard noises in the kitchen again, but did not
investigate
anymore.</b>
<br>
<b>Several years later I started feeling a presence on our
staircase.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br>
<b>staircase was split into two sections, with a small landing in
between.
I</b>
<br>
<b>hated this landing.&nbsp; It always felt like something was
there.&nbsp;
My sister</b>
<br>
<b>also felt it.&nbsp; She refused to even use the stairs unless all
the lights were</b>
<br>
<b>on.</b>
<br>
<b>It just happened that my sister was friends with the daughter of
a lady</b>
<br>
<b>that worked at the real estate company that had sold us the
house.&nbsp;
The lady</b>
<br>
<b>said that there were reports about the house being haunted.&nbsp;
She herself</b>
<br>
<b>would not go in the house.&nbsp; I never was able to find out
anymore
details</b>
<br>
<b>about the haunting or the house's history.&nbsp; To this day I still
wonder what</b>
<br>
<b>was there and why it was there.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Spy House, Port Monmouth, NJ</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: nfitton@juno.com</b>
<br>
<b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p>
<p><b>I really enjoy your website.&nbsp; A lot of great stories and it
is really nice to know that these experiances are shared throughout.</b>
<br>
<b>I am sure you know a lot about the Spy House in Port Monmouth,
NJ.&nbsp;
There is a lot of background to it.&nbsp; I won't spend the time going
into it now, except that it is really really hauted.</b>
<br>
<b>About 2 years ago I took a trip to the spy house with a couple of
friends from work.&nbsp; I had heard that this was a great place to get
really freak out.&nbsp; After about 20 minutes we found it.&nbsp; Now
this
isn't the typical looking hauted house.&nbsp; It looks brand new with a
big gravel and dirt parking lot, and a pier off to the side were people
fish off of.&nbsp; Well needless to say as soon as we pulled in to the
parking lot I got gossbumps all over me.</b>
<br>
<b>It was about 2am in the morning.&nbsp; He really had not seen
anything.&nbsp;
Disappointed my friend picked up his cell phone and called his g/f to
tell
here we were on our way.&nbsp; Well in the middle of his conversation
his
hair on his arms stood straight up, goose bumps ran up and down hir arm
and neck.&nbsp; And he became died quiet.&nbsp; We all got a little
freak
out by this and starting asking him what happened.&nbsp; Mind you his
g/f
is still on the phone.&nbsp; He put the phone down, not turning it off,
and turned to us and told us that someone on the phone&nbsp; asked him
why he had come here...and that did he understand what karma was?&nbsp;
Well this to me just sounded to be a buch of BS.&nbsp; So I said give
me
the phone.&nbsp; Which he did.&nbsp; At that point I heard it, a lot of
static and then a Child Screaming, and falling down stairs.&nbsp; It
wasn't
just me who heard it, it was loud enough that the his g/f heard it on
the
phone, and everyone in the car heard it, about 5 of us.&nbsp; Well I
didn't
want to stick around to see if this was someone messing with us or just
a bad connection.&nbsp; So we turned the car one and started to make a
u-turn in the driveway.&nbsp; He hadn;'t turned on his front head
lights
yet.&nbsp; Well as we turned we looked straight ahead of us and there
were
about 6 little kids, in revolutionary style clothing playing and
tauting
each other.&nbsp; We could see them clear as day.&nbsp; Well the tough
guys that we are, we all screamed, a</b>
<br>
<b>&nbsp;he turned on the lights and bolted out of there.</b>
<br>
<b>The next night we had to go back.&nbsp; It become an obession to
see it.&nbsp; And to see if we weren't all going crazy.&nbsp; Well we
got
there about 1am.&nbsp; Got of the car and walked around the
house.&nbsp;
Peering into windows, and every window we looked into had a really
creapy
feeling.&nbsp; Then we heard music start to play.&nbsp; Well we&nbsp;
had
enough of that and got back into the car.&nbsp; We postioned the car so
we could look directly at the back of the house into the windows.&nbsp;
We sat there.&nbsp; And sat there.&nbsp; Then we saw it, a latern going
across the windows at the top of the house.&nbsp; Mind you the place is
not accupied and heavly locked down.&nbsp; It went from one window to
another
stopping for a second and then continuing until it faded.&nbsp; Well
next
thing we know, my friend is screeming and telling us to look at the
bottom
left hand wind.&nbsp; There she was, all white, tall, long flowing
white
hair, and here eyes were as black as night.&nbsp; Like big black port
holes
just staring at us!&nbsp; We all screamed and then in a flash she was
gone.&nbsp;
We thought maybe this was a mirage.&nbsp; And convinced the driver not
to move.&nbsp; Well another 10 minutes went by and she appeared
again!&nbsp;
Just staring at us, longer this time.&nbsp; Like telling us to
leave.&nbsp;
This happened TWO MORE TIMES.&nbsp; Each time it got more and more
scary.&nbsp;
Well having enough of just about pissing our pants we decided to
leave.&nbsp;
But I wasn't statisfied.&nbsp; I got out of the car.&nbsp; And yelled
"I'VE
GOT YOUR KARMA RIGHT HERE!!!" And then IT appeared.&nbsp; A huge black
floating head.&nbsp; About 6" off the ground near the window where the
women was.&nbsp; And then we heard a horrifing SCREAM.&nbsp; Scratchy,
deep, and loud.&nbsp; Well that was it, I jumped in the car and we
hauled
out of there.&nbsp; Actually I haven't been back since I tauted
whatever
that was.&nbsp; Sorry for such a long story but I am proud of it since
I have never believe in ghosts until that point in my life.&nbsp;

else with similar experiances can email me anytime.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Germany Visits</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: gladysc@alexanderclassic.com</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>There is another things that happened to me in my home back in
Germany.</b>
<br>
<b>I told you about feeling paralyzed and not being able to get up
and the shadow that moved closer to the corner of my bedroom.</b>
<br>
<b>I was scared sometimes being along in that house. One day I prayed
for my godmother, she died several years earlier, and suddenly the
whole
room light up. It seemed the light came from the lamp, but the whole
living
room was illuminated, have you ever seen so much light yet it didn't
bother
your eyes? well, that is what happened. Suddenly, I felt comforted,
peaceful
as by being hug by this light. Then, it occurred to me that probably I
would see her. and then I prayed, "Please godmother, do not appear to
me,
I am not ready to see you" the light vanished. But I felt at peace.</b>
<br>
<b>Also I had several dreams about angels. Most of my dreams, they
take me to a higher area and I see a beam of light coming from the sky
and see angels, small angels coming and going to earth, one thing I
remember
the most is several small angels caring this big person, he looked like
a monk, and also a car with people inside. In another occasion I was in
a big room with two people talking to me, I don't remember what they
were
telling for some reason I knew what would happen next. The room had
like
three large windows and when looking out of one of those windows a
large
angel materialized He was probably two stories high, he had a book and
read from this book. I don't remember what he said.</b>
<br>
<b>Another dream, it seemed like I was actually awake or aware at the
time. I was sleeping and in the ceiling appeared a cloud and then an
angel
peeked out of the cloud and was giving me this baby and placed it on my
tummy. I look at my tummy with this newborn child on top of my tummy. I
held him and gave it back to the angel.</b>
<br>
<b>The angel gave it back to me and the child was getting attached
to my tummy. I told the angel that I wasn't ready to have the baby and
gave it back to him/her.</b>
<br>
<b>That was all. I awoke and I didn't know what to think, later I was
thinking that probably I should have accepted the baby. But as I told
the
angel I didn't feel ready to have a child.</b>
<br>
<b>Those were dreams. I have a dream of someone I have never met but
somehow I assumed he was my brother. I was in this place sitting in a
bench
and there were so many big, fresh roses and he emerged from one of
those
roses and sat with me and we were talking.</b>
<br>
<b>This is not a dream, but it actually happened to me while awake.
At my school I could not see them but I felt angels, and I heard them
calling
my name in several occasions. One day, when I was coming home from
school,
I was crossing the street and I felt someone touching my shoulder I
turned
around and I didn't see anyone, I don't remember if the following event
happened the same day or another day, but when I was going to cross the
street, someone pull me from the back of my blouse and literally pull
me
out of the floor and was placed back in the sidewalk I turned around
and
no body was around. It certainly saved me from being run over by a car.
I wasn't scared at all, I knew and felt protected.</b>
<br>
<b>Feel free to include these stories if you like.</b>
<br>
<b>When I lived in Germany, there was a church close to my home. I
went to visit the church once and I could feel someone inside the
church,
even though I was the only one inside I felt 'people' in there. This
small
church had a graveyard with gravestones dating back the 1800's.</b>
<br>
<b>Also when I went for a walk by a hill in a small town in Bavaria,
I could definitely feel 'people' there. It was very strong. For some
reason,
I had the impression that it was during the WWII. I could feel 'people'
around the place. I didn't see any 'shadows' except in the 3 homes
where
I lived.</b>
<br>
<b>Some other people close to me have some personal experiences. I
will ask them if they want to share them with you.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Psychic Impressions</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By [pugsly@nep.net</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>My story began when I was still in diapers. I use to see things.
Not ordinary things but horrible things. Till this day I can still
sense
an evil spirit or whatever label you want to put on it. I am not a
professional
with this type of thing by any means but I have been dealing with this
type of things for 37 yrs. now.</b>
<br>
<b>My first experience was when I was in my crib. My mother kept me
in her bedroom. One night I woke up and saw what looked like a giant
teddy
bear sitting on the edge of her bed. It did not speak to me. I watched
it sit up and lay back down. It kept repeating this over and over. The
last time it sat up it leaned close to me. I let out a horrible scream
and my mother came running. I remember her putting me in her bed and
trying
to reassure me that all was well. I just cried uncontrollably. Mom
would
try to get me to shut my eyes and not look at these things I saw. I
cannot
explain it so you can fully understand it but these things would not
allow
me to ignore them. If I tried they came closer to me and just stared at
me. Another time in the same house I saw three bear like things. They
were
laying on a little pile of clothes beside my mothers bed. She turned on
the light and tried to show me nothing was there. By this time they
vanished.
I know what I saw and mom always tried to convince me it was a
"figment"
of my imagination. These things always showed up at night. Always after
everyone was alseep like they were only meant for me to see.</b>
<br>
<b>Next stage in my life that I can remember seeing something evil
was when I was 8. My sister thought it would be fun to have a seyonce
(spelling..?)
I stayed in the room till she started calling to spirits and lit
candles.
I got a terrible fear and ran from the room. My sister was only 9 at
the
time this happened. She was going by what she had seen on tv one time.
Though I saw nothing that night. It was shortly after that that I began
to wake up (once again at night when everyone else was asleep) always
the
weekends. I am not sure what woke me up but it happened at the same
times.
I would open my eyes and there standing at the bottom of my bed was
what
looked like an old coal miner. He was a solid thing and not something
you
could see through. His skin I will never forget was a very light tinted
green. His black suit was what stood out the most. It looked like
something
from the 1800's and very heavy looking. His body shape was that of
someone
who had severe osteoporosis and his body was haggered like someone who
had worked the coal mines all his life. He was tall, about 6ft I would
say. To me at the time he looked like a giant being only 8 yrs old at
the
time this occured. His hair was coal black. He never spoke to me once.
I remember I prayed that God would not let him speak to me or touch me.
I believe it was because of this prayer that he never did those things.
The vibes I got off this man was terrifying. I knew he meant me harm if
he could have done it. Once again I chalk this one up to God and
praying.
I saw this man regularly on the weekends. I tried to tell my mother of
these night terrors but she merely told me that it was a "figment."
Later
she gave me advice that I regretted ever trying. She told me to close
my
eyes, rub them and then open them again and it would be gone and that
would
prove I was seeing things. So I closed my eyes and rubbed them but when
I opened them, instead of this man being at the bottom of my bed. He
was
standing beside the bed and leaned right down into my face. I was so
terrified
I tried to scream. When I screamed it was like someone had turned the
volume
down. My mouth was open and nothing came out. After this I watched this
man fade out the same way he came into the room. Many nights I laid in
my bed and listened to the man walk up and down the hall. It was
carpeted
but his shoes sounded like heels in the hallway of a hospital. I know
there
was more than one "thing" in the house. I was awakened one night and
heard
a squeeking sound. I leaned across my sister (as she slept on the
outside
of the bed at this time because I refused to sleep on the outside
anymore)
and saw the rocking chair in the living room rocking all by itself. I
laid
down really fast. I could never shut my eyes as these things were going
on around me because I knew these things would come up into my face and
refused to be shut out. They demanded my attention and would not take
NO
for an answer. My eyes shut naturally on weekends. If I fell asleep it
was without my knowledge. When I woke in the mornings it was as if I
had
been transported back into the land of the living.</b>
<br>
<b>To this day I can walk anywhere and be able to tell you where these
things are at. I don't know how I am able to do it. Maybe it's the
vibes
they put off. I don't know. I surely do NOT see this as a gift or
anything
like that. I wish I knew of a way to rid myself of picking up on things
like that. Never one time have I felt a "good" spirit around me. They
have
all put off horrible, terrifying vibes. I cannot see them with my eyes
or hear them with my ears but I know when they are there. I can tell
you
where they are standing and when they move I know where they are at in
a room. Sometimes I think I am crazy or something. I have never been
into
any sort of witch craft, ouiji boards or anything like that. This came
to me when I was still in diapers</b><b></b>

<br>
<b>I was asleep in my bed, and I woke up from being cold.&nbsp; I had
already had trouble sleeping cause my parents had been fighting!&nbsp;
I was only seven and didnt understand why they had to fight.&nbsp; As I
opened my eyes I noticed a light gently caressing the room.&nbsp; I
rolled
over to see where the light source was from.&nbsp; I can remember as
good
as it was yesterday,&nbsp; my cousin, Summer, was sitting in my window
sill, and said " dont worry, it'll be ok."&nbsp; My cousin died when
she
was five and she would have been 1 month older than me.&nbsp; So she
had
died 2 years before this.&nbsp; The light was from her, it was a very
soft
glow about her.&nbsp; Not bright but a dull light.&nbsp; The window was
up, and it was shut before.&nbsp; She said that and she simply faded
away
and the window was shut.</b>
<br>
<b>I know I was not dreaming, and I know what I saw was my cousins,
"ghost" or "angel".&nbsp; That night was and is the clearest childhood
memory I have.&nbsp; She was not a "mistly" ghost, but very
detailed.&nbsp;
It looked JUST like her.</b>

<p><b>By: LuvShak120@aol.com</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>I live in South West Florida. In the area that was hit by
Hurricane
Charley. The day the storm was to hit I had a visit from our friend
that
past. I was changing sheets on our bed in the master bedroom. My Mother
in law was on the computer, my husband was outside getting our yard in
shape for the coming storm. As I bent down to tuck in the sheet I saw a
figure in the door way.</b>
<br>
<b>Having had my abilities all my life, I knew exactly who it was.
I greeted him&nbsp; with a smile and a question. That question being
about
the coming storm. The answer I got was that it would be a bad storm and
that we would be OK. I asked him to "hang out a second" so I could get
my husband to come in for the visit. At this point my Mother in law
left
the room. I've been married to her son for 11 years, so she is quite
familiar
with my abilities. She just gets a little funny when it happens. I went
out and got my husband to come inside. He wasn't too happy to do so
being
that there was so much to do. I told him we had a visitor. ( I had long
ago taught my husband to "feel" these presence) When he walked though
the
door his hair stood up and he could "feel" his old friends presence. He
requested that he protect our home and family. We told him we loved him
and missed him. With that he was gone.</b>
<br>
<b>The storm at that point was only a category 2. In the coming few
hours it turned into a 3 and in the last half hour into a 4. For those
of you who don't know about these storms, a four is deadly. Major
damage,
lost homes and lives. In that last half hour I emptied the master
closet
and we all got into it. Even our 150 lb. dog.</b>
<br>
<b>The storm lasted only a short time but we could feel the walls
shaking
on our backs. With 145 mile an hour winds that is what happens. When it
was over our house was still standing, and no one was hurt. I have
kids,
a 4 year old and a 15 year old. It is the most frightening thing to go
through.</b>
<br>
<b>I KNOW our friend was there for many reasons. The biggest was to
let us know that this storm would be life changing. I also knew that we
would be OK. Once again it's nice to know he's still with us</b><b></b>

<p><b>Abandoned Insane Asylum Mist</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: aiko_kitty@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>For the past few years, my brother and a few other people have
told
me of an</b>
<br>
<b>old abandoned insane asylum that is in a town about 45 minutes from
where I</b>
<br>
<b>live. They say this place sits way out in the middle of the woods
and has</b>
<br>
<b>been abandoned since the 50's. Well, I have always been fascinated
by urban</b>
<br>
<b>exploration, so one night, a group of my friends gathered and we
decided to</b>
<br>
<b>go see if we could find it. My brother gave us the directions and
we set</b>
<br>
<b>out. We got lost a few times, but finally, we ended up finding the
building</b>
<br>
<b>that was about 15 minutes into the woods on a dirt road that led
off the</b>
<br>
<b>main highway.</b>
<br>
<b>The building was huge, being made up of 2 floors. All the windows
had been</b>
<br>
<b>knocked out and the place had been vandalized. As we entered the
basement,</b>
<br>
<b>there was a small hallway with a large room at the end of it. We
noticed as</b>
<br>
<b>we looked down the hallway, a strange white, smokey mist started
to appear</b>
<br>
<b>and come out the doorway. At this point I started to get nervous,
but my</b>
<br>
<b>friend insisted it was probally just from the dust we were kicking
up, yet I</b>
<br>
<b>found it odd that this mist was becoming thicker by the moment.
There was no</b>
<br>
<b>way that much dust could have been created in that little amount
of time. So</b>
<br>
<b>we went into one room at the front of the hall and stayed in there
for not</b>
<br>
<b>even 2 minutes. During this time, I was getting more and more scared
and</b>
<br>
<b>just wanted to leave. So, we stepped out of the room and they
started
down</b>
<br>
<b>the hall towards the room. But by now, the mist was coming out of
the</b>
<br>
<b>doorway and was so thick, that when the flashlight was shined
through
on it,</b>
<br>
<b>you couldn't see through it. Suddenly, we heard a loud banging noise
from</b>
<br>
<b>the other side of the room that this mist was in and at that point,
we all</b>
<br>
<b>turned and left.</b>
<br>
<b>I won't be returning there again.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Tammy</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: bfblackwell@comcast.net</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>I wanted to write about my friend Tammy.&nbsp; I am 28 yrs old
and
recently the mother of a premature infant who fought for her life and
was
close to death several times but has pulled thru so far.&nbsp; she is
10
months old now but born at 24 weeks, so the size of a 5 month
old.&nbsp;
anyway... since her birth I have been dreaming awful dreams about my
childhood
friend tammy and remembering things that I once promised to
forget.&nbsp;
When we were eight years old Tammy and I were best friends.. often
spending
the night at one anothers houses and our families were very
close.&nbsp;
We lived in a small florida town and her mom was a sunday school
teacher
and elementary aid my mom was a stay at home mom and my parents had
recently
divorsed makeing my mom&nbsp; go to work and leave me with my friends
family
for safety when she was working.&nbsp; They were nice christian folks
who
always sat around the dinner table and talked about the days events and
seemed like a good family. Tammy had 2 older sisters and her mom had
just
delivered twin baby girls, when her dad got transferred with his job to
a promotion that they could not refuse in west virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of
course we were heart broken and vowed we would write and call.</b>
<br>
<b>they moved within a month of my ninth birthday.&nbsp; On
thanksgiving
day Tammy called me and sounded very distressed.&nbsp; she said she
hated
her new house and her baby sisters and her parents for makeing her come
there. It was almost six months later in the summer when my mom got a
phone
call from tammys parents wanting to see if it would be ok to send tammy
down to stay with us for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; I was so happy to see
my friend again I didnt realize how freaky she had looked upon
arrival.&nbsp;
Her mom looked like she had not slept in months, her dad was angry and
had taken up drinking, her oldest sister had ran away, her other sister
was taking medication for depression and tammy was in what we look back
on as her "black" time.&nbsp; she had only black clothing even
underpants.&nbsp;
her parents bought other colors but tammy would steal dye and dye all
of
her clothes black when her parents were sleeping.&nbsp; remember we
were
just nine years old and she was like this.</b>
<br>
<b>that first night tammy told me something and taught me something
that haunts me now.&nbsp; the home that they moved into was the
location
of a slaying. when they moved in the first week they heard a drip, then
subsequently water running. (when no water was running) then they would
hear cries of an infant in pain.. high pitch wailing.. then water
again.
Tammy would not take a bath and she would not look in mirrors. she told
me that she was in the downstairs bathroom and had washed her hands and
had looked into the mirror when she saw a baby's bloody face, looking
back
at her. According to her dad they had bought the house seven months
after
a woman, who suffered from post partem deprssion killed her 4 month old
daughter with a strike to the head&nbsp; from a hammer after the baby
sopposatly
deficated in the bath water. then the woman sopposetly killed herself
with
an overdose of pain killers and alcohol. I have no proof of this story
and it has been 20 years but he told my mom this story and said that
strange
things seem to be happening with the girls since he moved them
there..Sue
ann ran away. tonya tried to kill herself and tammy insists on wearing
black has will not take baths and started pulling out her hair. the
babies
were fine unless they were in the bathtub and they always deficated in
the water, which they didnt start doing until they moved up there.</b>
<br>
<b>tammy said they had the house looked at by a medium and then a
priest.&nbsp;
that after 4 months of seeing the baby in bath water or in the mirror
that
she started hearing a womans voice say ugly things like "hit them"
"kill
them" referring to her baby sisters who at the time were about 6 to 8
months
old. tammy told me how the "psychic" that they brought in told them the
place was haunted by several spirits but they only saw and heard the 2
most recent. and she showed me Candle talking.. which she did in my
house
and it blew me away... she lit a candle (any candle) and then said
something
to the effect of " i invite my gardian linda to speak to me, left is
yes
right is no" and the flame would shift to the left. she went on to ask
all sorts of kid questions like does tony like me to are we safe and
the
candles flame always shifted very noticbly one side or another. we had
to do this in the bathroom of my moms house because the cat would
attack
the candle if we were in the room with him.&nbsp; I once tried to
contact
"linda" and to my suprise all i got was a shift to Yes that someone was
there and a shift to no when i asked if i was safe. needless to say i
am
too chicken to go any further and i blew out the candle. anyway I am
getting
off subject.&nbsp; The family continued to live up there after a Priest
blessed the home until a year later when tammy's grandparents in FL
became
ill and they moved back. They weren't the same though.. they were
stressed
all the time, eventually divorsing she and i promised to forget about
all
of the ghost stuff because people would think we were nuts and i never
tried anything like the candle thing again ..thier family was ruined.
Tammy
now lives across the ocean in Germany (she is in the armed forces and
has
a family of her own) we lost contact in high school unfortunately ...
now
I keep seeing images of my baby in my dreams beaten and dying&nbsp; and
have thoughts of my own that maybe this new house and the circumstances
in my own childs birth have somehow made me conjure up the imagination
or the sub-concious of tammy's horrors.&nbsp; I hear a baby cry when my
baby isnt crying. Maybe i just need sleep. Maybe I am just over
sensitive
to my friends nightmare..she never gave me a reason not to believe her,</b>
<br>
<b>My boyfriend and I moved into this house where the old woman passed
away in her sleep in what is our office where i am sitting right now. I
notice the doors to the closets are open almost every morning when I
shut
them. I dont feel any presence and have written it off to being an old
house with crappy doornobs, but these dreams have me wondering
otherwise.&nbsp;
my boyfreind has started sleep walking just in our bedroom- goes to the
tv. goes to the dresser. then back to bed.&nbsp; weird huh?&nbsp;
anyway..I
wanted to submit Tammy's story. I am sorry I dont have details like the
name of the town she lived in in WV I cant remember right now.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hey guys, i might be only 15, but i am a strong beleiver in the
supernatural.
I am not so much afraid as fascinated by it. Actually, im not afraid at
all considering the times that i have encounterd a spirit, it wasnt
bad,
it just showed me the way to fixing some of my problems. For instance,
my friend was extremely angry with something i did that i would rather
not repeat. I didnt know what to do. I was certain that she was going
to
dump me. I was home alone and it was just after school. I have a white
board in my room that was completly blank. I took a shower and when i
was
done i walked into my room to find my whiteboard mounted on my wall and
it read TELL HER THE TRUTH AND YOU WILL BE FORGIVEN... i thought
something
was wrong but i told her the truth and everything has been incredible
with
her since then! I have been visited by this friendly spirit in my many
times of need, and i greatly appreciate it, if you guys could find a
way,
please give the spirit my deepest thanks and please tell her that i
enjoy
her help and want it in the future</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: sroberts5@stny.rr.com</b>
<br>
<b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p>
<p><b>This happened in the late 70's in a house that belonged to the
Navy,
located in Brunswick, Maine.&nbsp; The house was two stories and most
of
the activity took place on the second floor.&nbsp; My oldest daughter
had
the front bedroom and there was a perpetual cold spot in the area of
her
closet.&nbsp; She always felt uncomfortable in this room.</b>
<br>
<b>My youngest daughter had the bedroom on the opposite side of the
house.&nbsp; This is where things sounded like they were falling on the
floor.&nbsp; A trip upstairs to investigate always yielded nothing out
of place.</b>
<br>
<b>My bedroom was at the bottom of the stair and on one particular
occasion I had just closed to door in preparation to going to
bed.&nbsp;
There came the sound of a crash bang and thumping as if someone had
fallen
down the stairs.&nbsp; The dog we had at the time was a clumsy thing
and
it was always possible that he had misjudged his footing.&nbsp; I
immediately
opened the door to make sure no one was hurt and to my shock found
nothing
there.&nbsp; With some hesitation I went up the stairs and made the
rounds
of the bedrooms, counting all the noses, both children and
animals.&nbsp;
Everyone was accounted for and sleeping soundly.</b>
<br>
<b>We never had the thump down the stairs again, but the sounds of
a book or some such hitting floor continued until we moved out the
following
year.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Haunted Cottage</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: firecadet_70@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was eighteen, I rented a
small
cottage in my hometown. It was down the street from the daycare I
worked
at and also the firehouse where I was a volunteer firefighter. On the
day
I moved in, I was sitting in my living room unpacking when I got the
strange
feeling I was being watched. I glanced up, but saw no one. I couldnt
shake
the feeling and finally decided I just needed to take a break and get
out
of the house. As soon as I left, the feeling went away. As the months
went
by, the creepy sensation happened more and more often. Usually when I
was
alone and it was often followed by goosebumps on my arms and the back
of
my neck. About a month or so after I moved in strange things started to
happen. The first one happened when I was working out on my exercise
bike.
I had a large fan that i would set up near the bike to keep me cool. It
was the kind on a stand and had ossillation, but it was turned off. I
placed
the fan on the tile floor of the kitchen to make sure it didnt move or
fall over. A er pointing the fan at the bike, I walked across the room
to turn on my music. When I turned back around, I noticed my fan had
been
turned 15 degrees to the right and was now pointing at my wood stove. I
shrugged it off and moved it back. I got on my bike and started my
workout.
About five minutes had passed and I was feeling no air. I stopped and
turned
to look at the fan. It had again been moved 15 degrees to the right. I
checked the fan and saw nothing that could have moved it. I turned it
back,
got on my bike and started my workout again, but kept my eyes on the
fan.
It never moved again. After that, I started hearing noises. My doors
would
open and slam shut, I would find cabinet doors open and things moved
around.
More than once, I would find the toilet lid up in my bathroom. This
seemed
strange because I am a girl and the only one who lives in the house and
nobody had been to visit. One night, as I lay sleeping, I was&nbsp;
awoken
by a sudden chill. I heard a mans voice whispering in the dark. I
looked
at the end of my bed and suddenly my covers were ripped off of me and
thrown
on the floor. I screamed and quickly turned on the lights. Nobody was
there.
I got up and quickly searched my entire house and found nothing. I
started
shouting for whoever was there to leave my house. I heard nothing but
slept
the rest of the night with the light on. The following day, my friend
and
I were sitting in my living room talking about the previous night when
suddenly the sugar bowl in my kitchen flew off the counter and crashed
to the floor spreading sugar all over. I became very frightened because
there was nothing anywhere near the bowl, yet it had flown three feet
across
the room and smashed on the floor. That night I went down to the
firehouse
for our monthly meeting. I described what had been happening in my
house
and a few of the guys looked at each other. When I asked what was going
on, one of them told me about five years before, a man had died in my
house.
I went back through the call records at the rehouse and found the
report
about the man who had been found dead in the very house I was now
living
in. I became very upset and moved. Nothing has happened to me since.</b><b></b>

<br>
<b>Hi, this encounter I had was very well the scariest of all of the
ones I have ever had. I am 12 right now and when I was eight, my family
and I lived in a very small house in a town called Montrose, New York.
Since the house was tiny, me and my brother had to share the upstairs
storage
room as a bedroom. The whole upstairs was one room, so it was fairly
large
and the stairs came up the middle of the room. I had the right side of
the stairs as my room and my little brother had the left. I had two
vanities
in my room, and they were exactly opposite of each other. So, if you
looked
into one mirror, you could see the other vanity across the room. One
day,
me and my friend who had lived across the street were playing upstairs
when she had to go home. We both went downstairs and then Christin, my
friend remembered she had left her bag upstairs. I went back upstairs
to
get it, and it was on one of the vanities. I went to grab it and as i
glanced
in the mirror, what I saw was unforgettable. There were a pair of two
semi-transparent
white hands moving things around on my other vanity. I was scared to
death
and stood still, staring at the hands through my vanity mirror. They
were
phisycally moving things around on my dresser, I could see the objects
moving. At that point, I ran back downstairs, my adrenaline pumping. As
i shot into my living room I asked my friend, panting, if she happened
to be upstairs when I was getting her bag. She said she had been
downstairs
the whole time talking to my mom. Then, I told her what happened and
ever
since, I was afraid of my own bedroom. I always had to have a pet or
person
up there with me wenever i was to even go up there. Whenever I was
alone
upstairs, I felt a sense of lonelyness and helplessness up there. I
could
feel a chill and I'd instantaniously get goosebumps and would run
downstairs
as fast as I could. Sometimes, I would run downstairs ain the middle of
the night because I got that feeling,&nbsp; and I would sleep on the
couch,
downstairs. I don't know if there really was a ghost or spirit, or
whatever
upstairs, but I am positive that something deffinetly happened.</b><b></b>

<br>
<b>&nbsp;</b>
<br>
<b>Just outside the back gate of Hario housing there is a shrine
dedicated
to all the&nbsp; WWII Japanese soldiers who died while overseas.&nbsp;
Sometimes at night (more often in August) you can see the faces of
these
soldiers in the tree directly behind and on the sides of this
shrine.&nbsp;
One night while waiting for my wifes friend to be picked up there (it
use
to be the main gate when the housing first opened.&nbsp; I believe it
is
closed now), we both got a scare when out of nowhere faces started to
appear.&nbsp;
Luckily my wifes friend was picked up after the second face was seen
and
I got out of there as fast as possible.&nbsp; After the war the housing
area was used as an area where returning wounded soldiers were taken to
die.&nbsp; There has been many sightings/hauntings on this base.&nbsp;
My friends son was attacked and bitten numerous times by an unseen
entity
(you could actually see the teeth marks appear on the screaming childs
chest and arms, we were helpless and could only pray for it to
stop).&nbsp;
I lived in two different houses and have woken up to an evil entity
(white
flowing tattered dress. I could not make out facial features) many
times.&nbsp;
When this happens you could actually feel the electrical static
(ionization)
in the air.</b>

<p><b>By: dreamocalyptica_@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>When I was about eight years old I experienced something that
changed
my life. This one night I was just sleeping in my Grandma&#8217;s and
Grandpa&#8217;s
house, it&#8217;s nothing special and nothing ever freaked me out there, but
this time it was different, when I stepped in the room chills came over
me like I don&#8217;t know what and I felt really weird. When I had a fun day
with my Grandma and Grandpa I went to sleep and my Grandpa tucked me
in,
I was happy at this moment and nothing gave me the chills. It felt like
I only slept two minutes and something or somebody woke me up. I looked
and it scared me much, there was a girl about the age of fourteen or so
standing there with her mouth open and her eyes closed like she was
screaming.
I said nothing standing on the bed and just looked at her, she then
stopped
after a minute or so and looked at me, stretching her hand. I was so
scared
but I had nowhere to go, it was like she wanted me to take her hand or
so, then she started screaming again and I started to scream back like
she did. She then stopped and looked at me with big eyes then she
vanished
into thin air. I fainted or so and then w n I woke up in the morning I
came downstairs and my Grandma looked at me saying that I looked very
pale.
I didn&#8217;t say to her that I saw a girl, but I did asked her if she heard
anything weird the night, I screamed and so I should&#8217;ve woken up my
Grandma
and Grandpa, because I can scream, very loud. But my when I told them I
screamed very loud my Grandma and Grandpa just looked at me strange and
said they didn&#8217;t hear anything.</b>
<br>
<b>More things started to happen after that, I was constant haunted
by dreams of people dying just out of nowhere, and it was all in
English,
When I was eleven my mom died and I know my mom&#8217;s ghost is somewhere in
the house. Now this year, I keep on having weirder interactions with
the
supernatural or so. This one time I came out of school and I saw a very
old man he looked like he was from the 50&#8217;s or so, a really nice suit
on
and a hat and he stood in front of my school, looking up. I frowned and
stood beside him, he smiled at me, and I just looked at him, then I
walked
away, then I looked behind me, seeing the man going away around the
corner,
I chased him and then when I came into a street that was empty he was
nowhere
to see.</b>
<br>
<b>Also in my house I have weird things, when I walk around the house
sometimes I get chills out of nowhere and sometimes it feels like time
stopped for a second when I walk somewhere, it&#8217;s like I walked through
a ghost, it&#8217;s like time stops for a second and then puts you back into
this. But that&#8217;s not all what&#8217;s happening in my house, when I sleep in
my bed and wake up, mysterious scratches over my back are for all to
see,
but I don&#8217;t cut myself there and I don&#8217;t wear any jewellery in bed, so
how can I get those scratches? I also bit my nails so I can&#8217;t scratch
my
self.</b>
<br>
<b>Some other examples that happened to me, I had a fight with my dad,
when I opened the door&nbsp; to throw away the garbage on the door knob
was a package of tissue&#8217;s those small ones you know, bound to the
doorknob.
When I search for something in the right place and then look for it
somewhere
else where I don&#8217;t find it, I want to search it again, and then find it
lying where you can just meet it when you walk into your room, like
somebody
is helping me with searching it.</b>
<br>
<b>I also have weird encounters with gargoyles, you know those statues,
when I walk to school, I always see some, on houses you know, but those
are statues, but you know, statues normally don&#8217;t wink</b>
<br>
<b>But experiencing this doesn&#8217;t make me feel scared or something,
it always makes me smile, it&#8217;s like I somehow know something about the
world that many people haven&#8217;t been showed trough, it doesn&#8217;t make me
feel
special, but it just takes a closer step to knowing and not knowing.
After
the incident with my Grandma&#8217;s house and the death of my mom, I&#8217;ve
become
very interested in the supernatural and such, but you never know when
you&#8217;ve
gone way too far.</b>
<br>
<b>But I can go on for a while with sightings and weird stuff that
happened to me.</b>

<p><b>Unexplainable Happenings</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: ranae4u@hotmail.com</b>
<br>
<b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p>
<p><b>Let me start off by saying this that nothing like this has
personally
happened to me until now. We just recently moved into a house that
possibly
could be haunted. It is the month of September 2004. We were living in
a 3 bedroom 1 bath apartment and with a family of 5 and 4 of them being
girls we knew it was time for something bigger. The population in this
small town is about 1200 people so rental property is hard to find and
when you do find it you better jump at it as soon as possible or you
lose
out on it. The house that we found is a 3 bedroom 2 bath house with a
large
living room, a large kitchen, a pretty good size laundry room and it
has
a 2 car attached garage and a cellar in the back yard which is good
being
that we live in Oklahoma and the weather is the way it is here, LOL.
Well
before actually moving in my oldest daughter who is 18 wanted to paint
her bedroom before she moved in, so she was up there late one night and
when she came back to the apartment she said Mom there is some weird
stuff
going on in that house, and i said what do you mean she said well i
kept
hearing doors open and close but when i went to check i found nothing
out
of the ordinary, well i brushed it off as being that the house was just
an old house and the fact that maybe she got to thinking about her
being
there alone and thought she was hearing these things happen. The next
day
we started moving in and all was well for a few days and then i got to
noticing things not being where i had left them. (just odd and ends
things
being moved.) I also at times could smell something like rotten eggs
usually
at the end of the kitchen going into the laundry room but the smell
wasn't
there all the time. I have had on many occasions had my daughters tell
me different times that they felt like someone was watching them and i
had never said anything to them but i have had the same feelings about
being watched also. I'll start off by saying what really freaked me out
and till this day i still don't know how to really explain it. Well one
morning i got the kids off to school and i was getting ready to take my
shower but let me say this before i go further i usually leave the door
to the bathroom open when my little dog is on her leash out side so i
can
hear the phone if it rings but when she is in the house i always close
it because i don't like her coming into the bathroom while i'm taking
my
shower. This paticular morning she was in the house so i closed the
door
to the bathroom i wasn't in the shower maybe 5 minutes and i hear the
loudest
noise outside the bathroom door, i set there for a moment then i heard
the door nob shake very hard the next thing i knew the door swang open
and then closed faster than i could think. I jumped out of the shower
and
while i was doing this i could hear whatever or whoever it was walk
away
from the door down through the kitchen into the laundry room and the
reason
i say i could hear it is because this house has old hard wood floors
and
when someone walks on them you can hear it and i actually heard when
they
got to the laundry room the door opened and then it closed back. When i
got out i checked everything and i found nothing out of the ordinary,
but
what is really weird is that my little dog was still in the same spot
she
was in when i went to take my shower, it was like she heard none of
this
going on and everyone that knows my little dog knows she will bark at
the
sound of wind. (LOL) Well that freaked me out so i called my husband at
work and told him what had just happened and of course he just laughed
at me, then while i was talking to him i came back around to the
kitchen
and when i did it was like i seen something swish real fast from the
kitchen
into the bedroom and when this happened my phone went completely dead.
I finally called him back and told him what else had just happened and
he laughed again and said i'm sure there is an explanation for it. I
honestly
thought i was just going crazy. Then there was a time that my 15 year
old
daughter had a friend over and they were getting ready for the big fair
that we have every year we had already left and they were still getting
ready and they said that they heard someone come in the house they
heard
the door slam and heard someone walk across the living room floor but
when
they got into the living room they found no one there. They met up with
us at the fair and asked if we had come back to the house for anything
and we said no and thats when they told us that someone had come into
the
house. Then there was a time that the kids had went to school and i
hadn't
been feeling to well so i slept in that day and i felt like someone was
pushing on me telling me to wake up so when i came to i just brushed it
off as to me dreaming i laid there for alittle bit thinking that i
would
get up in a few minutes and i don't no if i fell back to sleep or what
but i remember this tall guy came from my daughters bedroom into mine
and
when he seen me there he said Oh Mam i didn't know you where in here
and
he said pardon me and he turned around and walked right back out. When
my daughters got home from school i was telling them about it but
didn't
realize my little one was in the room when i was telling them and
needless
to say she heard me and she said oh mom that old man won't hurt you he
is a nice old man. (I FREAKED AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.) I finally
asked
her to explain to me what this man looked like and she explained him
down
to a T what this man looked like in my dream or i thought was a dream.
(What do you think.) Then there was a day i had an appointment at the
beauty
salon to get my nails done and i have a habit of making sure that all
the
doors are locked before i leave i don't know why because this is such
small
town and everyone knows everyone but it has always just been a habit
with
me. When i came back from the salon i came into the house it was about
10 minutes till 12(Noon) and i came in and the frigerator door and
freezer
door was standing wide open and there was ice from my ice maker all
over
the kitchen floor. I new it was weird for the doors to be wide open but
i thought maybe the reason the ice was all over the floor is because
maybe
my ice maker was full and since the door was open it was shooting it
out
of the tray. (NOPE) it was only half full, then i noticed the back door
was unlocked (not opened just unlocked) and it was locked when i left
but
the screen door was still locked so i new that it wasn't an intruder.
Then
there was a sunday morning i got up to take my shower i opened the
shower
curtain and found the tub to be half full of water but the water that
was
in there was not your typical bath water it was like someone had put
something
in there that was really dirty and cleaned it off. I called my husband
again at work (thank god he has a cell phone or he would of already
gotten
fired because of me LOL.) he said he never went into that bathroom
before
going to work and so when the girls go up i asked them about it also
and
they didn't have a clue how it got there either. My oldest daughters
bedroom
is right next to that bedroom and she said she heard nothing the night
before. I have one more thing to tell before i go I was having trouble
with the washing machine one day and my husband said when he got home
he
would look at it and with a family of 5 i do laundry quite often so i
really
needed it fixed. He came home started messing with it and at the time
my
oldest daughter, my husband and i were the only ones home that night
for
supper so i decided to send my daughter up to the grill to get dinner
for
the evening because i didn't want to cook anyway. She left and was gone
about 10 minutes or so we heard the door slam and heard who we thought
was our daughter coming back from the grill and when we both heard this
we looked at each other and said lets go eat and then we will work on
the
washer when we get done eating. We went into the living room and found
no one there. I looked out the front door and seen my daughter driving
down the road and pulling into the drive and when she got up to the
porch
i asked her if she had come and then left again for some reason and she
said no i am just now getting back. I was so glad that my husband was
there
when that happened because he finally had something happen to him too
that
he could not explain and he still doesn't know who it was that night
and
we still don't know who it was that evening that came in the house when
my daughter and her friend was getting ready for the fair. But i can
say
that whatever or whoever it is apparently doesn't want to hurt us.
Thanks

</p>
<p><b>By: pixxyape98@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>The Huron Mountain Club is located in BigBay, Its an Appartment
complax
split into thirds where one part would be for waiters, hosts, ect,
where
they would sleep and live,the second part was the egsact same but for
men,than
the third part was for tourists and customers to come and eat at the
family
restaurant. My sister was a waitress who worked there for 1 year,
During
the time she worked there, she heard plenty of stories about ghosts
walking
through the halls or things moving on there own, she was always a
beleiver
but never thought that it would happen to her. One night she decided to
sleep in her boyfriends dorm, although she wasn't alowed, everyone did
it all the time. Anyways, She was sleeping and than when she turned
over
at 4:00 in the morning she had a sence to open her eyes and&nbsp; there
stood a teenage boy about 17 looking at her with a blank face, pale
with
a tint of blue, wearing blue jeans,a blue shirt, blue eyes, than blonde
hair. He just stood there about 5 feet away from her, stareing. She
emedietly
got scared and turned over hopeing he would be gone when she looked
back,
instead, everytime she took a glance back, he would appear closer, and
closer, she tried to wake up her boyfriend but he didn't. She turned
over
once again and pulled the covers over her h d, made herself fall
asleep,
than when she got up, nothing was there. She never saw the boy again.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;My First Encounter with a Ghost</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: gw_nva@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>Me and a friend were walking to a graveyard one night. It was
about
9:30pm. I saw a sign by the grave yard and i wanted t make sure that i
would not be breaking any laws by sneaking into the graveyard at night.
Next to the graveyard there is a girlscout campsight. We had to walk
past
that to get to the graveyard. As we were walking back from checking
what
that sign said, something made me look into the woods. When I did I
remember
seeing a pair of legs walking in the shadows. Of course I started
walking
faster and then ended up running back to my car. After we left I asked
my friend if he saw anything. He told me he saw a shadow in the same
area
i saw the legs. Later in the night we both agreed after just leaving
the
sight, i felt as if somebody was sitting in my lap. We both felt
something
messing with our hair and touching our arms and legs. The story still
freaks
me out when i talk about it.</b>

<b>Kingsport, TN haunted house</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ba.sanders@charter.net</b>
<br>
<b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Angela Sanders. I grew up in a haunted house on
Patton Street.&nbsp; My family moved there when I was three years
old.&nbsp;
The first night there I had a horrible nightmare that woke my mom and
dad
up.&nbsp; Things always seemed to be happening to me and me only.&nbsp;
When I would turn out my lights and go to bed, as soon as I would lay
down
I would hear a scooting sound in the floor on the carpet. I would
either
scream for my mom or run to the light switch myself.&nbsp; Either way
we
never saw anything and the sound would stop as soon as she
entered.&nbsp;
When my dad worked the graveyard shift, our power would always go off
right
after mom put me in the bathtub. This would happen several times
throughout
my years there.&nbsp; Our toilet would flush by itself&nbsp; but only
in
the middle of the night and brand new batteries would go dead
mysteriously.&nbsp;
Throughout all of this my parents would always have an
"explanation".&nbsp;
I was always frustrated that they couldn't see what was happening. One
day my brother and sister were gone riding bikes and my mom and dad
were
outside mowing and weedeating. I was inside alone watching TV and I got
up and walked down the hall to the bathroom.&nbsp; When I got in
front&nbsp;
of my bedroom I looked inside and my waterbed was moving wildly like
someone
just jumped on it.&nbsp; I ran outside to get my mom.&nbsp; I was
terrified.&nbsp;
A few days later, while all of us kids were at school and dad was at
work,
mom was washing dishes and something grabed her shoulder.&nbsp; She
said
no one was there.&nbsp; She finally changed her opinion and soon my dad
would too.&nbsp; One Sunday he was asleep in his room after working
graveyard,&nbsp;
and everyone else was gone to church.&nbsp; He heard the front door
open
and close, and he wondered why we were home so soon.&nbsp; He then
heard
someone coming down the hall to the bedroom and he suddenly felt
afraid.&nbsp;
He didn't move or make a sound and then it came into the bedroom.&nbsp;
He said he didn't dare open his eyes when suddenly something slapped
his
face. He sprang up off the bed and no one was there.&nbsp; One night
while
my mom and dad were sleeping, their atrium doors to their bedroom burst
open for no reason. I never actually saw a spirit or ghost but I did
see
its evidence.&nbsp; I was home alone early one morning and heard a
rattling
sound.&nbsp; I went in search of&nbsp; it and found the door to the
basement
shaking and the knob turning rapidly back and forth.&nbsp; I left
immediately
and never allowed myself to be alone in the house again.&nbsp; By the
way,&nbsp;
I had my boyfriend to check the basement and there was no one there and
the only way in was to break a window.&nbsp; All&nbsp; of the window s
were intact. I've never been able to get any history on the house. I
did
find out that before we moved in the house was empty a long time and
the
neighborhood kids were afraid of it.&nbsp; We left it in '94 and I have
never experienced anything like that since.&nbsp; Thanks for reading my
story.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Building</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: Wreckmobile@aol.com</b>
<br>

</p>
<p><b>i am a 15 yr old boy who looks 17 but owel. I go and help my dad
clean since there is alot to do plus i get payed for it. But the
building
that my dad cleans, (not giving name to it since conifedental). Its a 7
storie building and its kinda old with alot of history behind it,
anyways
wel its haunted, The real people who work there on a 8 hr day dosent
believe
us. The most active floor is the second floor. You can see doors shut,
hear cupboards close, feel cold presences, feel like something is
staring
at u. If your on the first floor which i clean and sometimes im there
late
til like 8 oclock in the dark killin time u can hear pounding noises,
chairs
moving from the floor above, sometimes see stuff just depends. I have
had
some of these experiences, it dosent really bother me cause its there
place
first and were just here taking care of it. Also on the 4th floor there
was a night light that someone put in the hall, well my dad was waiting
on the elevator in the dark and this light thing was like 45 ft away
and
it started goin off by itself with no one there. Then someone said that
they seen a woman on that floor. At least i dont need a fake haunted
building
to go to i got one right there.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghosts By My Window</b><b></b>
</p>
<p><b>By: Karen3690@aol.com</b>
<br>
<b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p>
<p><b>When i was younger about 7 or 8 i once woke up and saw two men by
my window. i lived in a house with an upstairs and downstairs. im 13
now
and i moved out of it about 1 month ago to move to the u.s.a. the house
was in north england. the two men frightened me even though they were
just
waving. I screamed and remember waking up my mum and dad it took them
about
2 minites to get up.they probally came cause its never happened to me
before.or
maybe cause i was only 7. It happened at around half 9 in the mornin .
they came with me to my room but there was nothing there. They told me
that it could of been a dream but i know it could not of been one
because
im not like that. i know when im dreaming. the two men looked a bit
like
window cleaners they weren't holding anything in there hands&nbsp; they
was just waving. they had blue or possibly purple uniform on (i can't
really
tell cause im a little color blind) after that i have always thought
about
what i saw. they weren't see through they loooked like real people.
i've
always believed in ghosts and U.F.O's&nbsp; for some reason i sometimes
believe im being watched. When i&nbsp; went to the bathroom in that
house
i always felt cold all over. it wasn't even a old house it was built in
1995 august time. when i go to my grandma's house in Manchester i go to
there bathroom and im exacly breathing out cold air and shivering.
thats
when i feel im being watched. when i was in england i always used to
watch
most haunted where you need to be 15. That scares me they go around
haunted
houses. but when im watching it i never feel like somethings watching
me
anymore.</b>
