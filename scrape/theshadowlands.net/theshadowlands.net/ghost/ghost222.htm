<P><B>OUR HAUNTED HOUSE</B>

<P><B>By: sueknauff@eriecoast.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I was recently remarried, with two children from a previous
marriage.&nbsp; My new husband and I purchased a 100 year old home in a
small railroad town that seemed at the time to be suspended in time.&nbsp;
The house was a colonial.&nbsp; There was an upstairs, middle floor and
then a basement level.&nbsp; We found out that home was for sale because
of the fact that the man who owned it had committed suicide.&nbsp; He hadn't
done it in the home, but in an apartment down the street.&nbsp; This is
how the history of the house goes. The last family owned the home for over
20 years.&nbsp; The couple constantly argued.&nbsp; He drank too much and
she spent too much.&nbsp; They raised a boy and a girl in the house.&nbsp;
The boy was on drugs and the girl had an eating disorder.&nbsp; In fact
our front door was broken down once by the fire department because the
teenage girl had fainted after calling 911.&nbsp; It was a family in turmoil.&nbsp;
Finally the man and woman divorced.&nbsp; The man moving down the street
into an apartment building and the woman staying in the home.&nbsp; Eventually
she remarried and moved her new husband into the home.&nbsp; They finally
moved away and left the home in the care of their son and daughter.&nbsp;
One night after a drinking binge and being stopped by the cops, the man
who owned the home, took a walk through it and then went to his apartment
and shot himself.&nbsp; We heard numerous stories to this account from
neighbors and friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after moving in my husband was
involved in a car accident.&nbsp; A woman who lived in town and who also
worked with him came to visit him after he arrived home from the hospital.&nbsp;
She stopped in our doorway, and said, "THIS is where you live???&nbsp;
Do you know the turmoil that went on in this house?"&nbsp; She refused
to stay and visit.&nbsp; She said she couldn't breathe here.&nbsp; She
said she knew the woman who lived in the house and that the man had beaten
her in the front yard many times and chased her down our street naked.&nbsp;
She immediately left.</B>
<BR><B>One week after moving in, I was settling down in bed.&nbsp; My son
was asleep in the upstairs bedroom that was next to mine.&nbsp; He was
6 years old and in the first grade.&nbsp; My daughter was 10 and she was
asleep in the bedroom on the first floor that was off of our living room.&nbsp;
My husband was working 2nd shift and didn't get home until 2:30 in the
morning.&nbsp; We had no pets.&nbsp; I felt uneasy in the house and chalked
it up to the fact that it was a strange and unfamiliar place.&nbsp; I was
reading in bed about 11:30 pm when I felt the end of the bed dip down as
though someone had sat on it.&nbsp; I put the book down and sat up and
saw no one there.&nbsp; This happened numerous times, night after night
in that bedroom.&nbsp; I never saw anyone.</B>
<BR><B>One weekend my husband and I went to bed together.&nbsp; Just as
we settled into bed, the bed dipped down on my side.&nbsp; I sat up and
said, "Did you feel that?&nbsp; The bed just dipped like someone sat on
it."&nbsp; He thought I was being silly.&nbsp; He never felt it.</B>
<BR><B>Another night about midnight, I heard my son rustling through his
school papers.&nbsp; I wondered what he was doing at that time of the night.&nbsp;
I yelled, "Go to sleep honey, it's not time to get up!"&nbsp; He didn't
answer.&nbsp; I got up and walked into his room, which was dark.&nbsp;
The window was closed and there were no papers anywhere to be seen.</B>
<BR><B>Another night I woke up at 4:00 am to hear my daughter in her bedroom
below ours on the first floor.&nbsp; She was going through her closet,
as I could distinctly hear her coat hangers sliding back and forth in her
closet.&nbsp; I assumed she thought it was time to get ready for school
and I was giggling that she was mixed up.&nbsp; I went downstairs and into
her room to tell her it was too early, only to find her asleep in her bed,
the light off and her closet door closed.&nbsp; I ripped open the closet
door, only to find nothing.&nbsp; Not even a coat hanger swinging.</B>
<BR><B>Once my husband and I were asleep and we kept our bedroom door closed.&nbsp;
There was a loud knock on our bedroom door.&nbsp; It was a series of 3
knocks.&nbsp; I yelled, "Come on in," thinking that it was one of the kids.&nbsp;
No answer.&nbsp; The door didn't open.&nbsp; I got up and opened the door
and there was no one there.&nbsp; This has happened several different times
over the last 8 years of living here.</B>
<BR><B>One afternoon shortly after moving in, my husband and I were grilling
on the back patio.&nbsp; We were deep in conversation when we both saw
out the corner of our eyes, a black shadow come down the back door steps.&nbsp;
I just thought maybe a lost dog or something.&nbsp; We finished talking
and I couldn't stop wondering what it was.&nbsp; I walked over to the steps
and looked and looked in front of the garage where it went.&nbsp; Nothing
to be seen.&nbsp; My husband saw the look on my face and asked me if I
saw that too.&nbsp; I said, "Yes!&nbsp; Did you?"&nbsp; He said yes.&nbsp;
Only later did he admit that it was the form of a human and not that of
a dog, as I thought.</B>
<BR><B>One night we were all asleep and I was facing my husbands back in
bed.&nbsp; I turned over to the open side of the bed.&nbsp; I saw as I
turned over the black shadow of a man leaning over me.&nbsp; He had curly
hair and was staring into my face.&nbsp; It was too dark for me to make
out any features but I felt that he was curious about me and also glaring
angrily at me.&nbsp; I took a quick startled intake of breath and as I
did, he seemed just as startled that I saw him.&nbsp; He quickly backed
up from me and flew backwards into the closet (which was closed) and was
gone.&nbsp; I realized that his form got smaller as it backed away from
me.&nbsp; I was up with the light on crying and telling my husband what
I saw.&nbsp; He didn't believe me.&nbsp; He said it was a shadow probably
of my own hair or something.</B>
<BR><B>My son came to me one morning.&nbsp; He was about 8 years old now.&nbsp;
He began to tell me that something pulled the blankets off of him last
night.&nbsp; I said, "no, it was probably the cat."&nbsp; (By this time
we had a cat.)&nbsp; He said no, that the cat was shut up in the basement.&nbsp;
He said he had just gone to bed and was pulling his blankets up around
his face when they were being tugged away from him.&nbsp; He looked down
at the floor and could see the blankets being pulled.&nbsp; He says it
was almost as though you could see the finger marks in the material, where
the fingers should have been but weren't.&nbsp; He tried to call me and
was so scared that the word, Mom, would not come out.&nbsp; He said he
didn't sleep all night.&nbsp; I still tried to rationalize it away.&nbsp;
Maybe a dream.&nbsp; He said no.</B>
<BR><B>One night I got up to go the downstairs restroom.&nbsp; I got a
drink of water and hurried back to bed.&nbsp; I was just pulling my blankets
up around me.&nbsp; I got into bed and turned my back to my husbands back.&nbsp;
Instantly the blankets were yanked off of us and pulled under the bed.&nbsp;
It was a hard, "human" tug.&nbsp; Not one that a cat could do.&nbsp; My
husband stirred in his sleep and tried to pull the blankets back and they
were still being tugged.&nbsp; He turned over and looked at me when the
blankets were released and said, "What are you doing?!"&nbsp; I said I
didn't do that.&nbsp; I jumped up and turned the light on.&nbsp; The cat
wasn't in our room or under the bed.&nbsp; Our bedroom door was closed.&nbsp;
It was just as my son had explained.</B>
<BR><B>My husband Mark and I soon had a child of our own.&nbsp; We put
her crib in our bedroom with us.&nbsp; Often her pacifiers would come up
missing.&nbsp; I just assumed they'd fallen in to the couch or something
similar.&nbsp; I was constantly purchasing pacifiers.&nbsp; One day I'd
had enough, and tipped the couch over and vacuumed in it and under it.&nbsp;
Not one pacifier was found.&nbsp; I then began to wonder what was happening
to them.&nbsp; One night we were down to one pacifier left.&nbsp; I prayed
that this one didn't come up missing.&nbsp; In the middle of the night
our daughter cried and I switched on the light.&nbsp; I removed all of
her blankets and there was no pacifier.&nbsp; My husband got up and we
even took her mattress out of her crib and turned it over and looked under
the bed.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; The bedroom had been recently newly carpeted
and was not cluttered in any way.&nbsp; There was just no pacifier in that
room.&nbsp; I was so frustrated and went downstairs to search in a kitchen
drawer for one.&nbsp; I stopped and looked up and yelled loudly...."OK!&nbsp;
I've had enough!&nbsp; Put it back!"....&nbsp; to whatever unseen force
was in our home.&nbsp; My husband called down to me in a strange voice.&nbsp;
"Sue, come here!"&nbsp; I walked upstairs thinking, no way.&nbsp; He had
it in his hand and looked at me strangely and said when he heard me say
that, he turned around and there it was, right in the middle of the floor,
where moments before we had checked.</B>
<BR><B>One of the strangest incidents that we have experienced was when
the phone rang in the middle of the night.&nbsp; My husband ran downstairs
to answer it thinking something was wrong with a family member.&nbsp; I
sat up in bed listening to his conversation on the phone at the bottom
of the stairs.&nbsp; The house was very quiet and I could hear the woman
on the other end of the phone.&nbsp; Mark said, "No, I'm sorry, she's in
the bed already.&nbsp; Can I take a message?"&nbsp; I heard a woman screaming
on the other end, all the way up the stairs.&nbsp; Mark remained quiet
and then I heard him quietly put the phone back on the base.&nbsp; He slowly
walked up the steps and sat on the end of our bed, scratching his head.&nbsp;
I said, "Who was that?&nbsp; What did she want?"&nbsp; He said it was the
strangest thing.&nbsp; The woman on the other end of the phone knew his
name and my name and asked for me.&nbsp; When he told her I was in bed,
the woman lost it.&nbsp; She began hatefully screaming at him that it was
her house and she would come over here if she had to.&nbsp; She said I
was her daughter.&nbsp; Wrong number?&nbsp; We didn't know, but how strange
that it frightened us the way that it did and that the woman had gotten
a house with people with the same names in it.&nbsp; I often wondered if
it was a call from the other side.</B>
<BR><B>One Saturday afternoon I was in the bathroom on the first floor.&nbsp;
I heard the back door open and someone come inside.&nbsp; I heard the footsteps
going to the base of our stairs.&nbsp; I then heard a girl call up the
stairs, "Rachel, are you up there?"&nbsp; Rachel is my oldest daughter.&nbsp;
I heard no response from my daughter but I knew she was up there.&nbsp;
Finally I heard the person walk up the stairs.&nbsp; I finished up and
went outside and found my husband sitting on the back steps of the door
that had just opened to our guest.&nbsp; I asked him who had come over
to visit with Rachel.&nbsp; He said no one.&nbsp; He said he was sitting
there the whole time.&nbsp; I told him no I heard the door open and finished
telling him the story.&nbsp; We walked inside and I called up to Rachel
who responded.&nbsp; I said, "Who is up there with you?"&nbsp; She said
"No one."&nbsp; I walked up to her room and there was no one there.&nbsp;
When I told her the story she looked as scared as I was.</B>
<BR><B>One evening while laying in bed reading, my husband and I had an
argument.&nbsp; He stormed out of the room and I went back to reading my
book.&nbsp; I heard his footsteps bounding the stairs angrily.&nbsp; Then
I heard him throw a book up the stairs!&nbsp; I could hear the pages twirling
in the wind as it flew up the steps and hit the wall at the landing on
top.&nbsp; I couldn't believe him!&nbsp; He came angrily back up the steps
and stepped into our bedroom.&nbsp; He stood there with his hands on his
hips.&nbsp; He looked at me and yelled, "HOW DARE YOU THROW THAT BOOK!"&nbsp;
I said, "I didn't throw the book!"&nbsp; I showed him it was still in my
hand.&nbsp; He just looked at me puzzled.&nbsp; I said I thought he threw
the book.&nbsp; We got up and looked and there was no book on the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, our daughter was about 2 years old and we put my oldest
daughter in the bedroom that used to be my husbands and mine.&nbsp; They
could share that room and my husband and I took the basement and turned
that in to our bedroom.&nbsp; We had a baby monitor so we could always
hear the baby upstairs.&nbsp; My oldest daughter has had the same knocks
on her door in the middle of the night.&nbsp; She also had an angel that
stood on her headboard and every morning that she woke up, the angel would
be turned around to face the wall.</B>
<BR><B>When our little one was 4 years old, she was playing outside in
the back yard one morning.&nbsp; She came in and said, “Rachel where are
you?”&nbsp; She was laughing.&nbsp; I said, “Honey, Rachel isn’t here.&nbsp;
What do you need?”&nbsp; She said, “Then who is calling me?&nbsp; Yes,
she’s here.&nbsp; I just heard her calling my name!”&nbsp; I said, “No,
sweetie, she isn’t.”&nbsp; She sat down on the kitchen floor and began
to cry.&nbsp; I picked her up and said that it was ok.&nbsp; She said that
someone was calling her name and playing hide and go seek with her.&nbsp;
I went outside and no one was home.&nbsp; Not even a neighbor around.</B>
<BR><B>One evening as I was tucking her into bed she looked at me strangely.&nbsp;
She said, "Mommy when you check on me tonight, will you wear the same nightgown
that you wore last night?"&nbsp; I said "Which nightgown?&nbsp; What color
was it?"&nbsp; She said it was one she'd never seen before.&nbsp; She described
it to me and it was nothing like anything I owned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
night afterward, she said to me, "Was that you in my room last night?"&nbsp;
I said, "What did you see?"&nbsp; She said she saw a woman that was kind
of like me but not me standing in front of her TV and pointing to the TV
with a gun in her hand.&nbsp; I was frightened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still
assumed it must have been a dream.&nbsp; Then my oldest daughter had a
story to tell.&nbsp; One morning my little one woke up screaming and terrified.&nbsp;
It was 5 am and I went up to check on her and she was shaking and asking
me to put her on the couch downstairs.&nbsp; I did, turning off the bedroom
light as I left the room.&nbsp; Soon we feel back asleep.&nbsp; When my
oldest daughter woke up she said, "Mom I saw her!"&nbsp; She said, "you
know how you turned off the light when you left our room?&nbsp; I went
back to sleep for a while and then I woke up and turned over.&nbsp; There
she was."&nbsp; She said she was standing in the middle of the room and
looking from her bed to my youngest daughters bed, almost as though she
was wondering where the little one went.&nbsp; She said she was then just
staring at her.&nbsp; My daughter said, "Mom she looks like you!"&nbsp;
She described her.&nbsp; She wearing an old-fashioned nightgown with cuffs
and having features a lot like me, only longer hair that was turned under.&nbsp;
When my daughter became frightened and gasped, the woman disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>I still do not sleep well at night and we have been here for 8 years
now.&nbsp; I don't know what the black shadow was that we saw.&nbsp; I
don't know whom the man was that I saw.&nbsp; I don't know whom the woman
is that my daughters have seen.&nbsp; Is it the activity of the last family
and the man who killed himself?&nbsp; Or is it someone from way back, since
the house is over 100 years old.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Things don't
happen as often as before, but we know we are not alone.&nbsp; I constantly
recite The Lords Prayer in my head at night before bed and ask that He
keep us from evil.</B>

<P><B>A Believer Now</B>

<P><B>By: billy.e.mcguire@boeing.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>&nbsp;I came across your web site and started reading some of the
stories of others</B>
<BR><B>and their experiences with ghosts and I felt the need to should
share my story.</B>
<BR><B>Now let me say up front that I have never had any prior occurrences
with ghosts</B>
<BR><B>and really didn't believe in ghosts or the after-life, but that
has totally</B>
<BR><B>changed since this has happened to me first hand. It was about a
year ago that</B>
<BR><B>my daughter and son-in-law were in the process of buying their first
home. It</B>
<BR><B>was a nice little two bedroom brick home on a corner lot. An elderly
couple had</B>
<BR><B>owned it previously and the wife was selling it because her husband
had passed</B>
<BR><B>away 6 months earlier and she was going to move to Arkansas to be
closer to her</B>
<BR><B>son and his family. Well things were progressing smoothly with the
buying</B>
<BR><B>process and they were within days of closing on the house. They
had gotten</B>
<BR><B>permission to start moving their possessions into the house since
they had been</B>
<BR><B>approved and they had to be out of their apartment before the first
of the</B>
<BR><B>month. Several times while moving their stuff, my daughter said
that she had an</B>
<BR><B>uncomfortable feeling while being in the house. I asked her what
she meant and</B>
<BR><B>she said that she felt that like they were being watched. But she
just chalked</B>
<BR><B>it up to being tired and to the stress of having to move and keep
track of my</B>
<BR><B>little 2 year old grandson. On the evening of my experience, my
wife and I had</B>
<BR><B>just gone to bed when our doorbell rang and there stood my daughter,
grandson</B>
<BR><B>and son-in-law. My daughter was crying, shaking and was white as
a sheet, in</B>
<BR><B>other word she was scared out of her wits. My son-in-law was in
a little better</B>
<BR><B>shape, but was pretty rattled himself. After getting her settled
down the only</B>
<BR><B>thing I could get out of her was that there was no way they were
going back into</B>
<BR><B>that house. I asked my son-in-law what happened and he said that
my daughter had</B>
<BR><B>been cleaning the kitchen cabinets and had finished putting down
contact paper</B>
<BR><B>on the shelves, she then polished the doors on the cabinets and
closed them up.</B>
<BR><B>They finished putting a load of furniture into the garage and had
closed and</B>
<BR><B>locked the overhead door. They had gotten into their van when they
had noticed</B>
<BR><B>that the light had been left on in the garage, my son-in-law said
he had made</B>
<BR><B>sure that he had turned it off before closing the overhead door.
Well they</B>
<BR><B>didn't have a key to open the garage door from the outside, so they
had to go</B>
<BR><B>back through the house to turn off the light. They went back inside
and turned</B>
<BR><B>on the kitchen light and there were the doors on the kitchen cabinets
standing</B>
<BR><B>wide open and the contact paper ripped off of the shelves and piled
on the</B>
<BR><B>floor. My daughter then felt a hand on her shoulder and a voice
said to both of</B>
<BR><B>them.."GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!" They left immediately and came directly
over to my</B>
<BR><B>house. My son-in-law asked me to go back with him to turn off the
lights and to</B>
<BR><B>close up the house, well being the skeptic that I was at the time,I
said I</B>
<BR><B>would. Well we got into the house and I saw the open kitchen cabinets
and the</B>
<BR><B>contact paper which we cleaned up. We spent the better part of 20
minutes</B>
<BR><B>walking all over the house, but didn't see or hear anything. Still,
all the</B>
<BR><B>while I felt as if someone&nbsp; was watching me. By this time though,
it was late</B>
<BR><B>and I was ready to go back to bed. I reached out to shut off the
kitchen light,</B>
<BR><B>when I felt a cold area around my hand as if another hand was on
mine, I looked</B>
<BR><B>up and was face to face with an old white haired man that was extremely
angry</B>
<BR><B>and had a cane raised as if to strike me over the head. I swung
at him and he</B>
<BR><B>immediately dissapered. I then heard a voice say.."GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY</B>
<BR><B>HOUSE." I didn't have any trouble honoring that request. Needless
to say..the</B>
<BR><B>kids didn't buy the house and when we went back to get their stuff
out of there,</B>
<BR><B>we found out from the next door neighboor that the old man had died
sitting at</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen table.</B>

<BR><B>A Few Ghost Stories...</B>

<P><B>By: catpriestess@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Hello there, I've got a few ghost stories for you.&nbsp; They are
probably quite</B>
<BR><B>a bit boring compared to some of the other stories here, but I hope
they</B>
<BR><B>are enjoyable.</B>
<BR><B>A bit of background on myself.&nbsp; I am now 21 years old, and
suffer from</B>
<BR><B>depression and panic attacks-while that may seem irrelivant, some
one else</B>
<BR><B>who wrote one of the stories on the page suggested that perhaps
depression</B>
<BR><B>and such strengthens our ability to see ghost and other phenomena
that</B>
<BR><B>others may not be able to see, and that made me wonder if perhaps
that's</B>
<BR><B>true.&nbsp; However, I was not going through any major bouts of
depression or</B>
<BR><B>anything when I had any of my encounters.&nbsp; I am also an eclectic
Pagan (I</B>
<BR><B>follow teachings and beliefs from many different anchient</B>
<BR><B>earth-based/worshipping religions-as well as a few others that are
not</B>
<BR><B>earth based-such as pre-Christian Celtic/Norse religions, Native
American</B>
<BR><B>religions, some Buddhist and Hindu beliefs, etc.), and am interested
in</B>
<BR><B>some "occult"-type things.&nbsp; No, I do not worship the devil
(nor do I</B>
<BR><B>believe that there is any purely evil or purely good deity-I believe
they</B>
<BR><B>are very much like human beings, with a bit of each in their personalities)</B>
<BR><B>or perform any type of sacrifices (human, animal, or whatever you
can think</B>
<BR><B>of).&nbsp; I am quite psychic and empathic, but as far as I know,
this does not</B>
<BR><B>run in my family.&nbsp; All of this has led to other "paranormal"
experiences,</B>
<BR><B>but that is totally unrelated.&nbsp; I have played around with Ouija
boards when</B>
<BR><B>I was younger, but never had anything happen (besides having my
friends</B>
<BR><B>spelling things and trying to make the rest of us believe it really
was a</B>
<BR><B>spirit)-I don't believe that the board itself will summon anything.&nbsp;
I also</B>
<BR><B>don't like going to grave yards unless I am actually paying my respect
to</B>
<BR><B>some one there-I don't believe the spirits of those who are waiting
to be</B>
<BR><B>reincarnated (yes, I believe in that as well) like to be disturbed.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>believe "ghosts" are the spirits of those who have either not had
a chance</B>
<BR><B>to be reincarnated yet, or have refused for some reason or another.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, now for my stories.</B>
<BR><B>The first that I remember was when I was (I believe) about 5 or
6 years</B>
<BR><B>old.&nbsp; We were living in a once farm house in Michigan, I think
it was about</B>
<BR><B>50 years old when we lived there.&nbsp; I was sleeping one night,
when I woke up</B>
<BR><B>in the middle of the night and could hear shuffling footsteps on
the</B>
<BR><B>carpet.&nbsp; At first I thought it was my younger brother coming
in to sleep in</B>
<BR><B>my room (he often did that when he was young), so I told him to
go away and</B>
<BR><B>sleep in his own room.&nbsp; The footsteps stopped for a moment,
then started up</B>
<BR><B>again.&nbsp; I got a little angry, and turned to look at my doorway
to yell at</B>
<BR><B>him.&nbsp; There was no one there, nor was there anyone anywhere
in my room (the</B>
<BR><B>steps had also stopped).&nbsp; I got scared and hid under my blankets.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>steps started again, and I was too terrified to do anything.&nbsp;
It's been so</B>
<BR><B>long, I don't recall if they ever came closer to me, or just stayed
along</B>
<BR><B>the sides of my room.&nbsp; But I eventually got up the courage
to say "Mom."</B>
<BR><B>Then I heard a (if I remember correctly) sort of gravelly woman's
voice say</B>
<BR><B>"I am your mother."&nbsp; Well, that was enough to make me run screaming
to my</B>
<BR><B>parents' room.&nbsp; I never saw or heard from that spirit again.&nbsp;
I accepted</B>
<BR><B>the usual "It was just a nightmare" excuse for many years, and consequently</B>
<BR><B>have forgotten a lot of the details.&nbsp; But when I thought back
on it when I</B>
<BR><B>was older, I wonder if maybe it was my grandmother (mom's mom)?&nbsp;
She died</B>
<BR><B>before I was ever born, and never even got to see my parents married.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>died due to complications from lung cancer-she was a heavy smoker
for 20+</B>
<BR><B>years.&nbsp; And I have been told many times that when I was a child
(and</B>
<BR><B>really, even now, without my hair dyed), I looked very much like
my mother</B>
<BR><B>at that age.</B>
<BR><B>This next story also takes place in the same house in Michigan.&nbsp;
Whether or</B>
<BR><B>not it is related to the first story, I am not sure.&nbsp; It doesn't
exactly</B>
<BR><B>deal with ghosts, either, but rather a recurring dream I used to
have every</B>
<BR><B>few months while living in that house.&nbsp; I never had the dreams
before we</B>
<BR><B>moved to the house, or after we moved out of that house.&nbsp; The
first dream I</B>
<BR><B>ever had like this started out with my parents going to look at
the house</B>
<BR><B>for the first time before we bought it (although, in reality, we
had lived</B>
<BR><B>there for about 6 months or so).&nbsp; It was night time, and very
dark (no</B>
<BR><B>stars or anything).&nbsp; My parents told me to look at the upstairs
(where my</B>
<BR><B>brother's and my rooms where).&nbsp; Just as I was about to go up
the stairs, I</B>
<BR><B>saw a tiny old woman (probably about 3 ft. tall or so) standing
at the top.</B>
<BR><B>At first, I don't think I was afraid.&nbsp; Then she wanted me to
come up the</B>
<BR><B>stairs to her, and some how I realized she was an "evil witch."&nbsp;
After that</B>
<BR><B>first dream, the others just started with me at the bottom of the
stairs</B>
<BR><B>and she was calling me up, and I would take a few steps and wake
up.&nbsp; After</B>
<BR><B>the first few like this, at some point, as I started up the stairs,
several</B>
<BR><B>small monsters appeared with her.&nbsp; Again, after the first few
steps, I</B>
<BR><B>would wake up.&nbsp; That was as far as the dream ever got.</B>
<BR><B>Those were the only strange occurances that ever happened in that
house,</B>
<BR><B>and I don't believe anyone else ever had any.&nbsp; And besides
those, I loved</B>
<BR><B>that house and was very upset when we had to move.&nbsp; I never
found out if</B>
<BR><B>there was any sort of history on it either.&nbsp; My other stories
all take</B>
<BR><B>place in Wisconsin, where we moved after we left the house in Michigan,</B>
<BR><B>although not at my house.&nbsp; I had a couple friends in high school,
and for a</B>
<BR><B>little while after I graduated, who lived in the same neighborhood-in</B>
<BR><B>between the town where I lived and the city nearby (Madison).&nbsp;
Both these</B>
<BR><B>stories take place in this neighborhood.</B>
<BR><B>There was this sort of large shed that was set back in the woods
in the</B>
<BR><B>corner by one of my friends' houses.&nbsp; Supposedly, it was once
used by a</B>
<BR><B>crazy old man who would lure people (mostly children) there, kill
them, and</B>
<BR><B>bury their bodies nearby.&nbsp; I still don't know if I really believe
the</B>
<BR><B>story, but I always did (even before I had heard the story) feel
really</B>
<BR><B>uncomfortable going by&nbsp; that corner.</B>
<BR><B>After I had graduated and moved into my own apartment in another
town about</B>
<BR><B>45 min. from my friends' neighborhood, one of them (different one
from the</B>
<BR><B>house mentioned above) used to spend most of the weekend at our
apartment</B>
<BR><B>with us.&nbsp; Since I was the only one with a license and car,
I would always</B>
<BR><B>be the one driving him there and back.&nbsp; Usually we'd also pick
up several</B>
<BR><B>of our other friends first and have a car full before you came to
get him.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, on this particular night, it was around 1 or 2 a.m. before
we left</B>
<BR><B>his house.&nbsp; I took a shortcut back to the highway we took to
get home.&nbsp; As</B>
<BR><B>usual, I was driving, and we had a car full of people, and we were
all</B>
<BR><B>talking and laughing and having a ton of fun.&nbsp; I have a habit
of checking</B>
<BR><B>the sides of the road as I drive, just to make sure no one is going
to run</B>
<BR><B>out in front of me.&nbsp; Well, as I was looking over at the side
of the road</B>
<BR><B>out of habit, even though I was pretty sure no one would be out
since it</B>
<BR><B>was so late, I saw a large (muscular, and probably about 6 ft. tall)
man</B>
<BR><B>standing by a fence wearing overalls.&nbsp; I made a comment that
I didn't think</B>
<BR><B>anyone would be out that late.&nbsp; My friends who lived there
told me that</B>
<BR><B>supposedly some time in the 30's or 40's or so, there was a black
man hung</B>
<BR><B>by a bunch of racists (which, believe me, there are plenty here
in</B>
<BR><B>Wisconsin) along that stretch of road, and supposedly it was haunted
by</B>
<BR><B>him.&nbsp; When I looked in my rearveiw mirror, he was gone.&nbsp;
Now, again, I</B>
<BR><B>don't know if that is true or not.&nbsp; I'm not even sure if the
man I saw was</B>
<BR><B>a ghost or not.&nbsp; He was close enough to houses (it's not like
it's a</B>
<BR><B>totally deserted road) that he could have just been some one outside
for</B>
<BR><B>some reason and had just gone back inside (just because it was late
doesn't</B>
<BR><B>mean that no one could have been out).&nbsp; Besides that, it was
dark and there</B>
<BR><B>are no street lights on that road, I had only seen him because of
my</B>
<BR><B>headlights, and there were no other cars on the road.&nbsp; But
I never again</B>
<BR><B>would drive down that road at night.</B>

<BR><B>A Quick Ghost Story</B>

<P><B>By: davidi@ultraquiet.com</B>

<P><B>First of all let me explain, I am from England.</B>
<BR><B>I am a 26 year old male living in Cambridge.</B>
<BR><B>I was born in Yorkshire, North England</B>
<BR><B>Just up the road from where I lived was a place called Oakwell Hall,
located</B>
<BR><B>in an area called Birkenshaw.</B>
<BR><B>Oakwell hall is a fairly small house compared to some in the UK,
but it</B>
<BR><B>certainly has local character.</B>
<BR><B>Many a day away from school would be spent wandering around the
grounds, and</B>
<BR><B>the rooms of the house.</B>
<BR><B>Local legend has it that the hall was once inhabited by a great
local family</B>
<BR><B>named The Batts( hence the local town of Batley) and that once of
the sons</B>
<BR><B>of the family, a womaniser and gambler of no small repute, found
himself in</B>
<BR><B>a duel fought on the local moors.</B>
<BR><B>The servants all new of this and so where relieved the sounds of
his horse</B>
<BR><B>where heard re-entering the stables. They where even more relieved
when the</B>
<BR><B>son was seen walking thru the hall, up the stairs and to his bed
chamber.</B>
<BR><B>They then made a rather spooky discovery when they noticed a bloody</B>
<BR><B>footprint on the staircase. thinking their master injured in the
duel, they</B>
<BR><B>entered his chambers to see if they could help him.</B>
<BR><B>He was not there. The bed had not been disturbed. There was no horse
in the</B>
<BR><B>stable.</B>
<BR><B>News was later conveyed that the son had died in the duel, and every</B>
<BR><B>christmas eve the same bloody footprint can be seen on the staircase.</B>
<BR><B>This is not what I saw.</B>
<BR><B>I was 8 years old and it was the school holidays</B>
<BR><B>Two friends, Stuart and Stephen, and myself where walking thru the
garden</B>
<BR><B>when Stuart noticed one of the windows was blacked out. We noticed
it as the</B>
<BR><B>sun was behind the house and so should have been shining pretty
much through</B>
<BR><B>the hall&nbsp; and out the other side.</B>
<BR><B>Thinking that maybe there was something going on (there are occaisionally</B>
<BR><B>are demonstrations in the hall) we entered the building and up the
stairs.</B>
<BR><B>As we got to the top of the stairs Stephen remarked he felt 'a bit
funny'</B>
<BR><B>and I suddenly felt cold.</B>
<BR><B>The next thing we saw was a black blob about half a metre of the
floor and</B>
<BR><B>about 1.5 metres tall float out of one door and into another.</B>
<BR><B>Stuart asked if anyone else had seen it and we all said we had.
Stuart then</B>
<BR><B>started to walk down the corridor (very slowly) while stephen and
I stayed</B>
<BR><B>at the top of the stairs and where quite scared.</B>
<BR><B>Stuart looked round the corner, and then ran back to us. We where
so scared</B>
<BR><B>at this point that we just ran out and down the drive to the gate.</B>
<BR><B>Stuart told me later that he saw a figure about 6 ft tall that seemed
to be</B>
<BR><B>made of shadows. He wa dressed in a long coat and wore what looked
like a</B>
<BR><B>top hat. He seemed to be looking for something, and then it became
aware of</B>
<BR><B>him.</B>
<BR><B>He told me much later (about 10 years or so) that it looked over
it's</B>
<BR><B>shoulder at him and rather than a pair of eyes it had a single red
slit that</B>
<BR><B>seemed to pulse.</B>
<BR><B>I have been back to the hall since and seen nothing out of the ordinary,</B>
<BR><B>however I have felt very uneasy about certain rooms.</B>
<BR><B>Oh well. There you go.</B>

<P><B>A Story for you</B>

<P><B>Please don’t use my name, but you may incorporate my Email sm8051116@hotmail.com
for responses.</B>
<BR><B>I don’t know if this qualifies as a haunting/posession or if I’m
just crazy. I’ve read several stories on your site (which is great, by
the way) and haven’t come across anything similar to one of my experiences,
which I will tell below. My father is suffering from advanced Rheumatiod
Arthritis, along with Hepatitis C . . . not a nice combination. Anyway,
I have been living with the pain of knowing he would be sick and in pain
for the rest of his life since I was 16 (I’m now 22) and watching him suffer
and struggle with his diseases. Because of this, I have become increasingly
interested in whether or not there is another "phase of existence" after
we leave this world. I have been asking, both mentally and out loud, for
some type of proof of this, mostly for my own comfort. Anyway, I’ve recently
been hearing noises that sound like a lot of people talking at once in
my house when I’m home alone. It doesn’t bother or scare me, and it’s so
faint that it could be my imagination. Along with this I’ve heard walking
on the ceiling (my rooms are in the finished basement.&nbsp; By the way,
our house is new, it was a model home in a new development) and thinking
my fiancee was home, went upstairs to greet him only to find myself still
alone in the house. Since I’ve been asking for proof, I wonder if it’s
only my imagination, but this next part was scary. I heard the voices (sounds
like a crowd of people all talking at once) but this time I wasn’t hearing
them externally (with my ears) but originating from inside my head. I had
this weird feeling that they were all talking directly to me, rather than
just overhearing things like the other occasions. Anyway, the voices in
my head (sound crazy, don’t I) just kept getting louder and louder, and
all of a sudden I was laughing uncontrollably for no reason. Probably doesn’t
sound too scary to you, but the whole time I was laughing (about 5 minutes)
I was having thoughts like "why am I laughing", "Why can’t I stop laughing,
there’s nothing funny about this", and such. I was scared, and physically
willed myself to stop laughing, which didn’t work. The voices started fading
after about 5 minutes, and my laughing reduced to giggles, and then to
shocked silence. I have never told anyone about these things, I even think
I sound crazy. And no, I was not on any mind altering substances at the
time this happened. Has the voices/laughing thing happened to anyone else
out there, or am I just crazy?? If this HAS happened to someone out there,
please email me at sm8051116@hotmail.com with the word ghost in the subject
line.&nbsp; Please, only serious responses , I don't need to hear how you
think I'm nuts.</B>

<BR><B>In Tune</B>

<P><B>By:Anonymous</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>OK, I know there are skeptics out there, but my grandmother, my mom,
and I are very in tune with spirits for some reason.&nbsp; I'll start with
my Grandparents "Baby-sitting Ghost".&nbsp; We call him that because only
kids could see him if all the adults were out of the house. To explain
about the house a bit, the hallway is L-shaped.&nbsp; There is a bathroom
to your immediate right, then 2 bedrooms (bedrooms 1 &amp; 2) on your left.&nbsp;
When you turn the corner, there is a bedroom (#3) on your left, another
bathroom on your right, and the last bedroom (#4) at the end of the hall.&nbsp;
My mom's dad was at work and her mom and all my mom's brothers and sisters
were outside talking to friends and such.&nbsp; My mom was just sitting
and watching TV. As my mom was watching TV, she saw something moving out
of the corner of her eye and looked down the hallway from the living room.&nbsp;
There was a very tiny old man sitting in a rocking chair reading a book
and looking up at her from time to time.&nbsp; She said he just smiled
at her and kept rocking and reading.&nbsp; When the adults came back into
the house, he disappeared.&nbsp; Two of my cousins have seen him also.</B>
<BR><B>The one thing that totally freaked us out was after my mom and I
moved in with my grandparents.&nbsp; My Uncle K had died in the first bedroom
about a year before.&nbsp; He was really into drinking and drugs, so one
night his heart, liver and kidneys just failed on him.&nbsp; He was the
practical joker of the family.&nbsp; Anyhow, my mom and I came home one
night and my grandparents were out.&nbsp; We both had to use the bathroom
real bad so my mom ran to the first one and I went to the second one at
the end of the hallway.&nbsp; All of a sudden I heard my mom yell "Hey!"&nbsp;
I was about to open the door to ask why she was yelling at me when I saw
a hand open the bathroom door.&nbsp; I hurried up and finished my business
and ran to my mom and asked her what happened…. Why did she open the door
to the bathroom and not tell me what she needed.&nbsp; Then I realized
she was still in the bathroom.&nbsp; She said she saw a hand opening her
bathroom door.&nbsp; I told her I saw the same thing.&nbsp; We were the
only people in the house and this happened on the opposite ends of the
house.&nbsp; She just looked up at the ceiling and said, "K, stop scaring
us.&nbsp; We don't want to play with you right now.&nbsp; Your jokes aren't
funny!"&nbsp; We heard the most evil laugh we could imagine.&nbsp; At that
point, we looked at each other and ran out of the house.&nbsp; When we
came back, my grandparents were home and we sat my grandma down and told
her what happened.&nbsp; She had to have the house blessed 3 times before
the spirits went away.</B>

<BR><B>A Strange Encounter</B>

<P><B>By: cadzan@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>After searching your excellent site at theshadowlands.net and reading
about some of the haunted events at the University of Montevallo in Montevallo,
Alabama, all of which I knew about first hand, I wanted to relate one of
several oddities that happened to me while I attended school there. You
are right about this place being a “Bermuda Triangle” of sorts. I was there
between 1971 and 1974 and during that time there were several ghostly sightings,
UFO sightings and otherworldly activities that seemed to happen with odd
frequency. I want to relate one that I experienced myself.</B>
<BR><B>Montevallo is a small college town about 30 miles south of Birmingham,
more or less in the middle of nowhere. Outside the town, there are many
other even smaller communities… the one I want to mention is a place called
Marvel. I am not an expert on the history of the area, but the land all
around that part of Alabama is honeycombed with underground limestone deposits
that often give way making for some amazing overnight sinkholes of incredible
depth; many with prehistoric rivers at the bottom. The place called Marvel
was at one time an active limestone mine. When I was there, the strip mine
had long been closed and deserted, but the huge open crater ringed by rows
of miner’s houses were still standing. High on a hill overlooking the site
was what is known as the “Marvel Mansion”, a palatial home built sometime
in the 1920s. The house was barely visible from the narrow, twisting road.
The trees and bushes had all grown out of control, right up next to the
building blocking out the once beautiful lawn that had surrounded it. The
driveway ran through large, rusted iron gates, past a gatehouse and a dilapidated
garage that once held three or four cars, around to the back of the house.
The mansion itself was made of stone, possibly granite, and was in a squared
U shape with a greenhouse (used as a type of central heat and air system)
built in the space between the two wings. There was a patio on the side
of the house that was accessed from inside through two French doors. All
the modern conveniences of the day had been built into the house and were
still there, for the most part. The story goes like this: The family had
sent their only daughter to Europe to attend school some time in the 1950s.
While there, she met and married a man without consulting her family. When
they discovered what had happened, they dropped everything and left immediately
to try to annul the marriage. They never returned. Apparently they didn’t
take much with them and left their home with most of their belongings right
where they were. By the early 1970s, the place had become a favorite place
for fraternity hazings, parties, s&eacute;ances and an occasional home
to vagrants, until the county sheriff would show up and run everyone off.
Vandalism had taken its toll on the place. There were copies of “Look”,
“Life”, “National Geographic” and many other magazines dating from the
1950s still to be found. Some were intact, but most were thrown all over
the house. The mirrors and chandeliers had been cracked and shattered,
but still had some of their magnificence. There were also canned goods,
clothes and other personal items littered about the house, but it was easy
to see that these had been left behind as if the owners might have returned
in short order. I should make clear that I have no idea what happened to
the people or why they never came back. And, I don’t know the legalities
of who owned the home or why it was left standing in such a state, but
on the particular late afternoon in the Fall of 1972 that I made one of
several visits there, I think there was an attempt to pass some information
to me.</B>
<BR><B>I had gone there with a couple of friends just to do a little exploring.
It was already late afternoon when we arrived, so we took flashlights and
set out to see the place from top to bottom. After we’d seen all the upstairs
rooms, we decided to go to the basement. This was a large underground cavernous
place with no outside light, so we were completely dependant on the feeble
yellow beam of our lights as we started down the stairs. Typical of the
scenario in any good horror movie, we had a couple of those moments where
the lights failed and we were plunged into utter darkness only to have
the beam come back on after some frantic shaking of the flashlights. Downstairs
we saw some of the “modern” conveniences I mentioned like an electric washer
and a wring dryer from the 1920s. There was also a huge bank type safe
that must have been six feet tall by six feet wide, with one of those old
fashioned wheels that you turn to open the door. When we had another light
failure, we decided our visit was over. I went up the stairs first and
decided to wait on the others on the patio outside the French doors. The
daylight now was purple and fading fast. As I stood there I looked down
and spotted a square white object on the ground that looked like a card
or possibly a note. When I picked it up I saw that it was a photograph
that had been lying face down on the ground. It was a faded black and white
picture of a young girl, possibly eight or nine years old, taken sometime
in the 1930s. She was wearing a sailor type dress, a popular dress style
for little girls at that time, and she was standing in front of the French
doors on the very patio where I was. Furthermore, the person who took the
picture must have been standing exactly where I now stood, as the angle
was the same in every way. Of course, there is no normal explanation for
how a picture could have survived such exposure to the elements for any
length of time, and the odds that it would appear in this exact location
are very small indeed. I don’t know if the girl was the same girl that
went off to school and led the rest of her family away from their home
forever, but there are very good odds that it was her since she was the
family’s only daughter. Needless to say, we left as quickly as we could.
Although I managed to keep the picture for many years afterward and used
it to illustrate my telling of this occurrence, I did eventually lose it.
I hope you will find this interesting enough to add to your collection
of true experiences.</B>

<P><B>A Strange Little Child</B>

<P><B>By: zerojb@lcc.net</B>

<P><B>I was visiting some relatives in Denton, TX in early July of this
year (2001) when this strange event took place. My relatives live in a
trailor park and some of the trailors are sitting close together.</B>
<BR><B>One late night when I was there, my nephew left his cigarettes in
his car so he went out to get them. I went with him. As we were walking
to his car, we noticed that next door there was someone rummaging around
in a trashcan that was in the back of the neighbors truck. We thought nothing
of it, thinking it was just one of the neighbors looking for something
they threw away. As it was dark near where the vehicles were parked, we
couldn't make out who it was.</B>
<BR><B>Well, my nephew got his cigarettes out of his car and we were walking
to the front of his trailor where there is a bench you can sit on. We were
walking towards it when we noticed whoever it was that was looking through
the garbage can was now walking up to the next door neighbors porch, which
was a good 20/30 feet from us. For whatever reason, just the sight of the
"person" made both of us freeze while this figure just stood at the foot
of the next door neighbors porch steps, with its back to us.</B>
<BR><B>It was almost as if this figure KNEW we were looking at it but it
wasn't even facing toward us. It just stood there, and we felt that somehow
it was looking at us...somehow.</B>
<BR><B>In the light of the porchlights, we could make out details of this
figure. The figure was of a small boy, but what was weird was his head
was shaven on both sides of his head and in the middle was a blonde mohawk
type haircut, except it wasn't the short type, but more of the longer haired
style mohawk. This kid had 80's style clothes on, the shirt multi-colored
and unbuttoned, light-blue shorts and white tennis shoes.</B>
<BR><B>This "kid" just stood there for a few more moments and began ascending
the nextdoor neighbors steps in a stiff, awkward way. It's arms were close
to its sides and as it went up the steps, it just continued staring straight
ahead, not once looking down or in any other direction.</B>
<BR><B>Then, the view of the "kid" was obstructed by the neighbors porch
so we could no longer see "him". The weird thing is we never heard the
nextdoor neighbors front door open or anything that would indicate this
"person" went in. My nephew and I, very unnerved and chilled, we ran into
his parents trailor!</B>
<BR><B>We sat in his living room for a while trying to rationalize what
it was we had seen. He told me that the neighbors had two girls, but looked
NOTHING like what we had seen. We asked my newphew's mother, my sister,
if she knew if the neighbors had some relatives over and if so if they
had a boy that looked like what we described. She said not that shew knew
of.</B>
<BR><B>Well, the next day, we go over to the neighbors trailor and ask
them if they had anyone over that looked like what we saw and they said
"no, we've had no visitors in 2 weeks, and that no, we have no boys or
children like what you described." My nephew and I then noticed their two
girls in the living room. We confirmed that was the only children they
had.</B>
<BR><B>So....who or what could it have been? Where did "it" go? We didn't
hear "it" go in the neighbors home that night, so maybe it was just a strange
neighborhood kid and went through their backyard to where they were going?
Well, that would have been very difficult since the neighbors have one
of those extremely high wooden fences with no doors on it in their backyard.
Besides, why would "it" go through the trouble of going up into their porch
when they could have gone around?</B>
<BR><B>It's an old trailor park and there's no telling how many people
have lived/died in a lot of those trailors...I'm just glad I don't live
there! :)</B>
<BR><B>Something and everything about this is strange and what we saw that
night I know in my heart that it was not normal, but paranormal! I'm just
glad the figure never turned around to look at us....I don't know what
would have happened then. I'd hate to find out.</B>

<P><B>My friend Todd and I were on our way from a county fair when we went
over this road right by where our school was and Todd started to tell me
this story. He said that a long time ago this girl got raped and killed
by two guys one night and threw over the bridge and I believed him because
I remember reading a paper about a dead girl body found in the river where
we were. Todd said sometimes some of his friends and people who lived around
here saw a girl walking on the water at night but I thought is was bull
crap so i told him he was lying. After awhile when we were driving around
he decided to go back at bridge so he could show me. so we pulled over
and parked by the bridge I told him to take me home but he wouldn't. So
he sat there for a half an hour until i saw something by the bridge and
I said Todd Look!!!!! There was this guy in white walking by the bridge
and he stopped ata tree and he was pulling a girl out of the tree and you
could tell it was girl because she had long hair. So there we were watching
a guy pull a naked girl out of a tree the guy looked at us and he faded
away. Todd spun out there and took me home we were terrifyed. So he dropped
me off at my house and that night I couldn't go to sleep I will never ever
forget that night.</B>

<BR><B>my five year old nephew. Although the house has a nice "feel" to
it,</B>
<BR><B>several strange occurrences have happened since we moved in.</B>
<BR><B>My sister complained of hearing breathing when she went in to the
spare</B>
<BR><B>basement bedroom (now my bedroom). She has also heard someone walking
up</B>
<BR><B>and down the stairs when she was alone in the house. The cat would
be put</B>
<BR><B>outside but would reappear inside the house several hours later!
This was</B>
<BR><B>very odd seeing as the back door would be locked (no working cat
flap),</B>
<BR><B>the cat never went to the front of the house (the back garden backs
on to</B>
<BR><B>everyone else's and there is no garden gate etc. for rear access,
the</B>
<BR><B>front opens on to a main road),&nbsp; and there are no windows open
at ground</B>
<BR><B>level. We have looked everywhere but never have been able to explain
it</B>
<BR><B>and the cat has certainly never given anything away. Think she was
just</B>
<BR><B>glad someone was letting her in early!</B>
<BR><B>More recently, I was washing up in the kitchen (facing the closed
window</B>
<BR><B>blind), when I saw a large shadow of a person (a man I believe)
walk up</B>
<BR><B>behind me. I grabbed a knife (as I was alone in the house) and turned
to</B>
<BR><B>confront the intruder - but you've guessed it, there was no one
there! I</B>
<BR><B>immediately looked outside but again nobody was about and the garden
is</B>
<BR><B>secluded with high fences so it isn't possible there was an outside</B>
<BR><B>reflection.</B>
<BR><B>A few weeks later I was drying my hair and as I combed it through
(I was</B>
<BR><B>standing next to the bannister in the basement, this hall joins
the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen, my bedroom and a spare room) when I saw out of the corner
of my</B>
<BR><B>eye (and heard) someone walk down the stairs and lean over the bannister.</B>
<BR><B>I welcomed my sister and commented on her arriving home early. No
reply.</B>
<BR><B>When I looked up, again I was on my own (my sister and nephew arrived</B>
<BR><B>about an hour later).</B>
<BR><B>The most up to date experience occurred a few weeks ago. I was in
bed (a</B>
<BR><B>workday) and woke up about 5.30am (an hour before my alarm is due
to go</B>
<BR><B>off). Lying in bed with my back to my bedroom door I distinctly
heard two</B>
<BR><B>sharp raps to the wood. "Come in" I shouted, thinking it was my
sister and</B>
<BR><B>a little odd she should knock, especially at such an early hour.
Nobody</B>
<BR><B>came through the door and I rolled over and went to sleep. When
I met my</B>
<BR><B>sister in the kitchen over breakfast, I happened to mention that
somebody</B>
<BR><B>knocked on my bedroom door that morning. She went white (literally)
and</B>
<BR><B>said "about 5.30am this morning, two sharp raps to the wood?" I
confirmed</B>
<BR><B>it and she said exactly the same happened to her and at exactly
the same</B>
<BR><B>time! She thought it was me and turned to her son (who had climbed
in with</B>
<BR><B>her a few hours beforehand) and said "Oh no, now J can't sleep either
and</B>
<BR><B>she wants to come in". She thought it was strange I would knock
and even</B>
<BR><B>stranger that when she called "come in" I didn't bother to enter!
When I</B>
<BR><B>told our mother this she said the same thing had happened to her
one</B>
<BR><B>morning. She thought it was someone knocking to wake her for breakfast
but</B>
<BR><B>when she got up everyone was still fast asleep. She couldn't remember</B>
<BR><B>where she was when it happened and then she said, "Oh yes, that's
right,</B>
<BR><B>it was before you moved in J and I was in what is now your bedroom.....".</B>
<BR><B>Again, this isn't simply explained as I sleep in the basement and
my</B>
<BR><B>sister and nephew sleep in the top of the house, so there is a floor
(the</B>
<BR><B>lounge) in between us.</B>
<BR><B>My sister has looked up the history of the house and it would appear
it</B>
<BR><B>remained in the same family for about 70-odd years, so they must
have</B>
<BR><B>loved it very much. We are both totally level headed and paranormal</B>
<BR><B>research investigators ourselves, so we figure as long as nothing
nasty</B>
<BR><B>happens, we are more than happy to share! We have told the house
as much</B>
<BR><B>but I'll let you know if anything else occurs.....</B>

<P><B>A Visitor</B>

<P><B>By: ppederson@syd.eastlink.ca</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>My name is Paul and I live in Canada, in the province of Nova Scotia,
in a small city called Sydney. This small city was at one time an industrial
centre with coal mines and a large steel plant that employed thousands.
This areas past employment promises has drawn many foreigners to settle
here and we have a rich history of superstitions and beliefs. I should
say that I'm not exactly a believer in ghosts although I have an open mind
to the idea that there may be something to it all. anyway on with my story.</B>
<BR><B>I think I was seventeen or eighteen when this happened which was
around 1987. I was working for my local McDonalds restraunt and was working
until around 2 a.m. It was shortly after midnight when I took a break and
called my girlfriend to say goodnite. As we talked she stopped&nbsp; to
see if someone had come down the stairs from the second level of her parents
home, because she thought she had heard footsteps. She checked the stairs
twice but nobody was there. The conversation turned to the fact that at
times, she would hear sounds in the house as though someone was walking&nbsp;
the stairs. Our topic then returned to the normal teenage babble until
she happened to look into the adjacent room. She thought she saw someone
siting at the end of the sofa. She put the phone down momentarily while
she turned on the light in the darkened room. It was only a sweater and
a jacket laid over the backrest of the sofa, so we resumed our conversation
once again. I can tell you that she had no thoughts of anything paranormal,
she was thinking that maybe someone else was home, other than her sleeping
parents, as she had a number of older brothers still living at home.</B>
<BR><B>I can remember that as we talked she stopped dead in mid sentence,
and started to weep. I was wondering what was wrong thinking that I had
said something to upset her. When I got her to speak she told me that there
was someone there, standing in the doorway of the room where she had just
been. She sobbed that she was trying to sit very still in the hopes that
this apparition would not "see" her and just go away. I tried to talk to
her and settle her down, not quite sure if this was a joke or not. I think
that the figure stood in this position for at least five minutes(minimum).
Then just when my terrified girlfriend calmed a little, the figure moved
into the hallway and assumed a sitting position(legs crossed). I again
had to try and calm her sobbing by talking to her and asking her to describe
what she was seeing. The figure she said appeared to be a boy of about
eight or ten years old. He was wearing a modern looking winter jacket and
a winter hat. She said that although the facial features were not plain
the eyes could be clearly seen and were blue. The hands and feet area of
the figure faded out of sight. This boy sat on the floor not ten feet from
her and looked right at her. Another minute or two passed and then may
girlfriend started weeping again. I remember her whispering "Oh! , Paul!
Oh, Paul....... it's a girl !! ". She told me that the figure had reached
up and pulled the hat off its head and long blond hair flowed from under
it. The figure sat and stared in my girlfriends direction a few moments
more and then appeared to stand up and go back into the room from where
it had came, and disappeared. My girlfriend stayed on the phone just long
enough to be sure it was gone, then she hung up with me and ran for her
parents bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>That was the end of the experience, it had lasted about fifeteen
minutes. She asked her parents the next day if they could think of who
this may have been. They had no ideas and probably didn't believe her.
I wasn't quite sure if I beleived her either and I kept asking her if she
was playing a joke on me. She insisted she saw what she saw and she wasn't
comfortable talking about it for fear that it may reappear.</B>
<BR><B>I'm now married to my girlfriend and she still swears every word
of this story is true. She still doesn't like to talk about it. No one
has ever seen a ghost in that house before or since that I'm aware of.
My wife has over the years gotten "spooked" and come running to me saying
that she felt uneasy and was afraid "she" was back, but she hasn't been.
I don't know if you respond to these letters or not , but if you do write
me a note to tell me what you think.</B>

<BR><B>About Something I Have seen</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>By: sinead_sunshine@yahoo.co.uk About something I have seen</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I had an odd experience a few months ago, I am not</B>
<BR><B>sure what to make of it, and I am worried that it was</B>
<BR><B>just my imagination but I am pretty certain that it</B>
<BR><B>wasn't, So I guess thats what your here for to hear my</B>
<BR><B>story and to tell me what you think. Thanks.</B>
<BR><B>About 5 months ago, a girl I know got knocked down by</B>
<BR><B>a car and was put in a coma. I was really shook up by</B>
<BR><B>this and very upset.</B>
<BR><B>I am a big fan of the actor River Phoenix and I really</B>
<BR><B>look up to him in a big way. I was in completle shock</B>
<BR><B>about what had happend to the girl I know as I was</B>
<BR><B>only with her the day before it happened. I was crying</B>
<BR><B>and begging River to help her. I kept crying to him</B>
<BR><B>for days begging him to help her pull through. Then</B>
<BR><B>one saturday night, it must have been in the very</B>
<BR><B>early hours of the next morning some time after mid</B>
<BR><B>night, when I woke up, I was half asleep and I saw the</B>
<BR><B>black silhouette of a man standing by the side of my</B>
<BR><B>bed. For some reason I just knew without a doubt that</B>
<BR><B>it was a man, I couldn't make out any features as it</B>
<BR><B>was just a silhouette but I could tell what his hair</B>
<BR><B>style was like, his hair was quite long. I could also</B>
<BR><B>identify a pointed nose. I don't remember any of his</B>
<BR><B>body, I can't even picture it, it was just his head</B>
<BR><B>and his shoulders, thinking about it now, the rest of</B>
<BR><B>his body was just non existent and I didn't even seem</B>
<BR><B>to notice, I was not scared at all, infact I was quite</B>
<BR><B>annoyed because I was half asleep and very tired.</B>
<BR><B>Infact its quite funny now to think that I knew that</B>
<BR><B>something out of this world was standing before my</B>
<BR><B>eyes but I was more concerned about getting back to</B>
<BR><B>sleep. I think I made a grunting noise and turned</B>
<BR><B>round and faced the other way trying to get back to</B>
<BR><B>sleep, I rolled over once again just to take another</B>
<BR><B>look at the silhouette and make sure it wasn't my</B>
<BR><B>imagination, this time it was at the top corner of my</B>
<BR><B>door just taking one look at me before it went. I</B>
<BR><B>rolled over again satisfied that it wasn't my</B>
<BR><B>imagination and went back to sleep. It was only the</B>
<BR><B>next morning once I awoke that I was quite scared</B>
<BR><B>about what I had seen. A few days later I found out</B>
<BR><B>that the girl I knew had woken from her coma a few</B>
<BR><B>says before. What was it that I saw that night? Was it</B>
<BR><B>River, or perhaps an angel or something else? or just</B>
<BR><B>maybe an over active imagination?</B>

and my friends</B>
<BR><B>were walking towrds the car when I heard something slam.Like a door</B>

van the</B>

shake as we</B>
<BR><B>waited for him. There was a projected spot where his body was found.
there</B>
<BR><B>was a faint light gleaming by this spot only four feet to the left
of it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The story goes that a man in his mid thirties lived next to

<BR><B>Black Horse Pub</B>

<P><B>By: GosportRose@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My name is Kate and I live in the South of England. I have had a
few spooky stories, mostly unremarkable but still eerie. Nevertheless,
here is one that happened to an ex boyfriend around 1990.</B>
<BR><B>His name was David and he lived in a&nbsp; village about ten miles
away called Wickham. Like all settlements around my area, it is over a
thousand years old and ghost stories abound.</B>
<BR><B>One night, David was riding his motorbike down a lane. It was a
very long road, straight as far as the eye can see. Suddenly from nowhere,&nbsp;
a white "face" floated up to his and stayed level. All the time, David
was doing around fifty miles an hour on his bike. It was a staring, wide
eyed face that scared the life out of him. Then this "thing" slipped away
sideways and disappeared. Dave pulled into his local, a pub called the
Black Horse, to get a drink and seek solace from his friends.</B>
<BR><B>An important thing to remember is that Dave was always a sceptical,
no-nonsense kind of person. He didn't/doesn't believe in the paranormal.
He is also a very tough person whom people never imagine to be afraid.
But he was afraid that night and to the other customers, his fear was quite
profound. It took only a matter of days for Dave to go quiet on the matter.
He was embarrassed at his fear, at letting his guard drop. But there have
been stories about our area for many years and I believe that he saw something.</B>

<P><B>Boo!</B>

<P><B>By: ELMSDUNN@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I am actually only twelve years old and I first got interested
when I was</B>
<BR><B>about nine. I have quite few of "experiences." When I was little
we (my</B>
<BR><B>family) had a ball that when you turned it onto different sides
it would play</B>
<BR><B>different tunes. One day when my sister and I where playing in the
play room,</B>
<BR><B>it all of a sudden started. We took it down from the closet and
showed it to</B>
<BR><B>our parents. They took out the batteries and put it back in the
closet. The</B>
<BR><B>next day we went up stairs to get some coloring books when we heard
the ball</B>
<BR><B>start singing. We heard it every day until we gave it to good will,
but then</B>
<BR><B>another strange thing occurred. I was cleaning out my grand mother's
room,</B>
<BR><B>talking on the phone and watching TV when everything in that one
room started</B>
<BR><B>going on and off. And when we got home from dinner that night, all
the little</B>
<BR><B>statues in her room were knocked off the shelves. WEIRD. The next
couple</B>
<BR><B>years everything was okay, but one weekend, while I was at my grandmother's</B>
<BR><B>house, she showed me a picture from a Christmas during the 1970s.
At first I</B>
<BR><B>thought it was just a normal picture that a flash problem, but then
I began</B>
<BR><B>to see two ghostly figures. One, of my great grandmother and the
other of a</B>
<BR><B>scary skeletal face becoming clearer and clearer every second. And
about a</B>
<BR><B>week ago locked doors began opening, I'd close them and they'd open
once</B>
<BR><B>more. These stories are not exaggerated and they really happened.</B>

<BR><B>California Ghost Story</B>

<P><B>By: mikaylasmommy@earthlink.net</B>

<P><B>Hello, I came across your site today and I tried to add a story but
the page wouldn't open to be able to add it. I thought you might be interested
in posting it. It's about a road in Ojai California called Creek Road.
It's a dark lonely road that winds through the wilderness outside the town
of Ojai. It's covered by gnarled branches from old oak trees &amp; it's
even spooky feeling in the day time. There seems to be 4 ghosts that haunt
the road. The best known is one they call "Charman" because he is so horribly
burned. Practically to a crisp with flesh peeling away from his bones &amp;
his face is a blackened skull that is grinning with still a few shreds
of skin hanging. Some people claim they can smell the stench of burning
flesh. He's an angry spirit who has been known to actually go after people
who are walking along the road alone at night. One kid actually tested
the story and walked down the road by himself only to come running from
the road stark white claiming that the charman had torn his jacket from
his body. (This actually made newspapers.) They dont know who this guy
is but one of the theroies is he was set afire in the forest and left to
burn to death so he stalks the road at night seeking revenge on his murderer.
There is also a young horsewoman who rides her horse down the road recklessly
until she reaches the curve which is very sharp. The horse stumbles, rears
&amp; throws her. She falls &amp; breaks her neck &amp; dies instantly.
Then in the&nbsp; next few minutes she is back again &amp; the scene is
played over &amp; over until daylight. This is supposidly known to happen
on the night she died. As for the 3rd ghost... this one is a bride who
hitch hikes down the road in her wedding dress stained with blood. Nobody
knows who she is or why she was killed on her wedding day or why she hitch
hikes on this road to commemerate her murder. The 4th ghost is of a motercyclist
who races down the road at break neck speed&nbsp; over &amp; over again.
Nobody knows how he navigates it so well because he is headless...</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Just thought you might be interested... I know they sound
like the classic campfire scary stories but there are several people in
the Ojai area who have seen them. Let me know if you decide to put this
on your page or not. Thanks!</B>

<P><B>My story is of my cat who came back to give me a message.</B>
<BR><B>It was a nice afternoon and I had to take out the compost. As I
was walking</B>
<BR><B>I had the feeling that I was being watched. When I looked to my
right, my</B>
<BR><B>cat whom had been dead for 3 years was standing in the edge of the
woods. He</B>
<BR><B>was the exact same only instead of the ebony color, he was a whitesh
green.</B>
<BR><B>He had something in his mouth and placed it on the ground in front
of him.</B>
<BR><B>Then he faded away. I quickly went over to where he was standing
and where</B>
<BR><B>he had been was a large patch of dead moss. I was puzzled untill
later that</B>
<BR><B>day when I had found out that my Great Aunt had died. My cat has
only</B>
<BR><B>returned once after that and he was as black as eboney again. This
time when</B>
<BR><B>he faded away there was fresh, green grass where none had grown
before.</B>

<BR><B>The Moving Bed</B>
<BR><B>By: incagold@hotmail.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>The first year I worked there, I worked mostly alone on the front
station.</B>
<BR><B>One night I went into a room to check on a patient.&nbsp; It was
a double</B>
<BR><B>occupancy room, but currently only one patient was in the room.&nbsp;
I walked in</B>
<BR><B>to see the first bed, which was empty, had been moved to a diagonally</B>
<BR><B>position.&nbsp; I straightened it, thinking the cleaning staff had
moved it when</B>
<BR><B>they mopped that evening.&nbsp; Checked my patient and left.&nbsp;
An hour later I was</B>
<BR><B>making rounds (my own personal schedule was every hour instead of
the</B>
<BR><B>prescribed every two hours) when I noticed the bed was again on
the</B>
<BR><B>diagonal.&nbsp; The third time this happened, I went to check the
records to see</B>
<BR><B>if anyone had been assigned to this bed during the last two days
when I was</B>
<BR><B>off duty.&nbsp; Sure enough Agnes _____ had been moved to this room
and died 24</B>
<BR><B>hours later.&nbsp; I went back to the room, again the bed was on
a diagonal, and</B>
<BR><B>said, "Agnes, you died here, it is time to move on now, some where
much</B>
<BR><B>better where you will no longer hurt, or be lonely."&nbsp; That
was the end of</B>
<BR><B>the moving bed.&nbsp; My patient was happy, too, she said she was
tired of having</B>
<BR><B>that bed moved about every time I left, it woke her up. The end
of the bed</B>
<BR><B>always bumped her bed when it was moved to the diagonal.</B>

<BR><B>Footsteps</B>
<BR><B>By: incagold@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Then I was assigned another station the third year I worked for the</B>
<BR><B>hospital.&nbsp; It was a cold, rainy winter night.&nbsp; We were
grumping just a bit</B>
<BR><B>about supplies, which were always shorted at night. This night we
were</B>
<BR><B>completely out of talcum powder.</B>
<BR><B>On first rounds a gentleman patient of mine was complaining about
some one</B>
<BR><B>walking into his room, coming in from the patio and letting in cold
air.</B>
<BR><B>The gentleman had moments of confusion and the patio was in the
center of</B>
<BR><B>the hospital. No access from the outside, only patients rooms.&nbsp;
I checked</B>
<BR><B>his patio door and it was locked.&nbsp; I also checked all the rooms
with patio</B>
<BR><B>doors discovering, they too were locked.&nbsp; We used screws with
bolts for</B>
<BR><B>locks to make sure no one could wander out at night.&nbsp; I figured
he must just</B>
<BR><B>be having some confusion, what with it being late and a bit stormy.</B>
<BR><B>A little while later, the gentleman turned on his call light.&nbsp;
I went to his</B>
<BR><B>room and he again complained someone had been walking through his
room, and</B>
<BR><B>let in the cold air.&nbsp; It was a bit chilly.&nbsp; I got him
an extra blanket and</B>
<BR><B>sat with him until he went to sleep.&nbsp; Then came time for second
rounds...The</B>
<BR><B>hallway, for about 15 was covered in talcum powder, and there were
damp</B>
<BR><B>footprints.&nbsp; I ran and collected the other night shift workers
(9) and</B>
<BR><B>showed them.&nbsp; Talk about spooked people!! One woman was brave
enough to go</B>
<BR><B>down the hall, and into the gentleman's room with me.&nbsp; It was
covered in</B>
<BR><B>talcum and the glass patio door was open, there were footprints
from the</B>
<BR><B>door area all the way to the hall to the end of the talcum trail.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>gentleman was complaining about a woman coming through his room.&nbsp;
He had</B>
<BR><B>been paralyzed from mid-back down for over 20 years, we knew he
did not do</B>
<BR><B>it.&nbsp; Besides, where did the powder come from, and the small
footprints?&nbsp; And</B>

<BR><B>The Man In The Bathroom</B>
<BR><B>By: incagold@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>During my fourth year I was again moved to another station. The first
night</B>
<BR><B>on first rounds, I went to check on two male patients in a double
room, that</B>
<BR><B>shared a bathroom with another double room.&nbsp; Having seen the
two men were</B>
<BR><B>okay and sleeping well, I started to go through the bathroom instead
of out</B>
<BR><B>to the hallway, then into the adjoining room.&nbsp; The door to
the bathroom was</B>
<BR><B>closed and the light on.&nbsp; I thought it strange as none of the
men were</B>
<BR><B>supposed to be able to get up without assistance.&nbsp; I went out
to the hall</B>
<BR><B>and into the other room to find the one man in there asleep in bed.
As there</B>
<BR><B>were only three men in the two bedrooms who was in the bathroom?&nbsp;
I heard</B>
<BR><B>the water running in the bathroom, then it shut off.&nbsp; I knocked
on the door,</B>
<BR><B>and opened it.&nbsp; The light was still on, a man in beige slippers,
and a red</B>
<BR><B>plaid bathrobe was just exiting into the adjoining bedroom.&nbsp;
He turned to</B>
<BR><B>look at me.&nbsp; He was thin, had white neatly trimmed hair ringing
his head</B>
<BR><B>like a laurel wreath, pale blue eyes, and pale 'indoor' skin.&nbsp;
He nodded and</B>
<BR><B>walked into the other room.&nbsp; I called out, "Sir..."&nbsp; But
he did not answer.</B>
<BR><B>I followed, he was gone.&nbsp; I looked into the hallway, but no
was there except</B>
<BR><B>the Supervisor.&nbsp; I asked her if she had seen anyone.&nbsp;
She said no.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>described the man I had seen.&nbsp; She turned so pale I thought
she would faint.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; She told me the man had died in one of those rooms the first
year she</B>
<BR><B>worked at the hospital-15 years ago! Not only that, but the reason
the one</B>
<BR><B>room only had one patient, was no one could sleep in the bed next
to the</B>
<BR><B>window where he died.&nbsp; They complained of a big lump in the
bed, or someone</B>
<BR><B>trying to push them out of bed.&nbsp; Changing the mattress and
putting a</B>
<BR><B>different bed in the room did not help.&nbsp; So they just quit
trying to put</B>
<BR><B>anyone else in the room by the window.</B>

<P><B>By: kelljospicer4@msn.com</B>

<P><B>I would see this apperition at night when I was ready to go to bed.&nbsp;
He would be standing at the foot of my bed of in the entrance of the bathroom
or the entrance to the bedroom.&nbsp; He once appeared as a hat rack at
the side of my bed and it looked like it was falling on me.&nbsp; I rolled
over as fast as I could to keep it from hitting me.&nbsp; I put my arms
over my head waiting for the impact but it never came.&nbsp; When I looked
up it was gone.&nbsp; This happedned to my about twelve years ago.&nbsp;
I don't see it anymore but I still wonder what the hell that was and why
was it bothering me?&nbsp; I know that I was awake everytime it happened.&nbsp;
I would squint and blink my eyes thinking my eyes were just playing tricks
on me and I was just seeing things, but I would blink and squint but he
was still there when I would look back.&nbsp; Then one day he just never
came back.&nbsp; Thank goodness,&nbsp; but I would still like to know what
that was.</B>

<BR><B>Disappearing Girl</B>

<P><B>By: res0fl9x@verizon.net</B>

<P><B>Hey all, I'm Erik and I have something that I would like to say about
a</B>
<BR><B>strange occurance that happened when I was around 7.&nbsp; Every
time I think</B>
<BR><B>about it it gets stranger and stranger to me.</B>
<BR><B>Of course, I was in elementary school at the time and it was the
last day of</B>
<BR><B>August and it was nice out, so my dad and I decided to go to my
school and</B>
<BR><B>play a little frisbee.&nbsp; It was about 7:30 at night, and the
sky was just</B>
<BR><B>starting to get dark. There was just us two and some guy sitting
on the</B>
<BR><B>bench reading the newspaper.&nbsp; After a little while a girl that
looked about</B>
<BR><B>my age or a little older came out of the forest (which surrounds
most of the</B>
<BR><B>perimeter of the field).&nbsp; She didn't say a word or make a sound,
but my dad</B>
<BR><B>asked her if she wanted to join us.&nbsp; She smiled and bent over
a little bit</B>
<BR><B>as if to catch the frisbee.&nbsp; My dad threw it to her and soon
enough we were</B>
<BR><B>all just having a good time out there.</B>
<BR><B>A little bit later it was almost pitch black out, and the girl threw
the</B>
<BR><B>frisbee to my dad.&nbsp; He didn't catch it so I watched as he took
a couple</B>
<BR><B>steps back to pick it up.&nbsp; We turned back an instant later,
and she was</B>
<BR><B>nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; Mind you that it must have been two seconds
and she</B>
<BR><B>could not have dashed into the woods because for one it was a pretty
big</B>
<BR><B>field and for two it should take around ten seconds for anyone to
run off</B>
<BR><B>and not be seen.</B>
<BR><B>A couple other things that I thought were interesting: It was a
blue moon</B>
<BR><B>out, AND it was 8:31 on 8/31 when she disappeared.&nbsp; We asked
the guy reading</B>
<BR><B>the paper where the girl went and he says "what girl" and my dad
says "The</B>
<BR><B>only girl that was here!"&nbsp; He shrugged his shoulders so we
walked off and</B>
<BR><B>went home.&nbsp; When we told my mom about what happened she took
it all in</B>
<BR><B>stride, like she was humoring us.</B>
<BR><B>I would say "it's something just between my dad and me now", but
I haven't</B>
<BR><B>seen my dad in four years.</B>

<P><B>Do You Have An Explanation</B>

<P><B>By: bradandvickie@grics.net]</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I am sending you my story in hopes of getting some sort of explanation,
feel free to share this with the visitors of your site maybe some of them
have also had and encounter similar to my own.</B>
<BR><B>It all started in the early 90's(around late 92 or early 93) when
I was pregnant for my second child.&nbsp; I awoke one night and felt something
warm running down my arm and a horrible stinging there.&nbsp; I tried to
move but was unable to and when I tried to speek to my husband I was unable
to speak. I felt a tremendous weight on my chest and was short of breath.
This lastest about 2 minutes and I was horrified when it was over and I
was able to get my husbands attention.&nbsp; He turned on the light and
there were three fine scratches on my arm(about the size a cat would make.......but
we dont have any cats) and blood was running from the wounds as if my arm
was laid wide open. I cleaned the wound and it stopped bleading after a
minute or so leaving on three thin lines.&nbsp; My husbands explanation
for it was I scratched myself(but I have no fingernails and I tried to
make marks on myself and was unsucessful).&nbsp; This happend 4 or 5 more
times over the course of the next year and a half each time leaving more
scratches than before and yet he stuck to his explanation of the wounds
being self inflicted. One night several months after what (to this very
day) was my last episode I awoke to my husband cursing and I asked what
was wrong, he turned on the light and his chest was covered in the same
fine scratches that I had supposedly inflicted on myself. I couldnt help
but say it after his year or so of disbeleif and I asked if he thought
I had done this to him, he simply replied I'm sorry.&nbsp; There are four
of us in our house and thank god the kids have never had an insident like
this and my husband an I have not had another encounter( and we hope we
never do!) , although we have had a few strange things happen in the house
that we cant explain and who knows why they happen but on the two occasions
that we spoke of "ghosts" in recent months strange things have happened!.&nbsp;
If you are interested in hearing anymore of our stories I would be happy
to share them with you.</B>

<BR><B>I See Them Everywhere</B>

<P><B>By: Starfire360@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Everywhere i go i see spirits.&nbsp; My grandfather died in our family
home 14 years ago (i was almost four ) my mother, sister and i weren't
living here at the time but when i would come down here i would get the
sense he was still in the house. For a while after we moved back in five
years ago i didn't sense him,&nbsp; i thought he had moved on. Until about
a year ago when i was alone in the house. I heard knocking on the front
door, when i awnsered it there wasn't anyone there. When i turned around
i saw him standing in the hallway by the room he slept in. A chill ran
through me, i stood there watching him until he disappeared. I ran past
where he had stood to get to my room and stayed there until everyone returned
home.&nbsp; The only person i told about him was my sister who i knew would
believe me.&nbsp; I didn't see him or any other spirits for a couple of
months after that. My next encounter was at the house my aunt was living
in at the time. Everyone was outside, i was dozing on the couch when i
sensed someone run through the house. I jumped up to see who it was nobody
was there after searching the house i went outside to see where everyone
was they were about 15 feet from the house. When i told my aunt about the
encounter her face paled, she then told me her friend who lived in the
house before her had told her of a man who was building on the house had
died in the upstairs bedroom. That night she wouldn't let me leave, she
didn't want to be in the house alone. After she went to bed i was online
chating with my sister, when i sensed him again, i looked over and saw
him he was pacing up and down the stairs, so i got off the computer and
went to bed.&nbsp; A couple of weeks later my aunt was in a car accident,&nbsp;
she was so sore she could barely move so i agreed to care for her until
she was better.&nbsp; Cleaning around the house i kept seeing him walking
around he was always in the room with me, after a while i got used to him
and sometimes i thought i would hear him say something but never could
understand the words.&nbsp; Shortly after that she moved in with her boyfriend.&nbsp;
When i was helping her move in to her new house i kept senseing someone
in the upstairs, i would look to the stairs from time to time and would
see a man standing there with an angry expression on his face.&nbsp; I
would also see buster her boyfriends dog, who was killed in a drunken rage
by someone they knew.&nbsp; I didn't say anything about them for a while.
When i did ask if they knew of a man dying in the house i was told of the
boyfriends father having a heart attack in the house and dying shortly
after in the hospital.&nbsp; I haven't had much contact with the spirit
since then but do know he is still there.&nbsp; That was a couple of months
ago and lately i have been seeing spirits everywhere just about all of
them i do not know.&nbsp; They seem to be drawn to me. They approach me
when i go outside at night, they come in the house but never stay long
and most of them i never see again. I can hear them sometimes and most
just come to say hi.&nbsp; But there are some children on my property they
show themselvs alot. They seem to be from a time long ago, they show themselvs
as being happy, and they show themselvs as being burnt badly. After my
first encounter with them i have stared to notice the smell of buring wood
when they are around, sometime i will hear banging under the my bedroom
floor. Late at night I can sometimes hear them scream, this still chills
me i don't think i will ever get used to the sound.&nbsp; On the night
of the full moon if i go outside and look toward the house i will see not
my house but theirs and i can see them in it.&nbsp; Maybe i'll have more
stories to share later.</B>
<BR><B>Bye for now:)</B>

<BR><B>Just A Few Stories</B>

<P><B>By: poolejo@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Hi, i am 15 and already had quite a few experiences, some good and
some bad. Let me tell you something that was really strange first, my grandparents
died 2 weeks between each other, my grandma first, then my grandpa. After
the day my grandma died, a duck (she loved ducks) came to their swimming
pool everyday, but the day my grandpa died, the duck never came back.</B>
<BR><B>My first experience happened when i was in the room my grandma died
in. I had a strange feeling that i did'nt want to sleep in there, but i
had to anyway. When i was about to go to sleep, my dog Zac started barking
at something, but i was too scared to even open my eyes under the covers.
That barking went on for about 1 hour, then stopped for 3 or 4 hours, then
started again for about another hour. All that time i was boiling hot and
sweaty under a thick doona, but too scared to pull the doona off. I knew
me and Zac weren't alone in that room that night, and i've never heard
Zac bark or growl like that ever since. My second experience happened when
my mum got a very old piano, which i definitely knew was haunted. I&nbsp;
woke up about 2:45am to go to the toilet, which is right near the piano,
i was walking down the stairs and i heard the piano playing, i turned the
corner (you would not believe what happened next) and i still heard the
music playing from the piano, BUT THE KEYS ON THE PIANO WEREN'T EVEN MOVING
! ! ! !</B>
<BR><B>I watched the piano for about 5 seconds, all the time it was playing
something like an evil Beethoven, but i could'nt believe the keys weren't
moving, then it stopped (yes i checked every radio in the house, but the
music was definitely coming from the piano). With the piano came 1 more
bone-chilling experience, 1 time i was home alone with my 2 dogs, i was
about to give them dinner, then they ran out of the house and did'nt even
want it, so i had to give it to them outside. When i came back inside i
immediately froze and felt something evil walk past me and say "i own this
home, and i'll never leave it".</B>
<BR><B>I quickly phoned my aunty and got picked up along with my 2 scared
shirtless dogs and went to her house. She is a psychic and definitely felt
something evil within that piano, 1 week later my mum sold the piano (Thank
God ! !).</B>
<BR><B>My last 2 experiences were good, they were with my grandma and grandpa.
It was exactly 2yrs after my grandma died, i was about to get to sleep,
when i felt someone sit at the end of my bed, then i heard her say in her
beautiful voice "its o.k. i will always look over you and your mother",
after that i said i missed her alot then she left. My grandpa loved playing
golf, same with me. I was getting ready for the junior club championship
and i could'nt find my clubs, then i remembered i left them at my families
holiday home which was a 3hr drive away. I&nbsp; was about to change clothes
because i could'nt go to the junior championship, then i found my grandpa's
golfclubs lying right beside my closet, which was impossible to be there
because they were last seen at my auntys house 1/2 a year ago. I came second
in the championship and i believed that my grandpa was there to help me
the whole time.</B>
<BR><B>I loved my grandparents very much and i still do, and grandma stills
looks after me and mum, and my grandpa helps me at the golf course. Well
thats my few experiences, and if you have anything to say about them, you
can e-mail me at: poolie27@hotmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you
can choose to believe me or not, but i know these experiences are very
true</B>

<BR><B>Followed Home</B>

<P><B>By: lnewman@smcoe.k12.ca.us</B>

<P><B>I've always been interested in ghosts and hauntings.&nbsp; I have
a vague</B>
<BR><B>memory of seeing what looked like illuminated mist in a dark room</B>
<BR><B>when I was very young, but the first time I saw something that I</B>
<BR><B>thought was 100% freaky was when I was about 19.&nbsp; The year
before,</B>
<BR><B>when I was 18, I had to visit a cemetery in a city called Colma.</B>
<BR><B>Colma's residents are outnumbered by the dead.&nbsp; It is mainly
a</B>
<BR><B>cemetery town, with the graves dating all the way back to the early</B>
<BR><B>1800's.&nbsp; I had to visit a fancy cemetery for the rich and famous
of</B>
<BR><B>Victorian era San Francisco.&nbsp; I really enjoyed walking through
the</B>
<BR><B>cemetery, and that night when I got home I had a strange feeling
that</B>
<BR><B>I was not alone, like something had followed me home.&nbsp; It was
scary,</B>
<BR><B>but I didn't feel like I was in danger.</B>
<BR><B>As the months passed, weird things started to happen, but nothing</B>
<BR><B>that I could deem paranormal.&nbsp; Everything seemed to have a
logical</B>
<BR><B>explanation.&nbsp; Random green flashes of light in the kitchen
and living</B>
<BR><B>room, the oven turning off, the radio turning on, a radio falling</B>
<BR><B>from a shelf at 3 a.m. and switching on, cold spots in my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom...they all could be explained by something or another when
I</B>
<BR><B>would frantically report them to my family and friends.&nbsp; Sometimes,</B>
<BR><B>in the hallway or in my bedroom, I would smell the most delicious</B>
<BR><B>frangrance, like flowers.&nbsp; It was very rich, and almost humid,
like</B>
<BR><B>steam.&nbsp; The minute I would notice it and try to take a big
sniff, it</B>
<BR><B>would disappear.</B>
<BR><B>One night I went to the library and picked up a book on witchcraft</B>
<BR><B>for a report I was working on.&nbsp; I went home, and lit a brand
new</B>
<BR><B>candle I bought, and just as I opened the book, the candle went
out</B>
<BR><B>suddenly with a loud FOOM!&nbsp; I went AHH!,&nbsp; closed the book,
and threw</B>
<BR><B>in behind my bed.&nbsp; The library didn't get that book back for</B>
<BR><B>awhile...stupid late fees.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, back to the 100% freakiness - It was about 1 or 2 in the</B>
<BR><B>morning.&nbsp; I was settling down to go to sleep.&nbsp; It was
pitch black in</B>
<BR><B>the bedroom I shared with my sister when I was living at home.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>bed was right next to 2 windows, and eerie moonlight made the air</B>
<BR><B>glow in the backyard.&nbsp; I used to sit and stare at this one
bright</B>
<BR><B>star in the sky before I went to bed each night.&nbsp; I felt like
it was</B>
<BR><B>my recently deceased grandmother watching over the house.&nbsp;
For some</B>
<BR><B>reason, I just happened to glance into the back yard for a moment.</B>
<BR><B>Then all of a sudden out of nowhere these 2 yellow balls of light</B>
<BR><B>appeared, swirled around, and then disappeared.&nbsp; This freaked
me out</B>
<BR><B>majorly.&nbsp; First I thought it was someone snooping around in
the</B>
<BR><B>backyard with a flashlight, but I didn't see anyone, and flashlights</B>
<BR><B>wouldn't create orbs like that.&nbsp; I practically peed in my little</B>
<BR><B>pajama pants I was so scared.&nbsp; I dove under the covers and
eventually</B>
<BR><B>fell asleep.&nbsp; I didn't tell anyone the next day because I was
still</B>
<BR><B>too scared to even think about it, and still couldn't beleive what
I</B>
<BR><B>saw.&nbsp; About a year later I told a friend at work.&nbsp; He
told me that</B>
<BR><B>what I experienced sounded like the orb phenomenon.&nbsp; Freakyness.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>have since moved out on my own and no longer experience any</B>
<BR><B>weirdness.&nbsp; I don't think I was ever in any danger, but boy
howdy,</B>
<BR><B>was I ever scared!</B>

<P><B>FOUNDER’S&nbsp; CEMETERY</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>From:&nbsp; Robert&nbsp; Garner,</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>My&nbsp; girlfriend&nbsp; and&nbsp; I,&nbsp; went&nbsp; on&nbsp;
a&nbsp; ghost&nbsp; hunting&nbsp; tour&nbsp; here&nbsp; in&nbsp; Houston.</B>
<BR><B>We&nbsp; visited&nbsp; several&nbsp; places&nbsp; that&nbsp; were&nbsp;
said&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; haunted&nbsp; and&nbsp; took&nbsp; our&nbsp;
35mm&nbsp; cam’s&nbsp; with&nbsp; high&nbsp; speed&nbsp; film&nbsp; and&nbsp;
electric&nbsp; magnetic&nbsp; meters&nbsp; with&nbsp; us.&nbsp; One&nbsp;
of&nbsp; the&nbsp; stops&nbsp; was&nbsp; an&nbsp; old&nbsp; San&nbsp; Jacinto&nbsp;
Burial&nbsp; Ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; was&nbsp; called&nbsp; Founder’s&nbsp;
Cemetery.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; called&nbsp; Founders&nbsp; because&nbsp;
there&nbsp; are&nbsp; two&nbsp; people&nbsp; buried&nbsp; there&nbsp; that&nbsp;
“founded”&nbsp; Houston,&nbsp; but&nbsp; what&nbsp; makes&nbsp; this&nbsp;
cemetery&nbsp; so&nbsp; unique&nbsp; is&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; are&nbsp;
850&nbsp; bodies&nbsp; buried&nbsp; there&nbsp; and&nbsp; only&nbsp; 75&nbsp;
headstones.&nbsp; Well&nbsp; I&nbsp; had&nbsp; this&nbsp; serious&nbsp;
vibe&nbsp; about&nbsp; a&nbsp; particular&nbsp; headstone,&nbsp; so&nbsp;
I&nbsp; started&nbsp; reading&nbsp; the&nbsp; epithet&nbsp; on&nbsp; it&nbsp;
out&nbsp; loud,&nbsp; it&nbsp; read,&nbsp; “Robert&nbsp; W&nbsp; Montgomery”&nbsp;
a&nbsp; member&nbsp; of&nbsp; Captain&nbsp; Henry&nbsp; Teal’s&nbsp; company&nbsp;
of&nbsp; regulars&nbsp; at&nbsp; San&nbsp; Jacinto,&nbsp; died&nbsp; in&nbsp;
Houston&nbsp; June&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1837.&nbsp; This&nbsp; meant&nbsp; that&nbsp;
he&nbsp; fought&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Battle&nbsp; for&nbsp; Independence&nbsp;
of&nbsp; Texas&nbsp; at&nbsp; San&nbsp; Jacinto.</B>
<BR><B>I&nbsp; had&nbsp; already&nbsp; cleaned&nbsp; up&nbsp; around&nbsp;
his&nbsp; marker,&nbsp; picking&nbsp; pieces&nbsp; of&nbsp; paper&nbsp;
and&nbsp; some&nbsp; trash.&nbsp; I&nbsp; then&nbsp; said&nbsp; out&nbsp;
loud,&nbsp; “Robert,&nbsp; I&nbsp; want&nbsp; you&nbsp; to&nbsp; come&nbsp;
out&nbsp; because&nbsp; I&nbsp; want&nbsp; to&nbsp; tell&nbsp; you&nbsp;
how&nbsp; proud&nbsp; I&nbsp; am&nbsp; of&nbsp; you”&nbsp; I&nbsp; really&nbsp;
meant&nbsp; it&nbsp; because&nbsp; the&nbsp; World&nbsp; Trade&nbsp; Centre&nbsp;
tragedy&nbsp; had&nbsp; only&nbsp; happened&nbsp; four&nbsp; days&nbsp;
earlier,&nbsp; so&nbsp; I&nbsp; really&nbsp; genuinely&nbsp; felt&nbsp;
very&nbsp; patriotic.&nbsp; When&nbsp; I&nbsp; had&nbsp; finished&nbsp;
saying&nbsp; this,&nbsp; the&nbsp; hair&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; back&nbsp;
of&nbsp; my&nbsp; neck&nbsp; felt&nbsp; like&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; standing&nbsp;
on&nbsp; end&nbsp; and&nbsp; I&nbsp; felt&nbsp; tingling&nbsp; through&nbsp;
my&nbsp; hands&nbsp; and&nbsp; shoulders.&nbsp; When&nbsp; this&nbsp; happened&nbsp;
I&nbsp; told&nbsp; Debbie,&nbsp; my&nbsp; girlfriend,&nbsp; to&nbsp; snap&nbsp;
a&nbsp; picture&nbsp; while&nbsp; I&nbsp; was&nbsp; standing&nbsp; next&nbsp;
to&nbsp; the&nbsp; headstone.&nbsp; We&nbsp; milled&nbsp; around&nbsp;
in&nbsp; the&nbsp; cemetery&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; few&nbsp; more&nbsp;
minutes&nbsp; and&nbsp; then&nbsp; we&nbsp; all&nbsp; got&nbsp; back&nbsp;
on&nbsp; this&nbsp; bus&nbsp; and&nbsp; went&nbsp; to&nbsp; other&nbsp;
spots.</B>
<BR><B>When&nbsp; I&nbsp; got&nbsp; my&nbsp; film&nbsp; developed,&nbsp;
I&nbsp; noticed&nbsp; on&nbsp; that&nbsp; particular&nbsp; picture,&nbsp;
there&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; “face”&nbsp; between&nbsp; my&nbsp; blue&nbsp;
jeans&nbsp; and&nbsp; my&nbsp; right&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; there&nbsp; were&nbsp;
also&nbsp; little&nbsp; “orbs”&nbsp; around&nbsp; my&nbsp; hand&nbsp; where&nbsp;
the&nbsp; face&nbsp; was,&nbsp; I&nbsp; was&nbsp; totally&nbsp; ecstatic,&nbsp;
I&nbsp; mean&nbsp; I&nbsp; completely&nbsp; freaked&nbsp; out&nbsp; and&nbsp;
went&nbsp; straight&nbsp; to&nbsp; a&nbsp; place&nbsp; called&nbsp; Kinko’s&nbsp;
to&nbsp; have&nbsp; this&nbsp; portion&nbsp; enlarged.&nbsp; When&nbsp;
it&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; done,&nbsp; you&nbsp; could&nbsp; see&nbsp;
it&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; “face”&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; “old&nbsp;
man”&nbsp; with&nbsp; battle&nbsp; type&nbsp; hat&nbsp; on&nbsp; his&nbsp;
head,&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; behind&nbsp; me&nbsp; because&nbsp;
the&nbsp; face&nbsp; overlaps&nbsp; my&nbsp; jeans&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp;
back&nbsp; drop&nbsp; behind&nbsp; was&nbsp; completely&nbsp; dark.&nbsp;
The&nbsp; orbs,&nbsp; which&nbsp; I&nbsp; counted&nbsp; four&nbsp; of,&nbsp;
are&nbsp; actually&nbsp; entering&nbsp; my&nbsp; hand&nbsp; and&nbsp; as&nbsp;
they&nbsp; enter&nbsp; they&nbsp; change&nbsp; colour,&nbsp; they&nbsp;
go&nbsp; from&nbsp; bright&nbsp; white&nbsp; outside&nbsp; my&nbsp; body&nbsp;
to&nbsp; burning&nbsp; gold&nbsp; as&nbsp; they&nbsp; enter&nbsp; my&nbsp;
hand.&nbsp; The&nbsp; face&nbsp; which&nbsp; is&nbsp; extremely&nbsp; visible&nbsp;
shows&nbsp; his&nbsp; eyes,&nbsp; his&nbsp; nose,&nbsp; his&nbsp; forehead&nbsp;
and&nbsp; mouth.&nbsp; His&nbsp; mouth&nbsp; is&nbsp; open&nbsp; as&nbsp;
if&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; giving&nbsp; me&nbsp; his&nbsp; best&nbsp; battle&nbsp;
cry.</B>
<BR><B>My&nbsp; interpretation&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; picture&nbsp;
is,&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; astounded&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp;
was&nbsp; publicly&nbsp; eulogized,&nbsp; like&nbsp; I&nbsp; had&nbsp;
done&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; someone&nbsp; took&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp;
to&nbsp; recognize&nbsp; him,&nbsp; being&nbsp; buried&nbsp; in&nbsp; a&nbsp;
paupers&nbsp; grave&nbsp; as&nbsp; he&nbsp; was,&nbsp; he&nbsp; probably&nbsp;
died&nbsp; and&nbsp; could&nbsp; not&nbsp; leave.&nbsp; I&nbsp; truly&nbsp;
think&nbsp; I&nbsp; set&nbsp; him&nbsp; free !</B>

<BR><B>Friends and Foes</B>

<P><B>By: Kiutupy@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been reading many of the stories on this
page.&nbsp; Some of them are</B>
<BR><B>similar to experiences I have had, but there are a few I should
share.&nbsp; Ever</B>
<BR><B>since I was an infant, I have had encounters with the unexplained.&nbsp;
One of my</B>
<BR><B>first baby-sitters told me that while I lay in my crib, I reached
out to</B>
<BR><B>something above me.&nbsp; She says that I was coo-ing as though
I was being played</B>
<BR><B>with by someone.&nbsp; When we lived in the mountains of California,
just outside</B>
<BR><B>of Bear Valley, I can remember playing with invisable entities.&nbsp;
Some of them</B>
<BR><B>were little girls, and some were little boys.&nbsp; They would stay
with me until</B>
<BR><B>I were with an adult.&nbsp; They never came inside our house, but
they would walk</B>
<BR><B>with me to the door.&nbsp; They played with me at school, but never
went inside.</B>
<BR><B>When I fell, severing my kneecap, there was a maternal presence
with me as</B>
<BR><B>they poured iodine and dis-infectant all over my leg.&nbsp; She
had her hand</B>
<BR><B>around mine, and her arm was resting on my shoulder; she whispered
reassuring</B>
<BR><B>and pleasant things in my ears.&nbsp; After we moved to Santa Cruz,
I began to see</B>
<BR><B>figures walking along the street.&nbsp; They were mostly benevolent,
but a few</B>
<BR><B>were threatening.&nbsp; Somehow, there has always been someone watching
over me,</B>
<BR><B>and I am constantly protected.&nbsp; A few times, I have been attacked
by beings</B>
<BR><B>no one else could see.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After my family decided to take a train trip
across America, I began to</B>
<BR><B>realize what I was experiencing.&nbsp; In the fields we passed in
the south, I</B>
<BR><B>could see hundreds of figures in pre-civil war garb stooped over
gathering</B>
<BR><B>cotton into large sacks.&nbsp; They seemed to hover outside the
windows, that were</B>
<BR><B>eight feet off the ground.&nbsp; All the places we visited in the
south had eerie</B>
<BR><B>feelings and soothing feelings to them.&nbsp; I was frightened to
go through the</B>
<BR><B>old battle fields, only because there were so many people walking
around.&nbsp; A</B>
<BR><B>few men I saw were digging for something, they looked at me pleadingly,
and I</B>
<BR><B>knew that they were telling me that they were buried there, far
away from</B>
<BR><B>their homes.&nbsp; In one of the houses we stayed in, a group of
period servants</B>
<BR><B>(period as in early victorian) were bustling about after dark.&nbsp;
They were the</B>
<BR><B>same servants I saw in the picture the owners had on their office
wall.&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>didn't go into the office until the day we left, so I never knew
what it was</B>
<BR><B>that I was seeing every night.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of my friends jokingly tell me that I have
a 6th sense.&nbsp; I guess it</B>
<BR><B>could be true.&nbsp; Everywhere I go I see them.&nbsp; They show
up every place I go,</B>
<BR><B>and I can hear their words.&nbsp; My most frequent visitor is on
old hag.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>tucks me in every night.&nbsp; "Good night, poppet.&nbsp; Angels
protect your dreams."</B>
<BR><B>I know she was a nanny, she has followed me to every house we have
ever lived</B>
<BR><B>in.&nbsp; I love her dearly, and I believe that is why she stays
with me.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>wakes me if there is danger, and soothes me when I am ill.&nbsp;
I am now 21, but</B>
<BR><B>she is still sitting at the foot of my bed at night with her knitting</B>
<BR><B>needles.&nbsp; I have never found out her history, and I don't want
to.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever I visit the local cemetaries, I hear
garbled voices from</B>
<BR><B>overgrown tombstones.&nbsp; Every now and then, I go to clear off
the headstones</B>
<BR><B>and trim the foliage.&nbsp; Infants and adults alike, they all greet
me with</B>
<BR><B>smile.&nbsp; Expecially the elderly.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not making any of this up.&nbsp; there are
things out there we cannot</B>
<BR><B>explain.&nbsp; I believe that I am blessed to see them, and I do
all that I can to</B>
<BR><B>be friendly towards them and show them some affecion.&nbsp; I love
visiting</B>
<BR><B>haunted houses because of the friends that can be made there.</B>

<BR><B>Ghost Experience</B>

<P><B>By: dbirkes@firstsb.com</B>

<P><B>To understand my experience I first need to give you a little information.&nbsp;
My friend and her fiance live in a nice apartment.&nbsp; Many times he
is out of town and I will stay with her at night when he is gone.&nbsp;
She has always felt that there was something in the apartment.&nbsp; Her
cat acts strangely and she has encounters with whatever it is.&nbsp; But
whenever her fiance is there she never feels bothered by it.&nbsp; Well
there were several times when I have been spending the night and strange
things happened.&nbsp; The door to her entertainment center would open
and bang shut over and over again even when I was watching it, and it was
the kind where you had to push in before it would pop open.&nbsp; Anyway
I had always felt weired in the apartment but had never really 'seen' anything
aparitions.&nbsp; This all changed when my friend was fed up and told the
entity to leave her alone and go away.&nbsp; Well it has never physically
bothered her since but it didn't go away.&nbsp; In fact after that it became
more bothersome to me.&nbsp; The night in question was just a regular one.&nbsp;
I came over after work and we watched some movies and then we decided to
go to bed.&nbsp; She went to the bedroom with the cat and I stayed on the
sofa.&nbsp; My friend had left the light on to the downstairs and I got
up to go turn it off.&nbsp; As soon as I turned off the light it was like
something in the dark moved in on me from all sides.&nbsp; The atmosphere
became opressive and I was on edge.&nbsp; I went back and layed on the
couch and tried to go to sleep.&nbsp; It didn't seem like a long time had
passed when I was woke up by a loud humming in my ears.&nbsp; I became
aware of it but I didn't open my eyes right away.&nbsp; It was like someone
humming very loudly a very old song that I didn't know the words to.&nbsp;
My first thought was that it was my friend playing a joke on me.&nbsp;
I was about to look up and tell her to cut it out but then I just 'knew'
it was not her and I looked up and there was this tall black misty figure
leaning over me.&nbsp; It was very tall, solid black but at the same time
vaporous.&nbsp; Of course you are going to say well it was dark in the
room.&nbsp; Well yes but your eyes adjust to the darkness of the room and
you can still see the outline of objects.&nbsp; This thing was seperate
from everything else.&nbsp; It was a denser darkness inside of a softer
darkness.&nbsp; It was standing directly behind the arm of the couch.&nbsp;
It was standing bent over at the waist looking into my face.&nbsp; As soon
as I saw the figure the humming stopped.&nbsp; My first instinct was to
put my arms over my face and bury myself deeper into the couch.&nbsp; I
have never felt that type of fear before.&nbsp; I was wide awake and I
could feel the thing behind me, still leaning over me.&nbsp; I could barely
breath and I was to afraid to move.&nbsp; Finally after about fifteen minutes
or so I just jumped up and darted to her bedroom and woke her up.&nbsp;
But the wierd thing is that as soon as I crossed the threshold of her bedroom
door I felt okay.&nbsp; It was like it couldn't come through but I could
sense it was still out there.&nbsp; I woke my friend up and told her what
happened.&nbsp; She had been sound asleep and there was no way it could
have been her or anyone else because the back of the couch is flat against
a wall with one end pushed up against another wall and the other end has
a large end table pushed up next to it with a large lamp on it.&nbsp; That
was the end where my head was and no could stand directly behind me because
of the end table.&nbsp; Needless to say I haven't spent the night since
but I probably will sometime soon.&nbsp; Although I doubt if I will be
sleeping out in the living room.</B>

<BR><B>Paranormal Experience</B>

<P><B>By: Louise.Evans3@btopenworld.com</B>

<P><B>I am a twenty five year old man and I believe that, as a ten year
old, I had a paranormal experience. I am a cynical, sceptical person with
a firmly rational perspective of the world yet I am still unable to explain
the event that I witnessed.</B>
<BR><B>I was at a place called Looe in Cornwall (the U.K.) and was enjoying
a weekend camping with a youth club I was once a member of. At the bottom
of the field there was an old derelict house that was used by a local farmer
for storing potatoes. Our group leader took us down to see it and began
to tell us the history of the building. I later learned that this was true.
Evidently, the house was once owned by a woman who lost both her sons in
The First World War and she died two weeks after she learnt that her sons
had been killed at The Battle of The Somme. Our leader told us that he
often saw ghostly figures, at night, walking around the bottom of the field.
Whether this part of the story was true, I do not know but I suspect that
it was invented by the leader to give a group of young boys a fright. It
seemed like harmless fun. The leader told us that these figures were human
shaped and consisted of bodies that were like the smoke from cigarettes.</B>
<BR><B>As he told this story he whispered to me to sneek outside and bang
on the window as a practical joke.</B>
<BR><B>I did this but before I knocked on the window, the glass cracked
right up the middle and made a noise I will never forget. It sounded like
lightning, a whipping, cracking sound. Naturally, everyone ran out of the
house and back up the hill. Afterwards the leader chastised me for breaking
the window but when I told him that I hadn't even touched the window he
looked white and told me that, when he was running out of the building
he felt a gentle force attempting to keep him inside.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know if this was a coincidence. The fact that I don't know
has always confused me.</B>
<BR><B>I have never had another experience like that.</B>

<BR><B>Ghost House</B>

<P><B>By: CooleyJG@navair.navy.mil</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you know that I'm crazy but
this happen about 1978. One night</B>
<BR><B>my friends and I were getting ready to go to a school dance and
we decided</B>
<BR><B>to go to an abandon house to have a few beers then go to the dance.
This</B>
<BR><B>house sits off a county road. The family who owned left the area.
we we</B>
<BR><B>arrived at the house, we checked all the doors and windows and they
were al</B>
<BR><B>locked. Ten suddenly one of my friends said that he saw a light
inside the</B>
<BR><B>house and we thought he was playing a joke on us. So we all went
to the</B>
<BR><B>house and sure enough there was a light on in this house. Go figure
lights</B>
<BR><B>on with no electricity. Well we blew it off as a joke.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on before we started drinking, we
decide if the light was still</B>
<BR><B>on, so we went back and took a look. What we saw will stay with
me forver.</B>
<BR><B>We looked in to the living room window and saw a small fire in the
middle of</B>
<BR><B>the room and there were 7 figures dressed in black robe with red
linings</B>
<BR><B>dancing and saying some word that we couldn't understand. We stood
there</B>
<BR><B>amazed and scared sh--less.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Suddenly one of said lets get the hell out of here, so we
all ran and got</B>
<BR><B>in our cars and left. The next morning my friend and I went back
to the</B>
<BR><B>house and looked in the same window and saw no evidence of anything
being</B>
<BR><B>wrong and the doors and windows were still locked. The house is
now torn</B>
<BR><B>down and no one else had this experience. I have another story but
it can</B>
<BR><B>wait. Let me know if anyone had an experience like this.</B>

<P><B>The Blue Glass</B>

<P><B>By: dbm@freeze.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; When I was about five, my family lived in Durham, North Carolina.&nbsp;
My dad was attending medical school, and we lived in a small, old house.&nbsp;
I shared a room with my two brothers, and I slept on the top bunk.&nbsp;
One night, I awoke, and not understanding why, I rolled over to go back
to sleep.&nbsp; Upon doing this, I faced the doorway, and saw a young boy
standing there.&nbsp; He was betwen the age of me and my older brother
(about seven), but noticeably smaller.&nbsp; His face did look remarkeably
similar to my younger brother, though.&nbsp; He wore a green, blue, and
red collared shirt, and in his hands he held a blue glass full of some
liquid, I assume water.&nbsp; I wasn't especially scared, but I was frozen,
and for some time I just stared at him, and he stared right back.&nbsp;
After about five minutes he suddenly dropped the glass.&nbsp; My eyes followed
the glass to the ground, where it shattered.&nbsp; When I looked back up,
he was gone.&nbsp; I proceeded to huddle under my blankets for protection,
and eventually fell asleep.&nbsp; The next morning, I went to where the
apparition was, and there was a wet spot on the carpet.&nbsp; I also found
two shards of blue glass.&nbsp; Years later, I learned that my Mother had
experienced a miscarriage between my older brother and I.&nbsp; The brother
I never met would have been right about the same age as the ghost I saw,
but the blue glass of water has never made any sense.</B>

<BR><B>Handprints</B>

<P><B>By: mcisneros@cprk.net</B>

<P><B>Well, here is my story. My family and I moved into this house that
is owned by a priest who invited people over to say a prayer or two to
their loved ones who passed on. It all started with my father (who to this
day does not believe in ghosts) who heard paper crumble in the kitchen
while the rest of us were out. He kept going to the kitchen to see what
it was but saw nothing. A few days later, he awoke in the middle of the
night to find himself not being able to get up (like someone was trying
to hold him down). Then all of a sudden...he felt free. The creepiest event
happened to me. One night, our town had a terrible flood and the company
that we had that night could not leave. So my cousin and friend brought
out the Ouija board. My friend ask the spirit who he/she is. He replied
"John." Then she asked his age. He said 8. Then she asked why he was here.
He spelled out her. She asked "me?" He said no. The only female in the
room was me and my friend. So my friend said my name and he answered yes.
After that I left the room. Ever since that incident, I have been seeing
weird things around the house. One evening, my parents and I were eating
dinner while my brother was at work. From upstairs we heard someone jump
from my parent's bed and run into my bedroom. I have a little dog so my
mom thought it was him but then I look down and my dog was there. We all
looked at each other and said nothing. The next morning, I was in my closet
putting my shoes and realized small handprints on my mirror behind my closet
door. There are no kids in the house and if there are, they are not allowed
upstairs. I called out my mom so she can see what I saw. She was amazed.
A few weeks later, my brother's friend came over to put a light in my walk
in closet. We never told him what me or my mom saw. He left at the end
of the day. An hour later he came back to show me and my mom that he found
handprints on his windshield. My brother's friend does not have a kids
and he is the only one that drives that truck to work. When we saw the
handprints, my mom and I realized that they were the same handprints that
were on my mirror. One night my boyfriend and I fell asleep downstairs
on the couch. I was asleep on the love seet. My boyfriend on the long couch.
The next morning, we both found handprints on the coffeetable. These handprints
were the same one that I saw on my mirror and they were facing me as if
they were watching me sleep. My boyfriend then said that he remembered
waking up in the middle of the night to see a little boy at the edge of
the couch but he thought he was dreaming and went back to sleep. Till this
day, who ever goes into my room, hand prints will appear near them.</B>
