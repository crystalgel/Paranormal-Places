<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have never really experienced any "typical hauntings". but have some
 very </B>
<P><B>real " dreams. For instance, one night when I was about 7-8 years old,
 I </B>
<P><B>found myself in my driveway  in front of our house.My family was all
outside </B>
<P><B>but standing together by the garage door. The night itself seemed very
bright </B>
<P><B>and full of stars. Standing right if front of me was someone wearing
a </B>
<P><B>beautiful white robe holding a  white star in his hand. Now I don't
know if </B>
<P><B>this was an angel or spirit or what, but I do remember the feeling
that I </B>
<P><B>wanted to have this time all to my self. When I woke up to find myself
in bed </B>
<P><B>I was shocked! I FELT the pavement under my feet and how hot it is
on a </B>
<P><B>Florida summer night. Anyway my mother, being very spiritual  herself
said I </B>
<P><B>had been visited by an angel.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time my sister was at her friend's house playing with a Ouiga
board, </B>
<P><B>when all of a sudden, their Yorkie ran under the couch, a pizza carton
came </B>
<P><B>off the top of the refrigerator and that's when they put the board
away. </B>
<P><B>Later that night, I my sister had a flat tire  right after she left
the house </B>
<P><B>and I also had car trouble coming home from my hospital shift. Both
happened </B>
<P><B>around the same time. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I  know this is running on a bit but just one more. </B>
<P><B>My mom owns a retirement mobile home park, passed on from her parents.
My </B>
<P><B>uncle used to run it and lived in a room off of the main rec hall.
He died in </B>
<P><B>his sleep in that room and my cousin found him the next day. I never
really </B>
<P><B>felt any presence there until one night I was working out, doing areobics
</B>
<P><B>from a video tape. there were no lights on, save for the TV. Something
felt </B>
<P><B>like it was rushing up behind me, getting very, very close to my bacfk.
I </B>
<P><B>turned around several times to try and 'catch" it. Needless to say
the hair </B>
<P><B>on the bck of my neck was already on end. So, I told "it" that I could'nt
</B>
<P><B>take it anymore and I left. Since then I have'nt felt it again, although
I do </B>
<P><B>think it was my uncle who did'nt mean to scare me. Thanks for sticking
with my </B>
<P><B>long winded story.</B>

<P><B>Grandfather's Ring</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: llole@email.msn.com</B>
<P><B> Several months before this incident, my mother had given me a Knights
of Columbus ring that had </B>
<P><B>belonged to her grandfather, whom I had never met. I was on vacation
in the </B>
<P><B>Aderondack mountains with my parents, sleeping in an old cabin near
a </B>
<P><B>lake.The room that I was sleeping in had one window which was on the
</B>
<P><B>oppisite side of the room, a tree stood outside of it and the wind
was causing </B>
<P><B>one of its branches to bump the window. Though I knew it was the tree
</B>
<P><B>making the noise, and I had my father sleeping in the same room, I
was </B>
<P><B>terrified. It sounded as if someone was walking around our cabin, and
I </B>
<P><B>was convinced that there was someone out there. This kept me from sleeping
</B>
<P><B>most of the night. Around 3 AM I woke up terrified, </B>
<P><B>then something caught my eye at the foot of the other bed. My father
was </B>
<P><B>sound asleep, and as I looked towards the foot of the bed I saw an
older </B>
<P><B>man. Instantly I was calm, and unafraid. He was wearing a brown and
red </B>
<P><B>bathrobe with a rope belt. He was short, with a very gentle face, and
he had in </B>
<P><B>his hands what looked like a small bag of some kind. He was looking
</B>
<P><B>through it for something, which somehow I knew was a ring, then he
up looked at </B>
<P><B>me and smiled, after that I fell asleep. I told my mother the story,
and at </B>
<P><B>the time she just listened. After we arrived home she took out four
very </B>
<P><B>old pictures of men who all looked somewhat similar and asked me if
I had seen </B>
<P><B>any of them. I had, one of the pictures was of the old man that had
been </B>
<P><B>with me that night, it was my greatgrandfather.I knew then that </B>
<P><B>what he was looking for was his Knights of Columbus ring, and that
he was there </B>
<P><B>to let me know that he wanted me to have it. I keep his ring with me,
and I know </B>
<P><B>he is with me, protecting me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A True Account</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: AnyoneOO7@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I am currently an 18 year old male living in a small community in Ohio.
 The </B>
<P><B>following story happened to me when I was about ten years old.  At
the time I </B>
<P><B>was living with my grandmother because my mother's marriage had fallen
apart, </B>
<P><B>My stepfather was physically and emotionally abusive to me and my
stepbrother </B>
<P><B>and stepsister.  But that is beside the point.  The family that lived
across </B>
<P><B>the road from my grandparents had six children ranging in age from
1.5 yrs. </B>
<P><B>younger than me to infancy.  In the time I had been living with my
</B>
<P><B>grandparents I had become very good friends with this family and I
would </B>
<P><B>often stay outside late during the summer playing with their children.
 None </B>
<P><B>of us in the group had even the slightest interest in ghosts or anything
else </B>
<P><B>paranormal until a single encounter we had with something purely evil
one </B>
<P><B>summer night...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Sorry to stray from the subject again, but the layout of the area is
</B>
<P><B>important for this next part.  The road I lived on at the time was
a dead end </B>
<P><B>street, my house being the last one on the left and my friend's being
the </B>
<P><B>last on the right.  A shed was built right on the road, so there was
no place </B>
<P><B>for anything to pass through without being noticed.  There was also
a stone </B>
<P><B>wall holding up my front yard that is about 6.5 ft. above the road,
The </B>
<P><B>neighbor's house was also up from the road but there is a gradual slope
up to </B>
<P><B>their house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now on with the story...</B>
<P>
<P><B>We had been playing outside as usual and it was after 9pm (if my memory
</B>
<P><B>serves me correctly), and we were in the neighbor's yard (across the
road </B>
<P><B>from my house) when out of no where a black car appeared on the road
and was </B>
<P><B>driving towards our houses.  We thought nothing of this, because it
was dark </B>
<P><B>and it would have been easy to not notice a car right away and many
people </B>
<P><B>did not know that the road was a dead end.  Well, as soon as the car
started </B>
<P><B>coming a little closer, it took off straight at us, and started playing
this </B>
<P><B>(for lack of better wording) evil, satanic music, I have heard nothing
like </B>
<P><B>it before or since.  As this car is tearing up the road heading straight
for </B>
<P><B>us and rapidly gaining speed.  My friends and I start running for our
lives </B>
<P><B>(literally) towards the neighbor's house, we get to the kitchen window
of </B>
<P><B>their house, we still see the car but as it went under the streetlight
by the </B>
<P><B>wall of my yard, the car vanished into thin air.  Mind you, if the
car kept </B>
<P><B>going, it would have hit the shed, or if it went left, it would have
slammed </B>
<P><B>into the stone wall in plain view of where we were, and if ti went
right, it </B>
<P><B>would have went into the house we were in.  Normally I would have credited
</B>
<P><B>this entire incident to an overactive imagination, but when I went
out there </B>
<P><B>again the next morning, there were still fresh tire marks on the road
and in </B>
<P><B>the grass where the car came at us.  Any comments are welcome at </B>
<P><B>anyoneoo7@aol.com.  Any input would be very much appreciated.  I have
a </B>
<P><B>couple more incidents involving different members of my family at this
</B>
<P><B>location and one of my father's old houses but that is another time.</B>

<P><B>My Paranormal Experiences</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: donhunt@net-link.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>While I do not proclaim to be a writer in any way, shape, or form,
I</B>
<P><B>will do my best to relate to you experiences that I myself, my
family,</B>
<P><B>and my friends have all witnessed and will attest to be true.</B>
<P><B>My personal experiences began back in the late 1960's when my father
was</B>
<P><B>promoted to a position within his company that required that he spend</B>
<P><B>extended periods of time out of town. I was in Junior High School at</B>
<P><B>that time and was the first and only one up in the early morning</B>
<P><B>preparing for school while the rest of my family slept. My younger</B>
<P><B>brother and sister were attending Elementary School and their classes</B>
<P><B>began later in the morning, allowing our Mother to remain in bed and</B>
<P><B>awaken only in time to get them up and ready for school. Consequently
I</B>
<P><B>was, for all intents and purposes, alone in the house.</B>
<P><B>On one such morning shortly before Christmas vacation I was eating</B>
<P><B>breakfast at our kitchen table solely by the light of the small
portable</B>
<P><B>black and white television set sitting opposite me. Having lived in
the</B>
<P><B>northern regions of the country my entire life, I was used to
dressing,</B>
<P><B>eating, and walking to school in the winter morning darkness and I
made</B>
<P><B>it a point to turn on as few lights in the house as possible so as
not</B>
<P><B>to disturb the rest of my sleeping family. On this particular morning</B>
<P><B>however, due to the poor lighting conditions in the kitchen and, I
must</B>
<P><B>admit, my total lack of table etiquette at the time, I spilled some
milk</B>
<P><B>down the front of my shirt as I consumed my breakfast cereal. After</B>
<P><B>surveying the damage to my shirt front I decided a change of clothes</B>
<P><B>might be in order prior to my departure for school.</B>
<P><B>As I journeyed from the kitchen in the near total darkness of the
house</B>
<P><B>I concentrated my eyes on the floor in front of me to insure that I</B>
<P><B>didn't trip over one of my siblings many toys left from the previous</B>
<P><B>evening.  I made my way toward my bedroom at the end of the hallway
off</B>
<P><B>of the dining room and had to pass the bathroom prior to reaching my</B>
<P><B>destination. Just as I arrived at the bathroom doorway I heard a</B>
<P><B>rustling sound emanating directly from the open darkened entranceway.</B>
<P><B>Although my progress in the near total darkness was slow, I was
walking</B>
<P><B>immediately in front of the bathroom threshold at that moment and</B>
<P><B>instinctively raised my arms in an effort to keep from being run into
by</B>
<P><B>whoever it was emerging, half asleep I presumed, from the bathroom.
As I</B>
<P><B>looked up at that same instant I saw what I at first assumed to be
my</B>
<P><B>Mother in her nightgown emerging from the doorway. However, as I
stood</B>
<P><B>there startled, with my arms outstretched before me, I immediately</B>
<P><B>realized my mistake.</B>
<P><B>A translucent, somewhat radiant apparition passed through my rigid
arms</B>
<P><B>and, although I could not see any features per say, turned to face
me.</B>
<P><B>What I assumed to be my Mothers' somewhat flimsy nightgown was
actually</B>
<P><B>a gauzy ectoplasmic substance that seemed to sway silently in slow</B>
<P><B>motion as if by an invisible wind.  In retrospect I can only compare
it</B>
<P><B>somewhat to the ghostly apparitions portrayed in the movie
Poltergeist.</B>
<P><B>I was, at that particular moment, absolutely paralyzed with fear. 
My</B>
<P><B>arms, still propelled before me, had broken out in goose bumps
(although</B>
<P><B>I honestly do not recall noticing any unusual atmospheric or
temperature</B>
<P><B>changes in the hallway) and my voice refused to obey my commands to</B>
<P><B>scream. After what seemed to me to be an eternity I was finally able
to</B>
<P><B>regain some sense of composure and turned and ran as fast as I could</B>
<P><B>back into the kitchen.</B>
<P><B>Our home was equipped at that time with an intercom system that could</B>
<P><B>communicate with any given room in the house. I immediately turned
it on</B>
<P><B>and connected to my parents bedroom and awakened my Mother with my
new</B>
<P><B>found vocal abilities.</B>
<P><B>Of course, by the time she arose from bed and turned on the hallway</B>
<P><B>light there was nothing to be seen and I, according to her, had still</B>
<P><B>been half asleep when I had seen "my ghost".  She soon changed her
mind.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Shortly after my "encounter" my parents were attending a Christmas
party</B>
<P><B>at a local neighbors house and I was forced to baby-sit for my
younger</B>
<P><B>brother and sister. Not long after putting them to bed and making
sure</B>
<P><B>that they were asleep I decided to go downstairs into the basement
and</B>
<P><B>play my guitar so as not to awaken them. As I turned on the basement</B>
<P><B>lights, closed the stairway landing door behind me and proceeded about
a</B>
<P><B>third of the way down the steps I became aware of a strange sound</B>
<P><B>emanating from directly below me and to my right. It was a soft sound</B>
<P><B>and I immediately thought it to be the echo into the basement from
above</B>
<P><B>of my younger brother's or sister's footsteps. They had evidently
heard</B>
<P><B>me going downstairs and hadn't been asleep after all.  My forward</B>
<P><B>progress down the stairs as I was contemplating this took me to a
point</B>
<P><B>where I could see into the far reaches of the basement by turning my</B>
<P><B>head to the right and as I turned to head back upstairs it was then
that</B>
<P><B>I was able to identify where the sounds were actually coming from.</B>
<P><B>Every year we placed the empty Christmas decoration boxes in a pile
at</B>
<P><B>the bottom and to the right of the basement stairway.  As I was
turning</B>
<P><B>around on the stairway to return upstairs I noticed that three of the</B>
<P><B>boxes that had been sitting on top of the pile were strewn across the</B>
<P><B>basement floor closest to the wall opposite the stairway. As I stood</B>
<P><B>there trying to figure out how they had arrived there, the uppermost
box</B>
<P><B>on the remaining pile lifted, unaided, vertically into the air and
flew,</B>
<P><B>Frisbee style, across the basement hitting the opposite wall with
enough</B>
<P><B>force to dent the corner of the box and send the top flying.</B>
<P><B>I became a statue. I could not move. I distinctly remember thinking
that</B>
<P><B>if I didn't get back upstairs the stairway I was standing on was
going</B>
<P><B>to fold in on itself, becoming a slide, and I would be propelled</B>
<P><B>helplessly down into the basement and forced to play catch with
whatever</B>
<P><B>it was that was doing this. That did the trick.  I flew upstairs into</B>
<P><B>the kitchen, slammed the basement door closed, jammed a chair under
the</B>
<P><B>doorknob and telephoned my parents at our neighbors house and</B>
<P><B>recommended they come home post haste.  They were, of course,
reluctant</B>
<P><B>to leave due to anything less than an emergency so I, against my
better</B>
<P><B>judgment, conveyed to my Father what had just occurred. Approximately
10</B>
<P><B>minutes later every male in attendance at the Christmas party</B>
<P><B>accompanied my Father into the house and did a complete search of the</B>
<P><B>premises.  Finding nothing but some empty boxes scattered around on
the</B>
<P><B>basement floor, they jokingly made some comments regarding the
effects</B>
<P><B>of male puberty on the psyche, assured me everything was fine, and</B>
<P><B>returned to the party and their revelry. I returned to being scared
to</B>
<P><B>death.</B>
<P><B>Life, more or less, returned to normal until the following spring
when</B>
<P><B>one morning, as I was in the kitchen eating breakfast, my Mother came
in</B>
<P><B>and in an accusatory tone asked me if I had been "trying to scare
her"</B>
<P><B>knowing that my Dad was out of town. I was clueless. After repeatedly</B>
<P><B>asking her what it was she was talking about she reluctantly admitted</B>
<P><B>that strange things had been happening to her recently after she went
to</B>
<P><B>bed.  She claimed that soon after she settled in for the night she
would</B>
<P><B>feel someone or something "pawing" at the bottom of her bed and then</B>
<P><B>attempt to pull the covers off of her. By the time she was able to</B>
<P><B>locate and turn on her bedside light however there was no one there.</B>
<P><B>Considering my bedroom was directly across the hall from hers I was
the</B>
<P><B>likely culprit.  She also said that when she had to use the bathroom</B>
<P><B>during the night she would hear a male voice, the words were</B>
<P><B>indiscernible but she was sure it was male, coming from the</B>
<P><B>bathtub/shower as she was using the facilities. My bedroom closet</B>
<P><B>accessed the bathtub plumbing so, again, I was the likely culprit.
 I</B>
<P><B>did my best to console and convince her that it was just the strain
of</B>
<P><B>Dad being gone so often that was the cause but deep down I knew the</B>
<P><B>truth and deeper down I had to smile. I wasn't going crazy after all.</B>
<P><B>Strange little occurrences popped up on a regular basis after that
but</B>
<P><B>nothing remarkable to speak of so my Mom and I kept them to
ourselves.</B>
<P><B>That is until after I got married.</B>
<P><B>My wife and I moved to California shortly after we were married in
1974</B>
<P><B>and we quickly produced two fine children.  Our oldest, a boy,
followed</B>
<P><B>shortly thereafter by our daughter. My being in the service did not</B>
<P><B>allow us to maintain a lavish lifestyle and we were forced to live
in a</B>
<P><B>government subsidized apartment close to my duty station across the
bay</B>
<P><B>from San Francisco.  An unlikely place for paranormal activities to</B>
<P><B>occur you'd think.  I thought so too until they began to happen.</B>
<P><B>It began innocently enough.  My wife was the first one to notice that</B>
<P><B>every time anyone walked past a certain area in the entranceway to
our</B>
<P><B>apartment a gong would sound. And then the T.V. began changing
channels</B>
<P><B>all by itself.  Bear in mind this was when remote controls were
reserved</B>
<P><B>for the rich and we hardly qualified on that account.  The first real</B>
<P><B>disturbing event occurred in the summer of 1975.  My wife and I chose
to</B>
<P><B>sleep on the living room floor of our apartment because we wanted the</B>
<P><B>two kids to have their own bedrooms. Our couch served as a divider</B>
<P><B>between the dining area and the living area of the apartment and we</B>
<P><B>always made our bed directly in front of the couch.  The door leading</B>
<P><B>back into the bathroom and two bedrooms was directly behind the couch</B>
<P><B>and we kept the doorway to that area closed at night so as not to</B>
<P><B>disturb the kids. I am an insomniac, and one night shortly after my
wife</B>
<P><B>had fallen asleep I was reading a novel and thought I heard one of
the</B>
<P><B>kids get out of bed. I, naturally, went on Daddy Alert.  They were
both</B>
<P><B>toilet trained by that time and I assumed that whoever had gotten up
was</B>
<P><B>headed for the bathroom. I heard the familiar scape of their footy</B>
<P><B>pajama's on the apartments hardwood floors and resumed my reading.</B>
<P><B>However, instead of heading into the bathroom, the access door behind</B>
<P><B>the couch opened and once again I heard the familiar paddle of footy</B>
<P><B>pajama'd feet.  Laying on the floor, it was impossible for me to see</B>
<P><B>over the back of the couch so I simply laid my book on my chest and</B>
<P><B>looked toward the end of the couch awaiting their arrival.  The sound
of</B>
<P><B>the paddle of little feet on the hardwood floor increased to a
shuffle.</B>
<P><B>I propped myself up on my elbows in an effort to see over the back
of</B>
<P><B>the couch and as I did so the pace of the footfalls increased to that
of</B>
<P><B>a shuffling run.  Whoever was up should have made it around the end
of</B>
<P><B>the couch and into my arms by now but it sounded like they were
running</B>
<P><B>in a circle directly behind the couch.  As I threw the covers back
and</B>
<P><B>began to get up an awful guttural wailing began eminating from
directly</B>
<P><B>behind me.  It was other worldly.  A deep, resonant sound of absolute</B>
<P><B>agony that no child could vocalize or replicate filled the room. My</B>
<P><B>senses crystalized.  I was torn with emotions so deep that I cannot</B>
<P><B>adequately describe them. I forced myself to leap up to confront the</B>
<P><B>demon that was accosting one of my children.  As soon as I made my
feet</B>
<P><B>everything ceased. Absolute silence ensued.  I was dumbstruck.  I
raced</B>
<P><B>through the closed doorway into my daughters room.  She was unharmed
and</B>
<P><B>sound asleep.  I then flew across the narrow hallway into my sons
room.</B>
<P><B>He too was sleeping peacefully.  I was shaking uncontrollably by then</B>
<P><B>and immediately went in and awoke my wife and told her what had</B>
<P><B>happened. She said that she had heard something but thought it was
me</B>
<P><B>snoring.  She tried to assure me that I'd been dreaming.  But my</B>
<P><B>cigarette in the ashtray next to our bed had burned back less than
an</B>
<P><B>inch after I had put it down awaiting the arrival of what I thought
was</B>
<P><B>our awakened child and I was soaked in sweat. I wish it had been a</B>
<P><B>dream.</B>
<P>
<P><B>These are but a few of the many paranormal events that I, and those</B>
<P><B>close to me, have experienced. I will relay the remainder of them to
you</B>
<P><B>soon.</B>

<P><B>GHOST OR ANGEL?</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: LDon1169@aol.com</B>
<P><B>             </B>
<P>
<P><B>  Before I start I have to say that this is one  of the many</B>
<P><B>occurances that have happened to me or my family,especially of the
female </B>
<P><B>gender, since as  long as I can remember.</B>
<P>
<P><B> I used to lived in this house about 10 or11</B>
<P><B>years ago in a small town of Berlin, Maryland. It was my father-in-law's
</B>
<P><B>house which was left to him after his parents died, who had built and
lived </B>
<P><B>in the house. When my husband  and I got married we moved in and
immediately</B>
<P><B>I knew something was in there. My husband worked the graveyard shift
so I and </B>
<P><B>my infant son were alone at nights. It didn't bother me too much when
I got</B>
<P><B>use to it. Anyways, everynight I would hear furniture moving in the
upstairs </B>
<P><B>bedroom right above my room. There was no one in the room because we
never </B>
<P><B>used the upstairs at all except for storage.  All night and everynight
this</B>
<P><B>would go on. several times I got the nerve to investagate and nothing
would </B>
<P><B>be out of place and the noises would stop. Occasionally I would have
guest </B>
<P><B>spend the night and even they would hear the noises as well, so I know
I</B>
<P><B>wasn't going crazy. Unfortunately after about two years into my marrage
we </B>
<P><B>were having problems and I would have chest pains due to stress. I
got them </B>
<P><B>quite often and could do nothing more than take some asprin and  get
 some</B>
<P><B>rest. One  night I was getting pains so I did the norm. and went to
bed. I </B>
<P><B>had just gotten comfortable when the pain felt as if I couldn't take
it </B>
<P><B>anymore when I heard a woman's voice whisper softly above me, then
my body</B>
<P><B>began to feel a hot and cold sensation rush though my body. Then suddenly
</B>
<P><B>everything was quiet. For the very first time it was actually quiet
at </B>
<P><B>night.I felt great the pain was instantly gone. I went a couple weeks
pain </B>
<P><B>free. It was amazing because I wasn't scared like you would think,
just calm. </B>
<P><B>I don't exactly know who or what it was that helped me that night,but
I </B>
<P><B>suspected it had to be either a ghost or an angel.</B>
<P><B> That's it for this story, maybe I'll be</B>
<P><B>writing in another one.</B>

<P><B>A Few Extra Roomates</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: k7d@email.msn.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>This all took place about 3 years ago when I was 18. I had just moved
into a</B>
<P><B>new apartment with my best friend, and one of her co-workers. It was
a 2</B>
<P><B>bedroom, 2 bathroom on the second story in nice apparment complex in
Grand</B>
<P><B>Prairie, Texas (right between Dallas &amp; Ft. Worth), which was only
about 15</B>
<P><B>years old. Even though the apartment was very nice, it had an uneasy</B>
<P><B>feeling to it. Come to find out from one the neighbors that high dollar
drug</B>
<P><B>bust had happen a year before we moved (odd for this part of town)
and</B>
<P><B>before that a man had nearly beat his wife to death. Otherwise from
that, no</B>
<P><B>deaths had occured in there, but I have heard of places where
bad/good</B>
<P><B>things happen tend to leave bad/good feeling in the place. So I assumed
that</B>
<P><B>was the cause of the uneasiness. Until a few weeks later when both
roomates</B>
<P><B>took the graveyard shifts at their job. They would leave at 12pm at
night</B>
<P><B>and return at 8am in the morning, so I would lock the top bolt since
I was</B>
<P><B>the only girl there at the time and would be up before they got home.
 They</B>
<P><B>shared the master bedroom across the hall, so I essentially had my
own room</B>
<P><B>and bathroom.  I had fallen asleep shortly after they left only to
wake up</B>
<P><B>after the sound of the front door opening a foot step scuffing on the</B>
<P><B>carpet heading down the hallway. I laid frozen in bed trying to figure
out</B>
<P><B>how someone got in since I had locked the top bolt and that the were
no</B>
<P><B>trees close enough for someone to come through a  window. I quietly
slide</B>
<P><B>out of my bed and locked my bedroom door and grabbed my pepper spray
out my</B>
<P><B>purse. Ironically my bedroom phone wasn't working at the time because
I had</B>
<P><B>spilled water on it earlier that night. I must sat my door for what
seemed</B>
<P><B>like forever, but didn't hear anything else. So I got my courage up,
 opened</B>
<P><B>my door, and flicked the hall light on. To my own terror there muddy
foot</B>
<P><B>prints in the shape of cowboy boots (no one I knew) that seem to end
front</B>
<P><B>of my door. And even more so the front door was standing wide open.
I ran</B>
<P><B>and called  a friend and stayed at his house for the night. In the
morning I</B>
<P><B>reported it to apartment office and they agreed to have the sercurity
guard</B>
<P><B>keep an eye out for unusual characters, they felt no police report
was</B>
<P><B>needed since nothing was taken, and no one was harmed. It took a couple
of</B>
<P><B>days, but I pushed the incident out of my mind. The following week
it</B>
<P><B>reoccured, however there were no foot prints this time, so the
apparment</B>
<P><B>complex replaced the locks, thinking the others might be defected from
the</B>
<P><B>original "break in".  After that new occurances started, and I wasn't
the</B>
<P><B>only one to witness them. The next Sunday morning the water faucet
in the</B>
<P><B>master bedroom vanity would trun on full blast, then turn off, the
same with</B>
<P><B>the lights over the vanity, so naturally my two roomates ran in to
my room</B>
<P><B>and woke me up to go look at it, but no sooner than that did the
master</B>
<P><B>bedroom door slammed and we could hear muffled yelling, sounding like
a man</B>
<P><B>and a woman having an argument. Needless to say we wanted out of there,
but</B>
<P><B>the apartment  management would not let us break our lease, they must
have</B>
<P><B>thought we were crazy. Later the following week, a new 'spirit'
presented</B>
<P><B>itself(could had been the muddy foot prints) in my own room. At first
'he'</B>
<P><B>did not seem mean like the two arguing phatom voices, but none the
less, it</B>
<P><B>unnerved me. It happened when I was laying in bed sick, and I got the
wiff</B>
<P><B>of a man's colonge. Thinking that it did not smell like my
then-boyfriend's,</B>
<P><B>and the fact that he was at his grandmother's house that night, more
than a</B>
<P><B>hour away, I turned to see who was in my room. I could not see anyone
in the</B>
<P><B>dark, but suddenly I felt a cool hand on my fore head, as if tying
to</B>
<P><B>comfort me, then became very sleepy. In the morning I woke up feeling</B>
<P><B>better, but oddly sore on my hips, there were severally small bruises,
I was</B>
<P><B>horrified, and spent the next couple of nights on the couch. Then
nothing</B>
<P><B>happened for the next few months, besides the occasional light  and
the</B>
<P><B>water turning on/off, which we somewhat got use to. Then my 'visitor'</B>
<P><B>returned, I would be laying in bed, and would sometimes here somthing
clang</B>
<P><B>against the wrought iron frame of my canopy bed, and the aroma of the</B>
<P><B>mysterious colonge would fill my room. I could not move, and would
feel like</B>
<P><B>something was pressing down on top of me, and it felt like my hands
were</B>
<P><B>bounded. In the morning there would be the same brusies on my hips
and my</B>
<P><B>right breast would have a light stratch across it. After acquiring
enough</B>
<P><B>money to move out, I did, and quickly. However if I am home alone 
in my</B>
<P><B>present appartment (I've lived in 3 diffrent one since then, 2 in the</B>
<P><B>Dallas/Ft. Worth area, 1 in Austin area, currantly back in the DFW
area)</B>
<P><B>which I share with my present boyfreind, I still can smell the
colonge(I</B>
<P><B>can't place the type of colonge) from time to time. Forturnatly the</B>
<P><B>nightly 'visits' have not returned. If you have any info on this type
of</B>
<P><B>'haunting', please e-mail me and ask for Kelly.</B>

<P><B>Life Full of Ghosts</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: GBelics@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, I have always had a life full of "GHOSTS" but something that happenened
</B>
<P><B>after my dads funeral I will never forget. </B>
<P>
<P><B>    I was asleep at my aunts house. It was a very hard day for me,
I was ten </B>
<P><B>years old and my dad who I did not see enough passed away. Anyway I
was woken </B>
<P><B>by my mom saying, "Wake up your fathers here" I started to shake,I
was very </B>
<P><B>confused cause I knew I was at his funeral not but a few hours ago.
My mother </B>
<P><B>led me into the kitchen where my aunt and cousin were.  I was still
shaking </B>
<P><B>thats when I saw it, on the table was two Pepsi cans stacked on top
of </B>
<P><B>each other and the top one moved ( my cousin did this cause my aunt
had bugs </B>
<P><B>and she didnt want them to get into her soda).  My mom told me to say
hi to </B>
<P><B>my dad. I was so upset I started to cry, and accuse them for setting
this up </B>
<P><B>with magnets or something. They said they didnt, I sat on a chair and
said </B>
<P><B>hi. The top can moved slightly upward. We couldnt hear anything but
we could </B>
<P><B>ask my dad yes or no questions. I calmed down a bit and started to
talk to </B>
<P><B>him. I can'I remember all that was asked but i can remember a few that
</B>
<P><B>completely changed my veiw point on life forever. I established with
him what </B>
<P><B>he would do for yes, and the top can moved. And for no the cans stayed
still. </B>
<P><B> Then I asked him if he was in heaven and the cans stayed still. So
then I </B>
<P><B>said are you in hell but the cans still stayed still. I got mad and
confused </B>
<P><B>so I screamed well where are you. Of coarse he couldnt answer so instead
I </B>
<P><B>asked is there a heaven or hell and the cans did not move. Then I asked
him </B>
<P><B>if he loved me, to make sure he didn't leave, and the top can moved.
The rest </B>
<P><B>I can't remember of that night. But he did return Three years later.
 It was </B>
<P><B>on Thanksgiving and I was curious if he would come back if I stacked
two Pepsi </B>
<P><B>cans on top of each other. I said aloud "Dad are you here"  and sure
enough </B>
<P><B>the top can moved. I yelled to every one "Dads back" and they came
into the </B>
<P><B>kitchen. It wasn't scary this time I was quite happy to have him there.
It was </B>
<P><B>kinda neat this time too cause we all carried on conversations with
him </B>
<P><B>(though he couldn't talk) and brought him up to date on things that
had </B>
<P><B>happened since he left. We even joked with him. It was nice but he
left in </B>
<P><B>the middle of dinner and I have never heard from him again. I have
tried </B>
<P><B>though I have put Two Pepsi cans on top of each other to see but he
didn't </B>
<P><B>come.    Now I guess you can see how this experieance has changed my
veiw points </B>
<P><B>forever.    </B>

<P><B>"Smiley"</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: hypercube@iswt.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>First of all I would like to say before my experience, I didn't believe
in</B>
<P><B>ghosts or evil spirits and stuff like that. However, what I have
witnessed</B>
<P><B>has changed my views drastically. My story is very, VERY true.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was on a PIKE(PI KAPPA ALPHA) retreat up near Paris Landing Tennessee.
We</B>
<P><B>had been told about a haunting just a few miles from where we were
camping.</B>
<P><B>It was said that a hobo known by locals as "Smiley", was wandering
the</B>
<P><B>tracks one night when he got caught on the tracks. He was decapitated.
We</B>
<P><B>had been told that you must drive down a dead end road surrounded by
trees</B>
<P><B>and stop at the end, turn around, and curse violently at "Smiley" in
order</B>
<P><B>for him to appear. He is identified by a lantern that he carries that
glows</B>
<P><B>bright green. So, we stopped at the end of the road and began cursing
and</B>
<P><B>taunting smiley. Well, he showed up. We saw his lantern appear at the
very</B>
<P><B>beggining of the road. Then as we continued the green light became
closer</B>
<P><B>and brighter. Then it started to move from side to side. All of a
sudden,</B>
<P><B>"Smiley" got mad and began running towards us. When he reached us,
the</B>
<P><B>lamp turned from bright green to bright blood red. We could see a
headless</B>
<P><B>silohouette standing in the red glow. Quickly one of the brothers turned
on</B>
<P><B>his headlights and "Smiley" vanished. We were scared to death. Some
of the</B>
<P><B>brothers were wimpering like baby's wanting there mothers. Some were
just</B>
<P><B>expressionless with a very pale face, as was I, but we were all scared.
We</B>
<P><B>got in our cars and got the hell out of there.</B>

<P><B>The Three Ghosts</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: checkers@lcc.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B> The house I live in is haunted by three ghosts , </B>
<P><B>they seem very friendly, but too friendly...During the night I hear
their conversations but </B>
<P><B>its so faint I cant make out what they are saying. I have had incounters
with </B>
<P><B>them while walking alone at night , for instance I have seen two men
standing at </B>
<P><B>the bottom of the stair case.Once while eating breakfast at the table,
a chair </B>
<P><B>pulled out in front of me as someone was sitting there. The house has
no history </B>
<P><B>of deaths that took place inside of it, but during the 1800's a train
station </B>
<P><B>was built here, but it burned down.I have no reason to believe that
I will get </B>
<P><B>harmed during the time I spend here.</B>
