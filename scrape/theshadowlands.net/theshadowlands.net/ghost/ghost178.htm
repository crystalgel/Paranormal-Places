<p><b>My Imagination</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nfocus@netdoor.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm 34-years-old now, soon to be 35, I still can't figure out if
what was happening at my parents home when I was around 11 was real, or
just my imagination.&nbsp; I have lived with what happened, constantly
trying to explain to myself that there was some logical answer for it.
I guess I should just write out what happened, way back then!</b>
<br><b>I can't exactly remember what time of year it was, although it must
have been during a warmer season, because I was sleeping with only a sheet
over me and no blanket.</b>
<br><b>I was awake, at least I think I was, when something caused me to
sit up in the bed. I rubbed my eyes, then looked around my room.&nbsp;
When my eyes were adjusted to the little amount of light in my room, I
could tell that everything in my room was normal, so I pulled the sheet
back over me and snuggled back into my bed.&nbsp; Then I heard a strange
sound, I remember laying there and wondering, what is that?&nbsp; What
type of sound was that?&nbsp; As I kept listening, the only sound I could
relate it to was how my grandfather use to drink his coffee.</b>
<br><b>He would pour about a quarter cup of coffee into his cup, then place
the cup on a saucer. His hands were so shaky that every time he went to
take a sip of his coffee, the cup would clink and clatter against the saucer.
He had passed away when I was about 6 though.</b>
<br><b>Before he had died I remember sitting in his lap and telling Pa
paw to get a cup of coffee, because it made me giggle so much at how he
drank it!&nbsp; He would just sit there and laugh right along with me!</b>
<br><b>That was the exact sound I was hearing that night. I climbed out
of my bed and went to my brother's room, I shook him to wake him up to
hear what I was hearing.&nbsp; As soon as my brother acknowledged me, the
sound went away.</b>
<br><b>My brother who is 5-years older than me did the typical saying of
siblings "leave me alone and go back to bed, you retard!"</b>
<br><b>I did go back to my room, I got back under my sheet.&nbsp; Within
minutes I heard the clattering again!&nbsp;&nbsp; Only, this time it was
closer sounding!&nbsp; The first sound seemed to have been way down the
hallway, but this was more like it was right in my doorway!&nbsp; I leaped
out of bed quickly turning on my light!&nbsp; There was nothing there!&nbsp;
I left my light on and walked backwards down the hallway watching my room.
The clattering was still going on but I couldn't see anything.&nbsp; I
felt the molding of the doorway to my parents' room, then turned to go
in their room. I got to the headboard of my mother's side of the bed and
reached out to wake my mom up.&nbsp; The instant I touched her, the sound
once again went away!&nbsp; I still woke her and asked, " did you hear
that?"&nbsp; She raised up in bed and held me, asking what was wrong.&nbsp;
I couldn't tell her, I just asked if I could PLEASE sleep with them.&nbsp;
She scooted over and let me in the bed.&nbsp; It woke my dad up and he
took care of some nature business, then came back and laid down.&nbsp;
He asked what was wrong, and I told them I was hearing noises. My dad spilled
out a hundred things it could be, but he was sweet and still let me sleep
with them.</b>
<br><b>At some point in the night, my mother woke me up and told me it
was time for me to get back into my own bed.&nbsp; She walked me down the
hall and tucked me back in.&nbsp; I was comfortable with it, and she went
back to her room.</b>
<br><b>I honestly think I fell straight back to sleep.&nbsp; Then it started
again!&nbsp; The clinking and clanking noise was right in my bed with me
this time!!</b>
<br><b>This is the part that freaked me out the most!&nbsp; I woke up in
a panic, I threw the sheet up to get out of bed and the sheet stood straight
out on the side I threw up, I laid there starring at it.&nbsp; It was in
a perfect diagonal as if someone was holding it like that so I could get
out!&nbsp; I was so scared to move, I just laid there and kept looking
at it, thinking that it will fall back over me, It can't just stand like
that.&nbsp; I waited and waited for it to fall back down, but it never
did. I know this sounds like a cliche, but, it did feel like I was starring
at the standing sheet for 5 or 6 minutes, when it may have only been seconds!&nbsp;
All I know is, I starred at it long enough to cause 2 thoughts in my mind.&nbsp;
"Do I run?.....and why?&nbsp; Or do I stay?&nbsp; and why?"&nbsp; The sheet
stood up long enough for me to actually analyze a decision!</b>
<br><b>In the midst of all my thinking, I gave up and RAN!&nbsp; It seemed
that my brother nor my parents would desire me to bother them again with
it, so I just ran into the living room and turned on all the lights, as
well as the TV.</b>
<br><b>I mumbled under my voice, "whatever you are, you are scaring me!&nbsp;
please leave me alone!"&nbsp; I left the lights and TV on, and curled up
in my Dad's recliner. Nothing else happened that night.</b>
<br><b>A whole year passed without another incident. Until I had a palate
party at my house.&nbsp; Seven giggly girls trying to see what mischief
they could cause!&nbsp; We all sat around telling little ghost stories
and talking about boys.&nbsp; Then I decided to actually reveal what had
happened a year or so ago.&nbsp; Naturally, everyone was enamored by the
story, but no one would believe it!</b>
<br><b>Later that night, well actually early morning, there were about
4 of the 7 of us still slightly awake, we heard a noise in the kitchen
that is right next to the living room where we all had our knapsacks laid
out. We looked around the room to see who had slipped past us to get some
snacks. Everyone was accounted for!!!</b>
<br><b>We all grouped together, I mean hanging on tight to each other,
poked our faces into the kitchen to see if anyone was in there.&nbsp; We
saw no one!&nbsp; Alicia, one of my best friends, said, "where is your
brother?"&nbsp; We laughed for a few seconds cause we figured he would
be goofing with us. Then we went to his room which is at the other total
furthest from the kitchen, and he was in his room!&nbsp; We all rounded
the hall all disappointed that we probably just missed catching him pulling
a joke on us.</b>
<br><b>When we got back into the living room the others had woke up, they
were all bashing us about how our little noisy game in the kitchen wasn't
scarring them!&nbsp; Me and the 3 others that were up with me said at the
same time&nbsp; "we weren't in the kitchen, we were trying to see if Paula's
retard brother was trying to scare us"!</b>
<br><b>Of course they bickered with us, how were we going to make them
believe we did nothing?&nbsp; We didn't have to, because through all the
arguments, something was in the kitchen again!</b>
<br><b>There are only 2 entrances to the kitchen, the living room door
way, and the dinning room one!&nbsp; We decided to break up in groups!&nbsp;
3 went to the dinning room door, 4 went to the living room one.&nbsp; We
all blasted through the entrances and saw nothing!&nbsp; We decided to
fix ourselves a snack while we were in there, then turned our backs to
walk away.&nbsp; As soon as we did, the counter drawers flew out!&nbsp;
Who could pull out drawers simultaneously within less than a second?&nbsp;
We all stood there starring at the open drawers. They never moved, so I
walked over and pushed them back in.</b>
<br><b>Susan was the first person to say, "This is scaring me" , then all
the others said the same, "THIS IS SCARY".</b>
<br><b>We went back into the living room and turned on all the lights.
Nothing else happened after we all said it was scaring us and we actually
did end up sleeping.</b>
<br><b>My mom and dad came through our little sleeping quarters the next
day and jokingly bumped into each one of us.&nbsp; My parents were mouthing
off about how they hoped we had a good time and enjoyed our sleep, because
they didn't get any sleep!</b>
<br><b>You would not believe how many little girls were fighting over a
phone so that they could call their parents to come get them!!!!!!&nbsp;
Needless to say, I never even bothered having a palate party at my house
again.&nbsp; No one would have come.&nbsp; Least I was still invited to
theirs.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Strange Occurrences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SilBean76@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I'm going to try to send this story again.&nbsp; I've tried two
times before,</b>
<br><b>but as I was about to send it, two different computers crashed on
me before I</b>
<br><b>could.</b>
<br><b>I have always thought that there were ghosts.&nbsp; I have never
actually seen one</b>
<br><b>but throughout my whole life I have been "aware" of them.&nbsp;
I would be</b>
<br><b>watching tv and I would hear the chairs in my mother's kitchen move
as if</b>
<br><b>someone was sitting in them.&nbsp; My dog would bark at nothing
in particular.</b>
<br><b>This is all really incidental compared to the strange things that
I've</b>
<br><b>encountered in my last apartment.</b>
<br><b>My apartment was in Southern New Jersey.&nbsp; It was a&nbsp; three
story house built</b>
<br><b>by my old neighbor's grandparents.&nbsp; Judging by my neighbor's
age, it would</b>
<br><b>have to have been built before the turn of the century.&nbsp; It
once was a gas</b>
<br><b>station and there is proof that there was a pretty decent fire in
it at one</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived on the second floor with my boyfriend,
a friend, and later my</b>
<br><b>son.&nbsp; The downstairs apartment was under construction and didn't
have any</b>
<br><b>floors or interior walls.&nbsp; The apartment was set up in such
a way that when</b>
<br><b>you climbed the flight of steps you ended up looking at the two
small</b>
<br><b>bedrooms.&nbsp; You turned the corner and the bathroom and kitchen
were a step up</b>
<br><b>from the bedrooms.&nbsp; The living room was at the front of the
house.&nbsp; I just</b>
<br><b>wanted to give a floor plan so the things I'm about to explain are
a little</b>
<br><b>clearer.</b>
<br><b>When we first moved in, I was pregnant with my son.&nbsp; I was
home mostly by</b>
<br><b>myself during the day.&nbsp; The first thing that I would notice
is that the</b>
<br><b>toliet would flush itself.&nbsp; It wouldn't just be water running
but a full</b>
<br><b>fledged flush.&nbsp; I would be watching tv and it would happen.&nbsp;
One time I was</b>
<br><b>actually in the bathtub when it happened and I had peeked out to
see if my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend had stepped in, but when I called his name he was in the
living</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; Another time, my boyfriend was taking a shower and my
friend and I</b>
<br><b>were talking in the living room.&nbsp; All of a sudden, my friend's
radio which</b>
<br><b>was in the bedroom started playing full blast.&nbsp; I chalked it
up to reception</b>
<br><b>problems and when he informed me that that was a CD, I got frightened.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>would hear footsteps go up and down our steps at night.&nbsp; My
bedroom was right</b>
<br><b>in front of the stairs so I know no one was on them.&nbsp; I would
wake up at</b>
<br><b>night and swear that rats were trying to eat me, or that there were
cigarette</b>
<br><b>butts burning in our bed.&nbsp; We would also about once a month
get a bird in the</b>
<br><b>attic, one of those black birds with the metalic green eyes.&nbsp;
I know that is</b>
<br><b>a bad omen of somekind, but can not remember where I heard it.&nbsp;
Some of my</b>
<br><b>boyfriends friends tried to use a Ouji board but when they started
getting</b>
<br><b>answers they chalked it up to somebody earthly was moving it.</b>
<br><b>With all this going on, whatever or whoever, that was in this apartment</b>
<br><b>didn't do us any harm that I know of.&nbsp; But for some reason,
I believe that</b>
<br><b>whatever it was, doesn't want my story told.&nbsp; For this is the
third time that</b>
<br><b>I've written it.... I hope it works</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Experiences with the Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nshadow@ix.netcom.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have loved your web sight ever since I found it by accident a year
ago.&nbsp; A</b>
<br><b>few months ago I started working as the grave shift supervisor at
an old</b>
<br><b>hospital on top of a hill in the Seattle area. (I have to leave
the name out</b>
<br><b>for security reasons) The first night I worked there I was told
that the</b>
<br><b>building was haunted. By a nurse on the 6th floor and other strange</b>
<br><b>phenomenon the building. It even made the paper a few years back.
One night</b>
<br><b>a few months back I was unlocking some of the doors on the first
floor and</b>
<br><b>bracing them with wedges before the employees come in for the day.
I had</b>
<br><b>just braced the east wing door and walked over to the west wing
door and</b>
<br><b>braced it. I looked up an saw the door on the east wing swing slowly
shut. I</b>
<br><b>walked over to it and peered into the glass window beside it seeing
if one</b>
<br><b>of my guards had gone into the area and closed it. Their was no
one back</b>
<br><b>their so as a precaution I went into the area and searched the entire
wing</b>
<br><b>looking for any one who might be back their. I found no one when
I then went</b>
<br><b>to look at the door I saw the wedge was four feet away and on the
wrong side</b>
<br><b>of the door if it had just come loose and swung shut. Then a few
weeks later</b>
<br><b>I was walking in the same area and felt the hairs stand up on the
back of my</b>
<br><b>neck. As I glanced back over my shoulder to see a black figure with
a pale</b>
<br><b>white face sneaking up on me. When it saw me it dove into a cubicle
after a</b>
<br><b>moments shock I ran after it and their was nothing their but an
empty</b>
<br><b>cubicle, and a cold spot. From other stories from other employees
things</b>
<br><b>like this happen all the time. One of the guards told me she was
getting on</b>
<br><b>and elevator to go down to a different floor with another guard
and she</b>
<br><b>heard some one clear their voice behind her. They had just cleared
the floor</b>
<br><b>and their was no one on the floor. Thank you for hearing my story

<p><b>My name is Robin, and I have two incidents to tell you about.&nbsp;
They both</b>
<br><b>happened the very same day, and it still makes me wonder what it
was.</b>
<br><b>The first incident happened while I was at work, at a large retail
store.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had just walked out of the stockroom, when I felt four distinctive
fingers,</b>
<br><b>slide across the right side of my neck.&nbsp; It felt very cold,
and I shivered</b>
<br><b>all the way to my toes.</b>
<br><b>The second incident happened while I was driving home from work.&nbsp;
Before I</b>
<br><b>had left work, My 21 year old daughter called me, and we got into
an</b>
<br><b>argument.&nbsp; I left work crying and very upset.&nbsp; Traffic
was heavy that</b>
<br><b>evening, and I must not have been paying attention to what I was

<p><b>The Hand Print</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Auburn278@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a covered bridge in Harford County, Maryland
that is reputed to</b>
<br><b>be haunted.&nbsp; It crosses a shallow ravine in a residential neighborhood.&nbsp;
Once</b>
<br><b>you cross the bridge there is a dead end road with about 10 houses
on it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bridge was built somewhere in the middle
of the 19th century, but I</b>
<br><b>believe that there must have been a recent repair and/or renovation
of the</b>
<br><b>bridge due to the fact that the planks were remarkably clean and
free of</b>
<br><b>warping, splitting, or cracking.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't unusual for people to go down to the
bridge at night in an</b>
<br><b>attempt to see or hear something ghostly, much to the dismay of
the small</b>
<br><b>community's residents.&nbsp; The number of visits to the bridge
increase around</b>
<br><b>Halloween.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One cold October about 3 years ago, six of my
friends and I went down to</b>
<br><b>the bridge.&nbsp; I lead the way in my car, followed by some other
friends in a</b>
<br><b>truck.&nbsp; Once we got to the bridge, I crossed and parked my
car on the grassy</b>
<br><b>area on the side of the road.&nbsp; My friends parked behind me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got out with our flashlights shining and walked
the short, dark</b>
<br><b>distance to the bridge.&nbsp; I felt uneasy from the moment I saw
the bridge.</b>
<br><b>but I convinced myself it was because of the fact that if someone
took</b>
<br><b>exception to our presence on the bridge, they could call the police
and have</b>
<br><b>us all arrested for tresspassing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, being the oh so brave female that I am,
I took a deep breath and</b>
<br><b>continued my walk towards the mouth of the covered bridge.&nbsp;
I shined my</b>
<br><b>flashlight towards the bridge and saw my friend Kenny standing near
the side</b>
<br><b>of the bridge looking at something on the wall and in the distance
I could</b>
<br><b>see the glowing ember of my Christine's cigarette.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far so good, I thought to myself as I continued
foward.&nbsp; I absently</b>
<br><b>noticed as I stepped onto the bridge that suddenly I was colder,
which I</b>
<br><b>later found strange due to the fact that the bridge provided a barrier</b>
<br><b>against the cold wind that night and it should have been a slight
bit warmer.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked to about the center of the bridge when
I suddenly felt the</b>
<br><b>bridge shudder, as if many people were jumping on it, and then stop
just as</b>
<br><b>suddenly.&nbsp; I looked around , but all I saw was Kenny doing
the same.&nbsp; There</b>
<br><b>was no one jumping and only the very faint sound of the wind blowing&nbsp;
and my</b>
<br><b>breathing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked to the other side of the bridge and
turned around.&nbsp; I could see</b>
<br><b>my car's windshield glaring due to the faint illumination of a porch
light.</b>
<br><b>Kenny and the others were standing on the other side of the bridge
and</b>
<br><b>Christine was slightly in front of me, just by the "wall" of the
bridge.</b>
<br><b>But who was that in the shadows walking towards me?&nbsp; I held
my breath and</b>
<br><b>waited.&nbsp; But the mysterious person never imerged.&nbsp; I directed
the beam of my</b>
<br><b>flashlight into the darkness, but the only thing on the bridge was
a few</b>
<br><b>leaves and Christine walking across to join the others.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started back across the bridge, slightly shaking
and very unerved, when</b>
<br><b>out of the darkness I heard another set of footsteps, very distinct
and very</b>
<br><b>heavy.&nbsp; I turned to look behind me, but nothing was there,
much to my dismay.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I turned and ran off of the bridge, reaching Kenny first and
telling him</b>
<br><b>that I was ready to go.&nbsp; He could tell I was frightened and
only laughed,</b>
<br><b>thinking that I was scared of nothing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept insisting I wanted to leave when suddenly
Christine said, "What</b>
<br><b>the hell is that?"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all turned to see a faint misty shape moving
towards us very slowly.</b>
<br><b>It only took us all looking at it for just a moment to realize that
it had a</b>
<br><b>very definate human shape.&nbsp; I stared in fascination while the
others turned</b>
<br><b>and ran.&nbsp; Kenny, realizing that I wasn't with them, ran back
and grabbed my</b>
<br><b>arm, dragging me with him towards my car.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept looking behind me at the shape until it
disappeard upon reaching</b>
<br><b>the other side of the bridge.&nbsp; When I reached the car I got
in the passenger</b>
<br><b>side and threw Kenny the keys, insisting he drive, because I was
too shaken</b>
<br><b>up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after Christine got in the backseat there
was a tremendous thump</b>
<br><b>upon my rear window, almost as if someone's hand had slapped the
windshied. I</b>
<br><b>turned to look behind the car, but no one was there.&nbsp; Everyone
else was in</b>
<br><b>the truck which was driving towards the bridge.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kenny started the car and turned around, heading
towards the bridge.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>slammed on the brakes as a dark shape ran across the beam of light
cast by</b>
<br><b>the headlights.&nbsp; I watched in fascination as the shadowy figure
ran across</b>
<br><b>the ravine on thin air.&nbsp; I heard Christine squeel as Kenny
spun wheels in his</b>
<br><b>hurry to get out of there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember kneeling on the seat so that I could
get a full view of the</b>
<br><b>bridge as we left.&nbsp; As it faded into obscurity I shuddered,
realizing that I</b>
<br><b>had had yet another brush with the paranormal.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that night we all decided to go to Denny's.&nbsp;
As we got out of the</b>
<br><b>car I saw a shape high up on my rear windshield.&nbsp; Higher than
the reach of</b>
<br><b>any of us that were present that night.&nbsp; A shape that sent
shivers down my</b>
<br><b>spine and made my knees weak.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a hand print, perfectly formed, situated
up near the top of my</b>
<br><b>rear window in such a place that someone would have to be standing
on the</b>
<br><b>trunk of the car to make.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I vowed never to go back to that bridge if I
could help it and so far I</b>
<br><b>have kept that vow.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Our Ghost Heritage</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: magickats@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My&nbsp; siblings and I were raised by our maternal grandmother,
and she has</b>
<br><b>a treasure throve of ghost stories from when she was a child, back
in</b>
<br><b>Mexico City.</b>
<br><b>As you may already know, Mexico City was the capital of Mexico,
way</b>
<br><b>before the Spaniards conquered the native peoples, and one of the
most</b>
<br><b>recognized tribes of that period was that of the Aztecs.</b>
<br><b>The Aztecs where known for their sacrifices to their Sun god, and
their</b>
<br><b>fierce warriors.&nbsp; But when the Conquistadores arrived, the
Aztecs' blood</b>
<br><b>thirst was not enough to deter the invading armies from Spain.&nbsp;
Soon the</b>
<br><b>capital of Mexico became the capital of Spanish rule in the new
world,</b>
<br><b>and from then on, controlled the country, as far north as Oregon,
and as</b>
<br><b>far east, as Texas.</b>
<br><b>Any way, what I am trying to say is that Mexico City, the oldest
parts</b>
<br><b>of the city that is; is full of haunted houses,&nbsp; most belonging
to</b>
<br><b>Spaniards, and their descendants.&nbsp; My grandmother grew up in
such a</b>
<br><b>house, and she had many&nbsp; tales of ghostly occurrences, and
strange</b>
<br><b>phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; One story goes about strange balls of fire
flying across</b>
<br><b>the sky, some people believed that the fireballs were witches, out
on</b>
<br><b>some evil errand, some thought were ghosts, hovering above hidden</b>
<br><b>treasures, looking for a worthy person to bequeath the hidden gold.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>of the oldest ghost tales in that region is of "La Llorona",&nbsp;
or&nbsp; "The</b>
<br><b>Crying Woman".&nbsp; She is said to haunt a certain river, that
goes by the</b>
<br><b>name "Consulado", and her story goes likes this:&nbsp; She is a
woman who is</b>
<br><b>terribly upset at her cheating husband, and so to get even with
him, she</b>
<br><b>drowns her children in the river.&nbsp; She then realizes what she's
done,</b>
<br><b>and drowns herself.&nbsp; Her ghost is said to haunt the river (or
any other</b>
<br><b>body of water for that matter) and she is heard crying out for her</b>
<br><b>children "Haay mis hijos!" "Ooh my children!".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My grandmother told us</b>
<br><b>on several occasions that she heard the cry, usually late at night,
and</b>
<br><b>she and her family would start praying the Rosary.</b>
<br><b>Another story she told us, was when she was older, she used to live
in</b>
<br><b>another of the old houses, that belonged to some Spaniard, and the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, they use to have huge brick chimneys for cooking.&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>cooking a pot of beans one time, and suddenly she saw an avalanche
of</b>
<br><b>ashes pouring down from the chimney, onto the pot, and grandma was</b>
<br><b>really upset, thinking that the beans were spoiled.&nbsp; But when
she looked</b>
<br><b>into the pot to see the damage, there was no ash to be seen.&nbsp;
She also</b>
<br><b>told us about the strange sounds and weeping heard during the night,
and</b>
<br><b>ghostly lights floating about.</b>
<br><b>My siblings and I always enjoyed her stories, but we were not really</b>
<br><b>that impressed, since we've never seen anything out of the ordinary,
and</b>
<br><b>thought that the tales were just a means to scare us into good</b>
<br><b>behavior.&nbsp; It is really hard to think about paranormal stuff,
here in</b>
<br><b>the US, specially living here in the Silicon Valley, but my sister
and I</b>
<br><b>soon found out that no matter how civilized we are, the strange
and</b>
<br><b>unusually will always find ways to haunt us.</b>
<br><b>We grew up here in San Jose, and stayed in the same street pretty
much</b>
<br><b>the whole time.&nbsp; We moved a couple of times, but always within
the same</b>
<br><b>street.&nbsp; Our last house was a duplex, with one unit on top
of the</b>
<br><b>other.&nbsp; We were on the upstairs unit, and lived there for a
good number</b>
<br><b>of years.&nbsp; The previous tenants on that unit were, it seems,
members of</b>
<br><b>the Rosicrucians, for we found many books and pamphlets up in the
attic</b>
<br><b>space.&nbsp; There were several books on the occult as well, but
we were not</b>
<br><b>really interested in any of that, and so we left the books there.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>myself never saw or heard anything, but my youngest brother would
say</b>
<br><b>that he often felt a presence there, specially at night, and that
he</b>
<br><b>thought that the "being" was malevolent.</b>
<br><b>At one time, my sister was having awful nightmares, and asked if
she</b>
<br><b>could stay in my room.&nbsp; I agreed, and so my sister got her
sleeping bag,</b>
<br><b>and settled down on the floor.&nbsp; She then says that she awoke
in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night, and saw a figure of a woman, sitting at the
foot of</b>
<br><b>my bed, staring into the closet.&nbsp; At first she thought it was
me, since</b>
<br><b>I tended to sleep walk at time, but when she looked at the head
of the</b>
<br><b>bed, she saw me lying there, asleep.&nbsp; Then she turned again,
to see at</b>
<br><b>the sitting figure, and the apparition was gone.&nbsp; She never
asked to</b>
<br><b>sleep in my room again.</b>
<br><b>And from that night on, we believed in our grandmother's ghost stories</b>
<br><b>from Mexico.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Mining Town</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: VPS027@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Are you still looking for new ghost stories?&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in
case you are my family</b>
<br><b>and I had an experience with the Netherworld in 1982 in Cripple
Creek,</b>
<br><b>Colorado which is an old mining town located in the very high Rocky
Mts.</b>
<br><b>behind Pikes Peak.&nbsp; At the time our family consisted of my
husband Vernon,</b>
<br><b>Sam our daughter aged 12 years old, Jason our little 3 year old
son, and</b>
<br><b>myself.</b>
<br><b>I have always loved old places and for my birthday in August 1982
my husband</b>
<br><b>suggested we go up to Cripple Creek and spend the night in one of
the old</b>
<br><b>hotels there in town.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told that there were two
main hotels and I</b>
<br><b>picked the Palace Hotel just at random.</b>
<br><b>We arrived about noon and checked into the Palace.&nbsp; Upon entering
the lobby</b>
<br><b>Sam and I both had a very negative feeling about the place, but
we didn't say</b>
<br><b>anything about our feelings.</b>
<br><b>Our rooms were on the second floor and we reached them by walking
down a long</b>
<br><b>narrow hallway.&nbsp; Our rooms were at the very end of the building.&nbsp;
We had</b>
<br><b>connecting rooms numbers 3 and 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rooms were roughly
10' X 10' and were</b>
<br><b>connected by opening two of the old wooden sliding doors, the type
that slide</b>
<br><b>back into the wall when opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rooms were furnished
in antiques, brass</b>
<br><b>beds, wooden dressers and tables.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no phone
or TV in either room.</b>
<br><b>Each of the doors leading out into the hall had one of the old transom</b>
<br><b>windows at the top of door and there was a double bed in each room.The
rooms</b>
<br><b>had two standard windows in them, and there was one bathroom for
the two</b>
<br><b>rooms.&nbsp; You had to specify that you wanted a private bathroom.</b>
<br><b>We got our things settled and then went out to look the town over
and do some</b>
<br><b>tourist type things.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ate dinner at the other hotel
there in town, and</b>
<br><b>looked the place over after dark.&nbsp;&nbsp; We came back to the
room and Sam and</b>
<br><b>Jason went into the second room, with Vernon being the last one
in and while</b>
<br><b>he still had his hand on the door knob after closing the door we
heard this</b>
<br><b>great crash on the door to our room.&nbsp; It sounded like a huge
man had slammed</b>
<br><b>his body into the door or violently kicked it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vernon
immediately opened</b>
<br><b>the door, to see nothing but a long empty hallway in front of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vernon</b>
<br><b>and I looked at each other uncertainly and he closed the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We weren't</b>
<br><b>about to say anything because Sam was already spooked as it was.</b>
<br><b>Our sleeping arrangements were going to be for Sam and Jason in
one bed,</b>
<br><b>Vernon and I in the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; At bedtime Sam said, "I'm
sorry, but I am afraid</b>
<br><b>to sleep in there with Jason, this place is too scary."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So Vernon said he</b>
<br><b>and Sam would take one bed and Jason and I would take the other.</b>
<br><b>After everyone was in bed, with the two kids asleep, I noticed that
the dim</b>
<br><b>hall light would be on one minute and then would be turned off.&nbsp;
This went on</b>
<br><b>all night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I went to sleep I thought it was too
warm in our room and</b>
<br><b>opened the window by the bed.&nbsp; We slept all night with just
the sheet over us.</b>
<br><b>About three in the morning I woke up after having a very disturbing
dream.</b>
<br><b>I was lying there watching the light in the hall, when all of a
sudden I</b>
<br><b>heard a woman whispering extremely close to my left ear.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I couldn't</b>
<br><b>understand what she was saying as it was just gibberish, then she
would stop</b>
<br><b>and make smacking sounds with her mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached out
with my hands and</b>
<br><b>said, "Sam?"&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was no one there, but the whispering
and smacking</b>
<br><b>continued.</b>
<br><b>About that time Vernon came through my room to go into the bathroom.&nbsp;
When he</b>
<br><b>came out he got into our bed on Jason's side and said, "This is
the first</b>
<br><b>time all night long I have been warm, our room is freezing."&nbsp;&nbsp;
He warmed up</b>
<br><b>then went over to the other bed.</b>
<br><b>In the morning we were all up and Vernon told me to go into the
room he slept</b>
<br><b>in and feel how cold it was.&nbsp;&nbsp; I went over by the bed
and it was extremely</b>
<br><b>cold and very humid.&nbsp;&nbsp; My room on the other hand was warm
and dry.&nbsp;&nbsp; The beds</b>
<br><b>in these two small rooms were about ten feet apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you stood by&nbsp; the</b>
<br><b>doorway between the rooms you could feel that the cold stopped at
the</b>
<br><b>doorway.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could stand in the warm room and put your
hand and arm into</b>
<br><b>the very cold room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam said she had slept in sweats,
socks and her jacket</b>
<br><b>and they had the sheet, blanket and the heavy bedspread over them
and they</b>
<br><b>were still cold.</b>
<br><b>A couple of days after we were home, we lived in Littleton, CO,
I talked to</b>
<br><b>my sister who was attending college and was taking a History of
Colorado</b>
<br><b>class.&nbsp; I told her we had some spooky things happen on our
mountain trip, and</b>
<br><b>I asked if she would talk to her professor to see if he knew anything
about</b>
<br><b>the Palace Hotel in Cripple Creek.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came by
our house the next day and</b>
<br><b>told me she talked to her professor and he told her he happened
to know the</b>
<br><b>people that owned the Palace Hotel.&nbsp; Then he said, "Did you
know that the</b>
<br><b>Palace Hotel is haunted?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course we had no idea of
it's history of</b>
<br><b>hauntings.&nbsp;&nbsp; When she asked what sort of things happened
(without her having</b>
<br><b>told him any of the things that happened to our family) he told
her, "When She</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;is active, people hear strange noises (the huge crash at our
door), the</b>
<br><b>lights won't stay on (we watched the hall light going on and off),
there is a</b>
<br><b>strange cold in one of the rooms, and in room four people&nbsp;&nbsp;
have heard a</b>
<br><b>woman whispering.......room four was the room I slept in.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Experiences</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: pristina1369@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had many ghost experiences. I have been to tarot readers and
been told</b>
<br><b>that I have a very strong psychic ability. So my friends come to
me when they</b>
<br><b>feel something strange going on. My first experience was when I
was in high</b>
<br><b>school. I was in drama and in my spare time during study halls I
would go to</b>
<br><b>the auditorium to work on the up coming plays. Once I was down there
by</b>
<br><b>myself, which was really unusual since I never liked to be there
alone. I</b>
<br><b>looked up towards the balcony and saw a figure walking on the rail
of the</b>
<br><b>balcony. Next it disappeared and I saw the seat fold down as if
someone was</b>
<br><b>sitting on it. Then it got up and moved to another seat. It did
this about 3</b>
<br><b>times. Another time in the same place: WE have two catwalks but
only one is</b>
<br><b>used. In the one catwalk that is never used I saw light come one
and a shadow</b>
<br><b>move back and forth across the floor. The odd thing about it was
that the</b>
<br><b>only way to get up to that catwalk was by a ladder. The opening
is just a</b>
<br><b>hole in the wall. I looked to the opening and saw that there was
no ladder.</b>
<br><b>NO one could have possibly gotten up there. Many other people have
seen the</b>
<br><b>same thing on stage. Here are some experiences from my house. We
moved into</b>
<br><b>my house when I was 5, I am now 18. When we moved there I knew that
there was</b>
<br><b>something wrong. I didn't want to stay there and told my parents.
They didn't</b>
<br><b>listen and we ended up there anyway. I always got strange vibes
from the</b>
<br><b>house. The first time I really encountered anything was at night.
I was about</b>
<br><b>9. Me and my sister shared a room that faced our back yard. We have
40 acres,</b>
<br><b>and I won't even walk back there alone. There are two old cars parked
in back</b>
<br><b>from the previous owners. I looked out the window on a cloudy night
and saw</b>
<br><b>the headlights on from one of the cars. There was no way it could
have</b>
<br><b>happened since there was no engine and the car was so old that nothing
could</b>
<br><b>make it start. I got my sister and showed her so I was sure I wasn't
losing</b>
<br><b>my mind. She saw too. We told my parents the next morning and they
didn't</b>
<br><b>believe us naturally. The same year I had a friend spend the night
and we</b>
<br><b>slept on the pull out couch in our living room. The couch faced
the window.</b>
<br><b>All of a sudden I saw a square green light trace the outer part
of the</b>
<br><b>window, then I heard lots of strange voices coming from outside.
I looked out</b>
<br><b>side and saw shadows of hundreds of people milling around my front
yard. Then</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden they were gone. My friend also witnessed the entire
thing.</b>
<br><b>The odd thing about this story is that my best friend who lived
in Washington</b>
<br><b>state (I live in Minnesota) at the time experienced the same thing
in an RV</b>
<br><b>with his dad. There is also a man in a brown suit that hangs around
our</b>
<br><b>house. The first time he showed up, my mom was in our basement doing
laundry,</b>
<br><b>my dad was at work and my sister and I were at school, when she
looked up</b>
<br><b>towards my bedroom door and saw him standing there in front of my
door way.</b>
<br><b>She could see right through him and he had no face. She ran upstairs
and</b>
<br><b>didn't go back down there till someone came home. The next time
she saw him</b>
<br><b>was when she was walking our 2 dogs down our road. She felt as if
she were</b>
<br><b>being followed and turned around to see him walking behind her.
He followed</b>
<br><b>her all the way to the driveway. My sister also saw him once. She
was in our</b>
<br><b>upstairs hall way and she looked at the mirror at the end of the
hall and saw</b>
<br><b>him standing behind her. If anyone can make light of these stories
I would</b>
<br><b>appreciate it. If you want to know more email me and I will go into
detail. I</b>
<br><b>could probably talk all day about the things that happen in my house.
Write</b>
<br><b>to me with your input or if you can help me. Thanks</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mariamaria125502@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Rachael.&nbsp; I live in Kansas City, Missouri.&nbsp;
One summer</b>
<br><b>while I was at my aunt's house down close to the Ozark's I was upstairs
in</b>
<br><b>the bedroom watching T.V. and I had my one of many experiences with
ghost.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was sitting there on the bed and I had the door half opened.&nbsp;
I heard someone</b>
<br><b>coming up the stairs.&nbsp; There is a door that opens up to the
stairs to go</b>
<br><b>upstairs that is very squeaky.&nbsp; Like i said I heard someone
come upstairs but</b>
<br><b>didn't hear the door open.&nbsp; So a little scared I talked myself
in believing</b>
<br><b>that it was just one of the kittens. Then I could hear people talking
but no</b>
<br><b>very clearly.&nbsp; Then there would be silence for a few minutes
and start back</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; Then I heard someone walking up the stairs so when they
got to the top I</b>
<br><b>looked over and seen the back of a womans skirt.&nbsp; Those skirts
that are</b>
<br><b>really big and poofy from back in 1820 or something.&nbsp; I scared
my bad, I just</b>
<br><b>about pissed my pants!&nbsp; I finally got up enough guts to go
downstairs with my</b>
<br><b>aun't.&nbsp; When I got down there I told her everyhting, step my
step like with</b>
<br><b>you. She told my her brother in-law had an experience with her also.&nbsp;
In the</b>
<br><b>room across the hall which is where all it happened with me also.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>stayed the night and right before he was asleep someone wipped his
forhead.</b>
<br><b>He asked his wife if it was her but she was asleep.</b>

<p><b>Midnight Horror</b><b></b>
<p><b>by shab09876@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ghosts! Are u afraid of ghosts? If not, this is really</b>
<br><b>gonna freak ya out of yer wits. I have a cousin(let us</b>
<br><b>call him Glen) who stays in Mackedonia.He earns by</b>
<br><b>driving and studies as well. This happened to him one</b>
<br><b>winter night.</b>
<br><b>Glen was returning to his hostel after a long and</b>
<br><b>tiring day. On the way,he met two beautiful young</b>
<br><b>ladies who asked him for a lift. Seeing their pretty</b>
<br><b>faces,he agreed as their destination was near to his</b>
<br><b>hostel. He started driving with the two ladies seated</b>
<br><b>on the back seat. And to his surprise when his eyes</b>
<br><b>fell on the mirror, he could see nothing but only two</b>
<br><b>old and ugly women.In shock, my cousin looked behind</b>
<br><b>and saw the same pretty women seated over there. Again</b>
<br><b>when he looked in the mirror, he could see two ugly</b>
<br><b>ladies. Now he was confirmed that the two ladies were</b>
<br><b>not normal human beings but some evil spirit. Glen</b>
<br><b>started sweating with fright but he continued driving.</b>
<br><b>He only stopped where the ladies wished to get down.</b>
<br><b>The first woman took out the money to pay for the fare</b>
<br><b>but my cousin refused. At this, the second woman</b>
<br><b>handed it over to Glen.While taking the money his eyes</b>
<br><b>fell on their legs. It was twisted! He dashed out of</b>
<br><b>the car and ran till he saw a group of women</b>
<br><b>gossiping. Glen, as they asked him, narrated the whole</b>
<br><b>incident to them.Among them a lady laughingly</b>
<br><b>said,''Look at my feet.Are they not twisted?''. All</b>
<br><b>the women had twisted feet. My cousin Glen, ran from</b>
<br><b>there and drove back to the hostel.Here ends this</b>
<br><b>incident.</b>
<br><b>As my cousin was telling us about his experience with</b>
<br><b>ghosts, there was terror on everyone's face.But I</b>
<br><b>did'nt believe this incident 'cause I think ghosts</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Real Ghost Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: marynet@aye.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was very pleased to find your sight on the internet.&nbsp; I have
been</b>
<br><b>interested in Ghosts since I was a very small child.&nbsp; Over
the years I</b>
<br><b>have had many 'encounters' with ghosts but I have found when I try
to</b>
<br><b>share these stories with people that I know or work with, they usually</b>
<br><b>roll their eyes and think I'm crazy.&nbsp; It's sad because I find
these</b>
<br><b>types of stories interesting and I love sharing them with others.</b>
<br><b>My first 'encounter' was when I was approximately 5 years old.&nbsp;
I was at</b>
<br><b>my Grandparent's house in Louisville, KY for a family reunion</b>
<br><b>celebrating the Fourth of July.&nbsp; It was dusk and the lights
from the</b>
<br><b>house made it easy to look inside.&nbsp; I was looking for my Grandmother
and</b>
<br><b>looked into one of the basement windows.&nbsp; She had a small kitchen
down</b>
<br><b>there and used it as her "summer kitchen".&nbsp; I saw her standing
at the</b>
<br><b>sink below the window and I started shouting hello to her and waving
but</b>
<br><b>she seemed to ignore me.&nbsp; Finally I ran up to the window to
tap on it</b>
<br><b>and I realized that the woman down there wasn't my Grandmother at
all.</b>
<br><b>I had no idea who she was.&nbsp; She looked up at me and smiled
and then just</b>
<br><b>disappeared.&nbsp; One of my uncles came up behind me and asked
me if I was</b>
<br><b>alright.&nbsp; I guess I must have looked like I saw a ghost!&nbsp;
:-)&nbsp; I told</b>
<br><b>him I thought I saw my Grandmother down there but he told me she
was on</b>
<br><b>the other side of the backyard and that no one was inside the house.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>kept insisting that someone had just been down there and they checked</b>
<br><b>but found no one.&nbsp; Needless to say, it freaked me out bad enough
that I</b>
<br><b>avoided going down to that basement alone for as long as my Grandmother</b>
<br><b>owned that house (another 30 years!).</b>
<br><b>I also used to live in an old house in New Albany, IN.&nbsp; When
my husband</b>
<br><b>and I moved there I was six weeks pregnant with our first child.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>house had two floors and a basement.&nbsp; I didn't particularly
like the</b>
<br><b>house because it just felt odd and I especially was creeped out
by the</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; My husband, knowing the story about my Grandmother's
house,</b>
<br><b>told me I was just being silly because of what happened when I was
a</b>
<br><b>little kid.&nbsp; But there was something strange in that basement.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>basement was divided into two sections, separated by an old brick
wall.</b>
<br><b>The front half of the basement had been used when the house was</b>
<br><b>originally built as the coal storage area and I'm not sure to this
day</b>
<br><b>what the back half was used for.&nbsp; It was completely devoid
of shelves,</b>
<br><b>pipes, hooks - anything that would give one a clue as to what it
had</b>
<br><b>been used for except for one very odd thing.&nbsp; In the back corner
was</b>
<br><b>what appeared to be a very strange closet. It had been formed in
a</b>
<br><b>corner by the addition of two wooden walls which were set in the</b>
<br><b>concrete floor.&nbsp; On one of these walls was a four pane window
that</b>
<br><b>looked out into the basement.&nbsp; The other wooden wall had a
door with a</b>
<br><b>handle and a latch on the inside only.&nbsp; There was also a pull
rope</b>
<br><b>inside but unfortunately it had long ago rotted and we were never
able</b>
<br><b>to determine what function it had once performed.&nbsp; Also, the
back brick</b>
<br><b>foundation wall that served as one of it's other four walls had
a small</b>
<br><b>basement sized window that was built into the foundation.&nbsp;
I couldn't go</b>
<br><b>inside this closet or even get near it without getting nauseated
(even</b>
<br><b>after my baby was finally born) and, finally, my husband decided
to tear</b>
<br><b>it down.&nbsp; The concrete that the two wooden walls had been buried
in</b>
<br><b>broke easily and much to our surprise, we discovered that there
was no</b>
<br><b>ground underneath that area of concrete.&nbsp; He got his sledge
hammer and</b>
<br><b>made the hole large enough to take a flashlight and shine it down
into</b>
<br><b>the hole and was surprised to see that it appeared to be a brick
lined</b>
<br><b>corridor that had been filled with debris years before.&nbsp; Evidently
this</b>
<br><b>corridor and the closet had some type of connection because the
closet</b>
<br><b>had been at what would have been the opening for the staircase going</b>
<br><b>into this corridor.&nbsp; At some point in the history of the house,
this</b>
<br><b>corridor and stairwell were filled with debris and concrete was
poured</b>
<br><b>over them.&nbsp; The person who had this done however didn't have
the wooden</b>
<br><b>walls ripped out which is why they were still standing when we bought</b>
<br><b>the place.&nbsp; Over the years the debris had settled.&nbsp; My
husband took a</b>
<br><b>heavy rod and began tapping on the floor to follow the path of the</b>
<br><b>corridor and it led to the front end of the house, made a turn towards</b>
<br><b>the side street (the house was on a corner) and led to an end wall.&nbsp;
If</b>
<br><b>it continued straight across, it would have gone under an old church.</b>
<br><b>His curiosity finally got the better of him and he decided to crawl
into</b>
<br><b>the hole and see just how far he could go.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the debris</b>
<br><b>had not settled very much a few feet from the hole and he had to
work</b>
<br><b>his way back.</b>
<br><b>I researched my house after this and found that it had been built
around</b>
<br><b>the turn of the century on the foundation of a house that pre-dated
the</b>
<br><b>Civil War.&nbsp; A railroad track ran about a block away from it.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>contacted my local historical society but unfortunately, they hadn't
any</b>
<br><b>records on the house.&nbsp; However, they guessed that it could
very well</b>
<br><b>have been a hidden shelter for the 'Underground Railroad' which
had</b>
<br><b>several safe houses in my town.</b>
<br><b>The reason I share that bit of data is because an acquaintance of
mine</b>
<br><b>at the time had a good friend who was a psychic.&nbsp; One day,
the</b>
<br><b>acquaintance of mine dropped by for a question on a homework</b>
<br><b>assignment.&nbsp; She had only been in the house for less than twenty
minutes</b>
<br><b>when she left to visit her friend.&nbsp; When she walked in her
friends</b>
<br><b>apartment, the woman started freaking out asking her where she had
been</b>
<br><b>because she could sense that she had just been to a haunted place.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>said that the house was being haunted by four spirits.&nbsp; The
first was a</b>
<br><b>gentle spirit who looked after the house and those who lived in
it.</b>
<br><b>This was true because I had seen this spirit several times before
that</b>
<br><b>and had several 'experiences' with her.&nbsp; The second was one
who stayed</b>
<br><b>on the ground floor who was fond of pranks.&nbsp; This was true,
my ghosts</b>
<br><b>was constantly pulling harmless pranks on me but it wasn't limited
to</b>
<br><b>the first floor!&nbsp; The third lived on the second floor and was
full of</b>
<br><b>sadness which I also believe to be true because of something else
that</b>
<br><b>happened that I researched.&nbsp; And finally, the fourth was an
old spirit</b>
<br><b>who had been there a long time who was full of much anger and rage.</b>
<br><b>This spirit lived in the basement.&nbsp; This tied in perfectly
with the</b>
<br><b>hidden corridor.&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to believe that it was probably
the spirit of</b>
<br><b>a runaway slave who risked his life to obtain freedom only to die
in a</b>
<br><b>hidden sub-basement corridor.</b>
<br><b>Unfortunately we don't live in that house anymore.&nbsp; I hated
selling it</b>
<br><b>because I came to befriend the gentle spirit that lived there and
I made</b>
<br><b>peace with the one in the basement.&nbsp; The one who kept pulling
pranks on</b>
<br><b>me was a bit of a pain and the sad one was harmless.&nbsp; The current
owners</b>
<br><b>I see every Halloween when I take my children trick or treating
there</b>
<br><b>and they share their stories with me although they don't really
believe</b>
<br><b>the house is haunted as much as they just think strange.&nbsp; If
I could,</b>
<br><b>I'd bring the gentle spirit here to live but I know she won't come.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>built that house and lived there till she was forced into a nursing
home</b>

<br><b>weren't there (something my oldest child also did&nbsp; but that's
another</b>

<br><b>believe that ghosts are part of one of the last great unknowns and
to a:</b>
<br><b>not fear them and b: never believe everything you see or think you

<br><b>There's nothing worse than blind faith when it comes to ghosts.</b>

<br><b>REASON FOR EXPULSION</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to attend a christian school where I never
really fit in</b>
<br><b>anyway.&nbsp; On a trip to a camp that my entire school went on
I decided to</b>
<br><b>tell an unknowledgeable dim-witt about an experience my cousin and
I</b>
<br><b>had.&nbsp; The story of course got passed around the school and
changed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>didn't care about that.&nbsp; Really the only thing was, was that
the</b>
<br><b>pastor's daughter wouldn't leave me alone and so fed-up with her
I</b>
<br><b>blurted the story out along with some other things that have happened
to</b>
<br><b>me in hopes to scare the H*** out of her.&nbsp; The problem is,
is that it</b>
<br><b>worked to well and they kicked me out.&nbsp; Not that I minded except
now</b>
<br><b>these hypocrites think I am a witch or a satan worshipper or something</b>
<br><b>because of their own fear.&nbsp; After I tell you this story you
will</b>
<br><b>understand why I no longer fear anything that happens to me like
this</b>
<br><b>because nothing can possibly be as terrifying as what has already</b>
<br><b>happened to me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here it goes.&nbsp; I was six, my cousin five.&nbsp;
Our family had made</b>
<br><b>our yearly trip to Florida.&nbsp; My parents didn't come that year.&nbsp;
Our (my</b>
<br><b>cousin and I) Uncle Doug and Aunt Hope had gone jogging, and my
Aunt</b>
<br><b>Wanda (my cousins mom) stayed at home with us.&nbsp; We rented a
beach house</b>
<br><b>every year so this is not a hotel.&nbsp; An electrical storm came
up and</b>
<br><b>Uncle Doug and Aunt Hope weren't back yet so my Aunt Wanda decided
to go</b>
<br><b>get them.&nbsp; She locked the door and left the house.&nbsp; My
cousin and I were</b>
<br><b>watching TV and coloring.&nbsp; I was sitting of should I say laying
on the</b>
<br><b>couch burnt to a crisp as usual and my cousin was sitting on the
floor.</b>
<br><b>After a few minutes a large bolt of lightning speared out of the
sky and</b>
<br><b>the power went out.&nbsp; After about half a minute the TV came
back on.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>only thing is it was only the TV that came back on.&nbsp; However,
the show</b>
<br><b>we were watching wasn't what was on the screen.&nbsp; It was just
red static</b>
<br><b>and a low voice that said my cousin and my name.&nbsp; My cousin
started</b>
<br><b>clawing my back.&nbsp; Now, being sunburt the way I was my first
reaction was</b>
<br><b>to slap the fire out of her except that she looked terrified.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>would have been great if that was were this story ended, but</b>
<br><b>unfortunatly it isn't.&nbsp; My cousin was staring at the door to
the house.</b>
<br><b>I looked in that direction as the door swung open.&nbsp; Mind you,
I have</b>
<br><b>already said that my Aunt locked the door and took the key with
her.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>the doorway stood a black figure about and inch off the floor and
an</b>
<br><b>inch from the ceiling.&nbsp; It crossed over the threshold and headed</b>
<br><b>straight for us.&nbsp; At that moment my Aunt Wanda drove up.&nbsp;
The door shut</b>
<br><b>and the lights came back on.&nbsp; My Aunt unlocked the door and
walked in.</b>
<br><b>Of course when she looked at us we were white as sheets, even me
with my</b>
<br><b>sunburn.&nbsp; I asked her if the lights had been on when she pulled
up and</b>
<br><b>of course, according to her, the had been.&nbsp; My cousin and I
never spoke</b>
<br><b>a word to anyone for seven years and life continued all up until
I</b>
<br><b>opened my big mouth.&nbsp; I don't regret what I did or having told
the story</b>
<br><b>I only regret that people out there are too small minded to comprehend</b>
<br><b>or to afraid to face the possiblity.&nbsp; Our parents don't believe
us</b>
<br><b>either.&nbsp; We rarely discuss it unless we are telling ghost stories
(most</b>
<br><b>of them being true though others don't know that little fact).&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>are so many things that have happened to me, but I believe that
this one</b>
<br><b>takes the cake and has cured me of fear entirly.&nbsp; I can't even
remember</b>
<br><b>the last time I was scared with the exception of that night.</b><b></b>

<br><b>South Carolina-Fort Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; lil_pigletz@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Many people say that there are evil spirits that roam in the
fort.&nbsp; The same exact fort in which was used in the Revoltionary War.&nbsp;
Things have been seen like demon dogs with red eyes that protect the fort.&nbsp;
People have heard war cries and gun shots from inside the fort.&nbsp; It
is a huge two story like fort with many ways to get in, (I encourage you
to look into it.)&nbsp; Also there is a private beach behind the fort who
it is owned to I don't know.&nbsp; The fort has humongous holes about 12ft.
deep maybe, that are said that in the war they use to keep there enemies
that they caught there and in there is where you could hear war cries but
see nothing.</b>
<br><b>thos in cults or just experiencing voodoo and witch craft would
go out there and perform sacrafices... as some say.&nbsp; Some have said
that they have gone into the fort and get bitten but when they come out
of the fort they see nothing, no mark of any sort.&nbsp; There is a private
beach behind the upper part of the fort but to whom owns it I don't know.&nbsp;
People have said they have seen people dancing around fires out there laughing.&nbsp;
The fort now is abandoned except for those who go there for a scare or
to find out the truth.&nbsp; The walls are covered with spray paint with
different symbols on it from the early years like 1990.&nbsp; I have been
to the fort but only in the day time and I have never experienced anything
except the dungeon like things hidden by vines and overgrown trees where
they would bury people. There is no way you can get into them unless you
drop throught the top I looked into it and there was water in the bottom
of it I wouldn't dare go in it and I could see barely ston!</b>
<br><b>!</b>
<br><b>e like bed things, I suppes tombs or something.&nbsp; I got a little
creeped out but what scared me the most was when I smelled the smell of
dead animal and then thats when I heard the growl of a dog and then the
barking.&nbsp; By natural instinct I left with my friends which were at
the beach the whole time.</b>

<br><b>My Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sunsettransport@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is chase castellanos and my family is rreal open to ghosts
and hauntings and paranormal activity and sometimes i've tired some wiccan
spells but nothing too weird.&nbsp; Any way my story is concerning a trickster
ghost.&nbsp; One night in 1999 i was in the seventh grade and i was in
bed about to go to sleep my mom and sisters were in the other room watching
t.v. when i was just about to go to sleep when a heard a sort of growl
i was very scared then i got the nerve to open my eyes and there it was
a face grinning at me then it sort of jump over my bed and disappeared.&nbsp;
I hid under my covers and then got the nerve to dash out of my room and
told my mom the what ha happened.&nbsp; I think she beleived me becuase
she came in my room and started reading the bible to me and said i had
othing to fear.&nbsp; i'm in the 8th grade now and not to long ago i heard
the same growl but just kinda shrugged it off but until this vert day i
still have trouble sleeping wondering if its ever going to come back.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mom sheri brown also had a ghostly experience.&nbsp; She was half
way asleep and heard foot steps down stairs and thought it was my step
dad because hes&nbsp; truck driver and sometimes gets home late so she
thought it was him.&nbsp; then she heard loud slow foot steps going up
the stairs she still thought it was him because he has big work boots.&nbsp;
Then the foot dteps went back down the stairs curiously she went down to
see if anyone was there and there was no one.&nbsp; So the next day she
bought a ouiji board and tried to talk to the spirtit and turned out that
there were was more than one ghost of spirit but they were all nice.&nbsp;
We (i guess) talked to my step dads father who had died of cancer on my
birthday and it was close to my birth day and he said that it ws him who
did all the walking around the house but is till dont know but htey ghosts
who were in my house have seem to have left but one still remains in my
room i dont really mind him because i feel that he proctects me from evil.&nbsp;
I also think that my house it like a place spirits like to come becuase
sometimes i hear them talking and so does my mom and sometimes i talk back
and say hi but they havent come around ever since i&nbsp; started trying
wiccan craft but the one in my room i know&nbsp; still remains.</b>

<p><b>Feeling Down</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>Let me begin by telling you that my father passed on when I was a
small child of 6 and I always felt as if I had missed out on something
growing up.&nbsp; At least up until i was 16 and my first son was born.</b>
<br><b>While I was pregnant with him (many of you may think this morbid)
I would visit my father's grave site and talk with him.&nbsp; I would tell
him about the child and how I hoped he would love him, I also told him
about what I had decided to name my son.&nbsp; Since I wasnt married in
those days the child received the mother's last name as his/her's.&nbsp;
I remember telling my father that my son would carry his last name.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after my son was born, I slept in what was my father's room
with him in his crib.&nbsp; Now let me give you an idea as to how the room
was set up.&nbsp; The crib was in a corner with an inside wall and an outside
wall, my bed was on the other side of the room.&nbsp; There was no door
near the crib.&nbsp; I awoke late one night and sat bolt upright.&nbsp;
Someone was in the room with me and my son.&nbsp; As I looked over at the
crib, a tall white figure turned and looked at me and smiled, he then turned
toward the outside wall and walked through the wall.&nbsp; I told my mother
the next morning and she said that my dad was telling me that he did indeed
love my son, and approved of his name.</b>
<br><b>I have had other experiences over the years, feelings of animosity
in certain places, feelings of being watched in an empty house and such,
but none as clear as this one or the one that happened just a few weeks
ago.</b>
<br><b>My mother passed away at the end of September after a long illness
and it left me with alot of anger, emptiness, feelings of loss.&nbsp; You
see, for the longest time I have been my mother's wheels.&nbsp; I took
her everywhere she wanted to go, I ran her errands for her, bought her
groceries for her, you name it and I did it up until about 2 months before
her death when one of my sisters took over.&nbsp; After that her health
really declined, then she passed on.&nbsp; The day after her death, my
sisters and I got together to make her final arrangements.&nbsp; We went
to her house and one of her rose bushes was blooming, a little late in
September when no blooms had been on it 2 days before.&nbsp; That night
neighbors reported seeing lights on in her house, the one in her bedroom
and her kitchen light, the ones she normally had on.&nbsp; We checked it
out and they were turned off.</b>
<br><b>About a week after her death, I was feeling really down and decided
to go to bed.&nbsp; As I was beginning to dose off, I heard someone enter
my room and sit on my bed.&nbsp; I have several children and thinking it
was one of them I sat up and turned on the light.&nbsp; To my surprise,
no one was there, so I figured I was just dreaming it, turned out the light
and laid back down.&nbsp; After a few seconds, I felt someone get off the
bed and heard them leave.&nbsp; As I lay there in my bed, a feeling of
unbelievable peace came over me. I believe it was my mother coming to tell
me goodbye and that she is ok.</b>

<br><b>The Ghost of an Aunt</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sexeemomma4u@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 10 I used to play with a girl named Torie*, she lived
with her</b>
<br><b>parents and older sister in a plain inconspicous brown house in
canton's</b>
<br><b>southeast side. The one and only night that I spent the night Torie*
and I</b>
<br><b>were sitting watching tv, The Haunting if you can believe, with
her sister</b>
<br><b>Tracy*. When there was a loud ruckus coming from upstairs while
Torie* and I</b>
<br><b>jumped at the same time, Torie* and Tracy* kept watching tv. I of
course</b>
<br><b>asked who was making all that noise and I was told it was Aunt May.
The noise</b>
<br><b>continued for the better part of an hour, then stopped, we slept
on the</b>
<br><b>couches in the living room. The next morning when I went upstairs
to use the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, to say I was shocked would be a understatment. All the
clothes from</b>
<br><b>the upstairs bedrooms where piled up on both sides of the hall making
the way</b>
<br><b>to the bathroom trecherous to say the least. When I came back down
I said to</b>
<br><b>Torie* "is there something wrong with your aunt?" "no" she replied
" she's</b>
<br><b>angry because we moved in after she died and she wants us to leave
so she</b>
<br><b>takes all our clothes out of our dressers, it's her way of telling
us to get</b>
<br><b>out."(Now please note they had only been in the house for the better
part of</b>
<br><b>6 months). Aunt May got her wish a month later, Torie* and I where
playing on</b>
<br><b>the porch when we heard a thumping noise from inside the house,
Torie* went</b>
<br><b>in and found her Dad in the reclyner chair, dead. Drs. said it was
a</b>
<br><b>anuryesum but either way Torie* and her mom and sister moved two
weeks later.</b>
<br><b>To this day when I see Torie* she will still claim that It was her

<br><b>My Sisters House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ann.Pergakis@mt.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>These experiences involve my sisters house which is haunted. It is
a very</b>
<br><b>large old home. Many people have had experiences in this house.
I would like</b>
<br><b>to share a few with you. Several members of my family have had experiences</b>
<br><b>with ghosts or sprits in the past, but the experiences in this house
are</b>
<br><b>exceptional because on several occasions there where many people
that</b>
<br><b>witnessed them. When you first enter the house you are in a sitting
room</b>
<br><b>that leads into a middle room that serves as a small parlor. On
the night</b>
<br><b>that my sister moved in and after all her help left she was alone
sitting on</b>
<br><b>a sofa in the middle room when she saw someone peeking around the
corner at</b>
<br><b>her. She was not scared and actually told us that she introduced
herself to</b>
<br><b>the ghost as the new owner and promised to take care of the place
and</b>
<br><b>planned to restore the home back to its original condition. (which
by the</b>
<br><b>way it took her seven years but she did it.) After that about one
week later</b>
<br><b>we were all over her new home helping her strip wallpaper. There
was six of</b>
<br><b>us helping her. Both my mother and my mother in law were there to
supervise</b>
<br><b>our work. At the end of the night we were all leaving together,
as we were</b>
<br><b>filing out the front door which leads to a front porch, my mother
who was</b>
<br><b>the last one in line reached behind her to shut the door when all
of the</b>
<br><b>sudden my mom actually flew over the threshold and landed on the
floor of</b>
<br><b>the sitting room, naturally we were all shocked to see our mother
on the</b>
<br><b>floor, after helping her up she told us that she felt someone grab
hold of</b>
<br><b>her arm and pull her back into the house. Needless to say we were
freaked.</b>
<br><b>My sister and her family continued to have experiences with their
ghost but</b>
<br><b>what happened next was so amazing, It was Christmas eve and my sister
had</b>
<br><b>opened her home for a family gathering. We were all there sitting
around the</b>
<br><b>fireplace when the front door bell rang. When we went to the door
noone was</b>
<br><b>there. We thought it might be the wind. After a short time it was
time for</b>
<br><b>dinner as we were sitting around the table and sent one of our brother
in</b>
<br><b>laws to retrieve the soda that was being kept on the front porch,
The Soda</b>
<br><b>was gone! all 10-15 bottles of it! We checked everywhere for the
missing</b>
<br><b>soda, in the house, outside, anyway that night we drank water and
juice. At</b>
<br><b>the end of the night as we were saying goodnight and walking to
our cars we</b>
<br><b>all saw the missing bottles of soda lined up along the edge of the
driveway</b>
<br><b>in a perfect straight line.No one can explain how it got there.
Things in</b>
<br><b>this house would continue to be missing and then turn up elsewhere.
One</b>
<br><b>weekend my other sister and her husband where staying for a visit.
In the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night the radio would go on by its self and the bedroom
shades</b>
<br><b>would suddenly go up. My bother in law so uneasy at this house that
they had</b>
<br><b>to leave. I know people that will not even go to this house. The
strangest</b>
<br><b>thing in this house is in the basement. There is a concrete slab
build from</b>
<br><b>the stone wall. It measures about 3 feet high from the floor and
10 feet</b>
<br><b>long, it looks like a work table of some sort, but has no reason
to be</b>
<br><b>there. My sister wants to drill a hole in it to see if it is solid
all the</b>
<br><b>way through. So far to this day she has not done that. She says
that she can</b>
<br><b>never bring herself to open it. Maybe she is afraid of what she
might find</b>

<br><b>Strange Memories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wdesena@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I wanted to share some things that happened when I was</b>
<br><b>a child that I've never forgotten.&nbsp; I was very little</b>
<br><b>when I saw what looked like a crying angel over the</b>
<br><b>doorway to our apartment.&nbsp; I think my family was</b>
<br><b>either going to or coming from a funeral at the time</b>
<br><b>and I heard crying sounds and thought I saw the tears</b>
<br><b>fall from the angel.&nbsp; Another time also very little, I</b>
<br><b>was outside playing when it got dark.</b>
<br><b>I was going inside when I saw the shadowy figure of a</b>
<br><b>man standing next to the door.&nbsp; He looked quite real I</b>
<br><b>remember blue pants and a red shirt and his hands</b>
<br><b>looked very real but his shoulders and head was in</b>
<br><b>darkness.&nbsp; I stood there transfixed for several</b>
<br><b>moments exspecting him to speak or move but he never</b>
<br><b>did.&nbsp; He just gave me the feeling that he really</b>
<br><b>wasn't a real person and was just watching me so I ran</b>
<br><b>past him into the house.</b>
<br><b>I grew up became a clergyman and never really had any</b>
<br><b>other experiemces except these: I was in Benin West</b>
<br><b>Africa at my new bride's stepmother's house.&nbsp; We had</b>
<br><b>just come into town to visit her stepmom and sister</b>
<br><b>and being exhausted from the trip I went into my</b>
<br><b>wife's old room to lie down.&nbsp; I had just lied on the</b>
<br><b>bed and rolled to face the wall with my hand resting a</b>
<br><b>little over the side of the bed when something grabbed</b>
<br><b>my hand and pulled it hard from under the bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>jumped up and yelled thinking a snake or some other</b>
<br><b>animal was underneath the bed but when I looked there</b>
<br><b>was nothing there.&nbsp; I ran out of the room and</b>
<br><b>confronted my wife, stepmom ,and sister and they</b>
<br><b>became annoyed when I told them what happened,...not</b>
<br><b>annoyed that I was making it up or had ahd somekind of</b>
<br><b>dream but they seemd annoyed that I had found</b>
<br><b>something out they didn't want me to.&nbsp; Their behavior</b>
<br><b>was indeed odd as they never looked in the rom to</b>
<br><b>search for a monkey, snake, or some cause nor did they</b>
<br><b>question me at all about what happened to me, they</b>
<br><b>seemed to know what it was.&nbsp; Being a clergyman I</b>
<br><b>decided they had something evil in their house and so</b>
<br><b>that night I had them all gather at midnight and</b>
<br><b>performed a minor exorcism on the house with Holy</b>
<br><b>water and bell, book and candle.</b>
<br><b>I asked the mother if they owned a bible and she</b>
<br><b>produced a bible that looked as though it was kept in</b>
<br><b>a grave being so old worn and ill-cared for I also</b>
<br><b>discovered a shrine to Shango in the back of the house</b>
<br><b>with fresh ass from new sacrifices still on altar.</b>
<br><b>That plus the evil demeanors of the mom and sister</b>
<br><b>made me very aprehensive and I quickly said some</b>
<br><b>prayers and departed the house never returning.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>wife was killed mysteriously some months later and</b>
<br><b>since she died in Italy her family didn't bring her</b>
<br><b>body home fearing an evil spirit would manifest as her</b>
<br><b>ghost and haunt them.</b>
<br><b>That was over ten years ago now I am married and we</b>
<br><b>have just had a grand daughter from my wife's</b>
<br><b>daughter.&nbsp; The other day she was being held by my wife</b>
<br><b>when I walked into the room making a lot of noise and</b>
<br><b>my wife told me to be quiet so as not to upset the</b>
<br><b>baby.&nbsp; I stopped and looked the baby in the eyes and</b>
<br><b>said 'Hi' as I usually do.&nbsp; A strange thing happened</b>
<br><b>the baby seemd to momentarily assume another</b>
<br><b>personality her features changed and I was aware of</b>
<br><b>some difference when she spoke in an adult voice and</b>
<br><b>said deeply and clearly 'Hi.'&nbsp; My wife and I both</b>
<br><b>froze and our mouths hung open in disbelief since</b>
<br><b>she's only 3 months old.&nbsp; Just as quickly as it</b>
<br><b>happened it seemed to leave and I could see the babies</b>
<br><b>personality again in her face and motions.&nbsp; We called</b>

<br><b>They Are Back</b><b></b>

<p><b>while i was growing up, till about the age of 10-11, I would see,
fell and</b>
<br><b>hear things that everyone said was just my imagination. I would
see shadows</b>
<br><b>out of the corner of my eye, and not nice ones either. I would sometimes</b>
<br><b>catch them watching me as i slept, and when I would see them they
would back</b>
<br><b>up and disappear. I always felt I was being watched. I would have
dreams</b>
<br><b>about big black dogs with glowing red eyes chasing me. Now in the
dreams I</b>
<br><b>knew I was dreaming but I could not get out of them till the dogs
caught me.</b>
<br><b>The worst things that i've seen or felt were, as i called them,
the bad men.</b>
<br><b>These were hideously dedeformed creatures and things with huge heads
big</b>
<br><b>eyes; others had wings like a bats, claws and such. I'm getting
just</b>
<br><b>thinking about it. Some even looked to be about 7 foot tall and
dressed like</b>
<br><b>a druid. I could not see their faces becausethe hoods were pulled
up; they</b>
<br><b>never came after me they just stood there in the back ground watching.
I</b>
<br><b>didn't see them all t!</b>
<br><b>he timebut when i did it didn't</b>
<br><b>matter what time it was; I saw them mostly in my dreams though.
in the</b>
<br><b>morning i used to get visions of things, people i knew, places,
and later</b>
<br><b>that day i would eather see them go there.</b>
<br><b>I used to get there things my parents called my ups and downs. i
never</b>
<br><b>remember any of them; my parents told me about them after i woke
up. what</b>
<br><b>would happen was that my parents would wake to hear me screaming
bloody</b>
<br><b>murder. they would come into my room, which i shared with my older
brother,</b>
<br><b>and find me litterly trying to climb the walls. my walls had nail
markes</b>
<br><b>from me for years, we had to repaint or wallpaper at least twice
a year. My</b>
<br><b>father or mother would then have to pick me up and hold me as close
to the</b>
<br><b>ceiling or floor as possible. the worse it got the higher or lower
i had to</b>
<br><b>be. their were times when my poor parents spent the entire night
running</b>
<br><b>between the attic and the basement because i would not stop screaming
that</b>
<br><b>they were after me. when i finally woke up my parents asked me what
i was</b>
<br><b>dreaming about i could never remember. my father fell off a table
one trying</b>
<br><b>to get me as clost to the ceiling as he could. My room was always
cold to</b>
<br><b>me. it was a different ki!</b>
<br><b>nd of cold, like a clamy (sp?) c</b>
<br><b>old. the only other time i ever felt a cold like that was when i
worked in a</b>

<br><b>remember to much about the visit, but what i do remember is that
there were</b>
<br><b>lots of people in her waiting room, some kids too. She talked to
me about</b>
<br><b>what i was seeing and hearing, why i was having so many nightmares

<br><b>Old House in Windsor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jodi@bardstown.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am 14 and live in the state of Kentucky although I was born in
Tampa, Florida. And every year my family visits Sarasota, Florida for Christmas
and visit relatives. One time while cleaning out my Grandpa's garage, I
found a old picture of his old house in Windsor with him standing outside.
I asked my Pepe (French for grandpa) about the picture. He told me that
the house was haunted by a farmer who died in a tractor accident. He told
me stories about some nights when they would wake up and smell something
that smelled alot like something had just died. He then showed me a picture
that he managed to get of a face in the fall of the basement where my uncle
slept.</b>

<br><b>Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Brie.Doby@i-structure.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>First, please let me give you a bit of history about the women in
my family.</b>
<br><b>For some reason, some type of clairvoyance has managed to spill
throughout</b>
<br><b>the women in my family.&nbsp; My Mother is "infamous" for her ability
to feel</b>
<br><b>good and evil otherworldly presences in buildings that she has never
even</b>
<br><b>visited before.</b>
<br><b>My older sister (by 7 years) has the eerie ability to "see" the
dead, i.e.,</b>
<br><b>there have been numerous times that I have introduced her to one
of my</b>
<br><b>friends, only to have her suddenly begin talking about their deceased
Aunt</b>
<br><b>or Mother who was still "with" them, and then proceed to dole out
specific</b>
<br><b>details, such as their name, occupation, etc.</b>
<br><b>Even as a small child, I was always privy to odd dreams foretelling
of some</b>
<br><b>event that was to happen - whether it be good or bad.</b>
<br><b>This bit of history out of the way, allow me to tell my tale...</b>
<br><b>When I was in third grade, 1984, my family moved to a neighborhood
outside</b>
<br><b>of Lawton, OK, called Wichita Mountain Estates.&nbsp; The house
was previously</b>
<br><b>occupied by a policeman who was transferring out of state, his wife,
Penny,</b>
<br><b>and two children.&nbsp; We had met this friendly family before we
ever moved in</b>
<br><b>(they had been in the house a while and wanted to "approve" of the
incoming</b>
<br><b>family, as it were).&nbsp; The first year in the house was unremarkable,
quite</b>
<br><b>typical, actually.</b>
<br><b>The activity began the second year.&nbsp; One night, I awoke suddenly
from sleep</b>
<br><b>and sat straight up in bed.&nbsp; I saw a white figure seemingly
glide from in</b>
<br><b>front of my sister's room, past the bathroom between our rooms,
and pause to</b>
<br><b>look directly at me.&nbsp; I felt very strange, but not really that
frightened.</b>
<br><b>Because of this, I dismissed it as a dream, and promptly fell back
asleep.</b>
<br><b>The next morning, the apparition remained in my thoughts, but didn't
concern</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; My sister pulled me aside at breakfast that morning and
whispered in my</b>
<br><b>ear "I have something I need to tell you."&nbsp; On the walk to
the bus stop she</b>
<br><b>confided in me.&nbsp; She proceeded to tell me of a dream she had.</b>
<br><b>She dreamed that in the middle of the night, she awoke to use the
bathroom.</b>
<br><b>In front of the bathroom stood Penny (the former lady of the house)
leaning</b>
<br><b>casually against the frame of the bathroom.&nbsp; She was dressed
very formally,</b>
<br><b>and when my sister asked her what she was doing there, Penny replied
that</b>
<br><b>she had been killed, and was awaiting burial.&nbsp; My sister spoke
to her only</b>
<br><b>briefly after that, and went back to bed without ever using the
bathroom.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>then told her of what I had seen, and even though Penny had been
completely</b>
<br><b>non-threatening, we shut up about it quickly - we were, after all,
two young</b>
<br><b>girls who could barely comprehend what we had both seen.&nbsp; We
decided to keep</b>
<br><b>quiet about it.</b>
<br><b>That night at dinner, with a somber expression my mother told us
of Penny's</b>
<br><b>death in a car accident.&nbsp; My sister and I looked at each other,
fearful.</b>
<br><b>Not a word was said about what we had seen.&nbsp; Though my Mother
was opened</b>
<br><b>minded about such things, my Father was very adamant that such things
were</b>
<br><b>foolishness, and certainly not to be discussed in his presence.</b>
<br><b>Odd things began happening after that.&nbsp; When my Mother and
I would fight, I</b>
<br><b>would run to my room, only to be scared away by my light going off
and on.</b>
<br><b>When no one else was in the house, I would come into my room to
find that</b>
<br><b>every article of clothing had been removed from my dresser and placed
in the</b>
<br><b>center of my bed.&nbsp; Additionally, years later, when my sister
had already</b>
<br><b>moved out of the house, and no one was there but me during the Summer,
I</b>
<br><b>would step outside, only to come in to a record playing on the stereo,
or</b>
<br><b>the radio turned on full volume.&nbsp; "Penny" liked my room, and
would hang out</b>
<br><b>in or around my closet.&nbsp; This I believe because very often,
even in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the summer, this area in my room would be icy-cold, cold
enough to</b>
<br><b>numb your toes. (Should you be poking them around in there.)</b>
<br><b>These were things that frightened me, but I never felt threatened.</b>
<br><b>Regardless, at this point, I hadn't told my Mother anything.&nbsp;
One day she</b>
<br><b>approached me.&nbsp; She began talking about some feelings she had
been getting</b>
<br><b>for quite a while, but didn't want to scare me.&nbsp; These "feelings"
were</b>
<br><b>focused on not just my closet area, but the cloak-closet that was
directly</b>
<br><b>behind it, on the other side of the wall.&nbsp; (This is approximately
where I</b>
<br><b>saw the apparition dissapear years before.)&nbsp; I then told her
everything.</b>
<br><b>She listened in horror, mouth gaping.&nbsp; Now, at this time, I
was probably</b>
<br><b>about 13, and these things had been happening for quite some time,
but my</b>
<br><b>Mother didn't believe it was Penny.&nbsp; (Keep in mind she had
been dealing with</b>
<br><b>her clairvoyance far longer than I, at age 13.)&nbsp; She felt that
something was</b>
<br><b>quite otherworldly, but it was not an earthbound spirit - not unlike
some</b>
<br><b>things you had seen at your parents house.&nbsp; We were there another
2 years,</b>
<br><b>and I chose to believe that it was Penny, because I didn't want
to scare</b>
<br><b>myself further.&nbsp; But as I read your story, I wonder if when
Penny did come</b>
<br><b>to visit, if something from the "other side" came with her to reside.&nbsp;
You</b>
<br><b>see, after much thought on this, the apparition I had seen did not
look like</b>
<br><b>a human - perhaps it wasn't?</b>
<br><b>Thank you for the opportunity to tell this story, and the time it
took you</b>
<br><b>to read it.&nbsp; Please feel free to contact me with any thoughts
or questions.</b>

<br><b>I have more than I can tell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MilwKath@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am fifty-five years old this Nov 10.</b>
<br><b>I am born and rise in the Paranormal flied.&nbsp; It runs on both
side of my</b>
<br><b>family so far back we are not sure as to whom was the first to have
had it.</b>
<br><b>As for ghosts, I have lived with them my whole life.&nbsp; So much
so that they</b>
<br><b>really have to go out of there way to get my attention.&nbsp; If
I were to tell</b>
<br><b>you about all the things that has happened to my family and my self,
you</b>
<br><b>would never believe me.</b>
<br><b>But I will tell you of the house we use to live at in Milwaukee,
Wi</b>
<br><b>In 1961&nbsp; after living in this old 15 room brick home which
at that time was</b>
<br><b>about&nbsp; seventy years old.&nbsp; The city of Milwaukee bought
it from us.&nbsp; We had</b>
<br><b>only a few moths left before we moved.&nbsp; The house was always
haunted but it</b>
<br><b>was until years later that I frond out the story behide the haunting.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, It was a Saturday in early fall.&nbsp; I got up went into
the living area.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;In doing so I had to go through the dinning area.&nbsp; Now
as most people know</b>
<br><b>the older home had beautiful woodwork throughout the home.&nbsp;
On the walls of</b>
<br><b>the dinning are were wood rails that went all around.&nbsp; We had
picture siting</b>
<br><b>on them.&nbsp; My Picture with&nbsp; Angelo And pictures of another
family members.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>look up at them not really knowing why.&nbsp; I saw what seem to
be blood running</b>
<br><b>down the wall.&nbsp; It run around mine and Angelo picture, but
run across the</b>
<br><b>pictures of the others.</b>
<br><b>I call my father(which whom was well know in the Psychic field of
his time)</b>
<br><b>He looked at it and saw&nbsp; it running slowly down.&nbsp; He said
let to into the</b>
<br><b>attic and see if a cat or mouse had gotten&nbsp; between the wall.&nbsp;
The walls of</b>
<br><b>this old house are wide and one can see all the way down to the
basement.&nbsp; So</b>
<br><b>up we went into a part of the house I hated more than that of the</b>
<br><b>basement.(which I found out later why)</b>
<br><b>We took a spotlight and looked between the walls, Nothing to be
seen anywhere.</b>
<br><b>so we tried to clean the blood off with what ever we could when
it stopped</b>
<br><b>running.</b>
<br><b>Nothing would take it off.&nbsp; And even tho we were not going
to be in that</b>
<br><b>house for long, we did not want to look at it. So we tried to paint
over it.</b>
<br><b>Try is the right word!</b>
<br><b>It peeled off.&nbsp; We hear crying every so often as if someone
was so very sad</b>
<br><b>that we where going.&nbsp; But with this laughter as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The laughter was the</b>
<br><b>first time any of us heard over the many year of odd happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But when we</b>
<br><b>moved to the west side of town, one of the younger ghost came with
us.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>we moved into this house on walnut st we came to fined out that
an old man</b>
<br><b>living there died&nbsp; in it and was haunting this house.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Boy can my family</b>
<br><b>pick them.</b>
<br><b>There is a lot more that has happened to us.&nbsp; So much so we
could write a</b>
<br><b>book.&nbsp; But as I said before,&nbsp; You would never believe
so much can happen to</b>
<br><b>one family.</b>
<br><b>I just thought this story you might like to hear about.</b>

<p><b>I Want to Tell My Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Marelle1976@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>First of all, I am not a person who is knowledgable of any gost/spirit</b>
<br><b>anything, but I have a very real "ghost story" to share.&nbsp; I
happened upon</b>
<br><b>this site, sorta by mistake.&nbsp; Call me a skeptic or what you
will, but my own</b>
<br><b>experience-I cannot look away from or question, because I was there.&nbsp;
I still</b>
<br><b>am some what skeptical of what other people tell me, but I do believe
myself.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am 24 years old now, in 2000 and I this happened
when I was about 15</b>
<br><b>years old.&nbsp; My best friend also a 15 year old at the time,
and I decided to</b>
<br><b>sneak out of our home during the night and go tee pee houses.&nbsp;
Her house was</b>
<br><b>located in Selah, Washington about 3 miles north of town.&nbsp;
We had set out on</b>
<br><b>our journey toilet paper in hand, at about 12am.&nbsp; We walked
past the farm</b>
<br><b>houses, and down the dimly lit gravel roads until we reaced our
destination.</b>
<br><b>The only street lights were those lights which detect motion and
a few barn</b>
<br><b>lights.&nbsp; We laughed as we tee peed unsuspecting homes and we
ran around as</b>
<br><b>young teens do.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 3am or so, we decided to head back home.&nbsp;
About a mile from her</b>
<br><b>home as we were walking past a farm, I felt an uncontrollable chill
roll up</b>
<br><b>my spine and the little hairs along my neck felt alive, goosebumps
everywhere</b>
<br><b>and unable to walk anymore I looked to my left.&nbsp; Holding my
best friends arm,</b>
<br><b>I saw an absolutely unmistakable figure.&nbsp; The figure was a
very vibrant</b>
<br><b>lighted white farmer figure with a pitching fork in his left hand,
forks to</b>
<br><b>the ground.&nbsp; He was in coveralls and a straw hat, all which
were the same</b>
<br><b>vibrant white, and he was standing in the poorly fenced field facing
us and</b>
<br><b>not moving.&nbsp; I can't remeber making out a face, but I knew
it was a farmer.</b>
<br><b>He was about 50 yards away from us, as we stood on the gravel road.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked away towards Tish, and she was staring
too!&nbsp; I made her look at</b>
<br><b>me and tell me what she felt.&nbsp; She started breathing hard,
and talking fast</b>
<br><b>and high as she described the same thing I felt.&nbsp; She had felt
it too.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>I looked again as we started to run, I saw only a small white horse
grazing</b>
<br><b>in the same spot that the figure had been.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Running, crying and gasping for air, Tish and
I climbed back in the</b>
<br><b>window of her home.&nbsp; Trying to collect myself, I looked at
her and made her</b>
<br><b>tell me if she saw anything, and if so what.&nbsp; She described
to me the exact</b>
<br><b>same white figure that I saw.&nbsp; She described everything but
the hat, I was</b>
<br><b>STUNNED!&nbsp; Needless to say, we never discussed that night with
eachother much</b>
<br><b>afterwards, and have since lost contact over the years.&nbsp; But
I must say, I</b>
<br><b>will never forget the feelings I felt that night, nor will I forget
what I</b>
<br><b>saw, and I know this ghost story is true!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to here an evaluation of what I

<br><b>THE KNITTING GHOST</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp;&nbsp; DCRAWFORD@ci.baton-rouge.la.us</b><b></b>
<p><b>Although I did not experience this first-hand, it was told to me
by the</b>
<br><b>eyewitness, whose story became increasingly credible as she went
along.</b>
<br><b>After you read this you'll understand.</b>
<br><b>I live in Baton Rouge, LA.&nbsp; One evening recently, I stopped
at a local</b>
<br><b>coffeehouse after work to meet a few friends.&nbsp; They had not
yet arrived, so</b>
<br><b>I got my coffee and claimed a table.</b>
<br><b>I enjoy knitting, so I usually carry a small project in my tote
bag.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>pulled out my project (a pair of hiking socks) and began knitting.</b>
<br><b>After a few moments, I noticed that a woman at the adjacent table
was</b>
<br><b>watching me very intensely.&nbsp; After a few moments, she said,
"Excuse me, but</b>
<br><b>with so many needles, is that knitting, or crochet, or what?"&nbsp;
I explained</b>
<br><b>that I was knitting, showed her my work, and explained that socks
are done</b>
<br><b>in the round, requiring the use of several needles.</b>
<br><b>The woman replied that she didn't know how to knit or crochet, and
had</b>
<br><b>always assumed that knitting involved using two needles and murmuring
"knit</b>
<br><b>one, purl two."&nbsp; Then she said, "There's a reason I'm asking.&nbsp;
You're not</b>
<br><b>going to believe this, but..."</b>
<br><b>She then went on to explain that several years ago, she was living
in a very</b>
<br><b>old house downtown that had been divided into apartments.&nbsp;
She lived</b>
<br><b>upstairs.&nbsp; One winter morning, just before dawn, she was awakened
by a</b>
<br><b>sensation of extreme cold.&nbsp; She could also hear a soft clicking
noise.</b>
<br><b>Thinking the furnace had gone out, she woke up.&nbsp; As she opened
her eyes, she</b>
<br><b>saw a figure standing across the room.&nbsp; It was the figure of
a pretty young</b>
<br><b>woman, wearing a turn-of-the-century dress, standing at the window
and</b>
<br><b>gazing outside with a worried look on her face.&nbsp; And the ghost&nbsp;
was busy</b>
<br><b>knitting what appeared to be a long sock or stocking.</b>
<br><b>The woman said she was too scared to move, and that she viewed this</b>
<br><b>apparition for at least a minute or two, possibly longer, before
it faded</b>
<br><b>and disappeared.&nbsp; She noticed that the ghost was using "really
thin yarn and</b>
<br><b>shiny silver needles" and that at one point "a needle came out of
her work</b>
<br><b>and she put it back in."</b>
<br><b>This gave the story credibility, because this woman was describing
a</b>
<br><b>knitting technique that a non-knitter would not have known about.&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>also describing archaic knitting needles.&nbsp; Very few non-knitters
know that</b>
<br><b>multiple needles are involved in knitting tubular items like socks--and</b>
<br><b>indeed, an empty needle comes out of the knitting, and is worked
back in.</b>
<br><b>Even fewer know that turn-of-the-century needles were made of steel,
which</b>
<br><b>would have appeared to be "shiny, silver needles" as viewed by the</b>
<br><b>streetlight coming in the window -- modern knitting needles are
usually made</b>
<br><b>of plastic or adonized aluminum, both having a matte finish, usually
in a</b>
<br><b>non-silver color.&nbsp; The description of "really thin yarn" would
also have</b>
<br><b>been consistent with popular knitting of the turn of the century.&nbsp;
Most</b>
<br><b>popular patterns were done in much thinner yarn, and worked on much
finer</b>
<br><b>needles, than the typical modern knitter is willing to deal with.</b>
<br><b>So although this isn't first-hand, I give it my vote for authenticity.</b>

<p><b>CryBaby Lane</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>LaGrange, Kentucky- outside the city limits is a road called"Bohannon
Lane" - to the locals,it is known as "Crybaby lane". If you go down the
road until you come to where the gravel starts, stop your car and crack
your windows. After a few minutes you will hear the wind pick up , though
nothing will actually blow in front of you.Leave your headlights on, and
after a few minutes you will sense that your car has "moved" further down
the road.In the woods to your right, you will glimpse reddish-colored eyes
looking at you.If your nerve holds out , after about 1/2 hour,you will
hear the cry of an baby in the woods-at about this time , the eyes will
look towards the sound.Legend has it , that back in the settlement days
of Kentucky, two families lived in these woods, and were attacked by marauding
indians one night.The men held ground, while the women and children slipped
out the back way.All the women and children got away, except one mother
, and her newborn infant.She was running thru the woods, and could hear
the sounds of the indians catching up to her. Hoping to draw the indians
away from her child, she placed him in his blankets, in an old, hollowed-out
tree stump,and continued running, away from the baby.She was caught, and
since the menfolk had already been killed, ther was no one left to save
the baby.The baby died in the stump, crying for it's mother that had given
her own life , trying to save the baby.The baby still cries....This can
be heard in mid-autumn , usually after about 9:00 p.m.There have been reports
of vehicles being attacked by unseen assailants.Later on , flint arrowheads
have been found embedded in the bodywork of those cars.Most people lose
their nerve right before this happens, as a general feeling of dread and
doom is noted.Those that hold out, are attacked by these unseen assailants,
even if the area around the vehicle is illuminated.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:svenson1@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a few experiences, I will start with
my wifes experience first.</b>
<br><b>When she was 10, her adopted mother passed away after a long battle
with</b>
<br><b>cancer. Late one night my wife was awakened by her adopted mother
telling</b>
<br><b>her it would be ok and to sleep well. This was odd because her adoptive</b>
<br><b>mother could not walk and could not have come to see her. A few
moments</b>
<br><b>later her father entered her room and told her that her mother had
passed</b>
<br><b>away. Her adopted brother had the same experience at the same time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My experiences were here, in Bethel Ct.
I was about 12 or 13 and I</b>
<br><b>always thought I had seen weird things. I was awakened one night
to the</b>
<br><b>sounds of scratching on my door, at first I thought it was the family
cat</b>
<br><b>but he was asleep in my Parents room. I thought nothing of it and
went back</b>
<br><b>to sleep. A few minutes later I woke up and could not move, I saw
a dark</b>
<br><b>apparition next to my bed that seemed to be moving closer, it felt
as if I</b>
<br><b>was shaking uncontrollably but I could not speak or yell. I finally
managed</b>
<br><b>to get up and it was still there, I yelled and it was gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father has also had experiences where
when he was home alone, he</b>
<br><b>would hear creaking across the floor like footsteps and the bed
would settle</b>
<br><b>down as if someone sat at the foot of it. I also had this happen
and we also</b>
<br><b>used to hear scratching and childrens voices often late at night
in our</b>
<br><b>hallway. My stepmother also used to hear something clawing the back
of our</b>
<br><b>recliner when she was feeding my baby brother, only to find that
cat was</b>
<br><b>outside.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I was baptised this all stopped.
Any help would be appreciated as</b>
<br><b>I have a young daughter now and am concerned about this because
I sometimes</b>
<br><b>hear these things again, I also sometimes get the overwhelming feeling</b>
<br><b>someone is in the room with me when I am alone. I get the same feelings
of</b>
<br><b>fear that I felt when I was younger.</b>
