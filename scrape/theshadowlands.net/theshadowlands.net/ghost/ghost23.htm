<P>
<P><B>    My grandfather , who is not a believer in the paranormal , finally
</B>
<P><B>confessed this experience to me one evening when I was relating all
the </B>
<P><B>odd family ghost stories to him . </B>
<P><B>     He was driving to work , he did the midnight shift at the airline
</B>
<P><B>plant , and took his short cut on a back country road . As he crossed
</B>
<P><B>over the railroad tracks he'd crossed a thousand times before , an
</B>
<P><B>apparition of a young boy materialized in the passengers seat , turned
to </B>
<P><B>smile at my grandpa , and slowly "misted out" . He didn't just disappear
</B>
<P><B>as abrubtly as he'd shown up , but rather dissipated like a fog . Grandpa
</B>
<P><B>just figured he was tired (not that he would confess anything even
</B>
<P><B>remotely similar to fear !) , and didn't ponder over the experience
. </B>
<P><B>When I asked him if he thought it occurred near the RR tracks because
</B>
<P><B>perhaps the boy haunted that location , he replied that he instead
</B>
<P><B>thought the lad was somehow connected to the car instead . Apparently
my </B>
<P><B>uncle had bought it at a police auction of sorts , and grandpa thought
</B>
<P><B>that maybe the boy had died as a result of an automobile fatality .
Who </B>
<P><B>knows where these things are concerned ?!!</B>

<H3><A NAME=warning>Could be a Warning?</A>
</H3><P><B>by Teopista@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Two years ago our apartment flooded.  I think I had a warning two weeks
before it happened.  I was sitting in front of the Tv when I hear a male
voice whisper Hey! in my ear.  That night when I went to bed I felt what
was like two fingers rubbing up and down my arm.  It felt really cold and
it was very gentle.  I saw the hair moving on my are were the fingers were.
 When I said stop it, it stopped.  I some times have the feeling that someone
is staining in the hall watching me.  I think if I look that I will see something
and it scares me.   When we first moved into this apartment We felt like
someone we watching us  work on the computer we got the feeling of utter
fasintion.   I think that we were warned again a year ago when we had the
other flood on April first.  I was saying good-night to my mother and another
voice responded with a good-night also.  Two days later we flooded.  I hope
to never hear that voice again because I do not want to flood again.  But
if there is someone here.  ( I think male) I hope and I think we can live
in harmony.     </B>

<H3><A NAME=kansas>Small Kansas Town</A>
</H3><P><B>by coulterc@worldnet.att.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>While in graduate  school in Emporia, Kansas (a small, mid-Kansas
town</B>
<P><B>known best for its favorite son, William Allen White), my partner and
I</B>
<P><B>rented an old, dilapidated house that was divided into three
apartments,</B>
<P><B>ours being the largest.  The entire time we were there, we would</B>
<P><B>occasionally hear strange things and on one occasion my partner had
more</B>
<P><B>"direct" contact.  The house is old and sort of broken down, but it
was all</B>
<P><B>we could afford (graduate school being so expensive).  I would guess
it was</B>
<P><B>built in the '30s or early '40s.  Our apartment consisted of a living
room</B>
<P><B>and kitchen downstairs, and two bedrooms and a bath upstairs.  Often,
when</B>
<P><B>one of us was upstairs and the other downstairs, we would hear the
other</B>
<P><B>calling for us very clearly-but upon questioning the other, nothing
had</B>
<P><B>really been said.  When this happened to me, it always sounded like
my</B>
<P><B>partner needed me for something urgently and was calling my name. 
My</B>
<P><B>partner and I both experienced this many times, usually when we were
both</B>
<P><B>in the house, but once or twice it happened when we were alone.  We
never</B>
<P><B>saw anything, but once my partner had a rather frightening experience.
 We</B>
<P><B>had just returned home from a night class, and I was upstairs in the</B>
<P><B>bedroom while she was  still downstairs in the living room.  I heard
her</B>
<P><B>scream loudly and I ran down to see what the problem was.  She  was
quite</B>
<P><B>shaken, and said that she had just been pinched.  At first she thought
it</B>
<P><B>was me sneaking up behind her, but when she turned around, there was</B>
<P><B>nothing there and she screamed in fright.</B>
<P><B>I thought you might be interested to hear from the Midwest!  Seems
like</B>
<P><B>there's spooks everywhere.</B>

<H3><A NAME=not>An Experience or Not?</A>
</H3><P><B>by chartony@jdv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Years ago, I had 2 "encounters" while I was still living with my</B>
<P><B>parents.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first time I awoke, on the top bunk of bunk beds. My younger
sister</B>
<P><B>was on the bottom bunk. The beds were behind the door. I opened my
eyes</B>
<P><B>from sleep, and some"one" was there looking at me. I could only see
one</B>
<P><B>"eye" of this thing. The eye was only dark, no colors what-so-ever.
And</B>
<P><B>the entire figure, that I could see, anyway, was somewhat
translucent,</B>
<P><B>but yet it wasn't, I don't know if you understand that or not.  I was</B>
<P><B>young and so terrified, that I closed my eyes and wished it away.
Though</B>
<P><B>I was not in fear, just afraid of something that I didn't know what
it</B>
<P><B>was or what I was seeing. None of that sense of evil, doom or
whatever</B>
<P><B>else some may call their experiences.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next thing I knew it was the next morning and I had gotten up
like</B>
<P><B>normal. Just to dismiss this as "well maybe this did not happen".</B>
<P>
<P><B>Some time later, I had been "sleep walking". My dad had retrieved me</B>
<P><B>midway to the basement. I did not recall this event until my mom had</B>
<P><B>brought this up to me that I was going to the basement and upon
hearing</B>
<P><B>my wake and move through the house in the middle of the night, they
had</B>
<P><B>investigated this.  Upon hearing this, I recalled actually looking
into</B>
<P><B>the basement and seeing of all thing, strange as it may sound, four
of</B>
<P><B>these "people", that I had witnessed previously, and they appeared
to be</B>
<P><B>"sitting around a table(that was not actually there), playing cards?</B>
<P><B>this is what it appeared to me, some distance away from them, however.
I</B>
<P><B>again felt no malice or harm, just maybe some pulling or curiousity?
I</B>
<P><B>don't know how to describe this.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Maybe unrelated, since these seemed of no harm, at a friends home
some</B>
<P><B>years later, maybe 10 years, I had been sleeping at her house for the</B>
<P><B>evening and she had awaken during the night and came to check the
house</B>
<P><B>to make sure all was OK and say what she described as a young boy</B>
<P><B>sitting at my feet while I slept, the only way she could describe
this</B>
<P><B>was that he looked at her when she walked into the room, eyes open</B>
<P><B>Sitting at my feet. She said maybe an Angel watching over me or</B>
<P><B>something, but this left a definate impression on the both of us. She</B>
<P><B>did not try to make contact that I am aware of. And she did not feel
any</B>
<P><B>harm to herself or me at the time. She thought her eyes were playing</B>
<P><B>tricks, and went to get her glasses and still was the little boy
sitting</B>
<P><B>there. I am not sure what to think about this, I have yet to see this</B>
<P><B>little one "Guarding Me", but I do hope that this is true and someone
is</B>
<P><B>actually looking out for me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=friend>A Friend's Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by Katie=Martin%ISHC%IM=Hou@netgate.compaq.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>A friend of mine had recently moved with her husband and new baby into
a</B>
<P><B>duplex near downtown Denver.  The house had at one time been a single</B>
<P><B>residence, but the current owner turned it into a duplex for rental</B>
<P><B>purposes.</B>
<P><B>   They didn't notice anything strange about the house at first, but
my</B>
<P><B>friend said that she began feeling like there was someone else in the</B>
<P><B>house, even when it was just her and her daughter at home.  She said
that</B>
<P><B>at times it seemed like her daughter, who was around a year old, would
be</B>
<P><B>looking at something that she couldn't see, and reacting to it,
usually</B>
<P><B>with a smile or a laugh, like whatever it was was making a funny face
at</B>
<P><B>her.  She never felt uncomfortable with this unseen visitor, due to
her</B>
<P><B>little girl's reaction to it.</B>
<P><B>   The more they lived there, the more the spirit seemed to manifest</B>
<P><B>itself.  My friend had always seemed more spiritually "in tune" than
most</B>
<P><B>people, and that could be why. The spirit could later be heard
walking</B>
<P><B>around the house, sitting on the couch, basically making itself at
home. </B>
<P><B>Later, when another couple moved into the other apartment, they too</B>
<P><B>reported that they could hear someone shuffling around at night, but
being</B>
<P><B>open minded, it didn't seem to bother them.</B>
<P><B>   After about two years in the house, my friend finally saw the ghost.
</B>
<P><B>She said that it was quite disconcerting.  She had left her daughter
in the</B>
<P><B>living room, to go to the kitchen to get lunch.  When she came back,
she</B>
<P><B>saw a figure of a man at the end of the hall.  She could only see him</B>
<P><B>faintly from the waist up, and that the most striking thing about it
figure</B>
<P><B>was the big red X on its back.  She said that she let out a little
scream,</B>
<P><B>and the figure vanished.  She never saw it again, but she and her
husband</B>
<P><B>still heard it, and her daughter still seemed to be able to see it,
as well</B>
<P><B>as hear it.</B>
<P><B>   She finally decided to do some investigating, and made inquiries
with</B>
<P><B>some of the older residents in the neighborhood.  It turned out that
the</B>
<P><B>house had been owned by a very nice man who had dearly loved it, and
took</B>
<P><B>great care of it.  He had been a fireman, and had been killed during
a</B>
<P><B>blaze.  This was the key that she had been looking for, as it explained
the</B>
<P><B>red X on the man's back.  It had to have been the red suspenders that
the</B>
<P><B>firemen had worn at the time.  It also lent creedence to her feelings
that</B>
<P><B>this spirit was very kind and protective, and had seemed to "adopt"
her</B>
<P><B>family as his own.</B>
<P><B>   I haven't spoken with this woman for a very long time, so I don't
know</B>
<P><B>if she's still in the house or not, or if they are still there, whether
the</B>
<P><B>haunting continued.  I just thought that you might find this story</B>
<P><B>interesting.</B>

<H3><A NAME=room>The Room</A>
</H3><P><B>by lenag@psci.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello, I'm a 16/f and i'm from Indiana..I have been reading through
the</B>
<P><B>stories and i noticed that a lot of them happened to younger children</B>
<P><B>and teenagers..or people with the company of younger people..i have
had</B>
<P><B>many experiences myself..and i'm a firm believer in the
supernatural..I</B>
<P><B>know you want stories...i have so many i don't know where to start..</B>
<P><B>well i will tell you about what i've generally picked up about the</B>
<P><B>entity..It has taken on its territory..there is a certain room in the</B>
<P><B>house that NOONE can sleep in..i've had several friends that i put
in</B>
<P><B>there to sleep..who had no prior knowledge to the history of the room
or</B>
<P><B>house come running out into my bedroom..telling me they feel
shaken..I</B>
<P><B>myself have tried to sleep in that room..there is no way..i can't
stay</B>
<P><B>in that room alone more than 5 min. max. One of the more stranger of
all</B>
<P><B>the events happened when i was remodeling my room..we were just
painting</B>
<P><B>and changing furniture and such..when i started to notice a liquid</B>
<P><B>coming out of the wall..it was a light red..my father was also</B>
<P><B>there..and he is a carpenter..he was totally shocked..he had no idea</B>
<P><B>what it could be..it came out faster than i could wipe it up..there
were</B>
<P><B>no water lines or anything in the walls there..</B>
<P><B>Since i've gotten older these occurances have certainly slowed</B>
<P><B>down...I've been chased around the house..i'm still very upset about</B>
<P><B>what happened when i was a child..something i couldn't see chasing</B>
<P><B>me..all i could do was hear the footsteps..and the wind and
breath..it</B>
<P><B>mortified me..my parents have only experienced a few happenings in
the</B>
<P><B>house..the sound of an organ playing late one night..which woke
everyone</B>
<P><B>in the house up..my parents just told us to go back to bed..that it
was</B>
<P><B>just a radio or something..it wasn't..When someone tells me that they</B>
<P><B>don't believe it..something bad happens..things will fly across the</B>
<P><B>room..or the banisters will shake..as it happens..my sister had a
baby</B>
<P><B>around 4 yrs ago..thats when this started slowing down..but the</B>
<P><B>experiences have now moved into her house..but they only happen when
the</B>
<P><B>child is away..for the weekend..toys will start coming on..rocking</B>
<P><B>chairs will move..or you will be able to hear someone walking</B>
<P><B>around..another time that it occurs is when its just me and her in
the</B>
<P><B>house..my sisters boyfriend * a real skeptic* turned into a believer
a</B>
<P><B>few weeks after he moved in the house..it has also been</B>
<P><B>dangerous..causing mass hysteria in my house..although my parents
will</B>
<P><B>not believe that there is something to this house..they both admit
that</B>
<P><B>they do believe in ghosts..we have given it a name.."henry" but i
think</B>
<P><B>there is more than one ghost..we live on indian grounds..where we
still</B>
<P><B>discover arrowheads and such around in the area..but when i was a
child</B>
<P><B>i remember rolling over..and there was a lady beside me..standing
there</B>
<P><B>as if..kinda watching me..i rolled over trying to make it go away by</B>
<P><B>ignoring it..*which doesn't work..they will not let you ignore there</B>
<P><B>presence* she started hovering over the top of me..</B>
<P><B>Indiana has become a place of many many many ghost stories..in the
place</B>
<P><B>i live..there have been several murders..this year..its a small</B>
<P><B>town..and none of the murders have been solved..there isn't even a</B>
<P><B>suspect..but in the place that one of the people were killed..months</B>
<P><B>before we were up in that cemetery..*ironically someone was killed
in a</B>
<P><B>cemetery* just goofing off with our friends..and I heard a voice say</B>
<P><B>"HEY" i thought it was a game warden or something and i was</B>
<P><B>terrified..cause some friends of mine had alcohol..but then i looked
and</B>
<P><B>it was a shadowy figure..kinda floating..I grabbed my friend and
started</B>
<P><B>shaking him..trying to get his attention..he had heard the voice
to..and</B>
<P><B>was scared..we all hopped in the car and took off as fast as</B>
<P><B>possible..later on * a few months later* we took a wrong turn and
ended</B>
<P><B>up back on that road..there were bright blue lights..and strange</B>
<P><B>figures..we stopped turned around and got the hell out of there as
fast </B>
<P><B>as we possibly could..I'm not forsure what to make of theses</B>
<P><B>experiences..I have so many more but if i wrote them all it would</B>
<P><B>definitly turn into a novel..I've kinda almost gotten used to it..at
one</B>
<P><B>time i was going to just tell everyone that i was crazy..cause i
thought</B>
<P><B>i was..it didn't make sense why all these things keep happening..but
now</B>
<P><B>i see that there is something which noone can understand trying to</B>
<P><B>communicate with me and my sister..I wish i only knew what though...</B>

<H3><A NAME=life>My Life</A>
</H3><P><B>by Roacherama@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>It is 1997.  I am 20 years old, about to turn 21 in October.  My life</B>
<P><B>has been filled with nothing but spirits.  These are my stories.......
</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I was born and raised in New Jersey.  In a small town called Cedar</B>
<P><B>Grove.  I lived in a semi-old house.  I believe it was built around
the</B>
<P><B>1950's.  It started at a very young age.  I was very, very young in</B>
<P><B>fact.  I must of been, say, 5 or 6.  My brother is about 7 years
older</B>
<P><B>than me, and we were simply playing together, minding our own
business</B>
<P><B>in the living room.  I noticed my brother staring at the wall.  I
looked</B>
<P><B>up to see something.  It was as if you were to have taken a small jug
of</B>
<P><B>paint and splattered it on the wall facing us.  Except it had two
eyes</B>
<P><B>and was watching us play.  It did nothing but seem to almost study
our</B>
<P><B>movements.  Finally, our mother looked in on us.  We both, at the
same</B>
<P><B>time, looked over at her.  She said we looked scared and asked about</B>
<P><B>what did that to us.  All I could do was point at the wall, and it
was</B>
<P><B>already gone.  My father got home from work, and I told him about
what</B>
<P><B>had happened, as best I could.  He told me that he believed that
there</B>
<P><B>were things in our house.  He said that before I was born, that my
aunt</B>
<P><B>Anne promised in her hospital bed, that she would make it to see me</B>
<P><B>born, no matter what.  She died abou2 days after I was born, without</B>
<P><B>seeing me.  He said, the day I came home from the hospital, they laid
me</B>
<P><B>in my crib and walked away for a moment.  My father turned back
because</B>
<P><B>he had forgotten something in my new room, and saw a shadow standing</B>
<P><B>over my crib.  He said he thought it was my aunt Anne.  But, was it?
</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>A few years went by.  I was around 8 now.  My brother and I had
gotten</B>
<P><B>into a fight because we both shared the same room.  So our parents</B>
<P><B>seperated us.  My brother John got his own room downstairs and I got
to</B>
<P><B>keep the old room.  Let me tell you the full lay-out of my house, so
you</B>
<P><B>can maybe understand me as I go through all my experiences.  You</B>
<P><B>approached my house from the street and walked through the small gate
on</B>
<P><B>our fence surrounding our house.  You walk up the path and up 6
stairs</B>
<P><B>to  our steel front door.  You walk in and see stairs going upwards.</B>
<P><B>You look towards the left of you, and that was our liviing room.  You</B>
<P><B>look towards the right, and there was our tv room.  Say you decide
to</B>
<P><B>walk through our tv room.  You  end up going around the stairs and</B>
<P><B>running to a small hall leading towards your right.  If you look down</B>
<P><B>that hall, you see 3 doors.  The first door on the left is the
bathroom.</B>
<P><B>The next 2 doors face each other.  Both very small guest rooms.  The</B>
<P><B>door to the left at the end of the hall was later converted into a</B>
<P><B>sewing room/guest room/playroom.  The door to your right was left as
a</B>
<P><B>very small  bedroom, the one my brother endedup keeping.  As you turn</B>
<P><B>your head straight after looking down the hall, you notice that
you've</B>
<P><B>stepped into the dining room.  Which was also very, very small.  To
the</B>
<P><B>left behind you, about 2 feet away is a door.  Open the door and
you'll</B>
<P><B>find that the cleaning liquids and brooms and other well assorted
junk</B>
<P><B>was kept there along the wall.  Tilt your head down a tad and you see</B>
<P><B>the stairs going to our basement.  Close that door and walk through
the</B>
<P><B>dining room.  As you walk by, you notice even further off more to the</B>
<P><B>left that you can see the living room.  It's like a full circle going</B>
<P><B>around the stairs.  The same stairs you saw as you walked in.  You
keep</B>
<P><B>walking forward though.  Now you run into our kitchen.  It was</B>
<P><B>relatively big.  Had one of those islands for the dishwasher and</B>
<P><B>everything.  Walk back to the stairs going upwards and now we
actually</B>
<P><B>go up them.  As you get closer to the top, you see a door.  It's a
small</B>
<P><B>closet for all of our extra clothes.  When you reach the top, you
look</B>
<P><B>to the left.  It's my bedroom.  To the right, my parents.  Now, I had
to</B>
<P><B>tell you all of this because in every single area of my old house,
I</B>
<P><B>have seen and experienced paranormal activity.  So now, back to where
I</B>
<P><B>was.  My brother got assigned his brand new room downstairs.  One
night,</B>
<P><B>I woke up very late.  For no reason, I walk into my parents bedroom.
 I</B>
<P><B>see them both sleeping.  I then walk over to my mom's side.  The side</B>
<P><B>which is closest to the door.  I  walk over and just look down at
her.</B>
<P><B>I look up at the far wall facing their bed and see one orange glowing</B>
<P><B>eye.  Just hovering about 2 feet away from that wall.  I did not get</B>
<P><B>scared nor did I even panic.  I walked over to it to see if it was
real.</B>
<P><B>I passes my hand through it.  It was like a human eye but odd colors.</B>
<P><B>The white of our eyes  was orange and the darker circle brown.  I
stood</B>
<P><B>behind it, and it vanished.  I crawled into bed with my parents.  I</B>
<P><B>still cn't remember being scared, but i wanted to be by them that
night.</B>
<P><B>As the months went by, my brother complained about his room.  He</B>
<P><B>couldn't sleep in it.  He didn't know why, but he just couldn't.  My</B>
<P><B>mother basically told him to suck it up.  It's a new place.  You have
to</B>
<P><B>try and adapt, she said.  Now, almost every night I heard bumps and</B>
<P><B>creaks.  As I drifted to sleep, my light would turn on and off. 
Which</B>
<P><B>grew to be a problem.  I was pretty afraid of the dark as it was.</B>
<P><B>Things would get broken and no one could figure out who or what did
it.</B>
<P><B>When I was around 11, I finally sucked in my pride and went to my
mother</B>
<P><B>about tese things that went bump in the night.  She said I must of
been</B>
<P><B>imagining it.  She said I drank too much soda at night, so my
caffiene</B>
<P><B>levels were basically playing with my mind.  A few months later, my
mom</B>
<P><B>and dad decided to kill off our basement stairs, just knock them out.</B>
<P><B>Cover up the whole and finish the basment as a small place to rent
out.</B>
<P><B>They wanted to cut out a piece of floor in our living room and make</B>
<P><B>brand new stairs.  I didn't mind so  much.  Just alittle extra noise
to</B>
<P><B>put up with was all it was to me.  I turned 12 and they were just
about</B>
<P><B>done with the new basement.  I wonder sometimes if this small</B>
<P><B>construction site bothered all the things in my house.  Because after</B>
<P><B>that, bad things began.  One day, I had just finished a great night's</B>
<P><B>sleep and opened up my eyes.  I tried to get up, and something had
my</B>
<P><B>pinned to my bed.  I  couldn't see it.  But it held me down.  I
became</B>
<P><B>scared.  I shut my eyes again.  I began to think why this was
happening.</B>
<P><B>I felt something right above me holding me, but I couldn't see it.
 I</B>
<P><B>opened my eyes again, and with all my strength, I sat up.  But this</B>
<P><B>time, it was gone.  In the wink of an eye, the feeling vanished.  I</B>
<P><B>went downstairs and continued as if nothing happened.  I didn't dare</B>
<P><B>mention it to anyone.  My mother never believed me in the first
place,</B>
<P><B>my father seemed to be getting sick of hearing me whine about these</B>
<P><B>things, and my brother made fun of me as it was.  Why add to that?
  A</B>
<P><B>few months went by and summer came along.  My parents came to John
and I</B>
<P><B>one Saturday and told us that we were going to the beach the next
day.</B>
<P><B>The beach was a big thing.  We lived an hour and a half away.  We
never</B>
<P><B>really went there that often.  Our parents told us to go to  bed
early</B>
<P><B>so we could get up at 5am to start the packing.  I was so excited
that</B>
<P><B>night.  I wattched tv in my room until midnight.  I still wasn't very</B>
<P><B>tired, but I figured that I needed the sleep.   I turned off my tv
and</B>
<P><B>went to go turn out the lights.  I laid down in my bed.  My head
rested</B>
<P><B>not 5 feet from my door.  Almost directly above me was my light
switch</B>
<P><B>in case of emergencies.  And ten I came into contact with my first</B>
<P><B>horrible presence.  As I began to drift away, a voice began talking.
 It</B>
<P><B>sounded like a man speaking almost directly into my ear.  He started</B>
<P><B>telling me that I was evil and he was going to take me to Hell with
him.</B>
<P><B>He said that I do not deserve my parents, and they do not deserve a</B>
<P><B>whiner like me.  He went on about dragging me with him and how bad
I</B>
<P><B>really was.  About 10 minutes later it stopped.  I was so terrified.</B>
<P><B>Nothing can come close to explaining that.  I was so afraid to open
my</B>
<P><B>eyes while he was talking.  I didn't want to open them and find out
that</B>
<P><B>it wasn't a prank of John's.  That nothing would be there.  After
about</B>
<P><B>5 minutes, I got up the guts to make a break for the light switch.
 I</B>
<P><B>flipped it on and looked around my room to find nothing.  I was so</B>
<P><B>scared I ran into my parents room.  I looked down the stairs, afraid
to</B>
<P><B>go down them, but I saw nothing but blackness.  I went back into my</B>
<P><B>parents room and woke them up to ask them if they had ben in my room</B>
<P><B>talking to me.  They said no, now go back to bed and stop drinking
so</B>
<P><B>much soda.  I went back to bed but never did I turn off the light,
and I</B>
<P><B>didn't fall back asleep until 4am.  From then  on till around 2 more</B>
<P><B>years, those major things stopped.  It</B>
<P><B> went back to the "bumps in the night" deal again.  I thought I was
over</B>
<P><B>the worst.  When I was 14, about a month after middle school had
started</B>
<P><B>(that was 7th grade by the way), my parents had my brother and I
adopt</B>
<P><B>two puppies because our older outside dog Lou had died.  So we went
to</B>
<P><B>the shelter and ended up getting our new pups.  John ended up getting</B>
<P><B>rid of his puppy.  After al long time, we couldn't get his dog to
stop</B>
<P><B>chewing things up.  So we gave him away tothe family friends in the</B>
<P><B>other town.  But my dog Flurry (She's mixed with toy collie and
samoya)</B>
<P><B>was still here to stay.  The basement was totally redone now.  It was</B>
<P><B>great.  We got wall to wall carpetting.  It had a bedroom, small</B>
<P><B>kitchen, little tv room and half a bathroom.  And my parents all did
it</B>
<P><B>by hand.  This now turned out to be a really cool hang out spot.  As
you</B>
<P><B>walked down the new basement stairs and got to the bottom, you could</B>
<P><B>peek around the door and see the new den.  If you turned around, you</B>
<P><B>could see where my parents put the washer and dryer.  If you
continued</B>
<P><B>looking, you  could see my parents made a small crawl hole in the
wall</B>
<P><B>facing you.  It went far, far back into the wall.  It was perfect for</B>
<P><B>our Christmas lights (My parents were big on Christmas.  We were the</B>
<P><B>talk of the town)   Flurry always stared down the stairs.  She would
do</B>
<P><B>nothing but lay at the top of the stairs and watch.  Well, John was
way</B>
<P><B>older now, 21 I believe he was.  He had a good auto parts job, he was
a</B>
<P><B>manager.  He offered my mom rent so he could live downstairs.  So he</B>
<P><B>moved downstairs in a day.  He would stay out all night long and come</B>
<P><B>home in the early morning.  I figured he was out partying all night.
 No</B>
<P><B>problem for us.  He ended up getting a birthday present from his</B>
<P><B>girlfriend.  It was a different puppy.  Her name is Moonlight (Yes,
my</B>
<P><B>brother is half hippy.  And Moonlight is a mix of white lab and
german</B>
<P><B>shepard).  Moonlight also wouldn't stay downstairs unless someone was</B>
<P><B>their with her.  Then Flurry would gather te guts to go their.  My</B>
<P><B>birthday came along and all I had asked for was a nice gold chain.
 My</B>
<P><B>mom actually got it for me.  one day, I took it off and laid it on
my</B>
<P><B>desk as I was cleaning my room.  I turned around and it was gone. 
Not 2</B>
<P><B>seconds later!  I was mad.  It was something that I know my mom saved</B>
<P><B>her pennies to get me.  And I knew exactly what had happened.  I
spoke</B>
<P><B>out this time in anger, "Give it back or else!  My mom works damn
hard.</B>
<P><B>Who do you tihink you are, huh?  This is mean!  I want it back now!
 I'm</B>
<P><B>going to turn my back and by the count of 10, I want it back where
it</B>
<P><B>was or you will surely pay this time!"  I turned around and counted.
 I</B>
<P><B>heard nothing.  I turned back around and looked at my desk and it was</B>
<P><B>exactly where I layed it.  I went to sleep happily that night thinking
I</B>
<P><B>had won the war.  Little did I know that it was only a small battle.
 I</B>
<P><B>woke up the next morning.  Frost that had melted and turned to very</B>
<P><B>small beads of water were on my window.  On my window the words "I</B>
<P><B>sorry" were written in the water.  I was then freaked out again. 
This</B>
<P><B>time, one of these things actually communicated.  But it was nice.
 Like</B>
<P><B>it was playing a prank or trying to be funny and knew it had gone too</B>
<P><B>far.  When I calmed down about half an hour later, I went back to my</B>
<P><B>room and talked outloud again.  I told it that I didn't mean to get
so</B>
<P><B>harsh, but other things have been mean to me there.  And that it was</B>
<P><B>just a very personal object.  And I told it to please not do that
again,</B>
<P><B>and I appreciated it very much that it did in fact return it and that
it</B>
<P><B>apologized so nicely.  Alittle more time goes by and my brother moves</B>
<P><B>out.  Now I'm getting ready to start 9th grade.  Since my apology,</B>
<P><B>things were ok.  The normal shadows ofcourse, the bumps.  Nothing
new.</B>
<P><B>My brother moves to Florida.  I figure that now is my chance to take
the</B>
<P><B>really cool basement apartment.  I ask my mom, she gives the ok.  I</B>
<P><B>begin the move.  I get a good majority of my things down there.  My
tv,</B>
<P><B>phone, computer, some poster, etc.  My brother leaves his waterbed,</B>
<P><B>which is a major plus.  I get ready to settle in for my first night
down</B>
<P><B>there.  I brought some reading material.  New Age stuff mostly.  I
was</B>
<P><B>doing much research into the paranormal and pagan issues then.  I get</B>
<P><B>kind of freaked out about the new area.  Especially while in the
kitchen</B>
<P><B>and bedroom. I get ready for bed.  I leave the kitchen light on
because</B>
<P><B>it made me feel better.  I lay down and snuggle into the waterbed.
 All</B>
<P><B>of a sudden, the kitchen light gets shut of on me.  I figure the bulb</B>
<P><B>went.  Before I get the energy to get up, I hear whispering.  As if
you</B>
<P><B>were walking down the halls of your school and people were talking
about</B>
<P><B>you. It sounds like it's coming from the kitchen.  I panic.  I turn
on</B>
<P><B>the bedroom light.  I then go into the small tv room and turn on that</B>
<P><B>light and see nothing.  The hair on my arms raise up.  They were the</B>
<P><B>largest goosebumps I had ever had and I then knew I had a bad
presence</B>
<P><B>with me.  I talked outloud.  I asked if it was te one that was in my</B>
<P><B>room so much.  I got nothing but silence.  I asked if this were a
prank.</B>
<P><B>Silence again.  I asked what it was.  And all the lights went out as
if</B>
<P><B>it was going to show me exactly what it was and instead, I ran out
the</B>
<P><B>basement.  I went up stairs and slept in my room that night.  I then</B>
<P><B>went into full research.  I bought every book I possibly good on the</B>
<P><B>paranormal and how to get rid of it.  I spent my daytime in the</B>
<P><B>basement, my nights were in my room.  I then started sleeping with
my</B>
<P><B>door closed.  I now know why the dogs won't go downstairs by
themselves.</B>
<P><B>I have a friend that I have known since pre-school.  We would share</B>
<P><B>ghost stories.  We both had our moments dealing with the other side.</B>
<P><B>His mother is very well endowed in the area of spirtuality.  She gave</B>
<P><B>him some ideas on how to help me out.  He brought over some incense
and</B>
<P><B>an open-mind.  He walked into my basement for the first time in his
life</B>
<P><B>and I saw the hair n his arms raise up.  He just looked at me and
told</B>
<P><B>me that he thinks that it doesn't like him very much.  I said that
he</B>
<P><B>doesn't seem to like anyone very much.  He's kind of cranky and pushy
to</B>
<P><B>me.  Just as I said that, the bedroom light exploded even though it</B>
<P><B>wasn't even on.  My friend burned the incense and the spirit left for</B>
<P><B>awhile.  He told me to burn it when it was around.  He also  told me
to</B>
<P><B>read up some more.  That he would give me some books on how to deal
with</B>
<P><B>this thing.   This spirit continued to act up.  I read and read.  I
made</B>
<P><B>a decision to change my chosen path in life.  I became full pledged</B>
<P><B>Wiccan.  I began to meditate on a regular basis.  I also began feeding
a</B>
<P><B>new talent.  I was now someho able to communicate with the spirit in
my</B>
<P><B>room.  I can only explain how I do this, like this......It's like</B>
<P><B>remembering what your best friend said to you earlier.  You see it
all</B>
<P><B>in your mind.  I don't hear voices outloud, nor do I see images.  In
my</B>
<P><B>mind, I get a picture and I know what's being said.  I talked with
the</B>
<P><B>presence that seemed to love my room.  It seemed to be a small boy.</B>
<P><B>Around the age of 9 or so.  He still apologized for taking my
necklace</B>
<P><B>that one time. I giggled at him.  And explained how it was ok.  That
I</B>
<P><B>simply lost my temper.  He then totally changed the subject.  He
wanted</B>
<P><B>to talk to me about, "the others", he said.  He told me about the men</B>
<P><B>iving next dorr to one another.  He didn't know why, but they bother
him</B>
<P><B>alot.  He said that they make fun of him often so he likes to stay
away</B>
<P><B>from them.  He also had made the mistake of going to the new place</B>
<P><B>downstairs.  He said that the old man tried to practically kill him.
 He</B>
<P><B>ran back up here.  He said that my room was the best for him.  And
that</B>
<P><B>I didn't seem to mind him there as long as he didn't play another
joke.</B>
<P><B>I told him that he is very welcome in my room, at all times.  I asked</B>
<P><B>what he was in the house for in the first place.  He told me that he</B>
<P><B>loved it here until the others came.  He used to run around all day.
 I</B>
<P><B>tried to convince him to follow the bright light, but he refused
under</B>
<P><B>all circumstances.  I had to give up on him.  I tried talking to "the</B>
<P><B>men who live across from one another", but they don't want to listen.</B>
<P><B>All I hear when I used to talk to them was, "Shhhh!".  So I gave up
on</B>
<P><B>them also.  But now was time to break out the big guns.  I went</B>
<P><B>downstairs, and Flurry tried to follow me.  I had to tell her no
several</B>
<P><B>times before she listened.  It felt like she knew I was going to do</B>
<P><B>something dumb, and she just wanted to be there to help out.  I was</B>
<P><B>honestly scared.  I hugged her.  She was my relief source.  I began
my</B>
<P><B>walk down the stairs.  I went through the door and left it open
behind</B>
<P><B>me.  I sat down in the chair in front of the tv.  From there, I
looked</B>
<P><B>to the left and saw the darkness of where I just walked from.  Even</B>
<P><B>though it was daytime, it was still very dank and dark down there.
 I</B>
<P><B>started thinking about what I was going to say to this one.  I was</B>
<P><B>holding one of my ghost books.  I began telling him how I really want
to</B>
<P><B>get along with him, but how he won't give me a chance.  All of a
sudden,</B>
<P><B>from the corner of my left eye, I saw something.  I turned my head
and</B>
<P><B>glared out the door to see a large ball of green light growing
brighter.</B>
<P><B>I was automatically stopped from speaking at that point.  I froze in</B>
<P><B>total fear.  It grew and grew until it was almost all green light
over</B>
<P><B>there.  And then it died out.  I was so scared I just walked up the</B>
<P><B>stairs and ran into the tv room up there.  It seemed that he knew
what</B>
<P><B>got to me.  All this itme of scaring me out of there, I think he knew</B>
<P><B>exactly how to shut me up and it worked perfectly.  I gave up on
talking</B>
<P><B>to him that day.  I had to reorganize everything now, I needed a new</B>
<P><B>strategy.  Night time came along and it was getting pretty late.  I
was</B>
<P><B>up in my room reading my books.  I  got hungry so I went downstairs
for</B>
<P><B>a snack.  My mom had fallen asleep in the little sewing room/playroom
we</B>
<P><B>had.  There was a small yet extremely comfortable cot in there.  I</B>
<P><B>walked down the stairs, I never turned on the lights.  I went through
to</B>
<P><B>the kitchen and begam getting a paper plate.  I heard footsteps come
up</B>
<P><B>the stairs.  I  honestly had thought that my mom was down there doing</B>
<P><B>laundry or something and came up.  I went into the fridge to get</B>
<P><B>everything.  I heard the footsteps go into the kitchen directly
behind</B>
<P><B>me.  I heard the chair pull out that was directly near the back wall.</B>
<P><B>It smacked against the wall.  I heard someone sit as if they were
very</B>
<P><B>tired.  I turned around to say something to my mom, only to see
nothing</B>
<P><B>there.  My heart jumped into my throat.  I tunred back around and</B>
<P><B>realized it was the man from downstairs.  I left everything where it
was</B>
<P><B>and quickly walked past the kitchen into the bathroom in the hall.
 I</B>
<P><B>left the light off.  After aout 3 minutes, I heard him get up, push
the</B>
<P><B>chair back in and walk towards the bathroom, stopping directly in
front</B>
<P><B>of the door.  I waited for anything.  For some odd reason, I grabbed
the</B>
<P><B>plunger, as if it could help me at that moment.  After a minute or
so,</B>
<P><B>he kept walking down the hall, went into the room where my brother
used</B>
<P><B>to be and closed the door behind him.  I ran upstairs and tried
talking</B>
<P><B>to the little boy, but he was gone now.  He never returned either.
 I</B>
<P><B>don't know whatever happened to him.  The next moring I told my mom
what</B>
<P><B>had happened.  She sid she slept downsairs because she thought she
kept</B>
<P><B>hearing footsteps.  She decided to wait and see if someone had broken</B>
<P><B>in, but no one was ever sighted.  I explained to her everything about</B>
<P><B>what I had been doing.  For the most part, I think she thought I was</B>
<P><B>crazy.  But I know that there were some things that she believed. 
I</B>
<P><B>then told her that i was going to stay at my friend's house for the</B>
<P><B>weekend to get my thoughts back.  As I got older and went through
high</B>
<P><B>school, I became an amatuer ghost hunter.  If my friend thought they
had</B>
<P><B>a ghost, I'd research and see if I could find anything.  I'd go
through</B>
<P><B>their house to see if anyting was there.  My house stayed the same.</B>
<P><B>There was a point were one of my aunts ans a cousin of mine were in
the</B>
<P><B>basement with me.  I began telling them all of this.  My aunt got
scared</B>
<P><B>and asked if the man was still there.  I said, "Yes and he's still
mean</B>
<P><B>and rude!".  I had a framed picture hanging next to the door.  It</B>
<P><B>literally blew up while none of us were even touching it.  We all ran</B>
<P><B>upstairs.  There were many times were I had a pack of cigarettes down</B>
<P><B>there, and I would lay them on the tv.  I'd turn around and they'd
be</B>
<P><B>gone.  I'd look all over, behind the tv, in other rooms and all, but
no</B>
<P><B>sign.  I would get pissed and say outloud that I would count to 10.
 I</B>
<P><B>tried that old technique.  Well it would kind of work.  Although, I</B>
<P><B>would turn around, and sometimes by the count of 7, they would fall
in</B>
<P><B>front of me or sometimes appear right were they were supposed to be.</B>
<P><B>One time, he through them at me and hit my in the head.  Now that I
live</B>
<P><B>in Florida, John, my brother tells me about how when he was in that</B>
<P><B>hallway room, that he could never go to sleep because he would hear</B>
<P><B>talking.  And he would see shadows even in the day.  He told me that</B>
<P><B>when he moved to the basement, that an older man would stare at him.
 He</B>
<P><B>would be dressed in a black suit,  He said he looked like a scary
dude.</B>
<P><B>He would peep his head in the bathroom as he was trying to use it.
 He</B>
<P><B>then decided to go out all night and not return until dawn.  It
seemed</B>
<P><B>to be better in the daytime.  Atleast I know that I'm not crazy. 
Many</B>
<P><B>friends slept over my old house and I would foget to warn them about
the</B>
<P><B>things that have gone on.  I would wake up in the morning with them</B>
<P><B>laying either right next to me cuddled up or on the ground beneath
my</B>
<P><B>feet.  Believe it or not, there were still many things that went on
in</B>
<P><B>my old house that I never wrote down here.  But this is so long
already.</B>
<P><B>I'm sure people have been falling asleep reading it.  And even now
that</B>
<P><B>I live in Florida, I've ran into a few spirirts.  None as bad as the</B>
<P><B>onein my old basement thoug.  Maybe I'll type those stories out too.</B>
<P><B>But it'll definetly be later.  Until then, if anyone would like to</B>

<H3><A NAME=next>The House Next Door</A>
</H3><P><B>by LiL Mama@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I know you mite not believe this but it's true.</B>
<P><B>      I spent the night at a friends house about two years ago. I fell
asleep on the sofa with my friends cat sleeping with me. In the middle of
the night the cat woke me up by hissing and grawling. The cat jumped of me
and left. I turned on my side to go back to sleep, thats when i saw a shadow
of a man neeling right in front of me.</B>
<P><B>he wasn't even a half-foot away from me. I could see kinda what he
looked like. I started to cry and pray. I guess I upset him or something
because the whole sofa started to shake. then he was gone.</B>
<P><B>      I found out the next day the house nextdoor to my friends house
had been abanded. They couldn't even put the house up for sale because they
couldn't find an owner to the house. So I decided to go and exsplore. The
house has a hallway around the whole top floor. There are no windows for
the rooms upstairs.</B>
<P><B>      Well thats my story. It still scares me to walk by that house.</B>

<H3><A NAME=boy>The Little Boy</A>
</H3><P><B>by BossSkiMan@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> My name is Chris Thomas and what i saw the night of February third
1997, was going to chang my life forever.  When I was in the woods (near
Peters Creek PA) playing flash-light tag with a group of friends I saw the
most horrifying thing I'll ever see.  When we (my friends and I) started
playing we did not have teams.  We all split up about 50 yards.  A few muinutes
into the game I heard a swooshing noise combined with a soft crack of twigs.
 Than I saw a little boy with his dog, walking into the woods. The figure
was made of a fine white mist. I was a little scared, because I thought it
was my imagination.  I couldn't see much from then on cuz it got dark.  But
a little later into the game  I heard a faint scream.  I went to where I
thought the sound came from, than when I got there, there was only the boy,
not the dog.  It was the same ghostly figure except, the boy was on the ground,
and it looked like the ghostly boy was mutilated!  I got out of there as
fast as I could.  Than I told my friends, but when they got there the figure
was gone! Even today I have the same dreams about that over and over again.

<P>
<P><B>Hello,</B>
<P><B>The story I am writing you did infact happen to me and I am very much
</B>
<P><B>telling the truth.</B>
<P><B>I am a 15 years old.  When I was 2 years old my family and I moved
from </B>
<P><B>our house to a house located in the north Georgia mountains.  Our house
</B>
<P><B>is not in a neighborhood, so I did not have any friends untill I started
</B>
<P><B>school, BUT I did have an imaginary pet mouse.  My pet mouse would
only </B>
<P><B>play with me in my room and it would always run to a certain place
in </B>
<P><B>my wall when anyone would enter.  I played with my pet mouse for about
3 </B>
<P><B>years before I started school then I would only see the mouse scamper
</B>
<P><B>across the floor to that certain place on my bedroom wall.  Now I have
</B>
<P><B>heard of other people having imaginary friends, but never a pet
mouse.</B>
<P><B>Durring the summer of my eighth birthday, my house was under </B>
<P><B>construction and a section of the wall where the mouse would run to
was </B>
<P><B>being taken out to add a sliding glass door to the new patio.  Well.
. . </B>
<P><B>guess what was found in the wall.  A mouse carcass in the EXACT spot
</B>
<P><B>where my "imaginary" mouse would run.  Now this never scared me and
this </B>
<P><B>may sound sick, but I kept the mouse bones in a little poutch in a
trunk </B>
<P><B>in my room.  Since the wall was taken out I haven't seen the mouse
and </B>
<P><B>this saddens me greatly because this mouse was a pet/friend of mine
for </B>
<P><B>almost all of my childhood.  I don't know if my mouse was a ghost of
an </B>
<P><B>animal, but it sure sounds like it to me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sharing>Sharing the House</A>
</H3><P><B>by mack@gmi.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1987 I was a student at a small junior college in Matheston , My
Being</B>
<P><B>a divorced mom of 6 children I was glad to find a house to rent that
was</B>
<P><B>cheap.I wasn't told that we had to share the home with ghost..The house
was</B>
<P><B>built before the cival war by slave labor..It had 7 rooms and a bath
in</B>
<P><B>it..Two of the rooms were locked and we were told not to open
them..My</B>
<P><B>daughter was 16 at the time and curisioty got the best of her..While
I was</B>
<P><B>at school one day she opened one of the rooms.There wasn't anything</B>
<P><B>spectacular in the room..It was small and had only a half bed and a
rocker</B>
<P><B>in it..We thought nothing of her opening it and wondered why the owner
was</B>
<P><B>so funny about that room especially since we needed the extra
bedroom.But</B>
<P><B>things started to happen..At first it was just a feeling of being watched
,</B>
<P><B>then we would hear noises like something or someone scratching on the</B>
<P><B>walls, finally it got so bad that we were all sleeping in the same
room.One</B>
<P><B>night I had all I could take and sent all of the kids to their rooms
to</B>
<P><B>sleep.It was storming and easy to go to sleep with the rain hitting
the tin</B>
<P><B>roof.I awoke to the piano playing. I looked at the clock at the side
of my</B>
<P><B>bed and it was 3 in the morning..None of my kids played so I went into
the</B>
<P><B>hall to see what was happening.As I got to the door my 2 boy let out
a yelp</B>
<P><B>and came running into the hall.Both were bleeding from what looked
like a</B>
<P><B>pin prick on their backside.Needless to say that was the last straw.We
left</B>
<P><B>there that night and stayed in the car for the rest of the night.The
next</B>
<P><B>day we found a trailer for rent and moved.I found out later that
several</B>
<P><B>people from the school had rented that house at one time or another
but</B>
<P><B>none ever stayed long..What is in that house? I don't know but I
haven't</B>
<P><B>been back there.</B>

<H3><A NAME=worst>My Worst Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by sapphire07@sprynet.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>"2 Close Encounters with the Most Terrifying Kind".....I have been</B>
<P><B>reading your homepages personal experiences &amp; other's experiences
as</B>
<P><B>well.  Only few know of my "Worst" encounters with a very BAD entity.
 I</B>
<P><B>have had some in my past when growing up, but none that have
litterally</B>
<P><B>scared the you know what out of me so bad that I packed on two
different</B>
<P><B>occasions..on one night, nightclothes on, barefoot &amp; pregnant</B>
<P><B>(Litterally) &amp; the other twins, in night clothes &amp; my bible
in my</B>
<P><B>hand..both times leaving EVERYTHING I owned behind.  Fortunately, I
had</B>
<P><B>some friends that were "Game" for a good "Ghost Hunt" with the first</B>
<P><B>experience &amp; fortunately they packed up my belongings &amp; delivered
them</B>
<P><B>back to me the next day..&amp; with the second one, my current husband
&amp; his</B>
<P><B>dad packed everything up the next day &amp; we moved to my
father-in-law's</B>
<P><B>home for a while.  Well, now for my FIRST closest encounter of the</B>
<P><B>terrifying kind...I was 15 years old, married &amp; pregnant at the
time.  I</B>
<P><B>had just moved into a small white framed house.  My landlord was my</B>
<P><B>dad's co-worker/friend who just happened to live next door oddly</B>
<P><B>enough.  At first, I thought something was wrong with my stove. </B>
<P><B>Everytime I would make chicken it would turn out looking very yellow.
 I</B>
<P><B>have been cooking since I was 4 for a family of 5 so I knew it wasn't
my</B>
<P><B>cooking!  One day, upon making fried chicken again, it came out very</B>
<P><B>yellow, so I decided to put it in the oven for a while to finish
cooking</B>
<P><B>it.  When I removed it from the oven, it wasn't yellow anymore, but</B>
<P><B>GREEN this time!!!  Naturally, I thought it HAD to be the stove.  So
I</B>
<P><B>threw it out &amp; we ate out.  When we got back home, we watched
some</B>
<P><B>television before going to bed.  Everynight, actually in the early</B>
<P><B>morning, I would be awoken by a chill or freezing breeze...only to
find</B>
<P><B>all 4 windows in our room wide open.  I would awake my (Husband at
the</B>
<P><B>time) &amp; ask him if he opened the windows.  He always said "no".
 So, not</B>
<P><B>fully convinced that he didn't have anything to do with it, I stayed</B>
<P><B>awake all night, but still lying in bed.  When suddenly, the windows</B>
<P><B>flew open one at a time.  I was so scared by this time, that I decided
I</B>
<P><B>was going to sleep in the living room.  So, I convinced him to come
with</B>
<P><B>me &amp; we closed our bedroom door.  Several "Suicidal" thoughts
raced</B>
<P><B>through my head for some reason at this time.  One terrifying night
we</B>
<P><B>were in the living room watching t.v. &amp; I remember this night so
well,</B>
<P><B>because I was three months pregnant when I felt the twins kick me at
the</B>
<P><B>same time.  Anyway, I started crying &amp; shaking uncontrollably then
we</B>
<P><B>both heard a loud BANG!  It was the windows being tossed up forcably
all</B>
<P><B>at the same time.  There was a very good breeze blowing the curtains</B>
<P><B>like a flag on a pole in a wind storm.  In my nursery, I had a rabbit</B>
<P><B>that had purple ears &amp; red eyes.  It never bothered me before.
 But when</B>
<P><B>we got up to go to the room to see what had happened...I was
litterally</B>
<P><B>crawling on the carpet because I could feel a very bad "presence" the</B>
<P><B>closer I got to the nursery.  Still srying, shaking, &amp; crawling,
I</B>
<P><B>entered the room on all fours.  I was terrified at what I saw.  The
baby</B>
<P><B>swing started swinging by itself &amp; in it was my rabbit...eyes all</B>
<P><B>aglow.  Swing kept going faster &amp; faster &amp; I couldn't move.
 Not even to</B>
<P><B>blink.  I felt something very very bad in that house &amp; when my
husband</B>
<P><B>came in there to check on me, (He was too </B>
<P><B>chicken to make the first move) he too was an all fours &amp; shaking</B>
<P><B>uncontrollably.  When we both were finally able to move, we trampoled</B>
<P><B>all over eachother trying to get out of that room.  We both ran
outside</B>
<P><B>as fast as we could.  He pulled the car around &amp; we immediately
went to</B>
<P><B>our preacher's home to get help.  Our preacher came &amp; "Cleansed"
our</B>
<P><B>house, but it would take an army of men before they were getting me
back</B>
<P><B>into that house...NO WAY!!!  When we had moved, Diane (a friend of
mine)</B>
<P><B>had told me that the reason she let my cat go hugry for a few days
while</B>
<P><B>I was out of town was because something terrified her as well &amp;
it took</B>
<P><B>a while before she would tell me all about it.  Last she knew, when
she</B>
<P><B>ran out of the house...vowing to never enter it again...she had left
my</B>
<P><B>kitten inside.  When I got home, my kitten was in the garage, but the</B>
<P><B>kitty messes were in the house...garage was completely clean &amp;
she had</B>
<P><B>been in there for at least 2 days since Diane had left the house.
 Since</B>
<P><B>then, I have never set one foot in that house again...&amp; it still
remains</B>
<P><B>vacant.  I have had several "Encounters" before &amp; since then, but
none</B>
<P><B>as horribly terrifying as this &amp; the next one I am about to tell
you all</B>
<P><B>about. </B>
<P>
<P><B> My husband &amp; I had two of his friends living with us for rent</B>
<P><B>purposes.  We lived in a townhome (two-stories) Douglas our "Good"</B>
<P><B>friend had brought this stuffed monkey with him.  I hated that thing,
of</B>
<P><B>course I have always hated anything that looked "Scary" since I was
a</B>
<P><B>child...especially "DOLLS" for some reason.  Anyway, Douglas put the</B>
<P><B>monkey upstairs in his room &amp; when I came downstairs..there it
was</B>
<P><B>sitting on top of the stereo.  Everywhere I turned, it was there!
 This</B>
<P><B>was the first signs of something paranormal.  Second, I was asleep
one</B>
<P><B>night &amp; heard Douglas shouting for me to go back to bed.  So,
naturally</B>
<P><B>I got up &amp; when I opened the door, he was silent &amp; white as
a "Ghost". </B>
<P><B>He told me the next morning that he saw me come out of my room, look</B>
<P><B>straight at him &amp; turn to go down the stairs when he shouted...just
then</B>
<P><B>when I opened the door for real this time...the Ghostly figure of
what</B>
<P><B>he thought was ME, disappeared.  Scared us both!  The next afternoon</B>
<P><B>when I was thinking about what had happened &amp; when I decided to
shrug it</B>
<P><B>off as him having a bad dream...it was at that moment that I flipped
on</B>
<P><B>the hall light &amp; it glowed a bright purple color for a few seconds
&amp;</B>
<P><B>then went out completely.  Well, when my husband got home, I told him
of</B>
<P><B>the paranormal things that had been happening &amp; he didn't believe
either</B>
<P><B>of us because it never happened when he was around &amp; our other
roommate</B>
<P><B>Steve was never around.  My husband believed me after one dreadful
night</B>
<P><B>of shear terror that sent us a packing instantly.  I was in the
Kitchen</B>
<P><B>cleaning up the dishes &amp; Douglas was helping me clean up the rest
of the</B>
<P><B>Kitchen.  When suddenly we both got a very sick feeling...only to
open</B>
<P><B>the laundry room door &amp; find gas from Steve's motorcycle tank
spilled</B>
<P><B>all over the floor. (He was told NOT to work on it in the house, but
he</B>
<P><B>never listens)  So, I went to grab a mop only a few feet away, but
when</B>
<P><B>I went to open the door again, it was locked from the inside.  You</B>
<P><B>see...you had to go through the laundry room to get to the back
kitchen</B>
<P><B>door...that's why iit had a lock on it for those of you wondering how
it</B>
<P><B>could be locked from the inside.  I couldn't get either door open
&amp;</B>
<P><B>became very ill in the time that I was trying to pry the door open.
 I</B>
<P><B>was rushed to the emergency room &amp; was given lots of oxygen to
filter</B>
<P><B>out the gas fumes from my lungs.  When my husband took me back home,
he</B>
<P><B>asked what had happened because even though Douglas &amp; I could smell
the</B>
<P><B>fumes from the gas spill, he could not.  So, I told him &amp; low &amp;
behold</B>
<P><B>when he went to the laundry room to check it out, the door opened</B>
<P><B>without any problem.  Wasn't locked either, so once again because it</B>
<P><B>never happened to him, he didn't believe us at that time...</B>
<P><B>What happened next is where you had better hold on to your hats.  My</B>
<P><B>husband decided that there must be "something" going on...reverting
back</B>
<P><B>to his own teenage years with his own encounter with evil.  He</B>
<P><B>remembered that our now "X" friend Steve had said that he used to be</B>
<P><B>tied up with that Roll Playing "Game" called "Dungeons &amp; Dragons".
 Let</B>
<P><B>me tell you something...that is very very evil &amp; it pulls you into
it</B>
<P><B>without you even knowing "he's" got you til it's too late.  Anyway,</B>
<P><B>thinking that it possibly has something to do with Steve &amp; this</B>
<P><B>"Game"...he tears Steve's room apart looking for the "Game".  He found
2</B>
<P><B>dice to the it he decided to use gasoline to burn them.  One die was</B>
<P><B>wood &amp; the other plastic...so you would think that they would
burn</B>
<P><B>easily right? Wrong!!!  Douglas was looking out the bay window in the</B>
<P><B>Dining room while sitting in one of the twins little chairs.  The
smoke</B>
<P><B>from the gasoline turned blue &amp; when my husband went upstairs to
search</B>
<P><B>for more pieces, we knew exactly what area of the room he was in,</B>
<P><B>because the smoke would turn...like it was pointing in the direction</B>
<P><B>that we would hear him walking to.  I noticed at one point that
Douglas</B>
<P><B>could go longer than I had ever seen anyone go before without blinking.
</B>
<P><B>I could see the fire in the pan of gasoline &amp; heard a loud sizzling
&amp;</B>
<P><B>screeching noise coming from the pan.  I turned to look back at
Douglas</B>
<P><B>in the girls chair when suddenly he was thrown hard to the floor. 
I</B>
<P><B>mean the chair tipped back &amp; his feet remained level as if they
were</B>
<P><B>planted firmly on the floor...but they were not.  He hit his head
hard</B>
<P><B>on the tile &amp; still he never blinked or moved at all.  Looked like
he</B>
<P><B>was pinned in that same manner that he was once sitting straight up
in.</B>
<P><B>I was concerned yet very terrified at what I had just wittnessed</B>
<P><B>happening to him.  I screamed for my husband &amp; he came running
down the</B>
<P><B>stairs only to see what I saw.  Then he went over to Douglas &amp;
tried to</B>
<P><B>"Snap him out of it" by shaking him repeatedly.  When Douglas snapped</B>
<P><B>out of it, he told us that he heard a voice say "You are MINE &amp;
you</B>
<P><B>always will be" then he felt "Something" punch him in the chest &amp;
knock</B>
<P><B>him over..not being able to do anything about it.  He couldn't</B>
<P><B>move...whateer it was had him!  Meanwhile, dice are still NOT melting
or</B>
<P><B>burning or for that matter ANYTHING.  Then one die got that very LOUD</B>
<P><B>Screeching sound again...the wooden one I suppose because then
suddenly</B>
<P><B>it plit evenly in half &amp; part of it popped out of the fire &amp;
into the</B>
<P><B>grass.  I looked everywhere for it, but couldn't find it.  Just then
I</B>
<P><B>got an eerie feeling that something was coming after me.  I grabbed
up</B>
<P><B>both of the girls..age 1 &amp; a half at this time..&amp; ran as fast
as I could</B>
<P><B>to the car with both of them &amp; my Bible in my hands.  Amazing what
all</B>
<P><B>you can do when that adreneline gets to flowing!  I sat there in the</B>
<P><B>car, still feeling that it was "Coming after us"...honking the horn</B>
<P><B>frantically now for my husband &amp; Douglas.  They were both screaming
open</B>
<P><B>the door as they were racing for the car.  We piled in the car &amp;
drove</B>
<P><B>off tires squealing &amp; all.  I never went back...but still wonder
what</B>
<P><B>happened to the half-split die that is on the ground somewhere.</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Own Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by Mercury832@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My family moves around quite a bit and when I was eight years old we
moved into a house in huntington beach ,California.I hadn't like this house
from the begining because it was very small,and cheaply made,it was in a
neighborhood which was right behind an alley to a local K-mart,it wasn't
a "bad" neighborhood,just on the shabby side.I don't remember much from it
but My mother said when we first moved in she was surprised to see I would
refuse to sleep in my own room,I had been quite and independant child till
then,and I could not sleep unless it was by myself.When my mother inquired
into as why I wouldn't I said I was scared which may seem perfectly normal
that a child would be scared but I was a very brave child . So my mother
gave in and I slept in her bed with her         Now everything was fine for
a couple of months but then my brother started waking up in the middle of
the night drenched in sweat and screaming about the terrible nightmares he
was having.And my father to suddenly space out,meaning he would all of a
sudden faint or fall asleep just out of no where.it got worse  when My mother
said I had to start sleeping in my own bed ,every night I would see a large
man rumaging furiouslyu thruoght my closet and he had a small kitchen knife
in his hand I would scream then my mother would come in and calm me down,one
night she just got fed up and tried to show me there weren't any "monsters"
in my closet when she reached for the knob to open my closet door she cried
out suddenly and started running to our bathroom she later told me,when I
was older and wouldn't be frightened,that the doorknob was red hot and she
had burned her hand on it.after that something very strange happend,every
night,at a very late hour,my alarm clock would go off I'd wake up screaming
then too, my parents couldn't figure out why though,becuase every
&lt;I&gt;morning&lt;/I&gt; at it's scheduled time at 7:00 it would go off
too.they eventually just took it out of my room and when they did,it stopped
going off. We also started noticing lots of dead animal carcasses would be
in our backyard,there would be a lot of dead birds,possums,and even rats,though
no one reported rats in their homes.My mother would always say she saw an
old woman snooping around in our back yard she said she saw  her looking
through our garbage and tapping on our windows,my father would just say her
mind was playing tricks on her and giving her a suspect for the dead animals,this
went on for a while.then I began not sleeping at all.I would just walking
around our house at night and not sleeping a wink,my mother says I must have
been sleep walking because I'd have to get at least some sleep because she
never saw me sleep in the day,but I could remember walking around all night
and being wide awake,we finally moved from the house because my father got
an offer for a larger house more near the ocean.but my mtoher and I still
think something was weird about that house.thank you for your time</B>

<H3><A NAME=voices>Night Voices </A>
</H3><P><B>by mfjensen@inreach.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1995, my friend Dawn and I both moved into a place in the Oakland
hills</B>
<P><B>that happened to have been a casualty of the Great Fire</B>
<P><B>Storm in the Berkeley/Oakland hills of 1991. Now, we know that there</B>
<P><B>were no definative reports of deaths in the fire, but rumours of
course,</B>
<P><B>fly about and when you're in the midst of an event like this, you can
say</B>
<P><B>that time may have put its' stamp on this region of Northern California.
</B>
<P><B>The two of us used to crash in the loft of Dawns room which happened
to be</B>
<P><B>a part of this house severely damaged by the fire. As we would settle
in,</B>
<P><B>the normal sounds of a house still settling from recent construction
work</B>
<P><B>would envelope our little spot. That wasn't the unnerving bit...just
as we</B>
<P><B>would stop talking, you could begin to destinctly hear the sound of
voices.</B>
<P><B>Now, you may be skeptical and say that we must have been hearing the
sounds</B>
<P><B>of our neighboors or traffic on the hill...NOT! The house was still</B>
<P><B>surrounded by many vacant lots up for sale and there is little if any
late</B>
<P><B>night traffic in that area. </B>
<P><B>The sounds of the voices would begin as tho people were shouting</B>
<P><B>instructions, then sobbing, lots of cries of either fear or pain and
plenty</B>
<P><B>of miscellaneous babble. At first, we refused to tell one another of
the</B>
<P><B>voices thinking induvidually we were losin' it. But one night a group
of</B>
<P><B>our friends were sitting about in the living room of our house and
the</B>
<P><B>paranormal became a topic. Well, Dawn finally could not contain her</B>
<P><B>experiences any longer. I then felt a wee bit better, but then more
so</B>
<P><B>unnerved. So, I added my two cents and a couple other folks who have</B>
<P><B>gathered in the loft at various times also contributed their stories.
</B>
<P><B>We've kept this to ourselves for  sometime now because we can't
really</B>
<P><B>confirm what the voices were from or their origin. They could really
be</B>
<P><B>heard when it was around dusk until just about three or four am and
then</B>
<P><B>nothing until the following evening. I have the theory that we had
some</B>
<P><B>sort of time spot that reflected a period in time that caused great</B>
<P><B>destruction,sorrow, pain and little else. Dawn is open to that but
also</B>
<P><B>feels that we could have been listening to the cries of people who
some how</B>
<P><B>got lost in the fires and died unnoticed. In this area, it wouldn't
be</B>
<P><B>unheard of. We used to get alot of homeless people that would migrate
into</B>
<P><B>the hills when the lower regions would get hot in summer until late</B>
<P><B>autumn.So  you can imagine how many homeless folks sleeping in the
cool of</B>
<P><B>the trees could have gotten caught up in the mele' and scince their
status</B>
<P><B>was that of a less than favourable citizen in the eyes of all "good
people"</B>
<P><B>with the money to live in the hills, their deaths can expectedly go</B>
<P><B>unnoticed.</B>
<P><B>We don't claim to have the answers, we don't expect folks to believe
us,</B>
<P><B>but we do know that this did happen to us and we can both ,along with
some</B>
<P><B>other folks, attest to these events being real and true. We never asked
any</B>
<P><B>of the very few neighboors we had because we just didn't feel like
bringing</B>
<P><B>this to their attention due to the fact these people thought with money
and</B>
<P><B>not what was deep within. We appreciate the chance to finally share
this</B>
<P><B>with some one who can at least give it a go over and make their own</B>
<P><B>conclusion with out being skeptical from the git go.</B>
<P><B>THANKS LOTS!</B>

<P>
<P><B>My mom, who lives in Plattsmouth, Nebraska moved into her current
house</B>
<P><B>in 1990.  It was built sometime in the 1980's so it is not that old.
</B>
<P><B>Well, I moved in with her in 1991 to go to school and when they were</B>
<P><B>building an extra room for me all sorts of weird things went on. I
never</B>
<P><B>did like to walk anywhere in that house without a light on.  Too
creepy</B>
<P><B>of a feeling.  Anyway, things have been seen in that house and stuff
has</B>
<P><B>gone on in that house that defy explanation.  I was sitting
downstairs</B>
<P><B>one afternoon playing Nintendo and heard someone walk down the hall
into</B>
<P><B>the kitchen and pull dishes out of the cupboards.  I thought it was
my</B>
<P><B>little brother home from school so I yelled for him to come
downstairs.</B>
<P><B>I got no answer and then heard the footsteps go back down the hall
and</B>
<P><B>it got quiet again.  About 10 minutes later - same thing.  I decided
I</B>
<P><B>wasn't going back upstairs until someone (ANYONE) came home!  My mom
has</B>
<P><B>been in her bed and woken up in the middle of the night to see
someone</B>
<P><B>bent over in the waist looking at her.  Then when she focuses he</B>
<P><B>disappears!  Too many things to describe have gone on in that house
and</B>
<P><B>I am just curious to find out why.  Where can she go to see if
anything</B>
<P><B>has happened on that property or what her house is built over?  I
don't</B>
<P><B>think a cemetary but it's hard to say.  I guess it could be something</B>
<P><B>not even documented.  For about the last year or so everything has
been</B>
<P><B>quiet but I still would like to know.  Especially since I believe
there</B>
<P><B>might be 2 spirits there. One definitely NOT GOOD and one that likes
to</B>
<P><B>play.  If anyone has any ideas - please - E-mail me back.  Thanks.</B>
