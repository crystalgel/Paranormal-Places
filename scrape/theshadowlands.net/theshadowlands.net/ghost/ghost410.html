Ghost Related?<br>
<br>
By: adambculliton@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hi, my name is Adam. I am not sure if this is ghost related or not, so
I will just tell you a few of my stories. Every so often when I am
watching tv in my room, my tv turns itself off. This happens when I am
watching shows or movies that my mom does not like or approve of. When
I am watching tv in my room, I almost always keep a heating pad on my
bad shoulder which keeps my body warm. Right before the tv goes off, I
get this uncontrollable chill (which I am also feeling as I write this)
down my body, then the tv turns off. The first few times this happened,
I thought that I had turned on the sleep mode, but I did not because
when the sleep mode is on, it starts a count down at the bottom of my
screen with 60 seconds to go, and there was no count down. Some times
when this happens, I turn the tv back on, and then about 20-30 min.
later, the tv goes back off, and for the entire 20-30 min. <br>
that it is on, I feel the same chills. The next morning when I wake up,
I see some kind of bloody and dismembered body standing in front of my
bed just glaring at me for a few seconds before it disappears. Also
some times when I am home alone with my dog, she starts flipping out
and wont stop until I take her out side and she walks around all of our
property. Occasionally, when I am in my basement playing video games,
or pool, I hear some one calling my name, but I am normally home alone,
or no one had called my name. <br>
My dog normally starts her barking right after I hear my name being called. <br>
Every now and then, when I lose my temper, it is worse then normal. My
friends and I call it my dark side coming out, but when it happens, all
Hell brakes loose. First, I get the same cold chill, then my eyes
(which are<br>
blue) turn into a sliverish/grayish color. I become stronger, louder, I
talk faster, and I destroy just about every thing around me. One time,
about 3 years ago, I was at a high school foot ball game. Some how, I
got into a fight with 6 of the high school "thugs". The one kid punched
me in the eye, and thats when I felt the chill, and i started to
"change". I became much stronger, and for the most part, I destroyed
the kids i was fighting. I heard that one kid that I threw into a wall
got a conclusion from his head snaping back. Another kid got a broken
nose. Finally, one kid that hit me in the face broke his hand on my
cheek. A good friend of mine then dragged me to his house (he lived
right next to the field) and I started flipping the picnic table that
was in his back yard. I took my rage out on the table for about 30 min
until I felt the chill again, and I became exhausted, pale, and my body
felt the same way you leg feels when it falls asleep. Since then, my
"dark side" has never been as destructive, but it still happens from
time to time. Like I said, I am not sure if this is ghost related or
not, so if you can, could you please get back to me and let me know, or
let me know if you want to hear more of my stories. Thanks.<br>

Lewis and Clark Monument<br>
<br>
By: sxybtch182004@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I am writing to inform you that yes I believe that this monument is
haunted. It is haunted by what seems to me as two spirits one of an old
man walking down by there appearing to be coming from the house to the
right of the monument who comes up to you and asks your name and asks
what you are doing on his property it is said that at one time the
whole area was owned by the man who use to own the White house to the
right I haven't experienced this one for myself but i have experienced
while standing over by the monument at night you will hear someone
screaming what sounds like help me when you go over to the monument and
look over the edge you will see people below but they dont stay very
long it is said that some kids went down there and raped and beat a
young girl and then left her there to die. At one point of going up
there because that is one of my favorite places in Council Bluffs to go
to because it is next to the cemetary and Black Angel two of the most
popular hauntings in Council Bluffs, I have been looking out over the
monument and have seen a young bloody woman trying to get out and have
heard her voice saying no stop and help me. All around i believe that
the whole area has hauntings even washington elementary off of broadway
next to what use to be the old at&amp;t building to as far as the white
house below the monument around the half curve next to the white house
mentioned at the beginning of this email in which i have personally
lived in the whole area there is interesting it is said that alot of
them is haunted due to the history and that is located next to the
Fairview Cemetary. I like to experiene the paranormal and so i have
been to these places because it is my home town.<br>

My First Encounter<br>
<br>
By: ghoster@hot.rr.com<br>
<br>
The incident took place in Austin, Texas on August 14, 1995 between
11:30pm and Midnight. A friend of mine who I shall call James had been
going thru some bad times of late. He had been suffering from partial
paralysis from an injury he had sustained years ago in a diving
accident. His business was failing, his bank account was dwindling and
since he had lost his lease with the apartment he lived in, he had to
live with a friend until he could get back on his feet. As sometimes
happens in all of us, James lost hope and felt that there was no way
out and so, committed suicide. I was told about this the next day by a
mutual friend of ours. A bunch of us got together later to remember him
&amp; grieve. <br>
Two nights later, while at a payphone at the corner of S. Lamar and
Barton Skyway (a well lit street corner) talking to a lady friend, I
caught a glimpse of something moving out of the corner of my right eye.
I looked to my right across the street and saw James! He was walking
without any sign of paralysis at all! He looked completely solid. As he
walked he looked at me, smiled, nodded, and then disappeared! Oddly
enough, I was not frightened by the experience, but I sure was
surprised. I went and told another mutual friend of ours of my
encounter and he told me that he had heard that James' Sister In Law
had also seen him. According to her report, she was making some
sandwiches in the kitchen of the house she shared with her husband,
Drew (James' brother), when she felt a chill, followed by the feeling
that she was being watched. When she turned around, James was standing
in the doorway of the kitchen a few feet away from her. He spoke to her
saying, "I'm okay. Everything&#8217;s alright. Where's Drew?" She screamed
and he disappeared. She and I are the only ones who saw him. Two days
later, James was taken to Dallas and laid to rest there. As far as I
know, his ghost has not been seen since. <br>

My Mother Comes Home&nbsp; A True Story<br>
<br>
By: dataguru@bigfoot.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My mother recently passed away in her home in San Antonio, TX.&nbsp;
She passed away like any of us would want to go, she simply went to
sleep and never work up.<br>
Upon hearing the bad news, my family and I immediately flew to my
mother&#8217;s home to start tying up loose ends.&nbsp; My sister and I, the
only two heirs, divided up all my mother&#8217;s property and made
arrangements for my mother&#8217;s house.&nbsp; My sister kept my mother&#8217;s
collectibles and I took possession of my mother&#8217;s prized paintings.<br>
These two paintings were very large hand painted paintings that were
commissioned by my mother decades earlier; one painting was of our
large colonial childhood house, the other was of my parents family
business of which they had owned together over 20 years.&nbsp; My
mother was very proud of both.&nbsp; Since these paintings were so
large, we knew we could not fly back with them so we decided to have
them ground shipped to our home in Georgia.<br>
After making arrangements for all my mother&#8217;s possessions and saying
our good byes at my mother&#8217;s funeral, my family and I returned
home.&nbsp; A few days after we returned home, the shipped paintings
arrived.&nbsp; I did not feel like unpacking the paintings so they
stayed in the box temporarily.<br>
That night, my wife and I were woken up by a single phone ring at 1:30
in the morning.&nbsp; For no reason at all, my wife says, &#8220;That was
your mother&#8221;.&nbsp; I explained to her that it was simply a wrong
number and the caller had hung up.&nbsp; The next night, an alarm clock
in the living room, which was only used to keep time, went off at 1:30
in the morning.&nbsp; I had to get up out of bed and physically turn
off the alarm.&nbsp; My wife and I both knew we never used the alarm
feature of that clock.&nbsp; The next day I checked the clocking
programming and saw that the alarm, (had it been turned on) was
programmed to go off at 2:30 in the afternoon!<br>
I decided to call my sister and let her know what was going on in my
home since those paintings had arrived.&nbsp; My sister had stayed in
my mother&#8217;s house when she was in San Antonio making my mothers burial
arrangements, and she said that she too had the strangest urge to wake
at 1:30 in the morning.<br>
That night, I woke at 1:30 in the morning again, for no reason; my wife
woke up a few minutes later.&nbsp; We were awake a few minutes and I
did not hear anything so I immediately went back to sleep, my wife was
awake a little longer since it takes her longer to get back to sleep
once she is awake.&nbsp; My wife said that after I went back to sleep
she heard someone walking across the kitchen floor and opening the
refrigerator.&nbsp; She said that it was a very unique stride; it was
my mother&#8217;s stride.&nbsp; When my mother was alive, she had a very
distinctive walk because my mother had lost part of her foot due to
diabetes.&nbsp; She had tried to wake me up but I am a very sound
sleeper.<br>
That day was Saturday, so we finally got a chance to unpack and hang my
mother&#8217;s paintings.&nbsp; Once we hung those paintings we no longer had
any more nightly incidents.<br>
I cannot help but wonder what time my mother had passed away but I have a pretty good guess.<br>

My Friends Story<br>
<br>
By: mr.rodi@casema.nl<br>
<br>
Last summer me and my friends were at a small lake in Swish, I forgot
the name of the lake but well we were fooling around as I all of a
sudden tripped over something in the water, My feet was bleeding I must
have cuted myself with somthing I looked down in the water and I was
sure to see two eyes as big as footballs staring at me it was something
black and it blinked a few times then disapeard I was also sure it had
a big beak that he had opened and probaly I cutted my feet at one of
his teeth, but it scared me so much that I didn't wanted to go back in
there. Also my friends refused to go in then we sat down and waited we
bandaged my foot as my best friend started to yell there was some kind
of wisker or somthing above the surface but then when she screamed it
quikly disapeard. I wonder what it could have been, it sure scared me!<br>

A Personal Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: themindlesstripodexperience@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello, my name is Jay and I have a very real and terrifying paranormal
encounter that I would like to submit to you. It's taken awhile for me
to actually start accepting and telling my ghost story. When I was
eight years old my family moved into an oppulent ranch style home on
Biscayne Avenue in South Daytona, Florida. The house never felt right
from the get go, it was always cold even when we had the heater running
in the winter. I always felt like I was being watched at night in the
house and the feeling never went away as long as I lived in the house.
I started noticing strange occurences in the residence that my family
could not explain. My bedroom door would open by itself when shut or
shut when it was open. Lights would flicker on and off and there were
places of intense, bone chilling cold. The worst part of the house was
the back bedroom. We never went in there, it was the center of an
intense cold and it had one of the worst smells I've ver smelled, no
matter how many times we tried to get rid of the smell it just kept
coming back. At first these occurences were just easy to disregard but
then one night it got personal. I was alone watching television when I
heard loud footsteps coming from the hallway. When I went out to check
there was no one there.<br>
I walkied back to my bedroom and as I was walking I suddenly was
overcome by a bone numbing cold and the foul smell I had only smelled
in the back bedroom was permeating the air. I was just about to go into
my room when I heard a deep voice yell my name. I turned around and
walked a little bit into the hallway when I saw a huge black floating
mass. It was solid, I couldn't see through it at all. I heard the voice
yell my name one more time and then it started coming towards me. I
flew into my bedroom, locked my door and didn't come back out for
hours. I never stayed alone in the house ever again and I was happy
when I left. I don't know exactly what I experienced but I do know it
was not a freindly presence. <br>

"Casey"<br>
<br>
By: Wayne.DavisJr@valero.com <br>
<br>
&nbsp;When I was 13 years old my Dad came home and told my brother and
my self that we were moving two blocks down on the same street. We were
excited for we were going to finally own a home. My dad was so excited
to purchase the home for only $10,000. It was a small home yet two bed
rooms is all we really needed. Dad took us to see the home that day and
that is when the night mare began. When we pulled in to the drive way
the couple that lived there were packing their vehicle with what they
could fit and were leaving in a hurry. The couple was renting the place
and was there for only six months. The lady, while holding their two
year old baby was crying and warning us that the house was evil. As
kids we had no choice but to be scared. Our father instructed us to
ignore the couple for they were on drugs. I remember thinking to my
self how nice the family looked for being on drugs and I found it
really hard to believe. <br>
&nbsp;Well we moved in that week and the nightmare began to unfold.
every one seemed to be on edge and every one began to change as a
person. Dad and our step Mom through my brother out and it seemed as
every day that passed made for a more evil step mother. For a long
period of time I was forced to stay in my room and when I say forced I
mean that I was pad locked in my room. Well another summer had passed
and it was back to school. We all seemed to just ignore the foot steps
that were so close to all of us as we watched TV in the living room and
the unexplained dead animals in the yard were ok with us as well.<br>
&nbsp;To make a long story short. As I set in my room preparing for bed
I heard a noise in my closet. The noise was that of a person digging
through my belongings. I opened the closet door to find no one there
yet all of my clothes were off the hangers and my personal stuff was
knocked off the top shelf. I ran out of the room and told my Dad. My
dad grew angry and told me to just ignore it and go to sleep. I lied in
bed that night as the noise came back. At around 1:00 am I ran out of
my room and climbed on the couch. Then it sounded as though a tornado
was striking only my room. The noise was so loud that my Dad came out
of his room and just stared at my door. He then asked me, what in the
hell is going on? I expressed with fear the fact that I did not know.
My dad then told me not to be scared and just go to sleep. He said un
sure of him self; it will all be OK in the morning. <br>
&nbsp;The next morning I got up for school and as I walked in to my
room it was the most creepiest feeling I had ever felt. Nothing was in
place and every thing was knocked over. As I began to clean up I
noticed that a Frisbee that my grandmother had purchased for me right
before she died was knocked off the wall and was lying in the middle of
the floor. When I picked it up I noticed a faint writing on the inside
of it that was not normal ink. A very faint writing stated "Casey was
here! My marks are left on the top bunk" I immediately looked at the
top bunk where it looked as though some one beat it with an axe. I
showed my Dad and he grew angry and demanded that I just kept it to my
self. I never slept in that room again and at the age of 15 I moved
out. Not to long after that my dad divorced his wife and neither of
them fought for the house. The house was eventually bought for what was
owed in taxes and the house was destroyed. <br>
&nbsp;I have no idea who this Casey was yet I do know that this person
was not happy. I became a believer in ghost after that house did what
it did to my family. Every time I speak of that house and that night my
Dad just says to drop it. I am thirty years old now with three children
of my own and luckily my wife and I purchased a home with a great
history and nothing to fear.<br>

Crank Call<br>
<br>
<br>
By: awol@cogeco.net <br>
<br>
<br>
I have had many paranormal experiences starting back when I was a very
small child and some of them were quite frightening, but nothing can
quite compare to the incident that happened to me about 5 years ago one
beautiful sunny&nbsp; morning in August.<br>
My husband and I lived in a small apartment that seemed to have huge
climate variances.&nbsp; Our bedroom was always boiling hot and the
living room was always very cool.&nbsp; One night after trying to sleep
in our bedroom and feeling like we were going to melt due to the heat
wave that our city was experiencing, we decided to sleep in the living
room.&nbsp; As soon as we entered the living room, it was like a nice
cool breeze was blowing over our skin and we both settled down for
sleep.&nbsp; That night I had one of the most horrible nightmares I
have ever experienced.&nbsp; It was so vivid and seemed so real that I
can still remember it to this day.&nbsp; In this dream, there were for
a lack of a better word, demons that were harassing and scaring
me.&nbsp; They leered at me and laughed in my face, but I was unable to
move as they told me what they were going to do to me and my
family.&nbsp; They started to throw me around and rip at my flesh as I
screamed in terror.&nbsp; I was begging for help and crying in panic
when the phone rang and woke me from the dream instantly.&nbsp; I
jumped up and popped over my husband and grabbed the phone like I was
some sort of acrobat.&nbsp; When I put the receiver to my ear, I could
hear this terrible growling and for some reason, it just caused me to
become hysterical!!&nbsp; I started crying and screaming into the
receiver "What do you want?, Leave me alone!!"&nbsp; By this time, my
husband was wide awake and staring at me like I was a lunatic.&nbsp; I
never thought to hang the phone up and my husband who is very
protective never took the phone from me.&nbsp; After about 2 minutes,
the phone went dead and I put the phone down and looked at my husband
who was still staring at me.&nbsp; I told him that someone just crank
called me, but I did not tell him anything else as I felt like I should
not talk about it.&nbsp; I looked at the clock and it was just barely 6
am, the sunlight was streaming in through the windows and I could hear
the birds chirping away.&nbsp; It is hard to describe the feeling that
I had, but I felt like I needed to be out in the sun and that it would
cleanse me.&nbsp; I am not a morning person by any means, but I got
dressed and went out to sit in the sun and tried&nbsp; not to think
about what happened to me.&nbsp; My husband followed me outside about
fifteen minutes later and told me that he had checked the phone and the
phone had said that the phone call was from an unknown location.&nbsp;
He told me that the phone barely rang once before I had vaulted across
him and picked it up. He thought it was weird how I reacted to the
phone since I can usually sleep through anything.&nbsp; I think about
that day often and I still can remember the sound of the growls coming
from the phone.&nbsp; I tell myself, that someone must have crank
called me, but how could they know what I was dreaming about?&nbsp; Why
did I jump up and grab the phone with such urgency when my husband was
much closer to the phone?&nbsp; This may sound so silly to you since I
did not see an entity, but to me this is the scariest thing I have ever
experienced in my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am thoroughly convinced that I
had contact with something evil that day.<br>

Greenlawn Cemetery<br>
<br>
<br>
By: snowcoon@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hi there! My name is Becca and I'm a 23 year old from New Hampshire. <br>
Throughout my life like many people, I've had my fair share of creepy
happenings and experiences with things that go bump in the night. But
there is one story in particular that happened just a few months ago
that probally has to be among the most scariest and fascinating of all
the things that have ever happened in my life.<br>
Just up the road from my apartment, behind an elementary school sits a
huge graveyard called GreenLawn Cemetary. For as long as I can
remember, there have ALWAYS been stories told of stuff that goes on in
there. Growing up in this same neighborhood, the local neighborhood
kids use to talk about how they could sometimes hear weird noises,
cries, and voices coming from inside. People would talk about how the
statues would sometimes move and how strange darkish blue lights/mist
could be seen hovering over or near certain gravestones. My aunt, who
use to live directly across the cemetary,&nbsp; would tell my mother
how she could look out across the street into the cemetary at certain
times of the year and just get really uneasy vibes. The cemetary isn't
just scary in the sense of spirits, but it seems to carry a bad omen
with it. There are many, many cemetarys and graveyards in my town, but
this one seems to harbor a lot of horrible activity. A few years back,
a&nbsp; cat had been mutiliated ((May the poor thing rest in peace))
and hung from a tree out there by some highschool students that were
apparently on drugs of some kind. When the police found one of the kids
who did it, he was hiding in the woods near by wearing his mother's
wedding dress ((This wasn't a rumor; it was in the newspaper)). Crazy
people lurk in the marshes that partially make up the cemetary, which
makes parents terrorfied of allowing there kids out there, especially
towards dark.<br>
That being said, I had always heard the stories and the rumors for
pretty much most of my life, but never actually experienced anything
myself. My boyfriend, who is originally from Mass moved up to NH to be
with me. <br>
Together, the two of us got an apartment that sits back in my old
neighborhood where I grew up and the cemetary is a two minute walk from
us. <br>
We've taken walks in there before during the day, but I never really
told him any of the stories about the place. Towards the back of the
cemetary, sits an abandoned church. Funeral services I guess use to
take place there up until the 70's when they stopped for some reason.
One night, my boyfriend decided to go out there with our neighbor and
check it out. I decided to sit <br>
this one out and stayed home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a little before 12:30AM, my boyfriend <br>
came bursting in through the front door, his face PALE white and his
eyes watering and teary. When he gets genuinly scared, his eyes start
to water and tear up. I've only seen this happen with him maybe once or
twice during the two years we've been together. I asked him what was
wrong to which he replied "I.....saw something. I don't want to talk
about it right now....maybe tomorrow". Imediatly all the stories from
growing up came rushing back to me and at that point I knew that he
REALLY must have seen something and that just maybe all those stories
and rumors I had heard from over the years weren't just rumors. After
about an hour, I was able to calm him down enough to where he tried to
explain as best he could what had happened.<br>
Him and the neighbor had gone into the cemetary and as they were
walking through, things were fine. They were laughing and having a
grand old time, completly unafraid and at ease. They walked down the
road that took them down a hill and got to a brudge that goes over a
small brook that runs through the middle of the cemetary. Just as they
approached the bridge, my boyfriend looked out to the other side of the
brook, and between two pine trees "stood" an old man on the second step
of some stairs leading to a family plot, looking off to the side into
the woods. He was extremly old and frail looking and was wearing an old
colonial style suit. But the thing was, from the waste down, there was
nothing. Where his hips and legs should have been, the bottom of his
suit was completly shredded to rags. At first, my boyfriend thought
maybe it was just some kids playing a joke on him, but when the man
turned and looked to him, fluently and in the way a real person would,
there were no eyes; just big black holes. That was what got to him the
most above all. At this point every hair on him was standing on end and
he began to back up. He asked the neighbor if he could see it too, but
he was apparently looking in the completly wrong direction. At that
point, my boyfriend turned and started running as fast he could and the
neighbor took off behind him. He ran all the way to the very top of the
hill and turned to look back down to see if it was still there, hoping
that it would have disapeared, but sure enough, it was still there,
staring at him. At that point, they turned and ran out and didn't stop
running until they got to the apartment. He told me how the old man
never looked as if he going to harm them, but seemed more suprised then
anything to see that he had been spotted. <br>
At the time, I was talking to a friend of mine on AIM and explained to
her how my boyfriend had seen something and was really scared. At
first, all he wanted to do was go to bed and didn't want anything else
to do with that cemetary for a very long time. But once he calmed down,
he decided he wanted to go back with more people and see if he could
show them, that maybe he was still there. I asked my friend and she
agreed. We met up with her and headed back out towards the cemetary. As
we reached the top of the hill, we could see the spot from a distance
where he had seen the old man. There was nothing. As we walked down the
hill towards the bridge, my boyfriend started crying quietly. I guess
he was mixed with frustration, fear, confusion and probally anger
because he thought he must have sounded crazy to us. My friend and I as
we walked towards the bridge told him the storys about the place that
we had heard from just about everyone growing up and that it was
notorious for scary activity. We crossed the bridge and headed over to
the family plot, which we noted was the Colonial Family. The Colonial
family was the group of people that founded our city way back in the
1700's. My friend had brought along incents which she lighted and stuck
next to the entry of the family plot as a sign of respect and we went
up in to check out gravestones to see if we could maybe find which one
belonged to the old man. <br>
About maybe 15 minutes after being there, I spotted a gravestone way
towards the back which belonged to a man named Harry Colonial, May 1,
1789 - August 18, 1806. I quickly called my friends over to check it
out in which we realized something. It was August 18th! My boyfriend
and the neighbor had left the house at about 11:40PM and had gotten
into the cemetary sometime around 12:00AM. We also noted the that he
had died in 1806, which meant that it was exactly the 200 year
anniversary of this guys death! My friend took her lighter and tried to
light an incent for him, but her lighter wouldn;t light! She tok a few
paces back and tried it and was able to get it to light. We placed it
next to the gravestone and turned to leave and go back home. We went
back to the cemetary a few times during the day since then, but now I'm
a little bit wiser and more aware of the things that happen down there.<br>

Job Corp Morganfield haunting<br>
<br>
<br>
By: bludlettingudie@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
I'm an ILA (independent living advisor) at Earle C. Clements Job Corp
in Morganfield, Ky.&nbsp; I started working there in march 06 on the
night shift.&nbsp; <br>
During my second and last week of training, the woman training me was
telling me about the campus being haunted, reportings that students had
made and even some experiences of her own.&nbsp; Then she had to leave
the dorm for a minute so I was the only person in the dorm awake.<br>
The dorm I was in is the only one in our campus with a female wing and I went to use the bathroom on that wing.<br>
The dorm structure is shaped like an "L" with a door going to each wing
and a large rubbermaid trash can at each door.&nbsp; The door going to
the girls wing had to be held open with two wooden wedges where all
other wing doors only need one.&nbsp; These wedges were place on each
side of the bottom of the door and the door opened inward to the lobby
in the bend of dorm.&nbsp; The trash can for that wing had also been
left on the lobby side of the door way that night.<br>
So anyway, I had to go use the bathroom on the girls wing and i'm the only person in the dorm awake.<br>
Just as I got inside the bathroom door I heard a very loud bang from
somewhere close to the lobby.&nbsp; The bathroom is in the middle of
the wing.&nbsp; <br>
The sound didn't scare or startle me and I started to ignore it all
together but thought there might be something going on with one of the
students so I walked back out into the hall and looked toward the lobby.<br>
The wing door had closed on the trash can that was sitting there and
had caused the bang i heard but no one was in the lobby or the
hall.&nbsp; I didn't hear any students talking or moving around.&nbsp;
No one had just shut their room door, so I just stood there a minute
staring at the door.<br>
Then the hair on the back of my neck stood on end and I got a cold
chill.&nbsp; I walked to the door and didn't see the wooden wedges that
had been holding the door open.&nbsp; I opened the door and saw them
both laying out in the floor away from the door way altogether.<br>
I called my co-worker and told her what happened.&nbsp; We laughed
about it cuz we had just talked about the campus being haunted but I
was spooked for the rest of the night and I haven't worked that dorm
alone at night since then.&nbsp; I work 2nd shift now because there's
more activity with the students and I was getting really bored on 3rds
so i'm not there at night much anymore but that's the only supernatural
encounter i've ever had in my life and I won't be forgetting it anytime
soon.<br>
I've never had a student complain to me about seeing shadows on the
walls or people hovering over them at night but my co-worker that night
said that students in the next dorm over used to get scared and report
a shadow on the wall that would always go behind the same locker
everytime they saw it.<br>
At the time this happened to me, the dorm she was talking about was
shut down and unpopulated due to remodleing.&nbsp; When it reopened a
couple of months later I started working in that dorm but on 2nd shift.<br>
One night after lights out (after 10:30) one of the guys on B wing
walked out into the hall, looked at me and said "come tell these guys
to shut up so i can go to sleep".&nbsp; I laughed cuz i knew there was
really not much telling what the guys in that room where doing becuase
they were always doing something silly at night before bed.<br>
I went in the room of 6 guys and 5 of them were laughing.&nbsp; Then
one of them explained that they were talking about ghosts and scaring
their roommate for the fun of it.&nbsp; Turns out that they felt like
the room was being haunted because they could hear something in the
room at night but no one was up.&nbsp; They also said that the room
would suddenly get real cold at night but it didn't happen very much.<br>
I told them that the center was haunted and has been documented as such
on the internet.&nbsp; It freaked them out because they didn't
know.&nbsp; (it's not like the recruiters tell the enrollees before
they decide to come to<br>
morganfield)&nbsp; The dorm was shut down again shortly after that for
repair and has since been reopened again but we had to move the
students to another dorm during the repair so I'm not in that dorm
anymore.&nbsp; That dorm is now the CO-ED dorm and populated.&nbsp; The
dorm i had my first experience is in now shut down due to lack of
staffing.<br>
I thought you would like to hear about the Morganfield Job Corp from
someone who worked there.&nbsp; Hope what I have told you is of some
use.<br>
The CO-ED dorm sits where the POW camp was back during the war.&nbsp;
At least that's what my co-worker said that night we talked about
it.&nbsp; She's been there for eon's, i'd like to think she knows what
she's talking about.<br>

Lake Lure Inn Hauntings<br>
<br>
<br>
By: sharlotte333@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
Hello.&nbsp; I am an employee at the 1927 Lake Lure Inn and Spa.&nbsp;
I heard that some of your investigators paid a visit to the Inn last
night, and heard a couple of spine-tingling experiences of our front
desk associate, Christine.&nbsp; I have another tale you may want to
add to your notes...<br>
In 1996, I was involved in a local group that staged a murder mystery
weekend at the Inn.&nbsp; Friday evening was spent getting the guests
familiar with the characters, letting them begin to piece together the
relationships involved in the plot.&nbsp; After much socializing, and
laying the groundwork for the upcoming "murder", all of the actors and
guests headed to their rooms for a good night's sleep.&nbsp; Of course,
we had other plans...<br>
We woke everyone in the hotel around 2 in the morning, roused by the
sound of gun shots on the third floor.&nbsp; The hallway filled with
guests and actors, and with the help of the local EMTs, the "body" was
removed from the hotel.&nbsp; After all of the excitement was over, the
actors headed back to their rooms.&nbsp; Two of these performers, Moe
and Claire Daigle, returned to their room to find that during their
absence, someone had opened their bathroom door (blocking access to the
door opening into the hallway), turned on their clock radio, and opened
their window.&nbsp; Their room was within sight of the scene of the
"murder", and at no time was anyone seen approaching their room.<br>
This took place years before I became an employee of the Inn.&nbsp; In
the past year I have had a few unexplainable encounters.&nbsp; It seems
the ghost, or ghosts (depending on which stories you've heard), enjoy
keeping the housekeeping staff on their toes.&nbsp; Often while
cleaning rooms, I would turn to find a television turned on, though no
one had touch the remote or the set.&nbsp; Doors would swing open, or
unexpectedly close.&nbsp; Many times, after fluffing the down padding
and making the bed, I would return to find the shape of a person
pressed into the comforter. Nothing menacing, merely mischievous.&nbsp;
Since changing from housekeeping to the F&amp;B department, I haven't
had any notable run-ins with our spectral guests.<br>
I hope these tidbits can help.&nbsp; If there are any other questions
you may have about the Inn, please feel free to contact me.&nbsp; I
will also spread the word to any employees that may have a tale or two
to add.&nbsp; I wish you luck on your ghost tracking endeavors.&nbsp; <br>

Lexington MO<br>

First of all, after finding this, it sent chills down my spine. But,
here's my story anyway.&nbsp; I went to Wentworth Military Summer camp,
while my father was camp director there.&nbsp; Since my parents
divorced, we would get to go see my dad for the summer.&nbsp; I went
there from 1981-1986 (summers falling 2nd-7th grades), and the summer
youth stayed at Groendyke Hall.&nbsp; With the building built on a
slope, I remember the end of the hallway going down into what was
called the "dungeon" rooms or "basement" rooms. The door to this area
was closed and locked, and my father admitted to me one year that he
had never been down there all the way in, because the ceilings were
left at normal height, but the floor was a good 6 feet lower, leaving
the ceilings at about 15 feet high.&nbsp; He said he didn't even like
going to that end of the hallway, because it gave him the
heebie-jeebies.&nbsp; He described it as dark and damp, with windows to
the 6 rooms down there just being below the ceiling of the room, since
the rooms were actually underground, and since there was a steady
legend that they had put a boy down there years earlier as a discipline
measure.&nbsp; A day later the camp went on a week long camp out
several miles away, and after another day, while there, the directors
realized that no one had ever gone in and took the boy out.&nbsp; By
the time they got back to the barracks, it was a good 3 days later, and
the boy had taken his life.&nbsp; It gets worse. There were feces and
urine in all 6 rooms, where the boy had gone everywhere and smeared
into the beds and on the walls.&nbsp; And, apparently, he had tried
killing himself by jumping from the top of the stairs head first into
the concrete floor.&nbsp; According to the autopsy, this broke his
neck, but he survived.&nbsp; From what was left, he had beaten his head
against the door so many times, that he probably fell into
unconsciousness, and died of a series of brain contusions.&nbsp;
Supposedly, they could never get the smell out of the dungeon, so they
just boarded it up and left it locked.<br>
After my 3rd summer there, my brother and I took my father's keys and
headed down to the basement.&nbsp; We opened up the door, dared the
other one to go in. Finally creeped into the hallway.&nbsp; We were
standing there at the top of the stairs in almost total darkness, when
the door SLAMS behind us!!&nbsp; We freaked!&nbsp; I still feel that
because of that situation, I have to be slightly intoxicated to get in
an elevator.&nbsp; We screamed so loud for so long, it seemed like we
were there for days trying to get someone to help us open the
door.&nbsp; There was no handle on our side of the door.&nbsp; We heard
the commotion from everyone coming down, and I remember my father
yelling from the other side of the door, "Do you have my keys?"&nbsp;
We freaked even worse.&nbsp; NO ONE had another key and we were locked
in, with no power being supplied to that end of the building for years.
My brother and I made it to one of the rooms, where just enough light
made it through the 12 inch class window which seemed like it was 20
feet up in the air.&nbsp; The light outlined a bed and a table on the
wall.&nbsp; In almost sheer darkness, we closed the door to the room,
and took the mattress off the bed, and used the bed frame to throw
against the window.&nbsp; After breaking the window, we realized that
we would have to go back to the door to tell my father that we had
broken the window and for them to come throw down some type of rope or
something. But, when we got back to the door, there was no sound coming
from the other side.&nbsp; We screamed again and again, our voices
going horse from all the screaming.&nbsp; Finally, we heard others
yelling and the door flung open, and my dad was standing there.&nbsp;
It was a pretty frightful experience.&nbsp; <br>
We never went back down there again!!!!<br>

My Sensitive Son<br>
<br>
By: dorothy.melendrez@swri.org<br>
<br>
Hi. I have several stories to share with you about my 8-year old son.<br>
I'll try to make this as short as possible, since there are a few
stories.&nbsp; Ever since he was very little (around 1 year), I can
remember him coming to me frightened about different things he
saw.&nbsp; The first instance, he was only a year old at the time, and
we were living in a two-bedroom apartment in San Antonio, TX.&nbsp; My
husband was attending college in the evenings, so my son and I were
left alone during those times.&nbsp; This particular evening, I was in
my room, and he was playing in his, and all of a sudden, he ran into my
room, crying.&nbsp; He came up to me, and grabbed my hand.&nbsp; He
wasn't talking yet, so he communicated through gestures, cries, grunts,
etc.&nbsp; He took my hand and began leading me to his room, and
pointed to a corner in his room and grunted, as if to show me
something.&nbsp; Of course, I couldn't see anything, but I could tell
he was frightened by whatever it was.&nbsp; Also, this apartment we
lived in at the time may have been haunted.&nbsp; I never knew for
sure, but I always had an uneasy feeling there, and some strange things
happened there too, so I completely took my son seriously.<br>
Now, fast-forward to about a year and a half to two years later.&nbsp;
My son was close to 3, and at that time, we were living in a mobile
home in Von Ormy, TX.&nbsp; We had been living there for about a year
and by this time, he was already talking.&nbsp; He came to my husband
and I numerous times, telling us there were people in his room.&nbsp;
My husband and I would be in the living room watching T.V., and my son
would be playing in his room, and all of a sudden he'd run to us,
saying there were people in his room.&nbsp; At the times he did this,
he would stay with us, and would not want to go back in there until
later, and that's when he'd say they were gone.&nbsp; Of course, we'd
always check his room and there would be nothing.<br>
He also kept saying there was a little boy in his bathroom, and blood
in the tub.&nbsp; Sometimes whenever he'd pass the bathroom in the
hallway, that's when he would tell me, and that would scare the heck
outta me!<br>
After all this, time went by, and he stopped telling us things for a
while, but then he started saying three little boys lived in his room,
and they would play with him, and sometimes scare him, because they
would come and go through his wall.&nbsp; At first I thought they were
imaginary friends, but after he told me names and described them, that
changed my mind.&nbsp; I can't remember the names he gave me, but I
thought it was strange, because he had never been in daycare, wasn't in
school (he was only 3), and we didn't know any kids with those
names.&nbsp; I asked him how old were they, and all he could say was,
"They're little boys, just like me."&nbsp; I didn't know what to think
of this, it was all very bizzare, and because nothing out of the
ordinary ever happened at that house, nor did my husband and I ever see
anything. As time went on, he eventually stopped talking about the
little boys, and never brought anything else up. The house was only
owned by my husband's cousin, and it was only about 10 yrs. old.&nbsp;
After him and his family moved out, it was owned by an ice house owner
on his property, but I don't think anyone actually lived in it, so I
highly doubt anyone died in there, unless something happnened on the 5
acre land the house was on when we lived there.&nbsp; We'll never
know...<br>
Several years later, we moved out of the mobile home back to S.A. to
live in my Grandmother's house temporarily.&nbsp; This happened about a
year and a half ago, when my son was 6.&nbsp; It's possible my
Grandma's house was haunted, because three people passed away there,
both of my Great-grandparents, and also my Grandfather.&nbsp; I also
felt presences there, and I always saw shadows pass under the lights,
but my son actually saw something - twice!&nbsp; The first time, we
were all asleep, it was very early in the morning and he was
awake.&nbsp; He said he saw movement right outside his bedroom door,
and described it as a dark shadow gliding from side to side.&nbsp; He
had his door closed, but he said he could see it from under the door,
and it looked like a foot.&nbsp; He said he was scared and just watched
until it went away.&nbsp; Then about a year later he told me of the
strangest thing he saw one night.&nbsp; He said he woke up in the
middle of the night to get a drink of water from the kitchen, but
before he got to the kitchen, he said he saw two big glowing white
rectangles floating next to each other above the table.&nbsp; I told
him it was probably a light shining from outside, but he said it was
not, everything was dark except for those two glowing shapes.&nbsp; He
said he was too scared to get closer, so he went back in his room and
went to sleep!<br>
Strange again, but I said there was nothing to be afraid of, and then
he said, "Yeah, it's probably just my Great-grandpa!"&nbsp; Sorry this
was so long, but I hope you liked it.&nbsp; <br>
