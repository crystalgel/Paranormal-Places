<b>Queen Mary</b>
<br><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend Billy worked on the "Bat Man Forever"
movie filmed at the</b>
<br><b>Spruce Goose. The film crew stayed at the Queen Mary.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night he invited a couple of people and I
to stay on the boat with</b>
<br><b>him.&nbsp; We decided to go on a hunt for ghosts because the ship
was supposed to</b>
<br><b>be haunted. Billy and the rest of us played "hide and go seek" on
the upper</b>
<br><b>deck. I hid in a corridor between a room and a smoke stack, where
I found a</b>
<br><b>door that was welded shut.&nbsp; I stayed there for 5 minutes or
so until I hears</b>
<br><b>foot steps.&nbsp; I jumped out and said "Boo," but nobody was there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that point I freaked out and ran for his state
room. I was running</b>
<br><b>through hall ways. I felt like I was in the movie "The Shining."&nbsp;
I went</b>
<br><b>around a corner and ran through a woman and a child.&nbsp; I screamed
"Help me!".</b>
<br><b>Other people that were staying in the hotel, came out of their rooms.
I was</b>
<br><b>hysterical.&nbsp; My friends heard me and ran out to get me. I told
them what</b>
<br><b>happened. They were too afraid to play the game, so they stayed
in the room.</b>
<br><b>I was playing alone.&nbsp; But they said that before we started
they saw footsteps</b>
<br><b>in the mist on the ground, and decided playing hide and go seek
was not what</b>
<br><b>they wanted to do.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what happened on that ship,
but I know that I want nothing</b>
<br><b>to do with it.</b>

<p><b>Paranormal Activities</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Beachain@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband, daughter and I have lived in this house for about 10
years. We</b>
<br><b>bought&nbsp; it from the builders. It is in a subdivision that is
old farm land.</b>
<br><b>No deep significance is known about the area.</b>
<br><b>About 3 years ago a casual comment between my husband and I brought
out that</b>
<br><b>both of us had been seeing creatures (for lack of a better term)
for</b>
<br><b>sometime. We then cautiously brought this up with our daughter (now
18 yrs</b>
<br><b>and out on her own). She looked at us oddly then resonded that she
too had</b>
<br><b>seen somethings.</b>
<br><b>All three of us had initially seen the same things. A blurry bend
in space</b>
<br><b>running along the floor like a cat or dog. In fact, we could sense
that they</b>
<br><b>were cat or dogs. Later both my daughter and I saw more. I have
seen the</b>
<br><b>creature materialize more fully to see the color of their fur and
other</b>
<br><b>features. I had one that peeked at me from the foyer like it was
playing tag</b>
<br><b>or chase.</b>
<br><b>At no time have we felt any maliciousness. Also my daughter and
I have seen a</b>
<br><b>male. Tall and in his 30's. Both my daughter and I have heard voices.
We also</b>
<br><b>have had our pets see these creatures and even chase them. 2 pets
now dead</b>
<br><b>had been seeing them for years. And no we have not ever seen our
own deceased</b>
<br><b>pets. So far the only none family memeber to see anything has been
the 6 year</b>
<br><b>old boy of friends of ours. He said he spoke with the tall man with
the</b>
<br><b>mustache in the living room while we were changing clothes. He was
not afraid</b>
<br><b>of him just a bit amazed. Not seeing this I can not know if he was
really</b>
<br><b>seeing him or if his imagination was getting to him.</b>
<br><b>Both my husband and I were at dinner in a locat restaurant and we
both saw</b>
<br><b>things there as well. I felt a cool touch of hands on the back of
my neck. I</b>
<br><b>thought my daughter had walked in and was coming up behind me. No
one was</b>
<br><b>there. I had a sensation of someone watching us standing near a
doorway to</b>
<br><b>the kitchen. Not a full image just bend in space, if that makes
sense. A few</b>
<br><b>minutes late I spotted movement at the table next to us, on the
floor. I then</b>
<br><b>saw the fleeting image of a ringed tail...and I knew it was a racoon</b>
<br><b>scampering around the chairs. Just then my husband made a comment
about how</b>
<br><b>he was seeing these "things" now and we were not even at home.</b>
<br><b>I have often found myself walking in stores, bulidings, etc and
have stopped</b>
<br><b>and walked around a thing not visible but clearly standing or walking
in my</b>
<br><b>path. I have also spotted "people" only to have them disappear.
I used to</b>
<br><b>think it was a trick of my eyes but now I am not so sure.</b>
<br><b>Last night I was watching television and felt an icy cold feeling
start at</b>
<br><b>the base of my spine and run up to my head. I felt extremely cold
and then I</b>
<br><b>saw a whitish blur in the hallway. It was about 3 1/2 feet tall.
It walked</b>
<br><b>into the wall of the bathroom. I got up to look/feel the area but
got</b>
<br><b>nothing. I then asked my husband where the cat was as she had spotted</b>
<br><b>something of the same height about a month ago. She was in the kitchen.
She</b>
<br><b>was just sitting and seemed fine. I sat down and about a minute
later she</b>
<br><b>made a run to the hallway and stopped right in the area where I
had seen the</b>
<br><b>image and she began to investigate the area.</b>
<br><b>This was the first time I had ever had the cold feeling. The other
times have</b>
<br><b>been neutral. I felt a bit more on edge after this encounter. Even
more so</b>
<br><b>than when I felt the "hands" touch my neck.</b>
<br><b>Only recently have I seen or heard of encounters with animals. I
know very</b>
<br><b>little about all of this. My husband and I are involved in law enforcement</b>
<br><b>and are aware of how people can become "tricked" by simple things
that go</b>
<br><b>bump in the night...but we are fully awake, alert, and usually there
others</b>
<br><b>seeing the same thing.</b>

<br><b>My ex lived in the trailer with his new girlfriend when he was killed..
About</b>

ok but I</b>
<br><b>could hear the water still running ..Then one night I was awoken
to the voice</b>
<br><b>of a man calling my name and i yelled out yes. I thought a friend
had droped</b>

there</b>
<br><b>so I walked all around the trailer but couldn,t see anyone... Then
a few</b>

<br><b>Sightings</b><b></b>

<p><b>Dave about 8 years ago i worked in a bar in my neighborhood.&nbsp;
I told my</b>
<br><b>grandfather about the bar and he remember years ago a cop got shot
there</b>
<br><b>during a hold-up- the cop just won money on the horses he said.&nbsp;
I mentioned</b>
<br><b>this to the owner and other people just as conversation.&nbsp; About
2 weeks</b>
<br><b>later i saw a cloudy image of a man walk passed the cigrette machine,
I</b>
<br><b>ignored it since I had a couple.&nbsp; One night the owner and I
are cleaning up</b>
<br><b>,I looked quickly at the middle of the bar and saw two guys sitting
down</b>
<br><b>looking at me.&nbsp; I quicky ask the owner if she saw that she
said no , then</b>
<br><b>I explain to her what I saw. The first guy was very vivid even till
today-</b>
<br><b>brown hair 24yrs around or older and a mustache and smiling, the
other a</b>
<br><b>blur. She told her what I saw and described the first guy she said
it sounds</b>
<br><b>like someone who used to go there and died at a young age.&nbsp;
After that I saw</b>
<br><b>no images again but a customer said a man went into the ladies room
and</b>
<br><b>there was no one there he was a older man not drunk but insisting
he saw the</b>
<br><b>man.&nbsp; Now I am a teacher and lived with a friend about 4 yrs
ago . Her</b>
<br><b>mother passed away with cancer.&nbsp; Janice left on vacation for
the weekend and</b>
<br><b>I was alone in her house.&nbsp; One night I was watching TV and
the alarm(fire)</b>
<br><b>went on throughtout the house.&nbsp; The reason I dont know the
three floors were</b>
<br><b>connected to the same alarm into the house wiring-so no weak battery
alert.</b>
<br><b>Then it stopped I looked all over but no reason for the alarm to
be set off.</b>
<br><b>The alarm only lasted 3 mins on.&nbsp; I went back to watching tv
when the remote</b>
<br><b>can off the tv -maybe the vibrations of the TV?&nbsp; Then went
to the kitchen</b>
<br><b>and left the spoon by the sink edge as I walked back to the living
room the</b>
<br><b>spoon fell into the sink. I wasnt scared but surprised- if this
was for real</b>
<br><b>or what. Moved out because my god father passed away and they ask

<p><b>Sleepwalking</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fta125@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well here I go I have told very few people of my experience. I spent
the first 12 years of my life in a pretty old house about 120 years old.
Well for as long as I can remember almost everynight I would wakeup and
see a large white shape roughly of a man glide past my door and into my
bathroom. The only other people in the house were my mother and sister
and they are both short around 5 feet. The white shape was easily 6 feet.
It wasn't freindly or hostile it just glided down the hall. the only Odd
thing that happend was i would sleepwalk into the hallway and on several
occasions my mother would see me in the hallway standing there staring
off blankly. I only remember one occasion when I was sleepwalking and that
was in the third person. I was off too the side watching my mother and
me having a conversation about why I was in the hall way. My mother would
take me back too my room and put me too sleep. 2 or 3 times I would get
mad at her and she would forcibly have too carry me back too my room, but
once back in my room I'd go right back too sleep. I mentioned the ghost
too her but she just blew it off. I moved out of that house 13 years ago
and have never sleptwalk since then.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Little Boy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Stacy_Condie@sento.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Before my husband Rob and I were married, I stayed with him in his
friend's house. Rob used to tell me stories about a little boy that would
look at him in his bed, trying to sleep, while standing in the window well
of Rob's basement window.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, before I stayed
there, the little boy was staring at Rob. Not moving. Just looking at him
in the window well. Rob didn't know who he was, so he just hit the window
with his fist, and yelled "Get out of here!" Tke little boy didn't&nbsp;
flinch, didn't blink, or move. It really scared Rob since he believes in
spirits and afterlife.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning while
I was at school, he paged me so he could tell me about it. He also told
me about how he had a dream about me the same night. He dreampt that we
were walking together and he was looking at me. After a minute, he wasn't
looking at my face anymore. It was a mean, evil face. He said that it was
black, and had really evil eyes. The figure took a swing at him, and hit
him in the jaw. he woke up the next morning, and his jaw was sore.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He used to listen to
music at night when he was going to sleep. One night, when we were getting
ready for bed, I asked him if the music helped him sleep better. He just
told me yes, and said that there was another reason, but he just didn't
want to scare me. I asked him to tell me anyway, so he just told me that
he heard noises that he didn't want to listen to, and the msic drowned
them out, and kind of soothed him. I just left it at that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, while we
were trying to sleep, I could tell there was something wrong with Rob.
He finally told me that he could feel the same presence that he felt the
night he saw the evil face. We layed there awake for a while, until he
finally couldn't stand it anymore, and turned the lights on. I guess the
lights made it leave.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We never had experiences
like that for a while. We had a spirit of a young lady in our first appartment.
She would just show up sometimes as little gold sparks that quickly flew
across the room. She would also sometimes appear in the bathroom at night,
which was a few feet away from our bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rob's brother and a few
of his friends have seen the little boy. He doesn't really do any harm.
Sometimes you'll just see him and he'll run around the room and go into
a wall or something like that. We believe that maybe he was just a little
boy that was killed in the area a long time ago, since Rob's friend's house
was fairly new.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About six months after
we were married, I couldn't go to sleep. We had just watched a movie and
were going to bed. I just put my arms around Rob and cried. When he asked
what was wrong, I just cried. I couldn't get anything out. Finally, I told
him that I felt something evil in the room. I could point out where it
was and everything. After I pointed it out, he started to feel it too.
It finally got so bad that we had to leave the house and go for a walk.
I didn't want to go home, but Rob has a bad ankle, so we had to go back.
When we got there, I still felt uneasy. So we prayed for it to go away
and to never come in our room again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We haven't experienced
anything like that since, but I believe that spirits are attracted to Rob.</b><b></b>

<br><b>West Virginia Apparition</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: takers@milehigh.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have very much enjoyed visiting your web page.&nbsp; The stories
related</b>
<br><b>are well written and, for the most part, I think, true.&nbsp; I
would like to</b>
<br><b>contribute my family's and my own personal experience of a real
life</b>
<br><b>haunting.&nbsp; I swear before God to its truthfulness.</b>
<br><b>Ben Creek, Mingo County, West Virginia lies only a few short miles
from</b>
<br><b>the southwestern panhandle of the state of Virginia.&nbsp; The area
is</b>
<br><b>mountaineous and rugged and not a far distance from the Hatfield
and</b>
<br><b>McCoy "stomping ground." Further, this part of Mingo County is</b>
<br><b>relatively isolated and one's closest neighbors can be several miles</b>
<br><b>"down the creek" or "up the mountain."</b>
<br><b>The year was 1971 that my family and I (myself being the youngest
of six</b>
<br><b>siblings) moved to Mingo County, West Virginia from the Cleveland,
Ohio</b>
<br><b>area. Believe me, to describe this change as a culture shock is</b>
<br><b>minimizing the experience. The geography was different, as well
as the</b>
<br><b>people, and the lifestyle generally.&nbsp; The poverty was incomprehensible</b>
<br><b>to my eight year old eyes. My parents, being from the Mingo county
area</b>
<br><b>as children themselves, desired moving back to the place of their
roots</b>
<br><b>and to be geographically closer to their own families.</b>
<br><b>We moved into a modest and delapidating two-story house (the second</b>
<br><b>story was actually a full, unfinished attic) on Ben Creek, about
1/2</b>
<br><b>mile up the creek from our nearest neighbor, my Uncle&nbsp; Walker.&nbsp;
Being</b>
<br><b>short on money, my father searched for the most economical house
in the</b>
<br><b>area.&nbsp; In no time we found our house.&nbsp; The grass and weeds
had grown up</b>
<br><b>high, and with boards over the&nbsp; windows, the house looked ramshackled</b>
<br><b>and abandoned.&nbsp; We had to "make do", though.</b>
<br><b>After we moved in, we began to make the best out of our "new" home.</b>
<br><b>Being only eight years old and in the third grade, classmates began</b>
<br><b>commenting to me if we had seen any "ghosts" in our house.&nbsp;
My brother</b>
<br><b>(ten at the time) and I responded no we had not and we usually left
it</b>
<br><b>off at that. I am ashamed&nbsp; to admit it but, in all honesty,
we thought</b>
<br><b>these people were backwood's morons.</b>
<br><b>At the same time, my three sisters in junior and senior high were
also</b>
<br><b>beginning to get quizzed by their classmates along a similar line
of</b>
<br><b>questioning.&nbsp; It seemed everyone "on the creek" knew something
about our</b>
<br><b>house except us--the unsuspecting "city slickers."</b>
<br><b>Shortly thereafter, everything changed.</b>
<br><b>It was on a warm, late-spring Sunday evening, shortly before dusk
just</b>
<br><b>as the sunlight was just&nbsp; beginning to slip behind one of the</b>
<br><b>mountains.&nbsp; It was still light outside, only slowly growing
dimmer.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>father and mother and one of my sisters had gone into Matewan (about</b>
<br><b>twenty miles away) to grocery shop and to stop to visit relatives
in</b>
<br><b>that area of the county.&nbsp; I, along with my brother Tim (10),
sister</b>
<br><b>Donna (14), and sister Debbie (16) were lounging around the living
room</b>
<br><b>and doing what kids do:&nbsp; Tim and I were playing some sort of
boardgame</b>
<br><b>on the floor, while my sisters watched television and talked.&nbsp;
Our dog,</b>
<br><b>Mitten, was chained up to the front porch.&nbsp; Suddenly, Mitten
began</b>
<br><b>barking and&nbsp; growling absolutely hysterically.&nbsp; I had
rarely heard</b>
<br><b>Mitten sound so, at the same time, distressed and threatened.</b>
<br><b>Initially, my brother Tim and I (being our family's "little men")
jumped</b>
<br><b>up and ran toward the opened front door thinking that either a bear
or a</b>
<br><b>human was going to come into the house!&nbsp; Just then, Tim and
I leaned out</b>
<br><b>of the front door with our sister Debbie right behind.&nbsp; Stretching
our</b>
<br><b>necks out the door to see what Mitten was barking at, stood a human</b>
<br><b>figure standing at the corner of the house.&nbsp; (By the way he
was</b>
<br><b>standing, we could only see his front half.&nbsp; The backside was
behind the</b>
<br><b>corner of the house.)</b>
<br><b>We thought at first that it was a man trying to break in on us kids</b>
<br><b>knowing my father was not home. But, this was like no man we had
ever</b>
<br><b>seen!&nbsp; Still thinking it was a human man trying to get in,
we yelled at</b>
<br><b>him to not come in because we had a gun and would use it. (We really
did</b>
<br><b>have one and Debbie went to get it.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Debbie
got back to the</b>
<br><b>door, and within full sight of Tim, Debbie, Mitten, and myself&nbsp;
this</b>
<br><b>thing moved.&nbsp; As it moved, we knew immediately this thing certainly
was</b>
<br><b>not human.&nbsp; It was a solid black figure, with no light reflection</b>
<br><b>whatsoever reflecting off of it.&nbsp; It was like looking into
a black hole.</b>
<br><b>The shape was reminiscent of an old style fisherman hat with full-body</b>
<br><b>slicker.&nbsp; I will never forget how it looked.&nbsp; As it moved
away slowly</b>
<br><b>from the house it moved as one unit (that is to say, with no body
motion</b>
<br><b>at all) and was actually floating above the ground about one foot
and</b>
<br><b>had no feet.&nbsp; It did not make any sound as it floated down
our gravel</b>
<br><b>driveway and turned right as it reached the roadway.&nbsp; We were
in shock</b>
<br><b>and could not believe what we had witnessed.</b>
<br><b>My father did not believe us at all, and thought we were just making</b>
<br><b>this up until my mother witnessed the very same figure coming up&nbsp;
the</b>
<br><b>driveway about one week later.&nbsp; As she sat in the front door
one morning</b>
<br><b>after a cooling rain, she said it looked like it had come up out
of the</b>
<br><b>ground and&nbsp; proceeded toward the house.&nbsp; She thought that
it was going</b>
<br><b>to come on up the stairs and onto the porch, but it proceeded up
past</b>
<br><b>the corner of the house instead.</b>
<br><b>And, lastly, if my mother and we children did not make a believer
out of</b>
<br><b>my dad, he converted to one shortly thereafter.&nbsp; One night
as we slept,</b>
<br><b>we all awoke to all hell breaking loose in the attic.&nbsp; It sounded
like</b>
<br><b>somebody had broken in through a window and was smashing furniture
(we</b>
<br><b>had none up there), smashing mirrors (none), and was stomping through</b>
<br><b>glass for what seemed like hours.</b>
<br><b>This activity woke us all and it sounded as though whoever was up
there</b>
<br><b>was about to come down the stairs!&nbsp; That's when my dad and
eldest</b>
<br><b>brother Terry (18), thinking somebody had broken in and was vandelizing</b>
<br><b>the attic, armed themselves and went up the stairs.&nbsp; The noises
stopped</b>
<br><b>just as my dad was opening the attic door.&nbsp; Nothing had been
touched.</b>
<br><b>Even the proverbial cobwebs were still in the windowsills!</b>
<br><b>We still had to live in that hell house for the remaining part of
the</b>
<br><b>summer, though nothing quite so extraordinary occured.</b>
<br><b>That's my story and I swear to its authenticity.&nbsp; I am now
a 37 year old</b>
<br><b>man, occassionally fear the dark, and unexplained noises in the
night</b>
<br><b>make me break out in cold sweat. I used to be angry that how could</b>
<br><b>anything (even a ghost) psychologically scar such a young, innocent</b>
<br><b>child.&nbsp; (Since then (as an adult), I have had three additional</b>
<br><b>experiences with apparitions and knockings.)&nbsp; I am no longer
angry, but</b>
<br><b>I admit that&nbsp; I am still traumatized by the experience (what
do I do, go</b>
<br><b>to a psychiatrist and tell him I saw a ghost?).</b>
<br><b>Anybody wishing to e-mail me, please do takers@milehigh.net.&nbsp;
I would</b>
<br><b>like to know if anybody else has had a similar encounter with the</b>
<br><b>fisherman-looking, flat-black figure.</b><b></b>

house but we live in another county. as I was saying we went down to stay
with them for my sisters birthday. We stayed in the house which we now
own, it is know as "Fair View" and that is where my Uncle Tom was born
in and where he died. My bedroom was the room he spent most of his life
in. It was my sis's birthday and that night me and my cousin were sleeping
in his old bedroom. At 12 o'clock the clock in the hall woke us up, as
I opened my eyes I saw this figure go across the widow and sit in the chair
front of me, when I saw this I froze I couldn't open my mouth I was so
scared.The next morning I told my cousin about this experience, she told
me that she too saw it. It could not have been my family because my Nan
was looking after me and she claimed she was watching TV.</b><b></b>

ABOUT A YEAR</b>
<br><b>LATER ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND WERE SLEEPING TOGETHER IN HIS OLD ROOM
(I TOOK</b>

SCREAMING</b>
<br><b>FIRE OH MY GOD FIRE! ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS ALL OF MY MUSIC EQUIPMENT

<br><b>The Green Fog In My Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sashaandluka@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 14 or 15, my younger sister changed to a different
person. From a sweet little girl, to a troubled teenager. She is 2 1/2
younger than me. We had a mutual friend give her a tape with this god awful
music. Major heavy metal. Almost distorted.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I told her as soon as I first laid eyes on it (got this creepy
feeling) that something was wrong with it. She played that awful music
in her room for days....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Shortly afterwards, these weird things started to happen to
our family. I was the first to have the most terrifying experiance with
the spirit real.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Here goes, I saw my self sleeping in my room, but the view
was from my ceiling looking down. I saw my self sleeping, like a dream
with in a dream. I noticed that my bedroom closet door was about 5-6 inches
opened. All of a sudden, this pea green fog came slowly out from the bottom
of the closet, like a fog does on the ground.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Once the whole bedroom floor was covered with this fog, I
heard a small child calling my name and started laughing, in a very evil
way. I then would find myself to be fully awake. To find this heavy invisible
heavy weight on me. I would try to move, but I couldn't. I tried to scream,
my mouth wouldn't move. I couldn't move any part of my body. It was hard
to breath.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I started praying like crazy in my mind, I kept repeating
gods name Jehovah over and over, after awhile felt like forever, must of
been five minutes or so it seemed, that the weight started subsiding and
as fast as I could, I ran out of my bedroom straight to mom and dad's room.
I told them I had a bad dream. I was covered in sweat.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The next night, I hesitated for awhile, I finally fell asleep.
Nothing happened that night. I felt it was just a bad nightmare, as I thought....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I said my goodnights and went to bed. I awoke with the same
dream within a dream state. The whole attack happened, with the pea green
colored fog covering my floor. Hearing that chilling voice again, mocking
me. A gain I started praying as the night before last. Again is subsided.
I ran like a bat out hell to mom and dad.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This time, my mother saw fright in my eyes. I babbled the
whole episode of the first night and just what happened a minute ago. She
looked at me, I think I spooked her. She gave me a hug and said it was
a bad dream.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The next night I was awakened by the big thud noise. I heard
my father running down through the house towards our bedroom. I quickly
got up and went across the hall (sister's room) my father opened her door
to find my sister across her bedroom on the floor against the wall opposite
of her bed. She told me many years later that one night she was awaked
when she felt herself falling to the floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A few nights later, the pea green smoke visitor decided to
torment me some more. I relived this hilasious nightmare, running again
to mom and dad. My mom was worried now.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A few nights we were all awakened this time by the washing
machine. It was picked up and dropped. The washer and dryer were next to
each other between wall space for a perfect fit, any way, we were all freaked
out. My mom talked to our church and I remembered being three sitting in
our living room discussing the events. We prayed and asked god to protect
us and to banish this thing away. Finally my sister was convinced that
the tape with the crazy music had to go. We destroyed it and threw it in
a dumpster many miles form home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, many years later we brought up those most frightful
night and my dad had not told this to any of us in our family, on the nights
when the washing machine was picked up and dropped, my father heard children
playing. At 3am what would children playing in the middle of the country.
The window was slightly opened. He listened again to see were the voices
was coming from.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; He looked out the window, nothing. All of a sudden the voices
started getting deeper and warping. He would look at my mother. She was
in a deep sleep. The the loud thump would happen, the washing machine.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My sister fell in a sever depression while living her teenaged
years at home. To find out some history to the house, we asked our mother
if she knew anything. The owners' daughter had committed suicide in my
sister's bedroom. She shot herself in the head.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Has anyone had such as an experiance of mine? The pea green
fog, ect.... Let me know. I too have experienced other things from the
spirit realm, but those are other stories to be told. They are all true.</b><b></b>

<br><b>House of Two Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mark.hines@gte.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband and I believe we have 2
ghosts in our house which was built in 1912. One is a rather large dog,
my husband bumped into it one night on the way to bed, at the time he thought
it was our dog but she was in the bedroom with me. He just, "Go to bed
pup.", the dog disappeared. All three of us (my husband, my son and myself)
have heard the dogs toenails clicking on the linoleum floor in our kitchen,
we know it is not our dog because when we hear it she is in the same room
as we are. We believe our dog can sense it's presence too as she seems
to "play" with an unseen dog.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other ghost is a
man and he always seems to do the same thing every time he is seen or heard.
He walks in the front door, goes out to the kitchen, comes back into the
livingroom and walks up the stairs. He goes into the bathroom and stands
in front of the tub then disappears. Neither ghost has ever tried to hurt
any of us so we believe it is best to leave them alone so as not to stir
up any "evil" forces.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw Her</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JStringfellow@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had a couple of accurances, starting back
when I was five years old. My first evperience was in a old house my parents
moved us into, back in Hilton N.Y. I feel children are somewhat more sensitive
to these happenings than adults. I was awakened in the middle of the night
by a presense in my bedroom. I know I was wide awake, when I saw a white
hand come through my wall. Needless to say I was terrified. It never made
any threatening gestures at me, but it's mere presence was enough.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the weirdest experience was, when I was sixteen
years old. We were living in a one hundred year old home, that my father
bought at an auction. It wasn't until some friends of mine who lived down
the street told me, why the house was so cheap. The woman who lived there,
prior to us living there was killed in a lightning storm, right outside
in the side yard. Now I didn't give it much thought except for the lightning
rods that were on top of the house. But one day while I was at home by
myself. I was upstairs listening to music, like a normal teenager. When
there was a lightning strike that must of hit one of the lightning rods.
It shook the whole house and there was this weird sizzling sound. Well
I jumped right out of my pants and ran to my bedroom door. When I looked
down the hall I saw what appeared to be an old woman in a wheelchair, facing
away from me. Her hair was white and silver and ran all the way to the
floor. Of course I was quite stunned, and speechless. Before I could say
anything she wheeled herself around the corner. Which by the way, is right
where the stairs started. Iran down the hallway thinking she was going
to kill herself on those stairs. When I reached the top of the staircase,
she was gone. I raan down to the first level and looked down the rest of
the stairs, but she was no where to be found. At that level there is a
window that looks out to the side yard. When I looked out, there she was
in the side yard. Then there was another lightning strike fairly close,
and she was gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I never saw her again, but I never
felt very comfotable in that house again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>"The Suitcase and it's Guest"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Hmwhite99@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never knew my father's dad all that well. Considering
he died from a</b>
<br><b>stroke when I was 4 years old. I remember the day my mother told
me he had</b>
<br><b>passed away very well. Maybe because it was the first time I saw
my father</b>
<br><b>cry and it was when I noticed something different was happening
in my parents</b>
<br><b>house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father was caring for my grandfathers personal
belongings that he keep</b>
<br><b>in a suitcase at his home. When my dad came home with the suitcase
full of</b>
<br><b>old photographs and little trinkets that belonged to my Grandfather,
my</b>
<br><b>parents noticed that almost everything was cold to the touch. My
parents</b>
<br><b>thought this was strange since it was the middle of July and it
was 80</b>
<br><b>degrees outside as well as in the house, but they never thought
anything of</b>
<br><b>it. After my father showed us the photos and the watches my grandfather
had</b>
<br><b>collected over the last fifty years, he decided the suitcase would
be safe in</b>
<br><b>the basement storeroom behind the billiard table. That's when strange
things</b>
<br><b>began to happen.&nbsp; My sister and I would be watching TV in the
basement and he</b>
<br><b>storeroom door would open on it's own, lights would flicker on and
off and</b>
<br><b>the air was always chilly. Other times my sister and I would be
doing our</b>
<br><b>homework at the kitchen table and we would hear someone walking
up the stairs</b>
<br><b>or a game being played on the billiard table.&nbsp; Pool balls make
a very</b>
<br><b>distinct sound when they hit each other or go down into the pockets
alleys.</b>
<br><b>Of course no one was there when we would investigate.&nbsp; For
years this would</b>
<br><b>go on and my sister and I never felt threatened by this invisible
visitor, so</b>
<br><b>we got used to all the noises and cold spots untill it moved to

<p><b>My Sisters Home!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:cupcake@advnet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My sisters home in Illinois is haunted. It is a new home built just
5 years ago and there seems to be a "core" of activity in it. Pictures
get thrown from the wall, a fan was thrown across a room. A tall shadow
of a man appears and fades into the walls in the basement. In the kitchen
directly above, people get poked in the sides, on the shoulders and in
the back. The home was built on what used to be a corn field, no other
homes before this one . On the nights that something happens, coyotes howl
from the woods across the road at the house and her dogs act strange until
"everything" settles down.</b>
<br><b>These things happen, day or night. Basement doors open and shut
by themselves and lights go on and off.</b>
<br><b>In the bedroom, one of her sons was pinned against the bed under
an invisible force and held for several minutes. The area&lt; call the
"core" is the bedroom on the second floor and the kitchen directly under
it, and in the area beneath that in the basement.</b>
<br><b>Last week, I was poked in the side as I stood at the cupboard making
coffee.....The man appeared that same night in the basement and stared
at me, then drifted into the wall.</b>
<br><b>He&nbsp; appears to be about 6' tall, wears old dark to brown clothes
and has dark hair. His features&nbsp; are not recognizable. Any Ideas?</b><b></b>

<br><b>Valentines Day</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LaLadyDe@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story starts when I was 13 months old on Valentine's Day. My mother
was in</b>
<br><b>the car with my father and they were coming across railroad tracks,
my father</b>
<br><b>was going to fast and wrecked into a telephone pole and my mother
went</b>
<br><b>through the windshield decapitating her.&nbsp; My sisters tell me
(they are 10 to</b>
<br><b>12 years older than I) that I woke up and started screaming and
I would not</b>
<br><b>stop till my father came home from the hospital hours later, he
only suffered</b>
<br><b>scratches.</b>
<br><b>Three and a half years later I was sitting in my bed and I felt
a chill, a</b>
<br><b>transparent woman appeared before me, I was not scared, she was
familiar, but</b>
<br><b>I did not know her, (I believe it was my mother), she never said
anything</b>
<br><b>just looked at me with sad eyes.&nbsp; Not soon after my father
was shot in the</b>
<br><b>back by a corrupt police officer, (he only got 6 months suspension)
and now I</b>
<br><b>had no parents at all. I was sent to an awful place in WV with my
aunt and</b>
<br><b>uncle, they were cruel people. My cousins locked me in the cellar
with a</b>
<br><b>coffin telling me my dad was in there and they were going to raise
him from</b>
<br><b>the dead! I wanted my father back, I still had memory of him. They
blew the</b>
<br><b>candle out and ran for the door and locked me in. I woke up hours
later in</b>
<br><b>shock. I always felt like I was being watched and I never felt like
I was</b>
<br><b>totally alone. When I was 9 I started seeing people in my room and
out of the</b>
<br><b>corner of my eyes every time I tried to capture a straight on look
at them</b>
<br><b>they went away. Until I was 12. I started going to church on a regular
basis</b>
<br><b>and became a fanatic Christian, the whole world needed saved. I
was at a</b>
<br><b>prayer meeting in my aunts house and I saw a dark shadow pass by
the door, I</b>
<br><b>thought it was my cousin Rusty, I loved him very much and he just
had gotten</b>
<br><b>out of the army. So I left the room went to the kitchen, and the
light came</b>
<br><b>on. There was no one by the light switch! I looked at the backdoor
and it was</b>
<br><b>chained from the inside, he could not have left that way, I went
and stood by</b>
<br><b>the counter, and a cold icy feeling went from the top of my head
down to my</b>
<br><b>feet, I passed out. I awoke to my Uncle putting olive oil on my
forehead, I</b>
<br><b>looked to the right (I was laying in the floor still) and I saw
all the</b>
<br><b>prayer meeting people looking at me in fear, I felt powerful! But
I also felt</b>
<br><b>sick and scared. I was told I had a black unidentifiable creature
sitting on</b>
<br><b>me with its talon like hands around my throat, I was scared half
to death at</b>
<br><b>this point! I went into the living room and my Aunt picked up the
phone and</b>
<br><b>called a pastor, she said nothing on the phone but hello my name
is Joan then</b>
<br><b>she looked at me and said OK thank you and hung up. She told us
all that he</b>
<br><b>already knew what was going on and he was on his way over. At the
time I did</b>
<br><b>not find that out of the ordinary. When he arrived he walked up
to me and</b>
<br><b>said you are feared, you "were" supposed to be a great youth leader,
that I</b>
<br><b>have lost my faith and I was letting them win, he said the creature
was still</b>
<br><b>there and would always be with me and there will be more to always
keep me</b>
<br><b>suppressed. I was sobbing! He said it went up to the attic, and
he pulled the</b>
<br><b>stairs down, started climbing and said go back to the pits of hell
were you</b>
<br><b>belong, I swear his veins looked like they were about to pop from
his neck</b>
<br><b>and his face was purple. I did not want to sleep up there ever again!
But</b>
<br><b>like I said I had a very cruel Aunt and Uncle. I slept (when I did
sleep) up</b>
<br><b>there for around 2 weeks, when I felt the presence of it, I turned
my head to</b>
<br><b>face the wall, and covered my head with the sheet, I heard and felt
the</b>
<br><b>flapping of "its" wings and it was huge! It blew the sheet up like
a tent and</b>
<br><b>blew my long hair across my face. I ran away from WV after that
and moved in</b>
<br><b>with my sister.</b>
<br><b>My sister has a five year old son, He slept with his mother and
I slept on</b>
<br><b>the couch. I started going to school there and made new friends.
Johnny (my 5</b>
<br><b>year old nephew) got up one morning and at the breakfast table said
"Who was</b>
<br><b>your friend that was here last night." I told him I did not have
a friend</b>
<br><b>come over, my sister was angry that I had company! He said it was
a black man</b>
<br><b>with a bone sticking out of his head and he was watching me sleep!
He said he</b>
<br><b>got scared and got back in bed with his Mom. I got in trouble for
having a</b>
<br><b>friend over! My family has since seen it while I have been sleeping,
I have</b>
<br><b>many nightmares, I rarely shut my eyes without one. My sister in
law saw it</b>
<br><b>by her babies crib and thought we had a burglar, It touched my niece
on the</b>
<br><b>forehead, and to this day she gets a perfectly round sore on her
forehead</b>
<br><b>every year. I still sense it and I still see them out of the corner
of my</b>
<br><b>eyes. I have had mentally disabled people go crazy and start pointing
above</b>
<br><b>my head and start screaming and shouting, (One kept saying kiki
kiki over and</b>
<br><b>over again) I have had dogs look up at a blank wall and begin whimpering,
I</b>
<br><b>am a kind very giving, and happy person! I am in no way evil. I

<p><b>Time Warp</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: karentt@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early this morning, at 1:30 am, while surfing
the internet and</b>
<br><b>listening to the radio, I began to get this odd feeling (chills)
that</b>
<br><b>was not the kind you would get from being cold, but&nbsp; rather
fright.</b>
<br><b>There was&nbsp; no reason for this feeling, but it happened. Within
a minute,</b>
<br><b>the radio stopped its broadcast and a very odd sound began "surfacing"</b>
<br><b>through the speakers. It sounded like water&nbsp; moving inside&nbsp;
a huge</b>
<br><b>cavernous tank . The sound became stronger - but there was no static
or</b>
<br><b>buzz that is usually heard wihen intereference&nbsp; is responsible.&nbsp;
I never</b>
<br><b>heard this typeof sound before. I got up to check and see if the</b>
<br><b>receiver was okay, and began to hear a distant voice mixed in with
these</b>
<br><b>odd sounds - I thought it was a radio broadcast, or even a phone
call</b>
<br><b>transmitted over the airwaves. But it wasn't. I then heard my name</b>
<br><b>spoken in a womans voice say "Tony....Tony....Tony, I hear you."
I knew</b>
<br><b>immediately that it was the voice of my grandmother who passed away
in</b>
<br><b>August 1999.&nbsp; There was no doubt about that being her voice.&nbsp;
Over the</b>
<br><b>last year I've been asking her to give me a sign that she knows
I'm</b>
<br><b>thinking about her (since I don't like visiting her grave), but
I never</b>
<br><b>expected this! I did not imagine her voice (that I know), yet it
made me</b>
<br><b>quite upset. I even woke my fiance up and had her hear this sound
on the</b>
<br><b>radio (though the voice was gone).&nbsp; What's odd is that when
this all</b>
<br><b>took place, I had the distinct feeling as if everything&nbsp; around&nbsp;
me was</b>
<br><b>"off" balance, and like I was not&nbsp; physically in that room
for a brief</b>
<br><b>moment. The whole incident took perhaps 30 or 40 seconds before
the</b>
<br><b>radio broadcast came back on, yet its been bothering me all day
like you</b>
<br><b>would not believe. Have you ever heard of anything similar to what

<br><b>The Old Wooden Bridge</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Beshearsitstrue@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I first learned about this story when I was in third grade. From
a girl named</b>
<br><b>Teresa.She was always sort of strange-but nice.I had to sit next
to her in a</b>
<br><b>class.She would always tell these stories about how her house is
haunted,and</b>
<br><b>there is something in her house thats trying to kill her.Everyone
in the</b>
<br><b>class never believed her and always just laughed at her.I was always
nice to</b>
<br><b>her,and I sort of felt sorry for her.We were only in third grade,and
I would</b>
<br><b>always wounder how she knew all of the things she did about ghosts.So
one day</b>
<br><b>I asked her about what was going on in her house,She started off
by telling</b>
<br><b>me about one of her family members,and how she was a witch.And this
lady</b>
<br><b>lived with Teresa for a while.As soon as she moved in,things started
to</b>
<br><b>happen in her house.Teresa said she had a water bed.And one night,she
had</b>
<br><b>walked in her room,and her bed started to move on one corner.Like
someone had</b>
<br><b>sat down on the corner of her bed.Darts would fly across the room,and
hit the</b>
<br><b>bullseye of the dartboard.The lamp would come on,and it would not
be plugged</b>
<br><b>in.Her rocking chair would rock,and no one would be in it.Then she
said that</b>
<br><b>erone thing really scared her.A butcher knife came off of the table,and
stuck</b>
<br><b>in the wall right by her head.By that point,I was really scared,but
I had</b>
<br><b>never had any expiriences like that.Well really i didn't believe
her.But I</b>
<br><b>couldn't wounder why she would lie about things like that.The lady
that lived</b>
<br><b>with Teresa and&nbsp; her mom,would read black magis bibles,and
all sorts of</b>
<br><b>things.The lady also had a quoija board,and she used it to talk
to demons.It</b>
<br><b>had gotten out of hand one time,and she tried to throw it away.She
put it in</b>
<br><b>the trash outside.The next morning,it was on her dresser.She tried
again.The</b>
<br><b>same thing happend.Then she tried to burn it.It would not burn.Teresa
said it</b>
<br><b>scarred the lady so bad,the lady started to read the real bible
and go to</b>
<br><b>church.Whatever was in Teresa's house did not like that.One night.Teresa's</b>
<br><b>house caught on fire.Only a part of it was messed up.It was fixable.The
lady</b>
<br><b>knew that whatever was in that house was very angry,so she moved
because she</b>
<br><b>is the one that made it come,so she thought if she left,it would</b>
<br><b>too.Well,Teresa said it did not leave,infact it stayed there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also said that she lived in a secluded area.By
a old wooden</b>
<br><b>bridge.She had some horses,and her and her mother would ride down
to the</b>
<br><b>bridge all of the time.It had been there for many years,and it had
an old</b>
<br><b>creek bottem underneth it.She said that the people that built it
lived nearby</b>
<br><b>it along time ago.It was a man and a woman.The man would go stand
on the edge</b>
<br><b>of the bridge and fish off of it.One day,it had rained alot.When
the rain</b>
<br><b>stopped,the man went to fish.The water was so swift,that it pulled
him and</b>
<br><b>his fishing pole in the water.He was never seen again and no one
found his</b>
<br><b>body.His wife was so sad,that she went to the bridge every day and
would just</b>
<br><b>yell out his name.Even into the night she would get her lantern,and
serch up</b>
<br><b>and down the creek bottom for him.Finally after years of serching,she
went</b>
<br><b>crazy,and was put into a hospital.Later she died.Teresa said to
this day,you</b>
<br><b>can still go down to the bridge at night and if it is starting to
get</b>
<br><b>dark,look into the trees in the creek bottom,and you can see a tiny
light</b>
<br><b>from a distance,getting closer and closer.Teresa said when she seen
the light</b>
<br><b>comeing,it was time to go,because it was the old woman looking for
her</b>
<br><b>husband with her light.She might think that you are him and take
you with her</b>

<p><b>By: theopancheri@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been interested in supernatural phenomena for as long as I
can remember.&nbsp; Maybe it has something to do with my birthday falling
on Halloween-who knows, anyways...I've had my share of experiences but
I'll start out with my earlier experiences...My best friend Jen and I have
been good friends since 1st grade and were inseparable throughout our childhood.&nbsp;
Her family moved into a house right across the field from my house when
we were in middle school.&nbsp; When she moved in the little boy that previously
lived there warned her that it was haunted.&nbsp; We didn't really think
much of what he said until we saw for ourselves. Jen &amp; I were home
alone one afternoon and we decided to play with the ouija board in her
bathroom(it was the darkest room in the house)when all of a sudden it got
very chilly in there.&nbsp; We left the bathroom to see what was up and
found that every door in her house was wide open-all of&nbsp; the cupboards,
the oven, the doors(the front, back and side door), closets-every single
one of them.&nbsp; Jen &amp; I went outside to get some air and figured
there was no possible way for someone to sneak into her house and play
that prank on us. We were only in the bathroom for a few minutes when we
noticed the temperature drop and also it was an older house and it seems
like we would have at least heard the doors opening but that wasn't the
case.&nbsp; When we used to babysit Jen's little sister we would have the
baby monitor on because her bedroom was upstairs. This was when her sister
was 2/3-we could hear her sister carrying on conversations with someone-the
voices sounded as if they were whispering &amp; every time we would make
a mad dash to her bedroom to see who was in there and her sister would
be sound asleep, but either the rocking chair would still be moving or
a music box would suddenly start playing-it made our hair stand on end-you
could feel energy in her house-if that makes any sense.&nbsp; When wierd
things happened it was as if our bodies anticipated it before anything
happened-her house had a life of it's own. One more thing before I wrap
this up, Jen &amp; I decided to start leaving a tape recorder running at
night down in the basement when everyone was sleeping then we would play
it back the next day to see if we heard anything peculiar. The reason we
chose the basement was because we heard loud noises(banging, thumping,
crashing) coming from there on various occasions and also no one in her
family ever went down there so we knew our data would not be biased. Some
of the things we recorded included a man's voice(no men live in this house)saying
"oh boy, look what we've got here"-it was drawn out with exageration, the
voice became shrill as if it was pleasantly suprised but hiding the suprise
with sarcasm(am I making sense?) Also-we heard a low gutteral growl on
another occasion-this sounded like it was very angry.&nbsp; I have many
more experiences to share (I haven't even gotten to what took place at
my home) so I'm sure everyone will be hearing from me again:).</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Shaking Bed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: julie21@alltel.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my story I would like t tell involves my grandparents home which
is over 100 years old. As far as I know of I know that a older woman was
violintly murdered here. But our ghost has never bothered anyone but me
and in 1 instance my fiance. i will start off by the first things that
started happening . After my kind hearted grandfather let this man named
Mike move in the house took on a new feeling. A feeling that was very uneasy.
I started feeling scared in the house when I have never felt that way before.
It even got mean. Oneday me and my papa was here by our selfs , he was
on the porch drinking his coffe and I was in my bedroom hooking up my speakers
when we heard this big boom. I came running through the house thinking
that my papa had fell. he in return was comming to see if I was okay he
thought that I had fell. well we met at the entrance of the houce and we
both decided to go to his bedroom to see what it was that we heard when
we got there we found my picture lying face up and the frame was completlely
broke in all directions.And my face was cut up really bad in the picture.
That really scared me so I woulden't go in there for a long time unless&nbsp;
papa was with me. The reason it scared me was because the picture could
not have fell out without knocking everything else down. It was in the
very back, my brother and sisters pictures was on either side o mine and
there were nicknacks infront of them all. There are sides on either side
and a railing in front to prevent anything from falling and braking.For
a while nothing&nbsp; else happened until my grandfather past away and
me and my fiance moved in. Something inside me pulled me to move into my
papas room. So we did. After the first night things started again. First
the room would stay cold and then the uneasy feeling then came the worst
of all.........................my bed would go to shaking and my fiance
would not feel it. it would continue over and over no matter what I did.
Rene would say I was going crazy because he did not feel it and I almost
thought I was too. Then one day Rene was in the bed sleeping in late and
the bed started shaking. He felt it he went outside and stayed all day
long untill I came home from work and he told me what happened. Well I
still did not understand why I felt it at night and he couldn't so one
night I was called by a seer and that is when I found out why. The reason
was because the ghoust was almost in me shaking me not the bed. This scared
me alot. And after this it got worse and wose. One night it like to have
drove me insane and I screemed at the top of my lungs to just quit. I was
tired of it. well it did for a couple of minutes and started again so I
talked my fiance into getting up and turning on the light.Thank god it
quit for the night. It does this alot along with a few other little teasing
things. If you have any advice for me I would appreacaite it. If you would
like to switch a few other storys you can connteact me at&nbsp;&nbsp; julie21@alltel.net</b><b></b>

<br><b>Missed a Step</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: FBGURL@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello...&nbsp; What I am about to tell you is the absolute truth.
It happened</b>
<br><b>in 1998.&nbsp; I was dancing in my bedroom which is located in the
basement</b>
<br><b>of a house that was built in 1945, and in the middle of my routine
I</b>
<br><b>felt and eary presense among me.&nbsp; You know the feeling taht
someone or</b>
<br><b>something that you can't see is right beside you. When I stopped
I told</b>
<br><b>myself not to turn around but my reactions to it, I turned and as
I</b>
<br><b>turned I was hit in the face and knocked on the floor.&nbsp; I got
up, ran to</b>
<br><b>the next door neighbors where my mom was, and as soon as I walked
in she</b>
<br><b>knew something was wrong. She told me that I was as white as a ghost.</b>
<br><b>Nothing like that ever happened before and hasn't happened again
but</b>
<br><b>every once in a while I can feel that same eary feeling, but now
I just</b>
<br><b>leave the room.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Fathers Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: diana@dicarinc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I believe that my Father's ghost visited me on two occasions not
long after his death.&nbsp; My Father died in January, 1998, in my parents'
home quite suddenly.&nbsp; I loved my Father very much.</b>
<br><b>Three weeks after his death, I was spending the night at my parent's
home.&nbsp; I woke up in the middle of the night feeling cold.&nbsp; I
felt someone put an extra blanket over me.&nbsp; In the morning I thanked
my Mom for coming in and covering me with an extra blanket.&nbsp; She denied
getting up in the night and coming in my room as well as putting an extra
blanket on me.&nbsp; When she checked my room, the spare blanket that she
usually keeps in the hall closet was on my bed.&nbsp; I distinctly remember
feeling someone put this blanket on me.</b>
<br><b>The next experience I had was when I again spent the night at my
Mom's home.&nbsp; I asked her to wake me at 7:30 am.&nbsp; At 7:40 am I
felt someone shake me awake.&nbsp; I remember saying "Okay, I'm awake."</b>
<br><b>Then my Mom came in my room and wanted to know what I had said.</b>
<br><b>I repeated that I said I was awake and thanked her for waking me.&nbsp;
She then told me that she didn't wake me.&nbsp; She knew that I had been
up late and was letting me sleep in.&nbsp; She hadn't been in my room at
all that morning.</b>
<br><b>Somehow I believe it has been my Father's ghost looking out for
me.</b>

<p><b>I'm not a Geography Major</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: simpspa@reynellaehs.sa.edu.au</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Just a quick story that someone reminded me of , hope&nbsp; you enjoy
it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Back when I was just a kid we used to go for walks down to
the old</b>
<br><b>cemetery. back then i lived on Kangaroo Island,(check the atlas.),
and this</b>
<br><b>had the oldest cemetery in the state.&nbsp; The ground is very wet
here in winter</b>
<br><b>as a creek runs through the middle and on cold wet nights we used
to go</b>
<br><b>looking for old coins and to watch the corpse lights from the subsided</b>
<br><b>graves,&nbsp; (basically just escaping gas, that would self ignite,
like in a</b>
<br><b>swamp.)&nbsp; This was all very scarey as a 12 year old.&nbsp; One
particular night we</b>
<br><b>decided to visit the cemeteries only vault, This was a large concrete
and</b>
<br><b>lime stone edifice with a pinned and bolted lid.&nbsp; When we got
there the lid</b>
<br><b>was of and a dry musty smell exuded from the crypt.&nbsp; we dared
each other to</b>
<br><b>shine our torches in the hole, when someone finally did he wet himself....</b>
<br><b>laughing&nbsp; someone had removed the coffin and place a blow up
doll in its</b>
<br><b>place.&nbsp; The doll was dressed up like our year seven teacher.
Right down to</b>
<br><b>the twin set, pearls and&nbsp; the wart on the nose.</b>
<br><b>This was all fine and well, but soon an uneasy feeling came over
the group</b>
<br><b>and we started to get a little nervous and on edge.&nbsp; The wind
had dropped</b>
<br><b>and yet the pine trees were hissing, a soft green light started
to come from</b>
<br><b>the vault and the lid began to close, by itself, it must have weighed
200kg.</b>
<br><b>Needsless to say the 100metres was covered in less that 10 seconds
that</b>
<br><b>night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The disturbance made the local paper. as that night there
were unexplained</b>
<br><b>power outages and the two teenagers, guys i went to school with,
(4 years</b>
<br><b>older) were badly injured in a car accident, the smashed coffin
found in the</b>
<br><b>back of their pickup.&nbsp; We all thought they'd been drinking,
which they had .</b>
<br><b>But they claimed that an old woman dressed in old fashioned clothing
had</b>
<br><b>stepped in front of the truck and the driver swerved to avoid her.
That how</b>
<br><b>they ended up in the ditch.......</b>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Night Terrors</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: StephNWaylon30@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>ok i have what is called night terrors, not just regular night mares
, i act</b>
<br><b>out my dreams , in most cases i am fighting someone that is hurting
me but</b>
<br><b>its not me that i see its someone else that is being hurt. but i
feel their</b>
<br><b>pain and its me inside fighting the person enflicting the pain.
And later</b>
<br><b>down the road i can see the person and describe him or her down
to the tee .</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; And I dont know how to explain this but these dreams are
real i have heard</b>
<br><b>of some of them on the news, that i have dreamed about a few weeks
or days</b>
<br><b>before it happens to them...&nbsp; i have had that since i was 5
years old.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>dont sleep well at night cause of this also if i sleep during the
day like a</b>
<br><b>nap or something i dont have any bad dreams. Alot of times these
dreams are</b>
<br><b>worse than a scary movie.&nbsp; And sometimes when someone thinks
i am awake i am</b>
<br><b>still asleep when they try to wake me and i start hitting them with
my fist</b>
<br><b>and cussing them and calling them by another name other than their
own. (and</b>
<br><b>not a cuss word either )&nbsp; My husband has waken up a few times
with me on his</b>
<br><b>chest beating him in the face. And the glass that was on our water
bed i</b>
<br><b>have knocked out with my fist and i would wake up the next morning
with glass on</b>
<br><b>my hand and blood and glass in my hair and in the bed from me knocking
it</b>
<br><b>out and never waking up .&nbsp; Ok on to another thing that has
happened. One night</b>
<br><b>about three months ago my husband and i were in bed about to go
to sleep and</b>
<br><b>i felt like i was starting to drift and my husband fell asleep pretty
fast</b>
<br><b>well, i could still hear the radio that sits on our headboard of
our</b>
<br><b>waterbed,&nbsp; and i never sleep on my back so i was starting to
turn over</b>
<br><b>before i fell asleep and all of a sudden i couldnt move i could
talk or scream, i</b>
<br><b>felt like i couldnt breath like someone was sitting on my chest
, and i seen</b>
<br><b>a dark shadow at the foot of my bed it scared me and i had this
terrified</b>
<br><b>feeling rush over me i wanted to run, i really thought i was asleep
and</b>
<br><b>having another night terror , but i could still hear the radio and
see the</b>
<br><b>bedroom and hear my husband snoring, and for some reason i got everything</b>
<br><b>back in control and was screaming which woke up my husband out of
a deep</b>
<br><b>sleep, and he jumped up scared half to death, he grabed me asking
me what</b>
<br><b>was wrong and i told him what happened and it freaked him out which
i dont blame</b>
<br><b>him one bit i was terrified.&nbsp; I have never had another thing
like that</b>
<br><b>happen to me ever again. But when i looked at the clock when i clamed
down from all</b>
<br><b>of this commotion we went to bed at 10:00 pm. and it was 11:47pm.
so i guess</b>
<br><b>this went on for awhile i'm not sure...... there are so many things.
I hope</b>
<br><b>you dont think i am crazy, i have even went to a doctor thinking
i was a nut</b>
<br><b>and was diagnosied with the night terrors when i was a child my
mother took</b>
<br><b>me.... And if you want to know more just let me know.</b><b></b>

<br><b>More of My Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aphroditie25@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A little while back I sent you a stories about one of the many</b>
<br><b>experiences I have had. Now I would like to tell you as much as
I can</b>
<br><b>about the others. I will start with the house we use to live in
when I</b>
<br><b>was about 8 or 9.This house is in west brookfield mass.It was haunted
by</b>
<br><b>a poltergeist I belive. I remember very few things about this house.
I</b>
<br><b>think I blocked most of it from my memory because it wasn't a good
thing.</b>
<br><b>I remember waking up in the middle of the night feeling as if someone
was</b>
<br><b>standing over me looking at me sleep. I had and till recently having
a</b>
<br><b>more opened mind these days passed it off as a dream. One night
I</b>
<br><b>remember waking up seeing someone there and they disappeared then
the</b>
<br><b>rocking chair near the end of my bed started rocking. My room was
in what</b>
<br><b>the dining room would be so it was between the living room and</b>
<br><b>kitchen,the kitchen being off to the side. I also remember waking
up one</b>
<br><b>night to the radio changing stations(all my brothers where sleeping
with</b>
<br><b>me also).We screamed for my mom and dad to come see and my mom picked
up</b>
<br><b>the cord saying it was impossible because it was unplugged. My brother</b>
<br><b>remember more then I do about that house. My dad won't even talk
about</b>
<br><b>it. I remember one time we got my mom to tell us a few things that</b>
<br><b>happened to my dad like waking up hearing what seemed like a party
going</b>
<br><b>on in the kitchen the light on and all he go checked when he got
in there</b>
<br><b>the light be off and nothing in there. Also my mom told us that
his lunch</b>
<br><b>box would fly at him like someone was throwing it. He recently told
my</b>
<br><b>fiance that it was a women. Then we moved to a house in Worcester,My</b>
<br><b>brothers say that was haunted I don't remember anything happening
there</b>
<br><b>expect a bunch of bad luck. We moved once more from there to another</b>
<br><b>apartment in Worcester. That place wasn't haunted. I lived there
with my</b>
<br><b>parents till I was 17 on the 3d floor then I moved to the basement,then
I</b>
<br><b>moved out to live with my ex-boyfriend.Then I moved into the second
floor</b>
<br><b>when I got pregnant with my daughter with my now exhusband where
he lives</b>
<br><b>with&nbsp; my kids. I now live with my fiance in sturbridge.This
house is</b>
<br><b>haunted .Nothing big happens just things disappear after you find
them</b>
<br><b>maybe a few minutes later to sometimes days or weeks later in spots
you</b>
<br><b>looked for them about 100 times before. I also belive my daughter
has</b>
<br><b>part of my grandmother with her. She passed away about 2 years before
I</b>
<br><b>had her. My grandmother loved elephants she had a huge collection
of</b>
<br><b>elephants when she passed away. Well ever since my daughter has
been able</b>
<br><b>to point at what toy she wanted she point to the stuffed elephants
to</b>
<br><b>this day we still buy elephants for her shes five now. I belive
my son</b>
<br><b>who is going to be 3 is able to see ghosts. Every since he was born
he</b>
<br><b>talk to things that weren't there and stare at something we can't
see he</b>
<br><b>biggest thing was when I was living with my ex-husband in the apartment</b>
<br><b>he still lives in the one I mentioned early. The place was never
haunted</b>
<br><b>l;like I stated before but right after my son was born I feel as
if</b>
<br><b>someone was in the bedroom they (both my kids) slept in when he
wake in</b>
<br><b>the middle of the night I felt someone watching over my shoulder.
The</b>
<br><b>most recent thing that happen that makes me belive this was a weekend
he</b>
<br><b>was staying with me. I was sleeping and my fiance woke up to hear
him</b>
<br><b>fussing a bit so he was just listen to see if he was going to have
to</b>
<br><b>wake me up to go get him.Wjhen he says he heard clicks over the
monitor</b>
<br><b>and Chris saying vrrmm vrmm(he LOVES his cars) and the toys rolling</b>
<br><b>across the floor as if he was playing with them. The strange thing
about</b>
<br><b>that is that Chris would NEVER get out of that bed in the middle
of the</b>
<br><b>night without crying for me and I know that for a fact. So we just</b>
<br><b>figured it was our ghost playing with him. She loves my son. I just
let</b>
<br><b>her play as long as she doesn't hurt him or scare him. I think thats</b>
<br><b>about it sorry it was so long thanks for listening.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Someone's here to visit....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: denise.fernandez@csfb.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Eight years ago in May my dad had passed away from a brain tumor
that had</b>
<br><b>caused brain cancer.&nbsp; My mother, brother and I mourned greatly
for the first</b>
<br><b>year&nbsp; after his death.&nbsp; On May 13, 1993, the anniversary
date of my dad's</b>
<br><b>death we began to get visits from what we believe to be my dad's
spirit.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have always been fascinated by the supernatural, watching movies
and reading</b>
<br><b>things on the supernatural but in everything I have ever read they
always</b>
<br><b>state that spirits come because they are unrested and are trying
to make</b>
<br><b>peace with what ever is causing this restlessness.&nbsp; I don't
believe that</b>
<br><b>anymore.</b>
<br><b>On the morning of his one year anniversary, my mom had awaken in
a cold</b>
<br><b>sweat.&nbsp; When I realized she had been in her bed crying I asked
her if she</b>
<br><b>was ok.&nbsp; That's when she told me that she had a dream and in
the dream my</b>
<br><b>dad was there but he wasn't speaking.&nbsp; My mother was trying
to hug him but</b>
<br><b>every time she got closer, he got further away till she began running
after</b>
<br><b>him and he was running away from her.&nbsp; Now in order to understand
the scary</b>
<br><b>part, on the opposite side of the bed where my dad use to sleep
is a picture</b>
<br><b>of my parents.&nbsp; When my mom woke-up from this dream (that she
explains was</b>
<br><b>so real) the picture was on the end table on her side of the bed
facing her.</b>
<br><b>When she opened her eyes there was the picture sitting in front
of her as if</b>
<br><b>someone had placed it there.&nbsp; This was the first of the happenings.</b>
<br><b>Months had passed and we had all gotten back into our everyday routines.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>had been washing dishes in the kitchen when my mind started to wander.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>began to think about my dad and how much I wished he were alive.&nbsp;
When I was</b>
<br><b>startled by the night light that was plugged into the socket near
the sink.</b>
<br><b>The light has a switch that you have to click in order for the light
to go</b>
<br><b>on &amp; off.&nbsp; Well the switch had click on by itself as through
my dad was</b>
<br><b>trying to let me know that he was there.&nbsp; I didn't touch the
light but I</b>
<br><b>stood there staring at it thinking maybe the electricity was going
wacky but</b>
<br><b>in the three minutes that I stayed staring at it, I watched the
switch turn</b>
<br><b>itself off.&nbsp; It was the most breathtaking moment of my life,
I didn't know</b>
<br><b>if I was frightened or just in shock of what I had just witnessed.</b><b></b>
<p><b>More and more things began to happen but at times when we were thinking</b>
<br><b>about him.&nbsp; I began to call his name when the things were happening
to see</b>
<br><b>if he could respond to me, but I never saw him nor heard a sound.&nbsp;
One late</b>
<br><b>afternoon when I had come home from school, I was watching TV in
my</b>
<br><b>livingroom (mind you my house is old and not very big) I was the
only person</b>
<br><b>home at the time when, as if I where in a movie theater, a blaring
sound</b>
<br><b>came from all within the house.&nbsp; I quickly turned off the TV
I was watching</b>
<br><b>wondering what in the heck was the noise.&nbsp; As I walked through
the house,</b>
<br><b>every TV that we have was on to the same channel I was watching.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>like someone waked through the house and put every single TV on.&nbsp;
This time</b>
<br><b>I was scared because I hadn't been thinking of my dad and it just
happened</b>
<br><b>so suddenly.&nbsp; The rest of the afternoon I stayed at my friends
house waiting</b>
<br><b>for my mom to get home.</b>
<br><b>My brother also had experienced something similar.&nbsp; He had
been home alone</b>
<br><b>in his bedroom when all of a sudden every door in the house slammed
shut as</b>
<br><b>if a huge wind came blowing through and slammed every door closed.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>doors in my house are those old, thick, heavy wood doors that in
order to</b>
<br><b>close them you have to slam them and the funny part is I remember
growing up</b>
<br><b>with my dad always yelling, "stopping slamming the doors when you
go into</b>
<br><b>your rooms".&nbsp; My brother was a little less scared then I would
have been if</b>
<br><b>I were home alone.</b>
<br><b>After a couple of years things stopped until recently about a year
ago.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>moved out of my moms house in 1998 but every time I go to visit
her I can</b>
<br><b>sense my dad still there.&nbsp; The main bathroom in the house is
right past my</b>
<br><b>mothers room and every time I go past the room from the corner of
my eye I</b>
<br><b>can see the TV light on and the figure of my dad lying in bed watching
it.</b>
<br><b>The funny part is that I can never see his face and if I stop to
long to</b>
<br><b>stare the apparition disappears and everything goes dark again.</b>
<br><b>Since all these things have happened I have come to believe that
my dad just</b>
<br><b>wants us to know that he has never left us mentally, his soul and
his</b>
<br><b>memories will always be with us.&nbsp; My dad suffered and was a
bed ridden</b>
<br><b>vegetable for nine months before he passed on.&nbsp; The doctors
had only given</b>
<br><b>him three months to live after he was critical and he lived in critical</b>
<br><b>condition for nine months longer than what they said, even his doctors
&amp;</b>
<br><b>nurses where shocked.&nbsp; The night that he died I remember before
leaving the</b>
<br><b>hospital my mom whispered in his ear, "you can let go now, we will
be ok,</b>
<br><b>you can let go", two hours later the hospital had called to tell
us he</b>
<br><b>passed away.&nbsp; I remember that single moment as if it were yesterday.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>experience has made be believe in things that other people think
is non</b>
<br><b>existing.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AngelSerena113@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night my friend Brittany stayed the night at my house.&nbsp;
My brother was in</b>
<br><b>Florida visting my cousins and my parents were out for the night
gambling.</b>
<br><b>They left around 9:00 p.m. and said they would probally be back
around 1:30</b>
<br><b>a.m.&nbsp; Me and Brittany were laying in my bedroom with all the
lights out and</b>
<br><b>about 10 of my candles lit talking.&nbsp; All of the sudden we heard
the front</b>
<br><b>door open and shut.&nbsp; We looked at the clock: it was only 10:30.&nbsp;
So we got up</b>
<br><b>and went out into the living room and no one was there, so we went
out into</b>
<br><b>the driveway and garage and no cars were there.&nbsp; So we decided
that maybe we</b>
<br><b>were just hearing things so we went back inside, checked the whole
house to</b>
<br><b>see if anyone was there, locked all the doors, and turned out the
lights.</b>
<br><b>But when we went back into my bed room all the candles had been
blown out.</b>
<br><b>We started getting really freaked out so we just decided that we
would go to</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; Around 11:00 we heard things falling and shattering from
the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>We were to scared to go into the kitchen so I grabbed the house
keys and we</b>
<br><b>climbed out the window.&nbsp; We walked around the house and opened
the side door</b>
<br><b>to the kitchen.&nbsp; When we turned on the lights pots and pans
were scattered</b>
<br><b>all over the floor and the faucet was going.&nbsp; We cleaned up
the mess, locked</b>
<br><b>all the doors and went back into my room and went to bed.&nbsp;
The next morning</b>
<br><b>at breakfast my mom asked me and Brittany how'd we get into her
bedroom while</b>
<br><b>she was gone.&nbsp; (My mom locks her doors when she leaves and
is the only one</b>
<br><b>with the key)&nbsp; Me and Brittany told her we didnt know what
she was talking</b>
<br><b>about.&nbsp; My mom then said that when she got home earlier that
morning around</b>
<br><b>2:00 her bed sheets were sprawled out all over the floor, and the
shower was</b>
<br><b>going.&nbsp; The weird thing is is that her windows were locked
and so was her</b>
<br><b>bedrom door and the door was locked when she opened it so someone
or</b>
<br><b>something had gotten into her room withou using the window or door.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Sleep Problems</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Gene_Maple-P13047@email.mot.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened to me when I was very young. I was just starting to
fall</b>
<br><b>asleep in my bed when I realized I couldnt move. I could blink my
eyes but</b>
<br><b>not move my body. I then could see shadowy figures moving around
in my room</b>
<br><b>and they seemed to sense I could see them as they stopped and seemed
to be</b>
<br><b>looking at me. I was very terrified and wanted to scream but couldnt</b>
<br><b>move....at this time I sensed something behind me and could see
out of the</b>
<br><b>corner of my eye a mans? hand with an enourmous ring onit. I could
also see</b>
<br><b>the arm which was dressed in a pinstripe suite. I couldnt take it
any more</b>
<br><b>and struggled to come out of this. I then was able to move and all
the</b>
<br><b>shadowy figures and arm faded away but the other items in my room
didnt.</b>
<br><b>Wierd!</b>

around but</b>
<br><b>never blinked and the dark figure just stood there then i moved
to get up and</b>
<br><b>blinked and when i looked back at the door he was gone. I then yelled
out</b>
<br><b>"dad!" to see if it was my dad but i got no answer so the next morning
i</b>
<br><b>asked my dad if he got up to check on me in the middle of the night
and he</b>
<br><b>said he never got up. well a couple of weeks later i kept haveing
horrible</b>
<br><b>dreams about a girl but i couldn't see her face. well one night

<br><b>&nbsp;Neighborhood Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: margiator@budweiser.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Let me start out by saying that these stories aren't meant to sound
cheesey.</b>
<br><b>They are truly all real.&nbsp; This may sound stupid, but it's true.
My neighborhood</b>
<br><b>was built on an Indian battlefield. There's even a small monument
for it so if</b>
<br><b>you skeptics don't believe me, come take a look. There have been
several</b>
<br><b>encounters at my house as well as a house up the street. I've never
asked anyone</b>
<br><b>else so I can't speak for the rest of my neighbors.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets start out at my house. Our basement level
isn't one of those scary</b>
<br><b>places because used all the time. I even have a room down there.
One time I was</b>
<br><b>down there on the phone with my friend watching TV. All of a sudden
my TV went</b>
<br><b>off for no reason. Then it came back on. Then it went off again.
No other</b>
<br><b>appliances were doing this so I knew it wasn't a power surge.&nbsp;
I was so scared</b>
<br><b>that I hung up on my friend and jetted up the stairs without looking
back. A few</b>
<br><b>days later I finally got the courage to go back down there. My TV
was back on.</b>
<br><b>Another time, as I was coming upstairs from the basement, I turned
the corner</b>
<br><b>and saw a figure going up to the 3rd floor. I only saw the back
on the person</b>
<br><b>and they were on the top step. They ran up it and turned to go down
the hall.</b>
<br><b>Figuring it was my Dad (since I could see my mother in the kitchen
but not him)</b>
<br><b>I shrugged it off. When I got in the kitchen, there was Dad sitting
at the</b>
<br><b>table. So then I thought that it was my little sister, until I saw
her on the</b>
<br><b>computer. I immediately told my Mom about what I had seen and she
explained to</b>
<br><b>me that I was not the first person to see it. She said that she
and my older</b>
<br><b>brother had both seen it before.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now as far as my neighbor's house, the
spirit has never been seen.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>friend Shea (at the time about 28) was living there with her 5 year
old son,</b>
<br><b>Tyler.&nbsp; She was a single parent and one night her boyfriend
Clark was staying</b>
<br><b>over. Everyone was asleep when a noise woke Shea up. It continued
and so she</b>
<br><b>woke Clark up. He got the gun and went downstairs. There in the
floor was one of</b>
<br><b>Tyler's wind up toys that had been sitting on the table all day.
Somehow it had</b>
<br><b>gotten wound up and walked off the table. Shea also says that she
could always</b>
<br><b>hear people walking around. If she was downstairs, she could hear
them upstairs.</b>
<br><b>If she was upstairs, she could hear them downstairs. The current
owners of the</b>
<br><b>house claim that a statue in the upstairs hall will start shaking
for no</b>
<br><b>apparent reason. Freaky huh?</b>

<p><b>My Friends</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TomballPimp@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i have never really believed that i would ever see a ghost in my
life, but</b>
<br><b>here lately some weird things have been happening in my house.&nbsp;
im 18 and</b>
<br><b>just moved out to go to college. i live in college station texas.&nbsp;
about two</b>
<br><b>months ago i was out for my morning jog. i was thinking about the
big test</b>
<br><b>that i had that day.&nbsp; it was about 4 in the mornin (i have
class at 7, thats</b>
<br><b>why i was running so early), when i heard the voice of an older
man and it</b>
<br><b>said "Dont worry, you'll do just fine".&nbsp; i stopped dead in
my tracks and</b>
<br><b>looked around, noone was around.&nbsp; i thought i just made it
up.&nbsp; but then two</b>
<br><b>weeks later i was driving down my street coming home from a dance
hall at</b>
<br><b>about 1 in the morning, when i saw a small image of a girl playing
in my</b>
<br><b>front yard.&nbsp; but she was different, she was almost transparent
except for the</b>
<br><b>glow that surrounded her.&nbsp; when i pulled into the driveway,
she ran off into</b>
<br><b>the arms of an older man standing at the edge of the yard.&nbsp;
when i got out of</b>
<br><b>the car i heard his voice again and he sayed he was sorry for having</b>
<br><b>disturbing me so late.&nbsp; i tried to answer back by saying no
problem, but</b>
<br><b>before i could say anyhting they vanished before my eyes.&nbsp;
that was weird</b>
<br><b>enough for me so i woke up my roommate to tell him, he just thought
i was</b>
<br><b>crazy.&nbsp; then about a week later we began to hear a little girl
giggling in</b>
<br><b>the hallway between our rooms. my roommate even told me one night
that he</b>
<br><b>heard the voice of a man saying "Quiet honey, you'll wake them up".&nbsp;
he</b>
<br><b>thought it was burgalars so he went to investigate(with his baseball
bat).</b>
<br><b>when he got out into the hall, he saw a young girl with brown hair
and and a</b>
<br><b>green dress on running away from him.&nbsp; he chased after her
and when he got</b>
<br><b>into the living room, she was hiding behind the old man.&nbsp; my
roommate shouted</b>
<br><b>at them to stay there.&nbsp; the old man answered back "Im sorry
sir, Ashley didnt</b>
<br><b>mean to wake you", and they vanished again.&nbsp; he came and woke
me up and told</b>
<br><b>me the story, he began to believe my story from earlier.&nbsp; we
have now come to</b>
<br><b>welcome them into our house whenever they want.&nbsp; they dont
want to hurt us or</b>
<br><b>anything like that, they just wake us up when she plays.&nbsp; they
like to listen</b>
<br><b>to the radio and watch tv too.&nbsp; ive tried to talk to them but
when i go into</b>
<br><b>the room, they seem like they are scared that im mad they woke me
up, so he</b>
<br><b>apologizes and they leave.&nbsp; Come to find out later, about 20
years ago, an</b>
<br><b>old man was living in my house and he was watching his granddaughter
one</b>
<br><b>weekend.&nbsp; she was playing in the yard one day when she was
hit by a car, and</b>
<br><b>died.&nbsp; the old man couldnt live with himself so he shot himself
later the</b>
<br><b>same day.&nbsp; now jack(thats the name we gave him) and ashley
live in our house</b>
<br><b>and he always keep a close eye on her when she plays.&nbsp; we have
also noticed</b>
<br><b>things out of place often the morning after we here ashley in the
halls. the</b>
<br><b>newpaper has been opened to the crossword puzzles and the radio
has been</b>
<br><b>switched to am radio and is on the sports station.&nbsp; we have
left notes for</b>
<br><b>them on the crossword puzzles for him to read saying that we want
to talk to</b>
<br><b>him, but we never catch him. we are trying to help them crossover
but we have</b>
<br><b>no way of doing it.&nbsp; but we like ashley and jack and they are
welcome anytime</b>
<br><b>to play in the house and read our newspapers.</b>

<br><b>Maryland Haunting</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: PINKFLYD63@AOL.COM</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Maryland,Brookeville. My great aunt and uncle used to live in a old
house built in the time just before George Washing ton became president.At
the time the house was used as a jail.People who were convicted and sentenced
to death were hanged there and on many occasions were tortured and chained
in the basementwhere some of them died of their injuries.As far as I know
the leg and arm restraints are still hooked to the walls in the basement.I
have spent most of my life visiting my great aunt and uncle in this house
and I can tell you this,You can feel the unrest in this house as soon as
you walk in.As far as I can remember my Great aunt and uncles,uncles and
cousins who spent time growing up in this house have told me stories of
things that have happened there.More than one of my uncles have been awaken
with things tied around their throats choking them.I'm not talking just
something wrapped around their throats but tied in a knot.On one occasion
my great aunt was getting ready to come down stairs when a man appeared
at the bottom of the steps with a hangmans noose waving for her to come
down.She ran out of the house and to my cousins that lived up the street
and would'nt go back in the house untill my great uncle got home.She explained
the the man she had seen in the house was'nt just someone who came in off
the streets because she could see thru him.Only once did I stay in that
house over night.My great aunt knew that me and my brother were to scared
to sleep so in the middle of the night she came and checked on us(or so
we thought).The next morning we told her she scared us when she came into
the room to check on us and thats when she told us nobody had came in to
check on us and she would know because they would of had to came thru her
room to get in to ours.I could tell you more things that happened there
but i'll leave you with the last thing that I know of.Last year my great
uncle fell off a stool in the house and hit his head.This put my great
uncle in coma and after a couple of days the doctors told us he would probably
only live a couple of days at most.When my great aunt heard this she sat
down and within a few minutes had a heart attack and died within minutes.Some
how my uncle must of known this because only hours later he to died.After
the funeral a few of their grandchildren stopped by my great aunt and uncles,
they went inside for a while just to feel close with their grandparents.As
they were pulling out they took one last look at the house when they noticed
the curtains on the top floor pull to the side as if someone was looking
out at them and then the curtains fell closed.I know this may sound wild
but i'm 37 and have known and lived this since as long as I can remember.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp; My Ghost!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Superstar77811@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start off, I didn't believe in ghosts untill
I went to college. I went</b>
<br><b>to a small school in Iowa. For personal reasons I don't want to
give the</b>
<br><b>name. I have several stories I could tell, but I'm going to tell
about the</b>
<br><b>time I actually saw the ghost. I was an Resident Assistant at the
time of my</b>
<br><b>sighting. We had been having a lot of strange things happening on
the floor.</b>
<br><b>Many of the girls were scared out of their wits. I could only comfort
them by</b>
<br><b>saying that they wern't alone, a lot of things had been happening
to me also.</b>
<br><b>One night I was up late finishing a project. It was about four in
the morning</b>
<br><b>when I heard the sounds of footsteps and the swishing of warm-up
pants going</b>
<br><b>past my door up the hallway. One of my jobs was to write-up anyone
who snuck</b>
<br><b>guys in after hours. I was going to check to see if that was the
case, but I</b>
<br><b>decided not to. The moment I sat back down I heard it again coming
down the</b>
<br><b>hall. I decided to ignore it once again figuring I'd give whoever
it was a</b>
<br><b>break. I was sure they were sneaking a guy in or out. Just seconds
later I</b>
<br><b>heard it again, but this time it stopped around my door. I decided
to check</b>
<br><b>it out now because I figured they were scoping out wether I was
asleep or</b>
<br><b>not. I got up quietly and looked out my peephole figuring I'd see
who it was</b>
<br><b>and what they were doing. Right across from my room was they bathroom,
and</b>
<br><b>next to the bathroom was a big mirror hung in the hallway for the
girls to</b>
<br><b>check themselves out. So, when I look out the peephole I see a person
in the</b>
<br><b>mirror. I didn't recognize this girl at all, it was no one from
my floor. I</b>
<br><b>continued to look when I realized this girl had no legs, all she
had was this</b>
<br><b>misty fog. It was at this moment that I was looking at a ghost.
I could</b>
<br><b>describe her in every detail. I know that I wasn't seeing things.
If you or</b>
<br><b>anyone else would like to know more details or any of my other stories,</b>
<br><b>please feel free to e-mail me.</b>
