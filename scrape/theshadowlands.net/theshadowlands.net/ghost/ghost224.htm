<P><B>Haunting at Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: amanda@i-plus.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I just recently became interested in the supernatural and acquired
an open mind to the beings in that world.&nbsp; I am 16 years old and have
lived in my house for about 10 years.&nbsp; My home was built in 1840 and
possibly as early as 1790.&nbsp; The man that built the house was killed
a few years later by a runaway slave hiding in a cave, the man, Mr. Holmes,
left a widow and three daughters.&nbsp; Since the first day I have lived
here, my father and I have noticed unusual creaks, and my dad has seen
a shadowy figure at the top of the stairs outside my bedroom.&nbsp; I hear
whispers and a woman laughing occasionally as well as creaks when there
is no movement.&nbsp; A couple of months ago, my best friend and I were
taking pictures of each other in my bedroom, and when the pictures returned
we noticed what looks like an orb over my right shoulder.&nbsp; It was
the only picture with any kind of apparition and the spirit seemed to be
posing.&nbsp; Despite all the signs my dad and I have noticed, my mother
has seen nothing.&nbsp; My father and I have a theory that maybe the spirit
could be the widow and perhaps she feels as if I am her daughter and she
is protecting me.&nbsp; I would very much like to speak with her and I
dont really want to make her leave, but I'm afraid if I try to converse
with her other spirits may feel like I am open to them as well.&nbsp; I
could really use some help with this issue, because I am rapidly becoming
interested in ghost investigations.&nbsp; I also feel like she is trying
so hard to get my attention that I should give here a little respect.&nbsp;
If you need more details feel free to email questions or answers to me.
Thanks so much!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Haunting Experience!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: chinatiger1@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband and I&nbsp; found a charming bed and breakfast hotel in
Ventura,</B>
<BR><B>California (southern California). The hotel is named the Bella Magiorre.</B>
<BR><B>Many european as well as american travelers enjoy staying at this</B>
<BR><B>remodelled 1940's hotel.</B>
<BR><B>In the main lobby is a quaint sitting area, complete with baby grand</B>
<BR><B>piano, fireplace, and soft, lived-in furniture. On one of the tables
is</B>
<BR><B>a book, a book of previous guests who have stayed and witness or
felt</B>
<BR><B>the resident ghost, Sylvia.</B>
<BR><B>Sylvia was described as being a prostitute and residing in the original</B>
<BR><B>hotel in the 1940's in room 15. She was discovered hanging and since
her</B>
<BR><B>sad end, sightings have been reported since the hotel's restoration.
Her</B>
<BR><B>most prominent feature is a identifying smell of "cheap rose perfume"</B>
<BR><B>that is her hallmark.</B>
<BR><B>We stayed a number of times, seeing and hearing nothing. In fact,
we</B>
<BR><B>were rather disappointed that even being taken to "her room", and
video</B>
<BR><B>taping the tour of the room, we saw, nor heard or taped anything
of any</B>
<BR><B>significance.</B>
<BR><B>That changed upon our last visit to the hotel. We had checked into
one</B>
<BR><B>of two of our favorite rooms. These two particular rooms in the
hotel</B>
<BR><B>were the only ones that had an outer room containing a wet bar,
gas log</B>
<BR><B>fireplace, sitting area, microwave and mini frig. The secondary
room</B>
<BR><B>contained the bedroom and adjacent bathroom. The view from either
of</B>
<BR><B>these rooms, the second and third floor, were nice, as it looked
down</B>
<BR><B>into the city of Ventura and towards the ocean.</B>
<BR><B>Every evening complimentary wine and assorted cheeses and fruits
were</B>
<BR><B>served in an alcove on the second floor. We met many travelers some
from</B>
<BR><B>other countries, while the majority were from various parts of the
U.S.</B>
<BR><B>We all talked about "Sylvia", one man even proclaiming that he stayed
at</B>
<BR><B>the hotel many times, and always had a rather startling encounter
with</B>
<BR><B>this ghost. We all smiled, and although I was fascinated, did no
pursue</B>
<BR><B>the conversation further.</B>
<BR><B>We ate a late dinner downstairs at Nora's Restaurant, which is wonderful</B>
<BR><B>with fountains, and a canopy which can be retracted to meet the
evening</B>
<BR><B>skies. After having a wonderful meal, we departed upstairs to our
room.</B>
<BR><B>We had already discussed with both the day and night clerks,&nbsp;
their own</B>
<BR><B>personal experiences with the hotel and the supposed resident ghost,</B>
<BR><B>"Sylvia". Both confirmed rather solemnly that there was such a ghost!</B>
<BR><B>Naturally, my husband was not impressed, I on the other hand was</B>
<BR><B>completely fascinated.</B>
<BR><B>We were told what to look for; flickering lights down the hallway,
a</B>
<BR><B>lingering odor of rose perfume, etc. Well, nothing transpired of
any</B>
<BR><B>importance during that night. When morning broke, I arose to the
outer</B>
<BR><B>room, as I being an early riser, wished to read a paperback book
I had</B>
<BR><B>purchased the night before. My husband was sleeping soundly in the
other</B>
<BR><B>room.</B>
<BR><B>Ten minutes into reading my book, I had a very odd sensation, the</B>
<BR><B>sensation that I could not breathe, that the very air I was breathing</B>
<BR><B>was being sucked out of the room. I could barely catch my breath.
To</B>
<BR><B>further my anxiety, I had the increasing thought that I should turn
to</B>
<BR><B>my left, to the corner of the room, but I was too afraid. I finally</B>
<BR><B>quieted myself down, and looked in that direction. How ridiculous,</B>
<BR><B>nothing was there. Then the flooding of the room with what I call
cheap</B>
<BR><B>rose perfume. It has so overwhelming as to be oppressive and choking.
I</B>
<BR><B>ran into the bedroom and hubby was still sleeping soundly. I quickly</B>
<BR><B>gathered my long winter coat, tied it tightly around me, and bounded</B>
<BR><B>down the hallway, all the time the rose perfume enfolding me.</B>
<BR><B>Now, this was very early in the morning, so both the night clerk
and the</B>
<BR><B>new shift morning clerk were at the registration desk. The look
of panic</B>
<BR><B>on my face alerted them there was indeed something wrong. I told
them</B>
<BR><B>what had happened, and one of them was kind enough to walk me back
to my</B>
<BR><B>room (there is no elevator). Upon going up the first stair landing,
the</B>
<BR><B>night clerk commented that he had just done a "light check" and
that all</B>
<BR><B>the lights were in perfect working order. He then looked at me and</B>
<BR><B>turned toward the direction of "Sylvia's room". The light adjacent
to</B>
<BR><B>that room was actually flashing! As we made our way down the hall,
all</B>
<BR><B>the lights began to flicker, changing speed and pace. We made our
way</B>
<BR><B>into the room my husband and I were staying in. The clerk and I
looked</B>
<BR><B>at each other and we both commented on the heavy presence of the
rose</B>
<BR><B>perfume. We even checked to make sure that the cleaning crew was
not</B>
<BR><B>nearby, but it was way too early in the morning for them to be cleaning</B>
<BR><B>rooms.</B>
<BR><B>Just then the gentleman I had met the night before who shared his</B>
<BR><B>stories about "Sylvia" stopped by the room. We were propping the
door</B>
<BR><B>open, as frankly, we were both scared. The gentleman walking down
the</B>
<BR><B>hallway stopped and looked in my direction. He commented on the
rose</B>
<BR><B>perfume smell, and said "Sylvia must be near you". He said it so
calmly</B>
<BR><B>I got even more spooked. He indicated to the clerk and myself that
upon</B>
<BR><B>wakening, he noticed that "someone" had moved his wallet and comb,
and</B>
<BR><B>that his room was flooded with the smell of cheap, rose perfume.</B>
<BR><B>Frankly, he thought it was amusing, and said he knows it was "her".
He</B>
<BR><B>proceeded on.</B>
<BR><B>Slowly the rose perfume lifted from the room, however, stepping
out in</B>
<BR><B>the hallway, it was still extremely strong. The clerk calmed me
down,</B>
<BR><B>and stated he understood how I felt. He begged me a farewell, and
I sat</B>
<BR><B>down absolutely dumbfounded on the living room sofa. After collecting</B>
<BR><B>myself, I made my way into the bedroom, only to find my husband
snoring</B>
<BR><B>away!</B>
<BR><B>I woke him up immediately and told him what had happened. He stumbled</B>
<BR><B>out to the outer room, saw nothing, and certainly did not smell
the rose</B>
<BR><B>perfume. He patted me on the head and told me "that is was nice
I had a</B>
<BR><B>ghostly encounter"!</B>
<BR><B>Needless to stay I became glued to him until he finally got up,
dressed,</B>
<BR><B>and we went downstairs to the restaurant for an early morning breakfast</B>
<BR><B>and a hasty retreat.</B>
<BR><B>Although I never saw an apparition of "Sylvia", I have absolutely
no</B>
<BR><B>doubt in my mind that she paid me a visit.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for taking interest in this encounter.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Haunting in an Airplane Hangar</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: watsons@caribsurf.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a story that was related to me by my brother who is a director
of a sports car company in England.</B>
<BR><B>They have a racing team and the story revolves around the pre-race
preparations that occured a few years back.</B>
<BR><B>One of his colleagues came into work one day with a big gash on
his hand and when my brother asked about it he told him what had happened.</B>
<BR><B>They had been working on the car in an old airplane hangar in Surrey.
The hangar is on an unused airfield, but had seen a lot of activity of
course during WWII. They had each in turn complained about the building,
how cold it was in there despite the mild temperature outside and just
a very eerie feeling. None of them would have felt safe being alone there
but they assumed this was due to the size and solitude of the place.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, one evening as my they were working on the car and leaning
over the engine they just heard an almighty noise, enough to make this
guy jerk upright and cut his hand badly on the tool he was using and all
of them heard it at the same time. It was unmistakable, the sound of boots,
lots of boots, all running across the hard ground. They said they couldn't
believe what they had heard but it was so distinct they couldn't put it
down to being anything else. There was no one else there hut them and certainly
not an army of men enough to make that volume of noise.</B>
<BR><B>I wonder if it was ghosts of a platoon or regiment that had been
stationed there or if it was memories of sound recorded into the building
as I have heard ghosts really may be?</B>
<BR><B>They continued to work in there up to the car race and heard other
peculiar noises that they couldn't really explain, though nothing as extreme
as the sound of the army boots running.</B>
<BR><B>Your website is really interesting. I am a bit of a sceptic but
reading different peoples experiences makes me realises there is something
they all saw and cannot explain.</B>
<BR><B>Keep up the good work.</B><B></B>

He used to</B>
<BR><B>walk out of the house late at night and he said something would

<BR><B>said he could hear its' claws on the ground as he would walk when
he stopped</B>
<BR><B>it would stop or if he ran it would run. We have saw several heads
looking</B>
<BR><B>around doors, glowing figures. My car was sitting outside one day
while</B>
<BR><B>several people were there and no one was around the car and it kindof
bounced</B>
<BR><B>like someone got in it.&nbsp; My mother was home alone and heard

<P><B>Hell Hounds in my Dreams</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: supermex@wctc.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This isn't a ghost story but I think it falls along those lines.
Well I recently have had some weird dreams but one I had a few nights ago
has had me really freaked out. I would like to say I have really clear
and vivid dreams. In my dream I remember I was watching a man walk along
a tree line of the woods near my house. (I know this because I recognized
the area) Then all of the sudden it was me who was walking the path he
was I began to have a really scared feeling come over me, and the urge
to look behind me. When I looked 2 dogs appeared out of the woods and began
to follow me. These dogs were very scary looking with red glowing eyes&nbsp;
I began to run, they chased me only barking very loudly at me at first,
and then they caught up to me and were biting at my heals and calves and
hurting me very badly I finally turned around to face them and when I did
the just stopped and walked away from me&nbsp; vanishing into the woods.
I woke up the next morning remembering the dream but just pushed it aside
as nothing. I began my morning. While I was making my bed I noticed little
blood marks at the foot of my bed not realizing there significance. I ate
my Breakfast and hopped into the shower I began to feel stinging&nbsp;
on my legs and looked to see scratches on my calves and heels deep enough
to draw blood. I freaked out, and ran to tell my dad and mom about the
dream and marks I had on my legs. My dad dismissed it as rubbish. My mom
told me they were demons after me but the fact that I faced them saved
me from them (we a Native American family so my family well my mom and
I any way have very strong feeling and connections with the spirit world
which we strongly believe in). I don't know what all this means but I am
open minded about it.&nbsp; I will be searching for answers about the woods
,about my house, and about dreams. I would like to say thank you for letting
me tell my story and I will let you Know what I find out.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Strange Things</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: KraventheRaven@cs.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Here is some strange things that happened to me and my girlfriend.&nbsp;
sometimes</B>
<BR><B>while she was sleeping she would wake up in the middle of the night
and all</B>
<BR><B>of a sudden not be able to move or talk but she can look around
and maybe</B>
<BR><B>slightly move a finger. I read your arcticle on sleep paralyisis.
and It</B>
<BR><B>seems thats what she gets, She hears a loud buzzing sometimes. and
other</B>
<BR><B>times she hears loud screaming. sometimes a guy scream sometimes
a girl. I</B>
<BR><B>try to tell her its just in her head and shes half asleep. cause
I dont want</B>
<BR><B>her to be scared (she freaks out easily). Whenever something strange
happens</B>
<BR><B>I try to come up with something logical. The way my parents always
had a</B>
<BR><B>logical answer for me while I was growing up, Such as the glowing
blue ball</B>
<BR><B>that just floated through my room was only "ball lightning" and
the only</B>
<BR><B>reason why I saw my Grandpa who passed away in my kitchen is because
I was</B>
<BR><B>thinking about him and missed him.&nbsp; Luckily my girlfriend never
see's any</B>
<BR><B>spirits in a human shape. she just see's lights or orbs. but whenever
she</B>
<BR><B>see's an orb I see a shadow or a person walk through my kitchen
or living</B>
<BR><B>room. One time my girlfriend woke me up and said "I just heard a
loud bang</B>
<BR><B>and saw a wierd light in the kitchen" and as I look up I see a dark
figure</B>
<BR><B>standing near my garbage can in the kitchen. I see it move fast
and disapear</B>
<BR><B>and a second later I hear my front door slam. I went to my front
door and it</B>
<BR><B>was wide open. kinda like something ran right through my house.
My mother</B>
<BR><B>also see's and hears things. but she always see's it out of the
corner of her</B>
<BR><B>eye. My father never see's anything. Something else strange that
happened was</B>
<BR><B>one of my friends found an old sorta spellbook in his actic. he
had just</B>
<BR><B>moved into a new house and the people that moved out left all this
junk in</B>
<BR><B>the actic. He brought it over my house and slept over the night.
He fell</B>
<BR><B>asleep with the book in his backpack next to him. when we woke up
in the</B>
<BR><B>morning he couldnt find the book. I went outside to put the pool
filter on</B>
<BR><B>and saw his book was on the chair on my deck. No one went outside
the night</B>
<BR><B>before. All this wierd stuff happening and I live in a newly built
house.</B>
<BR><B>Maybe the woods that was here were haunted.</B>

<P><B>Two Story House</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, my name is Veronica.&nbsp; When I was a teenager
about 15 we moved into</B>
<BR><B>this two story house.&nbsp; For some reason I was afraid to sleep
upstairs in my</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; at times I would think I heard dishes clanking in the
attic.&nbsp; I told</B>
<BR><B>my parents what I thought.&nbsp; They basicly told me I was crazy.&nbsp;
I have had a</B>
<BR><B>few people spend the night.&nbsp; My cousin Jo spent the night once
and said</B>
<BR><B>something was slapping her pillow.&nbsp; We went downstairs and
slept on the</B>
<BR><B>couch.&nbsp; One night I felt and heard my pillow being slaped.&nbsp;
I have heard what</B>
<BR><B>sounded like footstepd in my room.&nbsp; i was the only one there.&nbsp;
One night when</B>
<BR><B>I was sleeping I was having a bad dream and woke up.&nbsp; Then
it felt like a</B>
<BR><B>body was on top of my body holding me down.&nbsp; I couldn't move,
I couldn't</B>
<BR><B>talk.&nbsp; I tried to scream and couldn't.&nbsp; I prayed, then
it released me.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>then got up and truned on the light.&nbsp; I know I was awake.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I came home from spending a night
with my Aunt and Uncle.&nbsp; My</B>

She said</B>
<BR><B>she seen a shadow of a old man and it grabed her hand as she was
combing her</B>
<BR><B>hair.&nbsp; My sister and I moved to sit on the bed.&nbsp; she looked
at me and turned</B>
<BR><B>white, and her eyes rolled up in her head. she reached up her arms
to grab</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; when she tried to grab me I rolled down the stairs, then
she came to.</B>
<BR><B>She went running down stairs and we both started crying.&nbsp; My
parents still</B>

my sisters (one</B>
<BR><B>which was the same one that seen the shadow of the old man)&nbsp;
and my other</B>
<BR><B>sister.&nbsp; My sisters decided to sleep in my room.&nbsp; they
seen a shadow over my</B>
<BR><B>bed where they were sleeping.&nbsp; it was pitch dark in my room

and they were</B>

seen the</B>
<BR><B>shadow and then they said the boxes fell.&nbsp; They went downstairs
to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning when they went upstairs the boxes were put back
in place.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we moved again, things started happening
in my sister Vonda room</B>

<BR><B>Never Really Believed</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: OdesolateO@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Sunday, September 16th, 2001. Very early in the&nbsp; morning,
around 6:45am, I witnessed was what I speculate as my first ghost experience.
Before I go and tell you what I saw or what I think I saw, I think I should
mention all the details from the night before.</B>
<BR><B>I live in Pennsylvania and my fiance lives on the border of New
York/New Jersey. We were driving home from his house that night at about
12 midnight, which was about a two hour drive, from a funeral that we had
attended early that day for his grandmother. As we were driving home we
got to telling each other about different ghost stories and Urban Legends.
At first I was scared, getting creeped out by each story. However, after
about an hour and a half of stories, I started to relax and enjoy listening
to them. When we got to my house we decided to look for ghost stories on
the Internet. We got into reading in depth stories and looking at pictures.
At about 4:00am, I put him to bed in my guest room. (I still live at home
with my parents and they're very uptight about him and I sleeping together)
The guest room is filled with porcelain (excuse bad spelling at all through
this..) dolls, many put in the closet due to being too "freaky" looking
for him at night. He went to bed with the light on, again being afraid
of the dolls and the empty room. I went back in to my room and stayed up
for another two and a half hours, being afraid myself. I wasn't afraid
of the dolls, but instead my room.</B>
<BR><B>My house is about 12 years old. I have been living in this house
ever since I was 6. (We moved in right after my 6th birthday in October)
The area is new and we were the first people to ever live here. The area
before this was a dense forest and it wasn't torn down until about a year
before the house was built. The area wasn't a graveyard nor was it ever.
(When I was younger I used to think the area was, so I went and did research
directly where my house was located)</B>
<BR><B>As a child I was sent to school at St. Ann's, a Catholic school
in the area. I went to church either Saturday night or Sunday morning for
years and years of my life. When I got to about 5th grade I started to
not believe in God. Around this same time, my parents were asking priests
to come over and bless our house. I asked my parents nicely to keep the
priest out of my room, not wanting it to be blessed. At first my parents
though I was into "the devil", but I explained that with me not believing
in God, meant no "devil" either. When I reached 9th grade I dropped Catholic
school and my parents no longer started to attend church.</B>
<BR><B>I know I have been going off the subject, but I guessed I should
give you the background before the details.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't want to go to bed at all, but I knew I should. So I waited
till the sun came up and crawled in to bed. My room is the hottest in the
entire house. It is so small yet so much electronic equipment. By the time
I had gone to bed I had gotten so cold that I had to sleep fully dressed
with a sweatshirt on. (I never even did this in the winter) When I was
under the covers I looked up at the ceiling. Maybe it was my imagination
due to all the fright I had been going through, but it looked like something
was above me. I also have a few things hanging from the ceiling, a beaded
curtain, fairy, and (what I call) a glitter mop. When I closed my eyes
and opened them again it didn't appear till about two seconds later that
the things on my ceiling were moving. I closed my eyes yet again, and when
I reopened them everything was still for another two seconds till it started
to happen again. I have NEVER in my life been this scared, and I have NEVER
in my life imagined things. (even when I was scared) I closed my eyes and
refused to open them. I fell asleep, from what I recall, a few moments
after.</B>
<BR><B>When I woke up in the morning I looked over at my computer (it is
located right next to my bed) to see what time it was. I was a bit shocked
to see it was 7:48pm (Hour after what happened) considering that I had
a feeling I had been sleeping for a while. About 5 mins. later Derrik knocked
on my door. I asked him for the time cause I would have never figured he
would have knocked on my door so loudly at close to 8:00am. He told me
that it was about 1:20pm. Later today, at around 4pm, Derrik and I had
been talking about what had happened last night. We were both hungry so
I decided to go downstairs and go find something for him and I to snack
on till we went out that night. I came back up and found that he had the
covers over his head. He told me that he saw through the blanket a "blue
light." What I saw was looked VERY transparent, didn't even have a white
tint to it like a ghost might. It was after he told me this that I decided
to write this e-mail.</B>
<BR><B>Before this I never REALLY believed in ghosts the way I do now,
however, maybe we were both scared and imagined this. In one day though?
Everything that was told in this e-mail is true and exact, nothing was
exaggerated. I would really like some help and hope maybe someone could
answer my questions. Please tell me if you think we were both seeing things
or if maybe our willingness to believe has brought out a spirit that has
been at our house for 12 years unseen and unheard.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In room 502 of the old hospital there are strange things.&nbsp;
I have witnesed ghosts in the room.&nbsp; You walk past and it feels like
you are beeing stared at.&nbsp; The stare is so strong it feels like they
are lookin through you.&nbsp; I have also seen glowing red eyes in the
room.</B>
<BR><B>Once in room 502 I was thrown against the wall.&nbsp; Standing about
5 ft. from the wall and no one else in the room made it a bit scary.&nbsp;
Being picked up off the floor and tossed against the wall was bad but then
haveing the feeling i was being chased made it worse.</B>
<BR><B>I have seen and felt strange things in that old hospital.&nbsp;
They say the building is falling down.&nbsp; I was up there just a few
days ago and it is in real good structual shape for as old as it is.</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my old house is in new york.&nbsp;&nbsp; watertown
new york.</B>
<BR><B>anyway. this house was in a ratty kind of area. the inside always
made you</B>
<BR><B>feel uncomfertable.&nbsp; like a cloud blocking the sun. only things
started to</B>
<BR><B>happen.&nbsp; one night i was pushed out of my bed(at least it felt
like i was</B>
<BR><B>pushed) and i woke up crying.&nbsp; another example is when my mother
was</B>
<BR><B>downstairs and my stepdad was sleeping.&nbsp; he said his blankets
were yanked</B>
<BR><B>off. i asked him if maybe they fell off, but he always tucks the
end of his</B>
<BR><B>blankets in! my mother was always saying things like, this house
has a bad</B>
<BR><B>feel to it... she would, and still won't tell me her experiances
in this</B>
<BR><B>house. i remember staying alone there sometimes and feeling like
someone was</B>
<BR><B>watching me. more then once, our posetions would go missing, or
turn up in</B>
<BR><B>another area of the house.there was this one small passage((it was
blocked</B>
<BR><B>with dresser droors to my room, so i called it a secret passage
way)) i</B>
<BR><B>always felt cold and unhppy when i played in it. i'm not sure if
it was just</B>
<BR><B>me. but i was fairly young at the time and don't remember as much
as i'd like</B>
<BR><B>to. i was only 7 i think.&nbsp; it occured to me that we may have
had a ghost</B>
<BR><B>there about a year ago. i also have another story about my moms
friends</B>
<BR><B>house. this story has more proof then the other one.&nbsp; her name
was april.</B>
<BR><B>well anyway, april's uncle had just built this house for her. brand
new.&nbsp; he</B>
<BR><B>worked out most of hus anger and sorrow on this house. his wife
was dieing</B>
<BR><B>with cancer and was a very jealus women. well after the house was
done and</B>
<BR><B>the wife had passed away, april noticed a starnge occurence everyday.&nbsp;
she</B>
<BR><B>would keep this candle on the top of her tv counsil.&nbsp; and every
night when</B>
<BR><B>she returned home from work she would find it upright and on the
floor. it</B>
<BR><B>couldn't have falleb because she tried it and it fell on its side.&nbsp;
after a</B>
<BR><B>while other things like a few plants and pictures ended up doing
the same</B>
<BR><B>thing.&nbsp; she had a psychic come in and look through the house.
it turned out</B>
<BR><B>that their was indeed a ghost here. the psychic said she came to
see what her</B>
<BR><B>husband was doing when he spent his time away from her.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the first story qworries me the most. we lived
there for about&nbsp; years and</B>
<BR><B>things began happening. but the grew worse each time we ignored
it or made a</B>
<BR><B>logical exsc use for it. i would like to know if this place was
indeed</B>
<BR><B>haunted. i have always hoped something supernatural would happen
to me, but</B>
<BR><B>if it happened under my nose, i want to know if it was indeed a
real</B>

<P><B>Hi i am jessica. i have had a ghost experience. i was too little
to be really afraid, but i was aware that something was wrong with this........</B>
<BR><B>one day me and my cousin kayla went upstairs in a room that had
once caught on fire. me &amp; her were curious of what was in a small passage
way up there.</B>
<BR><B>we both knew that there was no floor, but we wanted</B>
<BR><B>to look.</B>
<BR><B>so we unhatched the lock &amp; looked inside. we were suprised to
see a light. we went back downstairs to go swimming.(you can see the attic
with no floor from our pool) so while we got our bathingsuits on we were
quite quiet. then we went outside to discus it.</B>
<BR><B>we got in the pool and started to talk about it.</B>
<BR><B>"okay first of all, the attic thing is right above us. We should
be able to see if there is a window or anything."my cousin said before
we got in the pool. after we jumped in we caught our breath and looked
up where the attic was. we were flabbergasted when we saw no window at
all.</B>
<BR><B>we rushed out of the pool &amp; changed.</B>
<BR><B>Then we rushed upstairs by the passage &amp; opened it up.</B>
<BR><B>this is when we were afraid.</B>
<BR><B>The same light was still there, but three other lights</B>
<BR><B>were with it and moving in circular motions. We felt a freezing
cold breeze. we locked it &amp; rushed downstairs. We</B>
<BR><B>both knew exactly what the figures were, they were without a doubt,
ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>Well pretty amazing huh? I was sooo afraid that i couldn't sleep
for a month straight without having a bad dream about what had happend.</B>
<BR><B>It really hasn't bothered us but I am still aware of it's presence.
I have never gone up there to check since. I'm a chicken &amp; I admit
it! Even though that ghost has lived there like forever, we can sometimes
here bangs on the door.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Melanie and in the year of 1996 my ex-husband and I were
on a</B>
<BR><B>honeymoon in Reno NV.&nbsp; We had some friends out there and decided
it</B>
<BR><B>would be a beautiful and exciting place to visit.&nbsp; Well, our
first day</B>
<BR><B>there we settled into a little hotel/casino on the strip and visited
our</B>
<BR><B>friends.&nbsp; The following days were spent driving around and
exploring the</B>
<BR><B>beautiful countryside of NV.&nbsp; We happened upon a little mining
town that</B>
<BR><B>was still set up like an old western town with the boardwalks and</B>
<BR><B>saloons and little apothecary shops and such.&nbsp; We decided -
hey we are</B>
<BR><B>on our honeymoon , let's go into this little saloon and have a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>cocktails and some dinner, ya know take a break from driving around
and</B>
<BR><B>from the hustle and bustle of Reno.&nbsp; As soon as we walked in
I felt like</B>
<BR><B>I walked back into time.&nbsp; There were men dressed as cowboys
and the</B>
<BR><B>barmaids had on those outfits of the time with the bustles and boustiers</B>
<BR><B>and it was really great.&nbsp; The atmosphere of the whole saloon
was so</B>
<BR><B>authentic.&nbsp; After a long day of driving around and exploring
of course</B>
<BR><B>being a girl the first thing I did was head for the ladies room.&nbsp;
My ex</B>
<BR><B>went up to the bar meanwhile to order our 1st drink.&nbsp; As soon
as I</B>
<BR><B>stepped into that ladies room I felt pure raw cold.&nbsp; Of course
we were</B>
<BR><B>in the mountains of NV and it was March but the whole rest of the
saloon</B>
<BR><B>was cozy and warm.&nbsp; The chill in the ladies room I will NEVER
forget for</B>
<BR><B>I haven't been chilled like it since.&nbsp; It was just so raw.&nbsp;
I mean,</B>
<BR><B>instantly hairs were standing up all over my body and on the back
of my</B>
<BR><B>neck and I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched.&nbsp; I
kept looking</B>
<BR><B>up at the ceiling in the far corner for some reason.&nbsp; I just
could feel</B>
<BR><B>someone watching me.&nbsp; I have never felt like that before or
since.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>proceeded with my business and got out of there as soon as possible.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>ex was like oh my God Mel, you are so pale, you look like you have
seen</B>
<BR><B>a ghost or something!&nbsp; He actually said that!&nbsp; I couldn't
help but kind</B>
<BR><B>of laugh at that and say well I didn't see one but I sure as hell
felt</B>
<BR><B>someone.&nbsp; We got out of there after that because I didn't really
want to</B>
<BR><B>hang around there anymore.&nbsp; We never even touched our drinks
which was</B>
<BR><B>fine by me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bright lights and many people of Reno
were a welcome</B>

<BR><B>Housesitting Horror</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: velvet77@pacbell.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>this is a story about something that happened to me when I was a
teenager that is in direct relation to the other stories I have read on
this sight.</B>
<BR><B>my friend katey had been asked to house sit for a family that was
going out of the country for three weeks.</B>
<BR><B>well, being seventeen and starved for parental freedom, this was
a God send not only to her but for the group of kids she hung out with,
myself being one of them.</B>
<BR><B>things didn't start to get weird until we had spent about a week
there.</B>
<BR><B>than one day one of the girls said that she had been in the kitchen
making herself lunch, when a very astute and older female voice asked that
she and her friends please take leave of the residence.</B>
<BR><B>of course this scared the ^&amp;*)_(*(&amp;%$%$^%%&amp;^ of her,
but the rest of us became sort of arrogant and cocky. Who does lady think
she is trying to ruin our vacation.</B>
<BR><B>so the night after the kitchen incident, we all decided to play
a little game.</B>
<BR><B>we would turn out every light in the house (because we were of exceptional
intelligence)and call out the ghost.</B>
<BR><B>equipped with flashlights and, at least in my case, a great amount
of fear we started out.</B>
<BR><B>we called to the ghost and made jokes back and forth about how this
was our house for now and she could leave if she didn't like it.</B>
<BR><B>I don't think this made her to happy because pretty soon we all
felt her following us around.</B>
<BR><B>it was this immense feeling that could not be shook, no matter if
you were with someone else or not (than both of you felt it).</B>
<BR><B>and you could feel this strong anger in the air a tension that permeated
the entire house.</B>
<BR><B>soon after we began this "game" we stopped, even the macho men has
lost there guts.</B>
<BR><B>we turned every light on talked a little about what had happened
and then decided we should just exit to our respective rooms and try to
sleep.</B>
<BR><B>myself and my boyfriend at the time were given the upstairs bedroom,
which was the room of one of the children that lived there.</B>
<BR><B>we settled our sleeping bags on the floor and lay there for a while
trying to put into words our experience of the evenings events.</B>
<BR><B>then all of a sudden there was this hissing inaudible whispering
and a blue orb appeared towards the back of the room in front of the wall.</B>
<BR><B>I was paralyzed in fear as was my boyfriend, the orb just floated
there for a minute or so and then it passed right into the wall.</B>
<BR><B>I don't think either of us talked at all that night.</B>
<BR><B>in the morning everyone else had a story, the most interesting being
that of my friend Katey and another friend of ours;they were sharing a
room downstairs.</B>
<BR><B>after they had settled into bed and just as they were falling asleep
they heard a women yelling and the sliding glass door opening and slamming,
opening and slamming. The nearest house was across the street, so it could
not have been the neighbors.And I was the only other female on the house
besides those two at that time.</B>
<BR><B>later we found out that the ghost was real and had followed the
family Katey was house sitting for from the house they lived on before.
it is said the reason the ghost followed was because she was the children's
companion and she would do anything to protect them. especially from us
crazy teenagers..................</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AthieisAlecz@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I will tell you my middel name so that no one i know will know this
was me. My name is Valhalla i am 15 now and i believe i have a gift to
see ghosts. My email address is Athieisalecz@aol.com. I don't know if i'm
sending this to the right place but this is one of my stories. I promise
this is a true story. Please don't think i'm some sorta freak.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;When i was about 8 or so I lived in Lincoln, Nebraska in a
house . My Brother, Jerald, and sister, Brenda, were asleep in a bed and
i was asleep on an airmatress. There was a door to my right that lead to
the kitchen and a hallway that lead to another bedroom. A window across
the room that we left open at night that had a screen on it with flowy
white curtains. I woke up cause i remember being really really cold. I
had a thick cover on too so i shouldn't have been so cold. I lay on the
airmatress and look over to my brother and sister. I see they are asleep
and to my suprise, there stood 3 dark figuars, they were completly red
and sort of hovered over the ground. The window was open like always and
the curtains blew around and threw the ghostly figuars. They were on the
left side of the room and the left side of the bed in which my brother
and sister sleept. I couldn't move i felt as if i was so scared i couldn't
breath. I don't know how long i layed there watching them hoping they would
leave. I was so scared i thought if i moved i'd die. I could hear them
too. Not what they were saying but their whispers. It sounded like lots
of little winds blowing hard into eachother. I don't know how to explain
it. They hovered over the floor and whispered to one another. I saw them
glance around the room and then they saw me. I laid there frozen in their
glare. I knew they saw me awake and i felt even more scared than before.
I couldn't see the faces or eyes but i knew they saw me. Then they started
to approach me. The 3 figuars started to hover toward me. They went around
the bottom of the bed in which my brother and sister sleept and they were
coming toward me. I was soooo scared and didn't know what to do. I thought
stay and die. Your brother and sister will die. Then i thought run and
save yourself and bring mom to save your brother and sister. These were
my choices. I felt if i didn't run i'd die. They were geting nearer now.
I looked to my right without moving my head and saw the kitchen light under
the door. I thought maybe mom was still awake&nbsp; and she would protect
me. I think i was to scared to even scream so i threw off the covers and
within a millisecond i was out the door and slamming it behind me and all
i could think was RUN! I ran into the frontroom where my mom lay asleep
on the couch I threw myself on her and shook her violently screaming for
her to wake up. She finally woke up very drosey and asked me what was wrong
and i tried to talk but all i could do was cry. She asked me if i had a
bad dream and i cried out a no i told her COME LOOK COME LOOK! she wouldn't
and she said lay down right her with me and go to sleep. I begged her to
come scare them away but she wouldn't and i cried. I could only lay next
to her and stare into the kitchen at the door terrified at what might come
out. I made sure there was nothing in the dark Frontroom. I couldn't sleep.
I thought the 3 things would kill us all. I finally passed out and sleept.
The next morning i cried cause i didn't want to go in the room. I want</B>
<BR><B>ed to know if Brenda and Jerald were okay but i was to scared. They
finally came out after they woke up and i hugged them for a long time.
Nobody ever believed me. I swear on my very life they were there and i
dunno why they were. I never found out but we moved so i was happy. I told
my cousin about it and she has had the same expirence except the 3 were
a blue white color. I've had other ghost expirences that were wierd. I'll
probably send you another email.Thankx 4 listening to me</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The House In Michigan revisited</B>
<BR><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Now starting with the first "haunting" since the last time we wrote.
I was down stairs in the basement taking a shower around 1 or 2 AM when
I turned around to grab the soap off the soap tray the basement became
deathly cold, and I felt a very uneasy feeling behind me, and when I turned
around I seen a hand with a white sleeve, a sleeve almost like a woman's
blouse covered in blood reaching in after me. Needless to say I ran like
hell, after throwing my clothes on, and darted into the computer room where
"omen" was sitting. I didn't move for at least 3 hours.</B>
<BR><B>Before I go on, I am only writing about things that I have witnessed,
so this maybe a short list.</B>
<BR><B>After that incident, I DON'T go downstairs at that time in the night
for ANYTHING.</B>
<BR><B>The second incident happened while I was upstairs hanging out with
my friend "Warwick" his real name won't be used either. As we sat there
talking my CD player stopped suddenly and for 5 minutes didn't make a noise,
not even to stop, and then started up right where it had stopped. We both
looked at each other and didn't really pay much attention to it, until
I started to hear a voice in the living room below me saying something.
I thought my parents had gotten home early so I went down stairs to see
if my Dad needed help getting food, soda, exc. into the house. As I got
down, no one was there. I was a bit shaken but It didn't bother me, until
it happened 3 days in a row. On the last day as I turned to go back upstairs,
the basement door, which was closed when I went by was cracked open. I
know it wasn't my cat because she was hiding in the computer room closet
under an old coat of mine. I hauled ass back upstairs and told "Warwick"
but he didn't believe me, he thought I was just seeing things. Anyway,
the second to the last thing that happened, happened in a dream. Me, "Omen,"
"Kev","Warwick" were all sleeping upstairs , "Omen's" girlfriend was out
of town at the time..I think, I am not to sure. Anyway I was half asleep
and half awake, and I was in what appeared to be a dream but it wasn't.
I was at Eloise Mental Institution with the other three. As we walked across
the old foundation of the main building I heard "Kev" Scream I can't move
and fall to his knees, and when he said that in this dream type world,
he said it in real life. After he had fallen to his knees he vanished,
and when that happened I heard him sit up and go downstairs. My eyes never
opened, but I knew it was him. "Warwick" had something similar happen to
him in this "Dream." He became frozen with fear I guess at this apparition
that appeared in the center of the foundation. He cried out something I
couldn't understand, and then HE woke up and went downstairs. Later "Omen"
began to hold his head in this dream world and screamed for me to get the
hell out of here and he exploded as the apparition touched him. Needless
to say I was now frightened by this "dream," but I knew "Omen" was all
right because he got up and went downstairs. I was hearing everyone get
up in the "real" world but in the "dream" world I didn't see them anymore.
Then It was my turn, the "ghost" turned to me and spoke these very words
"Judgment is at hand, fear your worst dream" and then I was jolted awake
by a clap of thunder outside.</B>
<BR><B>and the FINAL thing that has happened, happened just last night.
As Omen has told you back in 98, the upstairs room burnt do to some unknown
source. Anyway as I got ready for bed, I took my glasses and laid them
next to my radio, which still stops once in a while and starts again and
laid down and pulled my blanket over me. As I did this, I heard a crackling
noise. I didn't open my eyes but it sounded like something was burning.
After a few minutes I began to question myself if I had forgot to put the
cigarette I had just smoked out. When I opened my eyes, there was nothing
unusual about the room. Nothing was burning and the cigarette was out.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know if that was a sign saying "this room will catch fire
once again" or just the past replaying itself.</B>

<BR><B>3 Years Old</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Shortstuf677@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. I have a story to tell you about when I was three. I was playing
outside by some trees (I live in a canyon....there is forest everywhere)
and I was just running around when I heard a noise...It kinda sounded like
trees moving around...like something or someone was moving bushes out of
the way and stuff. I looked over there and saw some giant creature with
long tan colored hair and a big fat nose (like a gnome or a dwarf would
have..) and it was pretty much pushing the trees out of the way...I screamed
and ran back into my house and told my Grandma about what I saw...she thought
I was making it up or something (figures..!!) and she told to get washed
up for dinner. It really scared me.&nbsp; Later on in life, I went down
into the creek where it came from but only found bones (most likely unrelated
to the thing I saw cuz...its just natural to find bones down there...plus
it was a couple years ago at that time). I also have a couple other little
things to tell you....when I was about 2 I think...I was sleeping in my
moms room...and&nbsp; I heard the door open and looked up out of bed to
see a freaky looking Beast with a moon shaped head (most likely a dream....but
it still scared me!!) come into the room....and one time sleeping in my
moms room...I heard a laugh (kinda like huhuhuhuh) and it had a deep sounded
voice that scared me enough to cover my ears (I hate doing that at night
when trying to fall asleep..it freaks me out for some reason)...anyways,
those are my stories....hope you enjoyed them. Thanks. P.S. This site scares
me!! (but I still love it a LOT!!)</B><B></B>

<BR><B>afterwards, i wouldn't go to school, i only sat and cried all day
long,</B>
<BR><B>cursing God for taking my grandmother away from me. that night i
cried myself</B>
<BR><B>to sleep as usual.&nbsp; but this night was different, i had a dream
of my</B>
<BR><B>grandmother.&nbsp; we were playing around with her plants and flowers
like we used</B>
<BR><B>to do.&nbsp; i started crying and apologizing for not spending as
much time as i</B>
<BR><B>could with her. she told me that she was happy now, and free of
pain.&nbsp; she</B>
<BR><B>also told me to stop worrying, and that she wasn't a guardian angel,
but an</B>
<BR><B>ambiant spirit.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i know for a fact it is odd for people to dream
up vocabulary words we</B>
<BR><B>have never heard of. i looked it up and it means "all surrounding,</B>
<BR><B>everywhere". i felt a calm sort of peace after that, my grandma
is always</B>
<BR><B>around me, even if i can't see her. i wish i could sometimes and
i still cry,</B>
<BR><B>like i am right now.&nbsp; but then i remember she is always around
me and with</B>
<BR><B>me. I hope others read this someday and see that you never really
lose a</B>
<BR><B>loved one, because even if the pass on they will remember and guide
you in</B>
<BR><B>ways you can't possibly comprehend.&nbsp; they will always be with
you. Even if</B>
<BR><B>your depressed or feel lost and alone. they will help you out of
the darkness.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Indian Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Angelchic12787@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hi my name is Danielle and I live in New Jersey. I just moved recently
but the house I used to live in was haunted. My old house was built on
top of a Native American Burial ground. When I was 10 I learned about ghosts
and I would love to read stories about them and stuff like that. Anyway
my friends and I have always felt some sort of presecence in my house.
My one friend Kelly never used to sleepover my house (until recently) because
she was so scared. One day my sister was home alone because I was on vacation
with my Mom my sister was about 20 she said she heard people down stairs
scurrying around and walking all over the place. Another time I woke up
early in the morning and was walking downstairs when I realized the house
alarm was on so I started to go up the stairs to turn it off then I heard
the door leading to our garage open and slam shut! I knew the door couldn't
have actually opened because the alarm didn't go off&nbsp; and I am still
confused about that to this day.</B>
<BR><B>During Christmas time we had put a small Santa Clause on our stairway
railing and I heard a boom and saw that the Santa had flown across the
Foyer. One night I was in my room and saw a faded looking Indian standing
up straight in the corner of my room he had a headpiece on with feathers
on it, he was looking straight ahead. Then he disappeared. My friend and
I were sleeping in my guest room and she was jolted awake she turned and
she saw an Indian girl lying on the floor of the room we were so scared
that we ran right out of there in a flash!</B>
<BR><B>Also I have a below ground pool I was swimming in the shallow end
and put my goggles on and went to look underwater at the deep end I saw
this white cloud moving and then come very close to me and it hit me in
the face! I shot up and got myself right out of that pool! Weird occurrences
like this have happened to me the 13 years I lived in that house now I
have moved and I never feel like I'm being watched and I never hear footsteps
or see things. You get an eerie felling when you live in a house with ghosts
and the second I moved out of my old house that feeling was long gone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: scooby@carrollsweb.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I Live in Topeka Ks. One Night my two children and I&nbsp; drove
out to visit my friend who lives in Mayetta. She lives on several acres
of land that use to belong to the Powattiamie Indians. After talking for
several hours I was to tired to make the 30-45 minute drive back. I put
my 6 year&nbsp; old daughter on the love-seat that sat at the north side
of the living room and I put my other 4 year old daughter on the north
end of the couch. the couch sat on the right side of the love seat. After
this I laid down&nbsp; at the other end of the couch facing the love-seat
so I could see both children. I fell asleep quickly. I don't know how long
I was asleep before I awoke but when I did I saw an indian lady sitting
looking at me. She had long black hair and was wearing a white shirt. I
waved at her . I could hear my friend talking to her husband at the dining
room table and the lights were on. Her husband was a security guard at
Harrahs so I assumed he had brought a friend home from work. I made my
daughter get up and move so she wouldn't kick the lady. Again I waved&nbsp;
feeling bad that I was to tired to get up and felt I was being terribly
rude. I woke up at least two more times to see her watching me.&nbsp; The
next morning the kids and I left and returned home with no mention of it.
A couple weeks later I was talking to my friend. She informed me there
was no one there that night. Both her and her husband had seen my strange
behavior and just shrugged. They hadn't seen anyone there.</B>
<BR><B>My Friend has had stuff come up missing and things appear to only
come up missing later.</B>
<BR><B>She has tole me that since my expirence at least two other people
have seen this lady and we believe she was simply watching over the kids.</B>
<BR><B>There is also a black cat that trys to get you to follow it and
will then disappear at the bushes.</B>
<BR><B>This is just one of the many expirences I have had with the paranormal
in my life.</B>

<BR><B>It Touched Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: NickK@geoaccess.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband and I bought our first home when I was six months pregnant
with</B>
<BR><B>our first child. The house was somewhat new--only five years old--and</B>
<BR><B>located in a quiet suburb. I never gave a thought to ghosts, but
from the</B>
<BR><B>first night we moved in, strange things began to happen. The first
night we</B>
<BR><B>slept in our new home, I was awakened by a "squeaking" noise coming
from the</B>
<BR><B>room we had designated to be the nursery.&nbsp; I woke up my husband,
who</B>
<BR><B>convinced me it was either my imagination or a mouse. I don't remember</B>
<BR><B>anything too eventful happening until after my son was born. I would
always</B>
<BR><B>arrive home before my husband (we both worked at this point), and
as I</B>
<BR><B>played with my son in his bedroom (we lived in a three bedroom ranch
with</B>
<BR><B>the bedrooms and bathrooms at one end and the kitchen, dining room
and</B>
<BR><B>family room at the other) I would swear I would hear my husband
arrive home</B>
<BR><B>from work. It sounded like he would come in the front door and walk
down the</B>
<BR><B>hallway, but when I went to greet him, no one was there. The weird
thing</B>
<BR><B>was, my baby heard it too! His face would light up, and he would
look into</B>
<BR><B>the hall waiting for my husband to appear. I didn't tell anyone
about these</B>
<BR><B>things until my sister, who babysat for my son on occasion, mentioned
to me</B>
<BR><B>that she heard what sounded like someone entering the house but
no one was</B>
<BR><B>ever there. Then we began having the classic signs of objects turning
up</B>
<BR><B>missing and then reappearing in obvious places like the refrigerator
or</B>
<BR><B>kitchen pantry, right under our noses. My husband blamed me, of
course.</B>
<BR><B>Whenever I was alone, I always had the feeling that someone was
watching me,</B>
<BR><B>and the hair would suddenly stand up on the back of my neck. And
there were</B>
<BR><B>always the footsteps pacing up and down the hallway. I tell you,
when my</B>
<BR><B>husband traveled I always had my son sleep in my bedroom and locked
the door</B>
<BR><B>I was so scared. At this point, I was convinced something or someone
was in</B>
<BR><B>our house, but my husband is a nonbeliver so I didn't talk to him
or anyone</B>
<BR><B>else about it. Other than my sister, no one had experienced anything
and I</B>
<BR><B>was afraid people would think I was crazy.&nbsp; The incident that
confirmed my</B>
<BR><B>suspicions occurred was when I was due with my second child. I had
been to</B>
<BR><B>the hospital earlier that day with false labor and the nurses had
sent me</B>
<BR><B>home. I was in a great deal of pain with irregular contractions
and had</B>
<BR><B>taken some benedryl to try and sleep. I remember that I was laying
on my</B>
<BR><B>side facing my husband (who--surprise--was sleeping) when all of
a sudden I</B>
<BR><B>distinctly felt two hands massage my shoulders. I closed my eyes,
thinking I</B>
<BR><B>was hallucinating, when again I distinctly felt two hands knead
my</B>
<BR><B>shoulders. Well, I didn't need any more prodding. I jumped out of
bed,</B>
<BR><B>called my doctor and had my husband drive me to the hospital. Eight
hours</B>
<BR><B>later, I delivered another healthy baby boy. Shortly afterward,
we began</B>
<BR><B>looking for a bigger home and moved. I didn't tell anyone about
the ghost</B>
<BR><B>touching me for about a year, and I still don't think people take
me</B>
<BR><B>seriously. But I know what I felt, and I've never in any way been
afraid in</B>
<BR><B>my new home. I don't know what I experienced, but I try to be more
open</B>
<BR><B>minded when it comes to the spiritual world.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>El Paso Texas</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AthieisAlecz@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This next story is when i was living in El Paso, Texas. On a street
called Vista De Oro. I am 15 now and don't know how old i was then. My
friend Mary Ann and I lived in one of the quad-plexs. We used to take a
quilt or blanket out into the parking lot at night and lay out there talk
about our lives and look at the stars. It's kinda a busy short cut street
so cars go up and down it all the time. The Ridgemar Apartments are right
across the street so people walk up and down the street alot. Well one
night like all the others we were outside looking at the stars talking.
When we heard footsteps like a jogger running up the street with his/her
tennieshoes hiting the cement. We got quiet. Like we always did and waited
4 the sound and person to pass the quad-plex so we could finish talkin.
The sound was coming from the oppisite side of the road and from the top
of the hill. I saw like what looked like a transpartent, very white, man,
dressed as a jogger. I could hear the shoes running but the feet weren't
really there. The man ran with great speed i mean a normal guy could never
run that fast. He looked across the street at us as we sat up looking at
him or it. I waited till he had gotten pretty far down the road and i turned
to Mary Ann next to me and said DID YOU SEE THAT?! she said yeah and i
was totaly freaked. We decided that it was gone now and that we wouldn't
have to run inside and we didn't feel threatened. So we started talking
again and the ghostman ran down toward the intersection. Latter on we heard
the jogger footsteps again and we stood up. It was on this side of the
street now. We couldn't see if it was close or not cause there's a stupid
pine tree in the way.All of a sudden it was in front of us on the sidewalk
the same man-jogger-ghost-thing. this time he stopped and turned toward
us we looked at him dumbfoundedly and he shruged his sholders at us. We
turned tail and ran to our part of the quadplex and slamed our doors. I
told my mom cause she saw how freaked i</B>
<BR><B>was. SHe still didn't believe me. Awhile later i went out far enough
to where i could knock on her door and still sorta be in my house in case
it was still there. Mary Ann said she'd go look out in the parkinglot with
me. We found nothing. The next day her mom told us that a jogger had been
jogging and was crossing the intersection down the street and was hit by
a car that killed him instantly. I was kinda amazed it did make sence.
For those who don't believe me i wasn't on drugs or nething. Thankx for
listening tt4n!</B>

<BR><B>Joann's House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Michelle.Farmer@paxar.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>In the early 1990's , I was friends with a lady named Joann. She
lived in</B>
<BR><B>an 1870's farmhouse that had been remodeled.</B>
<BR><B>She and her husband had recently separated and she had another man,
Tony,</B>
<BR><B>living at the house with her. He was into the ouija board and s&eacute;ances,</B>
<BR><B>among other things. Joann had told me that Tony had taken all of
the</B>
<BR><B>bibles out of the house, along with some crosses and all other articles
of</B>
<BR><B>Christian belief. They had begun to have parties where the main</B>
<BR><B>entertainment was the ouija board. The board told them its name
and that</B>
<BR><B>it was a demon. It was around this time that Joann began to experience</B>
<BR><B>strange things around the house, day or night.</B>
<BR><B>At night, she would wake up because "something" was stroking her
hair. She</B>
<BR><B>would be cleaning through the day and hear creaking and knocking
upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>Things started missing: a playing card, a makeup brush, a cassette
tape</B>
<BR><B>and a few other things. One night, at one of these ouija board parties,</B>
<BR><B>Joann saw a reflection of herself in the window turn into a dog,
then into</B>
<BR><B>a green, evil-looking face. She and Tony would play cards with different</B>
<BR><B>couples on the weekends. Every time they played, someone would get
a hand</B>
<BR><B>of 6,6,6 .</B>
<BR><B>Well, Joann had told me all of these things , so when my boyfriend
and I</B>
<BR><B>went to visit her one evening, I was very nervous. It was summertime
so I</B>
<BR><B>had on shorts to stay cool in the heat. When we stepped into the
house ,</B>
<BR><B>it was freezing..90 degrees outside, 32 degrees inside(cold enough
to see</B>
<BR><B>our breath).We went into the living room to listen to some music
while</B>
<BR><B>Joann continued to get ready to go out that night. We heard constant</B>
<BR><B>creaking from upstairs and tapping on the window. No one else was
in the</B>
<BR><B>house, except the 3 of us.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend didn't believe that the house was haunted. He talked
about</B>
<BR><B>the fact that he would have to see something to believe it and on
and</B>
<BR><B>on....</B>
<BR><B>About 30 minutes later , Joann walked outside with us to the car
to say</B>
<BR><B>goodbye. As we were standing there, my boyfriend said again that
he would</B>
<BR><B>have to see it to believe it...At that moment , ALL of the upstairs
lights</B>
<BR><B>came on . The nightstand lamps, the overhead lights , even a floor
lamp</B>
<BR><B>that had to be plugged in to come on. We freaked out!!!</B>
<BR><B>I must not have liked Joann very well, because my boyfriend and
I jumped</B>
<BR><B>in the car and left. I called her several days later. She had left
the</B>
<BR><B>house and was living at her Mom's. I don't know if anyone lives
there now</B>
<BR><B>. I just know that I wouldn't.</B><B></B>

I tried to call</B>

<BR><B>Jonathan just seemed to stick in my mind.&nbsp; I only saw him about
3 or 4 times</B>
<BR><B>when something else appeared instead.&nbsp; I think it was evil,
it showed itself</B>
<BR><B>to me face to face.&nbsp; It was huge.&nbsp; It had to bend over
to fit in the hallway</B>
<BR><B>of my house.&nbsp; I felt as if he was an old man and very angry.&nbsp;
I don't know</B>
<BR><B>how I know this because I couldn't make out any features but there

<BR><B>overwhelming sense of anger that was overpowering.&nbsp; My parents

a whole lot happend during those years just little things nothing like
that was to come,&nbsp; When i was 16 yrs old that is when it really got
bad for whatever reason&nbsp; we couldnt really pinpoint. Things were throw
across the room.&nbsp; One ghost was a small women in white&nbsp; just
skin and bones sooooo skinny but in white clothes her face pale and hollow
black around her eyes&nbsp; she was seen&nbsp; quite&nbsp; a few times
then later in the yrs a man that looked like my dad. But just all the things
that happened i wouldbe&nbsp;&nbsp; in my room down stairs and i could
hear things crashing to the floor no one else heard it i would go upstairs
nothing was out of place. something walking up and down the stairs all

to&nbsp; scare us they were just there and wanted us to know it they were

<P><B>Lady In The Hallway</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gniwok@juno.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am a Gnostic, or "Truth Seeker", my wife is not, but both of us
are</B>
<BR><B>open minded people. We also believe that spirits exist as well as
ghosts,</B>
<BR><B>and my wife considers it "creepy" while I remain simply facinated
with</B>
<BR><B>them. We moved into an apartment just after we married in 1999.
I believe</B>
<BR><B>that there are ghosts and residual energy in various places in our</B>
<BR><B>apartment. The place is the standard apartment layout, and every
once in</B>
<BR><B>a while, night or day, doesn't matter what time, she or I (or both)
would</B>
<BR><B>hear the sound of footsteps on carpet going down our short hallway.
These</B>
<BR><B>were not boots-on-hardwood footsteps, but more like bare feet on
plush</B>
<BR><B>carpet. We "felt" that the ghost was female and very sweet. She
would</B>
<BR><B>just walk down the hallway toward the bedrooms. If I were in one
of the</B>
<BR><B>bedrooms, I would always have a small feeling of happiness go through
me</B>
<BR><B>after I heard her coming, the way you would feel if someone smiled
at</B>
<BR><B>you. Occasionally we would feel her watching us from the front room
or</B>
<BR><B>back bedroom. Evidently the hallway was where her "domain" was.
There</B>
<BR><B>were never cold spots, but my wife would occasionally feel the lady
next</B>
<BR><B>to her when she walked from the bedrooms to the front room. The
lady made</B>
<BR><B>my wife feel rather creeped out, however. She startled me once when
she</B>
<BR><B>came running into the bedroom, eyes wide and told me that the lady
moaned</B>
<BR><B>in her ear, as if trying to say something to her! So for the sake
of my</B>
<BR><B>wife, we stood in the hallway and asked the lady nicely, but firmly
that</B>
<BR><B>she could remain, but to not make her presence known to us. We also</B>
<BR><B>informed her about the light, and how she could enter into it. Since
we</B>
<BR><B>have had no more occurances with her. In the small bedroom, there
is</B>
<BR><B>either residual energy or a passive ghost. I feel watched when I'm
in</B>
<BR><B>there, and it's usually ten to fifteen degrees cooler, even with
the</B>
<BR><B>afternoon sun spilling in. I don't think my wife feels it, and no
one</B>
<BR><B>else does either. But I have felt it strongly, so I placed a</B>
<BR><B>micro-cassette recorder in there with a sensitive mic and recorded
for</B>
<BR><B>the duration of the thirty minute tape. The only odd things I've
heard on</B>
<BR><B>the tape were an occasional whistle that changes in octave. The
sound</B>
<BR><B>only lasts for a half-second, but it is an audible, breathy whistle
that</B>
<BR><B>goes up in octave like first part of a wolf-whistle! That was</B>
<BR><B>interesting, and I'd dismiss it, if it weren't for some of our</B>
<BR><B>possessions being misplaced that suddenly appear in odd places.
Our truck</B>
<BR><B>keys suddenly disappeared this morning without a trace anywhere.
The</B>
<BR><B>truck was searched over twice and the apartment was searched. So
I made</B>
<BR><B>duplicates at Home Depot, and gave them to my wife, who used them
to</B>
<BR><B>drive to a doctor's appointment. When the appointment was over,
she</B>
<BR><B>walked back out to the truck and opened the door with the duplicate
key.</B>
<BR><B>There on the driver's side seat was the original set of keys that
were</B>
<BR><B>missing. She would have felt them under her bumm if they'd been
there</B>
<BR><B>before! She called me at work in hysteria, telling me all about
it! I</B>
<BR><B>don't mind ghosts being around, I consider them friends (or at least
I</B>
<BR><B>try to make friends with them). They are in fact, just spirits without</B>
<BR><B>bodies. Some are angry, some nice, some are jokers! When you come
across</B>
<BR><B>one, you should respect him or her just like you would a complete</B>
<BR><B>stranger. Make friends with it or ask it to leave, if you wish.
But don't</B>
<BR><B>disrespect ghosts because of childhood Halloween stories. They are</B>
<BR><B>intellegent humans who are a bit confused about where they are.
If you</B>
<BR><B>happen to have one around you, simply ask it to walk into the light
where</B>
<BR><B>friends and loved ones await them. Be firm, but friendly. Some ghosts</B>
<BR><B>won't believe you and will continue to stay. You can't make a ghost
go</B>
<BR><B>anywhere! Hope this helps anyone with their own ghost!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Leo</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sunchild115@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My parents and i moved into a house that was built back in the 1920s
back in 1991. It was really a beatiful house that appeared as normal as
any other house.The people that lived there many many years before us were
2 sisters and a brother. His name was Leo and he passed away in the back
bedroom of the house, the older sister went crazy and was commited and
the younger sister moved away. We were the first occupants of that house
since then. We did not know that this man had died in this house until
6 months later, when my parents moved out. But Leo made his presence well
know with no hesitation. The back room that he passed away in was so cold
no matter what, so cold that you could feel it coming from underneath the
door out into the hallway. Needless to say that bedroom was never put into
use.</B>
<BR><B>I slept up in the attic, but it was a real big attic and the other
door across from my bedroom door had a lock on it and we never knew why.
Late at night i would be awaken to that door rattling loudly, like someone
was trying to get out. In my room i would have my stereo on and it would
change stations all the time but always to classical music. Not only did
it change stations it changed from FM to AM. If i had my windows open they
would slam shut, my tv turned on and off, stuff would be moved around my
room. This was a very constant haunting.</B>
<BR><B>Then one day i was sitting in my room watching television and my
room got very cold, i sware i could see my breath, and it was a blazing
summers day. I heard a whisper from behind me. It kinda sounded like someone
said look, so i did. Im my doorway was a black figure and i just froze.
I knew there was a presence but i havent seen it until then. Then slowly
it raised its hand and pointed at the door across the hall with the lock
on it. Then it faded right before my eyes, the room warmed up and i got
out of my room for a while. To this day we never knew what was in that
room, why it was locked and why Leo was pointing at it.&nbsp; In my room
were little doors on each side of the room. Im not sure what they are called
but if you went in there you could see all the insulation and stuff like
that. Anyway that night one of them slammed open, i woke up looked over
at which one it was and didnt see anything, so i got up and closed it.
I finally fell back to sleep and was awoken later on that night to a black
figure standing over top of me grabbing my wrist. I freaked out jumped
up and went flying down the steps to my parents room and in the morning
they woke up to me asleep on the floor. In the morning i had a mark around
my wrist like someone was grabbing rather hard.</B>
<BR><B>Up until that point my parents knew nothing of these incidents.
So in the morning they asked what was wrong with me and i told them everything
that had happened and i showed them my arm. Of course they did not believe
me, but i was 15 then why would i want to sleep in my parents bedroom??
A few weeks later my mother had an incident in the kitchen. I came home
from school and she was just standing there and the clock was face up laying
in front of her on the other side of the room. She said she turned around
from the sink and the clock shot straight off the wall at her. At that
point she started to believe me.</B>
<BR><B>My cats were aware of this as well. They wouldnt go into the back
hallway where that room is. They would come up into my room ocassionally
but eventually they would start to hiss and run out. My father finally
believed my mother and i&nbsp; when they came home from the store and found
me sitting behind the couch with a knife after i had seen someone in my
diningroom through the diningroom window. I was coming home and i noticed
a reflection of a figure in the mirror and as i approached the house the
light in that room shut off. So i thought it was my mother so i went in
and said hello and noone answered. The door to the dining room was shut
and i noticed that the light was on again and as i walked closer to the
door&nbsp; it turned off again. So i promptly went into the kitchen grabbed
the biggest knife i could find and quietly got behind the couch. The door
to the diningroom was one of those old sliding doors that crunched up when
you opened it. (Sorry that is the best way i can think of to describe it).
So while i was sitting behind the couch i heard the door being opened and
closed over and over&nbsp; again. It was horrible. Finally my parents came
home and they thought i was in the diningroom because they saw the light
go out, so they came in yelled out hello and i popped up from behind the
couch so relieved that someone was home.</B>
<BR><B>There are many other incidents that have occured in that house but
to type them all would take a good while. Surprisingly we didnt move out
6 months later because of Leo. He didnt really bother us that much, only
once in a while he did some real freaky things. Everything else he did
was pretty much basic things that you hear about.</B>

<P><B>Little Children</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ppsmurf93@prodigy.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in a small two story house in the chicago sub-burbs. My fiancee
and my brother are the only ones,so far, who have seen our "children".&nbsp;
My fiancee's expierence took place at night in our room. Our room is upstairs
and runs the whole lenghth of our house. He was sound asleep, and woke</B>
<BR><B>with a start, sitting straight up in bed. He looked to the opposite
end of our room and sat there for about five minutes watching two small
children playing. He said it looked like they were playing some sort of
tag game. We have no children in our house!&nbsp; Then about a month later,
my brother</B>
<BR><B>was leaving the house to run an errand in the evenning, he took
his semi-tractor. When ever he leaves in his big truck he will toot on
his air horn to say goodbye, he said he glanced toward our front room windows
as he blew his horn and saw me wave back to him. Well, when he left I was
in the shower and no one else was in the house, It wasnt me who waved goodbye!!&nbsp;
Ive asked the woman who lived here before us if she ever saw anything like
what we have and she said she hasnt and as far as she knows, there have
never been any children living here.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Lost in Time</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:doe321@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This experience is not that exciting to here about, I do not wish
to embelish it with creepy anecdotes or a mysterious plot, but nevertheless
this is how it went.&nbsp; I attended Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham
Virginia, a town that itself is stuck in time.&nbsp; It is the home of
racists, biggots, and sadists who have inherited land from their ancestors.&nbsp;
It is not a place in which i would suggest visiting.&nbsp; Having said
that I used to make a trip with some of my classmates to a beer store,
57's, which was an hourlong walk through pasture and woods from the campus.&nbsp;
We never left with the intent to be caught by school officials, one of
which, Capt. Stout, a double medal of honor veteran, who is as sneaky and
stealthy as anyone on the planet.&nbsp; The penalty of being caught was
very high-- we did not mention this experience to anyone who was not present;
it surely would have spread.&nbsp; we were on our way back from 57's at
about 1 o'clock in the morning a little buzzed from cheap beer with the
intent to distribute alcohol to other students when the three of us(my
roomate and his best friend) stopped dead in our tracks for no reason.&nbsp;
I will remember the next sequence of events until the day I die.&nbsp;
We heard the unmistakable war cries of rebel soldiers on the charge.&nbsp;
It is a sound somewhat akin to an impassioned tribesman intent on killing
you.&nbsp; From attop a hill directly in front of us, through the trees
came 30 to 40 purley solid figures charging, apparently unconcerned with
us.&nbsp; We hit the forest floor and did not make a sound as we witnessed
a battle, first 10 or 12 volleys of gunfire and finally hand to hand combat
and then retreat.&nbsp; It is pointless for me to explain every troop movement
i witnessed, just use your imagination and you should understand.&nbsp;
The whole incident lasted no longer than 2 or 3 minutes, but the cries
of those men will haunt me forever.&nbsp; Those who have experinced combat
as i have since understand why that was the last time i ever ducked when
i heard gunfire, after that day i have not been the same.&nbsp; I was not
so much scared by the events i witnessed, but by the uncertanty of time.&nbsp;
Afterwards I was not convinced that we where going to find HMA as we had
left it, but that maybe we would be guests in an unfamiliar time.&nbsp;
I do not know for sure if they were in our time or if we were in theirs,
but these were not ghosts.&nbsp; These were the actual events taking place.&nbsp;
I will never be the same person again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Manzanillo Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ssmith@toddvnm.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 6 years old I went to visit my grandarent's condo
in</B>
<BR><B>Manzanillo, Mexico.&nbsp; The building was an old hotel that they
had purchased</B>
<BR><B>and turned into condominiums. One night I woke up in the middle
of the night</B>
<BR><B>and decided to get a drink of water. I went out into the living
room/</B>
<BR><B>kitchen area and I saw a man sitting in a wing-backed chair at the
dining</B>
<BR><B>room table. He was playing cards and smoking a cigar. I could only
see the</B>
<BR><B>silloughette at first, so I thought it must be my Dad or my Grandpa.</B>
<BR><B>"Dad," I said, but the man didn't respond. "Grandpa," I tried, but
he still</B>
<BR><B>didn't respond. It slowly occurred to me that we didn't have any
wing-backed</B>
<BR><B>chairs like the one the man was sitting on. Also neither my father
ot</B>
<BR><B>grandfather smoked cigars. I started to feel a little afraid but
I was also</B>
<BR><B>very curious. I walked closer to the man. He didn't appear to notice
that I</B>
<BR><B>was there. "Who are you?" I asked and he still did not respond.
As I got</B>
<BR><B>closer the man disappeared. I ran back to bed without my drink of
water. I</B>
<BR><B>didn't get any sort of evil feeling from the man. On the contrary
he seemed</B>
<BR><B>to be a very nice man. Had he not been sitting in my living room
in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the night in a chair we didn't own I probably wouldn't
have been</B>
<BR><B>afraid. I am guessing he may have been the ghost of a former guest
of the</B>
<BR><B>hotel.</B>

<BR><B>Mary</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: paulagreene45@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A few years ago I bought a my first house.&nbsp; It seemed really
happy when I first looked at it.&nbsp; About six months later I married
my husband, Bobby.&nbsp; I had noticed some odd things before we married.&nbsp;
Someone knocking on the door and no one being there, hearing laughter,
my water bed moving when I wasn't.&nbsp; None of this scared me because
I had lived in quite a few haunted houses already.</B>
<BR><B>Not long after Bobby and I got married he asked if I had experienced
anything odd.&nbsp; I asked what kind of odd.&nbsp; He said we had a ghost.&nbsp;
I asked what he knew and he told me.</B>
<BR><B>She was a young teen (around 14) who had died in the 1860 time frame
of some sickness.&nbsp; She was very friendly and just wanted to play.&nbsp;
Intrestingly enough she was buried in the grave yard across the street
from us.&nbsp; She chose us because Bobby could both see and hear her and
I have two sons who were teens at that time.</B>
<BR><B>Some nights she would get scolded when she insisted on jumping on
our bed to often or knocked on the door several times.&nbsp; Then we would
tell her to stop or we would have to ignore her.&nbsp; She only got angry
one time.</B>
<BR><B>My oldest son had been giving us some grief and one night she must
have slamed his bedroom door a dozen times!&nbsp; Later than night he came
home and went to his room (which was in the basement).&nbsp; He came running
back up the stairs and asked who had been in his room.&nbsp; We assured
him none of us has been down there and asked him why.&nbsp; He said the
entire contents of his closet, including the shelves and rod was in the
middle of his floor.&nbsp; We told him it was Mary and she was mad at him.&nbsp;
Needless to say, he walked on eggs for a few days.</B>
<BR><B>A couple of years ago we had to move.&nbsp; I really miss Mary.&nbsp;
She was just a lonely little girl who wanted a family.&nbsp; We were lucky
enough to be it.&nbsp; I have some more stories that I'll post later.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Midnight Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kiutupy@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four of us went walking in the hills of San Jose.&nbsp;
We all felt as though</B>
<BR><B>something else was there, following us and hindering out walk.&nbsp;
It was late</B>
<BR><B>at night, and we thought it only to be our nerves.&nbsp; Except
one of us, an</B>
<BR><B>occultist, who kept telling me that we were not welcome there.&nbsp;
All at once,</B>
<BR><B>I was knocked to the ground.&nbsp; My arms felt pinned, and I couldn't
breath.&nbsp; No</B>
<BR><B>one else felt anything, but I couldn't tell them what was happening.&nbsp;
After</B>
<BR><B>five minutes passed, I could breath again and move.&nbsp; We could
all hear</B>
<BR><B>laughing, and we could see an eerie light that glowed bluish red.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>getting really scared, so we all went home.&nbsp; Later that night,
my occutist</B>
<BR><B>friend went back on that same trail with some of his coven.&nbsp;
They later told</B>
<BR><B>me that the spirit they encountered threatened me, he apparently
thought I</B>
<BR><B>was someone else who had done him a great wrong.&nbsp; All I remember
about that</B>
<BR><B>night was that I dreamed that a great beast was staring at me, and
whipping</B>
<BR><B>me with his tail.&nbsp; The next morning, everywhere the tail had
hit me, there</B>
<BR><B>were deep scratches is series of threes.&nbsp; After talking this
over with my</B>
<BR><B>friend, we decided to try to placiate the spirit.&nbsp; We put flowers
and oranges</B>
<BR><B>and bread on the side of the trail.&nbsp; As soon as we backed away
two steps, the</B>
<BR><B>oranges began to rot, the bread decayed, and the flowers rotted.&nbsp;
The tree</B>
<BR><B>nearby where we were standing crackled, and a large branch fell
hard behind</B>
<BR><B>us.&nbsp; One of the branch nubs cut the side of my wrist, and blood
streamed from</B>
<BR><B>the gash.&nbsp; My friend told me to paint the trees around us with
my blood, as a</B>
<BR><B>sign that we meant no harm, and that we might find protection from
the land</B>
<BR><B>itself.&nbsp; After the trees directly around us had my blood on
them, the breeze</B>
<BR><B>that had been blowing suddenly stopped.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to find out what was going on there.&nbsp;
I figured that it was</B>
<BR><B>something horrible, but I needed to know.&nbsp; The information
that I got</B>
<BR><B>involved a young man and his lover.&nbsp; He found her to be engaged
already,</B>
<BR><B>although she had promised to marry him.&nbsp; He feigned forgiveness,
and asked</B>
<BR><B>them to join him on a picnic.&nbsp; This happened about a hundred
years ago,</B>
<BR><B>according to the information I gleaned.&nbsp; He murdered them both,
and killed</B>
<BR><B>himself.&nbsp; Thing were made clear to me then.&nbsp; That night,
on the trail, I was</B>
<BR><B>the only female in the group.&nbsp; The spirit of the man was just
angry with me</B>
<BR><B>because I was there with men.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after, I went alone to the same spot and
placed another bundle of</B>
<BR><B>flowers on the side of the path.&nbsp; After I had set out the oranges
and bread,</B>
<BR><B>I re-opened the cut on my arm, and sprinkled my gifts with my blood.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>wind stirred briefly, and all went silent.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have gone back on that trail many times, and
each time the wind</B>
<BR><B>surrounds us.&nbsp; But, we have not been harassed.&nbsp; I had
another friend help me</B>
<BR><B>carve wooden markers for each of the three dead, and I placed them
in the</B>
<BR><B>ground benieth a stand of trees.&nbsp; We often visit them, we bring
a picnic</B>
<BR><B>lunch, just to sit near to them.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Mr. Brown</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: katjordan1@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had ghostly experiences for as long as I can</B>
<BR><B>remember.&nbsp; I have talked about them with my mother</B>
<BR><B>since I was a child, and she has experienced many</B>
<BR><B>things too.&nbsp; My experiences have not occured in one</B>
<BR><B>locatioin - I perceive them - and see them on occasion</B>
<BR><B>- nomatter where I am.&nbsp; It is not something I talk</B>
<BR><B>about much, (is not something that even seems very</B>
<BR><B>remarkable any more), so it is nice to have a place</B>
<BR><B>here to share some stories with others who are</B>
<BR><B>interested!</B>
<BR><B>I have a good friend now, as an adult, who has had</B>
<BR><B>many ghostly experiences through out her life, as I</B>
<BR><B>have.&nbsp; I had her come to the building where I work</B>
<BR><B>recently, just to see if she would notice the old man</B>
<BR><B>in the hallway next to the main staircase up to the</B>
<BR><B>floor my office is on.</B>
<BR><B>I work in an older, two-story building in Florida.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>company moved in to this building just a few months</B>
<BR><B>ago from a newer one.&nbsp; Since we moved here, I have</B>
<BR><B>begun to notice this man.&nbsp; I call him "Mr Brown", as I</B>
<BR><B>heard that that was the name of the man who originally</B>
<BR><B>owned this building, who died a few years ago.&nbsp; I have</B>
<BR><B>no idea if the man I see is actually Mr. Brown, though</B>
<BR><B>I heard from his daughter who now owns the building</B>
<BR><B>that his office was in that front hall.</B>
<BR><B>It started with just seeing someone there in my</B>
<BR><B>peripheral vision as I would come up the stairs.&nbsp; I'd</B>
<BR><B>look, and, of course, there was no one there.&nbsp; I have</B>
<BR><B>to pass that hallway to get to the restroom on this</B>
<BR><B>floor, and occasionally I see him sitting on a chair</B>
<BR><B>in the hallway just as I come around the corner.&nbsp; As</B>
<BR><B>soon as I notice it, he's gone.</B>
<BR><B>I have been here working late a few nights recently,</B>
<BR><B>and I definately get the impression that he does not</B>
<BR><B>like anyone being in his building at night! During the</B>
<BR><B>day he just watches, and I have not seen him at night,</B>
<BR><B>but at night it is more of a feeling, just as if there</B>
<BR><B>were a live person standing next to you who was upset</B>
<BR><B>or hostile - you feel it.</B>
<BR><B>I think, if it is Mr. Brown, that he is here watching</B>
<BR><B>over his building.</B>
<BR><B>So, last week, my friend and I were coming in to the</B>
<BR><B>building, up that front staircase.&nbsp; I had not said</B>
<BR><B>anything to her about Mr. Brown.&nbsp; We walked down that</B>
<BR><B>hall, and up the next to my office.&nbsp; Once we were</B>
<BR><B>inside, I told her about him.&nbsp; All I said was, "So, I</B>
<BR><B>think I have a ghost in this building....."&nbsp; She said,</B>
<BR><B>"Is he an older guy hanging out in that front hall?"</B>
<BR><B>!! I was glad she saw him too!&nbsp; We both kind of</B>
<BR><B>laughed about it, as we've both had a lot of these</B>
<BR><B>types of experiences, but I have to say, it was nice</B>
<BR><B>to have someone else see him... Kind of confirms that</B>
<BR><B>I'm not completely out of my mind.</B>

<BR><B>Multiple Hauntings On One Ship</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Dlinthe@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Would you believe a 400-ft ship could have so many ghosts?&nbsp;
I only encountered 7, that I can think of, and others had encountered more.&nbsp;
I was on an Icebreaker in the Coast Guard, and had come out of a very Christian
household where the supernatural was generally considered evil.&nbsp; Didn't
help that I had gone to a Christian school, as well.&nbsp; I was convinced
that my invisible friends from childhood, that still hadn't gone away,
were demons or something.</B>
<BR><B>But, amazingly enough, though people told me many stories, I only
had one contact with an entity while I continued my closed-minded ways.&nbsp;
It was a particularly malicious one, that seemed to feed off fear.&nbsp;
Fortunately, it was restricted to a particular section of passageway at
the far aft of the crew berthing in a section called Scientist's&nbsp;
berthing.&nbsp; I hated doing rounds after Taps, because it was inevitably
there.&nbsp; I would step through the hatch into that section, and every
hair on my neck and arms would stand on end, my scalp would feel like it
was crawling, and my heart would be painful in the way it thudded in my
chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Half the time, I would run through that section, the
other half the time, I would just not go into that very small section.</B>
<BR><B>Once I opened my mind to an awareness of that around me again, however,
things changed.&nbsp; There was a second presence back there, one that
I found while having a friend take a look back there.&nbsp; We could feel
it.&nbsp; It was calm and gentle.&nbsp; Then it exuded fear and disappeared,
as the other entity returned.&nbsp; He didn't know what to think of that
one, so we left.</B>
<BR><B>We went back there often, and the gentle one started taking on a
bit of visibility.&nbsp; There were three of us back there, and a fourth,
utter non-believer came back to see what we were staring at.&nbsp; After
Taps, the lights in the berthing areas are red lights, and none of the
lights were on in any of the rooms back there.&nbsp; In the middle of the
hall, however, was a very faint blue haze in the rough shape of a man about
6' tall.&nbsp; What was really trippy, and really got our attention, was
his reflection in the tile floor, that was brighter than he was.&nbsp;
He disappeared, and the fourth person, freaked out, left, so the rest of
us walked down the hall.&nbsp; I hit a comfortable spot and stopped and
my two friends turned around and stared in shock for a couple of moments
before telling me that I was standing right in the middle of it.&nbsp;
I already knew, and it seemed happy.&nbsp; Then it got apologetic, fear
tinging the comfort, and it disappeared into the wall beside me.&nbsp;
I moved toward my friends, and faced the closet on the far end of the hall
as it emerged.&nbsp; We couldn't see it, but it HATED us, we didn't feel
the fear reaction this time, just a wall of hate.&nbsp; We were carefull
about when we went back there and how often we stayed, but the scientists
that came on board often spoke of strange dreams and wierd nightmares.</B>
<BR><B>On to some more interesting ones.&nbsp; That was two of them.&nbsp;
My favorite story for me to tell is of the one spirit on that ship with
the ability to travel freely.&nbsp; He liked me, too, and we had fun.&nbsp;
His introduction to me was the most amusing, however.&nbsp; When crossing
the equator, the ship gets very over-warm in places, especially next to
the laundry room, where you take a deep breath on one side of the hatch,
and run through the passageway, through the door and up one flight of steps
before you take another breath.&nbsp; By the time you get through, you
are drenched in sweat, and it is the best way to the bridge.&nbsp; If you
breathe in this section, it is so hot, it is painful when it hits your
lungs.&nbsp; I was half-way through one afternoon, on my way to watch,
when I felt like I had passed through a wall of ice water.&nbsp; I stopped,
backed up, stepped through the area again, and it was gone.&nbsp; I stood
there breathing normally, it wasn't painful, then looked up and over my
shoulder and chuckled then said, "Damn ghosts....".&nbsp; I will never
forget the audible laughter I heard as I continued on, the sound cut off
as the door closed behind me.&nbsp; He was fun, and tended to warn me,
on occassion, when the ship's alarm was about to be sounded.</B>
<BR><B>Some other brief ones.&nbsp; There was always someone standing mid-watch
for the engineers in port.&nbsp; Dead or alive.&nbsp; During that time
frame, you could hear footsteps in the halls, and heavy hatches being opened
and closed.&nbsp; I had them walk right past me and heard the hatch in
front of me open and close without it moving.&nbsp; Pretty cool, I thought.&nbsp;
There was one on the bridge, a petty officer that had slipped and fell
during a storm and slid back and forth on the bridge.&nbsp; No one could
catch him, and he was dead before someone finally got ahold of him.&nbsp;
He can be seen in various places doing various watchstanding duties.&nbsp;
There is the figure in the aloft conn, visible from below.&nbsp; There
are things on the flying bridge where the look-out stands.&nbsp; They drove
one of my shipmates "insane" by whispering to her and appearing to be people.&nbsp;
She knew what it was, but it isn't something you tell the corpman on the
ship when he doesn't believe in such things.&nbsp; I kept my mouth shut
about what I saw up there.</B>
<BR><B>I know I said 7 on the ship, but it may have been 8, but I think
it was tied in to one of the other entities, I just am not sure which one.&nbsp;
I had the tendancy to wake up if anyone so much as touched the knob to
my room, which I shared with 5 other women.&nbsp; I woke up one night,
and my boyfriend at the time (I know, shame on me) was coming in to wake
up his watch relief.&nbsp; I could hear him, and he was right next to my
rack.&nbsp; I opened my eyes, and there was no light, from the red lights,
from a flashlight, nothing.&nbsp; I wasn't laying on a wool blanket, it
was a foreign substance, soft, yet firm.&nbsp; I reached my arms out to
either side, one to touch the wall, and one to pull my curtain back, and
touched nothing.&nbsp; In either direction.&nbsp; I tried to call out to
him to help me, and I could not open my mouth, and it felt like my voice
was utterly disabled.&nbsp; I tried to sit up, and the world spun around
me and dropped away.&nbsp; I woke back up later, to red lights, my curtain,
my wall.&nbsp; He came back into the room because his relief was running
late, she had gone back to sleep.&nbsp; I pulled my curtain back this time
and looked at him, then told him about it the next day.&nbsp; It happened
once more while I was there, but that time I couldn't move at all.&nbsp;
But it was far more brief.</B>
<BR><B>I have had other experiences, but those are just the ones that happened
