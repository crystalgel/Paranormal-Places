<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Antique Ring<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: Rhettgeorgia@aol.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello,I was just surfing the
net one day and I found your fascinating website,that was when I decided to
share the true story of our experience with the paranormal,only this doesn't
involve a house or property,it involves an antique ring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We live in Eastern Iowa,and
during the spring and summer months there are a lot of garage and estate sales
to go to,and our family being antique dealers it is a great way for us to find
new treasure,anyway,in August 2003 we went to a little town just outside of our
own,where they were having their town wide garage sales,little did we know that
we would bring home true evil that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The last sale we went to was
held in a large garage,all of the smaller items like jewelry and so forth were
put in sandwich bags,10 items to a bag for ten cents,my aunt and I bought
bought five dollars worth of stuff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When we got home we opened
up the bags and found,well,pretty ordinary and mundane items,nothing really
special,until my aunt found an incredible ring hiding in one of those bags.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At first we thought it was a
mere child's trinket,it seemed too good to be true at first,but then we cleaned
it up and realized,wow,this is something pretty special!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We went to the library and
got a book on antique jewelry,and to our great surprise we found the exact
ring,it was 10k gold,black onyx and diamonds,it was a a signet D ring and we
found out it was made between 1890 and 1910,my aunt decided to give it to her
father,even though his initial wasn't D he'd still enjoy it,she thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Two years earlier my
grandfather had purchased a car that was in beautiful shape and had never given
him trouble,but two days after he received that ring the car woulden't
start,pretty soon the transmission gave out,he had that fixed,then half a dozen
other things went wrong with it,he finally traded it off to a car dealer,who
drove it himself and never experienced anything unusual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At that same time my
grandfather also started to become physically ill,he would go to doctors and
even spend a few nights in the hospital and have tests done,nothing was ever
found wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">He also lost many good
friends,after showing them the ring for some reason they would never speak to
him again or not treat him in the same manner,he even showed it to a close
friend who was a high powered real estate agent,who had a strong buisness,less
than one year later the man delcared bankruptcy and had to quit real estate,he
eventually ended up selling cars at a local dealership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since that ring has been in
our possession my grandfather has had five cars break down on him,he has lost
friends,he has lost weight,he has been in and out of the hospital and almost
died once due to inexplicable and still unknown blood loss,he has survived
several car accidents and many more near misses,I truly believe that this ring
is a thing of evil,none of our lives have been the same since we have owned it,for
some reason the spirit inside the ring doesn't like cars or even people who
like them,my grandfather in his younger days was a master mechanic who built
his own custom automobiles,so we believe that the entity inside the ring has
targeted him for this reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Oh,did I also mention we
have a lovely Victorian ring for sale?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">What the Heck is That???<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This event actually occurred
back in the fall of 2002.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend and
I were both in nursing school together and we would get together in the
mornings and study for our tests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
taken my daughter to school one morning and I came back home to call my friend
on the phone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My three year old son was
sitting on my living room floor watching tv, and my husband had left for work
hours earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to call Crystal,
my friend, to see if she was going to come over so we could get some study time
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was on the phone out in the
kitchen, involved in a deep conversation, I have a mud room off of my kitchen
that leads to our cellar, and out into the backyard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That mud room door was opened that day
because I had been cleaning and had left the door open so I could transport
stuff into the cellar. Well, as I was talking, there came a very deep, long
loud moaning from down in the cellar. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Crystal</st1:City></st1:place>
on the other end of the phone asked me, "who the hell was that?" I
said, "you mean what the hell was that?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Crystal</st1:City></st1:place>
asked me if Mike, my husband had came home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As far as I knew he had not come home for anything, so I walked out in
the living room, where my son was still sitting, and asked him if daddy had
come in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son said, with no
hesitation, "no".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then got
back on the phone with <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Crystal</st1:place></st1:City>,
and asked her to come over right away, because I was scared that something was
in the cellar. I thought at the time, maybe some hobo had got into the house
and had made himself a place to sleep in my cellar. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Crystal</st1:place></st1:City> arrived very quickly with her
husband, to go check out my cellar with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We followed her husband down into my cellar, where we found nothing, we
checked the door that led out into the backyard and that was locked, so no one
could have got in anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That by far is
the strangest damn thing that has ever happened to me, I was too a skeptic, and
had my friend not heard the same thing as I did, I would be thinking I was
crazy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will never get that moan out of
my head, to describe in words is doing it an injustice,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It certainly sounded like a man, in pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Retelling this, gives me the creeps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know why it happened, but many other
things have happened since then that make me a firm believer in the
afterworld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The restaurant has changed
names and is now the Cowboy and the Captain in Apopka.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it was Townsend&#8217;s Plantation a group of
us went at Christmas time from a local school where we worked, two of us asked
if we could go upstairs and look around and they said sure , there was no one
on the second floor that night and we went to the third floor as we were
climbing the stairs my friend went thru the door way first and stopped, I
immediately got the horrible feeling that I needed to get her out of there, I
tried to go after her but I couldn&#8217;t enter the room ,it was as if there was a
force keeping me out. I screamed at her to stop, she said when she stopped
something put a hand on her back and chest like they were trying to hold her,
She turned and ran to the door grabbed my hand and we ran down all three
flights past the hostess whom we told the place was haunted and ran out the
door, the rest of our friends were waiting for us and laughed at us thinking we
were kind of kidding around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend
couldn&#8217;t talk at first and the hair on her neck and head was standing on end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We left and went shopping about an hour later
we were in a store and I looked down at my arm and said &#8220;OH my God I&#8217;ve cut
myself; there was a lot of thick dried blood on me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I wiped it off there was nothing there
so I tried to figure where it came from and asked my friend since when we ran
we had each others hands, here arm had caked on blood very thick and all over
the arm, we immediate went o the bathroom thinking she needed medical care, her
mother was with us and we wanted to see how bad it was so we could decide where
we needed to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we washed the blood
away there was nothing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
told that there had been a murder on those steps, I&#8217;ve no idea how we can
logically explain what happen, but it scared the hell out of us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">hi im from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">england</st1:country-region></st1:place> and we have ghosts here
too. my local church is haunted and me and my mates don't go near it at night
because the vicar who lived there owned a scottie dog and it got loose one day
and was ran over. me and my best bud adam went there to do a tour of the church
and i started screaming because i felt something tugging on my pants! this
totally freaked out my mate adam because the scottie dog hated girls. i haven't
been there ever since. here is another one a long time ago my nanny died from
cancer and on the night she moved on i had just been put to bed by my mum and i
had about three of my teddies placed on my shelf and while i was fast asleep
two of my teddies fell off my mum came upstairs about to tell me off but my mum
got the shock of her life she heard me whispering "bye bye nanny"
while i was asleep. i was only four. i am now 14. this last one is the
freakiest one ever i reckon i go to rivington and blackrod high school in
horwich and its been there for a very long time anyway there are four ghosts
who haunt this place and i don't like it there is the forgotten little boy in a
sailors suit he starved to death in an isolated room and he visits during
assembly. there is a pregnant teachers who died while giving birth to a baby
and you can still hear the baby screaming and the lady crying which really
freaks me out is in the woods near our school three monks hanged themselves to
death and you can still see a hooded figure in the woods and the worst one of
all is my own experience...while in the hall getting ready to perform i saw a
little boy crying on the stage<span style="">&nbsp; </span>saying
"forgive me forgive me "and i had to cancel the show because it was
too scary to witness whilst performing my mate heard him saying "play with
me <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This happened about three
years ago. Sara, a Paramedic, was on duty in Mena. They received a call to
respond to the Limetree Inn for a medical emergency. When they got there a man
who was in town on business came to the motel room door. He was very upset. He
handed them the room key and almost ran to the waiting ambulance. The other
paramedic told the man that they couldn't take him to the hospital unless they
knew what was wrong. He then told them that he had been eating his dinner and
looked up and saw a woman standing at the end of the bed. He thought that he
was hallucinating. The paramedics took him to the hospital but the doctors
never found anything wrong with him.As a side note that room had a previous murder
in it. A woman was beheaded by her husband on their honeymoon. He placed her
head on a bible and laid two quarters beside it. Many people have had
experiences in that room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi. My name is matthew
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have lived in wales all my life,
12 years. I recently moved to a place called <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">bangor</st1:place></st1:City>. My dad moved in to a house on top of
the street, with a ling hill going down. Me and my friends were going down the
slopes sitting on skateboards. Then from nowhere a huge circle of light
appeared. We started joking saying " The eye is coming" and stuff.
But that's when it started. Everytime you stepped/ crossed over this 'eye' you
suddenly tripped. Anyway, we carried on skateboarding. We then went over this
'eye' accidentally, and while going down the hill I fell of the skateboard and
scratched my knee. So we decided to test this. We got everybody availible at
the current time (5 people) to roll over the eye on a skateboard. Everytime,
you fell. Then I made the stupid remark of saying 'It pure eviiil!' making
everybody laugh, but to my despair. I Then went down the hill and my skateboard
swerved, and crashed into 2 other skateboards. We all fell off and one of my
friends got a slit knee, one broke his mp3, and I twisted my ankle. This is
bizzare, anyone else had something like this happen?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I remember the year was
1990, me and my family had just come to the States(<st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State>)
from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>(Coahuila).
I was like 5 years old at the time and I remember when we first came we were
living with my Grandmother on the outskirts of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Eagle Pass</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>.
The house was located on the end of town, and nothing but woods from our house
to the next. I remember one night it was like 3 a.m. my father had been outside
drinking with his friends in the backyard. He had woken me up(accidentally when
he came in and then he went to sleep.everyone else was asleep and I couldn&#8217;t
fall back asleep. I got up to use the restroom when I heard someone walking in
the hallway. Quietly I walked to the doorway and peeked out. In the darkness I
could see a small person(about my grandmothers&#8217; size&#8221;) walking slowly to the
doorway. Thinking it was my grandmother I called out, &#8220; Donde vas,
abuelita?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(where are you going,
grandma?) then the person turned to face me. It looked like a very old woman
with a paleness to her face that seemed to glow, a look of sorrow on her face.
All of a sudden, she broke down into tears&#8230;and disappeared right before my
eyes!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every once and a while, I have
recurring dreams of this event, though why I am not sure<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I moved into my house a few
years ago and have noticed "stuff" happening around my house. I
"see" spirits/ghosts. There is a family that lives in my house. They
are of a more friendlier sort though. I have been having a friend stay with me
that is an "open" port for ghosts/spirits. Well to make a long story
short, I got a new door with new frame which removed the old ward from the
house to keep evil/bad spirits out so one came in and we had to disperse with
it. My friend did get a name from it. We haven't been bothered with him
anymore. Since then my "family" has been more open to letting us know
who they were/are. We found out their names, the children's ages, found out the
father smoked a pipe, and drank moonshine. Found out the mother didn't like
smoking in the house. We also found out the father had lost a leg due to a
dogbite. The family go about their days like nothing is happening. They get up
in the morning, Mother cooks breakfast, they clean up, the children play while
Father goes and works in the barn and on the land. Mother cooks lunch, they eat
go back to what they were doing. Mean while the youngest child starts getting
sick. Mother starts crying, O er child wants someone to play with. The Mother
then cooks dinner and rings the dinner bell. And so on and so forth...... If
you need or want more info you can reach me by my email ...

your time and hope this helps in your search of finding ghosts in St. Marys, GA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

riverside hospital story, <st1:City w:st="on">trenton</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">michigan</st1:place></st1:State>. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>i was one of the last workers going to that
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i worked for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">wyandotte</st1:place></st1:City> hospital at the time as a
driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i had to go there one day to
pick up medical supplies that were left behind for us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was on the 2nd floor i was already nervse
about going to that floor because the 1st room off the elevator is were my
father had died in, 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the floor was
quiet and noone else was around, most of the light were off so talk about
freaky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as i made my way down the hall i

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Portland</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">OR</st1:State></st1:place>
there is a resturant on the east side of the river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rose and Raindrop is located at <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">532 SE Grand Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to deliver baked goods to the
restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a little background: the
building was constructed in 1891.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
what the manager, owner and one of the cooks told me the building was first
used as a mortuary and was the tallest building on the east side of the Willamette
River.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the course of time it was
turned into a vaudeville theatre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
top portion of the building is currently apartments but were once used as a
brothel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a little history lesson,
underground <st1:City w:st="on">Portland</st1:City> is full of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Shanghai</st1:place></st1:City> tunnels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These tunnels were used to transport victims
to work on ships; these tunnels were also used to transport humans for the sex
trade; most victims were drugged and men were usually drugged or knocked out
while visiting brothels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Willamete</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">River</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> has receded since 1891 and thus
the river bank is what seems to be far away now but at that time the building
was pretty much a block away from the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had always felt a creepy
feeling since the first time I had delivered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The baked goods were to be put in the cooler / fridge in the
basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As one walks down the narrow
and old stairs, a doorway is noticed in the middle of the stairway on the left
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once in the basement it feels even
creepier; there are doors towards the back of the basement that are secure and
locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was more curious about the
stairway door and thus I asked a cook and he told me the story of when the
building was used as a mortuary; it turned out the doorway led to the crematory
oven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doorway was not like a usual
one but rather it is wider and shorter, which made it easier to transport a
body into the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cook took me
down the stairs and opened the door and turned on the light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The oven still stood and an odd feeling
overcame me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was really freaky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another instance occured
when I had to walk upstairs to a mezzanine in order to get to the restaurant
office to collect a check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I walked
towards the office a sudden feeling of cold overcame me; it was september and I
think the restaurant had airconditioning this cold feeling was freezing and it
when away when I approached the office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did not see any airconditioning ducts--the restaurant may or may not
have had central air, most old buildings in <st1:City w:st="on">Portland</st1:City>
lack airconditioning because it doesn't get too hot for too long in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oregon</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Back to the cold spot: at another delivery
stop I encountered another guy who stops by the Rose and Raindrop for bug
spraying (no, the restaurant does not have bugs, it's just something that is
scheduled for restaurants) and told me when he walked through the main room,
towards the bar to collect cash, he glanced up at the mezzanine and saw a woman
in white.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he got to the bar he
asked the bartender who the woman was and the bartender answered that it was
just a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guy told me another
time he was in the bar, talking to the bartender and saw a guy walk into the
bar, wearing a pinstripe suit and was very slick-looking, the man smiled at the
bug guy and walked through the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One time I was down in the
basement putting the bread away and I started humming a song that was in my
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I was doing so a female
voice joined in but was singing a song I hadn't heard before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I threw the bread in the fridge and ran up
the stairs skipping every other step.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another time I was walking through the restaurant towards the bar to
collect money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I glanced towards the far
corner and saw a man, in a pinstripe suit and a rounded old men's hat--the
one's from the late 1800's and early 1900's--smoking a cigar, he smiled at me,
I even smelled the smoke--and I love it because I smoke a ton of cigars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got to the bar I asked the bartender
and he replied the man was a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
hadn't heard about the pinstripe suit ghost from the bug guy until about a
month after my experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My girlfriend has a friend
who used to live in the apartments upstairs and when I told her about my
experiences she smiled and told me that there was a ghost of a woman in white
that walked through the apartment hallway and would sing...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another time I was talked
with the owner and asking her questions about the building and she told me that
the building had <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Shanghai</st1:place></st1:City>
tunnels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I inquired more and she told me
that the basement I delivered to was only the first basement; there was a
basement below it where the embalming was conducted and below that were <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Shanghai</st1:place></st1:City> tunnels...creepy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I quit the job due to it
interferring with my education--the hours exhausted me--and so I hadn't been
back to the Rose and Raindrop for 3 months now.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My apartment building in NW Portland--built 1908--might be haunted;
there are servants quarters in the basement and I get the feeling I'm being
watched, but that is for another story...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

In the house I grew up in, there were numerous inexplicable things happen every
so often. For example, if I was standing at the foot of the stairs looking up,
I'd see a man in a black suit and top hat staring back at me from the top of
the stairs. At night, I'd hear footsteps in the hallway when no one else in the
house was awake. In my room, from the ages of 5-8 I'd see a black dog pacing
back and forth when I went to bed. Arriving home after family vacations, we'd
smell something putrid (like vomit) coming from the kitchen and would
mysteriously go away after 3 months. I'd talk to my family about the things I
experienced, and they, too, have added stories of their own. Needless to say,
there was indeed something in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi, my name is Kayce and I
live in <st1:City w:st="on">Hanover</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State>,
just east of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Newark</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a couple of stories I would like to
share with you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first one takes place at
an abandoned house on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Pine Bluff
  Rd</st1:address></st1:Street>, I'm not sure if it is considered Fallsburg or
Frampton but it's right down the road from Fallsburg pizza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you follow <st1:City w:st="on">Pine Bluff</st1:City>
you will come to a fork in the road, if you go left and across the bridge there
will be the continuance of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pine Bluff</st1:place></st1:City>
on your right, which is a dead end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
house is near the begining of the dead end of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is housed by trees so is hard to see at
night but easily found in the daytime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were rumors about the house being haunted and that if you went in
the house and left, when you cross the bridge you would see headlights behind
you until you were off of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pine Bluff</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time I went with my friend Meagan
and three others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meagan and I were the
only ones to go in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in
there for about 3 minutes and our flashlights both went dead so our friends
shined a light from the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We looked
around for a little bit and I peeked into a back room, there were broken down
beds in a concrete room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, what
appeared to be, blood on the stairwell and when I turned to look back at the
door I thought I saw a white figure walk across the side room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to go upstairs and the other light
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meagan and I decided it was time
to go but before we left we picked up a piece of paper that was laying on the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got where w could read
it, we found it was a page from a magazine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The date said March 8, 1942 which freaked me out a bit because my
birthday is March 8, 1986 but I chucked it up to a coincidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We left and did not see the headlights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About a year later, I came
back to show my cousins and boyfriend because their friends had told them about
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One said they were going
upstairs and it felt like something was pushing them back down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another said that they went upstairs and
there was a bloody mattress and when they came back to the car there were
little handprints all over the windows, it was winter, but no footprints in the
snow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had four flashlights with us
and when we got out to go in the house, only 2 worked and they both died not
long after we got into the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Luckily my boyfriend and I had lighters on us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cousin Jaynis said she saw a white figure
in the side room, just like I had, and we all heard a weird noise coming from
the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked out the side door
area and saw what looked like an animal eye but it was only one and it didn't
blink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I attempted to go up the stairs
again and my lighter wouldn't stay lit so we left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same cousins and I just went back there
last weekend (been about a year since we were there) to show their friend and
someone had burnt down the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
revealed a large pillar in the middle of the floor of the house that looked as
if it were made of cobblestone that couldn't be seen when the house was
standing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The second also took place
last weekend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cousins Jeanie and
Jaynis and their friends Jennifer and Josh and I were all looking for this abandoned
house we found a few weeks back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
thought it was on the right side of Flint Ridge Rd between Gratiot Rd and
Poplar Forks Rd but when we got there it was an abandoned trailer, barn/shed,
and what looked like an old g enhouse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were two cars parked in the weeds by the trailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a powerfull spotlight so we shined it
and looked around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it looked like a
light came on inside of the greenhouse but it was really dim, like a
candlelight, but it was only there for maybe a minute and went away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We turned off the light and heard something
that sounded like a scream or possibly moans, we weren't sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We started to leave and Jaynis thought she
saw the house past the trailer so we came back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She shined the light and there was a house covered in vines but it
wasn't the same one we saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned my
head away from the house and Josh and Jeanie said they saw what looked like a
shadow of a person walk out of the house, we were kind of scared so we left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ended up getting a little lost but ended
up on State Route 40 so I knew where I was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I took <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Mulberry Rd SE</st1:address></st1:Street>
to go back to Flint Ridge and at that intersection we were trying to decide
where we wanted to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked toward
Jaynis in the passenger seat and a white object appeared in the woods behind
her and looked like it was getting closer, she turned and saw it too so I shot
across to the other end of Mulberry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were going down the road and every so often it felt like someone was tapping on
our shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then we came to a large
white sign on the left side of the road, it said "Road Closed" but we
had just came from the direction it was pertaining to and there was a large
white object just off the road in the woods, it appeared to be stationary but I
didn't sit there long enough to find out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We were all pretty freaked
out that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now that I've come
across your website I will probably have stories for you often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I like to explore abandoned things and get
scared because it takes a lot to scare me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hope you enjoyed my stories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well this happened to me
when I was about 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents had just
bought a new house, and my boyfriend (now my hubby) moved into it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was a standard 4 bedroom house, i say was
because by the time it was finished being renovated, it was a far from standard
5 bedroom house with 4 bathrooms.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well, there was only one
decent livable bedroom in the original house, the others were just completely
spooky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In two of them you just simply
could not sleep, no matter what you did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The presence there was very disturbing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the other bedroom, it was just creepy, always icy no matter what time
of the year it was, and it radiated pure evil, we kept that door closed at all
times. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">But this story is about
rings of blue fire.........Yeah, I know it sounds nutty, but it wasnt even one
of those instances where you blink and it was gone, I sat and watched these
rings "float" all the way down the passage, beginning at the bedroom
end, and slowly floated all the way to the lounge door, the passage was about 6
or 7 meters long, and these rings of fire took about 2 min to float the
complete way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dissappearing as soon as
they got to the lounge door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
interlinking circles, kinda like the olympic games symbol, except there were
only 2 rings, and they were a blue fire, like gas fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only ever saw it once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Heaps of other things happened there, but
nothing like this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would be very
interested to find out if anybody else has ever had a similar experience.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My Experience in what I
believe was a Haunted House<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am a 30 year old mother of 4 children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also have a college education and consider
my self a reasonably intelligent person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Due to my upbringing however I was raised on the belief that there are
no such things as "ghosts".<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This belief was challenged, however, about 10 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Around the time I was 20 or
so, myself, my husband and our two young daughters rented a house that I
believe already had residents when we moved in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We thought we had found our dream home, because it had just been re-modeled
with new carpet and cabinets and the rent was very cheap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not sure exactly how old the house was,
but I'm pretty sure it was at least 100 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the walls were made of the old heart
pine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was one of those old floorplans
where all the rooms met back in the hall in a circular design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could access any room in the house
(except for the dining room) from this hallway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a hole in the middle of the hallway covered with an old
decorative tin plate where the pipe to the old heater used to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no plugs in the bathroom and we
had gas heaters and a window a/c for cooling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Though we never saw anything, we continuously heard noises and had some
strange (and sometimes very disturbing) occurences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also always an uncomfortable "feeling"
in certain rooms in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
feelings were always accompianied with cold spots when there was no reasonable
explaination for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only lived in the
house for about a year, but in this time we had quite a few un-explained
occurences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My husband's job hours were
from 3 - 11 p.m. and he worked about an hour from home, so I was home most
nights alone with my two children until around midnight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right after we moved into the house I began
hearing things after me and the girls would go to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main noises came from the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could hear the dishes moving around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pots and pans banging together, the
silverware drawer sounded as if it was being opened and then slammed shut
repeatedly. At first I thought one of the children had gotten out of bed and
was plundering around the house, but when I got up to investigate I found them
both in bed sound asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They slept
together in a room diagonal from my room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There's connected with the kitchen which is why I had thought it was one
of them. My husband said we probably had mice, but there were never any signs
or indications to support this theory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Anyone who's ever had mice knows they always leave evidence in every
drawer and cabinet in the house.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, after about 3 or 4 nights of these noises, I started
waiting up for my husband every night before going to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started teasing me about being paranoid
until his first night off and we went to bed around 9:30 or 10:00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were lying in bed and everything was quiet
when the noises started up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He rolled
over and looked at me with wide eyes and said "did you hear
that?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got out of bed to check
on the kids and of course they were sound asleep so he went into the kitchen
and checked all the drawers for mouse peels.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course he found nothing just as I had told him he would not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never teased me about being
"paranoid" again after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The house had three
bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband and I slept in one,
the girls slept in another, and we used the last one as a guest room and I kept
some of the kids toys in it also, so it was kind of like a toy room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original plan when we moved in was to
give the girls there own room, but neither one of them would sleep in the third
room at night without waking up and crying, so we just put both of their beds
in the second room and their toys in the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was something we found strange, but I didn't question it because
the room always seemed kind of creepy to me also, even though it was almost
identical to the other room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This room
was always unusually cold even when the rest of the house was hot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My husbands father lived in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State> and would
occasionally come to visit us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
did he would stay with us instead of in a hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We put him up in the back bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course after about 2 or 3 nights he
started sleeping on the couch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we
questioned him about it, he told us he couldn't sleep all night in that
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he would wake up constantly
and feel as if someone else was there with him even though he knew he was alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He too described the room as always being
cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Other people who stayed with
us and used this room always said the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husbands cousin stayed with us for a
couple of weeks and he wouldn't use the room either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had not mentioned anything about the room
to him, he just said he didn't feel right in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never felt as if he were alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Other stange things happened
after a few months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would leave the
house and lock both the doors, (no one else had a key) but when we would return
home at night every light in the house would be on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first we thought maybe we had left them on
and didn't notice it when we left because it was still daylight, but after the
first occurrence we would always make sure all the lights were out before we
left, only to find them on when we returned home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened on about 5 or 6 different
occasions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The noises, the lights being
turned on, and the strange feelings only made us relatively uncomfortable
because we never saw anything, but there were a few times (mainly when I was
home alone at night) that I was terrified of our visitor/visitors.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first time I can
remember being scared to the point I wanted to leave the house and not come
back was around 8:00 at night one night when my parents were babysitting so I
could have a little quite time since I was a full time mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was going to get us something for
supper at the store down the street and I was going to relax in the bath and
read a book while he was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started
running the water, got in with my book and my husband came into the bathroom to
kiss me good bye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I layed back in the
tub and started reading as soon as he left the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he shut the back door, every light in
the house went out at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a
cloudy night, so there was absolutely no moonlight or anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was pitch black (I couldn't even see my
hand in front of my face).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat in the
tub terrified to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not because I was
afraid of the dark, but because I felt a presence in the room with me, but I couldn't
see anything at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I huddled in the
corner of the tub and counted the seconds until my husband returned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I knew it shouldn't be long before he got
back because the store was only a couple of blocks away.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my husband returned, and he shut the
back door behind him, all of the lights came back on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped out of the tub and almost knocked
him down coming into the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said he had noticed all the lights were out when he drove back up in the yard
and wondered if the power had gone out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He thought that was strange however because all of our neighbors still
had power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened a maybe 5 or 6
other times, and it was always when someone was left there alone and someone
else would go out the back door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
husband thought maybe it was due to the old wiring in the house, but the lights
wouldn't come back on if the person left alone in the house would go and slam
the back door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights would only
come back on when the person who left the other person alone would come back
home and they would shut the back door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The third time it happened, my husband had once again left me alone to
go the store down the street, but this time I was in the living room watching
tv.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he left and shut the back door
every light in the house went out except for the lamp beside the couch in the
living foom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that night forward, we
would always leave this lamp on just in case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Every time it happened after that the outlet where the lamp was plugged
in was the only power source in the entire house that would work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could also feel the presence near you
every time this happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were
other stange things that happened in the house and other areas that would
always be cold even in the middle of the summer when it was 80 or 90 degrees
outside and we didn't have the a/c on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The main area this would happen in besides the back bedroom was in the
dining room just outside the kitchen entrance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The home also had a detached
garage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a small building that you
could barly navigate in when there was a vehicle parked inside of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had a narrow tool/storage area in the very
back of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It still had tools in it
from some of the previous residents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These were like turn of the century farm tools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never handled any of them, we just saw
them on the day we moved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We noticed
the door at the back of the garage and wondered what it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband cracked the door open and stuck
his head in to look around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't
get even remotely close to the door because it just felt like an evil presence
was in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even though my husband
would never admit it outloud, I know he felt the same presence because he never
opened the door again after that either, and he is just like any other typical
man who loves tools of any kind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He just
said they were none of his business and he left them alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only parked inside this garage on one
occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe the one and only
time we did use it was once when we went on vacation and did not want to leave
the car visible from the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we
returned home, I made my husband back the car out becaue I didn't even want to
get near the door in the back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well that is my one and only
ghost experience, and I know it is not that exciting, but I wanted to share it
with you none the less. Thank you for your time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

cousin moved her and told her i am moving you grandma<span style="">&nbsp; </span>your in the way so she put her in the
livingroom . one day when they were watering her they took her in the
kitchen<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and sat her in the middle of the
stove well she did not pay attention to it and put a pot of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>water on to boil and went into the other
room, when she came back the whole stove was shaking and jumping violenly not
what will happen when a pot of water goes on to boil but like an earthquake.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">hey. i saw that you had
metropolitan state hospital, in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">waltham</st1:place></st1:City>,
listed on your website. i grew up in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">arlington</st1:place></st1:City>,
and in high school there was a group of us that started going up there to
explore on friday nights. we got braver every time we went up there, exploring
deeper into the grounds, and eventually going into the buildings. i have so
many crazy stories about things i saw and felt up there. you can feel the most
overwhelming presence in the buildings. once, we had bought new flash light
batteries, and one by one, as we each entered this one room, all the flash
lights burnt out (the batteries were bought that day, on the way there). we
went into the tunnels a few times. you could clearly hear the sound of
something dragging across the floor behind us, it sounded like someone dragging
a sleeping bag. it followed us, almost as if chasing us, as we ran to get out.
that was truly the most terrifying thing i've ever witnessed. another time we
entered a room that was pitch dark and we could feel that we were walking in
something. you could smell burnt wood and it felt hot. in the dark, you could
see red embers scattered around. when we turned the flashlights to the floor,
the floor was covered in atleast 2 inches of fresh ash, with embers still red
hot. it was as if someone had been burning something in the room, yet there was
no sign of anyone, no sign of what had been burning. every time we were up
there, i could strongly sense being watched and being chased. finally, the last
time i went up there one of the guys i was with started smashing things, being
really disrespectful, breaking windows and furniture and stuff. i could feel
anger welling up around us, and the sense that whatever was chasing us was
angry and wanted to hurt us. i ran out of there with the sense that that was my
last chance and that if we went back we would be hurt, so that was the last
time. but i can never forget or explain w t i felt and saw up there all those
times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: marahawk@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It's my first time to this
site cos I was curious to know<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If anybody other then myself
had experienced what I had <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">and was amazed to see there
were lots of people that had these<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">strange things happen to
them. I was 5 years old, my sister a year older<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">and my older brother aged 9
as a family my mum and dad had taken us<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">on a holiday out of my home
town. We'd booked into a hotel for that night,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">for most of that day us kids
were playing with the other kids that were on holiday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It had gotten dark out and
we were sent to bed(after prayers of course). <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My dad was on my older
sisters bed telling us both a bed time story,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">for some reason I was
fixated to the area near the closet there was nothing there to see in the
physical but <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I couldn't take my eyes off
that area, something was there watching me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After awhile I had drifted
off to sleep, I woke up so bloody scared<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">there's no way to explain it
but I felt a presence in the room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was only the option of
looking to see who was there. Near the closet was a very tall dark shadow<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">of a man with no face just
black, knowing it wasn't my dad(my dads to short)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I got terrified, it gave my
an uneasy feeling like that only bad could come from this shadow, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was clear to see the
figure was walking toward me while I was laying in bed, shaking with nothing to
do but <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">pull the blanket over my
head and pray that this thing would go and leave me alone. After about five
minutes or longer<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I felt the dark figure lay
next to me on the bed, trying not to breath and just about in tears absolutely
scared s#*tless <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">seemed like forever that
this thing was laying next to me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
fear I kicked the black figure off the bed <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">there was aloud thump to see
if this dark figure was gone I looked<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">to where I heard the thump
no one was there and my sister was fast asleep. no sleep for the rest of that
night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">AND NEVER REGRETTED KICKING
THIS BEING OR WHATEVER IT IS!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Haunting that happened to Me
a Long Time Ago<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: dssm_1301@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My haunting happened to me a
long time ago when I was living at home with my Mom and Dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would say it started when I was young, but
I had a naive mind and didn't realize it until the happenings started getting
more real each time. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first happening I
remember is I was outside playing on a Spring day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Dad was working on something in the
garage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I clearly heard my name being
called from the garage and thought it was my Dad, so I ran in there to see what
he wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had gone inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked around the garage and no one was
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Dad is the only one who was
home at the time and could have been calling my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just marked it up as I was just hearing
things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another happening was when I
had my cousin over spending the night with me and we were sleeping in my
brother's room because he had a double bed and I only had a single bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were laying in bed talking and playing and
he said look and I looked at the window where she was pointing and there was a
hand in the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just a hand, we did
not see an arm or person. It was clear as day even though it was dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were scared as could be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ended up in the den sleeping on the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As I got older, my brother
moved out and I moved into his room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is when a lot of my happenings began.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a water bed and on several occasions my
bed would wave as if someone sat down, but no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one time, I got scared and I ended up on
the floor in my room and I was drifting off and I felt a hand on my
shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lot of this I just thought I
was imagining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then one night all I
remember is being in a sleep state and my mind started saying, "Help Me God!",
"Help Me God!" and I woke up and I could not breathe or move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried screaming out to my Mom and Dad, but
couldn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mind just kept screaming to
God.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It only lasted a few seconds, but
seemed like a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt as if
this spirit was trying to enter my body.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that time, I normally slept on my side, but from that day on, I could
only get comfortable on my back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
scared me to sleep on my back, I felt this was my most vulnerable position for
the spirit to try to enter my body again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I always ended up on my back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I slept in my parents room on the floor for at least a week after this
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in High School, so it
was embarrassing, but I was horrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
finally went back to my room to sleep, but I slept with my lamp on for SEVERAL
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did have one other occurrence
where I felt like this spirit was trying to enter my body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really never told anybody what scared me so
bad, I just told them I was scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I went off to college and
when summer came, I moved back home and I was up one night in the den late
becaus I couldn't sleep and my Mom came in the den and said something like,
"Oh, it's you, I thought I was hearing my ghost again!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked her, "What?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she began to explain how a couple of
times she had been reading and turned out the light to go to bed and my Dad was
not home, he was working and as she drifted off to sleep she would hear the
blinds in her room rattle as if someone was running their hand up and down the
blinds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like me, the first time she
thought she was imagining things, but when it happened again, she felt it was
for real. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That was in the early hours
one morning, so later that day we called my brother to see what he thought
about this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, too, had encountered
this spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he had even seen the
silhouette of a woman with long hair and a flowing gown at the end of his bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and his friend also saw her out in our
saddle house sitting on one of the saddles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mom spoke to some of her
friends about this and one of them told her to invite the spirit to church with
us telling it that this place would make it happy and we literally had to open
the doors for it and all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, my Mom dis
this one Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have told it out loud on
many occasions to leave me alone and go away that it was not welcome in my
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I don't know if it worked or
if it just quit bothering us, but it seems the happenings have gone away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Several years later, I moved
back in with my parents and I had my son with me who was 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel that he may have seen this spirit
because he would speak of the monster and point into thin air sometimes and act
really frightened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 2, it was really
hard to know if he really knew what he was seeing or if it was his
imagination?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, again, I told it out
loud to leave us all alone and it was not welcome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So that is my story and I
very much believe in spirits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Interesting and True<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I used to live in a house
that i was SURE that was haunted. i have little rothers and sisters so we had
artwork hanging up around the house. if things were dangling on srtings orr
something sometimes they would randomly start to swing VIOLENTY.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">also, one day when i was
coming home from school i had picked up my little sister emma and we came home.
i ssaw a man downstairs thinking it was my brother tommy. i said hey tom and
went about my business. about 15-30 minutes later my cvomputer monitor was
messing up so i was calliong him to come help me. he didnt respond. I went
downstairs to find that was wasnt even home?. i had slept downstairs with
friends and we have seen this strange man also. sometimes the TV woudl just
turn on. or switch channels. other times things would move by themselves and
once a ball bounced into the other room that i was in when i was home alone. i
left after that ha. almost every night at about the same time the cabentins in
the kitchen would slam and when someone yelled or went downstairs they stopped.
and lastly, one time i was going to the bathroom and someone started jigiling
and pulling on the door like they were trying to get in. i had locked it and i
thought it was one of my brothers and sisters. when i came out i asked which
one of them did it and my mom inormed me that they were down stairs with her
the entire time. i promise you im not lying and i am SO glad to be out fo that
house!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi My name is Vicky and I&#8217;ve
got a pretty interesting ghost story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This happened about 2 &frac12; to 3
years ago in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Midland</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Michigan</st1:State></st1:place>. The place where I live used to be
old logging area back way far back, and the hose is quiet old. (we are soon to
get a new house put on there.) But the whole 10 plus some acres has ghosts on
it. This story is about 2 of the ghosts one is a ghost of a small boy I would
say about 6 years old but small in size. He likes to come into the house and open
and close the DVD player and the computer CD <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">ROM.</st1:place></st1:country-region> He is a friendly ghosts but
the other which I have dubbed Mr. Kane (don&#8217;t know why).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a violent sort I have woken up in the
morning to have scratches on my arms and I&#8217;ve left a bell in my back yard and
its rung with no one around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m a bit
of a ghost hunter my self so I have taken a lot of pictures in and around the
house and property and I get a lost of ghosts orbs and mists. It&#8217;s a very
interesting place spooky but interesting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thank you for taking your time to read thins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many goddesses blessing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I live an old colonial home. in the past few months quite a few stange things
have happened to yself and a couple of friends who have stayed here. One night
i was woken by the feeling of something pushing on my chest and i couldn't make
any noise, feeling quite frightened i closed my eyes, next thing i knew i felt
like i was on the floor and someone was holding my chest and dragging me up and
down the room on the floor. it then stopped and i opend my eyes, nothing was
there. I left the room and slept in the lounge. a similar thing happened to my
friend in the same room after sleeping in the same bed. i had never told about
my story and we both freaked out when he told me. i have also been woken a
number of time by<span style="">&nbsp; </span>something pinning me
down and if i close my eyes it eventually stops. a few weeks ago my sister was
sleeping in this room on the same bed and her friend woke up to see the figure
of an old man bent over my sister. she said it was slightly transperent, she
closed her eyes and opened them again and he was still there. she was to
frightened to do anything and shut her eyes again than open them and he was
gone. this was her first time in the house and she had never heard any of the
stuff that had happened to me. Just thought i would share this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My grandmother, Nana, had
just passed away the week before. It was about nine thirty, and I was sleeping.
The lights weren't on in my bedroom, it was completely dark except for a little
light coming from the hall. I heard something either move or fall off my desk.
I wasn't in a deep sleep, so I opened my eyes. I began to smell smoke, not an
ordinary type of smoke. I kept thinking to myself no one smokes in the house,
all of a sudden I realized that the smell was of the cigars that my
grandfather, Bob, used to smoke. I turned over on my side to look over at the
desk area. I saw a puff of stormy grey smoke (in the darkness) and on the side
to that a figure standing (floating) there. I looked at the figure and I asked
my mom (who was not in the room), "do you smell smoke?" She said,"no,
it's probably Bob." I turned back to the figure and took a good look, it
was! He was wearing one of his two shirts, his white, brown, and blue pinstrip
shirt. I looked up towards his head and I saw his big Irish head. Since this
was the first ghost I had ever seen, I quickly went to my computer and shut it
off, just in case I was hallucinating, but when I unplugged it and stood back
to see if it had disappeared it was just standing there looking at me. Then I
layed back in my bed, he was still there. I turned over on my side, so I had my
back to him, and then a tingle ran threw me, I quickly turned around to see if
he was still there, and he wasn't.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That day when I got home
from school, I went downstairs to watch TV, Iooked on the coffee table and
realized that my drawing pad was there. I thought to myself I had rought it up
the night before, I'm more than positive. But then I sadi, whatever it was late
maybe I didn't. I went to go sit in our red recliner, and my entire right arm
stated to tingle. I didn't know what to do I just sat back down like nothing
happened, but I'm not stupid, I knew it was Bob.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I know my grandfather was
there to tell me that it's okay to be sad when someone dies, it's okay to cry.
He was there to help me through the grieving process. But the fact that the
next morning when my mother told me that my uncle had smelt his smoke in his
house two or three times and that my aunt had smelt the same smoke in her house
once before. But I was glad that I was the only one who actually saw him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is true that the original
orphanage burned to the ground. There are still off buildings on site that were
once the recovery / hospital areas. The adoptable children were housed in the
front "Fairmont Children's Home" that was destroyed due to an
unexplainable fire. The back buildings still exist. I have positive
photographic and audio evidence of paranormal activity in the remaining
buildings. Contact me and I will send proof positive photos of activity along
with accounts that accompany the pictures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am a security guard that
has pictures that are not explained by normal trespassers activity. I have a
collection of photos of paranormal activity in the infirmary and hospital
building of the Fairmont Children's Home. These areas still exist and the
energy of one entity is not pleasant. I'm still looking for the pocketknife
that appears in several photographs that I have taken. Trespassers are not
welcome and I would discourage any lone ghost hunters. I have recorded voices
that are not human in three places, 2 of them are not threatening, one of them
wishes to hurt trespassers. Ask me for the recordings and situation. There is
something here that will do you harm!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">on 22nd feb this year, my
grandfather passed away after a short fight with cancer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">An hour before he died he
asked the nurses to call the family and my nan and dad arrived within half an
hour. I had further to travel and arrived at the hospital minutes after he
died, which upset me greatly. On entering the side ward, I felt an over
whelming sense that he was still with us. I went up to his bed and held his
hand telling him how much I loved him and apologised for not being the at the
very end. I felt a faint squeeze of my hand as if he was reassuring me it was
okay, surprised I looked at his face and observed one last rise and fall of his
carotid pulse. It was as if he had finally left us, though the nurse said he
had died minutes before I came.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On monday 27th feb, my
23month old son, stood in the lounge talking to someone, he was alone, but I
heard him repeat several times "grandad, grandad" then he said
"bye bye grandad" and ran through to me in the next room pointing to
the lounge and saying "grandad gone now". This sent shivers through
me. I would really love to believe my grandad did come back once more to say
goodbye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: dlujano2@usd259.net<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When we first moved into our
house we noticed some strange occurrences. My daughter saw a "shape"
walking downstairs (It was white with black eyes) and my son saw a shape at
night (It was dark and transparent). His shape haunted him for two weeks. We
chalked this off as a child and his imagination. After about two weeks we were
a little more concerned. He informed us that this shape was choking him while
he was trying to sleep. We got a crucifix and My son has not seen the shape
since. Ithought I had seen a shape next to the piano, but discarded this as a
figment of my imagination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We had forgotten about all
of this until last night. I was sleeping and woke when I felt something come
into the room. At first I thought it was my husband, but he was already
sleeping next to me. I thought it must be one of the children, but all I saw
was a very dark, transparent shape. This shape was taller than the dresser and
wider than a person. Looking at the shape was like looking through vapors
coming off of the asphalt on a very hot day. I thought I must be dreaming...
(this all went through my head within seconds) but I saw my dog staring at the
same shape. She was also doing a throat growl at the shape. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I don't know why I did not
feel scared, but I went straight back to sleep. I was very tired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had forgotten about the
instance until later that morning when I saw my friend. She moved out of the
home where she and her mom lived because her mom died in the home, and she
swears her mom still lives there. Needless to say, the memory came rushing
back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I called my husband to let
him know what had happened. He said I was probably dreaming, but he agrees the
throat growl from our dog was strange. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">He went to the Christian
book store and got a few items. He played Christian music very loudly on the
stereo downstairs. Our dog rushed up the stairs and barked very loudly. He
whistled for her to come downstairs, which she did. Our dog ran back up the
stairs and began barking again. Our dog is not a barker. She is a lab who only
barks when she is outside and kids are playing on the street (and only when she
is already outside) or when one of our neighbors comes outside (and she is
already outside). She does not even bark when the pizza guy comes to our door.
The only time she barks or growls when she is in the house is when she sees the
light from a flashlight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I don't know what happened,
but it is a strange occurrence. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Oh, four couples lived in the house prior to
us renting in it. All four of these couples came and went within a 6 month
period. Nobody on our block knows why they moved, but they said we have stayed
here longer than anybody.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello. I have had one
experience I would like to share.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I went to my mothers
house, I left my 11 year old daughter alone in our house. She had complained
about seeing a ghost at the foot of her bed before, but I didn't listen to her.
I stayed at my mother's house for about two hours, and when I got home, I
discoverers my daughter on the porch, shivering uncontrollably. When I asked
her what was wrong, she just looked at me like she had seen the most terrifying
thing on Earth. Two years later, she finally told the terrifying story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She was watching TV, when
the set suddenly turned of, and in the black screen, she saw a reflection of an
elderly man, without a head. Then the lights turned on and off, doing so for
about five minutes. Then she heard a great, loud, evil laughter coming from her
room. At that time she ran out, and stayed on the porch for one hour and 45
minutes. After she told her horrifying tale, I just sat there, terrifyed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello, My Names Becky, From
Germany at the moment, Also am deaf.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well, i know its sound werid
or something, but its true i see a thing. While I moved in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> with my
family (my dads in the army). A house which is a bit old for sure, and quiet
big house too. So I went to my "New" bedroom with my sister, She
telling a ghost story( Fake story) which i hate it most. But She says that she
saw a ghost or smomething in down the basement, but i dont believe it, she tell
me go to ask dad if its true. So i went and ask dad, He says Yes its true, make
me a bit scare. So i told him liar! He show me around the basement in each
room, but heating room he went in and shocking, it frightin me. So my dad just
messin around, I thought it was real. lol. Next few days later, at late night,
all my parent went to sleep but me awake. So i went to basement and gets some
night PJ for me, But there is freezing. So i went and check heating room, But
while i opening the door, and i saw a face in the right corner whic i could see
in dark. But it freaked me out. There i could see is old fashion white dress,
land a bit ripes part in her dress, shes seem frighting, and sad. Her hair is
brown and a long waves hair. Just stand in the corner. it frighting me so much.
So i ran and ran to my bedroom. And tired to forget what i saw. Or even my
imagination? But couples months later, i sat and doing on computer, I hear
"bang" behind me. ( i know im deaf but it loud to me) So turn around
and see in toilet room, there a hairdryer on the floor and it switch
"ON". I thought myself "its impossible because there have a hook
on the wall which wont fall on the floor?!!" So i went and pick it up and
turn it off. I once told my dad about hairdryer. He says it only fall..but its
impossible. So he dont believe me, But i didnt tell him about ghost what i saw.
Im afraid that they wont believe me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Also, Back in past, about
1999. I went to Boarding school for deaf people. A called "<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Ovingdean</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hall</st1:PlaceType>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType>" in brighton <st1:place w:st="on">South United Kingdom</st1:place>. Ovingdean hall school was too old
cause there found the school was 1850. One day i wakeup by midnight and wanted
to toilet, but there about 20 steps from my room, and pretty dark, Im afraif
ran and switch the lights on in hallway, but i couldnt see. So there i could
see a little white cloud about 40 steps from me. But thing is i can see is
face, which look like a maid to me or something, So i ran into the toilet
room..and sit there for awhile. But i wanted to sleep. So i look around the
hallway, there is no-one, I ran in my room. I just thought if its my
imagination or it real..But i guess i seeing thing which i never see before!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My name is Katie , I live in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Galveston</st1:place></st1:City> where technically the whole island
is haunted. Anyway My dad and I love to go to the Victorian homes and check out
the awesome surroundings. In one home in particular The Ashton Villa, we heard
a million stories about how the daughter Betty Brown haunts the place, such as
she plays the piano, appears in a blue dress and likes to drop coins around the
house. The day we went was no particular day, just a sunny afternoon, we were
going on the ghost tours for their October special. No one else was on the tour
with. We had gone an October before and our tour guide told us a story about
how we was about to lead a tour and coins fell out of mid-air and onto a
waiting bench in the hallway. The tour guide also showed us a picture a couple
from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Austin</st1:place></st1:City>
took on their visit here, it showed a transparent woman with blond hair in the
window wearing a blue dress. I was in shock, that was also the place I was
standing on the tour. Anyway when we went this time we had a tour guide that
never really told us about the ghost stories and more about the house. When we
went to the top bedroom, which was the Brown's bedroom, she told us that she
only knew one story and that it was about the coins being scattered around the
house. She was talking about the furniture and told me to step back for a
moment and underneath me was a COIN! It was all broken down and was very green
and dirty and had so many dents that you could hardly see the face of the man
on there. One of the weird things about it was that the cleaning service came
in and vacuumed the whole place before we came, so it couldn't possibly be
dropped by anybody but Betty. The woman let me keep and I still have it to this
day. For some reason i think Betty sees something special in me and My father
and I have now started a tradition, whenever its the Anniversary of Betty's
death we always leave a Cigar and a Rose for her to enjoy by her grave. (Betty
was an avid smoker).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I believe this story isn't
scary, its just really, really cool.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Kari<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a story to tell you. First, I have to
tell you my dad died in 1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my
daughter was 3 months old, she was saying "granddaddad." My mom always
kept our family photo, which had me, age 8 and my parents. When my daughter was
2, my mom asked her where was grandpa, and she pointed to an empty doorway and
said "granddaddad."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have been reading your
website for a while and feel its time to tell my story its not scary like other
but true none the less.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 3 experience I have no
connection with each other ( as far as I can tell)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was about 8 my
granddad died of course this was a terrible time for the family especially my
Mum ( a right Daddies girl).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About a week after he died I
remember waking up suddenly out of a deep sleep. ( I could sleep for <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> so it
takes a lot for me to wake)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I woke up seeing this
glowing from my room ( my head was under the cover), the glowing was too dull
to be my bedroom light and thinking my mum had come in during the night to
check on me and left the door open I pull my head above the covers and saw my
Granddad standing there next to my bed looking at me with a faint glow around
him. Even though it was my granddad and I know he would have never had hurt me
I was scared and dived back under the covers, from the gaps in the cover I
could still the glowing but after a couple of minutes ( which felt like a
couple of days) the glowing disappeared and was replaced with darkness. Somehow
I managed to get back to sleep. Now I didn't tell anyone because<span style="">&nbsp; </span>being that he had just died I thought I would
upset my mum and I also felt guilty for being scared of my granddad. A couple
of weeks past and I can kind of forgotten.. until I was at my mums friends with
my mum, I was more interested in annoying my younger brother and listening to
them but one conversation caught my ears she was telling her friend that a
couple of weeks ago she swears she saw her dad in her room one night. I then
proceeded to tell my mum and her bewildered friend that my she did she him
because I saw him too. Together we managed to narrow the experience to the same
night. Its nice to know that he came back to say goodbye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The second experience I had
is really hard to explain and I hope you follow me. I was about 17 and was
lying on my bed at home ( this will sound strange) and I thought I was
dreaming, I was dreaming I was at home in my bed ( which I was, its hard to
explain). Again I had my head under the covers ( I often sleep this way) and I
heard two children come into my room and start running around my bed I could
hear them giggle and could feel the movement the the covers as the ran past. I
felt them start to climb on the bed I could feel the covers tighten with their
weight, as I said I thought I was dreaming all of this and tried to wake my
self up after what seemed like forever the mental struggle I was having lifted
and I could no longer hear or feel them, now thinking I had just woken up I
relaxed and all of a sudden it started happening again but this time I could
feel the weight of these children climbing on me and their giggles getting
louder. I knew I was awake this time but now I could not move I was paralysed.
The children continued playing on me for what felt like hours ( never hurting
me) and then it lifted all was silent and calm again. I don't really know what
to think of this. Is it just my imagination? Just to let you know my brother
was 15 at the time and not in the house and I do have a little sister but when
this happen she could not even crawl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The third experience I had
was nothing huge just weird. I am now 23 and this happened last year. I no
longer live at home, I was in my bedroom and I was falling asleep my boyfriend
was fast asleep next to me ( he is the sort of person that as soon as his head
hits the pillow he's out) I was just drifting and was more asleep than awake
when all of a sudden I heard my name being shouted but not as if it was me
housemate from another room but right up close against my head ( without
sounding like I need to be admitted ) in my head. it was so loud and clear it
startled me awake and it took me about an hour to go back to sleep. I had to
sit up with the light on and have a cigarette just to calm my nerves. Obviously
my boyfriend who was still fast asleep next to me would be the prime candidate
but the voice didn't sound like his and he was still fast asleep and he's not a
very good actor.( they type of person that constantly grins when they are
trying to convince someone of something that's not true).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well those are my stories
sorry if there boring. if you have any theories as to what the 2nd and 3rd
experience might be/mean then feel free to email me back I would love to read
your opinion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I hope this is where you
tell you my story. And get it on your site if not sorry. I am new to your site.
Anyways here goes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was living in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Cicero</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">IL</st1:State></st1:place>,
at the time it was me my sister and my step sister. We all shared a room. And
my parents were in the room next to us. It all start about a month into us
living there. My sister started waking up o feeling like someone was watching
us. And one night I woke and sat up in the bed and looked around and when I
look at our closet which was right at the foot of the bed I saw knifes thrown
at me. When I ducked they disappeared into my parents room. The next morning I
told my sister what I saw. We couldn't believe what was going on. We told our
parents and they told us that we must have been dreaming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next thing we started to
see was when we were taking our showers. When I was in there I was washing my
hair and when I opened my eyes I was a red face looking at me. I ran out of the
shower and to my Dad. He thought we were playing a game on him. About a week
ter that had happen my sister was walking behind me in the hallway we were
going to school in the morning. All of a sudden she screamed and push me down.
She said that she saw a hand coming out of the kitchen and going for me. Our
parents were getting so mad at us thinking we were playing with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That was until one night. My
step mom at the time had a small dog that would sleep in the room with them and
when he had to go out he would scratch the door. One night my Dad hear his
scratching the door and he said when he leaned over to open the door, he said
he saw a little red and black figure looking at him. He said it was saying
something he couldn't understand. And then it walked into the wall into our
room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next morning our Dad
told us what he saw and told us he was sorry we moved the next week. We found
out later that the lady living behind us was a devil worshiper. That's might be
the reason why we saw all kind of freaky stuff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My son has lived<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in woodstock ct since oct 1st of 2005.He and
his friends have had several experiences in the small apartment in the back of
the very old building where he has rented with his girlfriend,the last of which
caused him to move out immediately.While he was laying down in bed this past
Wednesday night,fully awake,it felt as though someone was pushing down hard on
his chest and holding down his neck.He could not move or speak,but tried to
talk to his girlfriend,who was laying next to him.All she could hear was some
mumbling which she could not understand,and she said he was freaking out.The
room was ice cold,and it had been very warm just moments before,as the heat was
on.This episode started and stopped abruptly,as had the other two previous
occurances.Later that day when we went to move some of his things out and only
his friend was in the bedroom sitting<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on
the bed,he suddenly felt something grab his leg from underneath the bed.I was bringing
one cat outside and my son had the other cat in the living room.After we
brought the items to my house and put them in his bedroom,he and his friends
decided to go to another friends house.On the way home he suddenly felt
something grab his leg and saw the electrical looking outline of a male figure
in the vehicle.There was a church straight ahead of them so he told his friend
to go to the church.As soon as the headlights shone on the statue of Jesus this
incident stopped.They went inside the church and stayed for a while.When he got
home there were red marks on his leg where he said he was grabbed.There have
been numerous other times that they have told me of unexplained noises
,electrical disturbances, and objects moving for no apparent reason in the
apartment.As a scientist I will be trying to look for rational reasons for
these occurances,but after interviewing my son and his friends,I am concerned
that the conclusion I will come to is that thi house is haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I remember being about 4 or
5 years old and living in Evergreen, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>.
We lived at the base of a mountain in a small amount of forest area about 3
miles or so from town. I never remember sleeping alone in my room because I
would see thing, people, ect. I remember sleeping with my mom and dad one night
and hearing something wake me up. I looked to their bedroom door and saw those
old saloon doors. They began to swing slightly and then I saw cowboys walk
through them. I remember vividly the colors of their shirts, their dirty cowboy
hats and the guns in their holsters. I was so scared I couldn't move as I
watched 15 to 20 men walking through the door and disappearing right passed the
middle of the bed I was laying in. I always thought I might be a little crazy
but that is so much detail that I remember, and I don't like westerns so I know
it wasnt a tv show I am remembering. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Also, about 2 years ago, I
lived in a trailer house that was haunted. My glass angels would move, and I
would fix them back in the position I wanted them in and go back later and they
would be facing the opposite direction. I once was on the computer and had the
tv on too, the tv turned off and I turned around and said, "Just because I
sn't looking at it doesn't mean I wasn't listening." The tv turned back on
within 2 minutes and I was alone in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thanks for listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have two experiences I
would like to relate. Both happened to me between the ages of about 17-19, and
both were somewhat recurring. One I would consider to be scary, the other not
so much. I will begin with the former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was 18, I was living
with my parents and tensions in the house became very severe. I came back late
after a night of heavy drinking and found the doors locked and the doorbell unanswered,
so I ended up sleeping in my car. When I came back the next day, I was informed
that I was no longer welcome. I spent awhile bouncing from friend to friend
until an idea occurred to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My fathers mother was living
in a nursing home due to advancing dementia, and her husband had died of lung
cancer about five years earlier, in the very residence I will speak of later.
For whatever reason, I had a key to this house on my keychain, so I decided to
start taking advantage of it a little bit. I do not know why all the utilites
were still left on, as my grandmother had been in the nursing home for some
time with little hope of recovery, but I suppose in retrospect that it was my
fathers way of keeping hope alive. Anyway, sorry to ramble for so long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am not sure exactly when
it started to dawn on me. There is no one certain experience in the house that
sticks out in particular, just the same things over and over. In the house, I
could never escape the strong feeling that I was being watched, and that which
was watching me did not welcome my presence. It followed me day and night, but
especially night. Sometimes it wo d become so intense that I would shiver and
goosebumps would run all over me, while my heart thumped intensely and my
pupils diallated. I suspected my grandfather, and the presence was especially
strong in his old room. It became so powerful that I was afraid some nights to
walk down the hall, past the master bedroom to reach the room that I slept in.
I would wake up in the middle of the night with this picture in my head, this
picture of something quickly levitating down the hall to get me, and when it
reached me, I would wake up, covered in sweat. This happened often enough that
I didnt sleep in the back room very often, and instead took to sleeping in the
front room, on the couch, with the television on. Sometimes, I was even afraid
to go into the kitchen, which was adjacent to the television room but not the
hall or any bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I figured that this was all
in my head. After all, I had prior knowledge that my grandfather had died in
this house. Surely my mind was playing tricks on me. It seemed the only
rational solution. I told no one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A friend of mine, David, was
a semi-regular visiter. He usually brought along his girlfriend of the time, and
his son from another woman. After a time, I worked out my differances with my
parents and moved out of the house. However, sometime after,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David was looking for a new apartment, and
needed somewhere to stay in the meantime, so I offered him the key. He never
really went into the specifics of what they experienced there, but described
many of the same things that I went through. His son seemed especially
frightened of the house, and refused to enter the former bedroom of my
grandparents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The house has long since
been sold. I have no way of going back to investigate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Was this all in my head?
Maybe, theres no way to know. I had prior knowledge. but David did not. Did I,
through a slip a the tongue let him know what I was feeling? Possibly. Was my
grandfather really haunting hi former home? Is he still there? I suppose <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ill</st1:place></st1:State> never know for
certain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I think <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ill</st1:place></st1:State> save the other story for another night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My grandparents moved to the
small town in south-central Arkansas, where I grew up, in the late 60&#8217;s there
my grandmother bought this old two-story farmhouse (before my grandfather had
seen it, different and funny story) that hadn&#8217;t been lived in; in God only
knows how many years, on 66 acres. At the time the house was black and there
were chickens living in the kitchen cabinets, the boys (my father, his 2
brothers, their friend, and my grandfather) had to clear out most of the
property with machetes. They found old cars, chicken coops, ect. you can just
imagine with an &#8220;abandoned&#8221; house. Well once the house was restored to its
original glory, they found that they had a diamond instead of a lump of coal.
This is the house that they have lived in ever since, and the house I grew up
in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well one night I was asleep
in my bedroom at the left-end of the hallway upstairs and was awaken by the
feeling I was being watched. This wasn&#8217;t unusual I had always felt like I was
being watched in the house, but that night I opened my eyes to see the full
face and body of a man over me (remember I&#8217;m laying on my back in bed). The
thing is I didn&#8217;t feel the weight of a body on me so I was confused. I yelled
at the top of my lungs to &#8220;get the f*&amp;^ out of here&#8221; and the man
disappeared. By the time I had said that my grandmother, who slept of the first
floor was up in my room asking me who I was yelling at? When I told her she
looked at me like I had lost my mind, and then we heard my sister in the next
room scream. When me and my grandmother went into her room she had recounted
the same story. This time my grandmother looked at both of us like we had lost
our minds. Well not 2 minutes after my sister had calmed down we hear my
grandfather who is wide awake by now, and downstairs tell somebody to get the
hell out of the house. We all run downstairs, and by the time we get into the
dinning room, which is at the foot of the stairs and through a hallway door
(total time to get in the dinning room less than a min) my grandfather is white
as a sheet and says &#8220;I just saw a man walk through the wall&#8221;. By that time my
grandmother just says &#8220;it&#8217;s <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Casper</st1:place></st1:City>
now all of you go to sleep&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Casper</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> is what we had always called the &#8220;ghost&#8221; in our
house. Even when he was hovering over us (literally) there was never a since of
fear, it was more of us being annoyed with him than scared. The best way I can
describe it is a brotherly feeling, a protector of sorts. That was the only
time I ever saw him fully, but to this day his face is burned into my memory.
He was white, stocky build, young (about my age, I was about 17), with the most
unusual blue eyes, there was a cut on his head and his throat was slit. I
haven&#8217;t been able to find out who he really was or where exactly he died, but I
would like to. There really isn&#8217;t anything to go off of except that he was
dressed in late 20&#8217;s early 30&#8217;s style clothes. Almost like a gangster. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The whole time I was living
with my grandparents, and from the stories I have been told he has always
&#8220;haunted&#8221; the house. He has never spoke, and really doesn&#8217;t seem to be looking
for anything. Most of the time he is felt rather than seen, and usually when he
is seen there is someone outside snooping around the house. I think it is a
warning that there is a prowler or someone trying to break in. The few other
times I saw him was just out of the corner of my eye when I would turn to look
to say hi, I would see a very different shadow and know that a real person was
trying to get in. Living in the county there was always some drunk either
coming to the wrong house thinking it was his or up to no good. One night when
I was about 5 or 6 he appeared just before someone tried to light our barn on
fire. My father and grandfather were warned in just enough time to stop this
from happening. That is why we call him <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Casper</st1:place></st1:City>,
because he is a friendly and helpful ghost, and I hope to see him again one
day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Al Capone was know to visit
the near by city of Hot Springs, AR to take the baths, and in the late 20&#8217;s and
30&#8217;s the place where my grandparents house is was in the middle of no where.
Lord only knows what went on out there. Who knows maybe on one of my visits
back home I will see him and ask.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
