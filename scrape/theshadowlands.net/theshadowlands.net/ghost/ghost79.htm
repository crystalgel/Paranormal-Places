</H3><P>
<P><B>By: lwalenius@ramadvisors.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've had quite a few ghostly experiences over my life, all of which
have</B>
<P><B>been rather benevolent, Except for one that happened a few years back.
I was</B>
<P><B>24, living with my mother, my sister and my 2 year old niece. One night
I</B>
<P><B>woke up, and looked up into the darkness. This "thing" flew down from
the</B>
<P><B>ceiling, straight at me with its arms out (I can still see it). It
looked</B>
<P><B>like a cross between a gargoyle and an alien, it looked so evil. It
sounds</B>
<P><B>silly, but I was so terrified, that I ran out of my room (screaming)
into</B>
<P><B>the living room to be with my mother. I was shaking uncontrollably,
and I</B>
<P><B>sat with her for quite a while before I could convince myself that
it was</B>
<P><B>"just a dream", and I went back to bed with no further problems.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, a few months down the road, my sister was at home with her
friend,</B>
<P><B>Kelly - who seems to have some sort of connection with the paranormal,
like</B>
<P><B>her mother - and she sent her down the hall to get a towel for my niece
(the</B>
<P><B>linen closet is down the hall in my mother's room). Kelly came back
a couple</B>
<P><B>minutes later, white as a sheet. Now, my sister and Kelly are always
talking</B>
<P><B>about stuff like this, but this is what really freaked me out. She
said that</B>
<P><B>there was something in my mother's room, and it was a threatening
presence.</B>
<P><B>She then went on to describe it: about 3 feet tall, gray, kind of a
cross</B>
<P><B>between a gargoyle and something. I had never mentioned anything to
my</B>
<P><B>sister, and the only thing I had told my mother is that something scared
me.</B>
<P><B>I had never described what I saw to anyone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In another related incident, prior to my "sighting", my mother was
trying to</B>
<P><B>sleep one night in her room, and as she is about to fall asleep,
something</B>
<P><B>breathed near her - kind of a sharp exhale "Hah" right in her ear.
She woke</B>
<P><B>up the next morning with scratches on the middle of her back, and the
freaky</B>
<P><B>thing is, she slept alone, and there were only three, long (about 6")
thin</B>
<P><B>scratches on her back.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Needless to say, I am very happy to be out of that house!</B>

<P><B>Johnny</B>
<P><B>By: judy@earthlink.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure this qualifies as a ghost story, but it was more than
an</B>
<P><B>ordinary dream.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My cat Johnny, my sweet silver badboy for 10 years, died at home of
an</B>
<P><B>aggressive cancer in March. During the month between his diagnosis
and</B>
<P><B>his death, I showered him with even more attention than usual so by
the</B>
<P><B>time he passed away, we were closer than ever. On several occasions</B>
<P><B>(including at his grave just before burying him) I invited him to
come</B>
<P><B>back and let me know he was ok.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A few nights after his death, I was aroused from a dream by the sound
of</B>
<P><B>Johnny's meow coming from the direction of his special spot at the
foot</B>
<P><B>of my bed (coincidentally, his grave is about 30 ft further in the
same</B>
<P><B>direction).  I waited with a mixture of hope and anxiety to feel him</B>
<P><B>walking up my body to my face, but it didn't happen. Instead, I
became</B>
<P><B>aware of something tickling my left ear and tried to reach over to
pet</B>
<P><B>him, only to find that I was paralyzed. That's when I panicked,</B>
<P><B>remembering all the scary ghost stories involving a period of
paralysis,</B>
<P><B>and I finally awoke completely.  Nothing was abnormal except for my</B>
<P><B>pounding heartbeat.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I know everything that happened could be explained away as just a
dream,</B>
<P><B>including the inability to move, and perhaps that's all it was. But
the</B>
<P><B>sound of Johnny's voice was so vivid and unrelated to the dream I was
in</B>
<P><B>at the moment, that I can't help but wonder if it was real. Perhaps
he</B>
<P><B>could only come to me in my dreams.</B>

<P><B>The Coal Shoot</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: ppolet@vanisle.net</B>
<P>
<P><B> After you read this experiance you might think I'm crazy or something
but believe me, it was</B>
<P><B>the most terrifying night in my life and it has taken me alot of time
to get over </B>
<P><B>it. Before I moved out (about a year ago) I lived in a 100 year old
house. It had two </B>
<P><B>floors and my family only lived on the top floor. We barely ever went
into the basement because </B>
<P><B>the floors were all rock and there were no lights down there. One day,
</B>
<P><B>when I was about 15, I had a friend to sleep over and we thought it
would be </B>
<P><B>cool if we slept in the basement and told ghost stories. We gathered
up </B>
<P><B>our sleeping bags and our candles and went down to the basement. As
soon </B>
<P><B>as I entered the room we were going to sleep in I immediatly felt as
if we were </B>
<P><B>being watched and I told my friend that I thought that we should maybe
sleep </B>
<P><B>upstairs, but she just told me to quit being a wimp and to set up my
sleeping </B>
<P><B>bag. As we stayed up and talked and laughed (we never did tell ghost
</B>
<P><B>stories) I felt more comfortable and fell asleep easily. In the middle
of </B>
<P><B>the night (I remember this so clearly because it scared the s**t out
of me so </B>
<P><B>bad and I'm absolutly positive I wasn't dreaming) I woke up to knocking
coming </B>
<P><B>from one side of the house and slowly getting louder and closer and
right when </B>
<P><B>it was so near that it was shaking the ground there was a big crash.
and it went </B>
<P><B>away. I sat up straight in my sleeping bag and my whole body was </B>
<P><B>trembling. After I calmed down a bit a figure appeared at the foot
of my </B>
<P><B>sleeping bag and I froze, I couldn't move I couldn't scream I couldn't
do </B>
<P><B>anything. The figure was of a man dressed in rags that were covered
in </B>
<P><B>coal He stared at me as if he recognized me from somewhere and then
his </B>
<P><B>eyes widened and he exclaimed with a gasp  Mary Beth! Mary Beth! Help
me </B>
<P><B>I'm trapped and ran to the coal shoot frantically then dissapeared
</B>
<P><B>with a flash of light. Apparently my friend had woken up right when
he </B>
<P><B>disapeared and saw the flash of light. The next day I told my parents
and </B>
<P><B>they said that they had felt a presence down in the basement earlier.
I </B>
<P><B>read up on the history of our house and found out that the mistress
of the house </B>
<P><B>was named Mary Beth and her picture resembaled myself One of her servants
</B>
<P><B>had been trapped in the basement and tried to climb out the coal shoot
without </B>
<P><B>succeeding and after being trapped for about three days he died in
an unexplained </B>
<P><B>fire accident while in the basement. Thank you for taking your time
to </B>
<P><B>read this.</B>

<P><B>The Ghost in the Venetian Palacio</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: sugarek@cbc.cc.tx.us</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Hi! I have another ghost experience for you. In </B>
<P><B>March of 1994, my husband, oldest daughter, and I visited Venice. We
booked </B>
<P><B>at room at an ancient palacio. We were assigned a room on the 2nd </B>
<P><B>floor overlooking a canal. The view was accessed by opening the </B>
<P><B>heavy wooden shutters which opened into the room. These had a metal
</B>
<P><B>rod which fit into a u-shaped hook on the other window. Opening out
were </B>
<P><B>double windows, also heavy, with numerous panes of glass. This room
had </B>
<P><B>double beds with a narrow walkway between them.</B>
<P><B>About 3 times during our two days there, we would </B>
<P><B>hear footsteps start from approximately the middle of the room, march
</B>
<P><B>smartly over to the windows, at which point the wooden shutters would
</B>
<P><B>fly open. We would track this phenomenon with our eyes, but saw nothing
</B>
<P><B>and felt no fear. The first time we rushed over to the windows to check
them. </B>
<P><B>These shutters were so heavy that we felt it doubtful that a gust of
wind was </B>
<P><B>blowing them open, and the glass paned windows remained shut and seemed
</B>
<P><B>pretty air tight. The catch was not all that easy to work, either.
My </B>
<P><B>daughter, then 14, remembers having to struggle with it to open it.
Even my </B>
<P><B>oh-so-logical and mechanical husband looked over the shutters and could
</B>
<P><B>come up with no good explanation.</B>
<P><B>The last night we were there, we retired for the </B>
<P><B>night with my husband and I in one bed, and my daughter in the other.
She and </B>
<P><B>I could hold hands in the space between the beds, they were so close
</B>
<P><B>together. Right after lights out, we heard the footsteps, this time
walking </B>
<P><B>up between the beds to where our heads were. We could hear breathing.
We were </B>
<P><B>both too scared to do anything, but we certainly compared notes the
next </B>
<P><B>morning! </B>
<P><B>I wanted to ask as we were checking out if the </B>
<P><B>place was haunted but the only folks on duty that morning didn't speak
</B>
<P><B>English and we don't speak Italian. But we'll never forget the place!

<P><B>Quaker Cemetary</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>By: bpcoffey@gis.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>About ten years ago (when I still lived in Pennsylvania), a group of</B>
<P><B>friends and I took a joy ride out to the Quaker Cemetary just for a
good</B>
<P><B>night's scare.  It was a chilly, full moon-lit November night and
there</B>
<P><B>were six of us there - 5 guys and me the only girl.  It was the
perfect</B>
<P><B>setting for a ghost.  Now, I don't know how many of you readers have</B>
<P><B>ever been to this cemetary, but to describe the first time I saw the</B>
<P><B>place, I screamed and just about curdled my boyfriend's blood!  The</B>
<P><B>crematorium scared me the most, I don't know, something about the way
it</B>
<P><B>looks and what it was used for.   Anyhow, back to that night - two
of</B>
<P><B>the guys were acting like morons and jumping all over the place and</B>
<P><B>around the markers inside the cemetary.  I was angry at their pure</B>
<P><B>disrespect for this very old place and so I tried telling them to
stop,</B>
<P><B>but of course, as excited as they were getting, they wouldn't listen.</B>
<P><B>Me and this other guy were too chicken to go along with them,
especially</B>
<P><B>because of the way they were acting, they were bound to disturb peace
in</B>
<P><B>the cemetary, so we stayed by the car.  We kept hearing a fake bird
call</B>
<P><B>coming from the trees along the opposite side of the road and then
I</B>
<P><B>started smelling lilacs.  The lilac scent somehow wasn't disturbing,</B>
<P><B>even though it was November and none were blooming and also, there</B>
<P><B>weren't any fresh flowers placed on any of the very old graves.   The</B>
<P><B>fake bird call almost scared the life out of us because it just
sounded</B>
<P><B>SO unnatural and with each chirp sounded closer and closer.  We
decided</B>
<P><B>that we really needed to get out of there so we both sat inside the
car</B>
<P><B>waiting for the others.  I got myself in such a work-ed up state that</B>
<P><B>when I found a quarter on the ground I swore "In blood we trust"was</B>
<P><B>written on it, rather than the usual "In god we trust".  My friend
just</B>
<P><B>laughed at me.  Thank you for listening.</B>

<P><B>The Man in the Cloak</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Damien2078@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>The story that I am about to relate to you took place when I was about
eleven </B>
<P><B>years old.  I am seventeen now, and most people whom I have conversed
with </B>
<P><B>about this matter shrug it off as the hallucinations of a child.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>It was the fall of about 1992 or 1993, maybe before, maybe after, I
do not </B>
<P><B>honestly remember.  I was living with my father here in Texas at the
time </B>
<P><B>because my mother had hauled off to Arizona to take care of her father,
who </B>
<P><B>had succumbed to a stroke.  My father and I had gone to my Grandmother's
</B>
<P><B>house for dinner.  My grandfather was out of town as visiting relatives
in </B>
<P><B>another part of the state. </B>
<P>
<P><B>My father, my Grandmother and myself were in the kitchen conversing
about </B>
<P><B>things that I can no longer recall, because my memories of this occasion
are </B>
<P><B>starting to fade and jostle in my mind.  My father told me to go wash
my hand </B>
<P><B>in the restroom, as my Grandmother had just finished making dinner
and we </B>
<P><B>were about to sit and eat.  I walked out of the kitchen and into the
dining </B>
<P><B>room.  As I looked in the general direction of the restroom, which
was about </B>
<P><B>fifteen feet from where I was standing, I noticed two things immediately.
 </B>
<P><B>The toilet was making strange noises, which isn't uncommon in houses,
and </B>
<P><B>there was what appeared to be a man in a shroud standing in the restroom
with </B>
<P><B>his hands under the faucet, staring at me.  I don't remember exactly
what my </B>
<P><B>feeling were at the time, except for a bit of fear and a bit of awe
at the </B>
<P><B>supernatural.  (I am a big reader and around that time of my life I
was </B>
<P><B>getting into ghost stories and other paranormal phenomena.)  I then
walked </B>
<P><B>back into the kitchen, and my father asked me if I had washed my hands.
 Of </B>
<P><B>course, being as frightened as I suppose I was, I told him that I had
and </B>
<P><B>then I proceeded to eat my dinner, but the events of that night have
never </B>
<P><B>entirely left me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had seen the man in the cloak on at least two other occasions since,
but </B>
<P><B>those stories are for a later time.  Thanks for reading, and
goodnight.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Chicago</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: tsaltase@comcorpinc.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story was told to me by an ex-boyfriend, Mike, when we first</B>
<P><B>started dating.  We were still getting to know each other, so when
he</B>
<P><B>told me he was VERY afraid of sprits, I believed him, because it's
not</B>
<P><B>the type of thing you'd say if you were trying to impress a girl. 
I</B>
<P><B>asked him why, and this is what he told me...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Mike's first encounter with "ghosts" was about 10 -12 years ago, when</B>
<P><B>he and his family (mom, dad, little brother George and Mike) were</B>
<P><B>living in a house in the Northwest side of Chicago.  This particular</B>
<P><B>house had an attic, which was used to store the items that came with</B>
<P><B>the house when before Mike's family bought it.  Nothing too unusual
--</B>
<P><B>mostly furniture and such.  At this time, Mike was probably 15 years</B>
<P><B>old, and his brother George was probably 9 years old.  They were up
in</B>
<P><B>the attic one afternoon, goofing around, pretending to be</B>
<P><B>acrobats/wrestlers etc.  Eventually they got tired and George
collapsed</B>
<P><B>on the floor, while Mike sat in an old recliner that came with the</B>
<P><B>house.  The brothers continued talking until their mother called from</B>
<P><B>downstairs, announcing that dinner was ready.   The boys had worked
up</B>
<P><B>an appetite, so they bolted out of the attic.  Mike was the last one</B>
<P><B>out and as soon as he shut the door behind him, he remembered that
he</B>
<P><B>left the light on.  Knowing his mother would be mad if he didn't turn</B>
<P><B>it off, Mike opened the door to the attic took one step in, and froze.
</B>
<P><B>The recliner that Mike had been sitting in was slowly turning towards</B>
<P><B>him.  Mike tried to command his body to run but he was so scared he</B>
<P><B>seemed rooted to the floor.  The recliner turned enough so that Mike</B>
<P><B>could see the form of a knee, and it was at that point that Mike got</B>
<P><B>the strength to bolt out of the room and down to the kitchen.  He
told</B>
<P><B>his parents what he saw, and of course they didn't believe him, but</B>
<P><B>Mike refused to stay in the house any longer.  He was so upset that
his</B>
<P><B>parents made arrangements for him to sleep at his aunt &amp; uncle's
house</B>
<P><B>that night.  Furthermore, that was the last time Mike ever stepped
foot</B>
<P><B>into that house.  He stayed with his aunt and uncle until his family</B>
<P><B>sold the house a few months later.  Of course his parents objected
to</B>
<P><B>his imposing on his relative's hospitality, but they were afraid to</B>
<P><B>force him to come back, fearing he would have some sort of breakdown.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next house Mike's family moved into was still in Chicago, and not</B>
<P><B>too far from where the old house was.  Everything was going fine
until</B>
<P><B>one night when Mike's family had friends over for dinner.  After</B>
<P><B>dinner, the adults and Mike sat around the island in the kitchen
having</B>
<P><B>coffee and talking, while year old George played outside in the back</B>
<P><B>yard with the guests' little boy, Sam.  At one point, George opened
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen door and ran through the kitchen past all the adults and</B>
<P><B>straight into the adjoining bathroom.  No one thought anything of
this</B>
<P><B>until about ten minutes later, when Mike's dad questioned why George</B>
<P><B>was taking so long in the bathroom.  Mike's dad knocked on the
bathroom</B>
<P><B>door, asking George if everything was ll right.  No answer.  Mike's
dad</B>
<P><B>tried to open the door, but it was locked from the inside.  Everyone</B>
<P><B>started getting concerned, until the kitchen door opened again and
in</B>
<P><B>came George and Sam.  Mike's father aske George how he snuck back out</B>
<P><B>of the bathroom without anyone seeing him.  You see, there is no
other</B>
<P><B>way out of the bathroom -- if George came out, or even opened the
door,</B>
<P><B>he would have been seen.  In order to get back outside, he would have</B>
<P><B>to go through the kitchen again.  George swore up and down that he
had</B>
<P><B>not been to the bathroom at all -- he was outside playing with Sam
the</B>
<P><B>whole time.  Mike's father asked him to explain about the locked</B>
<P><B>bathroom door, but when they checked it again, it was not locked. 
</B>
<P>
<P><B>There were other strange incidents that happened in the house, mostly</B>
<P><B>to Mike, more than anyone else in the family.  The last incident Mike</B>
<P><B>told me about was something that happened to him a few months before
we</B>
<P><B>met, when he was about 22 years old.   One night, as Mike was lying
in</B>
<P><B>bed, he woke up with an uneasy feeling.  He was lying on his side</B>
<P><B>facing the wall, and he felt as if someone was staring at him.  It
was</B>
<P><B>the middle of the night and pitch black in the room.  Mike turned
over</B>
<P><B>and opened his eyes and saw a black figure standing next to his bed</B>
<P><B>staring down at him.  Mike shut his eyes and screamed for his mother</B>
<P><B>repeatedly.  When she came storming in the room Mike told her what</B>
<P><B>happened.   It seemed as if such occurences happened sporadically,</B>
<P><B>strangely enough when Mike was getting to the point of forgetting
them.</B>
<P><B> Seems as if the spooks recognize this, and remind them of their</B>
<P><B>presence every now and again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was kind of skeptical when Mike told me this story, mainly because
I</B>
<P><B>was just getting to know him, so I couldn't tell if he was a habitual</B>
<P><B>liar or something.  But the way he acted and the way he told the</B>
<P><B>stories wa enough to make me wonder if he was a spook magnet.  We
only</B>
<P><B>dated a couple of months, and maybe that was for the best...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Haunted Dorm Bathroom</B>
<P><B>By: mt7318@WCUVAX1.WCU.EDU</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is one of the many ghostly experiences I have had since
childhood.</B>
<P><B>I live in a dorm that was built in the 50's. There have never been
any </B>
<P><B>hauntings reported, but there does seem to have been one...at least
for awhile. </B>
<P><B>It all began with a dream: I dreamed I got up out of my bed and walked
down the </B>
<P><B>hall to the bathroom that I share with two other girls, and there standing
with </B>
<P><B>her back to the sink, facing the door like she was posing for a picture
with her </B>
<P><B>hands clasped in front of her was a girl. She had stringy, mousey brown
hair and </B>
<P><B>a pale, acne scarred face. She wore a little white bouse, pale blue
"poodle" </B>
<P><B>type skirt without the poodle, and saddle shoes. Her eyes were a pale,
intense </B>
<P><B>blue. She looked at me with utter hatred, and then walked past me and
</B>
<P><B>dissapeared. I woke with the knowledge that I had had this dream many
times </B>
<P><B>before. I asked my friend Denise, who shared the bathroom, if she had
ever felt </B>
<P><B>strange in there, and she confessed that every time she took a shower
she felt </B>
<P><B>that someone was watching her and that the someone was not friendly.
I began to </B>
<P><B>notice a hostile feeling every time I went into the bathroom. Sometimes,
when I </B>
<P><B>was showering with the door locked I would hear the door open or the
sound of </B>
<P><B>someone moving around outside the shower curtain. Once the water went
from </B>
<P><B>comfortable to icy to scalding hot in a few seconds, then turned off
abruptly. I </B>
<P><B>kept dreaming about the girl, who told me that her name was Bobbie,
that she had </B>
<P><B>killed herself in that bathroom because "no one noticed me in my new
blue </B>
<P><B>skirt." I gathered that shewas shy, lonely, and depressed. Her spirit
was still openly </B>
<P><B>hostile. I would go into the bathroom to find that all my stuff had
been thrown in the </B>
<P><B>trash or on the floor. I still wasn't sure if I was imagining things
or not, so I decided </B>
<P><B>to do some research. Using a pendulum, I managed to find out the girl's
last </B>
<P><B>name: Pagotti.</B>
<P><B>I went to the registrars office to see if there was any record of any
girl by </B>
<P><B>that name having ever been in my dorm, since the University has records
dating </B>
<P><B>back to the time the first dorms were built. I found out that my dorm
was the </B>
<P><B>first one built on the campus, that it was meant only to house women
attending </B>
<P><B>the "business college", and that it was built in 1956. But I looked
through </B>
<P><B>dusty old annuals and crap all day with no result. The women in the
records </B>
<P><B>office plainly though I was a nut, and after three hours I decided
to give up. </B>
<P><B>As I was leaving, an older secretary was heading outside for her smoke
break. </B>
<P><B>She pulled me aside and told me " You won't find any record of her,
you know. </B>
<P><B>The university only keeps grade records, not enrollment records, and
if she died </B>
<P><B>before the end of her first semester we don't have anything to prove
she was </B>
<P><B>ever here." She seemed nervous about telling me this, and kept looking

<P><B>see if anyone was listening. She spoke in "ifs", but something about
her tone </B>
<P><B>made me think she knew exactly why I wanted what I wanted.</B>

<P><B>asking the spirit to move on every time we went in. Eventually the

<P><B>I (and at least one friend) have each had odd experiences in hotel
rooms</B>
<P><B>- ordinary, commercial hotels (the Adams Mark in Indianapolis, the</B>
<P><B>Columbus Ohio Convention Center), not some old place with any "real"</B>
<P><B>history. I can't speak much for James, but I can tell you about
mine...</B>
<P>
<P><B>We were in our room - Dave, Arvil, My boyfriend Gene, and myself -
all</B>
<P><B>asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night, when something touched
my</B>
<P><B>hand. I sat up to see a black figure duck down between the beds. I</B>
<P><B>thought it might have been Dave bugging me, until I saw him asleep
in</B>
<P><B>the other bed. Gene told me not to worry - that I was dreaming, and</B>
<P><B>should just go back to sleep. In the morning, however, he told me
that</B>
<P><B>he believed what I had seen (and felt!!) because his friend James had</B>
<P><B>seen a black figure leaning over him in an empty room at an entirely</B>
<P><B>different hotel; he wouldn't say anything earlier in case I became</B>
<P><B>really frightnened and couldn't sleep.</B>
<P><B>I have never had that same experience since...</B>

<P><B>Ghost Sighting....</B>

<P>
<P><B>Ever since I was a young child, we have lived in this house. The house
was </B>
<P><B>built in the late 1800s and we are only the second family to own it.
There </B>
<P><B>is one particular room that has always given me a feeling of a presence
or </B>
<P><B>spirit. When I was younger, between 4 and 12, I could never sleep in
the </B>
<P><B>room by myself. I never knew why at that point.  I would always have
bad </B>
<P><B>dreams and wake up crying and sweating, when I did sleep alone. I would
hear </B>
<P><B>creeking noises and see sparkles. I was scared. Once I moved out of
that </B>
<P><B>room and into the room next to it, I could sleep alright, but I had
to close </B>
<P><B>the door to "the ghost room"(as my friends call it). And I still have
to </B>
<P><B>close the door, mainly because when I am in the room or around the
door I </B>
<P><B>feel as though there is someone standing behind me staring at me. The
spirit </B>
<P><B>never leaves the room, rather stands in the doorway and seems to simply
</B>
<P><B>stare at me. I feel very uncomfortable. I know that the man that lived
here </B>
<P><B>before us had died in the backyard and that room had been the room
he slept </B>
<P><B>in, and spend his last years in. I seem to be the only one in my family
that </B>
<P><B>feels this presence. My brother's girlfriend seems to be the only other
one </B>
<P><B>who understands and beleives my feelings to be real. The rest of my
family </B>
<P><B>simply thinks that I am "crazy", as they say. But I know that there
is a </B>
<P><B>ghost in that room. I was wondering, as well, how I could relieve him(so
to </B>
<P><B>speak), and help him to pass on the after life.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you for your time,</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>It seems that every story I read on your page has an un-canny familiarity
to </B>
<P><B>it.  I have actually had many experiences with ghosts and paranormal
</B>
<P><B>experiences, however this one "runs in the family".  I was 17 years
old, </B>
<P><B>living in a large spanish estate in Lakeside, California. I am the
youngest </B>
<P><B>of five and we all had our own bedrooms.  I am basically a photo copy
of my </B>
<P><B>mother in all aspects.  I was sleeping in my room one night, and it
was about </B>
<P><B>1:00 in the morning.  I woke up with an incredible fear. Something
so </B>
<P><B>terrifying that I had never experienced before.  As I looked up there
was a </B>
<P><B>very tall figure standing above my bed.  He was dressed in a black
suit, like </B>
<P><B>you would wear at a cemetary, with a black hat.  This figure had a
face of </B>
<P><B>complete evil.  He was old, probably about 70, and his eyes were filled
with </B>
<P><B>incredible rage.  I was frozen with fear and could not move.  The evil
spirit </B>
<P><B>was slowly coming towards me, and after what seemed to be an eternity
I was </B>
<P><B>able to speak. Not that I enjoying using incredibly foul language,
but the </B>
<P><B>only thing that came out of my mouth at that moment in time was...
Get the </B>
<P><B>f--k out of here! Within an instant the man left, completely vanished
into </B>
<P><B>the air.  I ran to the other side of the house into my moms room, crying
in </B>
<P><B>complete histarics.  I had never felt like I was in as much danger
as that </B>
<P><B>moment in time.  I told my mom about what had happend, and what the
man </B>
<P><B>looked like.  The look on her face was actaully begining to scare me
more.  </B>
<P><B>She began to tell me about when she was my age when she lived in Omaha.
 Her </B>
<P><B>bedroom was up in the attic of her mothers house.  She began getting
visits </B>
<P><B>from an evil old spirit who was identical to the spirit who visited
my room.  </B>
<P><B>He haunted her for over a year giving her an incredible fear.  He would
chase </B>
<P><B>her throughout her house, laughing when she ran out the front door
to escape </B>
<P><B>his terror. She decided to confront him when she came home from school
one </B>
<P><B>day.  She told me she entered the house, and sat in the living room
chair and </B>
<P><B>demanded that he appear.  Within an instant this tall dark figure dressed
in </B>
<P><B>black, and a black hat was running towards her. The only thing she
could do </B>
<P><B>without being frozen from fear was to run out of the house as fast
as she </B>
<P><B>could. She truly believes to this day that if she would have sat in
that </B>
<P><B>chair until he reached her, that she would not be alive today.  She
said that </B>
<P><B>after that day his visits to her bedside became fewer and fewer.  However
it </B>
<P><B>seems that this spirit like to follow his victims children, and I just
pray </B>
<P><B>that my two daughters don't get a visit from this evil spirit.  I am
actually </B>
<P><B>getting chills writing this down, and I hope that it doesn't bring
an </B>
<P><B>invitation for this man to return into my life.... </B>

<P><B>My Son's Visitor</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: AHill37197@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>	I've had quite a few encounters that I can't explain. I try to be
</B>
<P><B>skeptical so as not to let my imagination run away with me. What follows
is </B>
<P><B>more for the skeptics than any one else.</B>
<P><B>	My maternal grandmother was anything but. Suffice to say she was not
</B>
<P><B>a nice person. I grew up at the other end of the country from her and
never </B>
<P><B>really met her until I was 14. At that time, when I tried to make </B>
<P><B>conversation with her, she made it clear she had a "favorite" grandchild
and </B>
<P><B>I was not it. Hey, no skin off my nose! I just wanted to get to know
her, but </B>
<P><B>oh well! She never spoke to me again. She died the following year.
I felt bad </B>
<P><B>for my mother, but had no sense of loss at her passing. Never gave
it another </B>
<P><B>thought.</B>
<P><B>	When I was 21 I had a baby. On our very first night home, I was </B>
<P><B>nervous and not sleeping well.So when he woke for his bottle I was
already </B>
<P><B>wide awake and hovering. (you mom"s know what I mean !) He suddenly
smiled! I </B>
<P><B>thought,"How sweet! It's only gas but look at that face!" Seconds later
he </B>
<P><B>puckerd up and started to cry. Gas, sure enough. Then I heard my
grandmothers </B>
<P><B>voice clear as a bell say, "Don't cry honey, but Grandma's got to go."
He </B>
<P><B>stopped whimpering as tho he heard her too. I can't explain this, she
was not </B>
<P><B>in my thoughts, I hadn't wished that she could see him. She had never
enterd </B>
<P><B>my mind during that period in my life. But I know what I heard, I was
wide </B>
<P><B>awake. I saw my son's response.</B>
<P><B>	It has always puzzled me why she would visit. We had no connection
in </B>
<P><B>anyway. She was an utter stranger. Now my son is grown. In old pictures
of my </B>
<P><B>grandfather, they could pass as twins.Could that have been it? I'll
</B>
<P><B>never know.</B>
