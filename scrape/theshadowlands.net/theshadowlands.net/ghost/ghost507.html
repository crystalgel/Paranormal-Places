Parris Island Haunting<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; david.roman@live.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I've known about The Shadowlands for a long time.&nbsp; Probably since
the late 90's.&nbsp; I don't visit the site too often (probably 3-4
times a year) but when I visit I enjoy it.&nbsp; Anyway, I wanted to
share a couple of stories that kinda dawned on me while reading the
site today.&nbsp; While I was reading your site I remembered some of
the experiences I had at Parris Island, specifically in the rifle range
area.&nbsp; Well, when I searched on the <br>
internet for Parris Island haunted I came across this story:&nbsp;
http://www.wirenot.net/X/Articles/2008/E-F/firewatchghost.shtml&nbsp;
This same event in regards to fire watch happened to a friend of
mine.&nbsp; He was so spooked that he woke me up early for fire watch
duty because he couldn't take it.&nbsp; He saw a figure in the mirror
in the bathroom!&nbsp; The difference between his story and the story
from the link is that he saw the figure in the mirror but to him it
looked as if he was in the bathroom.&nbsp; The bathrooms were in the
large area we call the squadbay.&nbsp; The drill instructor's office
was typically there.&nbsp; My friend had me go in the bathroom but I
didn't see anything.&nbsp; I took over his shift and worked mine.&nbsp;
I recall hearing sounds like someone moving in the bathroom.&nbsp; I
checked a few times but I didn't see anything.&nbsp; If I'm being
honest I was hoping that I would which is why I didn't mind taking a
double shift.&nbsp; My second story is an interesting one because it
was an experience we all witnessed.&nbsp; Again this was in the same
barracks where we stay for the rifle range.&nbsp; We had all entered
the barracks after lunch and we were all standing in front of our foot
lockers as our drill instructor, Sgt. Minix, was yelling at us over
something.&nbsp; He was standing right at the door that we always use
to enter and exit the barracks.&nbsp; We were on the 2nd floor of the
three floor unit. Well, while he was yelling there were three distinct
knocks on the door.&nbsp; It was the three knocks that all recruits had
to do in order to approach the drill instructor at his office or when a
recruit has to enter another squad bay.&nbsp; By "knocks" they were not
traditional knocks on the door but more like hand slaps against the
door.&nbsp; As soon as the third knock was heard he flung the door
open.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if someone was standing there they
would've had a door to the face.&nbsp; There was no one there and there
was absolutely no possibility that someone could have jumped out of the
way, or hid.&nbsp; They would've had to run up or down the stairs, or
jump over the railing and taken a very high and nasty fall, and it
would've been obvious just hearing footsteps.&nbsp; He looked up and
down the stairs and said, "Must have been a ghost."&nbsp; It was the
time of day where all platoons would have returned to their barracks so
it wasn't some recruit falling behind or a drill instructor late.&nbsp;
That just didn't happen.&nbsp; Parris Island is very orderly in
everything.&nbsp; Of all the ghost stories I've heard I've never read
or heard of one where a room full of people experienced the same
thing.&nbsp; <br>

Another True Scary Story<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ronloof@aol.com<br>
Wanted to share a story with you about something that happened to
somebody I knew when I was a young man in Minnesota that always sends
chills down my spine...When I was about 12 years old (which would have
been about 1977), my brother Royce was working in a town named
Worthington, MN, about 30 miles from my hometown of Jackson, MN. He
worked at a lumber yard called UBC and had a friend that worked at a
local grain elevator. The silos for the grain elevators in that part of
the country rise hundreds of feet into the air and have the capacity to
store tons and tons of grain, whether that be corn or soybeans,
whatever the silo is being used for at the time.&nbsp; Occasionally the
employees of the elevator climb a ladder on the outside of the silos
and get into the silo via an access door at the very top in order to
inspect the grain inside, making sure it's not too wet, rotting, or
whatever. Inside the access door there is a catwalk that circles around
the entire circumference of the silo. My brother's friend climbed the
outside ladder, opened the access door, and lowered himself on to the
catwalk that circled the inside of the silo.&nbsp; After walking
halfway around the silo on the catwalk, my brother's friend (I don't
even recall his name any longer) observed what he thought was an
excessive amount of moisture on the surface of the corn, which was what
the silo was being used for at the time. So, being an industrious young
man, he jumped over the catwalk rail and walked out on to the surface
of the corn to roughly the middle of the silo to take a closer
look.&nbsp; After inspecting the corn, he decided to just continue his
journey across the surface of the corn to get back to the catwalk on
the other side of the silo. As the catwalk was a few feet higher than
the level of the corn, he had to grab on to the catwalk rail and
"bounce" to get his foot up to the catwalk platform and swing his leg
over the rail.&nbsp; As he swung his foot over the rail, he heard a
noise behind him. Balancing with one leg over the catwalk rail and one
leg on the catwalk platform on the outside of the rail, he turned
around to see what the noise was.&nbsp; Much to his horror, the corn
that he had just walked across was falling straight down, hundreds of
feet to the bottom of the silo, which was cement floor. It landed with
a crash a few seconds later.&nbsp; Instead of walking on a solid
surface of corn as he had assumed, he had actually walked across a
"crust" of rotten corn that had formed on top of the silo when corn had
previously been stored in the silo. The remaining corn had been removed
from the silo the previous week.&nbsp; He spent a few minutes sitting
on the catwalk, staring down into the depths of the silo, and then
silently got up, went out the access door, made his way back down the
ladder on the outside of the silo, and took the rest of the day off.<br>

Hotel de Saint-Florentin<br>
By:shinydevil@gmail.com<br>
I would like to submit an addition to your haunted places
listing.&nbsp; The H&ocirc;tel de Saint-Florentin (also known as
H&ocirc;tel de Talleyrand-P&eacute;rigord, and usually just called the
&#8216;Talleyrand building&#8217;) 2 rue Saint-Florentin, Paris.&nbsp; It&#8217;s on one
corner of the place de la Concorde.&nbsp; A decent picture and links
at, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hotel-de-talleyrand.jpg&nbsp; The
Talleyrand building used to be a part of the U.S. Embassy, housing the
visa, passport services and American library.&nbsp; I am not sure of
its status as of now.&nbsp; I was stationed there in the late 80's as a
Marine Security Guard. <br>
&nbsp;I have a few personal experiences in this building, as do most of
the Marines I served with.&nbsp; At night, the Marine Guard on duty
checks the security of every door, window, and office in the
building.&nbsp; We make damned sure that we are the only ones on
post.&nbsp; If we see or hear something at night, it could be a
security breach and we check it out.&nbsp; It was a regular occurrence
to hear doors opening and closing, footsteps, and the elevators going
up and down by themselves.&nbsp; Strangest of all, to me, the toilets
would flush.&nbsp; The basement was the most likely place to hear odd
things.&nbsp; It is connected to the Paris catacomb network, and had
also been modified with detention cells by the Nazis during their
occupation in WW2.&nbsp; The cells were still there in 1987.&nbsp; Each
one is about 5'x 8', fitted with a fold-down shelf for a bed, and a
solid iron door.&nbsp; A seriously creepy place to be in the wee hours
of the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the best stories from the
Talleyrand, was the night a Marine on post patrol came across a man in
the second floor ballroom.&nbsp; The Marine, following his training,
challenged the stranger to identify himself.&nbsp; When there was no
response, he drew his service revolver, and instructed the intruder to
get on his knees.&nbsp; When the intruder began to walk towards the
Marine, he yelled "Stop, or I'll shoot you!"&nbsp; The stranger
continued to approach, so the Marine fired one shot, to the center of
the man's chest.&nbsp; As soon as the shot was fired, the stranger
disappeared, leaving a single bullet hole in one of the mirrors that
cover the ballroom walls.&nbsp; The next day an investigation was
started, as there always is when a weapon is discharged on Embassy
grounds.&nbsp; The Marine was accused of screwing around on duty,
practicing his quick draw in front of a mirror, and negligent discharge
of a firearm.&nbsp; The officer conducting the investigation settled on
the most plausible explanation for the incident, and pressed
charges.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the accused Marine stuck to his
story.&nbsp; He had seen a guy on his post who wasn't supposed to be
there, and he did what he was trained to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That
evening, in the Marine bar, the investigating officer began to listen
to the other Marines as they told him of their own strange experiences
in the Talleyrand building.&nbsp; The young officer was invited to
visit the post at night, and form his own opinion.&nbsp; Charges were
dismissed the following day.The bullet hole was (and probably is) still
there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent a year and a half on duty in Paris,
and rotated watches through the Talleyrand several times a month.&nbsp;
When people have sometimes asked me if I believe in ghosts, I think
back to my time there and answer truthfully, "Yes I do."&nbsp; American
citizens may be able to visit the Talleyrand building, and see the
ballroom.&nbsp; It's maintained in a very nice, early 1800's
style.&nbsp; You have to climb the stairs to the second floor, in the
right hand wing. (As you face the building.)&nbsp; The rest of the
offices are off-limits to most people.&nbsp; Make sure and say hello to
the Marine on duty.&nbsp; Maybe he will tell you his own story.&nbsp;
Semper Fi.&nbsp; <br>

The Hands from the Well<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neboshoh@yahoo.com <br>
Location-San Mateo, California Residence-a post war house, part of a
small housing project in the Hillsdale area on 28th Avenue.&nbsp; The
property, located at the base of the hills, was once a ranch.&nbsp; The
house in question was built over the former well. In fact one of the
original out structures still existed in the back yard at the time of
the experience but I didnt find this out until years later.&nbsp; All
the past history was unknown to me when we moved in during the first
part of the 60's.&nbsp; The house stood out from its cookie cutter
neighbors by its dreary grey and blood red paint in the midst of the
optimistic white of the post war houses.&nbsp; The inside was even
worse with dirty faded mustard and brown walls untouched since first
painted. Even though our neighbors boasted flourishing gardens on
either side, nothing, except stubborn evergreens would grow on our
property for long no matter how hard we tried. I was a teenager at the
time and had the back bedroom where the experiences originated.&nbsp;
At first the encounters would begin at the edge of sleep, when the mind
has just started to slip over to the other world.&nbsp; I would feel a
heavy plop on the end of the bed, after a moment, pressure would start
to cautiously progress up the side of the bed not unlike a cat sneaking
up to a pillow, except we had no cat. If I looked, it would immediately
stop only to start again from the base as I once again slipped into
sleep.&nbsp; This might happen nightly, other times a week or so
between.&nbsp; But at one point it began to escalate. Becoming bolder,
it would begin its stalking up the bed while I was still awake-always
unseen but definitely heavy pressure slowly moving up the side of the
bed towards my head depressing the blankets as it went.&nbsp; Then the
dreams started. As soon as I fell asleep, I saw a dark bottomless hole
open up.&nbsp; Reaching out of its darkness were elongated hands
attached to pasty white arms that stretched back into the abyss.&nbsp;
The hands would land on the bed and then begin their crawl until I
would pass out.&nbsp; There was never a body seen, nor did I feel it
was ever anything human. This was the nightmare I lived with constantly
until I was old enough to move out on my own.&nbsp; None of this was
experienced in any other part of the house, just in this one room in
the bed placed in the corner.&nbsp; As I later found out, this was the
exact location of the old ranch well, now covered over.&nbsp; The house
is still there.&nbsp; I know the experience was not my imagination-I
have had psychic abilities since a small child.&nbsp; But I wonder to
this day if anyone else has had these encounters in that back room.<br>

Little Historical House<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tib70@yahoo.com<br>
In 2001 I started living in a two bedroom, one bath house near the
corner of Old Santa Cruz Hwy and Summit Rd in the Santa Cruz
Mountains.This house was the last remaining cabin from when this 72
acre property was a resort in the early 1900's.&nbsp; Part of the house
still has original windows and walls from that time. I have been
studying and reading about the spirit world for a lot of my life and
have had many experiences over the years in different places I have
lived, starting when I was a little girl. I lived in this house for
about 3 years. I had some&nbsp; very interesting experiences in this
house.&nbsp; Before this, I definetely had the ability to feel a
presence and know exactly where they were walking or standing. This is
the story: I woke up in my bed in the middle of the night or early
morning,&nbsp; and I was sitting up in bed. It took me a second <br>
to realize I was looking at two people standing in my room very close
to the end of my bed. One was a lady in maybe her early to mid 20's and
a boy who was about 8. They were dressed in early 1900's very nice
clothes. They were completely solid. I couldn't stop staring. The woman
was wearing a dark long dress with puffy sleeves and had a hat on. She
looked like what you would see on one of those cameo pictures. The boy
had on a page boy outfit. I stared and stared, not wanting to miss a
second. It was completely fascinating. It went on for maybe 30 seconds?
Then they just Dissipated. I&nbsp; laid back down and immediately went
back to sleep. Then, a week or two later, I had fallen asleep on the
couch in the family room on my side facing towards middle of the room.
As I opened my eyes, the same two people were standing in front of me
about 5 ft away. Each time the boy is standing a little bit in front of
the lady(his mom?). The way I was laying on the couch, and the
perspective I was seeing was that they were still completely full
bodied and solid but I could only see from about the waist down. All of
a sudden, the boy leaned down to check me out.. Oh wow! That startled
me! He moved! Obviously seeing me too! I jumped a little and then just
turned over on my side and&nbsp; just went right back to sleep. Not
long after, within a week or two?&nbsp; I had fallen asleep on the
couch again. Again on my side facing the room. This time when I opened
my eyes, the little boy was staring into my face! He was right next to
the couch leaning down staring at me. He had this look on his face like
he was annoyed, squinting his eyes at me. I think I jumped like 3 feet!
I&nbsp; tuned him out and turned over and immediately went back to
sleep. My next experience I was asleep on my back in my bed. I woke up
because something was&nbsp; tickling my right check. I reached up&nbsp;
half asleep and scratched my face and accidently tore my skin I
scratched so hard. I have never done anything like that before in my
life. Soon after that, a couple days, not sure, I was asleep in my bed
on my back and woke up in the middle of the night again. My head was
towards the left and my eyes were looking down at my sheets. I turned
my head towards the right and standing right next to my bed about 2
feet from me was an old lady. That really startled me! She was from a
more current time frame. From maybe the 60's to the 80's?&nbsp; She
looked like she was in her late 70's to her 80's. She had white curly
short hair and was wearing glasses. She had on polyester type orange?
pants with I think a print top.&nbsp; She was also looking at me in
that same squinty eyed annoyed look . I turned my head towards the
right for a second, I couldn't believe what I was seeing and then
looked back for a second and couldn't see her anymore. Then, just like
the other times, went right back to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were many
times when I would be laying in bed reading and I would have this
feeling like there were a bunch of people just hanging out in my room
standing around..like when your at the trail or bus station..About six
months after I had moved out, I went back up to visit the people who
owned the property. The wife and their son and I were standing outside
this house on the porch talking and having drinks celebrating 4th of
July. I asked Dustin if I had told him about the ghosts I had seen in
the house. He said no so I started telling him the same story. As I was
into the story I saw the look on his face and thought he was looking at
me like I was making it up and I said "what?" and expected him to tell
me I was full of b.s. and I thought to myself that I shouldn&#8217;t have
brought it up. There were a couple other women who had rented out the
house before me. They had told me about the three of them. This one in
particular they never took seriously because they thought she was on
drugs. So, Dustin tells me that this one girl who did the drugs had
told them she had seen two ghosts in the house, but they didn't believe
her. I was blown away! It was so validating for both of us. I had not
let myself fully believe that what I had seen was real because for many
years in my life I had woken up to see weird things flying across the
ceiling of my room where ever I lived and I wasn't sure if I was just
dreaming. It was a huge turning point for me with acknowledging that I
really was having all these experiences through out my life.<br>
