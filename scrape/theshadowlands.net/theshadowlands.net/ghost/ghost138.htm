<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; CindyMendieta@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I read your personal story.&nbsp; It was spooky, but I enjoyed it;
thanks for</b>
<br><b>having the courage to share it.&nbsp; I have also had some paranormal</b>
<br><b>experiences, but considerably mild in comparison to yours.&nbsp;
Please allow me to share</b>
<br><b>them with you.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The first possible experience occurred when I was very young
- under the</b>
<br><b>age of 8 years old.&nbsp; I had an imaginary playmate, but my mother
thought I was</b>
<br><b>in touch with an entity.&nbsp; The "playmate" was adult, male, and
went by the</b>
<br><b>name "Shadow".&nbsp; I don't remember Shadow, buy I do remember
the last time I</b>
<br><b>talked about Shadow because my mom asked me why I didn't mention
Shadow any more</b>
<br><b>(apparently I would talk about him at great length).&nbsp; I said
that Shadow</b>
<br><b>had gone away; my mom asked when he would be back, but I said I
didn't know.</b>
<br><b>When my mom asked where Shadow had gone, again I said I didn't know.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>mom told me she used to hear me "talking" to Shadow, and that it
sounded like</b>
<br><b>one half of a telephone conversation: it wasn't like I was making
up the other</b>
<br><b>half of the conversation, but merely responding to something that
was</b>
<br><b>being said to me.&nbsp; Perhaps I was in contact with an entity,
however Shadow never</b>
<br><b>frightened me - he was a comforting presence.&nbsp; Perhaps it was
an entity,</b>
<br><b>although I have wondered if I was in contact with my guardian angel.&nbsp;
Then</b>
<br><b>again, I've always had a strong imagination - perhaps it was just
an</b>
<br><b>imaginary playmate.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The next paranormal experienced happened in my brother's home
in Moss</b>
<br><b>Beach, California, approximately 1/4 of a mile from the Moss Beach
Distillery - a</b>
<br><b>restaurant that has a reputation for being haunted.&nbsp; When this
experience</b>
<br><b>happened, I did not know about the hauntings of the restaurant,
or of the</b>
<br><b>history of the area.&nbsp; My brother's house has a downstairs bedroom
that has</b>
<br><b>long been considered "my" bedroom, because I always slept there
- and</b>
<br><b>always with the door locked, since everyone else slept upstairs.&nbsp;
One night I was</b>
<br><b>awakened out of deep sleep by a man's voice, a voice much deeper
than that</b>
<br><b>of my brother's.&nbsp; The voice sounded angry, full of accusation,
and said, "You</b>
<br><b>don't belong here!"&nbsp; I had a brief glimpse of a man in my room.&nbsp;
His back</b>
<br><b>was to the window, so he was in silhouette, but very solid looking.&nbsp;
What I</b>
<br><b>could see was a very craggy and rough-hewn looking face, and he
was wearing a</b>
<br><b>heavy canvas jacket (like the type firemen or fishermen wear), and
he was</b>
<br><b>pointing down at me in the bed.&nbsp; However, it was just that
brief glimpse, and then</b>
<br><b>it was gone.&nbsp; I've wondered if I dreamt it, because I was able
to go right</b>
<br><b>back to sleep.&nbsp; However I doubt I would have dreamt that I
didn't belong there</b>
<br><b>because I had spent so much time in my brother's house that I felt
that I</b>
<br><b>had as much right to be there as my brother.</b>
<br><b>When I told my brother of the incident, he said he had something
spooky</b>
<br><b>happen also.&nbsp; One night, about 2am, he was still up reading,
when he heard</b>
<br><b>someone coming up the stairs.&nbsp; My brother built his house from
scratch,</b>
<br><b>and was very familiar with the entire house.&nbsp; It wasn't one
creak that he</b>
<br><b>heard - he heard every stair being trod upon.&nbsp; Thinking he
had a prowler, he got</b>
<br><b>out a gun and went to find out who was in his house.&nbsp; He found
nothing, and</b>
<br><b>all the windows and doors were locked tight.&nbsp; He said it was
really eerie.</b>
<br><b>Later we found out that the Moss Beach coastline (not too far from
Half</b>
<br><b>Moon Bay) was the site of a lot of illegal bootleg activity during
Prohibition.</b>
<br><b>There were accidents, gunfights, and other tragedies that follow
illegal</b>
<br><b>activity.&nbsp; Since finding out about the history of the area,
we have since</b>
<br><b>wondered what it was that my brother and I encountered.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The last paranormal experience that happened occurred within
a 3-month</b>
<br><b>period after my mother's death.&nbsp; Perhaps I should say "experiences",
because on</b>
<br><b>three separate occasions I heard knocking.&nbsp; I was living with
my maternal</b>
<br><b>grandmother in the house my mother grew up.&nbsp; Each time I heard
the</b>
<br><b>knocking it was just three, evenly spaced knocks - but they were
loud.&nbsp; The third</b>
<br><b>time it happened, I went to answer the front door, convinced that
someone was</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; My bedroom was in the back of the house, which was
some distance</b>
<br><b>from the front door, so the knocks had to be loud for me to have
heard them.</b>
<br><b>I'm not positive, but I think it was mom coming back to say "Hi."</b>
<br><b>There is another possible experience.&nbsp; Both my husband and
I have felt</b>
<br><b>something pressing down on the bed while we slept.&nbsp; The first
time it</b>
<br><b>happened to me, it woke me up.&nbsp; I thought the cat had just
jumped up on</b>
<br><b>the bed near my feet, when I realized the cat was next to my pillow.&nbsp;
It got</b>
<br><b>my attention, but, again,&nbsp; I was not afraid.&nbsp; The cat
often moves his head</b>
<br><b>and eyes like he is watching something - something I can't see -
and only in</b>
<br><b>the bedroom.&nbsp; And when I'm in the apartment alone, taking a
shower, I hear a</b>
<br><b>man's footsteps coming into the bathroom.&nbsp; They always sound
the same, and</b>
<br><b>I'm guessing they are a man's footsteps because the stride is wider
than a</b>
<br><b>woman's and heavier.</b>
<br><b>Like I said, my experiences are very mild in comparison to what
you</b>
<br><b>experienced.&nbsp; I never felt fear during the experiences, but
later,</b>
<br><b>contemplating the possibilities, I tended to spook myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pretty tame</b>
<br><b>stuff, but every now and then it grabs my attention.&nbsp; I haven't
tried to</b>
<br><b>talk to any entity - if indeed there IS an entity - because I would
rather the</b>
<br><b>experiences remain merely an amusing conversation piece and not
the source</b>
<br><b>of a major investigation!&nbsp; Your recommendation to not contact
entities was</b>
<br><b>unnecessary with me; I'm a coward!</b>
<br><b>There are a couple of books you might be interested in.&nbsp; I
like reading</b>
<br><b>about true paranormal experiences, and the history behind them,
but without all</b>
<br><b>the added drama (Hans Holzer's books tend to get a little too "Steven</b>
<br><b>King-ish" for me.&nbsp; One is called "Gazetteer of British, Scottish
and Irish Ghosts"</b>
<br><b>by> Peter Underwood.&nbsp; I has pictures of some of the haunted
buildings, and a</b>
<br><b>lot of history.&nbsp; The other is "Haunted Heartland" by Michael
Norman and Beth</b>
<br><b>Scott.&nbsp; They have since written "Historic Haunted America",
but somehow it</b>
<br><b>doesn't have the same authentic "feel" of their first book.&nbsp;
I didn't like</b>
<br><b>it as much, but it was still entertaining.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for letting me share my story.&nbsp; You have a terrific
site!&nbsp; I hope</b>
<br><b>to visit again.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Grandfathers Time</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jennifer0219@excite.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello,</b>
<br><b>My name is Jennifer.&nbsp; I am 25 years old and live in Fort Myers,
Florida.</b>
<br><b>I just finshed visiting your website and I must say, it is very
interesting</b>
<br><b>and informative.</b>
<br><b>My story takes place in the house that I live in now.&nbsp;&nbsp;
About 2 1/2 years</b>
<br><b>ago my grandfather, whom resided in the house with me, passed away.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>was supposed to go into the hospital that morning for surgery to
remove his</b>
<br><b>bladder due to cancer. Before he made it to the hospital, he had
a heart</b>
<br><b>attack and died.&nbsp; It was about 7:30 am the morning of his surgery
when I</b>
<br><b>found him.&nbsp; I tried everything I could to save him but it was
too late.</b>
<br><b>Afterwards, it bothered me to think of the fact that if I had set
my alarm</b>
<br><b>instead of having my grandfather wake me (he was my alarm clock)I
could</b>
<br><b>have got to him sooner.&nbsp; I wanted to know when he actually
passed on.</b>
<br><b>In our front room I have a grandfather clock that my grandfather
bought to</b>
<br><b>pass through the generations of our family.&nbsp; Two days after
his death, the</b>
<br><b>clock stopped working.&nbsp; It had stopped at 6:35am.&nbsp; The
clock has not</b>
<br><b>worked since.&nbsp; It was a farely new clock.&nbsp; At first I
thought it was just the</b>
<br><b>clock acting up as my grandfather had problems with it before but
a few days</b>
<br><b>after this incident, another clock in the other room stopped at
6:35am.&nbsp; Neither</b>
<br><b>clock has worked since.</b>
<br><b>I know this isn't a story that sends chills down your spine but
I thought</b>
<br><b>you might want to know.</b>
<br><b>I have had several experiences with ghosts and strange happenings
since I</b>
<br><b>was a little girl.&nbsp; I want to know more about my experiences.&nbsp;
My mother</b>
<br><b>says it runs in the family.</b>
<br><b>Thank you very much for taking the time to read this and if at all</b>
<br><b>possible I would like some information on how to get involved in
paranormal</b>
<br><b>research.</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>My Friend and I</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Bluchik055@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Okay, so at the beginning of this school year I met someone.&nbsp;
Her name was</b>
<br><b>Sarah.&nbsp; Now&nbsp; we are best friends.&nbsp; I intend to keep
it that way too.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see my sister was born in a haunted house.&nbsp;
It would get cold then</b>
<br><b>you would smell something.&nbsp; Now, every once and a while I get
cold and</b>
<br><b>uncontrollable shivers up my spine.&nbsp; I told Sarah about this
and she told me</b>
<br><b>of something that happened to her.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stayed up late last year watching TV in her
bedroom.&nbsp; She said the</b>
<br><b>room was cold and a young girl appeared.&nbsp; The girl had a look
in her eyes as</b>
<br><b>if she was looking for someone or something.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, a week ago I spent the night at her house.&nbsp;
Everyone was in the</b>
<br><b>living room watching TV.&nbsp; It was about 8:30pm.&nbsp; I was
petting her&nbsp; dog Boe</b>
<br><b>and all of a sudden I heard a whistling.&nbsp; The odd thing is,
it was from the</b>
<br><b>other side of the house.&nbsp; No, it was not the wind.&nbsp; You
could purely tell it</b>
<br><b>was a whistle.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day we went to her cousins house which
was next door.&nbsp; I talked</b>
<br><b>to her cousin who had ghost experiences too.&nbsp; Just the night
before her ghost</b>
<br><b>pushed a chair down.&nbsp; One time she was wearing an open button
up shirt, she</b>
<br><b>bent over and all of a sudden ALL of the buttons were buttoned.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day after Ieft the cousins little sister
had a friend over.&nbsp; Her</b>
<br><b>friend saw the ghost of the little girl at the side of the house.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Hide &amp; Seek and others too</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: dposein@sk.sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>It's 3am and I would like to share my stories.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was&nbsp; 9 or 10 years old, my parents
and I visited my aunt &amp;</b>
<br><b>uncle in a small town in northern Saskatchewan called Smeaton. Their</b>
<br><b>youngest daughter, my cousin, Jody and I are just a few apart in
ages.</b>
<br><b>Anyhow, one night, during our visit, Jody and I, with a few of her</b>
<br><b>friends, decide to play hide &amp; seek. Since the town was so small,
we</b>
<br><b>could hide anywhere. I remember the countdown beginning. Jody said
"I've</b>
<br><b>got the perfect place." We ran about 2 blocks one way, then another</b>
<br><b>block to the right. There, in an empty lot, was what appeared to
be a</b>
<br><b>concrete slab, square, about 4 feet high and 30 feet long and wide.</b>
<br><b>Along one side, bushes grew close to the foundation. Jody said "
You go</b>
<br><b>inbetween the bushes and the slab, I'll be in the bushes across
the</b>
<br><b>street."&nbsp; I figured that if one of us got caught, the other
wouldn't.</b>
<br><b>So, I curled up between the bush and slab when I noticed there was
a</b>
<br><b>basment window that had been long broken out just by my head. I
looked</b>
<br><b>inside while I was waiting to be found. The floor had been littered
with</b>
<br><b>leaves that had been blown in and broken pop andbeer bottles. Then
I</b>
<br><b>realized that I shouldn't be able to see in (being so dark). I look
to</b>
<br><b>see where the sorce of light was coming from, and I saw a Lady.
She was</b>
<br><b>so white, in a long victorian gown, with what appeared to be a veil.
She</b>
<br><b>was young, about 18-20. She floated from the farthest corner, cross
the</b>
<br><b>opposite wall, then turned in the corner, and what looked like,
going</b>
<br><b>upstairs. Then she dissappeared. As she floated across, I remember</b>
<br><b>thinking, "Thoses bottles should be making noise if she's shuffling</b>
<br><b>through them".&nbsp; It was very quiet. No crickets, no wind, nothing.
Then,</b>
<br><b>"Got you!" was yelled out right near me. I nearly wet my pants.
Later</b>
<br><b>that night, I asked Jody if she knew if that house was haunted,
she</b>
<br><b>replied "Yup, you saw the lady?". I said "Yup."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About five years later, I was again visiting
Jody, and I asked her</b>
<br><b>about the house. She replyed that it had caved in long ago, and
the</b>
<br><b>concrete slab remains were hauled away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years later, I was out with a group of
friends, traveling the</b>
<br><b>out skirts of my hometown, Regina. A friend suggested that he new
of</b>
<br><b>some haunted places and wanted to take us there. Since my encounter
with</b>
<br><b>the white lady was not terrifying, I agreed to go along. We stopped
at</b>
<br><b>an abanded house. My friend said that it was his aunt's. Windows
were</b>
<br><b>broken out and the floor inside was not too solid. He said that
there</b>
<br><b>was a root cellar under neath the kitchen, but the stairs had rotted
out</b>
<br><b>years ago. We walked into the living room with flash lights in hand.
The</b>
<br><b>furniture remained, now weather wore, with springs popping out.
In one</b>
<br><b>corner, there was marks up the wall, as if fire had streaked up
it. He</b>
<br><b>said that this is where his aunt had died, fallen asleep with a
lit</b>
<br><b>cigarette. We walked back into the kitchen, past the open cellar
door. I</b>
<br><b>could smell the damp, decaying earth coming up, but what frieghtened
me,</b>
<br><b>was the sound a faint whisper that seem to travel up the cellar
stairs.</b>
<br><b>I seemed to say "Was", although, very drawn out. "Wwwwaaaassss."
Then</b>
<br><b>right in my ear, very loudly "OUT". I quickly left the house, believing</b>
<br><b>whatever spoke, did not want me in there. Not until I got outside,
that</b>
<br><b>I saw all my friends were waiting by the car. I was in there by
myself.</b>
<br><b>We got back in the car, and headed out for desination #3 of that
night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were driving along
a dirt road, when we saw a small road turn</b>
<br><b>off of the main one we were on. About twenty feet from the main
road was</b>
<br><b>chain, roping off the road. Hanging from it was a sign "Tresspassers
wil</b>
<br><b>be prosicuted". We got out of the car, and could see a silouette
of a</b>
<br><b>house, against the glow of the city lights. One friend remarked
"Lets</b>
<br><b>make this the last one. We'll just look in the windows."&nbsp; They
stepped</b>
<br><b>over the chain and walked about 15 - 20 feet. I sat on the bumper
of the</b>
<br><b>car, still shaken by the last house, when I noticed a red light
off to</b>
<br><b>the right. It was far off in the distance, and I watched it. My
friends</b>
<br><b>at this time were still walking towards the house. I saw the red
light</b>
<br><b>quickly circle around the back of the house. Then it appeared in
the</b>
<br><b>doorway. I then saw the angry man. He had two glowing red eyes.
He had</b>
<br><b>stepped out onto the porch and looked like he was heading towards
my</b>
<br><b>friends. I&nbsp; yelled "STOP, the porch, run". They stopped, turned
around</b>
<br><b>and began walking back to the car. As they got closer and closer,
they</b>
<br><b>got faster and faster. Behind them, I could see the silouette of
the</b>
<br><b>man; very thin, tall, with red eyes still coming toward us. We climbed</b>
<br><b>back into the car, and drove away. I turned around to see if I could
see</b>
<br><b>the angry man. All I could see is his eyes in the doorway of the
house.</b>
<br><b>We never spoke of it again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next incident happened at my parents house.
I was sitting in the</b>
<br><b>dining room, watching t.v. My parents were down in the family room,</b>
<br><b>watching the other t.v. All of the sudden, I felt a hand on my shoulder.</b>
<br><b>I didn't think too much of it, thinking my arm had fallen asleep
or</b>
<br><b>something. But when the pressure increased and actually slowly pushed
me</b>
<br><b>off the chair, did I become frieghtened. Then it stopped. I sat
back up</b>
<br><b>in the chair, and really didn't give it much thought, until the
pressure</b>
<br><b>began again. "Stop it", I whispered in a angry tone. And it did,
and</b>
<br><b>never happened again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents had a lovely old cat named Rueben.
Ruby (as we called</b>
<br><b>him) was a stray that wandered into our yard one year, and never
left.</b>
<br><b>Ruby had a hurniated muscle on his side, from what our vet told
us, was</b>
<br><b>from some abuse he had suffered many years before he wandered into
our</b>
<br><b>lives. Anyhow, Ruby always needed to leaned against us when he washed</b>
<br><b>his back feet. He rocked back and forth as he licked. A few years
later,</b>
<br><b>Ruby died of kidney failure. Now and then, my mother can feel him,
on</b>
<br><b>the foot of the bed, leaning against her, rocking back and forth.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my husband and I first lived together, we
lived in the basement</b>
<br><b>of a old wartime house, in the cathedral district of Regina. My
sister &amp;</b>
<br><b>her husband lived on the main, and we shared a kitchen and bathroom
with</b>
<br><b>them. Many times, going down the stairs to the basement, I felt
someone</b>
<br><b>push me, just in my lower back, as if to push me down the stairs.
The</b>
<br><b>first time startled me, as I barely caught myself&nbsp; before hitting
the</b>
<br><b>concrete floor below. It happened a few more times, but I learned
to</b>
<br><b>steady my hands against the walls before heading down.&nbsp; I then
started</b>
<br><b>watching out for the ghost, and many times, only out of the courner
of</b>
<br><b>my eye, was a small, fat boy, dressed in short pants. When the fat
boy</b>
<br><b>really gave me a goood shove one day, I spun around, and yelled
"Do that</b>
<br><b>again, and I'll tell your Papa!" It only happened once since then,
and</b>
<br><b>when it did, I turned and said "You don't live here anymore."</b>
<br><b>My sister and her husband lived there for anither year after we
left,</b>
<br><b>and they have not had any troubles from the fat boy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Aunt died just last summer. It came as a shock
to us. I found out</b>
<br><b>that she was sick a week before she died. Two days before she died.
I</b>
<br><b>could hear her laugh. It was a quiet, twittery laugh, like it would</b>
<br><b>sound like if you were spitting out sunflower seeds. She would laugh</b>
<br><b>over and over, in this quiet twitter. When she died two days later,
my</b>
<br><b>mother came home, and told me that she was in good spirits (no pun</b>
<br><b>intened) the night in question. Oh, did I mention, that she&nbsp;
was 450</b>
<br><b>miles north, in a hospital, when I heard the laugh?</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>The Ghost at my House</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MLopez3936@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since my family and I have moved into this
2 story builing it's been</b>
<br><b>pretty scary for my family and I. The first tale I will tell is
the story</b>
<br><b>about the ghost that I have learned to call "Henry". I'm not sure
if it is a</b>
<br><b>male or female but it hasn't complained yet. So I was trying to
sleep and I</b>
<br><b>kept on hearing footsteps coming from the stairs. Then once my mother
was</b>
<br><b>outside and the windcime was swinging back and forth like someone
was messing</b>
<br><b>with it. But there was one blow of wind. Then once my mom was getting
ready</b>
<br><b>for work one morning and she heard a cry, and a slight taping sound
on the</b>
<br><b>other side of the wall. She came in and found that I was asleep
and she could</b>
<br><b>hear the taping coming from the other side of the wall. The other
thing is my</b>
<br><b>big sisters boyfriend found out the t.v. in the middle of the night
was</b>
<br><b>turning on and off....the remote wasn't anywhere in sight. That
was the most</b>
<br><b>scariest thing he has ever seen! And that was the most scariest
thing I've</b>
<br><b>ever experienced in my life!</b>
<br><b>Henry hasn't been around for more then 6 months and I believe he/she
has gone</b>
<br><b>to a better place.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Families Gift</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: crzychica511@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Jessica and I am from a small</b>
<br><b>southwestern town in Illinois. I come from a big</b>
<br><b>family and we all got into a discussion last night</b>
<br><b>about what happens to us sometimes. My oldest aunt is</b>
<br><b>the most "in touch" with the other side. She had twins</b>
<br><b>about 16 and a half years ago and one died. She is my</b>
<br><b>namesake. Ever since then she has been this way.</b>
<br><b>Recently her and my grandmother went to a cemetery in</b>
<br><b>Ruma, Illinois, where many of our relatives are</b>
<br><b>buried. Our root name is Mudd. My aunt saw a man</b>
<br><b>standing against a tree with a hat on, and he talked</b>
<br><b>to her. He was a relative of ours and he told her that</b>
<br><b>he was going to put his hand on top of my grandma's</b>
<br><b>head, and to take a picture. My aunt took the picture</b>
<br><b>and we have used a machine to zoom in, and indeed</b>
<br><b>there is a white image above her hair. The man also</b>
<br><b>told my aunt to walk over to a particular relative's</b>
<br><b>grave, one of a child who died nearly 100 years before</b>
<br><b>her own baby died. She walked over and the tombstone</b>
<br><b>fell right in her hands. When my mother and her</b>
<br><b>siblings grew in this house, they all claim its</b>
<br><b>haunted. Faucets would turn on by themselves, chairs</b>
<br><b>would rock by themselves, etc. I also have weak</b>
<br><b>psychic encounters, and I am trying to get more in</b>
<br><b>touch with it. Every single member of our family has</b>
<br><b>some sort of "gift" and some can just drive by street</b>
<br><b>light after street light and they will turn off. We</b>
<br><b>all seem to look at the clock at 11:11 also. When I</b>
<br><b>was in the midst of being born the same aunt saw her</b>
<br><b>daughter and she told her that I would be fine, and</b>
<br><b>told her the exact time I would be born, weight, etc.</b>
<br><b>She was right on target. At that same aunt's house</b>
<br><b>things will fly off walls, fireplaces, dressers, etc.</b>
<br><b>whenever they talk about dead relatives. In</b>
<br><b>conclusion, our family has a very keen 6th sense and</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In l994 and 95, we moved from Olympia Washington to Tacoma Washington
and we</b>
<br><b>moved into an older home. It seemed very homey and we felt comfortable
there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As time went on things began to occur never to myself but
to my daughter</b>
<br><b>Alisha.&nbsp; When the kids would try to open my bedroom door the
door would start</b>
<br><b>shaking and the handle would rattle tremendously hard.... At first
I didn't</b>
<br><b>believe what they were saying because they have wonderful imaginations,</b>
<br><b>however on this one occasion I witnessed the event I just spoke
about.</b>
<br><b>Alisha would become uncomfortable and swear there was something
that would</b>
<br><b>watch her or fallow her and I didn't believe her.&nbsp; One instance
was when we</b>
<br><b>were getting ready to go somewhere and we were walking out of the
house she</b>
<br><b>felt something behind her and when she turned around after running
to the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the stairs she saw a short figure darker in color with
very red</b>
<br><b>eyes standing at the top looking down at her.&nbsp; It scared her
so bad she</b>
<br><b>cried.&nbsp; It was in the middle of the day.&nbsp; Also on another
occasion her</b>
<br><b>sisters friend Sandra was over and she was knocking on our front
door no one</b>
<br><b>was there but she saw the same figure and red eyes looking out at
her from</b>
<br><b>our window she was also very scared and ran all the way home.&nbsp;
Later that</b>
<br><b>evening she called to tell me what happened.&nbsp; Things would
be misplaced and I</b>
<br><b>would find items in different places.&nbsp; I learned to trust my
children's</b>
<br><b>intuitions as much as my own of which I have a natural ability to
see things</b>
<br><b>of the paranormal and I always have.&nbsp; This time the spirit
seemed very</b>
<br><b>different and made them very uneasy.&nbsp; We moved out and I remember
trying to</b>
<br><b>get in my room one evening before we moved and being locked out
of a room</b>
<br><b>with no locks on the door.&nbsp; That same shaking and rattling
went on and I felt</b>
<br><b>uncomfortable so I had everyone remove themselves from the upstairs
to give</b>
<br><b>the spirit its space.&nbsp; Soon after we went down stairs the door
opened and I</b>
<br><b>was able to go inside the room.&nbsp; Nothing more occurred that
evening and I was</b>
<br><b>not able to see anything but surely felt a presence in my storage
area of my</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; No one liked to go into there you just felt like it
wasn't your space.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We left and have not returned and to this day we have no idea
if the other</b>
<br><b>people who live in the house have had any disturbances or paranormal</b>
<br><b>activities.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for letting me share our story with you all.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Another Ghost Story</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Diddleltl@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;It was a couple of months ago that I decided I needed to get
out of</b>
<br><b>retail. I was tired of the customers and my boss so I took the first
job that fell</b>
<br><b>into my lap:&nbsp; Mall Security.&nbsp; Only problem with that was
that I would</b>
<br><b>still have to put up with the customers unless I decided to do the
Night shift,</b>
<br><b>from 10:30 PM to 6:30 AM.&nbsp; And things were great the first
month.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>crew I was working with were pretty laied back and we all had fun,
except when it</b>
<br><b>came time to do a corridor sweep.&nbsp; Now, if you've never worked
in a mall,</b>
<br><b>the corridors are the long hallways that run behind the stores.&nbsp;
They're</b>
<br><b>pretty much dry wall and cement with pipes and wires running overhead.&nbsp;
But there</b>
<br><b>was one corridor that nobody liked going down.&nbsp; Now, being
the kind of</b>
<br><b>tough-girl I like to be when I think everyone around me is being
a wuss, I</b>
<br><b>always took on this particuliar corridor.&nbsp; I thought nobody
liked it</b>
<br><b>because it was really long, kind of narrow, a little darker and
the pipes hang</b>
<br><b>down a little lower than the other corridors.&nbsp; So I was more
than welcome to it.</b>
<br><b>Sure it was creepy, but I never let myself get too creeped out,
until a</b>
<br><b>couple of nights ago.&nbsp; I was checking the doors in that corridor
to make</b>
<br><b>sure that they were all locked (which is all that we really do anyways)&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>just getting ready to go around the corner by one of the freight
elevators</b>
<br><b>when I heard a kind of crash, like someone had dropped a heavy cooking</b>
<br><b>pan. The mall is very new and there is still a lot of construction
going on so</b>
<br><b>I reasoned that it was some peice of equipment that had just now
fallen over</b>
<br><b>after being put away improperly.&nbsp; But I still took great caution
when I</b>
<br><b>came around the corner, kind of peeked around it before I actuially
continued</b>
<br><b>checking the doors.&nbsp; All seemed well until I came to one of
the doors that</b>
<br><b>led to an unoccupied suite that was under construction.&nbsp; I
usuially don't</b>
<br><b>bother checking these doors because the construction workers get
tired of</b>
<br><b>us locking them out and take the locking mecanism out of the door
knob.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>as I passed, I saw a sudden burst of movement by the door, although
there was</b>
<br><b>nothing there to move.&nbsp; I kind of froze in my tracks.&nbsp;
At this point, I</b>
<br><b>was supposed to call the office on the radio and told them that
I'd heard a</b>
<br><b>noise and that I might have seen some strange movement so they could
call the</b>
<br><b>police to investigate, but I didn't.&nbsp; I reached out for the
door knob and</b>
<br><b>slowly turned it.&nbsp; Then, the door opened quickly, about an
inch and</b>
<br><b>slammed shut again, by itself.&nbsp; It had ripped itself out of
my hand to open an</b>
<br><b>inch. Then it started to just open and slam shut over and over again,
very</b>
<br><b>rapidly.&nbsp; Well, I didn't stick around too long when it started
and could still hear</b>
<br><b>it when I got out of the corridor and out into the mall.&nbsp; I
called the office</b>
<br><b>on the radio and told them what had just happened.&nbsp; We all
knew the</b>
<br><b>construction workers were gone for the night.&nbsp; There was nobody
in the mall but us and</b>
<br><b>the guys cleaning the floors.&nbsp; My boss just said to stay out
of the corridor</b>
<br><b>for the rest of the night/&nbsp; There was a slight "I told you
so," tone to her</b>
<br><b>voice.&nbsp; I went back in the morning with one of the guys and
we checked the</b>
<br><b>suite out.&nbsp; There was nobody in there, not even a peice of
construction</b>
<br><b>equipment and there was no evidence that anyone had been there.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;He's mad now!</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anthony.jones@littlerock.af.mil</b><b></b>
<p><b>I wanted to pass along this story. My grandfather passed away in
October of</b>
<br><b>96. He was sort of like an anchor for our family and everything
revolved</b>
<br><b>around him. After he died my granny's health slowly deteriorated.
She was</b>
<br><b>rushed to the hospital one night in march of 97. She died but the
doctors</b>
<br><b>brought her back. Anyway the house that my grandparents used to
live in was</b>
<br><b>always a warm and loving place and always had a welcoming feel to
it. About</b>
<br><b>3 months after my granny was brought back, some of my aunts went
up to clean</b>
<br><b>the old house and get what was left of my granny's clothes out.
They found</b>
<br><b>that none of them could enter the house. it felt cold and evil.
One of my</b>
<br><b>aunt said that she felt hate and depression coming from inside of
the house.</b>
<br><b>not one of them ever made it pass the door. We hired a commercial
custodian</b>
<br><b>to clean it.....nope...he had the same experience and barely made
it to the</b>
<br><b>porch before he gave in and ran. I have always been one to doubt
things I</b>
<br><b>believed as impossible. After Christmas in 99 my wife and I decided
to stop</b>
<br><b>in and check on the old house on our way back home. We got out and
walked</b>
<br><b>around, checked the windows and the shed. Then I decided to go inside.
I</b>
<br><b>used the key we kept hid in the shed and opened the door. I flung
the door</b>
<br><b>open and almost instantly I felt pure hate and anger pouring out.
My wife</b>
<br><b>felt it too and got a bad headache immediately.&nbsp; I slammed
the door and</b>
<br><b>couldn't get over the sick feeling and nausea swept over me. I left
and</b>
<br><b>never have gone back. I personally think that my grandfather is
mad because</b>
<br><b>of us bringing my granny back. thanks for listening.</b><b></b>

owner died in the explossion.I myself, and a few friends wittnessed a haunting
there at one time. Back in 1985, My two friends and I got bold. We heard
things about buffalo Ridge, and wanted to check it out for our selves.
It was 12:00A.M and we had a 12pack of Budwiser, We drove to Cleaves, and
headed up to Buffalo Ridge. By now it was 2:00A.M We stoped at the place
I think were the Cremetorium was located. There was nothing there but a
field. The car was running and the headlights were shining twards the field.There
was nothing there.&nbsp; I turned off the engine,and headlights. All of
a sudden in the field, We saw what looked like 3 kids, picking up flower
or something,one was doing summersalts. I turned on my lights and nothing
was there. I turned the lights back off and there they were again. It lasted
for 5 min. Then we heard a scrapeing along side of my car, but nothing
was there! This warned me that it was time to get the Hell Out Of There</b>
