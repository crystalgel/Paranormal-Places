<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Many times we got stories or questions
here at the Shadowlands that tell about seeing or experiencing ghosts once
or for a matter of a few days never to see them or experience the same
ghost again.&nbsp; I believe in many cases that this may be wandering or
visiting ghosts.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Wandering or visiting ghosts are ghosts
who are on their way to a certain place or area and they get distracted
or curious about energy we may be releasing or an action we may be doing.
They stop at our homes or areas until their curiosity is abated.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another thing that could cause these visits is the fact that ghosts know
when a person can sense them. In a world where most people cannot or won't
see a ghost this can make a ghost want to check in on the sensitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;
These visits can last a few minutes to a few days depending on the ghosts
and our reaction to them. Then the ghost leaves to continue on its path
to wherever it was headed before it stopped to visit.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This theory could help explain why many
ghosts are only experienced for a short time, or a haunting to only last
days.</FONT>
