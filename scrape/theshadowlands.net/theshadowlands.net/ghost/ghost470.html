 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It was
at bodi ghost town. I had
taken my phone with me because I didn't have a camera and decided to
take some
pictures. But apparantly there were some things extra in those photos
(unfortunately I no longer have that phone that posesses those photos.)
when I
took a picture of the saloon. Nothing that was living could be seen in
that
room. But when I took a picture and looked at it there seemed to be a
black cat
at the top of it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
interesting picture was taken in a random house, this picture was of a
babies
cradle. Again nothing living but me was in there. But after I took the
picture
there was a small transparent hand visible on the ledge of the cradle.
A baby
hand.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last photo had
been taken
through the window of the sheriffs house. Nothing had been done to
distort the
photo but when I looked at it it had swirled up into a blur. I was
trying to
take a picture of the desk but when it swirled the blue was white and
all
around it was brown and the white seemed to look like the shape of a
human
silhouette.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One thing
though I could
not get a picture of. This was a poltregeist I found in the steeple. I
was
looking at the church organ at the back of the room when all of a
sudden the
bench moved back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">About a
year ago I slept over at my
friend Clay's house.He had a 3 bedroom 2 story house connected to
another house,
looked about 20-30 years old. He had only one roommate so one of the
rooms
stayed unoccupied except for one of his two dogs which he would cycle
betwwen
his room and this unoccupied room every three months.But anyways there
was a
good sized bed and some fish tanks, a real kicka** guestroom.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well Im sleeping in this room one
night.I
wake up out of a deep sleep.I can remeber wondering where the hell I
was but
after about 2 minutes the sound of his fish tanks reminded me of my
location.I
stared at the wall wondering how many more hours left I had to sleep(I
had work
in the morning at 9am)and assured myself I had plenty of time in which
to get a
good sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I decided to start
getting
busy sleeping and repositioned myself to my right side.When I did, I
see this
person standing at the side.I stared for about 2 or 3 seconds trying to
recongnize who this was, almost beginning to smile and be like,"what
the
hell are you doing?" but I quickly realized that this was a complete
stranger.I remeber this person had shoulder length blond or grey
hair,glasses,
a multi colored robe or something and a wide sinster looking smile.Just
this
expression that it was enjoying the situation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I quickly panicked cause my instincts told me something horribly
bad was
going down.I screamed at the top of my voice,"GET THE F*CK AWAY FROM
ME!!!!" as I jumped out of bed and threw a right punch at this person
and
right as i did, it just vanished.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I
sat there in bed wondering what the hell just happend to me.I went
through
every possible explanation. Plus i was a little embarrassed for
screaming so
loud at 3 in the morning.....I stayed awake til the sun came up.every
now and
then I'd start to slowly nod out, but i was so scared when i did, i
would throw
a punch wildly out of fear this person would be messing with me.I even
accidently hit his dog as it was placing ita head at the edge of the
bed...............think about this every night as i go to bed.always
looking
over my shoulder........<o:p></o:p></span></p>

love your website. The
stories are cool. My cousin and I have sent a couple in,anyway I have
two
stories that I would like to include to your website both relate to one
of your
stories about a glowing ball in Mesa cemetery. It was not in the same
place,
but related only because they are both of glowing ball experiences.
These are
true as verified through family members, anyways as for the stories. My
grandmother and my uncle were driving home one night, I forget where
from, but
I think it might have been his friends' house, as they were going
through the
swamps to get to their <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">house,
they saw this glowing green
big ball in the sky, it might have been classified as something that
was in the
swamp, they left and it was gone. The second incident with a different
color of
a ball that was orange, my grandma just got home from a garden club
meeting, my
grandpa had said he wanted some iced tea, so she went inside and saw a
ball in
orange in the sky, she went back outside with the iced tea and didn't
see it,
she went back inside and didnt see it, so she asked my grandpa and he
said he
didnt, as I said this is entirely true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

17 years but it still
happens to this day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened on a
summer night on the back road connecting Mt Clare to West
Milford...known to
the locals as Alfie Hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The area had
very few houses at the time and one house stood out...a brand new
gorgeous
home<span style="">&nbsp; </span>right at the crest of the dirt
road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man who lived there built it
for his wife and they had a daughter who was I believe around 8 years
old at
the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember traveling the road
(<span style="">&nbsp; </span>more of a cow path really) and
watching the home being constructed. Once it was finished<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it always looked so pristine and happy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But<span
 style="">&nbsp;
</span>one night I was coming through<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>this pitch black stretch of land and saw the mother and daughter
in the
middle of the road both in what looked like night gowns in a mudd
puddle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see them standing there as
I
approached<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the moon seemed to shine
on them alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got to them<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>they disappeared in front of me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was not alone in the car....so I asked did
anyone else just see that and everyone just sat there too scared to
answer.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the light of day, early
early<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was crossing back across the
hill and saw 6<span style="">&nbsp; </span>maybe 7 police cruisers
and an ambulance...crime scene tape everywhere and one covered figure
in the
grass by the house and several officers crouched by the road<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>...beside where the mudd puddle was the night
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently the man had long
suffered from depression and killed his wife and daughter before
returning to
the house and killing himself. The officers said that they speculated
he had
committed the act<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the night prior to
them being discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still on summer
nights<span style="">&nbsp; </span>you can see the girl and her mom
looking down into the puddle in their night gowns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">One time
I was in Portland, Oregon
where I came upon several old abandoned Victorian mansions. I enjoyed
walking
through them. I decided to go<span style="">&nbsp; </span>down to
the basement where I came upon many doors laying flat on top of each
other. I&#8217;d
never seen so many doors with glass knobs. Then there was a crack on
the side
of the building which allowed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>these
beams to come through. Suddenly I heard an old man&#8217;s voice that asked
&#8220;Are you
the owner? Am I trespassing?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and there was this man with long
dirty fingernails and a straggly long beard. He had absolutely no color
to his
skin. He looked like a wax figure as had a yellowish tinge to his skin.
He was
lying on top of several newspapers and was eating Peanut butter and
jelly with
an old rusty spoon out of some jars. I told him that I too was
trespassing and
not to fear me. I asked who he was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and
he told me that he was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a mountain man
who had died on the mountain close by. I said &#8220;If you died, how can you
be
talking to me?&#8221; He replied that he had been dead for several days and
that he
had opened his eyes and he saw a tiny woman on a cloud who spoke to him
and
told him that he would be given another chance to live. She told him
he&#8217;d have
to leave the mountain immediately. She asked him to stand up. He told
her that
he was very weak and doubted if he could do so. He said that he then
felt some
type of heat running up his legs and he stood up and was able to walk
down the
hill. He found out he had some money in his pocket so he stopped and
bought
some peanut butter and jelly. He was very hungry. Then he came upon
these
abandoned houses , so he came to find this basement as sanctuary. It
all seemed
really freaky to me, but I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>promised him
I&#8217;d return the next day with some sandwiches. He asked me to make sure
the meat
was tender, because he had no teeth.Anyways,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I woke up with this urgent desire to take him the sandwiches. I
bathed
and hopped on a bus to the location. When I went down to the basement<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was amazed that there was absolutely no
trace that anyone had ever been there. It was really spooky. The hair
on my
arms stood up and I got the hell out of there. The place was extremely
dusty
but there were no newspapers on the ground and no empty jars left
around. I
remembered that there was a large trash in the yard, so I went to check
it. It
was full of water but no garbage. I was convinced I&#8217;d been talking to a
ghost
or apparition. It was very spooky. I&#8217;ll never forget that experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

husband (Steve), brother and
myself were staying in a condo at Sunrise Village in Killington, VT to
go
skiing. It was in April of this year and there was a special on the Fox
news
channel entitled &#8220;Does the Devil Really Exist&#8221; or something of that
nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must have really affected me as
I later
dreamt that my husband and I were before the devil and he was going to
decide
which one of our souls to claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
making an argument to spare Steve and take me instead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember waking up as &#8216;someone&#8217; was
grabbing my left calf and tugging on it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked around and saw my husband was just coming in the
bedroom from
the bathroom and he saw my distress as I was waking up and shouting for<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>him to turn on the light as I was waving my
hand around me to see if I could detect any &#8216;cold spots&#8217; (I
enthusiastically
read all I can on the paranormal)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
VIVIDLY recall the hand (fingers and thumb wrapped around my left calf-
it was
a warm hand) and know without a doubt it wasn&#8217;t my husband&#8217;s (he was in
the
bathroom) or my sleeping brother on the living room couch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was sleeping tucked in with the sheets and
blankets tucked under the mattress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think whatever it was, was trying to wake me up from a horrible dream!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps my father who passed away five years
prior?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don&#8217;t know. &#8230; What I do know is
that my husband believes it was a dream and he won&#8217;t accept any other
explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This infuriates me to no
end!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know it was real!<span style="">&nbsp;

work on your website- it&#8217;s great/<o:p></o:p></span></p>

few months ago me and a
friend of mine(whose name i will protect) were outside at 3 am. i take
residence in a thickly wooded area with very few neighbors. my dog
started to
act up and backed away. we heard noises coming from the woods so we
went to
investigate (with arms). not long from here we heard a shouting<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>of some man about a mile away. it wasnt drunk
or happy shouting but you could tell it was distressed. and in a
strange
pattern the dogs across the country side started barking very loudly
and
violently. it seemed to be in a circle around the acres of farmland.
the noises
became louder and closer (crashing)and faster. we both took shelter for
the
night still with weapons. the next morning we went to the woods where
we heard
this and discovered a strange trail of damage and destruction. i do
live in a
very strange area and i eliminated the possibilities of a human or
animal. im

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I've got
another experience I'd
thought you might find interesting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
October 2006 I got orders to move from Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska
to
Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. My ex wife and I decided to drive
because we
didn't want to get to the next station and not have a car. We spent the
weekend
with her relatives in Wasilla then made the drive to Haines Junction
and stayed
the night. We really didn't sleep well that night the room was rather
uncomfortable. So we left at like 0500 and began the trip into Canada.
We took
the ALCAN (Alaska-Canada) Highway and pushed into the Yukon Territory,
stopped
and had a rather awful lunch, but my daughter (who was a year old)
needed to
get out of the car for a while. We pulled into Whitehorse around 1800
and
decided to stop for the night. We chose the Best Western hotel (mostly
due to
the military giving us a list of which hotels were best for us to stay
in, and
that was one). As we were checking in noticed a rather cold spot by a
cartoony
statue of a Canadian Mountie, mind you this was October and things were
getting
cooler but not that cold. I believe we had a room on the 6th floor and
let my
ex wife and daughter get settled while I brought in the things we
needed for
the night. While I was making the trips to the car and back to the room
I
learned that this Best Western was once a saloon/brothel, I had
mentioned the
cold spot to my ex wife and she had stated that when she had made the
trip to
Alaska in '02 (this was two years before our marriage and I did not
know her
before '03) that she had stayed on the 4th floor and experienced
similar cold
spots and orbs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well we decided to have
dinner then turn in we'd been in the car for over 12 hours and we
sorely needed
a rest after the awful night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
ex wife said she had forgotten something in the car and for me to get
it as she
was going to give our daughter a bath and put her to bed. I went out
from the
restaurant in the hotel, and as I was walking to the entrance of the
hotel I
kept feeling cold spots in various places, I also felt like someone had
brushed
up against me, and like a hand on my shoulder, of course no one else
was around
except the front desk clerk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It got
stranger as I came back in after getting what it was (I have since
forgotten)
and got on the elevator again I got this feeling like I was being
watched or
something was there with me, now I was the only one in the elevator,
but for
some reason it stopped on the 4th floor, and when the doors opened an
odor of
tobacco filled the area (this is a non smoking hotel) and what can be
best
described as a wet dog smell filtered through the hallway. <span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When I finally got back to the 6th floor,
those cold spots seemed more spread out then before, and I swear I saw
some
floating orbs in the window overlooking Whitehorse (by this time it was
around
1930-2000 at night) of course when I looked again nothing was there, I
also
heard something that sounded like someone banging pots and pans,
obviously
there was no one there and you weren't allowed to bring such things
into this
hotel. I got back to our room and told my ex wife about it and she said
she had
a similar experience in '02, without the pots and pans banging noise.
We slept
the rest of the night without any further disturbances and decided to
head out
at 0630, while I was loading the car (it was still kind of dark
outside) I
swear I saw what looked like a prospector from the latter part of the
1890's of
course when I looked up he was gone. When I went back into the lobby
near that
cartoony Canadian Mountie statue the cold spot really intensified and
when I
got to the area where the elevator was I saw someone out the window and
I
thought nothing of it but once I got closer to the elevator I noticed
that
person was wearing Victorian Era clothing, he passed by the window and
disappeared. Again I told my ex wife and she by now was picking up on
animal
spirits as she called them, and she was telling me it was time to get
moving.
But she noticed the intense cold spot by that statue as well and like
our trip
to Rika's Road house in Alaska back in '04, she was quick to get out of
the
hotel with our daughter and get to the car, while I checked out and
brought the
bags out. Again I felt something brush against me and something touch
my
shoulder, however this time the hand felt cold and clammy almost, of
course I
turn around and no one is there, just that cartoony Mountie statue. We
got out
of there okay without any further strangeness save for a feeling of
sorrow,
then of course I had found out it was a Saloon/Brothel from the
Alaskan-Canadian Gold Rush of 1898, which could explain several things,
but it
was the first time I actually feared spirits/ghosts, and that was
because of my
daughter who was a year old at the time. Again my ex wife and I would
talk
about that till our divorce, it was probably the first time I've ever
felt
animal spirits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Close to
20 years ago we bought a
home in an historic neighborhood. We went to see it on a lark, thinking
we
could never afford a home on St. Paul&#8217;s famous Summit Avenue. But for
some
reason, this home was not moving, and the owners had dramatically
dropped the
price and it was now in our range, at the tippy top of our range, but
in our
range. It had everything on our wish list and more. I told my husband
Jim &#8220;you
go back and sell that other place, I&#8217;ll wait here until those people
get out of
our house.&#8221; The first thing I did after closing was to put a cane next
to the
fireplace, reminiscent of the scene in &#8220;Miracle on 34th Street&#8221; when
Susan
(Natalie Wood) gets the house she had seen in her dreams.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a 1922 Georgian Revival, masonry
construction. It needed some TLC, but with leaded glass windows and
walnut
woodwork, craftsman tiles, etc., we could come up with TLC. Someone had
made
some very bad decorating decisions in the 1970&#8217;s. Dark oak kitchen
redo, peachy
wall to wall carpet. Well, let me say, after 20 years, we&#8217;re on year 3
of the 5
year plan to fix everything. More on that later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
moved in Dec. 10. Shortly after, maybe a
week or so later,. Jim came to me to ask if I had noticed anything odd
around
the house. I had but I asked what he meant. He said, he didn't know if
he was
having eye problems, but he kept seeing "dark lights" dashing around
corners and under things and out of the corners of his eye.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>To which I said "you too!" I hadn't
said anything because I thought he would think I was crazy.I said that
I
thought maybe it was a refraction from the leaded glass in the windows.
But it
was happening day or night in various rooms with different
fenestration. Other
visitors to the house during that time also noticed them. For example,
there
was the day I was meeting the next door neighbor when one went by us. I
ignored
it, assuming it wasn&#8217;t really there, but was amazed to see her follow
it with
her eyes and turn her head to follow it to the next room. &#8220;Do you have
a Scotty
dog?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Uh, no,&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stumbled,
clearing my throat. &#8220;Black cat?&#8221; &#8220;Uh, no, I&#8217;m not sure, there, well,
we&#8217;ve seen
those flashes, we think it&#8217;s a reflection from the windows.&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t
remember
anything like that when Rick and Angel were here&#8221; the neighbor added,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask
Angel when I see her.&#8221; My sister came to visit shortly after we moved
in and
also witnessed these events. When I spoke to her about this recently
she said
&#8220;I never believed in any of that crap, but then I ran into one of those
dark
things at the top of the stairs, and it really creeped me out.&#8221;The
&#8220;dark
lights&#8221; were one thing. Then the medallions started.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were 5 or 6 Saint Benedict medallions
plus one miraculous medal. It happened each time in a different room of
the
house, spread out over the course of about 2 weeks. As either Jim or
myself
would be leaving a room the person would hear a coin fall, well, here a
coin
hit a hard surface, turn around and find a medallion. This even
happened in
rooms with wall-to-wall carpet where it could not have made the sound
that was
heard. The first medallion was very worn and we could barely read it.
Each
successive one appeared newer and newer. The final one was the
miraculous
medal. We got some water in the basement &amp; I was down there
vacuuming it
up. I had gone over the same spot over and over like you do with water.
I put
the hose down, pull it back, &amp; behind the hose, where it should've
been
sucked up there was something shiny. I picked it up and it wasn't
shiny, it
changed right in front of me. It was a very very old, tarnished and
worn
miraculous medal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the previous
owners came by to get some mail that had come for them we asked if the
medals
were theirs, thinking that somehow they had just been knocked loose
somehow
from someplace. They said they never saw them before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went to the Roman Catholic church down the
street and asked a nun about the family <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">that
built the house, we live in an
historic district and had some information. They weren't from that
parish. I
told the nun the story and she started humming the twilight zone theme.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I did discover that the original owners, the
wife actually, came from a family closely associated with the
Benedictines.
They had several family members who were members of Benedictine orders
and they
had also founded two Benedictine schools in Saint Paul, a women&#8217;s
college and a
girls&#8217; high school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the spring we
started some repair and restoration. We found that in many ways the
house was
tremendously overbuilt, complicating needed repairs. Like needing air
hammers
to dismantle the 2 foot thick reinforced concrete garage roof/deck that
was
leaking. That's when I saw the figure on the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was just putting something in the hall
closet then walking a few steps into the master bedroom when I saw Jim
coming
up the stairs out of the corner of my eye. I said something to him and
there
was no answer. So I stuck my head out of the bedroom door and I see a
man in
tan pants and a white shirt at the top 2 steps of the first flight of
steps
round the corner at our little mezzanine, and as he goes to mount the
second
set of steps he disappears through a sharp dividing line like a pane of
glass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had done some research on the
property
abstract and saw that the people who built the house, the F's passed
ownership
to their daughter (her married name was given) in 1958. I looked up
that name
in the directory and called. Unfortunately the daughter had passed
away, but
her husband was thrilled to hear from us. He said it was a shame he
just tossed
the blueprints from the house not long ago, but he had all the family
pictures,
many of the house when it was new. And of course, pictures of Mr. F.
Yes, that
was the man on the stair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the most
part the house has been quiet. We had one other episode where we were
having
more work done on the garage roof and three season porch. It has been a
constant headache that has had to be rebuilt 3 times so far. On the
second
rebuild, I awoke in the middle of the night and thought I saw my
husband
leaning on the dresser as if he were sick. I saw him very clearly,
bracing
himself like his stomach was killing him, but he was dressed, in a
white shirt
with a square hem and tan pants. I started to get up on my elbows and
realized
Jim was in bed beside me. This was the only time in all these events
that I
felt fear. I&#8217;m embarrassed to say, I dove under the covers! I stayed
there,
afraid, trying to figure out what to do. When I peaked out again the
apparition
was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. H. said that his son was
staying with his grandpa, Mr F. overnight when he was 8 and called home
in the
morning saying &#8220;grandpa&#8217;s asleep on the bathroom floor and I can&#8217;t wake
him
up.&#8221; He had died of a heart attack during the night, but, he had gotten
out of
bed to go into the bathroom because he wasn&#8217;t feeling well. Like the
apparition
I saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. H, the son-in-law, said Mr. F
would periodically be walking through the house, stop, slap his hand on
the
woodwork or somesuch and say "nothing but the best." The house was
his pride and joy, his crowning achievement. It's sad to think of
someone so
tied to a material thing, although we love it too. When we were
replacing the
awful 1970's kitchen flooring with a more period-appropriate tile, only
half-joking I held one up and said "is this ok with you Mr. F?" It
must've been, because things have gradually settled down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It's been more than 16 years since Mr. F put
in his last appearance, RIP. Jim and I were not the only ones who had
seen the
"dark lights", guests had also and there is general agreement that
they are gone also. Curiously, when you look at the property abstract
there are
owners who are "short timers" and "long timers". I suppose
we passed the test and Mr. F. trusts us with his pride and joy.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The real test came last summer as we had our
3rd rebuild of the garage/porch area, the most extensive yet. We
discovered
that the metal roof apron that surrounded half the house did not have
appropriate support and should have been replaced the first time out.
After one
of the most extensive rebuilds to date&#8230; well, no Mr. F. this time.
Maybe we
fixed the roof for good? Was that what he was after? Mr. H. had also
told us
that the porch area was a constant headache for Mr. F. also. Did he
just want
someone to fix that darn porch the right way for once and for all?<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I should also say that after all this time I
have just learned that St. Benedict medals are sometimes used in
exorcisms and
are used for protection from evil, demons and haunting. Were we being
given
these medals for protection? By whom were they given? Had the medals
originally
been placed around the house by a living human to hold Mr. F. and the
&#8220;dark
lights&#8221; in place, and we somehow disturbed them and set them loose? If
so, why
did things quiet down?Your answers are as good as mine or anyone else&#8217;s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">When I
was in middle school we went
on a youth hostelling trip to Welsh Bicknor in Herefordshire, England.
The
youth hostel was an old rectory and stood right next to a beautiful old
church.
Of course we'd all heard stories from the year above us about the place
being
haunted, so we were already setting ourselves up for a few days of
ghoulish
fun! As soon as night fell on the 1st day the girls in the dorm above
us said
they could hear voices, their room was freezing cold all the time and
they
refused to turn out their lights. The next night we had a campfire in
the field
next to the old church and did the usual singing of songs and munched
on
marshmallows. When the time came to return to the hostel we began to
walk up
the bank next to the wall/hedge of the church, all of a sudden several
of us
saw 'things' crawling along next to us up through the hedge into the
church
yard. There were loads of them and the best way I can describe them is
that
they looked like bigger versions of Gollum from Lord of the Rings.
Emaciated
men, all skin and bone, crawling through the grass. It wasnt a split
second
thing either, they were there for a few minutes. It was so long ago I
don't
remember how any of us reacted, I think I was stunned into silence. The
hostel
staff said they couldn't see anything. At that time one of the girls
was 'into'
Wicca and although all she did was place some gemstones on a gravestone
and
said a prayer, I'm wondering if this angered any spirits? Another
strange
experience I had was when I bought a book called 'The A-Z of British
Ghosts', I
always felt weird when I was reading it...duh you're reading ghost
stories and
freaking yourself out I hear you say...but wait...the room always used
to turn
freezing cold when I read the book and I'd get an overwhelming feeling
of being
watched, but the scariest thing that occurred was after I photocopied
some
pages for my friend who lived around the corner at the time and already
had
trouble with a spirit in her home. As soon as she took the pages into
her house
the haunting intensified, she saw a man in mirrors, heard things being
pushed
down the stairs, remote controls vanished and always appeared under the
cushions on the sofa, she even claimed her mother became possessed on
several
occassions. It wasnt until she burned the pages that things quietened
down and
they eventually had the house blessed. They moved soon after. I daren't
open
that book any more. My ex and I used to go ghost hunting frequently.
One day he
and his friend went to our usual spot to check it out in the day time
as we
sometimes did. As they were driving they noticed cottages and lots of
land that
they didnt recognise. Their other friends, one of whom was a skeptic,
were
waiting for them in the car park, but when my ex pulled up there were
no other
cars there, yet when they rang, the others were insistant that they
were indeed
in the car park to the mansion smoking methols. After some shouting and
swearing my ex and his friend got out and began exploring the area.
After a
while my ex rang the others again and told them they were going to the
garage
nearby to get cigarettes and to meet them there. Again, on the way back
they
noticed the same cottages. When they got to the garage their friends
were
already there (neither group saw the other pass on the roads) and swore
blind
they were indeed in the car park. They suggested they all go back to
the
mansion. When my ex and his friend were driving along the country lane
they
were amazed to find that the cottages they had seen on their way there
were
many more in number and the fields were completely different and sure
enough on
the floor of the car park were several menthol cigarette butts. My ex
was
convinced they had experienced some kind of time 'warp' for want of a
better
word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for reading!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

friends were<span style="">&nbsp; </span>former owners of Adams House
in Birmingham.
It is now torn down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
am from Ohio..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few times that I visited
and stayed
over<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at the Adams house I had<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>some very strange experiences.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
one was home that day but my friend (
the Owner of the house and I) We got to talking about " The Lost Books
Of
The Bible"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after having breakfast
and over coffee..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She happened to
mention that her son ,who collected books, had these books that we were
talking
about. She invited me up stairs where he had his book collection.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We were thumbing through the pages of a
couple of books.. When we heard the down stairs door open and footsteps
walking
across the floor stopping at the bottom of the steps.. She called out
thinking
it was her son who may have come home. No answer. So we hurriedly left
his
books and went down the steps.. There was no one to be found in the
house!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time I was visiting her and
family
she was in the kitchen and I was helping her with the dish's.. After we
were
done I excused myself to go to her bath room which was located in the
kitchen.
It was a very small bathroom with just a commode and room enough for a
sink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was washing my hands when all of a
sudden I
felt the floor sink out from under me.. The sensation was like going
down in a
elevator and then<span style="">&nbsp; </span>back up . It was all
very sudden.. I came out of that bathroom shaken and told my friend
what had
just transpired.. She said I was not the only one that experienced that
phenomenon. She said she had herself and also a couple of other of her
friends
that had used her downstairs bath room.. I had used her up stairs
bathroom but
never experienced anything there..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
built a small addition to their home which functioned as a Library for
their
collection of books and also served as a guest room for out of town
guest such
as me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always kept a light on in that
room. It had an off effect . It felt cold all the time plus along with
the previous
experiences I had there I felt<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a little
unsettled in that room.. After visiting and late hours I was very tired
and
thought nothing could awaken me.. I closed my eyes and snuggled in only
to feel
my covers being lifted up or so it seemed.. When I opened my eyes to
look
nothing was there.. Finally I drifted off to sleep to suddenly awaken
to the
light going on and off in the lamp.. I got up and checked to see if the
bulb
was in tight and it was!! Needless to say I had a sleepless night that
night....<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former owners of the house
had many more
experiences there.. They have many stories to tell about the Adams
House...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I have
an interesting story to
share, maybe it can be added to the Alaska section? I've had some
experiences
before, growing up in Northern Virginia most of it had been with
Colonial and
Civil War era spirits and occurrences, I have also been to the
Winchester house
in San Jose, which in it's own right is very very disturbing. However
this
story is probably the most disturbing one in recent times, that I have
been
involved with. Back in 2004 I was stationed at Eielson Air Force Base
which
near Fairbanks, Alaska. During that summer is was really warm and my
wife at
the time was pregnant with our daughter (we've since divorced) and
recommended
we get out of the apartment for a while. Seeing as it was a down day
and we
really had nothing better to do I agreed, though I was still being
cautious
about going out due to the fires we'd had since May, and the smoke was
hanging
overhead so it looked really really overcast outside. I asked where we
should
go and she said let's drive out to an area called Delta Junction, which
leads
to the ALCAN (Alaska-Canada) Highway. Well we noticed there was a Gold
Rush era
(1898) house and what looked to be a tool shack, the name of this
tourist
attraction was Rika's Road House, as we soon found out, it was
originally a
boarding house for prospectors and later became a farm, now it's just
an Alaska
tourist attraction to show what "Last Frontier" life was like in
1898. We decided to get some snacks (beef jerky, slim jims and soda)
then come
back and check the place out. We first walked about the boarding house
itself,
and I noticed cold spots in various places, mostly in the gift shop. My
ex-wife
said she had felt someone or something brush by her when there was
only,
myself, the cashier, and her in the gift shop. I was on the opposite
side of
the room from my ex-wife and the cashier was behind the counter. One of
the
windows that overlooked the Delta river (I believe that is what it
called, I
can't remember) I noticed that my reflection in it seemed to stay
still, yet I
was moving---kind of freaked me out. So we bought some minor things to
send
home to my family in Virginia and decided to check out the grounds.
Before
leaving the house itself I swear I saw an Alaskan native out in the
field, but
when I looked up again no one was there. Now here's where it gets
really odd,
we walked into the "tool shack" my ex-wife got about half way in and
turned around and left, she said she felt something that was not right
at all.
It took me a little longer to feel it, but I did, now mind you it was
like 90
degrees outside and where I had stepped in this old tool shack felt
like it was
-10 degrees, and this was in front of what looked to me like a
harvesting tool
of some sort. Anyway, I lingered in there about 5 minutes longer than
my
ex-wife did, and I began to smell one of the most pungent odors I have
ever
smelt before, it was border line nauseating, my ex-wife told me in the
car that
she had felt a sudden feeling of sorrow, all I had felt was the cold
spot and
the smell. I did not notice any ghost lights or anything...though with
the 24
hours of day light in the Alaskan summer I doubt I would have been able
to see
them, though I will say it did feel like something was in that shack
and it
wasn't very nice. Needless to say we never went back after that summer,
but it
was an experience we did talk about till our divorce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="">&nbsp;</span>When I was twenty-three years old I was
attending ultrasound school. About three years prior to this my foster
mother
had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. This is a cancer that has a
very poor
prognosis. Although, she had went into remission she later had a
reoccurrence
in which the cancer had spread throughout her body. Well to make a long
story
short I was very broke in school and did not have a phone, and I had
not spoken
with them in a couple of months. I attended school in the evenings, and
was up
studying late frequently, and on a random night at about one in the
morning I
felt a need to stop what I was doing and write two different poems
telling her
I knew I had to let her go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day
when I came home there was a note on the door from the sheriffs
department.
Before I even looked at it I knew that my foster mother had died. After
speaking with my foster father he told me she had died the night before
around
one am. This may not be a ghost story, but yet it was an extraordinary
experience that no one could ever convince me was coincidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="">&nbsp;</span>My fiance Robbie took me to this B&amp;B, The
Island Hotel located in cedar key, FL to propose to me this past New
Year's
Eve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because I was taking medication
(antibiotics) for the flu, I couldn't drink that entire weekend, so
therefore
this was NOT some drunken vision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
place is really haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although I have
loved "haunted" and ghost stories all my life, I didn't expect to
have an experience there...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are a
number of supposed ghosts there at that hotel based on what their site
shows,
but I dind't expect anything to really happen.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was getting ready for our big New Year's Eve dinner.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My hair was up in rollers and I was standing
infront of the mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all popped
out at once and fell to the floor!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
happened several times; every morning of our stay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>After
my hair was set (I don't wash it but once a week) the shower spirted
water in
my face every time I said to my fiance, "Is this place really
haunted" or something along those lines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>See, it had been a brothel at one time and the ghost of a
prostitute was
supposed to "live" in our room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since I was taking a shower, he would come in there too, and
chat with
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shower spurted me in the face
every time I said something about the hotel...<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The scariest thing is that there is supposed to be a ghost of a
soldier
standing guard at the top balcony doors, leading outside on the 2nd
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's only visable at dawn and lasts
a few
seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't see him, but I did get
up at dawn to see if I could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't,
so I went across to the bathroom which was located (seperately) across
the hall
from our room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The light bulb turned
off!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was scared to death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it just turned right off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I "didn't
finish" and ran back to
our room!<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another
experience that happened to us both
was that we had gone out for the day and decided to nap before dinner.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He woke up before I did and apparently was
too arfraid to say anything, because I woke up and there he was,
saying,
"wake up, look!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's turning all by
it's self!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he was talking about
the door knob; it as one of those old, blown lead glass door knobs that
creek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very, very slowly turning
back and forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We laid there, watched
it and tried to see if there was a shadow of feet under the door frame,
but
there wasn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We just laid there and
watched the thing turn...<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are
a
ton of ghosts supposedly seen there, but the aforementioned were MY
personal
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghosts are
supposedly:1. The former owner who was poisoned during a dinner he'd
arranged
to meet with his hotel manager for allegedly going against his wishes
and
building a liquor still illegally in the structure's attic.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The manager, fearing the loss of employment,
poisoned his boss. 2. During the 30's, it was s speak-easy and brothel.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost of a prostitute lives in room # 27
and she will supposedly appear and kiss the hotel guest on the cheek
then
disappear in a smokey haze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
actually the room that we stayed in.3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Back when it was a post office and general store, the
mean-sprited
manager yelled at a young boy whom he had witnessed placing something
in his
pocket; assuming the boy was pilfering something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the boy wasn't, however he was so
afraid that he ran out the door, was never heard of again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Years later when the water tank was being
cleaned and re-painted with lime, the remains of a young child 9aprox.
the same
age as the boy in question) was found.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it's assumed the boy became so afraid that he hid in this tank
and
accidentally drowned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This tank and area
is accessed in the hotel's back roon via a trapped door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It's VERy dark back there, so dark they say
that it's "as dark as the inside of a lack cat."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
walked back there, trying to see because
it's said this ghost still hides back there and is often seen by guests.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't see him, however it was very cold
in comparison to the rest of the hotel even though it's located right
off the
main back bar area toward the opposite side of the restrooms.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Out
on the 2nd story balcony, you can stand there in the middle of January
and it's
quite warm in some areas, however it's very cold in others.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>it was so cold in one spot that I as standing
that I had on my fiance's leathers but still, I couldn't feel parts of
my body,
as though I was frost-bitten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he was
standing a few feet away and was talking to a guy and his wife who were
from
another area, also on vacation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both men
only had on sweaters and were warm and comfortable and the man to whom
my
fiance was speaking removed his outer layer because he claimed to be
warm!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I, on the other hand, nearly froze.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You can hear and see out of the corner
of
your eye, all over the hotel, things "move."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it's
as though people are walking by, all
times of the day and night, going about their business but when I
looked over,
there was no one there but my fiance or no one at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we asked the barkeep and the owner, they
said that "it's claimed," but wouldn't elaborate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think that they didn't want to cause alarm,
however there are ghost stories to read online regarding that hotel as
well as
on their own personal hotel site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I went
to Bloods Point Road and at
about 1:00 am or so with a couple of friends and was chased by a white
car.
(Just confirming that it does indeed happen.) It showed up right when
my friend
decided that she was going to get out of the car and take pictures of
the
graveyard. Also, my three of my friends went before that and were
chased by
three other vehicles: A black big rig, which turned off the road into
the woods
and disappeared, a white pickup, and another white truck (like for
emergency
rescue or something, with the big lights mounted to the top and the
like) None
of the aforementioned vehicles had license plates either. Also, another
thing
you can add to Bloods Point is that you may get a chance to hear a
train
whistle while on the bridge (if you are outside of your car) sounding
like it's
coming from right beneath you, even though the tracks are no longer in
use.
[When my friends went the first time, this happened to them. Two
decided to get
out of the car and look around the bridge and they heard the whistle,
while the
one who remained in the car heard nothing.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

100 years old is going to be torn down.<span style="">&nbsp;

in and
I never liked the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not uncommon to
hear footsteps, things go missing, rapping on the windows to get our
attention,
knocking...it goes on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I and my family
moved out, put a mobile home next door as it was getting pretty run
down and
unsafe to live there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Today I was going
to replace an old curtain upstairs and was looking for some hooks in an
old
cupborad on the back porch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a
vise that I cover over as the roof leaks and I put the sand bucket on
it and
started looking for hooks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
fumbling with the cabinet door and out of the corner of my eye, I'm
only 4 feet
away, the bucket just flung off the vise and I just said out loud,
"Ok,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm done...I'll come back
later on" and left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always
announce myself and tell "them" what I want or need or just say hi.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The air is "heavy" and I got my son
and hung those curtains upstairs and I was talking to them and said
that was a
funny you did to me and I felt the lightest touch on my hip.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I got out quickly and I don't like going in
there at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house has seen my
Grandmother die there, Grandfather, Father, aunts,and others I was told
about
years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's a house that has seen
alot of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wonder if any one would
like to go through this house before it leaves us?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I forgot to mention that John, my husband,
got his name called out so loudly while lying down upstairs one day,
that he
thought it was me needing help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one
was home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Grandfather's name was
John.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was spoken twice, he said.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>So, it's been an experience, to say the
least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll be 60 soon and I've lived in
this house many years.It doesn't seem malevolent, but, every hair on my
arm
stood up today and those goosebumps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
husband said I got back pretty fast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
joke about it, but, I'm curious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Grandmother had passed away
about 2 in a half to 3 months ago. She had died in the nursing home
where she
had resided at due to my grandpa not being able to handle all her
needs. She
has been through a lot and had never died. not saying i wanted her
too... well
she was barely breathing and my grandpa and uncle were there. All it
took was
my grandpa to say i love you and she passed. A few years back she had
told him
if he brought home another woman she would haunt him. Well he had met a
woman
from san antonio and she had stayed a few nights. Stuff in his closet
fell but
he blamed it on rats when i knew he doesn't believe that. she plans on
moving
in soon soo more on that later. But My mom was laying down in bed and
she
couldn't sleep, She went into the living room to watch tv but didn't
turn it
on, she had the remote in her hand deciding whether to or not but it
turned on
itself, freaked her out so went back to bed. When she went to sleep my
grandma
asked her in a dream ,....whos that lady in my house? My mom replied
nobody (
you know how ya cant really control what you do and say in dreams at
times...)
and my grandma would say.. yes there is Donna i see her.. and mom kept
insisting there's no one there and she keeps insisting there is. Well
that's
all the story i got from my mom/grandpa/cousin.. But when that woman
moves in i
know more is going to happen. Will Keep yall updated<o:p></o:p></span></p>
