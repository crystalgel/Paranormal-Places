<P><B>The Brief Encounter</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LlamaMistress74@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My First encounter with a ghost was about 15 years ago.&nbsp; I was
sitting in my basement working at my drafting desk, drawing, when the room
got cold. The hairs on the back of my neck and on my arms stood up.&nbsp;
The spirit looked like a Woman, she had long flowing robes and her hair
was blowing in some unseen wind as she glided. She came out of the Laundry
room, went around the Freezer and went up the stairs into the kitchen,
as if she owned the place.&nbsp; I was more shocked than scared, though
I remember thinking to my self "I'm not going up to the kitchen."&nbsp;
I never saw her again. For a while I was trying to convince my self that
what I saw couldn't possibly be real, that was till I had another encounter
with a different set of ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>Worcester State Hospital and other haunted sites</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: frickchick75@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Tarianna,</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for responding so quickly.My boyfriend was so excited
to hear</B>
<BR><B>from you!This is the story as he told it to me.</B>
<BR><B>The state hospital is heavily watched by police.At night me and
my</B>
<BR><B>cousins snuck in though a hole in the back fence.Armed with a</B>
<BR><B>backpack,flashlights and a small blanket, we entered through the
back</B>
<BR><B>door This was before they boarded up the door.At first we didn't
hear</B>
<BR><B>anything as we were looking around.A half hour went by and the building</B>
<BR><B>sounded as if it was moving.The building was so old we thought nothing</B>
<BR><B>of it.Then we heard voices,at first thinking it was the others in
our</B>
<BR><B>group playing jokes.so we went looking for them,and found them on
the</B>
<BR><B>second floor.They said they wanted to leave cuz they were creeped
out.Us</B>
<BR><B>two wanted to stay and look around more.So the others went out to
wait</B>
<BR><B>at the car.As we went down the hall stairs,a large black shadow
moved</B>
<BR><B>across the bottom of them.We got scared and went back the other
way.As</B>
<BR><B>we passed a room we heard a female scream so loud it chilled your</B>
<BR><B>bones.We started to run down the hall and we saw two red dots that</B>
<BR><B>looked like eyes.We shined the light on them and they disappeared.So
we</B>
<BR><B>were forced to go back down the stairs.As we were running down the</B>
<BR><B>stairs we heard more movement.Furniture being moved,screams,we were
so</B>
<BR><B>scared we just got out of there.</B>
<BR><B>Lennox St. Worcester My uncle rented a two family house that was
owned</B>
<BR><B>years ago by a doctor who killed himself and his children.On the
third</B>
<BR><B>floor attic in the right bedroom you could see him late at night.When
it</B>
<BR><B>was my room,I put a rope on the light switch so at night I could
turn</B>
<BR><B>the light on and off from in my bed.You would hear noises in that
room</B>
<BR><B>only.Things would disappear and reppear when you least expected
it.In</B>
<BR><B>the left bedroom closet you would see two red eyes at night.Doors
would</B>
<BR><B>all of the sudden open and close on thier own.You would hear people</B>
<BR><B>walking up and down the steps when you were the only one there.The
attic</B>
<BR><B>was always the coldest room in the house.Even with the heater on
high</B>
<BR><B>all the time.The dogs didn't like being up in the attic,even with
people</B>
<BR><B>there they were scared. You could people talking and there would
be no</B>
<BR><B>one there.You couldn't understand what they were saying but you
could</B>
<BR><B>hear the talking.In the basement thing were always getting broken.There</B>
<BR><B>was a green mist in the back left corner and and over powering mold-like</B>
<BR><B>oder.The second set of stairs were blocked off for a time because
the</B>
<BR><B>railing kept getting pulled out of the wall and everyone was being</B>
<BR><B>"pushed" down the stairs.Any pictures taken in the house never devolped</B>
<BR><B>right.</B>
<BR><B>I have to go now but I know Ben has other stories.I'll get them
from him</B>
<BR><B>and send them to you or have him send more himself.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Visit With A Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: michelle.grandi@norfolk.gov</B><B></B>

<P><B>This experience began two weeks after my high school graduation.
One of my dearest friends was very brutally raped and murdered in her home.
Her sister found her the next morning dead on the couch in her living room.
Her parents were on their first vacation in nearly 17 years. I was needless
to say devastated by the incident. The service was a closed casket, due
to the disfigurement of her face and body.</B>
<BR><B>I had much difficulty in sleeping after this incident for quite
some time. I would be in my bedroom at night and I could feel her presence
with me, placing her hand on my shoulder as to offer comfort to me. I never
saw her at this point, just could feel her there.</B>
<BR><B>Then one weekend my family and I traveled to my Grandmother's home.
There were several relatives there visiting. Everyone was given bed assignments
and when they got to me, I ended up with the living room couch. As had
been the case many nights before I was restless. It took me some time to
go to sleep. Around 1:45 A.M. I awoke to see my friend standing there.
I thought at first I was dreaming, but it was in color and every detail
so vivid. Not to mention the chill in the air. She seemed to be at a distance
away. Her basic glow was white from head to toe. Her beautiful long brown
hair flowing in the breeze. Her arms were out stretched to me. Her skin
looked like that of a porcelain doll. She walked closer and closer to me.
The details became more distinguishable. She wore a white dress with lace
and ruffles at the top and barefooted. The closer she got to me, things
began to change. I could see her face was extremely swollen, black and
blue, blood all over her face and hands and dress. The dress was torn in
many places. She was crying. She told me I know who did this to me, and
they will pay,don't worry they will pay. Then she said and you my dear
friend don't worry about me, I am fine now. With that she put her hand
on my shoulder to comfort me as she had before. At that point she disappeared
in to thin air, I felt almost breathless, but yet comforted by her visit.</B>
<BR><B>Some years after this visit, I had married and oddly enough her
brother ended up working with my then husband. He knew of the situation
with my friend and how it bothered me. One night he came home and told
me that the subject of her death had come up and they had discussed the
instance. Note though prior to this I had never told him about my visit
nor did I know any details of the murder. I felt compelled to know what
really happened. He began, the two men were working in a home next door,
they had noticed the two young girls at the next house and that they seemed
to be home alone. They decided to come back later. They knocked on the
door explaining that they had been working next door and wanted some water.
Upon their entry they began the raping of her, severely beating her face
beyond the point of recognition. She lost a lot of blood and passed out.
They thought her to be dead and proceed to go the bathroom and were showering
together. She came to and at that moment she pulled herself up from the
floor, grabbed and put on a white dress with lace and ruffles at the top.
She staggered to the bathroom where she exclaimed that 'I know who you
are, and you will pay, believe me you will pay." After that they continued
to beat and rape her tearing the dress, and left her for dead on the couch.
Much blood covered her face, hands and dress. When he completed telling
me the details I felt simply chilled to the bone. Thank you for letting
me share this with all of you.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Our Little Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: legeia2002@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Linda and I live in a house that I have</B>
<BR><B>rented for 3 years now. The house is in a small town</B>
<BR><B>that dates back a few hundred years in southern New</B>
<BR><B>Jersey. It was quiet when we first moved in for about</B>
<BR><B>2 weeks. My husband and I had not gotten our bed set</B>
<BR><B>up so we were still sleeping on the wrap around sofa</B>
<BR><B>in our living room. My first encounter happened when I</B>
<BR><B>awoke at about 6 in the morning to see a little girl</B>
<BR><B>with a startling resemblence to my daughters standing</B>
<BR><B>in the entryway to the living room in an old long</B>
<BR><B>white nightgown holding what appeared to be a teddy</B>
<BR><B>bear just looking at me. She appeared to be about 3 to</B>
<BR><B>4 years old with long dark hair. She only stood there</B>
<BR><B>for a few moments then disapated from the outside in.</B>
<BR><B>I was a little startled but not afraid. I would of</B>
<BR><B>just thought it was my daughter excepting the fact</B>
<BR><B>that she was away at the time.</B>
<BR><B>I told my husband about this encounter and found out</B>
<BR><B>that he had seen her as well. I just figured she was</B>
<BR><B>checking out the strangers that moved into her home</B>
<BR><B>but who she is,is still a mystery.</B>
<BR><B>However it would not be my first encounter with her in</B>
<BR><B>my home. She seems particularly fond of the back</B>
<BR><B>bedroom in which my boys share and we cannot seem to</B>
<BR><B>have any remote controll cars in the house without her</B>
<BR><B>playing with them in odd hours of the night. Everyone</B>
<BR><B>has seen her and she has become more or less an extra</B>
<BR><B>addition to our family. Because she seems to outdate</B>
<BR><B>the age of my house I think she either came with an</B>
<BR><B>antique I may have bought or lived in a house that was</B>
<BR><B>on the property before this one.</B>
<BR><B>I only wish that the other presence in the house was</B>
<BR><B>as docile as she is. My first encounter with what I</B>
<BR><B>choose to call an entity more than a ghost was not a</B>
<BR><B>pleasant one. It happened about a month after we moved</B>
<BR><B>into the house. I went to bed around midnight and was</B>
<BR><B>watching tv when I heard what sounded like my husbands</B>
<BR><B>voice call out my name in what sounded like a panic so</B>
<BR><B>I turned around towards my bedroom door and saw a</B>
<BR><B>shadow move across the wall past the lightswitch and</B>
<BR><B>disappear into the molding. I sat there in bed afraid</B>
<BR><B>to so much as move something told me it was not a good</B>
<BR><B>thing that I just encountered. I finally went out into</B>
<BR><B>the living room and told my husband what had happened</B>
<BR><B>and he insisted it was nothing.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately this would not be my last encounter with</B>
<BR><B>"it". After the first encounter it started to make</B>
<BR><B>itself known to me by bumps and bangs and bad smells</B>
<BR><B>and chills. It seems to be more active late at night</B>
<BR><B>and in the early hours of the morning. If it has</B>
<BR><B>bothered my husband he has kept quiet but it seems</B>
<BR><B>more drawn to me. Lately it has gotten into the habit</B>
<BR><B>of waking me in the middle of the night with loud</B>
<BR><B>bangs and thumps. I am not sure what to do about "it".</B>
<BR><B>Or even what "it" is. I just know we have renewed our</B>
<BR><B>lease and are here for another year.</B>
<BR><B>I will do my best on keeping you updated with any new</B>
<BR><B>happenings that may occur.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Uncles Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: karenpalaroan@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had a lot of ghost experiences of my own..enough to fill pages
on this website! I will write back with my own experiences ( only a few
of the best ones) at a later date. I am going to start with my uncle's
experience today. My grandparents, my dad and my uncle, all lived in Jamaica.
They lived in Kingston, up in the hills. When this experience happened,
there was no electricity up in the hills yet. That meant no streetlights,
no house lights except for lanterns. If people walked at night, they carried
lanterns too. One night my uncle was out late with friends. It was dark
when he drove home. To get to their house, you had to pass over a bridge.
My uncle was at the end of the bridge when he saw a person walking in front
of his car. My uncle wasn't going to hit the person, as he was turning
away from the person. He just kept driving slowly. He didn't see the person
go on either side of the car. Usually if someone was there, they would
pass by the drivers or passengers side. He saw no one. When he looked in
his rearview mirror he saw the lantern of the paeson directly behind his
car, walking away down the bridge he just crossed.The person couln't have
walked that fast, and without my uncle see them pass the car. My uncle
drove home so fast. He said he had never been o scared in his life. For
the longest time, he made sure he got home before it got dark outside.
That's my uncle's story..as I said it's true. My uncle isn't the kind of
man to talk about this stuff, so when he told me it scared me too because
in a way it still sort of gave him the creeps. Thanks for reading this
story!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Experiences Continued</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bripoin@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello again. It has been some time since I last wrote to you and
I have discovered (or rather remembered) a few other experiences from my
family and myself. The last time I emailed you it was under the address
pointsfamily@arkansas.net, just for your own reference.</B>
<BR><B>The first thing that I remember is when I was a teenager, prehaps
about 13 years old, my dad and I were demolishing a house for someone near
where my grandparents live. It was around dusk dark one evening and we
were packing up to go home for the day when I remembered that I had left
a sledge hammer in the room that I had been working on. I went back to
retrieve the hammer, and had my back to the only doorway into the room
when I "felt" someone standing behind me. THinking it was my dad, I turned
around to tell him that he hadn't scared me, but it wasn't my dad. What
I saw was the figure of an older woman, dressed in a Civil War like dress,
but she wasn't solid, I could see through her. I stood there for a minute,
trying to figure out what I was looking at, but she disappeared before
I could ask her who she was. When I told my dad about it, he thought I
was crazy. I never saw here again while we were tearing the house down,
but I could "feel her" whenever I got near that spot in the house.</B>
<BR><B>While talking to my sister the other day, she told me about a time
that she was spending the night with our aunt and uncle when she saw a
black cat walk down the hall then walk right through a wall. Our aunt and
uncle did not have a cat. She also said that she has seen the "person"
walk by the living room window like I did too.</B>
<BR><B>My wife and I recently moved into a bigger house, not because of
the hauntings in our old trailer, but becausewe needed more room. The other
night, I got in late from work, and my children and wife were already asleep.
I was taking a bath when my wife woke up and came into the bathroom. She
said she smelled smoke, like from a cigarette. Neither of us smoke. SO
far, that is the only weird happening in this house, but I am watching
for something to happen soon. I have come to believe that I am sensitive
to these sorts of things, or that I attract them.</B>

<P><B>MY DAILY GHOST</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hartlannon@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I HAVE ALWAYS FELT SOMEWHAT "CONNECTED" TO SPIRITS MY ENTIRE LIFE.
IF I HAD TIME OR MORE INSPIRATION I WOULD LOVE TO HUNT. ANYWAY, MY FIRST
APPARITION OCCURED WHEN I WAS ABOUT 8. MY GRANDMOTHER HAD PASSED AWAY ABOUT
2 YEARS BEFORE IN WHAT IS NOW MY OLDER BROTHERS BEDROOM. HIS ROOM WAS AT
THE BEGINNING OF A LONG NARROW HALL (WE LIVED IN A RACH HOUSE), MY ROOM
AT THE END, WITH THE DOOR FACING THE ENTIRE HALLWAY. I SAW WHAT LOOKED
LIKE A HOVERING BLUE OUTLINE OF A WOMANS FIGURE, AND INSTEAD OF BEING AFRAID,
I KNEW IT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER. AFTER TELING HER I LOVED HER AND I WAS GLAD
SHE WAS THERE, I CLOSED MY EYES TO DISMISS THE VISION AND WHEN I OPENED
THEM SHE WAS GONE.&nbsp;&nbsp; WELL, YEARS LATER I AM NOW TWENTY AND HAVE
A TWO YEAR OLD SON.&nbsp; I'VE MOVED AROUND QUITE A BIT BEFORE BUYING THE
HOUSE NEXT DOOR TO MY PARENTS. I LIVE ON 40ACRES IN A DECENT SIZED MOBILE
HOME. MY PARENTS, AS SAID BEFORE, LIVE IN A SPRAWLING RANCH HOME. WHEN
I BOUGHT THE MOBILE I MET THE PREVIOUS OWNER, WHO HAD BOUGHT IT NEW, BUT
NEVER FULLY MOVED IN.&nbsp; THE REASON HE DID NOT MOVE IN WAS, HE BOUGHT
THE HOME FOR HIMSELF AND HIS ILL WIFE, BUT SHE PASSED BEFORE THE PAPERS
WERE SIGNED. I DO NOT KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE PROPERTY, I DO KNOW THE TOWN
I LIVE IN IS VERY OLD (EARLY1800'S) AND WHEN WE WERE LANDSCAPING WE DID
FIND A CEMENT HEADSTONE IN THE SHAPE OF A CROSS. THE FAMILY DECIDED IT
WAS PROBLY THE HEADSTONE FOR SOMEBODIES HORSE OR PET, BEING NOT LARGE IN
SIZE. I MOVED INTO MY HOME IN FEB OF "02.. EVER SINCE I MOVED IN I'VE BEEN
BOMBARDED WITH PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE WITHOUT HUMAN
TOUCH. THE TV TURNS OFF AND ON, ASLO THE VCR WILL SPIT MOVIES RIGHT AT
YOU, EVEN IF IT IS OFF OR IN THE MIDDLE OF USE. FOR SOME REASON, ACTIVITY
SEEMS TO "FLARE" WHEN I AM IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH A MALE WHO IS IN HOUSE
OFTEN. THE FIRST SIGHTING I HAD WAS WHEN MY SON WAS APPROX 2MONTHS OLD.
I WAS PLAYING WITH HIM, FACING HIM WHILE HE WAS IN HIS BABY SWING. WE WERE
IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF MY LIVING ROOM, AND I WAS MAKING THE BABY LAUGH.
ALL OF A SUDDEN HIS FACE BECAME BLANK. BEING OF CONCERN I LOOKED HIM IN
THE EYE AND SPOKE TO HIM SOOTHINGLY. AS SOON AS MY EYES FOCUSED ON HIS,
I SAW THE REFLECTION OF A DARK FIGURE DART ACCROSS THE ROOM BEHIND ME,
AND THE BABY'S EYES FOLLOWED THE FIGURE. I IMMEDIATLY TURNED AROUND TO
SEE WHO WAS IN MY HOME, ONLY TO FIND NOBODY. NOT TO FRIGHTEN THE BABY,
WE WENT ABOUT PLAYING AS IF EVERYTHING THAT HAD JUST OCCURED WAS FICTION.
A MONTH LATER I DECIDED IT WAS TIME FOR MY SON TO SLEEP IN A CRIP IN HIS
OWN ROOM INSTEAD OF THE CRADLE IN MY BEDROOM. I TOOK APART THE CRADLE SO
I WOULDN'T BE TEMPTED TO BRING BACK IN MY ROOM. AFTER I LAYED THE BABY
IN HIS CRIB, (WHICH IS FURNITURE THAT I USED AS A BABY AS WELL AS MY OLDER
BROTHER AND SISTERS), I STOOD IN THE DOORWAY SAYING MY THANKS TO GOD AND
WATCHING MY LITTLE ONE SLEEP. FROMOVER MY SHOULD, FIRST SLOWLY,&nbsp; AN
ORB CIRCLED THE ROOM, PICKING UP SPEED AS IT WENT ALONG THE WALLS. THEN
IT CIRCLED MY SONS CRIB SO FAST IT MADE HIS MOBILE MOVE AND PLAY MUSIC.
I WAS NOT AFRAID, FOR SOME REASON I HAD THIS OVERWHELMING SENSE OF CALMNESS.
IN A DAZE I CLOSED HIS DOOR, AND WALKED CALMLY TO MY ROOM, WHERE FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE MY SONS BIRTH, I WAS ABLE TO SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT,
AND SO DID HE.&nbsp; STRANGE OCCURANCES ARE CONTINUAL. FOR EXAMPLE, EVERY
NIGHT AT 10PM SHARP, THERE IS A LOUD BANG IN MY GUEST BATHROOM. REGUARDLESS
OF IF YOUR IN THE ROOM OR NOT, IT IS VERY AUDIBLE. ALSO, VERY INTERESTING,
EVERY PICTURE OF ME ALONE IN THE HOUSE HAS AN ORB NEARBY OR IN MOTION.
HOWEVER, IF ANYONE IS IN THE PICTURE WITH ME, IT DOES NOT EXIST. I HAVE
USED MANY DIFFERENT CAMERAS, EVEN ROTATED FROM TAKING PICTURES ALONE TO
WITH SOMEONE ELSE, JUST TO TEST IF IT WAS CAMERA ERROR. EVERY PICTURE THAT
CAME BACK WAS AS SUSPECTED.... ORBS ONLY WITH ME. NOW, MY CURRE BEAU, SAYS
THAT... I FALL ASLEEP BEFORE HIM AMD AFTER I AM ASLEEP HE ALWASY HEARS
A MALES VOICE TALKING...... AND I RESPOND TO IT!!! HE IS CONSTANTLY PLAGUED
WITH BEING UNABLE TO MOVE IN MY BED AS WELL. ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HEARS THE
VOICE. I HAVE OFTEN HEARD VOICES, BUT IM SO USED TO IT, I DON'T EVEN PAY
ATTENTION WHEN IT IS HAPENING. IT USUALLY SOUND LIKE A RADIO IN THE DISTANCE,
WHEN NOTHING IS ON. OR IT SOUNDS LIKE A MAN ON A CELL PHONE.. I CAN HEAR
HIM TALKING BUT I CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHAT HE IS SAYING, OR IT JUST SIMPLY
IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH. THE MOST RECENT FREAKY THING THAT HAPPENED.... I SAW
A FIGURE ENTER MY LAUNDRY ROOM AND HEARD THINGS BEING MOVED. I THOUGHT
IT WAS MY BEST FRIEND DOING LAUNDRY, BUT I COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHY SHE
DIDN'T TURN THE LIGHT ON. AFTER ASKING HER NUMEROUS TIMES WHY SHE DON'T
USE THE LIGHT AND GETTING NO RESPONSE... I WAS PANICK STRUCKEN. I DECIDED
TO CHECK IT OUT. IN A QUICK STRIDE TO MAKE IT TO MY BEST FIREND, AS I PASSED
THE LAUNDRY ROOM I NOTICED IT WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY AND THE CABINETS WERE
OPEN. THEN I RAN TO MY BEST FRIEND AND TOLD HER WHAT HAD AHPPENED. SHE
WALKED ME BACK TO THE LAUNDRY ROON WHERE, NOW THE LIGHT WAS ON, AND THE
CABINETS WERE CLOSED. YIPEEEE..... ONCE I GOT FED UP WITH WHOMEVER THIS
GHOST IS AND STARTED TO TALK TO IT. I WAS CALM AND ASKED IT IT WOULD PLEASE
STOP SCARING ME. I DONT MIND IF IT STAYS, BUT IM TOO POOR TO AFFORD ANOTHER
HOUSE AND WE COULD JUST GET ALONG. EVER SINCE I DID THAT, THE STRANGE THINGS
HAVE NOT CEASED, BUT THEY ARE NO LONGER AS EVIDENT, NOR DO THEY SCARE ME
ANYMORE. BUT, I HAVE NOT ONE FRIEND WHO WILL SPEND THE NIGHT IN MY HOUSE!!!
I AM SOO CURIOUS TO FIND OUT WHY THIS SPIRIT IS IN MY LIFE... OR IF IT
NEEDS HELP.. I ALSO BELEIVE THE SPIRIT HELPS ME WITH MY SON.. AND I AM
THANKFUL FOR ITS PRESENCE IN WATCHING OVER HIM.</B>

<BR><B>Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rsharris@suffolk.lib.ny.us</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi Dave and Tina, I'm not really sure how to send a few stories in
so I'll try sending them in this way. Here it goes (these are just minor
experiences) I've always believed in the supernatural. When I was about
threes years old my mom told me that she&nbsp; woke up to me crying and
saying that I saw a little black "thing" run around at the edge of my bed.
My dad was downstairs at the time and thought that I just saw our dog walk
past my bed but he was a pretty light colored dog so I'm not sure if that
was really him or not. Another experience happened after my grandma had
passed away. Maybe a few weeks before she passed away my family and I had
gone to visit her. I don't know if you have ever seen those dolls that
you put fake food in there mouths and they eat it. Well anyway I had brought
that over and just as we were about to leave i couldn't find the spoon.
We looked all over the place for it and could not find it. Well a day after
she died my mom was cleaning and found it under the cushion of the couch.
Three more experiences so bare with me. About maybe three years ago( this
was in another house) I was taking a shower and if you see the way the
bathroom is setup its like this threes a door that leads out into the hallway
and when you come in that door right in front of you is a toilet and a
sink then when you make a left there is a tub then threes another toilet
and a sink. Well while I was taking a shower the way i was facing was into
the bathroom not facing the hallway( I know your probably a little confused
right now its just hard to explain) all of a sudden I see "something" look
into the tub I got a little jumpy but then I thought it was my mom just
by the height. So I said "mom?" no one responded i got a little scared
( then I thought it was my sister just trying to scare me). So I said something
like "Danielle" stop trying to scare me then "it" backed up. When I got
out i asked both my sister and my mom if one of them had been upstairs
in the bathroom . They both said that they hadn't been up there since I
had gotten into the tub. I thought they were joking but by the look on
their faces I knew they weren't. The next experience happened to my sister.
On night (a few months before our thirteen year old dog passed away) she
got up and just happened to look out the window and in the trees she a
white glowing "thing" that she described to look like a girl sitting on
the tree branches. The last one happened to my mom. About a year or so
after our dog passed away my mom stayed up after we left for school. She
was looking out side just as the sun was coming over the horizon and saw
what looked like our dog only looking like a puppy as he of course once
did running . She thought she saw another dog but when she looked around
she didn't see anything else. None of these sprits were evil but they did
creep my sister and I out. Thanks for your time. If you have any questions
please feel free to contact me @ RSHARRIS@SUFFOLK.LIB.NY.US BYE FOR NOW.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Bright Pop</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MooreC@ARPS.ORG</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was lying in my bed one night, towards the end of summer, and all
was quiet. My bed is lying parelell to my windows which overlooks trees
and fields going for about 6 miles. I'm in bed and all of a sudden i hear
an energy pop coming from a space about two feet from my ceiling and seven
feet from my floor. Not even half a second after the noise a bright flash
of white white blue light comes from the space and then stops. This happened
three more times that night and every night for the following week. Then
it stopped.</B>
<BR><B>there is nothing that i could tell that would have caused this.
THe only electrical thing on was my clock, which was at my bedside. My

<P><B>Ghosts in Real Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: spectre@blomand.ne</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was 6 years old the first time I can remember I was special. My
mom and dad ,brother and I lived in a old army hideout which had been turned
in to a house it was over 100 years old . In my and my brothers room there
was a tunnle that lead down to the river, plus a door that lead in to a
big open room which no one ever whent in there not even the people who
we rented the house from. The room was locked at all the times because
it frecked ever body out . One night as I was sleeping in my bed the door
came open and then shut. It woke me up when it opend ,I didnt see anyone
so I thought my mom or dad went back there for something and since I had
never been back there I took the opportunity to get a glimps of what was
in there. I walked in and it was kinda dark but I remember being able to
see everthing I walked over where I heard talking but seen no one I came
upon a tabel and there was five men sitting around the table playing cards
they never talked to me but they were there. I could here no talking but
they were clearly talking . They started to scare me so I started walking
back to the door so I could ask dad who his friends where and why they
were in the back room. As I started walking I looked back one more time
and every one of them were looking at me but they were all mangled, burnt
and bloody. It scared the hell out of me I never went back to that room
or my room at all. But that wasent the last I ever saw of them or others
,I have had many other experiences.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been going out with my girlfriend for a while and i know shes
a little</B>
<BR><B>crazy but one day she tell me casually that her house was haunted.
i figured</B>
<BR><B>she was joking. later she told me that this teen boy killed himself
in the</B>
<BR><B>house and the mother couldn't bear living in that house any longer.
which is all</B>
<BR><B>she knew. when she had got the house there was blood att over the
bathroom</B>
<BR><B>doorway(which they cleaned off).</B>
<BR><B>i'd come over everyother weekend to stay with her&nbsp; but i'd
always feel weird</B>
<BR><B>in her room like i couldn't breath, like the air was stale or somthing.
one</B>
<BR><B>night we were in her room and i noticed a little string on her ceiling
(from</B>
<BR><B>where is where she had barbie hangings) was going absolutly nuts!
the liittle</B>
<BR><B>metal hook it was hung by was moving too. at the moment i didn't
pay it any mind.</B>
<BR><B>i sat on her bad while she sat on her computer chair and turn turned
to me</B>
<BR><B>and freaked saying "oh god" and the sort i said what a turned around
only to see</B>
<BR><B>my vest fall onto her bed.&nbsp; my heart was racing at this moment
so i stood and</B>
<BR><B>she said don't pay it any attention. but i was freaking out. i eventually</B>
<BR><B>calmed down and nothing else happened well until later.</B>
<BR><B>i was falling asleep on her bed and it was almost time for me to
go so i got</B>
<BR><B>up to put my sweater on and my sneaker and i blinked my eyes and
the entire</B>
<BR><B>room looked different. the walls were white when they were pink
as of prior. her</B>
<BR><B>funiture wasnt there but i couln't mak out what was there and it
whuold go</B>
<BR><B>away for a few minutes. my girlfriend freaked out too because she
saw my eyes go</B>
<BR><B>glassy for a second and i just sat in awe . i really though i got
up and</B>
<BR><B>looked around for until it stoped. when i told her what i had seen
she told he</B>
<BR><B>about this picture of herself that she used to have in her room.
it was a great</B>
<BR><B>but creepy picture her brother painted. she said she took it from
her room</B>
<BR><B>because one night she wwoke up and from he laying space she could
she her picture</B>
<BR><B>looking back at her (which is how it normally was) but then it started
to</B>
<BR><B>bleed. it started with her forehead and then down her ears and off
the picture and</B>
<BR><B>onto the wall. which is where she ren&nbsp; down the tree steps
to get to her</B>
<BR><B>mother and tell her. when her mother came into her room the picture
was horribly</B>
<BR><B>uneven but there was no blood. her mother took it into her room.</B>
<BR><B>if you have any ideas when i should do or wha she should. email
me.</B>

<BR><B>My Dog</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Starplya007@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have had several dogs in my life i had a female got it mated and
she had a</B>
<BR><B>litter of 10(two casualties) the mother(named:methya) lived quite
the long</B>
<BR><B>time.&nbsp; i kept one puppy(named:shyler). methya was an awefully
fat dog, which led</B>
<BR><B>to her death having a stroke and living but having it effect her&nbsp;
and we had</B>
<BR><B>to put her down. unfortunatly she had the stroke in the secondfloor
of the</B>
<BR><B>home, making it inpossible for her to go down the stairs and into
the car to the</B>
<BR><B>vet. we had to get a house call and put her down in the kitchen.(here
is the</B>
<BR><B>creepy part) one night i was staying up till like3am i had no school
the</B>
<BR><B>following mourning. i heard ceiling&nbsp; creek like someone was
upstairs. i thought at</B>
<BR><B>the time that it was shyler and that i forgot to put up the kiddy
gate to keep</B>
<BR><B>the dog out since the upstairs had no doos cutting it off. so i
whenupstair to</B>
<BR><B>make sure she didn't pee on the rug again.&nbsp; when i gt to the
top of the stairs</B>
<BR><B>i relized the gate was up but i still heard a very heavy breathing.
when i</B>
<BR><B>heard it the hairs on my neck stood up. i relized it sounded like
methya's heavy</B>
<BR><B>brething (since she was incredably fat). it was coming from the
kitchen. when</B>
<BR><B>i turned on the lights i saw the dog for a split second, as it it
was a</B>
<BR><B>shadow too. being the chicken i am i ran downstairs and still all
through the night</B>
<BR><B>i heard more shifts from upstairs. (btw shyler getted me when i
came running</B>
<BR><B>from downstairs which scared me more at the moment) it doesn't really
scary me</B>
<BR><B>anymore(i still hear it) i just figure methya likes it too much
here to leave</B>

<P><B>My Friend or...Foe???</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ivy42@sbcglobal.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I am turning 16 in april of 2004.&nbsp; I live in a small apartment
in California.&nbsp; This was about two years ago.&nbsp; It was some time
around night, probably around 6 or 7:00.&nbsp; no one was home (my mom
comes home around 7 or 7:30) and i was in the livingroom watching Television
on the couch.&nbsp; I thought I heard wistleing from my roon down the hall.&nbsp;
I was alos alone because my sister, who now lives with us, was in Boot
camp for the Marines.&nbsp; I imediately put the volume on mute.&nbsp;
I heard it agian, it was whistling.&nbsp; all windows were closed and locked.&nbsp;
I had suddenly felt horrible chills allover my body, strong chills.&nbsp;
I swore that I felt someone playing with my hair( my hair reaches the middle
of my back).&nbsp; I can sometimes sence when someone is watching me, coming,
behind or, around me.&nbsp; I senced someone was behind me, someone tall,
and I hated the feeling at the momment.&nbsp; I was too scared to turn
around, but just when I decided to turn Iwas suddenly being dragged down
buy my hair.&nbsp; I freaked out and ran to my room.&nbsp; I put my ear
to the door and I not only heard but felt heavy foot steps comming down
the hall, but it sounded like two people.&nbsp; They stopped and I heard
a loud bang.&nbsp; I quikly opened the door and ran out.&nbsp; No one was
there of course. I have to admit I was a little disapointed to not find
any one.&nbsp; I slowly walked into the hall and a couple of ideas were
running thouhg my head as well as some freakishly calming chills all over
my body again.&nbsp; I began to feel light stroking on my hair agian.&nbsp;
I started to hear a young mans voice behind me. He spoke another language,
but none that I recognized.&amp;n p; None of this world perhaps.&nbsp;
It all went away in a matter of seconds.&nbsp; I heard my Mom coming up
the stairs to our small apartment. I raced to open the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I did not tell her about it because she would not have believed me.&nbsp;
I swear I am not insane.&nbsp; That night I went to bed and fell into a
dream.&nbsp; It was dark and all I heard was The young mans voice.&nbsp;
I understood what he had said in my dream but I do not remember what he
said.&nbsp; It's like as if I understood the strange language, but I don't
Know now.&nbsp; I have not told any one this until now.&nbsp; I'll keep
you posted on any thing else.&nbsp; My mother sometimes tells me of times
that she lived with ghosts.&nbsp; I find That we have come from a line
of ghost encounters.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Noises in the Night and a Movie Loving Ghost!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: filmfanfive@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had many paranormal experiences in my lifetime,</B>
<BR><B>here are the ones that stand out the most!&nbsp; My first</B>
<BR><B>experience with the supernatural might have an</B>
<BR><B>explanation but I have yet to find one.&nbsp; When I was 7</B>
<BR><B>and living in Cameron Park CA, my parents left me home</B>
<BR><B>alone for the first time.&nbsp; Being a kid, I was ecstatic</B>
<BR><B>and as soon as the door closed behind them, I was</B>
<BR><B>jumping on beds and eating junk food from the pantry.</B>
<BR><B>Out of nowhere, I got really scared and hid in the</B>
<BR><B>table fort my friend and I had made the night before.</B>
<BR><B>I was curled up under the table, frightened and</B>
<BR><B>wishing my parents would return when I started hearing</B>
<BR><B>a familiar tune.&nbsp; My 2nd grade teacher at the time,</B>
<BR><B>was huge with classical music and threw it into the</B>
<BR><B>curriculum whenever she could and my dad was a fan</B>
<BR><B>too.&nbsp; So when the music started, I recognized it as</B>
<BR><B>the overture from 'Swan Lake'.&nbsp; There were no windows</B>
<BR><B>or doors open and no radios on in the house so I</B>
<BR><B>couldn't tell where it was coming from.&nbsp; It sounded</B>
<BR><B>far away but at the same time, very audible and kept</B>
<BR><B>repeating.&nbsp; I instantly felt comforted and soon fell</B>
<BR><B>asleep until my parents came home.</B>
<BR><B>After 7th grade, my family moved to Fair Oaks, CA and</B>
<BR><B>I could tell that the house had a funny feel to it.</B>
<BR><B>My suspicions were confirmed when I would be home</B>
<BR><B>alone and got incredibly uncomfortable.&nbsp; My parents</B>
<BR><B>room and the laundry room always seemed foreboding</B>
<BR><B>when the house was all quiet and if it was dark, I</B>
<BR><B>would only feel semi-normal if most of the house</B>
<BR><B>lights were on.&nbsp; Over the years, it got so bad that</B>
<BR><B>when I knew I was gonna be home alone, I would arrange</B>
<BR><B>to hang out with friends during that time.&nbsp; I've only</B>
<BR><B>had one cluster of hauntings at my parents house and</B>
<BR><B>it happened when I was 17.&nbsp; One morning before school,</B>
<BR><B>I woke up to the sound of the phone ringing.&nbsp; This was</B>
<BR><B>odd, considering it was 4am and when I got to the</B>
<BR><B>phone, there was just silence on the other end.</B>
<BR><B>Thinking it a prank, I went back to bed but the phone</B>
<BR><B>rang again and I ignored it.&nbsp; I drifted off to sleep</B>
<BR><B>again but woke up to a weird sound.&nbsp; It sounded like</B>
<BR><B>someone was messing with a plastic bag outside.&nbsp; As I</B>
<BR><B>lay there in bed, the sound got closer and was right</B>
<BR><B>outside my bedroom window.&nbsp; I was too scared to move</B>
<BR><B>and almost screamed when my alarm clock went off.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>noise stopped and I jumped out of bed and woke my</B>
<BR><B>brother up, asking if he heard anything.&nbsp; He hadn't</B>
<BR><B>and when I told him my story, he thought I was nuts,</B>
<BR><B>but was concerned because I was genuinely freaked out.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;That night I stayed at my boyfriend's house and the</B>
<BR><B>following might I was back in my bedroom.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>mysterious noise happened again, but was more</B>
<BR><B>terrifying.&nbsp; To be cautious, I kept a flashlight by my</B>
<BR><B>bed and sure enough, I had cause to use it.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>awakened at 3am this time with the crinkling sound</B>
<BR><B>repeating its pattern.&nbsp; It seemed to move faster</B>
<BR><B>though and before I knew what was really happening,</B>
<BR><B>the sound jumped from outside to my parents room (next</B>
<BR><B>to mind) and then it was in the hall outside my door</B>
<BR><B>and then was moving around in my room!&nbsp; My door was</B>
<BR><B>closed, as was the window and my room was clean, so</B>
<BR><B>there was no explanation for it.&nbsp; I grabbed the</B>
<BR><B>flashlight and shone it around the room.&nbsp; The noise</B>
<BR><B>stopped when the flashlight came on but I wasn't about</B>
<BR><B>to stick around and wait for it to come back.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>jumped out of bed and headed for my door.&nbsp; As soon as</B>
<BR><B>my feet touched the ground, the flashlight started</B>
<BR><B>going berserk, like someone was flipping the switch on</B>
<BR><B>it really rapidly (it wasn't a malfunction, new</B>
<BR><B>flashlight, new batteries).&nbsp; I broke into run and</B>
<BR><B>burst into the hallway.&nbsp; My dad was up, watching an</B>
<BR><B>old Fred Astaire movie and looked surprised as I came</B>
<BR><B>tearing down the hallway like a bat outta hell.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>told him what happened but of course, he didn't</B>
<BR><B>believe me, but knew that something had spooked me as</B>
<BR><B>he commented that I ran out of my room like the devil</B>
<BR><B>was at my heels.&nbsp; I was firm with my story and</B>
<BR><B>insisted on sleeping in the living room by the TV and</B>
<BR><B>told my dad not to move from the couch until daybreak.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;From then on, I slept with my door open and didn't</B>
<BR><B>have any problems.</B>
<BR><B>A few months later, I got a job at a video store that</B>
<BR><B>turned out to be haunted.&nbsp; My co-workers have heard</B>
<BR><B>their names called when the store was empty, had their</B>
<BR><B>shoulders tapped by unseen hands, and had movies</B>
<BR><B>knocked off the shelves with no one nearby.&nbsp; After</B>
<BR><B>hours, I would always people out of the corner of my</B>
<BR><B>eye as I was straightening the wall and get uneasy</B>
<BR><B>feelings in different parts of the store.&nbsp; Once when I</B>
<BR><B>was in the bathroom there, I was washing my hands and</B>
<BR><B>looked in the mirror and saw a dark shadow cross</B>
<BR><B>behind me.&nbsp; I could tell it had substance becauwe it</B>
<BR><B>was in between me and back wall.&nbsp; A half an hour later</B>
<BR><B>I went on my lunch break and heard a knock on the</B>
<BR><B>office door and when I opened it there was no one</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; Other little things like that kept happening</B>
<BR><B>mainly to me.&nbsp; Almost like the ghost liked to mess</B>
<BR><B>with me the most.&nbsp; A few months after the bathroom</B>
<BR><B>experience, I quit my job at the video store but went</B>
<BR><B>back a few months later for seasonal employment.&nbsp; On</B>
<BR><B>Christmas Eve 2003, I was going about my closing</B>
<BR><B>duties and was going to put the vacuum away.&nbsp; I got a</B>
<BR><B>few feet away from the supply closet and heard the</B>
<BR><B>door knob start to rattle (it has a very distinct</B>
<BR><B>sound) but didn't move.&nbsp; It lasted for almost a minute</B>
<BR><B>but by this time I was used to resident ghost.&nbsp; I felt</B>
<BR><B>like it was his way of welcoming me back to work.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>know the movie-loving ghost is friendly, but</B>
<BR><B>mischievous.&nbsp; It is fun to scare the new employees</B>
<BR><B>with the stories of the ghostly experiences of the</B>
<BR><B>store!&nbsp; Thanks for reading!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghostly Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lee2cool@netzero.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hey, ever since 1999, my family and I have experienced so many strange
things. It all started when my grandmother was murdered. We were still
living in their (grandparents) house of about 8 years. We started to feel
a presence all the time, being watched. While we would all be sitting around/talking
in the living room, the {tv} remote would out of nowhere fly off the table.
When my cousin was in the L.r., she saw imprints of someone sitting next
to her in the couch. The tv or stereo would turn off by itself. My 19 year
old brother never believed us until when he was sitting in the living room
(we have this touch lamp, that every time a human hand touches it, it gets
brighter 3x's, then turns off) and it was on, then it turned off. So he
turned it back on, then it turned back off. There's three windows in the
living room, my cousin was sittin on the couch facing the tv (we were watching
it) when all of a sudden she said that she kept seeing white faces, some
red. She said that they looked evil. At that time I didn believe it because
by time I looked out the window I couldn't see them. But now later on I
did cause her face was pale for like an hour or two. One night (my cuz
&amp; I always stay up really late) she fell asleep, so I thought Id clean
up &amp; then go to sleep too. While I was cleaning, I went to take something
to the kitchen, when I heard pots and pans moving around as if someone
were tryin' to look for something, it was pretty loud. At first I thought
it was my uncle who lived in the basement, but when I went to look, no
one was there &amp; he was already dead-asleep. The cabinets were open,
so u bet I dropped everything and ran to my cousin asleep(who is hard to
wake up) &amp; I was crying. Another time was when My cousin &amp; I were
having a party for her b-day, in my grandpa's room (he just passed like
a few months before, don't know what we were thinkin') while we were staying
up late as usual, everyone else were asleep. We were&nbsp; watching tv
when we started noticing white lines (like when you press on ur skin) all
over our legs, like someone was drawing on them, then we saw her initials
in her legs. They were facing the other way, to where she couldn't of done
it herself, like there was someone in front of her. Then we saw other initials
of other people we know also. We could see the letters appearing as if
it was being written at that very moment. Anyways later that morning when
everyone was up getting ready hether (cuz) was headed towards the bathroom
when I say at the end of the very short hall, someone walk towards the
front door, like this black figure (looked like my brother who was sleeping
on the couch, u could see the couch from where i was). So I thought nothing
of it til' I saw my brother still dead-asleep on the couch, thats when
hether walked out of the bathroom and the black figure started walking
back towards where it came from, the kitchen. At the time while it was
walking by it got really cold. U have to know more about this house to
understand half the stuff that happened. There's so many more stuff that
happened, even after we moved out of that house. Ever since then I have
been afraid of the dark,</B><B></B>

<P><B>Lifelong Sightings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tammie@teletemppersonnel.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Like Dave Juliano, I too have felt like I have been visited by strange</B>
<BR><B>things.&nbsp; I moved around allot, so after a while I got used
to living in a</B>
<BR><B>new house.&nbsp; Some of these homes scared me to death.&nbsp; When
I was 12 My sister</B>
<BR><B>and I were unpacking our clothes in the middle of our bedroom.&nbsp;
All we had</B>
<BR><B>in our bedroom were a pile of clothes, and a radio.&nbsp; in the
middle of the</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; As we began rummaging through our clothes, the radio
turned on, it</B>
<BR><B>startled me,it played that one some, get your motors running, head
out on</B>
<BR><B>the highway! Anyways, I turned it off and looked at my sister.&nbsp;
She looked</B>
<BR><B>scared, I said "What?" she says "It's unplugged, and we don't have</B>
<BR><B>batteries" Now, to tell you the truth, It sounds like I didn't look
around</B>
<BR><B>enough to see if it really was plugged, but I did.&nbsp; Not only
did I pick it</B>
<BR><B>up, but when I did, the cord fell aimlessly to the ground.&nbsp;
The plug was</B>
<BR><B>sort of like a UB cable, it needed to be plugged in the radio, and
the wall</B>
<BR><B>socket in order for it to work. It wasn't plugged in to either.&nbsp;
I was 15 or</B>
<BR><B>16, and I had a friend spend the night (in one of our other moves.
She and I</B>
<BR><B>hung out for a while, and fell asleep in my bed.&nbsp; Something
woke us up, at</B>
<BR><B>the same exact moment.&nbsp; It wasn't a noise, I don't know what
it was, but we</B>
<BR><B>both looked at my doorway ( I didn't have a door just a lace curtain)
and</B>
<BR><B>there was something standing there.&nbsp; It was tall, dark, black,
with a beard.</B>
<BR><B>I could make out the figure, but it took up my doorway.&nbsp; I
stared, she</B>
<BR><B>stared, then we blinked and it was gone.&nbsp; I kept telling myself
that I had</B>
<BR><B>just woken up and I was seeing things, but after reading Dave Juliano's</B>
<BR><B>sighting, I know now that I wasn't.&nbsp; I too used to see "imps"
not the way</B>
<BR><B>you did, a lot less frequently.&nbsp; One time I saw a little girl
sitting on one</B>
<BR><B>of our lamps I walked right passed her, then noticed I saw her and
turned</B>
<BR><B>around and she was gone.&nbsp; This all happened in the same house.&nbsp;
There was a</B>
<BR><B>long hallway, with 3 bedroom doors one closet door, and one bathroom
door.</B>
<BR><B>Every time I walked down that hallway I felt like someone breathing
down my</B>
<BR><B>neck behind me, I got Horrifying chills, I was frightened to go
to the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom.&nbsp; At night I would get up to get some water, and I
would look down</B>
<BR><B>the hall briefly maybe for a split second, and I would see a woman,
a figure</B>
<BR><B>of a woman, all dark black, I couldn't make out her figure, long
black hair,</B>
<BR><B>go in from one bedroom door to another. Chills ran up my spine.
this</B>
<BR><B>happened frequently.&nbsp; Not too much has happened since then,
besides when I</B>
<BR><B>went to Colorado.&nbsp; I was pregnant, and sleeping in this huge
house that was</B>
<BR><B>sitting on 365 acres of land.&nbsp; My husband and I were the only
one's at his</B>
<BR><B>parents house, they left out of town.&nbsp; I hear a knocking at
2am, at our</B>
<BR><B>front door. I ignore it, it got louder, I woke up my husband, he
took our</B>
<BR><B>dog (who had been sleeping in her kennel) to the front door. He
opened the</B>
<BR><B>door and nothing.&nbsp; Nothing was there, and the weird thing was
the knocking</B>
<BR><B>stopped when he opened the door.&nbsp; He let our dog out to check
it out, and</B>
<BR><B>she came back all happy jolly.&nbsp; So we laid back down and closed
our eyes.</B>
<BR><B>The damn knocking again. Except it was like someone was banging
on the side</B>
<BR><B>of our house hard, like they really wanted to get in.&nbsp; If it
was a robber he</B>
<BR><B>could have easily broken one of our many windows.&nbsp; It just
kept banging and</B>
<BR><B>banging, it sounded like it was moving to different parts of our
house and</B>
<BR><B>banging.&nbsp; It was freaky!&nbsp; I started to cry, I got chills
down my neck, my</B>
<BR><B>husband freaked out and started yelling "Who Is It?" No answer.
Finally he</B>
<BR><B>would open the door with my dog, and nothing, the banging would

<BR><B>dog was very non-chalant about everything.&nbsp; (and believe me
if it was anyone</B>
<BR><B>else or anything else in our house she would have barked. My husband
did a</B>

we went back</B>

We</B>
<BR><B>called his parents the next day and told them what happened, and
they made</B>
<BR><B>fun of us. they played around and said "It was probably your friend
who got</B>
<BR><B>drunk and drove home in the snow.&nbsp; He wrecked his car in front
of the house.</B>
<BR><B>He died, your father had to run outside and call the ambulance.&nbsp;
He saw him</B>
<BR><B>and knew automatically that he was dead"&nbsp; WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Knowing One has Passed Away</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: remco.burgers@kuehne-nagel.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Before I begin with my story first let me introduce myself to you.</B>
<BR><B>My name is Buzz (this is my nickname, my real name isn't really</B>
<BR><B>that important), I'm a 22 yr old half american guy who lives in
the</B>
<BR><B>Netherlands.</B>
<BR><B>I've always been interested in hauntings, ghosts and other things
of</B>
<BR><B>the unexplainable.</B>
<BR><B>I've lived in the Netherlands for all my life, since I was born
there.</B>
<BR><B>My mom is an american from origin and my dad is dutch. My randmother,</B>
<BR><B>my mom's mother, is also dutch from origin, and here is where the</B>
<BR><B>story begins...</B>
<BR><B>My grandfather was an american soldier in the US Army during the</B>
<BR><B>2nd World War. I don't know really much about him, only that his</B>
<BR><B>name was Donald Aiken and that his / our family owned one of the</B>
<BR><B>biggest turkey farms the state of Pennsylvania holds and that,</B>
<BR><B>ofcourse, he helped setting the dutch people free from the Germans
in</B>
<BR><B>1945 (and I'm very proud that he was part of that!).</B>
<BR><B>The only thing I had of my grandfather was a picture of him in his
US</B>
<BR><B>army uniform. This picture hung on the wall in my room when I was</B>
<BR><B>little.</B>
<BR><B>It happened in 1993, I'm from 1981 myself, so I was about twelve</B>
<BR><B>years old. Me and my brother slept together in one room in what</B>
<BR><B>I think you guyss call bunkbeds(?) My brother slept on top and I</B>
<BR><B>had the bottom bed.</B>
<BR><B>One night I woke up 'cuz I heard a sound. It sounded like something</B>
<BR><B>had fallen. It was a rather loud noise, and the funny thing was</B>
<BR><B>we had very thick carpet on the floor and normally if something</B>
<BR><B>would fall, from a shelf or something like that, you wouldn't hear</B>
<BR><B>a thing.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, as I had to go to the bathroom (which was downstairs, as</B>
<BR><B>dutch houses are, compared to american houses, very small) I went</B>
<BR><B>out of my bed. This was about 2.30am. When I returned to my room</B>
<BR><B>I'd remembered something fell, so I turned on the light and went</B>
<BR><B>searching around the room. I looked and saw that the picture of
my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather was on the floor. As I was eager to get back to bed,</B>
<BR><B>I, without hesitating, picked up the picture, hung it back on the</B>
<BR><B>wall and went back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>It wasn't untill that morning that we received a call from my</B>
<BR><B>grandmother that my grandfather had died that night at around 2.30am.</B>
<BR><B>I suddenly recalled the incedent with the picture and flew back</B>
<BR><B>upstairs to my room. I looked at the picture again, took it off
the</B>
<BR><B>wall and started to investigate. The little thing at the back (in</B>
<BR><B>dutch it's called 'haakje') wasn't broken or smashed or anything.</B>
<BR><B>It was still very tightly attached to the back of the picture frame</B>
<BR><B>and the nail in the wall which held it also was still very tightly</B>
<BR><B>pinned-in.</B>
<BR><B>That really freaked me out, 'cuz I knew that, maybe my grandfather,</B>
<BR><B>or someone or something else, had let me know that he died at that</B>
<BR><B>very same moment the picture fell off. On the other hand I felt
kind</B>
<BR><B>of honored that a man, though he was a relative, who I never had
met</B>
<BR><B>(he never saw me either, as my grandparents got divorced somewhere</B>
<BR><B>in the late 1970's and my grandmother moved back to the netherlands</B>
<BR><B>together with my mom and one of my uncle's) had let me know first</B>
<BR><B>that he had past away.</B>
<BR><B>Ofcours I later asked my brother if he'd heard anything that night.</B>
<BR><B>He didn't. He didn't hear me going to the bathroom either.</B>
<BR><B>He didn't even noticed that I'd turned on the light in the middle</B>
<BR><B>of the night, which would normally wake him up very easily.</B>
<BR><B>I never told anyone this story, 'cuz at that time I didn't know
it</B>
<BR><B>was all a dream or maybe a fiction of my imagination. But as I</B>
<BR><B>grew up to be as old as I'm now, over the years I started learning</B>
<BR><B>not to doubt my so called 'experiences' with the supernatural.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately the picture was later on lost during</B>
<BR><B>the many times my family and I had moved. Somtimes I wished I</B>
<BR><B>still had it, 'cuz as I'm growing older, the picture of my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather, as I remember it in my head, is slowly fading away...</B>
<BR><B>I've had several more 'experiences', but not anything big like this,</B>
<BR><B>and really not to interesting to write about.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Kinda Scared</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Name is Andrew Nguyen im 18 years old, Im just
like every average teen I goto parties and hang out with my friends. About
one years I spent the night at my friends house, he claimed that his</B>
<BR><B>weirder thing were happening at his house, like for exp he told
me he heard strange noise while he was sleeping, I laugh at him and said
he had ghost, at that time I didn't believe in ghost. Later that night</B>
<BR><B>we where watching a movie, in this room and I got a cold shiver
in my body. While I has sleeping at night a light turned on in this room,
its one of them old lights that up have to plug into the wall in order
for</B>
<BR><B>it to work. so I woke up and looked over at the light I saw the
plug to the light it wasn't plug into the wall outlet, Just then the light
turned off. so I went back to sleep. A few weeks later I decide to sleep
over</B>
<BR><B>at my friends house again. that night we went and saw the movie
the ring, I was a kind afraid it wasn't like me to be afraid of scare movies,
but I kept thinking about the first night I spent at his house.</B>
<BR><B>well that night I had my first encounter with something could really
make it out. when I was sleeping the TV turn on during the night to a blank
channel, and he has cable so that was very strange.. Its also</B>
<BR><B>one of them really old TVs that has no remote to turn it on, my
friend was on his top bunk of this bed he woke up, he's like way is the
TV on, I was kind scared at that moments so we stayed up for abit.</B>
<BR><B>about an hour after the TV turned on I fell a sleep again. I woke
up to a flash of light a bright bright light in front of me... I was scared
but I looked, I saw a bright figure shaped like a very person.. and then

<BR><B>College Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: terri_lacroix@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It wasnt something I, or my roommates noticed at first.&nbsp; Amazingly,
we were never scared or felt an evil or malicious presence.&nbsp; Looking
back on the experience what ever it was, was more playful than anything
else.</B>
<BR><B>I moved into my sorority house in the fall of 1990.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My sorority was new to the campus at Florida State University and instead
of building a new facility, they chose to purchase an existing facility.&nbsp;
>From the appearance of the building(s) it seemed to be a renovated motel
or apartment type building.&nbsp; There was a main house in the front
that was seen from the street, in the rear there were mini apartments
that were outside and not enclosed in the house.</B>
<BR><B>I shared my room with (2) other women.&nbsp; We were in the main
house on the second floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first, most annoying thing we
noticed was in the middle of the night the TV would turn on and flip channels
like crazy.&nbsp; The TV had a built in VCR &amp; the TV would suck any
tapes in, fast forward, rewind, play, push them back out.&nbsp; We always
figured it was just a simple malfunction of the TV. The TV faced the street
and across the street was a fraternity house.&nbsp; We considered that
maybe one of the men living across the street had a TV near their window
&amp; perhaps the remote control was affecting our TV.&nbsp; After investigating
at their house, we found nothing to substantiate our claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We sort of just let it go.</B>
<BR><B>The next thing we noticed was the TV would turn on when we came
home from class at around lunch time.&nbsp; It also flipped to the appropriate
Day Time TV Drama!&nbsp; Again, we just blew it off.</B>
<BR><B>We also had issues with our phone.&nbsp; Over Parents Weekend
my roommates parents brought her favorite novelty phone to her from home.&nbsp;
She unplugged the existing phone, wrapped all the wires up around it, and
put it on my bed.&nbsp; I was visiting w/ my mother &amp; the stupid thing
started ringing!&nbsp; It wasnt even plugged in!!&nbsp; The ringing persisted
and my mom, who did not realize exactly which phone was ringing, asked
with annoyance, Arent you going to answer that?!&nbsp; Dumbfounded,
I told her that I couldnt and showed her it was the completely disconnected
phone.&nbsp; I later put the phone in a box and put it on the top shelf
of my closet.&nbsp; That thing would ring like crazy at all hours of the
day &amp; night, from the box, buried in the closet.</B>
<BR><B>It wasnt until I had moved away &amp; was sharing this story with
a friend that it occurred to me that it was always bitterly cold or excruciatingly
hot in our room.&nbsp; We thought that it being an old building we just
had the cold air (in the Winter) seeping through the windows.&nbsp; We
covered them with duct tape.&nbsp; It didnt help.&nbsp; We would adjust
the thermostat.&nbsp; It didnt help.&nbsp; We would add oscilating fans
for when it was too hot &amp; adjust the thermostat again.&nbsp; It didnt
help.&nbsp; Our House Mother arranged to have someone come check out the
house, check the air conditioners cooling &amp; heating.&nbsp; Nothing
was wrong.&nbsp; They checked the insulation in the house and around the
windows.&nbsp; Again, nothing wrong.&nbsp; It must have been Jorge.</B>
<BR><B>I dont remember when or how we named it.&nbsp; But Jorge just
sort of stuck.&nbsp; We started talking to him.&nbsp; When we came home
from class and the TV would turn on we would say, Thank you, Jorge!&nbsp;
When the TV went crazy in the middle of the night, I could usually just
call out, Not NOW Jorge!&nbsp; We are trying to sleep! (study) and it
would just stop!&nbsp; The phone would ring from the depths of the closet
&amp; we would acknowledge Jorge letting him know we knew he was there
and it would stop (or get crazier!! Ha Ha)</B>
<BR><B>Recently, my former roommate and I were talking about Jorge.&nbsp;
We will always wonder what or who Jorge was.&nbsp; The house is gone
now.&nbsp; All that is there is a parking lot.&nbsp; I will always wonder
where he went.&nbsp; I told my old roommate that sometimes I wish I could
have just brought him with me, so I know he is OK.&nbsp; I guess thats
weird, though, right!?</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Short True Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Mastercloud7@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It has been about Three to Four years since it happened. Me and my
brother were driving home from Disney Land. We were on this mountain side,
it was late, probably around One A.M. My brother was about to fall asleep
at the wheel, and I was pretty tired too. I thought something was strange,
because I kept hearing a truck honking in the distance, like when a big
rig blows it's horn. I looked out the windshield, and saw something that
will probably haunt me in the dark for years to come. It didn't really
look like a woman, but it had the shape of one. Like steam coming out of
a sewer, but it actually had the shape of a woman (there were no sewers
in the area, I asure you). I got shocked awake right away. When we drove
through it, the radio bgan blaring static, very loud static. I could faintly
make out the sound of screaming in the static, but it also sounded like
screeching. It only happened for about eight seconds. My brother was shocked
awake as well, by the blaring radio. I remained quiet until we got home.
I told him about the radio, I told him that it was probably just the static
from the mountains, but he told me he had a CD in at the time. I don't
travel anywhere near mountains late at night anymore.</B>

<BR><B>Daytona Beach (Hollywood Street)</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tinastuff@bellsouth.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I saw the story of the Haunting of a House on Hollywood, my family
and myself lived in a house on Hollywood Ave. it was 38 South Hollywood
Ave. Daytona Beach Florida.</B>
<BR><B>This house is approx. 100 or more years old.</B>
<BR><B>And one morning I was sitting on the couch and out of the corner
of my eye I thought I saw something and I turned my head and at the top
of the stairs there was the figure of a woman dressed in 1600 period clothes
and a bonnet on her head but I could see though her.</B>
<BR><B>She was looking right at me and things got moved around the house
so one day I got up the courage to tell my two daugthers and to my amazement
they had see her too.</B>
<BR><B>One seen her brushing her hair looking into my dresser mirror in
my and mine husband's bedroom and the other one said she was sitting on
the bed upstairs looking out the bedroom window that looked straight at
the grave yard on main street and she was crying.</B>
<BR><B>I went and spoke to a Historian on Daytona&nbsp; and they helped
me look up some people that lived in the area and there was a young woman
named Arlanea Smith they told me to look in the Grave Yard and my daughther
and I did and we found her mother and father and then on the side of her
mother's grave stone down by the ground in the grass we found the name</B>
<BR><B>Abagail Smith she died when she was a young woman and drowned in
the river.</B>
<BR><B>But she was never given a grave stone of her own and no one knows
why.</B>
<BR><B>But I will never forget one night my daugthers and I was alone in
the house and a man parked across the street and he came up on the porch
and something scared him so bad he ran back across the street and backed
up so fast he hit the wall and then flew down the road I think Arlanea
was protecting us because she never showed herself to any of the men in
the family only myself and my daugthers.</B>
<BR><B>So the caretaker of the property ask the last people to live in
the house before us if they had seen a ghost and they said that they had.</B>
<BR><B>But she never tryed to scare us, something was making her so sad
and I ofter wonder because she drown in the river maybe she was never given
a proper burial and she greaves over it to this day.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Family's Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Nimtz2502@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Sherry and I would like to share my story with you.&nbsp;
About a year ago my family and I moved into a new appartment in the town
I had grown up in.&nbsp; In my family at the time there were six of us.
My husband, my two children,&nbsp; a foster child and my brother.&nbsp;
My son Joey was two at the time.&nbsp; Immediatly after moving in strange
things began happening to my little boy that started to frighten me, and
I don't get scared easily.</B>
<BR><B>My son would run out of his bedroom screaming and crying, telling
me somebody was talking to him.&nbsp; I would immediatly run to his room
and check it out but never found anything.&nbsp; My brother would run up
to the second floor to see if the neighbors were home so we could "logically"
explain this phenominom.&nbsp; The neighbors were never there.&nbsp; So
I</B>
<BR><B>became concerned.&nbsp; When my son had come out screaming for the
third time I was no longer concerned but angry.&nbsp; I went into his room
and asked whoever was scaring my child to please stop, he's only a baby
and means no harm to you.</B>
<BR><B>All was quiet for a long time after untill, one day while doing
the dishes I heard my son having a conversation with somebody.&nbsp; When
I went in to check on him I asked him who he was talking to.&nbsp; He told
me he was talking to the man standing next to me.&nbsp; He asked me why
I didn't see him.&nbsp; I asked him what this man looked like. He replied
that it was an old man like grampy, he was tall, wore a white shirt, black
pants and white sneakers.&nbsp; I thought wow, is this real or does Joey
have an imaginary friend.&nbsp; He would talk to "The Man" often.&nbsp;
He never mentioned a name just "the man".&nbsp;&nbsp; I let him talk to
"the man" I never said anything against it.&nbsp; Then about three weeks
later joey came running from the living room to the kitchen where I was
and held on to my leg for dear life.&nbsp; I thought he was hugging me
so I said "I love you too".&nbsp; Then he started crying and shaking.&nbsp;
I quickly picked him up and asked him what was wrong.&nbsp; He said "the
man" had scared him.&nbsp; I had had it.&nbsp; I went into</B>
<BR><B>the living room and sternly told the man he should be ashamed of
himself for scaring the nice little boy who enjoyed his company and to
go away untill he could play nicely.&nbsp; Then my son looked at me and
told me the man was gone.&nbsp; From then on things got stranger</B>
<BR><B>Come to find out my appartment had been the home to a friend's of
mine grandparents.&nbsp; Her grandfather had passed in my living room by
heart attack.&nbsp; She had come to visit once and only once because she
was so overwhelmed with saddness.&nbsp; She said she could feel him there
and could not come back to visit me in that house again.</B>

<P><B>Walking</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: asylum_for_the_dead@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I've had one experience in my house and one in my neighbors house.
I will tell you of both.</B>
<BR><B>I live in Hamilton Ontario Canada. Pretty big city. My house is
located in a small part of it. We know all the neighbours and i've been
living in the same house for the past 17 years. My bedroom in my house
is on the main floor. My room is right across from my grandparents floor
which is the upstairs part of the house, it's like another house. if you
stand outside of my door, facing my grandparents door, and look to the
left, there's my kitchen/dinning room.</B>
<BR><B>One late night, i was reading in my room and decided to get a drink
of water. As i started out of my room, i heard some noises in my living
room. If you walk into my kitchen, on the left wall there's a big opening
to where the living room is.</B>
<BR><B>The noises i heard were walking and whispering, but i couldn't make
out the whispers. My brothers were in my grandparents house that night,
seeing is how my grandparents were gone for the summer, and my parents
were sleeping at the other end of the hall.</B>
<BR><B>I brushed it off and got my water from the fridge. Then i heard
the walking from one end of the living room that i couldn't see to the
other. when i looked to the opening, the walking stopped. i got spooked
and ran to my grandparents house to tell my older and younger brother.
My older brother doesn't believe in that sort of thing, so he when downstairs
and checked everything out. he told me it's just because the house is old
(almost 70) and that it was my imagination. my younger brother didn't say
anything.</B>
<BR><B>My neighbours house was just build about 5 years ago. brand new
and a beautiful house. when you walk in the front door, there's a hall
that leads to the kitchen and stairs that lead to the bedrooms. when you
walk directly up the stairs, you end up in front of the main bedroom. to
the left, there is a guestroom beside the main bedroom, then the younger
son's room, Nick. he was about 9 at the time. to the right of the main
bedroom, there's the bathroom and a little bit further there is the daughter's
room, who is a good friend of mine, Danielle. She at the time was about
15 or 16. All the rooms were aligned in a half circle sort of way. if you
walk down the hall from the front door, it leads to the dining room, kitchen
and living room, all in one big room.</B>
<BR><B>4 years go, i was babysitting Nick. Danielle went out with some
friends and so did his parents. it was about 10:30 and i was on the phone
with my current boyfriend. that's when i heard walking. from the kitchen,
i can see the rail of the stairs. i didn't see anything. i heard walking
that went up and down the stairs only. it would never leave the bottom
step. i told my boyfriend what was happening and i called out "Hello?"
and the walking stopped. Freaked out, i took the cordless phone and a knife
(not that it had any use to it) and started toward the stairs. I started
to call out Nick but he was sound asleep when i looked into his open door
and he's not the one to do these kind of scary things because he gets spooked
easily himself. I brushed it off and went back down to the kitchen, still
on the phone.</B>
<BR><B>Now, when you walk up the main stairs to the main bedroom, the 2
doors are always closed when no one is in the room. About 15 minutes after
i heard the walking on the stairs, it happened again. Only, it was walking
a bit faster and it walked from room to room and up the stairs. From Nick's
room, to the guest room, down the stairs and back up, the main room, the
bathroom, danielle's room and around again. I started to get really really
scared now. Note: i'm still on the phone this entire time. I yelled out
hello and it stopped. I decided to check again. Grab the cordless, grab
the knife and i made my way to the stairs. I looked around the half circle
of the upper floor. All the doors were open which was normal. I called
out Nick's name and no answer from him, all i could hear was his snoring
which i heard all night. Then i looked at the main bedroom. The doors were
wide open. i took a few steps up and looked in the room, on the verge of
tears. The blinds in that room are always open. And when the blinds are
open, light seeps through and lights up the room. Well, the only light
i could see in that room was outside the window. the room was pitch black.
I stared at that room for a few minutes, tears running down my face, my
boyfriend asking me if i was ok. I yelled out nick's name a dozen times
to wake him up without me going to get him. When that didn't work i booted
to his room, i told my boyfriend that i'd call him back, i put the phone
in my pocket, the knife (it wasn't that sharp anyway) in my back pocket
and picked up nick in the blanket. I ran downstairs into the light of the
kitchen/living room/dining room and i put him on the couch so that i could
keep an eye on him. I fell asleep after i called my boyfriend back. I didn't
heard the footsteps the rest of the night.</B>
<BR><B>I dont babysit him anymore. It was only that one night that it happened.
I have been to their house so many times, this has never happened. It's
scary though, i never liked going into Nick's room.</B>
<BR><B>Note: I found out four years later (today actually) that Nick refuses
to sleep in his room. He says that they're something/someone in his room
and the room is always cold. He's been sleeping in his parents room on
the floor for while, going in his room only to get clothes from his draws.
He's 13 now. His parents don't believe him but i have no doubt that there's
something in that house, despite the age of the building.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Families Experiences continued...</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Nimtz2502@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>After my friends visit she told me about another spirit that was
in the house.&nbsp; Her grandmother had always sworn that there was a little
girl that inhabited the bedroom that was my childrens.&nbsp; I kept this
info. to myself since my husband thought I was crazy already anyway.&nbsp;
Then one day I saw him stop in front of my childrens bedroom with my nefew
at his side.&nbsp; I saw them both look at each other and then they went
into to the dark room and came back out fast.&nbsp; He told me he had heard
a little girl talking, as if she were reading a book.&nbsp; The childrens'
books were all over the floor when he walked in.&nbsp; He stopped thinking
I was crazy.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I think after the visit from my friend,
I became very sensitive to something that was in our home.&nbsp; I would
hear whispering,&nbsp; I couldn't make it out though.&nbsp; everytime I
closed a door behind me it sounded like someone was pacing outside it.&nbsp;
When I would lay down to bed and close my eyes,&nbsp; there would be this
bright blue flash of light and some one would say my name wery softly.&nbsp;
I would run to my husband, who is a night owl, and tell him what had happened.&nbsp;
I would ask if someone had turned on a light did a police car go by anything.&nbsp;
But no.&nbsp; This light flash would be so bright that my eyes would ache.&nbsp;
This kept happening to me, so I came to the conclusion that since this
had started happening to me after my friend's visit that mybe her grandad's
spirit was trying to get my attention because of her.&nbsp; I begged her
to come for another visit but she wouldn't.&nbsp; We had to move because
this Phenominom kept happening to me and it became too painful for me.</B>
<BR><B>And that is our story.&nbsp; All true, take it or leave it.</B>
<BR><B>I do have many more experiances but I don't want to take up all
of your time.&nbsp; This one was just the most odd.</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I married my husband and we I moved to the mountains of Tennessee.</B>
<BR><B>I was awakened in the middle of the night by a large bumping sound
.&nbsp; I opened my eyes to see a robed figure with a hood moving from
my closet over my bed .&nbsp; I could see the folds in the flowing robe
move as the figure moved, but could not detect a face.&nbsp;&nbsp; There
was a glow around the figure.&nbsp; The robe was wine colored .&nbsp; I
looked at my clock to see the time and pinched myself to make sure I was
not dreaming.&nbsp; I even turned to see if my husband was awake&nbsp;
and I kept punching him but I could not utter a sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through the years I have experienced other paranormal happenings but I
do not like to discuss them with others.&nbsp; Most people that have never
experienced things like this thing you are bonkers.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost or Intruder</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Gogglespyzon@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The other night my wife and I were entertaining friends at our home.
It was me my and two other couples. We all had dinner and coffee shared
a few laughs and some stories. We all decided to watch a movie so we all
moved downstairs to the basement were the entertainment center is set up.
It was around 10 o'clock when we began watching the movie Chicago on DVD.
We sat in our chairs my wife had put out some popcorn and pretzels in case
any one of our guests felt like snacking and we began watching the movie.
Around 10:35 I began hearing a light thumping sound in the house and it
sounded like it came from upstairs. I looked around to see if anyone else
had noticed the sound and it appeared that everyone was into the movie
and had not noticed so I choose to ignore it.</B>
<BR><B>I was starting to feel a little sleepy so I began dosing off during
the movie when suddenly i heard this loud bang that startled me I know
it was not from the movie because it sounded like it happened next to my
ear I quickly made like I had not been sleeping cause i did not want our
guests to feel uncomfortable thinking that I had no interest in them being
over the house no one had noticed that I had fallen asleep I turned my
attention to the loud bang I heard. I lost interest in the movie and now
my thoughts were focused on the noise in the house I looked at the clock
on the VCR and it was 10:59 I pretended I needed to go to the bathroom
so I walked upstairs and walked through all the rooms I noticed nothing
wrong I went back downstairs and joined my company only to see the lights
were on and the television not working.</B>
<BR><B>I asked my wife what happened and she told me that the DVD player
and the television set just went off. My friend was looking behind the
equipment and the wiring and he found nothing wrong we checked the fuse
box and there was nothing wrong, well on that note our guests decided to
call it a night and left. My wife was starting to pick up the snacks when
the VCR clock began blinking 12:00 a.m. "The power is back" my wife said
I turned to switch to the television on and it was working fine, I was
tired and I did not care to investigate why there was a power outage I
was going to do it in the morning.</B>
<BR><B>As we were winding down our clean up my wife and I heard something
slam on the glass table we have in the basement. We looked at each other
like what was that. I wondered over to the table and everything looked
fine I don't know I told my wife lets go to bed when we heard footsteps
coming from upstairs. My wife now frightened thought we had an intruder
in the house she made me go upstairs I reluctantly did as I was going up
the stairs I could have sworn I had the feeling I was chasing after someone
cause the footsteps were getting louder</B>
<BR><B>I turned on all the lights nothing was there then I heard footsteps
in the dining room so I went in there turned on the light and all I saw
was the chandelier swaying. No window was open and there was no draft in
the house. Nothing has happened since. Was it a ghost Don't know.</B><B></B>

<P><B>hey, i gotta say i love the site, and i believe for</B>
<BR><B>the most part that the stories are entirely true which</B>
<BR><B>is really cool.&nbsp; but any way i have a great fasination</B>
<BR><B>with the ocult/magik/supernatural and stuff.&nbsp; its been</B>
<BR><B>my idea that the supernatural winks back at those who</B>
<BR><B>wink at it, meaning if you believe it shows itself to</B>
<BR><B>you.&nbsp; but anyway i live in pelham new york and in my</B>
<BR><B>house when i moved in i had a certain thought about</B>
<BR><B>the aura surounding it.&nbsp; me and my mom both agree that</B>
<BR><B>it has very good karma surrounding it, but i think it</B>
<BR><B>has lingering energy of tenants past, its over 100</B>
<BR><B>years old.&nbsp; also as a side not, i am irish, and am</B>
<BR><B>sure i have a familial banshee, will come up later.</B>
<BR><B>any who i have seen a few apiritions like, i saw a</B>
<BR><B>little boy standing infront of the door as i was</B>
<BR><B>reading, and a white apirition floating accross the</B>
<BR><B>hallway, i think that might have been a banshee.&nbsp; i</B>
<BR><B>hear foot steps all throughout the house.&nbsp; i started</B>
<BR><B>getting very paranoid about the supernatural so i made</B>
<BR><B>an evil eye, blue of course, to watch over my room and</B>
<BR><B>house, and nothing has happened since.&nbsp; personally i</B>
<BR><B>think it is better when you make it yourself, you put</B>
<BR><B>your energy into making it is better. but just a</B>

<P><B>By: kalev@hwy.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all the sites on the net i have found this the most
interesting.</B>
<BR><B>I have psychic feelings.A few experiences,I now live i a rural area
~200 miles NW from Sydney,Australia.Around october 1993 on a drive back
from house hunting there was a place that is at the bottom of a hill at
~16:30 hours.Running across the road a a distance of approximatly 300 feet
was a man,about 100 foot high!Seemed more like a shadow and was wearing
old fashioned clothing,a bit rough.I was the only one who saw it.</B>
<BR><B>When i moved to this house i had vivid dreams of i suspect the dead
owner,saying it my house.She was told go back to the other world.When i
went walking out back in the bush there across my path ran a siluette of
an Australian Aborigine carrying a spear!</B>
<BR><B>Other stuff i've seen.Way towards the end of the property on a rock,all
rocks and hills are pure granite,pity i didn't have a camera handy,what
you would call an Energy Rod.it was about a foot long and glowed a bluish
colour,i thought why is there a fluroescent tube there.It dissapeared after
a few seconds.I have also seen UFO related stuff.</B>
<BR><B>I recently purchased an old "Portable"(Very heavy actually) valve
gramaphone.I have strong feelings the original owner still lives within.As
the circuit chassis looked rusty and dangerous it has been stripped and
am building a new amp.At the initial strong feeling i asked 'What is your
name?' and the old man said George.I feel he died in aged about 75.It is
at this point sitting in the laundry which adjoins the computer room.</B>
<BR><B>I feel he is looking at me write this.</B>
<BR><B>I like many people have had things moved and stolen,when i am not
looking.Eg i bought a box of 30 plastic rulers (They were a bargain),within
3 months they have all dissapeared.I have searched the room,to no avail,and
as far i know they were'nt humanly moved to another room!</B>
<BR><B>Hope you haven't fallen asleep with this rather long winded letter...</B>

<P><B>More Comfortable with Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mccam@thegateway.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Reading the recent posting about the hauntings in the Jefferson Hotel
in Jefferson, Texas caused me to recall this story.</B>
<BR><B>The restoration of Jefferson was begun in the early 1960's by the
Jefferson Garden Club. The first commercial restoration was the Excelsior
House Hotel. (At that time the Jefferson Hotel was still a residence hotel
and in rather poor shape) My mother had heard about the Excelsior House
so we drove out from Dallas for the weekend to see the town and stay at
the Excelsior.</B>
<BR><B>The town was beautiful in its age. It has since become all too "cutesy",
but at that time Jefferson retained much of its earlier charm. The restored
Excelsior House had only been open a couple of months and was in fine shape.
My parents shared a large bedroom and I was in a small "drummer's room"
nearby. No one had mentioned a thing about ghosts in the place so I stayed
up late reading. My Mom decided to have a cigarette before bed and stepped
out into the hall to smoke. I heard her speaking to someone and thought
little of it.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning I asked my Mom, in passing, who she was talking
to last night. She answered " A very sad lady". Being 11, I just left it
at that.</B>
<BR><B>Many years later my wife and I went to spend a weekend in Jefferson
and had a delightful time. When we returned we discussed the trip with
my Mom. She shared her experience of that night with us.&nbsp; About midnight
she had decided to step out into the large stair landing to have a cigarette
and admire the building. As she was standing there she turned around and
saw a young woman in a long dress moving toward her. The woman looked very
distraught and&nbsp; Mom realized that this was no real person, but the
ghost was not scary either. The ghost looked at my Mom who just said "What's
the matter, dear?" The woman answered "It so sad, so sad..." My Mom who
was deeply moved by the woman's clear distress and realizing that this
must be a ghost, answered "Its been over a long time ago, dear"&nbsp; At
this the woman faded away.&nbsp; Mom returned to her room, shaken but never
really afraid. The ghost impressed her only by her sadness and distress.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning Mom discreetly asked the lady at the desk if there
had been any thing strange seen....she got the "well, you never know in
an old place" type of answer. I understand that now, the Exclesior House,
and the rest of Jefferson, have become much more comfortable with their
ghosts.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Name is Danielle</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DnlRym@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I always sensed things around, but the first time I saw something
I was 10 yrs. old. I walked upstairs &amp; turned to go in my bedroom when
i saw an orange man sitting on my bed, he was looking at me, but the only
visible feature on his face was a smile. I ran into the bathroom( across
from the bedrrom )&amp; started screaming my brothers name, he ignored
me for a minute, then came upstairs. He could tell by how scared I was
that something really happened, &amp; he believed me- thank God, because
he was the only one who would end up believing me. During that same year
I was visiting my Dad in colorado. I was outside playing &amp; there was
a hill with aathway that went down about 20 ft. to more flay ground. i
looked down &amp; saw a little boy (about 8 yrs. old) standing at the bottom
of the path. He had brown hair &amp; was wearing blue shorts &amp; a yellow
t-shirt with some writing on it. I was excited when I saw him because I
thought I had found a kid to play with, but as i stared at him I thought
he wasn't very nice, &amp; was trying to figure out what was wrong with
his face, there was something bad about his eyes, then he just faded away.
I ran &amp; told my dad &amp; he just told me to go inside. After that
is when all the nightmares began, so many that I barely ever got any sleep.
Me, my Mom &amp; brother had moved to these project apartments that were
still in the process of being built, me &amp; a girl named Shawna were
the first 2 family's to move in. We connected &amp; became best friends
immediately. The first time we met we grabbed eachothers hands &amp; looked
at eachother before speaking. Soon she told me about all her ghost experiences
&amp; I told her mine. We began experiencing things together, &amp; would
often spend the night &amp; sleep under her bed to "hide from the ghosts"
One experience we had together was really amazing. We were awake &amp;&nbsp;
looking out her window at 3 in the morning, when we saw this white thing
about 4 ft. high, which looked like a stick figure hopping across the parking
lot. It was very strange because the thing wasn't even scarey looking,
it looked like a cartoon character, but it hopped so high it went above
the carports. Afterwards we were both freaking out &amp; I asked her what
she saw &amp; she said" a white guy jumping &amp; flying" I was so glad
there was finally someone who did not think I was a lyer, or&nbsp; just
making things up. when i was 14 my Mom got married &amp; we moved into
a house across town, While i was sad to move from Shawna, I was glad to
move away from the "ghosts". nothing happened for a year, until i was 15.
I was laying in my bed, directly behind my head was the wall. Suddenly
i felt something blow on the back of my head, I sat half way up &amp; quickly
turned my head, It then blew in my eye, but I saw nothing there. I layed
back down with my eyes shut tight, frozen with fear, Something tapped my
shoulder, then ribs, then my thigh very hard, I did not open my eyes. I
couldn't even scream for a few minutes. then finally started screaming
loud for my mom, who ran in &amp; comforted me a little, but didn't seem
too concerned. Another night I was having one of my nightmares when i woke
up to find the room spinning so bad it felt like i was pinned to the bed.
Spider webs &amp; faces were appearing right before my open eyes, so fast
the room was filling with them, I couldn't even see the white walls, then
a face came swirlind down right in front of mine with really huge eyes
, it said Hi I'm Davel with a smiIe, then everything just stopped. I was
pouring sweat so bad itwas like i had just ran the mile. Then once, during
the day I walked into my room &amp; saw what looked like blurry air coming
towards me fast, it went right through me with a strange tingling sensation.
After&nbsp; that i began praying alot &amp; nothing else happened for a
while. By this time my dad had moved closer &amp; i went to live with him
when I was 16. I thought for sure this time i had finally escaped it all,
but that's when the scariest things ever began to happen. One night I had
just barely layed down in bed, (my Dad was asleep in the livingroom) when
I heard a whisper say " psst hey you" I looked around &amp; saw nothing,
then as I lay on my side something behind me whispered "turn around" i
was so horrified i kept my eyes shut &amp; didn't move( my all time favorite
defense tactic) That began to happen every night, &amp; on one occasion
icy cold air moved past me above my bed making a low hissing/ growling
noise &amp; it had a really rotten smell. I never told my dad, because
I was learning by this time that no one believes you when you say these
things, &amp; it makes them think differently of you. Actually, a couple
of things I'm telling about here, i have never told anyone before. So,
i started spending the night at a friends house as much possible to avoid
being alone in my room, &amp; my Dad was hurt because he thought I wasn't
happy living with him &amp; didn't want to be around him, &amp; here he
was cooking dinners for me, &amp; I wasn't even coming home to eat. To
make a long story short, no too much more happened in the next 5 yrs. Until
i was 22. I was pregnant with my son &amp;&nbsp; about to go to sleep.
My boyfriend was already asleep in bed next to me. I started to see a couple
figures moving around the room, my first rational thought was burglars,
until I saw one disapear into the dresser, then my attention turned to
this black guy staring at me, i could see him perfect, even in the dark.
He had yellow amber colored eyes, but not scarey. He looked about 55 &amp;
had his shirt off, for some reason i thought he was a cole miner, then
he disapeared. I turned and woke up my boyfriend &amp; said I just saw
a ghost, he smiled at me cute &amp; said "aw, are you scared? come here"
pulled me close to him &amp; fell right back asleep. Great, another disbeliver!&nbsp;
&amp; for my last experience ever, I was 25 (3 yrs. ago) I was in my own
apartment ( Shawna was my roommate by the way) but she was not home that
night. I was having a nightmare that this schizophrenic guy that&nbsp;
lived next door was opening my bedroom door. I woke up because my waterbed
was moving all around. I opened my eyes &amp; saw somone standing over
me on my bed with my blanket over their head, the blanket was suctioning
to them, like it was being sucked onto them it then laid down on me &amp;
was heavier than any person of that size would be. Right away I had these
hardcore chills going through me, but they weren't my chills, they were
someone elses, if that makes sense. The chills were so strong i totally
froze me &amp; I heard a vey loud sound loike powerlines. It felt like
it was trying to go throught me, but didn't. I was praying very hard in
my head &amp; it stopped. i think I layed there for a while &amp; then
fell asleep eventually.&nbsp; Well these are all my experiences, I'm not
the greatest writer but you get the picture. Hopefully now it is REALLY
over, for good!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Moving Day</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pbldgreceptionist@bv.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hello, my name is paul and I live in Kansas city, mo. Found this
sight by</B>
<BR><B>accident and have grown to love it. I have also shared a couple
of stories</B>
<BR><B>with you so far, but like many sensitives the experiences continue
to</B>
<BR><B>happen. Spending many nights here at work reading ghost stories
is the norm</B>
<BR><B>for me. Having read over 4000 of these stories and others have giving
me</B>
<BR><B>proof that I'm not the only crazy guy.</B>
<BR><B>It had been over 7 months since I had my last encounter with the
paranormal</B>
<BR><B>at my best friends house. Not just Two weeks ago my grandma moved
from her</B>
<BR><B>house to some duplexes that are closer to my aunt's house for comfort.
As I</B>
<BR><B>was helping her move in to her apartment I had this feeling come
over me</B>
<BR><B>like a cloud of pot smoke at a Pink Floyd concert. Although it was
not</B>
<BR><B>threatening it was still very strange.&nbsp; That was just the beginning.
When I</B>
<BR><B>was moving my grandma's oxygen tank into her closet in her bedroom
I herd</B>
<BR><B>someone say "What are you going to do with that?" I spun around
so fast to</B>
<BR><B>the direction of the voice and found no body there. Everyone was
outside on</B>
<BR><B>the driveway unloading the U-haul. So eventually I kept going. After
My dad</B>
<BR><B>and I Got the bed set up my dad looked at me and said "have you
felt</B>
<BR><B>anything weird about this place?" I said yea and told him about
the voice in</B>
<BR><B>the closet and he told me when he went walking into the bathroom
he saw the</B>
<BR><B>handle on the toilet move down by itself and flush all on its own.&nbsp;
Then not</B>
<BR><B>a second later he had the sensation of someone walking by and bumping
in to</B>
<BR><B>him. Freaked out he jetted outa there like a rabbit being pursued
by a</B>
<BR><B>cheetah. As we were setting up her TV and entertainment system I
was bent</B>
<BR><B>over hooking up wires in the back when I saw a person walk right
up behind</B>
<BR><B>me out of the corner of my eye and tap me on the shoulder. Stunned
I spun</B>
<BR><B>around and saw my family staring at me like I just saw Jesus or
something.</B>
<BR><B>They asked what was wrong thinking I got hurt and I asked them if
they saw</B>
<BR><B>it. NO, I was the only one out of 6 people. The figure looked around
six</B>
<BR><B>foot tall had a big black overcoat on and a top hat from around
the forties</B>
<BR><B>or fifties. I could see no face, just a figure.&nbsp; The ghost
did not present</B>
<BR><B>anything buy curiosity. Probably just wondering who the hell is
moving into</B>
<BR><B>his home again. My grandma from time to time will call my mom to
tell her</B>
<BR><B>about strange noises and voices and other creepy happenings. None
the events</B>
<BR><B>seem dangerous nor does the entity seem evil or mean. I think he
was just</B>
<BR><B>trying to talk to me. After all it could have been 50 years or more
since he</B>
<BR><B>had a person to talk to. Thanks for reading this. I have many more</B>
<BR><B>experiences to share with you, but I have simply run out of time.&nbsp;
Time to</B>
<BR><B>get back to work later.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Moved Out</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>Last April my Boyfriend and I bought our first home, it was 26 years
old, and so we did need to fix it up a bit.&nbsp; (Now I have to back track
a little bit, when I was a small child I had lived about two blocks away
from the home that we purchased, the house that I lived in as a small child,
is the same age as the home my boyfriend and I bought.)</B>
<BR><B>My childhood home, contained the ghost of a man, that we came to
call Henrey, he was heard by everyone, opening cupboard doors, and running
up and down the stairs, and opening the door to my sisters and my nursery.&nbsp;
He was seen only by a few, and htose who saw him, all described him as
a tall man, with an old fashioned hat on, and a kindly face, I was one
of the people that saw him. I had woken from a bad dream, and was screaming
for my Mom, but found him sitting on the side of my bed, he put his fingers
to his lips, to silence me, and I suddenly felt very safe, and I feel back
asleep. The next morning, My Uncle who was staying with us, asked my Mom
if I was okay, and my mom asked him why confused, he said he heard me scream
and heard someone run into my room, and then I stopped screaming. &amp;nbs&nbsp;
Henery never did anything to make the family uncomfortable, and we did
our best to respect that he like to wander at nights.&nbsp; We moved when
I was eleven, and my parents current home is uneventful, they also no longer
live in the same community.</B>
<BR><B>When we purchased the home last year, my younger sister, had mentioned
a cold feeling coming over her in a back bedroom, and I just attributed
it to the fact that the doors were all open while moving in furniture.&nbsp;
Later that day I was putting away China in a hutch my grandmother had given
me, the door had a postion that it would get heavily stuck in, and so I
put it the stuck postion so that I wouldnt have to keep opening and closing
it, (Its a pain to take out of the stuck postion) The door swung shut twice
and extremly hard rattling the glass and at one point almost shutting on
my hand, as this was happening an extremly cold chill came over me. My
boyfriend was a non believer at this point and said that I must not have
put it in the right positon. I knew I had. Things were okay for about a
week, and then I decided it was time to start updating the home, so I removed
wall paper, and started getting wall ready for painting, thats when things
started getting a little chaotic, The phone would come unplugged, or in
the middle of a conversation it would go dead, things would be moved to
random locations, and the the light bulbs exploded in their light fixturers.
As soon as we finished making changes it would calm down again. THis happend
over a period of about 6 months. I had started getting terrified vibes,
and was unable to sleep, I refused to sleep in the house alone, unless
allt he lights were on and I had the dogs with me, the dogs had started
skirting around the dining room, and were extremly skiddish if the came
anywhere near it.&nbsp; The worst even happened when I was walking upstairs
one night, It felt like someone grabbed my feet and ripped them out from
under me with extreme force, I feel hard on my wrist and face, spraining
the wrist and ruising my face, my boyfriend came home to find me crumpled
at the bottom of the stairs, hysterical and in horrible pain. Strange things
continued in the house, not so violent as my attack, but that things would
turn up in diffrent locations, there were heavy vibes of anger and hatred,
it mangaed to make me so emotionally unstable, that we decided to rent
the home out, and move back in with our parents.</B>
<BR><B>Anywyas I just though Id share this with you as it did get to a
point where I was physically harmed. Thank you for reading this.</B>

<P><B>Little Girl Lost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lillycat2003@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>well i was getting ready for bed one night and i went to turn off
the lights by my bed and i have mirrors all along one side of my wall.
well anyways when i crawled into bed i looked over to the side and i saw
a little girl standing in the mirror. she had a white dress that had been
tanned by dirt. she had blonde hair hanging in her face and she looked
filthy. she also had scars all along her face that looked a bit like slash
marks.. i stared in shock for a moment and then she was gone. i have seen
this girl before at my old house but she never seemed to bother me to much.
i have always been a bit frightened by her but i also felt a sort of comfort
by her precence. (please excuse my spelling) another time i have been visited
by a small child was at my mothers house. i slept in a room with my sister.
we had bunkbeds and i always slept on the bottom half. anyway around 10:00
p.m. i went to bed and that was early for me because during the summer
i dont usually go to bed untill 4:00 a.m. well i woke up around midnight
to find myself in a pitch black room. i quickly got up to turn on my lights
and then i went and layed back down. well there is a big arm chair in the
corner of my room and when i was laying in bed i scenced something in the
corner of the room where the arm chair is. i looked up to find a girl sitting
on the chair with her hair also in her face.her hair was black and a bit
above her shoulders. she looked up at me and i froze. she quickly vanished
and i ran to my mothers room in fear. my mothers house is known to be haunted.
when me and my mother were outside at night by the car. we were looking
in the trunk when all of a sudden my mom was lifted o the ground and was
shoved forward into the trunk. we ran back inside after that. i have many
more experinces but ill spare you the long stories.</B>

<P><B>Martha Washington Inn</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: bwilkerson@bscnc.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had an experience at the Martha Washington Inn in Abingdon, Va
I will share with you. I was a professional musician and was staying at
the Inn for a week while we worked in town. Upon checking in the desk staff
told us the place was haunted and shared several stories that appear on
your Martha Washington Inn web page. I laughed as the stories were related
to me thinking them to be the product of overly imaginative minds.</B>
<BR><B>My room was on the top floor at the very top of the stairs. Upon
returning from playing one night I noticed the light was on in my room
and was shining out from under the door. I am certain I left no light on.
My door was locked as I had left it. Upon opening the door me and my bandmates
saw that all of the lights in the room were on. The TV and radio were on
full blast but no station was tuned in. The water was running full blast
in the sink and the toilet had just been flushed and was running. There
was the shape of where a person had been lying on the bed.</B>
<BR><B>I was completely freaked out. So were my mates. In fact, this still
bothers me today. I could not sleep the rest of the night and as it was
our last night in town, I could not check out fast enough in the morning.
All of my bandmates were with me all night so I know it could not have
been one of them playing a trick on me. As I was getting in the band bus
I looked up to the fourth floor window where my room was. I could see a
lady in victorian era clothing standing at the window looking down on me.

<P><B>House in the Bronx</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Assunta9581@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I grew up in this house. My name is Sue. My father owned both houses.
The address above is the one we lived in. It was haunted but nothing compared
to the house to the left of it. I don't remember the number of the house.
My father rented out the one to the left of 2047 house and always had trouble
keeping tenants due to all the disturbances. I am not sure how many spirits
there are in the house but the main one is a man who you see most regularly.
There is also a little girl that had grown fond of my mother and would
constantly call her and even followed us to our new home when we moved.
The whole family has heard her. There is also a section in the basement
of this house that my father found when doing some renovations. a little
room in the wall with a name carved into the cement. My mother made him
close it up and not disturb it in fear of upsetting something. The things
that went on in this house were unreal. You heard footsteps in the attic.
The basement was a place that you just never wanted to go. there was always
such a coldness in that basement. Not even animals wanted to go in there.
Whenever my grandmother went out on the porch to hang laundry the porch
door would slam shut and lock her out on the porch. The spirit did not
like doilies under the lamps. He would take them. Tenets would complain
that they would be on the couch watching TV when all of a sudden they would
get a chill and turn around and there he would be standing over them behind
the couch. There is just so much more to tell but not enough room in this
email. But just wanted to let you guys know that these two houses were
definitely haunted. And some neighbors two houses down said they also had
problems so maybe it was the area that was haunted. Who knows. If you have
any questions feel free to get in touch.</B>

<P><B>Stories about Old Dubois Central</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: roxy_chica05@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>You have dubois central christian down as one of the haunted places,
but you</B>
<BR><B>don't have any good stories to go with it.</B>
<BR><B>I am not sure about the headmaster but you could be refering to
Father</B>
<BR><B>Leopold. Father Leopold is the one ghost that haunts central that
everyone</B>
<BR><B>knows. Father Leopold died in a car crash and he was the cross country
coach</B>
<BR><B>at central.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; In 2000 a korean exchange student came to central to live
with the english</B>
<BR><B>teacher and their family. One night the english teacher had to come
back to</B>
<BR><B>get some papers and the boy went and waited. While there he was
walking</B>
<BR><B>around the halls and he saw a man sitting on a bench in the lobby
area. he</B>
<BR><B>supposedly talked to the man or said hi to the man and then he went
on his</B>
<BR><B>way and went to the teachers room. He asked the teacher who the
man was that</B>
<BR><B>was in the lobby, thinking that it was a janitor. The english teacher
than</B>
<BR><B>quized the boy about the man to see about it. She asked him what
he had on</B>
<BR><B>and waht he looked like and stuff.. The boy said he has a track
suit on liek</B>
<BR><B>a jogging suit type outfit. Not thinking anything of it she said
that they</B>
<BR><B>would look when the left to see if he was still there. When the
left the man</B>
<BR><B>was no longer there but the boy pointed to a picture in the lobby
and</B>
<BR><B>explained to the teacher that the man in the picture was the man
he saw in</B>
<BR><B>the lobby. To her surprise it was Father Leopold. Now explain to
me how a</B>
<BR><B>boy who barely speaks english knew about the story of father leopold.</B>
<BR><B>The little boy that haunts central basically stays in the gym..
No one knows</B>
<BR><B>who the boy is but he like to play with balls that are left in the
gym. A</B>
<BR><B>social studies teacher who had worked at central said that the one
night he</B>
<BR><B>was there cleaning up after a practice and he turned the lights
off and he</B>
<BR><B>saw a ball roll to him and then he rolled it back and it came right
back to</B>
<BR><B>him. It didn't hit anything to bounce off of because he saw the
ball jsut</B>
<BR><B>rolling around back and forth by thte glow of the pop machines,
that were by</B>
<BR><B>the gym doors.</B>
<BR><B>There are also some weird things like portable chalk boards that
have</B>
<BR><B>mysteriously ended up in the hall way when no one oculd have moved
them or</B>
<BR><B>securly locked windows opening before peoples eyes. if you talk
to any</B>
<BR><B>teacher that has worked at the old central or people who have attended
the</B>
<BR><B>old central, there are tons of stories.</B>
<BR><B>I jsut thought i would share some of the old central stories to
let people</B>
<BR><B>know. All alumni's and student who had a chance to attend the old
central</B>
<BR><B>know them and love them. The one thing that is missing from the
new central</B>
<BR><B>are our beloved ghosts, hopefully we get some!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Let Me Sleep</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: judydroberts@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi - I saw your site and thought..why not tell my story..no one else
believes me and I can assure you - this is real and very disturbing to
me...it happens in my own home.&nbsp; I have lived in my home now for 18
years (Forest Hills Victoria Australia) and I absolutely love my home.&nbsp;
The only thing is I cant sleep in the spare room - I have tried so many
times.but I end up fleeing in fright!! You see it started years ago. My
husband is a chronic snorer (god bless him) and Ifind it hard to sleep
with him some times because he is so loud.&nbsp; Years ago I decided to
sleep in the spare room - I did it up and put in a spare bed for me.&nbsp;
The first nite I went into the room and put my head on the pillow...about
5 mins later..I felt a very cold breeze that went right up my spine and
the hairs on my neck stood up!!&nbsp; There were no windows open and it
was a very hot nite...I let that go - but I was scared..then a little time
later I heard someone outside my window..he was laughing - it was something
like Vincent Price..only deeper - but as he laughed - there was thunder
with it...I can assure there was no storm that nite.&nbsp; I was very scared
so I ran to the living room while I calmed down.&nbsp; Maybe 6 months later
I tried to sleep in the room again..the same thing happened!! I swear I
asnt asleep..but not just the laughter and the breeze this time..my bed
started to shake...I cried out to my husband who didnt hear me ( the guy
can sleep through anything). I ran out of the room again!!&nbsp; Its been
so&nbsp; many years now and every time I go to the room to iron or change
something...I get physically ill and the room does get cold.....sorry to
go on&nbsp; - but this is my story... I cant believe that I am scared to
go into a room in my own house.</B><B></B>

<P><B>First Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: batarter@oba.uiuc.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>My first experience was 2 months after my divorce in 1994.&nbsp;
I found a small</B>
<BR><B>2 bedroom apartment for my children and I.&nbsp; On a weekend when
my kids were</B>
<BR><B>gone, I decided to go out dancing with my sister and her husband.&nbsp;
I arrived</B>
<BR><B>home around 1 AM, and within fifteen minutes was in bed.</B>
<BR><B>Lying there wondering how my children were doing, I got this sudden
feeling</B>
<BR><B>of being pushed into my mattress.&nbsp; Unable to move but not yet
afraid, I</B>
<BR><B>asked, "who is this?"</B>
<BR><B>For years I've believed in the here after and tried to understand
the</B>
<BR><B>reasons for some of the spirits being here in this astro plane.&nbsp;
So I wasn't</B>
<BR><B>really afraid.</B>
<BR><B>Again, I couldn't move, nor open my eyes until my question was answered.</B>
<BR><B>"Who do you think this is?"&nbsp; Typical male to ask a question
when answering</B>
<BR><B>one.</B>
<BR><B>In my mind my voice was responding as was the words I was hearing
him say.</B>
<BR><B>I knew in my heart some how it was my very best friend.</B>
<BR><B>He then asked "what are you doing here?"</B>
<BR><B>I responded with the truth.&nbsp; "I'm doing fine, I've filed for
divorce from my</B>
<BR><B>husband and now I'm going to live."</B>
<BR><B>It was at this time that I was able to move.&nbsp; When I opened
my eyes I</B>
<BR><B>witnessed the black smoke like appearance descending toward my ceiling.</B>
<BR><B>I jumped out of bed and ran into my living room.&nbsp; About thirty
feet away.</B>
<BR><B>ha, ha.&nbsp; I called my sister, and it was then that I realized
almost two</B>
<BR><B>hours had passed since I climbed into bed.&nbsp; We spoke and I
went back to bed.</B>
<BR><B>Not afraid but comforted in knowing he was watching over me.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening.&nbsp; I've had several others, and so I'll
send them soon.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been to the graveyard and old plantation house in question.
Let me say that the lady in white is STILL there and you will not stay
around that graveyard at night. I experienced this place by accident when
i was 14 years old. I knew nothing of the legend that surrounds this area
at the time but i can assure you that it's ALL TRUE! I have seen the lady
in white up-close and personal. I do not travel this area at night and
get a very creepy feeling even in the daytime when my travels take me through
this area.</B>
<BR><B>As a side note, my great grandmother told me that the plantation
house was used as a hospitol during the civil war and esimated that there
were at least 500 people buried around the plantation house during that
time. There is a connon ball lodged in the chimney of the old house to
this day.</B>

<BR><B>Freaky Things</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BeautifulAgony46@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This all happened when my best friend Beth and I were young, about
12. I lived in one of those old shot gun houses, that arent wide, but very
long. The house had two front rooms, and then a second room, and then the
hallway. To your right, was the bathroom...Up a little bit to your left
was a bedroom, which my family used as a storage room, and then up a little
bit more was my bedroom, adn finally the kitchen. My mother slept in the
second room, since it had two doors, one leading to the front rooms, and
then one to the hallway.</B>
<BR><B>One night when Beth was spending the night, we stayed up all night.
We were giggling, early in the morning, and we heard a terribly loud crash
in the kitchen. All of a sudden, we heard a little girls voice say very
quietly and VERY creepy, "Oops, I didnt mean to." It scared the crap out
of us. We sat there for a while, and got enough courage to go look in the
kitchen. When we got in there, nothing was broken. And I was shocked. It
sounded like everything in the kitchen had been broken. We went back in
my room and fell asleep.</B>
<BR><B>Beth left later that day, and I slept with an uneasy feeling that
whole night.</B>
<BR><B>The nexy morning, I woke up to a banging. It sounded like someone
was knocking on the door, so I got up and opened the back door, but no
one was there, and the knocking had continued. I looked behind me, and
I saw the door leading to m mothers bedroom shaking violently as though
the devil had possessed the door! My mother was SURELY awake I thought.
I was frozen in my place. A few moments later, the knocking stopped. I
got the courage once again to go look and see what was causing such a ruckus.
I opened the door slowly, thinking that something might possibly jump out
at me...I looked in my mothers room...And she was fast asleep, as though
nothing had made a single peep.</B>
<BR><B>Beth and I heard several bangs and crashes after that, but we just
learned to ignore it. It wasnt so scary after a while.</B><B></B>

<P><B>House of Bad Energy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Mimilator@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>The last house that I lived in had this weird feel about it. The
previous owners had divorced and moved out swiftly, and I was convinced
my parents would do the same. Having barely fought before, they would argue
at least once in two days. Everyone disliked one another. But, having grown
up with this I thought despising your family was natural.</B>
<BR><B>I was the only person in my house to see anything whilst living
there. I remember one night waking up and seeing an old woman in rags at
the bottom of my bed. Very clich&eacute; but very real. During this time
I also saw a young child and a baby. I am quite sceptic, so am still trying
to look for answers of how they may not have been real.</B>
<BR><B>There were also weird feels about the house. I would walk into my
kitchen and feel as though I was being watched every time; even in daylight.
The weirdest thing was when I was about 13 though. My brother worked late
hours, and would come home at around one oclock am. I am a light sleeper
and so would hear him come in then turn the television on. I would then
go down to greet him, and watch some television with him for a while. I
woke up one night, and heard the familiar television sounds coming from
downstairs. I climbed out of bed to meet him and stood on my landing listening
to the sounds for a few minutes. The sounds were loud, so I walked downstairs
to tell him to keep the noise down, and I opened the door to the front
room, but it was pitch black, and the noises had stopped. Scared, I ran
to my parents room and slept in an armchair.</B>
<BR><B>We later moved out. We have barely argued since.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My mother brought my niece to visit with me because I lived two
hours away and never got to see them.&nbsp; For something to do, we went
to the local park to swing the three year old.&nbsp; As we sat there on
a park bench we were approached by an old lady.&nbsp; She was not the typical
meek old woman you might meet on a Sunday stroll.&nbsp; She was built like
a man.&nbsp; I have heard the horror stories of men dressed as old women
with a knife in their pocket.&nbsp; Anyway, she began to talk about my
niece without looking at her.&nbsp; "Oh, she's soooo beautiful," she said,
in an evil voice.&nbsp; "My brother had one jusssst like her."&nbsp; This
she said but would never look at the baby.</B>
<BR><B>It was as if my niece were not there at all.</B>
<BR><B>My mother and I noticed that the park became secluded.&nbsp; We
got up to leave and she actually followed us to our car.&nbsp; My mother
held the baby and she stayed right at my back.&nbsp; It was truely dissconcerting.&nbsp;
It was even worse when, from behind, I felt her put me in a bear hug.&nbsp;
The whole thing felt surreal.&nbsp; I turned around and drew my fist back
at the same time.&nbsp; She simply smiled as if I had only shook hands
with her.&nbsp; I lowered my fist and started toward the car again.&nbsp;
As we were getting in the car another couple pulled up with a small infant
and as they started toward the park the old lady went for them as if we
had never been there.</B>
<BR><B>NOW for the freaky part.&nbsp; Mom and I had a strange feeling about
it all that night.&nbsp; We both had nightmares.&nbsp; The NEXT day a friend
called from my home town and said, "where have you been!!&nbsp; I called
you four times yesterday and some mean old woman kept answering."</B><B></B>

girlfriend, Debbie.&nbsp; We rented the truck, and moved, packed the belongings,
and both of us drove the 5 hours to Oneonta.&nbsp; Needless to say, it
was a long day.&nbsp; There were other people to help carry and move, but
we were up early and did all the driving. Needless to say we were tired
that night.</B>
<BR><B>Mary had rented the up stairs of an old (very old) building.&nbsp;
It had a one-flight walk up.&nbsp; It was a regular setup, and had two
bedrooms.&nbsp; One strange item it had was a long (10 foot long) shared
closet between the two bedrooms.&nbsp; One strange thing happened as we
were moving the stuff in to the place.&nbsp; We had to put an air conditioner
in the attic.&nbsp; I turned on the light, went up there, and looked around.&nbsp;
I went back down stairs and shut off the light, leaving the door open.&nbsp;
I went to get my brother Pete to carry the machine with me.&nbsp; When
we got back to the door to the upstairs it was closed and the light was
on.&nbsp; The door was shut so tight that we had a hard time opening it.&nbsp;
There were other people in the place, so it didnt strike me a funny except
that we didnt see anyone in that room at the time.&nbsp; The time frame
was very short, only a minute or two.&nbsp; We went about our business.</B>
<BR><B>That night we all went out for dinner.&nbsp; After dinner everyone
decided to go out for drinks.&nbsp; Frank and I decided to go back to the
apartment and hit the hay.&nbsp; We walked from down town back to the apartment.&nbsp;
As we walked to the apartment, from a block away we saw the outside door
light flickering on and off.&nbsp; We quickly decided that it must be a
loose wire or that the controls could be down stairs in the second half
of the building.&nbsp; As we walked up the stairs we could see no need
for controls down stairs.&nbsp; At the top of the stairs there was an old
push button light switch.&nbsp; Both of us walked into my temporary bedroom
and sat down.&nbsp; As we sat and talked, we noticed a noise, click click
click.&nbsp; We got up to investigate and saw the light switch pushing
its self.&nbsp; As it did you could see the light down stairs going on,
and off.&nbsp; Mechanical malfunction?&nbsp; That must be it!</B>
<BR><B>We sat down again in the bedroom.&nbsp; Now the next occurrence
happened.&nbsp; The door at the end of that closet opened up.&nbsp; We
got up and shut it.&nbsp; It was a very tight door.&nbsp; You needed to
pull on it hard to open it.&nbsp; As we would sit down and talk, a few
minutes later it would open again, or the light switch would start clicking
again.&nbsp; We talked for an hour, or so, and decided to finally hit the
hay.&nbsp; He went into one bedroom and I into another.&nbsp; We set up
our sleeping bags on the floor and as we were getting situated, all of
a sudden, their came a crash from what we believed was the kitchen.&nbsp;
It sounded as if every dish in the place had broken all at once.&nbsp;
I yelled to Frank are you O.K.?&nbsp; He yelled back  I thought it was
you that dropped something! We came to find that each of us were still
in the bedrooms.&nbsp; We went to the kitchen and found nothing broken.&nbsp;
We went through the apartment and found nothing! Just then the light switch
started in again.</B>
<BR><B>At that point we pretty much knew what we were up against.&nbsp;
We knew it was going to be a long night.&nbsp; We went to sleep, me with
a pillow over my head.&nbsp; All night long I had the feeling as if someone
was smacking me in the face to wake me up. Its hard to explain.&nbsp;
Not a physical feeling, but a mental one.&nbsp; The others came back at
2-3 in the morning, crocked, and went to sleep.&nbsp; I heard the crash
again in the early morning, but no one else got up.&nbsp; Mary claimed
to have a few incidents in the apartment, but nothing a strong as that
night. She also claimed that her cat would often see something and rise
its back for no reason.&nbsp; I guess this ghost just didnt like change!&nbsp;
Needless to say, I never went to visit Mary at college!</B>

<P><B>By: bustingthugs@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My family and I moved into a old rent house in the early 's</B>
<BR><B>1980's and adjacent to our house was an old burned out home that
the woods had grown over and looked kind of creepy. My parents had always
told us to stay away from there since it was dangerous you know snakes
and other things like that.</B>
<BR><B>Well getting back to our house it was an older home ( wood frame
) but clean and in good condition, three bedrooms and one of the bedrooms
had been converted from a garage and had a laundry room attached to it.</B>
<BR><B>One evening while my parents were out my brother and i were there
alone and I was watching television in the living room and my brother was
asleep in the bedroom that had been converted from a garage.&nbsp; Everything
seemed fine to me until my brother came walking into the living room eyes
wide with a scared look on his face.</B>
<BR><B>He asked me who was in my bedroom ! I said no one... My brother
then walked through the house as if he was searching for someone and then
again asked me " Is one of your friends in here " I said no again... He
then told me he had awakened to see a guy dressed in 60"s era clothing
with long dirty blonde hair standing in the doorway of the laundry room
and he was stareing at him, the guy knodded his head yes, as to say " I
see you too "&nbsp; and then my brother</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;closed his eyes and opened them again and the guy had disapeared.
Well he insisted I had a friend there and we were playing games with him.
But I again told him that he was crazy and was probaby dreaming.</B>
<BR><B>A few days passed and I was ouside doing yard work and stopped to
talk with one of the next door neighbors. I told him the story about the
60's looking guy and what my brother had seen, and my neighbor turned pale
and then told me that when he was a kid he remembered that a young teenage
guy that fit that discription had burned to death in the house next to
us that the woods had grown over. I felt chill bumps rise on my skin.</B>
<BR><B>I told my parents about the incident and they were as creeped out
about it as me and my brother. Year's went bye but none of ever saw the
ghost again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>"Ghost Stories"</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dbunchy@juno.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Sorry I didn't know what the subject line should be.</B>
<BR><B>I am 16 and I live in Rockford il. I have been to Bloods point cemetary
and seen some of the stuff you listed there. Also I would like to add,
my friends and I saw a mistress of the cemetary. There is a tombstone...
I think her name is Jane. I was sitting by it last August for about 45
minutes. We have some of this on tape. We stayed there from about 11:00pm
until maybe 2:00am. As we were leaving, we were going to the gates, (there
was 7 of us by the way) and my friend Jd pointed out he saw some sort of
white floating thing. (this could be fake we aren't sure.) and he said
it came from the grave in which i was by. i had been sitting there near
the grave trying to feel energy and just seeing what would happen. and
we all saw it. we saw her walking. it was a faint image of her, but she
had long-ish hair. i don't remember what she was wearing. i didn't really
see that much. but at the same time all of us saw it without any of us
pointing it out ahead of time. i was wondering if y</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;heard of her or not? sorry i am not too specific on the name.</B>
<BR><B>theres a few other haunted places in my neighborhood. one is the
forest twin sisters which i posted. there is a creek running through there
and for as long as i can remember i have seen a ghost who we call "sarah."
last september my friend ashley and i were by the creek, and ashley saw
her. i had mentioned a ghost, but i had mentioned a lot of ghosts. and
ashley gave me details on her, and what she looked like, and it was the
same as i saw her. i know that could be coincidence but then other people
i know saw her too. we think she has a little brother named josh and it
looked like she was drowned in the creek. i had a dream about it and then
i went and looked at the place in the creek from my dream and it looked
fairly much the same with a little change over time. shes been around for
a while now. i've seen her for about 4 years and its been about a year
now since other people have seen her. it seemed though every time she came
around she would leave dead animals. I am not sure if that was her though.
it could have been another animal outside or something but there is also
a chance it was her so i am not excluding that idea.</B>
<BR><B>my friend ashleys house (i mentioned her in the above paragrapgh)
we think may be haunted. Last february 15th at her birthday party her mom
was sort of drunk. she asked me if i could see ghosts. and she was drunk
so i was kinda playing along with her. i thought she was kidding. so i
said yes. her mom asked me if there were any in their house. and i was
kidding the whole time until she asked me that cause i suddenly realized
there were. and i named them off. with fairly good details. and as i said
them ashley and her mom both agreed that those were correct. ashley and
i had never really talked about her house being haunted before which is
what surprised us all. there have been many encounters in her house. she
has 3 dogs. they are have a cage outside at night. and her cat has a cage
downstairs. i was staying at ashleys one nigh</B>
<BR><B>and we heard scratching on her door and thought the cat got out
or a dog got out. so we checked. they were all in their cages. and both
her sisters were gone. and her mom and dad were fast asleep. this had to
of been at least at 2:00am. the scratching on the door got louder and the
door started shaking a little. ashley touched the door nob to open the
door and it was really hot. which was weird cause it was still winter and
cold outside. we have never figured this out. it could have been our imaginations
but we aren't sure.</B>
<BR><B>i have many other stories. sorry for bothering. if you want to hear
more ok then.</B>

<P><B>FROM HELLISH TO HEAVENLY EXPERIENCES</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cdvr@sprint.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am relatively new to the internet and came across your website
while surfing the net. From my childhood onwards, I have always had a curious
nature and an intense interest for the unknown. This fascination moved
me to read numerous books on the paranormal in a quest to come up with
real answers.Since the beginning of my search, I have had numerous supernatural
experiences. I would probably have to write a small book to share them
all with the readers, so for the sake of brevity, I will only discuss the
more significant ones.</B>
<BR><B>My interest in the supernatural began when I was about 12 years
old. My mother was an avid reader and would often return from the library
with a handful of books on topics related to the paranormal, religion,
and E.S.P. I would often read these books and begin asking myself a lot
of questions about the true purpose of our existance. The same kinds of
questions that all people probably contemplate at some point in thier lives.
In most other respects though, I was a typical kid. There were fairly serious
family problems between my parents, however, and they eventually divorced.</B>
<BR><B>After my parents seperated, my 2 brothers and I moved from Toronto,
Ontario to a small town in New Brunswick, my mother's hometown. It was
here that I had my first unusual experience. At about the time of my 16th
birthday, my grandparents bought me a modern translation of the bible for
a birthday present. I was getting into a lot of trouble so they probably
thought that it would do me some good. They were right when I look back
on it now.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, after I got it, I went downstairs to my bedroom to begin
reading it. As God is my witness: before I finished reading the first page,
a tremendous urge to sleep came over me and I was out. Immediately afterwards,
I found myself awake again but not physically. Crouched over me was the
most horrifying creature that I had ever seen in my life. It was about
5'10" to 6' in height with the upper torso of a lean muscular man and lower
legs that resembled that of a goat's including hooves. It was of a dark
pitch red colour but also had hair on its legs, particularily around the
location of the calves. Its eyes were nothing like human eyes. Thier were
no pupils or white; only an intense, penetrating firelike essence that
could unnerve even the toughest of characters. As best as I can describe
it, there was something about its force of presence that overwhelmed me
It seemed to have the capacity to drain my strength from me. After jumping
on me while I lay there in bed, it grabbed me by the neck and began choking
me. The last thing I remembered saying within myself was "Oh God" and I
immediately woke up. It has been almost 25 years since I had that experience
but I still remember it vividly. I might add that I have had 2 other encounters
with him afterwards.</B>
<BR><B>The third encounter that I had with him was the most significant
spiritual experience that I have ever had. It happened about 7 years later
while I was living in Toronto. After riding the fence of the Christian
faith, I was at a place in my life where I had made a firm resolve to reform
my life and get serious about walking with God. After getting back from
work one night, I decided to attend a service at a local church in the
neighborhood. I came home feeling inspired and exilarated, made something
to eat and went to bed. Into the early hours of the morning, I woke up
feeling a powerful, warm, bubbly presence surrounding me like a cloud.
Before I had a chance to really take this experience in, something else
caught my attention. As I looked up at the opened bedroom entrance, I saw
something that resembled a miniature tornado coming through. It was about
3 feet in height, 2 feet in daimeter and 2 feet off the ground. It moved
through the doorway and hovered over my bed above my legs. As I was taking
this all in, I was instantly caught up in what I can only describe as an
out of body experience. At the moment that I was caught up by this powerful
benevolent presence that still surrounded me, I found myself in what seemed
like empty space standing before this tornado. The tornado immediately
dissapeared to reveal what was in it. Although I could not make out all
of his features as clearly as I had during my first 2 encounters, I immediately
recognized him as the same demon entity that I had had previous run-ins
with.</B>
<BR><B>I also realized that the reason I wasn't able to see him as clearly
was because of this awesome cloud that I recognized as God's presence surrounding
me. Over the past 40 years of my life, I have never experienced God's presence
as I did during that evening. The demon's force of presence had no effect
on me as he had during his former 2 visits and not even a hint of fear
touched me. For some reason, I found myself looking down at my body and
realized that I was dressed as a priest. I was wearing a long wine coloured
robe that went down to my feet and each of my sleeves had a purple tassel
on it. Although the demon could not affect my spirit, he had this uncanny
ability to keep me from speaking but as soon as he made a motion with his
hand to afflict me in this way, the words "God is with You" were spoken
to me by an unseen voice. The moment I acknowledged those words as true,
the entity's power was broken. I stepped forward making a sprinkling motion
with my right hand and said,"The Blood of Jesus". I can't explain why I
did that. It was almost as if the que was given to me. This entire sequence
of events happened in an identical fashion 3 times. Then as suddenly as
I found myself out of body, I found myself back in my body and awake. It
was like being transported from one plane of existance to another. Now
physically conscious and awake, the same bubbly and warm cloud of the awesome
presence of God compelled me to start laughing and I did. As I was doing
so, an audible roar filled the room coming from directly behind me. I know
that it was audible because my wife heard it and it woke her up. I knew
that it was coming from directly from behind as I layed there looking at
her while still laughing loudly because his roar caused my hair to blow
around. All I can say in closing is that if even the most skeptical of
unbelievers were to experience such things, they could not maintain an
attitude of unbelief.</B><B></B>

<P><B>All my life...</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MPgirl78@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>All my life I have been surrounded by spirits. Strange occurrences
happen around me no matter where I live.</B>
<BR><B>Some people say it's my imagination, but then how would you explain
my parents being witnesses, my husband, and my children also.</B>
<BR><B>One of the first that I remember was when we were at my Grandmother's
home visiting her on the way to Alaska. I was about 11, and in Oregon.</B>
<BR><B>I was really sick and I had woken up in the middle of the night
to a man covering me with a blanket and tucking it under the mattress.
The next morning I felt much better and had thanked my dad. He was the
only man in the house, as my Grandfather had died when my dad was young.
He stated that he hadn't tucked me in and asked my mom and grandmother
about it. They also said they had not been in my room that night.</B>
<BR><B>When I was thirteen I lived in Alaska. I crossed the street without
looking and was hit by a car. I felt hands grab my arms and throw me into
a snowbank before I could go under the car. I got up and walked away with
just bruises on the back of my knees.</B>
<BR><B>When I moved to Massachusetts I was about fourteen. We had just
moved into a house and were still unpacking. My parents went to go furniture
shopping and I was left alone. I took a shower and when I came out into
the hallway I notice my cat and dog acting strangely. The cat was hissing
and the dog was shaking and barking. They would not step into the kitchen.
As I entered the kitchen I was hit by paperwork that flew off the table
at me. I was about 3 feet away from the table, there was no one else there,
and no windows open.</B>
<BR><B>At the same house my mother, my husband and myself all saw a figure
of a tall man walking across the basement. He was dressed in clothes that
might have been worn in the mid 1800s. My mother and husband has only seen
this while I was around.</B>
<BR><B>Currently my husband and I are living in Texas due to the military.
We have this one painting of a Native American and his spirit. This painting
has been knocked off the wall violently several times, no matter how we
secured it to the wall. Doors have slammed, and the TV's have turned off
and on their own.</B>
<BR><B>This past summer I went back to Massachusetts and stayed at my parents
house they just bought. Once again my mother was amazed that strange things
happened while I was around, like lights turning on and off, the toilet
seat slamming down hard on its own when no one had been in there.</B>
<BR><B>Recently I noticed that my new digital camera has caught orbs around
myself and my two children. These pictures have been taken in Arizona after
my maternal grandfather died a few days earlier. So I started looking at
other pictures and have noticed them in pictures taken at our home.</B>
<BR><B>My children and I have both heard voices and seen things other haven't.
My children also talk to what my friends call "imaginary friends." I don't
believe that is the case.</B>
<BR><B>There are other things that I see, feel and hear everyday, but I
am so used to it that it has never bothered me. My mom has said that all
my life I have had things happen around me. My husband has never had these
experiences until he met me.</B>
<BR><B>So that's my experiences in a nut shell. I hope maybe others will
read this and know that there are others out there that share some of the
same thoughts, experiences, and feelings I have felt myself, as I hope
I can feel I am not alone either.</B>

<BR><B>The Little Boy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DeJay.Wiedrich@valero.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>In Graniteville South Carolina there is an old grave yard where a
gravestone simply says "The Little Boy."&nbsp; I did some research using
the date the little boy died which was in the late 1800s and found that
he was traveling on a train by himself and became deathly ill.&nbsp; Some
people took him off the train and he died.&nbsp; The little boy had no
identification and was too ill to speak before he died.&nbsp; We talked
to the caretaker of the cemetery about the flowers which were in front
of the grave and he just said that new flowers are always there but he
never sees anyone put them there.&nbsp; I felt very uncomfortable in that
cemetery, there are graves that date back to the 1700s.&nbsp; Supposedly
a witch was buried there after her execution.&nbsp; Very spooky place;
I be you could get some great footage there.&nbsp; It is outside of Aiken
South Carolina and near Augusta Georgia.&nbsp; I love your website!</B>

<P><B>I Have a Story on My House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: labonte_grl@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A couple years ago, we moved into the house I live in now.&nbsp;
Before us, there was a lady by the name of Edna O. She was born and raised
here, but, unfortunately, she died here. She died in our Dining room, and
we hear her sometimes.</B>
<BR><B>Once when my sister woke up in the middle of the night, she was
out in our sitting room.&nbsp; She was walking out of my room, actually
to get back to her room.&nbsp; As she turned the corner, there she seen
a figure.&nbsp; A big white blob right in front of her! She jumped back,
rubbed her eyes, and looked back. It was still there, staring at her.&nbsp;
All of a sudden, she vanished.</B>
<BR><B>Another time, is my parents had taken a picture of them, and in
the back, you could see a figure floating above them. In this figure, you
could make out arms, a face, and legs.&nbsp; She deleted the picture because
of the way it was.&nbsp; My parents smoke, but they weren't smoking at
the time.</B>
<BR><B>Another time, is when my dad was remodeling our house.&nbsp; He
was in the kitchen, and everyone else was in the Living Room.&nbsp; He
got the feeling someone was watching him, so he turned around and seen
a lady he'd never seen before just standing there watching him.&nbsp; This
happened a few more times, but the last time we seen her was when my dad
was working on our living room.&nbsp; He got that feeling again, turned
around, and seen her standing there with a mad face. He said to her calmly,
"Don't worry, I am making to where we like it. I am not going to ruin your
house." She smiled, and vanished.</B>

<P><B>I was at my house and decided to call my friend.I asked her if she
could come and spend the night. She said yes and i said that's great! When
she was over we jumped on my trampoline and talked for hours.Soon my Mom
said it was time to come in. So we did.We ate supper,brushed our teeth,and
got in bed. We were watching my T.v. and suddenly we herd this odd scratching
sound. I was at the side of the bed so I looked over the side and there
was a black basketball coming up to the side of the bed! We screamed and
Mom came in and asked us what had happened. We told her but she was like
(whatever to us) You could tell because of the look on her face. I'm still
scared to look over the side and see that ball!</B>
