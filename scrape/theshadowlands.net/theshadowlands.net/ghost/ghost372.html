<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was 4, I shared a
room with my mother. I slept in a toddler bed that was low to the ground. If I
layed on my side, I could see under her bed. One night after she turned out the
lights and got into bed, I happened to look over and see these red eyes
starring at me from under her bed! I was so scared that I could'nt move and
just continued starring at it. The eyes were close to the ground and did not
blink. I finally started to scream and cry. My mom jumped out of bed and turned
on the light. She looked under the bed and so did I. There was nothing there!
She turned out the light and got back in bed-the eyes were there again! This
happened 3 times that night, but never happened again. This is where it gets
really freaky. When my oldest daughter was 4, she was playing in her room alone
when she started screaming. I ran in and asked her what was wrong.She told me
that there were RED EYES looking at her from her toybox!!! I had never told her
what had happened to me. Well I completely flipped out and we ran from the
room. She never slept in there again. I recently asked her about this and she
told me that the eyes were looking back and forth but did not blink. Since this
was a different house, I wonder if this is some kind of demon or something. When
my middle daughter was 4, she told me that angels talk to her at night. She's 5
now and it does't happen any more. My son is about to turn 4 next month and I'm
terrified of what suppernatural thing will happen to him! My only consolation
is that it should only happen while he's 4.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This is not my actual
personal experience. The house that i currently live in is exteremley old and
as alot of history. My aunt had once lived in this house before me and my
family, she had never experienced anything out of the ordinary. She had just
come back home from hospital having just given birth to her newborn daughter.
The night she had returned home she had done everything as normal and had gone
to bed. The babies cott stood across the room just at the end of her bed, she
woke in the middle of the night terrified by what she saw. A ghost with a smal
figure at its side stood looking into the cott holding a knife. My aunt at
first lay frozen in her bed not knowing what to do. She finally worked up her
courage after several minutes and ran to grab the new born baby and ran out of
the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The room in which this
occured is now my room i can honestly say i have never seen an apparition but i
have heard many things during the night. Such as when i had once heard the
banging footsteps of someone climbing the stairs. This had really frightened
me, so the next day i had asked my sister if she had heard the noises, she
replied "Yes". The weird noises continue up until this day but now we
are used to this, so we never really get scared as we had done years ago. But
just several weeks ago my sister lay in her room watching T.V, all of a sudden
a black figure emerged in the corner of the room. The figure vanished and we
have never heard or seen anything un-usual since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Sam, I have been
interested in ghost, spirits and other unexplained phenomenon for sometime.
When I was young, between the ages of 6 to about 13 I had experiences in the
house I grew up in! I am now 29 years old, but I know that something happened,
and that there are things we as people can&#8217;t explain. My story takes place in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tallahassee</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, the capital of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">, home of the Seminoles&#8230;GO NOLES! I was about 6 or 7
years old. I always heard footsteps walking down the hall of my house, and
sometime it sounded like the floor was just simply creaking, like old wood. The
creaking sound moved down the hall like footsteps though. On several incidents
I would wake up in the middle of the night, and here steps in the hall. I never
saw any apparitions, but I sure they exist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is a sleep paralysis
where you can wake up from your sleep, but not able to move. I&#8217;ve seen many
accounts of this on your web site. I personally have awoken plenty of times in
my youth, and could do nothing except look around my room. I never felt as if
someone was holding me down, but I&#8217;m 100% positive I was wide awake, and
couldn&#8217;t move. On one occasion, a Saturday morning, I awoke to the sun shining
through my window. I wasn&#8217;t scared, mainly because it was daytime, about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="10"><span style="font-family: Arial;">10am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in the morning, but I was frozen solid. I tried my
hardest to move my legs, arms, and talk, but could do nothing. In the past, I
would just lay there and in time the paralyzing feeling went away. This morning
I decided to lie in bed, and just wait. What seemed like minutes was only
seconds, when I heard whispering just above and behind my head. My bed as
against the wall, and my dresser was a foot or two away from the head of my bed
against another wall, in the corner. The whispers came from that corner. It
sounded as if two people were telling secrets just behind me. At this point I
snapped free from my frozen state and immediately jumped out of bed and dashed
into the kitchen where my mother was cooking breakfast. I know something was
there, but I was so scared I didn&#8217;t look back. I clinched my mom&#8217;s legs, and
she asked me &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; I explained to her what had happened, and she kind
of blew it off. There is no solid evidence that anything happened, but I know
what I experienced. That wasn&#8217;t the only thing to happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If you live in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">, then you have experienced a hurricane, and not the
Miami Hurricanes football team.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He-He!
(Remember I&#8217;m a Noles fan). Hurricane Kate hit </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in the mid 1980&#8217;s, around 84&#8217;, 85&#8217; or 86&#8217;. My mother
who was a single mom, was trapped at City Hall during the Hurricane. She worked
for the city, so during the bad storm, they didn&#8217;t want to let them drive in
the weather, and asked the workers to stay until the storm let up. My brother
is about 5 years older than me, so my mom called and asked him to watch out for
us until she could get home. The hurricane soon knocked the power out in the
entire neighborhood, and probably in several parts of the city. She called
again and asked my brother and I to sit in the hall, where there were no
windows or doors until the storm calmed. I, being the younger of the two brothers,
felt comfortable with my brother and soon dozed off to sleep. When I fell
asleep, my brother said he began to hear footsteps walking up and down the
hall. Sometimes the footsteps walked right passed us, he said. He also said no
matter how hard he tried to wake me, I wouldn&#8217;t wake up! So he had to endure
the steps and freaky sounds alone. He said it sounded as if 3 to 4 people were
in the hall walking around. When I woke up, city workers were outside working
on the telephone pole trying to restore electricity to the neighborhood. My
brother was curled up by the front door, almost relieved to see light, even if
it was just lights from the work truck, and light from the sparks of labor to
the transformer on the pole. At this time my brother told me about the footsteps
he heard, and how he was happy the lights might be coming back on. Other
incidents happened, but nothing really worth telling about. I just wanted to
share my story, because this site is very interesting. If anyone wants to
E-mail me, please send to bte5900hi@yahoo.com. Thanks for reading my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was about eight years
old, I was riding my bike in trails of the woods near our house. I came into
some weeded area and got off to turn around. I saw some imp like creature run
across the trail. It was a scraggly thing and stood three to four feet tall. I
am the only person I have talked to who saw this. Today there are houses where
I saw it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another weird thing that
happened happened to my friends at school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Between the Holland
Christian middle and high schools there are some woods. Some of my friends
looked into the brush and saw a pale faced man in a hood or a robe of some
sort. They said that he was holding a knife but he didn't move. He was just
squatting in some brush.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These do not seem to be
ghosts, but they are odd. I think the one at school was just some weirdo, but
the imp could be something. Today there are houses there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">hi i am not really born here
in the states but currently i live in Palmdale Ca but my experinces were from
my home country the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i have been
getting all these feelings and been seeing things but i dont want to admit it
because i come from a very religious family and they will think im delaing with
the devil or something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so here is one
of my experinces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;"> especially in the capital </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> there are a lot of gated communities where upscale
families live( i also live in one of those but not in this one). My Friend
Christine lives in one its huge with big houses but what makes this one unique
there is a beautiful park where there are huge trees and a big club house
though there are a few street lamps and its dark peopel like it because its a quiet
place to live in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">we go to school together in
college so some times she would ask me if i can give her a lift since my class
starts in 7am and it takes an hour commute to where we go to school i would
pick her up at around 5:30am (and its still dark) just to be sure we'll make
it. on that day i was singing on the top of my lung on my way to her house
which, by the way passes through the park, as i passed it a sudden chill passed
through me i just shrug it off because it 5 am maybe it was cold my windows are
up but still.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As i picked christine up she
said she has a quiz for first period if i can turn the radio down i said ok. as
we left i was minding my own business and she was reviewing her notes, i looked
up on my rear view mirror...and i saw a girl sitting in the back facing the
window she had long hair, i looked back to the road(since i was driving) at
first it did not register in my head then i felt a cold chill again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took a quick look and she was still there
in the back seat behind christine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then
i got so scared my hands we trembling and i did not want to look back again,
whats sucks is there was dreading silence i was telling my self it was just my
imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as we exited my firend's
village(gated community) and there were more lights i looked back and there was
nothing i breathed a sign of relif.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
did not dare tell my friend what happen she might think i was a loone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>suddenly she said, did you see that?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i said see what? the girl in the back? she
said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i looked at her and she said, i saw
her too dont worry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we did not talk
about it ever again but also i never gave her a lift again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">here is another one of my
experinces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">when is was in grade school
i was a new studnet in a all girl religous school. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>on the buliding i go to which was for grades
1-3 there was only one rest room and it was always full.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one time i wnet in bettween classes and it
was empty, i went to do my business and all of a sudden i heard singing it was
so nice that i smiled and as i left my cubicle the singing stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i waited i wanted to know who was singing. my
cubicle was facing the only entrance and exit for the restroom so its
impossible for me not to hear foots steps, but 3 minutes passed and no one came
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was curious so i looked over all
the cubicles you know how you can look on the lower part of the door if there
is someone in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but all of it was
empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then i felt the cold chill
passing through me, and the singing started again with this i ran.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">when i got to the class room
my seat mate asked why do i look like i saw a ghost as a kid i did not know
better so i told he she laughed and said i had my imagination running away with
me but i know i heard it......<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">my girlfriend Liz and I
haven't been together very long, but we share a passion for ghosts and
haunting's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On our second date we went
to a couple of sites in our county that are supposed to be haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The scariest one would have to be the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jericho</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Covered Bridge</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> located in either Fallston or Jarretsville depending
on who you ask.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Liz and I drove up to
the bridge a heavy fog rolled in almost like the ones you see in the old movies
set in places like </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">London</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
weird also because Liz and I had been driving around the county for the last
two hours and we had only encountered the fog in this one place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Maryland</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> was a neutral state during the civil war but racism
ran deep here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jericho</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Covered Bridge</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> is a grim reminder of that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a well known local legend that runaway
slaves were hung from the rafters of the bridge and sometimes left there for
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lot of local people say that if
you park your car on the bridge and turn out your lights you'll be able to see
the shadows of body's that still hang there today.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we drove over the bridge we both felt a
chill and a sense of terror in the air, like the bridge had in fact been the
scene of unspeakable horrors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
one of us really wanted to leave the safety of the vehicle to take the pictures
we were so willing to take just a few minutes prior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually though we did take the pictures
and when we got them developed we found only two pictures had turned out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first you can see some kind of
disturbance in the air moving towards the rafters, and in the second one we can
definitely see an orb in the area were just a minute before the unidentified
disturbance had manifested itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
we can scan the pictures we will definitely send them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A couple of months ago i was
living in a house with my friends that had a history of strange sightings and
stories. I personally had never seen anything there but had somewhere else.
That was about to change. I was standing in the kitchen with one of my friends
and we were the only 2 people in the house at this time. The kitchen door was
slightly open and all of a sudden i heard what sounded like a gentle whisper in
my ear. As i look towards the door i saw a lady (i think) walk past the door
wearing jeans and trainers towards the front entrance of the house. At first i
thought it was my friend Laura who always used to wear jeans and trainers so i
popped my head round the corner to try and scare her but there was noone there.
I wasnt scared because it was in the middle of the day. I actually found the
experience quite exciting but also unexplainable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was a student there in
1973 (since then there has been a lot of renovation on the buildings) but when
I was attending the job corp it was pretty much the same as it was when it was
an orphanage. One night actually at 2:00 in the morning when I came back to the
dorms after babysitting, I had to walk across the campus to get to my room at
the far end of the campus, While walking down to my room all was very quiet in
the dorms but I heard like children laughter, and clanging as though the steel
swings were hitting the still bars. There were shout of glee and anger as
little children would do on a playground, this happened behind the little
chapel that was there (it is no longer) when I passed right by it it sounded so
close. I thought to myself at that time why would parents allow their children
play so late outside? I was cold and dark. I couldn't understand why they would
allow their kids out. But, the sounds came from right there behind the old
chapel, while I looked and squinted, I didn't see anybody. Meanwhile, my hair
was standing on end and I tested the wind to see if the noise was carried from
another place (noises can carry long distances) there was no wind at all. At
the time I didn't know that the Job corp use to be an ophanage until the next
morning when I was talking to my friend about hearing those children behind the
chapel this service worker told me that she used to work there as a service
worker for the ophanage. She told me the voices I heard were probably the
little children that have died of broken hearts while she had worked there. Her
faced blanched as she told me about the children that she thought were treated
cruelly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There are 2 versions of this
legend that I know, the 1st is about a construction worker that was aggravated
with a boulder that would not budge. The man stepped on the boulder and said,
"I will give my soul to the Devil if this boulder will move," by the
next day the boulder had moved and there was a imprint of a human foot and a
hoof print of the devil (?). The man was never seen again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The other version is about a
farmer that was having a terrible harvest, he said, "I would give my soul
to the Devil if I had a bountiful harvest." Indeed, the farmers harvest
was bountiful, and he made plenty of money. The farmer was quite pleased with
himself, until the day the Devil came to collect. The farmer refused to give
the Devil what he wanted and a chase ensued, they ran all around the Farmer's
land, and the chase ended when they reached a cliff. And I believe the footprints
happened when they had their final fight at that cliff edge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have heard many stories
about the Devils Footprint being haunted. My fiance told me about an occurrence
that happened when he was there with his brothers when he was about 13. He said
that his brother was contacted by a ghost, according to him, (and his brother
swears to this to this very day), he was standing in front of the church doors,
and being a rebellious young man that he was, he attempted to kick the doors
open. At the moment his foot hit the door, it swung open and knocked him off
the steps. Now, you may be thinking that there was probably someone on the
other side of the door playing a prank, but keep this in mind, the doors opened
inward, not outward. I also know someone that was there very late at night and
swears she saw hooded men walking in the edge of the woods. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I my self has had an
experience of sorts. One night a friend and I decided to go find the place. We
drove and drove and couldn't find it. When my friend was sure she had driven
too far she turned back. We figured we better wait until daylight to look for
it, so we turned on the road we thought would take us home and what did we see?
The old cemetery, and that unmistakable white church. Of course we freaked out
and my friend swerved and barely escaped going off the road. By this time we
were both feeling a unsettling feeling in our chests, now whether this was due
to some unwelcome presence or fear I am not certain ( i'm assuming the later,
however). Needless to say we didn't stop there that night, the next day
however, now that was a different story altogether.....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi, I'm Bobby and I was
checking out your website and I decided i should send in my story. We live in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Grosse Pointe Shores</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">MI</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. We live right off of </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lakeshore Dr</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;">. And this happened Monday August 15, 2005 <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One day my brother named
Vince was on the computer at about 4 o'clock when he heard a scream. He ran
upstairs to find me and my other brother named Sam. Vince asked what was wrong
and we asked him what he was talking about and he said he heard a scream and we
said nobody screamed. we were also the only ones in the house. We got scared
but eventually thought that Vince probably was hearing things and forgot about
it. But a week later me and Sam saw a this website<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and decided to check if something was
haunting our house. We checked everywhere but found nothing. But just as we
were about to give up Sam said to me that we never checked the attic. This was
the first time that anyone was up in the attic in a very long time. We got to
the attic door and opened up the hatch and a ladder came unfolded from on top
of the door. we started climbing up the ladder and got to the attic and it was
all dark. i felt the wall right behind me and found and light switch. i flipped
the switch and a dim light turned on and right below it the was a old rocking
chair rocking back and forth and we were freaked out. after about 2 seconds we
heard a scream so loud that it knocked me backward against Sam. we climbed as
fast as we could down the ladder and shut the attic door. We were so scared
that we didn't tell anybody except Vince about what happened.We checked the
time and is was exactly 4:06. We now know that Vince heard the scream from the
attic a week earlier. All we know about the people that lived here before us is
that they were the Andersons and that they were an old couple that lived here
and raised his kids here. after all the kids moved out and Mrs.Anderson died. a
short while after that he sold his house to us about 4 years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was a freshman in
high school my parents moved us from the city in </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Central New York</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to a big, empty house in the country. Little did we
know that the house was haunted. So many strange things happened there that
even my skeptical dad began to believe that we were sharing the house with
someone or something else. My best ghost encounter occurred in the middle of
the day. I walked into the bathroom and saw from the corner of my eye, someone
that I thought was my youngest sister. I said "Hi Laurie", but she
didn't answer me. Annoyed, I turned to find out what her problem was, only to
realize that it wasn't her at the sink. An old woman with grey hair up in a
bun, a pink flowered dress and a white apron was drying her hands. She turned
to look at me and then she disappeared! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We weren't often frightened
of the ghosts and missed them when things seemed to be quiet for too long. We
would lament that they didn't like us anymore. One day, I was alone in the
house and I went into the shower. All of a sudden there was a huge noise! I
thougt a plane hit the house..... or at least there was a terrible car accident
outside. I jumped out, grabbed my robe and went to investigate. I found nothing
out of order at all, so I got back in the shower. Not two minutes later, I
heard that huge noise again. I jumped out, shaking this time and checked
everywhere, but again there was nothing to find. I decided to skip my shower!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had a ghostly nightmare
about this house before even moving in. My family moved into the house and from
day one things were creepy. People before had moved out in a hurry and their
family broke apart almost instantly in four months. They all spread to four
different places. When we moved in, we all got terribly sick within the first
month. My mom had a life threatening experience; my sister ran away, all the
pets in the house died mysteriously with no known cause of death, my parents
divorced. All of this happened in only four months! I walked into the house
after school one day, and I heard my name being called. I knew no one was home
because none of the cars were in the driveway. The voice calling my name
sounded exactly like my mother, and I looked all around for her, even though I
knew that she was presently in the hospital. Within the next few days and a few
wors creepy, paranormal events, all four of us left in just as much of a hurry
as the ones before us, leaving most of our personal belongings. We all split,
each of us in a different car, to different places away from each other and
away from the house. I will never go back to see it, nor would I wish the
haunting of this house on anyone else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello. I lived at this house
from 97 to 99. My family, and many of my friends were witnesses to the
occurences. Voices, electronics malfunctioning, dark figures. It happened day
and night, but mostly at night. It is an older white home, near the river, and
for a while we had a rat problem. The plumbers had left a hole under the
bathroom sink. The rats, who are fond of shiny objects, left two human molars,
complete with silver fillings, on the bathroom floor on two seperate occasions.
The back of the home had a foul odor off and on, and the crawl space had been
cemented over. I am an investigator for the state, not a hysteric, but this
place made a beleiver of me, my family and a half a dozen friends. My then four
year old son complained of "the man in the mirror, with a string around
his neck". Voices were male and female. Also a small child. I have often
felt the crawl space needed to be examined; just never could figure out a way
to ask the officials to do such. I truelly think there is a body or bodies
under that house. Myself and a girlfriend watched as a man shaped shadow moved
across the dining room wall, into the kitchen, where the light turned on. Well
worth checking out, if you can get the new owners permission. E-mail if you
have questions. Rebecca<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had an experience when I
was a kid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking back on it I'm not
really sure if what I saw was real or just a dream, all I know is that either
way it scared the hell out of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
grandparents lived in a three story house in </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Maryland</span></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">, about 20 minutes from the </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Washington</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">DC</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the back of the house the basement was level with the yard which sloped down
sharply at the back of the property and turn into a sort of rolling hill that
ended at the back yard of another house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We don't know who did it but at some point someone had put in wooden
steps all the way down the hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember that wild strawberries would grow all over the hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my cousins and I were staying at my
grandparents one weekend and were sleeping in a top story bedroom with a window
facing the back of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
middle of the night I suddenly woke up, I don't know why but I had this
compulsion to look out the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried to go back to sleep but the feeling just persisted and I started to feel
like my skin was tightening or something.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got out of bed and went to the window and my eyes were immediately
drawn to something on the hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It as a
lady.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was wearing a flowing white
gown that was billowing around her from a breeze that was not moving any of the
tree branches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think she had blond
hair because she was just slightly luminous all over, she actually seemed kind
of fuzzy but not transparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
still but then began to move up the hill at a walking pace and although I
couldn't make out her facial features I felt that she was looking up at the
window at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could've been a real
person but I think not....I felt not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly she stopped and whipped her head to the side, I suddenly felt
such panic that I couldn't breathe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked from her face to the direction she was looking and now this I'm not sure
of....there seemed to be like a small green spot of light, fuzzy like her, real
indistinct, couldn't tell the shape but it seemed to be getting bigger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw the lady move and looked at her, she
was looking at me again, I know it and she started to raise her hand but I was
drawn to the green glow again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly
I realized that the green light wasn't getting bigger at all but coming up the
hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as this realization hit me
it sped up so fast, coming straight at the window that I fell back and away
sobbing....the green object suddenly appeared in the window and it was a face,
very angry, very terrible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had woken
my cousin from falling over her on the floor and from my sobbing...I grabbed
her hand a pulled her out of the room to the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pulled me to a stop half way down the
stairs and wouldn't let me go no matter how much I begged her to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>made me sit on the steps and closed the door at the top of the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember feeling like my heart
was going to burst, it was beating so hard and fast and I was having trouble
breathing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought I saw a green glow
at the crack at the bottom of the door out of the corner of my eye and as I
turned my head more towards he door it wasn't there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my cousin everything, she saw and felt
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't sleep the rest of
the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandparents slept on the
second floor and we didn't seem to of woken them up and I didn't tell
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will never forget what happened
and it never happened again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt that
the lady on the hill was benevolent and the face was evil....it's funny but the
face kinda reminded me of the comic book version of the Incredible Hulk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I think I was just dreaming but I
have never had a dream that caused such a physical or emotional reaction as
that, in fact I usually don't remember my dreams at all....makes me wonder
though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My Mom and I made a promise
to each other. The one who dies first had to show the other guy they are all
right, somehow. we both agreed. We did this because she worried about me out
late at night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When she got her second
battle of cancer, they told her anything they could do would be an extension of
life. I helped her take care of her self. she was tough, it took the cancer two
years to take her. I didn't work for those years, so I could help. It is
amazing how strong she was and funny. my Mom was the center of our family for
sure. My Dad, brother and myself only talk to Mom about anything we needed help
with or to confide in. if there is a good side to a death of someone we loved
so much, it brought the three of us closer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The night she past away, I
know she was going that night and didn't want to see her last breath leave her,
so I had a friend come over and take me out. Crying the whole time. two ten in
the morning I screamed and said she`s<span style="">&nbsp; </span>gone.
Went to the phone, the nurse said she just turned over and took her last
breath. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I got home we said good
bye. the funeral man came and picked her up. then we all sat around the kitchen
table. about five in the morning the cordless phone rang but not the other
phones in the house. this phone was the phone my Mom would use because being
portable. the message was a recording that said you have dialed a number on
your own line. please hang up a let the other party answer. in my town you can
phone another person in the house by dialing the house number then hanging up.
that's the way you hear that message. knowing nobody dialed the phone in the
house, i said it was Mom. then a few minutes later it did this three or four
more times. i think my dad was a little spooked because he put the phone on the
base. sorry I didn't tell you this phone only did this when off the base and
never did this before my Mom died. the phone did this for about two weeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My best friend was at my
house. The cordless phone was in the basement with us. the phone rang and the
message came on. I told my friend I can prove this is my Mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went upstairs ask my dad if the phone rang,
he said no and quit fooling around. Then I asked my friend what number should
the phone dial. she replied my home. We pressed redial it dialed her house.
when we called my house to hear the message then hung up. Then redialed the
phone dialed my house. she was so scared she left that moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since then I feel she is
with me when I need her. There was the time I went to the doctors and said your
coming with me Mom. I wore her diamonds in a necklace. after getting blood
taken. The little girl that took it said good bye little chicly. My hole life I
never hear anybody refer to anybody as little chicky other then my Mom. I
smiled and left to go home. when I get in the car country music station came on
and said Norma Jean dada dada da. Sorry can `t remember the song after I hear
my Mom `s name . I feel it was her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">recently i was at my uncle
Jerry's home he `s my Mom `s youngest brother. my husband and i were sleeping
in the back part of their trailer summer place. around six in the morning i
woke up looked over to the door where i thought was my aunt </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lynn</span></st1:City></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> was standing and smiling at me. i told her this is
to early to get up. i `m a very light sleeper. i was awaken by husband getting
up at seven. when i got up i told my uncle i need to tell my aunt sorry for not
getting up. uncle Jerry said aunt </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lynn</span></st1:City></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> wouldn't come in the room. i said i was sure she
did. so when my aunt got up i asked her she said no. they joked with me and
said it was my Mom because she liked being at the trailer. and we were talking
about her the night before. i `m not sure it was Mom but i know i saw a person
standing there smiling at me. so here `s my ghost story. thank you for listening
I've felt comforted that i feel she `s around. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had just taken a shower. I
stood in the bathroom with my towel and was getting myself ready. I get out
from the bathroom and i&acute;m one hundred percent sure that I left the bathroom
door wide open. I enter my bedroom and put on some clothes. When I return to
the bathroom to leave the towel I notice that the door is closed. And on top of
that, it&acute;s locked!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I begin to get all nervous,
I mean is it someone in my apartment. I try to open the door but I can&acute;t. I
continue to try to open the door with various tools but it&acute;s stuck. Really,
really stuck. I called the landlord to see if he can come up with a solution
but he was busy so he said he&acute;s gonna come over the following morning. I go to
sleep with thousands of thought on how the door was locked. When I wake up in
the morning to get some breakfast I freak out. The door is open. Wideopen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I grew up near </span><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Greeley</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Colorado</span></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in a small farming town east of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Greeley</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">. It's name is Kersey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">You called the a river that
runs through the eastern part of </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Colorado</span></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> the </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">South</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Plate</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">River</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;"> it is actually called the </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">South Platte River</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This area around the </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">South Platte river</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> has several ghost stories that I heard of while
growing up as a teenager and into my early to mid twenty's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was the story of the
" Arona". Se is said to be a Mexican witch who killed supposedly
killed several of her babies and put their bodies in a gunny sack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She then threw the sack into
the </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">South Platte River</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The story goes that if you
go to the Kersey bridge -( the bridge that crosses the </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">South Platte River</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> just north of Kersey) and go at midnight. You must
count the the spacings as if you were on a railroad track and count to five or
ten and turn around you will see the arona. She will haunt you until she gets
your soul to makeup for the lost souls of her children that she murdered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next ghost story is
about a pair of phantom headlights. These headlights speed up when you speed up
and slow down when you slow down. If you stop all the sudden they will disappear
completely. These headlights are on a road known as the Keensburg cutoff to the
locals. I'm glad to say that I've never experienced them but I know of at least
1 person who experienced it first hand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I hope that I have given you
some insight to the area. If you want to contact me you can email or call me at
(360) 931-5754. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hope to hear from you soon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Around 1973-4 my ex-husband
and I lived in a farmhouse just outside of </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Pardeeville</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wi</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
forgotten the name of the road, but there are a few houses and it ends at a
lake where there's a boat ramp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
memory serves me, I think there's a tree farm on the road, as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we lived there, we called the farm we
lived at "</span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Swallow</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Heights</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">" because there were so many swallows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As you travel down the road
toward the lake, the farm sits on the right-hand side of the road, up on a
hill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyway, the farm was old
when we lived there, and only partially inhabitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The upstairs was in disrepair, and since it
was only my ex-husband and myself, we didn't need the space, so we just kept
the upstairs door shut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On more than one evening, as
we sat in the front room, we would hear footsteps upstairs, as though someone
were walking around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time this
happened, we immediately went upstairs, thinking someone might have broken
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, there were no windows
broken, and they were locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
no other way upstairs other than the stairway we had just taken, and no one
could have gotten past us without our seeing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was simply no one there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, even though the floor was dirty and dusty, there were no
footprints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perplexed, we thought it
just might be our imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we
were wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One evening, we had company
from our hometown who had stopped to see us on the way back from </span><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Madison</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">La
  Crosse</span></st1:City></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were sitting in the front room, we
could hear the footsteps upstairs, then heard them coming down the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could hear the stairway door open and shut<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(but could not actually "see" it),
heard the footsteps cross the kitchen floor, go down the hallway, and heard the
back door open and shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to
say, our guests were pretty freaked out, and never returned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By that time, we had become
accustomed to hearing the footsteps upstairs, and we jokingly referred to our
house as "haunted".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never
saw anything, but many times when I was alone I felt I was being
"watched", and eventually I became afraid to stay in the house alone,
although as I said, I never saw anything supernatural, only heard it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the time we lived there,
several other people other than my ex-husband and myself heard those footsteps
upstairs, and usually, their descent down the stairs, across the kitchen, and
out the back door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It's too bad that websites
like this didn't exist then!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: Broke2012PE@aol.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Several years ago, I was just
a sophomore in college. Instead of doing the whole campus living thing, myself
and a two friends decided to get a townhouse off campus together. Before we
moved in, we knew the complex we were moving into was the location of a very
famous kidnapping/murder of a little girl, but didn't think anything of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We moved in, living there
for a little less than a year with no incident. One night in August I was
sleeping in my room. I had the luxury of having my own room while my two
friends shared the other room. At about 4 a.m. I was quickly awaken by a sharp
pain at my forehead. It felt as though someone had punched me as hard as they
could. I shot up in bed and immediately thought it was one of my roommates
drunk, just messing around with me. I was wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I looked around the room and
at the foot of my bed stood a dark figure which I can best describe as having
long blonde hair, no face and a long black trenchcoat. The figure stood there
looking at me, then turned and disappeared into my closet. Completely frozen
from fear, I sat in that same position for what seemed like an eternity. As if
that wasn't strange enough, I have terrible vision when I don't have my
contacts in or glasses on, and I obviously don't sleep with vision aides. The
figure was very clear and apparent as if I had my contact lenses in while
everything in the background was blurry as normal. When I was finally able to
move to get out of the room, I went into the bathroom to look at my head. I had
a welt the size of a golf ball forming where I had been hit. There was no going
back to sleep. I had to be at work by 5:30 a.m. anyways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The welt stuck around until
10 in the morning or so, but when I checked it afterward, it had completely
disappeared. To this day, I still don't have an explanation. I may have passed
it off as a dream that just seemed to be real if not for the very real swelling
and pain on my forehead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Several days after the
incident, my roommates became witnesses to other strange events around the
townhouse. We would hear the sound of a little girl laughing upstairs, but when
we would go check it out, the sound would move downstairs. There were also
several incidents of the oven being turned on with no one around. I moved out
when the lease was up, but one of my former roommates still lives there and
says weird things still happen. But none as bad as what I experienced in my
bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">hello everyone. this story
happened to me when i was about 13- 14. i live on a small farm in </span><st1:place><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">new mexico</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. i guess you could call it more of a petting zoo
rather than a farm. we have dogs and cats, but we have more horses than
anything else. well anyway, my first horse, Abby, was the cutest little(and
fattest) pony that you ever saw. we had her until i was around 9, and then she
got so old and blind that she couldn't eat and the other horses just treated
her awful. so we eventually had to put her down and the was one of the most
horrible things thats ever been done to me. so, anyway, here i was, horseless,
and with a giant ride coming up the next week, so my mom, (unable to find a
horse in that short span of time), very reluctantly let me ride savanna, a very
sweet, but very high-spirited palomino tennesee walker horse. only my much
older sisters had ever been able to ride her, but as soon as i got on, we
clicked beautifully and we were a pair from that day forth. about 4 years went
by and savanna got horribly sick with an illness called Bastard strangles. its
a nasty illness that causes the animals throat to fill up with a nasty pus-like
fluid. we thought she was getting better so we let her out into the arena while
we were gone. my sister got home first and found her dead in the arena. they
already had her buried by the time i got home, which was good.and i soon got
another horse (a devil pony by the name of barbie). about a month after savanna
died my sisters and i were out riding and playing a game called butt tag when
each and every one of us distinctly saw savanna running with us. all the other
horses were put up and we all recognized her by her signiture stop, which would
throw any unexperienced rider off. we looked for her again but we couldnt see
her but as we were running around my sister ran through an icy cold spot ( it
was about 85 everywhere else) of course all of us had to go see for
ourselvesand sure enough it was cold there. we were all happy because we felt
as is savanna was trying to tell us that she was okay. we could feel her every
once in a while, and still to this day (about 3 years later)we can still see
her running across the propertyand we can sense abby and the other animals are
out there following behind her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had an experience (more
than one now but different ways) but this one just still freaks me out no
matter how I try to forget it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took
place towards the end of the year in 2004.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was leaving for work like normal backing out of the driveway looking
to make sure no one was walking on the sidewalk, like children or old folk
since they love to walk early in the morning where I live.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I don't go and peel out of the driveway
so it takes me a few seconds to back out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did like I normally do, looking, watching, so as I was like maybe 2
feet away from the sidewalk area, I looked to my left and I stopped the truck
fast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was this man standing there
with his hands in his pockets, wearing a leather jacket(waist length), thick
tinted glasses, something like you would have seen a man wear in the 1970's
(disco era).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wore also some
bell-bottom type pants and I kind of made a comment to myself about where the
hell he came from with that outfit, the 70's are gone, man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">He stopped walking which
seem to he did so I looked right at him and he gave me this movement of his
head as to say, "go ahead", so I did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thinking to myself as I past my truck from him thinking where did he
come from?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't live next door (I
know the neighbors on both sides of me) and I didn't see him 4 seconds
ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was now in the street ready to
drive away and he kept on looking at me as though he was commenting on me and
how I don't pay attention driving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked at him one more time, getting a good visual of him, and looking back a
few seconds later he wasn't there or even down the street and I was thinking I
can tell my husband what happened when I get home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well that never took place until maybe a week
later when I finally told him because I was afraid after all that
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later that day I was at work
as so was my husband at his job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
called me very sad on the phone and told me that his sister called to tell him
that his dad died the night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
left work to be with him and see if I could help with anything, and I didn't
know what was going to happen next.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Couple of days later we went for the viewing and I walked up to the
casket with my husband and I almost fell in disbelief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man I saw that morning was his dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never had a chance to meet his dad since he
and my husband were not on speaking terms after he left his family for another
and my husband was left as a teenager to find work to help his mom keep their
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I waited a couple of days later
and I told my husband as to what happened that morning and described to him
what I saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left the room and came
back with a photo album of his mom's and showed me this picture of when his dad
was young and I almost lost footing again because the picture he showed me
which I never seen before was the exact clothes this man wore that
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then told my husband that
maybe his dad is coming home for the last time, somewhere he loved to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">hello, this experience
happened to my mom, but its been told to me so many times over the years that i
can probably tell it just as well as her. here goes- my mom has 4 brothers and
sisters and when they were little they lived in a tiny house down the road from
my great-granny and grampa. they lived in a pretty nice neighbor hood full of
old looky loo couples. anyway, the whole family was going to a very important
dinner for my grandad, so all of the kids would have to take showers and get
ready. my mom, around 15 at the time had gotten home late and wouldn't have had
time to wait for the others and still get dressed in time, so my grandma told
her to go ahead and go down to my granny's and get ready there. (by the way, my
granny and grampa were on vacation in texas and weren't home), so my moms'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>down there taking a bath, when it suddenly
dawns on here that she's hearing talking, laughter, and dishes clanking loudly
in the kitchen, but nobody's there with her. (the house had,we believe, 2
resident ghosts living there already and they had never done any thing to
anybody). so my mom, having never liked the ghosts like everyone else, calmly
steps out of the tup and steps up on the toilet to get to the towels over
head,( my great grandpa being extremly tall and my granny being extremly short
as with all the females in the family. this was just somthing the women did to
reach the towels easier), when something icy cold reaches out and forcefully
lays its hand on my moms shoulder and pulles her down off the toilet. my mom,
by this time she is kind of panicky , well lets make that REALLY panicky, runs
butt naked all the way home and would never go in that house alone again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">this definitaly wasnt the
fist encounter, but several years later, after granny and grampa had both died,
my uncle was alone there asleep in my grandpa's room when he woke up and saw my
grandpa just staring at him ( my family gets really freaked out when somebodys
staring at them while their asleep and i'm the same way)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was really little when my granny died and
never did meet my grandpa, but i had to go in that house and get some suff for
my mom,(me being the only one able to get through the bathroom window because
the house was locked and the only other person that had a key lived about 600
miles away) and i,young though i was, instantly felt all kinds of energy in
that house. i wish i had been able to find out some of the history on that
house but no one alive really knows anything about it. bummer!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It looked like a normal
little park for young children but on one late afternoon in Febuary my thoughts
for this place changed. It was a cold day and snow covered the ground and I was
over my girlfriends house and we started to get bored so we went to the park
down the street abit to play hide and seek.(We are 15 and 16 at this
time...it's pathetic) and we got down there and not one person there. From the second
we got there I had a weird feeling and that is strange because i have been at
this park since i was a little boy. We started to play and everything was going
good but I was still a little uneasy there but I kept playing. To explain how
the park looks, it looks like a castle with slides and picnic tables.I was it
and I was counting by a railing and I peeked for a second and I saw something
in the corner of my eye running in the other direction. I finished counting and
I walked in that direction and all I saw was a little kids swing swinging
rappidly back and fuorth. I told my girlfriend to get over here and I asked her
if she hit that swing. She said she didn't, she said she didn't come over in
this direction. I stoped the swing and we kept playing. Now it was her turn and
I was on the other side of the park and I could see her as she was counting.
When she finished she went in the direction of the swing that was swinging and
all of a sudden she yelled for me. I ran over and when I got there the word push
was writing in the snow in front of the swing I stoped. Then we started to get
really scared. But we kept playing for some reason. I was counting and before I
was done my girlfriend was screaming and crying and she kept asking if i was
walking on the bridge above were she was hiding I said no and ran torwards her
and told her to get out. She t d me someone was walking up there and when I
looked up there there was nothing there. What i saw earlier out of the corner
of my eye was a girl a little girl. Also some friends say they have seen a man
with a muscit walking around there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i have recently gone to the
Grosse Ile Wildlife Sanctuary in </span><st1:place><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Michigan</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. now THAT was a very creepy experiance! it was late
at night, so the gates to the trail were closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">when i saw that i decided to
just sit in my car in front of the gates just to see what will happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">it was me and my firends
steph, megan, and amanda. we sat looking into the path for about 5 minuits
before i noticed a very strange looking blue light flashing in one of the trees
ahead of me. i didnt think much of it, until i accidently flashed my brights on
into the woods when i turned to talk to megan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">thats when things got REALLY
weird.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i looked back and the blue
light seemed to float down from the trees, then turning an orangeish/yellow, it
seemed to come closer to my car, then it suddenly dissapeared. i was sitting
thinking "wtf was that all about."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">then within like one minuite
the car seemed to get really hot, and the car windows started to steam
up.(three of the windows were rolled down and there was a nice cool breeze
outside).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">we heard something in the
back of my car, so we look back, and we saw what looked like a hand mark on the
inside of my back window, and it started to streak down the window, as if
someone was trying to like claw at my back window from the inside. when we
left, the steam left the windows, but the hand prints were still there on the
back window, and i know that when i left there was nothing there, i just
cleaned the inside of my car. the marks are very very obvious, i will try to
get a good picture of them and send them straight to you<o:p></o:p></span></p>

though i took a high powered torch with me i could not see anyone . I have
spoken to other people who have also had strange experiences there .I have
heard of a story that says that someone was killed whille on the track although
i have not been able to discover if there is any truth behind the story. All I
do know is that up until i had my experience there iwas not too bothered about
working there on nights now i am not too keen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

arround well my dad and my Uncle Ron went in the truck to drop Kenny and my
Uncle Bob off at this really big tombstone ,and they set a tape recorder next
to the tomb stone to see if they could hear anything. Well about 30 seconds my
dad and uncle came by the tombstone to pick them up. They got in the trunck and
they went to McDonalds to get something to eat then they went to Wal Mart to
get somethings and when they left Wal Mart they went back to the cemetary to
get the tape. Well as soon as the got the tape out the played it in the truck. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi my name is Cassdiy. I
just wanted to share this horrible experience with you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When i was eleven or twelve,
i went to visit my aunt Rose in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">. She had just moved into a new house, and was now
living alone after recently devorcing my uncle Jeff. At first I thought the
hose looked like something from a movie. It had a beautiful wrap around pourch,
rustic shutters, and a pretty, white cathidral in the front yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mother was going to stay
one night but the next day she planned to return home to </span><st1:place><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">washington</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. Altough i was farely young, i didnt think i would
get home sick or scared without my mother. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A few days into the week,
Rose decided to start unpacking her antiques, and photo albums. Half way
through unpacking, i spotted an eerie, yet pretty porcline doll.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She had long black eyelashes,
pink glossy lips, sharp green eyes, and brown, pin curled hair. "What's
this aunt rose?" I asked. She looked at the doll, and a very uneasy almost
startled expression crossed my aunts face. "Honey, put her down", she
shakily said. I could sense that my aunt had no likings for the doll, so i just
set her off to the side of the boxes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In about an hour I had
completley forgotten about the doll. That night as I lay in bed, it dawned on
me that i never really had put the doll away. Then a shock of fear ran through
,y body, as if the doll could read my very thoughts. I was so scared that i
couldn't sleep for the next two nights. Finally i got up the courage to ask my
aunt rose about the doll. "Why dont you like that doll Aunt rose?" I
asked. She just gave me this terrified look as if she was about to say,
"she can hear you." Later that day i found the doll sitting on the
mantel of my Aunts fire place. My first thought was that my aunt had put her up
there. But just the way the doll was sitting had made her look unnatural,
almost alive. That night i decided to keep my bedroom door cracked just in case
i needed to call for my aunt. Late into the night i herd little pitter
pattering all over the hall way. Like a tiny little girl running around the
house. I turned over in my bed just far enough to see straight into the hallway
from the cracked door. There, as quick as a flash i saw the doll run by my
bedroom door. I COULDNT BELIVE MY EYES! I was so scared that she had seen me
awake that i closed my eyes tight untill i herd her go back downstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That was the last time i
have ever encountered that doll. I hope it stays that way too. Still to this
day my Aunt will not say a word about that doll.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My house is one of the
oldest houses In my town. I don't know if the previous owners of that house
messed with a Ouija board or if some people died in that house. Ever science we
moved in there has been some weird stuff going on. I was about 5 when it all
started. The first thing that happened was when we (my family) got setteled in
I was sleeping in my room when I heard laughing in my room. I looked up on the
top bunk where my sister slept thinking that maby she was laughing but she was
sound asleep. About 30min later I herd a loud crash comeing from my little
brothers room I went down the stairs to find my little brother crying I looked
behind me to see my brother's hot weel moving across his dresser like somebody
was pushing it! Well a few days passed with nothig happoning until January
2nd,1996 when we were all eating dinner me and my dad saw a shaddow going down
the hall. Nobody was home but my dad and me. A few years have pased and nothing
but the usual has been happening until this year! One night I was sleeping in
my room when I got realy cold (and this was in June) I sat up and looked behind
me and I saw a young boy who looked like he was a young farmer. He was standing
at the end of my bed liiking down at me! I shut my eyes real tight and then
opened them again and he was still there I then just shut my eyes and went to
sleep. I am now 15 and I have been seeing ghost science I was 2. I still see
ghost but I see them as people with unfinished work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was eleven years old,
at about three o clock in the morning I woke up to hear the sound of my dad
plowing our driveway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He soon left for
work, and I couldn't fall back asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After all was quiet I got out of my bunk bed and climbed down my stairs
and walked<span style="">&nbsp; </span>into the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to the bathroom and then back to my
room. I climbed into bed and crawled over toward my pillow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that I turned around and was
about to pull my blankets over me when I noticed two bright green lights in the
corner of my room directly in front of me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were glowing and hovering in the same spot I just walked
through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was confused and tried to
think of all the possible things they could be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Smoke alarm light?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Glow in the
dark plastic stars?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anything!? I started
to get more scared as the time passed because i tried to eliminate the fact
that it could be a spirit. I tried to figure out if it was my eyes playing
tricks on me...perhaps i saw the lights from a clock and my eyes just needed to
adjust to the darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I d n't turn any
lights on while I got up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I blinked my
eyes in a different spot on my wall and tried to see if the lights would follow
my eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point I looked back to the spot and
there they were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so scared. They
were eyes, and they were staring at me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was so scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't move at all I was laying down
resting on my elbows just staring at them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They moved foward a foot or so, very slowly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they moved back and just as slowly
vanished to the left through my wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was so scared they would come back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When i was five my family
had just built this new house in a new neighborhood about seven miles out of
town on what had used to be a farm in which the family was killed when there house
caught fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as we moved in
weird things began to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doors
would open and close by themselves and lights would flicker. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then about a year later is
when i started seeing the figures.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During construction my parents had only enough money for the house and
my mom had planned for a deck outside of our living room, so she had french
doors put in, but there was no deck yet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night i was alone with my brother who was studying in his room and i
decided to watch some t.v.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As i was
watching i glanced outside the french doors and there was this figure of a
little boy looking in at me now i knew it wasn't a joke because there is a six
foot drop outside of the door.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
would also wake up in the middle of the night and see the figure watching me
from my door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also lights would then
flash through my window which was strange because my bedroom was in the back of
the house on the second floor facing the cornfields.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little later my family was painting the
basement rec room and we all heard a loud voice saying "get
out."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was soon after that we had
to move out and it was one of my friends who had bought the house and he still
reports strange things happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">when I was younger about 12
or so I used to see things all the time. I always thought that maybe I was some
how making it all up and Im still not sure to this day if it truly was my
imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day I had some friends
over and it was late at night. We were all watching this movie and I was
sitting on a small couch by myself when all of a sudden in the middle of the
movie I decided to just turn around and face behinde the couch. As I did this a
very strongly visible little boy clouded in a blueish smoke and old gown walked
right past the couch and through the wall/window that led to the front of the
house outside. I sat there looking at it wondering how I could be seeing these
things. I was psyched so I turned back around and told everyone what i just saw
but everyone thought i was joking. Also I used to see this very large shadow
figure that hovered around the house everywhere. I was afraid of it but I never
thought it was evil exactly. Well after a while of seeing these weird things I
told my parents.. they both believed me right away. My father is a strong
chirsitan and he told me that the ability to see and do gifted things runs in
his family. My grandpa and him both had some of an ability. Well right after i
told them they left to go on about their day. Once they had left the living
room I turned to look out side but was blocked because a man that was very tall
was standing there. he had red eyes and a buzzed sort of hair cut but was still
long, also he was kinda of bloated and blue like he had drowned. He was stand in
front of a scene that involved a bridge and a car. as I saw this I was freaked
out but what scared me was he was looking straight ahead but suddenly looked
directly at me!! I was so scared i had ran out of there as fast as I could his
eyes following me the whole way. I had an idea that this one was something
evil. Well after a while of seeing these things i was tired of it. One day i
was walking out of my house and the shadow figured followed me but was in front
of me. I stopped and screamed Go Away!!! and since then I havent seen anything
since. I had regretted it and had wanted it all to come back but it hasnt..
except maybe recently. which Im still not sure of and it could be just me
imagining it ..but you never know. I dont want anything to hurt me or something
evil to come around .. but if i wasnt such a chicken they might still be here!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I LIVE IN </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">STATEN ISLAND</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> NY, WHICH NOTHING VERY UNUSUAL EVER HAPPENS EXCEPT
FOR YOUR REGULAR NY CRAZYNESS. LAST YEAR ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS BEST FRIENDS HAD
DIED ALONG WITH HER FAMILY (VICTIMS OF CARBONMONOXIDE POISONING). IT WAS VERY
HARD FOR EVERYONE TO GET OVER, OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS VERY TIGHT KNIT AND WE ARE
ALL CLOSE FRIENDS AND REGUARD ALL THE CHILDREN AS OUR OWN. SO WHEN THIS TRAGEDY
HAPPENED IT WAS A HARD BLOW TO ALL OF US. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">ABOUT 2 MONTHS OR SO AFTER
THE INCIDENT THE HOUSE THE FAMILY LIVED IN WAS STILL UNOCCUPIED AND COVERED IN
FLOWERS IN MEMORIAM OF THE FAMILY. BEING THAT PARKING IS SCARCE IN NY YOU
CANNOT ALWAYS PARK YOUR CAR IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN HOUSE AND MUST LOOK FOR
PARKING ELSEWHERE ON THE BLOCK, AND BEING THAT I WORK NIGHTS THE ONLY PARKING I
COULD GET WAS INFRONT OF SABORA'S HOUSE (NOBODY EVER WANTS TO PARK THERE). <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">ONE NIGHT AFTER PARKING THE
CAR IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE I WAS LOCKING UP MY CAR WHEN I THOUGHT I SAW A LITTLE
GIRL STANDING IN THE DRIVEWAY, WHEN I TURNED MY HEAD THE IMAGE WAS GONE BUT I
COULD HEAR A GIRLS LAUGHTER. IT SENT CHILLS DOWN MY SPINE BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST MY IMMAGINATION.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A FEW NIGHTS LATER WHEN COMING
HOME FROM WORK, I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE AND CLEARLY SAW SABORA IN THE WINDOW,
SMILING AND WAVING AT ME LIKE SHE WOULD USUALLY DO WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE. IT
TERRIFIED ME AND I AVOIDED THE HOUSE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THEN ONE MORE NIGHT I
WAS TRYING MY BEST TO AVOID THE HOUSE WHEN I SAW SABORA STANDING ACCROSS THE
STREET WAVING AND I HEARD HER SAY "HELLO".<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I THEN THOUGHT TO MYSELF
"I KNEW HER IN LIFE AND SHE WAS A WONDERFUL CHILD, WHY SHOULD I BE AFRAID
OF HER NOW?" I HAVE NOT SEEN HER SINCE THEN, BUT IF I DO , I'VE DECIDED TO
WAVE AND SAY "HELLO"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>AND WAVE
BACK TO HER<o:p></o:p></span></p>
