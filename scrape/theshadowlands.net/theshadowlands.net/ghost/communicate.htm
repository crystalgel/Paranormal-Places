<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A question that often
is asked in Shadowlands email is "How Do I Talk to Ghost? I want to contact
them."</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">I usually advise waiting until a ghost contacts
you.&nbsp; There are several ways that a ghost will do this. Through our
dreams being one of the most common.&nbsp; When we are asleep our mind
is open to many things that we may not consider possible while awake.&nbsp;
Ghost communication is one of these. Many times a spirit will use this
avenue as it is less frightening to us also.&nbsp; So if you dream of a
past loved one with a peculiar message, they might actually be visiting
you in your dreams.&nbsp; We have also received stories of ghosts using
others means to communicate beyond our dreams. Phone calls are becoming
more common from the afterlife, sometimes without us even knowing the loved
one has passed yet.&nbsp; These phone calls are generally short and to
the point giving information, love and hope in times when we need it most.
There are many other ways that a ghost tries to communicate with the living
from a feeling of not being alone, to messages being written, or words
being whispered in the night.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing to
keep in mind however is to try to be patient and wait for the ghost to
contact you, which they will if they have a message for you, or you are
involved in the reason they are still here and haven't moved on to the
next realm of existence. If you feel a loved one is trying to communicate
you and find you cannot wait please do not try to take matters in your
own hands. Find an experienced and highly recommended psychic or medium
to help you make contact. It is never a good idea to use devises or rituals
that manipulate ghosts such as Ouija Boards, seances, or automatic writing,
all these procedures can be dangerous in untrained hands and can</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">attract the attention of someone or something
other than the loved one you are trying to contact. Psychics, and mediums
know the proper and safest ways to use these tools and can help you make
the contact with the proper ghost in the huge world of the afterlife.&nbsp;
If you feel the ghost is not a loved one but you still wish to find out
who it may be or why, then please do research into your home or area to
find out what events may have transpired to lead to who and why a ghost
is still here.&nbsp; Many times just checking with your local library or
newspaper will give enough information to help you determine who may be
haunting a particular area.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all if
you feel you are involved with the reason a ghost is still here or they
wish you to help them, they will let you know in their own time.&nbsp;
The hardest thing to do sometimes is be patient while you wait for them
to reveal their reasons to you.&nbsp; These are just some of my thoughts.
As always I welcome yours in email.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
