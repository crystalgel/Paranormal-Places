Freaked Out Sleepover<br>
<br>
<br>
By: clubcool2003@yahoo.com.au<br>
<br>
hi im cassie and this is a story that i think is sutible for ur website.<br>
When i was about 8 i went on my first sleepover at my friends house,
two other girls were going to be there too (they were twins).<br>
We had been playing outside but were soon told to go inside because it was getting dark, after arguing we went inside.<br>
We went into the rumpus room which was located downstairs, it was
filled with toys, games of all discriptions plus an old looking here.<br>
My friend said she didn't play the piano and either did her friends so we decided to play with different toys.<br>
I can not clearly remeber what we were playing with but something with
our hands.We were all having lots of fun untill we all heared music
coming from the piano.It was really low music.<br>
We all looked around but no one was there, but what i do remember seeing was an old wrinkerly, boney, green hand.<br>
As you can imagin we all ran screaming upstairs to the kitchen and told
my friends parents.They just told us to settle down and that it was our
imaginations.So we all had a drink and went to my friends room to
discuss what we saw.<br>
One of the twins had told me it was a ghost.<br>
Later when going down to the living room for dinner i thought i heared a noise so i looked up.<br>
(In the hallway of my friends house you can see the frame of the house.)<br>
I saw about three figures jumping up there, they kind of looked like
monkeys, what was worse they were all laughing at me and had very wide
grines.<br>
Now about 4yrs later im still freaked out by that day and have believed in the supernatural.<br>
Sometimes when i sleep over i hear laughing from the hall.<br>

Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: cwstacks@swbell.net<br>
<br>
I was at a friends house and I was in the front drive helping with the
car when I noticed a man on his front porch without a head this man was
wearing an orange tee-shirt and khaki shorts he was white and wasnt
very large in build he looked to weigh about 130 140lbs&nbsp; and would
have been near 6"2 if he had his head it looked alot like my friend to
tell you the truth I didnt get any particular feeling from it&nbsp; it
didnt move or do anything it was about 1:00 in the afternoon the
second&nbsp; time I saw something it was near midnight a few months
later and I was walking out onto that same porch I had turned to say
goodnight to my friends at the door and as I did so I was struck with
this sickening terror that Ive never felt before or since I
instinctively knew&nbsp; where to look and as I&nbsp; faced my right I
saw it there&nbsp; stood a figure on the porch with no features it was
solid black I could&nbsp; see it&nbsp; clearly aginst the darknes of
the night and it was very dark outside I couldnt&nbsp; see outside
of&nbsp; a&nbsp; 10 or&nbsp; 15 ft area around me&nbsp; no porch light
on it was pitch black&nbsp; and this dark thing was darker than the
night I was so scared I had my friend escort me to the car and I'm a
pretty big boy I weigh in at 215 lbs 5"11 in I didnt&nbsp; even have to
see this thing before I was scared of it later that month my friends
woke up to find a black cloud floating in the corner of their room that
moved&nbsp; directly over them and&nbsp; went away when the light came
on things&nbsp; started to move&nbsp; and&nbsp; more strange stuff
started to happen in the bathroom thee rug would twist itself into a
knot and then flaten out when touched it would&nbsp; stay balled
up&nbsp; with anything&nbsp; else that was in the floor&nbsp; towels
clothing would turn into a ball and all flaten into a lump&nbsp; when
disturbed and only when disturbed I blessed the home&nbsp; starting in
the bathroom I went out into the next room and as I made my way around
the house saying my prayer there was a loud noise and a fluttering of
vinecian blinds as I guess the spirit left the building through the
window I didnt see any other reason for the blinds to move so violently
it was as if he passed through them and was gone and they havent told
me of any further problems but I still get the creeps just knowing that
it was there&nbsp; for sure it was there I wonder where it is now<br>

Haunted Farmhouse<br>
<br>
By: Katbanshee1@aol.com<br>
<br>
This is a true story from over 30 years ago. When my husband and I were
first married, we rented a farm house while we were looking for a place
to live in Minnesota. The farmer still had cows on the property, and
all we had to do was let him know when a calfing was starting. We had a
black cat and a black Labrador Retriever, and everything was pretty
cool there, except I didn't like the feeling of the upstairs or the
basement, which had a root cellar, and was kind of dank. We had very
little furniture, so settled most of our things on the main floor and
the bedroom there. The first thing that happened was the phone kept
ringing. This was in the early 70's when they still used the
four-pronged phone jacks to plug in your phone. The phone was in a
little nook by the entryway and was NOT plugged in. The phone in the
bedroom was. This particular phone would ring and ring (not the one in
the bedroom), and when we picked it up there was nothing but dead air.
We threw it out. The next thing that happened was I would hear a loud
thump upstairs above the livingroom at odd times during the day or
night. The only things that were up there were my husband's two six
foot tall speakers that he used for his gigs when he sang at local
hotels and with his friends. I would go up there to see if one of them
fell over, and they were still upright. I would hear footsteps in one
of the bedrooms upstairs at times, and hear footsteps walking up and
down the stairs. We always kept the door to the upstairs closed,
because I didn't like it up there. One night, I was sitting in the
bedroom downstairs with the dog and cat watching TV when my husband
came in and asked me what I wanted. I asked him what he was talking
about, and he told me I was just in the bathroom and he heard me sigh
over his shoulder while he was combing his hair. I told him I hadn't
moved, and neither had the animals. The next thing that happened had to
do with the lights and the front door, which we had never been able to
unlock. It was locked with a skeleton key, and the key would never
budge, so we used the back door by the garage to come and go. One day,
I was driving into the drive (it was about 5/8ths of a mile long), and
when I turned in, all the lights were off in the house. There was a
bend in the driveway, and there was a barn there that blocked the view
of our house for a second when you went around it. When I saw the house
again after rounding the barn, all the lights were on in the entryway
(that we never used because we couldn't unlock the front door), which
kind of scared me. I had my dog with me, and we went in through the
back door, and went through the house into the entryway. Nobody was
there. I checked the light switch, which was in the "on" position, and
turned off the light. We checked the rest of the house. Nobody was
there. The dog wasn't acting weird, and was kind of curious about why I
was a bit scared. Then for some odd reason, I tried the skeleton key in
the front door, and it unlocked like it was supposed to. Like it had
never been stuck! From that day forward, the door locked and unlocked
like nothing had ever been wrong with it. I found out later that the
woman that used to live in that house with the farmer we rented it from
had gotten cancer and had to move into town to be closer to the
hospital, before she died. I think her spirit went back to the house
(the farmer had built it for her), and it was she who was messing
around with us. I think she came to like us there, and the door was
finally unlockable after she saw that we cared and were taking good
care of the place. I wasn't afraid of the basement or the upstairs
anymore, and the vibes had changed from eerie to acceptable, like we
were living in sync. After the door unlocked, nothing more happened. We
moved from there after living there for about seven months, and all
that stuff happened in the first three months we were there.<br>

Haunted Pub<br>
<br>
By: mellowyella66@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Hi I only have the one experience to pass on.<br>
My mum works in a very old pub in the village where we live in england.
It is widely believed that the pub is haunted by a cavalier soldier as
the pub dates from around that era.<br>
As my mother is the pub manager she often has to stay overnight when
the land lord is away and she often says she has heard somebody calling
her and she knows she is alone as she has locked up.<br>
I had to stay late one night myself to look after my nephew and on more
than one occasion i heard somebody coming up the stairs and walking up
and down the corridor and on checking finding that no one one was
there, and it would be impossible for them to hide anywhere.<br>
They have had a number of paranormal investigators who have said that their is an extremely strong precense in the pub.<br>

Haunting Experience<br>
<br>
By: nyteman18j@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I've been going into the closed down Rosewood Center in
Reisterstown/Owings Mills, Maryland since I was about 13 years old.
Last time I've been inside was two days ago at 4:00am. Everytime I seem
to go with an associate, they're quick to leave within the first half
hour of investigating. Now being 17 years old, I know what more to look
for. In my last visit, I felt a presence right when I walked through
the back door. Me and my friends were complaining how it was so cold
(58 degrees after being 82 degrees during the day), but once we got
inside, we felt neither heat nor cold, just like everytime I go in. For
every experiance, it feels hard to move, like walking under water, and
it's hard to see, even with a flashlight. It's like looking at an old
grainy picture in a movie, but with the grain in your sight rather than
a screen.<br>
When I was younger, I went up the flight of stairs past the waiting
room and saw a wheelchair turn by itself. After I pointed my light back
on it, it slammed into a wall. At this point, me and my friend booked
it out of the building and took off into the woods.<br>
Back in May 16, 2006, I went in around 11:50pm on a Tuesday night with
4 other people who've never been inside before. I felt the presence
instantly, and they did soon after walking through the first floor.
After about 2 minutes, I heard an echo of what sounded like a scream
comming from upstairs. No one else heard it until about 30-45 second
later, it happened again. But this time it was much clearer and louder.
It was a man screaming in pain and what seemed to be torture. The girls
in the group were quick to leave, my buddy pushed me out of the way to
go see where the sound came from as I led the group. With the girls
running out the back, I grabbed him and we followed. As we exited the
back door, one girl and I saw a ghost woman and cat take a few steps
out of thin air, then vaguely disappear. With the spotlight of the
distant part of the Rosewood Center shining, we could see right through
her, but her figure was distinctive. She was about 5'8", slender body,
hair her hair in a bun, wore something of a dress/hospital gown with a
throw over robe covering her back and gripping it with one hand near
her neck. It was the second time I've seen the woman and her cat.<br>
Two days ago, Sunday August 13th, 2006, me and two of my friends went
back. In late May 2006 some kids who were messing around inside the
building set a fire, and did great damage to the building. It pisses me
off how kids don't respect the value of haunted locations. It was
boarded up in June, but when we went back the other day/night,
everything was pushed in. We stepped over pieces of the ceiling that'd
caved in to get inside. Mind you we were extra cautious of the
building's current condition. After going through most of the first
floor, we went into the waiting room, where a matress from the 2nd
floor lay. I grabbed a sofa cusion to take a piece of Rosewood home
with me as we stepped on the matress to get over to the stairs, which
angered a spirit inside. We heard whispers and a slight moaning right
before we planned to go upstairs. With the whispers growing louder, we
decided to leave. After exiting and going around the front of the
building, we saw a white humanly figure leaning against a window sill
on the second floor all the way to the left. My friend stopped us and
pointed it out. We saw as he looked at us, then stood up straight and
folded his arms. We bid him farewell and walked out. I left the cusion
in the woods second guessing that I'd be taking a spirit home with me.<br>
From what I've heard, they'll be knocking down Rosewood in the next
month or so. Me and my friends plan to go back one final time with a
video camera in rememberance of its years of haunting.<br>

Here's My Story: Unexplained Phenomena<br>
<br>
By: cyklopswoman@netzero.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This happened to me about three years ago.&nbsp; My friends, brother
and sister decided to go up to the mountains one Saturday and have a
picnic.&nbsp; We all set up where we were going to be once we got
there. We put up two hammocks (one on which my little niece would be
sleeping on), left the food on a blanket, and everyone went off in
pairs to "explore" for&nbsp; a while. (We went up about two miles
higher than where people usually went, other times, we would find old
witchcraft candles and men's muscle shirts and women's bras entwined
together in a bag with incantations written in pieces of parchment).
Anyhoo, I left with my friend, while my sister left with her boyfriend
and my friend's sister with her boyfriend, my brother stayed with my
niece, sleeping on a hammock. We were trying to spy on her sister and
her boyfriend when a glass beer bottle landed right next to us on a
rock, without breaking! We didn't take beer and the bottle was thrown
from the top of where we were, where we parked. So we immediately
looked up, but saw nothing, so we ignored it. Later on we got hungry so
we went back to the hammocks to find my brother staring at a little
puddle saying "there's a fish in that puddle!" We just called him crazy
for saying that there was a fish--in a puddle! In the mountains! He
just wouldn't drop it, so we just ate.&nbsp; My sister's boyfriend came
by, scared asking for my sister. He left one way to go look for her and
we left the other way.&nbsp; We finally found her, her&nbsp; face paler
than usual saying "shhh, they can hear us, they're following us" and I
said "who?" she said that there was three white figures following her.
After that, my friend told me that she could hear someone behind us,
telling me to stop and shut up every once in a while. She said she
could hear someone's footsteps on dry leaves. When I finally heard the
chilling sound of footsteps with no one in sight, we ran for it! After
quite a long jog my friend tripped on a rock and fell (she was in front
of me) then I started laughing at her while running, she got up and
kept on running, next thing, I tripped and fell on the exact same rock!
We ran to where we set everything up to see that nothing was there
anymore! My little niece was just standing there by herself, crying! We
heard honking up where we parked and we looked up to see my brother in
the car honking and yelling something. Everyone that was with us heard
him, we just ran up and left. Nobody said a word until we almost
crashed head-on with an oncoming jeep. We were speeding and my brother
burly made it to the next lane before crashing. We all turned around to
see such an irresponsible driver going against traffic to see that
there was no such jeep in sight! We just sped all the way home. When we
got home we still felt a bit weird about everything we encountered back
at the mountains. We stood up all night talking about what we heard and
saw. We asked my brother about what freaked him out so much and he said
nothing, and went off to bed. For the next week weird things happened
at home. At night, when we were trying to go to sleep, my younger
sister would tell me about seeing cabinets in the kitchen slowly
opening and closing. My younger sister also had an incident with the
phone. We had caller ID back then, and my sister from work would always
call her. One day the phone rang and my sister saw that it was my other
sister calling, she picked up but they had already hung up. When my
younger sister called my other sister back to her work, she said that
she was really busy and couldn't talk then. But my sister told her that
she had just called and my other sister told her that she had been
really busy all day and didn't have time to call her. When my sister
hung up on her she went back to check the call log again and it wasn't
there anymore! Everytime I saw myself in the mirror that week, I felt
uneasy and had to look away.&nbsp; About a week later my friend came
over and we told him all bout these strange happenings and he didn't
believe us, he said he didn't believe in that type of stuff. That
afternoon when he headed back home, he called me and told me that his
truck stopped in the middle of the cementery. (There is a cementery
between our cities, going through it is the shortest way to get home).
After that day all of the strange things stopped happening! I was
relieved and at the same time scared for my friend. We felt that the
entities we came accross in the mountains followed us home...<br>

In My Mirror<br>
<br>
By: Dbzbunn1@aol.com<br>
<br>
OK this happened to me when I was about 9 years old. Our house was
already haunted by a little girl but thats a different story, my
grandfather had just died and a bunch of people in our family had
sightings of him already and I did not think i would see him.<br>
But there was this night just about a week or so after his funeral. My
sister had woken me up to go into the kitchen with her to get a drink
of water and so i was like, whatever.&nbsp; I got out of bed and walked
with her into the kitchen.<br>
But on the wall of our kitchen was our mirror and below it was our
table and that was where my grandfather would always sit and read the
newspaper. He would have the reflection of his head in the mirror.<br>
So when my sister took me into the kitchen I took a drink along with
her but when I finished, i turned and looked at the mirror. And in the
mirror was my grandfather, his reflection of him sitting and reading
like he used to.<br>
I didn't even think but i still had enough stability to think of
running. Even though he was my grandfather, I was still scared, so I
took off running from the kitchen to the living room.&nbsp; And when I
touched the living room carpet, i took the biggest jump of my life and
it was like 4 feet in the air and onto the couch.<br>
i was so scared i just curled into the fetal position and fell back
asleep.&nbsp; I told my family and they were sharing their stories once
again. It was a traumatic experience but i turned out fine. I am no
psycho...not today...haha!<br>

My Dad's House is possibly Haunted<br>
<br>
By: Teufelhund27@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My name is Mike and I live in Piedmont, Oklahoma with my dad,
stepmother and her sons. My stepmother, Susan as well as myself have
reason to belive that our house is haunted. <br>
Every morning, the two of us make coffee early in the morning, some
time around 4:00 to 4:30. While one of us is pouring the grounds into
the pot, we occasionally feel our hand getting pushed away from the pot
as if the spirit though we made our coffee too strong.<br>
The more interesting events happen around 1:00 or 2:00 A.M. Myself and
Susan, along with some close friends of mine have spotted a ghost who
seems to contain himself in my stepbrothers, and my old, room. He
stands at about my height at 6' 2", average muscle build, wears a white
tank top or t-shirt, blue jeans, and a chain that runs from his belt
loop to his wallet on his right side. Usually when he's spotted, he
leaves the room, walks down the hall, and comes in to watch T.V. in my
opinion. He seems to like Futurama...<br>
There are two more who visit less frequently are a fatter ghost who
likes to open and close the front door and a woman in a pioneer-esque
dress. The fat ghost, or Bubba as I call him generally stays around the
area in and outside the front door. The woman generally just goes where
she pleases.<br>
We tend to believe that these occurance have to do with a small grave
yard that's not a quarter mile from our neighborhood. I never venture
there on my own, but I have been there with some friends. From time to
time,&nbsp; a shorter woman, very attractive, is seen walking from
grave to grave appearing to be looking for somone who might be buried
there. Also, there is a grave stone for a baby who died some 150 or so
years ago. On occasion, very, very seldomly, you may hear what sounds
like a baby laughing. I spent some time with a woman who is Wiccan who
said there was an evil presence whom she belives may have been either a
rapist or murderer, although he's never been seen.<br>
Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope you find it as interesting as we always do.<br>

My Mother is Still with Us.<br>
<br>
By: Carolynkalolina@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My husband and were living in a home owned by my mother in-law on
Rosamond, Ca.My mother was living with us at the time.&nbsp; She had
passed away in 1994 in one of the small rooms.&nbsp; After my marriage
broke up, we moved out and my mother in-law moved backed in.One night
my boys stayed the night with grandma, they were sleeping in the living
room.My 14 yr. old woke and up and saw a apparition appear over my
older son on the other couch.Just hovering and looking down at both of
them. My younger son said it looked like the grandma that was dead that
he had seen in photo albums. Other times the occupants in the house
have seen and heard her.<br>

<br>
My Stepdad<br>
<br>
By: deflep81@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
When I was in high school, my mom married my band teacher. We were
always close as student/teacher status, so having him as my stepdad was
great. I was so much closer to him than I am to my real dad. Last
August, (almost exactly a year ago) he was out mowing our lawn and
collapsed, instantly dying of a massive heart attack. The family was
devastated. Only a few things odd things have happened since then, and
it was only shortly after he died.<br>
My mom was getting a little scared of sleeping by herself, so I would
sleep in her bed with her. The weekend after he died, my mom went out
of town to her sister's to try and relax. I slept in her bedroom, in
her bed, on my stepdad's side. (His sleep number was MUCH more
comfortable than hers!) I kept the door shut so the cat would not get
into the room. I KNOW that the cat hadn't gotten into the room before I
fell asleep. In the middle of the night, I woke up to turn the TV off
and when I shifted my foot, I hit something hard. It definitely felt
like someone sitting on the bed. I about freaked out. I turned the TV
back on and kept my eyes wide open for quite a while! I'm pretty sure
that was him. <br>
I think, maybe, 2 days after he passed away, I was at my friend's house
talking with her and her mom about everything. We were sitting on at
the bar in her kitchen on stools. All of a suddon, my chair started
shaking pretty strongly. I ignored it for the first couple times it
happened. After about the 3rd time, I asked my friend where her dogs
were. She swore that they were upstairs sleeping. The shaking happened
again and I said to her "can't you feel that?!" Her mother was sitting
next to us and neither of them felt a thing. My friend said "I don't
know, these chairs are pretty sturdy..." Which they were! I found that
a bit weird...<br>
The night before we were to bury his ashes, I was sleeping in my mom's
bed and I woke up in the middle of the night and saw my stepdad
standing next to the bed. All he said was "hi." I still wonder if I was
dreaming or not, but this was clear as day. I remember kind of just
looking at him and falling back asleep. I actually wasn't too scared at
that point. <br>
About 6 months after he passed, my sister told me about a dream she
had. She was opening the garage door to go outside and when she opened
it, she saw my stepdad walking up the driveway. She ran up to him and
he hugged her while she cried and said "why did you have to leave? I
love you, I miss you." She said that all he said was he was sorry, he
was sorry. (He wasn't taking care of his health when he was alive and
he never told us of any discomfort he had.) I know that was him telling
her that he's okay, that we will be okay. That dream she told me about
upset me, but I finally realized that he IS okay.<br>

My Story with Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: SamG1292@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi. I have a few stories containing ghosts or just weird things.My
first story didn't`t happen to me but to my mom`s friend,Debbie and her
husband(I think his name is Jay,not sure),at their house(I don`t know
where it is though).They would place small things like salt or pepper
bottles on the counter in the kitchen and come back later to find it in
a different place,usually a foot or 2 away or on the other counter.They
would ask each other if they moved it and they would say no.They knew
the dog couldn't reach it because the counter was too high for the
dog.When they would go to work they would come home,not at the same
time,to find the air or heater on.They didn't have it set or anything
and the dog couldn't reach it.They found out who the ghost was(I forgot
the name sorry it`s been a few years)and believed he turned the air or
heat on for the dog when they weren't home.They would be watching TV in
the living room with the dog sleeping at their feet and would hear a
man`s voice coming from the other room.They would turn the TV down to
make sure and the voice would still be talking.They got used to him but
a few months later they knew he was gone because he didn't`t do or talk
anymore,they also felt like he wasn't there anymore.They didn't mind
him there but they thought he just passed on.<br>
My next stories happened to me.My mom told me this story.When I was 3
my uncle(my dad`s brother)died of aids .I had only met him a few times.
A few nights after his funeral my mom woke up to the sound of me
talking to someone.She waited a few minutes and the talking stopped so
she went back to sleep.In the morning she asked me who I was talking
to. I said,"Uncle Frankie."(my uncle who died)I don`t remember anything
because I was young but I believe her because she wouldn't lie to me.<br>
One time I was in my room on the computer with the TV right next to me
on. I had the TV turned to a radio station. Because it was right next
to me I had it turned down low.My grandma was the only one home with me
and she was in the living room. I was looking at the computer screen
when I heard footsteps behind me.They were low in volume but I knew it
wasn't the TV. I thought it was my grandma because they were slow and
kind of dragged on the carpet. Thinking she was just coming in to check
up on me as usual I didn't mind it.Then a shadow appeared over me and
the computer screen. I turned around and saw no one there.My heart
started racing and I knew it wasn't my grandma because to leave my room
I would have heard her and it would take her about a minute to leave .I
decided to go to the kitchen because I would pass her. I went to the
kitchen and she was sitting on the couch watching Oprah.I defiantly
knew she didn't come to my room because she wouldn't get up from
watching Oprah. So I just got a drink went into my room and continued
what I was doing.WEIRD. <br>
Oh and the first story happened about 2 years ago in 2004 and the second one in 1995 and the 3rd story this summer of 2006.<br>

Personal Experience<br>
<br>
By: blue_meenee@yahoo.com<br>

<br>
I've read through the many shared stories on your site and have run
across just a few warm stories.&nbsp; While I understand that the
subject of ghosts or spirits is usually a frightful one, I wanted to
share my own experience with you that I consider to be one of my most
cherished memories.&nbsp; <br>
In October of 2002, my identical twin boys had just turned one, my
daughter had just turned two, and I was struggling and suffering
terribly with post-partum depression.&nbsp; My grandmother (my father's
mom) was also dying.&nbsp; She had taken a fall and recovering from
surgery was proving to be impossible in her frail condition.&nbsp;
While growing up, my father's parents were not close to us and it had
seemed they didn't want a whole lot to do with me and my
siblings.&nbsp; It was only after I was married for the first time and
had my children, that my grandmother had shown a spark of interest in
me and her only grandchildren.&nbsp; <br>
My father had been raised as an only child and was not aware he had a
brother until after he was married to my mother.&nbsp; His brother was
born prematurely and had died when he was&nbsp; only a few hours
old.&nbsp; I had always felt some sort of connection towards this uncle
I had never known, and I even named my youngest twin after him.&nbsp; <br>
The last time I saw my grandmother alive was the week before she
died.&nbsp; She was hospitalized in Las Cruces, NM and I live in Mesa,
AZ.&nbsp; I packed up myself and drove to Las Cruces with the rest of
my family, leaving my husband and children at home.&nbsp; In the
hospital, the only words she was able to muster to us was "Where are my
babies?" referring to my kids.&nbsp; It was so hard to tell her that I
was sorry, but they were at home.&nbsp; Those were the last words I was
able to speak with her.&nbsp; <br>
My father is business partners with a very, very close family friend -
so close, she's family herself.&nbsp; The day after my grandmother
died, this friend was at work and looked up to see a gentleman standing
in the front of the office she hadn't seen or heard enter.&nbsp; He
looked similar to my father, but was not my father.&nbsp; She asked if
she could help him, and he told her "We're waiting for Randy(my father)
to let her go at the funeral.&nbsp; We're so excited to see her
again."&nbsp; She said she blinked, and he was gone.&nbsp; <br>
We believe this was my uncle who died at birth, and the general
consensus was that this was for my benefit and my father's benefit, to
let us know that my grandmother was going to be taken care of since we
were having the hardest time with her death.&nbsp; Her death actually
put me back a few steps with my post-partum recovery.&nbsp; <br>
A few weeks after her funeral, I was trying to sleep on the couch
because it was the only place comfortable at the time, and I was
startled by my blankets being adjsuted around me and I heard a woman
whisper to me, "I'm okay" and this feeling of warmth and peace
surrounding me.&nbsp; <br>
I've not had anymore experiences with her, but I believe my daughter
has seen and spoken to her.&nbsp; About a year ago, while driving home
after visiting my new husband at work for lunch with my children, my
daughter was talking away in the back seat, and&nbsp; she paused for a
second, and then said "I have red hair like Grandma Betty" and then
started talking away again at random. My parents have no pictures of my
grandmother in colour and there was no way for her to have known she
had red hair like her great-grandmother, or known her as "Betty".&nbsp;
My daughter has also mentioned on a few occasions that her favourite
colour is orange like Grandma Betty, also.&nbsp; <br>
Sorry this was so long, I just wanted to share my own very personal and cherished story with you.&nbsp; <br>

Psycho-Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: hazard2evry1@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
It was so strange, I moved into a new house a year ago August and I
noticed that my personality was changing, I was angry for no reason. We
got the house for dirt cheap about one third of what it was worth.
Another thing I noticed the last couple that lived here only stayed for
eight months and they were never home. Every time we'd come by to see
the house (before we bought it) a maid was there vacuuming in the same
place every time (where everybody driving by could see her). She
doesn't really have any relevance in my story, just thought it was
weird that the family was never home and this woman was. Anyway, we
moved in, got settled. I went down stairs and found scrolls of Shiva
(the seven armed Indian God) and the Elephant God on the wall. Just two
though. I made a joke saying I wanted to hang them in my room to my
parents because my mom and grandma are strong Catholics and religion
isn't a big deal in my life. I went up stairs to my room and got a cold
chill every time when I'd get to the top. Everything was normal for a
few months. I had some friends from South Carolina come up (I live in
Indiana) and visit for a while, who since I've lost contact with and
apparently lost my friendship with (we were friends since we were five,
we're both seventeen now) then I had my cousin come down for a week
from a small town called Huntsville. I mentioned to him that I think my
house is haunted and that I get a cold chill at the top of the stairs.
So he went to the top of the stairs and got the same thing I did, I
thought it was funny at the time because he was really freaked out. My
cousin left later that week and refuses to come to my house because it
scares him, then my friends from Florida left June 21st, I haven't
talked to them since. I would stay up until 5 in the morning and get up
around 6 at night (my mom does home daycare and I never get any alone
time) so I go down stairs around 2 - 4 in the morning to get food,
cokes, etc. and I looked up before I started to walk up the stairs and
saw a black-ish grey figure in the shape of a person standing were we'd
get the cold chill. I still see the figure every time I go downstairs
at night and get a chill, just now I did when I typed that. Here's when
the word &#8220;psycho&#8221; comes in. I thought I was going insane. I felt like a
special ed student when I was around people like I'd have an urge to
hit them or say something really stupid. Some times it went as bad that
I wanted to stab some one. I was stupid and didn't want to tell my
parents because I always claimed my sister was psycho (teenage girls...
you know what I mean) and I thought that this was just a teenage phase
like most teenagers feel depressed or how little kids go through the
terrible two's. So I just kept my mouth shut. It was summer for a while
and I felt like I was going to lose it one day and kill some one. Then
school started again and I was around people all the time, even worse I
had a lot of friends that I was afraid I'd lose or even worse hurt or
kill, so you can understand I was scared out of my mind because I felt
like I wasn't controlling my body. Then I got to thinking about this,
before I went "insane" I had an alter ego I'd joke around and blame all
my outburst on called "Aidias", then I decided that it was too weird so
I stopped doing that and a few months later here we are. Then I started
to think more, the worse I got the less I prayed. I used to pray every
night since fourth grade then it was about 3 - 4 times a week, then 1 -
3, and so on until I didn't. A few days ago my cousin Douglas got
married, the wedding was a Catholic one. For those of you who don't
know what that is it's a wedding with a Church ceremony. I walked in
and everything was coming back to me from when I used to go to Church a
few years ago. Every few seconds I'd get a cold chill, especially when
they'd pray or a song would play then it hit me. I thought "... maybe
I'm not going crazy... maybe I'm possessed.." I normally don't believe
this stuff, but it wasn't me to go "insane" and everybody thinks my
house is haunted. And I normally loved Church and helping people, not
the case lately. I didn't even want to go receive communion (the eating
and drinking of the bread and wine) then I made myself go and as soon
as I got the bread I felt like my mind cleared and I felt like my
normal self, my cousin Lauren was holding the wine and I know this is
stupid, but it's always me to fool around and joke about things so I
took the glass from her hands and took a huge gulp of it (you are
supposed to let them guide it to you and take a sip) then I realized I
was getting more social. Even if I left the reception to go to a
football game before they cut the cake, I felt like a new person. As I
was leaving I took the Holy Water and formed a cross on my forehead
before I left and thought "take that demon b*tch!" in a joking matter.
I think you&#8217;d have to be me to understand why I think that I&#8217;m not
crazy, because if I was reading this I&#8217;d think that the writer needs
mental help. I do think I was possessed now, but I do think that this
feeling will come back until I move from this house, so until then look
like I get to go to Church more often!<br>

Bed Visit<br>
<br>
By: tball6@verizon.net<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much!!!!!!!!.You have an excellent site that I will
visit often.I have a few unusual things that has happened to me at an
old church I had worked at as a janitor.and a lot of strange things
seemed to be drawn to that place.I still get a little anxious when I
tell these stories,so forgive me if I ramble a bit.The first odd thing
that happened;I would finish cleaning the classroom.there were 10 rooms
5 on one side 5 on other of thus long hall.I would lock up at the end
of my day.Always starting with the room all the projectors and things
like that were kept.I would check the windows,then lock the door.I
would work my way down one side then up the other.Always making sure
the door was locked .when I would get to the last room which was right
across the projector room,the door was open about 8``.I didn't think to
much of this at first.I wrote it off as maybe I didn't lock it
correctly.But then it happened several more times,I knew it wasn't me.
I knew I had locked it and would always double check that door.I know
that there was no one else that could have unlocked it,there was only
me in that part of the building.Another thing that happened that I
cannot explain is;Creston the other and only guy that worked there with
me,were in the church basement.The door a large metal and glass door
perfectly balanced began to move slowly at first and then slam
shut.There was no breeze that could have done that because you had to
go through a set of identical doors that were closed and then down two
flights of stairs.We even tried to re-create what happened but the door
would sit stationary,no matter what position it was left in.Another
occurrence happened several times.Two nights a week I would answer the
phone at the rectory when the priest were out.on these occasions it was
just me and the parish dog.I would sit and do my homework when I would
hear footsteps coming down the hall.I would look but there was none
there ,just me and the dog.I would chalk this up to an active
imagination if it weren't for a few things.Other people that worked at
the church heard the footsteps also and the dog would becomevery
anxious look down the hall and whimper.The most terrifying thing
happened in the middle of the day.We Creston and I,were stripping the
floors.I was sweeping the floor while Creston went to the bathroom.I
had full view of the window when I heard a very loud bang 3 times on
the window .I ran out of the classroom thinking Creston was playing a
joke.when I saw him he was coming out of the bathroom.I had told him
what had happened and even said``that was a good one,you scared the
hell out of me!``He looked at me like I was crazy.So I took him into
the room and was explaining to him what had happened,and it happened
again.Him and I were both looking at the window when it happened
again.There is a very large parking lot that those windows face,if
there was someone out there we would have seen them,no problem.We ran
out pretty fast.These are some things I cannot explain.Like I said
in&nbsp; my first email,I believe most paranormal things have a very
non-paranormal explanation,but I cannot think of any for these.Does the
banging 3 times have any significance?This church/school seemed to be a
magnet for not so paranormal but strange and I feel worth
mentioning.The day after the pope got shot(this was a long time ago)a
women called when I was working one night answering the phones.She said
she was the Virgin Mary and wanted a communion host I explained that
all I could do was to leave a message for the pastor .She called back 2
more times.several days later she punched through the glass door pain
reached in and ripped off the deadbolt.This took a lot of strength to
do this.She cut her hand inthe processes she ran through the school(yes
school was in at the time,no kids got hurt)she ran into the church
splattered blood on the alter,lit 2 cigs and put them out on the book
on the alter.She then ran outside and smeared blood on a marble statue
of Mary.The cops at this point had arrived and taken her away.From what
I heard this woman had a long history of mental illness.this was a very
uncomfortable place to work.I worked there through high school.I always
felt uneasy in most of the building,which was pretty large.The rumor
was ,that the original pastor that built the church and school put his
whole life into this place and couldn't bear to leave.I would love to
see the results of a paranormal investigation,but being a Catholic
church I don't think that will happen.feel free to use this on your
website.Thanks for listening and again thanks for the info<br>

Strange House<br>
<br>
By: Emaw51@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1977 My husband, myself and our daughter 5 and son 1 moved to a
house in Downey, California. Just weeks after moving into this house I
started having severe migraines. So bad I had seizures with them. Had
never had this before. Doctor could find no cause after doing cat scan
and brain scan and every other kind of test know to man. Anyway right
after the migraines started, we had strange things happen in the house.
Over timer would go off in the middle of the night. Daughter started
walking in her sleep and having horrible nightmares. This kept up for a
full year. Son started walking and we put him in his own bed. He too
would walk in his sleep and hide inside the fireplace.<br>
We started seeing images walking down the hallway at night. Which were
not the kids. My husband would be the first one up in the morning and
would find the front and back doors unlocked and wide open. We had
double keyed deadbolts in both doors and we kept the keys in them at
night.<br>
Well we started taking the keys out at night thinking the kids were
walking in their sleep and afraid they would leave the house. Again the
doors would be open in the morning.<br>
I&nbsp; had mentioned to my dad about this happening and he laughed it
off. This continued for 4 years. Things would come up missing and we
never did find them. I would leave my watch on the kitchen counter
every night and the next morning it would be on the floor.<br>
Well during this time I was still having the horrible migraines and was
thinking of doing away with myself, if you know what I mean, yes
suicide. Well I was so bothered about the doors being open every
morning that I finally got so spooked that I asked my dad to spend the
night. He and my mother came over and stayed on a Wednesday night. My
mom slept on the couch and my dad slept on the floor. He kept all the
keys to the deadbolta in his pocket while he slept. He was the first
one up in the morning and he found both doors unlocked and opened. He
came in and woke my husband and me and said, pack up and get my
grandkids out of this house.<br>
Well we went and stayed at their house until we could rent another house, which was about a month.<br>
Well when we left that house, the kids no longer had nightmares or walked in their sleep. And I quit having the migraines,<br>
That was 4 years of living in hell for my entire family.<br>

The Little Man<br>
<br>
By: Katbanshee1@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here's one more story for my friends at Shadowlands:<br>
I've had many encounters, but mostly hearing stuff. I did see one
ghost, and Lord knows where he came from. We called him "The Little
Man." <br>
My husband and I moved to Minnesota after we got married in the 70's,
and after various rental homes, bought a house and it was during the
time I was pregnant with my first daughter that something started
haunting where my husband worked and followed him home. At first, it
threw hangers off of a door where they hung their coats at work. Then
it started freezing rooms and making the computer alarms go off because
they were too cold (he was doing newspaper copy at the time). It would
run the adding machines when you were just sitting there watching.
Always the temperature would drop when this happened. My husband said
he kept seeing a "Little Man" going around the corner down the hall, at
our house, but couldn't describe him completely. The Little Man stayed
with us through five businesses and three moves. By the time he hit the
second house and the third business, my husband had a description (tan
pants, flowery shirt and very short in stature, with brown curly hair).
I saw him in the first house we bought (we rented the others before
then). He was standing in our garage window watching me barbecue some
pork chops on the patio, and I could see our boat right through him in
the garage. He was wearing a flowered shirt and had short brown curly
hair. I told him to go away and leave us alone. My husband saw him
walking around our car before we left on a trip to California to visit
relatives, and the brand new starter we just had put in went out in Las
Vegas on our way there!&nbsp; He followed us to two more houses. One we
rented while we were building our last house across the street, and
then after we moved into it. At the rental house, My husband would see
him standing in the doorway of our bedroom watching us, or see him
walking down the hall. By then, we had two little children, and I had
become fiercely protective. I had a newborn daughter and a daughter
that was one and a half years old at the time. We NEVER discussed the
Little Man in front of them. One day when she was 2, my oldest daughter
said to me, "Mommy, who is that little man?" I froze. I said to her,
"What little man?" She said to me, "The one that's going down the
stairs..." I told her I didn't see anyone, and she said, "Oh, he's
gone." I went down the stairs to the basement (we had a walkout
basement), and the sliding glass doors were locked, and there wasn't
any other exit but that. He showed up one more time as a shadow, coming
up my driveway (which had crushed rocks and he never made a sound) and
tried to disappear into my garage, and I had finally had it. I yelled
for him to stay away from me and my children, and he was not welcome in
my home. It must have worked, because he never bothered me or my
children again. My sister-in-law was there and thought I was nuts. I am
no longer married to that man and I am glad. Although we have remained
friends, things don't follow me around anymore. He lives a healthy 2000
miles from me. I believe he was the one that brought the little man and
the reason he stayed. He would let anything hang around, no matter what
kind of vibe it had<br>

The Person in the Dress Hat<br>
<br>
By: sticks@gcctv.com<br>
<br>
One Sunday morning about 10:00 AM in the mid sixties I was visiting my
parents at 2014 E. Cedar in Springfield, Illinois.&nbsp; While my
father was getting cleaned up I was sitting in his living room, reading
the Sunday funnies.&nbsp; For some unknown reason I lowered the paper
long enough to notice my brother, Tommy, coming down the stairs from
the balcony bedroom overlooking the living room.&nbsp; I resumed
reading the paper to finish the comic strip I was reading thinking that
I would then go into the kitchen and visit with him.&nbsp; I was
puzzled why he was home from college.&nbsp; Tommy was attending Palmer
University and I wanted to see what he was up to.&nbsp; In the interim
my father came out of the bath room.&nbsp; I asked him when Tommy got
home from college.&nbsp; Dad said, "he isn't".&nbsp; I said yes he is,
I just seen him coming down the balcony bedroom stairs and walking
though your bedroom towards the kitchen.&nbsp; We went into the kitchen
and no one was there.&nbsp; My father did not let on that anything was
out of the ordinary, so although I had not heard a door open or close,
I just figured that my brother had left the house before I got a chance
to talk with him.&nbsp; <br>
The following weekend I was back in Springfield and stopped by my
folk's house.&nbsp; The family was all sitting around the kitchen table
chatting.&nbsp; My mom made the remark that she had seen Uncle Glen
walking through the bedroom again last night.&nbsp; I had never heard
her say anything like this so I asked what she was taking about.&nbsp;
Mom said that for the past year there had been a man wearing a dress
hat that keeps waking through the house at all hours.&nbsp; She would
awake and see him walking past the foot of her bed.&nbsp; He always
seemed to be walking towards the living room.&nbsp; Mom had named him
"Uncle Glen" because my dad's brother always wore a dress hat.&nbsp; I
asked if mom was just leading me on.&nbsp; My dad spoke up and said,
"you seen him last Sunday".&nbsp; I asked, "what are you talking
about"?&nbsp; Dad reminded me that I had seen the man with the hat
coming down the balcony bed room stairs and walking towards the
kitchen.&nbsp; I agreed but protested that it looked more like my
brother Tommy than Uncle Glen.&nbsp; Tommy was the only one in our
immediate family that always wore a dress hat.&nbsp; We had more of a
discussion that night on what the apparition looked like than the fact
that there was a ghost haunting their house.&nbsp; The Ghost's
appearances were becoming more frequent.&nbsp; Mom and my two younger
brothers were starting to be afraid.&nbsp; So they finally started
telling me what had been going on in their house for the past year with
the understanding that I would not bring in any outsiders to
investigate the paranormal activity.&nbsp; We all agreed that the Ghost
was solid and looked like a person depending on who seen it.&nbsp; It
was not something you could see through.<br>
My youngest brother, Jim, said he and dad were the only ones home one
Saturday afternoon and were sitting on the edge of the bed looking
through a sport's magazine.&nbsp; Both of them looked up at the same
time asking each other who just walked past them, within inches.&nbsp;
They got up and searched the back bed room and bathroom but found no
one.&nbsp; Then Donny, second from the youngest brother spoke up.&nbsp;
He had more tales to tell about his experiences with this ghost.&nbsp;
Donny slept in the upstairs balcony bedroom.&nbsp; He had more
encounters with the ghost than any of the family.&nbsp; Donny would be
just getting in at midnight or later after and evening of partying and
the ghost would be sitting on his bed.&nbsp; Or, Donny would wake up
and find the Ghost standing over him.&nbsp; He got so accustom to
seeing the ghost that he stopped fearing it and even tried talking to
it.&nbsp; On the other hand my youngest brother Jimmy had gotten so
afraid of the Ghost that he started sleeping on a cot at the foot of
mom and dad's bed.&nbsp; One night, Donny woke up and seen the ghost
walking away from his bed.&nbsp; Donny followed the ghost, down the
stairs and witnessed the ghost walk into mom and dad's bedroom through
my youngest brother Jimmy, sleeping on the cot, and exit the house
right through the wall.&nbsp; Another time Donny came home late one
night, when he went upstairs to go to bed, the Ghost was sitting on
Donny's bed.&nbsp; Donny just told the Ghost to move over and threw
himself right through the Ghost onto the bed and went to sleep.&nbsp;
One time, my two youngest brothers were sitting in the living room
watching TV.&nbsp; There was no one else home.&nbsp; A light turned on
in the Kitchen.&nbsp; They went into the kitchen to see who turned on
the light but the kitchen was dark.&nbsp; Eventually I learned of a
year's worth of haunting from every member of my family.&nbsp; Another
personal encounter that I can recall is the night the light bulb blew
out.&nbsp; My lady friend, Carol, dad and myself were playing cards at
the kitchen table when the light bulb in a nearby lamp literally blew
up and sent glass flying all over the room.&nbsp; I had heard of light
bulbs burning out but never just blowing up.&nbsp; While cleaning up
the glass we joked that Carol's bad play made the resident Ghost mad.
The game broke up early that night and we got out of there.&nbsp; Carol
was a little shook as all this was new to her.&nbsp; After that, I
remember the time or two that I had to stay overnight in my parent's
house.&nbsp; I would close my eyes and never open them until it was
daylight for fear of what I might see.&nbsp; Something was going to
have to be done about all this before someone got hurt.&nbsp; I would
check on my family as often as I could to see if the haunting was
letting up.&nbsp; One day I stopped by my parents house to see how
things were going.&nbsp; I notice what looked like an African shrunken
head, was hanging over the entrance of mom and dad's bedroom off of the
kitchen.&nbsp; My younger brother Tommy&nbsp; had come home from
college and was told about the ghost.&nbsp; He hung that head there to
get rid of the ghost.&nbsp; I think at the time he was messing around
with Voodoo.&nbsp; I don't know for sure and never wanted to
know.&nbsp; The apparition was only seen a few more times after that
head was hung and each time it became more transparent.&nbsp;
Eventually the ghost was never seen again..&nbsp; One humorous aspect
to all this was that one brother, Donny had a habit of smacking the
head with a newspaper every time he walked under it.&nbsp; Eventually,
he accidentally knocked the shrunken head down and broke it.&nbsp; It
worried him that the ghost might return so he tore the head off of one
of his daughter's dolls and hung it up in place of the shrunken head he
had broken.&nbsp; Mom lived a peaceful existence for a couple more
years in that house and passed away in 1967<br>
I always had a hard time trying to figure out why it took a year for
anyone in my family to speak up about all this.&nbsp; The best I have
been able to come up with is that Dad was not a well educated man with
a very limited income.&nbsp; Because of this, he could not have moved
his family if he wanted to.&nbsp; Dad had to make the best of a bad
situation and did not want any adverse publicity.&nbsp; Consequently,
he forbid anyone in the family to talk about the haunting.&nbsp; Dad
did not want to admit what was going on in his home.&nbsp; His way of
dealing with all this was to rationalize that it was an old man that
lived by himself just down the street.&nbsp; Dad always said that the
elderly man would become disoriented and use the house as a short
cut.&nbsp; Until the day he passed away, dad never acknowledged the
ghost.<br>
The house was struck by a tornado on March 13, 2006.&nbsp; I would be
glad to answer any questions, also I still have two brothers that can

Unexplained Breathing<br>
<br>

I am a big believer in ghosts. I'm only thirteen and currently live
with my mom but i think my dad's house is haunted. I woke in the middle
of the night one day and after about a half hour still didn't get to
sleep. it was then that i heard a heavy breathing in one of my ears. I
shot up and looked around, I thought maybe it was my dad who slept a
few rooms away from me. i got up and went to his room, still believing
there was an explanation. his door was closed. I thought it was
strange, but I wasn't too scared so I tried to get back to sleep. after
a little while a got a book and started to read because this always
puts me right out. after a little reading I heard the breathing again.
this time I remained lying down, I was too scared to even move. my
hands were shaking like crazy. I put my hands together and began to
prey. about half way through my prayer I heard it again. I jumped out
of bed and my foot got caught in the metal bed frame. I fell and got a
huge cut. I kept on running to my dad's room and burst open the door.
he asked me what happened and I began to explain. I showed him my cut
and then cleaned it up. <br>
the next morning he told me that heard this sound before too.&nbsp; <br>

Large House by the Park<br>
<br>

I lived in MT for 12 years. I moved to a house on Main St. down by the
city park. The house was a large house with 4 bedrooms and 1 and a half
bathrooms. I had 6 children ranging from 8 to 1 years old. Things
started happening almost as soon as we moved in. The boys ( 5 of them)
got the bedroom up stairs. I hated going up the stairs to the room. I
had a bad feeling when ever I would start up the stairs. When you got
up stairs to the room itself it was a very uncomfortable feeling. A
feeling of evil and dread. I just figured it was me so I never said
anything to my husband at that time. The children and I were down
stairs within that first week watching T.V. when the light in the
living room started turning itself off and on. I went over to the plug
in to see if maybe it might have a short. Everything seemed fine. It
finally stopped. Then the T.V. started turning itself off and on. The
older kids were a little creeped out but I told them that&nbsp; it was
a older home that we moved into and it might have some electrical
problems. When my husband came home I told him about the wiring
problems. He had a friend who an electrician and asked him to come over
and check the wiring. His friend said everything was good. Well my
husband acted like me and the kids made up the lights and T.V. episode.
Well it didnt take him long to become a believer. A couple of nights
later he was home and the whole family were in the livingroom watching
T.V.. While we were watching T.V. the television started turning off
and on. My husband got up to check the T.V.. He couldnt figure out what
was happening. I looked at him and told him that it was just his
imagination. He sayed that he now believed me and the kids. Well things
got really odd from there. My oldest son came down stairs into my
bedroom one night not long after the T.V. episode. He said that
something woke him up. He looked up and he saw a huge hand over his
head when he woke up. Nothing was attached to this hand. Just the
enormous hand. He was scared to death. He refused to ever sleep in that
room again. I would wake up at least twice a week in the middle of the
night to hearing a man with a deep voice calling my name. My daughter
had a room to her self and pictures and ribbons would constantly blow
when there was no breeze. I had a friend in the living room complain
one day that noone was around but someone was throwing things at him. I
had a girlfriend over one day and we were at the island in the kitchen.
The kids had just ate and I was cleaning up. I had told her about the
Ghost problems we were having. Of course she didnt believe in ghosts
until... While I was cleaning,&nbsp; a piece of crust from a piece of
bread got up and started dancing around on the island. She just froze.
She looked at me and said " Did you see that?" I told her yes that
stuff happens all the time here!" Nedless to say she left. I was never
scared of the "ghost" just of the upstairs bedroom. After my oldest
boy's problem with the hand in his room, he started sleeping in my room
or in the living room. Well him and his brother were sleeping one night
in the living room. Again he came running into my bedroom and woke me
up. This time he was crying. I asked him what was wrong and he said
that he was sleeping on 1 of the couches and his brother was on the
other one. He said something picked him up into the air and dropped him
back on the couch. He said he then saw a woman standing in the middle
of the living room. I asked him if he was alright&nbsp; and he said
hurry go get his brother.I said noway! Well nothing happened to his
brother that night. Odd and end things like this was now on a daily
bases. The last time I dealt with the ghost was when we were moving. I
got up one night to go to the bathroom. I went back into the bedroom
and it was totally dark in the room. All of a sudden about 30 beautiful
bluish white lights started traveling the wall. The lights were
diffrent sizes and shapes. The lights would grow bright and go dim at
diffrent times. They were so beautiful. That was my last time I saw the
ghost. I miss that house. I loved the house except for the upstairs
bedroom. I believed the ghost just wanted someone to know it was there.<br>

Weird Vacation<br>
<br>
By: tngurl2@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I was on vacation with my husband and son in June of 2006 at Palm
Shores Beach Resort (room 406) in Florida.&nbsp; The first night there
my 9 year old son had slept on a pull out in the living room area but
had a nightmare and ended up in bed with us the rest of the
vacation.&nbsp; About the 3rd night we were there I was having an odd
dream and woke suddenly, when I did I saw movement at the end of the
bed.&nbsp; I rubbed my eyes HARD cause I could not believe what I was
seeing...I shook my head HARD and looked around the room and it was
still there...I did this like 4 or five times and it was still
there.&nbsp; I looked around the room and at my husband and son to make
sure nothing was weird and I still wasn't asleep.&nbsp; What I saw was
something TOTALLY black and looked like a monk or something with a
hood.&nbsp; When I first woke up it backed up to the door that went
into the living room area.&nbsp; After about my 2nd head shake and eye
rubbing it looked like it was trying to hide and peep around the door
facing...I was totally perplexed. (Maybe it thought I was nuts cause I
am now shaking my head and rubbing my eyes so hard that I know I looked
crazy)&nbsp; The whole time I kept shaking my head really hard trying
to shake some sense into myself but it was still there peeping..finally
I sat up pointed at it and said "Dude, I totally see you!"&nbsp; When I
did this it just slid backwards in total view again, put its hands in
front (like maybe in pockets) and turned toward the patio and went that
way (not like walking, more like gliding.)&nbsp; At one point between
all the shaking and rubbing, when I first sat upright it did seem to
straighten its hood, but I couldn't see anything but black, no eyes or
face)&nbsp; My husband jumped up when I said that and ran into the
living room.&nbsp; The logical way for anyone to run would have been
toward the door out but my husband went directly in the living room and
toward the patio.&nbsp; He came back and told me to sleep on the other
side of the bed and that was that.&nbsp; I was just confused and said
"huh, that was weird" and went back to bed.&nbsp; The next day sitting
at the pool I told my husband, "If I had a dream it was the most vivid
one I have ever had cause I know I was awake."&nbsp; Then he said, "I
didn't say anything last night cause I know you would be up all night,
but when I went into the living room I swear I saw the back of somebody
go across the decking and thru the wall."&nbsp; He had lived in a house
with spirits before and it didn't bother him, the whole thing just
confuses me.&nbsp; If anyone else has experienced anything at this
resort feel free to email me at tngurl2@yahoo.com for discussion.&nbsp;
It wasn't really a scarey experience...just weird and had me wondering
what the heck I had seen.<br>

The Fudge Road Incident<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp; cswallace86@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
The follow account I am presenting was witnessed by several other
people, along with myself and we were attempting to gather some
evidence of the bridge&#8217;s activity.<br>
Several nights during the month of March 05, a group of friends and I
went out to a small town out in the Preble County Ohio called Gratis.
We had heard the stories about the mysterious Fudge Road Bridge and its
haunting, so we decided to check it out for ourselves. The first couple
of nights were somewhat uneventful, only hearing a few strange sounds
coming from the creek below. It wasn&#8217;t until the fourth and fifth night
out when we found the really creepy stuff. On the beginning of the
fourth night, we had arrived, got our sound recorder and digital camera
out, and placed our digital recorder on the edge of the bridge with the
mike hanging over the edge. One of comrades, who happened to be more
sensitive to the spirits there, told was where to take the pictures.
Several pictures revealed what looked to be orbs but they were
explainable: it was lightly raining and the water droplets where caught
by the flash. One, however, scared the living daylights out of us after
we got back to my buddy&#8217;s house. Unlike the last few times, we actually
went under the bridge and that&#8217;s when more stuff started happening. All
of us kept getting uneasy, as if something was standing close by
watching us, but we couldn&#8217;t here them; also, the sound of footsteps
were heard in the creek not too far from where we were. We quickly got
freaked out, bolted for the car. As for that picture: when we got home,
we uploaded the picture to my friend&#8217;s computer and enhanced the image
with Photoshop (brighten the image) and right there in the middle of
the bridge was a figure, which was semi-transparent. A light source
from a house not too far off the bridge was behind it and the outer
&#8216;halo&#8217; of the light could be seen over its right shoulder. One of my
friends asked if I had been in front of my buddy taking the picture. I
told him I was behind him, just like everyone else. Thinking of that
still gives me goose bumps.<br>
The fifth night was a little crazier than the previous night. This
time, we didn&#8217;t really take any samples of noises from the creek or
pictures, but we felt and heard some interesting stuff. At the curve
before the bridge, is a little trail leading to a field not far off the
road, so we took the opportunity to explore it. Again, our friend who
could sense the spirits led the way. Further down, he told us to stop
and listen. I held my breath and listened intently. Suddenly, the
sounds of footsteps were walking along the creek bed, which was right
along where we were standing. The steps came closer and closer, until
they stopped right in front of me and another friend of mine. That&#8217;s
when we decided to take our leave. <br>
Both nights, we got the feeling of something not wanting us around, and
at the end of the 4th night, I got really nauseous and tired all of a
sudden. I felt like I&#8217;d been drained of energy and a few of the guys
felt the same as I did. On the 5th night, I again felt drained but not
nearly as bad as I had been the night before. If any readers from the
southwest part of Ohio get the inkling to go check it out, my advice is
not to. The Police there don&#8217;t take kindly to people standing around on
the public bridge, and natives aren&#8217;t very friendly. If you plan on
going however, be careful and don&#8217;t go alone. <br>

Unexplained Experience<br>
<br>
By: p.viswanathan@gmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My name&#8217;s PV and I&#8217;m a resident of Mumbai (previously known as Bombay),
India. I&#8217;ve been going through many of the experiences posted on this
site and I thought of posting my own too. <br>
I live with my parents in a medium-sized 2 bedroom-hall-kitchen
apartment in the heart of the city. I&#8217;ve only had a few experiences,
one of which was really weird. It was about 1998-99 when this happened.
One evening at bedtime, I retired to my room (situated right next to
the master bedroom) and closed the door behind me. It must have been
just a few minutes after I lay down, that the most terrifying sound I
had ever heard, came from my parents&#8217; room, just next to my father&#8217;s
side of the bed. I don&#8217;t think words can describe the horrible sound &#8211;
it was like someone was heaving heavily, producing gritting and
grinding sounds (maybe something close to a werewolf, if such a thing
ever exists!).<br>
I immediately sprang into action and rushed to their room to enquire
what went wrong. Strangely, my Mom had woken up hearing the same sound,
at the same time, in the same location, with the same ferocity, but
Father had heard nothing! The funny thing was that it t was only those
few seconds that got really scary &#8211; both Mom and me were completely
calm after that and I went back in to my room and slept peacefully that
night. <br>
The story doesn&#8217;t end here. This noise continued several times and
occurred only at nights, though it kept reducing in intensity each
subsequent time. Both me and my Mom heard it each time. Mother even
kept coming to the living room to check out the source (neither she nor
I are the ones that can be easily rattled), but of course, could never
do so, as there was never anyone there. She heard the sound coming from
behind her, as though following her, but it had already started getting
faint by then. I sometimes could sense a &#8216;foreign presence&#8217; at home,
though I never once got scared of it. <br>
One of my cousins came visiting a few weeks later and stayed the night
with his daughter. He looked really freaked out the next morning and
talked of having heard the heaving and grinding sounds, just as we did
(we had never told him about these incidents)! He got even more
startled when we told him the entire story. Father still thinks it was
only our hyperactive imagination that caused us to hear these sounds -
he is a skeptic and has never once heard them.<br>
The sound kept fading out more and more and eventually stopped
altogether in a few weeks&#8217; time. Nothing else has happened since and we
continue to lead normal lives after that incident. There have been many
tragic deaths in my family in the past and I tend to think their
spirits might be trapped in our world and are actually trying to appeal
for help. I make it a point to pray for these souls every single night
&#8211; I don&#8217;t know what else I can do. <br>
This post got much longer than expected. Thank you very much for your
time. You&#8217;re welcome to send me an email if you have anything
interesting to say on this subject.<br>
