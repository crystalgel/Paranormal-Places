<b><font size=+1>Loon Lake cemetery in Minnesota.</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: mtallman@ncn.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;The loon Lake cemetery has long been rumored to be haunted
by the Ghost of a Witch that was buried there.&nbsp; Legend of this haunting
is generally passed along by word of mouth.&nbsp; Visitors can find the
way to Loon Lake cemetery by asking just about anyone who resides in the
Spirit Lake, Iowa region.</b>
<br><b>Or, you can follow my directions:&nbsp; Heading north out of Spirit
Lake, Ia. on highway 276 drive across the minnesota border until you come
to a " T " intersection @ the stop sign turn right heading east.&nbsp;
Drive along Loon Lake's southern shore, on the S.E. corner of the lake
you'll see a sign for Brown's Campgrounds turn in their lane.&nbsp; Drive
past the office and through the gate.&nbsp; Just inside the gate you'll
see a short driveway to the right, park your car there. Traveling on foot
follow the posted sign that directs you to a mowed grass path that leads
to the cemetery.&nbsp; Walking approx. 1/2 mile inland along the path you'll
see&nbsp; the cemetery perched on the top of a small knoll.&nbsp; The cemetery
over looks 3 small marsh ponds,&nbsp; the surrounding prairie wetlands,
and the senic rolling hills of the region.The cemetery in it's conception
was certainly a beautiful spot creating a peaceful lovely resting place
for it's residents.&nbsp; Most of whom are from the mid to late 1800's
and early 1900's.&nbsp; There are several graves of infants nestled in
family plots.&nbsp; You'll find approx. 2 dozen graves scattered across
this site.&nbsp; Most of the tomb stones have been knocked over by previous
visitors or vandals.&nbsp; Finding which grave belongs to the witch is
pretty much</b>
<br><b>anyone's guess.&nbsp; While I was there I didn't experience any
of the rumored haunting events.&nbsp; I was not covered in " Ticks " (
but I did choose a 40 degree day to insure there would be no " Ticks "
),I felt no foreboding urgency to leave the cemetery, and my vehcile started
up just fine when I decided to leave.&nbsp; The only strange thing that
has occurred to me regarding the Loon Lake Cemetery is that every time
I try to post this story on a Paranormal</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;website, the computer says the website can not be accessed,
the web page can not be found, or that the web page can not be displayed.&nbsp;
I'm beginning to suspect that a spell has been cast on me to prevent me
from telling this story, and revealing it's easy to find location.&nbsp;
That could explain why the location is generally found out by word of mouth.&nbsp;
If you're in the Iowa Lakes' Region be sure to check out the Loon Lake
Cemetery.&nbsp; It can be an eerie place to go to, but I doubt any harm
will come to you or yours if go there to visit.</b>
<br><b>Go and enjoy yourself !</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>My Ghost Stories</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LKJG@worldnet.att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story or stories as the case maybe are not all that extrodanary.
I</b>
<br><b>have seen and felt things that still give me the shivers.&nbsp;
I lived in a</b>
<br><b>duplex near a park about 2 years ago.&nbsp; Late one night I went
for a walk.</b>
<br><b>During this walk I went to an area of the park near an old stone
bridge</b>
<br><b>that was concealed in a thick it of trees.&nbsp; In this area I
had a</b>
<br><b>horrible feeling of fear. I could not figure this out because there
was</b>
<br><b>nothing there but me and a bunch of trees. Then I felt a presents
that I</b>
<br><b>truly felt was a woman. She was young and very scared. I also had
the</b>
<br><b>feeling of being chased. I ran home very very fast. I ran in the
house</b>
<br><b>and locked the door. Then after that I heard someone walking up
and down</b>
<br><b>the stairs late at night.&nbsp; I moved about a year after that
happend I had</b>
<br><b>to move. Not because of the sprit it was time to go.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have many many more stories. I seem to be a magnet for strange</b>
<br><b>happenings.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Grandma's Cat</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PortilloRodas@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This story is about my grandma's cat.</b>
<br><b>My grandma used to have alot of cats. She had a yellow and white
named Malo.</b>
<br><b>Weare a Spanish family. I used to love that cat we play all the
time. He was so</b>
<br><b>beautiful.Years pass the cat became old and didn't play with him
all the time,because</b>
<br><b>my grandma had a new cat named Chispita. One day I was coming home
from</b>
<br><b>school and my aunt was outside looking for Malo. Well days pass
and the cat</b>
<br><b>didn't comehome. My grandma and my aunt told me Malo is died. I
was sad and hurt that</b>
<br><b>day.When I told my brother he was sad too. A couple days later me
and brother were</b>
<br><b>playing inside the house. We were not allow to. Just then I was
about to</b>
<br><b>throw the ball to my brother. I saw my grandma cat! He was there.
He was running toward</b>
<br><b>me and then disapper. I told my brother and he believe me. I didn't
my mom or my</b>
<br><b>dad,or my aunt or my grandma. My brother told me maybe because he
wanted to see us</b>
<br><b>one more. He was right. Three years later my family moved to a new
house. And</b>
<br><b>I didn't saw Malo again.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Indian Houseguest</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Thiscatspad@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Friends have often told me that I was sensitive to the "spirit world".&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>earliest experiences were when I was around two, and waking up in
the middle</b>
<br><b>of the night to see a shadow of a woman standing in front of my
closet, never</b>
<br><b>moving and always in the same place.&nbsp; I would just go back
to sleep, thinking</b>
<br><b>it was the outline of the tree outside my window.</b><b></b>
<p><b>However, as I grew older my experiences became more refined.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first</b>
<br><b>experience I had with a moving object was in my early twenties.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>cooking dinner in the kitchen when the lid of the pot moved across
the</b>
<br><b>stovetop.&nbsp;&nbsp; A little unsettled, I thought there must have
been a suction</b>
<br><b>created from the moisture gathered underneath the lid, but when
I went to</b>
<br><b>pick up the lid it deliberately moved away from me and continued
to do so</b>
<br><b>until I trapped it.&nbsp; The apartment building I was living in
was built in the</b>
<br><b>early 1920's, so that experience could easily have been that of
spirit,</b>
<br><b>however, without proof or any regular occurance I shrugged it off.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Several years later I would experience something that I could not
shrug off,</b>
<br><b>and had to learn to accept this strange gift God had given me.&nbsp;
I was in my</b>
<br><b>late twenties and had recently moved to Houston.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
day I signed the lease</b>
<br><b>on my apartment should have been the first warning, but I ignored
it.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>leasing agent was showing my father and I various available apartments,
there</b>
<br><b>was one inpaticular that looked appealing that the agent said was
being</b>
<br><b>cleaned and was not ready to show.&nbsp; I asked her if we could
see it anyway,</b>
<br><b>she stated that the layout was the same as the last apartment we
saw and</b>
<br><b>because it was being "prepared" it was not available for view.&nbsp;
The leasing</b>
<br><b>agent was not facing the apartment, but both my father and myself
saw a</b>
<br><b>person peering out at us through the window.&nbsp; I asked her if
the apartment</b>
<br><b>was occupied and she said no.&nbsp; There was noone in the apartment
and the</b>
<br><b>working crew was not scheduled to start on the apartment till the
following</b>
<br><b>week.&nbsp; Dad and I thought she was misguided, so I decided to
take that</b>
<br><b>apartment.</b><b></b>
<p><b>A couple of weeks later I moved to Houston with a couple of my friends,
I was</b>
<br><b>so excited because this was the nicest complex I had ever lived
in.&nbsp; I opened</b>
<br><b>the front door of my beautiful apartment that was freezing cold
(it was in</b>
<br><b>the 90's outside).&nbsp; I checked the themameter which read 76
degrees.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>friends hated the apartment and could wait to get out.&nbsp; I thought
something</b>
<br><b>was wrong with the air conditioner.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks
the apartment</b>
<br><b>would go from extremely cold to extremely hot.&nbsp; Finally, a
repairman came in</b>
<br><b>and said something strangely wrong with the unit.&nbsp; He did some
repairs and</b>
<br><b>everything seemed normal again.&nbsp; Normal, except for the fact
that I couldn't</b>
<br><b>sleep at night unless the bedroom closet door remained open.&nbsp;
The apartment</b>
<br><b>gave me an uneasy feeling.&nbsp; My cat (who is sane) was constantly
fighting with</b>
<br><b>the air, something he had never done before.&nbsp; My friends thought
my cat was</b>
<br><b>going insane.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night when I was coming home late from rehearsal I noticed as
came upon</b>
<br><b>my apartment that a light was on inside and there was a very distinct
figure</b>
<br><b>staring back at me through the window.&nbsp; I thought someone had
broken into my</b>
<br><b>apartment, but by the time I made it up the stairs to confront the
intruder</b>
<br><b>the apartment was dark.&nbsp; There was only one way and one way
out of the</b>
<br><b>apartment, through the front door.&nbsp; But that night when I opened
up the door</b>
<br><b>there was noone in the apartment anywhere, and believe me I checked
every</b>
<br><b>nook and cranny.&nbsp; Now I thought I was going crazy, the cat
was still fighting</b>
<br><b>with the air, and I still felt very uncomfortable if the closet
door in the</b>
<br><b>bedroom was closed, ever.</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few months later, after returning from another late night reherearsal,
I</b>
<br><b>was given the opportunity to meet the ghost that was sharing my
apartment.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was very tired and it was almost midnight when I got home.&nbsp;
I was brushing my</b>
<br><b>teeth in the open space part of the bathroom which paralleled the
hallway.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>looked up in the mirror to see a huge Indian standing almost directly
behind</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I remember saying (with a mouth full of toothpaste), "...either
your an</b>
<br><b>appirition or I'm in big trouble" and laughed nervously.&nbsp; I
studied him very</b>
<br><b>carefully in the mirror, thinking I was just about to get raped,
when I</b>
<br><b>noticed that he did move, his body, his face, his eyes - nothing
moved.&nbsp; Nor</b>
<br><b>could I see anything beyond what was visible directly in the mirror.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>not about ready to turn around in case he was a living, breathing
rapist.</b>
<br><b>Then I noticed his hair, he had long hair and was feather down the
side.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>then confronted him, that he did not know English and could tell
he didn't a</b>
<br><b>word I said.&nbsp; I then started calling out names of tribes and
got a my</b>
<br><b>reaction with "Choctaw".&nbsp; I saw how he died at that the hand
of a white</b>
<br><b>soldier and how humiliating that was for him, he was proud Indian
and me, a</b>
<br><b>white woman, had moved into his space.&nbsp; I put my head down
for a second and</b>
<br><b>when I looked back in the mirror he was gone, all I heard was sound
of bells,</b>
<br><b>the sound of the closet door opening and shutting.&nbsp; When I
went to look for</b>
<br><b>him I found nothing.&nbsp; All this happened in less than five minutes.</b>
<br><b>Afterwards I was ready to check myself into a mental hospital.&nbsp;
It was a</b>
<br><b>friend that explained to me that I was not crazy, their were many
Slave and</b>
<br><b>Indian gravesites in Houston, many of which were descrated for the
sake of</b>
<br><b>urban development.</b><b></b>
<p><b>These episodes continued to occur frequently, even though I never
the ghost</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; That summer, I went out of state for an extended period.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>having a friend watch the apartment.&nbsp; That lasted all of a
week.&nbsp; The first</b>
<br><b>time she came to check on the apartment she stated that it was very
cold,</b>
<br><b>although it was a 100 degrees outside, and that there seemed to
be a very</b>
<br><b>hostile presence in the apartment, one that told she was not welcome
and to</b>
<br><b>get out.&nbsp; She called me in the middle of the night, crying
uncontrollably</b>
<br><b>saying that she could not go back in the apartment.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I returned, it was for a very short period as I was taking another</b>
<br><b>apartment in the same complex with a roomate.&nbsp; My father was
with me once</b>
<br><b>again to help in moving.&nbsp; One evening while I was cleaning
up dishes in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen my father called out to me..."Are saying something to me?,"
he</b>
<br><b>stated.&nbsp; I told him that I was not talking at all.&nbsp; His
voice was strange as</b>
<br><b>he said, "There is a man sitting next to me, he is talking to me,
but I don't</b>
<br><b>know what he is saying..."&nbsp; I looked at him in the living room,
but there was</b>
<br><b>noone else there, and the cat was fighting with the air.&nbsp; I
told my father</b>
<br><b>that it was the Indian, and that he was mad, but that he could not
hurt him.</b>
<br><b>If Dad ignored him he would go away.&nbsp; I then told the Indian
that it was my</b>
<br><b>apartment too, and he had to learn to share, and finally to leave
my father</b>
<br><b>and cat alone.&nbsp; One week later I moved out.</b><b></b>
<p><b>All those months, and all those episodes where cat fought with the
air, paid</b>
<br><b>off in one single photo.&nbsp; It was a sunny afternoon, and I was
playing catch</b>
<br><b>with a wad of paper and my cat (his favorite game).&nbsp; I would
throw the wad of</b>
<br><b>paper, the cat would go after it and bring it back to me.&nbsp;
I was taking some</b>
<br><b>photos of this particular game when I noticed that the cat suddenly
backed</b>
<br><b>away from the wad of paper.&nbsp; I shot the picture quickly, what
resulted was a</b>
<br><b>photo of my cat tentatively backing away from a large filmy shape.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>had some photo experts, although none were paranormal experts, that
said the</b>
<br><b>strange streaks in the film cannot be explained by any normal photo</b>
<br><b>technology.&nbsp; I now refer to this picture affectionately, as
the picture of my</b>
<br><b>ghost.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Invisible Neighbor</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lauren.M.Searle-1@ou.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am currently a freshman at the University of Oklahoma and I live
in</b>
<br><b>the dorms on campus.&nbsp; The building I live in is one of the
four original</b>
<br><b>dormitories built in the late 40s-early fifties.&nbsp; There are
many</b>
<br><b>disturbing stories regarding the history of this campus, from fatal</b>
<br><b>fires to deadly accidents.&nbsp; One of these incidences occurred
in my dorm</b>
<br><b>building, on my floor. I didn't hear of this accident prior to making
my</b>
<br><b>housing arrangements, which is probably a good thing, since I would
have</b>
<br><b>undoubtedly chosen to live elsewhere and thus, would have missed
the</b>
<br><b>opportunity to meet a very unusual friend.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first incident I had with Sarah occurred
one night back in</b>
<br><b>August, not long after fall semester started.&nbsp; My roommate
and I were in</b>
<br><b>our room, talking with a few other girls in our hall, getting to
know</b>
<br><b>each other and sharing funny stories of our first few weeks at college.</b>
<br><b>I am a magazine freak and we were all sort of absent-mindedly leafing</b>
<br><b>through some of them while we were talking, with a few of them still</b>
<br><b>scattered on the floor.&nbsp; None of us were really paying much
attention to</b>
<br><b>anything outside our conversation until one of the girls, who had
been</b>
<br><b>sitting on the floor, suddenly shrieked, lept up, and backed into
the</b>
<br><b>corner of our room, her eyes fixated on one of the magazines on
the</b>
<br><b>floor.&nbsp; Needless to say, we were all startled and thought she
must have</b>
<br><b>seen a bug or something on the floor and started looking around
for it.</b>
<br><b>It was then that we all sort of simultaneously saw what it was about
the</b>
<br><b>magazine that had scared our friend so much.&nbsp; It was lying
on the floor,</b>
<br><b>open, with the pages slowly turning, not as if it was being blown
by</b>
<br><b>wind, since there was none, but like someone invisible to us was
sitting</b>
<br><b>on the floor, looking through the pages.&nbsp; We were all trembling
as we</b>
<br><b>watched it in horrified fascination.&nbsp; Finally, my roommate,
who was</b>
<br><b>thoroughly freaked out by this time, kicked the magazine across
the</b>
<br><b>floor, where it slid into the wall and laid there motionless.&nbsp;
When we</b>
<br><b>could finally speak, we all agreed that we should go find the RA</b>
<br><b>(resident advisor) and tell her what had happened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We found her in her room and brought her back
up to our room, as if</b>
<br><b>the crumpled magazine against the wall would be some sort of proof
of</b>
<br><b>what we saw.&nbsp; Before we even finished telling her what had
happened, she</b>
<br><b>just smiled and laughed a little and told us that we had just been</b>
<br><b>introduced to Sarah, a girl who had lived and who ultimately died
just a</b>
<br><b>few rooms down from ours (incidentally, her room is now used as
a study</b>
<br><b>lounge).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently Sarah had lived in these dorms shortly
after they were</b>
<br><b>completed in 1950.&nbsp; She was popular and had made friends with
the other</b>
<br><b>girls on her floor.&nbsp; They would all congregate in one of their
rooms</b>
<br><b>late at night to engage in girl talk, help each other study and,
yes,</b>
<br><b>they were very fond of magazines.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Sarah also
had a very</b>
<br><b>possessive boyfriend.&nbsp; One warm fall evening, they were in
Sarah's room</b>
<br><b>and he was apparently accusing her of flirting with a male friend
she</b>
<br><b>had.&nbsp; Sarah fervently denied it but he wouldn't believe her,
and her</b>
<br><b>denial only made him more angry.&nbsp; Angry to the point of pushing
her out</b>
<br><b>her open window 3 floors to the ground below.&nbsp; Ever since then,
girls</b>
<br><b>living in our building, on our floor, have reported strange things</b>
<br><b>happening in their rooms.&nbsp; Nothing mean or harmful, just things
like our</b>
<br><b>magazine experience, jars with hair-pins in them spilled out on
the</b>
<br><b>counter, textbooks "borrowed" for a day and returned to the exact
spot</b>
<br><b>they'd been missing from the next morning, one girl a few years
ago even</b>
<br><b>returned to her room after a full day of classes to find a half-played</b>
<br><b>game of solitaire sitting on her desk.&nbsp; Since she didn't have
a roommate</b>
<br><b>and no one had broken in, it was concluded that Sarah was the mystery</b>
<br><b>card-player.&nbsp; She has even been helpful to some of us before.&nbsp;
For</b>
<br><b>intance, one girl in our hall says that she had left her window
open</b>
<br><b>when she left for class one morning.&nbsp; By the afternoon, when
she headed</b>
<br><b>back to the dorm, it was pouring rain and she was hurrying to get
back</b>
<br><b>to shut her window.&nbsp; When she opened her door, she found that
her</b>
<br><b>windows had been closed.&nbsp; Of course, it could be argued that
she closed</b>
<br><b>them before she left and just forgot about it.&nbsp; However, there
were a</b>
<br><b>few drops of water sitting in the window-sill, as if the windows
had</b>
<br><b>been closed shortly after it started raining, when the only person</b>
<br><b>living there was halfway across campus in class.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one really minds Sarah being here.&nbsp; All
of us on our floor sort</b>
<br><b>of welcome her.&nbsp; And if she ever "shows up" when we don't want
her to,</b>
<br><b>we just ask her to leave and she does - peacefully.&nbsp; Perhaps,
in</b>
<br><b>whatever realm of time she's in, she is still living and is merely</b>
<br><b>visiting the friends she made 50 years ago in the same exact rooms
we</b>
<br><b>now live in.&nbsp; Or perhaps she's just a friendly spirit who wants
to</b>
<br><b>welcome a bunch of uncertain girls into their first year of college.</b>
<br><b>Either way, thank you Sarah.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>The Ghost of Smith Castle</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jokerman246@texoma.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I live by Bonham Texas in North Texas. In the early 1900's
I had a granddad who built a castle for his fiancee. Around&nbsp; that
time, they had a couple of servants. Two of them were Sara and John. My
grandmother kept a diary of her life with her husband and wrote everything
down. I read the diary about a month ago. I read that Sara had been found
dead in the horses stables one morning by John. No one knew how she had
died, but i think that her ghost was kept in my grandmother's diary, and
when i opened it, her ghost was released. I live on one of the upper floors,
the 3rd floor. I have a window that looks out over the stables and one
night while i was reading the</b>
<br><b>diary, i heard the horses start to make racket. I looked out there.
By the moonlight, i saw a women running for the stables. She had on a long
black dress and a white apron. I didnt know who or what it was, i hadnt
got that far in the diary. i kept a lookout on the stables all night and
never saw anyone come out of the stables. That morning, i checked out the
stables. A gate was opened. Now, Sara, has been "playing". She locked my
parents in their room. She ripped up my homework when we had went to go
eat out. She breaks stuff. She tears stuff. She also likes to "play" in
the attic, which is right above me. She will stomp and drop things. She
turns out lights.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;moves things. open windows. turn out fires. I have seen her
in the act, sort of. I woke up to somthing droping one night. I went to
the room where i thougtht it broke, although i was semi-asleep, i saw Sara
throw something. She looked at me. I couldnt keep my eyes off of her. She
whispered something. Then, she disappeared. I have tried to talk to her,
but she will not say anything. I still dont know whats so important about
the stables. and i still dont know how she died.</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Christmas Nightmare</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: finleyb@blountk12.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Christmas Eve I was 10 (1993), I dreamt
that I was in the</b>
<br><b>living room with all my family, only instead of celebrating we were</b>
<br><b>holding a wake.&nbsp; The tree &amp; everything were still up, but
in the center</b>
<br><b>of the room there was a casket.&nbsp; I kept asking who had died,
but no one</b>
<br><b>would answer me.&nbsp; When I woke up, I pretty much forgot the
dream during</b>
<br><b>the excitement of opening presents.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, when I was at my dad's, I noticed
my grandma looked kind of</b>
<br><b>upset.&nbsp; After she left my dad told me my great-grandfather
(her father)</b>
<br><b>had died earlier that day.&nbsp; So in a way my nightmare had come

<p><b>My name is Jordan I am at my grandpas house. The other day my</b>
<br><b>friend Sophie and I were at her house sitting on her kitchen floor
when</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden the power went out, but only for about 1 min. Then</b>
<br><b>Sophie saw something in the hall mirror. About 5 min.s later we
all (me</b>
<br><b>Sophie and Sophies little sister Kelsey) heard heavy foot falls
coming</b>
<br><b>down the stairs, but nobody else was in the house. We fled out the
door,</b>
<br><b>leaving it open a little bit, so we could get back in if we needed
to.</b>
<br><b>When we came back in after about 1 hour the T.V. was on a different</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Ghost Experiances</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: whatevergirl75@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello. My freind and I have had many ghost experiances.
When I was little I would wake up in the middle of the night and heard
voices. It&nbsp; was a man and a woman. Just a few weeks ago I heard them
again. One day I was siting on my mom's bed and the hall closet door was
open. I was looking at it and I saw a little peice of a skirt or a dress
come out. It was almost invisible. Another time I was sitting up in my
bed and I saw a woman standing and then sitting on my mom's bed. She was
pure white. I beleive the man is my dead uncle. He loved my mom very</b>
<br><b>much.&nbsp; My freind and her sister have had many ghosts experiances
also. Her name came from a famly&nbsp; freinds name. She was killed by
a drunk driver. When her sister was little her mom saw her poking at something.
She asked what she was doing. She replied" You made the lady go away."
There was nobody else in the room with her. When she was older she was
looking in a mirror she saw someone. When my freind would go to sleep she
would hear chains moving in the attic. As if someone was there. She does
not live their any more.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>THE HOUSE THAT HATED LITTLE GIRLS !</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: beverly38@peoplepc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I,am 62 years old and when I was alittle girl of 7 I would go to
Canada to stay at my Grandmothers farm house that looked like a stone manshon
. I loved the farm ,the animals, Grandmas flower garden, the&nbsp; smells
&amp; unspoied nature. When Grandpa &amp; Grandma would get up early and
leave me in the house sleeping&nbsp; to milk the cows&nbsp; I would wake
up with a sence of&nbsp; fear that there was something evil&nbsp; in the
house and leap down the stairs screaming and crying out to the barn. They
would say your just a scary cat. My mother who&nbsp; is 91 told me that</b>
<br><b>when she was raise in that&nbsp; house she felt the same way I did
she still will not stay in that house alone. The house got sold many times
and was&nbsp; slowely falling in disaray. Then someone bought it and wanted
to restore to it once stately stature, so they contacted my mother,while
my mother was helping by giving information on what the house use to look
like the lady said ,"You know I have a terrible time with my little girl
she is&nbsp; scared to death of this house, I have fix her bedroom up with
lovely things and nothing helps." My mother looked at me and then we both
realize&nbsp; at once there is something evil in that house because here
is someone that we don't know that makes three</b>
<br><b>generation of little girls feel the same way, It does not affect
any boys rased in the house only little girls. So I guess I wasn't a scary
cat after all.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Was This a Dream, or Did It Really Happen??</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Windit53@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandmother, who passed away in 1990, told
me this story about 20</b>
<br><b>years ago, and I can still remember the chills that ran down my
spine after</b>
<br><b>she told me...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1958, my grandfather died suddenly of a massive
heart attack.&nbsp; He was</b>
<br><b>at home&nbsp; in bed at the time, and he actually died in my grandmother's
arms.</b>
<br><b>My grandmother, who was totally devoted to and dependent of my grandfather,</b>
<br><b>was extremely devasted by his sudden passing.&nbsp; Several days
after my</b>
<br><b>grandfather had died, my grandmother had this "dream".&nbsp; In
her dream, she was</b>
<br><b>restless and couldn't sleep, so she decided to get up and go to
the kitchen</b>
<br><b>for a glass of milk to help her fall asleep.&nbsp; She walked down
the staircase,</b>
<br><b>which was in the center of the house, and for some reason, when
she reached</b>
<br><b>the bottom of the staircase, instead of turning left, which would
have led</b>
<br><b>her to the kitchen, she turned right, which led into the living
room.&nbsp; Upon</b>
<br><b>entering the living room, she saw my grandfather over by the fireplace,
with</b>
<br><b>his arm resting on the mantle.&nbsp; He smiled at her and said "You
thought you</b>
<br><b>lost me, didn't you?"&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandmother swore that this
was dream, but I have</b>
<br><b>to wonder if, in fact, she really did see my grandfather, and he
was telling</b>
<br><b>her that he was still with her.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Strange Stairs</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Philcathy101897@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When i was about 5, my parents lived with my dad's sister and her
family in</b>
<br><b>this two story house in cicero, il.&nbsp; there was five kids to
one room. we were all between</b>
<br><b>the ages of 2-6. our bedroom door did not have a doorknob on it
and had to be jimmied with a</b>
<br><b>butter knife.well earlier my older brother was playing with it and
my mom just happened to</b>
<br><b>be coming up the stairs he threw it across the floor and it stopped
just</b>
<br><b>under the window sill. that night i remember not being able to sleep
so i</b>
<br><b>turned on the night light and started to play with some crazy eight
cards.</b>
<br><b>the door was wide open.&nbsp; suddenly behind the door came this
awful mean laugh.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the door slammed shut and the knife slid across the floor
and stuck in the</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; at first all i could do was stare at the door.&nbsp;
no one else was awake</b>
<br><b>and didn't see or hear anything.&nbsp; i finally got the courage
to get up and</b>
<br><b>open the door.&nbsp; i pulled the knife out of the door and opened
it.&nbsp; i don't</b>
<br><b>know why but i looked behind the door expecting to see who or what
had</b>
<br><b>laughed. nothing.&nbsp; i then went down to my parents room thinking
it was my dad</b>
<br><b>trying to scare me.&nbsp; they were both snoring away.&nbsp; i went
back to the room</b>
<br><b>and tried to go to sleep.&nbsp; on another occasion in the same
house, i can remember standing at the</b>
<br><b>top of the stairs holding on to the rail really tight and closing
my eyes. i</b>
<br><b>saw the staircase in front of me and something on the staircase
going down</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; when i opened my eyes i was at the bottom of the staircase,
still</b>
<br><b>holding on to the rail.&nbsp; i never mentioned anything to anyone
until i was about 13.&nbsp; i told my</b>
<br><b>mom both stories&nbsp; and she told me she also had an expierence
on the stairs</b>
<br><b>just like mine.&nbsp; she also told me that no one has been able
to stay at the</b>
<br><b>house very long.&nbsp; the last owner was a single man and&nbsp;
for no apparent reason</b>
<br><b>hung himself in the house.&nbsp; the only reason she is able to
know this is</b>
<br><b>because her best friends still live on the same block and she still
visits</b>
<br><b>them every weekend.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Grandmother's Music Box</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: comard@mindnet.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always been a little psychic, but this was by far the most
memorable thing to happen to me. When I was 14(I'm 17 now), my grandmother
died after a 7 year battle with cancer. I was with her in those final moments
and the loss hit me especially hard. I was her first granddaughter and
we had a special bond. She had always told me ghost stories and talked
about the afterlife. After her death, I wondered if I would hear from her
after she was gone. It was nearly two years after her death when this incident
occured. I was sleeping in bed when</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I awoke suddenly at 3a.m. As I came to my senses, I realized
that I heard music coming from the spare room across the hall(which I can
see from my bed). I laid there and listened for awhile and decided to finally
sit up. As soon as I was upright, the music stopped. And I don't mean the
music had winded down to a stop, it was playing full-force and then just
quit abruptly. It was then that I realized it was the music box that my
grandma had given me the christmas before she died. This terrified me and
I dove under the covers and laid there until</b>
<br><b>my alarm went off 3 hours later. I was still a little spooked when
I got up the next morning, but there was more to come. As I sat in my room
blow-drying my hair, I was looking in my mirror when the door to my room
swung open quickly. I immediately ran to the doorway to see if my mom or
dad had done it, but they were both downstairs. This really irked me, but
I soon heard a story that made me realize I wasn't alone. Apparently my
aunt had walked into her home a few months before to my grandmother's music
box playing on its own and just as my</b>
<br><b>music had done, it stopped abruptly just when she was about to touch
it. I guess that's my grandma's way of communicating with us. I just wish
she had decided to visit me during the day rather than in the dark at night!</b>
