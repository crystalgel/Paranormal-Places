<b><font size=+1>Hospital Ghost Story</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wbrison@rotech.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a Respiratory Therapist. While working graveyard shift in a
hospital on the Texas side of the Red River. I experienced what I feel
was a brush with the supernatural. R.T's help patients to breathe better.
But also to provide emergency care to bring them back from their visit
to Eternity and beyond.The Sixth floor of the hospital is where nursing
home patients and patients who are chronically ill or had un treatable
cancer where usually</b>
<br><b>admitted. If you talk to anybody who worked in the hospital there
would always be a room or a bed that seem to have an unlucky results for
those patients who were placed there. There was such a room on the sixth
floor.</b>
<br><b>After performing a code earlier on a patient whom passed on the
sixth floor. I was called to look at a patient in THE ROOM next to the
nurses station. The Patient was very elderly and seem very confused upon
first initial contact. While assessing the patient the patient was talking
in tongues and pledging her allegiance to the dark underworld of Satan.
This patient's arms were tied to her bed to prevent her from hurting her
self. The patient was frothing at the mouth and her eyes would roll behind
her head exposing only the white of her eyes. Needless to say</b>
<br><b>it was very unsettling. We left the patients room to look at the
patients chart when then the patient's call light went off in the patients
room numerous times that night. what was weird about it is that the patient
was unable to press it because her hands were tied up. Later that night
we coded the patient and she passed away and was moved to the funeral home
that morning. The next night I showed up for my shift again and was up
on the sixth floor talking to the nurses that took care of the patient
the night before. When the call light went off in the room that the patient
was in the night before. We turned on the light walked in to the empty
patient room and reset the pt call. The room felt unusually cold and still.
We returned to the nurses station when the call light went off again in
the same room , after resetting it again. We returned to the nurses station
when the EMERGENCY call light went off again. This</b>
<br><b>time the call box had been pulled out of the wall and was lying
on the ground. This was very unsettling because no person was in the room
and because of the close proximity of the room to the nurses station that
no-one could have done this without being seen. Maintenance was called
and found nothing unusual in the room. No patients were admitted to that
room that night.&nbsp; We assumed that the patient wanted us to know that
she was still around was not done scaring us. We looked at the time and
it was the same time we coded her the night before. After this happened
My senses were enhanced and the graveyard shift had a whole new meaning.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Many Youthful Experiences</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Czathomir@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was like nine or so, around Christmas,
I was in a bad mood. My dad</b>
<br><b>was at work, my mom and brother were in the kitchen. Nobody else
was there. I</b>
<br><b>was sitting on the staitrs, and I had this feeling to look behind
me. I saw</b>
<br><b>this tall, somewhat fat guy standing at the top of the stairs. He
didn't have</b>
<br><b>any feutures I could see, just all like a shadow. I ran into the
kitchen, and</b>
<br><b>din't&nbsp; see anything else for a while.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a year later, we were in the basement.
We went to a different</b>
<br><b>section for a minute, then a bit later we noticed someone wrote
"Simon" on</b>
<br><b>some drawing paper in orange pencil. It wasn't anyone in my family!
Then I</b>
<br><b>was like twelve, and I was up in my room. I heard a little kid talking,
I</b>
<br><b>couldn't hear the words, behind the wall my bed was against. I went
to my</b>
<br><b>brother's room to&nbsp; ask him to shut up. He wasn't there! I asked
my mom, he'd</b>
<br><b>been away since the morning! After that I heard steps and bumps
upstairs</b>
<br><b>often. After we got a dog, when she was upstairs, peacefull, often
she'd</b>
<br><b>suddenly get up and start barking like nuts. Then she'd run downstairs.</b>
<br><b>Occasionally, when I was outside, I would see odd shadows in my
room's window</b>
<br><b>and my stereo would turn on. It continued heavily for a while, then
stopped.</b>
<br><b>Those kinda things still happen occasionally.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Testing the Waters</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gangrel@bbc.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, a few years ago in Kentucky, I was
watching tv in my</b>
<br><b>bedroom. It was pretty dark except for the tv as the room was located
in</b>
<br><b>the basement, but I was wide awake. It started getting chilly. Chilly</b>
<br><b>enough to get bundled up. As I was wrapping myself up, I looked
over</b>
<br><b>toward the far wall, and a lady was walking toward me. (I get the
heebie</b>
<br><b>jeebies now just thinking about it). It scared me so much I made
that</b>
<br><b>noise you only hear in Hollywood movies, when you try to scream
but</b>
<br><b>inhale at the same time. She took three steps toward me (that's</b>
<br><b>important, I'll tell you why in just a minute) and vanished. Well,</b>
<br><b>vanished is a strong word. She faded out very quickly. She looked</b>
<br><b>thirtyish, shoulder length dark hair, and was wearing a blue dress
that</b>
<br><b>went to her ankles. A modern dress, as well as a modern hairstyle.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A soon as she faded out, an overwhelming sense
that she was sorry</b>
<br><b>totally engulfed me. And I thought to myself that I felt sad that
I</b>
<br><b>scared her off by my reaction. I've been (this is somewhat embarrassing</b>
<br><b>to say. I've always believed in sixth sense, paranormal, things
like</b>
<br><b>that. But I was a deputy at one time, and want to be a physicist
after I</b>
<br><b>get my Ph.D. These don't go well with paranormal.) sensitive to
things</b>
<br><b>since I was a child. I've gone to houses that made me nauseous just
to</b>
<br><b>be there, and sometimes certain rooms in some houses give me the</b>
<br><b>willies. But this was different. The feelings I got were all wrong.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a little research and found that ghosts
can send an olive</b>
<br><b>branch to a person. A ghost to test the waters for them, if you
will.</b>
<br><b>And I felt in that room that I was needed. I brought in a friend
to</b>
<br><b>help, and we tried EVP. We got nothing. We tried pictures and video,
and</b>
<br><b>still nothing. I was an idiot and tried Ouija (people, Parker Brothers</b>
<br><b>may make it, but it's as dangerous as a nuclear bomb. I recommend</b>
<br><b>against Ouija) and didn't have the thing move once. But something
flat</b>
<br><b>out told me that if I used it anymore, terror would only be the</b>
<br><b>beginning (I also felt that who I had contaced through the thing
wasn't</b>
<br><b>her). So I had no answers but what I felt. After a few weeks, 2
or 3 it</b>
<br><b>seems to me, the feeling that she was still around faded.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt this: she was supposed to test the waters,
and I failed the</b>
<br><b>test. There is a message out there I won't get. I felt that it was
a</b>
<br><b>message from a relative.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came through the wall of my bedroom. Her three
steps would have</b>
<br><b>put her right on top of me, but they didn't. Her third step put
her in</b>
<br><b>the middle of my room. The wall dissolved around her. Was it an
after</b>
<br><b>image from the TV on my retinas? No. I know what they are like.
So do</b>
<br><b>you. This was crystal clear, and her size would overlap the size
if the</b>
<br><b>tv screen from my position in the room. Between two eyes and the
TV, I</b>
<br><b>had fairly good parallax.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The room felt clean when when I moved in, and
a few short weeks</b>
<br><b>after this incident it felt clean. I never found out who she was,
but</b>
<br><b>I'll never forget her. Perhaps I'll get the chance to ask her face
to</b>
<br><b>face someday.</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>A Tale of Two Entities</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: katerrell@buckman.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I wrote to you about my grandfather's ghost, but thought you might
be one of</b>
<br><b>the few people who could appreciate the other "entities" that have
been part</b>
<br><b>of my life.</b>
<br><b>When I was a child, my mother's grandparents gave me an old brass
framed</b>
<br><b>bed. They'd rescued it from a burned down house in the country near
where</b>
<br><b>they lived, cleaned it up, painted it, and for years used it in
their guest</b>
<br><b>room.</b>
<br><b>I often got the strangest feeling that I wasn't alone in my bedroom,
but of</b>
<br><b>course no one else was there. I had the strongest belief that "whatever"
was</b>
<br><b>causing that sensation had something to do with that bed. It was
never</b>
<br><b>threatening; in fact, it was almost rather comforting. I tried to
tell my</b>
<br><b>mother about it, but she ascribed it to a bright child's overactive</b>
<br><b>imagination.</b>
<br><b>My dog, however, sensed it as well. There would often be the sound
of the</b>
<br><b>front door opening and closing (while in actuality, it had remained
locked</b>
<br><b>and closed), and she would wag her tail, obviously watching SOMETHING
go up</b>
<br><b>the stairs to my bedroom. Even my mother could not deny that there
was</b>
<br><b>something going on.</b>
<br><b>It was rather natural that I'd begin talking to this invisible "person".
It</b>
<br><b>was important to me to convince my mother that what I had described
as a</b>
<br><b>presence was real, and I told him I needed his help to do that.
He never</b>
<br><b>spoke to me, not even silently, but I got the feeling he was amused.
Hoping</b>
<br><b>for something tangible to show my mother, I called her into my room.
I had</b>
<br><b>some scarves and bandanas tied around the foot of the bed. With
my mother</b>
<br><b>watching, several of the scarves lifted, by themselves, and then
dropped</b>
<br><b>back into position.</b>
<br><b>The hair on my mother's arm stood straight up, her eyes grew round,
and she</b>
<br><b>left the room, complaining about my "convincing little trick". She</b>
<br><b>maintained that it had to have been a ruse of some kind.... but
after that,</b>
<br><b>she stopped treating me as if I were making up a story about the
presence</b>
<br><b>that came with my bed.</b>
<br><b>When I was a teenager, I became interested in occult and spiritual
topics. I</b>
<br><b>played around with what I thought was "magic" and inadvertently
summoned</b>
<br><b>something that was NOT pleasant. It brought with it the sensation
of being</b>
<br><b>watched, but it wasn't a comfortable feeling. This presence was
mildly</b>
<br><b>hostile, and the corner of my room where I would "sense" it would
be cold,</b>
<br><b>even though there was no breeze or vent near. A few times, looking
back at</b>
<br><b>that corner in my vanity mirror, I could have sworn I saw two glowing
blue</b>
<br><b>spot where eyes should have been.</b>
<br><b>It was a hostile presence, but it didn't actually do anything other
than</b>
<br><b>scare my dog, give me and my&nbsp; mother the creeps, and periodically
frighten</b>
<br><b>my friends away. (They'd never explain why they didn't want to come
up to my</b>
<br><b>room, other than that they sometimes felt "something creepy" up
there.) It</b>
<br><b>wasn't always there all the time, just as the other spirit-creature
wasn't</b>
<br><b>present all the time, but we all definitely knew when it WAS there.</b>
<br><b>It didn't do anything, until I decided to DO something about it.
I decided</b>
<br><b>to try to banish that unpleasant presence, or exorcise it. Apparently,
all I</b>
<br><b>did was enrage the thing, because for the first time it affected
material</b>
<br><b>objects. My doll collection flew off the bookshelves toward me,
as did books</b>
<br><b>and some trinkets. The cold presence also physically moved towards
me, and</b>
<br><b>for the first time I was truly frightened.</b>
<br><b>Then the cold entity stopped, as if it were blocked, and there seemed
to be</b>
<br><b>a struggle of some kind.... the comforting presence that I'd grown
up with,</b>
<br><b>the one associated with my bed... well, I could swear it was protecting
me.</b>
<br><b>The cold thing left, and I made up an excuse as to why all the things
in my</b>
<br><b>room were lying in the floor in the center of the room.</b>
<br><b>Both things followed my mother and me through several moves, from
one</b>
<br><b>apartment to another, so we knew that it had to do with either one
of us, or</b>
<br><b>with something that we moved with us. When I moved out to live with
my</b>
<br><b>fianc&eacute;, neither of them moved with me. (Of course, I'd left
the bed.)</b>
<br><b>The cold thing's presence dwindled, but when my mother took that
old brass</b>
<br><b>bed as her own again, the other presence became strong again.</b>
<br><b>One night, when my mother was particularly upset and crying about
something,</b>
<br><b>she felt a body's weight on the mattress, and masculine arms went
around her</b>
<br><b>waist. She was petrified, convinced that someone had broken into
the house</b>
<br><b>and was preparing to molest her. Finally, she summoned the courage
to move,</b>
<br><b>... and no one was there.</b>
<br><b>The next day, she spoke aloud, telling "him" (we called him "George"
by</b>
<br><b>then) to go away, that he had frightened her horribly.</b>
<br><b>Well, apparently that was enough for George, because his comforting
presence</b>
<br><b>has never been felt since. My mother is sad that she spoke so hastily.
She</b>
<br><b>misses him, and says that she knows he was only trying to comfort
her, and</b>
<br><b>that she over-reacted.</b>
<br><b>On the other hand, the other presence still every now and then re-occurs.
My</b>
<br><b>own son won't sleep in that room (that used to be mine), and will
rarely</b>
<br><b>even go into it alone, even in the daytime.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Ventura, California - The Leewood Hotel</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jonahsmom1981@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I lived adjacent to the main building at the Leewood Hotel in Ventura,
Calif.&nbsp; I was sitting on my bed talking to a friend who was putting
in a new sink. I saw something move with supernatural speed which also
seemed to have a certain light to it.&nbsp; It interrupted the conversation
we were having and I was about to ask my friend if he had seen what I just
saw when he commented that's quite a pillow you've got there, does it do
that often?&nbsp; I asked"that was my pillow?"&nbsp; I hadn't noticed that
it was even an object, I just had seen something move incredibly</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;fast. I looked over onto the floor and there was my heart
shaped pillow which was on my bed just seconds before. Somehow the pillow
just flew from the bed onto the floor with such speed that all I saw was
some flash of bright light.&nbsp; Weird stuff.&nbsp; Another time in that
same room my boyfriend came over and he was waiting for me to finish getting
ready to go out and he heard somebody call his name in a very "differen!</b>
<br><b>t" kind of a way.&nbsp; He actually never heard that kind of a sound
before He said did you hear that and I said yeah to the second calling
of his name which he also heard, but said the first time he heard it was
definitely clearer and more eerie.&nbsp; I had already experienced the
pillow toss and other strange phenomena in this room so, it didn't freak
me out as much as it did him. There was this certain area in the room where
the weird stuff seemed to happen more so than in other areas of the room</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Could It be the Child</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: amandakarma@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I briefly moved into a house in Nitro, WV with a person I had went
to school</b>
<br><b>with.&nbsp; The house had been remodled from when it was first bought
and there</b>
<br><b>had been old shag carpet on the floors that was taken up, leaving
nice hard</b>
<br><b>wood floors.&nbsp; It was noticed in the master bedroom that there
was a stain on</b>
<br><b>the floor than would not come out and no matter how much it was
sanded would</b>
<br><b>not lighten.&nbsp; The stain was covered with a bed and rarely thought
about.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>bedroom was about 10 feet down the long hall from the bedroom where
the stain</b>
<br><b>was.&nbsp; The first notice of a presence was a night when a friend
of mine and I</b>
<br><b>were in my bedroom with the door slightly cracked.&nbsp; My roommate
had already</b>
<br><b>gone to bed that evening and was in the master bedroom with the
door shut.</b>
<br><b>Earlier that night I had laid my only set of keys on my dresser
in my room.</b>
<br><b>My friend and I sat in my room talking when we heard the noise of
keys</b>
<br><b>sliding down the hall and hitting the shut door to the master bedroom.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>both immediately got up and opened my door.&nbsp; At the end of
the hall laid my</b>
<br><b>keys.&nbsp; I yelled for my roommate and he had heard the noise
but just thought</b>
<br><b>it was my friend and I joking around.&nbsp; After we explained to
him that the</b>
<br><b>keys were on my dresser and neither my friend and I had played a
prank, we</b>
<br><b>all sat around that night trying to explain the incident away.&nbsp;
After that</b>
<br><b>first incident we noticed other things that were out of the ordinary.&nbsp;
Things</b>
<br><b>would fall of shelves without anyone being near them.&nbsp; Objects
would be moved</b>
<br><b>around the house.&nbsp; One night I was in the shower and a friend
of mine was in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen waiting on me and she swore she heard someone yell for
her.</b>
<br><b>Thinking it was me, she got up and came to see what I wanted.&nbsp;
After I</b>
<br><b>convinced her that it really was not me she was pale.&nbsp; Time
after time things</b>
<br><b>would occur.&nbsp; Music would come on from the stereo, the TV would
turn on by</b>
<br><b>itself and lights in the house would come on or turn themselves
off.&nbsp; I moved</b>
<br><b>out soon after all this started.&nbsp; I was told later that a murder
had occurred</b>
<br><b>in the house where a man had killed his wife and young daughter,
then killed</b>
<br><b>himself.&nbsp; That is what I speculated the stain on the floor
in the master</b>
<br><b>bedroom to be from.&nbsp; I never confirmed the story of the murders,
but the</b>
<br><b>happenings in the house will always be in my mind!</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Freaked us Out!!!!!!!!</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aoldman@tcinc.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I remember when I was about 13 yrs. old, my cousin stayed the
night with me.&nbsp; It was late probably around midnight or 1:00 a.m.
we were laying down in my bed talking about girl stuff and then the discussion
lead to scarey stories.&nbsp; One story was about something she had seen
outside one night at her house she said it had red eyes and because it
so dark she could not make out the body and just then something touched
our feet inside the covers!&nbsp; I got scared and told her not to be touching
me she said she didn't do it because it touched her feet</b>
<br><b>too. But something like a claw touched us.&nbsp; My first thought
was a mouse but that was not possible because&nbsp; we jumped out of the
bed and tore down the covers on the bed and did not see or hear anything.&nbsp;
To this day I still wonder what it was. That really freaked us out!&nbsp;
Thanks for your time.</b>

<p><b>By: moongirl@altavista.net</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I've stayed up many nights reading your site and I've</b>
<br><b>read every single story on it.&nbsp; Your site is great!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I thought I'd finally get around to submitting</b>
<br><b>something myself.&nbsp; I'm sure my experiences don't begin</b>
<br><b>to compare with most of the scary ones I've read on</b>
<br><b>here. When I was still living at home with my parents,</b>
<br><b>my grandmother died. This was in 1987. My older brother</b>
<br><b>and I had given her a pretty electric lamp that</b>
<br><b>resembled an oil lamp. It had a frosted globe that was</b>
<br><b>painted with blue flowers. Anyway, after my grandmother</b>
<br><b>passed away, the lamp was returned to me. I used it as a</b>
<br><b>bedside lamp on my nightstand. After I got the lamp, I</b>
<br><b>had some disturbing dreams about my deceased</b>
<br><b>grandmother. This wasn't immediately after she'd died.</b>
<br><b>In one of the dreams, I was standing in her front yard</b>
<br><b>near the front storm door and I looked at the door and</b>
<br><b>saw her reflection in it. It scared me so bad that I</b>
<br><b>woke up. I also had a recurring dream in which I was in</b>
<br><b>my bedroom and the house was deathly quiet even though I</b>
<br><b>could see my father sitting in the living room watching</b>
<br><b>television. In my dreams, that bedside lamp would go</b>
<br><b>off, leaving me in complete darkness and then all the</b>
<br><b>other lights in the house would go off and I would run</b>
<br><b>in the darkness trying to find my father. I know this</b>
<br><b>sounds so dumb and boring, but that dream scared the</b>
<br><b>crap out of me everytime I dreamed it. I had other</b>
<br><b>dreams about my grandmother appearing to me also but I'm</b>
<br><b>not about to bore you with more dreams. One day, I</b>
<br><b>accidently knocked the lamp off the nightstand while</b>
<br><b>dusting and the globe was shattered. I stopped using the</b>
<br><b>lamp and when I did, the dreams stopped.&nbsp; But, strange</b>
<br><b>things began to happen in the house. One time, I was</b>
<br><b>home alone and sitting on my parent's bed, looking</b>
<br><b>through some socks. I got a strange feeling and looked</b>
<br><b>up and when I did, I saw the light switch on the wall</b>
<br><b>flip down, causing the lights to go out. I jumped up</b>
<br><b>from the bed and ran out of the house. Another time when</b>
<br><b>I was home alone and in my bedroom reading, I heard one</b>
<br><b>of my mother's bells from her bell collection ring in</b>
<br><b>the living room. My mother told me recently that she</b>
<br><b>often feels someone tap her on the shoulder when she's</b>
<br><b>in the kitchen.&nbsp; About a year ago, I went over to visit</b>
<br><b>my parents and they weren't home. I went in the house</b>
<br><b>and decided I'd just wait on them because I figured</b>
<br><b>they'd just gone to the grocery store. I sat in my</b>
<br><b>father's recliner and leaned my head back and closed my</b>
<br><b>eyes because I had a slight headache. There was nobody</b>
<br><b>in the house but me. After sitting there for about 5</b>
<br><b>minutes, I heard the distinct sound of someone walking</b>
<br><b>on the carpet. The footsteps got closer and seemed to</b>
<br><b>increase in speed. I opened my eyes and of course I</b>
<br><b>didn't see anyone. I know it was footsteps on the carpet</b>
<br><b>that I heard because I've heard my family walking on</b>
<br><b>that carpet for years and it was that same swooshing,</b>
<br><b>scratcy sound.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;One more thing about my grandmother: She had been</b>
<br><b>living with my uncle and aunt before she'd died. I saw</b>
<br><b>my uncle at a family reunion recently and we were</b>
<br><b>talking about Grandma. He shocked me by saying, "I hear</b>
<br><b>her every night."&nbsp; I asked him what he meant by that and</b>
<br><b>he said that every night, he hears her walk to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, close the door, and then the comode flushes.</b>
<br><b>He said that he's even seen her going into his bathroom</b>
<br><b>at night. I loved my grandmother dearly, but I hope I</b>
<br><b>never see her. I don't think I could handle it. Just</b>
<br><b>seeing her in my dreams was scary enough!</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Ghost Stories</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LKJG@worldnet.att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story or stories as the case maybe are not all that extrodanary.
I</b>
<br><b>have seen and felt things that still give me the shivers.&nbsp;
I lived in a</b>
<br><b>duplex near a park about 2 years ago.&nbsp; Late one night I went
for a walk.</b>
<br><b>During this walk I went to an area of the park near an old stone
bridge</b>
<br><b>that was concealed in a thick it of trees.&nbsp; In this area I
had a</b>
<br><b>horrible feeling of fear. I could not figure this out because there
was</b>
<br><b>nothing there but me and a bunch of trees. Then I felt a presents
that I</b>
<br><b>truly felt was a woman. She was young and very scared. I also had
the</b>
<br><b>feeling of being chased. I ran home very very fast. I ran in the
house</b>
<br><b>and locked the door. Then after that I heard someone walking up
and down</b>
<br><b>the stairs late at night.&nbsp; I moved about a year after that
happend I had</b>
<br><b>to move. Not because of the sprit it was time to go.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have many many more stories. I seem to be a magnet for strange</b>
<br><b>happenings.</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=+1>True story in Pa</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My grandmother had died about four years ago. She was admitted to
the</b>
<br><b>hospitol feeling sick, and&nbsp; suddenly passed away unexpected
later that</b>
<br><b>night. My dad,her son, never had a chance to say goodbye or any
final</b>
<br><b>words,so we beleive that is why she came back to visit the next
day.</b>
<br><b>After we all heard she had passed away,that night she gave my family
the</b>
<br><b>sign.</b>
<br><b>She had always worn the perfume channel #5 and let me tell you,the
whole</b>
<br><b>house had a very intense smell of that perfume. I still remember
that</b>
<br><b>night and always will. I was in my room,watching tv when I started</b>
<br><b>smelling very strong perfume. I for one never wore channel and my
mom</b>
<br><b>hardly ever wore any perfume. My dad was in tears and we all knew</b>
<br><b>grandma was present. Later on that night my parents didnt wake me
up</b>
<br><b>when it happened ,knowig I'd be scared to death,my parents had one
more</b>
<br><b>experiece.&nbsp; They told me later on of course.</b>
<br><b>This is how my dad described it.</b>
<br><b>He was in bed and woken by a very bright&nbsp; white ball of light.
So bright</b>
<br><b>that it you could barely stare at it but it did not light up the
room at</b>
<br><b>all. It hovered at the end of the bed&nbsp; and then moved slowly
to the</b>
<br><b>corners of the room. He quick woke my mom up and she saw it also.
A red</b>
<br><b>ball of light appeared then and hovered beside the white . My dad
turned</b>
<br><b>on the light and they zipped away.&nbsp; My parents were scared
about it and</b>
<br><b>truly shocked,but my dad explained it was a peaceful feeling while
it</b>
<br><b>happened. He believes that was&nbsp; his mother again leaving in
her angel</b>
<br><b>form. The reason I decided to print ths to you is because I was
browsing</b>
<br><b>threw stories,and one had a similar experience with a ball of light</b>
<br><b>entering their room. Also had stated that they asked a priest about
it ,</b>
<br><b>he replied that it represented an angel. I never heard that before,
my</b>
<br><b>parents just assumed the lights were angels having to do with grandma.</b>
<br><b>It's a relief to hear my family and I aren't the only ones that
had a</b>
<br><b>spiritual contact. Thats all that ever happened so far,thank god
really.</b>
<br><b>I&nbsp; know there's life after death but I do not want to face
it anytime</b>
<br><b>soon. We do live on, and it's been proven to some.</b>
<br><b>Your site is very unique,and put together great.</b>
<br><b>Maybe you should start writing a book with all these stories. :)&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>was my experience,and yes it is honestly true. Thanks for your time,</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>The Storm</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By:cvat@gate.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;When I was a kid about 10 I had a very weird thing happen to
me.My</b>
<br><b>parents had just left me at my house alone.My mother had to get</b>
<br><b>something that she left at work.And my dad was at my aunt's house</b>
<br><b>visiting for a week.It was a very very very stormy night.There was
a</b>
<br><b>tornado warning&nbsp; on the weather channel.I got scared.Very scared.The</b>
<br><b>wind was blowing really hard and whistling at the same time.The
lights</b>
<br><b>were flickering on and off.I was scared to death!Lighting suddenly</b>
<br><b>struck and the lights went off.They came back on though.The house</b>
<br><b>started shaking as if it were going to come off the ground.The phone</b>
<br><b>rang.It was my mom.She told me there was a huge twister coming straight</b>
<br><b>through town and she was down in the basement.Since we didnt have
a</b>
<br><b>basement she told me to go in the middle of the house and the phone
went</b>
<br><b>dead before she could say anything else.The power was still flickering</b>
<br><b>off and on.I went to the bathroom since it was in the middle of
the</b>
<br><b>house when suddenly I heard someone pound on the front door.It was
very</b>
<br><b>strange that someone would come in the middle of this weather.The
lights</b>
<br><b>went out again.It was pitch black.Although the pounding kept on.Then
I</b>
<br><b>heard pounding on the front window of the house.I was getting angry
and</b>
<br><b>very scared.I thought why couldnt I just have gone with my mom.The</b>
<br><b>person at the door couldnt have been my mom because she had a key.In
the</b>
<br><b>dark it was pretty hard to know where everything was.I felt around</b>
<br><b>untill I heard a window break in the front of my house.Somebody
had</b>
<br><b>broken in!I heard foot steps running down the hard wood floor in
the</b>
<br><b>dinning room.I ran outside holding onto everthing&nbsp; I could
so I would</b>
<br><b>not go flying away anywhere.I finally got to the next door house
where</b>
<br><b>my neibor lived.I felt around walking throught the house when I
stepped</b>
<br><b>on something.I stepped away quikly wondering what it could be.I
trip and</b>
<br><b>fell because of the slippery floor.I landed on a coat.I felt for
a</b>
<br><b>pocket on it.She was a heavy smoker and always carried a lighter.I
found</b>
<br><b>one in one of the pockets.I lite it up and found the lady lying
on the</b>
<br><b>floor and the floor was half cluttered with blood.She had a big
fat cut</b>
<br><b>on her head wich there was glass on the floor too that was with
the</b>
<br><b>blood.She had hit her head on the window.I ran out of that house
so fast</b>
<br><b>you wouldnt even of thought i was there!I ran to her shed and since
it</b>
<br><b>was unlocked thank god I went in.I stayed there till the storm ran</b>
<br><b>over.The ambulance was at my neibors house when i woke up.The police</b>
<br><b>were at my house.I went over to my house. When my mom saw me she
was so</b>
<br><b>happy to see me she squeezed me really hard!The only problem I thought</b>
<br><b>of was who was that at the door banging?I asked the police.They
said</b>
<br><b>that no one had broken in at all.I looked at the window it wasnt</b>
<br><b>broken.After that one of the people in my neiborhood said they saw</b>
<br><b>something weird in front of my house.They said it was this big glowing</b>
<br><b>figure of a man.And they said he was moving back and forth.Well
I will</b>
<br><b>never forget that happened, it scared me!</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>House on the 9 th Hole</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: accord1986@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>in january of 1998 i moved to&nbsp; nc with my aunt and my 2</b>
<br><b>cousins. after two weeks there my cousins kept telling me stories
of a</b>
<br><b>house right by the 9th hole green ind sedgefield nc 10 minutes from</b>
<br><b>where i was living. they told me stories of candles flickering comming</b>
<br><b>towards them with no one holding it and strange noises comming from</b>
<br><b>there at night. one night i decided to go take a look at the house
to</b>
<br><b>see if it was just something made up to scare me or if it was real.
me</b>
<br><b>and my 2 cousins along with a friend of ours got to the house at
about</b>
<br><b>11:30 pm parked the car and went up to the house. we walked around
it</b>
<br><b>for about 5 minutes just looking to see if there was anything strange</b>
<br><b>going on but nothing was happening. finally we entered the house
just me</b>
<br><b>and one of my cousins the other was to scared and so was are friend.</b>
<br><b>when me and my cousin went into the house the first thing we noticed
was</b>
<br><b>tha there were etched tombstones with peoples names on them standing</b>
<br><b>upright in front of the fireplace. as we walked into what appeared
to be</b>
<br><b>the dining room i started to get extremly cold and uncomfortable.
as we</b>
<br><b>started walking further into the house we seen a basement door and
then</b>
<br><b>stared to hear dogs barking comming from the basement. hearing the
dogs</b>
<br><b>barking freaked us out because the house was abondand. then we seen
a</b>
<br><b>sheet covering the enterance to the hallway. as soon as we got to
the</b>
<br><b>sheet we started to hear loud thumping noises getting louder and
louder.</b>
<br><b>after that we got to scared and ran out the house as fast as we
could.</b>
<br><b>we never returned to the house ever again.</b>
