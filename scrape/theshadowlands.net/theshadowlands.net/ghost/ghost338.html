<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Update on the Octagon House<br>
<br>
By: jacki@ogrensat.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I was reading your site, and I would like to add a presonal account of
one of the listings you have.&nbsp; My friend used to own the Octagon
House in Fond du Lac, WI...every year we used to have a haunted house
there for the public.&nbsp; Fascinating place, orginally a hub of the
underground railroad (helping slaves), there are many tunnels and
"secret doors".&nbsp; I have been there on many occasions, including my
wedding shower.&nbsp; I have seen many incidence of lights going on and
off, walking around on the upper levels, some of the secret doors
slamming, voices in the tunnels.&nbsp; Very spooky.&nbsp; Never
anything bad, just unexplained stuff.<br>

Every House I live In<br>
<br>
<br>
By: adw_nurse@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I live in a small town in Kansas. I have lived in several houses in
this town and in just about each house have had "strange" experiences.
The first I can recall was on a small farm house in the country. My
sister and I shared a room, had bunkbeds. The head of the bed was the
opposite of how most people would set a room up. The head of the bed
was by the window and the foot of the bed was flush to the wall. I was
on the bottom bunk and my sister on the top. I recall waking up one
night and looking out the window to the shed that was across from me.
In the top window (second floor) I noticed a black human figure, no
disernable facial features. It had a pale yellow light glowing around
it. Just purely out of fear and not wanting to experience this alone I
asked my sister, who was supposedly asleep on the top bunk if she was
seeing what I was seeing. Not expecting her to really answer me, she
said yes! We still joke about our "psychic" connection.<br>
When I was in high school, and living in a small town as I do, my
friends and I would drive around the country side. Mostly because we
heard that there was some scary haunted place outside of town, and we
always liked to investigate. But one night I was sitting in the front
seat of my friends car and noticed that there was a small boy running
in the road ahead of us. It was rather late at night, at least sometime
after midnight, a very strange hour for young boys to be out running in
the country. I noticed that he had on a red and green striped shirt and
brown pants. What was really creepy was the way he kept looking back at
us, almost begging n to be hit. I could only see this boy at the middle
point of an s curve in the road. Just as we were rounding the last
corner he would disappear. It would only last several seconds. I
questioned weather or not I was losing my mind or if I really saw it,
because no one else did.<br>
Another story I have is when I bought the house I live in now. (still
in the same small town) I had fallen asleep on the floor in my living
room. My dog was sleeping next to me. I am not sure what exactly woke
me up, but when I looked towards my bedroom I could see a small girl in
a white night gown. She had blonde hair and next to her was a white
cat. I could see through them. They had a mist around them. And again
just as it registered what I was seeing they vanished. <br>
A few months later I was in my room standing on the edge of my bed,
which is right next to the bedroom door. I was reaching for the light
fixture to change a light bulb. With my arms extened, I noticed a man,
dark short hair, in his 30's, with dark rimmed glasses walk past me
from the living room into my room. As soon as he got past my arm, so he
would be standing right in front of me, he disappeared. <br>
I have also noticed small dark figures, possible dog like roaming
around my when I am walking in my house at night. I always try to jump
over them thinking that it was my dog, but she was in another room when
this happened.<br>

Hauntings In Florida<br>
<br>
By: miikeeec@earthlink.net<br>
<br>
im from fort myers florida, i use to work at the bank on colonial near
the train tracks and metro parkway. at the time it was first national
bank of fort myers. i use to clean the place with a young woman while i
was in high school. i was the first person to meet the tall man that
haunts the bank. my mother owns a cleaning company and came to the bank
one night and we were to proceed with stripping and waxing floors. well
i took a break and went down the hall, and put my head down, i got such
a chill and i froze my lower back went so numb i couldnt move, i looked
up and this image of a tall 6'4 man looking down at me turning the
corner and disappeared. i ran off yelling to my mother and lights
started flickering and i told her everything and she was like i dont
want to hear this, she obviously was uneasy as well. we dropped
everything and left.<br>
&nbsp;there had been rumors that things would go missing during bank
hours, but when i told the bank manager(richard rufi at the time ) he
said oh yea a man died here upstairs building this place years ago.<br>
I left there and never worked there again. but the young girl who
worked with me stayed and things began to happen to her, her cleaning
cart would be lost for minutes and be found downstairs when she was up
and in the kitchen. one weekend when the family was out of town she was
in charge of the cleaning , and she had snunk her friend in to help her
get it down faster. she ended up calling us in las vegas asking us to
leave the bank cause she couldnt take it anymore, the appartition hid
her cell phone and her friends and would roll oranges off tables and
down the hall, she said paper clips spelled out help downstairs when
she was vacuumming. she quit on the phone, so we offered more money in
return she just finish the job. it was definetly different you could
feel as if someone was with you and behind you, hear the sound of
theyre shoes sinking in the carpet.<br>
the stories were pretty big with the tellers downstairs they wanted to
see it , well one day the newest teller jane who was nineteen was
working the drive thru on a saturday when there open drive thru only
from 9 am - 12p, she looked back across the bank and saw a tall man in
one of the offices looking at her, so she yelled and told the other
teller and they ran to look and he was gone, jane said he wasnt though,
he was crouched down hiding near a desk and vanished. thats the last
ive heard. i believe im the one who sent the first note in on this
which got it on the site, i just wanted to elaborate since its been a
while since all the happenings. during this time the bank was first
national bank of fort myers and upstairs were offices for a mortgage
company called collier arnold, not sure of the exact address it sits
right next to a mcdonalds and in front of amtell flea market .<br>

Haunted Townhouse<br>
<br>
By: Nirvanaks13@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
This is true I swear.&nbsp; I lived in a townhouse for 2 years from age 9 to age 11.<br>
I am now 14.&nbsp; The way the house was laid out was- you walked in to the living room<br>
through the front door.&nbsp; To the left was the stairs.&nbsp; Up stairs was 3 bedrooms and <br>
1 bathroom.&nbsp; If you went forward in the living you walked into the dining room.&nbsp; <br>
To the right was the kitchen and a half-bathroom.&nbsp; To the left was the stairs<br>
leading to the basement.&nbsp; Anyway- after living there a little over a year, I saw something.<br>
My mom and I were playing a card game at the dinning room table when all of a<br>
sudden I saw a shadow of a man, crouched down, holding an ax.&nbsp; I just froze.&nbsp; I told<br>
my mom and she didn't believed me until later.&nbsp; Now I didn't think
it was an overactive imagination- I have believed in ghosts and the
supernatural all my life and I still do.<br>
Another strange thing was that my cat, Thomas, would never go in the basement, that's<br>
were the litter box was, alone.&nbsp; Toward the end of us living
there, I was afraid to be in the house alone.&nbsp; That was strange
because I love "alone time".&nbsp; After we moved out we had<br>
to go back because the people around there were complaining about the smoke <br>
alarms going off. Weird.&nbsp; Well that's my story.&nbsp; Thanks for reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Ghosts of a Family Member<br>
<br>
By: Cglima1@aol.com<br>
<br>
When I was six years old my Mom noticed I was talking to someone when I
would be any where by myself.&nbsp; I was not the only one who was
talking to this person my cousin two mouth older than me would talk to
someone that no one else could see or hear. this sound corny but the
first time I saw it I was in the bathroom. it started as a smoke type
mist and then it look like an older man. he stood in the corner smiling
at me.&nbsp; this continued for two to three days then he spook. he
started to take like was a normal living person this went on for about
a mouth. he showed up two to three times a day. it was around this time
my Mom started to notice. this next part I have to go by what my Mom
said happened, because I cant remember. she said that it was about
seven o'clock I came out of my room walk through the living room and
started out the front door. She said that she was yelling at me but it

was at this point I can remember her grabbing me but nothing before
that. I could not tell her what happened because I did not know what

before I was born. but I know that who I was talking two my Mom show

Fort Dix Hospital<br>
<br>
By: grydberg@medxcorp.com<br>
<br>
I have a great story from Ft. Dix haunted hospital.<br>
I was stationed at Ft. Dix from late 1997-mid-1999.&nbsp; One summer day in 1998,<br>
my frind and I decided to go check out the top 5 floors.&nbsp; We took the<br>
freight elevator, because the patient elevator stops after the 4th floor.<br>
We went to the 9th, then 8th floor with nothing abnormal, as soon as we<br>
stepped off the elevator on the 7th floor, the psych ward, things got<br>
strange.&nbsp; First of all, the temp dropped, not enough to see our breath, but<br>
there was a drop, the lights were flickering like crazy, and my frinds brick<br>
walkie-talkie was going crazy.&nbsp; He thought someone was trying to get ahold<br>
of him, but no one responded, then we heard the patinet elevators close, and<br>
we jumped back in the elevator.&nbsp; We went back to the 7th floor about 45<br>
minutes later, and everything was normal.&nbsp; The lights were lit, and the temp<br>
was normal.&nbsp; We checked things out, and did not see anything abnormal.<br>
There are stories of babies crying, and a real neat story of the floors on<br>
the OB floor being freshly mopped.&nbsp; There is a mop and bucket that was left<br>
up there, and the floor will be wet, with foot steps across it, and the mop<br>
and bucket are dry.<br>
I also worked with a girl, and she was in the back of the lab, and she saw<br>
an image of a person walking behind her in the computer screen, when she<br>
turned around, no one was there.<br>
The last is an inquiry.&nbsp; I heard that there was a "super-soldier" being<br>
created in the sub-basement.&nbsp; Supposedly right after Vietnam War, the<br>
basment was quickly cemented in, and to this day, there is a crawl space,<br>
and the suspended ceiling is still there.&nbsp; I would like more information if<br>
someone can find it.<br>
The last sotry is of the morgue.&nbsp; I had keys to the morgue, so we would go<br>
down and check things out.&nbsp; The lights never work, they continuously<br>
flicker, and you can feel a prescence when you lay down in the cooler.&nbsp; We<br>
would lay down on the morgue table, and be pushed back into the cooler.&nbsp; I<br>
did this only once, because I felt like someone was lying next to me.<br>
Please feel free to contact me anytime.&nbsp; This place was haunted, I witnessed<br>
it first-hand.<br>

Dad's Still Here<br>
<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; Anonymous<br>
<br>
My father passed away rather suddenly just before Christmas.&nbsp; He
had been ill only a few months, and no one expected him to deteriorate
this quickly.&nbsp; He, himself, had only found out a week or so before
that there was nothing more they could do for him.&nbsp; We thought he
had made his peace when he made all of his own arrangements for his
passing; but even the doctor thought he would make it to spring.&nbsp;
So we think that the speed with which he passed caught Dad by surprise
also.<br>
My father was a Fireman most of his life, but he had actualy trained as
an electrician and that is where this story comes into play.&nbsp; The
night before he passed, the family was all gathered together for an
early Christmas.&nbsp; While Dad wasn't really conscious, we all had a
chance to say our good-byes and to let him know that it was OK to
go...that we would take care of each other as he had always taken care
of us.&nbsp; By early the next morning, he was gone.&nbsp; I was the
only one of my family who had returned home the prior evening, and so
was not there when he passed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the emotion of
the situation, I got into a fight with my Mother and my older brother
over some stupid things.&nbsp; During the fight on the phone, my Mother
said that the lights where she was sitting kept flickering.&nbsp;
Later, when I came home again for the funeral, I was told that all that
first day, they couldn't keep a light bulb working through out the
house.&nbsp; Some of them were changed 2 and 3 times during the
day.&nbsp; Finally, my sister had battled cancer twice herself and had
given up smoking.&nbsp; For some reason, she had recently begun smoking
again, and my father was the only one who didn't know.&nbsp; My sister
was in the backyard having a smoke on that day, and a halogen light in
the yard that hasn't gone out in 10 years, suddenly went out.&nbsp; My
sister looked to the sky and said, "I know Dad!&nbsp; Just let me get
through this and I'll quit!"&nbsp; The light came back on, and has been
on ever since.&nbsp; In fact, after that one day, there have been no
further problems.<br>
No electrical explanation could be found, but we all think that Dad
stuck around for a day to make sure that we were all going to be OK,
and used this method to let us know that he was still there and would
be alright.<br>

Civil War Spirit?<br>
<br>
<br>
By: Pdsheryl@aol.com<br>
<br>
Hi!&nbsp; Just stubled upon your website... very interesting!!! Have
had several experiances in Kansas, both those listed on your site (
Muchnic Gallery,Sallie house,Molly's hollow in Atchison;Spook Light
Road,too) but I still have much more reading to do !!&nbsp;&nbsp; I
visited a little museum in Osawaomie,Ks,last summer... it's a small
park w/ an old museum about John Brown &amp; the civil war battle that
was fought there. It was a sweltering hot summer day,and my husband
took our two kids,ages 9 &amp; 18 mo., into the museum. There's many
old artifacts &amp; etc.,typical of an old history museum, and we were
the only one there save but for the elderly lady who acts as door
greeter. My husband &amp; children wandered off,touring the museum,and
I felt really strange,sort of like time was somehow slowing down,
strange echoes &amp; etc.,&nbsp; anyway I was reading this plaque on
the wall ,about the battle, John Brown &amp; Bleeding Kansas,etc,. then
something about his son,whodied in the battle,when I felt (what I
thought was ) my husband standing next to me,( you know how it feels
when you're deep in thought,reading or something,&amp; someone
approaces you...)&nbsp; then,my husband appeared,walking towards
me,from the other hall!! Don't know why,but I;m sure it was the son, he
was of medium height,wearing old,battered clothing,but it was only a
split second that I glimpsed him.There's also a huge old home in
Osawatomie that's been converted to a B&amp;B, and ny best frien'd
mother used to baby-sit there years ago,and had many sightings of a
little girl ghost,apparantly one who had died there many years before.
I have many other occurances I've witnessed,but that's enough for
now.... going back to see more of your site!!<br>

Old Rifle Range Barraks Parris Island, SC<br>
<br>
By: canesfan1188@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I just happened across your site while browsing the web tonight about
true ghost stories.&nbsp; I was telling my wife about a strange event
that happened to me while I was in boot camp at Parris Island in
1992.&nbsp; It gave me chills to find the building this event occurred
in on the haunted places list on your site.&nbsp; <br>
I will never forget this event as long as I live, it is giving me
chills even as I type this email.&nbsp; It was late October in 1992 and
my platoon was at the old white rifle range barracks for night fire
exercises.&nbsp; I was selected by the drill instructors with 3 other
recruits to stay and watch the barracks while the rest of the platoon
went out to setup for the exercises later that night.&nbsp; We were all
sitting there on the floor in the middle of the squadbay floor and we
were chatting about various things when the conversation turned to
halloween which was only a few days away.&nbsp; One of the guys began
to talk about stories his grandfather had told about the barracks that
we were staying in.&nbsp; Stories about murders and suicides that took
place in the barracks over the years and about the ghost's that still
haunted the buildings.&nbsp; It was still hot that time of year in
South Carolina and the barracks had no AC so we decided to open the
windows.&nbsp; Two of us openend the left side windows, while the other
two opened the right side windows.&nbsp; Any Marine would remember
these windows well as it took two people practically to open or close
these old windows.&nbsp; Once we got them open we sat back down to
continue our conversation.&nbsp; One of the recruits spoke up and began
to say how there were no such things as ghosts and the stories were
made up to scare people.&nbsp; The same guy who had told us his
grandfathers stories began to say how he believed in ghosts and ghost
stories.&nbsp; He asked me and the other recruit if we believed in
ghosts o not and we both said we didn't believe in ghosts.&nbsp; He
kept insisting that we were wrong and the first recruit who said he
didn't believe in ghosts began to raise his voice.&nbsp; He shouted out
"there are no such things as ghosts!"&nbsp; Just as he finished
screaming this, a cold wind blew open the back door of the squadbay and
every window we had opened (approx. 20 windows) slammed shut at the
same time.&nbsp; We all looked at each other in shock and stood up and
ran into the bathroom.&nbsp; All four of us crammed into one toilet
stall and slammed the door shut.&nbsp; We sat there for a few seconds,
which seemed like a hour.&nbsp; One of the recruits broke the silence
and whispered, "what just happened?"&nbsp; The recruit who told the
stories replied "it must be the ghosts."&nbsp; The one recruit again
said, "no way, I told you there are no such things as ghosts."&nbsp; As
God as my witness, as soon as he said that, another cold breeze blew
through the bathroom and the stall door swung open slamming into the
wall.&nbsp; As the door hit the wall we heard a moaning voice say "WE
ARE REAL!"&nbsp; We all nearly soiled ourselves it was so spooky and
erie.&nbsp; We sat there for about 30 minutes before we finally got up
the nerve to go back into the squadbay.&nbsp; We never heard or saw
anything else the rest of the time we where there.&nbsp; We all swore
never to tell anyone else in the platoon what had happened.&nbsp; We
knew that nobody would believe it.&nbsp; I will never forget the events
of that day.<br>

Movie Theatre<br>
<br>
By: Dkm778@cs.com<br>
<br>
well, my father (doug) was a teen in the 60's and worked at a movie
theater. This movie theater called "Up Town Movie Theater" is very old
and still stands today. Somtimes I pass by it and try to look in it as
if I expect to see somthing right then and there. its a small theater
with maybe 15 or 20 rows. I believe its for lease now. But anyways, my
dad heard stories and lived some himself. He said the theater was a
creepy place in general. he would be the one to turn on all the lights
a couple hours before the show started. He says it was so dark you
couldnt see your hand in front of your face. There were always "bangs"
for no reason. No way anyone could have made them and no telling what
caused them. This guy who use to book the movies would usually come by
to pick up his check. One day he came by the theater and heard somone
running up and down the isles. He never came back. He had them mail him
his checks. <br>
Leroy was a black janitor at the theater and his job was to blow all
the popcorn and trash down to the front of the isles with a leaf
blower. One night while doing this he was suddenly chased by a man who
came from behind the screen. Leroy had bruises from jumping over the
rows of chairs. When asked to describe the man he said he couldnt
becasue he had hair all over his face. He had them mail him his check
and quit the very next day. My dad and his friend Tommy Hogan would
somtimes go behind the screen and watch for people throwing trash at
the screen. One specific time when going to the back of the screen
where they just came from they found a chair put together facing the
crowd. The chair wasnt there before and no one went back there besides
them. After a showing on a busy friday night, him and Tommy were
blowing the trash from the back to the front when all the sudden the
house lights went out. Just the house lights. There are two places you
can turn on/off the house lights. In the prejection room and behind the
food stand. Tommy and my father went to the food stand, saw no body and
turned the house lights back on. They then went up stairs to the
prejection room and found no one. Somtimes me and my dad pass by it and
he is so interested in it, he almost crashes the car. Somtimes i want
to stop the car and take him in there with me.&nbsp; <br>

The Yellow Motel<br>
<br>
By: wanda_chinaski@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I have been to the yellow motel several times in my life and get an
eerie feeling each time I've been there.&nbsp; It turned into a party
haven for many years, and people would go out there at night and wait
until weird things would happen.&nbsp; It caught fire many times and
the township finally got tired of putting it out all the time and
finally about 1998 or 1999 they had a control burn and finished burning
it to the ground.&nbsp; The underground tunnels were filled with water
also.&nbsp; You can still go there, the tennis court is still there and
the abandoned cottages are still out back.&nbsp; That place still
freaks me out, and I have only ever been out of my car one time when I
was there and that was enough.&nbsp; I never thought that I would see
the day when the yellow motel would actually be on a website, but I
think its great.&nbsp; A little piece of smalltown Michigan on the
great big web.<br>

Apartment of Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: leroyt700@msn.com<br>
<br>
I lived in a haunted house in Newark, N.J.&nbsp; The address is 155
Oliver St.&nbsp; This is a two-family home and my wife and I were
renting the second floor apartment from the owners, the Carratura
family who lived downstairs. When I moved into the apartment I changed
all the locks on the two exit doors and only my wife and I had keys. We
had our 3 year old son living with us and my 7 year old daughter from
my previous marriage would frequently stay with us for weekend visits.<br>
Soon after we moved into the apt we noticed my son would often talk to
someone we could not see. At first we dismissed it as just his
imagination, but then one weekend my daughter said that her brother was
talking to "the old man and the lady in white". My wife and I
questioned her about this and were told that she often saw a woman in a
white dress and an old man in a long coat and hat walking the hallway
at night and she said the man made her uneasy (my word not hers) but
that the lady was nice but she was very sad. Still, we figured the kids
were just imagining things. However, strange things started to happen;
lights would go on by themselves, the door to the fridge would be left
open, etc. Of course I blamed my wife and she blamed me (my son
couldn't reach the light switch). Money was tight for us then and after
coming home and finding EVERY light on, when we knew we had turned them
all off before leaving, we figured the owners had somehow gotten into
the apt. So, I asked them and I was assured that they had no key and
had not been in the apt.&nbsp; Still the lights would be on when we
returned from any trip, no matter if we were gone 5 minutes or 5 hours.
Then one night my wife and i were watching TV in the&nbsp; living
room&nbsp; which was the front room of the apt and looked out onto the
street. The room has two large windows which look out to the street,
and one side window which looked out to the alleyway leading to the
backyard. I was sitting on the couch with the windows behind me and my
wife was in a chair just to my right. Suddenly I noticed movement on
the other side of my wife and looked up and said "What the**** " and my
wife screamed.&nbsp; We both watched in amazement without saying
anything until the apparition had gone, and then I said to her "don't
say anything, just write down what you saw and we'll compare
notes"&nbsp; We did and we both had seen the "old man"&nbsp; He had a
type of trench coat on and a fedora type hat.&nbsp; He seemed to just
disappear about midway between his knees and the floor. We both had
seen him appear from just behind and to the right of my wife,&nbsp;
seemingly right through the wall with the large windows. We both saw
him framed in the light from the side window and then he walked down
the hallway out of the room and disappeared! After we compared notes,
we went downstairs and questioned the Carraturas.&nbsp; They all smiled
and said " we wondered when&nbsp; you would ask us about this."&nbsp;
It seems EVERYONE who lives in the house knows about the ghosts and
most people can see them at different times.&nbsp; There is an old man
and a sad younger woman. They are harmless but they sometimes play
pranks (the lights) and I was told if they get too annoying to just
holler at them and they will stop. We were amazed even further when
about two weeks later a message was left on our chalkboard which we
used for phone #s and grocery lists. It said " Sophie"&nbsp; and gave a
phone #. I asked my wife about it but she was clueless. I had dated a
Sophie years earlier, and I thought I recognized the #, so I called. I
got Sophie's family and they informed me Sophie had died the day
before! We stayed in the apt for another year until we bought a house,
and then the couple who had lived in the apt before us moved back! They
missed the ghosts!<br>

Haunted Bed<br>
<br>
By: MTBCSivanish@aol.com<br>
<br>
I was 19 or 20 years old at the time and I have always been a
skeptic.&nbsp; It was late spring afternoon and I went downstairs to my
room to take a nap.&nbsp; I had an old bed that had been purchased at a
garage sale by my aunt years before and eventually ended up as
mine.&nbsp; I tossed and turned then I froze.&nbsp; I could not
move.&nbsp; Though the sun was still up my room was extremely
dark.&nbsp; I could not move nor talk.&nbsp; My back was to the whole
of the room while my face was to the wall.&nbsp; It felt like something
hideous or evil was trying to overpower me.&nbsp; I have never felt so
paralyzed.&nbsp; I struggled for what seemed like forever.&nbsp; I
tried to yell out, but I knew I was home alone.&nbsp; Finally I managed
to stand up, but fell back down, it was like I had been drugged, but I
had nothing to drink or any kind of narcotics in my system.&nbsp; I
whispered by the name of Jesus, let me go.&nbsp; I was able to get up,
I ran faster than hell upstairs and locked the basement door.&nbsp; I
was terrified.&nbsp; I later summed up the courage to take a bible
downstairs and I turned on every light on in the house.&nbsp; My mother
came home later that evening around 8:00 p.m.&nbsp; She asked me what
was wrong?&nbsp; I told her the story.&nbsp; She knew what exactly I
was talking about.&nbsp; When she had the bed in her room a few years
earlier, she had a similar experience in the daytime.&nbsp; She could
describe everything that I experienced and she had never told me the
story.&nbsp; I moved my clothes upstairs and did not sleep in that bed
for over two years.&nbsp; I had told my friends the story and of course
they wanted to try it out, but nothing happend.&nbsp; Then my second
cousin had come over to spend the weekend with us.&nbsp; He slept
downstairs.&nbsp; At least he tried to sleep.&nbsp; The next morning he
said he had the most bizarre experience sleeping downstairs.&nbsp; The
bed kind of shook (it was only a mattress on top of a box spring, no
frame.&nbsp; A strange and eerie sensation came over him and he felt
very uneasy.&nbsp; My mother and I never told him our stories prior to
his experience.&nbsp; He was so freaked out he slept upstairs for the
remainder of his trip.&nbsp; We got rid of the bed.&nbsp; As our
stories made it through the family.&nbsp; My little cousin was the
first to have the bed and she was about four years old.&nbsp; To this
day she remembers waking up from a nap and seeing an old man that she
did not recognize sitting at the end of the bed.&nbsp; I don't know if
it was all coincidental or imaginations getting the best of us, but it
was weird and I still remeber the day and the details.&nbsp; Nothing
has happend since (I am now 35) and I hope it never does.&nbsp; It felt
evil.&nbsp; <br>

NYC Apartment Ghost<br>
<br>
By: davebazooka@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Recently I was house-sitting for a friend of mine on<br>
the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It was an old<br>
tenement walkup, and the apartment was an unrenovated<br>
railroad walk-thru, made up of 5 rooms leading into<br>
each other, the kitchen in the back and the parlor in<br>
the front facing the street. By unrenovated I mean the<br>
walls and floors were still the original cracked<br>
plaster and wooden moldings covered with decades'<br>
worth of paint layers.<br>
I am not superstitious at all and never had any<br>
paranormal experiences, and in fact I grew up in an<br>
apartment very similar to the one I was sitting, in<br>
the same area of the UES, and never encountered any<br>
ghostly phenomena. But after a week sitting my<br>
friend's railroad apt., I was convinced there was some<br>
sort of haunting going on. I heard voices talking to<br>
me in my sleep, esp. the voice of what sounded like an<br>
angry old woman. I mean I felt as if someone was<br>
trying to communicate with me while I was sleeping.<br>
Sometimes a noise would sound through the apartment<br>
that would bring me fully awake, and this occurred<br>
around the same time early every morning around 2:30<br>
or 3 a.m. I can't describe the sound, except it was<br>
like wood hitting wood, or a door slamming. I never<br>
was able to find the source of the sound.<br>
While awake I experienced different sensations, some<br>
of them similar to others who have had hauntings. I<br>
would be concentrating on some task and become aware<br>
gradually that a presence had entered the room but<br>
when I looked up, there was no one there. I asked a<br>
neighbor to bring their pet dog into the apartment one<br>
evening and the animal sat in the middle of the<br>
kitchen and peered up into one specific corner where<br>
the ceiling met the wall above the bathroom door. Very<br>
smart dog and usually excited and curious, but all she<br>
would do in that apartment was sit and stare at<br>
something as though she were watching and listening to<br>
something. <br>
Another time when I was sitting in the kitchen, there<br>
was a light on in the kitchen and the parlor 4 rooms<br>
away...the 3 smaller bedrooms between the two rooms<br>
were dark, and I briefly saw a silhouette or shadow<br>
appear to move across one of the rooms. After this the<br>
occurrences stopped for a while, and then when I was<br>
sleeping I began to hear the old woman again, along<br>
with old Christmas carol music (sounded like Pat<br>
Boone) and also I constantly visualized a dog passing<br>
through the rooms, as if the dog was trying to let me<br>
know he/she was there. The image would appear in my<br>
ind at odd times repetitively.<br>
After my friend returned I asked him if the rooms were<br>
haunted and he made me tell him the whole thing, and<br>
he corroborated most of my experiences. Neither of us<br>
were frightened, we were just interested and curious.<br>
A mutual pal of ours had a friend who was supposedly<br>
psychic (i was always skeptical about this) and we<br>
asked her to being the psychic man to check the<br>
apartment out. He walked through the roms a few times<br>
and announced that there was an elderly tenant's<br>
spirit still in the rooms, that she had died there<br>
around 1970 and had lived there most of her life and<br>
loved it there, and that she did not llike me or my<br>
friend being there in her apartment. He also said<br>
there was the dog's spirit in the rooms, a big black<br>
dog's ghost, and the dog had lived there sometime<br>
after the old woman (1970s 0r 80s) and that the woman<br>
from the eearlier time did not like the dog either.<br>
WHEW anyway just wanted to share the tale...I wonder<br>
if the fact that the apartment is unrenovated (very<br>
old original walls) had anything to do with the<br>
hauntings as if they were maintaining energy from<br>
other times. Just a thought.<br>
I found the experience not in the least chilling or<br>
terifying, in fact I wish I could spend more time<br>
there and get to know the elderly lady! I bet she has<br>
some stories to tell.<br>

Vegor's Cemetery<br>
<br>
By: melissa_anne2000@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hello...I live in Iowa and i have been to Vegor's Cemetary in Stratford
a couple of times...Once was at night and nothing happened as far as i
could see..i was a little scared out of my wits considering the people
i was with (two guys) were sitting on each side of me and both fell
asleep..they dont believe in hauntings or ghosts so i was a little
scared out of my mind, considering I do believe in hauntings and
ghosts.&nbsp; So we sat at the bottom of the hill...the cemetary is at
the top of the hill, and we were not facing the hill...so i dont know
if something was going on behind me or not.<br>
The second time i went to Vegors was during the day with a
friend.&nbsp; He got a bad feeling when he got out of his truck and i
said i was going to go look around.&nbsp; So i started to walk along
the graves and i stopped in front of one...i dont know why i stopped
but i think i was shocked by the name...her name was Arizona.&nbsp; I
though to myself, wow i thought only these days someone would name
their child after towns and states.&nbsp;&nbsp; i looked at the dates
on her headstone, (i can't exactly remember them right now but i think
it was the late 1800's or early 1900s) and her brother is buried right
next to her. After about 5-10 minutes of looking at her headstone I
kept walking, a noise in the woods scared me (the cemetary is
surrounded by woods) it was a huge bird that flew around the cemetary
and not right over it..which was wierd to me.&nbsp; So i got in the
truck and we left.&nbsp; My dad and i were talking the next day and he
asked me what i did the day before (my dad and i really like going to
cemetaries and looking around at the dates of the headstones) so i told
him i went to Vegors and he asked me if i saw "baby Arizona".&nbsp; I
just looked at him with my mouth open.... d i said "who told you?" and
he asked "what do you mean?" and i said "i looked at her grave
yesterday for like 10 minutes just staring at it" and he smiled and
said "its known that if you stop in front of her headstone (at night)
and look straight ahead and hurry and look to her headstone real fast
you can see her sitting on her headstone with a smile on her face, but
it is not a sweet 5 year old smile, it is a demonic smile"&nbsp; He
also told me that one of his friends that he worked with has seen her,
My dad told me that he read about how her spirit haunts Vegors Cemetary
in a book written over 50 years ago.(which i tried to find the book but
he has so many i couldnt find it)&nbsp; He also told me that if you
stop in front of her grave she will follow you around the graveyard til
you leave.<br>
That is my experience of Vegors Cemetary..i have friends that have gone
out there more than i have and have had different experiences...One
friend told me that&nbsp; on Mrs. Henry Lott's grave they call it the
hot/cold stone...this friend told me that one side is extremely cold
and one side is extremely hot and that my friend burnt herself on the
hot side, but i dont know if i believe her....i will never know...<br>
Thank you for letting me tell you my experience.<br>

Older House in NH<br>
<br>
By: cute_lil_angel_from_the_south@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My name is Catie, and I have something to share with you. I was living
in an older house in NH, it was a three floor house, with someone else
living on the bottom floor. The night that we first moved in, I was in
my new room, just laying there, on my bed, missing my old home, when
above me I heard Crying, soft crying, like a womans. My mother told me
that it was all in my head. So I tried to forget about it. A few days
later, she was also in&nbsp; my room when it happened again. Above my
room was another room, and then above that was a small circled room,
there was no way into it. that we knew of at the time. So the next
night, my mother, her friend and I went up stairs and looked into the
closet. The was a board nailed to the wall, we tore it down and seen a
passage way, my mother entered the room, hands empty, and came back
with a white old style dress. we never re-boarded up the room, just
closed the closet and never opened it again.<br>
With the years that we lived in the house, at any sign of my mothers ex
huband, and him being abusive weird things would happen. Our Back door
would open and close. lights would come on and off in parts of the
house no one was in. One night we had plates hanging on the wall, her
ex husband was in a angry mood and hit my brother, later he had to be
rushed to the er, because a plate that was in the living room was
thrown into his bedroom and hit him in the head. I was in bed sleeping
when it happened, but i got blamed, for he had seen a young woman in
white wearing it.<br>
whenever my brothers and I were alone in the house at night, you could
hear an old radio being played and a woman humming softly. I had seen
her once when i was afraid of something, she was in a really old styled
white dress with long black hair. she stood over my hand and held her
hand to her mouth, as if to tell me to stop crying, it would all be
okay.&nbsp; Over the years we lived in that house, everyone but my
mother had seen her. My brother had also seen a man in a butlers
outfit, a young man about the woman's age standing in the third floor
near the closet. <br>
Later I looked up the house and its history, and was told that a very
powerful banker had lived in that house and he had a beautiful daughter
who just disappeared one night, and after the night the stair case in
the upstairs livingroom was removed, and the butler three nights later
was found dead. it is believed that the woman and the man were having
an affair, and her father found out and locked her alive in the circled
room. we never found anything though besides the dress and the room had
a nasty smell to it, that was only in that room. <br>
the people who lived below us had said no one lived in the house as
long as we had. because of the sounds of crying. the people believe we
unlocked the woman from being trapped in the house, but she stayed to
help us children from being abused from my mothers ex husband, for she
was really only seen or heard from when he was angry or drinking, when
he came most abusive.....<br>

My Grandmother's Experiences<br>
<br>
By: ineztrigg@comcast.net<br>
<br>
Hello to all of you. After several years of reading your experiences, I
have decided to contribute some of my own and my family's. The first
story deals with my grandmother. I believe that she was somewhat
"gifted". My grandmother's first experience happened when she was a
child in northern Spain. She lived in the countryside, in a village
called Trasmontes, I believe, near the city of Oviedo. She recalled
that one day, while walking home with an older brother, they saw a
parade of people, dressed all in black, approaching them. The people
were walking out of the town, going towards the church and town
graveyard. Her brother whispered to her that someone must have died and
a funeral procession was coming. This was strange to them, since the
town was small and news always travelled fast. They stopped by the side
of the road and bowed their heads in respect. As the first of the
people reached them, they both heard a sorrowful voice say to them, "go
home quickly because your brother XXXX has died". When they looked up,
no one was around; the entire funeral procession had disappeared! They
both had a very bad feeling and ran, crying, the last mile home. As you
can guess, when they got there, that is what had happened. A few days
later, they were part of a similar procession going down the same road.
<br>
My grandmother went on to have quite a few more experiences. After she
had grown up and married, she lived in the U.S. for a few years and
then moved to Cuba. While she lived in Cuba, she lived in a very
haunted house. This was in the 40's and this house was over two
centuries old at the time. In the past, it had been a garrison for
Spanish soldiers. My grandfather worked nights, so my grandmother was
on her own with her children every weeknight. Since the house was
located in the countryside, with the nearest neighbor over a mile away,
she slept with a loaded gun by her side. One night, she woke to see a
man, dressed as a soldier from the 1700's standing in the doorway. He
was smiling and leaning casually against the doorframe. Under his arm,
a young African slave boy stuck his head out and smiled at her too,
whereupon the soldier gently pushed his head back into the shadows. He
then took off his plumed hat and bowed to her. She closed her eyes and
began to pray and when she opened them, he was gone. She never saw him
again, but she and the entire family soon began to hear things. She
always felt watched and every day, at 3pm, the family would hear the
sound of a large stone rocking back and forth in the corner of the
living room. Every night, the front door would bang very loudly, until
someone went to answer it. This door was huge, it was a foot thick and
was so big that there was actually a smaller door cut into it, which is
what you had to open. Every time it happened, there was never anyone
visible there, and there was no place for a joker to hide. Things came
to a head and finally my grandmother threatened my grandfather that she
would leave with the kids if he didn't move them out of that house. My
grandfather decided to track down a man who was well known in the area
as being a spiritual medium. The man came to their home with an
assistant and entered into a trance. He had not been given any details
of the haunting but he related to them everything that was happening.
He stated that the spirit of a soldier was hanging around because he
had buried his life's savings nearby and he wanted someone to have the
treasure. He said that the soldier wanted my grandmother to have it
because she was a good woman. Having heard countless stories about
people being cursed when they dug up treasure, my grandmother spoke out
that she wanted no part of it. She just wanted to be left alone. The
medium communicated this to the spirit and the seance was ended. My
mother's family continued to live in this house for several years
afterwards, but they never experienced anything strange again. A few
years after they had moved out, my mother and grandmother bumped into
the woman who was living in the house after they left. The woman asked
them if they had ever heard strange noises in the house. When they
asked her what she meant, she replied that she could hear people
walking around with heavy boots and she always felt like she was being
watched. Many years later, after my family left Cuba for the States, my
grandmother heard from a friend back in Cuba that Castro's government
had converted the house into a school. My guess is that the old soldier
is still walking and waiting to give someone his treasure.<br>

I was Annoyed at First<br>
<br>
<br>
By:Medic5329@gbronline.com<br>
<br>
One night I was at the computer talking to someone about ghosts.&nbsp;
It was late but I wasn't tired so I chatted on.&nbsp; I got the feeling
of being watched but no one was awake, the whole house was quiet.&nbsp;
All of a sudden I got put off line and at the same moment started to
smell cigarette smoke.&nbsp; The prior owner who died had been a heavy
smoker.&nbsp; I got back on line and again after a short time got
thrown off athis went on and on for 5 or 6 times.&nbsp; <br>
I was getting annoyed as this never happens or hasn't happened to this
computer in the 3 years I have owned it.&nbsp; I got so annoyed I said
"Ok show your self!".&nbsp; Just after I said this I got thrown off
line again.&nbsp; I was really annoyed not knowing if it were computer
problem or my local spook.&nbsp; <br>
What happened next almost floored me.&nbsp; The light in the room I was
working in flashed off- on- off- on- off- on about 4 cycles.&nbsp; I
was wide awake at the time and not taking drugs or drinking.&nbsp; The
computer screen didn't go out or even flicker, I do not have battery
back up for power failure so the machine would have gone off it power
was lost.&nbsp; The screen didn't flicker, I was not even knocked off
line and I told the person I was talking to what had happened.&nbsp; It
scared the life out of me.<br>
I took out a digital camera and went into the hall out side the
computer room and took pictures.&nbsp; I took photos of the room next
door, the prior owner's [dead] bedroom.&nbsp; I looked at the photos
and embossed or wrinkled into the poster for the movie Titanic is a
white face,&nbsp; the face is also reflected in a characterature of my
daughter.&nbsp; The Titanic poster had no specific bends just the 4
crease lines from having been folded but now it had a face.&nbsp; To
this day I still see the creases and the face.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
I have a bad back and at times it would spasm while on the
stairs.&nbsp; Many times I have felt a hand push me so as not to
fall.&nbsp; At the top of the stairs is a door with a 1/4-1/2 inch
opening at the bottom, if going up late at night looking into the
bathroom door way , in the hall at the top of the stairs across from
the stairway door, I see two black heavy shoes as an old woman would
wear.&nbsp; Any coincidence?&nbsp; I doubt it. <br>
When I am spooked out or feeling like being watched I will say a prayer
going up the stairs and when I do this I never get the feeling of being
watched or see the "shoes".<br>

Number 78 <br>
<br>
By stargard102@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp; I&#8217;ve had a number of experiences with possible ghosts, a little
blonde girl on some stairs, a strangely lit figure on a seawall and
what may have been the ghost of a Samurai, but these experiences, while
strange and difficult to explain, were all located outside my home.
This experience occurred not only in my home, but suddenly and
inexplicably in a house we had lived in for years with no disturbances.
The house is on Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan and is typical generic
government quarters,&nbsp; three bedrooms and two bathrooms upstairs
and a laundry room, kitchen and living room/dining room downstairs.<br>
&nbsp; We moved into the house in late 1989 and lived there until
December 2004, but it wasn&#8217;t until the last year we lived there that
unexplained things began to happen. I started noticing things when I
was home alone or when it was early in the morning and everyone else
was upstairs asleep. At first it was just quiet sounds as if someone
were on the stairs, but so faint that they could be dismissed as noise
from outside or even imagination. As time went by, however, these
sounds got louder and more pronounced and a little more difficult to
explain. Since I was in the Navy and stationed on a ship, and therefore
away quite a bit,&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t hear the sounds all too often and I
didn&#8217;t mention them to my family both because I didn&#8217;t want to frighten
them and also I wasn&#8217;t sure they would believe me.<br>
&nbsp;Towards the end of 2004 I was getting ready to retire and was
taking all my accumulated leave (vacation days) so I was home much more
than usual. Since my wife worked early in the morning and I was used to
waking up early, I often found myself downstairs alone in the morning
while my children were upstairs asleep. It was quiet and I would sit at
my computer in a small breakfast nook in the kitchen and surf the net.
At first I heard the faint sounds on the stairs, but only once in
awhile so I continued to ignore them, but then things changed. I
started hearing someone coming down the stairs, not faint sounds like
before, but footsteps coming down the stairs and along the hallway
toward the kitchen. These were whispery footsteps, the kind made by
someone wearing socks or slippers and, thinking it was one of my
children, I would turn to greet who ever was coming into the kitchen,
but no one would be there. I would get up and search the whole
downstairs area and find no one, then go upstairs to find all three of
my children still asleep. Then one morning I heard someone coming and
turn in time to see someone walk past the door to the kitchen. I only
saw her for a brief moment, but I saw enough to know it was a woman and
she was wearing a white nightgown. I quickly got up and went into the
hallway but again no one was there and the only place she could have
gone was out the front door which was locked from the inside. <br>
&nbsp;One day my youngest daughter and I were watching TV in the living
room while everyone else was out of the house when I heard the
footsteps on the stairs. I turned to look at my daughter and found her
looking at the hallway. I asked if she heard the footsteps too and she
said she did and that she&#8217;d heard them several times while alone in the
house. She also told me she was watching TV one day and saw the
reflection of a woman in the glass of our entertainment center. She
said the woman walked into the living room from the kitchen and that
the woman was wearing a nightgown and had white socks on her feet. My
daughter said she turned to looked directly at the woman but no one was
there. <br>
&nbsp;We lived I that house for fourteen years before I noticed
anything strange and my youngest daughter and I were the only ones who
heard the footsteps or saw the woman. I remember telling my son once
that I never felt safe in that house, but I couldn&#8217;t say why, maybe I
sensed something all a long. We&#8217;ve moved out of the house now and live
off base in a nice little Japanese house. This house is old, but it&#8217;s
got a nice feel to it, kind of friendly and contented, and I do feel
safe here. Not too long ago I was on base and, since I was in the area,
I walked by the house, which was empty and awaiting renovation. As I
walked toward the house I looked up at the second story windows of what
had been my bedroom and for a second I thought I saw someone standing
in the room a few feet back from the window.<br>
&nbsp;At that point I decided I didn&#8217;t really want to see the old house after all and left.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;I don&#8217;t know why these disturbances would start suddenly after so
many years, I don&#8217;t know anything about the history of the house, but
my father in law suffered a stroke there and later died. I don&#8217;t think
he has anything to do with it though, my daughter and I both saw a
woman. Perhaps we bought something that had a spirit attached to it or
maybe there was a spirit there all along and she got used to us and was
upset that we were leaving. What ever the reason, it was strange and if
anyone has any suggestions, please feel free to write and let me know.<br>

When I was Sixteen it Happened<br>
<br>
By: woolleydj@comcast.net <br>
<br>
I don't know how to really tell the story, I mean I don't know what to
make of it, but it happened to me in the summer of 1986.&nbsp; My name
is Dave and I grew up in an LDS family living in Southern
California.&nbsp; I always strived to be good and honest in my
dealings.&nbsp; I had problems with my family because I wasn't allowed
to do things with my none Mormon friends. I was the kid at school who
couldn't attend the sex education courses, or the one whose parents
came with him to the school skating rink party, really embarrassing in
the age where you want to fit in.&nbsp; So I started to rebel because
of my never ending punishment, or so it seemed to be.&nbsp; I began to
smoke marijuana and drink beer when I was fifteen and really began to
change mentally.&nbsp; I didn't care anymore about my future plans and
at the same time the fights with my parents began to increase.&nbsp; I
just wanted a normal life, but the orthodox view my parents had for my
family felt suffocating.&nbsp; Well I started to think that if I
continued to party and be out of control, I would have no future.&nbsp;
So I prayed one night and decided to quit drugs and heal the hurt that
had been going on for a few years.&nbsp; That night something really
weird and unexplainable happened to me that I cannot ever forget.&nbsp;
I don't know if it was ghosts or a ghost or something more maybe a
fallen angel, an alien UFO contact or whatever it was.&nbsp; I had
fallen asleep with the intention to start over and start a new
day.&nbsp; Suddenly in the middle of the night I just woke up.&nbsp; I
mean I was sound asleep and I just woke up, alert like I never fell
asleep.&nbsp; My room is adjacent to a street light that shines light
dimly through my white window shades so even at night there is a faint
light in my room all the time.&nbsp; I woke up thinking why the hell
did I just wake up, but I soon realized it was not of my doing. I was
lying on my stomach when I was asleep, so I turned over on to my back
pondering why this happened when I saw that I had no light in my room
at all.&nbsp; It felt as though I was suffocating, I couldn't even see
my hand in front of my face.&nbsp; I thought that the street light had
gone out, but the dark was really weird and odd, I felt really cold, I
remember the feeling was so bad, the only thing I could think of was to
leave, and leave right now get out of my room.&nbsp; I decided to get
the hell out of my room, but suddenly I was forced back down, I don't
think I even moved, just started to move, but was unable to.&nbsp;
There was nothing but pitch black , but something was holding me down.
I couldn't move my arms, legs, neck, nothing!!&nbsp; I was so scared I
can't put into words the horror I felt, it was out of a movie, but
really happening.&nbsp; I am not making this up, it was
bullshit!!&nbsp; I couldn't scream, I tried to yell and all I could do
was barely mumble, I truly was scared to death practically shitting my
pants, I didn't know what to do.&nbsp; The only thing that I could
think of was really nothing, the feeling and physical experience was
overwhelming I can relate it too the movie "Jaws", in the beginning
when the naked girl swims out to the bowie and gets dragged down the
first time by Jaws, comes back up and starts breathing really fast,
scared, panting.&nbsp; Anyhow, I fought this thing the only way I knew
how, the only thing I could do.&nbsp; For you none religious people
you'll probably wont care, but that's okay.&nbsp; I just kept repeating
the words over and over in my head," In the name of Jesus Christ I
command you to leave", or something similar to that.&nbsp; After what
seemed forever, but was only about a minute, 45 seconds or so, The
ghost, apparition let go of me.&nbsp; I rushed out of my room and ran
into my parents room and told them the about this utter bullshit I had
experienced.&nbsp; They took it pretty lightly which kind of pissed me
off, It way the most bruttle, frightening experience and they brushed
it off, I even had to go back in my room and sleep the rest of the
night.&nbsp; Well it hasn't happened since I think, it might have, but
I&nbsp; stopped it from happening again by repeating those words in my
head, but my experience has left me strongly aware of such activities
if they happen again.&nbsp; I am mentally stronger than I was once
before.&nbsp; I don't know if I believe in ghosts, or demons, of
Aliens, because I go in and out searching for truths everyday.&nbsp;
This is just my story and it happened and that is what I did.&nbsp; I
don't know if it happened because I decided to change my life for the
better and some evil force was trying to stop me or what.&nbsp; All I
know is that there are creepy forces out there that are not nice and in
other words hostile.&nbsp; I have yet to see good forces unless I am
blind and the good things in my life are those good forces at work,
which I am sure they are and at the present are helping those who are
bettering their lives. Believe it or not, this is the truth, this is
all I can say.<br>

walking towards the back of the cemetry, when suddely i saw a strange man <br>

Old Farmhouse<br>
<br>
By: lgibson@bis.midco.net<br>
<br>
we grew up in an old farmhouse that been in my stepfather's family for
many years. we always had the feeling that there was something else
there. my sister and i shared a room when i was about 12 or thirteen
and she was 10 or 11. we where just about to fall asleep when we heard
the front door open then close. we heard footsteps go through the
living room and throuhg the kitchen. the back dor opened up and then
closed. we watched out the window of our bedroom to see if it was our
parents but we never saw anyoneone go by the window. many years later
my father and i were at church. when we came home, my husband and
brother where standing outside each holding a gun. we thought that they
were going to hunt pheasants, but they told us they heard laughter
coming from my brother's bedroom and then they heard the basement door
open up and footsteps run down the steps. when they went downstairs
there was no one there. their was also the outlone of a man in a
bowler;s hat that had ben on the coalshute door every since i was a
little girl. dad died in 20001. the farm was sold and i don't know if
there has been anything else reported.<br>

Truck Stop<br>
<br>
By: jynx327@gtlakes.com<br>
<br>
I began reading some of the stories and felt relieved to know that
other people have had experiences similar to mine. Here is one I hope
you enjoy.<br>
My husband and I were over the road truck drivers, we were in Ontario,
Ca. waiting to load flowers going to Chicago, Il., I called to see what
time we needed to be there, and they said our load was cancelled and
that we had to wait till the morning to get another one.&nbsp; I walked
back in the truck stop to relay this to my husband and we were having a
cup of coffee when a man walked up to me and said," your load got
cancelled didn't it?"&nbsp; I thought this was our agent that got our
load,(but I was wondering how he knew what we looked like since we only
had talked on the phone).&nbsp; The man introduced himself as a writer
for the Los Angles Times, he and his son were driving by the truckstop
and he felt a strange urge that he had to stop because there was
someone waiting for him inside. He said that he walked in and
immediately walked up to me and that is when he said that our load had
been cancelled, I thought he was trying to scam me or something like
that so I was trying to just blow him off.&nbsp; He know I was
uncomfortable and he turned to me and took of his ring and said, "hold
on to this and tell me what you see in your mind", no sooner had he
said that when I visioned a man from India with a turban and a mole
between his nose and cheek, so I flippantly told him that.&nbsp; At the
moment his son walked up to us and his father said for him to show me
the picture of the man the ring had belonged to, and it was the man I
had described.&nbsp; I was so freaked out that I had to leave, I felt I
couldn't take a deep breath.<br>
My husband stayed a little longer than I did and spoke with him, they
walked over to the news stand and bought a copy of the Los Angles Times
and his picture was in there under the physic column, he told my
husband that he would pay me to answer letter written in to him by rich
people and celebrities because I had the power and he could cense
it.&nbsp; I never did because that kind of thing has always scared
me.&nbsp; But I wonder from time to time if I should have.<br>

One week after the death of my cat i woke up in my bed and i opened my

to his death so i laid my hand on him, closed my eyes again and felt
his soft fur against my hand and a second after that i remembered it
all so i quickly moved my hand and opened my eyes but there was no cat
to see, but the place where i had seen him was warm and on my hand
there was cat hair and at that time i only had one cat and he was, is

My Oklahoma Experiences<br>
<br>
<br>
By: nhayes@loganlowry.com<br>
<br>
I was a resident of Pryor, Oklahoma for 32 years until I recently moved
to Miami, Oklahoma.&nbsp; I have some experiences to share as far as
several of the places you list are concerned.<br>
1.&nbsp; Side Pockets in Pryor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the guy that
owns the pool hall.&nbsp; When you walk in, you definitely get a chill
that runs down your back.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen a shadowy figure standing in
corners.&nbsp; Also, if you go into his storage room, you can sometimes
see the figure but ALWAYS feel as though you are being watched.&nbsp;
The owner said that the shadowy figure resembles a man in a long coat.<br>
2. Crybaby bridge.&nbsp; As a kid, we used to frequent this place
looking for ghosts.&nbsp; There has always been the stories of the baby
crying, but there is (fact) also a cemetery that can only be accessed
by that road that went over Crybaby Bridge called Alberty&#8217;s Cemetary,
(there is also a a road that is owned by GRDA and locked always that
can be used to access it).&nbsp; The cemetery has been vandalized
severely and the rumor about 15 years ago that was going around was
that devil worshippers held their rituals down there.&nbsp; My friend
and I would always venture to the bridge during the day because,
frankly, we are both girls and both chicken.&nbsp; But one night, we
decided to go down there to check things out.&nbsp; Now, every single
time we would go down there during the day, our vehicle, which ran
smoothly, would always start to spit and sputter until we would
leave.&nbsp; The one night we went down there to see the bridge&#8230; we
started getting a really weird feeling, then all of a sudden the lights
on her truck went out (and no, she didn&#8217;t turn them off, I
checked).&nbsp; We were scared to death, so we turned around and as
soon as we started heading out of there, her lights came back on.&nbsp;
Her mechanic checked out her lights and there wasn&#8217;t any electrical
problems or anything (and she never did have any more problems).&nbsp;
Needless to say, we still don&#8217;t go down there during the day.&nbsp;
They tore the bridge down several years ago so there was no access to
the cemetery unless you luck into knowing someone who works for GRDA
and happens to have a key.&nbsp; BUT, this past Memorial Day, GRDA
allowed access to the cemetery for families of the deceased to
visit.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t have any family there, but we just had to see the
cemetery that was infamous for supposed occult rituals.&nbsp; We got to
the cemetery, which is tucked back in the woods and terribly overgrown
(except for a part that had been cleaned up by family members) and
immediately got a weird feeling.&nbsp; Upon walking around, we were
saddened to see so much vandalism and damage, but we were startled to
find a grave and that obviously been dug up.&nbsp; The hole was still
there as well as the headstone.&nbsp; It was pretty freaky.<br>
3. Quapaw, Oklahoma &#8211; Spooklight Road.&nbsp; Well, as luck would have
it, I went to college in Miami (about 10 minutes away) and now live in
Miami.&nbsp; In college we would frequent the road to look for the
light.&nbsp; Many times we never would see anything.&nbsp; (Legend says
if it is too noisy or too many people it would not come out, this
proved true).&nbsp; But one night about 7 of us were out there and it
appeared.&nbsp; It looked to be about a half mile away and appeared at
first as one big white light.&nbsp; The light moved around from left to
right, up and down for about 3 or 4 seconds before it glowed a bright
yellow and split into two lights.&nbsp; These two lights would glow
white and yellow and move around each other.&nbsp; Then they went back
together to form one light that glowed bright white and yellow several
times before fading away.&nbsp; This whole event lasted about 3
minutes.&nbsp; It still comes out but the road is now patrolled by
county sheriffs.<br>
4. Ripley &#8211; Ghost Hollow.&nbsp; My dad&#8217;s family grew up and has a spot
down on the Cimarron River just about 2 miles from Ghost Hollow.&nbsp;
We still have the original homeplace with a little cabin on it that the
family goes down to many times throughout the year to fish, hunt,
etc.&nbsp; So I grew up knowing all the legends and lore of Ghost
Hollow.&nbsp; My grandfather tells the tale of the outlaws that robbed
a neighboring town and fled into the hills of the holler and the
vigilantes that came and captured and/or killed them.&nbsp; He said
that for a long time the &#8220;kissing trees&#8221;&nbsp; (thusly named because
there were two trees that grew wrapped around each other, entwined I
guess is a better word) stood and that was where the outlaws were hung.
He said ever since that happened, the outlaws haunted that area.&nbsp;
Another part of the legend was that every seven years, someone would
die in the holler.&nbsp; Now, I&#8217;m sure that that particular part of the
story was for the sake of the children&#8217;s ghost story around the fire at
night, but one year we went down to the holler and I&#8217;ll be danged if
there wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;makeshift memorial&#8221; for a girl that had died down
there.&nbsp; (It is still there, but the cross has been vandalized a
little) and off of the road a bit is a headstone of some man that died
many years ago.&nbsp; I go down to the holler every time I go to the
&#8220;farm&#8221;.&nbsp; Over the years, the trees rotted and died and the kids
that partied in the holler had no respect and spray painted them and
eventually burned them.&nbsp; Only parts of the trunks still
stand.&nbsp; When you go into the holler, you get that creepy feeling
that we all get on occasion and twice I have seen some shadowy figure
standing in the trees seemingly watching us.&nbsp; One time me and 2 of
my friends were down in the holler by the trees and I was telling them
all the stories my grandfather had told me.&nbsp; When I got to the
part about the outlaws haunting the holler, the wind suddenly came from
every direction (mind you this is a holler with thick trees and hills
surrounding it), so much so that it blew my long hair straight up in
the air.&nbsp; That was enough for my friend to get scared and want the
heck out of there, lol.&nbsp; But to this day, even though it is
populated with many homes, you can still drive down the road that takes
you by what used to be the &#8220;kissing&#8221; aka hanging trees.<br>
5. There is a place on the Delaware/Mayes county line by the town
called Rose that is the first Cherokee Courthouse in Indian
Territory.&nbsp; It is Saline Courthouse and is very haunted. (The
Pryor Daily Times once wrote an article about the courthouse and the
reporter documented hearing footsteps upstairs while interviewing the
caretaker. The story is available via microfiche at the county
library).&nbsp; There is a huge amount of history involving the
courthouse on this site:&nbsp; http://www.salinecourthouse.org .&nbsp;
I used to go to the courthouse back in high school and had a something
happen every time.&nbsp; The court house had a caretaker, but it was
always easy to know if they were there or not by a vehicle in the
driveway or the lack of a vehicle.&nbsp; So when there was no vehicle
we would park our truck by the headstones by the road and run to the
courthouse.&nbsp; More than once we would see lights on upstairs (no
electricity in the house) and see shadowy figures all over the
property.&nbsp; One night we were able to get into the courthouse and
as is usual in places like this it was terribly vandalized.&nbsp; There
were four of us and one flashlight (smart, huh?).&nbsp; Two of us, Jeff
and Lori decided to stay downstairs and so me and my boyfriend ventured
upstairs with the flashlight. We looked around upstairs and didn&#8217;t see
anything unusual.&nbsp; When we went back downstairs one of our friends
said something along the lines of &#8220;ha ha, very funny trying to scare
us, we saw you guys standing over there&#8221; and pointed to one corner of a
large downstairs room.&nbsp; We told them that we were upstairs and
there is only one staircase in the courthouse.&nbsp; We shined our
light over in the corner and verified our story. There was no way for
us to be two places at once.&nbsp; They got terrified and said that
they saw two people over in that corner and thought we were trying to
scare them.&nbsp; Our two friends wasted no time getting out of the
courthouse, so my boyfriend and I followed.&nbsp; We had all made it
out of the courthouse when my boyfriend decided he wanted to check out
the jail.&nbsp; Lori mentioned that she felt like she was being watched
and all of a sudden, coyotes started howling all around us.&nbsp; Jeff
and looked over into the tree line and saw 3 whitish figures.&nbsp;
Lori and I started running for the truck as were quickly passed by Jeff
running at top speed.&nbsp; He jumped in my truck and had it started
and was getting ready to pull out by the time Lori and I made it.&nbsp;
My boyfriend, totally unaware of what we had seen was still nosing
around the jail.&nbsp; We called for him to hurry up.&nbsp; I have been
back since, but only driving by.. I still see the lights on inside
upstairs.<br>
I know these stories are long, and I know you wont&#8217; put them all up on
the website, but I wanted to let you know my stories of the Oklahoma
places.<br>
Thanks!!<br>

House Being Haunted<br>
<br>
By: andyhatesyou2006@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
okay well, a few years&nbsp; back i spent the night at my<br>
friends christinas house (they had always been very<br>
open and honest about the fact they thought their<br>
house was haunted... i believed them but this mad me a<br>
true believer.) and the next morning i decided to go<br>
to church with her. I didn't have any clothes to wear<br>
so I borrowed some of hers. when we got back from<br>
church i called my dad and told him to come pick me<br>
up. i went into my friends bathroom to change out of<br>
the clothes she had lent me and while i was changing I<br>
VERY CLEARLY heard a long fingernail tap on the glass<br>
of the window three times. now i was completely alone<br>
in the bathroom and its a very small bathroom so i<br>
would know if it was just her hiding and trying to<br>
play a trick on me. also the window is completely<br>
bare, no shades, no curtains, nothing. and on the<br>
otherside of the window there are no trees or branches<br>
anywhere near the window.... i quickly ran threw the<br>
rest of my clothes on and ran out of the bathroom to<br>
tell her what happened. when i exited the bathroom i<br>
found her and her parents (shes an only child) in the<br>
kitchen. i asked them if they had taped on the glass<br>
and they said no, they hadn't even been outside. i<br>
went outside to investigate and found nothing even<br>
near the winow. these arent the type of people who<br>
would play that kind of joke on someone so i was sure<br>
it was a ghost.<br>
also another night i was spending the night at her<br>
house we had been up all night talking and after a<br>
while decided to go to sleep, so we both said<br>
goodnight and tried to go to sleep. well, ya know the<br>
random bumps and creeks you hear during the night?<br>
well there were alot of those, and very fequently we<br>
would hear them. we would heard them on the celing fan<br>
(which was turned off), the desk, the door, and then<br>
one reallly loud one on the computer... these noises<br>
continued on for a few minutes until we got sick of it<br>
and said&nbsp; "will you please stop making those noises?<br>
we are trying to sleep!" and the room went dead<br>
silent...so we settled down again and said goodnight<br>
to each other and then i said "goodnight spirits" and<br>
the celing fan clinked again...we thought that was<br>
pretty cool<br>

Baby Ghost<br>
<br>
By:rushhour@rtmc.net<br>
<br>
<br>
my wife and i moved into a house in feb 2003. i had bought the house
from a lady who's daughter used to live there until 1999 when she got
married and moved to texas. the house had been setting empty for about
3 years and needed<br>
alot of cleaning so me and my wife moved in and got to work fixing the place up.<br>
on about the 3rd day of being in the house my wife was in the basement
cleaning that afternoon and i was upstairs hooking up the satilite. she
had been cleaning about an hour or so when she came upstairs to ask me
what i did with her bottle of cleaner?<br>
i told her i did'nt get her cleaner she just forgot where she set it
down. she said she was just useing it in the basement and had not been
anywhere else. we looked high<br>
and low but never found it. a week or so later she woke me up and said she heard <br>
kids laughing and could'nt go to sleep. (we have no children) i told her i did'nt hear anything that she <br>
was crazy and to go back to sleep. a few day's later my sister came to stay the week<br>
with us as she often does because her husband is a truck driver and she does'nt<br>
like to be alone. the 2nd night my sister was in the house she woke me up and said<br>
she kept hearing children laughing. i thought she was as crazy as my wife so i went <br>
in the bedroom with her. after about 10 minutes of sitting in the bedroom with her i to<br>
heard laughing from what sounded like children. i just thought it was
strange and went on about my business. about 3 weeks after this
happened i woke up in the middle of <br>
the night about 3:00 am to what sounded like a baby crying. by now i
was used to all the strange sounds and i did'nt pay it much mind. as i
tried to go back to sleep the crying got much louder almost like the
baby was in the same room with me. by this <br>
time it was so loud it woke my wife. so i got up to see if i could find where the noise <br>
was comming from. as i walked in the livingroom the crying stopped and
i smelt something burning. i looked around and saw that a lamp on the
floor was smoking<br>
and the cord that ran to it had melted onto the carpet. there is no
doubt had i not woke up this would have caught fire and burnt down the
house with us in it.&nbsp; after this event i felt compelled to call
the lady i had bought the house from. when i told her of all the
strange things happening in the house she was stunned. she told me that
her daughter's husband and 3 kids had been killed in a car wreck in
1997. she said her daughter did'nt want the house after this because of
the memories. i checked out her story and it's all true. the children
were 5 year old girl a 3 year old boy and a 7 month old baby girl. my
wife and i still live in this house and still hear the kids often.
since we don't have children we kinda consider them like our own. and
they still like to play pranks on us....car key's missing.....light's
flipping off and on....things disappering.<br>
my only complaint is i can't file them on my taxes..lol.&nbsp; <br>

A Haunting in Gary Indiana,Black Oak Section<br>
<br>
By: AlliCat848603@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I never believed in hauntings at least not until I moved. My second
husband and my 3 teenage children were happy when we moved into the
large home on Hobart Street. There was plenty of space for all of us
and some left over. My twin daughter Allison noticed the strange
happenings first, Allison is very perceptive and capable of knowing
when a place has a spirit and whether the spirit is good or evil. At
first I dismissed her complaints of objects disappearing and then
turning up in a closet that I had in my back bedroom. Or the problems
she had sleeping, she kept saying that she heard a girls cries coming
from my bedroom and when she did fall asleep,she was awakened by
someone or something. Then soon my other children started complaining
of the exact same thing and soon their friends that came to spend the
night had the same stories of sounds of crying or objects disappearing,
and a cold eerie feeling,a feeling of evil, a evil presence. My
children then moved in with their Father to finish out high
school,because all of their friends lived where their father lived. So
I let them live with their dad for the last year of high school. My
husband and I both workedf evenings, but I got home before he did and
let me tell you, everytime I would have to walk into that house I would
get a very nauseous feeling. At first I thought that I was missing the
kids, but then the feelings got worse. I started having severe
headaches and things started disappearing and I would find them days
later in my back bedroom, after the kids moved, I moved my stuff to the
front bedroom. My husband started to change, he became mean and at
times even violent. But he only was this way when he was in the
house.It was like something had possessed him. Then I started having
nightmares of an evil spirit that told me in my nightmares that I was
going to be destroyed. My nightmares were vivid of my husband brutally
raping and killing me. But one night dreamt that there was two good
spirits that rubbed my aching head and gave me protection but they told
me that I would soon have to leave this house in order to save mine and
my husbands life. So thats what we did and now we sleep peacefully and
we are close again. The house on Hobart Street has since been rented
twice in the past two years, so far the family that lives there
now&nbsp; still resides there but I have noticed they don't stay home
much.<br>

Kentucky Story<br>
<br>
By: bllystephens@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
When I was a littlr boy my dad would tell us ghost story. well one time
he told us a story that made the hair on my neck stand up it was about
a hollow that was haunted .He told this story when he was younger he
walk to school he had to leave his house before daylight. as he walked
down the long dark hollow he heard something walking behind him
although he knew that he was alone so he stopped and turned around and
saw nothing the sound had stopped always. A little scared he turned and
through a rock on the hill thinking it might had been an animal the
rock would scare it off he started to walk again. He heard something
walking behind again. So he started to run. As fast as he ran it ran.
But I didn t believe him. Until I got older and saw for myself. I went
to the hollow with my sisters to play a prank on some friends.<br>
We would tell our friends that it was haunted and they would hear and
see things that would scare them to death. To make sure that they got
scare I would hide in the woods and make different sound just for laugh
we had done this many time but this time instead of my usually spot I
went to hide by the barn(nobody lived in the hollow anymore) and waited
for them to come walking by while waiting there in the dark I saw two
white figure floating above the road .I was scared I started to walk to
my car I turned around and saw the figure slowly descending into the
ground so I got in the car where my sisters where waiting I started to
tell them what happened they stopped me and told me that they saw
something we had seen the same white figure. By the time our friends
showed up we was to scared to scare them. On this trip we never figure
out what the white figure was. I now believe my dad.<br>

They Are Here<br>
<br>
By: yashi_rara@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My mom has always said that the house we grew up in was the old whore
house, that she was told this by one of the old ladies that used to
live in the neighborhood when we first moved in. I will admit that I
have not researched this for documentation, although all of the
downstairs carpet is red and all the wood flooring in the two upstairs
bedrooms is painted red. I remember being scared to go upstairs when I
was a kid, which is where my room was, but I don't recall any activity
in particular. In fact, it wasn't until I moved out to my first
apartment that I began to have questionable experiences.Three instances
in particular, stand out in my mind. The first was one day I was
sitting on the couch in the living room talking on the cordless phone
to my mom. Across the room on a side table was one of those gag ash
trays that talks when you touch it, saying "cough, cough, that's
disgusting!" It started to go off by itself, so I flipped the little
switch on the bottom to "off". I went off again so i removed the
batteries. When it went off again, having no power source, I picked it
up and threw it in the dumpster out back! Another time, I was sitting
with my back to the kitchen when I thought I heard the coffee pot
running, which was odd because I hadn't turned it on. When I turned to
see what was going on, I saw water dripping from the ceiling in the
kitchen. So I stuck a bowl under to catch the water ( kind of yellow
and rusty looking), and called the landlord to investigate. I only had
about a half inch of water and then it started to just drip slowly. The
landlord broke into the one apartment up stairs to see if there was a
tub overflowing or something, but he found nothing. Then he asked the
other upstairs tenants, but they said they were home the whole time and
nothing was running. After checking his pers, the landlord said he
couldn't even find a pipe nearby that could have leaked.<br>
The freakiest of all happened when I moved into the house I'm in now.
It's an old house right down the street where i grew up, but in 2004
when I was pregnant with my youngest, I laid down my then 2 year old
for a nap. He had been down for a while and I went in to the bathroom
to do some "business". I heard who I thought was my son get up and walk
out into the dining room. Usually he opens the bathroom door to find me
(whether I want him to or not) and so I called out to him since I
figured he was still sleepy and couldn't find me. He never opened the
door but walked around some more as if he was trying to find me, so I
called out to him again and told him I was in the bathroom. Still he
didn't open the door or call out like he normally did. I finished up in
the bathroom and expected to find him curled up on the couch when I
went out, but instead he was still in bed, under the covers, sweaty
with sleep, cheeks lined with pillow creases. I don't think he ever got
out of bed, but I still called out to him! Any spirits that reside
here, while unnerving, don't seem to be threatening, just letting me
know they are here.<br>

Residual Haunting<br>
<br>
By: acejohnnie@mts.net<br>
<br>
A FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME THIS STORY WHICH HAPPENED ABOUT 40 YEARS AGO.
ONENIGHT AS SHE WAS GOING FROM HER STUDY TO THE KITCHEN SHE NOTICED
THAT THE TVWAS ON IN THE LIVING ROOM. AS SHE WENT TO SHUT IT OFF SHE
NOTICED THAT THE TV WAS INDEED OFF, BUT THERE WAS AN IMAGE OF A HOUSE
ON THE SCREEN. THE DOOR THEN OPENED AND A PERSON CAME OUT, WALKED
AROUND THE YARD IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND THEN WENT BACK INSIDE THE
HOUSE. THIS EVENT REPEATED OVER AND OVER FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES AND THEN
THE IMAGE VANISHED FROM THE SCREEN. MY FRIEND DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE
PERSON NOR THE HOUSE. AS THIS EVENT WAS REPEATING ITSELF ON TV SHE
CALLED HER DAUGHTER WHO WAS IN THE KITCHEN . SHE ALSO WITNESSED THIS
EVENT. THE TV WAS AN OLD MANUAL BLACK &amp; WHITE MODEL WITH AN<br>
ATTACHED ANTENNA ON TOP OF IT (NO CABLE). I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A RESIDUAL<br>
HAUNTING BEING PLAYED OUT ON TV BEFORE. HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD A SIMILAR<br>
EXPERIENCE?<br>

Queen Mary Haunting<br>
<br>

<br>
My friend Arizona and I made our first trip to the Queen Mary together.
We happened to run into a paranormal researcher when we were on a tour
and decided to stay the night. We rented a room with two beds so the
researcher could stay with us and show us around the old boat in the
middle of the night when the most activity had been reported. We
attempted to fall asleep around 11:00. I managed to sleep quit easily
and wasn't scared about sleeping in one of the reported haunted rooms.
Abour five minutes after I fell asleep my friend wakes me up.The first
thing I remember was hearing a staticy voice and thought it was a
radio. It wasn't until She asked if I heard the voice that I realized
there was no radio anywhere in the room. My instant reaction was to
turn on the light and look around the room.&nbsp; I reached up and
tried turning on the light and nothing happened. We were really
freaking out now! The light had just been on. My friend finally turned
her light on and we laid there in bed for a few more minutes and I
decided to try the light again and this time it turned on no problem!
We tried to fall asleep again because we wanted to wonder around the
ship at 3:00 a.m. to avoid security gaurds. As soon as we turned off
the lights and laid down I saw my blanket push down and felt something
on my arm. My friend also reported feeling things brush against her
arm. As tired as we were we just decided to ignore it all and got to
sleep. <br>
3 O'clock rolled around and we went to the pool room. Reported to be
the most paranormally active area onboard. We took several pictures and
the researcher and my friend called out to the known ghosts. I didn't
want to because I really felt like I was intruding. I felt sad and
angry feelings throughtout the whole area. I was looking&nbsp; around
when we all heard a man moaning. The voice was very low and scratchy.
My friend and I booked it back up the stairs and stood against the
wall. After a few minutes we joined the researcher again and he
continued to call out to a little&nbsp; girl name Jackie. I&nbsp;
wasn't paying attention at the time but I heard my friend gasp and I
looked over and she asked me if I had heard that. I missed it! The
researcher heard it too. It was the voice of the little girl. She was
singing for them.<br>
I will never forget my experiences at the Queen Mary and actually plan
on going back soon. I came aboard not believeing and left a member of a
paranormal research group!<br>

My Story<br>
<br>

<br>
Heya,<br>
i've always believed in ghosts, i have tried to be sceptical but it just <br>
doesnt work. My mother is a methodist and attends church every sunday <br>
therefore she would like to believe that there are no such things as spirits <br>
etc.<br>
I always get the feeling of a spirit being present when it is <br>
dark(typically). I have never been a good sleeper, not in the sense that i <br>
cant sleep but in the sense that i talk in my sleep, once or twice i have <br>
sleep walked and when my parents divorced when i was three i had night <br>
terrors for a while(when basically you wake up on the outside but mentally <br>
and physically you are still asleep and in many cases start screaming in <br>
your sleep and parents/guardians cannot wake you easily). From when i was <br>
about 9 to when i was about 11 i would always be consious of something bad <br>
in my room, and yes i can accept that sometimes i did make the image of them <br>
worse in my head as you do when you are younger! I did try an tell my mother <br>
and step dad about these things in my room but they never believed me and <br>
put it down to an over active imagination. Sometimes the things would get to <br>
scary for me and i would have to go and sleep in my mothers room, but she <br>
got fed up with this firstly becasue i would wake her up in all hours of the <br>
night and secondly i was getting to old to be doing this! I even scared my <br>
mom sometimes because i would wrap my blanket around meto try and protect <br>
myself so it would almost suffocate me! Anyway one night it all got too much <br>
and i started to scream and cry so my mother had a go at me and put me in my <br>
brothers room and for some strange reason after this i was wasnt scared of <br>
the things in my room.<br>
Anyway as i said they dont scare me but i occasionaly wake up and hear <br>
things talkin to me-and i dont know if this is me being half awake,or im <br>
going mad or there is actually something!Once the thing seemd to get angry, <br>
but i just put it down to me being half asleep so i tried to go back to <br>
sleep but the thing said something angrilyand i got the feeling of it coming <br>
closer and one of the pillows on the side of my bed(it was propped up) <br>
flopped down heavily.<br>
now i am nearly 14 and when im down or im upset and start crying i feel <br>
something cold brush my cheek as if to try and wipe my tears away. This is <br>
touching and i like to think i have a friend in this being. I do not know of <br>
anybody dying in my house. The house was built in the 1930's so it is not <br>
really that old.Also at times when i was younger i could have sworn there <br>
was a dark figure behind my bedroom door, as scary as it was at the time i <br>
like to think it was protecting me aginst anything bad coming into my room. <br>
My dad is also interested in the paranormal so when i am older we are going <br>
to do an investiagtion into it. I hope i have not wasted your time!<br>

Multiple Stories<br>
<br>
By: lottsrus@personainternet.com<br>
<br>
We have lived in a few different houses and have had different things
happen in each of them.&nbsp; The first one we noticed that our
television would come on in the middle of the night with the sound as
high as it could go.&nbsp; We had it checked and there was nothing that
would explain it.&nbsp; We gave the TV away and it didn't do it in the
new surroundings.&nbsp; <br>
Second story is in our townhouse.&nbsp; We have a cat named Chelsea and
she was at the top of the stairs one day looking down towards the front
door.&nbsp; I came to find her because I could hear her growling and
when I saw her she was as puffed up as she could make herself.&nbsp; I
checked to see if I could see anything out the door or on the stairway
but there was nothing.&nbsp; This went on for a couple of minutes and
she finally just ran away.<br>
Thirdly.&nbsp; In our new house both of my girls have reported seeing a
female person with long hair and a white dress on.&nbsp; They have also
reported being in the bathtub and the faucet in the bathroom sink has
come on by itself.&nbsp; <br>
I'm not sure that any of these things can be explained, but I know that I do believe in ghosts.&nbsp; <br>
It would be interesting to hear what you think about these events.<br>

Ghost Stories 1-2-3<br>
<br>
By: vixen_vamp8@hotmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The Old CoupleThis story happened in 'Cheavely' nr 'Newbery' about 21
years ago when I was about 5. It IS a TRUE story.....When I was a young
I lived with my parents and brother and sister in a small 4 bedroom
council house that had never seemed to have any sort of paranormal
activity before. Every summer we would go on holiday with our caravan
and very best friends and there caravan. This year was no different. It
was the summer and we had all left our house with friends in too and
headed to "Cornwall" We were gone for 2 weeks. We all had a really
fantastic time. When we came back everything seemed fine until a few
days later my mum ran into an old friend of hers in the village shop.
They were very pleased to see each other and her friend asked my mum
where she was living now. My mum told her she was living in the same
house as before in Cheavely. The woman then asked if my mum she had had
people staying at her house while we had all gone on holiday? My mum
was a little worried and asked why? Her friend then said not more the a
week ago she had called to see my mum, not knowing we had gone on
holiday. She said they an old lady had answered the door and said there
was no Sue or Pete (my mum and dad) living at that address.....As soon
as my mum got home she then questioned our neighbours, who had been
feeding our animals while we were away, and asked if they had seen
anything or herd anything? They told my mum that a few times they had
gone round the house and there had been an empty milk bottle on the
front door step. Then another day they found the front door had been
left open but as they could see that nothing in the house had been
moved or taken, they just put it down to there clumsiness and that they
forgot to look the door. A week then past and a few more little stories
started to come to light. A few people said they had seen a caravan
parked in our drive and then a few more people had seen an elderly
couple going in and out of our house. Neighbours just thought we had
people staying at our house while we were away looking after the place.
The funny thing was only half the street had seen anything the other
half said they saw nothing. My mum and dad were really worried about
all these stories that they called out the police. As the police did
there investigations they also found that it was 50/50 with only 50%
seeing something but it was still to many of the same stories for it to
be a hoax. As nothing had happened to us directly yet, we tried to get
on with things until an almost normal sunday evening, when we were all
sat in the front room watching the 'Antiques Roodshow' when my mum
started to notice a very strong smell of bleach. This ended up getting
so strong that she felt it burning the inside of her nose. The really
strange thing was, none of us could smell anything at all. Then I
remember feeling really cooled sat next to an open log fire and then a
coat hanger hanging on the bird cage that was hanging from the ceiling,
start to swing really violently which made our bird go mad. This is all
I can remember of that night. Not long after this happened, my sister
was having a bath. With the rest of the family in the garden she was
starting to get out, and she herd some very heavy breathing and
dragging feet coming towards the bathroom. As the sound got louder she
started to get very scared and ran out of the bathroom without
stopping. As she ran onto the landing she knocked into someone or
something and herd it fall against the wall but she didn't stop to look
back. When they all went back to look they didn't find anything only
what looked like a pattern on the carpet of something dragging there
feet........As for the elderly couple, nothing was found out about them
and they were never seen again. If anyone dos know anything about the
past history of this house 'Freeways, Cheavely, Newbery, Berkshire,'
please email me at vixen_vamp8@hotmail.com. To this day the families
that move into that house don't seem to live there for longer then a
year now or so I've been told. Thank you for taking the time to read my
story. I would like it to become an Urban Legend one day, you never
know. All I can say is that this experience will never leave me and
I'll never forget it even though I was only 5........ Our local
newspaper found out about our haunting, they wanted to get the full
story from my parents.&nbsp; This story has now been published twice as
it has become a very well known ghost story for the area<br>
THE WATCHFUL GHOST This is a true story as allot of my friends and
family would tell you.Let me take you back to 1989 when I was in
primary school and living with my parents and my older brother and
sister. As long as I can remember my family seem to always have
paranormal activity going on in the house we are living in and seems to
follow us to the next house. Thank the lord this was to be the last
house, or so I thought. It all started when I was at school one day and
I was playing with the younger year school group and I saw (what looked
like) the end of a very long black cape go past the classroom window.
As far as I new I was the only one who saw this. Thinking nothing of it
I never mentioned it again. The strange thing was, after my experience
I saw the end of the cape a few more times but only at school. Then
this (so called) black cape I then saw again as I was walking down an
old railway track, now starting to get a bit scarred I then told my
mum. She said not to worry about it, but that if it was something, she
would keep and eye out. Anyway, a few weeks went past and I started to
forget about it until one night I was in my room. I had a little black
and white tv on a seat by my bedroom door. The tv had little knobs that
you had turn to get to each channel. I must of been sat infront of it
for about 5 minuets trying to find a channel, which was strange because
I had never had trouble finding a channel before. Then my brother came
and stood in the door way and started chatting to me. I wasn't really
looking at him just talking to him but at the same time trying to sort
out my tv. Then when I did look at him (as my brother describes) I when
as white as a sheet and had a terrified look on my face. What I was
looking at was a black figure. No face just covered from head to toe in
black. It was terrifying and just behind my brothers shoulder. I
screamed at the top of my longs and as you can imagine scared the shit
out of my brother. As I screamed this black figure went and it looked
like it went into my sisters bedroom (next to mine). My brother didn't
believe in ghosts until that night. I can't remember much more about
that night but I was only 9. Few weeks past and I was having a sleep
over at my house with two of my friends. My friend Amy and myself were
on my bed having a really good laugh and my friend Nicola was sat at
the bottom of my bed talking to us with her back to my open bedroom
door, when I saw the black figure again in the doorway looking right at
me. Even though it had no face I new it was looking at me. As I
screamed it disappeared again, as if screaming at it was scarring it in
some way or disappearing because I was scarred of it. Not much more was
said about it as not many people would have believed a 9 year old girl
being haunted by a black figure but talking to my mum about it seemed
to help. My mum suggested that it was trying to get my attention or
just looking out for me as it didn't seem to want to hurt me but I
really didn't like it either way as I dought many people would have.
After that a few more little things happened such as, One night when I
was sent to bed, the rest of my family were down stairs. I got into bed
and with my door open I went to sleep. I woke up to the feeling of the
end of my duvet being lifted up to reveal my feet. Being frozen with
fear I lay as I only could (frozen) and felling the same thing a few
more times. Even though this was the type of trick my brother would of
pulled I new that he couldn't of done this because even the slightest
of movement would of made the floor boards creek as the house dates
back to the 17th century when it was a public house. All I remember
after that was waking up the next morning feeling so glad that it was
morning. On my 16th birthday I had a friend staying over. That night
when I was in the bathroom I heard her talking to someone. I left the
bathroom and walked into my bedroom expecting to find someone else with
her but all I saw was her looking quiet shaken. When she calmed down
she said she saw a black figure walking out of the bathroom and across
the landing. As she thought it was me she started talking to me but
when I didn't walk into the bedroom she walked out onto the landing to
see where I was but I was still in the bathroom. After that night any
one of my friends who stayed the night always saw something when they
were left one there own. Who knows it may of been the black figure
checking up on them. When I turned 18 I was with a friend of mine in
there house and one of there neighbours walked in. As me and the
neighbour got talking he just asked me where I was from and I mentioned
my parents house. He then asked me if I had herd of the ghost that use
to haunt the house and seemed to look after the children that were
there before we moved in? being so shocked that it wasn't just me going
mad and that the ghost was real I said "no I havant"&nbsp; I then he
told me that before my house was a pub it was a monastery and that the
black figure that haunted the house was infact a monk...........well
writing that story has brought back some memories and believe me when I
say That isn't the only ghost story from my past and Im only 25<br>
This it the third stage of the trilogy. If you have already read my
other stories then you will know that ghosts seem to follow me and my
life if not that then I'm just extremely unlucky when it comes to the
paranormal.........<br>
When I was 19 and I had had my first child I had moved out of my mum
and dads and into a house of my own, in a very remote area living next
door to my sister Nadean and her little boy. Nadeans son and my little
girl were only 6 weeks and 6 days apart in birth. The two houses were
semi detached and were the only houses for about a mile. The houses
were down a little track. Just before the track, on the left hand side
was a derelict church that we don't know very much about, but very over
groan nonetheless.<br>
On the first night Monica (my daughter) and myself were unpacking or
should I say, I was unpacking and she was just dribbling all over the
boxes as she loved doing when my sitter and her son came over to see
how we were getting on. I made a cup of tea and then we both sat down
to have rest. <br>
It was around 7pm and the kids were playing quietly on the floor when
we herd banging coming from next door (my sisters house) as there was
no one next door we were pretty shaken by it. When It finally stopped
we all went over to check what had happened. Nothing had been moved and
it looked just like normal. This happened a few times but as it
happened quite often we just started to ignore it the best we could but
that wasn't the end of the weirdness.......<br>
The house we were living in had two bedrooms. On the landing the
bedroom doors were opersit each other with the bathroom in the middle
of the two rooms. For some reason Monicas room was always freezing even
with two radiators. Her bedroom was really creepy and when you walked
in, you always felt that you were never alone. These were not the only
things that made this house creepy.......<br>
whenever I entered the house it always seemed like I was walking into
something. you know, the feeling that you get when you walk into a room
and you know that they have been talking about you. The house never
felt like it belonged to me. I really didn't like it.<br>
I think I ended up living there no longer then 8 months before I had to move out of this really uneasy property.<br>
After we had left, my sister was still living there. Man moved into my
old house. He too thought the house was creepy and especially hated
Monicas old room. He used it for storage only and never went in there
after dark. When he was still leaving there he did a background check
on the house and found out that a farther and his two daughters had
lived there. The two girls died young in monicas bedroom and he had
died shortly after. All three of them were buried in the church grounds
over the road. When my sister found this out she moved her son and her
self out.<br>
About a year had past and almost everything had been forgotten apart
from one thing that my (now) brother in-law forgot to tell me.........<br>
Even though my sister and david (brother in-law) were not living
together they were still very much together. David worked away in
telford where he was from and would visit Nadean and there son on the
weekends. This weekend was no different or so they thought......<br>
<br>
David is a biker and as far as I know not very easily spooked. I know
he wasn't pulling my leg when he told me this story because he seemed a
little embarrass telling me.<br>
It was before I had moved in next door (thank god) when David and
Nadean had gone upto bed. Nadean has always slept like a log (as they
say) and was always impossible to wake up. David snored really loud but
wasn't a very deep sleeper. <br>
He told me that on this night he was woken up by the sound of
scratching on the bedroom window. Take note that this was upstairs and
there isn't anyway someone or something could of got its way up there.
Anyway as he woke up he walked over to the window. The scratching was
getting louder and louder. As he pulls the curtains back he saw this
thing covered with fur with big yellow eyes lunged at him with long
razor sharp claws, trying to come at him through the glass. Shitting
himself, he backs up and falls over the bed. by the time he looks up
the thing has gone. <br>
Now when I first herd this story I thought he might of been dreaming it
but as the years have gone by I have herd another 3 similar stories
like it. One was from Telford and the other 2 were from around my area
"West Wales" <br>
To this day David's story hasn't changed and I'd really like to know if
there is anyone out there who knows of anything similar to his story.
Please let me know by emailing me at vixen_vamp8@hotmail.com. Thankyou
for taking the time to read my story and if you have any questions
don't hesitate to ask.<br>

Dunworth Pool Haunting<br>
<br>
By:KarenHughes@comcast.net<br>
<br>
Im at 15 year old boy in Dearborn Michigan.&nbsp; Me and some of my
friends saw your website and saw that supposedly Jack Dunworth Pool was
haunted.&nbsp; This being only about 5 blocks from one of my friends
houses we decided after his parents went to bed we would sneak out to
check things out.&nbsp; We left the house about midnight and met up
with 5 others on the way.&nbsp; We got there at about 12:30 am and
anxiously stood around the gate waiting for anything to happen.&nbsp;
We waited but nothing seemed to be going on.&nbsp; After about an hour
of waiting around and talking we had completly forgotten why we were
there until we heard what sounded like wet footsteps on the cement
running by the other side of the pool.&nbsp; We stood silent but
nothing else happened after about an hour though things started to get
scary.&nbsp; We heard children giggling and the footsteps again. The
footsteps then ran directly at us and stopped right at the fence about
2 feet from where we were standing.&nbsp; Just seconds after that we
heard the diving board spring as if someone had jumped off.&nbsp; We
ran away from the fence then made our way back home.&nbsp; The next
night me and 2 other kids went back to take pictures but are yet to get
them developed.&nbsp; Jack Dunworth Pool truly is haunted i
beleive.&nbsp; You can contact me at gbpackers8969@yahoo.com if you
have any questions or anything else.&nbsp; Thanks<br>

Bessbrook<br>
<br>
By: chris@wastewatercontrols.com<br>
<br>
Throughout my life I have seen an experienced a few things that I can only describe as supernatural.<br>
Everything I am about to tell you actually happened and I will describe each experience as I remember them.<br>
The first thing I can remember happened whenever I was only a young boy growing up outside a village in <br>
Northern Ireland called Bessbrook. It was during the winter because we
had a heavy snowfall the previous night and I was outside <br>
Playing with my two brothers. After a while I went inside to warm up
because my hands were frozen. My mother told me to take off my boots <br>
So that I wouldn&#8217;t tramp snow all over the house. I sat down at the
table with a bowl of soup in front of me and it was then that I noticed
something out of the corner<br>
Of my eye in the hall leading from the kitchen to the living room. I
turned to see what it was and what I saw absolutely terrified me.<br>
I saw the figure of a woman walking down the hall towards the kitchen.
I just got up and ran out the door without putting on my boots and
jacket into the snow and refused to come back inside even though my
mother insisted that there was no woman in the house. Over the next
number of years nothing happened except what sound like somebody
walking around the house even when the rest of the household was in bed
or away. Everyone in the heard the noises but chose to ignore them.
Then one Saturday morning while I was still in bed I was shook awake
and told to get up and come down for breakfast. Whenever I opened my
eyes there was no one in the room so I assumed that they had already
gone down stairs. While I was getting dressed a voice was calling from
down stairs for me to hurry up. When I did get down to the kitchen
there was no one around, everyone else was still in bed. A few days
after my youngest brother claims he saw a young boy standing in my
parents bedroom who just stood there looking at him. Shortly after this
someone unknown attacked my brother in his bed leaving him with a black
eye. The next few years were quiet except for the noises, until one
morning I turned on the television and sat down watching it for a few
hours until it suddenly turned off. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why this
happened because there was no sign of a power failure or any sign of it
having shorted out. It was a complete mystery until I noticed that the
TV was not plugged into the mains to start with. I had sat and watched
for hours and it was not even plugged in. Nothing else that I know of
has happened in that house except for the noises, but I did tell you
that I lived outside a village. The best way to get to the village is
through a wooded area and this place is a very strange place. Around
the edge are a number of fields and in the middle of one of these
fields is a turnstile. This turnstile has no paths leading to or from
it, with no sign of and entrances, which may have been there not even
an old building it is just there. The thing about this turnstile is
that even on a windless day if you where to stand in the middle of this
turnstile you can hear the wind howling all around but don&#8217;t actually
feel it. About 100 yards away from the turnstile is a pool of water
which is fenced off and the legend surrounding this pool is that over
the years many people have drown in here even though it is not very
wide and has no current and the strange thing is that no bodies where
ever found even after it was pumped out. If you do venture to close
even in the summer the whole area is very cold and you get the urge to
jump in. <br>
Now this is the way from the housing estate that I live in to the
village on foot. On the way through the wood is an old houses called
jack&#8217;s house after the man who built it many years ago. This house has
had all the doors and windows blocked up years ago. One summers day a
friend and myself were walking through this wood and we where on the
path towards jack&#8217;s houses. Ahead of us the path was long and straight
with trees on either side. Now both of us seen this at the same time,
coming towards us was a horse and rider at a fast gallop. The path was
wide enough for us to keep walking and the horse to pass safely. The
two of walked about another few feet when the path and trees
disappeared and we where standing on the embankment above jack&#8217;s house
where all the lights where on and the doors opened. Remember earlier I
mentioned that this house was blocked up years ago.<br>
These are only the things I have seen in my life but I have heard other
stories by people I know. The shop at the bottom of the road is said to
be haunted by the ghosts of the seven British soldiers killed there in
the eighties whenever the original petrol station was blown up. I
mentioned earlier I&#8217;m from Northern Ireland. There is a high viaduct in
the area, which is used as a railway line. 18 people died constructing
it one for each arch and numerous others have committed suicide off it.
The Stories are that at times you can see these people and they all
look sad. There is also the blood on one wall in a friends house and no
matter how many times it is painted over the blood still comes through.<br>
All this is true and has happened within a square mile of where I live<br>

A Weird Black Figure<br>
<br>
By: Emmalouisejone@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
When I was about five years of age, I saw this black figure and in
actual fact, it looked quite like a bear.&nbsp; It all happened one
night when I was in bed.&nbsp; I heard this humming sound and I felt
very frightened!&nbsp; Suddenly this strange black bear like figure
started coming up out of the floor with a big bowl of flame at the top
of it's head!&nbsp; Obviously I was extremely scared so I crwled to my
moms side of the bed!&nbsp; I tried to wake my mum up but nomatter how
hard I tried she just wouldn't wake up, that made me so scared that I
began to scream.&nbsp; Suddenly the figure grabbed me and hung me
upside down and I just could not get away.&nbsp; in the end i managed
to get away but I had this strane flying feeling sort of like being
pulled toward the black figure but my body didn't move!&nbsp; In the
morning, I looked toward the floor where this black figure had came up
but no there wasn't a hole in the floor.&nbsp; I don't really know if

Little Random Things<br>
<br>

Hi. I've written to you before, but I dunno if my story got put up or
not. I previously wrote about a ghost I saw at Vicksburg, Louisiana on
a family trip, a little girl that I have seen around my house, and a
woman who doesn't like me being in the upstairs of my house. I
mentioned that little random things keep happening around the house.<br>
These little random things continue to happen, on a larger scale more
recently. Particularly when I'm home alone, I keep hearing a sliding
door in the house open and close, and footsteps moving across the
kitchen. My parents don't really believe me, but it freaks me out! It's
all I can do not to call them at work when this stuff happens.<br>
Just last week, I had a more interesting experience. I was out of
school sick for three days with a bug that's been going around the
entire area. It wasn't anything incredibly serious, but I slept for
most of the three days, and when I wasn't sleeping I was coughing. I
have asthma, and this made breathing incredibly difficult.<br>
I woke up in the middle of the night while I was sick one of these
days, because I heard my bedroom door open. I was lying on my side,
facing away from the door, and I was too tired to roll over and talk to
my mom--that's who I thought it was. I heard whoever it was take two
steps into my room, and then stop. I thought that this was weird,
because my mom would have come over to the bed to check on me. After
there had been silence for a while, I finally rolled over to see what
my mom was doing, and why she wasn't by my bed. But there was nobody
there, and my door was still closed. I had distinctly heard it open.<br>
The next day, while I was sleeping (again), I was awakened once more,
this time by footsteps. They stopped by the side of my bed, and I heard
rustling. I figured that my mom had stepped on all the papers and books
that I keep in piles next to my bed (I'm a messy person and I freak out
if I don't know where my books are). I thought that maybe she had
knocked over a couple stacks of books. I could feel a presence next to
the bed. But when I rolled over to look, once again, no one was there
and my books were in their nice little piles, not disturbed at all.<br>
I felt the presence a few more times, but nothing so drastic as hearing
doors open or footsteps happened again. I just felt this person near
me. It wasn't an angry preson either, like the woman in my upstairs who
doesn't like me. I could feel compassion and caring radiating from this
presence. Whoever it was, I know they really cared for me and were
concerned that I was sick.<br>
I now believe that the presence in my room was my biological mother (I
am adopted). She sadly passed away last March, in a household accident.
She and I didn't have the greatest relationship, but I did love her
very much, and I know she loved me too. I think she came to visit me
when I was sick, to watch over me and make sure that I was okay. I can
honestly say that I wouldn't be disappointed if she came back to see me
once in a while.<br>

The Lady<br>
<br>

In 1978 my parents purchased a relatively new house in Niceville,
Florida. The land the house had been built on had previously been a
swamp that was drained to make way for the housing subdivision. Nothing
bad had ever happened in the house. Yet, after living in the house a
short time, we all began to notice odd things. It started the night I
broke up with my fiance. My parents had gone out for the evening and I
was in my bedroom crying. Suddenly I realized I was not alone. I looked
up and saw a woman dressed in turn of the century clothing. She had a
look of extreme empathy on her face. I did a double take (never take
your eyes off of them, I have learned) and my visitor was gone. Several
weeks later as I was napping. my brother brought her engagement ring
into my room so that I could take it to work the next day and have it
sized. When I woke from my nap, I got the ring off the dresser and
noticed that it wasn't 'quite right'. I got out my loupe and discovered
that the ring had been squashed. I took the ring to my parents and
showed it to them. Dad examined the ring. As a scientist, he was a
little more observant than I was. He pointed out that the ring appeared
to have been squashed from right beside the head that held the
diamond...as if it had been sitting on the rear shank of the ring and
an incredible force put on it that literally broke the head from the
shank...without leaving a single scratch or gouge mark! That kind of
spooked me since I had been sleeping with the ring on the nightstand
next to my head and it had been fine prior to being placed by my bed! <br>
However, events would soon unfold that made us all realize that the
house was indeed haunted by the Lady...but she was a friendly ghost,
provided you were nice to 'her family'. After having moved to the
house, my mom was in a terrible car accident which almost killed her.
She was in the hospital for over 6 weeks and even after she got out,
she was in and out of the hospital repeatedly. By this time I was
married and out of the house but my middle sister's kids would stay
over while my sister worked nights. My niece slept in my old room which
seemed to soon become the epicenter for activity; perhaps because of
her preadolescent age. It started with her being awakened by the
feeling that someone was sitting on the bed. She turned on the light
and saw a depression in the bed as if someone were sitting there. As
she watched, the depression slowly lifted out as if the person sitting
there had stood up. She was too frightened to sleep in the room after
that so her brother slept there. He was awakened every night by the
sound of dresser drawers being pulled out and rattled. At first he
thought it was Granny, but then he turned the light on and there was no
one there. The final straw for my sister's kids came when they were
sleeping over one night. Mom had just been released from the hospital,
yet again, and was sitting up in the den. Dad had gone to bed, as had
the kids. Suddenly Dad was awakened by the sound of the smoke alarms
going off. He ran into the den and found Mom passed out. She had been
in incredible pain since her accident and had begun stashing pills for
a 'grand escape'. That night she had gotten depressed and taken all the
pills that she had been hoarding. There was no evidence of smoke in the
house....not even Mom's usual cigarette smoke. By this time the smoke
alarms had stopped blaring their alarms, but Dad stood there, surveying
the scene and thinking about how much pain Mom was in and how horrible
her life had been since the accident...and questioning whether it was
even right for him to decide that Mom was not entitled to escape the
horror her life had become. Then the smoke alarms went off again. Dad
figured somebody was trying to tell him something and he called 911.
The next day after we had all been to the hospital to make sure that
Mom was going to be OK, we all gathered at my parent's house. I asked
Dad why he had called the paramedics....I felt like the doctors who had
saved Mom's life after the accident had not taken into consideration
the lack of quality of life she would have, and I felt like Mom was
entitled to a reprieve from the constant torment she was in. Dad looked
at me kind of funny and explained about the smoke detectors. Then he
said that when he had gotten home later that night, he hac torn each of
the smoke alarms apart and there was nothing wrong with any of them,
nor was there any reason they should have gone off.<br>
Once Dad told us this, we all sat there with odd looks on our faces and
started talking about the Lady. By this time I had seen her twice. My
oldest sister had seen her once. And my skeptical scientist dad even
admitted to having seen her. We began comparing notes and found us
finishing each other's stories and descriptions. We had all seen the
same lady dressed in the same clothing, and none of us had mentioned it
to the others for fear of being ridiculed!<br>
As time went by the Lady continued to watch over 'her family'. After my
dad's death in 1998, my then husband and I were in the den of the house
after we had cleared out the possessions and cleaned the house up. I
had left a book on the counter and Ex went back to get it. Our marriage
was on the rocks and he was becoming increasingly abusive to me.
Something that the Lady didn't seem to care for. He had always laughed
at our family ghost stories up till that day, but when he went back in
the house to get my book, he came out of the house shaking and white.
He had felt a cold hand brush across his face. Then when he didn't
leave fast enough, he felt the same cold hand pushing him in the back,
propelling him to the door. The Lady was trying to tell him that she
did not appreciate the way he was treating one of her 'kids'....nor was
he welcome in her home. After that, the lady began dropping by my
house. I always knew she was around because the stove timer would go
off for no reason and the dresser drawers would rattle. After I left
the abusive hubby and moved to the Midwest, the Lady would come by and
visit me there from time to time...always setting off the timer on the
stove, rattling drawers, playing tricks with the blinds...anything she
could do to let me know she was keeping her eye out for me.<br>
I realize that it is unusual for ghosts to leave their primary
residence and to actually follow people from home to home, but I talked
to some friends who all felt like the Lady was probably a female
ancestor who had died in childbirth so she felt responsible for looking
out for her family. After going through the family archives, we found a
photo of my great grandmother. She had died of appendicitis when she
was pregnant. The baby also died. The woman in the photo looked like
the Lady!<br>
My sister is now living in the house. When she first moved in, she put
some pots in the cabinet, then went to the bathroom for a minute. When
she came back out, the pots were sitting on the floor! Earrings and
rings that had been lost for years, some in different houses that we
had lived in, suddenly appeared on cabinets or in my sister's jewelry
box. Unseen hands frequently pull back the curtains to look outside and
my sister's dog loves to romp and play with an unseen visitor. I could
go on and on about all the poltergeist activity...some that seemed to
be coming from the Lady, others that seemed to be coming from my
deceased Dad. From fax machines that go off when they aren't plugged
in, my deceased Dad's voice calling me to wake up when the gas
fireplace developed a leak, even luggage being set on its end, weird
stuff just follows my sisters and I around. Just two nights ago while
lying in bed I was awakened by the bed shaking. I sat up and looked
around and found my husband sound asleep and the door securely closed
against kitty visitors. I laid back down and snuggled up to my hubby
thinking he had just had a clonic jerk that shook the bed, when it
suddenly hit again. The whole bed kind of went 'whump' as if a 20 lbs
weight had been dropped on it. This time I knew there were no cats in
the room and, since I had been snuggled up to my hubby, I knew he had
not jerked in his sleep. It's nice having your own guardian spirit to
watch over you...but it can really interfere with your sleeping!<br>
I know some people think we are all nuts or engaging in what shrinks
call 'magical thinking'...but every time I start to question my own
sanity, I get another visit. It should be interesting when we move to
my Dad's hometown this Spring. I imagine the visits will become a
regular thing.<br>
