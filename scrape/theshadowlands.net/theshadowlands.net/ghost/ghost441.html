<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">This story is completely true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can give me a lie detector test and I
would pass!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My siblings all remember
this house and the many things that happened there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost was a woman and if I had space and
time I would tell you how I know this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, I am the daughter of Mexican migrant farm workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We worked in fields all summer long,
migrating from place to place in search of work.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We stayed in one room cabins, old beat up
trailers, whatever the landowners had for us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One summer, we were all astonished when we were loaned a beautiful home,
with a bay window and a view of the <st1:place w:st="on">Hudson River</st1:place>,
to live in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was located in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Bingen</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Washington</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could tell you many stories about that
house, but this is one of the wierdest.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was 9 years old, everyone else went to work, and I was left behind to
care for my youngest sister, about 5 then, and my baby brother, 3 yrs.
old.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One day, I ran them a bath, put
them in the bathtub and went to look at the view out the bay window in the
living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bay window had a narrow
shelf just below the window sill and on there sat three large ornate bottles of
colored water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One red, one green, and
one blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I picked up the green one and
shook it, watching the sediment float to the bottom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a good grip on the bottle because, as I
said, I was shaking it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, I felt
this creepy feeling come over me like a huge wave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My heart began pounding and I felt like I
could hardly breathe. It gives me the creeps even now to think of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Someone came up behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My hair was in a ponytail and someone blew
softly at the base of my neck, causing a sort of a prickly sensation that ran
all the way from my neck to the top of my head - like electricity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the bottle slipped right out of my hands
and crashed to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I said, I
had a good grip on it but it slipped and fell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the bottle hit the floor, my little sister and brother started
singing this little song in the bathtub.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I went to see, and there they were, sitting face to face making sawing
motions on their little necks singing "cotchee..cotchee..
cotchee.....<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(then rubbing mock tears
from their eyes) .. boo hoo" ... repeating the sawing motion and the mock
tears, singing the song, over and over.. "cotchee cotchee cotchee... boo
hoo."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Spanish word for knife
is "cuchillo."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I feel kind of silly writing this, since I haven't talked
much about it since it happened. I'm seventeen now and still can't come up with
any explanation other than spirits. I have always been a believer, and hoped to
one day have my own encounter with ghosts. I never thought it would be as
terrifying as it was. Eight years ago (Summer of 2000), my dad's family was
having a reunion, and we all decided we would stay at <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Oak</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Beach</st1:PlaceType>
in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Carolina</st1:place></st1:State>.
(I'm not sure if that is the exact name, I know it was something with
"Oak" in it.) The week we were there, the weather was very fickle. It
rained most days and the sun was only out three or four times. Most of our time
was spent indoors. My parents, sister, and grandparents shared one condo. My
dad's brother and sister and her family shared another and his step siblings
were in the third with their children. One night, while it was storming, my
cousin Josh and I went to his condo to play video games and watch TV (Everyone
else was in our condo, playing cards and drinking.) We played "Dino
Crisis" and an X-men game and decided to watch cartoons after about an
hour. We spent another couple of hours just goofing off, when the storm really
started to pick up. We were sitting on the couch, talking and laughing when we
heard a creak on the balcony outside. Neither of us is scared easily now and we
weren't then either. I looked out of the sliding doors, but everything was
pitch black. We went back to our conversation, and had no more interruptions
for a couple of minutes. When a bolt of lightning lit up the beach, we saw a
man standing on the balcony, dressed in a trench coat. He seemed to be looking
out at the sea. It all happened so suddenly, we didn't believe what we saw. No
matter how skeptical we were, we weren't about to go and check like I had with
the noise. After a couple of minutes, we noticed the door was fogging up. Not
the entire thing, just a little patch about six feet off of the floor. We were
very spooked now. During the next bolt of lightning, we both saw the man,
standing against the door, looking in on us. He screamed and I screamed and we
jumped over the couch, headed for the door. We yanked it open, and as we did,
we heard the sound of glass breaking. We didn't look back, just ran across the
parking lot to the other condo. When we came in, we were soaked and out of
breath. Our parents started to freak, asking us what was wrong. When I told
them, they laughed and brushed it off. We kept begging them to call someone but
they refused. After about a minute, they got fed up with it. They grabbed us
and their umbrellas and dragged us over there. When we went in, the place was
just as we left it. The door was intact and no one was on the balcony. Not even
a foot print. I know I didn't imagine it. I believe that the spirit was drawn
to me for some reason. My cousin has had no other experiences that he has told
me about and I have had quite a few, but none as intense as the first. Anyone
that has had a similar experience, know that you are not alone. Finding this
site has opened my eyes to the world of ghosts and those that have been
affected by them. Thanks.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">This relates to a home in <st1:City w:st="on">Georgetown</st1:City>,
<st1:State w:st="on">Delaware</st1:State> &#8211; a private residence on the grounds
of the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Delaware Agriculture</st1:PlaceName> and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Research</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
on Route 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother often experienced
lights going on and off in the house by herself and several times felt someone
touch her only to turn around and find there was no one there.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Several years after we moved into the house, I was headed up
the stairs and heard someone jumping on the bed in one of the bedrooms. I
quickly ran down the stairs to tell on my sister and surprisingly, my mother
reacted by whisking me out to the car and off to my grandparents where we
stayed until my father returned home. Why? No one else was in the house. My
sister was at a friend&#8217;s for the day.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Another time, my grandparents were over for a visit and I
asked if I could go upstairs into my bedroom and get my new record player so I
could show it off. I reached up and got the record player out of my closet and
as I walked across the room, I walked through a spot that was freezing cold. I
also felt as if something was moving through me. I dropped the record player
and ran downstairs in tears.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">As we got older, the activity pretty much stopped, but it
was very active for the first five or so years we lived in the house. My mother
once met another town resident who told her they knew of a young boy who had
died of an illness in the house. She thought that might&#8217;ve been the presence we
experienced.</font></p>

<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cemetery</st1:PlaceType> on the outskirts of Salk
Lick, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Kentucky</st1:State></st1:place>,
to investigate the "glowing" spotted by man locals in that area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when we got there (appx. 9:30</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">PM) we began to hear sounds originating from both the
cemetery and the wooded areas surrounding it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sounds were of footsteps and laughter as well as one sound that
could only be described as a mumbled groan, like someone trying to speak but
couldn't.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">At approximately 10:00 PM we began to see a strange mist
that seemed to follow the fence around the cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few moments later we saw what looked like a
glow in the outline of a man (about average build, possibly 6' tall) standing
in the center of four trees that come together in the shape of a square.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">As we left, the mist seemed to follow us out for the better
part of two miles before it faded away.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Hello my name is Amanda and I have lived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Sapulpa</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Oklahoma</st1:State></st1:place>
my whole life and was looking at your web site. I noticed you have not listed
any haunted places in <st1:City w:st="on">Sapulpa</st1:City> but I KNOW there
are at least three places you should have listed in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sapulpa</st1:place></st1:City>. I personally KNOW for a fact that
the SOUTH HEIGHTS CEMETARY and GREEN HILLS CEMETARY in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sapulpa</st1:place></st1:City> are haunted. I have visited these two
cemeteries most of my life and have seen four different ghostly figures in
them. My grand parents once own the house I grew up in and my cousins have also
seen them. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">South</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Heights</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> has three of them. The first one
is an elderly man who walks around the cemetery grounds in a long gray coat and
knee high boots and is some times seen with a hat and cane. He has a long gray
beard and is friendly. He is the old grounds keeper. The second and third are
always seen in or around the "tower". One is a male figure in old
western style clothes and the other is a woman in a an old style western dress.
The man has been seen hanging from the tower ceiling (which has since rotted
away) and the woman has been seen inside the tower and outside the tower always
crying. I have yet to find any historical proof however that the tower was ever
used as a hanging site. In the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Green</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hills</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Cemetery</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
there is a man in black. He has been seen by many people including some of our
local police officers. One of which has refused to ever go back to that
cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They recalled going on an
alarm call at the moseleum. When they arrived they saw the "man in
black" run into the building. The audible alarm was sounding loudly on the
moseleum so they attempted to open the door to it but it was locked. All the
doors to it in fact were locked and there are no windows to break or open. The
officers noted that there were footprints in the dew on the grass that led to
the doors as well that did not belong to them. They called for a key holder to
come out to the building so that they could check the inside of the building.
The key holder showed up and the did a search of the building finding no one
inside and nothing disturbed. But the eery part about everything really came
when they checked the outside of the building. They checked the wiring to the
alarm to see if they could turn the alarm off with out going through the
company and found that the wires to the alarm had been cut so they called the
alarm company labeled on the wiring housing to see if they could turn it off.
The alarm company told them that the alarm had been deactivated many years ago
and should not be on at all! Then like some one had flipped a switch the alarm
went off on it's own! The other place I know to be haunted is the Sapulpa
Police Department. It is rumored that it is built on a old indian burial
ground. I have personally witnessed type writers writing with no one around
them and have heard strange sounds coming from the cells when they are empty
late at night. These are just a few places that you may want to look into for
your web site.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Many other incedents happend during the time that my family

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">1. When driving by in about 1994 on our way to a Halloween
party with my mother and two friends we saw men in brown hooded robes walking
down the aisles with candles lit. We did not stop.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">2. A group of 9 of us entered the Chapel. We were all 16 to
17 years old, friends of our lived at the end of the estate. We entered in
through an unlocked back door. Went in, searched downstairs, nothing but water
in the fridge. Noone had the guts to checkout the bell tower.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">As we got outside one of the guys with us said it was stupid
and acted like he was going to throw a rock, just then the bell rang 3 times.
We all ran off and one guys watch had fallen off. When he was fixing it after
we had all ran about half a mile, he said "ummmm guys, this is freak....
my watch says 9:37. Why did the bell ring twice at like 9:32"</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">We were curious if the people living on the estate had seen
us and had some sore of automatic bell ringer or what... true story</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">My Aunr Terry, from my fathers side, lived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Oklahoma</st1:State></st1:place>. When I was
about 16, she came here to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Memphis</st1:place></st1:City>,
and she told me about a house that she lived in. She said when her husband and
kids moved in, there was a barn out back, and she said when she walked in
there, there was an upside pentacle, on the barn floor. After she saw that, she
never went back out there. One night when everyone went to bed, my Aunt Terry
heard the dogs barking in the kitchen. She went into the kitchen, and watched
her dog bark at a corner in the room. The next night she went to bed the tv in
the living room came on by itself, and she said it did it every night. So one
night she decided to unplugg the tv, and she went to bed as normal, and the tv
still came on. Then one day, after everyone ate dinner, they were all sitting
in the living room, my aunt looked out the window, and saw a pair of red eyes.
Her husband saw them to, and it really freaked them out. On another night, my
aunt and uncle, and the kids were leaving to go see a movie, and on the porch
stood a beast, with read eyes, and half his body was human, but the rest of him
was like an animal. She desicribed his hands and feet as hoofs. Well, after
they got home that night, my aunt and uncle made the kids sleep with them, and
Katherin, started to get really sick. When my aunt and uncle tried to take her
to the hospital, the car wouldn't start, so they had to push the car all the
way down the street, and it started right up. The doctors couldn't find out
what was wrong with Katherin. My aunt and uncle decided to move. And every
morning the car wouldnt start when my aunt had to go to work, untill my uncle
pushed it down the street. After my aunt and uncle found a new place to live
when they got every thing the owned out of the house, Katherin got better
immediatly, and the car never gave them a problem, and the tv never came on by
itself again.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I was hoping to contribute this true story, as experienced

this hotel, which we now call The Haunted Hampton.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband doesn&#8217;t believe in ghosts or

contribute this story . . . </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The (Haunted) Hampton Inn, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Elkton</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Maryland</st1:State></st1:place></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The Hampton Inn on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Warner
  Road</st1:address></st1:Street> (off Rte 279) has a haunted room, which is
#417. My husband stayed in this room while on a business trip in March 2008. He
frequently stays at this hotel while in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>,
but never had an experience like this until he stayed in Room 417. This was his
room for three nights, and for the first two nights he was very restless and didn't
sleep well (this is not normal for him). On the third restless night he
realized that he was hearing noises inside the room (not from adjoining rooms).
These noises were hangers moving around in the closet, the refrigerator door
opening, noises from the bathroom and the sound of a glass being set on the
nightstand next to the bed. The final thing that really spooked him was that
something grabbed his side as he lay on the bed trying to ignore the sounds and
fall asleep. He was not imagining any of this! He could still feel the
sensation on his side after jumping out of bed. He looked around the room and
checked the deadbolt lock on the door and all was secure. He considered packing
up and checking out--but it was 3:00 a.m.! He eventually fell asleep and
checked out the next morning. He has since stayed at the hotel, and was offered
the same room upon check-in but he refused it. The hotel clerk wanted to know
why, but he didn't want to sound foolish and wouldn't elaborate on his
experience. For the record, he didn't believe in ghosts or spirits until this
happened! We believe that someone must have died in this room (heart attack or
something?) and their spirit is trapped there. We dare anyone to stay in this
room! It is creepy!</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Last year, I was living in an apartment on the far northwest
side of town, in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Chicago</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">IL</st1:State></st1:place>, and had one experience in an apartment
that for the most part was pretty quiet but for this experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had lived in a frighteningly active apartment
on the far northeast side before this occurence, so this didn't totally freak
me out, but....</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I was sitting in my living room, on the couch reading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sun was reflecting through the blinds,
which I had halfway closed, and the TV, which was directly in front of me and
perhaps 8 to 10 feet away, was off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
sat reading for quite some time, and at one point looked up and into my
reflection on the TV screen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sitting a
few inches from me was a woman, with a pageboy hairdo, perhaps in her early
40's, with glasses on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see her
curves as she sat, so there was no mistake she was a woman!</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I turned instantly to my left side, irrationally expecting
to see someone sitting next to me in my locked down apartment, where I knew no
one but myself had been the entire day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No one was there, of course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked back into the TV reflection again and she was no longer there.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">May I point out there was absolutely nothing in that
apartment that could have made such a reflection, I was on the 2nd story so
there was nothing inside that could have reflected that way, no nearby trees,
etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a bona fide experience.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I used to be sitting on the toliet and peeing and it used to
make me very very uncomfortable to leave the door open when I did - I felt that
someone was watching me and it was intense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One day I had to go and said the heck with it, what was wrong with me in
needing to close the door when no one was there and there was absolutely no way
for me to be seen from any window or door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So I'm sitting there peeing and at the threshhold of the door I saw an
orb, a white orb, small, no more than 4 inches in diameter, for maybe 4 or 5
seconds before it left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am told when
an orb stays close to the floor it is usually an animal, but my feelings of
being watched were so intense, and if the feeling was coming from the presence
of this orb I don't think it was any kind of an animal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never felt scared, by the way, just felt
highly uncomfortable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always
wondered if it was the lady or some other human that had a tie to that
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once or twice out of exasperation
I yelled "Leave me alone, in the name of Jesus Christ!", to try and
make it stop, but it never did.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">It was a highly Polish neighborhood, and had been for years,
so I have a feeling it was some old Polish lady that couldn't leave her
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived there for a year and
am now gone.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Me my boyfriend and our roommate went last night to go find
the cemetary, well i havnt been there since i was about 10 and im 21 now...my
boyfriend hasnt been there in like 7 yrs...and our roommate has never
been..well we started down the road and it is very lit up now by many other
buildings surrounding the road so its not scary anymore cause its not pitch
black...and well THEY MOVED THE CEMETARY!!!! The old site of the cemetary is
now a trucker parking lot that is very lit up by many many lights. And the new
spot for the cemetary is very taking care of, which makes it not scary anymore
AT ALL! They moved it about 4 or 5 yrs ago. The grounds keeper for the trucker
parking lot said they moved it because to many ppl were able to get in the
cemetary and mess with all the headstones and caskets. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The stories about the lady roaming the street i wouldnt know
if that still happens or not or the man walking his dog...but the cemetary its
self is not scary or haunted feeling anymore.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">When i went when i was little it was so creepy and i was
scared out of my mind, i would always tell stories about it to my friends..but
now its pretty pointless to keep it on your website cause its not haunted
anymore being they moved everything to a new location its a beautifuly kept
cemetary with tours during the daytime, a muesem and a chapel!</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I thought i would write to you and let you know so you could
update your page about this.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Riverside-Riverside Cemetary</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">we went last night also to this site and well they have many
lights here now too...and the most scary area of the OLD headstones that are
huge is now gated with iron finces where no one can enter, they have done alot
to this cemetary to change its apperance from being really old and unlept to
making it really nice and peaceful. we went and werent scared at all its hard
to be scared with lights surronding you.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I had a personal experience at this Bed and Breakfast, and
it was so exciting!</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">A friend of mine and I were staying in this B &amp; B (The
Henderson House) while we visited her daughter at nearby <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Ouachita</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Baptist</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, where she is
a cheerleader.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed in the
downstairs guest bedroom by the dining room.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">When we arrived, they were setting up for a big sit down
dinner and reception with round tables covered in white table cloths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a big affair that went on while we
were at a football game.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we arrived
back at the B&amp;B later that night, it was late and the staff was cleaning up
and putting up the tables.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
apologized for making so much noise and said they&#8217;d be finishing up for the
next hour or so, washing the tablecloths and putting them away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were exhausted, so we each took a shower
and my friend crawled into the beautiful mahogany bed, and I pulled out the
sleeper sofa and settled in and watched TV for a little while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally it quieted down somewhat out in the
parlor, so we turned off the lights and immediately fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up some time earlier as three women in
gowns brushed by my bed, carrying things.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We had gotten quite friendly with the inn keeper and her staff earlier,
so I really didn&#8217;t think that much about it, and wondered why they had to put
things away in our room before morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The next morning, I asked my friend what the women were
doing in our room the night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
said &#8220;what women?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one came in here,&#8221;
and she motioned toward the door where the deadbolt was still locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went out to the dining room for breakfast
a little before I did, and as I was walking out into the hall, she walked up to
me and said, &#8220;Come here, the owner has something to tell you&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I walked into the kitchen, the owner
looked up and said, &#8220;So?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You saw them,
huh?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her I saw three women in
gowns, and she said, &#8220;they are dressed in wedding and bridesmaids
dresses&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then walked me into the
parlor and opened the big old photo album, and turned to the page that showed a
wedding party lined up on the staircase &#8211; it was them!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are seen from time to time, getting
ready for a ceremony, and the bedroom where we stayed was once a porch, that
leads around to the front of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Because it is a Baptist college, they don&#8217;t promote these
ghost stories, as the college frowns on it, but she said many people see
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also a ghost of a Captain
(army, or sea, I didn&#8217;t quite get), but he haunts an upstairs room with a big
bay window, and is seen often too.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">It was not a frightening thing, I loved it, in fact, and
hope to go back again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were not
&#8220;see thru&#8221; people, and had I reached out, I could have touched their
dresses&#8230;&#8230;..maybe.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">During the 1970s I lived in a house<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Yuma</st1:City></st1:place>,
AZ. Myself, my husband and four children lived in that house. It formerly
belong to the Sheriff of Yuma County. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Occasionally we would see an apparition of a lady dressed in
a long white gown going from room to room as you looked down the hall from the
living room. Occasionally she had a cat with her that followed her.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I have had friends and relatives in that saw the same thing.
My own cats would bristle up and hiss as this lady and her cat would cross the
hall from room to room.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I did a little investigating and found out that the entire
subdivision where we lived had been built over a burial ground that was part of
the wagon trains going through <st1:City w:st="on">Yuma</st1:City> and across
the Colorado River to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>.
</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">When we sold the house in 1980 we did not tell the new owner
what we saw. He is an attorney in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Yuma</st1:place></st1:City>.
He came to us a few months later and asked about the lady. He and his wife saw
it too. The apparition was not bad and you never got a bad feeling from it, but
too many people saw it to be our imagination.</font></p>

for my family members I was taking care of my grand parents then my father.
Well one day I was cooking in the kitchen my father was coming into on his
wheel chair. Well when he was coming in the room I turned and saw a small blond
dog. It looked like a Benji dog it ran right in front of him . It then ran into
my bedroom wall. I asked my father if he saw it he said what<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said the dog he said yes I asked him to
tell me what it looked like he told me blond small dog. . That was all I seen
of it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then later on I had my brother
move in with me he was also helping me to take care of grandfather and father.
well there was no other room for him to stay in . So he was staying in
basement. One day he told me he saw a older woman rocking in a rocking chair.

read every story posted on Shadowlands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I like all of the others want to first just take the time to say thank
you for having such a site for people to come to.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the year 2000 my husband and I moved to <st1:City w:st="on">LaGrange</st1:City>,
<st1:State w:st="on">GA.</st1:State> to a fairly new apartment on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Old</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Airport</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His job had transferred him from
NH and he was to be on a five day shift..five on and five off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That meant he would not be home every other
week as he was a truck driver for a major store chain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway..after being there a month or so we
decided that it was a great little town to settle down in and began looking for
a house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During this time we had no
incidents at the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
another two months of searching we finally found the house we wanted and put in
a contract on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a three bedroom
ranch with a small in ground pool located in a rural part of LaGrange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When our offer was accepted we were ecstatic.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">This is when my four year old son began falling out of bed
at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something he had neither done
before or after living at this apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually this lead to him waking up in the middle of the night and I
would have to go in and comfort him, which was usually fairly easy to do and
he'd go back to sleep only to wake up again later in the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I put them to bed, I would sit in the
hallway between both of their doors (daughters bedroom was at the end of the
hall which was about 10 feet long but their doors were close together).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would have all the lights off except the
hallway and once they were asleep I'd then go and get on the PC in the dining
room adjacent to their hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
hallway had a bathroom at the opposite end of the bedrooms and a laundry closet
where my washing machine etc. were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night my son insisted I lay with him in the bed so i laid down behind him
closest to his closet with him closest to the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My eyes were closed and we were both resting
quietly when suddenly he half sat up in bed and said "Who is
that?!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally I asked what do
you mean?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said a woman in a long
skirt just walked by his bedroom door headed to his sisters room.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of course this is the week my husbands gone
so I'm alone in the apartment thinking someone must have broken into our second
floor apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I got up and looked.
My daughter(9 years old)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thankfully was
soundly asleep so I checked her room, closet and under her bed to make sure no
one was in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I questioned my son
again and he said no one passed back by his door and there is no exit from my
daughters room, just right by my sons room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I brought both kids to sleep in my bed on the other side of the apartment
that night.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Another night I sat in the hall again until they were both
asleep, now keep in mind ALL lights are off except the hall, which includes
their big walk in closets.. no lights on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they were both sleeping I got up and used their bathroom at the end
of their hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in their I heard
what sounded like a toy hitting the wall in my sons closet which shared a wall
with the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking that he woke
up and started playing (which was not like him by the way)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went in his room to find him sleeping
cozily but the closet door half way open and the light inside open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Okay so now I'm freaked out because I KNOW
that door was closed and the light was off<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and yes his beds right next to that closet so yeah, I took them into my
room again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Again on another night my son wakes up again but this time
my husbands home and we're all asleep in our own beds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can hear my son crying so I go in to
comfort him but he's not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my
husband and i can't find him but he's still crying...sobbing a terrified cry
actually.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in a minute or two we find him
hiding under the sink in the bathroom at the end of his hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he told us the mean lady won't let him pass.
He had tried to come in our room but she stood in front of him.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>again he described her exactly the
same...long skirt, hair up behind her head and she makes faces at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I know for a fact i'm dealing with a
ghostie here but husband thinks i'm just going nuts and putting stories in the
kids head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter meanwhile never
notices any of this and is not disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">While on the computer one night, late around 2 a.m. I hear
three distinct loud knocks under my feet, one on the left in the small kitchen,
one directly below my feet and one to my right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sounded like someone down stairs used a broom to knock on the ceiling in
extremely rapid succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sincerely
doubt that anyone could move as quickly in the downstairs apartment and get by
the furniture they undoubtedly had there, just as i had mine arranged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know for a fact the lady and her kids were
in bed by ten at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">So the bank has decided that they will give us a loan on any
house in LaGrange except that one because it's rural or some other bs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we try another place and another...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night i'm sleeping and have a more vivid
than any other dream i've ever had kind of dream/nightmare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In it we live in the house and i'm looking
for my son only to find him floating face down in the pool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i wake up crying and made up my mind that
there's no way i'm ever moving into that house so now i must convince hubby who
thinks i'm nuts anyway and is determined to get that house.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Well having bought a puppy when we started looking for a
house, this collie is now almost full grown size but he still has accidents so
we keep him penned in the kitchen with a large baby gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we go out this doggie somehow gets
passed the gate by pushing a corner or whatever and is running round our
apartment soo one night we're going out to dinner and hubby and I lock up
poochie and set two high backed dining chairs against the gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Keep in mind our apartment is carpet, thick
and plush everywhere except the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we return, puppy is looking at me from my kids hallway and the gate
is still exactly as we left it, and the chairs are too!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not one thing had moved but somehow according
to loving hubby i'm supposed to believe the dog vaulted over the chair backs
and somehow landed without killing himself or breaking my dining room table
which was a mere foot or two from the chairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yeah, okay.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">My downstairs neighbors kids told me their mom was upset
because i let my kids run around my apartment banging at all hours of the
night...mostly after ten pm and she can't believe i let kids stay up so late,
she has to get up early..yadda yadda yadda... except my kids are in bed every
night at 9:00 and asleep no later than 9:30ish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I see a shape leaning out of the kitchen door watching me as
i watch tv and tell it, come sit by me and leave my son alone...it didn't sit
with me but it didn't bother my son that night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i never noticed my dog noticing anything... the only cold spot in the
house was the kids hallway, and not always..just mostly..hubby slept in sons
room one day(in the afternoon) and even though we had central air complained
that he sweat like a hog and had the worse nightmares ever but the place still
isn't haunted and yes he steadfastly refused to ever sleep in there again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i saw blinds move on their own...doorknobs
that rattled when i was alone in the place and no..it wasn't a teeny shake
caused by some truck rumbling by, which there was some 50 to 100 feet between
the side of our apartment and the road, this was a defined and voracious
shaking...a definitive HELLO i'm trying to open the doooor!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no one was in the apartment but me an i
wasn't touching it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told the ghost to
have fun cause i was going out to eat.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Finally my husband tired of trying to get a loan for that
house and mysteriously everything stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No more rattling of this or that, no shadows, but by now it is also true
that the four of us were sleeping in my water bed in the one room that never
seemed affected by the haunting.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But i
noticed everything in the apartment changed and felt cozy again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But by then I'd also decided that tornado's,
large cockroachy looking bugs and the ghost belt were too much for me and we
packed up and came back north.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Interestingly enough when we returned home to my parents house (which we
later bought) which has never ever felt anything but perfect there were three
knocks on the bottom half of my bedroom door one afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was alone in the house...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately i felt that was the spirit or
something telling us we made the right choice by not getting that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father believed that it was his mother who
lived and died(1950's) in NC who knew something bad would happen to my son if
we bought that house, especially since it all seemed to stop when we stopped
trying to get financing for it and gave up on the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son has never been affected by any other
ghostie type stuff since then and he's never fell out of bed again either!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Feel free to email me if you choose.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">There are variety of things that happen at the church each
night. around 5:00pm a strange presence can be felt in the largest chapel in
the church. This wing during this is time should be pretty much unpopulated.
There is even more though. around 7:00pm- 9:30pm about(I'm estimating) things
start to get a lot stranger, you can hear footsteps, footscuffing, and sometimes
knocks. One thing you might be able to do is comune with the spirits in a form
of knocks,me and my partener were able to manage this. 1 knock for yes two for
no and we actually got answers to some very simple questions. there are at
least three spirits that haunt the chapel, I detected the presence of what
seemed like a male. When we exited there was a knock on the behind us with no
one behind it. It would be impossible at this time for anyone to have done it
seeing as the only other people in the church were my group of missionaries and
they were on the other side of the church at the time. During the nights people
also reported seeing strange figures "peering" in while the where
sleeping. I other hand heard strange things, it sounded like a little girl and
mother or older woman laughing. One of the questions I asked was if there was a
older lady and a little girl and I got a yes in the form of a knock. one
missonary while I was speaking with him reported that he somthing in the
window. I had to keep asking for him to tell me, it was apparently what I
suspected a older woman and a little girl. There was also something odd about
this place, its the fact that there are strange breaks and marks on the glass
and one I could only identify as a bullet hole. There were also footsteps
coming down near the room I was sleeping in. I had a leader check it out and
see who was up roaming around that time of night, there was no one found. The
leader along with all the other missionaries kept trying to deny the fact that strange
events were going on, they kept saying it was probably just their imagination.
But when I went on my own untrained hunt with a friend we quickly found that
wasn't true. I have not idea about the stories of the spirits but I do know
that they are there. Another odd thing is that these spirits like visitors,
they knock on door for you to come back and follow you around in the night, I
even asked if they would like us to stay and the answer was yes(in knock form).
These knocks were not simple creeks in the building, a human being would have
had to make the sounds I was hearing and some of the sounds were coming from
directly in front of me, meaning that there is a presence.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I have a story of a haunting that happened many years ago.
My husband and I live in Balt. MD. We lived at a house taking care of an
elderly lady Mrs. Phillips. She was 92. He husband had passed many years
before. Well her son had asked my husband to take a look at a safe that was in
the basement of the house. It belonged to Mr. Phillips and he had past away
with the combination. This safe was very very heavy and about 2 ft high and 2
ft wide. We had lived there for about a month or so. I worked across the street
at a local convince store and would get off at 11 pm. A few times when I would
get off work with Gloria. We would see a shadow in the upstairs window watching
me as I crossed the street. When I would get to the side walk of the house the
shadow would be gone. The first time We saw it I thought it was my husband
watching for me to get home. But when I got home that night he was not home.
Mrs. Phillips was sound asleep down stairs where she lived. She could not climb
stairs so I knew it was not her. I was quite puzzled and began to question myself.
As time went on I talked with Gloria about the shadow and she said she had seen
it watch me as well. This was strange and I wondered if it could be a
ghost...but I would just dismiss it as no way. </font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">of the bed with the reflection side up all my nick side up
or if had slid off all the nick Then the day came that my husband had time to
look at the safe. He must have worked on it for 2 hours or more but could not
get it opened. So he gave up for the day. That night while we were sleeping at
about 3 in the morning we heard a loud crash in the bedroom. I jumped up and
turned on the light. My long dresser with mirror at the foot of our bed was
missing the mirror....It was sitting on the floor in fronnack and things were
still on the dresser in place. With the exception of the small TV which was on
the corner of the dresser was across the room in the closet with the extension
cord still attached and plugged in. If The mirror had fallen off it would have
been non-reflectionnacks would have crashed to the floor as well. Not to
mention how did the TV get across the room still plugged in. We still talk
about that to this day. I am sure it was Mr. Phillips angry that my husband
messed with his safe. From that time on we never touched the safe again and we
moved a few month later. I still wonder if the new people in the home had
things happen as well.</font></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Well thats my story. Thanks for letting me share</font></p>
