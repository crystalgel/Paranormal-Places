<b><font size=+1>A Cat Haunting?</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BLynne18@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Though animals have been known to "haunt" places I have never experienced
it</b>
<br><b>until I moved into my new apartment. Last month my mom and I moved
into our</b>
<br><b>new apartment. A couple weeks ago she walked past the kitchen and
saw a tall</b>
<br><b>woman with dark brown hair. At first I thought she meant me then
she said no</b>
<br><b>she was taller than you. Then about two weeks ago my mom's friend
was over</b>
<br><b>and asked if we had a cat. Of course we didn't at the time. Then
she said she</b>
<br><b>saw one walk past. Okay we thought she was seeing things, cause
she was</b>
<br><b>drinking. Then I was in the pantry peeling carrots the next day
and saw a cat</b>
<br><b>walk past. Then the day after that I saw it walk past my mom's feet.
I told</b>
<br><b>her and she just said that all I saw was her feet moving. Then a
couple days</b>
<br><b>later I heard her gasp. I asked what was wrong and she said, " I
just saw a</b>
<br><b>cat walk past my feet." I started laughing and told her, "see there
is a</b>
<br><b>ghost cat here."&nbsp; I just got a cat yesterday and it looks just
like the ghost</b>
<br><b>cat we've been seeing. It's very strange. We haven't seen the ghost
cat for a</b>
<br><b>week now, but four days ago I heard a meow. The tv and radio were
both off</b>
<br><b>and my mom was out walking her dog. So I have both seen and heard
it. I am</b>
<br><b>not losing my mind.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Claudia and about 10 or 11 years ago
I lived in a house where</b>
<br><b>ghosts still inhabited. Long before my family and I moved there,
there was a</b>
<br><b>story about a man who lived there and he had a wife and his two
children. He</b>
<br><b>murdered them and buried them somewhere in or around the house.
When my</b>
<br><b>mother was home (alone), she lived there with her 6 sisters and
my self.</b>
<br><b>Everyone was at work. Except my Mom. All of a sudden she heard music
Blasting</b>
<br><b>from the basement which was my Aunt Elisa's room. She opened the
door and</b>
<br><b>quickly said "Hey! Turn down the music!" And she heard an "OK!"
Then a car</b>
<br><b>pulled up in front of the house and the first person to come out
of the car</b>
<br><b>was my Aunt Elisa. And no one else was home.</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Jessica</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nickay13@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have been an avid visitor to your page, but have</b>
<br><b>always been a little wary about sending you my story.</b>
<br><b>Recently, I have come to my wits end and I think I am</b>
<br><b>on the verge of insanity.&nbsp; I can't sleep, I can't eat,</b>
<br><b>I fear going home and I can't talk to any one about</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; Now, I would like to share you my story:</b>
<br><b>I have lived in the same house for 17 years now (I am</b>
<br><b>19).&nbsp; I have never really noticed anything unusual.</b>
<br><b>When I was six, my neighbor's six year old neice,</b>
<br><b>Jessica, was struck and killed by a semi-truck.&nbsp; I had</b>
<br><b>never known her and didn't hear about her until a few</b>
<br><b>years ago.&nbsp; When she died, my neighbor gave me all her</b>
<br><b>old dolls, as she didn't have a daughter of her own.</b>
<br><b>After a few months, I developed an imaginary (or so I</b>
<br><b>thought) freind named "Jessica".&nbsp; This freaked out my</b>
<br><b>mother, but I had no idea that she had been an actual</b>
<br><b>living person at one time.&nbsp; Some nights, we would</b>
<br><b>return home to find all her dolls lying on the living</b>
<br><b>room floor.&nbsp; At night, I would lie awake and talk to</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; When I was about eight years old, I outgrew</b>
<br><b>"Jessica", and forgot about her, until I was 12.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was helping my neighbor organize her photo albums when</b>
<br><b>I came accross a picture of my "Jessica".&nbsp; It was at</b>
<br><b>this time that I became aware that my childhood</b>
<br><b>playmate may have been a ghost.&nbsp; When I showed the</b>
<br><b>picture to my family, my brother grew extremely pale</b>
<br><b>and began to stutter.&nbsp; He finally explained that the</b>
<br><b>girl in the picture had the same likeness of a girl he</b>
<br><b>had dreamed about standing at my bedroom dorr when we</b>
<br><b>were little.</b>
<br><b>This was just the beginning of such occurences.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>I was 13, I dated this guy I had met at a high school</b>
<br><b>football game.&nbsp; We had been dating a couple of months</b>
<br><b>when he called me in a panic one day.&nbsp; He said he had</b>
<br><b>just come from the grocery store where an old woman</b>
<br><b>had identified him as my boyfriend.&nbsp; She gave him an</b>
<br><b>accurate description of my name; address; physicality,</b>
<br><b>incuding a brief description of the mole on my inner</b>
<br><b>thigh, of which no one but my doctor knows about.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>gave me her name and it was no one I knew.&nbsp; Later that</b>
<br><b>night when I was going to bed, I turned out my light</b>
<br><b>to see dozens of tiny colored lights dancing on my</b>
<br><b>ceiling.&nbsp; This lasted for many weeks, and nothing I</b>
<br><b>did seemed to make them go away.&nbsp; Finally, I broke up</b>
<br><b>with my boyfriend and never saw them again.</b>
<br><b>For years, nothing happened.&nbsp; I began to live a</b>
<br><b>carefree, and sleep filled, life.&nbsp; Untill recently.</b>
<br><b>There has been much discussion in my house about</b>
<br><b>moving.&nbsp; I'm not too keen on the idea, but we don't</b>
<br><b>live in the best neighborhood anyway.&nbsp; Well, lately I</b>
<br><b>have been feeling an extremely angry presence in my</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; I have been feeling it for a few weeks now.</b>
<br><b>When I am home alone, whether day or night, the</b>
<br><b>presence seems to follow me around.&nbsp; At night, I feel</b>
<br><b>it perch by my closet door, watching me.&nbsp; It seems to</b>
<br><b>not want me to sleep.&nbsp; I have tried everything from</b>
<br><b>sleeping pills; sleeping in another room; and even</b>
<br><b>sleeping with my light on.&nbsp; I dread going home at</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; I have been awake for almost three weeks now.</b>
<br><b>I want to try and do a cleansing, but I'm afraid if I</b>
<br><b>do it wrong I'll only make the spirit angrier.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Two Stories</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ttrendel@indiana.edu</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The first story is about a house that used to be owned by mr great
aunt. She owned a large two-story house in Indiana. Her husband had passes
away several years ago of a heart attack. My grandmother used to take me
to visit her when I stayed at her house. On the second story there was
a large room with 2 windows. This was supposedly the room in which her
husband had passes away. Every morning, my great-aunt would wake</b>
<br><b>up to find the door and both windows in the room open, even though
they had been closed the night before. She even tried to nail the door
shut once. She awook to find the door open and the nail ripped out of the
door jamb.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>The second story is not a haunting, but a strange story which my
father told me and that he swears up and down about. He grew up in rural
Indiana on a farm in the 40's and 50's. He would help out my grandfather
quite a bit after school. He told me that when he was about 13 or so, he
got some corns on his feet. When he showed these to my Grandmother, she
told him to go and sleep on the back porch. She told him that the moonlight
would do him a little good. My father complied and slept on the back porch
on a cot. He told me that he later awoke with</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;my grandmother sitting at the foot of his bed with her hand
on his foot. She was talking, but not in his direction and it seemed to
just be babble. He did'nt say anything and pretended like he was asleep.
This continued for awhile until she left and he fell back asleep. The next
morning he awoke to find that the corns he had had the previous day were
now completely gone. No scars or anything. When my father first told me
about this story as a child, I was very interested and later asked my Grandmother
about it. As she gave me a mischevious smile, she</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;did'nt deny it, but completely refused to talk about it. I
asked her a few more times, always with the same result.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>A Ghost in Kansas.</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Yuuperguy@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is the only experience I have ever had with a ghost. It happened
in</b>
<br><b>1969 on the night of the moon landing.&nbsp; My parents my brother
and three</b>
<br><b>of my sisters&nbsp; and I were traveling from Utah to Northern Michigan,
We</b>
<br><b>had stopped to spend a few days at my aunts house in kansas. (She
owns a</b>
<br><b>big house, three stories with a lot of rooms)</b>
<br><b>During the day we had great fun playing in the large yard, enjoying
the</b>
<br><b>shade of the huge oak trees.&nbsp; As evening started I had glanced
in the</b>
<br><b>window to the living room and saw everyone sitting around the tv,
and</b>
<br><b>that is where I was when man first stepped on the moon. I was filled</b>
<br><b>with a sense of wonder as I watched and heard those words "One small</b>
<br><b>step for man...."&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while I was distracted by
fireflies in the</b>
<br><b>front yard and went to catch them.&nbsp; Soon I was called in to
eat dinner,</b>
<br><b>(I was 12 years old at the time.) I don't remember the rest of the</b>
<br><b>evening until I was in bed.&nbsp; We were on the third floor, in
a huge</b>
<br><b>bedroom, my parents were sleeping in a big bed near the door to
the</b>
<br><b>room, my brother and I were on cots by the windows, these were big
bay</b>
<br><b>windows, and the cots were actually in a little alcove sort of place.</b>
<br><b>The streetlight outside shone brightly into the room,&nbsp; I don't
know what</b>
<br><b>woke me up.&nbsp; I could hear some thunder rumbling across the
plains. (It</b>
<br><b>sounded like a giant bowling alley) It would rumble quietly then
build</b>
<br><b>in intensity until it boomed against the house.</b>
<br><b>I have never been afraid of thunder and was enjoying the sound when</b>
<br><b>suddenly the door to the room quietly opened. It swung on its hinges
as</b>
<br><b>if someone had entered the room. And then an old woman walked around
the</b>
<br><b>corner of the hall and into the room.&nbsp; She looked scared as
she hurried</b>
<br><b>across the room past my cot and walked into the big walk in closet
by my</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; On the other end of the closet was a bathroom and I expected
to</b>
<br><b>see her go into it but she just disappeared. I didn't recognize
her, she</b>
<br><b>was wearing a shawl around her shoulders and white shoes with buttons
up</b>
<br><b>the side. Needless to say I became frightened let out a yell and
ran all</b>
<br><b>the way down to the front porch hollaring all the way.&nbsp; I don't
remember</b>
<br><b>what happened next, but do remember my father saying we are not
going to</b>
<br><b>spend another night in this house.</b>
<br><b>We left at about 5 in the morning and have never gone back.&nbsp;
I talked to</b>
<br><b>my cousin years later and she said a Mrs Bobbit had lived there
years</b>
<br><b>before and had died of a heart attack in that closet. (Maybe going
to</b>
<br><b>the bathroom to get her medicine?)</b>
<br><b>This is my one and only experience with ghosts, I actually am somewhat</b>
<br><b>of a skeptic otherwise.&nbsp; In my opinion what I saw was a recording
being</b>
<br><b>replayed in space and time, maybe the storm had something to do
with it,</b>
<br><b>I don't know, I really don't think Mrs Bobbit was aware of anything,
The</b>
<br><b>one thing that puzzles me is how the door opened before she walked</b>
<br><b>around the corner in the hallway.</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>A Grandfather's Love</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Lmorgan711@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I hope this is useful to you.&nbsp; I swear that this story is true.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I remember several years ago, my best friend and I went to visit
her brother</b>
<br><b>and his girfriend named Phyllis.&nbsp; I had known Phyllis and all
the extended</b>
<br><b>members of her family since I was about 8 years old.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When we got to their apartment, Phyllis was very upset and crying.</b>
<br><b>Apparently,&nbsp; she and Bret had been watching a video of her
twin nephew's</b>
<br><b>recent christening.&nbsp; When asked why she was so upset, she said
because her</b>
<br><b>grandfather was there at the christening.&nbsp; Now I knew that
her grandfather</b>
<br><b>had died about 3 years prior, so I was more than curious as to what
she had</b>
<br><b>seen.&nbsp; She didn't want to play the video again, but after alot
of coaxing we</b>
<br><b>sat down to watch it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>She fast forwarded the tape to the end of the christening as the
family was</b>
<br><b>preparing to leave the church.&nbsp; The videographer was behind
the priest</b>
<br><b>filming the ceremony and at the back of the church, you could see
an elderly</b>
<br><b>man standing in a black suit, with hat in hand. The shot of this
man was a</b>
<br><b>little blurry, but certainly you could pick up these distinguising
marks.</b>
<br><b>The next shot of the video was the proud parent's coming out of
the church</b>
<br><b>with the twins.&nbsp; As the videographer was filming the couple
coming down the</b>
<br><b>stairs, the same man came out of the church all alone, with his
hat on.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>lifted his face towards the camera, then looked up, touched his
hat. bent his</b>
<br><b>head and moved off the screen to the left.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have to tell you, as soon as I saw him, I too began crying.&nbsp;
I knew this</b>
<br><b>man to be Phyllis' deceased grandfather.&nbsp; I'd never seen anything
like it</b>
<br><b>before and I'll never forget it as long as I live.&nbsp; Apparently
"grandpa"</b>
<br><b>wanted to be there to see these precious children be christened.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;My&nbsp; Experience</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Siobahn525@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I'm not sure if these qualify as "experiences" or not.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 4, we moved to a new town, into a home of our own.&nbsp;
Shortly after</b>
<br><b>we moved in, I started experiencing the bed shaking and a sensation
of tunnel</b>
<br><b>vision and auditory noises like buzzing or ringing that would start
in the</b>
<br><b>midrange of my hearing and then would become quieter and quieter
until it was</b>
<br><b>just below human hearing.&nbsp; I could still "feel" the sound,
though.&nbsp; I had</b>
<br><b>trouble sleeping one night, having become used to the nightly bedshakes,</b>
<br><b>tunnel vision and noises and being unable to sleep in their absence,
and saw</b>
<br><b>a column of light appear in the middle of my bedroom. I was completely
and</b>
<br><b>thoroughly terrified.&nbsp; Whatever it was seemed to know I could
deal with the</b>
<br><b>rocking of the bed and the noises but not with seeing it.&nbsp;
These sensations</b>
<br><b>continued every night until I moved out of the house 13 years later.&nbsp;
I never</b>
<br><b>mentioned it to anyone, coming from a very pragmatic, old Yankee
type of</b>
<br><b>family until my brother brought it up a few years ago.&nbsp; Apparently,
he</b>
<br><b>experienced the same things!</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've also had strange experiences picking up "bad vibes".&nbsp; I
was travelling</b>
<br><b>by car with my aunt and uncle when I was about 18.&nbsp; There were
two different</b>
<br><b>routes to take and my uncle called out to my aunt and I to chose
which way we</b>
<br><b>were going.&nbsp; At the last possible moment, I yelled "Left, take
a left NOW!"</b>
<br><b>He did and just as we took the left, a car crested the rise and
crossed the</b>
<br><b>yellow line and slammed into a tree right where we were before we
took the</b>
<br><b>left.&nbsp; A few years later, I was driving to work in heavy traffic.&nbsp;
Normally</b>
<br><b>I'm a very aggressive driver but felt I shouldn't run the yellow,
almost red</b>
<br><b>light.&nbsp; The car behind me changed lanes and ran the red light.&nbsp;
Just as she</b>
<br><b>did this, a truck careening out of control off the thruway swerved
and hit</b>
<br><b>her head on, killing her instantly.&nbsp; Around the same time,
I was househunting</b>
<br><b>with my husband.&nbsp; We found the "perfect" house .... a pretty
cape cod with</b>
<br><b>beach rights.&nbsp; When we went to look at the house, I took a
few steps into the</b>
<br><b>house and the hair on my arms and neck stood straight up.&nbsp;
I had to get out</b>
<br><b>of the house immediately.&nbsp; I knew there was no way I could
live there.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>found out from some neighbors later that the previous owners had
been</b>
<br><b>engaging in self-mutiliation and were involved in some satanic rituals
in the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; All I knew was I couldn't stand the house...</b><b></b>
<p><b>Any way..these are some of my experiences...for what their worth.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Funny-Strange</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: kristyland1@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I used to live in a little attic apartment with my cat. I had a few
odd</b>
<br><b>things happen there that I couldn't explain.</b>
<br><b>I came home from running some errands and laid down for a short
nap. I woke</b>
<br><b>up and went to blow my nose, only to discover the tissues were covered
in</b>
<br><b>blood! (NOT mine). I also noticed that my cat was cowering under
the sofa</b>
<br><b>and refused to come to me, which is very, very unusual for her.
She seemed</b>
<br><b>to be scared of me and was acting quite out of character. Naturally,
I had a</b>
<br><b>minor panic. I had been by myself and someone had been bleeding
in my</b>
<br><b>apartment. Quite unsettling. I chalked it up to my nosy landlords
and</b>
<br><b>decided to forget about it (I was also a student and couldn't afford
to move</b>
<br><b>because of the ridiculously cheap rent). A few weeks later, I came
home from</b>
<br><b>an evening out. Standing in my hall, I looked into my darkened living
room</b>
<br><b>and saw a strange white thing lying on my floor. When I picked it
up, I saw</b>
<br><b>that it was an ugly, tacky, off-white necktie with different flavours
of</b>
<br><b>coffee beans (columbian, brazilian, etc.) labeled all over it. This
was NOT</b>
<br><b>mine, again. Upon closer inspection, I found what appeared to be
old, dried</b>
<br><b>blood stains on the tie. When I wrapped the tie around my hand,
I saw that</b>
<br><b>it must have been used as a bandage to cover a wound on someone's
palm. This</b>
<br><b>was a little freaky, but at least it wasn't fresh blood this time.
Again,</b>
<br><b>too broke to move, I figured that if the spirit (or my landlords)
wanted me</b>
<br><b>dead, they would have done it a long time ago.</b>
<br><b>The final unsettling episode was the only time I truly believed
something</b>
<br><b>supernatural was taking place in my little home. I climbed into
bed for the</b>
<br><b>night and was about to drift off, when I suddenly was wide awake
with the</b>
<br><b>overpowering thought that I had to get up and bring my phone close
to the</b>
<br><b>bed because my friend was going to call me at about 2:30am, to tell
me he</b>
<br><b>was coming home and to leave my keys in my mailbox. Now, I had absolutely
no</b>
<br><b>reason to think this. My friend was in Regina (4 hours away), and
had told</b>
<br><b>me earlier that day he was going to spend the night and would see
me the</b>
<br><b>next day. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't go to sleep
because</b>
<br><b>this thought was pounding in my head. Finally, I got up and brought
the</b>
<br><b>phone to my room so my brain would leave me alone. I fell asleep
almost</b>
<br><b>immediately. I woke up at 2:30am, just as the phone started to ring.
It was</b>
<br><b>my friend. He said that he changed his mind, he's coming home and
will see</b>
<br><b>me in a few hours, and to please leave the keys in my mailbox. I
was quite</b>
<br><b>awake and for the first time in my life felt like I just didn't
have any</b>
<br><b>control. I had the most riveting, eerie feeling that I was not alone
and</b>
<br><b>that these thoughts I'd been experiencing were not mine. It was
quite</b>
<br><b>horrible. I jumped out of bed, turned on every light in my apartment
and</b>
<br><b>watched happy movies until my friend arrived at 7:30.</b>
<br><b>I periodically used my ouija board in my apartment and had positive
and</b>
<br><b>negative experiences. The spiritual communication was usually quite
strong</b>
<br><b>and I never had a supernatural no-show.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have since moved and have not experienced anything like that since.
I</b>
<br><b>don't know whether this was an actual haunting. It just didn't seem
right.</b>
<br><b>When I have recounted the story, people have had very mixed reactions.
I've</b>
<br><b>been treated like an imaginative twit and a supernatural victim.
IS THIS A</b>
<br><b>COMMON TYPE OF HAUTING???? I've always wondered.</b>

it.</b>
<br><b>One day I became extremely ill and ended up in the hospital with
ruptured appendices.&nbsp; I was very ill and the infection was throughout
my body.&nbsp; Approximately on the third day of my stay in the hospital,
my roommate came to me and told me there were really odd things going in
the house and she was scared.&nbsp; I assumed that she was overreacting
and thought nothing of it.&nbsp; After my weeklong stay in the hospital
I was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;allowed to go home.&nbsp; I was ordered to stay in bed, as
I had a drain tube in me.&nbsp; My first night home, my roommate was staying
at her fianc&eacute;e's home out of town. It was about five in the morning
when I heard commotion.&nbsp; I got up to talk to my roommate to discover
she was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; I was sure she was playing a joke on
me, as the facets throughout the house were running, the cupboards and
drawers in the kitchen were all open.&nbsp; I called for her, even walking
around the block, looking for her car.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; I went back
home, crawled into bed</b>
<br><b>and again I heard more chaos.&nbsp; The same scenario repeated itself,
over and over.&nbsp; My roommate finally got home about 7 a.m., so for
two hours I had endured this nonsense.&nbsp; When she arrived home, I was
sitting in the enclosed front porch anxiously awaiting her arrival to tell
her what had been going on.&nbsp; She said, "I told you things were odd."&nbsp;
From that point on it started every night.&nbsp; In the beginning, it was
at 5 a.m.&nbsp; As days and months passed, whatever was going on became
more active.&nbsp; It eventually worked it's way up to 4:30 a.m., 4 a.m.,
3 a.m. and by the time it was really going it went from 2 a.m. non stop
until about 7.&nbsp; The strange things we encountered were footsteps,
a strange gurgling/choking noise, misplaced things, and breezes in the
house although no</b>
<br><b>windows were open.&nbsp; We had no air conditioning, only floor
board heaters.&nbsp; Karen's room seemed to be the source for the breezes
and cold air.&nbsp; We had many a fight of her accusing me of having my
window open and when, in fact, I didn't.&nbsp; Our bedrooms hooked together
with a walk-in closet between that we could pass through with a door in
each room.&nbsp; This was where the gurgling and choking noise occurred
on a very regular basis, like someone was inside our closet.&nbsp; I was
was the chosen one that got to hear shoveling sounds outside my bedroom
window</b>
<br><b>every night and yet whenever we went out there, nothing had been
dug up and no one was ever in sight. I probably would have dug around to
investigate it, but I had a bush by my window and couldn't dig that area
up.&nbsp; One of the strange occurrences that occurred was I had doilies
on tables, and they were always lying on the floor, but the item that had
been on top of the doily was always in its exact spot.&nbsp; Another strange
occurrence was I was always getting locked out of my room and having to
enter through my roommate's bedroom.&nbsp; It was an old skeleton</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;key lock on my door that no one had keys for nor was it possible
to lock it.&nbsp; As things became progressively worse, Karen and I made
a pact that we would not leave each other alone in the house at night.&nbsp;
Things were</b>
<br><b>escalating, and we were now fearful.&nbsp; We had the awful odors
that would breeze by us while in the living room or kitchen and the feeling
that we were being watched.&nbsp; On more than one occasion, I ran out
of the house and sat on the curb beside the road, knowing something was
watching me, but too afraid to turn around and look.</b>
<br><b>One night I went to my father's house, who lived out of town, and
we were having a nice visit, when all of the sudden, someone pounded on
the window real hard, and I "lost it."&nbsp; I started crying and telling
them what all had been going on.&nbsp; Due to the fact that I did not have
a phone, my dad and stepmother went over to tell Karen that I could not
stay there another night.&nbsp; My dad and his wife told me that house
had a very evil presence in it and they thought we should move.&nbsp; Karen
and I each moved back with our parents for approximately two weeks,</b>
<br><b>just to get rest and decide what we should do. We had eventually
gone back to our home.&nbsp; On our second day there, we had been out shopping
and came back, the locks would not allow access in.&nbsp; We went to our
landlord and asked to borrow her key.&nbsp; Her key wouldn't work either.&nbsp;
Whatever had gone on during our outing, the curtains throughout the house
had been closed, and we had not left the house like that.&nbsp; I went
and got my mother, and her key, and we could still not access the house.&nbsp;
Another thing to note is while trying to access through the back</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;porch, we realized the electric meter was not running at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We just knew we were going to have a mess from the freezer.&nbsp; We ended
up going to the local police department for fear someone was inside our
home.&nbsp; The police came and removed a windowpane, allowing us access
to our home and made an inspection.&nbsp; A roll of paper towels were strewn
around and cut into shreds with a knife that was laying on the counter.&nbsp;
My roommate had a shotgun that was missing, we reported it as stolen.&nbsp;
Again the doilies were all on the floor, but items were exactly where they
should have been.&nbsp; My bedroom door was again locked.&nbsp; Also, once
the house was accessed the electric meter started turning again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My older, "smarter" sister, she had an excuse for everything--- cupboards
were opening due to expansion of wood, drawers were open for some other
reason, water was turning on for another reason.&nbsp; On and on she went
with her explanations.&nbsp; I invited her to stay with us for one night.&nbsp;
She accepted the offer.&nbsp; Due to her being pregnant, she opted to sleep
out on the front porch since we did not have air conditioning.&nbsp; My
roommate and I were sleeping in my room, as we were too afraid to be alone.&nbsp;
As expected around 2 a.m. ---all this</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;commotion started in my closet, the gurgling, choking, and
footsteps as I tried frantically to wake up my roommate but was unable
arous her even though she was normally a light sleeper.&nbsp; My bedroom
door slammed shut, locking me in and the only way out of my room was through
that closet (where all the noise was coming from) or through a window.&nbsp;
As I laid there, scared beyond moving, my sister bolted up and her eyes
were as big as saucers. Something was shaking her!&nbsp; I could see this
through my bedroom window onto the porch.&nbsp; I jumped up, opened the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;window and climbed out on the porch as she told me what had
happened.&nbsp; The water was running in the sink, the cupboards were open,
the drawers were open, and the odor was strong in the living room.</b>
<br><b>The one thing we eventually learned was when a male was present
in our home, nothing ever happened.&nbsp; We eventually moved out of the
home after approximately a year and a half of mayhem and I don't believe
anyone has ever lived there since.&nbsp; Eventually someone bought it,
gutted it, remodeled it and now it still sets there empty.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I will never stop questioning what occurred, and sometimes
when Karen and I get together we talk about it, both still curious as to
what it was and what it wanted. P.S. One night while we were still living
in the home, I was sitting on Karen's bed when I saw that darned shotgun
pointing at me standing up on edge under our clawfoot tub as a breeze went
by me.</b>

<p><b>my mom and i moved into an apartment in Arlington,TX that was haunted.
if i</b>
<br><b>were in the living room watching the tv it would sometimes turn
off or switch</b>
<br><b>channels by itself. my mom has never had problems with asthma but
at night</b>
<br><b>she would be laying in her bed an unable to move or lift herself
up. it was</b>
<br><b>as if someone were holding her down. one time the ghost locked my
aunt in the</b>
<br><b>closet and wouldn't let her out. my mothers bedroom was most of
the incidents</b>
<br><b>occurred and the ghosts would never come into my bedroom they mostly
stayed</b>
<br><b>in the living room or my mothers bedroom. when i was about ten years
old i</b>
<br><b>saw my dead grandmother walking across my bedroom or at least i
think it was</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; but whoever it was i wasnt afraid when i saw her.i think
ive been in</b>
<br><b>about five haunted houses because im from the south and a lot of
the houses</b>
<br><b>in the country are haunted.</b>
