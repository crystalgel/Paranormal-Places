<b>True Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: narum@swbell.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This story was experienced within a two hour period by four un-trained</b>
<br><b>pre-teen girls visiting the Ft. Davis Historic Site. From the</b>
<br><b>easternmost authorized mountain, you could see the entire Fort,</b>
<br><b>including the hospital. I immediately creeped out at the small,
red</b>
<br><b>brick building known as the hospital, which was about .5 miles westward</b>
<br><b>of that point. Two boys, a chaperone and another of the "experiencees"</b>
<br><b>was in a group with me. Of course, our next stop was the hospital.
Once</b>
<br><b>we got to it, I immediately thought up any reason I could not to
go in.</b>
<br><b>Eventually, since we were supposed to do a word problem involving
the</b>
<br><b>buildings, and since I was the best _at_ word problems, I was forced
to</b>
<br><b>go in (the other girl in my group was accustomed to seeing ghosts.
It's</b>
<br><b>a natural talent of hers), and I felt the presence of many more
people</b>
<br><b>than were in my group there, and I felt a tingling in the back of
my</b>
<br><b>knees like I always do when I sense the supernatural, and upon telling</b>
<br><b>the other girl, she told me of her experience. She had actually
_seen_</b>
<br><b>them (the ghosts). When I told the rest, the other two girls told
of</b>
<br><b>the&nbsp; walls that changed color in the main hallway. For one
it was</b>
<br><b>brown-turned-red, and for another, brown-turned-purple.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Yes there is a haunted house on one of Halifax's business streets.</b>
<br><b>according to legend, one evening, a man was caught spying on the
witches</b>
<br><b>while they were doing a ritual dance on the verandah. The witches
became</b>
<br><b>very angry, and put a curse on the old man. And the window he was
spying</b>
<br><b>through, was turned black (the black window,there is another story
to</b>
<br><b>it, too) to this day no matter how many time the window is replaced,
it</b>
<br><b>still turns black.</b>
<br><b>The Black Window (two versions, believe which ever one you want,)</b>
<br><b>a man, that was deeply disturb decided to end his life, he climbed
a</b>
<br><b>tree out side his house and hung him self while he was falling he
kicked</b>
<br><b>the window, shattering it.</b>
<br><b>now when the replace the window it turns black.</b>
<br><b>(but there is another story to that, this one is true)</b>
<br><b>the black window II</b>
<br><b>a man was being robbed. after refusing to&nbsp; give up his money
the robber</b>
<br><b>through him out the window grabbed the money and jumped back out
the</b>
<br><b>window, he tied the man into a tree making it look like he had commited</b>
<br><b>suicide. he turned to look a the window. there was a swirling red
and</b>
<br><b>yellow light, when the light dissapeared the man the robber had
killed</b>
<br><b>stood looking at him. But the robber thought "that cant be he's
in the</b>
<br><b>tree" he looked back into the tree and sure enought the man was
there</b>
<br><b>the robber ran and ran the next day the cops found the man in the
tree.</b>
<br><b>the looked at the window and the swirling light apeared again, and
there</b>
<br><b>the man stood. but he was still in the tree. the put a new window
in,</b>
<br><b>but again it turned black, the new attendent was pyschic, and she
said</b>

<p><b>TRUCK OR GHOST??</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SILERIOA@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was fifteen I went on a hunting trip with my father and cousin
in</b>
<br><b>Durango, Mexico.&nbsp; We arrived on a Friday around one or two
in the morning.</b>
<br><b>After unloading my cousin and I couldn't sleep because we had slept
most of</b>
<br><b>the way so we decided to jump in the truck and go hunting for a
while.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>town we were in is very small.&nbsp; I estimate the population in
being less than</b>
<br><b>100 people.&nbsp; We hit the road that let us to the mountains.&nbsp;
We drove up the</b>
<br><b>steep hill lighting the sides with lanterns looking for the shiny
eyes as a</b>
<br><b>hunter does when hunting at night.&nbsp; On top of the hill there
is an old cave</b>
<br><b>called "LA CUEVA PINTA" which means "THE PAINTED CAVE."&nbsp; This
cave contains</b>
<br><b>some old indian paintings on its wall.&nbsp; We passed the cave
and drove about</b>
<br><b>another mile or so then we headed back.&nbsp; Once we got to the
cave on our way</b>
<br><b>back, my cousin stopped and pointed me toward a light shining on
the road.</b>
<br><b>Since we were on top of the hill, the road lead down in an "L" pattern.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>stared at the light for a couple of minutes and then it started
to move.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>looked like a truck making its way down the road.&nbsp; We thought
to ourselves</b>
<br><b>that the only truck out this late at night has to be the police
and since we</b>
<br><b>were hunting with no permit, we decided to hide the rifles on the
side of the</b>
<br><b>road.&nbsp; We quickly gathered all the bullets and our rifles and
hid them by an</b>
<br><b>old bob-wired fence.&nbsp; I paused and took a quick glance at the
light and it</b>
<br><b>was still moving but very slowly.&nbsp; We got back in the truck
and we were both</b>
<br><b>breathing hard because of the nervousness.&nbsp; We came down the
road.&nbsp; The light</b>
<br><b>was still visible and it seemed to have gotten brighter as we got
closer.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>came upon the curve of the road and the reflection of the light
was</b>
<br><b>noticeable on the trees.&nbsp; We turned and my cousin quickly slammed
the brakes.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There was nothing there.&nbsp; No truck, no lights no nothing.&nbsp;
My cousin then</b>
<br><b>flashed the high beams to see if we can catch a reflection of a
brake light</b>
<br><b>or something but there was nothing.&nbsp; We sat there in the truck
amazed.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>then came to think that maybe the truck pulled over and is hiding
behind some</b>
<br><b>bushes so we continued down the road.&nbsp; Branches from the mesquite
trees were</b>
<br><b>scraping the sides of the truck as we made our way through the rough
area.</b>
<br><b>It was about a half a mile drive to town and we made it all the
way without</b>
<br><b>seeing any truck.&nbsp; We arrived at my grandfather's house and
told my father</b>
<br><b>about our experiance.&nbsp; He gave us his video camera and told
us to record the</b>
<br><b>light.&nbsp; Up again the road we came and again we saw the light.&nbsp;
My cousin</b>
<br><b>parked the truck so we can collect the rifles we had hidden by the
fence.</b>
<br><b>This time the light stood in one place and it seemed to get brighter
at times</b>
<br><b>and then it would go dim.&nbsp; We got the camera and started recording.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>light continued to change sizes getting very bright to very dim.&nbsp;
At its</b>
<br><b>brightest moment, I would say the light appeared to be the size
of a</b>
<br><b>basketball.&nbsp; We recorded for a good while and we sat there
and exchanged</b>
<br><b>thoughts of what it was we were seeing.&nbsp; We arrived at my grandfather's
house</b>
<br><b>and hooked up the VCR.&nbsp; My father was already asleep so we
prepared the tape</b>
<br><b>to see it in the morning.&nbsp; In the morning we viewed the tape,
my father was</b>
<br><b>amazed.&nbsp; He said when he was a kid he used to see a light similar
to this one</b>
<br><b>we had recorded but the one he saw was more like a fireball moving
about the</b>
<br><b>mountains!&nbsp; We haved showed to the tape to many people in this
town and</b>
<br><b>everybody says the have seen lights similar to the one we captured,
but not</b>
<br><b>this large.</b>

<p><b>Generation of Haunts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sea_of_rainbows@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I ran across your web site a couple of weeks ago and right away I
knew that</b>
<br><b>I had to try to contact you.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; All my life I have had experiences (along with my entire
family)</b>
<br><b>concerning apperitions and hauntings. This has gone on in my family
for</b>
<br><b>generations.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; For example, my grandmother had a child on new years, in
those days they</b>
<br><b>did not have pennicillin to cure pnemonia so my uncle became very
ill.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; For two weeks my grandmother kept seeing a white misty cloud
but said that</b>
<br><b>she could not look into it. Two weeks prior to my uncles death,
she had</b>
<br><b>heard and seen a white dog howl under the window where Lyle (my
uncle)</b>
<br><b>slept. She also heard an owl hooting, which is rare where she lived.</b>
<br><b>Well, the night that Lyle died (right before he died) she looked
into the</b>
<br><b>mist, and what she saw was Lyles face, immediately after&nbsp;&nbsp;
looking into the</b>
<br><b>mist and seeing his face, he died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Also right after he died, my older uncle awoke my grandmother
and said</b>
<br><b>everything down stairs in the basement cellar was flying all over
the place,</b>
<br><b>it soulnded as if glass was breaking and the whole basement was
in havoc.</b>
<br><b>Upon going downstairs my grandmother said nothing was out of place.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; These incidences are not abnormnal and have happened to every
member of my</b>
<br><b>family.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In the home in which I now reside, approxamitely two weeks
ago I went to</b>
<br><b>lay down to sleep. My eyes were wide open when I saw the apperance
of a</b>
<br><b>white mist above my face. I kept looking til the mist opened up
(mind you,</b>
<br><b>my eyes were open and I was totally alert) and I saw a man smiling
at me. He</b>
<br><b>was a handsome man and looked as if he were either native american
or</b>
<br><b>african american, or a mixture of both.</b>
<br><b>All I did was become somewhat startled, but I was not frightened
as these</b>
<br><b>types of things have happened to me and members of my family all
of our</b>
<br><b>lives.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Anyway, all I did was ask,&nbsp; "who are you?" and as soon
as I said this, he</b>
<br><b>left.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In the home I now reside in with my husband and three children,
we have</b>
<br><b>all seen and heard a person walking, slamming doors, and sometimes
a white</b>
<br><b>mist appears in the hallway.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We heard that a man had died in this home, but I have no
proof of this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; On New Years eve, at exactly 12:00am, our firealarm went
off (there are no</b>
<br><b>batteries in it!) and the hot water faucet went on full blast. There
was no</b>
<br><b>one in the kitchen at the time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My Mother passed on two years ago and we often talked about
these kinds of</b>
<br><b>things. Whoever these people are, they follow our family.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When my mother passed on, I saw her spirit leave her body.
I know that</b>
<br><b>people will probably think I am off the wall or what ever, but I
have seen</b>
<br><b>things as well as my extended family all our lives.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; To go on with this story, after my mother's death, I kept
sending my</b>
<br><b>children into the bathroom to turn off my hairblower that kept turning
on by</b>
<br><b>itself..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I would also feel someone poke me on the shoulder, what my
mother ALWAYS</b>
<br><b>did to get my attention or to give me a love tap.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I know that if anyone were to investigate my home they would
get plenty of</b>
<br><b>readings. I am not sure what you do to research everything (I have
not yet</b>
<br><b>gotten to that part in your web site) but I do know that these so
called</b>
<br><b>ghosts or "apperitions" have followed my entire family and extended
family</b>
<br><b>all our lives.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; There is SO much more and so many more stories that I could
tell you but</b>
<br><b>that could take all night. So for now I will submit these couple
of things</b>
<br><b>to you and ask you just what is this mist with this man's face that
I saw</b>
<br><b>hovering over me??? It wasn't frightening, just kind of startled
me as I was</b>
<br><b>not expecting this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time to read this and I would
like to tell you</b>
<br><b>that so far I have enjoyed your site immensley.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I have many stories to tell you, but I will wait to see if
I recieve a</b>
<br><b>response back.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for your time.</b>

<br><b>The Watcher</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: myq13@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; This is just one of several stories I have to contribute.&nbsp;
I have a</b>
<br><b>"watcher" ghost that I've been seeing as far back as I can remember.&nbsp;
As far</b>
<br><b>as I know it's male, and he watches me either as a protector, or
just for</b>
<br><b>fun, I'm not sure.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My first experience I don't even remember, but my mom told
me about when I</b>
<br><b>was little (like 3-4) she'd hear me talking after I went to bed,
she came in</b>
<br><b>the room thinking I was awake, she found me lying in bed, talking
in my</b>
<br><b>sleep, saying "I only see the shadows when they're creeping around
me."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The first time I remember seeing him was a few years later
when I was</b>
<br><b>about 6 or 7, I was in the woods with some friends, and I saw this
pitch</b>
<br><b>black man run across the trail about a hundred yards away from me,
now this</b>
<br><b>was in the middle of the day, on a well lit trail with no trees
around.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The next sighting I had was when I was about 10, after we
had moved</b>
<br><b>sleeping over a friends house.&nbsp; We were in the den watching
T.V. and I got</b>
<br><b>up to get a book from his room,&nbsp; I went through the house not
bothering to</b>
<br><b>turn on lights as I went, cuz I knew the way.&nbsp; When I get to
the living</b>
<br><b>room, I saw the black man again.&nbsp; He was standing half in a
shadow, about 3</b>
<br><b>feet away from me, and looking out watching me,&nbsp; the really
freaky part was</b>
<br><b>that when I looked into his face, it looked like he was made of
shadow,</b>
<br><b>completely 2 dimensional, and his eyes were cut outs (I saw the
rest of the</b>
<br><b>room behind him).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; From then on I saw him all the time.&nbsp; Wherever
I was my house, a friends</b>
<br><b>house, driving, at night, or during the day, I'd see him watching
me, as</b>
<br><b>soon as he saw that I saw him, he'd hide disappear, or hide behind</b>
<br><b>something.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 2 occasions when someone else saw him, the
first was my</b>
<br><b>girlfriend.&nbsp; She was staying over one night, this was in my
parents house,</b>
<br><b>before we were married, so we slept in separate rooms, she had my
bed, and I</b>
<br><b>got the couch.&nbsp; Well the next morning she told me that she
woke up in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night, and felt as if she was being watched, she opened
her</b>
<br><b>eyes and saw him standing over her, she felt very threatened, like
he was</b>
<br><b>extremely angry at her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other time someone else him was a few days after
that, I was lying on</b>
<br><b>my bed, home alone, with my pet rat.&nbsp; I had her out of the
cage, and ket her</b>
<br><b>run around while I was relaxing.&nbsp; Suddenly the rat got very
scared, and ran</b>
<br><b>over to me and hid, all the time squeaking, and clicking her teeth</b>
<br><b>nervously, this was very odd behavior for her.&nbsp; At that point
I decided to</b>
<br><b>get some answers, I had been studying the supernatural for some
time, and</b>
<br><b>decided to try and communicate with him.&nbsp; I put myself into
a trance and</b>
<br><b>asked him to identify himself.&nbsp; He said he couldn't, but told
me he meant no</b>
<br><b>harm, and that he is here to watch me.&nbsp; He couldn't explain
any more.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>apologized for scaring the rat and my girlfriend, he then explained
why he</b>
<br><b>was so angry at her, according to him, that was my bed, and I should've
been</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if I'm alone or not, but no one should
use it</b>
<br><b>without me.&nbsp; I told him it was ok with me for her to be there,
and that he</b>
<br><b>was free to watch me as long as he wanted, but not interfere with
my life,</b>
<br><b>or the lives of those around me, at the point he said that was ok
with him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I still see him all the time, and whenever i do I feel safe
in that</b>
<br><b>whatever happens to me, it won't go unnoticed, and if necessary,
I'm sure</b>
<br><b>he'd do what he could to help.</b>

<p><b>The Gettysburg Ghost</b><b></b>

<p><b>I am a civil war reenactor and my unit and I were down to Gettysburg
for the</b>
<br><b>Rememberance Day parade. It was the Friday that sarted the weekend,and
we</b>
<br><b>decided to walk through devils den and the Traingular Feild. We
all sat down</b>
<br><b>and started telling ghost stories. I got up to tell my one expreience,
and</b>
<br><b>then my grandfather got up to tell his, and so on. As I finished
I silnlently</b>
<br><b>refelceted on the beautiful place I was in. As my pap pap started
telling his</b>
<br><b>story I heard drums in the woods to my left. Then I smelled a strong
odor of</b>
<br><b>sulfer {gunpowder}. I looked to my right at my grandmother and said"
Do you</b>
<br><b>smell that?" I was very familiar with the smell, and I have heared
of</b>
<br><b>smelling it before on the ghost tours I have been on. I figured
I am just</b>
<br><b>going to let it go. Then these people {tourists} came up to us said
" Their</b>
<br><b>isn't any reenactments going on tonight right, because we heard
drums." I</b>
<br><b>told them that we had heard it too, and all of my freinds said that
they</b>
<br><b>heard the drums and smelled the sulfer. The also mentioned that
all the cars</b>
<br><b>by the woods would go on the road, pause for a mintue, and continue.
I am</b>
<br><b>very sensitive to paranormalactivity and I think this was just more
ghosts</b>
<br><b>trying to tell us of their horrible experince.</b>

<p><b>The Bedroom Set</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RGLASS@eecnet.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>i have had a few run-ins with the supernatural throughout my life,
but the</b>
<br><b>most recent occurance was in the fall of 1996. i decided that i
wanted to</b>
<br><b>buy a bedroom set with a vanity. i picked up a newspaper that i
had never</b>
<br><b>read before (nor have i read since) but i had a "feeling" that i
would find</b>
<br><b>my set advertised in there. i called about the set and talked to
an older</b>
<br><b>woman (mrs. t.) who was selling off the estate of her sister and</b>
<br><b>brother-in-law who had passed on in the last few years. mrs.t. said
i could</b>
<br><b>come over to see it. as weird as it sounds, she "interviewed" me
before i</b>
<br><b>was allowed upstairs to look at it. mrs t. told me she had turned
away</b>
<br><b>others because she did not think they would take good care of the
bedroom</b>
<br><b>set or just plain because she did not like them. fortunately she
took a</b>
<br><b>liking to me and i had "permission" to buy the set. i fell in love
with it</b>
<br><b>and got all seven antique pieces for a steal! immediately upon taking
it</b>
<br><b>home and polishing it up, strange things started to happen. i would
wake up</b>
<br><b>every morning with my quilt folded very neatly at the end of the
bed. for</b>
<br><b>some reason i assumed it was my mother's doings so i never mentioned
it.</b>
<br><b>this happened every night for about a month. then one night i woke
up and</b>
<br><b>bending over me, looking directly into my face, was a woman with
long white</b>
<br><b>curly hair. i yelped and shot up out of bed. i looked back towards
the</b>
<br><b>headboard but there was no one there. i convinced myself i had been
dreaming</b>
<br><b>and went back to bed. a few nights later i mentioned the occurances
to my</b>
<br><b>mother. she said she was not folding my quilt but she was going
to call mrs.</b>
<br><b>t. to ask her about it. as it turns out, the original owner of the
set mrs.</b>
<br><b>t.'s younger sister, whom we shall call victoria. victoria came
from a</b>
<br><b>prominant italian family in the boston area. all of the children
had dark</b>
<br><b>hair and eyes, except victoria, who had platinum WHITE hair her
entire life.</b>
<br><b>her brothers and sisters used to tease her as a child saying she
was the</b>
<br><b>milkman's daughter! she married and had always dreamed of having
a duaghter,</b>
<br><b>but the couple never had any children. she was very proud of her
beautiful</b>
<br><b>bedroom set, but even more proud of the handmade quilt she kept
FOLDED AT</b>
<br><b>THE END OF HER BED!&nbsp; mrs. t. discussed what had happened with
her family and</b>
<br><b>they all decided that i was the "daughter" victoria had never had
and fate</b>
<br><b>had directed mrs. t. to let me buy the set. they felt that victoria
was</b>
<br><b>folding my quilt just like she had folded her own for so many years.
they</b>
<br><b>also felt that she had been bending over me to give me a kiss when
i woke up</b>
<br><b>and I scared HER! the night i found this out i went home and sat
down on my</b>
<br><b>bed. i spoke to victoria and told her i would take very good care
of her</b>
<br><b>beloved bedroom set, but i did not want her "hanging out" in my
room anymore</b>
<br><b>because she had scared me. all was quiet for about a week until
one night</b>
<br><b>when i noticed my cat looking at the spot where victoria had appeared
and he</b>
<br><b>was purring. then he stretched out his paw to that spot as if reaching
out</b>
<br><b>to her. i yelled at him, telling him he was not allowed to "be nice"
to her</b>
<br><b>because she wasn't supposed to be there! he blinked slowly a few
times at</b>
<br><b>the spot, then jumped off the bed and left the room. that was the
last i</b>
<br><b>heard from victoria.</b>

<br><b>Strange Happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Bowlin1der@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I really don't know where to begin but I'm certainly glad that i
found your</b>
<br><b>website and know now i'm not crazy or alone.My first experience
with what i</b>
<br><b>think are ghosts is the house we are currently living in in Tempe,Arizona.
I</b>
<br><b>have two other roommates and my boyfriend living in this house.
Two days</b>
<br><b>after we moved in, the garage door that leads into the living room
flew</b>
<br><b>opened and stopped at a specific point before the wall.I thought
maybe it</b>
<br><b>was our roommate playing a joke on us&nbsp; because he is the only
one with</b>
<br><b>access of opening that door.Nope not him, he's still at work. Then
we went</b>
<br><b>to investigate and nothing in garage. I still can't explained that
door but</b>
<br><b>if my boyfriend hadn't of seen the same thing people would not believe
us.</b>
<br><b>The next experience in the same house happened a couple of months
ago, I was</b>
<br><b>making dinner and heard my roommates bedroom door open and shut
and keys</b>

<br><b>my roommate came out of his room and i asked how did you get back

<br><b>My last instance is the broken fan in the bathroom. We never use

<br><b>left the fan on in the bathroom and i said "no, i thought you said
not to</b>
<br><b>use it." Four other times that day the fan would be on and not one

<p><b>Grandma's Bedroom Set</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: indreams@danceart.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is heather and I thought that you would like to here my
story. I am 14 years old ans at the time I was 13. But here I go and I
was wondering if you could put this in your web page. Well this is how
it started out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This all started happening when I moved my grandma's bedroom
set down we went up there and she gave me this beautiful bedroom set. well
anyways she gave us alot of other stuff like really old pictures and stuff
like that. Well let me get to the pointe. before this all happened I had
a dream that I was walking down a hall way but it looked like I was in
a mine or an undergroung mine (where they try and find gold) and I was
walking and there were these guys and they were digging and one turned
around and smiled and me and i thought that I have seen him before but
then I kept walking down the hallway and one guy stood up and he told me
not to go down there because it was haunted. But of course I did not listen
and I kept on going but when i was walking i could see this figure of white
smoke and then it started to get fuller and then it was a women in a white
victorian dress but she had not feet and her hair was pulled back and she
had a pale face and she came towords me and she grabbed my arm but i was
scared and I tryed to get away. Then after that I woke up. never had the
dream agian but it scared me and anyways time passed and my mom told me
to go get the pictures that my grandma gave me and i went and got them
and when we were going through them picked up one and looked at it and
was freaked out and my mom ask me what was wrong and I told her that this
was the same woman that was in my dream. And it was this picture she was
happy and it was</b>
<br><b>an old picture and she had white frizzy hair and was pulled back.
And i was really scared. that is only the begining and then i was going
through the rest and I picked up a picture of these guys and i looked at
it and the same guy that i saw in my dream that smiled at me was in there
and all the other guys that were in my dream was in there two. I was soooo
freaked out. But them time passed and I got my bedroom set done and I got
it set up and that i when things started to happen. I was sick one time
i mean really sick and i was sleeping and it was about 3:00 a.m. and i
woke up and I saw the same women in my dream standing there in my bathroom
and she was just looking at me and I was just laying there and she would
never leave untill i fell asleep. well anyways the other time was when
i was laying there in my bed and i was tired that night am i have been
crying and i woke up and i saw her agian and this time she was right by
my bedside and she smiled and i could feel something cold rubbing my arm
and it was her hand and she did the same thing she did go away untill i
fell asleep. Anways I was getting use! to her and when ever i saw her she
did not scare me but when i was talking to my mom one day she was saying
to me that she has had some things happen to here she would have things
dissapear and she would have things move when her back was turned. And
she also told me that when i am downstairs she can hear footsteps in my
bedroom. and after i had this talk with her the women was never there anymore
but then i started seeing black figures in my bedroom. oh yeah and i also
found out that the guy that was smiling at me was her brother. that is
my story and I was wondrering if</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;you could please write me back as soon as you read this letter
and know i am starting to see the black figure more and more. the other
thing that i wanted to tell u was that i can always tell when there is
a ghost in the room. i get this high pitch nose in my ears and i think
that there are three ghost living in my house and i think there is a guy
a women and a little girl.</b>

<p><b>By: VeraLissar@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I dont know if this exactally counts but in littleton there have
always been strange happenings.&nbsp; In my house things dissapear all
the time and we can never find them, lights never works and we have problems
with our heat.&nbsp; Certain rooms are always cold and at the top of the
staircase there are scents of food cooking when there is no food cooking
in the kitchen downstairs, theres never the scent anywhere else in the
house.&nbsp; There is a spot above the fireplace where the paint has chipped
off in the shape of a strange animal we jokingly call the rat squirell,
but you get an uneasy feeling if you look at it long enough.&nbsp; I have
a friend who refuses to sleep in the same room with it.&nbsp; Many of my
friends report simaler feelings of cold or being uneasy in various parts
of their houses.&nbsp; In a nieghbor hood known as The Valley many people
have reported gohst sightings and strange happenings such as objects going
missing or being rearanged in the night, strange noises, and things being
destroyed.&nbsp; A friend of mine has many stories about strange happenings
in his basement, such as a time a large neon sign hanging on his wall began
shaking violently for no apparent reason.&nbsp; Another friend of mine
who lives in the vally showed me to a spot in her house where she belived
was some sort of negative energy or gateway to another world.&nbsp; When
i sat in it i became overwhelmed with feelings of depression and anger,
and that night i had bizzar dreams, some of which ended up being clairvoiant.&nbsp;
It is kind of an urban legand around here that the valley is nothing more
than a huge idian barrial ground, some people also say that it was a spot
the donner party traveled trough before they got stuck.&nbsp; Many people
i know who moved here from relitively far away (my self included) say they
have devleoped clairvoiant dreams and feelings of precognition.&nbsp; And
clemit park had been the site of many strange occurances even before the
tragedy at Columbine.&nbsp; I was told by a friends older brother when
i first moved here that the library in clemit park was haunted, and if
you stayed ther late at night you could see mists by the booksheves and
the computers wont work right.&nbsp; I later heard simaler stories from
a girlwhos mother worked at the library, and she told me of seeing flashing
lights over the lake outside the library.&nbsp; Many of my friends have
said they have been visited by spirits of some type or strange occurances
since columbine, either in dreams or when wide awake, and i myself woke
up one night to see a friend of mine who died recently sitting on my couch.&nbsp;
I blinked my eyes a couple times and he was gone, but there was a strange
feeling about the room, strangly, not a negative one.&nbsp; I only know
for sure what i have experianced for my self, but many of the stories i've
heard have simalarities to each other and my own experiances, although
a loth of them come from around the highschool and other adaults i know
who are considered eccentric&nbsp; hippies.&nbsp; Therefor this my not
be the most reliable of stories, but i thought i'd offer the information
because most everyone around here agrees that there are certain places
you go around here and it feels like youve walked right into a steven king
novel.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would suggest checking out The Valley, Clemit Park,
Chatfield resevoir, and the areas around Chatfield Ave.</b>

<p><b>While working one evening to Finnish the remodel before school</b>
<br><b>would resume the September of 1998. My partner was down towards

<br><b>of the corridor. He told me he felt uneasy, and wanted to call it
a night.</b>
<br><b>Naturally I was curious, and wanted to know why. He said he felt

I</b>

<p><b>Two Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:jgodinez@aracnet.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp; I noticed that several people wanted to know
how to do the sage smudging to cleanse their houses but were unsure how
to do it.&nbsp; I have two stories to submit and will give directions for
the cleansing at the end.&nbsp; First Story:&nbsp; My father had a being
that was attached to him that was not very nice.&nbsp; My sisters and I
called it "The Aztec ___hole."&nbsp; I don't know why we called it that,
but that was the feeling we got from it. Although my father was devoutly
religious he was not sensitive in any sense of the word.&nbsp; This being
thrived on grief and fear and would try to terrorize us when ever he could.&nbsp;
(the Aztec, not my Dad.) and never entered the church when my Dad would
go. I never actually saw this thing but I knew it was there and it was
male and it was a jerk.&nbsp; One night after my sisters had gone on to
college, I was sleeping in the living room because we had other family
over.&nbsp; In the middle of the night I heard footsteps and assumed that
it was someone in the family up and getting water or going to the bathroom
or whatever.&nbsp; I didn't think much about it until the footsteps came
closer and circled where I was.&nbsp; I looked up and there was no one
there. I turned on the lamp near the couch and I could see foot prints
in the carpet... being made.&nbsp; I knew immediately that it was the Aztec
___hole!&nbsp; It proceeded to walk to the piano and kick it so it made
a noise.&nbsp; I was really scared and knew it was standing there smiling
that I was so afraid. I tried to calm myself and started to pray and when
I did that it left.&nbsp; Years later my Dad died and I knew when he died
that he had gone to that great clearing house in the sky to figure out
what he had done this lifetime and what to do the next.&nbsp; I had no
sense of him hanging around which was really good and comforting.&nbsp;
However, a few nights after his death I was sitting at the table late at
night and lo and behold the atmosphere changed and a very humble Aztec
___hole entered the room.&nbsp; Since my Dad had moved on he had no one
to attach to.&nbsp; He actually had the nerve to ask if he could attach
to me!&nbsp; I prayed and basically said out loud."In the name of Christ
you are not welcome here. You may not attach to me, this house, my family,
our animals nothing that has anything to do with us.&nbsp; In the name
of Christ, be gone!" Then I said&nbsp; "Lord, bless this house and remove
any disincarnated being that is not suppose to be here.&nbsp; Thank You!&nbsp;
Amen."&nbsp; I have never felt it since.&nbsp; Thank God!&nbsp; Since then
mom has remodeled the house and it is much lighter and happier!&nbsp; O.K.
Second story:&nbsp; This one is a nice one not scary.&nbsp; I had a Great
Uncle Wayne and he was a great uncle in more ways than one! I and my whole
family just adored him!&nbsp; When I was sixteen my Mom and I decided to
go see the U.K.&nbsp; While we were there we both saw a man at our first
stop in Ireland that looked just like Uncle Wayne, I guess that's called
a doppelganger.&nbsp; Anyway we both commented to each other how much he
looked like Uncle Wayne.&nbsp; The man was smoking a cigar (Just like Uncle
Wayne.&nbsp; Uncle Wayne loved cigars!) and drinking and laughing and having
a great time.&nbsp; We didn't speak to him, but he could have passed for
his twin.&nbsp; We were gone for a month on our trip.(Had a fabulous time!)&nbsp;
When we returned we learned that Uncle Wayne had died, around the week
we were in Ireland!&nbsp; We had missed his funeral and I hadn't gotten
the chance to say goodbye.&nbsp; A few days after we got back.&nbsp; I
was sitting on the couch reading the newspaper, my grandmother was sitting
five feet away and my mom was maybe 15 feet away sitting at the table.&nbsp;
All of a sudden I smelled, very strongly, his cigar smoke! I asked mom
and Grandma if they smelled it and they both said no. I said "I love you
Uncle Wayne, goodbye!"&nbsp; Mom thought I was being silly, but I'm glad
I said it!</b>

<p><b>Personal Experiences 2</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Steven_Harrison@pancanadian.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Further to my last letter, on that same vacation in the summer of
1972,</b>
<br><b>we travelled across Canada to Ontario, then returned through the</b>
<br><b>northern states, ending up on the west coast of Canada before returning</b>
<br><b>to our home in the British Columbia Southern Interior.&nbsp; The
next strange</b>
<br><b>event that happened after the Ontario incident was at a historic
site in</b>
<br><b>the western U.S.&nbsp; It was either Wall, South Dakota or Little
Bighorn,</b>
<br><b>Montana, the site of Custer's Last Stand.&nbsp; The location sticks
in my</b>
<br><b>mind as being the latter.&nbsp; The interpretive centre had a display
of a</b>
<br><b>telegraph office, complete with a figure seated at the telegraph
key.</b>
<br><b>Being kids (14and 12) my sister and I just had to play with the
exhibit</b>
<br><b>and began tapping out a message on the telegraph key, pretending
we knew</b>
<br><b>morse code.&nbsp; When we stopped and started to go on to other
amusements,</b>
<br><b>the telegraph key tapped out a message in return.&nbsp; We thought
that was</b>
<br><b>pretty cool, so we went to find the caretaker and asked him what
the</b>
<br><b>telegraph was hooked up to.&nbsp; He told us it wasn't hooked up
to anything;</b>
<br><b>it was just an exhibit.&nbsp; When we told him it tapped out a message,
he</b>
<br><b>said that was impossible and showed us telegraph display as it looked
on</b>
<br><b>the side we couldn't reach.&nbsp; There was nowhere a person could
have</b>
<br><b>hidden and not been seen.&nbsp; The telegraph wasn't hooked up to
anything at</b>
<br><b>all.&nbsp; There were no wires connected to key and there was certainly
no</b>
<br><b>way a message could have been received let alone sent.&nbsp; To
this day I</b>
<br><b>wonder what the message was and who was trying to contact us.</b>
<br><b>A much better incident was waiting for us further on when we reached
the</b>
<br><b>coast.</b>

<p><b>Paranormal Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jbelisl@banet.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This story isn't exactly a ghost story. I can't identify what happened</b>
<br><b>or what they were as typical ghost experiences. Both of the experiences</b>
<br><b>below are true to the best of my perception. And BTW I had other
similar</b>
<br><b>experiences that I just can't remember right now.&nbsp; Anyway here
they are.</b><b></b>
<p><b>About two years ago during the summertime I came awake in the early
a.m.</b>
<br><b>hours. I woke up in a slow way that is like being drawn out of sleep.
As</b>
<br><b>I was waking and realizing that I was waking up I sensed something</b>
<br><b>approaching my house. It was a feeling like you just know it is
there.</b>
<br><b>It was approaching my house from due west in a perfect line at a
pretty</b>
<br><b>good rate of speed. I have no idea what it was, I just could feel
its</b>
<br><b>movement and trajectory. In about a second or two it reached my
house</b>
<br><b>and slammed into the siding like a 50 pound sack of potatoes. It
was</b>
<br><b>loud. The house shook. Now my bedroom is on the third floor in a
room</b>
<br><b>converted from an attic. My windows are a good thirty feet above
the</b>
<br><b>ground. Nothing heavy&nbsp; could possibly reach the section of
outside wall</b>
<br><b>that this thing hit without the aid of heavy equipment. I got up
and</b>
<br><b>checked the siding to see if something did hit it. Nothing. The
vinyl</b>
<br><b>siding looked unaltered in anyway. I questioned my roommates at
the time</b>
<br><b>to see if they heard or felt anything. They were both asleep and</b>
<br><b>experienced nothing.</b>
<br><b>As soon as it hit the house the sense of it being there disappeared.</b>
<br><b>Like it just traveled a great distance in a perfect line, hit my
house</b>
<br><b>and then just vaporized. I don't have any impression of what it
was. I</b>
<br><b>only felt something moving through the ether.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The second instance was a little more up close and was visual. This</b>
<br><b>happened last fall if I remember correctly. This time it was in
the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night. I don't remember checking the time. About 1
or 2</b>
<br><b>am.&nbsp; Again like last time I awoke from sleep in a slow drawing
kind of</b>
<br><b>way. Like your mind making you wake up due to some outside stimulus</b>
<br><b>needing&nbsp; your attention. This time as I was first coming to
waking</b>
<br><b>awareness I sensed something on the ceiling. Just as I realized
this I</b>
<br><b>looked up with sleep ladened eyes and say a small dark shape about
the</b>
<br><b>size of a mouse drop from the ceiling. I have a textured sprayed</b>
<br><b>ceiling. The kind that crumbles to dust if you touch it with anything.</b>
<br><b>Anything larger than a insect has no hope of maintaining a grip
on it.</b>
<br><b>And besides why would a mouse want to travel on my ceiling? This
thing</b>
<br><b>fell from the ceiling in a straight line just like the law of gravity</b>
<br><b>imposes on everything. It hit my bed and bounced off it onto the
floor</b>
<br><b>and then scrambled behind my two panel, folding door that goes to
my</b>
<br><b>bathroom. The proof that I wasn't imagining it comes from one of
my cats</b>
<br><b>who sleeps on my bed every night. He tore off after whatever it
was. But</b>
<br><b>as soon as it went behind the door it dissappeared. There is a large</b>
<br><b>bookcase right next to where that door folds up. The only exit from</b>
<br><b>behind that door is to continue into the bathroom throught the crack</b>
<br><b>created by the door when it is folded or back out the way it went
in. I</b>
<br><b>watched it go behind the door but I didn't see it go into the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>>From my bed I have a perfect view of that part of the door. If
it went</b>
<br><b>in there I would have saw it. My cat was right behind it when it
went</b>
<br><b>behind the door.&nbsp; But as soon as he reached the door he suddenly</b>
<br><b>stopped. And he stared for a second at where the thing went and
then he</b>
<br><b>started looking around. Like he followed it and he suddenly lost
it and</b>
<br><b>couldn't find it. This thing just dissappeared.</b>
<br><b>I have no clue as to what either of these things were. Nor any sort
of</b>
<br><b>proof other than witnessing them.</b>
<br><b>If anyone has any info. as to what these things could possibly be,</b>
<br><b>please e-mail me. Thanks.</b>

<p><b>Perceptive To the Paranormal</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Amanda D.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My story is actually a few experiences I've had I don't know if I'm</b>
<br><b>perceptive to paranormal activity or not however I do believe some
people</b>
<br><b>attract strange phenomenon. The earliest incident that I can remember</b>
<br><b>happened to me when I was about 6 or 7 we moved to a new state and
strange</b>
<br><b>things began to happen. One of which happened every night at about
8:30 a</b>
<br><b>strange puff of white would pop up at the end of my bed then slowly
make its</b>
<br><b>way down the right edge of my bed about half way down it would stop
then wait</b>
<br><b>about a few seconds then go back down to the edge of my bed and
disappear. I</b>
<br><b>must admit that at this time my family had a little and puffy haired
poodle,</b>
<br><b>however I ruled him out because of three things. One our dog was
VERY short</b>
<br><b>and wouldn't be able to reach the edge of my bed, two he was very
old and his</b>
<br><b>fur had taken on a yellowish tint and the puff I saw reflected the
light from</b>
<br><b>the hallway and was pure white, thirdly I watched my doorway until
8:30 when</b>
<br><b>it would appear and nothing would go in or come out. The next thing
to happen</b>
<br><b>to me scared me beyond belief. I had I tree in my backyard that
I would spend</b>
<br><b>A LOT of my free time in even at night. One night I was in the tree
when I</b>
<br><b>felt something watching me when I looked around at first I saw nothing
then I</b>
<br><b>saw near my fence two little red glowing dots. I totally freaked
and ran into</b>
<br><b>my house. Fortunately for me we were only renting that house until
we found a</b>
<br><b>permanent home (where I reside now). The next experience I can remember</b>
<br><b>happened years later after we moved. I was at my friend's house
when my</b>
<br><b>parents and her parents went out to dinner. I was about 13 now and
we decided</b>
<br><b>to go up on the roof and watch the stars. We (me, my friend and
her little</b>
<br><b>brother) started up I climbed up first. I climbed up the tree and
sat on the</b>
<br><b>roof. Then I said something (I don't remember what) that made my
friend</b>
<br><b>really mad so she went inside. Her little brother stayed out with
me. As he</b>
<br><b>headed up I heard something behind me I turned to see three people
headed</b>
<br><b>towards me. At first I thought they were intruders coming to attack
me. I</b>
<br><b>jumped up to prepare to run when I noticed that I could see the
stars though</b>
<br><b>their bodies. I froze and they stopped. I shouted down to my friends
brother</b>
<br><b>what was going on and I told him to get his sister. She told him
she didn't</b>
<br><b>believe me but I was stuck I couldn't get down and needed help.
Apparently</b>
<br><b>she heard voices inside the house which clinched it and she came
for me.</b>
<br><b>However in the mean time Ii decided to make a jump for the closest
branch. I</b>
<br><b>made it down and we all ran into the house. She has told me that
other</b>
<br><b>strange things have happened there too. The last incident I'll share
happened</b>
<br><b>about a year or two ago. Earlier I had a friend who had the exact
same</b>
<br><b>birthday (and time) as me. We were good friends but her dad kinda
creeped me</b>
<br><b>out he wasn't mean as a matter of fact I hardly ever saw him. He
just gave me</b>
<br><b>chills when I did see him. Her family eventually moved to a different
state.</b>
<br><b>A while after she moved I had a dream with her in it she didn't
do anything</b>
<br><b>just stood there. I didn't give it any further thought. Until I
saw on t.v. a</b>
<br><b>few years later that a man had murdered his wife and hidden the
body. The man</b>
<br><b>was my friends father and the murder took place around the same
week that I</b>
<br><b>saw her in my dream. I have had a few other strange things happen
but not</b>
<br><b>many fortunately those are the biggest. I haven't had many sightings
for</b>
<br><b>quite some time and I'm enjoying the silence. Sorry for this being
so</b>
<br><b>long. Thanx for listining</b>

<p><b>Invisible Eyes</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: btk_99@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've only had something like this happen to me once, but in this
case, once</b>
<br><b>was more than enough. I was probably about 17 or 18 (this was about
12 years ago)and was asked by my dad to come with him to where he worked
to go through some old magazines that they were going to be throwing out
to make room. He knew I had an</b>
<br><b>interest in these, and said that any I found interesting I could
pull out</b>
<br><b>and take home. They were old National Geographics, Lifes, Times,
etc. mostly</b>
<br><b>from the 60s &amp; 70s. My dad worked (works) as a maintenance manager
at a large church in Oak Park, Illinois, a southern suburb of Chicago.
It's old for suburban</b>
<br><b>standards, originally built right after the Civil War, in 1866.
That first</b>
<br><b>one burnt to the foundation after being hit by lightning in 1916
and was</b>
<br><b>rebuilt that year in stone, in an imposing Romanesque style.</b>
<br><b>The room that the box of magazines I was looking at was under the
front</b>
<br><b>entry hall of the church, down twin sets of stairs. Originally,
it was a</b>
<br><b>lounge/restroom area, separated by a hall with mirrors, benches
set against</b>
<br><b>the walls, and a door leading into the basement, framed by a pair
of wooden</b>
<br><b>pillars salvaged from the old church. I was in what had been the
men's</b>
<br><b>lounge, and they hadn't been used since new restrooms were built
upstairs in</b>
<br><b>the mid 60s. They had been used for storage since, but were being
cleaned</b>
<br><b>out in preparation for rebuilding the whole area as Sunday school</b>
<br><b>classrooms. My dad &amp; I had gotten to the church early on a Saturday
morning, about 7 AM,&nbsp; and at that point were the only two people in
the whole building. He went</b>
<br><b>about his work, and said he'd come back down in a couple hours when
we were</b>
<br><b>leaving. The room was lit by a single bulb overhead, and there was
also a dingy</b>
<br><b>leaded glass window near the ceiling which didn't let in much light.
However</b>
<br><b>gloomy and ramshackle the room was, I was really into the old magazines,
and</b>
<br><b>had pulled out a few already when I realized that someone was in
the</b>
<br><b>doorframe behind me watching me. (There was no door)</b>
<br><b>I was sitting with my back towards the doorway, on a folding chair
with the</b>
<br><b>big box on the floor next to me. I figured my dad had come down
early, since</b>
<br><b>only about half an hour or 45 minutes had gone by since he left.
I turned to</b>
<br><b>speak to him, but no one was there. I got up and walked out into
the hall,</b>
<br><b>and called for him, but no reply. I went into the old women's lounge-empty.</b>
<br><b>I dashed upstairs and walked around the church and called for him,
but only</b>
<br><b>got my voice echoing back in the stillness.</b>
<br><b>I just shrugged it off to my imagination, and went back down to
the room. As</b>
<br><b>I walked in, I realized that although 2 minutes ago, it was sort
of warm and</b>
<br><b>stale in there, now it was chilly, like air conditioning blasting
cold</b>
<br><b>chilly, although there was no air conditioning in this part of the
building.</b>
<br><b>I also noticed two things that disturbed me even more than the sudden</b>
<br><b>coldness-first, I felt that I was being watched, from a couple directions,</b>
<br><b>behind me and somehow, from behind a stack of boxes piled up in
front of a</b>
<br><b>door which once led to the actual washroom, which had been long
since locked</b>
<br><b>up and unused.&nbsp; Also, I didn't notice it right away, but as
soon as I did,</b>
<br><b>that was what caused me to get out of that room immediately, but
the</b>
<br><b>lightbulb above my head was growing slowly dimmer and dimmer, as
I watched</b>
<br><b>it. I turned and ran, and kept running til I got out of the church
itself and</b>
<br><b>into the offices which were attached to the church, where I almost
literally</b>
<br><b>ran into my dad coming in from outside. I asked if he'd been down
to check</b>
<br><b>on me, and he told me that almost the whole time since he left me,
he'd been</b>
<br><b>doing some work in the parking lot out in back of the office portion
of the</b>
<br><b>building. He asked if I was okay, and I lied and said sure, but
I was done</b>
<br><b>down there, and didn't really find anything and would just hang
out with him</b>
<br><b>til we left. I've been back down there once since, a few years back,
with my dad, and the</b>
<br><b>area is totally transformed-cheerily painted, modernized, and well-lit,</b>
<br><b>almost unrecognizable from what it once looked like before the remodeling</b>
<br><b>project. However, just to be safe, I still don't think I'd feel
comfortable</b>
<br><b>ever going down there alone again to this day.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>First off I am a 17 teen year old and am a nursing assistant. I work
at a</b>
<br><b>nursing home in Minnesota. Here is my story. This happened about
3 weeks ago</b>
<br><b>so here it goes.</b>
<br><b>A man died he was in his later 70's and they found him sitting up
in bed when</b>
<br><b>he was dead. So that night I went to work (I work eves) and people
had told</b>
<br><b>me that weird things happened I am was like what? The nurse and
TMA told me</b>
<br><b>that the call light in this guys room would go on and off when no
one was in</b>
<br><b>the room! i was like oh yeah right! i stayed til about 10 to do
rounds and</b>
<br><b>nothing had happened 2 days later: I had to work and they told me
more things</b>
<br><b>had happened so i stayed again until 9:45 but then they asked me
to stay</b>
<br><b>later so i said OK. i was next door to the guys room and me at two
other aids</b>
<br><b>came out and saw that the call light was on. we all were like oh
no! so we</b>
<br><b>all went in there and we saw the bed rise up and the head of the
bed go up</b>
<br><b>all by it self! i was so scared you should have seen me run! now
there is a</b>
<br><b>lady in his room and she requested to be moved because the lights
kept going</b>
<br><b>on and off. now the room is empty but there is a big temperature
difference.</b>
<br><b>It is cold in his room and warm everywhere else.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Voice</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: fsmith@helicon.net:</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is my ghost story.</b>
<br><b>I almost feel the need to apologize because it is not as ghostly
as others' submissions.</b>
<br><b>Here it is. My family moved into an old Victorian-type house in
a small town in southwestern Pennsylvania years ago.</b>
<br><b>Although it is quite beautiful, it obviously has not been kept up
as it should.</b>
<br><b>My bedroom was the largest, because my parents wanted the one bedroom
that had a bath attached. Despite living in what is to some a dream home,
I always felt "small" in that house. I don't know how to describe the feeling,
but I wasn't very comfortable there.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, one day, as I was in my room reading or working, I heard
a male voice say "what." When this happened, I was alone in the upstairs
part of the house.</b>
<br><b>My bedroom door was open and at the sound, I whipped my head around.</b>
<br><b>It had came from down the hall. My bedroom is located to the right
at the top of the stairs. There is a bathroom directly across from the
stairs, a bedroom next to that and a hallway across from my door that leads
to&nbsp; closets, a third bedroom, and a small room.</b>
<br><b>There is also a second stairway down that hall. Now, I didn't see
anything, but I am convinced that the voice did not come from anyone who
lived in the house.</b>
<br><b>My father was the only male in the household and the voice was not
his.</b>
<br><b>It's been years since this happening, but I still think on it and
wonder about the history of that house. I believe that the builders and
former owners of the house were wealthy and connected to the coal industry
that thrives in that part of the state.</b>
<br><b>In fact, a coal mine is in clear view from the back porch.</b>
<br><b>Well, that's it.</b>
<br><b>If someone knows about ghostly voices and sounds, please contact
me.</b>
<br><b>As years pass, sometimes I wonder if it was just a dream.</b>

<p><b>Roosevelt Island &amp; something else</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JayZ99312@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm 15, when I was in 3rd grade I think, I went with one or two friends
to</b>
<br><b>Roosevelt Island (Its nearby since I live in NYC), and everyone
knows that</b>
<br><b>there is a house there nobody is allowed into. It even has alarms
on the</b>
<br><b>doors. There's&nbsp; a black cat who wonders around the house (who
can't possibily</b>
<br><b>be a ghost, it doesn't even look like one, its too, well, Live),
and if you</b>
<br><b>go onto the porch there's a smell of corpses coming from under the
porch.</b>
<br><b>So we took some pictures of us by the house and of the house alone,
and when</b>
<br><b>looking back on the pictures sometime later, in the pic of the back
part of</b>
<br><b>the house I think, there was a weird looking figure staring through
the</b>
<br><b>door's window. The figure, I thought this was pretty messed up,
looked like.... a robot ? I</b>
<br><b>don't know for sure, but it was grey and had a square head, and
that's all I</b>
<br><b>saw was the figure's head and face features. I still have the picture
and its</b>
<br><b>still there in the pic. It's barely visibile but you can quite make
out that</b>
<br><b>something is looking through that window. Here's something else....
I don't</b>
<br><b>know if this was just my imagination or actually real... During
5th grade (in NYC</b>
<br><b>at a school called P.S. 59), I knew an african american kid (won't
say his name,</b>
<br><b>just call him "K") whose mother worked at the school by helping
out with boxes,</b>
<br><b>etc. Anyway my class and I were going back to our room and we passed
by the the yard's enterance (this</b>
<br><b>was on the 2nd floor) to the right of the hall, and I saw K's mom
organizing</b>
<br><b>some boxes and as she got up from putting a box down I was looking
at her and</b>
<br><b>she looked up at me and she had a mean face and had fangs in her
mouth. I was</b>
<br><b>freaked out. She wasn't a ghost or anything, but I don't know what
the hell</b>
<br><b>happened there. She may have yelled at me a few times for causing
some trouble but other times she was nice.</b>

<p><b>Spandau Prison</b><b></b>

<p><b>THE SPANDAU GHOST</b><b></b>
<p><b>My brother told me this story a couple of years ago about an incident
that</b>
<br><b>took place in 1985 in West Berlin, as it was then, when he served
there in</b>
<br><b>the British Army.</b>
<br><b>Picture the scene; Spandau Prison a cold eerie place with only prisoner</b>
<br><b>(Rudolph Hess) but with many brutal stories in its' Nazi past. My
brother,</b>
<br><b>Peter, was officer commanding the guard on that particular extremely
cold</b>
<br><b>winters night. He had a platoon of men scattered around the building
where</b>
<br><b>he himself admitted you didn't feel comfortable on your own unless
you were</b>
<br><b>armed.</b>
<br><b>The guard was rotated monthly......British, American, French and
so on.</b>
<br><b>There were a series of guard towers which were semi enclosed and
he had one</b>
<br><b>man in each of these. Suddenly several shots were fired in one of
these</b>
<br><b>towers. Peter and the platoon sergeant went to investigate and found
one of</b>
<br><b>the men, a big guy not normally afraid of anything with his rifle
in hand</b>
<br><b>and tears running down his face. This could be a serious incident.
If you</b>
<br><b>fire your weapon with live rounds negligently, you are in serious</b>
<br><b>trouble....</b>
<br><b>The soldier didn't speak for a while but eventually started to talk.
He'd</b>
<br><b>been keeping watch when he felt a presence behind him. He turned
to see a</b>
<br><b>soldier staring at him. He challenged the man twice and then fired
3 shots</b>
<br><b>at him, as laid down in standing orders. The soldier disappeared
into thin</b>
<br><b>air.</b>
<br><b>Our man wasn't believed until a few days later it emerged that a
French</b>
<br><b>soldier had committed suicide in that same guard post a month or
two</b>
<br><b>earlier. The incident was scrubbed from the records and our man
returned to</b>

<br><b>The Guy in the Basement (addendum)</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hortuskp@email.msn.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Had visitors staying in the servant's quarters over the 4th of July.&nbsp;
They were kept awake all night by knocking on the wall&nbsp; coming from
the area of the ironing board.&nbsp; They also described an orb that remained
stationary on the bedroom door all night.&nbsp; Both are sensitive.&nbsp;
They spent quite a while looking for anything that could have caused a
reflection, to account for the orb and came up blank.&nbsp; They described
it as "greenish black" and remaining absolutely still, all night.&nbsp;
The woman said she would look at it and think "I'll close my eyes and see
if it's still there when I open them".&nbsp; Said she'd go to sleep and
wake up to knocking on the wall, and the orb was still there.&nbsp; All
night, no sleep.&nbsp; They complained of a myriad of other noises as well,
thumps, bumps, etc.&nbsp; Another curious thing, my housekeeper said that
it looked like the amoeba shaped thing she saw was "sort of coming out"
of</b>
<br><b>the ironing board cabinet" and my houseguest describes the orb as
looking like it was "almost inside" the door. A note about that room.&nbsp;
It is the cat's favorite room.&nbsp; It has a large window which overlooks
one of the rose gardens.&nbsp; It's very light and the energy is fresh
and cheerful.And about me: If I don't keep the doors closed, I am continually
shooing birds, bees, dragonflies, lizards, skunks, possums, coyote's and
anything else out of my house, no matter where I live.&nbsp; Wild things
will walk right up and stand and look at me as if they expect something.&nbsp;
One night I woke up with a huge boar skunk curled up on the bed with me.&nbsp;
Another time one walked into the living room, jumped up on the sofa and
washed her face, then sat there looking at me like she was waiting for
conversation, so I talked to her.&nbsp; Hummingbirds follow me around (inside)
the house while I go about my business.&nbsp; If I sit down, they sit down.&nbsp;
Very companionable.&nbsp; If anyone else comes in they fly at them, bellowing.&nbsp;
One day I had a man calibrating my oven.&nbsp; He came in the living room
and said "Theres a hummingbird in the kitchen giving me H___."&nbsp; I
told him he was just making sure he did his job right. Dragonflies light
on me and won't get off.&nbsp; Lizards climb on me and take a nap, opening
their eyes every once in a while then going back to their snooze.&nbsp;
Strange dogs never take offense at my presence, even the ones who have
been trained to keep people away, and totally strange dogs will protect
me.&nbsp; Animals are always extremely posessive about me and devoted to
a degree that can be really disturbing (I've had them hurt themselves badly
trying to go with me or get to me, or starve themselves because I was not
there, even though another family member was).&nbsp; I wonder if it's the
same energy that the spirit's recognize.&nbsp; That's too discomforting,
I think I'll just leave that one alone.This place is known for things that
go CRASH!!!!, but there's never anything overturned or broken.&nbsp; This
happens during both day and night time hours.&nbsp; My housekeeper and
I are forever hurrying toward a loud crashing noise, meeting in the middle
of the house, looking blankly at each other and saying "they're at it again!".&nbsp;
The issue with the orb is that this is the second ever sighting, both on
the same wall, in exactly the same area (within a meter), both by women,
and both within 10 days.&nbsp; My guest says that the orb is not the same
entity as the guy with the icky energy. Also, we have info that leads us
to think that there's a very old well or cistern at/near the location of
the bad energy.&nbsp; Someone has has caused a concrete box to be built
over it.&nbsp; Fifteen feet from it, in the garage is (also cemented up)&nbsp;
what appears to be an oven, or smithy's forge.&nbsp; That would follow,
this is a California Spanish house and there's lots of&nbsp; wrought iron.&nbsp;
The place was built by mexican artisans who lived in a tent city on the
property during construction.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; I've made inquiries
about renting ultrasound equiptment in an attempt to see what's inside
and under these things before (if) we do anything physical.&nbsp; Will
also check with the Historical society before proceeding as something in
their files may save me the effort.&nbsp; This house was built before folks
used blueprints.</b>

<br><b>Dover Castle, Kent, England. August 1995.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MIKEY@cail.freeserve.co.uk</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In August of 1995, my family were visiting Dover Castle, a vast sprawling</b>
<br><b>structure on the White Cliffs.&nbsp; The underground tunnels date
to Napoleonic</b>
<br><b>times and D-Day was planned down there.</b>
<br><b>During the tour of Hellfire Corner the group visited the Repeater
Station, a</b>
<br><b>telecommunications room.&nbsp; The room is very spooky, and is not
somewhere I</b>
<br><b>would like to spend a lot of time.</b>
<br><b>The tour guide was describing the main functions of the Repeater
Station.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>happened to glance at the ceiling of the tunnel, when a strange
breeze blew</b>
<br><b>down the middle of the room.&nbsp; It caused the hairs on my left
arm to rise,</b>
<br><b>but the hairs on my right arm remained normal.</b>
<br><b>Later in a small pub near the castle, I related the experience to
my family.</b>
<br><b>My auntie said that she too had felt a strange breeze in the room,
but she</b>
<br><b>also claimed to have heard footsteps retreating very quickly out
of the</b>

<p><b>Haunted House on Magazine Street in New Orleans</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: karma104@juno.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was between eleven and thirteen years old my family moved
into a</b>
<br><b>house on Magazine Street, in an old part of New Orleans, Louisiana.
It</b>
<br><b>was a house that had been converted into a 4-plex, we occupied the
entire</b>
<br><b>upstairs, even the long narrow stairs leading upstairs to the apartment</b>
<br><b>were scary to me when I use to come home from school and noone else
had</b>
<br><b>made it home yet. (I just remembered this.) When we first moved
in, I</b>
<br><b>didn't have a bed yet and use to sleep on the hardwood floor in
my room,</b>
<br><b>which was in the very back of the house( the house was set up like
a</b>
<br><b>shutgun, if you are familiar with that term, alot of old houses
in New</b>
<br><b>Orleans are set up this way, with the servants/slave quarters in
the back</b>
<br><b>of the house.) After a week, my mom purchased a second hand wooden
bed for me. (This is revelant you will see, because even though the place
was eerie before</b>
<br><b>this, the happening didn't take place until the bed.)&nbsp; It started
with me</b>
<br><b>getting woken up in the middle of the night, always, about 3:15am,
there</b>
<br><b>would be noone visible in the room. It then progressed to me being
woken</b>
<br><b>up by gentle shaking of the bed, and it would stop after I sat up.
This</b>
<br><b>would go on for about two months, never every night but always at
around</b>
<br><b>3:00am in the morning. The moving, shaking was visible in the bed
posts,</b>
<br><b>just like someone was shaking it, when I touched the bed footboard
it</b>
<br><b>felt like something moving through it and I would be afraid but
almost to</b>
<br><b>scared to move.( I would leave my room, wake my mom up, she did
not</b>
<br><b>believe me and thought I was having nightmares.) The very last time
it</b>
<br><b>happened was more violent, I was woken up by the bed shaking hard
and</b>
<br><b>this time I touched the bedposts,&nbsp; the shaking would not stop,
I jumped</b>
<br><b>out of the bed and it appeared to manifest itself into the TV antenna</b>
<br><b>ears on top of my television, looking like a neon blue liquid flowing</b>
<br><b>between the ears, ( the color of blue lightning with no sound.)
and the</b>
<br><b>antenna ears were moving up and down, floating in the air off the
TV to</b>
<br><b>the floor and back. (All this with no sound, totally silent.) You
might</b>
<br><b>think I would have ran screaming down the hall to my mom's bedroom
but I</b>
<br><b>couldn't move, it was so unbelievable!!!, I just stood there until
it</b>
<br><b>stopped.) Whatever it was tried to shake me awake one more time
a few weeks later,</b>
<br><b>I was very scared and I read somewhere that a spirit would have
to reveal</b>
<br><b>itself to you or go away when confronted with the question,"In the
name</b>
<br><b>of Jesus, you must tell me who you are or go away?". It worked because
it</b>
<br><b>stopped and never came back again. I don't know if it was evil or</b>
<br><b>harmless but I really didn't want to find out.</b>

<br><b>I didn't believe in Ghosts until</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DHorton42@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My ghost experiences started when I was about
12 years old. My Father and</b>
<br><b>Mother purchased an old house in a small town in Kentucky. The house
was over</b>
<br><b>one hundred years old, built from old yellow popular boards and
was heated</b>
<br><b>with a coal stove. The house had one electric wire that ran on the
outside of</b>
<br><b>the boards, from the only outlet in the kitchen, then through the
rest of the</b>
<br><b>house were each room had one light switch and fixture.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we moved into the house I began to have
dreams about a beautiful</b>
<br><b>young woman that I had never seen before. In each dream I was at
a small</b>
<br><b>church funeral. When I first began to have the dreams, we had just
moved into</b>
<br><b>town, and I knew nothing about it. After several months of the reoccurring</b>
<br><b>dream I knew were the old church was located just a few streets
over from</b>
<br><b>were we lived. The church was no longer there, but when I began
to ask</b>
<br><b>around, I was told that it had been turned into a house many years
ago.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In each dream I am walking down the isle, towards
the casket that is</b>
<br><b>surrounded by flowers. There are people that I don't know sitting
on each</b>
<br><b>side of me.&nbsp; Once I get to the casket I am looking down at
a very young</b>
<br><b>attractive lady, that is dressed in white and who has black hair,
then I wake</b>
<br><b>up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first couple of times, I just shook the dream off
as a nightmare.</b>
<br><b>However after having the same dream for several weeks I became afraid
to</b>
<br><b>sleep in my room. I tried to express my feelings to my parents about
the</b>
<br><b>dream and My Father laughed and made me feel foolish and my Mother
keep</b>
<br><b>saying it is just a dream. I was very embarrassed, after all I was
12 years</b>
<br><b>old and someone my age shouldn't be afraid to sleep in their bed.
So I</b>
<br><b>stopped telling them about the dreams even though I was having them
night</b>
<br><b>after night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then something freaky happened. My Father began to
remodel the house and</b>
<br><b>the dream changed. It wasn't about her funeral any more it was about
my</b>
<br><b>father tearing out some old closets that ran all along one wall
of my room.</b>
<br><b>The closets consisted of tall doors that were about two foot wide
each having</b>
<br><b>a smaller one above it for storing blankets, I suppose. One of the
closets</b>
<br><b>was used to store wood and coal for burning in the stove that set
in front of</b>
<br><b>it. In my dream my mother is standing with her arm around my shoulder
and</b>
<br><b>we're watching my Father tear out the closets, when suddenly the
body of the</b>
<br><b>woman (that I had been dreaming about) comes falling out into the
floor in</b>
<br><b>front of us. The dream scared me so badly that I began to panic
when I found</b>
<br><b>out that my Father actually was going to tear the old closets out.
My Father</b>
<br><b>had never mentioned it to me prior to having the dream.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't stand it any longer so I told my Mother
everything. She</b>
<br><b>reassured me that there was nothing to be scared of and walked into
the room</b>
<br><b>with me. As we are standing there she slips her arm around my shoulder
and we</b>
<br><b>are standing there watching my father tear out the closets just
like in my</b>
<br><b>dream. My Mother had never put her arm around my shoulder before
and I never</b>
<br><b>told her that she had done this in my dream. At that thought I was
so scared</b>
<br><b>I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. I just knew that this
woman's</b>
<br><b>body was in the closet and was going to fall out into the floor
in front of</b>
<br><b>us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember being so very glad the next morning when
I awoke knowing that</b>
<br><b>there was no body in the closet and that the dreams were over. However,
that</b>
<br><b>was the beginning of things, not the end.&nbsp; My bed began to
rock at night as I</b>
<br><b>would try to go to sleep. Doors would open and close, lights would
go on and</b>
<br><b>off, objects occasionally moved through the air, we heard an organ
playing</b>
<br><b>and singing, and people walking around at night, ect.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; After that night I felt like my Mother was open to
my fears and I began to</b>
<br><b>tell her everything. She moved my bedroom into another room and
the bed</b>
<br><b>actually stopped rocking and I was able to sleep peacefully from
there</b>
<br><b>onward. She still didn't quite believe the things that I was saying,
she just</b>
<br><b>keep saying that it was my imagination.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one day my Mother suddenly became interested in
my dreams, she began</b>
<br><b>to ask questions such as; What did the woman look like? I knew by
the way</b>
<br><b>that she was acting that something had happened, then she told me
that she</b>
<br><b>was walking down the hallway towards the kitchen and she saw a woman
standing</b>
<br><b>in the hallway. She described her as being young and beautiful,
dressed in</b>
<br><b>white and having black hair. What she saw looked like a real person
and she</b>
<br><b>thought that someone had walked into the house through the kitchen
door, and</b>
<br><b>she asked her, "What do you want and what are you doing in my house?"
The</b>
<br><b>woman moved her mouth as if she was answering her, but no words
were heard.</b>
<br><b>Then she simply vanished.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman was seen in the house on several occasions.
I saw her myself one</b>
<br><b>time walking down the hallway, and it was just like Mother said,
she looked</b>
<br><b>real. She wasn't transparent, an orb or mist but looked as real
as you and I.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; We later found out that the woman that the house was
built for, had died</b>
<br><b>one winter giving birth. It was said that her husband had gone away
and that</b>
<br><b>she may have went into labor getting wood for the fire. Her and
the baby were</b>
<br><b>found in the closet. It was also speculated that she was trying
to keep the</b>
<br><b>baby warm. She was described as being 23 years old, having black
hair and</b>
<br><b>green eyes.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also I thought that you might be interest in
knowing, that before her</b>
<br><b>ghost was seen in the house, my father had rewired the house himself.
The</b>
<br><b>electric bills were very high, one month it was about $350. He knew
then that</b>
<br><b>he had done something wrong and called an electrician to check it
out. It was</b>
<br><b>found that he was running electricity into the soil beneath the
house.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>far as I know she has never been seen again since the electrical
problem was</b>
<br><b>corrected. This may have nothing to do with the sightings at all.
However,</b>
<br><b>then again who knows? Maybe it should be investigated further.</b>

<p><b>Even up to a month ago,I would have said people who tell ghost stories
were nuts.Not any more.My wife and I kept having odd experiences and so
we brought a psychic to our house and she told us a person had died here
and that he died of drugs.&nbsp; She held her throat and said it was something
to do with drugs and that this person made the drugs in this house.She
said something was on our property that meant something to this person.When
we had moved in we noticed that there were 2 holes that had been dug in
our back yard but had been covered and I passed them over as septic tank
holes.After I thought about what she had said I had my wife dig up the
holes and low and behold we found things that were used to make methamphetamine.Very
scary wouldn't you say.But not near as scary as watching one of my dogs
sit in my kitchen and follow what you would think as someone walking from
behind her and her following it as it walked all the way around her.This
is just a few examples but I have to go as it is late and I just happened
to come across your web site.If you would like I will write back with some

<p><b>Haunted Furniture</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: wmazur@rocketmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 14, my sister (who is 6 years older) was still living</b>
<br><b>at home, and bought a beautiful 5 piece bedroom suite from an estate</b>
<br><b>sale. I used to sneak into her room in the morning after she'd leave
for</b>
<br><b>work, to wear something of hers to school, but with this new furniture</b>
<br><b>in the room, I felt an eerieness, and the temperature of the room
felt</b>
<br><b>distinctly cooler than usual. After a couple of months, this eerie</b>
<br><b>feeling and room temperature seemed to return to normal. It wasn't
until</b>
<br><b>a couple of years later, my Mom &amp; sister spoke about the furniture,
and</b>
<br><b>how after my sister bought it , she would wake up suddenly in the
middle</b>
<br><b>of the night, feeling as though someone was sitting on the edge
of the</b>
<br><b>bed, leaning over her and staring at her. She actually felt the
weight</b>
<br><b>of this being making an indentation beside her, and felt they were</b>
<br><b>supporting themselves over her with one arm on the other side of
her</b>
<br><b>body. My sister usually slept very soundly. One night, after a number
of</b>
<br><b>these mid-night wakenings, she saw, hovering over the night table,
the</b>
<br><b>face of an elderly woman, staring at her. Needless to say she was
VERY</b>
<br><b>freaked out and pulled the covers over her head and eventually fell</b>
<br><b>asleep. After that time, the night wakenings ceased and she felt</b>
<br><b>everything was back to normal. They never told me because I scared</b>
<br><b>easily, even though I loved ghost stories, but I think my Mom didn't</b>
<br><b>want me waking her up in the middle of the night because I was scared!</b>
<br><b>When my sister moved out of the house, we found an old slip for</b>
<br><b>reclaiming jewelry, with the name Phoebe Zieffert.</b>
<br><b>I believe the elderly woman that had the furniture had some special</b>
<br><b>attachment to it and hung around after she died to assess the new
owner</b>
<br><b>in hopes it would be loved and cared for as she had. My sister still
has</b>
<br><b>this set today.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Apartment in L.A.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; jgodinez@aracnet.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello!&nbsp; From 92 until 94 my husband and I and our roommate Eric
lived in a haunted apartment in L.A. It was built in the 50's or 60's our
apartment was on the third floor there was only one other apartment on
that floor (very large apartments) and our neighbor was an elderly woman
named Ruth.&nbsp; There was a swimming pool in the front courtyard.&nbsp;
For some reason everytime anyone looked at the swimming pool that person's
eyes were always drawn to the deep end of the pool and on more than one
occassion we had people ask if anyone ever drowned in the pool. We had
no idea but I suspect so.&nbsp; Anyway our apartment was a hotbed of activity.
Our bathroom and our bedroom seemed to have the most activity.&nbsp; Everytime
I had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night I would always say
out loud "I'm not going to see anything" and then I would open our bedroom
door to go down the hall to the bathroom.&nbsp; Every single time I opened
that door I wouldn't see anything but I would feel something standing there
looking at me (Very unnerving!)&nbsp; Then I would go to the bathroom but
was always afraid to look into the mirror at night.&nbsp; Our bathroom
window had a screen that was filthy except for a perfect clean handprint
right in the middle of the screen.&nbsp; I know this next one sounds weird,
but our toilet sang like a bird.&nbsp; I realize this could have been air
in the lines except that when I was cleaning one day and the toilet was
singing away I jokingly grabbed the plunger and the toilet brush made a
cross and said "The power of Christ compels you to leave!"&nbsp; John,
my husband was laughing until the second I finished saying that the toilet
went dead (no pun intended) silent! Not long after my husband and I were
lounging on a Sunday morning when all of a sudden there was a very loud
belch, like it was right in bed with us, I looked and John, John looked
at me kind of with a "Did you do that?"&nbsp; look and we both high tailed
it into the living room.&nbsp; A few months later I had to get up and get
a drink of water so I did my ritual of saying "I'm not going to see anything."
and opened the door.&nbsp; This night was different.&nbsp; It was a weird
feeling of electricity in the air, sort of a hot humid restlessness so
I headed down the hall towards the kitchen and passed through what felt
like a cold wet blanket.&nbsp; Two seconds later I hear my husband yelling
in the bedroom I ran back to the bedroom and he was sitting up in bed pointing
at the mirror on my vanity and shouting "Face,face!"&nbsp; He saw an old
man's face appear in the mirror.&nbsp; Well that was it I had had it. We
got John's crucifix and placed it over the area of the mirror where the
face appeared and prayed (I didn't know how to do sage cleansings at that
time)&nbsp; The next day I thoroughly cleaned the apartment and prayed
in each room except for our roommates, because he is an atheist and respected
his request not to do his room and when I got to the screen in the bathroom
I scrubbed and scrubbed but the handprint stayed....Until I prayed over
it, then the whole screen came clean.&nbsp; Needless to say we didn't have
any problems after that.&nbsp; My attitude towards scary ghosts is kick
astral booty and take names, there is no reason to allow them to dictate
your life, after all we are the ones with the carnate bodies, they are
not and since we occupy our time and space appropriately and they occupy
our time and space inappropriately (and I'm talking about the bad scary
ones) It is karmatically ok to evict them.&nbsp; Peace be with you.</b>

<p><b>Oregons Many Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Libby Jones</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in a house in Marion, Oregon when I was
fifteen that was haunted by many ghosts.&nbsp; There was at least one in
every room and not all of them were friendly.&nbsp; I was pushed down the
stairs at least once a day but was never once injured.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I once saw a little girl standing on the railroad tracks
in front of the house.&nbsp; She was illumintated by the headlights of
a train that was not there.&nbsp; There was no sound of the train, only
the light.&nbsp; Another time, I saw a severed head at the top of the stairs
and it vanished while I was looking at it.&nbsp; There was always a man
in my room who kept me from "sleep walking", something I never did anywhere
else.&nbsp; He would always lead me back into the room and put me to bed.&nbsp;
I know it was not a dream because sometimes he woke me up doing it.&nbsp;
And my bedroom light was never turned off no matter how many</b>
<br><b>times I tried to turn it off.&nbsp; I got used to sleeping with
it on.&nbsp; There were many incidents in that house that could not be
explained.&nbsp; None of my friends would ever spend the night with me
because they thought it was too creepy.</b>

<br><b>Ghost Siting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Richard Beighton</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Last October , two weeks before Halloween , I saw a ghost which glided
accross in front of the car I was travelling in with a friend on the B2028
which runs from Ardingly to Haywards Heath. It was 10-30pm approximately
in the evening and we were travelling back from a night out . I saw on
the verge side about 2000 yards in front of the car something gliding slowly
accross the road. I thought this was an owl at first , but as the car got
nearer I could see it was in fact&nbsp; a transparentfigure which was barely
visible. As we approached to about 1000 yards the figure stopped in the
middle of the road and faced us directly . The car headlights shone through
it to the other side. It then continued to move to the right hand side
of the road.Then to my horror a dematerialised . It was of a man who was
in his 50's in Railway workers overalls and Boots.He had a large belt and
buckle . His face was round and he had a horrible grin over his face. He
seem to be enjoying the fact that he had scared the hell out of us.In his
right ear was an earing. I closed my eyes disbelieving what I was seeing
, but to my amazement the Ghost was still there. Before we could hit it
the Ghost suddenly dematerialised and was gone . I askled my friend whether
he saw it too , but he claims he did not . I have since discovered that
a Ghost does haunt that stretch of road and it is of a railway worker who
built the old Steam railway from Horsted Keynes to Haywards Heath . It
likes to appear to young car drivers and to startle them&nbsp; and derives
pleasure from startling people by its sudden appearance</b>

<br><b>Ghost Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sales@MDdirectonline.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This relates to a house built around the turn of the century in Kirkland,
WA. near Seattle.</b>
<br><b>Every night heavy footsteps were heard beginning in the kitchen
area of the house proceeding to the living room and then to the bedroom
where we slept. During the day the footsteps were also heard at times in
all places in the house including the recent kitchen addition.Localized
cold spots in the house were favorites during the summer because the house
had no air conditioning. At another time during that single summer we lived
in the house three crabs fell out of an apple tree on the property as my
wife and I were working the in the yard.These episodes were all non-threatening
with the exception of one when my wife screamed in the middle of the night
claiming</b>
<br><b>that the wall was "moving" and trying to engulf her. She insisted
that I move the bed to the center of the room where we slept for the next
several weeks. When the bed was moved back I traded spots with her and
experienced no such phenomenon.&nbsp; In the two years since we moved out
of the house three other occupants have come and gone. The house is currently
empty.</b>

<br><b>My New House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband and myself recently bought our first house.&nbsp; I had
always lived in apartments and our last apartment was very small.&nbsp;
The house was great!&nbsp; it was built almost 100 years ago, all the original
woodwork, five bedrooms, hardwood floors, really pretty.&nbsp; Needless
to say having lived in apartments all my life this new found space was
scary. We moved in Labor Day weekend 1999.&nbsp; All was well, until one
night late in Sept.&nbsp; (Please keep in mind I am a first year law student
and very stressed out).&nbsp; The Master bedroom (to be our room) on the
third floor was not decorated yet so we made one of the smaller bedrooms
on the second floor a temporary bedroom.&nbsp; I felt very uncomfortable
in this room.&nbsp; I have no idea why.&nbsp; Our house is very warm and
inviting.&nbsp; Well, this one night in late Sept.&nbsp; I was awoken by
this loud crash.&nbsp; I can't tell you where the crash came from but it
was inside the house.&nbsp; I immediately woke my husband.&nbsp; The rational
attorney that he is, told me it was my imagination go back to sleep.&nbsp;
before he could finish the sentence, the crash sounded again.&nbsp; He
said and I quote "holy sh- -!&nbsp; What the ---- was that?&nbsp; He insisted
someone was trying to break in.&nbsp; The sound was so loud and in the
house.&nbsp; I have two dogs that bark if the wind blows, they didn't even
acknowledge the noise, which was very strange to me.&nbsp; Anyway, we walked
around the house, my husband with a hammer and me with a golf club, like
two idiots.&nbsp; We even went as far as to call the cops.&nbsp; Nothing
was out of order , nothing had fallen and to this day I have no explanation
for the sound.Many times I thought I saw a shadowy figure walk down my
stairs but always wrote it off as nothing.&nbsp; As the Fall came and the
weather started to turn, I came home from school one day (late Oct. early
Nov).&nbsp; I got myself organized for a six hour homeworkfest.&nbsp; I
decided to build a fire.&nbsp; I was home alone.&nbsp; I want out back
to get wood and headed into the living room (where the fireplace is located),
I glanced to my left and sitting on my staircase was a relatively young
man, light brown hair, brown pants, basic shirt.&nbsp; He was there for
seconds and then he wasn't but I got a good look at him.&nbsp; I almost
passed out.&nbsp; I called my husband ASAP, again he told me it was my
imagination.&nbsp; I was so frustrated.&nbsp; When I first saw the man
I thought my husband came home from work early, he was clearly sitting
on the stairs looking out the front door.&nbsp; This wasn't a shadow or
a situation where I thought I saw something.&nbsp; I saw him he was just
sitting there! I haven't seen anything else but I have heard knocking on
my front door when no one is there.&nbsp; The dogs do react to the knocking,
they bark like crazy.&nbsp; I have had my back turned and had the feeling
someone walked up behind me.&nbsp; Sometimes I</b>
<br><b>swear that my husband is behind me and I'll start talking to him
only to turn expecting him to be there and he's not. I am an educated,
rational person who was a major skeptic.&nbsp; Believe me I'm not a skeptic
anymore.&nbsp; I live in a great house with a welcoming and warm feeling
inside.&nbsp; I am only the third owner even though the house is almost
100 years old.&nbsp; The last owner lived in the house for about 12 years
and the family before were the builders of the house.&nbsp; I am guessing
this thing I am experiencing is not a bad thing, it doesn't feel bad or
scary.&nbsp; My husband says it is my imagination because of</b>
<br><b>all the stress of law school.&nbsp; I just don't know.</b>

<p><b>Questionable Ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tjensen@bellatlantic.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>A family member owns a construction business and they are working
in a</b>
<br><b>historical mansion in our town.&nbsp; I find old buildings to be
very</b>
<br><b>interesting so I stopped in to take a look around with my mother
and 2</b>
<br><b>children.&nbsp; It was a very interesting place and I felt no vibes
from it.</b>
<br><b>In the meantime my husband went on the job there about a month later.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>went to bed that evening and had horrible nightmares all night.&nbsp;
In my</b>
<br><b>dream I was in the house and something was trying to take over my
mind.</b>
<br><b>I kept getting flashes of a murder of a young woman by the name
of Mary</b>
<br><b>in the kitchen.&nbsp; Her throat was slit and a knife was in her
chest.</b>
<br><b>Another woman with long black hair stood there looking.&nbsp; I
woke from the</b>
<br><b>dream very shook up. I layed awake in my bed for about 45 min.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>fell back asleep I went right back into the dream. It kept on</b>
<br><b>repeating.&nbsp; The next day when I woke up it stayed with me all
day.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>went to my local library to get some history on the place.&nbsp;
The only</b>
<br><b>thing that I knew prior to my dream was an old man lived there and
I</b>
<br><b>believe died there, there was a fire at one time and it was also
a boys</b>
<br><b>home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The history I got from the library told me there was in fact
a young</b>
<br><b>woman by the name of Mary who lived there and died at 15.&nbsp;
It did not</b>
<br><b>say from what.&nbsp; Another interesting factor was the first woman
the house</b>
<br><b>was built for died June 1834 and the last woman who carried the
family</b>
<br><b>name died June 1934, 100 years later to the day.&nbsp; Maybe just
a</b>
<br><b>coincident.&nbsp; What has me bothered is I do have alot of dreams
come true</b>
<br><b>and visits from dead relatives, some that I wasn't even close with.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>tried to get more information from the historical society but, they
just</b>
<br><b>think I am crazy and quote"say there is no such things as ghosts
and</b>
<br><b>they don't believe in that bullshit." Maybe I just have an overactive</b>
<br><b>imagination but, I feel there is something there. It has gathered
my</b>
<br><b>interest.&nbsp; Thank-you for reading my story.&nbsp; If you have

<br><b>Pimper's Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:sabacheller@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I would like to give you a little background on</b>
<br><b>myself before I get into the story.&nbsp; I am retired from the</b>
<br><b>US Army, a former Intelligence Agent, and a Criminal</b>
<br><b>Investigator.&nbsp; I served three years in Vietnam.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>am a recovering alcoholic, and at the time of the</b>
<br><b>incident, I had been clean and sober for four years.</b>
<br><b>I have never used drugs.&nbsp; I am also an active Police</b>
<br><b>Officer.&nbsp; I was born in November 1945.</b>
<br><b>In October 1986, my wife brought home a puppy that</b>
<br><b>we named Prince.&nbsp; He was a Shitzu, and a very pampered</b>
<br><b>and loving member of our family.&nbsp; Our son called him</b>
<br><b>Pimper, and the name stuck.</b>
<br><b>One of the bedrooms in our home was converted into</b>
<br><b>an office, and Pimper would often curl up at my feet</b>
<br><b>while I worked on the computer.&nbsp; My wife placed a</b>
<br><b>small rug there for him to have something to lay on.</b>
<br><b>We have hardwood floors.&nbsp; Frequently, Pimper would</b>
<br><b>lick my feet to let me know he was there, and I</b>
<br><b>would pick him up, and pat him, then put him back on "his"</b>
<br><b>rug and continue my work.&nbsp; Pimper was a member of</b>
<br><b>the family, in that he was not treated as a dog, but</b>
<br><b>rather as one of the kids.&nbsp; He almost acted like a</b>
<br><b>kid.&nbsp; One day while I was trying to sleep he jumped</b>
<br><b>up on the bed and awakened me to open a small bag of</b>
<br><b>candy our son had received for "Trick or Treat"&nbsp; Bue</b>
<br><b>enough of that.&nbsp; Pimper was always with one of the</b>
<br><b>family, never off by himself.</b>
<br><b>On December 28, 1997, Pimper passed away, but before</b>
<br><b>he did, he went to every member of the family, as if</b>
<br><b>to say good bye.&nbsp; It was a tragic thing, and I felt</b>
<br><b>worse about Pimper passing away than I did about my</b>
<br><b>own father, but then that is another story.</b>
<br><b>A few days later, I was in my office trying to lose</b>
<br><b>myself in a computer game, when I felt Pimper</b>
<br><b>licking my feet as he had always done.&nbsp; This continued on</b>
<br><b>until his ashes were returned and he was burried in</b>
<br><b>the back yard he had called his home for those many</b>
<br><b>years.&nbsp; That same night, my wife, a normal skeptic,</b>
<br><b>related to me that she had had a dream that she saw</b>
<br><b>Pimper with Jesus.&nbsp; I truely believe that Pimper is</b>
<br><b>in Heaven, because if he isn't, then there isn't a</b>
<br><b>heaven that I would want to go to.</b>
<br><b>I swear on my badge and gun that this is the turth.</b>

<p><b>Busy Place</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sshack@infocom.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I recently submitted an account to the Shadowlands which I titled
"Farmhand".&nbsp; It was a brief narrative of the haunting which is going
on in my central Indiana farmhouse.&nbsp; I will not recap that narrative
but would like to share an account of increased activity in the house.
Over Memorial day weekend of this year my wife's sister and her 3 year
old son were visiting us from Michigan.&nbsp; My sister in law has a much
higher sensitivity level to spirits than most people and she does not particularly
welcome the ability.&nbsp; She once made the mistake of openly welcoming
any spirits who wanted to visit her into her home and had a very hard time
ridding herself of one particular entity.&nbsp; Since that episode she
is reluctant to even discuss spirits. On the first night of her visit she
and her son were sleeping in the living room of our farm house.&nbsp; She
woke up at approximately 0300 feeling as if she were being watched.&nbsp;
She looked into the hall way leading to the kitchen and saw a man standing
in the hall watching her and her son.&nbsp; She indicated that she felt
no fear but was uncomfortable with his presence. She eventually closed
her eyes and refused to look any longer and eventually fell back to sleep.&nbsp;
This is the same hall</b>
<br><b>way that makes people scoot through a little fast...not scary...you
just feel an urge to hurry down it. The next day she was filling us in
on the encounter of the previous night and I was noting the similarities
to the apparition that I had seen in the house a couple of years earlier.&nbsp;
One difference is that my encounter had been with a younger version of
the apparition....and she had seen a full body...my lone experience had
been of the apparition from the waist up only.&nbsp; The physical description
was very similar..my version had red hair...hers had white hair.&nbsp;
One thing that was identical was the bright blue eyes we both described
seeing. While discussing this encounter I took note that the only activity
seemed to take place in the original part of the house built in the 1840's.&nbsp;
I jokingly mentioned that perhaps the spirit does not venture into the
additions to the house.&nbsp; Big mistake!&nbsp; The second night of her
visit around 0100 I awoke to the sensation one can experience when a cat
walks on you while you are laying in bed...I felt the sensation go down
the right side of my leg then a heavy force was felt on my feet.&nbsp;
Not unusual</b>
<br><b>except that there are no cats in the house&nbsp; This bothered me
very much.&nbsp; I was extremely uncomfortable with physical contact with
this entity. I left the bedroom and went out to the porch to spend the
rest of the night.&nbsp; I had no sooner settled into a chair when I heard
the sound of someone coming out to the porch.&nbsp; I was greatly relieved
that it was my sister in law.&nbsp; She asked if anything was wrong and
I told her only that I'd had a bad experience.&nbsp; She asked if I had
felt anything touch my feet!&nbsp; When I responded affirmative she said
that something had come into the living room and stood beside her for awhile
then began touching her leg then proceeded to sit on her feet. She was
worried about her young son so we returned to the living room where I sat
in a recliner to try to get some sleep.&nbsp; While sitting in the chair
I was struck sharply in the foot once...then something began to scurry
around the ceiling of the living room...a noticeable sound of movement...very
rapid in pace. My sister in law felt as if this was a second presence...she
did not receive the same feeling from the night before.&nbsp; She indicated
that it did not give any feelings of malevolence...only wanting to be noticed.&nbsp;
In the past week the touching has reduced in frequency...but have changed.&nbsp;
I will occasionally feel a small charge of static electricity on my arm
or hand</b>
<br><b>and have been visited once more at night with the "cat" sensation.&nbsp;
I can only hope that my sister in law is correct in her assessment that
this is simply the spirits way of saying "Hello...I'm here"&nbsp; Still
I am very uncomfortable with this and do&nbsp; not welcome it at all.&nbsp;
Thanks for listening...</b>

<br><b>is the story I only told my husband and mother-in-law the other
day, as we</b>
<br><b>talked about weird stuff happening in the houses. There were two
moments</b>
<br><b>in my life when I saw a brownie, thought the first one was rather
darker...</b>
<br><b>well here is the story. Both of these events have happened in the
busy</b>
<br><b>city center, in a tenement-house, so no wild animals were around</b>
<br><b>My grand mother lived separately from us, and always complained
that at</b>
<br><b>night a small hairy man with long nails was grabbing and pulling
her legs</b>
<br><b>and arms. Mom thought that this was a senile dementia and told her
not to</b>
<br><b>pay any attention, until one day Granny visited us and showed bruises
on</b>
<br><b>her wrist, which looked like small fingers but with claw marks on
skin.</b>
<br><b>There were 4 of them. The only time my granny had animal was when
my mom</b>
<br><b>was a teen and there was no cats or dogs in the whole building.
After that</b>
<br><b>event I was moved to her place to keep her a company, and to be
honest the</b>
<br><b>thing didn't bother her, apart from walking about in the corridor
with</b>
<br><b>awful noise, to which we were all used to. I was 13 when granny
died, and</b>
<br><b>for a few weeks we stayed in that place with mom. The first night
I was</b>
<br><b>waken up by mom's scream. When I turned the light on, I saw her
sitting on</b>
<br><b>the bed, and holding her throat. She said, that small hairy hands
tried to</b>
<br><b>throttle her. there were again, small marks on her throat, resembling</b>
<br><b>Granny's bruises. The next day in the dawn I was waken up to see</b>
<br><b>something, that looked like hairy fir cone about 1,5 feet tall,
black with huge</b>
<br><b>yellow eyes, sitting on my belly. As soon as I woke up it ran away
within a</b>
<br><b>second. Being scared by that we decided to go to the church. The
morning</b>
<br><b>of that day started with washing up the kitchen, as the thing has
scattered</b>
<br><b>the flour all over and left his paw printouts. They looked like
little</b>
<br><b>puppy foot prints with lots of hair around, the trace that could
live a</b>
<br><b>cocker-spaniel if he had a very small feet. At the time this happened,
we</b>
<br><b>couldn't find anybody knowing how to deal with paranormal, it was
1988, in</b>
<br><b>Soviet Union, and even now not that many people are here, that can
help in</b>
<br><b>this situation. We were so scared and had to give away that place.
By the</b>
<br><b>way, as far as I know,&nbsp; within three years this apartment has
changed 5</b>
<br><b>owners, no-one could live there more than 5 months.</b>
<br><b>The second event happened when I rented a studio, two years ago.
The same</b>
<br><b>thing, I was waken up in the day-break, not being able to breathe,
but</b>
<br><b>this time I saw a red creature, of the same shape as before, sitting
on my</b>
<br><b>chest. It was about 3-4 kilos weight, and was staring at me without</b>
<br><b>blinking with it's round owl-like eyes. For a second, still half
awake I</b>
<br><b>thought it was Danny, my Irish setter put his head, but then realized,</b>
<br><b>that this thing was sitting like squirrel on hind legs, with small
monkey-like</b>
<br><b>hands shining through the thick&nbsp; long hair on the belly, and
heard my dog</b>
<br><b>growling. I was so scared that I threw the blanked upwards,&nbsp;
and the thing</b>
<br><b>has hit the wall first, and then fell behind the bed. The noise
it made</b>
<br><b>falling, showed it was quite material and that it received quite
a hit. I</b>
<br><b>got up the bed to find my dog resting in his chair looking at my
bed, with</b>
<br><b>all hair up, shivering from nose to tail, and looking scared, which
never</b>
<br><b>happened to him, as he was always fighting with bull-terriers without
a</b>
<br><b>fear. I looked behind the bed, but nothing was there, apart from
my</b>
<br><b>missing silk scarf. Whatever it was, after that day, I've had my
things missing</b>
<br><b>and re-appearing in places not designed for it, like perfumes from
the</b>
<br><b>drawer&nbsp; in the dog food bags, or puppy collar, which was not
in use for</b>
<br><b>two years, on a leash in the pocket of&nbsp; my "dog-walk" jacket
I was just taking</b>
<br><b>off. Also after the death of my dog a year ago, I still get the
sense of his</b>
<br><b>presence with me, like quick lick, nose push or ever rarely quick
bark in</b>
<br><b>the morning. These things are accompanying with cold shivers, and
when</b>
<br><b>these moments are happening, my cat darts off me.</b>
<br><b>Last time I felt it was two weeks ago, when I lost my unborn child,
I felt</b>
<br><b>Danny's tongue licking off my tears as he always did when I cried.
This</b>
<br><b>drives me crazy, thought my husband says, sometimes he feels Danny
nose</b>
<br><b>pushing him too.</b>

<p><b>Fiske Hall -- Much of Keene State College is said to be haunted,
but I had my own experience, unlikes the rumor of Huntress, where I lived
for three semesters.&nbsp; Harriet is more of a rumor than actual experience.&nbsp;
Anyhow, Fiske is said to be haunted by several ghosts, or as I know.&nbsp;
One time while hanging out with friends, one of them pointed out that there
was something at the end of the hall.&nbsp; Of course we all looked and
saw nothing there.&nbsp; The lights then started to blink in a frantic
state in the hall.&nbsp; The one person I was with who noticed this "thing"
at the end of the hall asked whatever it was to stop it.&nbsp; Once he
said that, the lights stopped flickering.&nbsp; Second happened in the
basement of Fiske.&nbsp; The basement you can see from one end to the other
(stairwells to the basement are at each end of the building).&nbsp; Along
the hall are doors that, I assumed&nbsp; after checking a few, are locked.&nbsp;
Anyhow, while journeying down there one night with a friend, as a part
of a Halloween adventure, my friend and I began to look around.&nbsp; We
began to journey to the other end of the basement when we hear loud banging
behind one of the doors.&nbsp; When we heard that, we took off running,
but the noise followed as if the door was right behind us.&nbsp; It followed
us right up to the stairs and then disappeared as we ascended up them.</b>

<br><b>Fairfield's Haunted Church</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: keireihana@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is the story behind the Fairfield Ohio - Fairfield Church of
Christ</b>
<br><b>listing in the haunted places index.</b>
<br><b>Some weird things happen here. I myself, have felt a strange</b>
<br><b>un-easieness in the small hall behind the old youth center. Don't
asume</b>
<br><b>that just because it's old that it's dusty, dark and not used. It's
very</b>
<br><b>nice, BRIGHTLY lit. and used almost every single day for one event
or</b>
<br><b>another, particularly for our groups music practice (About 30 of
us). In</b>
<br><b>the back hall though, it's kind of like you're being watched. Another</b>
<br><b>weird thing in there is the small lawn/tools garage in the huge
parking</b>
<br><b>lot. I never went behind it, but my friend Trey did. This was about
6pm</b>
<br><b>that day, still full, complete daylight outside and I was inside
talking</b>
<br><b>to someone and we agreed to meet back there to skip a small 1/2
hour</b>
<br><b>sermon they call "Power-Up" that takes place just before we all
meet</b>
<br><b>downstairs.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, he got back there with another friend of mine, Derek, and
they</b>
<br><b>waited for me with their instruments from our band practice earlier
that</b>
<br><b>day (bass and guitar). Next thing I know, they come running into
the</b>
<br><b>church, pale as a ghost. I asked what was wrong, and they told me
as I</b>
<br><b>quote "Dude! (panting) We were behind the garage thingy out there</b>
<br><b>waitin' for you, and all of a sudden there were footsteps behind
us. We</b>
<br><b>turned around but nobody was there! Then we heard them again behind
us</b>
<br><b>as a shadow of someone streched over us like someone was there,
but</b>
<br><b>nobody was again!! I'm never goin' back there again!!!!" I, being
a</b>
<br><b>beleiver in ghosts for a long time, thought this was pretty cool,
but I</b>
<br><b>didn't want it to happen to me other weird things took place in
the old youth center just last week. It was after our group's practice
(the 30 of us) and I left. Just as I got</b>
<br><b>home, I remembered leaving my backpack with my Sega Saturn in it
down in</b>
<br><b>the youth center. So my dad drove back to the church (took maybe
5 min.</b>
<br><b>like usual) while everyone was leaving. I was relevived to find
the</b>
<br><b>doors unlocked, with about roughly&nbsp; 20~30 people in the parking
lot</b>
<br><b>talking. I kind of un-easily waked downstairs into the dark hall.
I</b>
<br><b>turned on the light. It was so quiet thsat I could hear the hum
of the</b>
<br><b>flourescent bulbs. Mind you, I was one of about 2 people ion the
church,</b>
<br><b>and I was the only one down on the bottom floor. Anyway, I made
my way</b>
<br><b>into the youth center and grabbed my bookbag, which thankfully was
right</b>
<br><b>inside the doors :). At this point, the suspence was builing so
much</b>
<br><b>that I felt as if I was in a horror movie. Then I heard a door slam</b>
<br><b>upstairs, which I thought was maybe Brian, one of our directors,
coming</b>
<br><b>back in to make sure everything was locked and all lights out. No
big</b>
<br><b>deal, right? I yelled out "Brian? Is that you? Brian?!" Nobody answered</b>
<br><b>me! At this point in time, you could've said my name and I would've</b>
<br><b>pissed my pants (Not being far from it already then)! I dashed back</b>
<br><b>upstairs, not bothering to hit the lights, and ran out the door.
I was</b>
<br><b>back there just last wednesday for our weekly practice, but I vowed</b>
<br><b>never to be in that church alone ever again!</b>

<p><b>Ghostly activity in Yukon, Oklahoma</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bbbritter@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; On June 26,2000,&nbsp; I had gone to</b>
<br><b>work,&nbsp; to clean my doctor's home, while I was there,&nbsp;
I saw this black robed</b>
<br><b>enitity, upstairs, running back and forth, so that it could watch
me , while</b>
<br><b>I was cleaning downstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would come halfway downstairs,
and then It</b>
<br><b>would go back up stairs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Their daughter's bedroom's are up there....&nbsp;&nbsp;
This black enitity as I</b>
<br><b>call it, has no facial feature's except for it's eye's.....&nbsp;&nbsp;
So I alerted a</b>
<br><b>friend of mine that was therealso, about what I'd seen...&nbsp;&nbsp;
She was terrified,</b>
<br><b>I did my best as not to show my fear, due to the fact that evil
spirit's feed off</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;of a person's fear's..&nbsp;&nbsp; So I asked her if she knew
where the Bible's were, she found one,</b>
<br><b>and gave to me, I opened it to psalms 23, and put on an old antique
dresser&nbsp; upstairs, in</b>
<br><b>the hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So then after that the activity slowed
down somewhat, I then asked</b>
<br><b>my friend where was the entrance to the attic??&nbsp;&nbsp; She
stold me uptairs in micheal's bedroom.</b>
<br><b>(their son) . I then went to get the vaccuum cleaner, so I could
vaccuum the</b>
<br><b>living room,&nbsp; I saw this black enitity in the stairway,&nbsp;
leading to micheal's room, (note***&nbsp;&nbsp; there wasn't a Bible</b>
<br><b>opened in his bedroom)&nbsp;&nbsp; then, I told my friend that it
is in the stariway,</b>
<br><b>watching me again....so I got b***s&nbsp; and my friend and I went
up the stairway to micheals</b>
<br><b>bedroom,It was very cold in there ( the air conditioning is broken,
it doesn't work</b>
<br><b>upstairs)&nbsp; and I continued up the stairs, and found the attic
door, and felt</b>
<br><b>of it, at first it was very cold, and then like maybe asecond or
two later,</b>
<br><b>it got really hot....&nbsp;&nbsp; So then I knocked on it and basically
told it to go</b>
<br><b>away, and leave us alone...&nbsp; Then Fanci(my friend ) and I went
back down</b>
<br><b>stairs, and I continued on with my cleaning.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I began to move this</b>
<br><b>plastic dinosaur toybox, (it only had 1 blanket and some real small
toys in</b>
<br><b>it) so it really wasn't that heavy ( or hard to move). The lid to
it, was on</b>
<br><b>very tight, when i barely even touched it, the&nbsp; lid went flying
up and hit</b>
<br><b>and cut right me below my right eyebrow.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just stood there, and I</b>
<br><b>knew that this black enitity</b>
<br><b>was there in the same room as I was.&nbsp; It would get really cold
and then it</b>
<br><b>would get real hot ( I mean as hot as a fire would be.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My friend</b>
<br><b>fanci asked me what happened and I told her, she was so spooked
and I was to that</b>
<br><b>we both, stayed side</b>
<br><b>to side, watching out for this black enitity...&nbsp;&nbsp; She
made a comment to me</b>
<br><b>that I (meaning me) haven't seen Stan around..&nbsp; Stan is Cathy's
dad ( cathy</b>
<br><b>is the homeowner).&nbsp; Stan died of cancer about 8 to 10 years
ago...&nbsp;&nbsp; I have</b>
<br><b>seen him there before,&nbsp; Then first time that I saw him, I had
never before</b>
<br><b>seen this man&nbsp; alive,&nbsp; they're no pictures out of him,
anywhere....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>gave the exact description of&nbsp; what this man looked like, then
Laura ( Cathy's</b>
<br><b>daughter) brought Fanci a photo album, and&nbsp; Fanci showed me
a picture of</b>
<br><b>him, she (Fanci&nbsp; turned as white as a ghost)</b>
<br><b>I guess my ghostly encounter with Stan really scared her... the
first time.</b>
<br><b>I told not her to be afraid of him...&nbsp;&nbsp; When Stan is there,&nbsp;
and I see him,</b>
<br><b>he is watching me, with a smile on his face....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have&nbsp; talked to Cathy</b>
<br><b>and her husband about seeing Stan, and Javi (Cathy's&nbsp; husband
) had told me</b>
<br><b>that he has sensed someone else there, besides their family.....&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>not told them about the black enitity....&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing
the black enitity in</b>
<br><b>the house on that day, as I was getting ready to leave (about 5:00)
Fanci and I</b>
<br><b>was standing at the front door talking, and Stan appeared</b>
<br><b>outside, sitting in a chair on the front pourch...&nbsp; I told
Fanci that Stan</b>
<br><b>is here now, do not be afraid,&nbsp; he then had disappeared&nbsp;
and ended up in the</b>
<br><b>house, going upstairs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When I got home, I called Fanci at the house&nbsp; to check
on her and the kids,</b>
<br><b>she thought that the activity ceased.....&nbsp;&nbsp; she said that
she had been</b>
<br><b>outside watching the kids, and that she was to afraid to go in the
house,&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>tried to comfort her the best I could, and told her with Stan being
there,</b>
<br><b>that he would protect them and keep the black enitity at bay.....&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>seen ghosts before, but I have never had an experience before with
a black</b>
<br><b>enitity like that...&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen my deceased mother,
and Sequoyah, ( the</b>
<br><b>indian that wrote the cherokee alphabet)&nbsp; I have also seen
my deceased</b>
<br><b>mother-in-law....&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not told my husband about that,
she passed away</b>
<br><b>in October of 1997.</b>
<br><b>My mother died in October 1986,&nbsp; I was only 14 at the time,
so I can</b>
<br><b>comprehend reason's being why he still get's upset.....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I Sincerely appreciate you taking the time to listen and read

<p><b>My House iN Minnesota</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Fightinglady@webtv.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We lived in the house on Roller for little
better than a year. The</b>
<br><b>hauntings began with my daughter (in her teens) in the middle of
the night</b>
<br><b>to see (it was pitch black in her room ) a figure of a heavy set
woman</b>
<br><b>coming towards her (being so black in her room makes me wonder if
this thing</b>
<br><b>had an aura) Thinking it was me playing some joke on her, so she
called out,</b>
<br><b>when there was no answer she through the blankets over her head
and wormed</b>
<br><b>towards the end of the bed and raced up the stairs to my room. I
slept like</b>
<br><b>a baby, but my husband went to the bedroom door.</b>
<br><b>I just wish I would have woken up,because I found out the uneasy
way. One</b>
<br><b>morning she complained about her back, I asked what was wrong with
her back?</b>
<br><b>she said for about a week she slept in the bathroom,because these
haunting</b>
<br><b>happened every night.That was it, when she left for school I rearanged
the</b>
<br><b>bedrooms.That was the end of that type of haunting, but there was
more to</b>
<br><b>deal with. My husband is a Firefighter and he had 24 hour shifts.
On the</b>
<br><b>night he was at work the kids and I slept on one floor. I took the
couch and</b>
<br><b>pulled the baby's basinette close to me.The two older kids slept
in my</b>
<br><b>double bed. I would wake many times during the night to the feeling
of being</b>
<br><b>watched (almost like eyes hovering over me) this feeling wasn't
so much</b>
<br><b>during the day.Once a couple months latter,when my husband was at
work the</b>
<br><b>children and I was eating supper when the basement-workshopdoor
slammed</b>
<br><b>shut.No one was down stairs and there where no windows open. My
husband and</b>
<br><b>I decided to get a cat inspite of no mouse dropings. I had the two
cats</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;sleep downstairs at night,</b>
<br><b>but things upstairs(1stfloor) began to happen, The Christmas tree
was being</b>
<br><b>messed with and scratchings on the attic walls were getting more
pronounced</b>
<br><b>(I never heard anything ,felt anything or saw anything but the eyes
staring</b>
<br><b>at me, and the slamming of the work shop door. A couple mounths
passed and I</b>
<br><b>found myself a Den leader for the scouts.Once I was in the work
shop cutting</b>
<br><b>boards and designs for the scout project and&nbsp; Once again I
felt I was being</b>
<br><b>closely watched.One day my husband and I decided we could get away
for a few</b>
<br><b>hours. just call the baby sitter up the block. When we got back
home all the</b>
<br><b>kids where in tears standing on the furniture and screaming thats
when we</b>
<br><b>decided to move. The house is still standing&nbsp; but hud(housing</b>
<br><b>development)now has it THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. The hauntings took
place in</b>
<br><b>1983.</b>

in this house, which I lived in with a</b>
<br><b>bunch of people, all students, so I had others to back me up...
It was late</b>
<br><b>on a hot summer night, probably about 3:00 am. and I had a roommate
named</b>
<br><b>meredith.She was asleep snoring, and I was restless...and then suddenly
my</b>
<br><b>door opened up and a small bright orb of light&nbsp; flew into my
room, began to</b>
<br><b>spin rather quickly and then flew out of my window...&nbsp; which
was open!!!</b>
<br><b>had been told of such a thing by my friend mark who had seen the
same thing</b>
<br><b>only nights before...I was so scared that i could not speak...so
needless to</b>
<br><b>say, i spent the whole night under my covers, and was very thankfull
to see</b>
<br><b>the light of day....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next
encounter was in the same house, but in a different room,</b>
<br><b>and this time, I had 2 roommates, both named amy... It was late
again and</b>
<br><b>this time I saw the same orb of light, but this time I was not as
scared, so</b>
<br><b>I watched it, and it went over to my friend amy, and circled her,
then did</b>
<br><b>the same thing to the other amy, began spinning fast again and then
flew out</b>
<br><b>the window, which was shut! Then about 5 minutes later, I saw a
milky white</b>
<br><b>figure appear in the center of the room...i got really spooked when
it</b>
<br><b>appeared, and again i hid under the covers.but my encounter was
not over</b>
<br><b>yet,</b>
<br><b>Being students in this house, we were not allowed any pets, that
included</b>
<br><b>cats.well about a half hour after all this happened, I was still
under the</b>
<br><b>covers trying not to suffocate myself...(it gets hot under there!)My
foot</b>
<br><b>was</b>
<br><b>attacked by what i can only say was a cat!It clawed my toes, and
when I</b>
<br><b>looked in the mirror in the daylight, I had a scratch across my
left</b>
<br><b>cheek!and it was obviously was a cat scratch... I truely believe
in</b>
<br><b>spirits.........</b>

<p><b>No Joke!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had experiences in the past with what I believe to have been
spirits</b>
<br><b>but nothing frightened me quite so much as an episode that occured
with a</b>
<br><b>friend. This actually took place about 7 years ago in Northern California.</b>
<br><b>My friend Alyssa was really excited because her husband and her
had just</b>
<br><b>bought their first house a little ways into the country.&nbsp; At
the time, their</b>
<br><b>daughters were ages 1, 5, and 7. When they bought the house, it
came fully</b>
<br><b>furnished since they were told by the grandchildren of the previous
owners</b>
<br><b>that their grandparents had passed away and none of them really
had need of</b>
<br><b>the furntiure so they included it in the price of the house. I was
kind of</b>
<br><b>leary about my friend moving into a home where people had passed
away and</b>
<br><b>also because they now owned their furniture but Alyssa was never
the type to</b>
<br><b>believe in any of that and was just ecstatic to be moving into a
house</b>
<br><b>finally. Everything was perfect for the first few months that they
lived</b>
<br><b>there. The girls finally had their own rooms and Alyssa seemed to
be happy</b>
<br><b>about fixing up her new home. In the kitchen was a china cabinet
that had</b>
<br><b>belong to the previous owner along with all of the china plates
and</b>
<br><b>knick-knacks inside. Alyssa decided to to clean the cabinet, rearrange
the</b>
<br><b>plates, and put in some of her own stuff.&nbsp; When she got done,
she walked</b>
<br><b>away to&nbsp; check on the baby sleeping in the other room.&nbsp;
When she came back</b>
<br><b>into the kitchen, everything in the china cabinet was back to it's
original</b>
<br><b>place.&nbsp; She got kind of freaked out but decided to ask the
girls if they</b>
<br><b>were playing a trick on her. Both of them vehemently denied having
even set</b>
<br><b>foot in the kitchen. She pretty much let it go and decided to leave
things</b>
<br><b>as they were since she didn't have time to do it again. That night
when her</b>
<br><b>husband got home she told him about what had happend but he too
just figured</b>
<br><b>that it was the girls playing a joke on her. The next night though
as Alyssa</b>
<br><b>and her husband were getting into bed, they could here what sounded
like a</b>
<br><b>man gargling in their bathroom. Tim got up to check but there wasn't
anybody</b>
<br><b>in there and the gargling had stopped. From that point on it was
a nightly</b>
<br><b>occurence. Other strange things became commonplace as well such
as the</b>
<br><b>furniture rearranging by itself and the baby talking to the wall.
One day</b>
<br><b>while barbacueing outside, their "guests" even went so far as to
lock all</b>
<br><b>the doors and windows from the inside so they couldn't get back
in. Alyssa</b>
<br><b>and Tim seemed to be okay living with these other "inhabitants".
They had</b>
<br><b>never really done anything to scare them and they never harmed the
girls.</b>
<br><b>However, one day Samantha, the 5 year old was out playing by the
garage but</b>
<br><b>suddenly ran into the house crying hysterically that somebody had
tried to</b>
<br><b>pull her into the garage. Tim went out there but didn't see anyone
in or</b>
<br><b>near the garage.&nbsp; Their nearest neighbors were 5 miles down
the road so he</b>
<br><b>doubted that it was one of them. That night at dinner they sat around
the</b>
<br><b>table laughing and having a good time when Alyssa looked up towards
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen window and saw something peering in at them.&nbsp; She described
it to me</b>
<br><b>as a face in the last stages of decaying.&nbsp; The next morning
Alyssa contacted</b>
<br><b>a local psychic to come and help her cleanse the house and find
out what was</b>
<br><b>going on.&nbsp; The man came out to the house and spent about an
hour walking</b>
<br><b>around.&nbsp; He told her that the spirits in the home were in fact
those of the</b>
<br><b>old couple that had lived there previously.&nbsp; He said that they
were a kind</b>
<br><b>couple and would never do anything to harm any of them. They just
liked to</b>
<br><b>play jokes and wanted them to know of their presence.&nbsp; Then
he proceeded</b>
<br><b>outside to the garage where Samantha had her incident.&nbsp; When
he came back</b>
<br><b>into the house Alyssa said he was white as a sheet.&nbsp; He told
Alyssa and Tim</b>
<br><b>that something had basically sucked him into the garage as soon
as he opened</b>
<br><b>the door. He proceeded to go inside but the feeling of terror and
dread was</b>
<br><b>overwhelming.&nbsp; He asked that Tim board up the garage and not
allow the girls</b>
<br><b>to play near there. Whatever it was, was not friendly and would
do</b>
<br><b>everything in it's power to harm or rid them of the house.&nbsp;
Needless to say,</b>
<br><b>two weeks later Tim and Alyssa put their "dream home" up for sale.&nbsp;
It took</b>
<br><b>them about 6 months to finally sell off the house since they had
to report</b>
<br><b>to the new owners that they had a seance and cleansing of the house.&nbsp;
During</b>
<br><b>that whole time they lived in fear that this "thing" would come
in from the</b>
<br><b>garage. Luckily it never did.</b>

<p><b>A Night with Auntie</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nitro0001@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>You may not believe this, but it is true. Anyway, my aunt and uncle
and</b>
<br><b>their kids came down to our house for the weekend. We went out to
a large</b>
<br><b>piece of property we own. When we were there, I saw a white light
about the</b>
<br><b>size of a large man across the field. suddenly, it streaked across
the</b>
<br><b>field, and dissappeared in the woods. Even stranger was when we
were heading</b>
<br><b>home, my aunt wanted to see one of the above ground graves(i dont
know why,</b>
<br><b>probably to scare us). So we pulled up to the graveyard, and the
headlights</b>
<br><b>were shining on one, and my aunt said she saw a black figure behind
the</b>
<br><b>grave. We went back the next morning, and as we were looking at
some of the</b>
<br><b>graves, I noticed that the ground was matted down near the grave.
I dont</b>
<br><b>know what it was, it may have just been someone mourning the loss
of a past</b>
<br><b>loved one, or maybe it wasnt. I probably will never know.</b>

<p><b>Visits from the Family</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: skiplind@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi I'm Tasha and I'm tewlve years old. This is a story that my Aunt
Judy</b>
<br><b>told me,she said this is true.There was a house in Randolph County,that</b>
<br><b>was left to a girl named Anne. It was left to her from her grandma.
She</b>
<br><b>lived there with her parents and grandma, The girls parents died
when</b>
<br><b>she was very young, so she was raised by her grandma and then the</b>
<br><b>grandma passed away,so the girl was left alone. She was 18 at the
time.</b>
<br><b>One day a handyman had to go do work on the house, he had the keys
to</b>
<br><b>get in with, when he got inside he saw a girl, her parents, and
her</b>
<br><b>grandma standing there and the man took off running he was so frightened</b>
<br><b>because you see they all were dead, for you see the girl had got
killed</b>
<br><b>two weeks earlier in a wreck. The man said he never got over seeing
the</b>
<br><b>ghost. My aunt said this was told&nbsp; to her back in the late
1950's and</b>
<br><b>that no one ever lived in the house again.</b>

<br><b>The girl.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: adaspan@attcanada.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm a 13 year old girl and I have heard so many ghost stories that
scared me half out off my mind. But never I thought that I would see one.</b>
<br><b>I was asleep, and I woke up and there in front of my mirror was
a girl. A girl I never saw before. She was so beautiful. But I saw something.
Something weird. As I looked in the mirror behind her there was no reflection.
she wore rags. Also she had the reddest hair. Her hair was so curly. Her
face was so pale. It was like she froze to death.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I didn't know what to do so I just stared. Then she turned
to me and looked. She looked scared.&nbsp; Then she pointed her finger
my way. She was telling me something but I didn't know what she wanted.
She looked like she wanted me to come to her, to follow her.</b>
<br><b>I was to scared to move. Then I blinked my eyes. She was gone. I
never saw her again but I saw figures of people. Also my dog died before.
I saw figures of him. The weird thing was he was with a person.It was fuzzy
so I couldn't see it good. But I think he found the girl and she would
take care off him. I have heard allot of sounds lately. Things on the roof
at my window in the hall. I feel I'm not alone in my room, that there are
ghosts watching me. My friends say it's my imagination. But I saw a girl
that night. Nobody has to believe me. If they think I'm dumb let them think
that. But I saw her.</b>
<br><b>Maybe she is still in my house? Maybe?</b>
