<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In our old house in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Malta</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> gardens, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">New York</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, we had a
collection of old Stiens and mugs on a high up shelf in our kitchen which was
almost impossible to reach without a ladder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ond day we noticed one of the flip tops on the mug was open and staying
that way, when it is supposed to flip back down when someone lets go of
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up and looked at it and the
entire thing was covered with a thick layer of dust because they hadn't been
touched for over 13 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If someone
had touched it, it wouldn't have dust on the handle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was just after we decided to move out of
the neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We just decided to
leave it that way until we moved and packed them up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became a habbit of everyone in the family
to look at it as thay went by to see if anything happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually when i went by one time it was closed
and still hadn't been touched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That all
happened about 1 year ago and we still havn't figured out what caused it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My first experience was in
my best friend's house. She is now my step sister and we still can't really
talk about it. She lived in a house that was built by her family. I can't
remember how old the house was but I do remember a photo being taken after the
house was first built. There was a little girls face in the window, but at the
time no one had any little girls. They experienced strange things all of the
time. I'd over hear my best friend's mom tell mom things that were happening. I
used to stay the night there all the time. My best friend would tell me things
that happened to her and she liked it when I was there because nothing would
happen. She would tell me that she would hear footsteps on the stairs and that
she would lock the door to her bedroom. She would wake up in the morning with
the door unlocked and the door open. Sorry I'm getting of course here. One
night I stayed there something did happen. She had bunk beds and she and I were
both on the top. The way we were facing we were looking out the window of the
room. The lights were out and I don't remember when or how, I just remember red
beady eyes staring at us through the window. we hid under the covers and stayed
there. Both of us too scared to look to see if it was still there. Many years
later I read the "Amityville Horror". The part where Kathy said that
she saw the red beady eyes staring in at her and her daughter. As soon as I
read that it conjured that night at my friends house. All those many years ago
we told our mothers what had happened. They tried to tell us that a racoon must
have gotten into a tree and was looking in and the reason why its eyes looked
red was because the reflect light. Sounds like a good explaination right? It
would have been if there was a ledge of the ro<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>or a tree by her window. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">That was the first and it
wasn't the last. The house that I currently reside in is probably one of the
only houses that I have lived in that wasn't haunted. Since the red eyes...
I've experinced people calling my name when no one was at home. Radios turning
on by themselves. Toys with no batteries turning on by themselves. Cold spots.
Items missing and returning in places you knew that you had checked. A little
girls voice asking for help before laughing in the most evil laugh I have ever
heard. The closet thing to an actual sighting is what I have at work. Out of
the corner of my eye I'll see someone approach me, nothing more then a shadow
really, but when I turn to look nothing is there. I could go one forever about
the oddities that have happened to me. And to be honest, as much as I have
experienced and as interested in the paranormal that I am. I don't think that I
could handle a full apperation if it were to appear in front of me. To this day
when I go to bed and shut my eyes when the lights are off. I refuse to open
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This happened to us while
we were living in a Rented house on<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">E 2nd

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was a neat house for my
cousin and and friend and I to rent, nice neighborhood, quiet town. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Well all was good until
things started to go happen. first there was the sounds of boxes falling in the
basement, which was empty at the time. then there was the footsteps seen in the
back yard that started from the garden and walked into the wall of the garage,
but went nowwhere else. this was seen in the snow. and then there was the
strange knockings coming from the Hallway closet, which when looking inside
looks like there may have been stairs at one time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My roomate James was
standing in the kitchen on day when he looked behind him in the large mirror,
there was what looked like a woman standing behind him in what looked like garb
from the 1930's when he turned around noone was there. We could never find and
explaination for these occurrences, only that there used to be a house not far
from where this one presently sits, and on a womanthat lived there<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had slipped and been killed in the creek
nearby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">A few days ago I was
perusing your site and I came across the section where you have hauntings
listed state by state. I was very excited to see that you have Glenville State
College listed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Most people who might read
this would have no idea where Glenville State College is or why it would be
listed on your site. Located in central </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">West
  Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Glenville</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">State</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> is a
small college which sits on a hill overlooking the town of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Glenville</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">; its
namesake. The town is very charming and down-to-earth and if one is looking for
a quiet and safe place to continue their learning, then this would be a great
area in which to do so. Snuggled securely in the hills,it is probably the last
place one would expect to encounter ghostly activity, but it has more than its
share of the supernatural. If one believes in such things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Several years ago, I began
attending Glenville State College in the fall after I graduated high school. It
was to be my first true experience of being away from home and I was
experiencing a mixture of excitement and fear. I settled on living in the dorms
so that I could more fully experience college life. Living near me in the dorms
was another girl from my old high school. Well, birds of a feather stick
together and we did just that. We had heard the stories about the dorm and it's
supposed hauntings. We were a little spooked, but only because we wanted to
believe the stories more than we actually did believe them. We were never told
by what or whom it was haunted, but only that there were often very strange and
unusual sounds heard at any time of the day or night. We giggled and eventually
forgot about the tales.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After a while, we managed
to make friends with several students who were from other parts of the state.
Most of the time we would all gather in my dorm room and watch television, play
games, or something. One night after most of my friends had gone home, I was
sitting on my bed with my friend Doug watching some sort of sitcom. While we
were sitting there we heard what sounded like a ball bearing being dropped on
the floor. It then rolled very slowly across the floor. Unsure from where the
sound was coming, we looked under my bed thinking that perhaps something had
fallen from the bottom of the bed. We found absolutely nothing. We wrote it off
as something being dropped by whoever lived above me. We would hear the sound
again before that night was over, and many many times again over the next few
years. Honestly, I continued to blame it on an unknown person who lived
upstairs. The problem with this is that while anything is possible,the chance
that a person living above my room would drop the same item more than 35 times
over a period of a few years is odd (unless it was intentional). Als it is even
more strange that the same person would live above there that long. It was not
uncommon for most people to move out of the dorms after their first year of living
there. I was the odd one, as I chose to stay there longer than most. Still I
had no other explanation, so I continued to blame the girl upstairs. In fact I
do not know if I even had an upstairs roomate, as I never heard sounds from
that room other than the sound of the metal ball being dropped and rolled
across the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After A few years, I too
decided to spread my wings and move into the town. I rented a small house with
a few other friends and eventually forgot about the noises in the dorms. I forgot
that is until I heard someone else talking about it. It was through this person
that a story was told to me that is believed to explain the strange noises
commonly heard in those rooms; the same noises I heard there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It is said, in the version
I heard, that the dorms sit on a site that was once occupied by a childrens
group home. According to the story, one of the residents of the home was a
small disabled boy who drew his enjoyment from playing with a set of marbles he
had. One day while playing, he fell down a set of stairs and died as a result
of a broken neck. Eventually the home was torn down and later the dorms would
be erected on that site. As far as I know, the Marble Boy has been keeping
residents of the dorms awake for many years now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I find the story a little
heartbreaking because the child only knew enjoyment in life because of his set
of marbles, and if one believes the stories, he stays here continuing to play
with the things he loved so much in life. It is sad that as a little boy he had
so little, but it is that "so little" that ties him here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are other tales I
have heard about the college. Some of these I find a bit more frightening that
the story of the Marble Boy. One of these is the story that some of the
buildings on campus typically come alive with activity when there are only one
or two people left inside working late. I have heard that during these times it
will sound as if metal filing cabinets and books are being tossed about,
crashing into walls and such. When this occurs and the rooms are investigated
nothing can be found. The cabinets are in order and the books are neatly
stacked. Furthermore, there is not a single person inside the rooms from where
the noises came. I have also heard that in one of the buildings it sounds as if
there are things being dragged up the hall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On a personal note I had a
similar experience in a room of one of these buildings. I have never told this
story because I didn't really believe my ears. In fact I wrote it all off to an
overactive imagination. One evening, I had gone up to one of the locked rooms
on the top floor of the buildings. At one time the rooms had served as offices
but where being used for storage at the time this happened to me. I had
borrowed the key to the room in order to get a book for a class. I left the
door to the room open while I looked. The layout of this area of the building
was such that there were five or six former office rooms on that floor. Each of
the rooms were on the same side of a long hallway, and there were no other
rooms. At each end of the hallway was a heavy wooden door. When these doors
were opened it made a distinct sound. Anyone who was familiar with the sounds
made by those doors could not possible mistake the sound for anything other.
While I was looking at the books, I heard one of the doors open. Thinking it
was someone else coming to get a book I said hello loud enough be heard. No one
answered. I got up and walked out into the hallway. There was no one there and
all the other rooms were locked and dark. Maybe it was just someone coming to
see if anyone was up there. I'd like to think if this was the case, they would
have at least responded to my "hello." I guess one will never truly
know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are many other
stories regarding </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Glenville</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">State</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> that are
very interesting and great to share on a dark, spooky night. I recommend, for
those few who may be interested, checking it all out yourself. Maybe you will
be suprised.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  School</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, this happend about 2 &frac12; years
ago. Two of my law enforcement buddies and myself happend to see a glow at the
old English building. Neither me or my other partner thought anything of it,
but me being a joker, I told him a what if it's the ghost! My partner told me
yeah your crazy "but he is scared of ghosts" Any how we started to
head to the building , and the third guy showed up so we all told the
dispatcher that we would be checking out the school. There was a radio playing
music in the basement of the English building, didn't think anything about
that, but I saw a small door that apperd to be open, so me being the smallest
of the three I took it upon myself to clear the basement under the building,
much to my suprise, I found a lot of old stuff, but at the entrance was a book
that read "you and the occult, and richulistic death" this gave me a
cold chill, not to mention that my alert statis went up. After clearing the
basement we went to the rest of the campus to see if there was anymore open
doors. the building directly north<span style="">&nbsp; </span>which
is the gym had an open door, so we went in to make sure that it was not
vandalized. upon entering the gym we all heard people talking, so we turned off
our flash lights and started to walk towards the voices, but they kept getting
further away. when we reached the hall we heard what sounded like someone
running on the roof, but there was no ladders on the building. But you could
hear people walking, and talking. I told the other two officers lets stop it is
probable our shoes making the noise, so we stopped in the hall let everything
get quiet, and you could hear someone running down the hall heading our way,
next thing you know the sound just stopped, we started to go east down the hall
and all three of use at the same time saw a light in a class room, so we headed
to the class room, when we got to it the was no possible way that a light could
have come from that room, the door window was blacked out with a black paper
over it. and we thought it might have been a car, but the way the class room is
this car/truck had to be out in the middle of a field. at that point all three
of us got a cold chill the hall got cold and we decided to try and lock up the
school and go about the rest of the night, doing our work, as we left the
school property one of my friends pulled his car out infront of mine and a big
black bird hit his windshield, and left no marks. I didn't see it but he was as
white as a sheet. Thouth that you might want to hear about this, by the way all
three of us are cops!!! hope you enjoyed this!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have given you a story
before but it does not even come close to this one. When i was eight my dad,
step mum and i went to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> for a
holiday. It was christmas you see so we decided to go to </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hever</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Castle</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> on
chrissie day. Anyway it was just becoming evening when I felt a dathly chill
around one of the gardens. As my family walked on I saw an odd looking woman
out of the corner of my eye. I glanced towards her to see a lady of elegance standing
there watching me, she wore a black robe with a single silver chain and had a
scar spreading along her thin neck. She was oddly pale and had an eerie sence
about her. She smiled at me gently, unmoving. Then she stepped forward and
pointed behind my shoulder. I looked behind myself to see what she was looking
at and then when I turned she was gone. I looked in the garden but there was
nothing and nobody. I though felt strangley odd in a way as though someone had
told me something and i had to tell someone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then about two days later
we went to </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hampton Court</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and went
to the Gallery. In the castle i noticed once again a lady in dark costume
staring at me. I thought it was the woman from </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hever</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Castle</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> because
she had the same scar on her neck but as i looked closer i realised that she
did not bear a necklace. She smiled at me and bent to the ground staring at me
with large eyes. Then the same deathly feeling came over me and I spoke. I said
Anne sends her love Catherine. She smiled and disappeared right infront of me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As i grew up i learnt more
about King Henry the 8 and his 6 wives. Two in which were beheaded. I read more
about these two ladies and found that they were cousins. Their names were Anne
Boleyn and Catherine Howard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have become amazed with
these two and am planning to seek out their spirits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I also found out that what
i said to Catherine was a message from Anne. She sends her love... to who else
but her cousin who suffered the same fate as she.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I grew up in a small town right next to the </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ohio
 River</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. As a teen I had an experience one night while driving
along the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and I am
still not sure what to make of it. I was about 18 and my boyfriend and I was
out for a drive, well, the stretch of road that we were on ran along the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and being
that it was a small town there are only so many street lights along this road.
At a certain point they just stop and it is all darkness after that. As it
were, we were returning from a friends house heading toward the place in the
road were the street lights begin again. As we reached the first light I looked
toward the edge of the road and saw what looked like a big white severed goats
head lying on the ground. It was right below the light post in the glow of the
light, I could not have missed it. I noticed that my boyfriend was looking in
that direction also and I quickly said did you see that? And he said yes then
he sped up a bit. We were both quite shaken and didn't say much at first, when
suddenly he turned the car around. I was freaking out and I said what are you
doing? He said he wanted to be sure of what we just saw. We went back and passed
the spot and found nothing. So we past it a few more times and even stopped to
check the area but still found nothing. We drove home trying to decide what to
do about what we saw and when we finally arrived at his house his mother came
into the kitchen to talk to us. My boyfriend turned to her and said we just saw
something really strange. She asked him what it was and he said, to my great
suprise, the body of a nude woman on the side of the road! I thought WHAT??? I
quickly told him that that was not at all what I saw and I proceeded to
describe the severed goats head. Well at this point his mother was throughly
freaked out. We told her that we had gone back and searched but nothing was
there. It seemed funny that both of us had said we seen it and yet neither of
us had said what 'it' was while we were riding in the car. I guess we were just
afraid. The thing is years later, long after that boyfriend and I had gone our
seperate ways. My Husband and I were driving down that same stretch of road
(which I have gone down many times since) and for some reason I looked in that
direction, it was there again and I noticed that my husband was looking at it
too. He quickly slammed on his brakes and yelled there's a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>woman on the ground! He started to through
off his seat belt and I grabbed his arm and said she won't be there when you
get out, and he was like WHAT? WE GOTTA GO SEE, SHE MAY BE HURT! I told him
that she is never there once you get passed that light and besides it was a
severed goat head that I saw, not a woman. I filled him in on the whole thing
and yet he still went to check. Of course there was nothing there. I don't know
what it is, or what happened in that spot, but something must have. People
around the town like to say that the abandoned house on that hillside next to
the road is haunted, but I have been there plenty of times and nothing has ever
happened. The spot where we seen the body/goat head is quite a distance from
the abandoned site. It was a really spooky experience. Thanks for letting me share.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I am an ex- tour guide from
Meramec Caverns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I worked there for two
and a half years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are many people
who have worked there longer than me, and the stories I am going to tell you
come from me and from my predecessors at this job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been said, that the last tour of the
day, the late tour, known to be the last tour in the cave, will hear odd
voices... after lisening closer, you can hear another tour going on, but there
is no other tour in the cave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
female tour guide, and a group of all males.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There have been reports of lights flickering, when there is no one
around the switch, and some guides have reported seeing the ex owner of
the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>cave, Lester B. Dill... He was said
to be a great man, but very picky about the going ons in his cave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My supervisor at the cave, who is still there
today, told once about being in the cave, in total darkness and hearing someone
running at a very fast pace towards him in the walkway.... when they got close
to him, he turned on his flashlight, and there was no one there... the problem
with this is that in total darkness, there is no way to know where you are
going, and anyone, even people familiar with the cave have to use hand railings
to run, but couldn't possibly run that fast down there, and even well trained
guides would run into the trashcans or light boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>no from personal experience, I have heard
strange things, felst breezes and drafts from areas where there isnt an opening
into the cave, in fact there isn't another opening at all, and the one people
come through, has a building built over it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have heard children, as well as adults screaming, and this usually
happened when alone or with another person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There have been instances where we have felt as if we are being watched,
I have had small children saying that they can see people standing there and
there is no one, and even had adults have to leave tours because they can hear
children laughing.... there are many strange occurances that have taken place
in the area, but weather due to the drownings outside in the river or whatever,
it is haunted, ask anyone who works there, they can't tell you everything
because they will get in trouble because they can't sell bad things about a
family invironment... but hey, who knows.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, it used to be a civil war hideout, there was an acctuall
documented battle fought in the entrance, and the founder of sullivan ( a
nearby town) was hung in the entrence way.... anyways, check it out, you
probably wont find much on the internet... but go there, ask around, you hear
about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">alright...i've read the
stories on this site a few times (obviously not ALL of them, there's way too
many, but a good deal of them). i've had several experiences that are very
similar to several of yours. while they are fairly unbelievable, they're true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my first story starts off
when i was around the age of 5 or 6 years old. there has always been a red
stain on the carpet at the top of the stairs in that house, and we never knew
why, because no one had spilled anything there. we tried putting in a new
carpet, and it didn't get rid of it. the contractors said it was due to oil
rising from the mines or something like that, i can't remember, so i wont try
to explain their theory. anyways, i was in my room, trying to sleep, and i had
my nightlight on (its weird, i used to be afraid of the dark, now i'm all about
the paranormal sh!t). suddenly, my nightlight blew out and i heard a woman
scream. my brother, who shared a room with me at the time, heard it too. my
grandma lived with me, my brother, my mom and dad, and my sister. so naturally,
my brother and i ran into her room, thinking she fell, or someone broke in (we
lived in an urban area at the time, so this was not unusual). but no one was
there, and my grandma was sound asleep. my sister was too, so we assumed that
we heard my parents' tv. but when came back to our end of the hallway, my dad
was fully dressed, asking if we knew anything that was going on. we didnt, so
he let us go back to bed. naturally, we didn't sleep. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">not fifteen minutes later,
the scream broke out again. this time, i thought it was my sister, trying to
get me and my brother in trouble. so i ran out and saw a tall lady with a great
figure standing in the hallway, with a look of terror on her face. as she
screamed, i saw a man run past her with something in his hands, punch her in
the side, and rush out the door. i think he<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>had a knife or something of the sort, but after that, the woman
disappeared. we moved out of the house a few weeks later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my next story brings us to
the house i live in now. we had just moved in maybe 4 months ago, and my
parents thought it would be a nice birthday if they left us kids at home with
my gram. so, when they left, maybe an hour passed, and we heard a noise, like
someone was trying to rattle the screen door off the hinges. so, i locked the
door and we went into my grandma's room. after about an hour or so of just
sitting in the pitch darkness of our quiet little house hidden in the wooded
area of the development, we went back out into the kitchen. assuming everything
was fine, and that it was just a wild animal or something, we started to laugh
and joke and ended up back in the living room watching tv (the door leads right
into the living room). what happened next is extremely strange. the tv started
turning on and off, the lights started flickering, and the oven heat (we were
making a frozen pizza) soared to its highest point and the heating elements
inside burnt out. then, everything stopped, and we were left in pitch darkness.
then, my parents room, which was one room over from the living room, the bed
started squeaking. we looked inside, and by the light from the window, we saw
what looked like an invisible person jumping up and down on the bed. my
grandma, who was lways a religious person, said, in a loud clear voice,
"in the name of jesus christ, depart from this home." not 3 seconds
later, it stopped. i felt something cold brush by me, open up the locked door,
and slam it shut behind it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">we were all in shock. after
a few hours, we thought we heard our parents come up the driveway, so we rushed
to the door to see them and tell them our story. well, someone opened the door
and after a second, my grandma said "we're all fine, thanks for getting
rid of them". when i asked her who she was talking to, she said a kind man
in the doorway asked if those kids nextdoor were bothering us. then, the door
closed quietly. we all sat there, and didnt move from the spots we were in, all
wide awake. when my parents got home, they couldn't open the door because it
was still locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">after that, most people
would have hoped that we didn't dabble in the activity anymore. however, i felt
that there was something more out there. so, i've been visiting haunted areas,
graveyards, and all sorts of weird areas, because i don't believe these things
were in my imagination. after all, my brother was with me both times, and he
had the same story i did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

without experiencing it myself, I talked two brave <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">souls into driving to the

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">0200. I then proceeded to
walk back alone without a flashlight through the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">dropped me off were
supposed to be waiting. Upon first exiting the vehicle, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I heard this poping and
cracking coming from the other side of a bamboo <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">thicket, but attributed it
to the wind. The car took off and then stopped <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">about twenty feet up, the
noise from the bamboo was really creeping me out, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">so I walked up to see what
they were doing. As it turns out, the passenger <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">wanted to get out and walk
back with me because he didn't want to leave me <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"alone with the
ghosts". He got out and we started walking and the car sped <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">off into the night. The
first thing I noticed was how beautiful it was back <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there at night. The second
thing I noticed was a covered drainage ditch that <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">parrallelled the road which
apparently had a lot of water running through it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">forest noises, we contniued
to walk back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At a certain point we walked past a small
power plant which was fenced <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">off and had perimeter
illumination. After we passed it, I happened to notice <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that between the two of us
we cast three shadows on the pavement. One from <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">him, one from me and one
slightly to the left and behind me. At the time I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">thought it was a secondary
light source casting two shadows off of myself, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">but in retrospect I
realized that if that were the case there should have <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">been four shadows, two for
each of us, not three... We continued walking and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">eventually made it to the
middle gate without having any other sightings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Just a few blocks north of
Hammer Lane in Stockton, Ca. there is a house that had a family in it years
age. They had two small children. At a certain date there were no more
children, only the parents. Shortly thereafter they moved out. A friend of mine
rented the house. She kept noticing two small children playing in the back yard
but they would disappear when she would go to investigate. They would play
tricks on her in the bathroom. As my friend moved out she explained the tricks
to me. We put a roll of toilet paper on the toilet tank and left the house and
locked it as we moved some furniture to storage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We returned and hour later and the paper roll
had be moved to the counter top out of reach from the toilet. This is one of
the reasons she moved as this trick happened daily. I was asked to spend the
night there alone and I declined<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This happened to me in
95/96. My daughter was about 5 months old. Everyone was sleeping. I woke up
cause I heard my daughter starting to cry. I didn't want to just walk in there
, hoping she would go back to sleep, so I quietly went down stairs to use the
bathroom. When I went back up to check on her it was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>quiet,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I slowly peeked my head<span style="">&nbsp; </span>around
the corner, to see a baby sitting up looking out the window. At first I thought
it was her and started to go in there when I seen my daughter sleeping at the
other end of the bed, when I looked back it was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't scare me I checked on my daughter
and went back to bed..<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nexted
morning I told my husband, (He didn't believe me), He told his mom about it any
way, and she told him that when she was pregnant with his older sister they
lived ther. The baby was still born. My guess was the baby was watching out for
my daughter. After all it is her niece..<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a very true story it did happen and I know it did, I was there<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hello!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have two stories to tell about. The first
one is about my mother-in-law who died of uterus cancer only months before my
son4s birth. I had a very strange experience when my son was few monts old.
Namely, I was standing in front of the TV one day holding my baby son in my
arms in an upright position. Suddenly, I felt as if someone was standing behind
me, and suddenly my baby got very excited and started giggling and staring
behind me. The next moment I felt that that someone standing behind me was
putting hand around me as if trying to get hold of the baby and lift him over
my head. What is amazing is that it felt so real that I almost let my baby go,
but as I was about to do that I came out of trance or I don4t know how that
state could be called I was in. Thank god, I did not let him go, as he would
have dropped on the floor, as there was no one standing behind me! I was at
that time and I still am 100% per cent sure that it was my dead mother-in-law
and my son4s paternal grandmother, who had had hoped to live enough to see her
first grandchild, which she never did. She had had even asked about it from her
doctor whether of not she will live to see him, but the doctor had said no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always felt sad about it that she
never saw her first grandch<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">d and it is comforting to
think that it may have been her who came to see her grandson for the first and
last time.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another story is connected
with ghost stories. I was in my teens, and had my friends visiting me one
evening. At one point of time we started to share ghost stories, and one of my
friends claimed that she had had heard stange foot steps coming up the stairs
towards her room in her house. It was then that I came up with the ghost story of
my own, and said that I had had heard foot steps in the middle of the night in
my house, as well, which was, in fact, a lie. The rest of the evening went as
usual, but it was the next morning that a strange thing happened. I have a
bookshelf at my bed, and every night I put my glasses on top of it. The next
day I woke, however, I found my glasses covered with thick dust, but it was no
ordinary dust as there was no dust on the bookshelf the glasses had been on
during the night. I swept the dust away from the glasses with my fingers, but
there was no trace of the dust on my fingers after that, either. It seems that
the dust on the glasses served as a warning from our house spirit (I do believe
that every apartment and house has its own sprit), who was not happy about me
making up ghost stories on previous night. I simply have no other explanation
to that incident.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MM<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It all began on a winter
night as I started my shift as a security guard for a middle Tennessee hospital
for children as I walked my rounds making shore all doors where locked and all
was quit. I entered the receptions area and sat down to drink my coffee when I
looked up to see a man I guess,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>just
outside the windows I saw the figure as if he was trying to see inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As I made my way to the
doors and preceded to go outside to see if I could help him it was no more then
a few seconds to go throw the doors, he was no where to be seen and there was
no sound of anyone running off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
discounted my vision and all but forgot about that night, till a few days later
back on watch I was carrying some paperwork to the store room on the first
floor when the elevators opened and I heard a deep voice say my name and sounds
of steps moving away from me. to say the least I was frozen. dropping the
papers off I rushed up to the second floor to ask if anyone had used the
elevators. The charge nurse stated that no one had left the ward in about an
hour. When my supervisor showed up to do his nightly tour I relayed the story
his reply was I needed more coffee or some fresh air as you would think he
would say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This event took place
before I joined the NAVY for the last 16 years I have had countless encounters
with sounds,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>feelings of someone there
or watching me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I will start off by saying
I used to never belive in the paranormal til I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was 12 or 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There has always been the story that my Great
Aunts house was <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">haunted,which I never
believed but thats a whole nother story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mine starts <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">with<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my parents built a house about 11 years ago
and for the first few <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">years it was a normal house
but one day I was on my way to bed when I got <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">this chill and was suddenly
VERY scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I litteraly ran and junped
on my <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bed and covered my head til
I fell asleep. That was the first thing I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">everexperienced in this
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that I would lock my door
when I would <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">go to bed and I would wake
up to find my door open! (when none had been home <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to open it)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would also be in the living room watching
TV when I would <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hear loud thuds coming from
an area upstairs where nothing could be, because <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">it was by a cathederal
cieling. Other things happened with a hanging light, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I would look out of the
corner of my eye and see it lightly twisting (not <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">swinging,like someone
bumped it) and heard something like a light tapping on <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the thin glass bulbs,it did
this for several minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then got up
and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stoped it from swinging and
it stoped for a moment then started again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">parents have noticed things
also so I know I am not over reacting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The last <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">thing that happened made me
move out on my own. This happened about a year <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in bed asleep when I woke with this
overwhelming scared feeling. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I had a painful feeling,
something or someone sitting on my legs when I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">looked around I saw a
shadowy figure at the end of my bed.. I then began to <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">get the feeling I couldn't
breathe, the last thing I remember was being <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">pushed off my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My bed was up against the wall and I am
positive I didnt <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">fall out because when I got
up and went to tell my parents I had large <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bruises on my hip but on
the wrong side not the side I had fallen on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was just a little to scary
for me because up until then it was to the point <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I believed in the
paranormal but I didn't believe they could actually hurt <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">you. Now I know better. To
sum up my story the feeling I had of being <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">terrified only happened two
times and that was the first time I experienced <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">anything in that house and
the last time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think there might be
two <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">spirits one I feel is nice
and one I had the feeling it wasn't.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thank you <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have been given
permission to share this story with you about the place I used to work and the
cat on the third floor. She was before my time but she is still talked about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">She was the third floor pet
in this seniors home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This place is the
last stop for its residents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most go in
with a DNR signed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Since she was a kitten she
seemed to sense that although these people would act strangely sometimes they
meant no harm to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SHe was amazingly
patient and she was never one to scratch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">They always knew someone
was on their way out because of her though, and they always knew at least three
days in advance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pattern was always
the same. Suddenly the cat would be in this persons bedroom, she would leave to
eat and to use her litter box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Depending
on how the family and the person felt about cats in the room she would either
sleep by the head of the bed, alongside the person, half on them half off, or
at the foot of the bed keeping vigil but at a respectful distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was rare that family would get upset about
her being there though and they usually took as much comfort from her purring
and pleasantmeanor as the person dying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sometimes the cat would
know before the person themselves knew and they mostly thought that she was
just making her nightly rounds and saying hello.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">She would stay with the
person until they died and sometimes she was the only one in the room with them
when they did pass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the person was
gone she would stand in the doorway and meow in a shrill and persistent voice,
making the nurses pay attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
someone came to investigate her MO was to jump on the bed and sit at the foot
of it watching while the DON and the nurse pronopunced death and informed the
family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">She would stay in the room
until the body was removed if they allowed her to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not she stood vigil outside until the body
was taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It is almost supernatural
that the night she died she died in the bed of her favorite resident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman had been in the seniors home only a
month or so longer thsn the cat who they got from the pound at four months
old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an instant connection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she wasn't keeping vigil over the dying
residents she could be found in this womans room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her litter box and food were close by in a
closet with a pet door for her convenience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The night the cat died was
also the night the woman passed away. She died like she always said she wanted
to, in her sleep and with no fuss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were found on third round bed checks, her hand on the cats back and the cat was
curled in a ball beside her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have no idea why this cat
was the way she was, and the aides and nurses miss her still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They now have a pair of lovebirds as pets on
the floor and may one day get another cat for the residents, but that is a big
maybe, you just can't beat an animal like that one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In every other way she was
a perfectly normal animal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
smallish and had callico colors on her with a black ring around one eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have one photo album dedicated entirely
to her, lots of people have looked at it and all agree, she looked like she was
supposed to be there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I recently moved back to NE
Wisc. from Lawrence, KS. I am a church organist and when I was in Lawrence, I
would often borrow an Episcopalian Church's organ to practice on. A lot of the
time I felt as if someone was creeping up on me. Sometimes I would turn to look
at the altar area or various parts of the church, as the organ sits in the
balcony. I would often see various shadows fly around the front of the church.
The worst I saw was the last day I played there. I looked at the altar one time
and I saw a dark figure shaped like a friar. I felt this was weird seeings how
this was an Episcopalian Church and not a Catholic Church. Many of the
parishoners there told me that they would never go in there alone but denied
that the church was haunted when I reported seeing a white orb slowly move
around the naive. Locks on some of the sacristy doors would move back and forth
but nobody was in the church, nor did anyone or any figure I saw at least would
walk across the altar to get to either sacristy. I also walked past certain
pews that had a cold touch or feeling to them, and I twice had cold spots on
either side of me on the organ bench.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I left the church one
day, I noticed a mural on the wall near the door. It listed the history of the
Episcopalian Church and mentioned that the large stained glass window in the
back of the church was from the Nashotah house. The church was commissioned in
1859 after two years of construction and was completed with the Nashotah House
window being a donation from the Nashotah House and the Episcopalian Community.
I once knew of the Nashotah house being haunted with something else other than
the story listed on your site, and I think that the window from Nashotah
brought something with it. Several times the plaster rim around the window
would crack and crash to the ground interrupting my playing. I once helped with
the reconstruction of the plaster but the plaster still cracked and fell as if
someone were hitting it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I thought this story would
interest you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I also read about various
hauntings at Concordia University in Mequon. First of all, Concordia is run
like a High School social scene and many events that happen at the University
would probably upset the spirits if the spirits knew about these particular
actions. A friend of mine was expelled because of his race, other students were
also expelled when female residents of the Heidelburg dorm, who basically run
the social aspect and official discipline of the campus, would make up false
allegations. A lot of people are very nosy at this University and a lot of
people speak out about it profusely. When I attended, most of the students
expelled were from Augsburg. This still happens. Shortly after my friend was expelled
and the Vice President called his grandmother a "dirty n-----" on the
phone, a negative overtone embraced the first floor Augsburg Hall where he
lived. It was as if paranoia had set in as several other black, Indian, Asian,
and Middle Eastern men were expelled from that particu r dorm for just about no
particular reason. I was a student there for a semester and was shoved into the
Augsburg dorm. I did not recollect any sightings of paranormal activity, but I
did sense that something or someone was there hiding somewhere in the dorm. At
times there was an odd humming sound as if someone left an amplifier on at full
blast(I thought this noise came from the lights) and I felt a bit uneasy in the
main shower/bathroom on the first floor like someone was there to get me. I
thought it was either another student, someone waiting to pull some sort of
joke on me, or that there was an overwhelming phenomena that would send the
powers that be out to expell me as all others in my hallway were expelled. I'll
reiterate that I wasn't the only one who felt this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I sometimes felt that
someone else was there protecting me as well. I usually felt such prescence
when I had the shower curtain shut, when I was drying myself after the shower,
or when I had my door closed and locked. I also encountered people as I roamed
the halls and underground tunnels late after playing basketball in the gym that
would disappear after passing me and exchanging the casual "hello,"
these were often women dressed in athletic attire, young and rather pretty. The
only noises I heard were intermittant scraping noises as if someone was
scraping the wall outside with a key or long fingernails and I got a few light
knocks on the door to find noone outside when I looked through the peephole.
These noises would show up aroung midnight or four in the morning. There would
be nobody outside my room or anyone I heard walking down the hall. Other than
the scrapes and knocks, I feel that some of this was due to my paranoia of
being the next victim of the Heidelburg dorm as some women from that dorm got
me expelled from the female dorms in a missunderstanding. I did hear of wierd
thing happening in the Wittenburg dorm but nothing out of the ordinary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">If there is anyone who has
spoke to you about residence in Augsburg with similar events, please do not
take these lightly. I'm sure if there is something there that is affected by
current events, it definately was affected when the University extremely
angered the alumni by throwing $500K at President Bush to speak at the 2004
commencement ceremony. Concordia is a school which I believe should be either
shut down or seriously looked at by an ethics committee prior to some major
housecleaning. The staff that disciplines attempts to get into everyone's
business which legally they have no right to do as several of the teachers have
protested such acts. If there are spirits there that consistantly haunt those
who spend time on the campus, I feel they are hinting towards similar action in
aid to those who are making casual protest of what occurs in the main offices.
With that being said, I am not trying to run down this University but I feel
some of the actions taken by this University may quite possibly be the cause to
the continued haunting. I believe a spirit haunts until justice is served for
either themselves, the entities around them, or the people around them and a
spirit haunts during times of wrongdoing and corruption. Concordia University
has severe corruption.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As for the encounters in
the Chapel, I had none I can remember. However I would practice at night
because there were a lot of organ students and few organs. That meant I was
forced to practice at odd hours. I usually found myself playing and waiting for
security to check in every hour or so. It always seemed as if they were
checking for something and several times I had security tell me that they had
gotten a report saying someone was walking down the main hallway outside the
Chapel. Although it wasn't the nun that was fabelled in your excerpt, it was a
tall man in his early twenties and the description did not fit mine at all. I
saw no such person nor heard such footsteps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was curious as to the
Church in St. Nazianz, I read at the W-Files site that someone went into the
church after swinging the cracked door open and ducking the bar lock. He went
into the naive first mentioning a mural mysterious lit up by sunlight, going
through a few cold rooms in the back of the naive, and receiving an hour long
massive headache for all his exploring. Again, the posting is on the W-Files.
The guy said the mural on the wall was lit up by direct sunlight although the
scource of the light could not be found. I was wondering if you had any other
history of the Catholic Church outside of Father Oswald(this wasn't his church
was it?). I feel that the only possibility that something lingered here was
that someone let it linger here by closing the school and church down and
refusing donations. The information I have is all from the W-Files. I know the
new owners prohibit visitation so I was wondering if you possibly had some
information to elaborate on what was posted on the W-Files.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I think I've covered

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My old house is located in
Pasadena Md.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house is still standing
what is left of it. It was build by slaves and we were born in this house. My
mom had a mid wife. My dad was 44years older then my mom so I got alot of
stories from him and saw things myself as a child and adult. We would here
vocies everytime my dad try to fix the house up. He said it was the cries of
the slaves they didn't like us messing with there house. Once a black man
appeared to me in ragged clothes I was about 6. He told me his blood went into
this house along with many others and they never got to sleep in it until now.
I was afraid but he told me he would never hurt me or my family but leave the
house alone. He said we could fix the roof to keep the rain off but if they
didn't like it they would put more holes in the roof. My dad was aways fixing
the roof. When I was 10 or 12 me and my cousin went upstair a a room we called
the dark room. Mom said to keep out of there because there was a fire before I
was born and Dad never fixed it back up and the floor was weak from the fire
and rain. So after years of wondering me and my cousin went in this room and
there was 3 other rooms. The darkroom was the one still black from the smoke
and the other rom was a bed room but we didn't go in it because the floor had
holes in it becase of the fire. The other room over top of our kitchen looked
like another kitchen to me. As we looked around the room I looked onto the
floor and said oh my god and my cousin said to me with a frighten look on her
face, and said do you see a man to ? We both ran out of the room and went to my
Mom and told her what we saw. We both saw Jesus nailed to the floor with blood
running from his head hands and feet. We didn't know this was Jesus until my
Mom said that is who we described. We never went to church, my Mom told us
about God watching over us But never about how Jesus died. She made my Dad go
up there and look with us and when we got back up there the only thing he saw
was something red. He went over and touched it and it was still wet. He told me
and My cousin it was red paint. We knew deep down it was a lie because no one
was allowed in this part of the house and who would be painting on burnt walls,
what was left of a wall. Years later when my Dad died and his spirit was
roaming the house. My cousin and I brought up about what we saw as kids and my
Mom told us that Dad told her the Red paint was blood. He said it was proubly
from animails fighting. But Mom always beleived in her heart it was jesus we
saw. I have alot more stories my Dad told me but these are ones I know I saw or
herd. Til this day I still go and look at the old house and I know my Dad still
remains in that house I think that is why me and my sisters always have this
dream of getting the old place aback and building 3 houses on it so we can
always remain close. But that is a dream unless we hit the lottery. The things
I said are true and unless you experinced it yourself you will always think it
is a wise tale. Back when I was a kid if you saw something you were crazy so
you were told to keep it hush hush. But now more stories are coming out and
they are finding out that there is life after death. My Mom told me because my
Dad never really beleived in god that is why he was having a hard time finding
his way to heaven. I really don't know all I hope is he is resting in peace
now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This experience happened to
a friend of mine when a child in 1968. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Mike and his family were
then living in a house in Hanwell, West London, England. His parents still live
there. When Mike and his sister were youngsters, they wanted to learn to play
the piano. Their dad bought them a second-hand piano after seeing one offered
for sale. It belonged to two old ladies, and they wanted a quick sale. At
first, things were okay, but after a while odd things began happening - gas
jets on the stove would be left on and water taps would be left running. The
family thought that they had been absent-minded, and thought nothing of it. As
time went on though, more deliberate ghostly acts came about - the music holder
on the piano would rock back and forth with unseen hands, the lid would slam
down without anyone being anywhere near it and glimpses of a male ghost was
seen in the room where the piano was kept. Perhaps the most eerie thing that
happened was when Mike was alone in the house one weekend. He heard the piano
play one note, all night long. Pam, Mike's sister, was the focus for the
haunting because she was the one who used the piano more than anyone. She was
physically attacked at least twice by unseen hands in the middle of the night,
and curtains in her bedroom would blow when no windows were open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The incidents became so bad
that it was felt that the piano had a ghost that had come with it, so Mike's
dad contacted the old ladies who sold it to him. They confessed that they had
bought the piano from a junk shop and were themselves assaulted by the ghostly
acitivities, so they decided to sell it. Mike's dad thought it odd that at the
time when the piano was delivered, one lady said to the other, 'Do you think
that this will end it?' <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The piano was taken round
the back of the house, broken up and burned on a bonfire. The ghost never
returned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Gold Camp Road - The
tunnels along the road are haunted by the spirits who built the in the 1800's,
the road was originally a railroad from Colorado Springs to cripple creek but
was the tracks were later removed to allow for transportation by car. In the
late 70's a school bus of elementary kids were taking a field trip up the road.
With that said, you must realize that Gold Camp Road is a narrow, dirt road,
winding around sharp corners across the mountainside. Tunnels had to be dug
through the mountain in 3 different locations to allow the train tracks to be
laid. The true story follows. As the bus approached the third tunnel, rocks and
boulders began to slide down the mountain, slamming into the bus.. Most people
assume that the driver probably feared being knocked off course by the boulders
and took shelter inside the tunnel. Unfortunately, the boulders were shifting d
to an earthquake, which caused the tunnel to collapse around the bus,
suffocating all inside. To this day, the tunnel has never been fully dug out.
It is still closed off, though most of the debris has been removed. The
evidence that this is true, is there in the tunnel. When workers began to dig
the bodies out, they realized that the roof of the now demolished bus, was the
only thing keeping the tunnel from crumbling completely. If you dare to wiggle
through the hole(someone else was curious) in the chain link fence that now
surrounds the tunnel, you will see the roof of the school bus, hanging from the
top of the cave like tunnel. It has been attached firmly to beams, in an effort
to keep the roof of the tunnel up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

longer. When my parents got news of this, they made arrangements to go to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sydney</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> to be by
his bedside. My grandma stayed with the kids in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Melbourne</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">That first night that my
parents were gone, my sister woke in the middle of the night to use the
bathroom. She was sitting there with the door wide open when she saw a tall
thin man with a large nose walk past the hall in front of her, about 2 metres
away. There were no sounds. But she said that he sort of slowed down, looked in
her direction, then continued down the hall out of sight. She started screaming
at the top of her lungs, and grandma came running. My sister told her what she
saw, but grandma told her it was her imagination but seemed a bit concerned. Of
course, my sister stayed up all night and didnt sleep a wink.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The next morning, my
grandma got the phone call from my dad stating that grandpa had passed away.
All that my grandma could mutter was I know! When dad asked How did you
know? Did someone already call? My grandma explained He was here last night.
Irene saw him. It was confirmed that my sister saw him around the time he did
pass away. He also passed away before my mum and dad could get to him on time.
My parents believe that he went to our house coz he thought no one came to be
with him, so he wanted to say goodbye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My mum used to tell me that
after grandpas death, she would often smell aftershave in the house. Because
she never knew him long enough, she didnt know if it was his or not. Grandma
never mentioned anything about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Now, fast forward to the
day my grandma passed away..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The events that happened
that afternoon were quite strange. I will explain. My mother was picking my
oldest sister up from school. But this time, for some strange reason, she was
not there so my mother drove around the school block. When she pulled over in
her usual parking spot, my sister was there this time.. My mum got out of the
car to help put her school bag and stuff into the boot. When my mum got back
into her car, her rearview mirror was pointing straight up but my sister denied
touching it. So mum starts the car to make her way home. Suddenly my mum had
this urge to drive past her house and not go home just yet. She said that she
had NO idea why, she just had a feeling to keep on driving..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">While this was happening,
my sister Irene who was the second youngest and my brother Nick who is about 4
years younger were at home. They knocked on the door but to them, it was strange
that grandma was not home. She always greeted them. So my sister did a weird
thing. She climbed through the laundrys open window, but instead of having the
sense to open the back door, she runs to the front door to open that instead.
Its like some force is preventing her for doing the logical thing. After she
lets my brother in at the front, she goes to her bedroom. The strange thing
here is that my grandma is laying on the floor, dead. There is NO way you could
miss it. But she went into her room, then went out and went outside to play for
a little while with my brother Nick until dad came home. THEN, its like she
goes into overdrive and frantically calls dad to follow her and then runs to
the spot grandma was laying. My sister does not recall seeing her there but
when she was outside, she subconsciously knew what happened. She believes that
her body shut down to prevent her going hysterical coz she was VERY close to
grandma. Then dad does CPR but it is way too late. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Soon, mum comes home,
finding dad sitting on the front steps with my brother and sister crying. She
knew right away what happened. She also must have sensed something was wrong
coz she didnt come home. Mum remembers always telling grandma and people that
she NEVER wants to find a dead body. So maybe somehow grandma arranged these
strange events for no one to really find her at the wrong time. Like my sister,
she didnt find her until dad came home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then things started to
happen. They would see shadows, especially in the hallway where she died. My
two sisters and my mother BOTH claim to have seen her shadow sitting in her
favourite rocking chair. You could even see the imprint. My sister Irene was
terrified to ever sit in that chair, coz she didnt like the thought of sitting
on grandma knowing she was there in the chair but not being able to see her.
Also while they watched TV or went to bed, theyd hear someone washing up in
the kitchen. It was freaky coz grandma would do that but she was no longer
alive and they heard it, and everyone was accounted for. So it had to have been
her ghost. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then about a year later, I
was born. I was a few months old when my sister had this strong urge to go
look at the baby to discover I was blue. Mum slapped me and put me under the
cold water until I got a fright and started to breath again. My sister cant
explain that overwhelming urge to check on me. Good thing she had, otherwise I
would have been a ghost in that house as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I would also talk to the
air as though I was looking at someone. I would laugh and giggle. When I was
old enough to walk, I would be afraid of the hallway where grandma passed away.
I would be convinced someone lived in the hallway. Why would a toddler think
that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Well, a few years later we
moved out many years later when I was in my early 20s, we went back to the
house. We looked at the registry to see how many families have lived in that
house and there were over 25 in the past 20 years so no one ever stayed long.
We believe the place to be haunted by my grandparents. My sisters did tell me
that grandma had promised that she will never leave the family coz she loved
them too much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Okay.. all this happened in
the early 70s. Now I will fast forward to the night my own mother passed away.
I got word through email on Wednesday after lunch time about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="14"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> or so that my mother wasnt well,
that they thought she had a heart attack. I was away in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sydney</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> for 2
weeks, but this was only the first week away. I was quite worried but was told
that she did go to the doctor and got the all clear that it wasnt a heart
attack. Needless, I still called home. My mother answered. She sounded really
weak. We had a short conversation but she said she had to go otherwise the call
will be too expensive for me. Even being as sick as she was, she was still
concerned about me. I t d her that I hope she will get better soon, and she
said I hope so too then hung up. I called her just before 3pm or so. By
5:00pm I was feeling really restless and had this bad feeling.. but I brushed
it away, convincing myself that my mother will be alright. By the time 6:45pm
rolled around, I was overwhelmed by a sad feeling. Kinda like the one a small
child gets when they first start school and have to be away from their mother.
Something came over me that I started to bawl my eyes out and feeling really
homesick and frightened. But it wasnt until around 7:30pm or so that my
brother called with the horrible news. It took them a while to find this number
coz we were staying at my bfs parents house. When I was told that it was my
brother, many thoughts rushed through my mind. I knew then that what was
about to happen, wasnt good. Then his voice spoke the agonising words mums
died. My world fell apart. I think I must have felt my mothers presence or
sadness coz she died around 6:15pm that night. And soon afterwards I was
bawling with that overwhelming feeling of missing my mother. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I returned home, I
didnt sense her in the house though. I usually sense when there is something
there. But a couple of times, something did happen. Like one night, coming out
of my room. And as I entered the dark hallway, something seemed to be flashing
in front of my eyes. Kinda like a fluttering. I saw it as plain as day and it
was there for about 5 seconds or so before the hall became dark again as my
eyes adjusted to the darkness. But this only happened to be that one time so I
doubt its from coming out of a light room into the dark coz I done that
countless of times and never had that. Before she died, dad said he has been
dreaming a lot about water but I think he was dreaming about what will happen
to him. Next story. The night my dad died, just a short 6 months later, only a
few days after my mothers birthday would have been.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Two weeks after my mother
died, dad discovered a lump in his breast. In was confirmed a few days later
that he had advanced cancer. Lung cancer we knew now, but they never told my
dad that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Okay, dad was in hospital
and around 8:45pm, my brother was in the kitchen. He said that while he was
there by the window he saw something very shiny, but kinda like smokey and
full height of a person and solid enough move along the wall. It all happened
within 2 or so seconds, but he more or less saw it from the corner of his eye.
He didnt think much of it. Then he went back to his computer in his room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I came out around 9:52pm. I
remember looking at the chair where my dad would normally sit at the kitchen
table and became overwhelmed with grief. I thought to myself I will never see
my dad sitting there again. Then I started bawling, then went back to my own
computer and continued chatting to a few online friends about my concerns about
my father. It was only about 5 minutes later that the call came. They told us
the bad news that dad passed away. HOWEVER, we didnt learn until the next
morning that he died around 9:42pm, and I was bawling only 10 minutes AFTER as
if I knew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">But we didnt know the time
dad died so my brother and I were discussing the thing he saw around </span><st1:time minute="45" hour="20"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">8:45pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. Not only that, mums clock in
the living room stopped exactly </span><st1:time minute="46" hour="20"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">8:46pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> so THAT
was double weird.. but 2 weeks later was working again. Weird Anyhow, back to
the story. When we had learnt that dad died an HOUR after my brother saw the
apparition, we knew it was our mother who had come. She had a habit of being
early for EVERYTHING, be it picking me up from school, the mall or anything she
would always be there early. She must have come for my dad that night.. but
maybe she didnt realise he was in hospital.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Dad actually ended up
dieing from Phemonia. Remember how I said he has been dreaming a lot about
water lately. Perhaps he pre-saw his own death. From then on taps in their
ensuit would turn on by itself. So many times I would go in there and the water
will be off. I would go back later and the water will be running. One time I
was sitting at my computer in the study when I could just make out movement
walk past the study door going into the living room. I somehow sensed it was my
dad. Just the way it moved. My room was pretty dark but my computer was bright
enough to make out movement. I went to check it out but found nothing. I felt a
bit uneasy going into my parents room though that was in that direction as
well. But I worked up the courage and went.. but found nothing. But I did pick
up a huge sense of emptiness sadness. Maybe I was channelling in on his
feelings? I dont recall feeling my mother in the house though after dads
death.. but often the house felt empty but it was like he would visit
sometimes but wasnt always there. AM I making any sense?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I did hear some sounds
though, and my dads radio would switch on all by itself.. but ALWAYS after
11:15pm at night between that time and 3:00am. It would be really loud. Maybe
he was feeling lonely or didnt even know he was gone?! We moved out soon
afterwards though.. financial reasons though. But I know they are alright. I
believe in the afterlife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sorry for this story being
so long but I was compelled to write about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
