<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">On
the
weekend of May 1-3, I had my 45th High School reunion at the Belleview <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Biltmore.
Several of us were sitting on one of their porches Friday night and a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">window
on
the 4th floor happened to catch my eye.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lights in that particular room <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">went
off
and on about every 15 seconds during the whole 2 hours that we were <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">sitting
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lighting seemed more like a
glow, starting with a soft light and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">ending
with
much more intense light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was almost
like it was playing with us....if <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
said,
"Now it's on", it would immediately go off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
I said, "It's off again", <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">immediately
it would go on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I mentioned it the
next day to a couple of <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">employees
about what we had seen, they both paled and asked me again exactly on <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">what
side
of the building were we were sitting on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They both then said at the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">exact
same
time, that the electricity to that wing we were looking at up on the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">4th

had "been turned off getting ready for our renovation".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
attended
Pasadena High school from the years 1997-2000 and have witnessed things
in the
auditorium that are in line with the information that you have already.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">If
you are
in the catwalk (the catwalk has since been reinforced to prevent
accidents)
adjusting the lights, a faint hand will tug you from behind to ensure
you do
not fall. (there are only two operators at a time on the cat walk,
nither near
the other) If you are in the sound booth alone, you will hear whistling
of
"old macdonald" or another childrens tune. There are also instances
of machinery not working properly and lights being re-directed from the
catwalk. (The catwalk is mostly machine operated now so students do not
often
go up there) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Back
in
the early 40's-60's, the girls dressing room was on the basement level
and the
boys was upstairs. During performances, we would find costumes and
makeup kits
missing from the dressing rooms. When located, the articles would be in
the
opposite dressing room. (The high school is now surrounded by a
perimiter fence
and requires photo identification and permission to enter.)<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If you walk alone or with a small
group (no
more than 3-4 people) and are really quiet, you can hear the girl
tapdancing
and humming a song. You also see the props behind the rear stage move
on
occasion. (This may be the janitor) There are also times where the
floor would
be wet as if just cleaned when no one is there for cleaning.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Another
place that is supposedly haunted is the Richey Elementary school, (now
the
Lorenzo De Zavala 5th Grade center). Rumors of shadows where no one is,
and
whispers when you are alone. Supposedly, when the hurricane's hit the
area in
the 1900's A child drowned in the flooding in the basement and can be
heard
giggling. (*This school is fenced in and requires permission to enter.)
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Also
in
Pasadena, there is a chemical plant (Was Phillips now Conoco/Phillips)
that has
had several accidents. A friends parent worked in the area that
exploded in
1998-1999 that killed several workers. There are employees that say
that if
they are working a teardown at night they see shadows and have tools
dissapear
at random and show up elsewhere when there is no one around. (**This is
a
secure area, tresspassers will be arrested**)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Last
year
15 teachers from across the United States met on an island off the
coast of
Maine for a week of education, exploring the geology of the area and
marine
life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>Two nights before we left we were all in the
main house and two teachers had gone down to the dock about 9 PM to see
the
night skies and stars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two other
teachers, myself and a principal decided to have a little fun and try
and scare
the two would be star gazers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mind you ,
we both are men and thought we would not scare easy and never gave it a
second
thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>We walked quietly down a drive through a
heavily wooded area in the dark so they would not see us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Suddenly
without warning we both who were about 15 feet apart were surrounded by
spinning whispers of white light, when we would turn they spun around
us even
more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no harm but I must tell
you we were so frightened, we began yelling and shouted to get out of
there
immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ran up the hill and the
orbs were directly behind us, we never stopped yelling until we reached
the
main house, ran in and bolted the doors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>There were other teachers sitting in the
lounge and they were astonished as to our looks, our faces were beat
red, we
were hyperventilating, scared, they all knew something was wrong.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We told them our story and each looked at the
other in amazement, none of us slept well that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>The two teachers returned from star gazing and
asked what was wrong as they heard yelling and such, we told them the
story and
the next day they themselves were confronted with suitcases just moving
by
themselves in the upstairs dorm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>The night before we left our director who is a
wonderful, informed instructor told us more of previous classes that
had seen,
encountered, or heard of these occurrences.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said she was always reluctant to tell the guests as to not
scare
them off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>The island has a lighthouse that has been
there for over 200 years and the tales from that era need to be
documented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been a skeptic all
these years but have an open mind, personally no one can ever tell me
different
from that night on, they do exist.....................we are all sane
and
educated people, there were no drugs or alcohol involved to enhance any
of
these happenings. This is the flat, unadulterated truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">First
things first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ethel was my husbands
sister and my best friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She and I
went whale watching every chance we got.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was my traveling buddy and was always ready to go when I was.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She passed July 26, 2002.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After she passed we decided to make a tribute
to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had kept 2 small 6 oz. jars of
her ashes to scatter a pinch here and there in the Islands.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>And every time we did this, we would write a
small, 4 lined poem of where we were. Then we would take pictures.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>From the 19th of April to May 2nd of 2003 we
scattered her ashes on Kaui and Maui.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Close to the end of our trip, my husband, son, daughter-in law
and my
self went on a dinner cruise in Maui.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were told that the whales hadn't been seen for about a week so we
weren't
expecting any sightings. When everyone was up stairs getting ready to
eat, I
slipped below to the port side of the boat to scatter a pinch of her
ashes.
When I turned around a Humpback whale was spy hopping right next to the
boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see his eye looking at
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just smiled and said hello
Ethel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I went upstairs in utter
astonishment. And of course the camera was up top deck with my husband.
So I
ended up painting what I saw. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
is
how the tribute went that very unusual evening.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We
took a
dinner cruise the last night we were here: But what we didn't know, was
the
humback whales were near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The
whale
watch tours had been cancelled earlier today. Everyone thought they
were gone,
and now far away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">As
the sun
was setting, I took a walk below; It was time again to let a little of
you go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">As
soon as
I released you into the breeze and into the sea; A Humpback Whale spy
hopped,
close enough, as if to see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It
was
incredible; He was so close you see. It was like he took a moment to
come and
spy on me.This was something special, a gift you might say.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Or maybe it was a sign to let us know that
you are okay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to this day that she is ok and it was a sign.<span style="">&nbsp;

open, my mom and dad walking around, keys clinging, chairs being pushed

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">home
because I had a litter of puppies at the time. It was about 7pm this
one
evening. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
sitting on the floor in a back bedroom. I had the puppies with me. Out

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
hear
this voice of a young girl go "w-h-e-r-e-s<span style="">&nbsp;

alone.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">windows

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">room.
He
got up and went to the bathroom at the end of the hallway. I woke up
when he <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">went
past
the family room. He gets in the bathroom, he has the door open. I hear
a little

go
"Dad". There is just this dead silence my Husband comes flying in by
me. He sits right <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">next
to me
and whispers "did you hear that?" I started to whisper back and my

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">goes

very fast and happily it lasted about 6-8 seconds and stopped. We

all alone
on my hands and knees planting these barley plants. I couldn't figure

am
really surprised when I read that people have only had one experience.
I am 40
and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">have
had
this all my life. As I read these I like to post some of my most
memorable
ones. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
one
happened when I was 12. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
Grandpa
Hansen had died. He just came home from running errands, sat on the
front <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">step
and
had a heart attack. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
Grandparents lived in a small house, just out of Milwaukee. The
downstairs of
the house <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
very
small. The house had a loft upstairs, that was their bedroom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
Dad
told my sister and I to go visit Grandma one Saturday afternoon. She
was not
fairing <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">well
after
her Husbands death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It
had
been about 3 months since his passing. We went over and sat down in the
family <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">room
with
Grandma. We were chatting for probably 30 minutes, when I heard the
ceiling <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">creaking.
I looked up and over at my sister her eyes were like saucers. The
creaking <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">became
more and more obvious. I mean you could hear the foot steps going
across the
floor <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">up
in that
bedroom. This went on for about 10 minutes. My sister and I looked at
my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Grandma,
her hearing aid is beeping and she's fiddling with it. She is crying
saying I
miss him <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">so
much,
this dam hearing aid and on and on. While she is doing all of this, the
foot
steps <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">just
keep
going on and on. My sister and I were speechless. We just made that eye
contact
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">like
do
not say anything to her. It finally stopped and we decided to leave. We
kissed
her <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">good
bye.
When we got in the car my sister and I just both started saying holy
cow
Grandpa <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Hansen's
upstairs, I can not believe this. My sister goes look up and see if he
is in
the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">window,
I
am to afraid to. I did not see anything as we drove away. My sister and
I grew
up <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">in
that
house. This was no boards settling this was my Grandpa up there. I just
sit and
think <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">about
Grandma. She lived 10 years after him. She cried over him daily. If she
only
knew he <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
just
right upstairs the whole time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">A
final
note. The day before my Grandma died, she told my Dad that she has to
go make <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">lunch
for
her Husband he is waiting. She then asked him to get her a new dress.
She fell <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">asleep
and
my Dad had left. He got the call the following day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

on a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">see
some

back to
sleep. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">decided
to
go ahead and leave early from my home in So Cal to miss traffic. By
early I
mean just after 1am. I drive up listening to George Noory on the radio.
The
time goes by very fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
pull off
the 101 freeway at Buellton about 4:15am and pull into Tom's Gas (open
24hrs)
to fill <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">up.
It's
dead quiet out and very dark. The sound of the keypad beeps on the gas
pump
sound like it is echoing for miles. There is also a fog or mist hanging
in the
air. It's the marine layer that rolls in off the ocean. No one else is
out or
on the road. I can't get over how quiet it is up there that time of
morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
pull out
of the gas station and continue on to the Danish Village of Solvang a
couple of
miles <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">up

down to
about <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">10-15mph.

from the middle <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the

about
16-18 years old, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">about

warm
up pants-like <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">basketball
players use. He had a shaved head, like with a #1 or #2 razor. When I
first saw
him run I thought *that's weird(that anyone is out this time of
morning)*.
There were no cars in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">parking
lot and no one else around. He just ran to the wall, stopped at the
edge, bent
over with <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">his
back
to me and his hands on his knees, and vanished. I looked back a couple
of
times, not <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">believing

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">didn't
just happen...*, but it did. The parking lot and sidewalk next to the
wall of
the building <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">were
pretty well lit. I saw it all in unbelievable detail. I continue

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">local
Mexican food place. It looks good and is very close to the hotel. I
decide to
go there <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">instead.
Call it fate for what happens next...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>The Mexican food place is called Rudy's. It is
located in a shopping center just behind Tom's Gas where I stopped in
the
morning to fill up. It's a small chain that operates in the Santa
Barbara area,
about 6 locations total. I drive over and park in front. it's about 3pm
and I
am the only customer there. I walk in. A tall Hispanic man is the chef
working
back in the kitchen, looking very stern and professional, wearing a
chef
uniform and a tall chef hat too. A young Hispanic lady works the front
counter.
They are the only people in the restaurant other than me. I order my
food and a
Pacifico beer and grab a table in the front. I sit down and notice a
fresh
salsa bar toward the back on the right. I walk back to check it out.
They have
4 kinds of salsa and 6 kinds <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">of
hot
sauce. Nothing is labeled. How can I know which is which or which to
take?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Since
there are no other customers in the restaurant and the 2 workers can't
see me,
I decide to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">slyly
dip
a finger in each sauce to taste it, thinking no one will see me do it.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">After
about 3 tastings, I look up to the right and see a young Hispanic man
staring
right at me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">His
reflection is being reflected off the polished or chrome mirror finish
of a
large box-like piece <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">of
equipment on the front counter, I think it was a counter top convection
oven.
All I can think is <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">"Oops...I'm
caught!*. He looks away smiling. The face was normal life size. I look
straight
ahead <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">for
an
instant then back to the right again. His image was gone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
walk
back to my table in front thinking it must have been the chef...but he
was in
the back and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">this
reflection had to come from the front. I sit down and the chef and lady
are
exchanging <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">words
in
Spanish about something....We are still the only three living people in
the
restaurant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
realized
the face in the mirror finish was not wearing a chef hat. That he was
younger
than the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">chef
too.
A lot younger. That he had a shaved head with just very short hair.
That he was
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">wearing
a
white t-shirt. That there was no one else in the restaurant. That the
chef and
lady were having an argument when I saw the face smiling at
me...OMG...now I'm
really freaked out. I take a long drink of my Pacifico and look around.
I then
realize the connection with what I saw <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">in
the
early morning. This Hispanic teenage ghost is messing with me, playing
with me.
Not in a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">malicious
way, but in a mischievous way.After I eat, I drive back to my hotel
just in a
daze. Wow, there was no denying what had happened today. Someone wanted
me to
see him and I did. Twice! Totally unexpected. Totally out of the blue.
Both
times. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">my
husband
and myself and my brother were all watching our mothers house while she
was out
of town on vacation. we had been there for a few days and all happened
to be in
on this particular evening and night.well we had finished dinner and we
were
all just hanging out in the living room watching t.v. my brother said
he was
just gonna sleep on the couch and my husband and i said goodnight and
went to
bed in my mothers bedroom because thats where we had been sleeping.we
kissed
goodnight like usual and turned off the bedside lamp.i myself just cant
close
my eyes and go right off to sleep so i was just lying there looking off
into
the darkness trying to wind down. suddenly i noticed a very, i mean
very dark black
mass by the bedroom door. i blinked my eyes a few times trying to make
them
adjust to the darkbetter but realized they already had because i could
make out
the mass that was so much darker than the dark. i began to feel afraid
when i
saw it moving.i laid there and watched it approach the bed <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">over
our
bodies, it looked larger than it had by the door. ibegan to nudge my
husband
but i decided to lay there a little longer to see if it continued to
move or
get larger.i lay there and marveled at its denseness and its extremely
dark
color as opposed to the regular darkness.it was pitch black and just
floated
there above us. unbelievably i fell to sleep. the next day at lunch my
brother
said 'hey, last night i saw the weirdest thing when i was trying to
fall asleep
a large black mas was hovering above my head and scared me half to
death! i
stuck my hand in it and it was freezing cold!" befor i had a chance to
speak my husband said"me to! i thought i was seeng things"i spoke up
and said i saw it as well and was frightened by it , they both said wow
i
wonder what it was.ihad read somewhere that those could possibly be
evil.needless to say we did'nt spend the night there again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">sally<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>was a niece of Mrs.Thornton who lived in the
carter
mansion. it was then called the Thornton place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">while
visiting her aunt, sally became very if. possibly the flu. she died.
they
buried her on the property there at the Thornton place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Mrs..
Thornton rented out rooms later on, and one night sally appeared
standing at
the foot of a man's bed. she told him the storm had knocked ther
tombstone over
and wanted him to come and fix it.the next morning the man told
Mrs.Thornton
about it and they went to see and sure enough the storm had toppled
over sally's
tombstone. the man left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">she
also
disliked smokers. she would throw ashtrays in the rooms of those that
did.
empty them also.the Thornton place sold to a developer and the graves
were
moved. they built houses on the grounds there. but when the decorators
were
fixing up the mansion, sally did not like it! she would throw the
accent
pillows about; the next day the women would come back to finish the job
only to
find even the furniture had been moved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
Thornton house is the club house now. I guess they have named it the
carter
mansion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">when
I was
in high school, we would park in the church parking lot and walk
through the
woods to her grave. it was said back then that she didn't like anyone
with the
name Nancy and if you wore a pearl you would not have it when you
returned to
the car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">other
people who stayed in the Thornton house, had reported seeing and
passing a
young woman on the stairway. when inquired about her they were told it
was just
sally and the guest would leave! hope this has been insightful. I was
born and
raised here in Huntsville.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">strange
things happen in our care home. I understand with caring for the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">elderly
sometimes strange things occur in doing this for almost a decade. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Recently
I
had a resident that started to decline at the age of 93. One night <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">after
helping her get into bed she asked me if Bernie (her husband, who died <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">10
years
before) knew where she was. I reassured her that he did, it caught me <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">off
guard
since her mind was intact and she was not forgetful. A week went by <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">and
again
I assisted the woman into bed, she said to me, "I hear Bernie in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">hallway.
Can you tell him that I'm in here?" I told her to call for him and he <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">would
come
in. She refused and asked me to, so I went out to the empty hallway <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">and
said,
"Bernie, E. Is in here if you would like to visit with her." As a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">nurse,
sometimes you do things out of the better judgment for yourself as long
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">as
it
helps your patient. Later that night I heard the lady talking to no one
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">quietly.
I
have had some odd things happen in my personal life through the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">years
since
childhood, but that is another story. I was once told by an older <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">japanese
woman not to talk to the dead or invite them into my home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Another
week goes by and my resident took a drastic turn for the worse by <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">refusing
to eat or drinking fluids. After a week stay in the hospital she <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">returned
on comfort cares and hospice. The end was near and we knew it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">However,
while she was in the hospital I got a frantic call from one of our <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">nursing
assistants asking if I would please come back to work because she was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">really
scared. When I got to work all the lights in the house were on and she <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
sitting on the couch with her back up against the wall. When I asked
what <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
wrong
she told me wide eyed and pale that she had seen a mist down at the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">end
of one
of the hallways and was hearing weird popping noises coming from <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
residents room that was in the hospital. After checking the entire
house <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">and
silently saying the 'Lord's Prayer'. The house felt calm. E. spent her <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">last
days
being pampered and shown caring and compassion from staff and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">family.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
mother
passed away June 5th 2007. Me and my husband was in New Jersey at the
time <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">waiting
to
get unloaded( we drove a 18 wheeler for a living). My sister had called
me the
day <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">before
and
told me that my mom was in a coma and the home health people said she
only had <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">about
24
hours to live and that I needed to come home. So I called our
dispatcher and
said we <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">needed
to
be routed back to the chattanooga terminal so that I could see my mom
before
she <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">passed.
He
said no problem after you and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>your
husband has those tires put on, go pick up that <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">load
and
head for chattanooga. Well while they was putting tires on our trailer
we
decided to get <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">some
sleep. The cell phone rang and it was my sister. She told me that mom
had come
out of it <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">and
was
sitting up eating and laughing and talking to everybody and that she
was ok. So
I called <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">my
dispatcher and said we don't have to go home we can do one more load
out here.
so it was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">late
that
night when they finally got the tires on the trailer and we decided to
just
stay there in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
parking lot til morning so we could get some needed sleep. We get up
that
morning and pull <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">out.
As we
are heading down the highway my cell rings and it is my sister just
crying like
I ain't <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">never
heard before and she tells me that mom passed away that morning
early.So to
make it a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">little
shorter our dispatcher gets us home thirty six hours later. Now<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>at this time we are at my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">mothers
house and she has already been picked up by the funeral home before we
got <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">there.Sometime
later that day my husbands cell phone rings while we are nowhere near
it to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">answer
it.
So when we do pick it up to see if our dispatcher has called it shows
we have
one <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">voice
mail
and no number,so my husband listens to the voice mail and it is my
mother the
day <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">after
she
died.(the message said)- Connie this is your mother call me! We checked
to see
if it was a delayed message but it wasn't I even took it the cell phone
company
and they said it was June 6th at 1:25 in the afternoon. My mom died
June 5th
2007 at the times between 1:00Am-3:00Am. It really has bothered me that
we
missed that call even though she was already dead,she might have been
trying to
say good-bye to us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
have
many stories to share with you, But I'm going to start at the
beginning. I grew
up in Laurence Harbor, New Jersey. From the time I was a very young
child I
knew that something was not right in our house. Our House was the last
house on
a dead end street that faced the marsh. In the winter you could see Hwy
35. The
surrounding woods were as equally disturbing. I was the only girl in
our
neighborhood, all my friends were guys...they were like brothers to me.
I was a
tough kid, and I did not scare easy. However, Being alone in our house,
and
going to sleep at night frightened me to death. My father died when I
was a
baby, and it was just my mother, brother and myself. There was quite a
difference in age between my brother and I. For years I kept my
experiences to
myself because I thought it was my imagination, and I also thought that
if I
told my mother and brother, that they would think I was crazy too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It
took a
long tome for me to realize that I wasn't crazy, it was not my
imagination, and
the hard part was that, I was a "gifted" child, whose family could
not relate to me on that particular level. These are my experiences
while I
lived there. My mother and father bought the house in 1962, and I was
born in
1963. We owned the house until 2005. To this day the events are burned
in my
memory. From the time I was about five years old there hardly was a
time that
the house was at peace. I would lay awake in bed at night and watch
orbs dance
across the walls and ceiling...then I could feel someone sit on the
corner of
my bed. It was not a faint feeling either, in retrospect as an adult,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>you could actually see the corner of the bed
being pressed down. My heart would pound in my chest so loudly that I
couldn't
hear anything else, and I could feel every hair stand up on my entire
body. I
would pull the covers and pillows over me in such a way that only my
eyes and
nose would stick out...even in the summer with no air conditioning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Shadows
were common place every where in the house. You could smell flowers in
the
middle of the winter as well. Then just as I would start to fall
asleep, I
would be jolted awake because something pulled the covers off of me so
violently that they were on the floor at the foot of the bed. That
would send
me screaming out of my room to my mother. There wasn't a time that you
didn't
feel as though you were being watched, or that you didn't feel that
something
was following you from room to room. If you came home and put your car
keys
down, turned your back for two seconds they were gone...and then after
searching the entire house, they would suddenly reappear where you
originally
put them in the first place...and you were the only one home the entire
time.
When I was in high school I would come home and shower because I played
sports.
I would always locked the bathroom door. Every time I would pull the
curtain
back when I was finished, the door would be wide open, once again no
one was
home, and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">our
interior doors had no keys. Until now I've been very vague with you
about my
experiences, but now I will tell you in detail my most frightening
experience...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
was
engaged to Mitch. We were both just out of High school. My mom was out
and so
was my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">brother.
Mitch and I decided to go to my house and watch TV and eat some pizza.
From the
time we entered the house I could feel that something was really wrong,
really
out of sync. The air seemed electrically charged. It was as though us
being
there had interrupted some unseen gathering. I ignored it even though I
was
goose flesh from head to toe. Even with all the lights on my mothers
house
always seemed dark. Mitch was sitting in the living room watching
television,
and I went into the kitchen to heat some frozen pizza. We were having a
conversation as I did so. My back was to the living room as we were
talking and
I was placing the pizza on the baking sheet. I heard what I thought was
Mitch
leave the living room and walk into the kitchen. I became aware that he
was
standing directly behind me as I was still talking. I turned around to
ask him
something, but to my shock and horror it was not Mitch standing <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">there....
I felt all the blood drain from my face, my knees went to Jell-O, and I
gasped
and screamed at the same time. Standing face to face with me was a huge
black
solid apparition. I could make out a head and shoulders, but the rest
became
more see through as it went towards the knees and feet area. It felt
like slow
motion. I think that when I turned around and screamed I scared it as
much as
it scared me. As I stood there screaming, the black figure literally
whooshed
through the kitchen wall. Mitch ran in the kitchen. I was shaking and
white
"as a ghost". It took me a while to collect myself. I shut the oven
off and we left and went to the local pizza place, where I told him
what had
happened. We / I did not spend much time at my mothers house after
that. This
is just one story out of countless stories that I would be <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">glad
to
share with you. I am now 46 years old, my entire life has been one foot
in this
world and the other in the spirit world. Years ago I had contacted
"Sylvia
Brown" who told me that my mothers house had many spirits in it, but
two
stood out... there is the ghost of a baby and its mother. She also said
that I
was a medium and a physic, and she was right, that is what I now do.
I'm no
longer afraid. It gives me pleasure to be able to connect grieving
people with
their departed loved ones. I consider this a wonderful gift that I
would not
trade for anything. Thank you for listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">All
of my
life I have had reoccurring experiences of the paranormal .Starting at
age 7
(as far as I can remember) when my father died . I used to believe the
experiences where dreams , or imagination ...until recently .I was
telling my
fianc&eacute; of my experiences..I.e. ;Voices , mists , noises , makes
on my body ,
being touched (shirt tugged on , hair pulled etc) ...etc ..His
suggestion was
that maybe I am a sensitive . So I started thinking about this
possibility ,
and decided to explore it further...My fianc&eacute; and I had
previously tried going
to paranormal meetings , which would go on "ghost hunts" , there was
one in particular that appealed to me , and we signed up .The building
the
group was going to was in New Castle Pennsylvania , at an old building
the was
previously the Elks club , built in 1914. This information was given to
us by
the "leader " of the hunt. When we arrived we went into a room to get
the speech about which rooms to be careful of , they would be marked by
the
yellow tape .Nothing else was told to us about the history of this
building
.But as I stood there a name entered my mind , and it kept repeating
itself
"Sarah " "Sarah " Sarah " over and over again . Well
as the group entered the basement , we divided into small groups of 2
or three
, my fianc&eacute; and I were in a small room in the back and I felt
nothing so we
decided to head out into the main part of the basement <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">,
and just
as we stepped out of the room , a main that was on the tour with us (
who has
been there before) said " Sarah if you are here with us , give us a
sign." I was flabbergasted!! I looked at my fianc&eacute; and explained
the utter
shock on my face , and we continued in to other parts of the area ,I
had entered
a room just of the entrance of the basement and instantly was bombarded
with
intense sadness , so much so that I got tears in my eyes . I informed
the group
leader and they took pictures around me ...BUT by this time I already
knew that
what they were searching for in the building wasn't correct , I KNEW
that what
I was feeling was the past , and the Child Sarah intended on proving
just that
to me . She (in what I would call it) attached herself to me , she
started
flashing images in my mind about what the building was before the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Elks
had
built there . It was her home . It was a beautiful Victorian with a
large porch
, parlors , a library , you name it she showed me . She told me that
she was
sad because of the remodeling that was about to happen in the building
. She
got her point across by telling me certain rooms did NOT belong . I
also picked
up a persistent man in a room on the first floor , I was flashed a
image of a
podium and people sitting and listening intently to this man . In the
ballroom
I was given images of people dancing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(
only black shadows of such) And at last the third floor I approached
the end of
the main hall and was shoved by something not seen , I took a moment
and
continued on into a grand circular room with benches attached to the
circular
walls , and had the feeling of being watched , and I kept saying "this
feels like "judge and jury " . It was like you were being persecuted
, watched and they spirits were getting angry . So I wanted <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">to
step
out of the room for a moment and I took a step toward the door and
received a
sharp blow to my middle back on the left hand side , I went out of the
room and
was telling the group about the incident and decided to give it another
try ,
and as I entered I again got another blow to the right side of my back
...at
that point I wanted out of there FOR GOOD ...So the group agreed to
leave the
third floor and as I entered the hallway again I got pushed in the same
spot as
the first time , which happened to be in front of a very LARGE window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>The interesting part as I said before was I
knew nothing of the place ....BUT when we were leaving I told the owner
all the
stuff Sarah had told me , I told her of the man in the room that in my
mind I
seen the podium , I told of getting pushed and hit in the back.....Well
she
surprised me , not only me but many in the group as well .....come to
find out
that IS where Sarah's home was , the rooms I was seeing were the rooms
in her
home , the man at the podium would have been the black preacher that
occupied
that room after the elks club closed down...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">That
night
I came home exhausted , I fell asleep and dreamt of Sarah , in the
dream she
told me her last name , so I searched her on the internet , I then
found
something more shocking , not only did I find her , the year she was
born , BUT
I also found the names of her parents . Well I had spoken with someone
that has
been to the club and knows tings about it , but they new her parents
names ,
which happened to be the same names I came across . And a as far as the
room on
the third floor , the owner informed me that this room was the judging
room for
the Elks members and where they would hold their remembrances to the
dead
brothers , and Women WERE NOT allowed in this room , and also that a
EVP was
picked up stating " You are being judged "!! ....<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>So needless to say I am now no longer doubting
my ability , and am more open to my experiences ...which have been many
since
that night .....<o:p></o:p></span></p>
