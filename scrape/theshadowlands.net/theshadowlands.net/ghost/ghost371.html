School Student(in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Costa

looker room I had heard stories of hauntings but never took them seriously.
That day for some reason I walked around the whole looker room to check no one
was there. Then I went back to my looker. minutes later I felt like some one
was there. The room got a little cold but I didn't pay attention. After that I
could hear some one moaning like if they were in pain. I looked around and no
one was there. When all the girls started comming in from class the moaning
stoped, but when every one else left again the room got cold agin and the
moaning started again. this time I ran out of the looker room. I could feel
chills running in down my back. never again did I go back to the locker room
alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is a town called Bluff
Dale which is about 60 miles S.W. of Fort Worth on Highway 377 S. . I used to
live in this town and there are several ghost stories and sightings there.
Confederate Soldiers still roam on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Church St.</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;"> through the middle of town. The old </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Bluff</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dale</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">School</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> had the top story burned while students were in class, the spirits now
reside in the new </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Bluff</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dale</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">School</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> building. In downtown there is the remains of an old
bank vault, you can not go into the vault without feeing evil spirits. There is
a dry creek bed next to the school that you feel as though you are being
watched especially late at night. There are evil spirits that are around the
bridge that crosses the dry creek bed on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Church St.</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;"> next to the school (cold chills and goosebumps if
you are by it at night), on nights there is a full moon, you don't even want to
cross the bridge. You can see eyes and the figure of a demonic spirit standing
on the bridge in the winter time during the full moon. There is house on Church
St. next to the school in which resides a woman, dressed in white Victorian
clothes that roams the house (I know from personal experience, since I owned
and lived in the house), it's said that the woman was murdered in the house and
her spirit still watches over the residents of the house trying to protect them
(her name is Jenny - she is a good spirit). There is a house on Church St. at
the far end that you feel eyes looking at you while you walk by (keep in mind
this house if vacant and has been for some time, in fact no one will live in
it). The townspeople will not talk about the towns history and if you ask they
abruptly change the subject, but rumor has it the town was moved to it's
current location from the other side of the river, sometime in the early
1900's. There used to be a town council, mayor, etc... of the town, but it has
not had one since sometime in the 1920's. </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mountain</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lakes</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">

(there are no houses there). Right up County Rd. 172 at the end is a Church
with a cemetary (also known as </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rock</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Church</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">) that no one goes to at night due to the evil that
is there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

are fast asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You&#8217;ve been in bed for
more than a couple of hours now, half in and half out of sleep, vaguely aware
of the program you&#8217;ve been watching on Tube, when the <b style="">&#8220;Distraction&#8221;</b> begins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
first it tugs on the covers at the foot of the bed, pulling you back towards
full wakefulness, But when it perceives you maybe drifting back, it tugs again
to elicit a more direct response, but gets none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><b style="">U</b>ndaunted,
it eerily walks across the bed like a black cat set loose by a witching hour spell
and this time the response is right!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
crash land right out of the semi dream state you&#8217;ve been in and shoot straight
up in bed, fully aware that something in the room isn&#8217;t quite right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All hairs on the back of your neck are
standing straight up like steel spines, and you catch yourself breathing in
short, but very loud measured gasps --<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Struggling to keep your sounds to a minimum, so you can better hear what
is going on around you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and then it happens!<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b style="">Y</b>ou
find yourself unable to breathe any air into your lungs momentarily, and then
the air returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As you sit on the edge
of your bed in the dark, you try to make sense of what has just taken place,
when once again you find yourself gasping for air and this is when the reality
of it all hits you that the reason you were unable to breathe, was because
something had been placed over your mouth preventing air to enter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although no actual hand is felt covering your
mouth, you know without a doubt that something unseen has done just that!! <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b style="">T</b>ime

frozen in place, unable to move a muscle as your eyes strain to penetrate the
darkness that is all around you, waiting for <b style="">&#8220;It&#8221;</b> to strike again and not wanting to disappoint you it does just
that, only by now you have somehow managed to free your legs and mind
momentarily from the frozen state you have been in, and have dove for the
covers on the bed, and the body of your sleeping husband not more than a foot
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

your heart and the rapid breathing escaping your lips, your entire body
attached to the back of your sleeping spouse, it strikes a third time! As if to
let you know, that although you think you are protected by the bedding covering
you, and your husband beside you, your not!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b style="">I</b> moved from
this home a couple of years ago and still find myself driving by the house from
time to time, Why? I&#8217;m not really sure, perhaps because I might see someone
looking back from a vacant window, or maybe because as I drive by I often
wonder if any other occupants have had similar experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never stop to inquire just drive slowly
by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><b style="">I</b>
have noticed that it seems to be up for rent rather frequently interestingly
enough, but my husband is quick to tell me not to read too much into it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were many events that took place while
living there other than the one mentioned but none as scary, Your name being
called out but no one in the home claiming to have been the one to call it!
Electric Garage doors going up and down by themselves and shadows lots of
shadows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t even begin to describe
the fear that crept over me the following day as I watched the sun begin to set
in the west, and to realize that dark once again would soon be upon me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><b style="">T</b>he brain races, will it happen again
tonight you wonder and every night there after?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><b style=""><u>O</u></b><u>r</u> will it wait
in the shadows for that perfect time to show itself once more when you least
expect it?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you start to relax
again, &amp; the memory of the events that took place start to fade, then it
will once again do something to remind you to never let your guard down, never
think all is well and never but never think it can&#8217;t reach you at any time it
chooses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s there in the shadows
waiting for that perfect element of surprise, that unsuspecting person, and
then &#8230;..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b style="">I</b> have
pictures that were taken while living there that have strange Anomalies on
them, someone else may look at them and think the film was bad, something got
in the way of the lens, or light got into the film itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew better, I waited until I no longer
lived there then I sent them to the Utah Paranormal Research Society to get
their input on what I was seeing in the photographs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn&#8217;t take long to receive a response
back and the response was as I knew it would be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, the pictures were authentic, Where was
the house located? And definitely an investigation should be done there and
please tell them more!<span style="">&nbsp; </span><b style="">T</b>hey also enlightened me about one of
the photographs I had submitted that was taken outside in the middle of the
day, It showed our driveway and the house next door to it with a row of hedges
and trees separating our driveways.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There above the hedges at one spot was what looked like a small cloud,
they informed me that they didn&#8217;t know what I saw when I looked at that picture
but what they were seeing was a man, a woman, and a small child.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span><b style="">S</b>ure enough when you increased the size
of the picture upon closer inspection there they were, the man with the small
child in front of him and the woman standing next to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also in this picture were several red &#8220;Orbs&#8221;
floating around, these are said to be spirits themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other twp photographs contain what appears to be a funnel cloud over
the main part of the picture with a ribbing on the outside of it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b style="">I</b>
am told these are referred to as &#8220;Vortex&#8217;s&#8221; which is a portal or doorway for
spirits to move in and out of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
pictures also contain the Red Orbs I spoke of. I have attached the pictures for
anyone interested in viewing them.<span style=""> </span><b style="">A</b>nd So, the next time you awaken for no
reason in the middle of the night, not sure what exactly it was that woke
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you find yourself standing in
the dark &#8221;listening&#8221; for who knows what?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the hair on the back of your neck stands up for no apparent reason at
all, If for some unknown reason you feel as if your not alone,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>bear in mind, it is more than likely not
that piece of cake you ate before going to bed or that last glass milk --<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite possibly you are --<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I live off a street where
fivepoint is. The main road, king graves, is where a guy took a girl tami
elmstron to his "cabin" (it was just a concrete shack) was, and
murdered her there, mutilated the body, drove the parts to butler and dumped
them all around...its just a burned down house and its not really safe to go in
anymore, but if you drive past it and then turn around, you are followed by a
car all the way to five point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had an
experience where the car rolled over the boys, it was pretty crazy...we were just
sitting under the bridge talking about it and we all heard snapping and
grunting sounds and then we heard a high shrill, so we took off, later on there
was a streak of finger prints across my driverside window, after i just washed
my car...it was nuts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">also the at the courthouse,
there is a stairwell that leads to the upstairs floor. i was looking out a
window at the side, which faces the graveyard in the back, and i felt a chill
but thought nothing of it...as i was walking out the room i looked back and the
window was open, and the chandelier was swinging clockwise...ill never forget
how freaked out i was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi, this might not be a
ghost experience but it still have no reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">when i was like 9 or 10 i
had this woodin doll with string hair and it was the uglest thing every, it
would sit on the top of my curtains for the longest time. ok here is where the
story starts, at my old house, that doll would sit on my curtains and everytime
woke up that doll would not be on the curtains it would be sitting right next
to me in bed, this was happing for the longest time, i move upstairs to my new
bedroom, and i put that doll up on the curtains like always, but of corse it
still was always next to me. so one night i slept dowstairs and put the doll on
a table in the living room next to this clown doll that was wooden just like
her. when i awoke she was next to me, not on the table and when i went to the
table the poor clown doll was face down on the ground. Since my parents swore
they didnt touch the doll and my brothers did too, i tought the doll pushed the
clown down and went to me, my dad got sick of me complainin that he burned both
of the dolls in our fireplace. after that i was fine till i started going to my
sisters house to spend the night with my neice who is two years yonger than me.
My niece has two porclein dolls that used to be my moms mom when she was
little, they sit on my neices dresser, i was scared sick of those dolls because
they have those glass eyes that close when you hold them and stuff, they never
did nothing like move but i was scared sick of them, one night when i was in
haileys room trying to go to sleep i kept staring at those dolls i got so
frietnd that i through a blanket on their heads and begged my sister to go back
home. and it was like 3 in the morning, but I called my mom to go back home, of
corse she wassnt happy but I was. now i live in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">, a im 13. my sister now lives in my old house wear

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well id like to tell you of
the time that me and my family had went to Virginia one time to visit my family
and what not (they go at least once every year).We had always heard stories of
my great aunts house being haunted so one day we took upon ourselves to check
her old house out.Coming up to the old house will scare you just looking at
it.From the road where you turn onto to go to it,there are cornfields on each
side the road to the house and it is about 1/2 of a mile until you get to
it.This house is about 3 to 400 years old,so as you can use your imagination it
looks really freaky from the outside.There were about 8 of us in total that had
went that day.Two of my cousins who were little children at that time were very
scared and did not want to go in.Can you blame them!?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had stayed with one of my family members
outside (i cant remember exactly who it was).As you enter this creepy old
house,you come into a hallway the leads up some stairs to the second floor to
the left is the living room and down the hall on your right is the kitchen (the
kitchen freaked me out when i went in it).And at the very end of the hall is
the bathroom.We had all looked around and whatnot and then we went upstairs and
looked around at the old creepy looking rooms.Well something had scared the
life out of my aunt (i didnt actually know what it was so we had all rushed out
and left).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Okay heres what had happened
to me.The next day we had all wanted to go back so we did.On the road to the
house the car in front of us which consisted of my two aunts and two cousins
come to a complete stop in front of us and they are screaming at us to back up!
They get out of their car saying that they had watched the door of the house
slamming shut by itself (im getting chills as i tell you this) so they had
turned around and they were not going back. Well me and my mom and my cousin
hadnt seen a thing so we decided to go on down to the house to see if we can
see anything for ourselves.The others thought we were crazy but we didnt care
so we ventured on down to the house to try to see anything.We drove all the way
down and back to the others without seeing a thing.Well being the "brave
young man" i thought i was i wanted to really see something so i start
walking back down the road towards the house and my mom and cousin followed.A
little later when the house came into view we stood there and watched the house.This
is the good part...and this did happen because my mom and cousin seen the exact
same thing.As if telling us to get away what appeared to be a woman in a black
dress walks out if the house and and stands next to the tree outside the
house...(im getting chills again) we are standing there in complete dismay
wondering if what we see is true,then suddenly she disappears and the door
slams shut again! So as you can imagine we run as fast as we can back to the
car and we hightailed it outta there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Loves Me<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I stumbled across your
website, as most people do, looking for those like myself, who have had
experiences somewhat similar to mine. This account is very vivid in memory as
it happened back in September/Oct. of 2004. I was amazed and impressed at the
amount of stories and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>feedback your
website has compared to all the others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although I have not so far,
ready many stories close to what I have experienced, I do coincidentally have a
friend who experienced something almost exactly the same as I. And it was
someone she was extremely close to also. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Okay here is my story it is
very long, and 100% true. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My Little Brother Still
Loves Me<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">First of all, I wanted to
give a short background on my little brother , Jacob, and I's relationship.
Jacob was born 2 days after my first birthday. We were inseperable and even
when I got old enough to have friends, he never had a lot, so he accompany me
to friends houses. Our mother left when we were young, I was 4, he was 3. The
year before she left, we had lived "kidnapped" with her and her
boyfriend who abused all of us. Then she just called my Grandma one day, told
her to meet us at our Aunt's and she left us there. The last thing I remember,
she put Jake in my arms and said "Take care of your brother, Sissy."
Then she got back in the cab, and that was that. And I always made a priority
in High School to defend him. Although I was a loud, in drama club, and
cheerleader, Jake was quiet, not on the honor roll often, and had glasses. I
can remember getting in many fights because I was protecting him. Often the
bullies would even go as far as hitting or pinching him, and he would just
ignore them. Of course, me being me, I would hit them or go for the low blow.
Most people who didn't know that we were a year apart, even thought we were
twins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Jake was also "accident prone."
Before our mother left, when he was still in diapers, I watched him fall into a
swimming pool and was rescued only after he brushed against someones foot. He
also had a mirror fall and slit both of his wrists, not to even bleed, because
he knew to apply pressure. And directly before he left for the military, he was
beaten by a gang, and almost died. In fact his military induction was delayed
because of this but low and behold a month later than expected, it was December
16, the day he left of that year, off he went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My Dad was in jail when
Jacob died, I can remember, Jake called me the night before died. Actually to
Jacob it was like </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="18"><span style="font-family: Arial;">6:30</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">
at night (</span><st1:time minute="30" hour="11"><span style="font-family: Arial;">11:30</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> for me, and one day behind him,as he was in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">) Jacob was upset about this, he and my Dad were very
close. My step-mom and step-sister had Dad put away after a scuffle involving
him and my step-sister's boyfriend. We talked for hours. I missed him so much,
he and Granny were the only ones that came to visit me and Sami. And I remember
after I had Sami, Jake would stay the night every now and then so that I could
sleep, and he would stay up with Sami. He also helped me paint her first
nursery. Anyways, The next day, after work, I had an argument with one of my
step-siblings over the phone and was feeling a bit glum after a collect call
from Dad in jail about 2 hours away. My fiance decided to take me out to Red
Lobster, on passing my Dad's favorite bar where he pretty much always
was(except this time), I noticed two marines standing outside talking to one of
Dad's friends. I begged Tom to stop, but he assured me it had nothing to do
with Jake and we went on to the restaurant. Well, after we had gotten our
appetizer we got a call from Debbie (my step-mom) saying that two marines had
been at the bar asking for Dad and they had told his friend, that it was
regarding Jacob. We left the restaurant immediately and met her at the bar, I
used her cell to call Granny. A I could understand through the sobs, was that
one of the marines was a Chaplain. We quickly rushed to Granny's house, but
they were gone to the jail. The marines told them they could only talk to Dad.
Push come to shove , I was finally able to get my uncle (who was staying<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with my grandparents) on the phone at the
jail and he told me that "there's been an accident Sissy, your little-
brother has been killed."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jacob had been killed no
more than 6 hours from the time I had spoke to him. He was hit by a truck while
crossing an expressway. And strangely enough, he had called everyone he knew
that day, except Dad. The first thought that went through my mind was that I
had heard once , that when one of a set of twins dies, the other will
eventually become drug addicted, or crazy. We were that close.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I remember being very upset
because when the funeral finally came, Dad promised me I could see Jake and
hold his hand.As I walked into the room, Jacob's Sargeant slammed the coffin
shut, and Dad said "Sissy , no!" when I begged him to open it, to
give me some closure. But it didn't happen. Regardless of me and my
grandparents begging, the coffin remained closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I hadn't slept since the day
we found out. I would just stay awake and ask God to explain to me why this had
happened, I begged him for a sign that he was really dead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That night I was rolled over
facing towards my fiance and staring at the window, when I got the feeling
someone was there, they were. It was Sami, and she wanted a juice box, so I
crawled out of bed and walked to the fridge with her holding my hand. I opened
the fridge and got out a juice box, and as I turned to hand it to Sami, there
was Jacob. He was sitting at my kitchen table surrounded by a blinding white
light. I dropped to my knees, and although I do not remember him telling me he
was in a hurry, It was somehow communicated, perhaps telepathically. I asked
him 3 or 4 questions and although I remember the answers to a couple I don't
remember the "really important" ones. But I remember he didn't answer
the way I had hoped, in fact he didn't seem happy, but sad. After the answers
to some of the questions he had given me were wiped from my memory, he hugged
me, and he was gone. He said "I love you Sissy, take care of Dad for
me."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>reached to my right, still kneeling and
touched Sami's face and she said "you're pokin' me in the eyes,
mommy." I gave her the juice box grabbed her hand, and walked back to bed.
Needless to say, she slept with me that night. I do not know what she did or
did not see.Although there is more to this story, I will end it here, because
it is so long. If you would like to know more about experiences I have had
connected with this story or the ones I have had that aren't, please email me

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've been employed with my
local Office Max store for 5 years now and have had a couple experiences
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most prominent one that
stands out to me is when I was working overnight stocking the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was at the rear of the store as the two
other people there with me were when I saw a shadow walk across the front of
the store heading towards the managers office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also within the last year I have been heading towards the rear of the
store and seen a day planner fly off the shelf and land about three feet away
from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've talked to other people I
work with and everyone gets the feeling when they're in the back area that they
aren't alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There's always the sense
of being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The strongest presence
I feel is in the mens restroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hear
things and always feel like there's someone in there even when I'm there by
myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've gotten the impression,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know where it comes from, that the
ghost is that of a Native American who happened to be killed in a battle there
a couple hundred years ago and when the store was built 10 years ago, started
wandering around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He does not harm
anyone, he's just there<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I remember a while back my
mom telling me that we had a ghost living in our second house when my brother
and I were younger. I was six and my brother was probably around 5 months old.
Of course, I never felt the presence of this ghost. This house is in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Duluth</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Minnesota</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyways this happened when
we moved into this house. When we moved in I was probably around six months
old. We lived in this house up until 1987 then moved to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">St. Paul</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Minnesota</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. My mom would smell perfume in the masterbedroom
where she slept. My mom new that the previous owner died of some kind of cancer
and she died in that room. They were an older couple that lived there. She
loved children very much. When my brother was born and as he got older my mom
would hear him giggle in his crib late at night to early morning. My brother
was probably around five or six months at the time. He would also talk in baby
gibberish real loud and giggle. My mom figured she was my brother's guaridan
angel. But I would remember him giggling real loud in the mornings when I would
try to sleep then I would start laughing because he was giggling real cute. I
have no idea if this woman<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ghost is
still there. At times we drive by it but I don't feel anything. I told a story
about my grandparents about five months ago on this website. Just recently I
moved from </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">St. Paul</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lino</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lakes</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. I invited them to come with me and I don't feel
their presences at all. But I have been hearing voices and seeing things from
the corner of my eyes. And again, I don't feel threatened at all. I know you
are not suppose to invite ghosts with you but I knew they were my grandparents.
Then again, it could be my imagination as well. Please e-mail, I love to talk
to people regarding ghosts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mother has a friend that
decided to sell silver rings. My mother bought one for me that i really liked.
I went to bed that same night and woke up with the ring tangled in the
blankets. I thought how funny it was since i have heart problems and i tend to
swell up when im sleeping but i brusehd it off by thinking maybe i took it off
right before i fell asleep heavily without noticing. the very next day I don't
recall why but i decided to sleep in the same bed with my mom. When we woke up
in the morning the ring was off my finger and in my mothers wedding ring
finger. We both freaked out and i asked her if she remember putting that ring
on because i did not remember taking it off and giving it to her she said no. I
called that same day the friend that sold the ring and gave her back to her
without asking for a refund.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This just happened tonight (</span><st1:date year="2005" day="25" month="8"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Aug 25 2005</span></st1:date><span style="font-family: Arial;">). As part of my nightly routine at my job, I go to
our accountant&#8217;s office and pick up the used backup tapes. I do this every
night and never have had any odd occurrences until tonight. I unlocked the door
and was about to go in. For some reason I stopped and fumbled for the light
switch. I saw a faint greenish glow by her desk but I figured she must have
left her computer on. I turned on the light and went toward the filing cabinet
to get the tapes. A cold breeze rushed past me and all the hair stood up on my
arms and back. I noticed the computer and monitor was not on. I looked all over
the office to find the source of the light-no digital clock, no adding machine
on, no power bar, and the office is an interior windowless one. I had no
thoughts of the paranormal tonight before I went to the office, as I said it
was a regular nightly task for me that had never had any spooky overtones
before. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was a little girl I
was told the story of a woman, a woman dressed in all black with long brown
curly hair, and a black vale over her face. When my aunt was 17 years old she
seen her and my mother, an uncle and my sister. So I guess when I seen her it
was my turn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was 14 years old and we
lived in a 3 bedroom house with 2 bathrooms. Well, one of these bathrooms was
in my room, every night I kept the light on in there to see if I had to use the
restroom in the middle of the night and I knew whenever it was off. Well one
night there was a pretty bad storm and the power went out I had forgotten to
close the window in my bathroom and I didn't want my floor soaked and have a
bad mess to clean up in the mourning, Well I walked into my restroom feeling
uneasy as it was I hate to be in total darkness, Well I felt around and was
trying to find my aroma candles to shine some light till the power came back
on. I found one and was looking for the lighter I kept near them. That's when I
heard something say my name, I shut my eyes and tried telling myself I was
hearing things, then I felt something tap me I was standing in front of a
mirror so I didn't want to open my eyes the few moments of me standing there
seemed like forever finally i grew the courage to open my eyes and when I did
lightning struck and lit up my bathroom and I seen her standing behind me I
couldn't move I couldn't even breath I didn't know what to do the door was past
her and I kept thinking if I run something is going to happen. So I turned
around and faced her whatever she was she didn't to wanna go anywhere, so we
stood there staring at each other then it seemed to me like she was trying to
talk, and I asked her if she knew me. She kept moveing her lips but nothing was
comeing out it was like watching a movie in slow motion with the mute on.
Finally she whispered something " You know who I am" and Vanished.
The lights came back on and she was gone but I still couldn't move I heard a
laugh that seemed out of this world. I have yet to see her again im waiting
though cause I have this feeling I will again someday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">hi, i am a 33 year old
mother of three young children, one boy 61/2, one 41/2, and a daughter 20
months . i have three step children as well, one girl 17, two boys, 12 &amp;
10. i have had many strange experiences throughout my life, beginning when i
was 7. i have always known when family members or extended family members would
pass away. the first time was when i lost my grandmother, i was 7 at the time.
she came to me at my home, 30 minutes from hers, to tell me she was leaving, it
was about 3 am, when i woke that morning and told my father she was gone, he
told me it couldn't have happened since my mother hadn't called from the
hospital. a few minutes later the phone rang, it was my mother, telling us my
grandmother had passed that morning. a few years later my grandfather would sit
and talk to my grandmother, telling her he would see her soon, sure enough, at
about 1:30 in the morning, he came to me and said he was leaving, my
grandmother stood next to him and they both smiled and left. that morning i
told my father my grandfather was gone, again he did not believe me, until the
phone rang, he didn't need to answer to know it was my mother telling us he was
gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">since then, i have been able
to speak with my grandmother, she in fact told me of my father's death, over a
year before he passed! i was two months pregnant with my daughter, when my
grandmother told me i was having a girl on jan. 7, and her grandfather wouldn't
live to see her first birthday. well, he was fine at the time but then, a year
later, in june, we were told his cancer had returned and sure enough he was
gone in october. oh by the way my daughter was born on jan 7. i've also
predicted the death of my husband's family. he was visiting his mother in
Florida, we were warned she wasn't going to make it long, when i got the
distinct feeling she was gone, it was 3:33 dec.7, 1999, i told my friend who
was sitting with me about the feeling, when the phone rang, it was my husband
telling me his mother just passed. i also knew of his grandfather's passing, i
woke at </span><st1:time minute="33" hour="3"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3:33
 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> on </span><st1:date year="2000" day="7" month="4"><span style="font-family: Arial;">April 7,2000</span></st1:date><span style="font-family: Arial;">, to his grandfather telling me goodbye, as i told my
husband the phone rang, it was his uncle, telling us his grandfather was gone.
i have more weird things, many attached to this home, and some more about
knowing about a death, but one more eerie thing, take it for what you will, my
daughter is exactly 3years and 33 days younger than my son. note the times of
death and you will see why this is eerie, at least to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">finally, i would like to say
i love this site. its nice to know that there are others who have strange
things they can't explain happen to them. i know i can interact with the dead
but few have ever believed me, thank God my husband can interact with them as
well. also my daughter, i was told this by my grandmother, will have many more
abilities to talk and interact with the dead than i, and she will have a great
teacher as to how to handle her 'gifts'. i could tell you a great deal more, if
you'd like to hear, in fact i could fill a few pages, maybe i will write again
if you would like.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am formerly a student of
Lincoln High in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lincoln</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nebraska</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. This high school has had a very interesting
backround. It was established almost 140 years ago, but the original site was
torn down and now is the Pershing Autotorium. It now stands at 2229 J' street
in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lincoln</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">. I was privalleged enough to speak with some of the
staff about their ghostly experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I quickly learned that the
library, formally the pool, was haunted. In the early days of the school a boy
was drowned in the pool. Late on night, after musical rehursal, my friends and
myself where walking past the library on our way to the parking lot. We where
laughing and joking with one another until one of us stopped and focused on the
glass windows of the library. I stopped and turned and noticed a young man
standing in the corner across the room. I asked my friends, who where now all
focused on the windows to tell me what they saw. They all told me that they saw
a young man in the library. I chuckled and our group continued it's way towards
the doors. Then we heard a loud *Bang* against the glass. The boy was there,
pressing his hand on the window. My friends and I bolted for the door. That is
not the only haunting in this ordinary looking high school. The auditorium is
haunted too, by the ghost of a girl that met her tragic end by falling off the
balcony in 1919. Again another day of rehursal, not much to do when you are
sitting back stage waiting to join the rest of the cast. My friend tapped my
shoulder and told me to look up into the balcony and tell her what I saw. Their
in the front was a misty<span style="">&nbsp; </span>figure, not as
clear as the boy in the library, but she was there. Sitting in one the seats
watching the rehursal. I spoke with the director after rehursal about the
strange figure in the balcony. He smiled and told me that, that was Ruth. I was
a bit shaken by this. I never thought that he would be so calm about that. But,
never the less I continued my quest for ghosts at this school. Another teacher,
later in my senior year pulled me aside and told me the story of a ghost on the
fourth floor. He was a teacher in the early days of the new building. A sturn
but good hearted man who hated one thing above the rest, cheating. The teacher
then told me about one of her students. She was known for failing and cheating
her way through tests. Nothing stopped her until she had a fourth floor class.
One day in class the students where taking a test and the girl had some of the
answers written on her arm. All of a sudden a book fell out of the shelf by her
desk and papers on the podium across the room slid off and onto the floor. The
teacher checked her student and sure enough she was caught. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My fiancee and I were
spending our first night at our new apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He went to our old place to pick up a few last things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was probably about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="1"><span style="font-family: Arial;">1:00 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I laid down
on the floor in our bedroom, and drifted off to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suddenly woke up and for some reason had to
fight for the strength to lift my head and look toward the doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I did about four feet from me, and about
eye level with me, was a almost transparent wolf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had a snarl on its face, with its teeth
all showing and almost a lions mane of fur up around its face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden I just growled and lunged at
it and it was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With no fear I
rolled over and went back to sleep, all alone in the apartment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next morning I told a
few friends about the crazy dream I had.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later I was really glad that I had mentioned it to someone else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About two days later my
fiancee asked me what was inside a box that was still sitting unpacked on my
wardrobe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pulled it down and opened
it, and was surprised by what I found.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The things in there were not ours they were genuine indian
artifacts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moccassins, jewelry, a clay
pot, and a little tiny feather made out of wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also was a letter saying if you are reading
this I am already dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was written
by a man who felt he had lost his family and had nothing to live for, and was
going to kill himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got goosebumps
reading this because the night I was sleeping on the floor and had the
"wolf dream" the box was about 2 feet behind me, like I was in the
wolfs way of getting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Even my fiancee was kind of
spooked by this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither of us had ever
seen these things in the box and have no idea how they got in our house, other
than the movers accidentally put it there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He insisted that I go toss it in the dumpster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This just seemed way wrong to me so at </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="5"><span style="font-family: Arial;">5:30 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> I was on my way back to our old place where I placed
the box on the porch where I believe it must have come from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We haven't had any other incidents since then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was reading through the
hauntings in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Louisville</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Kentucky</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and noticed that you had Hot Rod Haven as </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mitchell Hill Rd</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;"> off of Mt.Holly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know about a Hot Rod Haven on that street because I grew up on </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mt.</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Holly</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and had never heard any one call Mitchell Hill - Hot
Rod Haven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However growing up we would
always get a bunch of us in a car and ride to St. Anthony Church rd which was
called Hot Rod Haven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the end (coming
from our direction) before going down the hill there is a cemetery on the left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole road was supposed to be
haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was "blood" on
some of trees and bridges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Going through there now it
looks like paint but when your 16 driving at night it sure sounded
haunting!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night we were having a
scavenger hunt for about 6 car loads of people and the finish was at the cemetery
at Hot Rod Haven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were about 8 of
us there first waiting for the others when a man came up from a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hill in the back of the cemetery and just
starred at us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His face was very
pale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he finally turned to leave
and go back the way he came his head seemed to almost be turned completely
backwards so he was still watching us all the way back down the hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was pretty freaky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't remember any of the stories as to why
it was supposed to be haunted or anything about the old man in the cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just thought I would share.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I live in Wv. and one night
I was with my girlfriend while she was visiting her grandfather. He was telling
experiences that he has had in his life. But the one that caught my attention
and still gives me chillbumps as I am writting this is the one of his brother
who was about 11 years older than him, and his brother made moonshine up in the
mountains. He said one night while he was home waiting for his brother to get
back with the moonshine that he had made, he waited about an hour then finally
he got home. He got up to help him with the jugs and his brother said I just
met Satan. He said that he was very pale in the face. He said the way it happened
was he was coming back with his moonshine and he was almost home but there was
a man walking beside the road with what looked like a top hat and he couldn't
see behind him because he was walking in the oppisite direction that he was
driving. He stopped and asked if he wanted a ride and the man just looked at
him and just said "no I'm just going up here." he then said "I
know you, but you don't know me, but keep up the good work for me". I
presume that he was talking about oonshining, but he said he just stood there
confused and waited for him to start walking again, and when he did he could
see behind the man and there were these massive logging chains attatched to his
back that he was dragging up the hill, sort of like a slave. And he said that
when he finally couldn't see the man anymore like something lifted off of his
chest, like a burdon, but he just felt really nervous about being around the
man and had a bad feeling. But thats his story, not mine, but I'm almost 100%
sure its true. That old man is dead now, but I'm pretty sure I know where he is
now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I had visited </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Las Vegas</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> about 3 years ago with my mother,father, and
friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed at the Flamingo Hotel
on the Vegas Strip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend Dave and I
stayed in one room and my parents in another.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dave and I were the only ones with keys for this room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, we stayed for 5 days and for the first
few days , I kept hearing the faucet in the bathroom go on and off with no one
in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the last night , I had a
horrible dream of me dying and I woke up. When I awoke I saw two figures in my
room. One of the figures was a chubby man and he was standing in front of my
friends bed sipping what looked like a martini or at least in a martini glass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other resembled a woman and she was near
our luggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is def not the first
experience I have had with ghosts and I make sure I know what I am looking at
before I make a judgement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, after
looking at them a minute or so, I turned away and they were still there when I
turned back. After rolling around a few times in my bed, I turned to see them
again and they were no longer there. Many people always say that I could have
been getting burglarized, but that was certainly not the case because these
people were transparent. After that had happened, I went downstairs to get my
mind off of the experience. The very next day, after I had returned home, I
searched this very web site to see if the Flamingo was listed and it was!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

intrigued by ghosts and other outer worldly beings even sense I was really
young. Mostly as a child I was just frightened by it all but still yet I was
always curious. However it wasn't until I was about 13 or 14 when my mother,
brother, and I all had to move into a new home that I was introduced to it all
in a hurry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the day we came to look
at the house before moving I remember feeling like we wouldn't be alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after moving in both my brother and I
started seeing and feeling strange things. My mother has never had an
experience other than what we have told her. For example one night I was trying
to fall asleep and I saw what I made out to be a woman in a long dress
(although it was slightly blurry) come into my room and stand at the bed just
watching me. She stood at the end of the bed for a little while watching me
watching her and then just turned and walked out the door. I wasn't really
scared but I was unnerved by the situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another night my brother
awoke in his room to a young girl at the end of his bed trying to talk to him.
He was very scared by this for obvious reasons, and he immediately called for
my mother and I remember hearing him from my bedroom telling her that we had to
move the very next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then we
have grown to recognize the young girl and the woman as parts of the household.
We see them at all hours of he day and just simply let them go on about there
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hear them come up and down
the hallway and we even occasionally get followed by the little girl trying to
play. Another occurrence I remember one night waking up at around 5am and
hearing who I thought was my mother coming to my room I thought she was coming
to wake me up for school or something I was slightly still sleep logged, I lay
still and pretended to be sleeping while she came in and kissed me on the cheek
I remember her wearing a very long night gown and wondering why she was wearing
it but thought nothing of it and went back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning I asked her why she had done
that and she said that it wasn't her. After thinking about it I realized that
it had been the woman I had seen so many times. This was the only time that I
had seen her and she seemed so REAL. It was also the only time that I was
physically touched by either of the ghosts. I truly had thought that it was my
mom coming in to see me. We have never felt threatened by either of these
apparitions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However there is one other
that isn&#8217;t quite as friendly. My brother and I both have discussed seeing a man
lurking in the corners of our basement. He is always chasing us up the basement
stairs and appears on the other side of doors trying to scare us. Just the
other day as I was running up the steps from him when he grabbed my ankle right
when I got to the top step; I had to pull my foot as hard as possible to get
out of his grip. He always chases us up the steps however; he never ever goes
past the basement door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Can anyone explain
this?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember one other scary incident
with him in which I was upstairs on the computer talking to my friends it was
late at night around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="2"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">
and I heard a girl screaming from the basement. I remember being very scared
and worried that it was the ghost of the young girl being harmed by the man in
the basement. That very same night there was a heavy black cloud floating in my
bedroom as I tried going to sleep. These are only a few of the things that have
happened over the past 8 years of us living here. We have discussed many of the
happenings and even though my brother and I have never seen these ghosts at the
same time we are both able to describe the same exact beings. I am unsure of
what any of these occurrences actually mean and if I am even truly scared by
them but, I thought that they would at least be interesting for everyone to
read and compare to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i just wrote to you about my
ability to foretell of death. what i did not tell you was that, not only was i
told<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my father would be gone before my
daughter's first birthday, but i was told how it would happen. my grandmother
laid out the time, day, and events to a tee. i was told it would be on a
friday, after nine, i would find him, i would have to tell my mother and two
brothers, and we would be late getting there b/c the car keys would be missing.
i had figured it was after nine in the morning since my mother would go to work
by </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="8"><span style="font-family: Arial;">8:30</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and i usually went by around nine. well, i was
wrong. the day he passed was friday oct.8, that morning went by with only the
smell of peppermint (my dad's mother) surrounding me. that night we were all at
an event held by the fire company my husband, brother, father, and daughter
belong to when my brother received a call that my father was being taken to the
hospital. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">making a long story short,
my brother and i left to go to my mother's, leaving our spouses and children
behind. my mother and i then followed the ambulance to the hospital, my
brothers stayed behind to make phone calls. at the hospital we, (my mother and
i) were told my father would not make it, i made her leave the room and go
outside. when i then returned to the room, leaving my mother waiting for my
family to show, i was told my father was gone. i called my husband to find out
where he and my brothers were, only to be told THE CAR KEYS HAD DISAPPEARED
making them late. when they arrived i had to break the news to them that my
father had indeed passed before they could make it to the hospital. it was only
later, after talking with my sister-in-law with whom i had shared my
grandmothers prediction months before that we had discovered everything she had
said had come true. the time of my fathers passing was </span><st1:time minute="16" hour="21"><span style="font-family: Arial;">9:16pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> on friday, my car keys had disappeared, making my
family too late to see my dad, i was the first to be told he was gone and i was
left to tell them. two more wierd notes, my nephew saw my fathers mother in his
driveway at the exact time my father passed, he told his mother not to hit the
little old lady standing there, but she could see no one. the time, </span><st1:time minute="16" hour="21"><span style="font-family: Arial;">9:16pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">. second the doors to the hospital that led to the
outside tarmac for the helicopter blew off their hinges when the helicopter,
carrying another patient to the trauma center, took off. this was something
that never happened before in the entire time they had landed the copter. the
time this happened, you guessed it, </span><st1:time minute="16" hour="21"><span style="font-family: Arial;">9:16 pm.</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> oh yeah, my daughter was only 8 months old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Im 16 and the story is a
short story, but i swear its true, me and my friends tested the probability of
being a real person and its impossible for what happened to be a real person,
heres what i saw:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was at </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fort</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">George</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">, i do 1812 living history so alot of people dress up
in the style of clothing, so when i first saw this ghost i thought it was an
actual person. i was walking to the bathrooms and you have to pass by a yellow
building once used by the officers of the time, theres a little block kitchen
out the back of this yellow house, i had to pass by it to get to the bathrooms.
i saw someone standing looking at me and it was a man wearing a outift like the
rest of the people camping there. i waved thinking i knew him and i was going
to go over ot say hello, thinking i knew him and as i got closer he disappeared
around the corner. i followed fairly quickly, wondering where he was going and
when i turned the corner he was gone. like i said my friends and i tested this
and it would be impossible for him to have gone around the next corner before i
gotten there, i must say this freaked me out a bit, my friends throughly
believe me and i know Fort George is haunted so im actually quite excited that
i witnessed this, im hoping you believe me to :)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Pork Pie Factory<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: bcorble@tiscali.co.uk<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the 1980s I worked at a
pork pie factory, on permanent nights. I was not keen on the job, but it
brought home the bacon, pardon the pun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The factory built in
Victorian times was used for many years as a slaughter house, was situated next
to a railway line, and if you arrived on foot, had to walk past a large fishing
pond. It was very isolated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I worked in the jelly room, next to the ovens.
In due course, a new jelly room was built on the site where the old railway
sidings used to be. We happened to be the first shift to use the new facility.
We worked in pairs, and on the first night I was working opposite a woman
called Rita. All of a sudden Rita screamed,and was incoherent. As it was near
break time we helped her to the canteen, and after plying her with hot sweet
tea, found out what had frightened her so much. At first all she could say was
"it was woolly" we asked what was woolly, and she told us that whilst
she was working she kept brushing up against something woolly, she looked up
and saw a very tall man wearing what she described as a "navy blue army
greatcoat" she also said he was so tall she could not see the top of his
head. He disappeared as she screamed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We resumed work
apprehensively, and nothing more occurred on that shift.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next night I was working
on a table opposite my work partner Joan. Now we had to wear<span style="">&nbsp; </span>disposable plastic pinafores on top of our
overalls, and Joan jumped back from the table uttering an oath. It was as if
someone was standing at the back of her, pulling the knot of her apron strings
backwards and forwards. We had to accept that something strange was going on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Word soon spread through the
factory, and soon the cleaning staff refused to go near the place, we found we
had to do the cleaning ourselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The girls on the other shift
to us had also some strange experiences, like their overall collars being
turned up, and a feeling that some one was behind them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Things came to a head when a
huge stack of trayed up pork pies came tumbling down, and narrowly missed one
of the girls. At this stage we asked one of the old guys who had worked there
from school, if he knew of anything<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>which could cause all the strange happenings. He told us of an accident
which had occured on the sidings just after the war. A young guy had taken a
job after being demobbed, and had only been there a week when he was crushed to
death by a railway wagon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The most significant thing
is that he had been de-mobbed from the navy, and the coat that Rita had seen
was a reefer jacket. The guy was also exceptionally tall. The place where Rita
had seen him was the place he was lain down and died before the ambulance
arrived. The guy also told us that his name was Stan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I don't think Stan had
parted from this life willingly, as he was quite nasty at times, and his pranks
not good humoured. He had a thing for tampering with the water supply, turning
the taps on and off. Also we had great cauldrons of Jelly which had to be kept
at a certain temperature. These often boiled over, spilling boiling jelly all
over the place, despite us keeping a log of their temperatures. He also kicked
Rita on the shins before our eyes, we saw the bruise form on her leg.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Eventually the place shut
down, and its workforce dispersed. I got a job in the nearest town. As I got
off the bus one night after work, an old colleague greeted me and told me the
news that the factory had burned down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Guess where the fire had
started? In the Jelly room of course, and when the workmen had tried to put it
out, the water supply had been turned off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I think Stan has had his
revenge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

lived in was Haunted<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi my name is Michelle but
everyone calls me Shelly. Well, where to start, I guess I'll start back in 1993.
My children and I and my best friend Brina and her boyfriend Benny and my
boyfriend Reggie moved into a house it was a row house. This house wasn't in
the best shape but it would make due, because I needed a place to live. My
oldest daughter Amanda at the time was yrs old, and my other daughter Kayla was
yrs old and my daughter Candace was only 1yr old. After living there for about
months things started happening. First they would only happen when I was home
alone. I would first feel something, I would feel as if someone was there
looking at me or following me down the hall upstairs, I would turn around and
no one was there. The floors in the front room would creek and no one was in
the room. My dog would bark at nothing a lot but sometimes she would bark but
wag her tail and other times she growled with all her might and wanted to
attack something. Later on things would happen when everyone else was home but
they would be asleep, I would be the only one up. When I would tell them about
what I heard they would laugh and think I was crazy. I remember one night, now
me and my boyfriend would lay blankets on the floor of the living room to sleep
at night. While Reggie was sleeping I had gotten up to get a drink, when I came
back to lay back down there were these wet spot on the blanket, but the wet
spots were only on the blanket I lay on, there no wet spots on the top blanket
or under the blanket, how did the wet spots get there, I couldn't figure it
out. Then another night I was cleaning and I wanted to get a movie ready to
watch for when I was done. So I put the movie in the VCR and pressed stop then
rewind, I did it that way because it rewinds faster. When I came back into the
room the movie was playing but it was rewinding, so thinking nothing of it I pressed
stop again and then rewind and went to finish my cleaning, but of course when I
came back into the room there was the movie playing but rewinding. I would hear
footsteps walking around upstairs, when I was taking a shower someone banged on
the bathroom door really hard it scared me so I got out to see who did it so I
could yell at them but no one out there. Little by little Brina started to hear
things also and she would tell me about them. Of course our boyfriends didn't
believe us. But at least she knew I wasn't crazy. The oneday my other friend
Gail came over to visit. We were sitting in the kitchen having coffee. I
washing dinner at the time. in my kitchen there is the basement door only one
way in and one way out through the kitchen. As I was stirring the pot on the
stove there came a real loud bang from the inside of the basement door, Gail
jumped and screamed and I just stood there stirring. She looked at me and was
like what was that Shelly? I said well I guess I should tell you I live with
ghosts. She called her boyfriend to come pick her up she was that scared. She
stayed away for a while until she finally decided to come back over to visit
with me. Well, that night it was Gail and myself and two other people there, we
were sitting in the living room no music on no TV on we were just sitting there
talking about what was going on in this house. Well, when her boyfriend came
over to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pick her up he came in and she
told him about the ghosts and he said out loud, "There is no such thing as
ghosts" as soon as he said that my bottle of secret flew straight up in
the air off of my entertainment center and fell right in the middle of the
living room floor. Everyone sat there quite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then oneday when I was home
alone I kept hearing the footsteps and it was starting to irritate me. I was
already frustrated because I had a lot of cleaning to do. I just stood up and
yelled out loud, "Listen I don't mind you being here, but you can at least
help clean up around here!" After I said that I walked into the front room
the dryer was in there, and the dryer door was open and the clothes were in the
clothes basket. I was amazed. Then I said laughing "You could have folded
them for me" But<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did appreciate
the little help they did. lol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I
feel there was more then one ghost in my house, and I feel there was an angry
one also. I say this because one evening my oldest daughter for was yrs old
came running down the stairs crying like crazy shaking, I've never seen her or
any child so scared. She kept saying something black come into her room and was
hitting her. I asked her what did it look like? Now she<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is only 5 but she said nothing, it looked
like nothing it was just black and it was hurting her. From that day on she
never slept by herself until she was like 14.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We finally found another
house that was in much better condition and decided to move out. When we were
getting ready to leave with the last uhaul load I looked up at the house, I
felt a feeling a sadness come over me I felt I didn't want to leave, as I
looked up the bedroom window upstairs I watched the window shut. I felt that
this wasn't the last time I was gonna be in this house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>We moved and things were alright for a while,
but after about 1yr things started going bad for me. To make a longstory short
I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>got evicted. You can never guess what
house was open and ready for me? Yes, the same house I moved from. It was then
1996 and I moved back into that house. My neighbor told me that ever since I
moved out only one family moved in and they moved right back out in 2 months.
It felt as if this house was calling me. I couldn't understand how this house
being so messed up holes in the floors and a lot of other things that were
wrong always felt comfortable to me. Well, while we were there the something's
were happening except for the black thing, that never showed it self or did
anything to anyone again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I stayed there until 1998
and I moved out again. I was gone until 2001 and ended up moving back in,
sounds crazy huh. That house just calls me back all the time. I moved back out
in 2002. I'd be out driving and for some reason I find myself driving past the
house and as far as I know there still isn't anyone living there. I don't know
if I'll be back again, I can't say that I won't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you for taking time out to read my
story and if anyone would like to comment or ask a question I would be happy to
know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did have a picture taken in that
house which has a ghost on it but I'm still looking for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This haunting may not be as
severe or exciting as some of the others on Shadowlands, but it definitely
freaked me out! Last night, two friends of mine and I went for a drive around.
One of my mates had just gotten his P plates, so we deciding to go celebrate.
Another mate of ours had told us about a tree his sister took him to see, that
apparently had the face of a female on it. With the 3 of us being very
interested in ghosts and the paranormal, we decided to go check out what all
the fuss was about. We really had no idea what it was that we were, in fact,
supposed to be looking out for. All we knew was that it was the "third
tree from the end on the left hand side". So were driving down the street
(</span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tressider
  Avenue</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;">,
Haberfield), looking for the "third tree from the end on the left hand
side". We were ALREADY freaked out at this point, not quite knowing what
to expect. And then we saw it. We didn't only make out a face, we were able to
make out the entire body! It was the freakiest thing we've ever seen! It looked
like a cloaked female, with her hands meeting in front of her body. We could
CLEARLY make out e facial details, even from about 20 meters away. And as we
drove past it, we could even make it out from the SIDE of the tree. We got out
of the car and took some photos, but they didn't turn out too well, as they
were taken from a mobile phone. We are going to back with a digital, and video
camera soon!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had a really wired

Its very old and is said to be haunted by the Von
Mindens. they lived on the third floor, they all lived to be very old and died
naturally, but one woman who was staying at the hotel (a long time ago) killed
herself after she found out her boyfriend (a soldier) had cheated on her. you
can see her in her polka dotted dress. the hotel has a very old theater built
on to the side of it, its been there just as long as the hotel, its very dark
and mysterious, you can feel the energy. We took lots of pictures and there
were different shaped orbs in each picture. the owners now are relatives of the
Von Mindens and they are happy to answer any questions and to take you through
all of the secret passageways!! Jamie form TX<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had grew up in of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">21 years was filled with all
kinds of strange paranormal activity. One event was a very muggy summer night
in July, I couldn't sleep my bedroom was so hot I had to turn the fan directly
on me, then I got really cold and I was shivering so I put my blankets over me
to keep me warm and I tired to close my eyes but I couldn't keep my eyes off my
bedroom door almost as if I was expecting someone to enter my room. Then it
happened, my grandfather had walked in who had been gone since I was 1 years
old, he came in and yelled at me for having the blankets on me in the summer
time the way I did. Then he threw the blankets on the floor and said I better
not do it again and good night. The funny part was I wasn't scared! But the
next night I slept in my parents room! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another event which occurred
in my old room was, one night I had been up late and I was watching tv I heard
little children outside my bedroom window laughing. I got up to see who was out
there and nobody was outside, this whole situation would have been fine if my
bedrrom window wasn't located on the second floor. One last event that had also
occured in the house was when my father had seen a woman dressed all in white
standing in the family room. Everyone in the house was out and he was the only
one home he was watching tv and gone upstairs to the kitchen to get a snack
when he went back downstairs to the family room he saw a woman standing in the
middle of the room and disappear. Thank you for listening to my story I could
go on and on! Thank you, Andrea<o:p></o:p></span></p>

witnesses to this. There is a little camp site just over the train tracks from
my house And there is a few swamps and all of that But the scariest thing is
that there is a little grave stone no bigger than 1ft by 1ft in the ground.Well
1 day me and a friend went down to dig this grave up note I was like 14 at the
time.Ne way we started to dig it up and not even one foot into the grave site
we had a weird feeling as if someone was watching us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">But we continued to dig and
we were like 3ft into this and we smelled something horrable like rotting
animal. I told my friend I was not going to dig ne more and just as I turned
and droped my shovel he struck it. He hit the casket.I ran for the hills.So the
next day we returned and low and behold all the dirt was back on the hole.We
could not belive our eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From that day forward There
is some thing in the woods that dosent want me or ne body around this
particular area. A few of my friends have experienced it the ground gets warm.
Some times the plants will die unecpectidly. In the middle of last winter there
was 2 flowers growing there. These were not a flower that should be around in
winter either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This story happened pretty
recently, about a week ago, and it is the strangest thing thats happened to me
in my entire life. And being only 14, thats saying alot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A few days ago, my boyfriend
and I were driving to Paul Dever, the old mental state before </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Taunton</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">State</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mental Hospital</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> was built. Now, even in the daytime, Paul dever is a
very creepy and foreboding place. It has about 6 ( maybe more but I can only
count 6 ) large buildings. Most of the windows are broken, its spray-painted,
and on some of the buildings, bars are on the windows. All in all, the place is
just down right scary. And being the idiot that I am, pursuaded my boyfriend to
drive me there one night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The back entrances to Paul
Dever are blocked by large rocks. If you enter through the front way, you have
to be checked by security, because some parts of the place are still in use.
So, we parked near my aunt's street, and I had ridden bicycles down Paul Dever
with my cousin a few summers ago, so I was familer with where the paved bike
path led. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We walked side by side along
the bike trail. It was breezy out, so I had on a leather jacket my brtoher made
for me before he passed away. It had silver studs, and an Anarchy sign on the
back. I always brought the jacket with me when I was going to do somthing like
this, because I noticed, that before somthing bad was going to happen, I always
felt a tug in a certain direction to run. Long story short, I felt safer
wearing the jacket than I did holding my boyfriend's hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We were coming up to a park.
It was where the sick children would play, and it was bordered by a large
building, which was probably where the children were kept. My boyfriend was
having a heart attack at the time, because I was right up next to a giant slide
I rememberd playing on when I was aobut 5 or 6 and my grandmother would take me
there to play during the day. I always had an intrest for old and abandoned
things, and not scaring easy, it was the perfect place for me to romp and have
fun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I held up my digital camera
as my boyfriend started to tell me to get back to him, because he not dare go
off the paved bike path, let along 20 feet from a building in that place. So I
took my picture, and got nothing. I deleted it and kept walking. We had a
police issued maginum flashlight on us, and it cast a pretty decent glow. I
wasen't scared, just jumpy, my boyfriend kept complaining that he had a bad
feeling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We walked a few quarter
miles, and found another building. The door was caved in, and you could see
where teenagers had spray-painted the inside. I stepped right up to the door,
and took a picture, ignoring the threats given by my boyfriend if I entered. I
reluctantly turned and kept walking with him, but I noticed I kept pulling my
jacket tighter around me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We walked around the place,
nothing happened. We thought we heard stuff, but it was hard to hear over the
crickets and peepers. We shrugged it off until we found an old game court,
located directly between 2 buildings. I went to the one on my left, and
immeaditly fell backwards. Somthing had, once again, pulled my jacket, so i
went ot the side on the right, again, I was pulled back. I stood in the middle,
and nothing happened. I flashed pictures, and noticed the building on the right
was a fallout shelter with a Biohazard sticker on it. I finished up, and we
decided to leave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of our reasons was, although
at the time I would not admit it, I got the sense that somthing very bad would
happen if we stuck around. We found out way to the bike path, and looked at one
of the buildings that sent shivers up our spines. We stood there for a few
seconds, just looking at our surroundings. Then we heard it. Coming from the
building directly in front of us, a very loud bang. It sounded like a flat
piece of wood you would put under your mattress, being thrown heavily, and
hard, onto another pile of woods. Then we heard the screaming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've never heard anything
like it, no animal or person could have made it. The first thing I thought of
was 'Banshee'. I knew a loved one was going to die if we stayed around. I
turned, my boyfriend just stared in horror, and I began to run.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">He was always a faster
runner than I was. But somehow, I past him, and he grabbed my jacket, looked me
in the eye, and said we should keep a steady pace. I then heard the voice of
someone I knew. My friend, Cory. I went to go back, to find him and see if he
was alright, but my boyfriend grabbed my arm and held me back, remindingme of
what I said to him before we entered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had told him I read aobut
the 'Lolita'. They are spirits of women who search for their child, and can
take the form of anyone. They are heard around the Maternity Ward, which was
where I heard the cries from. They hypnotize you, and make you believe a loved
on is in danger. I knew I had only come with my boyfriend, but still, if he
haden't reminded me, I probably would have gone looking for Cory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As we continued our walk, I
had the feeling to not look back. And what do I do, looked back, and snapped
pictures. I told my boyfriend of the feeling, and again we heard the cry of the
banshee. I felt a suprisingly hard tug on my jacket, and it kind of dragged me
foreward. My boyfriend and I ran. I've never ran so fast in my life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Back in the car, we drack
the coolatas we bought earlier, and he sped out of our parking spot. As we were
passing, we heard the cry again. He drove faster. I looked out the window and
saw somthing, running and moving bushes aside. I didn't look back, and I didn't
tell him to stop, I just wanted ot get out of there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Back at his place, I flipped
through the pictures I had snapped. Nothing interesting, the typical orbs,
white lights. Then I found the ones I snapped of the Fallout Building, and
while we were walking back. There was a woman, in the window of the buildings.
She reminded me of the woman from The Grudge, and I shuddered. I flipped past
and looked at the pictures I took while we were running/walking. I almost
dropped my camera. Around my left arm ( my dominant arm and where I held the
camera ) was another arm. I recognized the outline as Charlie, my brother who
had recently passed away. He was there with us, and if he haden't tugged my
jacket all those times, the woman in the window, just might have gotten me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My boyfriend was in the
shower at the time I was looking through pictures, and when he got out I showed
him. He shuddered and asked me to take my jacket off. I did, but was confused
as to why. He took it, and examined the arm. There where faint marks, that his
hand, and mine, were too small for. Then he examined my left arm, and noticed a
nasty bruise where my brother supposedly was holding my arm. I remember the
pull, and not having to really run because I was being dragged so hard. Then it
hit me. He was protecting me from the banshee. From the loltia. If he haden't
dragged me, I never would have gone anywhere. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sadly though, a few days
after that, I checked the bruises, and noticed they were gone. The phone rand,
and a voice said to call Chris, and hung up. Chris was my other broher, and he
was at his house with Jake, my third brother. I called Chris. He informed me
Jake had been in a car accident, and died on impact. The banshee cry echoed in
my head. I cried, and held the jacket close to me. Put it on even, and once I
did, I felt the familar feeling of Charlie when he hugged me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have not returned to Paul
Dever, and I don't plan to. However, my leather jacket stays on me all the time
now, and has saved me, and my boyfriend, more times than ever since Paul Dever.
I like to think of it as, Charlie and Jake are making sure, we are safe.
Although the feeling of comfort disappears when we drive by Paul Dever ( it's
on the way to my boyfriends house, no alternate routes ) and my boyfriend
speeds up the car. Once I looked, and saw a glimpse of the woman in the window,
looking at me through the fence. I'm never going back there again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
