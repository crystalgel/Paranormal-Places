friends and I have stayed in an old white house located in the Slate Creek area
of Grundy. The old house is only about a 3 min. walk for my mothers house where
I actully live I live in a place called &quot;Hurley Bottom&quot; there are
mostly trailers here but there are a couple of houses, the old white house is
one of the 2 oldest houses here built in the late 1920's. Everyone here knows
the stories about the old house there was a man stabbed to death in the kitchen
sometime in the 1950's and in the early 70's a young teenage girl hung herself
in the upstairs area of the house. On </span><st1:date Year="1992" Day="17"

color:white'> the day after I turned 9 years old (thats how I remember the
date) my grandpa found the old man that was living there at the time dead in
the living room. His body had been there for at least a week and rats had
already started eating him. The house went un-lived in for a little over a year
then a family moved in and their son an I became best of friends (still are to
this day) One day I was down there playing video games with him and the water
in the tchen came on by it's self and the door slammed seconds later (the back
door is in the kitchen). They has the upstairs area sealed off to keep the old
house warm in the winter so nobody could go up there (the stairs were torn
down) and my friend told me one night he was the only one awake and he was
watching TV and he said he heard what sounded like a girl crying upstairs and
he went and woke up him mom and when she got out of bed the crying stoped. Soon
after they moved out and into the house across the yard. The house once again
went un-lived in but for about 5 years this time untill a young couple rented
the house. They rebuilt the old stairs and reopened the upstairs area. Less in
8 months they moved out and once again went un-lived in untill the early spring
of 2003 when a friend and I moved in to have a place to hang out and party in
the summer. Everything was normal for about a month untill one night a friend
and I we're upstairs recording a song we had written (the upstairs has a creepy
echoing sound) and when I was finished singing as the melody of the acoustic
guitar rang out we truned down the recorder to give the song a fade out effect.
When we rewound the tape and played it back it sounded perfect it had just the
right sound we wanted and as the song faded out at the end we could clearly
hear a girl/woman crying on the tape (don't know where the tape is now)
needless to say we didn't go up there anymore. One morning just before dawn I
was stand out on the back protch smoking and I heard a camotion in the kitchen
it sounded like people fighting I got mad and when in the house quickly but
nobody was in there and everyone else was asleep besides my friend Jerry and he
said he thought it was me knocking stuff over trying to cook. These same events
continued all summer and into the next summer. We didn't stay in the house the
whole summer this year (2004) but I still went there to party or be alone. One
this past July 12th my girlfriend came in to visit me for est Virginia so her
and I stayed in the old house so we could have some time alone but we were far
from alone. Soon as darkness fell an uneasy feeling came over me. We were
snuggeled on the coutch watching a movie and she had to go to the bathroom, the
bathroom is built onto the from protch because the old house had an out house
and non of us was about to use it (nasty) so she had to go out the door that
left me sittin in the living room by myself I could hear something moving
around upstairs but I wasn't gonna let anything spoil our night so I didn't say
anything we were awake till about 4 in the morning before we fell asleep she
woke me up about 2 hours later saying she heard a loud thump unstairs and to
tell me that she thinks my grandpa was in there cause she saw a man walk out
the front door. I got out of bed and we came up to my moms house to take a
shower and eat later that morning I asked my grandpa was he down there and he
said no. My girlfriend new nothing of the houses history or the stories. I
haven't been in the house ever since and the girlfriend is now gone but forever
loved and missed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

here goes,when i was very young(around 4-5 yrs old)i remember hearing the
dishes rattle at night at our hose in Donelson,Tn and always had a feeling of
being watched while i listned to my records while my mom slept on weekend
mornings at that house.One night the girl across the street was babysitting me
and it was storming outside.Al of the sudden a bolt of lightning struck and
then LOUD thunder.Imediately after the thunder,something/someone knocked on the
wall hard about 4 or five hits and me and that girl jumped to high
heaven!Ok,then about 10 minutes later the phone rings,its the girls mother
telling her best friend had been struck by lightning and was killed!...So a
year later my mom was puuting gas in our riding mower and it exploded
&quot;somehow&quot; and i got burned badly(had to learn to walk again,my feet
were burned badly and alot of my body..so the after the house was rebuilt,i
STILL had this feeling of being watched there.....Ok,flash to about 20 yrs
later..I hear my mom overtelling a friend of her's that we used to live in a
hauted house,supposedly a woman shot herself after finding her husband was
gonna leave her..Mom said the womans spirit NEVER hurt her our anyone but she
did make a mess sometimes at night IN THE KITCHEN!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>So
i was Floored and told my mother that i KNEW that house was haunted and was
glad to know i wasnt crazy all those years ago.today i drive past that house
and wonder if anyone living there now has had any ghostly encounters,but i'm
afraid they'd think i was crazy and laugh at me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Back
in 1986, my son was a newborn and he slept in a bassinet in the living room,
(it was easier), and I slept on the couch next to him. One evening, I put him
to bed and laid down on the couch to go to sleep. As I was laying there, I felt
a hot, warm breath in my face. Thinking it was my dog, I opened my eyes
immediately to see that she was not in the room. I dismissed it and closed my
eyes again to go to sleep. I then felt a hand stroke my left cheek very gently
and lovingly. I opened my eyes again and no one was there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
wasn't afraid as it was a loving stroke on my face and very tender really. The
fact is, my friends brother, Richie, died about a week before and the last
place I saw him alive was in my living room. I believe it was Richie coming to
say &quot;Goodbye&quot; and I'm glad he did. It was a closure I needed as he
died very young at age 18.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>These
events happened in the year 1978, I am now 44. Please excuse the spelling I
have dyslexia and hate &quot;spellcheck&quot;. The location is an old antibellum
manson on an ex slave plantation. The grounds are still intact and
undeveloped.A group of high school friends had gone down to the house to do
some goose hunting it was early november. We arrived around 7 pm<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>had supper watched some tv then to bed as we
had to get up early. Saterday was a repeat of friday w/exception of the events
I will relate to you now.Around 3 am I was awoken by my friend phillip who was
franticly screeming at me to get out of bed and help him close the windows
because a major storm was comming in ( the windows were origanal for the house
8 feet by 14 feet and quite heavy), what they were doing open is just the
begining. I ran first down the hallway( the house has two hallways ,both 50
yards long running off the master staircase on each side) to cloce the end
window . As I ran I was aware of papers and things flying in the air near head
level ( I could not see very well because thier wasno overhead lighting, only
small lamps on tablesthat ran down the hallway) after that was done I ran
donwstairs to help Phillip w/ the big windows at midpiont down the staircasethe
two front doors blew open from a gust of wind which did not startle me as much
asthe sight of an old wing back chiar glide across theENTIRE lenth of the
livingroom.I was completely dumbfounded the only thing that broke my
concentation was Phillip screaming to ignore it and help him with the
windows.After we got the windows closed I examined the wingback chair it was
realy heavy about 130 Lbs I said it was amazing a gust of wind could make it
glide so evenly and completly across the lenth of the living room, just asI
said that the door of the bathroom ( it was the old main fireplace converted to
bathroom because of the chimney no longer wassafe )un latched itself right infront
of us and the door opened completly toward us.Well that would have shocked me
completly but at the same time from the kitchen came the sound of all the pots
and pans being pulled from the cubboards. when we entered the kitchen ALL the
potsand pans were actualy LEVITATING in mid air and going around in a circle.
this went on for about 20 seconds then a huge thunder clat sounded outside and
everything fell crashing to the floor.Phillip just looked at meif he were
embarrased and asked me not to speak of this when we got back home and school.
I of course complied ,who would believe me, as I read this 26 years later I
still dont understand what I wittnessed that night in the house near Pocomoke
City. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

for what I was seeing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I used to tell my
parents and my dad thought I was nuts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Sometimes when you would be in our living room you would get a real
uneasy feeling, like someone was watching you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I remember one year I was a freshman in high school and I had just had
my tonsils removed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I came home I
was so sick for about a week and I wound up sleeping all the time in the living
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every night I would wind up waking
up because I thought I felt someone touching me and I would get the feeling
that someone was standing behind the couch looking at me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I tried to tell myself that I was
hallucinating due to being sick but I still remember how real it felt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There
was one summer that all of a sudden I started hearing things in my room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I would be woken up in the middle of the
night to knocking on either my walls or the floor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would happen for a few minutes and then
just stop.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My closet doors would wind up
being open after I knew I had closed them because like so many people, I always
thought something would come out and get me if I didn’t.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was even one night that I could have
sworn I saw a man standing in my doorway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was all dark but was the perfect outline of a man.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I say a man because of its size.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was always telling my parents and my dad
would just laugh at me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is until he
finally saw the fog.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One weekend after I
had grown up and gotten married we had gone home for the weekend and we were
all sitting in the living room watching TV.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was around 9:00 at night and I got up to go to my old bedroom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could see my room down the hall from the
living room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I got back to the
living room my dad asked me if I saw my friend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“What”, I asked?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He repeated
himself and then said, the fog just followed you to your room.!.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked at my mom who would have been able
to see the incident too and she nodded her head yes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was the first time I knew my dad had
seen it too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now he sees it every once
in a while.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He even thinks he saw it one
night outside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said he was sitting in
the dining room, which has a sliding glass door going to our backyard, and
noticed something out of the corner of his eye.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He looked toward the door and saw something walk by outside.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also said there was one night that it was
dead still out but all of a sudden our big wooden swing started moving back and
forth as though someone had sit down and started to swing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Probably
the scariest thing I remember was once again when I was still in high school
and I was sitting up late at night watching TV.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I was sitting on the floor and all of a
sudden the dog we had at the time that was scared of everything came running
into the living room from the dining room and got behind me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was shaking like he was scared to
death.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked toward the dining room
and I could see a little black blob on the floor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was around 12” tall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even though there wasn’t a light on except
the TV I could still make it out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
just sat there for a few minutes and then was gone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As soon as it left the dog was fine too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Nothing
bad has ever happened to any of our family and the sightings seem to be very
speratic but we are all convinced that something is there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>As
far as other houses I’ve lived in, I sometimes think something has followed me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
main instance I will tell you about was in the first house my husband and I had
bought.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was an older house that a Dr.
had owned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was one day that I was
cleaning the bathroom and I heard car keys jingling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I called out for my husband because I figured
he had come home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No answer but I kept
hearing keys jingling and they kept getting louder like my husband was walking
to where I was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I called out again and
said, “honey, I’m in the bathroom.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
heard the keys again and this time it sounded like they were in the hall by the
bathroom door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked out to see why
he wouldn’t answer and there was no one there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I walked around to see if he was in another part of the house but he
wasn’t there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>At the time we lived in
that house we had one daughter that was 1-1/2 and another one on the way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In my daughter’s bedroom, I used to get a
real uneasy feeling especially when I would be putting things in her
closet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One day I had put her down for a
nap when I could hear her talking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
went to go check on her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her door was cracked
so I could see in just enough to see what she was doing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was sitting at the end of her bed looking
towards the closet acting like she was talking to someone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told her to lay down and went on with my
business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next day she did the same thing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I walked in and asked what she was
doing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said “ I talk to friend
mommy.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What friend I asked.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said one in closet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since I had always gotten a weird feeling
from the closet I shut the door and told her to lay down.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A little while later I heard her talking
again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I walked into her room the
closet door was open and once again she said she was talking to her
friend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This happened for about a week
and I kept shutting the closet door and telling my daughter that she was not to
talk to her friend because it was nap time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even though the closet bothered me I figured that she was really just
playing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the last day it happened I
got angry and yelled at the door to leave my daughter alone!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That night my husband had fallen asleep on
the sofa when he said he heard our daughter start to cry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said that he heard her get out of bed and
come running down the hall and then around the corner and towards him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said right behind her was a little black
blob.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said it started around the corner
behind her but then stopped like it saw him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Right behind it was the door to our room that was open.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said it moved real fast through our door
and rounded the corner like it was going to the head of our bed where I was
laying.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He got up and ran into our room
but nothing was there and I was still asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
grew up in an old home on Jefferson Avenue in Elizabeth, NJ. this home
originally stood by itself on the block in the middle of a farm but over the
years, it is now a typical suburban/urban setting. When we moved in, it was a
typical suburban area with a large empty house and lot next door to us. Even
though that house was empty, our house was always considered the
&quot;creepy&quot; house of the block by the locals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
parents bought the house as a &quot;handyman special&quot; and, while
renovating it, my father told me that he once found bones in the plaster walls
and in the basement floor when putting in a new staircase. He said they were
large animal bones (not mice) and that they had been carefully placed and
wrapped up in cloth w/coins, feathers, and other items. They never reported it
to anyone for reasons known only to themselves. I think it was because the renovations
were made without permission from the city (knocking down walls, putting in
staircases, putting in an extra bathroom downstairs) and they did not want
trouble.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
of the walls where the bones were found was the stairwell leading up to the
attic. None of us like to go up there. When you were 1/2 up the stairs, you
would hear something moving behind you (but nothing was there) and feel a cold,
damp presence there even when it was hot and dry out. The lightbulb which lit
that area always burnt out or the bulb would pop suddenly for no reason. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
other area was the floor under the new staircase my father put in the basement.
he poured concrete down there (it had been packed dirt floor before). You
always heard shuffling feet in the basement and saw shadows where there
shouldn't be any. And, when you went down those stairs, you could feel a cold
hand reaching out from the stairs &amp; touching your ankles or grabbing your
hand as you reached the bottom of the handrail. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
father had also told me that at one time there had been a &quot;root
cellar&quot; down there, but my mother made him fill it in because it gave her
a &quot;bad feeling&quot;. That's where he built the new back stairs to the
yard and, if you sat on those stairs late at nite in late fall (why fall???
never could figure that one out), you could hear whispering voices under the
stairwell. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Although
we never discussed this when living there, my siblings and I have told each
other since then how frightened we were in that house growing up -- especially
in the attic and basement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

didn't believe in ghosts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After reading
this website, I have changed my mind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In

in the hall by my room (the floor creaked something terrible when walked
on).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone would be asleep I know
because I would call my brother's cell phone from my room and I would hear it
ring in his room and he would answer it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

my name is Scott Spangler and I am a native of Newport News, Virginia.<span

paranormal for the best part of my life (since I was about 10 or 11 years old).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was exploring your website and reading
through the haunted spots of Virginia, to see if there happened to be some that
I wasn't aware of.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was reading of the
Old House Woods in Matthews County and read something very interesting.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Described therein was reference to vehicles
being attacked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had never heard that before
and was unaware it had happened to anyone else.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I was on one of my many investigations there about 10 or 11 years ago
and as we were leaving the area something slammed into the car with enough
force to feel it inside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It came from
underneath the car.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We stopped the car
immediately to see what we had run over, there was nothing under or around the
car.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We stopped at the local convenience
store there in Matthews (7-11 or Little Sue) and could find no
explanation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The car was placed on a
lift the next day but still nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
have experienced many strange things at that place.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is probably the most haunted place that my
team and I have ever investigated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

bedroom (my parents) and talking.. all of a sudden patty screamed.. I looked at
her and she was looking above head.. as was my 2 sisters.. and they were white
and shaking... no one could move.. so i spoke and said &quot;what?&quot;.. when
they seemed to come a live... they began babbling...now, we were a poor family,
almost dirt poor.. and one of the things was the on some of the lamps in our
house didn't have lamp shades.. and i was sitting in front of one..<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>they said that behind me was this big black
shadow with two small white glowing eyes..... then they jumped up and ran
behind me.. (with the intention of protecting i was told..) and looked to see
what could've caused it.. maybe something on the light bulb.. nothing there....
and i was only about 3 feet away from the bulb.. which was only about a foot

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was about six or seven I can't remember my exact age, I know I was school
aged but it was late summer. My dad had already purchased my uniforms for the
year. My uniforms were how I found out that things in the house my father and
stepmother were currently renting were not exactly normal. One night My younger
sister and I were awoken by noises in the cabinet closet that was in our attic
bedroom (the room the two of us shared) we got up out of bed to see if it was
the cat who had gotten himself stuck in there on previous occasions by hiding
on the top shelf where we were too small to see. As we approached the closet
the rattling subsided. When we opened the doors we found that all of the
uniforms (which we were forbidden to touch before the school year due to the
risk of ruining their expencive starch and press) were all removed from their
plastic wraps and hangers. After rushing down the stair to tell dad (only to
receive a stern reprimand for what had been done to my uniforms) 'I should
clarify I was in private catholic school where as my sister by choice attended
public school' we refused to go back up stairs and so slept in the family room
cuddled as close to the family rottweiler as he would allow. The next evening
at the behest of our father we returned to our room for the evening and again
were awoken. Only this time it was the walls they were knocking and seemed to
be pulsing frightened we rushed to our father with our malady. Always the
sceptic he passed it off as an old house that probably with mice and promised
to set traps. In an attempt to comfort us in his own strange was he tried to
make us laugh by saying in a joking manner that &quot;they wont eat much&quot;
and gently pinching our tummys. Needless to say we again slept with poor Spike
our dog. As the third night approached we blatantly refused to go to our rooms
and thus were allowed to sleep in the nursury with our baby sister this was our
first night of peace and we slept like babies. After about a week in our own
room without further incident we begen to believe that it was all in out
imaginations after all<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>but at the end of
our week or so of peace we got what I think was a glimps of whatever had been
doing all of this I was awakened from my sleep from my blanket being removed
via the end of my bed I grabed for it only to look up and see a shadow looming
at the foot of the beds I was in such a terrible shock that I couldn't move so
I tried my voice and was able to say my sisters name though it same out as no
more that a weak series of squeaks. It did however prove effective and she
awoke as we staired at this entity for what I think was a few minutes it got
slightly more defined and then vanished all together. Frightened but still
leerie about waking out sceptical father we again slept on the rug with our dog
spike and cat sampson. I don’t know why we always went to the animals but to
our child selves they seemed like the safest place to be. I will never know for
sure what it was that we saw due to the fact that the verry next morning we
packed our backpacks with our most cherished toys and a couple outfits and ran
away the whole five blocks to our grandparents house. And were moved in at our
insistance that very day. She and I do agree on one thing on the rare occasions
that we speak of those horrible two weeks in the house on foss street is that
the figure at the foot of our beds was a man with a ponytail and a long coat.
To this day when I visit portland, Oregon if I happed to be traveling down
lombard avenue I never<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>look at that
house on the corner of lombard and foss. I now live in texas with my husband
and daughter. And exept for with my sister I have never dicussed that houes and
what we saw inside. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>oh

house. I guess the finally saw him too though they have never said so<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
moved into government reservation housing, which was set in a beautiful back

a friendly presence. We named the presence Elizabeth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
night, about 1:00Am, we both heard footsteps coming from the attic, down to the

all carpeted! The foosteps continued past our bedroom into the bathroom and
then we heard the stopper to the bathtub being pulled. Of course when I went to
investigate there was nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

my name is Sylvia, I was born in New Orleans, &amp; my Grandmother is a
Cherokee, I am told<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>by my God-Mother
that my GrandMother was a shaman and all the women in my family are psychic. I
know my daughter and I can see and know things pass our five senses, All my
life I have seen ghosts, as a small child I have been able to see and speak
with them, I remember living in a 200 year old wooden two story duplex house,
from 3 to 5 years old, and seeing a little old lady in a night gown and cap
coming up or down the curb stairway as I was going up or down, she would stair
at me sometimes, other times she act as if I was not there, I used to question
my Mom about her, she said she was the first owner of the house and she passed
away in the house. When I was small, people would die, and had the wakes in the
homes, in the living-rooms or parlor for a few days, I witness a # of ghost in
that manner. I have always lived in older homes that had ghosts in them, it
never scared me, I was used to them, I now live in San Diego, and my house has
ghosts and we get visiting ghosts at different time My dogs and cats see them
and alert us all the time, we smell flowers from my Mother-in-law, my Mom is
always around, and My Husband's father are my Pop smells of cigars when they
visit, We see our passed animals, and they rub our legs, are cry out and we
hear them. I have friends they have heard their names called, are feel strange
in my home, we have has fire balls pass through our home, I could write a book
on the different thing in my life that have accrued, Our residence ghost was a
painter that live here before us, he watches over us, as due our family
members. I also am in contact with my guardian Angel.. Michael, my daughter
helped me find him. I don't wish to bore any one, so I will stop now, and later
tell some of the things that have happen to me or my family in the pass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an older woman wearing a long cotton dress, nothing fancy.<span

narrowing towards the toe part of the shoes that came to a point, however she
was not standing on the floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was
short, with long grayish white hair sort of blowing gently.<span

me Laura, take my hand and come with me.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I still couldn't move or even speak.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I was so terrified. This repeated for just a few more seconds and I
thought that if I didn't get a grip and try harder to move or call for help
something bad might happen to me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I did
not fear her, I felt as though she was gentle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But none the less I didn't want to go anywhere with her.<span

able to move.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When she disappeared she
left like she was an eletrical enegry source.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

bed and started rubbing my eyes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
time I was sweaty. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>At the end of my bed,
I couldn't believe what I saw.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A young

worry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He has his hands up near his face

afraid he would attack me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I said out
loud, &quot;oh God, no please no.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

scared out of my mind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I went through my

undisturbed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Less than a year later I
was at my boyfriends home and I saw a young man walking down the hallway.<span

anyone and thought I was nuts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>This happend on December 23,1989. My
father had to go out of town to pick up relatives on (dec.23) and would return
by christmas<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>eve dinner. My<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>brother and myself were left home to be with my
mother. I remember that night of the 23rd as a rainy cold night. Usually when
my dad was out of town for business, my mom and brother would sometimes spend
the night in my room. Since i slept in a twin size bed, we all did not fit
together, so my mom would bring sheets and pillows and would sleep on the floor
beside my bed with my brother, like having our own little slumber party. there
is a hallway that leads me directly to my parents rooms and in between our
rooms to the right there is a bathroom. On that night of the 23rd, we all went
to the room watched a little t.v and slept. Let me give you a little scenario
on how my room was, my bed was placed against a wall, i always liked to sleep
facing a wall not a door or a closet. So, anyway I would say at approximately
2am i heard a man's cough and clearing of the throat, I also heard the sheets
from my parents bed pull up, as if someone was trying to cover themselves, i
heard the mattress, as if someone was making themselves comfortable. In my mind
i was thinking it was my dad coming home earlier than expected, but what was
weird<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>is that my dad is the type that
likes to make noise when he comes home, in other words he likes people to know
he is home,he turns on all the lights in the house including the hallway light,
which would then really wake us up, beacuse i didn't sleep with my bedroom door
closed. But on this night he didn't turn on anything or told us he was home.
So, since he didn't say anything to us i thought i would go to my parents room
and see him, but i got lazy. So, from my bed i just leaned as far as could to
see if i get a glanze of him, but i didn't and in order to get up and go to the
room i had to jump over my mom and brother that were sleeping on the floor, so
i just let it be and didn't <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>mind it. I
said to myself that i would see him in the morning. Well, morning came and
about<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>7 or 8am my mom woke me up and
told me to keep an eye on my brother while she goes to the groceries and buys
what she needed for that nights dinner. Half asleep i told her ok, but then
something clicked and thought &quot; hey my dad is home&quot;,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>why is she telling me to keep an eye on my
brother. So, i quickly jumped out of bed and ran to my parents room to see my
dad, to my surprise my dad wasn't home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The bed was still nicely made and no signs that somebody slept there, my
body got goosebumps, because i knew what i heard that early morning in my
parents room. So, I ran back to my room, woke my bother, i turned all the
lights on, my t.v. and the radio that was in the living room. I then, opened
the front door and the backdoor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
stayed in the kitchen with my brother until my mom arrived. when she finally
arrived i didn't mention anything to her, but i was staying put in the kitchen,
she asked why everything was on and i made up a story that the house was too
silent. So, i asked my mom if she heard anything that early morning, she looked
at me and asked &quot;like what&quot;? So, i told her that i heard coughing and
pulling of the sheets, etc...The only thing she could say to me was &quot; YOU
HEARD IT TOO&quot;? She told me she heard the same thing i heard and when she
was leaving in the morning to go to the groceries, she was going to tell my dad
to keep an eye on us, especially my brother since he was 3 at that time. But,
she saw he wasn't there and it freaked her out and maybe thought it was her
imagination or a dream she was having. To this day we still talk about our
Christmas eve incident. What we know about that house is that a father and son
were murdered in that house by i believe drug dealers. I do believe their
spirit still wanders around, but i don't believe they are there to harm us, at
least that's what i think since we were living in that house for 12yrs.
Sometimes, i would be washing dishes and i always felt someone watching me,
since my back was towards our living room i was always jittery that someone was
in the living room or right behind me watching me. i do admit it was scary at
time being in that house until we moved.My parents rent it out to family
members and i should say to this day, my cousin mentioned to me once that when
she's sleeping she feels pressure on her chest, like if she's unable to move or
sometimes sees shadows in her room, it freaks her out and i would say that
house still gives me the jitters when i visit my cousins. I know this story
probably seemed long, but i am fascinated with details, i really enjoy reading
other peoples' stories. YOUR WEB PAGE IS GREAT!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

NOT LONG AGO, MYSELF AND A FRIEND WERE TALKING ABOUT SPIRITS OVER THE PHONE,
HOW SHE TOO HAS EXPERIENCED WEIRD THINGS IN HER APARTMENT. I WAS TELLING HER MY
CHRISTMAS EVE STORY AND WHAT HAD HAPPEND TO THIS FATHER AND SON MURDER, WHEN MY
PHONE LINE MADE A LOUD SCREAMING NOISE, AFTER THAT NOISE I COULD HEAR HER TALK,
BUT SHE COULDN'T HEAR ME, THEN OUR LINES DISCONNECTED WITH NO DIAL TONE. I
FREAKED OUT BECAUSE OUR PHONE LINES ARE UNDERGROUND, SO IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
DUE TO HIGH WINDS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ANYWAY, I QUICKLY CALLED HER AND ASKED
WHAT HAPPEND TO THE PHONE AND SHE TOLD ME THAT HER LINE WAS FINE THAT I WAS THE
ONE THAT GOT DISCONNECTED. THAT HAS BEEN<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

Father-in-law's Mom died about 10 years ago. While sitting at the table talking
about Grandma to his parents, my husband leaned back in his chair and lifted
his hat slightly off of his head (it was a hot day.) From inside his hat came a
sound like that of someone scratching three times inside the hat with her
nails. My husband jumped and threw his hat across the room. He said he could
feel a hand inside of his hat. He said,&quot;Please don't do that Grandma, it
gave me a start.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dad died two years later. He was renowned for his tomato garden. It was the
most fantastic garden you have ever seen, prize winning tomatoes. We say,
instead of flowers, put a tomato on Dad's grave, that is how important they
were to him. We had lived in our home for 6 years. In front was a rock garden
with no plantings. It was there when we moved in. One year after Dad's death,
we found his pocket knife, open in our driveway. It had been missing since his
death. It was not rusted. A few days later, we noticed something growing in the
rock garden. A tomato plant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

still have a little girl that for some reason stays with me I have had her
around me since I can remember my grandmother tells me of stories of when I was
younger of how I played with her and how I used to cry when she pulled my hair.
She now lives with me in my house and she is always peeking around the corner
at me. And letting me know that she is around. I do not need any help, all the
bad experiences are behind us now. I just happen to come to your site and
thought maybe you would like to here a little about the good experience I have
had with ghosts. I have had my share of bad and so has my family. From what I
understand my grandmothers house at one time was put in to a magazine or news
paper about haunted houses. I have so many stories, I will tell you about some
of them a little later. But I am just happy that there are people out there
helping people that do not know how to handle things like ghosts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The story of my basement goes all the way
back to my early childhood <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>when
my parents first purchased their house. I was seven years old and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>fearless.
My sister and I moved into the refinished basement in bedroom <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>across
from eachother. My room always felt warm and safe, but when you <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>enter
into my sisters room you always felt cold and uneasy. As a child I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>would
never stay in her room if I was alone. She swore that she never <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>suppected
anything and that I was just letting my imagination run away <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>with
me. My mother has always been able to feel others present in our <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>home.
Besides seeing some spirts on our back porch a couple of years ago <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>she
has always felt that our home was safe and not haunted. We were <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>brought
up to understand that there are spirits wondering around looking <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>for
their place to move on to, so we have always been understanding if a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>spirit
would pass through our house. We never really talk about &quot; Ghosts <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>&quot;
in a scary mannor, they are just &quot;spirits&quot; to us. Well when I was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>about
twelve years old my sister who is two years older than I, went <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>away
to her first summer camp. It was the first time since we moved in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>that
I would be alone in the basement. Steering clear of her room,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>would
keep her door shut so I wouldn't look inside while I walked by. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Well
the week passed and one of my friends came to stay the night. Since <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>my
bed was small and my sisters was big, my friend and I decided to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>brave
out the night and sleep in her room. This is the night that I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>would
see my first ghost. A couple hours after we had finally fallen <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>asleep,
I woke to the sound of clanging hangers in the closet which sets <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>directly
in front of the bed. Nervous I gently pulled the covers over my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>head.
Still feeling weary I sat up so i could turn the light on, that is <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>when
I saw it, standing there at the foot of the bed. I was so terrified <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>that
It was merly a quick glance before I went back under the covers and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>began
to yell for my dad. When my dad came in the ghost was gone. Since <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>this
night my sister and I both have continually heard the clacking <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>noise
and often seen a glowing light float out of the closet just for a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>moment.
Since we discovered the spirit in the basement we have <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>encountered
two other spirits in our house. In my younger brothers <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>bedroom
in the upstairs of my house lives a little boy spirit. My entire <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>family
has seen the young boy in the hallway leading to my brothers room <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>late
at night. Often we would be up going to the bathroom in the middle <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>of
the night and some of my brothers marble collection would find its <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>way
out to the hallway and gently roll down the hallway to the living <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>room.
This has only happened a couple times but we have all seen it. The <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>other
spirit is an older man that likes to walk on our side patio in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>evening
and glance into the kitchen windows. My mother is the only <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>witness
to this spirit, but many times she has been up cooking in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>evening
and glanced up seeing the spirit glancing right back at her, but <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>only
for a short moment before he will dissapear. I am now grown and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>moved
out to college, and still everytime I go home and go into my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>About
10 years ago, my home was flooded due to a hose breakage on our washing
machine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It ran all day and soaked the
carpet to the concrete.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had to have
the carpet lifted and huge fans were brought in to dry them out.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fans were so loud I had trouble getting
to sleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, my mom sent me to stay
with my aunt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her house was located in
one of the ritziest parts of town, but with the oldest homes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were mansions that were built at least
80 years ago and had been renovated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her
home originally was utilized as a carriage house for the mansion next door, but
had been sold off years after it was built to acquire additional money as a
&quot;2nd&quot; property.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was quite
lovely, though small, but it had a dark secret.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was haunted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The night I went
to stay was the last night I ever stayed there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My aunt had told us stories recounting ghostly occurrences, but none of
us ever experienced anything, until that night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
put me in the living room on the pull out couch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was just off the kitchen, which you had to
walk through in order to get to the stairwell that led up to the master
bedroom, bathroom &amp; laundry area.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
fell asleep pretty quickly, but awoke around 2am to a strange feeling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was almost if I were suffocating.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked around and saw nothing but the small
night light in the kitchen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I started to
drift back to sleep when I heard running upstairs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I sat up quickly, it sounded as though
someone was headed down the stairwell and into the kitchen, but no one
came.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I laid on my side facing away from
the kitchen hoping that whatever it was would stop.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My aunt had told us of the
&quot;poltergeist's&quot; fondness for the magnets on the side of the
microwave.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As soon as I heard it hit the
floor I knew what it was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Somehow I got
up the courage to investigate, just to prove or disprove my theory of the
magnets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There they were, laying in the
middle of the kitchen floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
microwave sat on a cart, in the middle of the cart.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How these magnets fell off and found their
way to the floor was beyond me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I picked
them up and put them back in place and ran back to the pull out.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not ten minutes later, that familiar
&quot;magnetic&quot; sound happened again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This time I did not move, just stayed very still and started to
pray.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt a pressing feeling on my
back, nothing physical, just ominous.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
felt something brush against the bottom of the bed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was it, the covers went over my head and
I started to beg God to protect me from whatever this was.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As soon as I started praying, I began to feel
better.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I drifted off to sleep and that
was the end of my encounter, or at least the end of my conscious
encounter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't know if it was merely
my imagination or reality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All I know
is, my aunt is not a person who makes up stories, and that night I found her
tales to be ironclad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know what I
believe now, do you?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>From
the fall of 1999 to the fall of 2000, my mother, my husband, my young son (who
was a few days short of turning one when we moved in) and myself lived in the
house of this story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is in
Texas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were renting the house from
the mother of a little boy who went to the same daycare as my son.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we moved in, my husband and I noticed
some blood on the baseboards in the master bedroom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I mentioned it to the babysitter and she told
me this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently, the owner and her
two sons were living there at the time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Her estranged husband had been stalking her and knew exactly when she
would be home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One night, she came home
a little late and the kids were not with her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She noticed that the door was open and her ex-husband's jacket was
hanging just inside the door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She didn't
go in, but instead went to the neighbor's to call the police.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the police arrived, her ex-husband was
on the bed in the master bedroom, where he had shot his brains out.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That's where the blood came from and
apparently not all of it was cleaned up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Anyway, shortly after we moved in, my son started having extremely bad
nightmares.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were not able to wake him
up and would have to hold his arms and legs so that he didn't hurt himself or
us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He would be screaming, crying and
thrashing around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We would have to put
him in the car and drive around to calm him down.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This happened every night for a few
weeks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In February of 2000, I found out
I was expecting our youngest child.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shortly after that is when the ghost comes into the picture.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From the time we moved in to the time we saw
the ghost, we would hear noises almost every night that sounded like someone
was walking down the hall (wood floors) wearing work boots.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People kept saying there was probably an
animal under the house, so we brushed it off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then, one night, my mother, my son and I were in the front room and my
husband was asleep in the bedroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
could clearly see him on the bed from the living room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My son was asleep on the couch and my mother
and I looked up and saw what appeared to be a tall man (the top of his head
would have touched the top of the door frame).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He had sandy blond hair and was wearing work boots, jeans and a
t-shirt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had a black aura around him,
which I think is because he was a disturbed person in life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was standing just outside the door of the
master bedroom and looking into the room that was the kids' bedroom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I knew it wasn't my husband, as I saw through
this man and could see my husband laying in bed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mother was standing right next to me and
could see the same thing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next
morning I mentioned it to my husband and he said he had seen this apparition
once before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I talked to the babysitter
and told her to let me describe someone I had seen, and see if she knew who it
could be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I described this person and
she said it was the owner's ex-husband (who of course, was dead).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We never saw him again, but continued to hear
him occassionally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My son's extreme
nightmares did not return.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shortly after
we had seen him, we spoke to him when we felt like he was around and told him
that his wife and sons were no longer living in town and that we were going to
live there and take care of the house and things would be fine.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We asked him to please leave us and our
children alone and experienced only one other thing shortly before we moved
out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One day, shortly after deciding to
move, we came home to an empty house to find the shower door completely
shattered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was no way anyone could
get in the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe he was upset
that he would have to deal with new people?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I don't know and I can't explain that incident.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>I had mentioned the story to a neighbor
shortly after we moved out and she and another neighbor had both apparently
seen him walk through the front door in the middle of the night while we were
living there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They had also seen him
walk up and down the street and walk through the door of another neighbor's
house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People tell me they would have to
see a ghost to believe it, well I believe it because I've seen it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
am not sure where to start, except by telling you that my name is Nichole. I am
formerly from Mt. Holly, NJ as a matter of fact I lived on Church Street which
is across the street from Volunteer Fire House number 1. I always rememberd
weird feelings when ever I would walk by. But anyhow, that's not the reason I
am writing. The reason I am writing is because I remember when my Pop-Pop died,
although I was not even 2 at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
fater was sationed at Altus AFB in Oklahoma, my grandparents were back in New
Jersey, the year was April of 1985. I woke up to see a man standing in my room
at the edge of my bed, I know it was sometime in the middle of the night. I
remember not being scared, I was happy that he was there, although I had no
idea who he was. I climbed out of my crib and into my parents room (this was
not an uncommon thing for me to do at the time so my parents have told me), the
next morning we recieved the phone call from my grandmother in New Jersey that
my Pop-Pop had passed away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>However,
it would not be until we came home from the funeral, back to Oklahoma that I
would tell my parents what occured. The night we came home both of my parents
were putting me to bed, and as we walked down the hall, we passed by a picture,
the picture had only been put up that day. I asked my dad to lift me up, he
asked me why, I replied: &quot;I wanna kiss Pop-Pop good night&quot; this perplexed
my parents since as I said before I was not quite 2 yet. My parents then asked
me which one was my Pop-Pop (there were three people in the picture) I pointed
to the man in the middle and told them that, that was my Pop-Pop, my mother
asked me how I knew that. I told her &quot;because he came to visit me in my
room one night&quot;. Ever since then my mother has always told me that my
Pop-Pop was my guardian angel, and that he came to tell me goodbye. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
also think it fitting to tell that I believe he knew who I was going to marry.
A few years later when we moved back to New Jersey my grandmother had cleaned
out his office and had a found a doll wrapped up for me. It was a Cabbage Patch
doll, he was dressed in a sailor uniform, and my favorite saying as a child was
&quot;Red sky at night, sailor's delight. Red sky in the morning, sailors take
warning&quot;, now at the age of 21 I find myself married to a sailor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>And

here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a child I grew up in a small community in central West Virginia , whom<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am sure most of<span

my family was quite haunted. The house was purchased by my parents from an
elderly gentleman. After several months of living in this home, weird things
begin to happen such as, lights going on and off by themselves andwhile
everyone in the house was in bed) the TV would also do this.My older sister
also had an organ, that for some reason would start playing the song <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Several relatives who at one time or another spent the night, would later tell
my parents that &quot;something&quot; would pull on the bottom of the
blankets.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were several erie things
that occurred in this home, however the scariest of all, occurred in the
bathroom. On quite a few occasions our family would awaken in the morning to
get ready for work/school to find the old claw foot tub filled up with water
and it would be overflowing. My step-father finally decided to call the
previous owner and see if he could get some information on the house. We found
out that the owners elderly mother lived in this house with he and his wife and
had expired there- in the bathrooms bathtub. And one of this woman's favorite
pasttimes was playing the organ for her church. Needless to see , these
experiences were frightening but we became used to them and eventually they
stopped. My parents no longer live there, haven't for about 10 years now but I
often wonder if those who live there now are or have experienced any of these
experience<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Never
composed any mail like this before, and it's nearly 2am where I'm at now. So
this may be more of a product of me just being &quot;bored&quot; late at night,
but it's nevertheless something that I think about on a daily basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>First
off, finding any chat room on AOL to discuss something like this seriously is
like trying to find an honest politician. I've known that for years, but I
guess the human psyche persists at finding the most instant and direct
communication to air something that's bugged you long enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>First
off, I believe my house may be haunted. I (and my friends) have had nearly
innumerable instances where something just &quot;wasn't right&quot;. A trash
can that moved itself across the floor in the middle of the night (in the dark,
so I couldn't see it'd moved until I turned on the light), strange noises
repeating themselves during a period of time... my own mother swears that she's
seen an old man twice in this house who just vanished after she looked directly
at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
was always a skeptic (although an interested one), as I was really wanting to
actually *see* something happen right in front of my own eyes. To me, it seems
easy to think that your imagination may be running away with you - at least,
until you see something with your own eyes that defies explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
most memorable experience - and one that will stay with me my entire life, I'm
sure - happened one night at somewhere around 2:30 to 3am. I commonly keep late
nights, and was doing something mundane on the computer. My dog was lying on
the floor to the right of me and facing the door (the door is almost directly
behind me). She suddenly began barking furiously, as if someone had<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>knocked on the front door of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It's
not uncommon for me to receive late night visitors, but the dog's steady in her
way of running to the front door when she reacts to a knock on it. At first, I
shrugged it off that she'd just heard something that may've sounded like a
knock, and immediately tried to shush her with a harsh word and a glare. When
she continued to bark, I had the sudden realization that she hadn't moved from
where she was at... and a second look at her told me that her gaze was
transfixed on the doorway that was directly behind me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>At
that point, I pretty much got the whole concept of that theatrical element in
movies where the background seems to zoom out and away from the actor/actress's
head while they're looking into the camera for the dramatic effect that they're
just catching onto something. Though I normally drone off to sleep at about
that hour, I was quickly and acutely aware that I was wide awake... and that if
I turned around, I would see someone behind me. The moments that followed
seemed to have moved in slow-motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
dog was still at attention and barking like crazy, but that all kinda became
muted to me (and this dog loves people - generally only reacting to a noise at
the door, then quickly looking to get affection after the door's opened). When
I looked over my shoulder, there was someone standing just outside of my
doorway - as if they were peeking around the corner at me. I got a glimpse of
half of the upper torso, the right arm, and part of the head - it was partially
obscured by the shadow that was cast from the lamp back over my left shoulder.
It wasn't floating, glowing, or anything that would stereotypically tip me off
that I was seeing something out of the ordinary... and it only moved once I'd
turned around - it retreated as a burglar probably would. That moment probably
only lasted two to four seconds, but it seemed more like ten to me. It could've
been the dog's unusual reaction that got me keyed up, but I got the immediate
instinct that I was seeing something that I shouldn't normally be seeing. I
may've sat there, stunned, for another ten seconds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Afterwards,
I ignored my basic instinct to go get a firearm before searching the front of
the house where the figure had run off to (another instinct kicked in that I
wouldn't find any trace of what I'd seen). I moved forward quickly to check all
the doors and windows (and behind/under the furniture), and I found them all
still locked from the inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
whole experience kept me awake for another few hours, as I was really jacked up
on adrenaline. I wasn't freaked out, threatened, or even scared. I was more in
a state of &quot;Wow!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>In
a second and seperate incident, I also took pictures of a certain place in the
French Quarter of New Orleans that was once (supposedly) a morgue - but since
transformed into a small bar. Going on memory, I believe it's called the
Babylon Club. There are two pictures (both taken with an Olympus D-360L digital
camera) that show almost countless numbers of these &quot;orb&quot; things. I'd
be happy to e-mail the both of them over to you, as these seem to be a popular
media article... and I'd be extra happy to get some sort of bonafide
photographer's explanation of why they may occur. Though I've never developed
film, I have a slight grasp of where water droplets may create deformations on
regular cameras... but I'm 200% sure that this is a digital camera that doesn't
use water to generate its images. 8) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Of
course I said yes, and she prayed for her, I prayed for her and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

thanked her so much and she walked out of the room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyhow,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>walked
in the room and said they were from St Rose church and asked <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>if
we would like to pray with them, and I told them that sister Anna <o:p></o:p></span></p>

come very early in the morning...they looked at each other and looked <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>back
at me, and asked again who had come.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
told them, Sister Anna, she told <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that was her name, and I told them what she had said.<span

she lay there, her face looked worried, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
said outloud, Its okay momma, its your time to go, I will be okay... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
have always been skeptical about the existence of ghosts. I’m 33 years old and
always wondered why it was that others have had “experiences” and I never have.
Why is that? I mean sure I’ve had the little hairs stand up on the back of my
neck for “no reason” and the cold chills while standing in a warm room with not
much in way of vents, so forth and so on. But, the scientific side of me always
explains those situations away. Well…… all but one. About 5 or 6 years ago my
family (wife and two sons) and I lived in an apartment. It was a two story
apartment and we lived on the second floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Our place was small, about 700 sq ft. I woke up one night around 1:30 or
2 in the morning. I thought I heard a noise in our living room. I laid in my
bed perfectly still with my eyes wide open and just listened. After some time
of pure silence I explained the noise as just apart of a dream that I was
having. Have you ever had a dream that seem so real that once you woke it
actually takes you a while to realize that it was not real? Well, that was the
conclusion I came to. I decided to try and go back to sleep, but just then I
heard foot steps on the carpet in my living room…………not good……If I was on the
first floor I could say that the foot steps were just from the people on the
second floor….but I was the one on the second floor so I couldn’t explain the
foot steps I was hearing. My wife was in bed next to me sleeping soundly. My
sons were solid sleepers and had been asleep for several hours by then. The
foot steps stopped. I could not believe what I had heard. I waited and listened
for them to start up again. It didn’t take long before I clearly heard the
walking around again! My heart was racing a thousand miles a second; some body
was in my house!!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Naturally
being the man of my home, I kept perfectly still under my covers and prayed
that who ever it was did not come down or tiny hallway!! Our bed room door was
open and the whole house was dark except for the street light or moon light
creeping in. Which ever, it allowed just enough light to where I could see in
the darkness. As I said, I laid perfectly still with my eyes wide opened just
gazing over the tips of my blankets toward my opened doorway. What? I wasn’t
scared…. I just wanted to have the surprise advantage if the burglar were to
come into my room….I wanted him to think I was asleep and then I’d pounce on
him…..that’s all… …ok..so I’m laying there, still hearing the foot steps when
they started coming our way toward the hallway. The steps were so crisp and
unmistakable and they were most definitely in our house! The foot steps came
into the hall and right into my doorway but continued passed my room and headed
toward my children’s room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was just
one of the kids sleep walking, right? Wrong……….remember, I was watching the
hall through my open door the whole time, no body ever passed by. Too, my kids
were young and no where near the weight that it would have taken to make the
sound of these steps. By now I jumped up and ran to the kid’s room, just 10
feet or so away. I pushed open there door which was ajar. The boys were both
wrapped in their blankets sound asleep. Oh ya, no body else was in their room
any where. I looked in the bath room, pulled back the shower curtain, no body.
I went back into the living room and kitchen and back in my bedroom
again……noth…ing……I staid up for some time after that, laying still in my bed,
listening, heart still racing, thinking……………….. to this day, I can not explain
it……..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Well
I read some of the postings on here, and I have herd many true chilling stories
in my life time from my mother, and I have encountered a few myself. The first
one that I read on this sight I actually really relate to. See for years, it
doesn’t matter where I live I have had the same paralyzing experience. I will
wake up and feel paralyzed, I can’t move, my whole body tingles, I can’t open
my eyes, and I can’t breathe, then boom I can move, and I can see and I can
breathe. I don’t know what it is, but ever since the first time to the last
time it recently happened to me I have always felt like something was doing it
to me. I didn’t feel like something was there with me, or standing over me,
more or less like something was trying to take over me and not really
succeeding. It scares me every time, but shortly after I gain control, I feel
alone. When I was younger me and my family lived in a house that was haunted. I
know it was because when I shared my experience with my parents, they said that
they had seen things all the time, even named one familiar ghost “sparkles”
because it was the shape of an old woman made of a bunch of little sparkles.
Well that was nothing like what I saw, I wish I could have seen her instead of
what I saw… I was probably around 5 or 6, and I woke up at 1am from a dead
sleep and sat up in my bed for no reason. I felt as if someone was not just in
my room, but in the house. Well I thought it could be my dad coming home from
work late, but I didn’t see his truck outside my bedroom window. I looked to my
left, and in my vanity chair was the shape of a man sitting in the pose of the
“thinking statue” he had his hand on his chin as if deep in thought, staring at
the wall… well he had to be 7 or 8 feet tall he was huge. And I remember
blinking my eyes as hard as I could because I wanted to be dreaming. He was
made of all kinds of bright colors. He didn’t illuminate my room, it was just
the color that he was. He then took his hand off of his chin and turned his
head to look at me. That could only last a few seconds because the look that he
gave me, gives me chills up my back to this day 15 years after the incident. I
didn’t want to get out of bed because that would make me closer to him, I
couldn’t run to my door because I would have to run past him, I turned my head,
and slowly laid down and closed my eyes telling myself over and over again that
I didn’t see it. The next morning, I woke up to my alarm clock, and I got out
of bed to walk out of my room, and I stopped, I remembered it second for second
what happened. And I was scared all over again. I don’t know if scared really
fits the description, I think terrified is more like it. not because I saw
something that I cant explain, but because that look that he gave me, it felt
as if he was looking into me, and he hated what he saw, like he hated me, like
he despised me. It felt like evil was looking me straight in the face, and I
don’t know to this day what I would do if this ever happened to me again. My
mother told me a story once of a male figure that she saw when she was younger,
she said that he was just about that tall , he had to be like 7 or 8 feet tall,
but she didn’t see him right away, she was drifting off to sleep on the cough
and started to slowly see little men very very short men looking at her with
strange faces, she thought at first that she was falling asleep and seeing
things, until a tall man that I already described to you appeared. Well he
didn’t look at her, he pushed down on her face so she couldn’t get up and she
said that she felt it trying to open her legs. Well she struggled and got free
and jumped up and everything was gone. She thought okay, that must have been a
scary dream, which felt very real. Well it happened again as she laid down and
started drifting to sleep. So once again she struggled free and ran to bed with
my dad. This happened to her before I was even thought of, it wasn’t in the
same house or anything… I don’t know who this guy is, or what he does. But if
anyone else has ever seen him, please let me know what happened to you. As far
as I know my mother is the only other person that has seen him. I have a few
more stories, but nothing as that intense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hello!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My name is Brooke, and I live in a small
county in Kentucky.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I was growing
up, my family and I lived in my grandmother's (my moms mother) house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We remodled the old house to better suit our
tastes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, my mom always told us
that she was 'prone' to ghostly encounters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She once told me that when she was a teenager, she was home alone with
her mother, and there was a knock at the door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She went to answer the door, and found her uncle there, asking for a
ride into town.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had snowed and there
was atleast 6 inches of snow on the ground and the some on the carport.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She told her uncle that she needed to get her
keys and to tell her mom where she was going.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When she told her mom what she was going to do, my grandmother looked at
her strangely and told her that her uncle had died a few days ago in a car/train
wreck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mom went back to the door, and
no one was there......not even footsteps leading to or away from the door.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was the best ghost experience that I can
reca her haveing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, years later
when my mom, dad, my sisters, and I moved into the home, after my grandmother
had died, I had an experience of my own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It wasn't anything terrifying, but just hard to explain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was asleep in my bed, when I awoke to a
strange noise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned on the light,
and searched all over my bedroom to find where the noise was comeing from.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On top of my chest-of-drawers, was my 35mm
camera, and it was automatically rewinding.....on its own..<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I picked it up, and it continued.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I went downstairs to tell my mom, but when I
got there, I changed my mind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was 3 in
the morning, and I was afraid<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I would
make her mad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I sat the camera down on
the kitchen counter, and went to the bathroom, all the while the camera<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>still rewinding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After I came out of the bathroom, I picked
the camera back up and it stopped rewinding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I checked the compartment where the film is put, and there was no film
in the camera.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I checked the battery
compartment, and there were no batteries either.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>You can sometimes feel a presence in her
house, and we know that it is my grandmother, checking on us.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mom has a 'snow globe' that plays the hymn
&quot;Amazeing Grace&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She would
often awake to this snow globe playing, and knew that is was her mother, because
that was her favorite hymn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

would like to share an experience that I had as a teenager back in the summer
of 1977.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My parents were young when I
was born (both were 19) and so I grew up knowing my great-grandparents as well
as grandparents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
paternal great-grandmother (grandmother's mother) was a three pack a day
smoker, and developed throat cancer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
had been very doting when I was younger, sewing dresses for special occasions,
but since she fell ill was unable to do that anymore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
died in June, 1977,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>during the middle of
the night. At that time I felt something touching my foot, and remember
awakening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I saw her standing at the
foot of the bed, and was like a vision, and the colors in the background were
very vivid, bright colors, not like what I have seen here on earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
wore a white outfit with gold braid trim, and in my mind I heard her say that
she was sorry that she had to go, that she would miss me, and would wait for
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Her
funeral was three days later, and was open casket.. what she was wearing was
the same outfit I saw in the dream.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
asked my Gram (her daughter) why she was wearing this one particular outfit,
and Gram told me it was her favorite one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was a few years younger, I used to sleep on the downstairs couch on the
weekend all of the time. You see, my living room has a large opening that leads
to the staircase that leads upstairs, so you can clearly see anything that
passes through there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Once
when I was sleeping downstairs, I woke up when it was still dark and I looked
at the clock, it was 3:55 A.M. So, I just layed there, trying to fall back
asleep, but I couldn't, so I decided to watch the clock. Right when the clock
turned to 4:00 A.M., I heard something in the kitchen. No one had gotten up, I
would have seen them. So my first thought was my cats, but then I remembered
that we had shut them in the basement for the night, so my mind quickly
flickered to the thought of a burgurlar. My heart started to race, because
there I was, a little eight year old girl alone in her dark living room. I had
pulled the covered up to my face as I kept hearing the noises. Then, footsteps
came down the hall that led from the kitchen to the stairs; right in front of
that big opening. I started to panic, obviously. But as e footsteps got closer,
nothing happened, they were right in front on the living room, but there was no
one to whom the footsteps were comng from. Then they slowly headed up the
stairs and then there was nothing. Right as they reached the top of the stairs,
they were gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
was so freaked out, I turned on all the lights in the living room and played a
video game til everyone else got up. I hadn't dared looked up the stairs. Ever
since that night, I always sleep in my own bed, in my own room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>But
I have no other explaination for it, it could have been a ghost, because it
most certainly wasn't a person, not something living. I may not be able to
explain it, but I do know something for sure: It was one of the strangest
things that has ever happened to me<o:p></o:p></span></p>

about what had happen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To this day I
know I spoke to a little girl.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>About
two years ago I had moved out of my parents house to an old summer house that
had been turned into an apartment building. The house had been many things
before becoming an apartment building, it was first the summer house of an
opera singer in Washington DC, then a hotel, then what it is today an apartment
building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>At
first nothing happened at all, I don't know if it was b/c my boyfriend at the
time and I didn't have alot when we first moved in or what, (all we had was his
bed and a computer chair as far as furniture went.) Not too long after that my
Great Grandmother passed away and she had told my Grandma that if anything
happened to her in the next couple of weeks of us moving that I was to get
everything in her apartment, she did this often when she found out any of us
where moving out b/c she was 94 and really didn't want to go on any longer. So
when she had passed My Father, boyfriend and I went to her apartment and got as
much as we could with one trip. About a week after that, odd things happened. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>First
it started off with strange scraching sounds on the floor next to our bed (like
a cat scratching his nails) late at night that were so loud that it would wake
me up, not alot but it did get worse threw out the weeks and made it very hard
for me to sleep. It even got so bad that my boyfriend would hear it and yell at
me for trying to freak him out &amp; he is a sound sleeper, nothing wakes him
up. Luckly for us or so we thought the land lady was coming by to do her spring
check on things in the building, so we asked her if anyone had said anything
about this happening to them before, although she said no I could tell that she
was lying b/c she got a little pale. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>For
a couple of weeks after that the sound had stopped, only in it's place you
would smell vanilla, just like the scratching sound it would be light but as
the more time went by it would get stronger and it was only in one part of the
apartment, the bedroom. I thought that it was the upstair's or next door
neighboro's that were doing something to cause the smell (keep in mind that b/c
of age of this building, the walls were really thin, and I know that smell
would get threw b/c the guy upstairs would always show up when we were about to
eat and join us. Not that we minded.) The lady next door said that it wasn't
her. She even showed me all of the items that she had in her apartment and not
one of them were vanilla or smelled like it. So that left the guy upstairs, but
he was a trucker and he was very hard to get ahold of, so that left me with
having doubts that it was him. Well one night when I was getting ready to go
out when smell came back stronger then ever, this time it filled up the whole
apartment and caused me to run out w/out locking the door. The trucker just so
happened to be outside w/his brother working on his truck and saw me running
out (I also happened to fall b/c we get really bad ice storms were I live and
the land lady does not like to clear the walkways.) He came up to see if I was
okay and why I ran out like a bat out of hell. So I explained to him what had
been happening while he picked me up. He walked me up to his apartment and
showed me just like the woman that lived next door to us his apartment that he
did not have anything that would smell like vanilla, the man didn't even have
an air freshner in his bathroom. He even took me to everyone else in the
apartment building to meet them and to asked on my behalf if there was anyone
using anything that would smell like vanilla, and again no one was. By this
point I was freaking out. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>He
then explained to me about how old building was and what had happened. It seems
that the opera singer had passed away in the house and it was then taken over
by the state to be sold. When it was a hotel, it seems that a night manager had
been murdered (which was odd to find out b/c I live in a small town where
nothing ever happens.) along with a couple other guest. And since it has been
an apartment building there have been 3 deaths, one of them happening in my
apartment about 5 years before I moved in. Since the truck driver had lived in
the building for years I had to know more details. It seems that she was an
older lady with a bite of a weight problem, she had not lived their long but
loved the building and the area in general, she would sit on the main porch in
front of her part of the building in the afternoon and greet everyone as they
came home. She would invite people in and the trucker said that the apartment
would smell like vanilla, not strong but it was inviting and pleasent. Her
weight ended up being the end of her. After that I knew what I had to do, I
called my boyfriend who was at work and told him I would be late (ok, later
then what I was b/c this all took about an hour), b/c I was going to fix our
little problem w/sounds and smells. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
asked the trucker to come in the apartment which still had the vanilla smell to
and asked him to over me. I asked our 'ghost' if there was any way that we
could come to terms w/the vanilla smell and sound if it was her making them.
That we were peaceful people and if we did something she didn't like then she
could let us know w/the smell of vanilla. And I also asked her to please not
make the scratching sound b/c it was making it hard me for me to sleep at
night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
guess that she agreed to it b/c after that it stopped, the only time we smelled
vanilla or heard anything was when I burnt dinner, but then again it the smell
of vanilla was better then burnt mac and cheese.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
dad grew up in Closplint, Kentucky and has told me many stories about Child's
Creek Bridge. He said once when he was a teenager he was walking home from a
friends house. There used to be a old empty house across the river from the
bridge. He saw a woman walk out of the house to a tree that stood in the front
yard and she watched him walk down the road until the house was out of sight.
He said that Child's Creek<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>was the only
place on that road that he hated to walk by. I have a story that happened to me
when I lived in Verda, Kentucky. My dad and I lived in a trailer at the end of
a road at the Verda Camp.The trailer that I lived in was on a place where an
old dance hall once stood.After my dad passed away some friends and I where
standing in my bedroom and the trailer was underpinned all the way around it.
There was no way that anyone could have got under it and in between my and a
friend of mine there was four thumps on the floor that came from under the
trailer and to this day I haven't a clue what that was. Another story in the
same trailer is, I went to Indiana to visit my mother for a week and there was
a friend of dads that stayed with him. Dad heard somebody walking in the
trailer and got up to check on the guy that was staying with him and he was
asleep. Later that night the guy heard somebody walking through the trailer got
up and checked on dad on dad was asleep. I really like your site and to read
about haunted places. Especially if I know something about the place.Thanks<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
am seventeen and my twin brothers were fourteen when the following events
occurred. The mysterious events happened last year (2003), when we were staying
at my grandma’s house for 4 nights as our grandma was sick. Her house is an old
cottage built in the 18th century in rural England. We arrived in late October
and we would have to sleep in the spare room coming off the basement next to a
little room where the drier and the washing machine stood. The basement had an
old, broken boiler that hasn’t worked for decades. In our room there were two
beds, one for me and a king sized bed that my twin brothers slept in. The
basement had stone walls that were always slightly damp. Out in our room and
the washing room the walls were wallpapered several decades ago with plain
yellow wallpaper. Now I will tell you the events that occurred over that week. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
first and second nights went pretty smoothly, the only disturbing thing was we
heard rattling pipes in the ceiling. I asked my grandma in the morning if she
had rats in the basement, she answered that she wasn’t sure as she sometimes
heard sounds down there too. On the third night things started to get weird,
around 10pm we went to get some sleep. I lay awake in my bed for an hour or so,
fore some reason sleep seemed to be evading me. Around 11pm I heard rustling
and soft footsteps outside in the basement. I whispered to my brothers if they
heard anything, but they seemed to not hear me or they were asleep. I stood up
and shook one of my brothers, but they wouldn’t wake up. They seemed to be in
some sort of deep sleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I slowly walked
out into the basement and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I saw
something that I would never forget…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>On
the stone floor of the basement I saw a pool of a red liquid, probably blood,
with a human skull lying in the middle. I heard a noise in the corner and
darted my eves towards the corner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
looked at the floor again and both the blood and the skull had disappeared! I
couldn’t get to sleep for the rest of the night and I repeatedly tried to wake
up my brothers, but they would not wake. I was so terrified I didn’t tell my
grandma but I did tell my twin brothers. They both claimed they had a
mysterious dream where they had been sitting in an empty room in large chairs
where they had been confronted by a cloaked figure who told them that they must
leave the house in the next 24 hours or they would be forced to leave. They
claimed that the figure did not speak but it had sent messages into their mind.
The cloaked figure disappeared in a red flash and they woke up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>On
the fourth and final night, both I and my brothers could not get to sleep.
Around 1pm in the morning, we heard rustling noises coming from the washing
room. We ventured in there slowly, one of my brothers brandishing a tennis
racquet. We entered the room and flicked on the light. The light flickered and
went back out a few seconds later, we stayed in the room for another twenty
seconds or so and then the washing machine just started up even though we
hadn’t turned it on!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
fled the room and the washing machine turned off 5 minutes later. About an hour
we heard maniacal laughter coming from upstairs. I rushed up the stairs holding
the tennis racquet in my left hand and a flashlight in my right. I ran down the
hall and into the kitchen and the taps are running blood!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
ran to the sink and tried to turn the tap off. It turned off but the blood
would not go down the sink. I heard the laughter again behind me and I quickly
turned around. No one was there! I turned back around and the blood had
disappeared. I was so scared I ran back down the stairs and into our room. Me
and my brothers stayed there for the rest of the night and the laughter
continued on and off during the night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
next morning we told our grandma what had happened. She just said we had seen
too many movies and were just imagining stuff.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is the scariest thing that has ever happened to me and I will never
forget this!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
am one of those people who believed in ghosts but sort of dismissed them. well
last year, during christmas eve me and my family were at my aunt and uncle
house. There was my mother, dad, grandpa, grandma, nana, and my cousin who is
11. well we have it down stairs cuz my grandpa is crippled. My grandma had sent
me upstairs to get some pop for her. well the counter is right next to a window
and while pouring the pop, out of the corner of my eye i saw an old man wearing
either a red hat or a red vest (dont really remember) well when i looked over
no one was there. naturally it freaked me out so i hurried downstairs, and left
it alone. After everyone settled down, gifts open etc. we some how got into the
subject of ghosts etc (which is rare for my family, and remember i had said
nothing about the man i saw.) and my grandpa had brought up a story of when my
aunt and cousin had came to the house to get something. (this is before they
moved into the house). well there was no one else in there and my aunt is
facing my cousin and she says mommy who is that man, she was pointing behind
her, my aunt freaked out and left with my cousin. after a while my aunt
questioned her about him and my cousin had described the man that i had saw in
the window, apparently, there was suppose to be an old man who died in the
house (not quite sure of the exact story)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>to this day i refuse walking in that house by myself, or sleep in a room
by myself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I've
been an animal lover all my life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Shortly before I was married, I got a kitten.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The homeliest kitten I had ever seen! I named
him Bailey, and he moved in with me and my parents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After I got married, he moved along with
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Years later, I got divorced, and we
moved again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was always the sweetest
cat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I always said he had such a
wonderful personality, because he knew he was ugly. A few years later, we moved
in with a man, and his three children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This man was not the animal lover that I was, and was always hateful,
and mean to Bailey.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unfortunatly, I
don't think Bailey's last years on earth were very happy ones, but we had our
rituals--he would always lay on my bed while I got ready for work, and would
sit with me and watch television at night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>At
the age of 11, Bailey developed cancer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I couldn't bear to see him suffer, and had him put to sleep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was very upset.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few days afterward, out of the corner of my
eye, I would see Bailey's long tail rush by.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This happened a few times, and I thought I was just imagining
things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the middle child in the
house (also an animal lover) told me that she thought she saw Bailey!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told her I did too. I went outside and sat
on the back stoop.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a small
window there, and whenever I would sit out there, Bailey would sit in the
window and cry for me to come back inside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This day I heard a cat cry from the window.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instictivly, I looked to the window--no one
was there.. I went back inside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few
moments later, I heard the man of the house screaming for me---I went to the
back door and found him standing there, bleeding from a terrible head wound!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I asked him what happened.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said that he was moving a ladder, and a
hammer fell from the top and hit him on the head, but he swore that the hammer
was its holder, and he couldn't understand how it could have fell.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I patched him up, and smiled to myself,
knowing that Bailey had finally gotten even with him!!!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After that day, I never saw Bailey, or felt
his presence again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

grandmother told me this story. She was a devout Christian and would never,
ever lie. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
said she lived in a small house in Tennessee with her mom, dad and 2 siblings.
She, her sister and brother slept in the same bed. One night they heard a man's
voice speak to them. He told them not to be affraid, that he wanted them to
listen to him. They told him to go away and caused a comotion. Hearing this
their dad came in and told them to be quiet. The voice said he wanted them to
help him. They pleaded with him to leave them alone before their dad came in
and paddled them. The voice said he promised to leave them alone if they would
help him. He told them that he was murdered and burried under the house. The
gun was in the cistern out back. They relunctantly told their dad. He didn't believe
them at first until they started to cry and begged him to check the cistern for
the gun. Indeed he found a rusty pistol. Their dad said he would handle it from
there. They don't know if anything ever became of the story or if their dad
even told anyone about it but the voice kept his word and left them alone.
However, I do have several pictures of my grandmother with ghostly shapes. I
didn't really believe the story even though I knew she wouldn't lie until I saw
those pictures. They are in a box of many photos and will look for them and
send them to you along with this story again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
just happened upon your site and thought I would share with you some
experiences I have had starting in 1989 and ending in 1991.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
flew out to Los Angeles with my friend Amber when I was 19 years old.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her grandmother lived in Chatsworth, a part
of the valley.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our first night there we
slept in an empty bedroom on the floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As I layed down Amber told me to keep my feet covered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just as I was about to ask her why a wire
hanger flew across the room and hit me on the bottom of my feet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I asked Amber why she did that and when I
looked at her I knew in an instant she couldn't have.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was right next to me and there was a pile
of hangers on the floor in the opposite corner of the room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She then told me that her grandmother's house
was haunted and the ghosts would grab your feet if you didn't keep them
covered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Needless to say I was freaked
out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
next morning I asked both her grandmother and her great grandmother about the
house being haunted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They both told me
that the neighborhood was built on an old Indian burial ground and that just
about everyone in the neighborhood had a story to tell about being haunted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A
few days had passed and I had gone to a party with Amber and some of our other
friends.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Amber left the party but I
stayed and was driven back to the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was around 3am and I was terrified to go into the house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You could literally feel a presence near
you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When Amber opened the back door it
was like a brick wall hitting me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
almost felt as if there was no air when I stepped in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I quickly went to bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
next night Amber and two of her friends were going to sleep in an old train
tunnel and I didn't want to go so I stayed with both of her grandmother's.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her great grandmother had two twin beds in
her room and offered to let me sleep in there with her that night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They both went to bed and I sat up watching
tv.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After about an hour I heard a tap on
the glass sliding door in the back of the house that proceeded to go around to
the kitchen window and then the front of the house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was slow at first and as it went on it
became faster and faster.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm getting
chills just thinking about it now. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
got up and turned on all the lights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
first turned off the kitchen light, then the living room light and when I got
to the hallway I felt something behind me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As I walked down the hall to the bedroom I heard what sounded like an
animal running behind me yet there were no pets in the house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As soon as I turned off the hallway light I
ran and jumped into the bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I did
the running sound became quicker yet as I covered myself the sound stopped
right at the bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
left for home a couple of days after that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even now I literally have goose bumps from head to toe thinking about
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The experience literally sends
chills up my spine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now
I have an experience from my own home where I grew up and even my husband says
he has heard of &quot;shadow&quot; people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After coming home one night I went upstairs to my bedroom and was
reading of all things, The Exorcist, when I saw something move by my
closet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I turned I saw a black
shadow moving across my room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It looked
like a man wearing a large brimmed hat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As soon as I saw it it was gone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now
the third experience I have is from when I was in the Air Force and was
stationed at Brooks AFB in San Antonio Texas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My roommate had gone out with one of the guys to a set of railroad
tracks that they said were haunted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
decided to go with them when they went back the following weekend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was in the back seat of Barrett's car and
Mysi was in the front with him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we
drove into the neighborhood I noticed all the street names were those of
children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Barrett then told me that the
story was of a bus load of children who were killed when the bus stalled on the
tracks and a train hit them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I then
noticed a row of trees that were on the right side of the street that had grown
away from the street.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It looked like someone
had bent them to the right and they were perfectly aligned with one
another.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then we came to the
tracks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Barrett put his car in neutral
and we waited for a few seconds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of
a sudden it seemed as if everything went silent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the car started to move and we gently
went over the tracks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The story goes
that the children who died will push you over the tracks so you won't be hit by
a train.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Barrett also said that if you
put baby powder on your car when you're done you will find small handprints all
over your car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I'm
sorry for having had to send this twice but I forgot to add a time in the house
where I grew up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were several
times where I would walk down the hall to my bedroom and I would hit a cold
spot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once when I went into my room it
smelled of roses but there were no flowers in the house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several of my friends were afraid to go
upstairs at night because they said my house was haunted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1990 my family moved and a few months
after moving I went back to the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Everything was locked up in the front of the house so I walked around to
the back doors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned the knob once
and it was locked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I then thought to
myself I want to go into my old house and take something from the house to keep
as mine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I tried the door again it opened.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was around 3 in the afternoon and I
didn't really think anything of it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
walked in and remembered that when I was in the fourth grade I had taped a
yellow ribbon on the inside of my closet door so I went upstairs to get
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nothing was on when I walked into
the house or even when I walked into my bedroom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While I was getting the ribbon I heard the
ceiling fan in the guest room next to mine turn on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought to myself that I just didn't notice
that it was on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I started back down
the hallway the water in my old bathroom turned on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that point I just ran out of the house as
fast as I could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>People
who know me, who have known me for years, have always joked that I'm the one
who is haunted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't think I am
haunted but I do feel things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are
times now when I feel like I'm not alone when I walk into a room and I'll get a
little spooked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I still see things at
times but I choose to ignore them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
only time in the recent past that I haven't ignored things was when my
grandmother passed away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was extremely
close to her and when everyone had left her hospice room I stayed with
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I held her hand I felt something
to my right and I think it was her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
mom said that just before she took her last breath she was talking to her
mother.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mom and I both believe that
the two of them were in the room with me as I said my goodbye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
sure hope you don't think of me as a fruit cake for the number of experiences I
have had.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've had a few more but I'd be
here all night typing them in an email.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I am a true believer in ghosts or entities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am also a believer in demonic beings as
well as angels being with us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>My father is a car buff. One night him and
his car club where at a car show. It happened to be Halloween. All his friends
told him about the &quot;Haunted&quot; rail road tracks. He never believed
them, but he will try anything. So six of his closest friends piled into his
Acura, and left for the tracks. I don't know exactly what time, but in Virginia
there was a school bus crossing a track many years ago. It was about 1:00 in
the morning, when the bus got stuck. A train came, and there where no survivors
on the bus of third graders. So the condition was, everyone must stay in the
car. The car must be off, and it must be very near the next train passing. As
an added touch they stopped at Eckard. They parked on the tracks, at a slight
angle. So he put the car in 1st gear, hand brake on. Radio blasting, they all
got out and covered the car an talcum powder. They got in, turned off the car
and waited listening to music. They didn't hear the train coming a few miles
away. The doors locked, the radio died, and the head lights all went out. My
dad heard the train, and went to turn the ignition on. There was no power. The
doors wouldn't open. Locked. They heard laughter. The tires skidded as the car
slid slowly backwards off the track. After the train passed, the radio scared
everyone white, after the silence. The lights came on, the doors unlocked, and
scariest of all, he swears on his life the car started itself. It was no longer
in first gear, but the brake was on. They got out, and there where tiny hand
prints all over the car. And he did not once grin while telling me this. He
swears the uth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

thrilled to find your site, because I've not found anyone else to talk to about
my experiences, except my family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
latest was a brush with a ?ghost? at my church, while I was there alone
practicing music up in the choir loft.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
was at the piano bench, alone, and I felt someone, or something, brush behind
me, as if they were passing behind my chair...only no one was there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked to my right...the direction the
thing would have been going...and I got the biggest case of goosebumps ever,
and the shivers....it sounded a little like swishing robes, and it had a smell
too...like incense...so I'm assuming the local priest came for a visit?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently, according to my husband, a
lifelong member of the church, theres a rumor about the membership that the
original priest hasn't given up taking care of his church.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Oddly I didn't feel scared or threatened at
the time, just another haunting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Unfortunately,
I've experienced these types of things a lot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Sure is reassuring to learn I'm not alone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thanks for your site...never have spoken
about these things outside of my immediate family circle for fear of ending up
housed in a rubber room with white clothed attendants.<span

is a true story that happened to me just recently. Okay it all started one
night when I just got home from my old house in col </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>. When I really had to
go to the bathroom and my sister and my foster-mom was down stairs talking and
cooking dinner. I went upstairs and noticed that my door was open when I shut
the door before I left to go to school that exact morning and when I went to
get something that I needed for the bathroom and if your a woman you will
understand what I'm talking about anyways then I went to my dresser to get a
pair of pajamas and as I was walking out of my room when I was shutting the
door behind and turning off the light I heard something on my roof so I went to
the window that's straight across ed from my door and as I looked out my window
I saw a little boys figure figure standing there right in front of me and he
looked like he was trying to say &quot;Hi&quot; and then he said something else
but I couldn't read his lips that time so then i ran in to the bathroom and
went pee and changed into my pajamas really quickly and as soon as I was
leaving the bathroom and I was shutting the light off I glanced back and as I
did<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>saw my bathroom window opening and
then I blinked and the next thing I knew he was climbing into my bathroom so I
slammed the door shut and ran down stairs and I told my sister and my
foster-mom and they didn't believe me until the next morning they both where
going to go to the bathroom to change and go pee and as they were they both saw
somebody shutting the bathroom door and they knew it wasn't me because I was
still in bed sleeping so they screamed and woke me up and told me what happened
I tried to go into the bathroom and the door was locked so we waited for a
couple of minute's and then all of a sudden the little boy came out of the
bathroom and we all saw him at the same time so from hen on they believed me . <o:p></o:p></span></p>

there my name is Jaclyn . I grew up in my grandmothers house in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> for 20 years until I
moved out with my husband after we got married. This house has always had weird
things going on in it. My grandmother moved in after her and my grandfather got
married. My Great Great Grandparents gave the house to them. To my knowledge
and what I have been told by my family that the house has been lived in by my
ancestors for about 100 years but they could be exaggerating. Well, to start my
story off when my grandparents first moved into the house they started
remodeling the house and they found a grave stone under the kitchen floor. They
are not sure if it is a relative or not I have tried to do research on it but I
always hit a dead end. They are not sure if someone just placed it there because
it broke in the cemetery or if the house is built on a graveyard. At night time
when you are sleeping you can always hear footsteps walking around in the
middle of the night. When you locked the windows and doors at night you would
wake up the next morning and find that someone has unlocked them. Lights come
on and off by themselves and radios do to. I can tell you one experience I had
when I stayed there one night while I was pregnant with my son. I had went to
sleep and I started dreaming well at the time I was having complications with
him and I dreamed there was a little girl laying next to me in the bed and she
just kept smiling at me and all of a sudden she said everything will be OK and
she drew her legs back and kicked me off the bed. You know how you get the
feeling of falling in your sleep wile I got that feeling and just as I woke up
the radio turned on out of the blue all by itself. It scared me half to death
and I couldn't get back to sleep that night. There many other stories I could
tell you about the house but maybe I will write about them some other time
because all that I know about the house could fill up seven pages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
