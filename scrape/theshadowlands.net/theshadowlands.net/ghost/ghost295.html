<p><b>A Few Experiences</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: ynhpunkass925@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>Hey I'm Jenny, I'm 14, and getting ready to become a highschool freshman</b>
<br><b>next year.&nbsp; Anyway, here are a few experiences that my family
and I had that</b>
<br><b>seemed very strange.</b>
<br><b>Just yesterday (April 21, 2004), my friends and I were goofing off
in front</b>
<br><b>of our teacher's room because we were waiting to go inside of his
classroom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I bent down to try to kick my friend playfully when his hand
grabbed my</b>
<br><b>clip from my hair and it knocked a fire extinguisher on my head.&nbsp;
It left a</b>
<br><b>huge bump and it still hurts a lot, mind you.&nbsp; Anyway when
I came home from</b>
<br><b>school, my mother told me that around 2:30 (the same time when the</b>
<br><b>extinguisher fell on me) one of our wine glasses fell down and shattered.</b>
<br><b>She was outside with my dog at that time and a few minutes later,
my dad</b>
<br><b>called her and told her about the thing falling on me.&nbsp; Strange,
eh?</b>
<br><b>My grandmother passed away about a month and a half ago, and alot
of weird</b>
<br><b>things have been happening around my house.&nbsp; This one time
I just came out</b>
<br><b>of my shower and I saw someone walking around my mom's&nbsp; room.&nbsp;
When I turned</b>
<br><b>around to look again, it was gone.&nbsp; Another time I was listening
to some</b>
<br><b>Mest in my room and I heard by sister's bedsprings squeak.&nbsp;
I was alone in</b>
<br><b>my room that time and the bed just shifted down.&nbsp; My sister
also told me a</b>
<br><b>few times that she saw our grandmother walk around in our mom's
room wearing</b>
<br><b>a red outfit and strangely enough before my grandmother was cremated,
she</b>
<br><b>was wearing a red outfit as well.&nbsp; Also in one of the pictures
we have of</b>
<br><b>her funeral, there was some kind of weird orb in front of her casket.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>will try to send in the picture when my scanner is working.</b>
<br><b>One more experience was actually by my mom.&nbsp; It was about two
years ago and</b>
<br><b>around 3:30 in the morning.&nbsp; Everyone was sleeping and my mom
woke up</b>
<br><b>because she was a bit thirsty when she heard a little girl crying
outside of</b>
<br><b>her room, right on top of our stairs.&nbsp; She thought it was me
crying (I have</b>
<br><b>knee problems so sometimes I wake up crying in the middle of the
night..THE</b>
<br><b>PAIN) so she came out of her room to check on my siste and I.&nbsp;
When she came</b>
<br><b>out of her room though, the crying suddenly stopped.&nbsp; She went
back into her</b>
<br><b>room and saw some shadow moving across the floor and heard the crying
again</b>
<br><b>and strangely (being my mother) she just fell back asleep.&nbsp;
These are all</b>
<br><b>real accounts in my house.</b>

<p><b>Cookies</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: atsernaseiu@msn.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>This is something my dad told me.</b>
<br><b>When I was about 8 years old, my parents used to drink a lot of
water before bed. So one night,late, my dad went to the kitchen to get
some water. The lights were off. Through the windows the moon was shining
though. He saw a little girl, with long hair, and in a night gown hunched
over the island eating a cookie. Then she looked over at my dad. He stood
there for along time because he thought it was me, and he thought it was
funny. He thought I was sleep walking. So he turned on the light and said,"
What are you doing?" because he thought is was me. But when he looked around,but
no one was there. So he turned off the light to see if what he was looking
at was a refection off the coffee pot or something. Now I'm 11 and I can
still feel a presence in our house.</b>

<p><b>Some Strange Things</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By:sislers@bellsouth.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p><p><b>I have had several strange things happen in my life. I have always
had the ability to pick up on things that are not always seen. The first
was that I was riding my bike at age 7. I was riding in the middle of the
street, and looking back at friends. All of a sudden I saw a white flash,
and saw 2 people in long white gowns. Then the flash was gone. I hit my
brakes and looked back and there was a car (seemed if it had passed right
thru me). I went home and told my mom and described the people that I had
seen and was extremely upset. She told me that she had also seen them before
in our house. I know that sounds weird, but I will never forget the way
the people looked.When I was 20, I was at work. I was working at my desk
and answering the phones. All of a sudden I smelled old spice and my grandfather
was standing in front of me. He stood there for about 10 secounds, then
he was gone, and I thought that was weird. About 3 minutes later I answered
a phone call. It was my mom; she said I have some bad new. I asked if my
grandfather had passed away. She asked how did you know that. I told her
he had just been at my work only minutes before. That was back in 1990.
Another strange event was the passing of my dad. He had cancer and had
always said to me that he didn&#8217;t want my 3 younger sisters to be in the
room when he died. He was staying at my grandmother&#8217;s house and had hospice.
My sisters and I lived in Maryland and my grandmother&#8217;s house was in West
Virigina. My grandmother called and said he was doing very poorly and that
we all should all come. We took the 6 hr trip and stayed with another family
member about 10 minutes from my grandmothers. We spent the 3 days with
my dad (he was in a coma at this time) and went to my aunts at night. Well
on the day of Sept. 28 1997, we were done visiting my dad for the day and
we were leaving. I said in the room where my dad was laying that we would
be back in the morning at 9am. That night he came to me in a dream and
told me it was his time to go and not to come until after 9am. We arrived
at 9:15 and he had passed away at 8:59. Also while he was in a coma, his
eyes were open and he was looking at three different spots on the ceiling
and moving his mouth as if he were talking. He had a pleasant look when
he looked to his left and was lifting his had as if holding someone's hand.
When he looked to the center he had a concerend look, and when he looked
to the right he had a scared look. Also once when he looked the right he
called out my great grandmothers name and reached out his hand. His grand
mother had been rasied my father for years when he was a child. She had
died about 15 years before my dad. She was a very religious person. Another
weird thing happened latter that same year in November 1997.&nbsp; My wifes
sister and brother-in-law were murdered. We went to be with her family
and get ready for the funerals. The&nbsp; police had not found the murders
yet. My wife and I decided to take a shower after the long trip from Maryland
to Pa. While in the shower (shower had glass doors) my wife and I stood
in shock. The glass for the shower had fogged up and we saw a name being
written in the glass (its like you steamed a window and wrote with your
finge)r. DAV had been written&nbsp; and me and my wife jumped out in horror
before it was done. It really scared the hell out of us. I didn&#8217;t even&nbsp;
rinse the soap off my body. It was found out 2 days later the murders name
was David.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Man</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: galamb@webhart.net</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>hello everyone. well here is my experience. I was just 9 years old
and my</b>
<br><b>mom and a whole gang of people wanted to go to this place where
they said</b>
<br><b>that this girl died in the woods and her father went to look for
her and</b>
<br><b>died and from this day you can see him walking on a dirt road with
a lantern</b>
<br><b>in his hand, so we went to this place in the woods and we waited
on a hill</b>
<br><b>and after a few minutes i could see a ghostly figure of a man with
a latern</b>
<br><b>walking toward our car. he kept walking and walking until he reached
the</b>
<br><b>car. he went over to my window and looked into it to see if his
daughter was</b>
<br><b>in there.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The First Step</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: reannon@teenmag.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I am 17 years old, and a considerable skeptic.&nbsp; Well, i was
until i turned 13.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My birthday went off without a hitch, and we decided to go
to my cousin's</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; I didnt want to go home, so i was allowed to spend
the night.&nbsp; Me and</b>
<br><b>my oldest two cousins, Russ, and Stephanie went up to the barn fort
to sleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It was awfully cold because it was the middle of february
so we had alot of</b>
<br><b>blankets.&nbsp; we settled down to sleep around midnight.&nbsp;
Now, i had never seen</b>
<br><b>anything paranormal on my cousins property before, but around 4:oo
am i awoke</b>
<br><b>freezing.&nbsp; I was disoriented and confused because i&nbsp; was
bundled with Steph in</b>
<br><b>about ten blankets.&nbsp; I sat up and there was a tall girl standing
in the</b>
<br><b>rafters next to me.&nbsp; i was to stunned to talk. she took a step
towards me and</b>
<br><b>i realized she wasnt standing in the rafters, she was floating over
them.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>looked straight into my eyes and said something I'll never forget.
She said</b>
<br><b>"The first step is the hardest, but you will be able to get through
this." The</b>
<br><b>girl than reached towards me and finally&nbsp; i screamed.&nbsp;
Russ and Steph awoke,</b>
<br><b>and Stephanie gasped.&nbsp; I think she may have seen her too.&nbsp;
Russ turned on the</b>
<br><b>light and the girl dissapeared.&nbsp; I've been to my cousins and
slept in the fort</b>
<br><b>many times since then, but i have never seen the girl since.&nbsp;
We could find no</b>
<br><b>evidence of death on the property books either.&nbsp; Stephanie
still won't talk</b>
<br><b>about that night.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Office</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: abyins@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>ok here goes my story.&nbsp; we recently purchased an insurance agency
last august.&nbsp; we had to move the office in january due to the building
we were occupying being taken by the county to use as a public defenders
office.&nbsp; we found a house that had been turned into commercial property.&nbsp;
we were really excited to have all this space since our old office had
only two rooms and a restroom that was shared with another tennant.&nbsp;
(this is a 2 bedroom house)&nbsp; we have been there for about 4months
now and we have had several strange things to go on.&nbsp;&nbsp; (we were
told by the neighbor about who previously owned the house) we will come
in and a small file cabinet at the end of the secretary's desk has been
pushed back about a foot and a half.&nbsp; we had a package of tea light
candles completely disappear and have never been able to find them.&nbsp;
our desk that the typewriter sits on will be pulled out at an angle on
one end.&nbsp; the refrigerator will be pulled out from the wall, and when
we go to get a file it will be at the end of the letter in which it should
be filed( example Bailey will be the last file in the B's).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The bathroom door will be open even though we have just closed it.&nbsp;
when we go into the back office (which was her bedroom when she was alive)
we usually find the light on.&nbsp; We always laughed it off until last
friday when a new client came in to purchase insurance and she had her
son with her . the son is probably 17 or so and he has down syndrome.&nbsp;
he kept talking to someone and then he would stop and listen then give
a response back.&nbsp; we were telling his mother that we know there's
a ghost here and she stated that he sees things like that.&nbsp; she preceeded
to ask her son questions about who he was talking to and he said he was
talking with a ghost.&nbsp; to make a long story short he knew everything
that had been going on in the office. he told us that she had just opened
the bathroom door(which we knew was closed) when we looked the door was
open.&nbsp; He told the secretary that she was watching her and her baby,
the secretary is pregnant.&nbsp; He told us she is a nice ghost and will
not harm us.&nbsp; we know that an elderly lady owned the house and when
she died she left it to a niece who was on drugs and sold it.&nbsp; The
lady never wanted the house to be sold. the 17 year old even knew that
she was related to the people next door.&nbsp; they were the ones who told
us who originally owned the house.&nbsp; so far Celeste (that was the lady's
name) has not tried to hurt anyone and she does not seem to be an angry
spirit.&nbsp; i guess she just never could part with her house because
she loved it there.&nbsp; i did tell her a few days ago to please stop
opening the bathroom door and so far when we close it, it stays closed.&nbsp;
i guess she listened.&nbsp; we told her she is welcome to stay as long
as she wants as long as we don't see her, and she doesn't try to hurt us.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Is He Here?</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: jo_jo3448@yahoo.ca</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>Hi my name is Michelle and I'm 17 and I have a</b>
<br><b>question for you 9 years ago my dear grandfather died</b>
<br><b>and now I want to know if he is still with me here's</b>
<br><b>what makes me think he may be. I just moved into my</b>
<br><b>apartment in October of last year previous to that I</b>
<br><b>lived with my parents. Through out the nine years my</b>
<br><b>sister has seen my grandfather several times and I</b>
<br><b>believe I have had some encounters as well but it has</b>
<br><b>gotten really serious since I moved.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Here's the facts:</b>
<br><b>I have felt someone sitting beside me at times when I</b>
<br><b>have been sick or upset I feel his presence at these</b>
<br><b>times their is a spot in our kitchen that creaks when</b>
<br><b>you step on it and I have heard this when their is no</b>
<br><b>one else in the room and both the cats are in the</b>
<br><b>living room i have also heard loud bangs in the</b>
<br><b>kicthen at night but when I say hi Grandpa it stops</b>
<br><b>imediately I have seen the rocking chair in our</b>
<br><b>bedroom rock when no one was in it me and my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>were both in bed and the one cat is on the bed the</b>
<br><b>other one will not come up stairs unless she is</b>
<br><b>carried or chased by the kitten even then she will</b>
<br><b>stop at the landing unless carried. My boyfriend will</b>
<br><b>get cold chills and so will I and at times I think I</b>
<br><b>hear someone talking to me when I ask my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>Adam what he said he says nothing. I also think but</b>
<br><b>cant be sure that I saw my grandfather in the mirror</b>
<br><b>once as i walked passed it but when i took a second</b>
<br><b>look at it there was nothing there at this time i was</b>
<br><b>alone. I also have several pictures of family and my</b>

<p><b>I Asked it to Stop</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: geckogirl@adelphia.net</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I have experienced strange thing ever since my grandfather died.
The first</b>
<br><b>experiences I ever encountered involved him. I would go to visit
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother and as soon as we would mention him, I would hear him
laugh. My</b>
<br><b>scariest experience didn't involve my grandfather. They involved
three</b>
<br><b>spirits in my own home. One night when I was 13. I was laying in
bed when I</b>
<br><b>heard scratching at my door. This was very odd because my family
always</b>
<br><b>locks our pets in the basement before we go to sleep. Then, I heard
my door</b>
<br><b>creak and footsteps walking across my room. Someone was standing
next to me</b>
<br><b>breathing on me. They jump onto my bed and grabbed my arm. While
I didn't</b>
<br><b>see the person, I feel certain that it was child (I also know that
it had to</b>
<br><b>be a ghost because I'm the youngest in my family). My first instinct
usually</b>
<br><b>would have been to scream for my parents, but for some reason I
told they</b>
<br><b>spirit that it was frightening me. Slowly, it got up and left the
room.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Hauntings</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: Izabell162@aol.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>hey. i wrote my rather boring stories about the man i used 2 see
when i was smaller. in ma old room, when i was trying to sleep, as soon
as</b>
<br><b>the light was off and i was in bed, i would suddenly get this feeling
of utter terror,</b>
<br><b>i got the feeling that can only be explained as the feeling of wrongness.
the feeling that</b>
<br><b>something very very, well, not evil but something that i felt would
harm me if it knew i</b>
<br><b>was awake. i dont know what it was. i would lie still for hours,
not able to summon up</b>
<br><b>the courage to turn on the light untill in the wee hours of the
morning it would pass and</b>
<br><b>i would fall asleep. it was more a feeling of great sadness and
pain than evil. and was</b>
<br><b>almost always accompanied by the smell of death and sadness (its
all i can explain it as.</b>
<br><b>and it was quite faint)</b>
<br><b>this would start about 11 pm and end about 2 in the morning. during
this time, the cats</b>
<br><b>would refuse to enter my room. and if they were in it, they would
hide under my blankets</b>
<br><b>willingly&nbsp; (which was usually a BIG no no for them.)</b>
<br><b>also.&nbsp; i would see the small figure of a man about 2 feet tall
passing from my door,</b>
<br><b>past my bed and to the foot of my bed and disapear. this would happen
every night at the</b>
<br><b>same time and the same thing every time. my room was also ALWAYS
freezing. even in the</b>
<br><b>summer (not much proof as this IS scotland after all:p) one morning
i woke up and my lip</b>
<br><b>were blue and my skin was almost grey, it was that freezing.</b>
<br><b>being about age from 7-13 this went on every night for all those
years (apart from when</b>
<br><b>i was not sleeping in ma room, eg:holiday, sleepovers)</b>
<br><b>a few months ago i moved rooms and not once sinse then have I had
any problems.</b>
<br><b>but i still feel uneasy going in the room between 11 and 2 (if i
get up to wander about</b>
<br><b>and stuff. or to get something from there.)&nbsp; and even when
its only just dark i have to</b>
<br><b>put my hand in and turn the light on before ill go in cuz i get
the feeling that the 2</b>
<br><b>foot man is it there.............</b>
<br><b>if you got this far. thank you for reading. cya later.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Something Else Out There</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Blink4ever2007@aol.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I am currently a student at Tucson High School, and have experienced
a weird thing that I cant explain.</b>
<br><b>It is said the 3rd floor of our Vocalization building is haunted,
and I firmly believe it.</b>
<br><b>I was walking to the restroom, and coming back to my classroom,
when I heard a strange voice. It was saying something,and gradually started
getting louder,and it didnt sound happy.Afraid of what it was ran back
to my classroom. NOW let me say, my class is the only class on the 3rd
floor of the V-building that period, and also, that the voice came from
behind locked doors where the school is remodeling. It could either have
been, (which I all seriously doubt, because it was a young mans voice,
15-18) a teacher or administrator walking around that part of the building,
(which they never are) and a student that so cleverly found a way in to
ditch (which I doubt because it is securely locked up,) and the other explanation
that I believe is that it was the ghost of the young man that killed himself
a few years ago.</b>
<br><b>I am not the only one with weird experience, as other students get
eerie feelings too walking to the bathrooms. My teacher that teaches on
that floor as well gets eerie feelings and things happen to her she can't
explain.She always talks about how sometimes her room, when by herself,
gets a depressed feeling all around her, like something bad happened. She
also said things go misplaced quite often (which could just be her! ;)</b>
<br><b>Thats my story and I swear its true, and I sure do think that there
is something else out there.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Real Story</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: TandJKille@aol.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I'm not sure if I'm telling this right, but here goes. When my Husband
was about 11 yrs. old his stepmother moved in with him and his father.
I'm not sure all that happened because he has never told anyone what really
actually happened to him. All I know is what his parents witnessed and
what happened to them. Anyway, He was sleeping in his bed one night when
his bed started rising up into the air and shaking violently. Before this
in a different house he remembers a floating face appearing to him and
his grandmother. All he says is he thinks it was the devil. What ever it
was, if you mention it to him he almost passes out. His parents now live
in a new house in a new city and have had plenty of unexplained things
happen. What I'd like to know is what is this, and now that we live next
door to them will it find my husband again? It always seems to protect
my mother in law, and attract my husband. Now we're being told we may live
on an old church site between the two properties and there was a cemetery.
If you'd like to know more please let me know I'll see what I can dig up.
Thank you for listening to me go on and on. I'm not a good story teller.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Rowdy Spirits</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: amber_axon@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I have been living in my house for about six years now. It previously</b>
<br><b>belonged to my grandparents, and my grandmother died in this house.
I really</b>
<br><b>don't think she's the one behind any of this.</b>
<br><b>The first experience I've ever had in this house happened late at
night</b>
<br><b>about 3 years ago. By this time we had added a second story to the
house and</b>
<br><b>turned my parents old room into an office where we keep the computer.
I was</b>
<br><b>up later talking to friends on the internet when I noticed, out
of the</b>
<br><b>corner of my eye, that my cat was standing, fully alert, with all
her fur</b>
<br><b>up. She started to growl and then it felt like something grabbed
the back of</b>
<br><b>my chair and shook it very hard. That was enough for me. I didn't
even</b>
<br><b>bother to sign off or shut down the computer, I just bolted up the
stairs.</b>
<br><b>The second event happend just a few weeks later. My sister and I
(along with</b>
<br><b>our two dogs and three cats) were in my room upstairs watching a
movie. Both</b>
<br><b>our parents were asleep and my door was shut. The five pets all
got up at</b>
<br><b>the same time and stood about three feet away from my door. All
of their fur</b>
<br><b>went up, and they started growling and hissing, respectively. My
sister and</b>
<br><b>I didn't think much of it until we heard what sounded like footsteps
on the</b>
<br><b>stairs. Thinking it was one of our parents, my sister called out
to them but</b>
<br><b>got no response. The footsteps continued going up and down the stairs.
It</b>
<br><b>was like whatever it was would walk to the top of the stairs (just
outside</b>
<br><b>my bedroom door) and then turn around and go back down. The footsteps
got</b>
<br><b>faster until it sounded like the "thing" was running up and down.
You could</b>
<br><b>hear the "thing" falling and giggling. This went on for about 10
minutes.</b>
<br><b>After it stopped my sister ran down the hall and woke my parents
up. She</b>
<br><b>asked them if they heard it, and they hadn't, even though their
bedroom door</b>
<br><b>was open.</b>
<br><b>I have always had an uneasy feeling about being downstairs at night
by</b>
<br><b>myself. I don't spend a lot of time down there when no one else
is down</b>
<br><b>there with me. Doors will shut by themselves even though there is
no breeze</b>
<br><b>or open window. The downstairs doors are heavy and take a lot of
tugging to</b>
<br><b>get them fully shut. Just a month ago, while laying in bed, just
falling</b>
<br><b>asleep, my bedroom door slammed, causing me to be wide awake. My
bedroom</b>
<br><b>door sticks, and it's not possible for anyone to slam it. My youngest
cat,</b>
<br><b>Darlin', was sleeping at the foot of my bed. I didn't look up when
the door</b>
<br><b>slammed, tihnking it might have just been my tired mind. But I was
fully</b>
<br><b>awake when I heard a woman's voice say "Hi kitty, how are you."
This upset</b>
<br><b>my cat, she meowed pitifully. Thinking it was my mom, I looked up
to see why</b>
<br><b>she was still awake (this was about 2am), but no one was there.
And I know</b>
<br><b>the door didn't open and shut again.</b>
<br><b>After telling my parents about the two experiences, they didn't
seem shocked</b>
<br><b>at all to hear it. My dad then told me that once, when visiting
my</b>
<br><b>grandparents he and my mother stayed in the back bedroom (now the
office).</b>
<br><b>One night, for two hours, he laid in bed and watched a woman, dressed
all in</b>
<br><b>white walk back and forth from the living room to the dinning room.
To do</b>
<br><b>this, she would have had to pass the attic stairs, which are now
the stairs</b>
<br><b>leading to the upstairs bedrooms.</b>
<br><b>My mother then told me that after my grandmother died, my grandfather
often</b>
<br><b>told my mom about seeing my grandmother standing at the foot of
his bed.</b>
<br><b>A year ago we ripped up the old flooring in the downstairs hallway
and</b>
<br><b>dinning room. At the foot of the stairs going up, a sealed trap
door was</b>
<br><b>found. And just two weeks ago, while digging a trench for the pool's</b>
<br><b>electrical wire, my father found an old rusted chain and pieces
of what</b>
<br><b>appeared to be bones. They were too big to be that of any animal.</b>

<p><b>Update on Ghostly locations</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: icemanyurt@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I attended Young Harris College between the years 2001 and 2003.&nbsp;
As a theatre major there I was expected to spend lots of time in the theatre,
atleast 3-4 hours a day during the working week.&nbsp; I generally enjoyed
my time in Clegg theatre, Charlie was there.&nbsp; He was very playful
and always lent me a listening ear.</b>
<br><b>I really didn't enjoy spending time in Dobbs (or Black Box as it
is known on campus).&nbsp; I don't think I know of one person who did.&nbsp;
It was a rather sketchy place with not so great vibes.&nbsp; While Jesse
was there, I believe in the past students may have entered this theatre
and attempted summonings or other ocultish practices, making more of a
magnet for other spirts.</b>
<br><b>New Dorm:&nbsp; To my knowledge a student never committed suicided
by hanging anywhere on those grounds.&nbsp; The Poet Laureate of Georgia,
Byron Herbert Reece committed suicided by blasting hole in his TB infected
lung.&nbsp; It is interesting to note the Charlie and Mr. Reece were very
close friends, and in a letter found at the scene of Mr Reece death for
Charlie.&nbsp; Charlie entered the room and removed an objected.&nbsp;
No body knew what he took or why.&nbsp; Granted I never had&nbsp; anything
as hardcore as what is on your site happening to me, but some of my buddies
experienced it.</b>
<br><b>Appleby West:&nbsp; A girl committed suicided here due to extreme
teasing by other girls.&nbsp; I know very little about her, but you do
get weird vibes in the basement, especially is the phone booths (like&nbsp;
extreme feeling of hopelessness).</b>
<br><b>Student Center:&nbsp; They claim that it is hunted, but I never
experienced a thing there.&nbsp; I spent lots of time playing pool or throwing
darts (or wondering in while drunk) but nothing ever happened here.</b>
<br><b>Cupid Falls:&nbsp; A site on campus where occult practices were
thought to take place.&nbsp; A buddy and me were walking out there one
night and we both got the 'run like hell feeling,'&nbsp; Just to put this
in context: this was my climbing and backpacking partner I was with.&nbsp;
Spending time alone with someone on the trail or working rocks with them
gives you more of attunement to that person's feelings and attitudes, but
you also know that that person has your back in every situation which gives
you confidence to do various things that you wouldn't be able to do&nbsp;
while alone.&nbsp; Also we are also pretty big guys who have stood our
ground in many circumstances, but this night neither of us could walk within
about an 1/8th of mile to that location.</b><b></b>

<p><b>True Haunted House</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: mab1979@msn.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE OF GROWING UP IN A HAUNTED HOUSE.&nbsp;
MY BROTHER AND I BOTH BELIEVE THAT THAT THE HOUSE WAS HAUNTED.&nbsp; MY
DAD KNOWS SOMETHING WAS STRANGE, BUT WOULD NEVER ADMIT THE POSSIBILITY
OF IT BEING HAUNTED.&nbsp; HERE IS MY STORY.......</b>
<br><b>THE HOUSE WAS A SMALL ONE STORY, 2 BEDROOM HOUSE BUILT IN THE 1940'S.&nbsp;
MY PARENTS BOUGHT IT IN 1985, THEIR FIRST HOUSE.&nbsp; NOTHING REALLY STRANGE
HAPPENED UNTIL YEARS AFTER WE MOVED IN.&nbsp; MY BROTHER HAD AN EXPERIENCE
FIRST.&nbsp; ONE NIGHT HE WAS IN THE BATHROOM AND HE LEFT THE LIGHT OFF
AND THE DOOR OPENED WITH ONLY THE HALL LIGHT ON.&nbsp; WHILE HE WAS STANDING
THERE HE SAW A SHADOW ON THE SHOWER CURTAIN AND ASSUMING IT WAS HIS HE
STARTED TO MOVE AROUND, JUST PLAYING, BUT THE SHADOW DID NOT MOVE WITH
HIM.&nbsp; HE RAN OUT OF THE BATHROOM SCREAMING.&nbsp; MY PARENTS JUST
THOUGHT IT WAS HIS IMAGINATION AND JUST DISMISSED IT.&nbsp; TO THIS DAY
HE WOULD TELL YOU WHAT HE SAW WAS REAL AND NOT HIS IMAGINATION.&nbsp; HE
ALSO HEARD FOOTSTEPS INSIDE THE HOUSE ONE DAY.&nbsp; MY DAD AND I WERE
OUT IN THE BACK YARD AND MY MOM WAS AT WORK.&nbsp; HE WAS INSIDE THE HOUSE
CHANGING HIS CLOTHES FROM SWIMMING EARLIER.&nbsp; HE CAME OUTSIDE SAYING
HE HEARD SOMEONE WALKING AROUND INSIDE THE HOUSE.&nbsp; MY DAD WENT INSIDE
TO CHECK IT OUT, BUT SAW NOTHING.</b>
<br><b>MY FIRST EXPERIENCE HAPPENED WHEN I WAS ABOUT 14.&nbsp; I WAS LYING
IN BED TRYING TO SLEEP WHEN I HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE SOMEONE WAS WALKING
UP ABOVE ME.&nbsp; THERE WAS NO FLOOR IN THE ATTIC TO WALK ON.&nbsp; THE
FOOTSTEPS MOVED ACROSS THE ROOM BACK AND FORTH AND THEN SOUNDED LIKE IT
WAS WALKING DOWN THE WALL.&nbsp; THEN I STARTED TO HEAR SCRATCHING NOISES&nbsp;
COMING FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.&nbsp; I WAS SO SCARED, BUT I DID NOT
DARE WAKE MY PARENTS KNOWING THAT THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME.&nbsp; I TURNED
ON THE LIGHT, PRAYED FOR IT TO STOP AND FINALLY CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP.</b>
<br><b>NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED FOR ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THAT.&nbsp; MOST
OF THE STRANGE EVENTS STARTED HAPPENING WHEN THE ATTIC WAS BEING CONVERTED
TO A BEDROOM.&nbsp; MY BROTHER WOKE ME UP ONE MORNING SAYING HE HEARD WHAT
SOUNDED LIKE SOMEONE PLAYING WITH A TAPE MEASURE IN THE ATTIC.&nbsp; WE
WERE HOME ALONE WHILE MY PARENTS WERE OUT RUNNING AROUND.&nbsp; THERE WERE
NO STAIRS BUILT YET FOR THE ATTIC, ONLY THE PULL DOWN LADDER THAT MOST
PEOPLE HAVE.&nbsp; WE TOLD OUR PARENTS ABOUT IT WHEN THEY GOT HOME SO MY
DAD WENT TO LOOK AND THERE WAS A TAPE MEASURE UP THERE WITH THE REST OF
HIS TOOLS.&nbsp; THE ROOM WAS FINALLY COMPLETED AND IT BECAME MY ROOM.</b>
<br><b>ON MANY OCCASIONS MY TV WOULD COME ON BY ITSELF, USUALLY AROUND
THE SAME TIME EVERY MORNING, AROUND 5 OR 6.&nbsp; THE FIRST MORNING IT
WOKE ME UP I GOT REALLY SCARED.&nbsp; I RAN DOWNSTAIRS AS FAST AS I COULD.&nbsp;
MY DAD WAS ALREADY UP GETTING READY FOR WORK WHEN HE HEARD ME RUNNING ACROSS
THE ROOM.&nbsp; I TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED AND HE TOLD ME TO CHECK THE TIMER
ON THE TV.&nbsp; I DID THAT, BUT IT WAS NOT SET.&nbsp; I EVEN TOOK THE
BATTERIES OUT OF THE REMOTE IN CASE IT WAS MY CAT STEPPING ON THE REMOTE,
BUT IT WASN'T THAT EITHER.&nbsp; I STARTED TO GET USE TO THE TV COMING
ON AND IT DID NOT SCARE ME ANYMORE.&nbsp; IT BEGAN TO HAPPEN EVERY MORNING
AND WAS INTERRUPTING MY SLEEP.&nbsp; I FINALLY SAID OUT LOUD ONE NIGHT
BEFORE BED, "WHATEVER IS CAUSING THE TV TO COME ON, PLEASE STOP. IT IS
INTERRUPTING MY SLEEP AND I HAVE SCHOOL IN THE MORNINGS, PLEASE STOP."&nbsp;
SURPRISINGLY IT STOPPED, AT NIGHT AT LEAST.&nbsp; I WOULD COME HOME FROM
SCHOOL AND FIND THE TV ON.&nbsp; MY BROTHER AND I WERE AT SCHOOL AT THE
SAME TIME AND BOTH MY PARENTS WORKED DURING THE DAY SO I KNOW THAT IT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ANY OF THEM. I ALSO HAD A CORDLESS PHONE I WOULD USE FREQUENTLY.&nbsp;
IT WOULD ACT UP IF I WAS SPEAKING TO A BOYFRIEND, BUT WOULD BE FINE WHEN
I WAS SPEAKING TO MY FRIENDS OR FAMILY.</b>
<br><b>ONE NIGHT WHILE I WAS AT A FRIENDS HOUSE, MY BROTHER HEARD WHAT
SOUNDED LIKE SOMEONE BOUNCING A TENNIS BALL IN MY ROOM.&nbsp; HIS ROOM
WAS DIRECTLY BELOW MINE.&nbsp; ANOTHER NIGHT MY DAD HEARD A LOUD BANG NOISE
IN MY ROOM LIKE SOMETHING HEAVY HAD FALLEN.&nbsp; HE CAME TO THE ROOM AND
WOKE ME UP ASKING IF I WAS OKAY.&nbsp; I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING.&nbsp; I
TOLD HIM THAT MAYBE THE CAT KNOCKED SOMETHING OFF.&nbsp; THE NEXT MORNING
I LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SHE HAD KNOCKED OFF AND NOTHING WAS OUT OF PLACE.&nbsp;
ONE DAY WHILE I WAS HOME BY MYSELF DOWNSTAIRS WATCHING TV, I HEARD A LOUD
NOISE JUST LIKE THE ONE MY DAD HEARD.&nbsp; IT WAS VERY LOUD LIKE SOMETHING
FELL.&nbsp; I WENT UPSTAIRS TO CHECK IT OUT AND OF COURSE SAW NOTHING OUT
OF THE ORDINARY.&nbsp; THERE WAS ONE NIGHT I WAS LYING IN BED TRYING TO
GO TO SLEEP, BUT I JUST COULDN'T GET COMFORTABLE.&nbsp; I HEARD NOISES
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE DOGS DOWN THERE
MESSING AROUND.&nbsp; THEN I HEARD SCRATCHING NOISES ON THE WOOD OF THE
STAIRS.&nbsp; MY CAT LIKES TO SCRATCH AT THE WOOD, BUT SHE WAS IN BED WITH
ME THAT NIGHT.&nbsp; I GOT UP AND WALKED&nbsp; TO THE STAIRS, BUT SAW NOTHING.&nbsp;
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT.&nbsp; THERE WAS ONE DAY THAT MY BROTHER
WAS COOKING DINNER IN THE KITCHEN.&nbsp; WHILE HE WAS STANDING AT THE STOVE
A TUPPERWARE DISH FLEW OUT OF THE CABINET AND HIT HIM ON THE LEG.&nbsp;
I WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM WHEN HE LET OUT A LITTLE SCREAM.&nbsp; I ASKED
HIM WHAT HAPPENED AND HE TOLD ME.&nbsp; I LOOKED AROUND AND THERE WAS NO
WAY THAT IT COULD HAVE JUST FALLEN AND HIT HIM.&nbsp; THE CABINET WAS A
GOOD DISTANCE FROM WHERE HE WAS STANDING.&nbsp; HE WAS A LITTLE FREAKED
OUT BY THAT.</b>
<br><b>FOR THE MOST PART WE WERE NEVER REALLY SCARED ONCE WE GOT USED TO
THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS.&nbsp; WE KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE AND IT
WAS JUST BEING PLAYFUL.&nbsp; IT NEVER CAUSED ANY HARM AND IT LIKED PLAYING
WITH OUR PETS.&nbsp; ALL THE ANIMALS WOULD PLAY WITH THINGS THAT WEREN'T
THERE.&nbsp; WE HAD A CAT, 2 DOGS, AND A RABBIT.&nbsp; THEY ALL PLAYED
WITH THE INVISIBLE THING.&nbsp; IT WAS FUNNY TO WATCH THEM SOMETIMES.</b>
<br><b>I HAVE SINCE MOVED OUT, BUT MY MOM STILL LIVES THERE AND MY BROTHER
MOVED OUT JUST RECENTLY.&nbsp; I ASKED HIM WHILE HE WAS STILL THERE IF
ANYTHING STRANGE EVER HAPPENED AFTER I LEFT.&nbsp; HE SAID NO.&nbsp; IN
FACT HE HAD MY TV IN HIS ROOM WHEN I MOVED OUT.&nbsp; IT NEVER DID COME
ON BY ITSELF AFTER I MOVED OUT.&nbsp; I OFTEN WONDER SOMETIMES IF THE GHOST
FOLLOWED ME WHEN I MOVED.&nbsp; I HAVE HAD A FEW STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN
TO ME.&nbsp; I HAVE LIVED IN 3 APARTMENTS AND STRANGE THINGS HAPPENED IN
ALL OF THEM.&nbsp; THE POWER TO MY VCR WOULD TURN ON BY ITSELF AND THE
TAPE WOULD REWOUND. THIS HAPPENED 3 TIMES.&nbsp; I HAVE A CAT FIGURINE
THAT WOULD MOVE OUT OF ITS PLACE.&nbsp; I WOULD PUT IT BACK AND IN A COUPLE
OF HOURS WOULD MOVE AGAIN. I HAVE HEARD FOOTSTEPS IN THE APARTMENT AND
HAVE FELT LIKE I WAS NOT ALONE.&nbsp; MY MUSIC BOXES WOULD START PLAYING
ON THEIR OWN.&nbsp; I HAVE HAD THINGS MOVED FROM WHERE THEIR PLACE TO BE
FOUND SOMEWHERE ELSE.&nbsp; I DON'T KNOW WHY THE GHOST WOULD FOLLOW ME
IF IT IS THE SAME ONE.&nbsp; IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL JUST A LITTLE
ANNOYING AT TIMES, BUT FOR THE MOST PART I LIKE HAVING A GHOST AROUND AS
LONG AS IT IS FRIENDLY.&nbsp; I BELIEVE THIS GHOST IS AND DOES THESE THINGS
JUST TO LET ME KNOW THAT IT IS STILL AROUND.</b>
<br><b>THANK YOU FOR READING MY STORY. THERE AREN'T TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT
I CAN TALK TO THIS ABOUT.&nbsp; SORRY IT IS SO LONG. THIS WAS THE SHORTEST
VERSION I COULD COME UP WITH.&nbsp; I KNOW I HAVE LEFT SOME THINGS OUT,
BUT THE STORY WAS ALREADY LONG ENOUGH.&nbsp; I WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED IF
ANYTHING NEW HAPPENS.&nbsp; ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU.</b>

she was alive. but tragicly, one night on the way to one of her shows Ms.
Absy died in a car acident. after her death, a new drama teacher came and
exept for a few missing objects now and then, all seemed normal. but one
day, about a year after Ms. Absy's death, a student notice a group of black
stains on the red carpet infront of the stage. from close up, it is said
that the stains looked like a bunch of bean-shaped dark spots. but when
standing on the stage and looking down, it is sworn the stains looked like
Ms. Absy's face. We have new capeting in the theater now and their is a

<br><b>Surrounded</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: COAmeliaD@msn.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>My name is Colleen and I have lived with ghosts all of my life. It
doesn't matter were I go or what I am doing I see them every where. I can
be walking down the street or driving down the road and I see them. Most
people think that ghosts are spooky things that are scary and bloody and
gory but in fact they are not. I remember just a few months ago I had just
turned 15 and my mother was picking me up from night school. When I saw
here a pretty lady standing on the side of the road staring at me. I can
remember it like it was yesterday she was standing there with short blonde
hair and an outfit that looked like it had came out of a 70's catalog or
something. And I looked at her shoes and said to my mom "mom look at that
girl" and my mother replied "who there is no one there" I thought my mom
must have been crazy or something but when I looked back there was no one
standing there. That was just the beginning to my surprise a few weeks
later I was sitting in bed and all of a sudden I didn't feel alone anymore
in fact I felt surrounded. I opened my eyes and there they were every where
ghosts all around me I didn't believe in ghosts at the time but I learned
that if you don't believe in them they can hurt you no matter what anyone
says I know because I woke up with cuts and bruises until I believed. I
yelled for my mom she banished them with an old method of banishing evil,
ghosts, and even demons from your house. The next night they didn't not
come back but I saw an angel that night sitting at the foot of my bed now
a guardian angel doesn't come unless you are in trouble. She sat at my
bed side for hours she was the most beautiful thing I had ever saw. Thou
most people think angels have wings well she did not she was dressed in
white and had no flaws at all and the kindest eyes you will ever see. Then
here came another all dressed in white as beautiful as the other with no
flaws. But this one had something different this one had cold eyes then
they turned this white color and that one started to stare at my guardian
angel she held up her bible and banished this impostor from my sight this
impostor was a demon and one of the most dangerous at that. Before she
left and I have never told anyone this before. But before she left she
said some kind of a prayer to me. The next morning I went to my mother
and looked at her and said it "came" to me last night and told her the
prayer. Then she told me that, that particular prayer she told me ever
night as a baby. And then she said how could have remembered that. All
I said was I didn't it came to me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Personal Stories</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: maryprincess2001@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>This one is from Mount Vernon, Washington.&nbsp; Our family used
to live at 902 Hoag Road, in Mt. Vernon.&nbsp; It was a simple little 3
bedroom rambler, then after a couple years of work, it turned to a 5 bedroom
house with an extra living room.&nbsp; My mom, dad, older sister, my little
sister, my little brother and I all lived there.&nbsp; At first it was
just little stuff happening, tools being unplugged, heavy perfume in empty
rooms.&nbsp; The feeling that you are being watched in your sleep.&nbsp;
Stuff like that.&nbsp; I wish that was the end of it, because when all
that passed, what would come next.. chills my bones even to this day!&nbsp;
One night, as we were watching tv, it shut off by itself...we got tired
of turning it back on, so we yelled for it to stop and it did.&nbsp; Then
there were two little girls, I guess at one time were twins.&nbsp; One
kept trying to get my younger sister to go outside and we were afraid,
and were going to leave the room, and the other one appeared and started
to play with my newborn son in his swing.&nbsp; I quickly picked him up
and we left the house.&nbsp; My room seemed to be the spot for them to
hang out in, I would awake at night to the feeling that there were things
in the corners of my room...my mom said it was from reading all those Stephen
King books.&nbsp; But that was not it.&nbsp; I was so afraid of them coming
back I put cedar in every corner of my room, hung it in all the corners
of the ceilings, around my bed on my bed, over the doorway, and I slept
with it in my hand.&nbsp; I was so afraid I even turned to sleeping with
the light ON!&nbsp; I eventually moved out and this is where my mom takes
over.&nbsp; Thi s never stopped happening, so we called in the Shakers.&nbsp;
A group of people from the Swinomish Indian Tribe, in LaConner.&nbsp; They
came in to "cleanse" our house.&nbsp; They started in the older part of
the house first, in my parents room.&nbsp; When they went to "Clean" the
closet, they found there were "people" in there.&nbsp; They were told to
move on, there was a lady that didnt want to go.&nbsp; She promised she
wouldnt hurt anyone if she stayed, but in the end...she left.&nbsp; Then
they came toward the other end of the house and my room.&nbsp; When they
opened the door to go down the steps, was a demonic growl that sticks in
your mind forever.&nbsp; They said they didnt know what that was or what
it wanted, only that it didnt want to leave..&nbsp; This was were all the
things were that didnt want to go were.&nbsp; Even the cat that slips through
every once in a while.&nbsp; I had just moved back from Oklahoma back to
my old end of my house, next to my old room.&nbsp; My son and I had just
laid down to go to sleep and later in the middle of the night, he woke
up and said he couldnt sleep.&nbsp; When I asked him why, he said the cat
kept waking him up.&nbsp; I asked him, what cat?&nbsp; I knew what cat
he meant, but I never told him about it.&nbsp; He repeated the sound the
cat makes, and I knew not everything had left.&nbsp; After that, we always
slept with the light on and the radio on.&nbsp; My dad had moved out after
that, and a lady rented it for a while, but moved out shortly there after.&nbsp;
When we went to clean the house for my dad to move back in, I was the first
one there.&nbsp; I headed to my dads room to vacuum, and I was almost all
the way done, and the closet doors were shaking as though someone were
on the inside kicking them out.&nbsp; I jumped half out of my skin and
took off running.&nbsp; I grabbed the phone that was next to the door on
the way out and called my dad.&nbsp; I refused to be in that house alone
again!&nbsp; My dad has since sold the house and I do not miss it!&amp;n
p; I only hope that they are doing okay there.&nbsp; That is the end for
me, but maybe the beginning for someone else.&nbsp; Thanks for listening....</b><b></b>

<br><b>Old Family Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>Here are a few of stories from the "old days".&nbsp; My aunt was
born with a "veil" or caul over her face.&nbsp; This is a thin piece of
tissue that is easily removed after birth.&nbsp; Folklore says that a child
born with this is special in some way, and in my aunts case it was said
she was psychic.&nbsp; When she was small she would ask her parents about
the faces she saw in the trees and the balls of light that on occasion
she saw but no one else did.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I knew her as an adult, she
told me that she would hear breathing in a closet in one of the bedrooms.&nbsp;
One day when she had heard it for a while she got up the courage to open
the door.&nbsp; When she did, she saw a small little man dressed like a
"jockey".&nbsp; She said he had a cap on with holes in it and his hair
was sticking up thru the holes.&nbsp; He was sitting upon a box and looked
up at her and smiled when she opened the door.&nbsp;&nbsp; She of course
ran out of the house and stayed outside until her parents came home.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another time she said she was laying on the bed in that same room with
the door to the bedroom open.&nbsp; She could see out to the upstairs landing
where my grandmother, in the winter would hang a wire clothes line from
one wall to another down the hall.&nbsp; On the line were wooden clothes
pins.&nbsp; As she lay there she heard foot steps come up the stairs and
then one by one each pin was plucked off the line very fast one after another
and dropped on the wooden floor below.&nbsp; Many years later in this same
room as a child I was playing with Barbie's on the bed.&nbsp; There was
a calendar on the wall and the top part was a print of Jesus' face.&nbsp;
I laid down on the bed as I was tired and had been told to take a nap.&nbsp;
As I lay there I looked at the calendar and I swear the eyes fluttered
and then looked down at me!&nbsp; I flew up out of the bed and practically
fell down the stairs trying to get down them!</b>
<br><b>My grandfather told me one time that as he sat in the kitchen one
evening he could see what to him appeared to be a swinging lantern making
its way up along the road behind the line of trees along the way to their
place.&nbsp; When he first saw it he thought it was a neighbor coming up
to the house.&nbsp; This was in the early 1940's and they lived a way back
in the woods on about 22 acres.&nbsp; They had no phones or electric or
indoor plumbing for that matter nor did their neighbors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any
way, the lantern would always go out as it reached the edge of the trees
and never rounded the corner into the open.&nbsp; Some times he would hear
the gate open and slam shut and foot steps come up the the flagstones to
the kitchen door.&nbsp; Sometimes there were several knocks on the door
but every time he answered it, there was no one there.&nbsp; No one ever
locked their doors back then, and one night as he lay in bed (first floor
bedroom), he heard the back door open and someone pad softly into his room
and stand next to the bed.&nbsp; Well he thought it was one of their kids
(they had 10) come home late and when he turned over to see who it was
he said it was Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp; They looked at each other for a while
and then he said he just turned around and went out of the room and was
gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandfather could also do the most interesting thing.&nbsp;
He could sit on the back porch and actually call birds to him.&nbsp; They
would come and perch on the railing.&nbsp; Once I saw a cardinal come and
sit right on his hand and he fed it seed.</b>
<br><b>Any way, my grandparents saw a lot of things around them as well
as did my mom and her brothers and sisters.&nbsp; My grandparents have
been gone a long time now and that house has fallen down and just the chimneys
are left to stand as a witness to the things that still may go on up on
that hill way back in those woods</b>

<br><b>North Pole, Svalbard Spirit(s)</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:artistdemanga@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>Hey there.</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I visited the Svalbard islands a few weeks ago with my parents to
celebrate my eighteenth bitrhday. Things went well, and the last late afternoon
we were all gathered in an old shack to have a cozy farewell dinner. The
shack was pretty isolated. It lay a few kilometers away from the largest
city on Svalbard, Longyearbyen ( under 1000 inhabitants ). A dogsled-ride
had also been planned, but due to the unpredictable nature of the island
we had to cancel it. The snowstorm that raged that aftrenoon was intence,
as most of them are over there; everywhere you turned there was nothing
but snow and ice. Nearly all of it blasting in your face as you helplessly
bumped into others trying to find your way around.</b>
<br><b>So, with the weather blocking all means of travel, we weren't going
anywhere. And since they don't have hover-buses capable of dancing over
the snow there yet we had to wait for our four wheeler to make it's way
to the shack a bit longer too.</b>
<br><b>Later on, the weather no better, I decided to make the best of the
situation. I flinged out my digital camera and snapped a few shots of the
group and random things in the shack, just to kill some time. That's when
freaky thing nuber one took place. For starters, a few people, including
me, got noaticeable shivers. I even found some goosebumps crawling up my
hands and back. Now, concidering that we actually were sitting pretty near
the north pole in a snowstorm, one would probably find the shivers quite
normal. The fact is however, that it was everything but cold in there.
It was hot as hell. A huge fire was burning in the middle of the room and
had been doing so for the last two hours. And thanks to the wonder of modern
architecture the heat didn't wither off too soon either. A few people were
even sitting around in their polo-shirts ( amazing because you had to wear
a whole lot to keep warm outside ).</b>
<br><b>Even our guide, who actually lived there on the spot, found the
chills somewhat puzzling when asked if there was a door open somewhere.
Thinking nothing more of it because we were all pretty run down from a
full days ventureing in the snowy wilderness and the diminishing breathable
air in the cabin, we returned to our slumbering poses, waiting for the
bus.</b>
<br><b>Half an hour later the weather cleared and we could hop outside
for a longed for breath of fresh air. The bus was en route we were told
and some of us foud time to drop by the dogs cages before we took off as
well. This is when the second strage thing played out. According to our
guide, the caretaker anyway. The dogs, huskeys, who are not known for their
calmness, were nervously tramping the snow in their cramped cages. A few
came up to us swinging their tails, but didn't find the interest to do
so for more than five, six minutes. Something was clearly upsetting them.
A woman in our group suggested that they weren't used to having this many
people around them, but the caretaker didn't seem to aggree. They're usually
very social animals, huskeys. He did admit that they do get somewhat quiet
and alert every once in a while. Not often though. And never when tourists
were visiting.</b>
<br><b>That was pretty much it. The bus came and we found our way back
home the next day.</b>
<br><b>The photo's that I'm sending you are those of the fireplace in the
middle of the room.</b>
<br><b>At first my brain classified it as nothing but flame-trails. What
caught my attention was the fact that two nearly identical flame-trails
appear in two picutres. They were taken about ten minutes apart so I doubt
it's the same pattern shot twice. The contour of a face can be made out
if you look closely. Half the face seems to be covered by the flame, the
other shows a hollow eye and something that resembles a moustache and teeth.
The sencond picutre, taken approx. ten minutes after the first one shows
the same conture, but now more hidden in the flame. There's also something
resembling a smaller face in the cheek of the larger one. It's almost perfect.</b>

<p><b>Long &amp; Fisher Cemetery</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: HappinessIsNot@aol.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>In Sissonville there is Long &amp; Fisher cemetery me and my friends
have seen many things here and have had a lot done to use here. For one
the lights in the place go on and off and certain times of the night, also
the gates also are known to open and close on there own I have had the
gate be open when I go in and&nbsp; then when I go to leave the gate I
came in is now closed ( only about 5 min. had pasted when this happened)
. Finally about 4 times my car has stopped completely infront of the cemetery
at around 1 or 2 at night, I pulled my car over and then when I got to
the parking lot of the bar next to the cemetery my car would start right
back up again ( I had my car checked out the next day and there was nothing
from with it). Me and my friends can say for sure that this place is haunted
and nothing could tell use different.</b>

<br><b>Ghostly Smells</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dave.shuts@btopenworld.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>My name is David Shuttleworth, I live in England, and I'm an electronics
engineer. Consequently I deal with very well defined laws of physics in
my work, have a very rational and logical mind, and anything that falls
outside this rational is too much for my poor fuddled brain to cope with.
The story below is my experience. I am now 34 and have not experienced
anything for maybe 12 years (thank God). If anyone can shed any light on
ghostly smells or my experience I'd be very grateful. Sorry for writing
so much, but I wanted my account to be accurate.</b>
<br><b>I've always been interested in the paranormal but I am also a very
sceptical person. I am convinced that 99% of experiences are the result
of an over active imagination, and I even tried to put my experiences down
to this too.</b>
<br><b>My first encounter was when I was very little, perhaps 4 years old.
The house we lived in was an old Victorian terraced house, it was the house
I had lived in since I was born. I was asleep one night when I was woken
by someone shaking me quite violently, like they were trying to rouse me.
I can remember my impression of the person/apparition to this day. Despite
it being quite dark and my having just woken up, it appeared to be a heavily
set man with a long cloth overcoat on, and strangely wearing one of those
German Army helmets with a spike on top (my family have no Germanic heritage,
and this is England!). Whilst naturally terrified I pretended to be asleep
and the presence disappeared quite quickly. I told my mother but she said
I had dreampt it, and over the years I had no more ghostly encounters until
I was around 19, and although not entirely convinced, I put this experience
down to a dream, as my mother had suggested.</b>
<br><b>My next experiences happened in the 3rd house we lived in. It was
no more than 30 years old and we bought it from the first owners of the
property. It was built on what had been grazing fields and as far as I
am aware no one ever died there (Im pretty certain of that).</b>
<br><b>The activity started after we'd been living there for maybe 4 years
and seemed to happen sporadically every 6 months or so and last for maybe
2 weeks then stop again. They always happened at night time, and seemed
to happen more frequently if we were decorating a room. I would wake up
with the feeling that I was being held down on the bed and no matter how
much I tried I COULD NOT move. This was accompanied with a feeling of malevolence,
and "darkness" - not that the room was dark because it was night-time,
but a feeling that something dark and sinister was present in the room.
It was a very frightening experience. Eventually I would be able to move
again and the darkness would lift (if you've ever experienced this sensation
you'll know exactly what I mean).</b>
<br><b>This would happen every night for a couple of weeks, and during
the time my sleep was very badly interupted. Sometimes (when I was heavily
sedated with alcohol) I would wake up and find that I was upside down in
the bed and the bed had been pulled out from the wall - no mean fete -
it was wedged between the walls and needed lifting over a radiator (I know
we all can wake up in all kinds of strange places after a night on the
beer, and this is exactly what I attributed it to.)</b>
<br><b>At I am a VERY deep sleeper. I never remember my dreams and as I've
said earlier I dont have an over active imagination - the fact that this
kept happening when I was asleep resulted in me putting it down to sleep
paralysis or other sleep related reasons, until that is, the final event.</b>
<br><b>The activity had started up again, the same as usual at first but
suddenly becoming much more intense. The last time I had a sleep related
experience REALLY scared me. I was fast asleep and suddenly woke up instantly
(I could even remember what I was dreaming as I awoke). The atmosphere
in the room felt incredibly nasty - the most evil (and I dont use the word
lightly), malevolent, and terrifying thing that I had ever experienced.
The room felt darker than it ever had, and I was absolutely convinced that
there was something present that did not have my best interests at heart.
I was sure I was in real danger and the only thing I could think to do
was to pray to God and ask Him to protect me (and I am not really religious
at all. I believe in God, but never go to church and don't make religion
a part of my every day life). The result was amazing. The feeling of malevolence
went immediately and the darkness in the room lifted just as fast. I felt
totally calm and safe. The only way that I can describe this is that it
was as though someone had lifted a curtain. My heart was pounding and I
didnt sleep again that night.</b>
<br><b>Even with this experience I still wanted to believe it was sleep
paralysis and nothing more sinister. Thats when the final experience really
convinced me otherwise. People laugh out loud when I tell them this but
I assure you it was NOT funny. This was the only time that I experienced
something whilst not asleep and I DID NOT enjoy it.</b>
<br><b>I was sat in the living room watching TV, it was about 3-00 am.
My parents had gone to bed and I was wide awake. As I watched TV I heard,
as clear as you could imagine, someone at the back of the room breaking
wind (we call it farting in the UK!). I knew that this couldn't be and
as I turned to my right my mind was already thinking "oh my mum or dad
must have come back downstairs without my noticing". Now this is really
absurd! My parents are about the most reserved people you could meet and
would die of shame if they broke wind in public!</b>
<br><b>I turned to look and sure enough there was no one there. I did my
usual rationalisation of "I must have imagined it" and continued watching
TV. About 10 minutes later I'd forgotten all about it when suddenly IT
HAPPENED AGAIN! There was no mistake, I DEFINITELY heard it. I was now
scared. I turned around gingerly and as I did so was hit by the most pungent
smell I've ever experienced filling the room. The smell was actually malevolent
itself. I shot up, turned off the TV and went to my room as fast as I could.
I didn't sleep all night again, instead I lay there praying and watching
the door handle for movement at which point my intention was to scream
so loud that the entire neighbourhood would wake up. Nothing happened,
and after that encounter I've had no others. I still feel uneasy sometimes
when I visit my parents, and my father has now admitted that he has felt
presences before - the kind of thing where you think you see somebody standing
there out of the corner of your eye, but when you turn their gone. And
he's even more sceptical than I am!</b><b></b>

<p><b>DID I BUY A HAUNTED HOUSE</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: dspringle@myself.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I bought and moved into this house in Tulsa, OK in August of 1995.
I will be 68 years old in September of this year. I was a nurse for 46
years until I retired about 3 years ago. I am still in good physical shape
and keep my mind very active with reading and&nbsp; studying about different
subjects. I am not senile in any way shape or form. I have known there
were ghosts since I was in my 20's, because I saw my grandmother's ghost
twice, about 3 years apart . It was always my belief that she had come
to me to warn me of a possible danger to my children, who were very young
at that time. However I am a little concerned about the experiences that
I am going through currently and don't quite know how to deal with it.
All I really know about this house, is that it is a very old house, and
was built&nbsp; probably in the 1920's&nbsp; I do know that the land it
is built on was land belonging to the Creek and Cherokee Indians after
their removal to Oklahoma.</b>
<br><b>A short while after I moved into this house, I started hearing&nbsp;
the footsteps, or sounds of&nbsp; someone walking, and sometimes sounds
like something was being moved. I was not home a lot at that time, because
I was still working as a nurse, and I worked the night shift, and&nbsp;
was asleep for much of the day. On occasion I would wake up because it
seemed that someone would call my name. But there was no one in the house
but me. Anyway this is my story about my past experiences, as well as the
present experiences that seem to be happening much more frequently now.</b>
<br><b>1996-1997-- Sounds of someone walking in house very frequently,
but never saw anyone when I went to look. I have always frequently had
the feeling of being watched, or that there is someone in the house besides
me. Have occasionally thought I glimpsed a cat or dog walking through the
living room when my cat and dogs were all outside. My mother had cancer,
and I kept her here at home with me, under hospice care during the last
months of her life. She died in January of 1997. Mother was very mentally
competent and aware until about a week before she died. She said to me
on several different occasions during those months, "Doris, what is that
cat doing in the house, she's up on my bed!" I would always assure her
that the cat was not in the house. Then she would always say that she was
not crazy, and she knew a cat when she saw one, and&nbsp; that a cat had
indeed, jumped up onto her bed. I had no explanation for that then, nor
do I have one now.</b>
<br><b>My oldest grandson Joseph stayed at my house quite a bit during
those months, to help with lifting my mother in and out of the bed. He
has since told me, that he has always been afraid of this house. He said
he was always scared when he stayed here, and that is why he would never
go to bed until 3-4 o'clock in the morning. He would always stay up and
watch movies or play video games. He also told me that one evening when
he was cleaning up in the garage area, he thought he heard two people talking
in the very back shed in the garage. Said he even went out and looked to
see if he could see anyone, but he saw nothing, just heard the talking.
He said that when him and Crystal and David and Joey were living here with
me for about 3 months he felt some things in here. (They lived with me
during Oct, Nov and December of 2003. He said he would be asleep on a pallet
with the kids, and would suddenly wake up, and he would feel that someone
was standing there over them, just watchin g them. Joseph does not use
any kind of drugs or alcohol. He is 23 years old. said he had not mentioned
it before now because he was afraid it would scare me, or think something
was wrong with him.</b>
<br><b>Then around the last of January of this year, 2004, I was keeping
my great-grandson, Joey, who was 15 months old at the time. There was only
him and me here. He started into the den to get one of his toys, and suddenly
I heard him take a sharp, indrawn breath, and he turned around and came
back to where I was sitting, and kept looking at me and pointing at the
den and jabbering, trying to tell me something. I comforted him, told him
that it was okay for him to go into the den and get a toy, that there was
nothing in there. So after 3-4 minutes he started back through the door
of the den, and immediately came running back to me, grabbed me and crawled
up into my lap and hid his face against my chest. He wouldn't raise his
head to look at me or anything, and was clinging to me very tightly. He
stayed that way for about 5 minutes. He would not go back into the den
that night. I could tell he was frightened of something.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The following weekend, a friend of my youngest son's spent
the weekend with us. He's a 33-year-old man. His name is Christian. No
drugs, doesn't drink. He slept in the den on Friday night. I had never
discussed any of the above occurrences with this man. That Saturday morning
I did tell him about what happened with the baby, Joey. When I got to the
part about me telling Joey " there's nothing in there", Christian interrupted
me, and said," I don't know about there not being anything in there, because
I sure thought I saw something last night." I asked him what he saw, and
he said it was a fog-like or mist-like shape over by the front windows.
He has not slept in the den since then, although he has spent two weekends
here since then. He does not like to talk about what he saw either.</b>
<br><b>About a week later, I was sitting on the couch in the den working
on my genealogy papers. I was alone in the house. I straightened up for
a moment to rest my back, and felt someone or something touch the left
side of my neck. It was just like someone ran a fingertip down my neck.
I looked around the entire room, but saw nothing. A couple of days later,
I was here alone, and walked into the den to put something away, and as
soon as I walked through the den doorway, it was so cold I couldn't believe
it. Matter of fact I thought someone may have turned on the room air conditioner,
and walked over to check it, but it was not on, nor was the ceiling fan.
This was in the daytime.</b>
<br><b>A couple of weeks ago, my grandson Joseph, my son Ross, a neighbor
lady, Natalie and myself, were visiting in my living room. Natalie was
telling us a story, and she suddenly stopped talking and looked toward
the kitchen. Joseph asked her what was the matter. She said," Did you all
see that?" We asked "What". She said she saw a person walk out of the den,
and in front of the chair where my son was sitting, and go into the kitchen.
The rest of us had seen nothing. About 4 days later Natalie was here, and
her and me were talking, and all at once she turned around and looked toward
the den. She asked me if my son was back in his room. I told her he wasn't
at home. She had heard someone say something. I had not heard it at all.
But last week I was reading in the living room, and I distinctly heard
someone say something. It was a high-pitched voice, but I couldn't tell
exactly what they said. It was just one word.</b>
<br><b>Joey, who is now 18 months old, continues to be frightened of the
den area. Sometimes he starts into the den, and then turns around and comes
back into the living room. He always points back to the den, and tries
to tell me something, but cannot form words yet.</b>
<br><b>I continue to hear someone walking almost daily now, and continue
to feel that I am being watched at times. Whoever the ghost or ghosts are,
them and me will have to live here together, because I own this old house,
and cannot afford to pay rent again since I am now retired. I am going
to continue to keep a log of these happenings. If anyone has any input
on this story, or has had similar experiences, I would like to hear from
you. Thank all of you at Shadowlands for listening to my story.</b>

<p><b>The Townhouse in Penticton</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: kymlentz@yahoo.ca</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>Hi, my name is Kimberly and I am here to tell you of the time when
I was living in a haunted house. It happened back when I was living in
Penticton BC Canada, me and my two best friends, Amanda and Cassandra,
moved in to an old townhouse together. Nothing weird happened at first
that we know of until all of us sat down one night and started talking
about ghosts and stuff. For myself, when I was home alone I would hear
footsteps walking around upstairs and doors opening and closing when I
knew I was the only one home. I remember a lot of times when I would be
upstairs in my room and hear the front door slam and say "hello" to whoever
came home and hear their response but no one would be there. The lights
would also flicker on and off, and Cassandra's bird cage actually moved
from its stand in her room, across the room onto her bed!&nbsp; We had
incidences where dishes in the kitchen would clang around like someone
was putting them away or washing them, the water would run in the bathroom.
All three of us have had sensations of touching on our shoulders, bottoms,
arms, legs and hair. The T.V. would turn itself on in the middle of the
night or day, the stereo we had in the living room would turn on to a particular
song and VERY loud so that it would totally surprise us. The weirdest thing
that happened was when Cassandra bought herself a video camera. Cass and
I were goofing around with the camera. When we decided to watch ourselves,
there were orbs all around us, especially around my head. There were what
we called, "explosions" of orbs all around when we would laugh or talk
really&nbsp; loud. Also, in the background there was this eerie sound like
someone crying. The noise would get louder when we went into certain parts
of the house, like in the kitchen, in my bedroom, and in the livin room.
My cat would always look like he was playing with someone or something,
like he was looking at something too. We found out later that the townhouse
was built back in the 60's and that there was a man and his wife and daughter
that lived there. The man went crazy and killed his wife and kept his daughter
upstairs in my room hostage and molested her and beat her and eventually
killed her and himself. After we heard about this we all were very scared
and tried to contact them via Ouija board. This didn't work so we left
it alone. I always felt that there was someone in my room with me in the
far corner by the closet, (that's where a lot of the orbs and the sound
were the strongest), but I never felt that scared, just sad. I felt someone
touch me in the shower and also stroking my hair when I was trying to sleep.
The other weird thing was, was that my room locked from the outside instead
of the inside. Weird hey? Well, that's my story as I remember it. I also
want to add that we never actually SAW anything, just out of the corner
of our eyes. But I think that's scarier than actually SEEING something:)
Well, email me back for any comments. Thank you! My email is kymlentz@yahoo.ca</b><b></b>

<p><b>Something I will Never Forget</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: liljwick@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>It's happened 3 times now, driving down that road. It all started
because my friend and I where on our way back from her boyfriends house
to her moms house, which is a few towns away. I was heading North and she
told me to keep going straight because i seemed easier than zig-zaging
to her moms house and having to go threw the other towns. So we took the
road, and both of us realised we've never been down it before, and ended
up sort of lost because of the curves in the road. As we took this one
curve we both noticed something on the right side of the road. It looked
the the form of a man about 6-7 feet tall on the side of the road. As we
drew closer all we could see was the outline of what we assumed was a man,
and it looked as though he had on a long coat and a hat. Aside from that
we couldnt' see many other details. Then as we drew up along side of the
figure he started to run toward the woods, and as we slowed down to watch
why he was doing it, he jumped into a tree and started to climb it, but
I still don't see how he could jump about 15 foot into a tree like that.
We were both so unnerved we and overcome with a feeling of panic that we
began to cry and all I could do was get out of there. I wish that was the
last time I saw it. But we had to take that road again one night to drop
my other friend off at her Grandmothers house. It was me, the same girl
as the first time, and the other girl Christina. We came around the same
curve, and to what we thought was our luck didn't see the figure again.
As we can around the next curve not far from where we first saw it, we
slowed down because of the stop sign and were ready to turn onto the road
Christinas Grandmother lived on. I heard Christina in the back seat scream,
and as i turned around to e what it was, the figure was behind my car.
This time I could see more of his features. He was definately male looking,
with the evilest grin I've ever seen. His eyes were dark and peircing,
and they stared at us, laughing at us. The only feeling I had was on getting
away from it. I tryed to drive, pushed my accelerater to the floor, and
my car wouldn't move, i could hear the front tires sqwealing, and could
still see the figure in the rear view mirror. It had grabbed my car, and
for some reason, was strong enough to hold it even though I had the gas
petal to the floor. After about five of the longest minutes of my life,
the car spun forward, and we took off. I could still see it behind us at
the stop sign, and it looked like it was laughing at us. I know this seems
like either we are making it up or somebody is playing on that road, even
i had thoughts that it was someone messing with us at times. After these
two inncidents because the figure was so life like. Then came the last
time i was forced to go down the road. My friend Travis had thought I was
going crazy when i told him about the two encounters, so he told me he'd
take me down the road to prove I was only making it up. I didn't want to
go, so we disided to take his sister Alicia too so I would have another
girl with me. As we came up to that section of the road, we went around
the curve. Between the curve we first encountered it, and the last curve
of the road, in the feild we saw a flash of light. I looked behind us and
sure enough it was behind us running behind the car, we sped up to about
70mph and it was still right behind us. I know no human can run that fast,
and Travis knew then i wasn't fibbing. After talking to another friend
of mine, he said he's encountered it too while driving, down the road.
It gave me goosebumps as he described the figure to the dot. I wont' drive
down that road anymore.</b>

<br><b>Cops or TV</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: schernikkm@marfork.usmc.mil</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people say, after I tell them about ghost,
that this is the dumbest thing they have ever heard, but I'll tell it any
way.&nbsp;&nbsp; About five years ago before I joined the Marine Corps,
I was volunteer with my local Police Dept.. One of the policemen in my
home town and I had become real good friends during my time there, so when
he asked me to help him move from one house to another I quickly agreed
to help him.&nbsp; We spent three days moving his things into his new wife's
house and on the third day after the last truck load was inside the group
of us "moving men" took a breather in the living room. We started talking
about this and that when all of the sudden the T.V. turned on, I thought
nothing of it at the time, I thought that maybe Geoff (the cop who I was
helping move) had sat on the remote or something to that effect.&nbsp;
Geoff quickly got up from his seat and grabbed the remote off of a table
that was a few feet from where he was sitting, or where anyone was sitting
for that matter and turned the T.V. off .&nbsp; I didn't think much of
it at the time in till a short moment latter the T.V. did it again and
as before Geoff turned the T.V. off . It was at that time another Policemen
"Danny" asked if there was something wrong with his T.V. .&nbsp; Geoff
smiled and said "no its just Casper" a nickname Geoff had come up with
for the ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course we all asked "who".&nbsp; Geoff just
smiled and told us the history of "Casper".&nbsp;&nbsp; Geoff started in
law enforcement&nbsp; in New Mexico (this story I'm telling you takes place
in Texas by the way) in the Early 1980's&nbsp; he said that once when he
was a young sheriff deputy he was at a fellow deputies home and the TV
started to turn on and off on its own, when Geoff had asked about it, the
other Deputy had said he had a ghost that would turn the TV off and on,
Geoff then told the deputy that he was "full of IT" and blew it off.&nbsp;
Latter Geoff noticed this happing at his home.&nbsp; Geoff told the other
man about this and the guy started to laugh and said "good he can fallow
you now".&nbsp; Geoff still did not buy it and thought maybe it was just
the T.V. , he quickly went out and got a new one, but the problem still
remained.&nbsp; Geoff just assumed that the other cop was some how messing
with him and just learned to live with it, in till Geoff moved to North
Texas to be a Local Policemen but the TV still acted the way it did in
New Mexico. It was at that point Geoff knew the Sheriff deputy form New
Mexico was not "messing" with him but just may have been telling the truth,
Geoff called his ol' buddy in New Mexico and asked if it was still happing
to him as well and the deputy replied that he had not had a problem since
it stated happing to Geoff.&nbsp; So Geoff was convinced that he had something
with him and his TV and gave it the name Casper.&nbsp; The problem followed
him to my home town in Central Texas, a small town just outside of Austin,
and now we all know of Casper.</b>
<br><b>I myself saw no reason to doubt Geoff he was not the type to make
something up like that and he is the type to just&nbsp; "tell it like it
is", But Danny responded very much the same way as Geoff did years before,
now here is the "kicker"&nbsp; when Danny heard that story his response
was "if there is a ghost, he can come home with me".&nbsp; Well&nbsp; needless
to say just a month latter we were at work and Danny came in with a different
point of view, claiming that now his T.V. was acting up and he was about
to get a new one because it was just an old TV, I left the Police Dept.
shortly after that to Join the Marine Corps and over the last few years
have lost track of both Danny who is now retired and Geoff who is now a
cop in AZ.&nbsp; but the last update I got on this from another cop who
knew the story, but was not there that day, was that Danny had renamed
the T.V. ghost "Elvis". Like I said before its a little "cheesy" but it
happened just the way I told it, I have had a few "run ins" with what I
believe are ghosts over the years, I do love looking for them and love
your web sight, and when I tell people of the things I've seen this story
seems to be a favorite even among toughs who don't believe in ghosts.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Psychiatric Ward</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: wondercat@verizon.net</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>Several years ago (aprox. 2001) I worked at a&nbsp; Psychiatric hospital
in Arizona.&nbsp; Almost from the day I started, my co-workers would jokingly
tell me that the place was haunted.&nbsp; I wouldn't, at the time, call
myself a skeptic, but felt that I would really have to see something significant
before I would let myself believe anyplace was "haunted."</b>
<br><b>Throughout the first year and a half working there I saw and heard
many things. (doors slamming closed, faint voices, shadows out of the corner
of my eye, etc.)&nbsp; However,&nbsp; There was always a way to tell myself
it was nothing but my imagination, or maybe the wind, air conditioning,
patients, etc.</b>
<br><b>I finally saw something I absolutely couldn't rationalize.&nbsp;
I worked the night shift.&nbsp; I was sick that night and there was no
one who could cover my shift, so I worked through it.&nbsp; I cannot recall
anything "supernatural" happening that night until 5:30 am and we where
getting ready for shift change.&nbsp; The bathroom the employees used was
separate from&nbsp; the one the patients used on the ward.&nbsp; Our bathroom
was in a seldom used room adjacent to the nurses station.&nbsp; Out of
everyplace in this hospital ward, that room and bathroom always gave me
the creeps.&nbsp; We had some nurses/Psych techs that were actually afraid
too use it and would prefer to use the patients bathroom instead.&nbsp;
I was sick and beginning to run a fairly nasty fever.&nbsp; Just before
the oncoming employees began to arrive, I used that bathroom.&nbsp; As
I walked out of the bathroom I froze dead in my tracks.&nbsp; Standing
to my left was a man aprox. as tall as myself (6' 3").&nbsp; He was wearing
a medium brown colored pants suit with an old style hat in his hand.&nbsp;
It was a suit like you would see someone wear in the 30's or as late as
the 40's.&nbsp; His hair was thick and was slicked back like a man from
that era would wear it.</b>
<br><b>I saw all of this as clear as day and yet it was for a split second,
because when I looked toward him, no one was there.&nbsp; I remember that
I really didn't think much of it at the time, because I was sick and very
tired.&nbsp; I think everyone from time to time will see goofy things when
they are running a fever and overly tired at the same time.</b>
<br><b>I took the following day off from work and came back that next work
night.&nbsp; Me and this one nurse would often joke about the spooks and
haunts on our ward.&nbsp; Later, after the patients where asleep, and we
had began our paperwork, she jokingly said to me "Hey, remember the other
night when you where sick,&nbsp; I saw the ghost."&nbsp; I said "Oh yeah,
where?"&nbsp; She said "It was about a quarter to six that morning. Just
before shift change; I was coming out of the bathroom and I saw......"&nbsp;
I said "Wait a second!"</b>
<br><b>You have too remember these same people worked the previous night
without me.&nbsp; She had told them all about what she had seen.&nbsp;
We where all sitting at tables in the middle of a dead quite psychiatric
ward; therefore, everyone was listening to our conversation.&nbsp; I stopped
her description of what she had seen and said "Wait a second. Did he look
like.............?"&nbsp; I described to her the man that I had seen.&nbsp;
She and everyone sitting around us looked pale/shocked.&nbsp; I had described
exactly what she told them the previous night.&nbsp; Some people thought
we were playing a joke on them and all we could do was assure them that
we were sincere.</b>
<br><b>While I worked there, a new hospital was built and the old building
was turned into Doctors offices for an outpatient clinic. I have no doubt
that those doctors are experiencing some of the same things to this day.
And what about the patients?&nbsp; I can remember on more than one occasion
patients, in the middle of the night, stepping out of there rooms and saying
such things as "Someone is in my room", or "I'm hearing voices."&nbsp;
What do you tell someone who has been diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia?&nbsp;
"it was just a ghost."&nbsp; Yeah right ! ! !There is no way I can convince
myself that what I saw that night was just my imagination.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Years of Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: private_baird@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>To start off I can say my life has been far from normal.&nbsp; At
the age of 2 my mom passed away from heart complications.&nbsp; I have
a feeling that some of the stuff that I am about to tell you my mom has
had a hand in protecting me from this entity who seems to want to get at
me for an unknown reason.</b>
<br><b>It all started back when I was probably 7 years old I lived in a
one story house in Ontario CA right off the 60 freeway.&nbsp; I never knew
of anything about ghosts till these things started happening to me.&nbsp;
I was sleeping in my brothers room that night when he woke me up saying
"Look at the closet" when I looked over at the closet I saw this hand holding
onto it.&nbsp; I was half awake not really thinking just wanting to go
back to sleep so I got up went to the light switch and turned the light
on at which time the hand disappeared.&nbsp; I know that sounds crazy and
far fetched, but that's exactly what happened.&nbsp; I turned the light
back off and it came back onto the closet door at which point I was just
pissed off and I walked to the closet door and slammed it onto the hand.&nbsp;
After slamming the closet door onto this hand it whithered into the door.&nbsp;
I know I am not losing my mind in this story the very next morning I was
talking to my brother and he described the exact same thing that happened
the night before.</b>
<br><b>I dont remember exactly how old I was when the next event took place
all I really know is that my dad was having one of his poker nights at
our house with his friends.&nbsp; One of his friends brought his son with
him so he can play with me and my brother.&nbsp; Well as the night wore
on it came time for all of us to lay down and the other boy wouldn't go
to bed so I offered him my teddy bear at which he took and I assume went
to bed.&nbsp; Sometime in the middle of the night I woke up wanting my
bear back I knew everyone had left so I knew I could go out and get it
so I walked out of my room into the living room.&nbsp; As I come to the
couch I see this person sleeping with my teddy bear I stare at him for
a moment and the persons body was facing towards the back of the couch
so I couldn't see the face.&nbsp; I went back to my room to look at my
brother which was still in his bed then back out to the living room again
when I realized the person on the couch looked exactly like my brother
except I couldn't see his face, but he was wearing the same exact thing
as he was although I know my brother was in the room.&nbsp; I grabbed my
teddy bear from this person and started hitting it over the head with my
bear.&nbsp; Something came to my mind telling me I didn't want this thing
to turn around and see me because it will either scare me to death or kill
me so I just turned around and walked back to my room.&nbsp; The next morning
I woke up and my teddy bear was lying on the floor next to my bed.&nbsp;
I left my room and asked my Nanny who was ussually the first one up in
the morning if there was someone on the couch and she said no.</b>
<br><b>Alot of my instances with unknown things seem to happen at night
so granted I became scared of the dark.&nbsp; After a while my nanny moved
out of our house so I was able to get my own room so I convinced my dad
to also get me a night-light which he did.&nbsp; That night I was being
bad so my dad told me no night light and being the coniving son I was I
saw that my door was shut so I stuffed some of my clothes at the bottom
of my door so the light wouldn't seep out and turned on my night light.&nbsp;
Sometime during the night I don't know when I woke up opening one eye the
night light was still on after I opened both it turned off.&nbsp; There
was noone in the room the door never opened and never closed seeing this
happen I was terrorfied I ran and grabed my bible and turned the night
light back on placing my bible underneath the light.&nbsp; The next morning
I woke up with my bible underneath the light and my light still on.</b>
<br><b>I've told my parents of these situations at which they would just
shrug it off and say it was all in my head.</b>
<br><b>We ended up moving away from that house to another house about a
mile down the road in the neighboring city at which point I had thought
I had left all of that stuff behind me and didn't have to worry about it
anymore.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp; I ended up getting the middle bedroom
in a two story house in Chino,CA.&nbsp; One night I was sleeping and I
felt someone tickle my feet so I assumed my brother was playing games with
me so I decided I would play with him I got out of my bed went to his room
and tickled his feet and ran back to my room.&nbsp; I waited in my room
for him to continue the game, but he never game I got back up and headed
back into his room and he was standing at the door half awake (And you
can tell if a person had just woken up and that's the way he was) saying
why did you tickle my feet.&nbsp; I told him that he tickled mine and he
said he didn't.&nbsp; I started devoloping this sense when abnormal things
were around me my breathing would become more shallow my body will start
tingling and that sense is still with me.</b>
<br><b>My little sister was born and contrary to what I told my parents
about putting her in that middle bedroom they did anyways and I had to
move in with my brother.&nbsp; There would be nights my little sister would
wake up screaming there's something in that bedroom.&nbsp; I tried to tell
my parents they wouldn't listen.&nbsp; Staying in my brothers room there
were shutters that would let you peer down into the living room so my parents
moved our night light down into the living room area.&nbsp; One morning
my brother asked me if I saw the shadows go across the night light the
night before I told him I didn't at which he told me to stay awake they
might come back.&nbsp; I did and sure enough they did there were 5 shadows
that went across that night light and there were only 4 members living
in that house 1 of which couldn't walk yet and 2 were in there bedroom
(me and my brother) I still don't know who they were.</b>
<br><b>Since then I have come to the fact this thing is following me it
followed me to UT where I told my roommates about it, but they didn't beleive
me till they saw the shadow of the thing.&nbsp; That night we were having
a pillow fight (well we'll say they were beating me with the pillows)I
happened to glance at the corner of the room where I saw it I told my roommates
to look over there and they saw the shadow too they all ran back to their
beds and watched the shadow move across the room to my locker and then
to the chair between my bed and everyone elses and vanish.&nbsp; After
that day noone messed with me.</b>
<br><b>Since UT I have yet to hear from it I have started a family of my
own which I did warn my wife about it, but since I started my new family
I haven't heard from it.</b>
<br><b>You can believe my story if you choose I find alot of people think
that as a little kid my imagination was getting the best of me, but the
last episode happened when I was 22.</b><b></b>

</p><hr width="100%"><b></b>
<p><b>Was it just my imagination?</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: mph@rdplus.net</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>&nbsp;I have never really brought up my experience into open conversation,</b>
<br><b>although I did mention it to my Mum and Sister the day after it
happened.</b>
<br><b>It's one of these things where you're not totally sure if it did
really</b>
<br><b>happen, or if you just imagined it.</b>
<br><b>I've always been a light sleeper, which doesn't help when you're
a nervous</b>
<br><b>person and afraid of the dark!! I had been sharing a room with my
two</b>
<br><b>sisters ever since we moved house from up North, until one day I
decided to</b>
<br><b>detach myself from sharing, and grow up a little by having my own
room. The</b>
<br><b>only room which was avaliable to have was the room next door, which
was</b>
<br><b>known to us as our 'toy room'. I didn't care as long as I had my
own room</b>
<br><b>so that when my mates came round to stay, at least we would have
a little</b>
<br><b>privacy away from the whining!!</b>
<br><b>After decorating over the weekend, and had moved my bits and bobs
out of my</b>
<br><b>old room, I finally settled down. Night time was a major problem
for me</b>
<br><b>because it felt really strange being by myself, and listening to
the</b>
<br><b>silence of the house. I could usually hear my sisters breathing,
but not</b>
<br><b>now. Another problem was of course the light sleeping. I just remaing
awake</b>
<br><b>for what seemed like hours, waiting for something to happen. I never</b>
<br><b>completely felt at ease in that room, because I always felt very
cold and</b>
<br><b>isolated from the rest of my family.</b>
<br><b>One night, when everyone was in bed, and I was once again sat up
with my</b>
<br><b>bed-side light on, I suddenly heard a crash downstairs. I jumped
out of my</b>
<br><b>skin - my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my mouth,
(luckly it</b>
<br><b>didn't). The crash sounded like a box of crayons falling onto the
floor.</b>
<br><b>Then there was an awful silence.... This is the part which I can't
fully</b>
<br><b>remember, but I vaguely remember seeing what looked like the shadow,
or</b>
<br><b>outline of a bent over figure on my door, as my bed-side light had
been</b>
<br><b>casting other strange shadows onto the walls and ceiling. I froze</b>
<br><b>completely. The shadow of the figure didn't move, but just remained
on the</b>
<br><b>door. It looked like the dark outline of an old woman becasue I
briefly</b>
<br><b>remember seeing part of a long shawl dangling down, and what appeared
to be</b>
<br><b>a walking stick. I couldn't even blink because I was so horrified.
When I</b>
<br><b>eventually did blink, the shadow had gone. I slowly picked up the
courage</b>
<br><b>to walk out of my room, and bolt across the landing - I slept with
my</b>
<br><b>parents that night.</b>
<br><b>The next morning, I was the first one up. I felt so knackered because
of</b>
<br><b>the terrible night's sleep. I ventured down stairs, and what should
I come</b>
<br><b>across, but a box of pencil crayons, ontop of the dining table,
as if they</b>
<br><b>had never been moved.....................</b>

<br><b>Nursing Facility Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lsmyers1@columbus.rr.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>I work in a long term care nursing facility. There are many stories
I can tell you,but let me give you the most interesting. A co-worker and
I were working the 11-7 shift one night. We were standing at the nurses
station, which is located in the middle of the building. There are four
halls that branch off of each corner of the station. We were just standing
there talking when we heard someone scream "Help!" At first we just stopped
and listened,unsure of where it came from. Then we heard it again. We ran
down the hallway it was coming from.We checked every room and every patient.
Everyone was asleep. As soon as we returned to the nurses station we heard
it again,"Help!" Again we ran down and checked every room and every patient.
Still asleep. This continued for about one hour. While we were on the hall
we heard nothing,as soon as we left the hall the screams for help started
again. The next morning several of the patients reported hearing someone
yell for help during the night and wondered why we didn't help them. What
else could we say but "We couldn't find them</b>

<br><b>No-One was There</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hull@quality-living.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>Our names are Alex and Richard and we work at the quality living
leisure centre. There have always been stories about funny goings on as
we are attached to a hotel. These stories date back years as the hotel
got burnt down and was rebuilt.</b>
<br><b>The hotel is rumoured to have a selection of resident ghosts some
of which are notorious pranksters who like to play tricks on residents,
others have just been seen walking down corridors and floating in and out
of mirrors. Probably the most alarming sightings are those of small children
playing with wooden toy trains in and around certain areas of the stairs
and corridors. Residents have on several occasions made comments to reception
staff about the children saying that they are dressed in old fashioned
clothing and that their is nobody looking after them.</b>
<br><b>But we are not talking about the hotel we are talking about the
leisure centre, which is located just across the car, but was added to
the hotel during the year of the fire. in the leisure centre their has
been several sightings of what is described as two young men dressed in
Victorian clothing these two are the most frequent visitors to the leisure
centre.</b>
<br><b>Many members of staff have heard funny noises after all the members
have left and they are cleaning up, such as keys jangling at poolside and
doors opening and closing.</b>
<br><b>There have been sightings by members and staff on a number of occasions
when cleaning the men's changing area. The most memorable was when I Alex
was waiting in the car park outside the leisure centre for Richard to turn
of the lights. He was walking along the corridor and there was a young
man walking slightly behind him as he came out I watched for the young
man, but he never came out. I told Richard he must have locked him in and
he said everyone was out.</b>
<br><b>We both went back in and locked the door behind us while we checked
everywhere, but no-one was there!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Accounts of my Haunted House</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: anonymous</b>
</p><p><b>&nbsp;With a gravel driveway, the house was painted yellow when I
lived there in</b>
<br><b>1982.&nbsp; At that time, I was a sophomore in HS, about&nbsp; 14
or 15, didn't</b>
<br><b>drink, do drugs and was a normal 15 year old kid.</b>
<br><b>The first night my family lived in the house, all the lights went
out in</b>
<br><b>the house except in the garage below the small attic and the attic.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>door to the small attic would slowly open with a creak and then
within a</b>
<br><b>minute, slam shut.</b>
<br><b>Often, when in the house and after standing still, I would get a
feeling</b>
<br><b>like someone cold was walking up behind me and putting their hand
right</b>
<br><b>over my shoulder.&nbsp; Quickly turning around would make the feeling
go away</b>
<br><b>then it would settle in again.&nbsp; Like someone was right behind
you and you</b>
<br><b>turn around and they are not there.</b>
<br><b>When eating dinner, the sound of someone bouncing a ball would be
heard</b>
<br><b>over our heads.&nbsp; Like when you drop a ping pong ball and it
quickly</b>
<br><b>speeds up its bouncing but this would go over several minutes.</b>
<br><b>Twice when entering the garage, a large rusty 3 inch nail fell out
of a</b>
<br><b>nailless, stucco ceiling, leveled out and zipped in front of me,
hitting</b>
<br><b>the garage divider, bouncing off a box and hit the floor with a
ping.</b>
<br><b>Then it disappeared.&nbsp; This happened to me twice and to my father
once,</b>
<br><b>but he was able to pick up the nail. The amazing thing was that
the nail</b>
<br><b>took exactly the same path both times it happened to me.&nbsp; There
was no hole in the ceiling left by the nail either.</b>
<br><b>A pattern was developing that only these things would happen to
men, not</b>
<br><b>women.&nbsp; I never figured out why until after I had moved out
of the house.</b>
<br><b>We had a yard man who lived in Wayne or Pontiac, Mich and was recently</b>
<br><b>unemployed from one of the car companies.&nbsp; Curious, I asked
him if he</b>
<br><b>noticed anything funny happening to him in the house.&nbsp; He denied
any odd</b>
<br><b>happenings until he was painting the room to the small attic and
the</b>
<br><b>radio station changed on him while he was listening to it.&nbsp;
After this</b>
<br><b>experience, he informed my mother that when we had any house work
he'd</b>
<br><b>call us, and not to call him.&nbsp; After a while he calmed down
but was</b>
<br><b>pretty shook up.</b>
<br><b>Twice while sleeping, odd things happened in my room.&nbsp; The
first was</b>
<br><b>reminiscent of the old pepto bismol commercials where the man in
the</b>
<br><b>commercial would bulge and wobble due to his discomfort.&nbsp; One
night, I</b>
<br><b>woke up in the middle of the night and saw my closet doors doing
this.</b>
<br><b>Realizing that there was nothing I could do to change it, I closed
my</b>
<br><b>eyes and went back to sleep.&nbsp; That to me, is a very strange
reaction and</b>
<br><b>after we left the house, we wondered if we were insane to live there
for</b>
<br><b>a year.</b>
<br><b>The second incident was a simple "there is someone walking in my
room".</b>
<br><b>I could hear footsteps and boards creaking as if someone was entering
my</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; There were no depressions in the carpet and only 3 audible
steps</b>
<br><b>were taken into my room.&nbsp; Again, I just went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>While playing on the lake ice with my friend Quigly and his dog,
we</b>
<br><b>decided to play at my house.&nbsp; I warned him that it was haunted
but we'd</b>
<br><b>make the best of it.&nbsp; When we approached the house, it took
some effort</b>
<br><b>to get the dog into the front yard but a taunting with a tennis
ball</b>
<br><b>eventually got the critter onto the grass.&nbsp; Finally able to
grab the</b>
<br><b>dog, we took him off the grass and onto the front porch where he
fought</b>
<br><b>against us strongly.&nbsp; From there, Kevin took the dog by the
collar and I</b>
<br><b>opened the front door.&nbsp; His dog froze, looked up the staircase
inside,</b>
<br><b>wimpered, backed off the foundation taking us with him and almost</b>
<br><b>dragged us off the lawn.&nbsp; We couldn't hold on and the dog just
stayed in</b>
<br><b>the street, never coming close to the house or the lawn.&nbsp; Baffled
and</b>
<br><b>not seeing any spectres, Kevin and I entered the house and got cookies.</b>
<br><b>After the cookie break, we went upstairs and as adolescents started</b>
<br><b>wrestling and beating each other up.&nbsp; While wrestling about
the room, we</b>
<br><b>fell on my solid pine bed and the bed snapped in half.&nbsp; Now,
I had that</b>
<br><b>bed for 12 years and it had taken a beating but it could have just</b>
<br><b>broken.&nbsp; Kind of embarrased, we both went downstairs and Kevin
left with</b>
<br><b>his dog.</b>
<br><b>I had another friend named Justin who had a beer can collection
like I</b>
<br><b>did.&nbsp; I kept mine in the small attic and therefore did not
go there</b>
<br><b>much.&nbsp; Knowing that if I invited Justin over, the ghost would
pay more</b>
<br><b>attention to someone new, I told him about the haunted house and
we went</b>
<br><b>over to check out my beer can collection.</b>
<br><b>Justin reacted rather well for the first ten minutes except that
I</b>
<br><b>didn't have ten minutes of beer cans to see.&nbsp; He often got
a surprised</b>
<br><b>look on his face and tried to brush something off his shoulder.&nbsp;
Three</b>
<br><b>times I asked him if he wanted to leave until he strongly told me
that</b>
<br><b>he would tell me when he wanted to go.&nbsp; He just walked back
and forth</b>
<br><b>between the same racks looking at the same cans.&nbsp; 3&nbsp; minutes
later, he</b>
<br><b>asked to leave.&nbsp; Going down the stairs, I asked him if he felt
the ghost</b>
<br><b>touching his back.&nbsp; Abruptly, he turned to me and without answering
my</b>
<br><b>question, told me never, EVER to take him back to that room again.</b>
<br><b>Years later, I described to him exactly what happened to him ( that</b>
<br><b>feeling from paragraph 3) and he was amazed that I was exactly right.</b>
<br><b>"Like you're walking down a deserted road with no one for thousands
of</b>
<br><b>miles and you know there is someone right behind you."&nbsp; Nonchalantly,
I</b>
<br><b>told him that I lived there for a year and was well accustomed to
the</b>
<br><b>feelings of that house.</b>
<br><b>When we moved to the house, we had a cat.&nbsp; The cat would normally
be a</b>
<br><b>"house cat" and stay around the house with a few late night jaunts.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>critter's behavior changed and it rarely spent time around the house
and</b>
<br><b>finally left.&nbsp; Don't really know why but animals did not seem
to like</b>
<br><b>this house.</b>
<br><b>The problems of living in that house were not shared with our</b>
<br><b>neighbors.&nbsp; Surprisingly, a neighbor from 3 houses up the block
would</b>
<br><b>ask me how I was doing and how things were going whenever he would
see</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; Only later, I would realize that he was asking me "are
you doing ok</b>
<br><b>in that haunted house?"</b>
<br><b>Once, my father and I entered the room next to the room that went
to the</b>
<br><b>small attic and felt a presence.&nbsp; We decided to lighten up
the</b>
<br><b>atmosphere and started paying attention to the ghost and actively</b>
<br><b>speaking about being nice to the ghost and maybe "take a ghost to</b>
<br><b>lunch."&nbsp; 1/2 hour after we started, without a word, we stopped.&nbsp;
An</b>
<br><b>ominous hostile nature hinting "stop NOW" was the general feeling
that</b>
<br><b>came about the room.&nbsp; During that time, the feeling on my back
could be</b>
<br><b>shrugged or wisked away with a brush of my hand.&nbsp; 1/2 hour
later, we</b>
<br><b>both got up and left.&nbsp; I asked my father who was an former
secret agent</b>
<br><b>and not a wimp, "let's never do that again."&nbsp; He quickly agreed.</b>
<br><b>Coincidentally, at the time that we lived in the house was when</b>
<br><b>Poltergeist was released to theatres.&nbsp; I definitely went to
see that</b>
<br><b>movie.</b>
<br><b>After a while, it was obvious to the family that I was having trouble</b>
<br><b>living in the house.&nbsp; Once I asked my dad if anything happened
to him</b>
<br><b>that he hadn't told me about.&nbsp; He recounted a story of a few
weeks</b>
<br><b>earlier where he was sitting on the porcelain throne and the wastepaper</b>
<br><b>basket flew across the room without his permission.</b>
<br><b>My definition of an area influenced by a poltergeist is if inanimate</b>
<br><b>objects fly around the room without you asking them to.</b>
<br><b>Up until that point, no one had seen our poltergeist and we were
set on</b>
<br><b>staying in that house because it was ours. It's just what you do.&nbsp;
Late</b>
<br><b>one night, I laid down to sleep for about 10 seconds and then suddenly</b>
<br><b>opened my eyes.&nbsp; What I saw could not exist in a three dimensional</b>
<br><b>world.&nbsp; In a period less than two seconds long, a gray object
entered my</b>
<br><b>room and flew up into the ceiling above it.&nbsp; I actually get
chills just</b>
<br><b>recounting this story.&nbsp; The object seemed to be a gray blob
with enough</b>
<br><b>"tv screen fuzz" so that is blended in with the background but was
still</b>
<br><b>visible.&nbsp; When it entered the room, it came in 4 to 6 feet
and went</b>
<br><b>straight up into the ceiling but entered at two separate points.
It did</b>
<br><b>not stretch, it did not visibly separate, it just entered the ceiling
at</b>
<br><b>two separate locations at the same time without deforming itself.</b>
<br><b>Slightly stunned, I realized that "I'd seen it" and that this was
not a</b>
<br><b>window reflection of car lights.&nbsp; Realizing that there was
nothing I</b>
<br><b>could do about it, I went to sleep and told my parents about it
the next</b>
<br><b>day.</b>
<br><b>However the final incident was the killer.&nbsp; I had left Justin,
my beer</b>
<br><b>can collecting friend's house across town where I had stayed while
my</b>
<br><b>parents were on vaca in Hilton Head.&nbsp; At the time I left, the
weather</b>
<br><b>was lovely and sunny.&nbsp; But in the driving 5 miles to our house,
the</b>
<br><b>weather turned sour and when we got to my house, large 40 foot trees</b>
<br><b>were moving like they were getting whipped around, the sky was gray
and</b>
<br><b>it just didn't make sense that the weather could change that much
in 5</b>
<br><b>miles.&nbsp; I have never seen anything else like it since.</b>
<br><b>Expecting to meet my parents, to my disappointment they were late
and I</b>
<br><b>was to face the house alone with this big storm brewing.&nbsp; Walking
up the</b>
<br><b>gravel driveway to the back of the house, I could swear the house
was</b>
<br><b>looking at me, I had to get inside, pass the door to the basement
and</b>
<br><b>then I'd be ok in the kitchen or dining room.&nbsp; Once inside,
and to my</b>
<br><b>horror, I found the same situation that had happened on my first
night</b>
<br><b>was happening now.&nbsp; The lights were out in the majority of
the house.</b>
<br><b>It figured that the lights in the kitchen would work since it was</b>
<br><b>directly below the room to the small attic.&nbsp; I tried the lights
in the</b>
<br><b>den.&nbsp; No dice.&nbsp; After 45 minutes and starting to panic,
I started to</b>
<br><b>feel the cold presence come up behind me and all I could do was
move</b>
<br><b>about the kitchen to get it away from me.&nbsp; If I left through
the dining</b>
<br><b>room, I would have to go out the front door and I know I would have</b>
<br><b>looked up the stairs to the second floor.&nbsp; Somehow, I was terrified
that</b>
<br><b>something was waiting up there and if I looked at it, it would be
game</b>
<br><b>over.&nbsp; I could go out a window in the kitchen but that was
too</b>
<br><b>difficult.&nbsp; The back door seemed like the only way out and
I would have</b>
<br><b>to go by the green door down to the basement, open one door and
then</b>
<br><b>push open another.&nbsp; It got darker, stormier and I got even
more scared.</b>
<br><b>At this point I realized that I could call the realtor because she
said</b>
<br><b>if there was any problem living in the house ( I suspected she knew</b>
<br><b>something but hey, I'm a strong kid).&nbsp; Almost in tears, I called
her and</b>
<br><b>told her the situation I was in - wind whipping around the house,
most</b>
<br><b>of the lights out, and some cold spirit trying to walk up behind
me</b>
<br><b>alone without my parents.&nbsp; Hanging up the phone, I ran towards
the back</b>
<br><b>door, expecting the cellar door to burst open.&nbsp; Fumbling with
the</b>
<br><b>internal door, I was able to pull it towards me and then I ran again
and</b>
<br><b>pushed the second back door open as I ran outside.</b>
<br><b>The sky was a more violent gray, wind whipping more fiercely and
I swore</b>
<br><b>the different windows of the house were looking at me but there
was</b>
<br><b>nothing I could do.&nbsp; Cold and wet, I went back inside after
15 minutes,</b>
<br><b>unsure why I went back inside the house.&nbsp; Inside, I yelled
at the spirit</b>
<br><b>to leave me alone, stop following me, I really don't know but I
was in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen for at least 2 hours before I heard my parents' car
pull up.</b>
<br><b>Next day, the electrician said that we had partial voltage coming
to the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; I asked him if that would have dimmed all of the lights
instead</b>
<br><b>of knocking half of them out in the house.&nbsp; In any case, we
moved soon</b>
<br><b>after that to a house in the subdivision below the south course
of the</b>
<br><b>Oakland Hill Golf Club.&nbsp; We had no bizarre occurrences like
in the</b>
<br><b>previous house and we all realized just how foolish it was to stay
in</b>
<br><b>the yellow house. We felt like as soon as we left, we wondered just
why</b>
<br><b>the hell we stayed there.&nbsp; It seemed like someone wanted us
to stay there</b>
<br><b>to act out its aggressions on.</b>
<br><b>Once I went back to Wing Lake Rd, and talked to the neighbor who
always</b>
<br><b>checked up on me. I asked him about the history of the house, if
anyone</b>
<br><b>died there or was buried in the backyard.&nbsp; He told me there
there was an</b>
<br><b>older couple that lived there and had a rough and violent relationship.</b>
<br><b>He told me that someone may have died or was murdered in the house.
I</b>
<br><b>remembered a small patch of what seemed like fish tank gravel at
the end</b>
<br><b>of the driveway and the solution occurred to me.&nbsp; "She's buried
at the</b>
<br><b>end of the driveway isn't she"&nbsp; I asked the neighbor.&nbsp;
"Yes, I think</b>
<br><b>she is"&nbsp; was his response.&nbsp; I had really wished that he
had told me this</b>
<br><b>before.</b>
<br><b>All I can come up with is that the older family that lived there
before</b>
<br><b>us, had lived an abusive life and no matter what happened, the wife</b>
<br><b>hated men.&nbsp; She took that to the grave with her and that grave
was on</b>
<br><b>the property.&nbsp; Her spirit was still in the house and influenced
us to</b>
<br><b>stay there while she took out her aggressions on all the men in
her</b>
<br><b>house.</b>
<br><b>As a result of living in that house, I have a new saying.&nbsp;
"You never</b>
<br><b>know what it's like unless you've lived through it yourself."</b>

<br><b>Madison Indiana Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hbeard@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>There is a graveyard in Madison Indiana that I visited once, with
a group of</b>
<br><b>friends. We love taking road trips and such when we get a chance,
and are</b>
<br><b>hoping to eventually visit all the places told about on Shadowlands
(that</b>
<br><b>aren&#8217;t businesses). The graveyard is off of a highway and down a
gravel</b>
<br><b>road. It is a beautiful cemetery, and (through the feelings I felt)
though</b>
<br><b>the &#8220;occupants&#8221; weren&#8217;t happy about us being there, they were at
peace in</b>
<br><b>general. We&#8217;re off to a good start, was my thoughts! The trail,
located at</b>
<br><b>the end of the gravel road, we went on seemed eerily dark (if you
turned off</b>
<br><b>your light, you couldn&#8217;t see your hand). Though it was a warm night
out I</b>
<br><b>was cold. I do not get cold, and when I do, I&#8217;ve already been to
the doctor</b>
<br><b>because I feel like I&#8217;m dying, or because it&#8217;s snowing out and I
&#8220;forgot&#8221; my</b>
<br><b>jacket at home. The trail, I am told, used to be a road, but the
left side</b>
<br><b>has a cliff right next to it, and pieces kept breaking off and falling,
so</b>
<br><b>they closed it to save money. It is almost a mile long, and is at
about a</b>
<br><b>45-degree angle upward. It hadn&#8217;t rained in awhile, nor had there
been any</b>
<br><b>strong winds, but there was water everywhere and tree branches left
and</b>
<br><b>right on the trail. After a few minutes, the trail was free of water
and</b>
<br><b>branches. It was beautiful there, but I couldn&#8217;t escape an eerie
feeling</b>
<br><b>that kept tickling at the back of my neck. The trail is relatively
smooth,</b>
<br><b>small cracks and crevices along the sides, so we were pretty surprised
when</b>
<br><b>my boyfriend got his foot caught in a small hole and almost broke
his ankle.</b>
<br><b>Then up ahead was a huge branch across the trail, the green leaves
a curtain</b>
<br><b>to what awaited on the other side. We walked over the branches and
through</b>
<br><b>the leaves and were greeted by the same eerie darkness. As we was
walking</b>
<br><b>along, it sounded like someone was throwing rocks or something down
the</b>
<br><b>cliff, because the sound followed us to the end of the trail. (My
friends</b>
<br><b>said it was just my imagination) We get to the clearing that was
at the top,</b>
<br><b>and I notice that there is now nature sounds. Crickets are chirping,
there&#8217;s</b>
<br><b>a little brook at the bottom of the cliff, and the sky is calm and
clear.</b>
<br><b>Now we get to go back down the trail so we can leave&#8230; No one trips,
no more</b>
<br><b>rocks that only I heard that were being thrown, the tree branches
we had to</b>
<br><b>climb through before was trampled down (the men said they had done
it, but</b>
<br><b>one was ahead of us and the other was with me) and my constant chill
is</b>
<br><b>gone. We get back to the car and as we are talking, I look at the
graveyard.</b>
<br><b>It was a beautiful view, and there were two gravestones I really
wanted to</b>
<br><b>look at, because they resembled beds. Beside them was a large, black
dog. It</b>
<br><b>was strange, because it was a well-lit area, but there was no light</b>
<br><b>reflecting off the dog&#8217;s eyes, making it seem as if he had no eyes.
I asked</b>
<br><b>my friend about it, but he said it was just the caretaker&#8217;s dog
or</b>
<br><b>something, maybe a graveyard dog, and went back to talking with
the others.</b>
<br><b>I watched the dog as it guarded the graves, and I looked down just
a moment</b>
<br><b>to turn off the flashlight I realized was still on. When I looked
back up,</b>
<br><b>the dog was gone.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted House across the Street</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>by Holli and Leah</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>It was the day of my sleep over and i invited most of my mates. My
mum and dad had gone away for the weekend and i was allowed a sleep over.
We was having a great time eating stuff playing games , you know the normal
stuff anyway we got on to the game DARES. Me and Leah got dared to go in
the house across the road, no one had been living in it for years. This
house it wasn't your ordinary&nbsp; house it was creepy, spooky and really
really dull. We did it anyway because we wasn't been a chicken. As we walked
though the dark corridor of the house we both got a chill up our spines
we knew this wasn't a good idea but we wasn't giving up. We had to go in
every room even the attic. We had been in every room but not the attic,
we was really scared at this moment in time. We entered the attic room
, we started to look around then we saw it, we didn't know What it was
or who it was. We think it was an outline of a woman then we there was
a sharp scream. ARRHH. Leah grabbed me and we started to cry, the shock
, the horror, we ran oh yes we ran. We didn't know what to tell the others
because we knew they wouldn't believe us. Anyway they did, we did some
research about the outline we saw. The story is that a woman used to live
there and she didn't want to be disturbed.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Harpers Ferry WV</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: maryknaus@backpacker.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>my story is really cool, i was scared at the time but i love telling
it because it is very true. believe it or not...</b>
<br><b>anyhoo, my dad's side of the family always meets annually for a
"family reunion". this past year, in january of 2003, we decided to all
meet up at my cousin bevin's place, which is located near charlestown,
wv. it is a place called "claymont" and it is all land that was once owned
by our country's finest! george washington's old mansion is on the property,
and that is JUST where we decided to stay. it is a large, old mansion that
was probably built in the 1700's, very old and very cool. there are a bunch
of run-down barns and broken-down buildings on the property-- but there
are about 10 people who actually live year round on the property in pretty
decent houses (my cousin bevin being one of them...) it is the classic
set-up for a "haunted house" story, an old mansion in the middle of land
on which civil war battles were fought. many people died on that land!</b>
<br><b>one day on our vacation, we all decided to go to harper's ferry,
which is an historic old town located where the potomac and shenendoah
rivers meet...also it is literally ON the appalachain trail. it also happens
to be the location where the famous john brown raid happened. i have heard
that this town is haunted, but of course did not believe it. i work for
an outdoor equipment company and saw this "harper's ferry oufitter" store
on one of the main roads. i decided to stop in and see what they had. there
were other stores across the street, with what looked like old apartments
above them. as i was walking into the store, i heard a whistle (like the
kind of whistle someone does to let you know you are really really good
looking ;) and i swung around to see who did it. i looked up at one of
the old apartment buildings and saw a figure in the shutters, just standing
there staring at me. it appeared to be a middle-aged man, and he didn't
look old-fashioned or anything. just wearing some old bibs and a white,
dirty shirt. i shrugged it off and went into the store. i got to talking
to the owner of the store and asked her what it costs to live in those
apartments across the street. "nobody lives in those apartments, they are
simply historic buildings that are ornamental..." i told her what i saw,
and we walked outside only to see that the shutters i was looking at before
were shut. not only shut, but they looked pretty good and sealed up. she
explained that a lot of people see ghosts, since it is the sight of many
many deaths. there is even a civil war battlefield right in harpers ferry!
i was totally happy and excited to have seen my first ghost!</b>
<br><b>we went back to the mansion and my sister mentioned that she thought
she saw a ghost across the river at an old grainery-type of structure...</b>
<br><b>later that night, my cousins and i were all boozing and playing
cards. i decided that i had to use the restroom, and my cousin told me
the closest bathroom was down in the basement. so, i got up and started
heading down the stairs when the door that i had just passed through slammed
REALLY hard right behind me. i was back up there in .2 seconds to see who
the culprit was, but there was nobody there. when i touched the doorknob,
it was ICE cold, very very very freaked out was i. so i forgot that i had
to go to the bathroom and ran back into the dining room where everyone
was sitting. i asked who did it, and they all said, very honestly, that
they did not do it. my cousin bevin said it was probably a pressure change
in the house that caused the door to slam, but i was still freaked. i asked
my sister to come down to the restroom with me and as we were walking down
the stairs, the door slammed again! this time, i had a witness! we decided
to ignore it and go to the bathroom. when we came back up, again, the doorknob
was frozen, and this other door, that was sealed shut, was open. i asked
bevin what that door led to, and she said it led to the old slave's servant's
quarters...but it is totally sealed SHUT. i told her it was open and she
simply said "bullsh*t"! i grabbed her by the hand and brought her back
to that spot and the door was totally shut and sealed...my sister can vouche
for me on this one, that darn door was open and it was FREEZING in there.
i dared not go in...i'm not stupid! hehehehe.</b>
<br><b>so, everyone decided to hit the sack and i stayed afterwards a second
to clean up some of the beer bottles and organize the cards. then went
to sleep. i woke up the next morning to the sound of my mom yelling that
we made too much of a mess! i ran downstairs to where i had previously
(the night before) cleaned up, and there were beer bottles everywhere (some
broken) and the playing cards were scattered everywhere!!!! we all said
that we didn't do it...i said that the ghosts did it (which wasn't a good
idea because a bunch of my cousin's kids and my nephew were in the room).
anyhoo, it was freaky to say the least, but i LOVED that place. we went
to play nightgames the next night in the huge apple orchard in the backyard.
we had soooo much fun scaring eachother and feeling all of the other presences
around...</b>
<br><b>so, west virginia has a bunch of blood and history on it's land...and
that area of it-- i believe to be haunted.</b><b></b>

<p><b>George</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>By: GloriaM543@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
</p><p><b>Here is a long story and yes it is all true.&nbsp; It started when
my family and I moved to a house in Moriarty NM.&nbsp; a small town.&nbsp;
My parents never did have the pleasure of meeting or see our permanent
resident.&nbsp; It was about 9 years ago, I was 16, my sisters Dawn&nbsp;
was 17, Denise was 14 years old.&nbsp; we were watching TV in the living
room, while our parents were at work.&nbsp; we were playing and running
around the house after a while and saw a man shadow pass the livingroom
window (the sun would reflect onto the wall in the dining room)&nbsp; we
thought it was our parents to we went to the door and no one was there.&nbsp;
Thinking nothing of it we ignored it.&nbsp; It would happen a couple of
times through out the months we could make out the figure was a man so
we named him George.&nbsp; Then we really took to notice the things that
would happen, the dogs (there were 3) would bark for no reason, things
would be moved.&nbsp; But this would only happen when our parents were
not home.</b>
<br><b>Now okay being teenage girls with our parents out of town for the
weekend (almost every weekend) yes we had a lot of parties.&nbsp; We would
have the parties inside but after a couple of months later our friends
at school would tell us that about experiences that happened to them while
there.&nbsp; We realized that the stories they would tell us weren't lie
because it would happen to us.&nbsp; One night me and Dawn were home with
her boyfriend Jason in the kitchen sitting down and the table talking I
went to refill my glass of water, I put my glass on the counter and went
to the refrigerator to get the pitcher and the glass was on the other counter
I thought at first it was dawn playing around so i ignored her. then when
dawn had left to the dining room and Jason to the living room I turned
around to get a napkin the glass was moved again. And no one was around.&nbsp;
I told dawn and she just looked at me.</b>
<br><b>The second time something weird happened was when my nephew Steven
was about 2 years old and we (Dawn, Steven and I) were listening to music
in my room. We were the only ones home and Steven was dancing all of a
sudden he turned to face the window stopped dancing and waved smiling at
someone there. me and dawn didn't see anyone there.</b>
<br><b>Now the most freaky experience I had was about 3 years later and
I was with my daughter and boyfriend.&nbsp; it was around 9-10 at night
we were sleeping in my room. my boyfriend Charles was already asleep, I
was almost sleeping when our daughter (who was 2 1/2 years old) was calling
to me "momma...Momma"&nbsp; she was in our bed next to me (we were in one
bed) I thought she was talking in her sleep I didn't even bother to open
my eyes thinking of this.&nbsp; I asked her "what?" then when she asked
"Who is that man?"&nbsp; I opened my eyes, looked at her with her eyes
opened pointing to the corner of the room (o- my bedroom door was closed)
I started to freak...I asked her calmly "Do you see a man?"&nbsp; Yes,
she said, I asked her" what does he look like?"&nbsp; She told me "he's
right there" I told her "o- honey that's just George" she told me okay
and went to bed. I woke up Charles and told him to hold me because our
daughter just saw George.</b>
<br><b>We now that he is still around.&nbsp; He is a nice guy, just likes
to play trick every now and then.&nbsp; Sometimes me and my sister come
to visit our parents here and help them take care of the animal while they
are out of town.&nbsp; If we feel something in the room or notice anything
from the corner of our eyes and look over in that direction and nothing
is there we just say "hello George " and continue with what we were doing.</b>

<br><b>Columbus- The Railroad bridge experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hbeard@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
</p><p><b>About two and a half years ago, I went to the rail bridge with two
of my</b>
<br><b>friends, one of them my very best friend who I would trust with
my life,</b>
<br><b>even if she does lose her keys three or four times a day. Neither
one of</b>
<br><b>them even hinted at there being any type of story about it, not
even a</b>
<br><b>&#8220;happy&#8221; ghost story, because things like that freaked me out at
the time</b>
<br><b>(pregnancy hormones I guess). I was about four or five months pregnant
at</b>
<br><b>the time, and navigating the trail was not easy, because it was
dark and you</b>
<br><b>try stuffing a basketball up your shirt and walk on a railroad!!!
Along the</b>
<br><b>way, I felt like someone kept caressing my arm, but I thought it
was just my</b>
<br><b>imagination, so I didn&#8217;t let on I really was scared. One thing that
stands</b>
<br><b>out in my mind is one friend stopping and shining his flashlight
on a tree.</b>
<br><b>Lying on a branch was something that looked like a dehydrated squirrel.
It</b>
<br><b>had the bushy tail, and dry eye sockets, scary looking teeth as
only evil</b>
<br><b>squirrels have, and there were no cuts of any kind to show it had
been&#8230;</b>
<br><b>&#8220;emptied&#8221; if you will.&nbsp; At this point I really don&#8217;t want to
stay, but the</b>
<br><b>Bridge is just up ahead (so they said, it was too foggy just in
that spot</b>
<br><b>too see ahead or behind us) and I felt safe because we all had a
weapon of</b>
<br><b>some sort. I had my pepper spray and a knife, my female friend had
a knife,</b>
<br><b>and my male friend doesn&#8217;t leave the house without at least 3 or
4 knives,</b>
<br><b>not including the one sewn into the lining of his duster and not
including</b>
<br><b>the other &#8220;toys&#8221; he takes out to play with in the woods. So we&#8217;re
safe,</b>
<br><b>right? About two minutes later, the fog is absolutely gone and the
bridge is</b>
<br><b>right there in front of me, like it appeared out of nowhere. My
male friend</b>
<br><b>walked across the bridge carefully, (there is planks missing) and
came</b>
<br><b>running back about a minute later, saying we needed to leave immediately.
He</b>
<br><b>walked behind us, a knife in one hand and a flashlight sweeping
the area in</b>
<br><b>the other. Even pregnant and walking on the rails, I was able to
keep up</b>
<br><b>with my female friend. When we finally made it to the clearing,
I snuck a</b>
<br><b>look back. Right off to the side of the rails, hidden in the shrubs,
was</b>
<br><b>bright yellow eyes staring back at
me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
About four or five</b>
<br><b>months ago, I was told about this website and was able to read the
story</b>
<br><b>behind the rail bridge.</b>
