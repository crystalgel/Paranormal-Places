<p><b>&nbsp;A Knack for Finding Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: brandeew@pacbell.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have so many "ghosts stories", I seem to have a knack for finding
them, or</b>
<br><b>perhaps they have a knack for finding me.&nbsp; In any case, the
easiest way to</b>
<br><b>tell my tales is start in the present and work&nbsp; my way back
in time.</b>
<br><b>I currently live in a Victorian house built in the late 1800's in
San</b>
<br><b>Francisco.&nbsp; This house has a long and varied history and has
been converted</b>
<br><b>from a single family home, to apartments during WWI and WWII, to
a crash pad</b>
<br><b>in the 60's, to one of the largest drug trafficking houses in the
80's, and</b>
<br><b>finally to two flats as it is now.</b>
<br><b>I have known this place was haunted since the day I moved in eight
years</b>
<br><b>ago.&nbsp; At first, there were only the tell-tale "mysterious"
sounds and</b>
<br><b>footsteps that I have been accustomed to my whole life, regardless
of my</b>
<br><b>surroundings.</b>
<br><b>A year after moving here, I had a vision - someone was being dragged
across</b>
<br><b>the floor of the kitchen area, leaving a trail of dark liquid in
its wake.</b>
<br><b>The image faded out (for lack of a better description) as soon as
I was able</b>
<br><b>to focus on it.&nbsp; I was able to make out two forms though, both
definitely</b>
<br><b>human.</b>
<br><b>I never had a sighting quite as strong as this was, but on a *daily*
basis I</b>
<br><b>catch out of a corner of my eye something (someone?) moving back
and forth</b>
<br><b>down the hallway.&nbsp; I am very used to it now as it is so commonplace.</b>
<br><b>My fianc&eacute; has never been one to believe in ghosts, and would
scoff at my</b>
<br><b>insistence that our flat is haunted.&nbsp; Two months ago while
eating dinner, he</b>
<br><b>dropped his fork mid-bite and spun around to look behind him.&nbsp;
I had to prod</b>
<br><b>to get him to tell me what was wrong, but he finally admitted that
he had</b>
<br><b>seen someone come up behind him in the reflection from the darkened
window</b>
<br><b>he was facing.&nbsp; All I could do was smile and say "I told you
so".</b>
<br><b>Recently, we had a new flat mate move in.&nbsp; Within three days
of her moving</b>
<br><b>here, she asked if I knew that the place was haunted.&nbsp; Our
ghosts are not</b>
<br><b>shy in letting their presence be known.&nbsp; She now has seen them
wandering the</b>
<br><b>halls and will often hear them walking around as well.</b>
<br><b>Before I moved into the Victorian, I lived in a flat in the Outer
Sunset</b>
<br><b>district of San Francisco.&nbsp; I don't know the history of that
house, but I</b>
<br><b>had some interesting experiences there are well.</b>
<br><b>I was 19 when I moved into this house with my best friend who had
moved up</b>
<br><b>here with me from Los Angeles.&nbsp; The night we moved in, we heard
a strange</b>
<br><b>sound coming from the bathroom.&nbsp; It sounded as if someone was
scrubbing the</b>
<br><b>tiles with a brush; a rhythmic *scuff scuff scuffscuff* sound.</b>
<br><b>We sat on the couch terrified.&nbsp; This was our first time out
of our families</b>
<br><b>homes and the first though was that it was an intruder.&nbsp; We
looked at each</b>
<br><b>other, and tried to think of what it could be.&nbsp; We even went
so far as to</b>
<br><b>think maybe a rat had crawled up the drain pipe into the shower.&nbsp;
We finally</b>
<br><b>worked up the nerve to venture into the bathroom to have a look,
holding</b>
<br><b>onto each other.&nbsp; I think we had armed ourselves with a shoe
and a broom -</b>
<br><b>really funny to look back on it now, but it was really scary at
the time.</b>
<br><b>As soon as we flicked the lights on in the bathroom, the sound stopped,
and</b>
<br><b>of course nothing was in there.</b>
<br><b>That house had a lot of misplaced items, mysteriously opened doors,
and</b>
<br><b>footsteps as well.</b>
<br><b>I also had the experience of waking up in the middle of the night
to find a</b>
<br><b>dark shrouded figure standing over me.&nbsp; The first time it happened,
I got</b>
<br><b>the distinct feeling that the presence was male, and was not "good".&nbsp;
He was</b>
<br><b>simply standing next to my bed looking down at me.</b>
<br><b>The second time this happened, I awoke gasping for breath.&nbsp;
I felt a great</b>
<br><b>weight pressing down on my chest and an almost cool, but minty feeling
over</b>
<br><b>my whole body.&nbsp; This time, the figure was over my body, and
I felt as if it</b>
<br><b>was female.&nbsp; When I was fully awake, and the presence had gone,
all I could</b>
<br><b>do was cry.&nbsp; I still don't know why I had that reaction.</b>
<br><b>The final thing that happened in that house, about a month prior
to us</b>
<br><b>moving out, happened late one night as we were leaving to go to
a club.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>had a third roommate by that time, and my friend and I were down
at the car</b>
<br><b>waiting for her to come out.&nbsp; We both looked up into our second
story living</b>
<br><b>room window and saw the roommate looking down at us.&nbsp; Almost
simultaneously,</b>
<br><b>my friend and I yelled up to the roommate to hurry up.&nbsp; It
was then that we</b>
<br><b>realized that the roommate had already exited the house and was
in the</b>
<br><b>driveway.</b>
<br><b>It is occasions such as that one, when you have someone next to
you who has</b>
<br><b>seen and heard the same things that make you realize you aren't
crazy, you</b>
<br><b>don't have an active imagination.&nbsp; It is confirmation that
something other</b>
<br><b>worldly has just taken place in your presence.</b>
<br><b>The house I spent the majority of my childhood in (from about six
until I</b>
<br><b>was 16 or 17) belonged to my grandparents prior to my family moving
in.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have memories of before we moved in of my grandmother using the
Ouija board.</b>
<br><b>She used to write poetry from what the board told her.&nbsp; I have
recently</b>
<br><b>learned that my younger brother got a hold of that board and had
many scary</b>
<br><b>encounters with it when he was in his early teens.&nbsp; In fact,
he recently</b>
<br><b>shared with me that he had such negative (of course, I would label
it</b>
<br><b>powerful from what he has said, not negative) experiences, that
he and his</b>
<br><b>friends had a bon fire and threw the board in.</b>
<br><b>In any case, my memories of what happened in that house are vague.&nbsp;
I do</b>
<br><b>have a very clear recollection of feeling a presence in the house,
going</b>
<br><b>into my bedroom, and sitting in front of a mirror calling to something.&nbsp;
A</b>
<br><b>presence manifested itself in the reflection as a blue shining light,
and</b>
<br><b>was gone as soon as it came.</b>
<br><b>I have memories of not liking the stairway AT ALL.&nbsp; I would
not go up and</b>
<br><b>down the stairs there without something over my head (a coat, a
laundry</b>
<br><b>basket.. whatever was handy).</b>
<br><b>Some years ago, my brother and my cousins and I were sitting around
after</b>
<br><b>Thanksgiving Dinner talking about that house.&nbsp; We had never
shared our</b>
<br><b>experiences about that house and ghosts before.&nbsp; As it turns
out, we all</b>
<br><b>hated the stairs and had different strategies about how to navigate
them</b>
<br><b>safely.&nbsp; For instance, my brother would "crawl" up the stairs,
kicking his</b>
<br><b>leg behind him to stop from being followed.&nbsp; My cousins would
only go up the</b>
<br><b>stairs while holding each others hands.</b>
<br><b>Although it is his tale to tell, my brother also shared at that
discussion</b>
<br><b>that he and an (adult) uncle of ours had distinctly seen a couple
"waltz"</b>
<br><b>across the living room, and disappear through a wall.&nbsp; They
just looked at</b>
<br><b>each other and never mentioned it to anyone, until the night of
the</b>
<br><b>discussion.</b>
<br><b>It also came out that night that our grandmother (the one with the
ouija</b>
<br><b>board) had visited us (the cousins, my brother and I) in our dreams
around</b>
<br><b>the same time, or at least, as far as we could tell, it was about
the same</b>
<br><b>time as it was recent to that discussion.&nbsp; We each told the
exact same</b>
<br><b>story.&nbsp; In the dream, Gramma came and sat on our bed. She was
wearing a blue</b>
<br><b>and green flowered dress.&nbsp; She told us that she loved us, and
was watching</b>
<br><b>after us, and that she was proud of us.</b>
<br><b>There are more stories of that house, but they are not my own...</b>
<br><b>I am moving again next month.&nbsp; I wonder if I will be able to
add to my</b>
<br><b>collection of tales</b>

<p><b>Ambassador Hotel L.A. CA.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BAYRIDGITE@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In August of 2002, we where shooting an episode of the "Power Rangers,"
at night at the Ambassador Hotel.&nbsp; Trust me when I say, that place
is haunted.&nbsp; While I am not a psychic, that place has an aura that
cannot be denied.&nbsp; During the four nights that we where there I had
several minor incidences that seem trivial, however when you put them together
they add up to a very strange experience.&nbsp; The one thing that really
freaked me out was a dream I had while dozing off in my van.&nbsp; I was
not quite asleep when I dreamed I was shot just behind my left ear, (R.
F. K.&nbsp; was shot in the right side) I felt the the hair blow away in
a circular pattern as the bullet made its impact.&nbsp; I then felt such
a sense of peace, I was afraid that if I didn't wake up instantly I would
be gone for good.&nbsp; I have never had a dream like this before and the
details of it defy the imagination.&nbsp; I would really like to see someone
do some kind of seance there.</b>

<p><b>Banks Middle School --aka Banks High</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: oden_d@bellsouth.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I was a student at Banks in the early 80's, when it was still a
high school. There were more than one strange place in that school. The
band room that was&nbsp; in the section known as "G" at the far end of
the school had some strange things to happen.</b>
<br><b>Music would disappear only to show up in the uniform room. There
would be strange noises that would come from the instrument storage room
when there would not be anyone in there.</b>
<br><b>When we would have band practice after school no one would stay
in the band room by themselves they would either stay outside with other
people or they would wait until there was a bunch of folks going in.</b>
<br><b>The day that I had my ghostly encounter was the day before homecoming
one year. I had to check out to go to the dentist, and I needed to get
my flute from the locker in the band room, as I was getting the combination
started on the locker there was a strange scratching sound coming from
the closet behind me. It did not sound like a rat or a small animal it
sounded like someone was scratching on the door with their nails. The hair
on my neck started to prickle and then there was a sudden cold that came
over me. I&nbsp; grabbed my flute and slammed the locker door shut, and
the scratching stopped. But the cold lingered in the air.(And any one from
the south will tell you</b>
<br><b>that it is still hot here clear on up to December)</b>
<br><b>A friend of mine was coming in the door just&nbsp; as I was leaving
and she said that I was pale and asked what was the problem and all I could
tell her was that she wouldn't</b>
<br><b>believe me if I told her.</b>
<br><b>The other place that has some strange vibes to it is the main building
where the stage and the dressing rooms are.</b>
<br><b>My sister is a few years older than me and she was in a play and
I had to go and sit through rehearsals as she was my ride home. I would
wonder around the back stage</b>
<br><b>area and into the dressing rooms and where they had old props and
costumes stored. The drama teacher Mrs. J&nbsp; was cool with it, cause
she would get me to look for stuff that they could use for the play.</b>
<br><b>One day I decided to go sit in the balcony and just listen to the
rehearsal. From there you could get a real good look into the wings when
the curtains were all the way open. There is a hall that runs on the right
side of the stage that leads to the dressing room. I saw a girl dressed
up in a early 1900's dress. I know that it was not from the</b>
<br><b>play that my sister was in because they were doing M*A*S*H.</b>
<br><b>I took off down the stairs to warn who ever it was that they were
in the wrong costume, that they were supposed to be in fatigues. I never
did find them.</b>
<br><b>When I asked Mrs. J. about it she didn't know what I was talking
about. When I described to her what I saw she just laughed and said that
I had seen "the lady".</b>
<br><b>I never did find out who or why "the lady" was seen at Banks.</b>
<br><b>There were only a few sightings at Banks of the "lady" while I was
there. I moved away in my jr. year and I didn't keep in touch.</b>
<br><b>I don't know if she is still there or not.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hospital Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: 4676357@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in a small town in Florida, I work at a hospital as a nurse
there, we have many stories, but the one that seems to stick out in everyone
thoughts is about the nurse all in white and dark black hair, we had a
patient who bedbound and who could not take care of him self without help,
everytime the cna would pass the room the patient was in there would be
a pad by the door, the cna would pick it up and not think anything of it
and put it in the right place, but about the 3rd ot 4th time the cna asked
the patient who has been changing him all night, the patient told her it
was the nurse, when the cna asked the nurse the nurse replied that she
has not changed the patient she thought that the cna was doing it, the
cna then went back into the patients room and asked which nurse was coming
in to help him, he said the nurse in all white a dress with the darkest
black hair but there was noone in the hospital as a nurse that fit that
figure he was talking about ever since that this mystery nurse has helped
when needed, we even a nurse in the hallway she a nurse in a white dress
with dark hair then dissapeared, thought it was a neat story, i truely
believe, hope you enjoyed it</b>

<p><b>Little Girl's Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: paredesr@lisd.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>One of our friends grandfather owns some land behind where we live
in</b>
<br><b>Texas, so sometimes when we wanted to get away where we couldn't
be</b>
<br><b>found we would go back there to do whatever we wanted.&nbsp; After
a while,</b>
<br><b>our friends built a little shed for us to sit at, but one day it</b>
<br><b>accidently caught on fire so last summer we started walking into
a small</b>
<br><b>wooded area right off the property and found a very old house that</b>
<br><b>couldn't be seen at all from the road.&nbsp; So we decided to sort
of fix it</b>
<br><b>up and make it ours.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Well we didn't know much about the house but we helped them
clean it</b>
<br><b>up. Since we us girls hadn't really seen it we didn't know what
to</b>
<br><b>expect. It was a small house(one bedroom, one bathroom, a closet,
and a</b>
<br><b>kitchen). But we started noticing all the "DO NOT CROSS" tape around
the</b>
<br><b>house in the trees so we asked our friends about it and they really</b>
<br><b>didn't say much. Well after about a week we sort of had our own
little</b>
<br><b>party there, we were all drinking, but after a while some of us
left,</b>
<br><b>since we just lived a walking distance. Well after most of our friends</b>
<br><b>left, we were at the houe sort of passing out on the couches. It
was me,</b>
<br><b>my sister, 2 of our friends that were still awake with with us,
and 2</b>
<br><b>that were completey passed out on the couch across from us. We were
all</b>
<br><b>siting on the couch next to the door, blocking the one of the windows,
I</b>
<br><b>was siting right infront of the window.&nbsp; Well after a while,
I heard a</b>
<br><b>little girl say really, really loud "HELP ME!" I got so scared I
jumped</b>
<br><b>up and asked did anyone else hear that or was that just me. But
just</b>
<br><b>like I thought everyone else heard that. In the beginning we thought
it</b>
<br><b>was one of our friends that had left home and maybe came back without
us</b>
<br><b>noticing, trying to mess around, but once we heard some other noise
our</b>
<br><b>friends went to go look, and no one was there. We all got really
scared.</b>
<br><b>A couple minutes passed by and our friends that had left came back
to</b>
<br><b>take us home so that we didn't have to walk home. But when I asked
him</b>
<br><b>about it he wouldn't admit to it, so I got mad and I screamed at
him and</b>
<br><b>I left. The next day when I told my other friends about it they
said it</b>
<br><b>couldn't have been him just playing around because they were with
him</b>
<br><b>the whole time. Also, when I started to think about it it couldn't
have</b>
<br><b>been him or anyone because the house is surrounded by twigs and
leafs we</b>
<br><b>would have heard walking around the house and we didn't hear anything
at</b>
<br><b>all. The next week, our friends finally told us that once while
they</b>
<br><b>were at the house a couple came and asked if they could burry their</b>
<br><b>daughter on their property because she had died. That freaked us
out</b>
<br><b>even more. Sometimes they even hear someone walking around the house
and</b>
<br><b>giggling or running around. Other times they hear some one walking</b>
<br><b>around the outside and then someones bangs on one of the walls very</b>
<br><b>loudly, but no one has ever stayed pasted the loud bang.</b>

<p><b>I'm Not Alone Anymore</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lady_thorn2002@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have recently began viewing this site and reading the stories that
various</b>
<br><b>people have sent in and I decided that I would like to share my
own</b>
<br><b>experiences as well. The stories I have read have their own titles,
so I</b>
<br><b>assume I must come up with my own as well. I think something along
the lines</b>
<br><b>of “I’m Not Alone Anymore” because I usually felt very lonely in
my</b>
<br><b>childhood, but the spirits that came around made me feel like I
wasn't</b>
<br><b>really alone. I will describe these occurnces to the best of my
ability and</b>
<br><b>in the other that they happened.</b>
<br><b>When I was no more than 5 years old, my family lived in a small
house in an</b>
<br><b>area that was very secluded and quite a ways out from town. I don’t
recall</b>
<br><b>how far away we were from any civilization, because I was only a
child. I</b>
<br><b>remember my older brother, Keith, looking at the house and saying,
“We could</b>
<br><b>be murdered out here and no one would ever know!” That one thought
made me</b>
<br><b>quite uneasy, though at the time I wasn’t overly sure why. As my
family made</b>
<br><b>their way to the front door, my sister (Jen) and I were having a
look around</b>
<br><b>the outside to decide if the fields would be a worthy play place,
and that’s</b>
<br><b>when we saw a little boy run behind the house. We of course became
curious</b>
<br><b>and decided to have a look because no one lived around for miles
and we</b>
<br><b>wanted to know how a boy could possibly have been there with no
one else</b>
<br><b>around, save for our family. Naturally, we didn’t find him, and
turned to</b>
<br><b>join the others. Everyone was already inside, so Jen and I had to
fuss with</b>
<br><b>the door, because it wouldn’t open. My father heard us trying to
get in and</b>
<br><b>helped us open the door. This house was fairly old, its age I don’t</b>
<br><b>remember, but it was definitely before the good flooring because
right in</b>
<br><b>front of the door was a good sized bump. The door had to be lifted
a little</b>
<br><b>and pulled over it, but given some time and practice it became a
second</b>
<br><b>nature. Our arrival must have stirred the spirits because things
began that</b>
<br><b>very night. Around midnight (typical things would begin around that
time) we</b>
<br><b>all woke to the sounds of pigs squealing and trotting around in
the pen</b>
<br><b>outside. We didn’t own any pigs and when looking out the window
we saw</b>
<br><b>nothing, however, the sounds continued. This happened every night
and would</b>
<br><b>end with the sound of an axe ending the pigs’ cries, but once again,
nothing</b>
<br><b>could be seen. In the morning, my father asked if any of us had
been outside</b>
<br><b>during the night or early morning. All of us had been too frightened
to go</b>
<br><b>outside, or even to leave our rooms until the sun came up. Apparently
(my</b>
<br><b>father was always the first to wake up) he had found the door wide
open, and</b>
<br><b>had found it that way many mornings afterwards. After living in
the house</b>
<br><b>for about a month, my father and brothers (Keith and Jason) were</b>
<br><b>investigating a strange chill house that seemed to come from below
the</b>
<br><b>house. After digging up some dirt and exploring the underneath of
the porch,</b>
<br><b>Jason came bolting out saying that he had found some a skeleton
that looked</b>
<br><b>like it belonged to a child. I knew then that it must have been
the little</b>
<br><b>boy. They removed the skeleton, which was a mistake. That night
things</b>
<br><b>became far worse then they had been before. The pigs were now visible,</b>
<br><b>though the wielder of the axe still could not be seen, the front
door had</b>
<br><b>begun to open and slam shut relentlessly through the night, and
the little</b>
<br><b>boy came to pay my siblings and me a visit. He had a sad face and
a</b>
<br><b>depressing feeling to him, he just sat in the middle of our bedroom
floor</b>
<br><b>(Keith, Jen and Jason all shared a room with me) and he started
to cry.</b>
<br><b>Jason asked if the boy was ok, and he just looked at him, making
him cry a</b>
<br><b>little as well. Jay got up to go over to the boy, but as soon as
he was too</b>
<br><b>close, the boy disappeared, but the sound of his crying remained
with us the</b>
<br><b>rest of the night. My parents didn’t wasn’t to stay in the house
(no one was</b>
<br><b>getting any sleep) so we moved back to the city. After that night,
Jason</b>
<br><b>felt guilty for leaving the boy, so he looked into the history of
the house.</b>
<br><b>The police were very helpful and told him that the house used to
be a pig</b>
<br><b>farm and that no one had lived there since the last family moved
out 20</b>
<br><b>years before. They had been called to do a search, but found nothing.
The</b>
<br><b>family moved out once they believed their son would never come back;
they</b>
<br><b>didn’t know that he did come back, and repeated to do so every night
looking</b>
<br><b>for them. My father hadn’t gotten rid of the bones (not that he
hadn’t</b>
<br><b>tried) but they kept returning, so when we got this information,
we still</b>
<br><b>had the boys’ skeleton. We buried him with his family in a nearby
cemetery</b>
<br><b>the next day and he never visited again.</b>
<br><b>Another sighting came when I was 8 years old. I went to a camp for
about a</b>
<br><b>week, nothing odd about that except I hated the outdoors and my
family made</b>
<br><b>me go. I was put in one of the younger girls cabins and then my
nightmare</b>
<br><b>began. Everything was fine until my final night at the camp, there
was a</b>
<br><b>storm. It was a very strong storm; wind, rain, thunder and lightning.
I love</b>
<br><b>storms like this and I was really enjoying myself until I felt the
odd</b>
<br><b>sensation of someone watching me. I am sensitive to that feeling,
so it</b>
<br><b>didn’t occur to me that it wasn’t out of the ordinary until I rolled
over to</b>
<br><b>find a mist in the middle of the room. The other girls obviously
felt</b>
<br><b>something odd and began to wake up, the apparition, of course, disappeared.</b>
<br><b>Once everyone had gone back to sleep (I was the only one who saw
it) I felt</b>
<br><b>the sensation again, only it was on the other side of me, the side
that was</b>
<br><b>against a wall … and a window. I looked out the window to see a
girl that</b>
<br><b>looked no older than I was, but she was no longer watching me, she
was</b>
<br><b>floating away. Ever since my first encounter, I had loved ghosts,
and I</b>
<br><b>wanted to see if I could help (not always a smart thing to do).
I followed</b>
<br><b>the girl down to the docks, but because of the time of night, the
tides were</b>
<br><b>rising, she had led me into the water and she wasn’t letting me
leave.</b>
<br><b>Fortunately, Jason, who was a camp counselor, had seen me go down
there and</b>
<br><b>had rushed over. He usually patrolled by the docks at night to make
sure no</b>
<br><b>kids wandered down there as I had. He told me he often saw the girl,
though</b>
<br><b>no one would believe him. I told him what happened and he only said,
“Well I</b>
<br><b>suppose she must have been staying in that cabin when she was at
camp here.”</b>
<br><b>The next day I was on the boat home, but Jason had to stay at the
camp for</b>
<br><b>the summer. He was fired that year after a boy from his cabin had
followed</b>
<br><b>him out and almost drowned by the docks.</b>
<br><b>My brother and I seem to be the ones in the family who attract all
the</b>
<br><b>ghosts, but in these next two stories, I deal with it a little more
on my</b>
<br><b>own.</b>
<br><b>About 3 years ago, my father and were living alone; my parents had
a divorce</b>
<br><b>and my siblings were old enough to move out on their own. In this
house we</b>
<br><b>had a bit of a playful spirit. Two of my best friends came over
one night</b>
<br><b>for a sleep over, and they were dancing. It was just the three of
us,</b>
<br><b>because my father was at work, and I guess the ghost decided he
wanted to</b>
<br><b>dance to because he pulled me up off my bed and started to dance
with me. It</b>
<br><b>wasn’t scary, in fact it was kind of fun, but none of us could see
him</b>
<br><b>(although we could hear a soft male laughter). It was all good fun
until we</b>
<br><b>started to get tired and wanted to go to bed, but he just wanted
to keep</b>
<br><b>dancing. So he became violent and threw the CD player at us. We
went to my</b>
<br><b>godfathers, who lived right next door, and waited for my father
to come</b>
<br><b>home. I told him about it the first chance I got, and because of
that “pig</b>
<br><b>farm incident,” he believed me. The ghost didn’t bother me for a
while after</b>
<br><b>that, but one night he decided to play a joke on my father and me.
The</b>
<br><b>doorbell rang at about 10:30 pm and my father went to go answer
it, but of</b>
<br><b>course no one was there. This continued, even when he waited to
open the</b>
<br><b>door the second the bell rang, he found no one. He decided to do
as he had</b>
<br><b>done on the farm, and ignore it, which wasn’t the smartest thing
he has ever</b>
<br><b>done. The bell ringing became louder and more frequent until we
heard the</b>
<br><b>door fly open, slam against the wall, and we heard a crash downstairs.
This</b>
<br><b>ghost really didn’t appreciate being ignored, so he had gone downstairs
and</b>
<br><b>turned over the coffee table, scared the cats, and torn down the
living room</b>
<br><b>curtains. We moved out of the house soon after.</b>
<br><b>That was the last house I lived in before this one, and I am now
16. Before</b>
<br><b>I go into depth with my final story I will tell you a bit about
my</b>
<br><b>Grandmother. She used to always joke that she was a witch, not a
Wiccan, but</b>
<br><b>a Halloween type witch and growing up I had believed her. She told
me that</b>
<br><b>when I was old enough, she would get me a broom and teach me to
fly. After</b>
<br><b>my grandfather died, I spent some nights at her house when my parents
were</b>
<br><b>out (before they divorced) , and I would hear her talking, it seemed,
to my</b>
<br><b>grandfather. I knew he could very well be a spirit keeping her company,
but</b>
<br><b>I didn’t hear him, and I never asked her about it (something I now
regret).</b>
<br><b>At the retirement party at the post office they had for her, they
gave her a</b>
<br><b>broom signed by all of the other workers there because she had always
said</b>
<br><b>she was a witch. When I saw it I asked, “When do I get my broom?”
I was old</b>
<br><b>enough to know she had been joking, but then she looked at me in
a serious</b>
<br><b>way and said, “When you are ready.”</b>
<br><b>When we moved in to this house, we were glad to find in the first
year and a</b>
<br><b>half we lived here that there was no ghost. We moved in with my
grandmother,</b>
<br><b>who had become ill and flat out refused to go into a retirement
home. She</b>
<br><b>lived in the downstairs apartment. She passed away this last January
21st. I</b>
<br><b>was at school, in my Career and Personal Planning class. We were
watching a</b>
<br><b>movie and I saw my grandmother in the room and she was waving at
me. I</b>
<br><b>looked around at the other students, but none of them seemed to
see her,</b>
<br><b>when I looked back she was gone. Then the classroom phone rang and
I knew</b>
<br><b>what it was, so I began to pack my things. The teacher hung up the
phone and</b>
<br><b>turned to come towards me, but I was beside her and at the door.
She looked</b>
<br><b>puzzled and asked how I knew I had to leave. She had told us months
earlier</b>
<br><b>of her own ghost experience and I told her what I saw. She understood
and</b>
<br><b>let me leave. I went to the office where my fathers’ girlfriend
was waiting</b>
<br><b>for me, she only looked at me, and she could tell that I knew. The
whole way</b>
<br><b>home I didn’t cry, the reality hadn’t hit me yet. Not until I had
got home,</b>
<br><b>I looked in the house, and it already looked so empty. She was cremated
and</b>
<br><b>her ashes were put in an urn with my grandfather. Things didn’t
become too</b>
<br><b>odd until things started going missing and we kept finding them
on her</b>
<br><b>kitchen counter. My dad moved his bedroom into her old one so I
could have a</b>
<br><b>computer room up here, in his old room. After that little move,
he started</b>
<br><b>to smell cigarette smoke in the early morning. Both my father and
I are non</b>
<br><b>smokers so out noses are sensitive to the smell. We also found old
books of</b>
<br><b>hers open around the house every now and then, she loved to read.
When we</b>
<br><b>started to get rid of her things, my father used that as therapy,
we found</b>
<br><b>in her closet a broom with many signatures on it. I then saw her
again, and</b>
<br><b>she whispered to me, “Take the broom, you are ready, and I can be
your</b>
<br><b>wings.” Now whenever I cry I can feel her watching over me and she
has</b>
<br><b>helped me through a great deal. It really makes me feel better that
she is</b>
<br><b>still at home when I need her.</b>
<br><b>So those are my stories, I know they went on forever, but they took
me a</b>
<br><b>while to type up and I’m happy with them. I hope if anyone finds
my stories</b>
<br><b>interesting they will contact me and share some experiences, it
would be</b>
<br><b>interesting because I love to hear about it. Until then I will continue</b>
<br><b>reading the contents of this page.</b>

<p><b>My Old Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: servandob@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;i just moved into a new house and it's great&nbsp; but i've
had my own weird expeirences at the age&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; 13.
in my old home the rooms would suddenly become very cold and i would always
feel as if someone was watching me. i spoke with my mother about it not
to long ago and she said that she felt the same way,she told me that when
we first moved in (i was about 3 years old) cabneit doors would open and
close violently and that when she showered she felt as if someone was also
watching her . she told me that once she and&nbsp; i were watching t.v.
when we heard th garage door open we asumed it was my father trying to
scare us because he always enters from the front door but when noone came
in. my mother went to check it out and found noone. the weird thing is
that my father nor my sister would ever witness any anything. one night
iawoke because i felt as if someone had poked me really hard in my right
hip i asked my parents if they had done it but both said no . that never
happened again but i would wake up in the middle of the night to the feeling
of someone watching me. i would sometimes find myself at home alone after
school ,d my homework then watch t.v. though i've never seen a ghost before
i've always felt it with me when i use to live there. one more thing my
mother and i always felt safe and never unwanted.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted Summer was the Start</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kminker@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It started the summer before I started High School.&nbsp; My parents
had bought a new house in Port Saint Lucie and we moved there.&nbsp; My
parents would often work the graveyard shifts of their jobs and I didn't
really see them all that often.&nbsp; I was the only one home with my little
brother and sister, and I'd often be up until four or five in the morning,
usually watching re-runs or reading a book.</b>
<br><b>When I first moved into this house I told my dad that it was uncomfortable
for me.&nbsp; He said the only reason was because of the simple fact it
was the first actual house that I was ever living in.&nbsp; Which was true,
so, I believed him and just dealt with the uneasiness I felt.&nbsp; A couple
of weeks after living there, I was up one morning and saw something walk
behind me from the hallway by my room and into the kitchen.&nbsp; I thought
that I was just losing my mind, I was up late and I was the only one awake,
you know, that type of thing.&nbsp; Well, as time went by I saw it once
a month and always around the same time, about two in the morning, and
it always did the same thing.</b>
<br><b>Christmas time came and a friend of mine I'd made at school was
staying over.&nbsp; We were the only ones home and well, we were up watching
Disney movies when my friend went pale.&nbsp; I looked at her, keeping
my calm and making sure I didn't get nervous because I'd seen the figure
again.&nbsp; When I asked her what was wrong, she described the figure
that I'd been seeing for the last few months exactly, and I just pretended
like she was crazy.&nbsp; She told me she'd seen a man, with a yellow shirt
and jeans on, walk right behind me into the kitchen.&nbsp; These sightings
continued for a few years, only they started to change and new things would
happen around the house that I thought were related to this figure.&nbsp;
I would be on the phone with a female friend and know that my parents were
out doing their karaoke thing and my siblings were in bed, yet, I'd hear
two men talking.</b>
<br><b>It wasn't until three years had past that I told my parents what
I had seen and heard.&nbsp; That's when whatever it was woke up.&nbsp;
Now that my parents knew it was there, it allowed itself to be known.&nbsp;
My mom is one of those people where a tornado could go through the backyard
and she'd sleep right through it as long as she's in her bed.&nbsp; She
sat up in the middle of the night, awakened by the sound of what she described
as someone dropping coins on her tile floor in her bathroom.&nbsp; She
also one day walked into her bathroom because she had to pee, and she heard
her shower door shut.&nbsp; This door that shut, was tricky, you had to
pull with your might and slam it shut to open and close it, so you can
imagine.&nbsp; We only lived in that house until the following summer.&nbsp;
We didn't move because of the entity which we named Bob, but because it
was being foreclosed on.&nbsp; I feel that this house has some kind of
curse on it of some sort because that was the second time it was foreclosed
on in one decade.&nbsp; I'm not really sure what it was but something was
definitely in that house, it never hurt us, and it never tried to communicate
at least not to my knowledge.&nbsp; I just hope that the new owners have
better luck with it than we did.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The House I live in</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mitchelanette_99@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have to tell you about the house I used ot live in! I don't know
the history of the house at all, all I know is that it was built in the
1980s. It all started when I was around 10 or 11. The first incident I
remember was one day when I was looking for my father. I have horrible
vision without my glasses first of all, and I thought I saw my dad going
down the hallway. I followed him back there only to find that nobody was
there. i went back in the living room thinking maybe he passed me in the
hallway, and I found him in the backyard asleep in his hammock. The closet
in my parent's bedroom is always cold and we're from Texas so it's really
strange. If you close it and leave the room it is always open when you
come back. I've closed it and pulled on it with all my weight and cannot
get it to open without turning the door nob. Their dog will sometimes growl
at it and run away with her tail between her legs. My mom one time saw
a little girl running around our front dining room. I didn't really believe
her at first, until one day I was in their room doing my hair and I looked
behing me in the mirror and there was a little girl standing in the corner
stairing at me with her hand on the closet door.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Old Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: linzibaby21@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i am recounting a story that my mum has told me because at the time
it occured i was too young to remember.</b>
<br><b>there are many incidents that happened all based around the same
house, my mum and dad had been waiting for a house to become available
for months as we were living with my nanna at the time and my mum and dad
wanted a house of thier own. they were offered a house in south yorkshire
and they jumped at the chance to live in their own house, as soon as they
went to look at the house thats when strange things started to happen.</b>
<br><b>they were walking down the path towards their new house when they
realised that the bathroom light was on, they thought that this was srange
because they had the only set of keys for the house, they soon forgot about
it as the went round their new home for the first time planning their new
life in their new home, they soon remembered it however when they finally
reached the bathroom and the room was in darkness, my dad tried to switch
the light on using the switch but it wouldnt work investigating further
my dad soon realised that there wasnt even a bulb in the light, they werent
going to let this one incident spoil their happiness in their new home
though and soon forgot about it, that is until while moving some things
into the home the next door neighbour remarked that my mum amd dad should
get someone to look at the bathroom light as she had seen it flashing on
and off the night before, again my mum amd dad were puzzled because they
hadnt had chance to put a bulb in the bathroom yet.</b>
<br><b>once we were moved in even stranger things started to happen, in
my mum and dads room there was an air vent in the wall which they could
remove and look down the landng if they heard any strange noises or if
they thought that me or my brother had gotten out of bed and were wandering
round the landing ( i was only 1yr old at the time and my brother was only
4yr old) one night my dad heard something on the landing and taking out
the vent to have a look he saw a figure coming up the stairs he described
that the figure was only visible from the legs down they looked like an
old mans and were walking straight towards his and my mums bedroom, it
scared my dad that much that he was going to jump out of the window with
no clothes on!</b>
<br><b>my mum and dad decided that this wasnt going to chase them out of
thier home, soon after this encounter my mum had another one this time
with the top half of the old man! my mum and dad were decorating in the
front room when she suddenly had the urge to go into the kitchen to get
a drink, once in the kitchen she recalls that all the room went dark she
could here no noise or anything, then as she turned round she saw the head
of an old man, he had a bald head and round glasses on and he smiled at
my mum then kissed her on the cheek! then disappeared, all the room came
back and she rushed into the living room to where my dad was and told him
what had happened he got me and my brother togeteher and they rushed out
of the house, finding safety at a neighbours.</b>
<br><b>recounting the incident to the neighbour they told my mum amd dad
that there used to be an old man that lived in our house not long ago and
he had died in the back bedroom of a heart attack, his widow had moved
out of the house because she was being visited by him too. on the strength
of this my mum looked up the woman that had the house previous to us living
there and went to see her, the woman showed my mum a photo of her dead
husband and my mum confirmed that, that indeed was the old man tha she
had seen in the kitchen, the old woman revealed also that my mum looked
uncanily like her own daughter and she had a son the same age as my brother
so had come to the conclusion that the old man had mistook my mum for his
own daughter and that is why he had visited her in the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>my mum and dad decided that they could no longer live in a house
that they had to share with a ghost so decided to move out, but then the
'old man' became aggressive.</b>
<br><b>while taing down bunkbeds of my brothers, my dad and his brother
felt a presence my dad shouted for him to go away when all of a sudden
something smacked the window so hard that you could see the pane of glass
still shaking minutes after! lets just say that my dad said it was the
quickest set of bunk beds he has dissembled in his life!</b>
<br><b>also they were carrying their double bed down the stairs, once at
the bottom they had got too much to carry out the door so they left the
headboard at the foot of the stairs only for it to stand up by itself,
fly down the passage way and smack on the back door!</b>
<br><b>my dads friend came to help the moving and he brought hid dog with
him, they say that dogs can sense something that we cant and my dad recalls
that no way would the dog set foot in the house, it cowered outside the
door with its ears back, wimpering.</b>
<br><b>the whole story was quite popular it was in a tabloid newspaper
and they wanted my mum to go on tv and talk about it but she wouldnt as
she just wanted to forget about it, this was virtually impossible however
as she was bombarded with letters asking her to join supernatural groups
an communities, she even had police protection for several months as in
one of the letters the group said they would kidknap her if she didnt join
voluntarily.</b>
<br><b>the strange goings on didnt stop there, after being moved out of
the house for several weeks my mum and dad went back to collect any post
that may have been sent to the address, as they were still shaken they
looked through the letterbox into the passageway to see if they could see
the post first and the whole passage way was in darkness even though it
was in the middle of the day, they then went to lok through the windows
where they discovered their post resting in the kitchen window, no one
had been in the house since my mum and dad had moved out so how could it
have got there? ive seen the articles in the newspapers that my nanna had
saved on it, also ive seen the letters that my mum recieved and even though
i was too young to remember im in no doubt that it happened.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Unexplained Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: FrankKubiak@outdrs.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the fall of 1967 I was a Chief Warrant Bos'n in the United States
Coast Guard stationed on board the CGC Citrus, a Buoy Tender based in Kodiak,
Alaska, I was subsequently transferred to the CGC Mackinaw based in Cheboygan,
Michigan. I drove the ALCAN Highway to my new duty station, Upon arriving
I was informed that the Government was to furnish me quarters ashore for
my family, but because of some illogical reason the Command had me arriving
later than expected, consequently my quarters were not ready for occupancy.
The "Landlord" was a very nice person and allowed me to use his furnished
summer home on the beach overlooking the Straits of Mackinaw, while he
was refurbishing the home I was to reside in. I visited the house and was
very disappointed at its rundown condition, he and his wife were working
to remodel and clean the place up. It had been vacant for a long period
of time and the walls were covered with green mold the floors were rough
and worn if soft pine and painted, but I had no choice.</b>
<br><b>Eventually the place was done and I was to move in, We contacted
the moving company and they delivered our furniture which was in storage.
The movers set up all our furniture and the day was very tiring and we
were happy to get to bed.</b>
<br><b>Upon arriving at the house I sensed an dreadful feeling, but brushed
it off. That evening, my new Lab Puppy that was constantly with me, followed
me everywhere and my sons Cat that slept on his bed , they were inseparable.
We started up the stairs My son in the lead and his faithful cat "Scupper"
directly behind him. When "Scupper arrived at the last step, he hunched
up, his tail grew fat he swore, and immediately flew down the stairs refusing
to go up. At the time I gave it little thought. When I arrived at the top,
My little puppy let out a squeal and went yelping down the stairs, again
I paid little attention, I was just too tired to really take note or care.</b>
<br><b>I can't say when the major occurrence happened. My memory has it
some time in November of 1967. The children all went to the local theatre
to see a movie, the wife and I were alone and we had just furnished a small
odd sized room off the living room and were sitting on the floor thinking
how we could furnish it with perhaps a love seat as it was a very small
room. I had hung My trophies on the walls and we were just gazing at the
walls when a side board in the next room fell over and crashed, the noise
was deafening, you could hear crystal breaking, plates running along the
floor, it was so very loud and easy to know what had happened by the noises.
I thought I was losing my mind, I asked my wife what did you hear, she
stated, a side board full of dishes and glasses fell over spilling its
contents on the floor. There was one problem, we did not own one, when
we managed to get&nbsp; the courage to get up and look. there was nothing
disturbed in the house. The only thing we heard was&nbsp; the house creaking
from the cold winter wind. There was and as far as I know no logical explanation
for this.</b>
<br><b>The next serious incident could have been a nightmare, but it is
not what I thought I experienced. I fell asleep on the couch and my wife
went up to bed and did not awaken me. All of a sudden I awoke with a horrible
looking old hag lying on top of me clawing on my chest and screaming in
my face, and suddenly the apparition vanished. I was terrified, I got up
walked around the house, I&nbsp; thought about&nbsp;&nbsp; just getting
the hell out of there. But logic took over, I was in the Military, I could
not leave. I could not even tell anyone about if for fear of being labeled
insane. Can you imagine if I told My Commanding officer these stories,
they would have had me committed. Some time later My sisters visited me
and one evening My older sister asked me if some one was ill that night
as she heard some one walking in the hall moaning. I did not dare reveal
to her the previous experiences we had, but sort of ignored her question.
They left and when they did The dreaded feelings I had about house disappeared.
The dog and the cat freely ran up the stairs, and we had no further incidents,
My brother in Law died of a massive stroke after he arrived home, although
I don't think there was any connection to this house. I decided to retire
from the Coast Guard shortly after. I also found that the children at school
told my children that they were living in a haunted house. I also heard
that some time while the house was empty, a young child was found floating
in the basement (The basement would flood in the spring from melting snows
and heavy rains) He had been raped and murdered. I wanted to confirm the
story with local police but never did.</b>
<br><b>Just recently I met a person from Cheboygan who was a long time
resident there and knew all the local gossip and she told me that the house
was noted to be haunted. She gave me a phone number of a local historian
who could enlighten me, but I lost the number. I would like to find that
person and see if I good get some info on the history of that house. I
estimate the house was probably built some time in the early1920's.</b>

<p><b>Personal Experiences with Spirits or Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Aikidoman666@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have two first hand experences that I feel are worthy of sharing
My name is Daniel Hulley and these are my two best stories even though
I have others</b>
<br><b>First I would like to strart off by saying that I dont always see
ghosts but I do feel them, the air around me changes when there is a ghost
around I can feel them. Why i can I dont know but it has alway been this
way. I do see them occasionaly to. The house I grew up in is in Warwick,
Rhode Island they house was built in 1878 and is ripe with spiritactivity.
I do not know why they are there just that they are. My parents bought
the house before disclosure laws were in effect with real estate so I have
no idea what might have happened there once upon a time. There is a hallway
in the upstairs of the house that both mine and my brothers rooms are on
and in that hall way there walks a Ghost that we have named Emma(it just
fits with the feeling we get from her) she used to open our (mine and my
bed room doors) and tuck us in at night. We both would feel a weight sitting
on the edge of our beds than slowly the sheets would get tighter around
us until we were infact tucked in, the doors to our rooms would never stay
shut through the night even if we were the only two home. This was not
a frightening ghost but a very plesent one, I never got bbad feelings from
Emma but she did enjoy mischeif once in a while she like to shake the glasses
in the cupboards but if my mother yelled emma cut it out they would stop
shaking instantly. That is my first and the nicer of the two experences...</b>
<br><b>The second&nbsp; occured two thanksgivings ago. I went out to arizona
to visit mygirlfriends family, she was going to school out there and her
Grandmother lived there as well. One of the nights I was set to stay with
her grandmothers boyfriend at his house. As soon as I walked in I felt
a dark angry feeling that permiated the entire house. I knew instantly
that somthing bad had happened ther at one time or another. I didnt know
what at the time, I could feel a presance in the house, as I walked down
the hall to what was to be my room for the night I felt as if I steped
on carpet and I looked down and the entire hall way was tiled. as i ran
my ahd along the was I felt bumps, but the wall appeared to be flawless.
As I stepped into my room I felt the anger and the presance again. I shook
it off&nbsp; completely figureing I was only stay the night no big deal.Well
I went to sleep around 1:00 that morning and as I crawled into bed I felt
the presance start moving around the room, it felt like i was being stalked
by a predator. The feeling was so strong i could track his movements with
my eyes, i followed the presance over to the bed that was oppasit mine
and watche the matress depress as if some one sat on it buit there was
no one there at least not yet. I did not sleep that night, I do not spooke
easly cbecasue i have felt and seen ghosts as long as I could remeber but
I was scared the feels I was getting were so angry so hateful that it nearly
made me physicaly ill. I watched that spot as the hours ticked by finaly
at aroun 4:00 in the morning i saw him..just vaguely not enough to describe
him just a vague outline but there was no mistaking the large knife in
his hands. The morning finally came and he appeared to finally move out
of my room. The next morning I asked the owner if somthing odd had happened
there. He proceeded to tell me the he got a great price for the house because
the previous owner had killed his wife and than killed him self he even
showed me a newpaper clipping form years before that proved it had happened.
I also later found out that the hallway was carpeted where the women was
killed but the carpet was staind with blood that they had to tear it up
when he moved in and that the walls were blood stained and that painted
over, also I found out that the room i was staying in was the room in which
the man killed himself. I know this sounds like a work of fiction but i
swear to you that it is one huindred percent true,&nbsp; so please do not
dismiss this as some kids fantasy</b><b></b>

<p><b>One of my More Recent Ghost Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Rick.Dearbin@HarmonSolutionsGroup.Com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I’d like to start out by saying that my story can hardly be considered
what people now recognize as a “ghost story,” however I still find it amusing
to this day.</b>
<br><b>The house that my now ex-girlfriend and I used to live in was built
sometime in the earlier 20th century, so it’s not an exceptionally old
house, yet old enough to definitely not be considered new.&nbsp; It was
the typical mid-western house (especially for the time it was built) with
two stories and a basement.&nbsp; By the time we moved into it, the house
was a rental property with the upstairs converted to another apartment.&nbsp;
We lived in the first floor so we were the ones that had the access to
the basement.&nbsp; The basement wasn’t finished and, of course, full of
dark corners, due to the poor lighting downstairs.&nbsp; There was an additional
room where the coal used to be kept (the house still had the original coal
chute that was used when it was first built), but had been converted into
two smaller rooms – a small storage area and the other had the large oil
tank, which was used to heat our house.&nbsp; We hardly ever went into
either of these rooms, as they just plain gave us the creeps.</b>
<br><b>Neither she nor I ever really felt comfortable in the basement,
though we felt that it was more relative to unresolved childhood fears
than there being an actual presence in the basement.&nbsp; For the most
part, nothing ever happened.&nbsp; There were times when it felt like something
was watching you, or at least in the room with you.&nbsp; Occasionally,
the light would turn on in the middle of the night, after both she and
I made sure that it was turned off before going to bed…but the activity
was mainly confined to that.&nbsp; (Now that I’m writing this, I remember
a time when I was telling people about this at work.&nbsp; One of them
suggested that I leave a tape recorder in the basement and let it record
while I was asleep – unfortunately, I was too freaked out by the idea of
hearing something that I really didn’t want to hear…so I never did.&nbsp;
Apparently bravery is not one of my stronger points!)&nbsp; There were
also cold spots that moved throughout the room, but considering that this
was a basement – there was really no need to try and explain the “phenomenon.”&nbsp;
Eventually, it became a running joke with me, her, and our friends that
would come over.&nbsp; I would “talk to” the ghost, always addressing it
as “Ghost,” (I never said I was the most original person with names…besides,
I didn’t want to address “it” with the wrong name!).&nbsp; Of course, I
never expected a response of any sort, and except for one specific occasion,
I never received any reciprocal communication.</b>
<br><b>Eventually, my ex-girlfriend and I broke up (hence the “ex”), and
my best friend moved in to help share the financial responsibility of paying
the rent.&nbsp; Since he used to come over all the time, he was already
used to our “shared resident,” though he never really believed that anybody
else was there and that I was just plain stupid for even considering that
there might be.&nbsp; Typical for two bachelors living together, one of
the most commonly used and highly coveted items in the house was the remote
to the TV.&nbsp; And naturally, that was the one thing that was consistently
getting lost.&nbsp; There were so many times when the entire living room,
the kitchen, and our bedrooms would be tore up while searching for the
accursed thing – only to find it afterwards in the most logical of places,
to where we could have sworn that we had already checked there.&nbsp; But
we excused this to lack of attention on both of our parts.&nbsp; Finally,
the dreaded day came - we could no longer find the remote to the TV!&nbsp;
NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!&nbsp; We looked for it for several days, but eventually
gave up, thinking that somebody took it as a party favor (did I mention
that we were only 21 &amp; 22 at the time – people taking stuff from our
house wasn’t completely unheard of!).&nbsp; Jokingly, I said that the ghost
took it – since he (eh…what can I say, it felt like a male presence!) was
obviously a huge fan of wrestling and Jerry Springer.</b>
<br><b>A year and a half passes.</b>
<br><b>My roommate and I (along with my new girlfriend) were packing our
stuff up, as we had been evicted so our landlord could give the place to
his daughter and her new husband.&nbsp; Kellie (my g/f at the time, now
my wife!) and I had just finished packing up the kitchen – cleaning out
every single drawer and cupboard, and had completely cleaned the countertop
as well.&nbsp; Everything was in boxes.&nbsp; After a long day of this,
all of us were hungry and when my roommate popped his head in the kitchen
saying that we should head out to eat, we were more than happy to leave
for a bit.&nbsp; As we were walking out of the kitchen door to leave, I
turned around – completely on a whim – and yelled, “Okay Ghost, we’re taking
off for a bit now ‘cause we’re hungry…and tomorrow we’ll be gone and completely
out of your house.&nbsp; It would be REALLY, REALLY cool of you to finally
give us back the remote, since we won’t be back anytime soon to get it,
and the other people moving in won’t be able to use it…would you please
just let us have it back?”&nbsp; I turned around and we left after that,
the two of them laughing at how stupid I could be at times…granted, I was
laughing at myself too.</b>
<br><b>After our delicious and nutrient-rich meal at the local Chinese
Buffet, we returned home, ready to resume the mundane job of packing.&nbsp;
I walked in last, Kellie and Kurt (my roommate) were already heading into
the living room, engrossed in their conversation of how to “attack” the
rest of the house.&nbsp; I turned around to set my coat up on the rack,
which was to the left of the kitchen door.&nbsp; “NO WAY!!!!&nbsp; You
guys seriously need to stop f**king with me!&nbsp; Who did this!?”&nbsp;
As I turned around to hang my coat up, I noticed the long-lost remote to
the TV sitting on the counter, right next to the spot where I had asked
the ghost to give it back to us.&nbsp; Kellie and Kurt came in the room
and had the same reaction that I had.&nbsp; They thought it was something
that I did, just to mess with them…to which I still vouch for my innocence.</b>
<br><b>Now, just for the non-believers (because I know that this seems
HIGHLY explainable), the door that we had exited from was locked behind
us, the front door was locked (which it almost always was), and the neighbor
that was living upstairs was not home at that time.&nbsp; All three of
us have gone over ways this could’ve been possible…but so far, we haven’t
come up with a truly logical explanation.</b>
<br><b>Like I said, not a scary story by any means…just one big fan of
the WWE who is stuck in the afterlife, probably bored and thought it might
be fun to play some pranks.</b>

<p><b>I live in anorth east town in england. a place called Hartlepool.</b>
<br><b>I am now 36 and believe to have a rational head on my shoulders.
but let me tell you this.</b>
<br><b>When i was about 12 my best friend paul lived up the street from
me and one dinner time we went to his house for some lunch . He went up
stairs leaving me in his front room. as i walked into the main room i saw
his grandma stoking the fire, she turned round said hello and carried on
placing logs on the fire. Nothing scary about that . but after we left
the house, i mentioned that i said hi to his grandma and she was making
the fire up. He then told me that his grandma had died the night before.
I told him that&nbsp; i had seen her at thefire and he just burst out crying.</b>
<br><b>That was only 1 of two encounters i had which was strange.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Just a Couple of little Incidents I've Experienced</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jenny_bering@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>From the time we moved into our 230+ year old farm house i've had
a few odd experiences. When I was young I remember seeing what i thought
to be "ghosts", hearing things - the typical "haunted house" characteristics
you see in movies.&nbsp; All this time i assumed it was just my imagination
so i ignored it.&nbsp; If i saw something, i'd close my eyes.&nbsp; If
i heard something, i'd plug my ears.&nbsp; I was too afraid to accept the
possibility that maybe something was going on.</b>
<br><b>Soon after we moved into the house my grandfather passed away after
a long battle with cancer.&nbsp; During his last couple years of life we
had moved into the house (which is nextdoor to my grandparent's house)
and after school my brother and i would go and spend a few hours with them
until my parents came home. During these couple years i developed a very
close relationship with my grandpa - when he was really sick we would spend
a lot of time laying in his bed watching television together, i would draw
pictures for him, etc.&nbsp; When he died, i had a really hard time dealing
with the loss. I would cry every night when i went to bed and would sleep
with my parents (or on their floor) almost every night.&nbsp; After a few
months of this my parents started t get a little annoyed (understandably)
and started forcing me to sleep in my room.&nbsp; One night, after a particular
rough evening of crying my mother finally came into my room to lay with
me until i fell asleep.&nbsp; After cuddling with me for a while she rolled
over so we were laying back to back.&nbsp; At this time i was still crying
and quite upset - i was laying on my right side with my eyes closed and
my right arm stretched out across the bed.&nbsp; All of the sudden i felt
someone stroking my hand and then squeezing it reassuringly.&nbsp; I opened
my eyes and no one was there.&nbsp; I rolled over and looked at my mother,
assuming it was her, and she was fast asleep.&nbsp; I knew my grandfather
had been there, and i remember feeling a sense of peace.&nbsp; I woke my
mother up and told her she could go to her bed and from that day on i was
able to sleep on my own.</b>
<br><b>Things stopped for years- then we started to hear random noises,
which we figure were attributed to the settling of the house.&nbsp; One
day, when i was about 14, i was feeling sick so i stayed home from school
(alone).&nbsp; I was watching tv in the living room and my dog (a 5 year
old golden retriever) was laying in the adjacent room (the kitchen).&nbsp;
All of the sudden the dog, Jack,&nbsp; jumped up and started barking at
the wall.&nbsp; Now anyone would think that maybe there were mice or something
in the walls and the dog was just reacting to the noises, but the walls
in the house are only a single layer of brick with a layer of plaster over
them.&nbsp; Also, you have to understand that Jack is quite possibly the
most docile dog i've ever seen.&nbsp; Until that time we had pretty much
never seen him bark at anything, and since then the only time he really
barks is when he's barking at (what appears to be) just the walls.</b>
<br><b>For years this continued to happen when i was home alone, and during
that time we all just assumed that Jack was crazy or something - that is
up until about a year go when I was 'dog-sitting' my cousin's 6 year old
black lab, sheba.&nbsp; I was home alone, sleeping in my bedroom when i
was awakened by growling.&nbsp; I opened my eyes and saw Sheba standing
at attention (hair raised) growling at the corner of my bedroom.&nbsp;
I immediately got goosebumps and felt like i couldn't move.&nbsp; Sheba
proceeded to bark and growl for about a minute until i finally got up and
ran out of the room.&nbsp; She followed me, tail between her legs until
we got outside, where she proceeded to run around and act like a normal
dog.</b>

<p><b>Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bridalpassions@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>my earlier accounts of the house i grew up in are vague. i was told
that</b>
<br><b>when i was a baby at night my mother would wake and see a woman
standing</b>
<br><b>over me while i was asleep. when my moms brother stayed with us
at same time</b>
<br><b>i was a baby he had accounts of her standing over him when he would
move she</b>
<br><b>would dissipate not disappear but dissipate. she slowly faded as
if she were</b>
<br><b>still there but invisible. when i was 3 she said that when she would
wake it</b>
<br><b>would be like a fog lying over my father she would push through
it but never</b>
<br><b>had it went away till she had awakened my father. after a few more
times of</b>
<br><b>this we went without seeing her, never knew what happened just that
she was</b>
<br><b>gone and things were at ease or so we thought. when i had turned
12 my</b>
<br><b>cousin and i were playing with a Quija board we really didnt know
what we</b>
<br><b>were doing but it was a game to us. i had asked things like is there
a</b>
<br><b>spirit in this house and it had said yes asked where it was said
under bed.</b>
<br><b>we ran out of room as if we were being chased but it was not like
that at</b>
<br><b>all was just fear of unknown i guess. from that time things got
worse! house</b>
<br><b>guest had been bruised from where something had hit her and marks
on bottom</b>
<br><b>of feet where she had said it felt like nails were being driven
through her</b>
<br><b>feet. my older brother and i were sitting in living room and watched
her</b>
<br><b>walk through dining room to the upstairs where my father was. it
wasnt till</b>
<br><b>after my parents divorced that i realized this spirit of woman was
attracted</b>
<br><b>or protecting my father. she would taunt my father in his daily
routines one</b>
<br><b>time he was using restroom he sat coffee cup on sink where it was
flat and</b>
<br><b>had said now dont touch my coffee he turned to use restroom and
coffee went</b>
<br><b>crashing into wall. he knew it was not evil but more like playful.
we would</b>
<br><b>have beds shake and cold air that felt like it passed through our
bodies. in</b>
<br><b>my bedroom at the back of house was a cold spot it could be 100
degrees out</b>
<br><b>and still felt like freezing winter weather in this one spot of
my room. in</b>
<br><b>the same room we had a stain on wall that wouls not go away no matter
how</b>
<br><b>many coats of paint you would apply. it was seen there and in room
below my</b>
<br><b>bedroom which was kitchen and again in room below that which was
cellar. we</b>
<br><b>went to clerk of courts to find out history of house. we learned
mormons</b>
<br><b>made house into church, through civil war times it was a house for
wounded</b>
<br><b>soldiers then sold to 2 sisters. the 2 sisters had divided house
into 2</b>
<br><b>homes by building walls up to cut home into 2. anna mae dorner lived
in one</b>
<br><b>half and louise dorner in other half (the half we lived in) found
out that</b>
<br><b>the house was sold illegally by anna mae dorner. where the bill
of sale was</b>
<br><b>to have two signatures there were only 1 anna maes and we&nbsp;
cross referenced</b>
<br><b>to only find that louise dorner never left the house never died
never moved</b>
<br><b>nor married but we did learn anna mae did. come to find out the
two were in</b>
<br><b>love with same guy and we gathered a jealousy thing broke out and
one did</b>
<br><b>the other in because after we learned the info we used her name
and we spoke</b>
<br><b>to her called her out. she was enraged by what we spoke out in the
air we</b>
<br><b>began smelling foul odors and basement was off limits there was
a spot down</b>
<br><b>there that was a foul smell of death and we never smelled it before.
as i</b>
<br><b>think about it i believe her death took place in my bedroom where
cold spot</b>
<br><b>was and i believe the stains on wall are only the trail of her own</b>
<br><b>bloodshed. and the basement under steps where there was an entry
to sub</b>
<br><b>basement (also a part of underground railroad) we believe this to
be where</b>
<br><b>her body was buried. we put house up for sale and as our days grew
shorter</b>
<br><b>on how much longer we would be there worse it got. voices shadows
breathing</b>
<br><b>on neck all to scary for us kids. dad stayed and moved us out with
relative.</b>
<br><b>my father wont relate anything of his last two nights there but
i will say</b>
<br><b>this i never seen a man so scared. the preacher who was looking
to maybe buy</b>
<br><b>our house came one day and took 2 steps inside our home only to
complain he</b>
<br><b>fellt very sick and had to leave. we never saw him again but he
left as if</b>
<br><b>he felt her presence and that made us then seek other shelter till
house</b>
<br><b>sold. to make a preacher that sick presents evil to me. the house
is located</b>
<br><b>at 346 east king street in chambersburg pennsylvania 17201. my only
hopes in</b>
<br><b>this is after 14 years it still baffles me and i am one who likes
to see a</b>
<br><b>soul trapped released to move on to the final destination. she is
still</b>
<br><b>trapped. i really would love to see this resolved as i know many
families</b>
<br><b>who lived there after have suffered. things like lighthing striking
more</b>
<br><b>then 3 times in same place of house lil boy being called to lunch
by grandma</b>
<br><b>only for her to learn something was pushing him into couch not letting
him</b>
<br><b>up a force so strong as to feel like weights were on his chest.
i sincerely</b>
<br><b>claim this to be all true as well as letting you know the franklin
county</b>
<br><b>courthouse has records to verify these claims as we admitted hauntings
to</b>
<br><b>person selling and one buying. i dont think it is an evil as in
a entrance</b>
<br><b>to hell but it is a domain of a hell someone created for the victim
still</b>
<br><b>roaming the place disturbed by her presence.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Haunting Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sweetness@bubbajunk.com</b>
<br><b>This really isn't very hardcore or typical ghost lore, and this
isn't your every day run of the mill ghost story either. This is just my
account of the everyday normal occurences in my own household. I live in
Batesburg, South Carolina, pretty much a dot on the map and nothing more.
So that being said it should come as no surprise that medical care, police
and fire services get here at considerably less than the speed of light.(We'd
be lucky for the speed of a Galapagos land tortise). Anyway, my great-grandmother
and my grandfather both died in my home, which my grandmother and grandfather
built with their own hands, so to speak. After my great-grandmother died
(which was in the early 80's) my grandfather would often sit in her antique
rocking chair in his room and talk to her. If anyone would come in the
room he would get rather upset and tell them to get out. After he would
finish he would tell the children that he was done and they could go in
if they wished. Often times i have walked in that room and, contrary to
what i so often hear, the room would not be colder,but rather warmer. I
don't know how to explain that. But that's not the end. After my grandfather
passed on, my mother and I moved in with her to take care of the yard work
and heavy things. Bless her heart she thinks she can still do things she
could do when she was 20 and for the most part does. I would love to say
"one night" or "while I was" but I have to say,"On many occasions" I would
walk into a room, get the warm sensation, and the weirdest thing, I could
actually smell my great-grandmother's perfume. Easily explained, right?
Wrong, the perfume that my great-grandmother used is no longer produced.
Hasn't been for about 16 years. The last drops of it were used on her body
at burial. And to wrap up this uncreepy tale, if you lay in bed at night,
you can hear my grandfather walking around the house. The door to his room
often opens or shuts on its own, same as the bathroom door. The floors
in this house creak pretty awful, and so you can hear when something is
moving down the hall way. And sometimes in the middle of the night, when
i feel like I'm being watched, if I look up fast enough I can see my bedroom
door closing gently. Some people have told me that my imagination is running
wild, but I am not the only one who has experienced this. Anyone who has
stayed a night in my house will tell you. No, my house isn't haunted, I
don't think. I think that my house is watched over.</b>
<br><b>There is a house in Batesburg-Leesville, SC that is rumored to be
extremely haunted. The name of it is Hartley House. I've never been inside
and I don't know the whole story behind it only bits and pieces of it but
I think someone should check it out to answer all of our questions. Plus
I was wondering if anyone's ever heard of it?</b>

<br><b>The Tall Black Figure</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nocturnal_84@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, My name is Hafsteinn&nbsp; and I just read your incredible</b>
<br><b>story. Of course as many I do&nbsp; have my doubt's that this story
is true,</b>
<br><b>untill you spoke of the Tall Black figure. I belive that i saw one
at my</b>
<br><b>friend's house but i'd rather start from the begining.</b>
<br><b>I am a (wanna Be) writer and a artist, im trying to write a ghost
stories</b>
<br><b>and stuff, i just love stories about ghost's. Why? Becouse i grew
up in a</b>
<br><b>haunted house (still live there) every night when i went to sleep
I allways</b>
<br><b>heard voices and people walking around downstairs, you could belive
it's was</b>
<br><b>really hard to fall asleep. Then one day my mother was standing
in the</b>
<br><b>stairs talking to my father, she was going to walk down the stairs
when</b>
<br><b>suddenly something pushed her down the stairs. The really strange
things was</b>
<br><b>that she felt nothing pushing her... my father saw her suddenly
fly from the</b>
<br><b>spot she was standing on and fall to the ground...</b>
<br><b>After that, they decidet to call a priest and let him "clean" the
house.</b>
<br><b>But suddenly every thing stopped, nothing happend after that. Like
that</b>
<br><b>"they" or "he/her" heard that they were gonna call a priest and
stopped...</b>
<br><b>Years later i was going to brush my teeth and i was looking at the
ground</b>
<br><b>the whole time i was walking to the bathroom, and as i was walking
in i saw</b>
<br><b>a... well a foot, a foot of a man and i dared not to look up i coulnt
i</b>
<br><b>woulnd look at what or who that was in the bathroom, i keept looking
at the</b>
<br><b>ground and walked out in a hurry i whent into my room where my family
was</b>
<br><b>enjoying the company of my fishes (we had just bought fishes) and
i just</b>
<br><b>stood there and say'd nothing. After a while my father put his glasses
on</b>
<br><b>the tapel (That same night) and then he was going to put them back
on when</b>
<br><b>he noticed that they were gone. Nobody had taken it in the family
it just</b>
<br><b>disapered.</b>
<br><b>Months later after my father had bought new glasses. He notices
that the his</b>
<br><b>glasses were back... with alot of dust on them.</b>
<br><b>Years later i was sleeping at my friends house and i just coulnt
sleep i</b>
<br><b>didnt know why i just was there lying on the floor and staring into
the dark</b>
<br><b>hallway... after i while i looked back at the Hallway and i saw
a tall black</b>
<br><b>figure that walked up to the doorway and looked at me, my only reaction
was</b>
<br><b>to put my pillow over my head, after a while i took my pillow away
and saw</b>
<br><b>him still standing there, this was a strange being it was like his
body was</b>
<br><b>crawling with something, i couln'd see his eyes...</b>
<br><b>and he walked away into another room,</b>
<br><b>i builded up a courage to follow him but when i went into the room
there</b>
<br><b>were only my friends parents sleeping, im not sure what that was
a evil</b>
<br><b>spirit or my friends father, but he is not that tall</b>
<br><b>and he was sleeping all the night. When i read your story i remembered
that</b>
<br><b>creature that i saw when i were young.</b>
<br><b>But i have a feeling that they are still here, it has been silent

<br><b>The Old Spaghetti Factory in Duarte</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AJCastillo@fnf.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Down the street from my home in Duarte, CA is the building which
now is a restaurant. The actual building was built in 1909 and for many
years it was a school for Monrovia, Arcadia, and Duarte (K-12) then made
into district offices and then closed and boarded up for years until 1992
(i was about 9) when it was made into the restaurant. I worked there for
five until march of this year that i quit......anyway, the when i first
started alot of the emloyees have seen, felt, or experieced hauntings.
The stories which are all true range from pots fliying, trashcans sliding
across the room, images of kids swinging on the shandeliers, to voices
of kids crying or laughing.....ive only had one thing happen to me in the
5 years i was employed there. Two co-workers and myself were in what is
now the bar. One of them was standing next to me counting change and dropped
a dime (I was sitting). We both bent down to pick up the fallen coin and
as both of our hands came within a couple of inches from the coin.......it
moved about 2 inches away (granted there are no open windows in the bar,
and what gust of air can move a dime on the floor indoors anyway) i freaked
and junmped up...he just stood there laughing...as if he didnt want to
believe what he just saw....anyway i do believe that building is haunted.....when
it was still a school it is said that the principal hung himself in his
office (which is a room with a table that seats 8, which is called the
principals office), and there was a fire that killed children and teachers.
There are also tunnels that begin under the school and go to city hall
and to the wash. I have grown up in Duarte my whole life and everything
ive typed to my knowledge is true.....i would suggest some ghost hunters
or phychics check this place out..I would love to see something on this
old building ,&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks for your time</b>

<p><b>The Night My Mom Passed Away</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: crazylady@i-is.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I went to Florida where my mom and dad were living to help take care
of her while she was sick and dying of cancer. During the time I was there
my youngest child got injured I had to fly home in a mad dash. I had been
there for about three weeks and to tell you the truth I could do about
anything but I was having trouble coping with the fact of her passing away
while I was there. I just could not deal with the cornor comming and them
taking her away in a body bag. I returned home from Florida very late on
a Friday night or should I say early on a Saturday morning. That night
when I went to bed I awoke out of my sound sleep, but yet I wasnt able
to move, I was laying on my stomach but both of my legs were straight up
in the air. I could not move the rest of my body it was like I was frozen,
then I heard my moms voice. She was talking to me, I could see her out
of the corner of my eye at the side of the bed holding my legs up by my
feet. She said well its about time you heard me, she then dropped my feet
and said now that I have your full attention I want to tell you something.
I still could not move any part of my body, my husband was laying not more
than two inches at my side, I was trying to talk, scream, move or anything
to get his attention but froze stiff is what I felt like. As I looked at
my mom I seen standing in the shawdow behind her another figure, the figure
turned out to be that of my nephew who had died some time ago, at the young
age of 12. I think my eyes may have been bulging out of my head but my
mom just contiuned to talk to me. She told me that she was fine now, that
she loved me and that she knew I was the strong one out of all of us children
and that she wanted me to promise her that I would take care of my dad
and tell him that I seen her and she told me this. She said there would
be some things comming up that my dad would need my help dealing with and
she wanted me to promise her I would handle all of this for her. I could
talk to her mentally she could hear me and answer me but my mouth and voice
was not working it was all in my head. I made all of these promises to
her told her I loved her and then poof she was gone and all of a sudden
my body was no longer in that frozen state. I woke my husband up and told
him all of this, now you have to rememeber I still did not know that my
mom had passed away. I got that call in a about another half an hour. After
my sister called me in Florida and told me my mom passed away and I asked
her when and she told me the time it was not much more than a few minutes
after my moms death that she paid that visit to me. Other strange things
seemed to follow with that night every now and then too. We have caller
ID on our phone and it rang about four or five times my husband answered
it got this strange look on his face and said honey I think it is for you,
I said who is it as he handed me the phone he just looked at me funny,
I said hello into the phone and all there was at the other end was music
playing like that of a little music box, it was playing the song "Let Me
Call You Sweetheart" the weird thing is before my mom became to sick she
hand crocheted me a doll with a music box in it and the music box plays
"Let Me Call You Sweetheart", so I guess my husband was right it was for
me. We looked at the caller ID which did not register that a call even
came through on the phone, we tired the call back feature and other methods
and nothing showed up. Every now and then to this day some strange things
will happen like that and during this time I know that my mom is with me.
I will have to write some of the others in the future for more stories
to relate to those of us who believe</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting on the Job</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Komal.Gordhan@nwlh.nhs.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>My dad works as a builder and repairs houses etc..</b>
<br><b>When he was doing the tiles for a flat which was 4 stories high
and had several flats, he noticed someone's presence for 2 days when he
was working. He asked an older person living on the street and found out
that there was a graveyard at the bottom of the flats and they were built
on top of a graveyard.</b>
<br><b>He said he kept turning around because he felt cold and that someone
was watching him, but did not see anyone.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Presence in a Pub</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Komal.Gordhan@nwlh.nhs.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>A lady I work with used to work in the Green man pub on Dagmare Avenue
in Wembley.</b>
<br><b>She said the pub and the area around this is haunted.</b>
<br><b>On one occasion, she went to visit a friend's house, whose garden
overlooks the pub. He was sitting in the garden stroking his cat, which
everyone could see and realised that his cat died over 20 years ago.</b>
<br><b>On one evening, the lady caught the landlord's son talking to himself
at the beginning of a corridor. When she asked him whom she was talking
to, the boy said he was talking to an armoured soldier that was standing
in front of them which she could not see. The boy was 6 years old.</b>
<br><b>When she was working at the pub many years ago, she had to take
a few stock items from the cellar to the pub upstairs and found broken
bottles every morning in the cellar. On one occasion as she was about to
open the door she felt cold and that someone was behind her, and left the
job.</b>
<br><b>On night she was their with her friends and she left early. Her
friends phoned her the next day saying that a hand appeared from behind
the pub just before closing time and that a murder took place that night.</b>
<br><b>The pub is still open until today and I plan to visit it soon.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Saying Goodbye</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kleynschoorel@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My mother is one of 14 children and she grew up in a small town in
Tennessee called Wartburg.&nbsp; My mother's youngest brother died when
he was 2 years old. At that time I was not even born yet, but my first
cousin Michael was and one day he was standing outside of my Grandma's
house he was 5 or 6 and my Grandma decided to take his picture.&nbsp; When
the film was developed standing in front of my cousin&nbsp; was my mom's
baby brother who had died years earlier. He was fully materialized and
was transparent as well. He was wearing a blue shirt and a diaper exactly
what he was buried in. We had the photo's looked at and the conclusion
was that there was no possible explanation for the results of this photo.
Strange huh !? I think so too</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Husbands Visit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: manju.kumar@hqspd.sahara.co.in</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband was suffereing with severe depression. Treatment was going
on, but it was very slow. Gradually it lead him towards the worst. One
day, one of our neighbor died from Liver Cerhosis, my husband , who was
under depression and medicines, went to see his body, which was lying in
his house, and his family menbers were collecting there. That night, I
did not know that it was the last night I was spending with my husband.
Next morning, he went out as ususal for morning walk, atleast I thought.
And tragedy struck me when at about 10 o'clock, I came to know that he
had committed suicide by throwing himself under a running train. Anybody
can understand my condition, i was broken , shattered and helpless.</b>
<br><b>My family members started collecting and consoling me. That same
night, I felt the smell of smoke and iron rail track , a strange smell
of diesel oil and all that comes from rail engine,very clearly, as if my
husband is trying to come near me.&nbsp; I also felt a starnge sensation
for 5 days. It was as if, something is trying to enter my body when I was
asleep, but I myself could feel&nbsp; slight tremors, while my own people
used to ask me ... 'why are you trembling?' I could feel his presence .
On the day of last ceremony, while some 'puja ceremony' was going on, the
wall clock that was hung behind me, both the hands of clock stopped for
full 7 seconds, the time was 6.35, and my husband had finished his life
at 6.35 in the morning. This thing many people had witnessed, and we all
belived that my husband was&nbsp; very much there.</b>
<br><b>I then went to my sister's place with my two daughters, just to
get peace, The same night, I went to bed with my younger daughter, who
was 15 years old then. It was 9.30 p.m. I was lying with my eyes closed
and drifted into relaxed state. All of a sudden, I felt as if I am taken&nbsp;
to a place , a long verandah where my husband was sitting , wearing dark
brown pajama suit(it is still with me) by a table. I was made to sit on
a chair across the table. He was very sad and looking very helpless. I
started weeping and asked himm' why did you do that, why did you leave
me...?' He kept quite. There were many people around him, but I could not
see them, I felt their presence only. Suddenly two girls came there and
told me that ' today we all have come here to meet our own people, so meet
your husband.' I was just shocked and wanted to know&nbsp; why did he go.
Then I asked my husband 'where did you go?' Those girls said'come with
us, I will show you where do we live.' And to my surprise, in very very
high speed, say within a fraction of a second, I was taken to a new world.
It was very serene and divine, The blue sky was so cool and place was very
very peaceful. There were many trees, I did not see the trees, but I could
make out that green trees and greenery was existing.Cool breeze was blowing.
There were lots of people, I could not see any face but I could feel thet
many people were there. In total that place was very good and peaceful.
I suddenly said,' oh, it is so good over here, do you live here? It is
so peaceful'. Then within a fraction of second, we all came back to the
place where I was sitting. My husband was also sitting with very sad face.
It is to mention that he had not uttered a single word till that time.
I was just holding his hands and was crying.Suddenly, He stood up and said
in a very very sad voice, ....I had to go... I was with you but my time
was over... I had to go.' I also stood up and held his hands in mine and
I was just crying and crying and was requesting him to stay back or take
me with him. he said' ... leave my hands... I have to go.... leave me....
dont stop me... leave me.... other wise I would have tremendous pain, I
cant be here now... leave me...' I was crying bitterly and was holding
his hand, suddenly I saw that my husband's face was getting distorted with
acute pain and he started writhing. I got so scared, I left his hands and
shouted loudly ...'oh.. go... go...' and at that very moment I was awake.
I felt as if I had come from somewhere else where I had gone to visit,
i was feeling as if now was the timeto sleep. I looked at the clock, it
was 3.20a.m. and to my surprise, my daughter who was lying beside me, held
me tightly and said,' mummy... papa was here with me... he had come ...
he banged the door when he was leaving, did you hear? ' I said. let us
sleep I will talk to you in the morning. I slept for 3 hours and when I
got up around 6.30, I narrated this to my daughter and other family members.
I strongly believe that he had come from the other plane and visisted me.
He wanted to tell me that since his time on earth was over he ended his
life, he wanted to tell me that it was his natural end. He showed me the
place where he had gone to stay.... was it heaven... I dont know. And after
that I never even dreamt of him, nor he visited me.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;I'll Bang and Bang til I bring the Church Down</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: David@Lightinguniverse.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I learned more than twenty-five years ago at a Christian camp near
the Pocono Mountains that there is sh.. out there that most of us don't
know about. It was my last time going of to summer camp with my two brothers
Stephen and Brian. We had just been dropped off by my Mother and I was
jumping on the trampoline when I noticed a lot people running towards the
admin building. I followed the crowd up the hill to as close as I could
get to where all the commotion was. A councilor told us all that we need
to go to an area away from the site so we could be out of the way. We got
our cabin assignments and were told to go to our cabins. We could see that
a ambulance was pulling up to the building and it left quickly. Soon we
were all told to meet at the chapel for some unknown reason. On the walk
down the hill threw scattered pine trees I saw my two younger brothers.
That was a relief because I hadn't seen them since my mom left. Gossip
started to travel amongst us kids that someone was hurt real bad. When
the different groups met up my brother waved to me that he was alright.
He had a very freaked out look on his face that I had never seen before.
We made our way inside a very large church for being at a summer camp.
There was about 150 of us including a few parents who had not left yet.
The camp minister also the camp director stepped up to the microphone and
we all went dead silent. "Today tragedy has struck as one of our fellow
campers was killed accidentally". I found out after that my brother Brian
was in the same room with the little boy who had been playing under the
piano when a leg snapped falling and crushing his head. The Minister continued
saying we should all pray when suddenly the loudest banging you could imagine
was coming from the roof of the church. I mean it sounded like we were
ants inside a drum and someone was beating Boom,Booom,Boooom! We all looked
up to the very high ceiling in the church expecting the roof to cave in
when the minister started shouting " Demon be gone from this house of God"
he kept saying that and I knew it was time to jet out the church we got
up and started running for the exits. This was really scaring the sh..
out of people. The parents who were still there packed their kids in the
cars and bolted down the dirt road. As for me and my two brothers our Mom
was already in New Jersey at that point. We stayed the next two weeks at
camp with only a fraction of the campers that came. Can someone please
tell me what really happened? I know there must be someone out there who
also was there that day. Please get back to me. Sorry for the length of
story,</b><b></b>

<p><b>1880 Mansion</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jenndrew@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mom recently moved into an old mansion built in</b>
<br><b>1880. The mansion is the second of two mansions built</b>
<br><b>next to each other by the founders of the small town</b>
<br><b>she lives in. The houses have a very interesting</b>
<br><b>history. They, of course, were family homes first.</b>
<br><b>Then they were turned into an orphanage. My mom's</b>
<br><b>house is the smaller of the two and was used as an</b>
<br><b>overflow house when there were too many kids in the</b>
<br><b>main house. My mom's house was also a bakery and a</b>
<br><b>funeral home. Most recently, the houses are being run</b>
<br><b>as a bed and breakfast. That is until my mom bought</b>
<br><b>one of the houses. The main house is still a B&amp;B</b>
<br><b>though. I have yet to go into the main house but it</b>
<br><b>really looks spooky.</b>
<br><b>Anyhoo, my mom was told that the house is not haunted</b>
<br><b>but what I've experienced may prove otherwise. Also,</b>
<br><b>my mom's best friend is "sensitive" and can feel a</b>
<br><b>presence in the house. There is a room at the top of</b>
<br><b>the stairs that my stepdad uses as his office that she</b>
<br><b>is apprehensive of. I just recently had a baby 6 weeks</b>
<br><b>ago and while I was pregnant I was really</b>
<br><b>uncomfortable in the house. Everytime I would visit my</b>
<br><b>stomach would tense up the whole time I was in the</b>
<br><b>house. I would also get bad headaches. I would feel</b>
<br><b>fine after I left. Then, one night I stayed over and</b>
<br><b>at approximately midnight I heard someone walking in</b>
<br><b>the hallway. It sounded like someone wearing boots was</b>
<br><b>walking on a hardwood floor. They walked around for</b>
<br><b>about 5 minutes and stopped. I just thought it was</b>
<br><b>rude that someone would be so loud when they knew we</b>
<br><b>were all sleeping. I strugged it off and went back to</b>
<br><b>sleep. Then, at about 5am I heard it again. I thought</b>
<br><b>that my mom must have woken up and was walking around.</b>
<br><b>I still thought that it was rude that she was being so</b>
<br><b>loud and who wears boots at 5am around the house? It</b>
<br><b>again went on for about 5 minutes and stopped. About</b>
<br><b>two hours later my mom walked into my room to wake me</b>
<br><b>up. (curiously enough we were going to a funeral that</b>
<br><b>day)</b>
<br><b>I asked her who had been walking around with boots on</b>
<br><b>and she looked at my like I was crazy. (She was</b>
<br><b>wearing slippers) I blew it off and got up to take a</b>
<br><b>shower. On my way I noticed that the hallway, the</b>
<br><b>stairs and all the rooms except for my mom/stepdad's</b>
<br><b>were carpeted. They didn't hear anyone walking and my</b>
<br><b>son didn't hear anything either. (My mom is a very</b>
<br><b>light sleeper) I also realized that the room I slept</b>
<br><b>in was directly across from the room that my mom's</b>
<br><b>friend was scared of. The walking sounded like it came</b>
<br><b>from the hallway in front of that room.</b>
<br><b>Also, the other day I was at my mom's with my newborn.</b>
<br><b>I laid him on the floor to change his diaper. He kept</b>
<br><b>staring at the ceiling in the corner and all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden he smiled and started laughing. Now, this is a</b>
<br><b>newborn. They don't do that and he hasn't done it</b>
<br><b>since. Other than in his sleep that was the first time</b>
<br><b>I had heard him laugh. At least it is hope that the</b>
<br><b>spirit is friendly.</b>
<br><b>The other day my mom asked me to housesit for her</b>
<br><b>while they go out of town. Maybe I will have more</b>
<br><b>stories...</b><b></b>

<br><b>Dog Dream</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kelso_rulz@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night, I was about 10 I think, I had a terrible dream. Now I
say it was terrible because it just had one of those spooky feelings.</b>
<br><b>My dream...</b>
<br><b>It was about 8 at night and me and my sister were walking down the
drive to get the mail. Weird, seeing as mail is not delivered at night!
Anyway, we were going down our drive, and it was really dark. Our drive
is long, so me and sis were holding hands coz it was scary. This beautiful
white labrador came up the drive and began sniffing round our feet. I thought
"Nice doggy" and bent down to pat it. It leapt up and began to savage me.</b>
<br><b>Ok guys i know that not a ghost story but the dog attacking me made
me wake up. I sat up in bed at thought "Only a dream Kelsey, only a dream."
I lay down to get back to sleep when i saw my sister standing right next
to me.</b>
<br><b>"Rachel, what are you doing? Go back to bed!" I said irritably.</b>
<br><b>She didn't move.</b>
<br><b>"Rachel!" I said, and pushed her.</b>
<br><b>My hand went right through her. That freaked me out and i quickly
his under my blankets.</b>
<br><b>Now I've seen the same thing with my parents "standing" at the foot
of my bed. I'd kick them, but i wouldnt connect with them. All three are
alive and well, and were all sleeping during the times i saw "them".</b>
<br><b>Since, Ive talked to my Dad about the spirit life, and have come
to the conclusion that when a person sleeps, their spirit goes walkabout,
and this is what causes some dreams. Of course, some dreams are caused
by memories and the such. So i guess what i saw were my parents and sisters
spirits. Interesting. I like this story, but it gives me the creeps thinking
about it. its a pity i couldnt ask them what they were dreaming those nights,
just to see if my theory is correct. Then again, maybe i was just dreaming.
It was a while ago, I'll never know!</b>
