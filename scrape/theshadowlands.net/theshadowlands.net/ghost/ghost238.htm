<P><B>&nbsp;There is a red house on this block many have</B>
<BR><B>said that this house is haunted by a guy named Bob Clark who hung
himself in</B>
<BR><B>the back room in basement of this house in 1958. Some believe that
the weird</B>
<BR><B>noises that come out of this room are Bob struggling and hitting
things with</B>
<BR><B>his feet. Sometimes you will hear screams of his wife who comes
and see's</B>
<BR><B>Bob hanging their but she is useless. Her screams can be heard throughout</B>

<P><B>Happy Hallow Park</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: REMYERNIE@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In 1977 in the afternoon, when I was 11 years old, me and a couple
of friends were Cray fishing at Happy Hallow Park in San Jose, Ca. We were
fishing on the other side of the creek away from the park, as we were walking
thru heavy brush, we seen a lady with long black hair and wearing a red
short dress and blouse, with a thick black belt, standing behind some bushes.
She kinda looked like she was from the 60's. She was just standing there
staring at us. We were going to ask her how she got across the creek because
she was dress nicely and the crossing was about 10 to 20 feet, and there
was no log or shallow part of the creek that she could have cross and as
we got closer she just faded away. And then we just ran across the creek
to the park. Me and my friends still remember this encounter. After this
incident I was interested in the paranormal and collected stories from
my family and friends.</B>

<BR><B>Duffs Smorgasboard in Madison - Nashville, TN</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; joeleeb@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I worked part time in the kitchen here from about 1985-1988. When
I first</B>
<BR><B>began to work there, others had told me stories of strange sounds,
which I</B>
<BR><B>did not believe. However, one thing all of the stories had in common
was</B>
<BR><B>they generally occured in either the morning or at night when the
restaraunt</B>
<BR><B>was closed and there were only a few employees (1-4) there. The
owner's son,</B>
<BR><B>who worked as a cook during the day, was usually the first person
to arrive</B>
<BR><B>for the day and often commented on the strange sounds he would hear
coming</B>
<BR><B>from kitchen's stock room. These strange sounds usually came in
the form of</B>
<BR><B>crashing pans or stock, as though something had fallen in the back.
This was</B>
<BR><B>an experience that most everyone who had been there a while and
had been</B>
<BR><B>there alone also claimed to have had. However, the strange experiences
were</B>
<BR><B>not limited to the sound of crashing pans. The assistant manager
and a</B>
<BR><B>couple of other employees claimed to have heard the sound women&nbsp;
laughing as</B>
<BR><B>though they were above them in the air.</B>
<BR><B>Well, being the sceptic I am, I never really took these things seriously.
I</B>
<BR><B>figured any of these so-called strange sounds, even the laughing
women,</B>
<BR><B>could be explained as either a combination of sounds you hear in
a</B>
<BR><B>restaraunt and overactive imaginations or just lies. However, knowing
a</B>
<BR><B>couple of the people to be of an upright character, I didn't believe
the</B>
<BR><B>latter to be true of them. But I figured perhaps some of the others,
who I</B>
<BR><B>didn't know as well, could have embelished on what others believed
they had</B>
<BR><B>heard. To put it plainly, I didn't buy it. And then it happened...</B>
<BR><B>one night I was alone in the kitchen cleaning up and heard a loud
crash in</B>
<BR><B>the stock room. When it happened, I didn't even think about the
stories I</B>
<BR><B>had heard so many times; I just instictively went back to see what
had</B>
<BR><B>fallen. I had no doubt there would be a huge mess for me to clean
up. When I</B>
<BR><B>got back there, I saw nothing out of the ordinary. No pans had fallen.
None</B>
<BR><B>of the canned goods had fallen. I was puzzled. As ridiculous as
it sounds, I</B>
<BR><B>even considered looking in the washing machine and dryer back there
to see</B>
<BR><B>if there was something inside of them that could have caused that
loud</B>
<BR><B>crashing noise. And then it hit me. I recalled the stories I had
heard and a</B>
<BR><B>chill like no other quickly climbed up my spine. I had, for the
first time,</B>
<BR><B>just experienced the mysterious sound that the others had claimed
to hear.</B>
<BR><B>So much for overactive imaginations, huh?</B>
<BR><B>After that, I had one other strange experience in which I heard
my name</B>
<BR><B>called out three times quickly when I was alone in the kitchen.
And the</B>
<BR><B>sound came from...well, you guessed it, the air around me. But it
was so</B>
<BR><B>faint, I'm still not sure about it.</B>
<BR><B>Duff's is no longer in business at this location but there is an
Asian</B>
<BR><B>restaraunt there now. This place is also part of a strip mall where
other</B>
<BR><B>businesses such as Big Lots and a number of others are located.
When I'm in</B>
<BR><B>the area, I sometimes want to go into the restaraunt or even one
of the</B>
<BR><B>other businesses to see whether or not these strange sounds still
occur.</B>
<BR><B>Maybe I will soon.</B>

<BR><B>The School Council Room</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: thagne_13@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My story isn't in any way scary, it's just spooky.</B>
<BR><B>Our Student Government in my University has their own office in
the school building. I've heard some rumors about ghosts in that office
but I didn't pay any attention before since they were only stories.</B>
<BR><B>One of my friends was elected as the representative of our organization,
so she get to have her own table in the School Council Office where she
leaves her things in school, sort of a free locker room because she got
elected.</B>
<BR><B>So, we took the evening class because we had to work during the
morning, and we get dismissed in class late in the evening already. Every
dismissal, she&nbsp; needs to go to the S.C. office for her stuff and every
night we (me and my other friends) has to go with her there because she
was scared.</B>
<BR><B>One time we were there, May-Ann unlocked the door took her things,
closed the lights, locked the door again and we went on our way. I remember
her closing the lights because I stood near the light switch and I saw
that the lights were closed. When we got down near the parking lot, the
lights inside the office was open again. So my friend said maybe someone
else needed to go inside and get some things, she wasn't the only one with
a key. And we went home.</B>
<BR><B>The next day, she was scolded by the S.C. President because he said
she left the lights open and the door unlocked. They knew it was her because
she's always the last one to take things from the office. Of course my
friend said she didn't leave it open and asked us to testify in her behalf.
So, the President let her go that time.</B>
<BR><B>But this happened for a couple of times and she's always blaimed
for the lights turning on by themselves even though WE know that she turns
off the lights whenever we leave the school council office.</B>
<BR><B>Another thing is that you can actually hear moaning there when its
night. Sometimes you can hear someone crying for help in there when no
one is there with you.</B>
<BR><B>I haven't heard anything more about the office but when I do, I'll
tell you immediately.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Man in Our House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bonniet0211@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I will try to make&nbsp; a short story but wanted to share my story
with your group. We purchased a home about 4 1/2 years ago. I met the lady
and saw the husband only a short time when we had the inspection of the
home. We were delayed on the closing because her husband passed away. Approximately
3 or 4 months after moving in I kept seeing a man by our pool. Thinking
it was the neighbor who lived behind us I forgot about it. Our home sits
on a couple of acres of land and eventually I started seeing this man near
the woods and where they had a garden plot before. It appeared as tho this
man was hiding and smoking cigerettes of all things. I met and talked to
one of the neighbors and told her of the strange behavior of the neighbor
and asked if he ever did that on her property. I described the man to her
and what he was doing and her face went white. She told me I was describing
the old owner of the house and that he died of lung cancer but refused
to stop smoking and did those things while living there so as his family
wouldn't catch him. Eventually he started appearing to me in the house
especially in the evening hours, somtimes slaming doors to un occupied
rooms or making hammering noises in the garage which is under our house.
It is just my huband and I who live in the house and for almost a year
and a half I was the only one to see him but other people could hear the
noises. Finally my husband did see him or what he thought to be the shadow
of a man behind him one day in our bedroom. As time went on he became more
and more active until I started to be afraid to be in the house by myself.
He was beginning to be active even during the day time. I don't know if
active is the right words to describe this so I apologize if I am wrong.
I finally was able to track down the previous owners and told them what
was going on. These people were wonderful and belived evrything I was telling
them because of things I was able to tell them about Dave that I couldn't
have possibly known. They contacted us and agreed to come over to our house.
They went thru the whole house and talked to Dave as tho he was their and
telling him he had died. They told him we were the owners of the house
now and he no longer lived their and he had to leave.Now I am surely not
a ghost expert but I do know after that night I have never seen or heard
him again. Did this man cross over as I have heard shows talk about ? Luckily
I have wonderful friends and they believed me even tho if I hadn't been
there I might not have. Thank you for listening to my story even tho you
have probably heard stories like this quite often. Your Web Site is great,
I enjoyed visiting.</B>

<BR><B>The Girl in the Field</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:Tia1b6@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 11 years old, my sister was dating a man who had
his</B>
<BR><B>own apartment.&nbsp; I spent a lot of time with my sister, including
trips to</B>
<BR><B>clean his apartment while he was not home.&nbsp; He was just out
of college</B>
<BR><B>and had very little when he moved into the apartment, so when he
found</B>
<BR><B>portraits in the closet of the second bedroom, he decided to hang
them</B>
<BR><B>around the apartment.&nbsp; They were rather ameteurish, but homey</B>
<BR><B>looking--farm buildings, fields, flowers and such.&nbsp; The apartment</B>
<BR><B>building manager said the previous tenant had fancied herself and</B>
<BR><B>artist, and left some with him as well when she moved back to the
midwest.</B>
<BR><B>One of the pictures was of a little girl in a field.&nbsp; The picture
was</B>
<BR><B>odd in that you could not see the girl's face, her back was turned.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>was sitting, facing away, in a large field with a barn and house
in the</B>
<BR><B>distance.&nbsp; My sister's boyfriend chose to hang that particular
picture</B>
<BR><B>above his couch in the living room.&nbsp; One saturday evening,
my sister</B>
<BR><B>left me in the apartment to run to the grocery store.&nbsp; I was
happy</B>
<BR><B>because I had lots of junk food and could watch "Happy Days" without</B>
<BR><B>interuption from my brother.&nbsp; I went into the kitchen during
a comercial</B>
<BR><B>break to fix myself a sandwich.&nbsp; When I walked back into the
living</B>
<BR><B>room, I found myself staring at the face of the child in the picture.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;She was not only turned toward me, she was standing and smiling.</B>
<BR><B>I dropped the sandwich and ran out of the apartment.&nbsp; I sat
outside by</B>
<BR><B>the pool until my sister returned.&nbsp; I told her the story.&nbsp;
She didn't</B>
<BR><B>tell me I was "full of it", but she didn't say much at all, which
I</B>
<BR><B>thought was odd at the time.&nbsp; I refused to go back there, and
my sister</B>
<BR><B>didn't mention it again until a few years later, at her wedding
to that</B>
<BR><B>same man.</B>
<BR><B>She asked me if I remembered seeing the girl.&nbsp; I told her yes.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>asked me what color her eyes were.&nbsp; I told her they were an
odd light</B>
<BR><B>blue color.&nbsp; My sister turned a bit white and told me the rest
of the</B>
<BR><B>story...</B>
<BR><B>She had seen the girl, too.&nbsp; She had seen her get up and turn
around on</B>
<BR><B>several occaissions.&nbsp; Her boyfriend laughed and said she was
being</B>
<BR><B>silly.&nbsp; Finally, after I had seen it too, she talked him into
taking the</B>
<BR><B>pictures off the wall.&nbsp; He put them back into the closet in
the second</B>
<BR><B>bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some weeks later, he woke up to find the living
room light on</B>
<BR><B>and the second bedroom door open.&nbsp; The pictures were scattered
about on</B>
<BR><B>the floor of the bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the pictures to the
manager the next</B>
<BR><B>day, and was told they were thrown away.</B>
<BR><B>Later, my sister asked the manager of the apartments if he knew
anything</B>
<BR><B>about the woman who had painted the pictures.&nbsp; He told my sister
that he</B>
<BR><B>tried to contact her to send her the pictures, but was told she
had</B>
<BR><B>died.&nbsp; Her relatives wanted the pictures sent to them.&nbsp;
We don't know</B>
<BR><B>how she died or who the girl was in the picture, but lets hope she
is</B>
<BR><B>somewhere safe...and content.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Experience of a Lifetime</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: astimpson@sde.state.id.us</B>
<BR><B>When I was younger I often dipised sleeping in our basement especially
alone&nbsp; so often times I would stay in my sisters room whenever my
brother { who I shared a room with } was on a scouting adventure or something
of that nature... But one night I was out of luck when it came to blessing
of having some one to sleep with they were all gone either at a friends
s slumber party or attending girls camp or a fishing trip... And of course
being 10 years of age my mother all though loving and magnificent believed
I was a little to old to sleep with her... So I came up with a plan I would
invite my best friend over for the night Kristen and I had been friends
forever and a day so of course is was perfect she came over and we played
until finally mom said lights out... Ever since Kristen and I were 4 years
old she has always hated how over our basement windows there are bars keeping
out trash&nbsp; well finally it was off to bed we scurried about brushing
out teeth and giggling before my mom came to tuck us in... My brother and
I shared&nbsp; a bunk bed and I always like to sleep up top I felt safer
with the concocked idea that any monsters would have to eat who evers on
the bottom bunk before they could get to me therefore I could easlier get
away... {hope you followed that } Anyways back to the story so we were
laying there and talking and slowly drifted off to sleep I was suddenly
awaken by a strange noise outside of the bared window I glanced over to
see what appeared to be a woman in white staring with no expression at
all at Kristen and I&nbsp; from outside the window My heart began to race
I had never seen her before she has dark brown hair that seemed to be ratted
and a long stained torn and tattered dress she look so pale and like I
said she was merely staring with NO EXPRESSION I was offically freaked
out I thought I should calm down its my imagination running wild merely
cause I am not with or by anyone&nbsp; so I closed my eyes praying that
when I opened them again she would be gone&nbsp; so I then opened them
she was still there this time she reached out her hands to me as though
she wanted to hold me I screamed and them noticed she wasn't looking at
me anymore merely placing her focus on Kristen&nbsp; then I saw Kristen
get up she started walking towards the window I called her name and said
"What are you thinking!" Kristen ignored me and continued walking towards
the window she crawled on top of our toy box and began to unlatch the window&nbsp;
I screamed for her to please stop she seemed as though she was in a trance
or daze and couldn't hear me I struggled between staying in bed and not
moving or getting up and latching the window and saving Kristen&nbsp; my
heart was racing I felt nauseated&nbsp; then all asudden I felt like I
went numb I couldn't&nbsp; move then&nbsp; the womans face began to trickle
what seemed to be blood her face looked frozen I then got hold of myself
and jumped out of bed and grabbed Kristen the lady then turned her focus
onto me and me alone her eyes looked like a pale blue with a brith white
liner scared out of my witts I said "GO AWAY PLEASE I BEG YOU GO AWAY"
I held Kristen close and fell to the ground sobbing my eyes were blurred
by my tears I closed them tightly think by chance I was just having a nightmare
praying to wake up and when I opne them she was gone yet Kristen was still
in my arms she was shaking uncontrollably I asked her what she was thinking&nbsp;
why she ignored me and she said all she could recall was a angelic voice
singing to her begging her to come with her... Kristen said I felt drawn
to her and I said I don't understand she said she { as in the ghost or
whatever} telepathically told her not to ignore her like I always do...
She felt sorry for her she said to me that she was lonely... We were both
so frozen we didn't want to leave the spot on the floor that we fell upon.
I looked at Kriste she was so frightened so in shock about everything I
asked her if she wanted to go sleep with my mom&nbsp; she replied I can't
move&nbsp; so I said we can sleep right here...The next day when at breakfast
we both just knew this isn't a story many would belive and perhaps not
one we shoudl share so we haven't not with anyone that is until now.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Playing with Dolls</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Justinash311@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 13 years old I had a dream about playing dolls.&nbsp;
I was playing with another young girl that I recognized to be my mother
at the same age (I had seen her in pictures).&nbsp; There was however another
woman there that I realised part of the way through my dream was my mothers
sister of whom I had never met, she was killed in a car accident.&nbsp;
She was playing with my mother and I (she ws an adult in the dream).&nbsp;
When I woke up in the morning I was curious as to why I had a dream about
an aunt that I had never met.&nbsp; It was only when I went to the&nbsp;
table where my mother and grandmother and other aunt were sitting looking
awfully sad.&nbsp; when I asked what was wrong my mother told me that that
day would have been Maralinda's birthday had she not died.&nbsp; When I
told my mother about the dream she and I got chills because she said that
playing dolls was one of my aunts favorite things</B><B></B>

<P><B>Old Brewery Stable Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:vze3z8gf@verizon.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>I live in Baltimore Maryland and I just wanted to share my ghost
story. I am an artist and had always dreamed of living in a big warehouse
space in the city. My husband found this great building and we moved in.
I found out that it used to be a Stable for horses that pulled beer carts
for the brewery that used to be across the street.(It was now a city firehouse).
Just before I moved in it had been an underground night club with a very
bad reputation(there had been two shooting there, not fatal ones though).&nbsp;
It was a big building and we lived on the second floor in a 4000 sq. foot
loft and I workied in my studio on the first floor. At first I thought
it was just the new place and the size that made it seem that I was not
alone at times. I would be working down stairs and hear footsteps crossing
above, then I would realize I was the only one there. My husband would
say he heard noises all the time too. He's more skeptical than me so at
first he would explain things away. My daughter who was two at the time
would talk about flying people and stare at the ceiling. My son</B>
<BR><B>(4yrs when we moved in) woke up one morning and told me&nbsp; that
several times he had been woken up in the night and there was the head
of a bearded man floating in front of his face. At first I thought he was
dreaming but it happened several times over a three year period. He was
never afraid of it and said he thought it was someone who had died here.</B>
<BR><B>Then things started to dissapear all of the time. My husband came
in sat down on the couch and took off his shoes. I was sitting there when
he came in. after a few minutes we decided to go outside in the yard. When
he reached for his shoes they were gone. We had not left the couch since
he took his shoes off but we searched the entire second floor looking for
them. When we gave up and went back to the couch they were sitting neatly
in the same place where he would have taken them off. This happened several
times&nbsp; but only on the second floor. The way the kitchen was set up,
if you were at the sink the entry door would be on your left. There was
a breakfast counter there so when you walk in the room to get all the way
into the kitchen you would have walk to the end of that counter and come
into the center of the kitchen. My husband had a habit of coming into the
doorway and talking to me over the counter while I was working in the kitchen.
Some times he would play games and come in and say something and then duck
behind the counter before I could turn to answer him. He would then pop
up and we would laugh. Well the ghost started to copy him. By this time
I was talking to the thing all the time and when stuff would come up missing
I would just ask for them back and after they were back where they should
be I would talk to him for a while just figuring he wanted some attention.
Well one day I was washing dishes and what I thought was my husband walked
into the kitchen and just stood on the other side of the counter. But when
he didn't say anything for a long time I looked over and no one was there.
I started laughing and telling my husband very funny but his hiding place
was well known by now. I looked over the counter and no one was ther. I
went into the living area and bedrooms no one was there. I found everyone
outside and they all swore that they had not been in the house.I told my
husband what happened and he had not come into the kitchen. When we would
eat dinner we would sometimes see someone pass the doorway and go down
the stairs to the first floor. Several times guests would ask me who else
was staying at our house because they would see someone go into the kitchen
or down the stairs and everyone was in the the living area. My husband
had had enough things disappear and reappear that he now believed there
was a spirit in the building. One night while I was cooking dinner he was
with me in the kitchen and he was talking when he suddenly went silent.
I looked over at him and he was just standing there eyes wide and mouth
hanging open. I asked him what was the matter and after he finished gasping
for air and pointing he said I just saw a floating head of a bearded man.
He stayed away from there for the rest of the night. The spirit never tried
to hurt us he was just lonely I think.I talked to him alot. Not long after
my husband saw the floating head we had to move. A church bought the whole
block our building was in for developement and we moved out. The last weekend
we were there we moved our stuff out and had a huge party. The place was
packed with hundreds of people through out the night. The next morning
when the DJ's were packing up the promoter came over and said ther was
a man in the doorway a minute ago and did I know there were still party
goers there. When he described the man and showed me the doorway I just
said "Oh thats the ghost, he lives here." The next day before we turned
in the keys I walked through and said goodbye and that I was sorry we had
to leave. The building is still there. I don't know when the church is
going to start working. I heard they want to turn it into a parking lot.
I lived there for three years and I really miss it.</B>

<BR><B>our home. One of the ghost was my grandmother whom I loved very
much. I</B>
<BR><B>remember that she became very ill and my mother and father were
bathing her,</B>
<BR><B>when she took her last breath. I remember being near them and how
my father</B>
<BR><B>kept calling out "mom", "mom" please don't go.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I remember how the ambulance came to try to revive her and
then finally</B>
<BR><B>placing her on a bed to take her out, and when they&nbsp;&nbsp;
left the room my</B>
<BR><B>grandma's arm dropped down from the bed. I did not know what to
feel . I</B>
<BR><B>watched&nbsp; as they took her away and saw my father's tears. I
was 8 years old</B>
<BR><B>then and thats when my extra senses kick in.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the furneral&nbsp; it was late and everyone
was a sleep but me I laid in</B>
<BR><B>my bed thinking about her , when I rolled to my back she was standing
there</B>
<BR><B>at the foot of&nbsp; my bed. She was beautiful, she flowed and she
was so happy.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember not being frighten and just watching
her and her looking back</B>
<BR><B>at me. As she brought up her finger to her lips&nbsp; to shhs me.
She was there</B>
<BR><B>watching me for what seemed to be along time. But I am sure it was
just a few</B>
<BR><B>minutes, then she turned and walked away.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I watched how her gown flowed behind her
as she walked out of the</B>
<BR><B>room and stopped and looked in my brother room. It was as thou she
had to say</B>
<BR><B>goodbye and have one last look before leaving. My grandma was very
close to</B>
<BR><B>us, and I knew she watched over us. My aunt came over to dye my
mothers hair</B>
<BR><B>one afternoon, my aunt was talking againist my grandma. It was awhile
after</B>
<BR><B>my grandma passing that she did this. My mom had roses in the middled
of the</B>
<BR><B>table, just as my aunt said".she did not believe in ghost, the roses
lifted</B>
<BR><B>by themselves out of the vase and laid neetly around the vase My
aunt was so</B>
<BR><B>scared she barreled out the back door and would not come back inside
for</B>
<BR><B>nothing. She never did for get this, and was very happy when mom
and dad</B>
<BR><B>moved out of our home and move to a different place.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing was is that my mom got heavy into
talking to the ougi</B>
<BR><B>board and she had 7 different people coming out of her.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she had a break down, it was not long after,
my dad decided to move</B>
<BR><B>her to a different home and start clean</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Aunts Visit</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rmghartley@msn.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When my aunt died, I spent the first night trying to sleep with her
voice in my head... no words, just her voice.&nbsp; The next morning, I
felt compelled to buy something for her...chocolates, her favorite...to
put into her casket.&nbsp; (I have never had this urge before or since)&nbsp;
While in line, I felt I needed a card to go with the "Gift" so I went directly
to them, directly to one that had images of the beach (her favorite place).&nbsp;
Surprisingly, the sentiment was appropriate to send to someone who had
died.&nbsp; Anyway, my aunt was very aware that I am very emotional at
wakes, and I think she was concerned that I might make things harder for
her children, especially since I felt almost as close to her as to my own
mother.&nbsp; So, while I was driving the night before her wake, she appeared
to me.&nbsp; Her image was full length standing at the outside of the car,
on the passenger side, either it was very small (about a foot tall) standing
on top of the hood, or full height (floating just in front of the car).&nbsp;
She was laughing, like she was the happiest being in the universe.&nbsp;
She was there for what seemed to be a long time, certainly more than an
instant.&nbsp; She was there long enough for me to look back and forth
and back and forth (I continued to drive).&nbsp; I can't say that I was
startled, I know I wasn't afraid.&nbsp; She stayed there laughing until
I was laughing too.&nbsp; I didn't cry at her wake or funeral.&nbsp; I
felt very much at peace, knowing that she was happy.</B>

<P><B>Moms Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sisto6@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is what has happened to my mom.&nbsp; And I seriously</B>
<BR><B>believe her, she would never lie about this.</B>
<BR><B>Everything happened at her grandmother's house.&nbsp; Most</B>
<BR><B>of it would happen upstairs.&nbsp; First of all there was</B>
<BR><B>knocking on the back door (usually three knocks) and</B>
<BR><B>no one would EVER be there.</B>
<BR><B>Another thing was door knobs moving and no one would</B>
<BR><B>be there.</B>
<BR><B>Footsteps would be heard on the stairs and doors would</B>
<BR><B>slam upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>The most dramatic thing that happened to my mom is</B>
<BR><B>that one night for no reason she woke up.&nbsp; In the</B>
<BR><B>darkness, she saw a figure putting on her father's</B>
<BR><B>clothes (in the guest bedroom, her parents would sleep</B>
<BR><B>in one bed and she and her sisters would sleep in the</B>
<BR><B>other) it turned around and come towards her.&nbsp; It got</B>
<BR><B>right up in her face, it had holes where eyes should</B>
<BR><B>be and a funky malicious grin.&nbsp; She couldn't scream</B>
<BR><B>and covered up her head and never told anyone.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>scared her really badly.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Lloyd Ave.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Stayce614@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I used to live on a street called Lloyd Ave. when i was alittle bit
younger.</B>
<BR><B>The street had an old ghost story to it that everyone around there
knew. The</B>
<BR><B>story went like this:</B>
<BR><B>While the carpenter's where building the houses in the neighborhood
one of</B>
<BR><B>the carpenter's fell off of something and died. Whoever is telling
you the</B>
<BR><B>story would say that he fell while building their house, but nobody
really</B>
<BR><B>knows which house it was.</B>
<BR><B>All of the houses around where i lived had strange occurences that
nobody</B>
<BR><B>could explain. So we came to beleave that the ghost was haunting
the houses</B>
<BR><B>around the neighborhood that he helped build.</B>
<BR><B>I dont no all of the occurences that have happened around my neighborhood,</B>
<BR><B>but I do&nbsp; no some.</B>
<BR><B>In my house one day I was watching T.V.&nbsp; I decided to go upstairs
into my</B>
<BR><B>room so I went to turn the T.V off. We had a coffie table in the
middle of</B>
<BR><B>the living room where i was. Right after I walked passed the caoffie
table</B>
<BR><B>the T.V turned back on again. So not thinking of it that much i
went back to</B>
<BR><B>the couch picked up the remote and turned the T.V off again. Once
more when I</B>
<BR><B>walked past the coffie table the T.V had turned on again. I got
really</B>
<BR><B>scared, and ran upstairs to my sister and just left the T.V on.
I told her</B>
<BR><B>what happened and that I couldn't turn the T.V off. So she went
downstairs</B>
<BR><B>with me, and of course she turned the T.V off and it stayed off.
I have had</B>
<BR><B>other experiences with the T.V changing chanels. Also we have had
the</B>
<BR><B>computer and lights around the house go on or off by themselves.</B>
<BR><B>This other time I was in&nbsp; my living room, and my mom had asked
me to take</B>
<BR><B>something downstairs into the laundry room. In our house you go
straight down</B>
<BR><B>the steps and there is a hallway. Then there is a door that leads
into the</B>
<BR><B>laundry room. I went to grab the door handle to open the door, but
befor my</B>
<BR><B>hand tuched the door handle the handle turned and the door opened.&nbsp;
I&nbsp; ran</B>
<BR><B>back upstairs and told my mom that if she wanted to put something
in the</B>
<BR><B>laundry room that she would have to do it herself.</B>
<BR><B>One other time I was spending the night at my friend's house. It
was around</B>
<BR><B>eleven o'clock at night and we decided to go to this park down the
street.</B>
<BR><B>Acrost the street there is an a house that has been abanded. I dont
ever</B>
<BR><B>remember anyone ever living there when I lived in the neighborhood.
We were</B>
<BR><B>climbing on this jungle gym thing when we noticed a light on at
the house in</B>
<BR><B>an upstairs window. Everone knew that their wernt any lights at
the house,</B>
<BR><B>and even if their was their wasn't anyone there to turn them on.
We came to</B>
<BR><B>the conclusion that the ghost was visiting that house that night.</B>
<BR><B>The only other ghost experence that I can remember well was one
that one of</B>
<BR><B>my other friends told me. She said that she was in her bedroom one
day and</B>
<BR><B>this dall that was on her dresses slowly leaned over sideways and
was hanging</B>
<BR><B>off her dresser. The dall was so far over that it should of fell,
but to her</B>
<BR><B>suprise the dall just leaned their.</B>
<BR><B>This ghost that was in our houses never really did any harm to us,
but it</B>
<BR><B>seemed to like to try and scare us.</B>

<P><B>Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mrorrer@henry.k12.va.us</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am positive that the house my mother lives in is haunted.&nbsp;
We moved there</B>
<BR><B>in 1978, when I was only 6 months old.&nbsp; As long as I can remember,
a lady</B>
<BR><B>dressed in white would come into the upstairs bedroom I shared with
my</B>
<BR><B>brother.&nbsp; She would cover us up if it was cold and we had kicked
off our</B>
<BR><B>covers, or pick up the toys that were left in the middle of the
floor.</B>
<BR><B>You can't go up the stairs at night without feeling cold, or having
chills</B>
<BR><B>run up the back of your neck.</B>
<BR><B>When I entered middle school, my appearance changed.&nbsp; I cut
off my long</B>
<BR><B>hair, and started wearing tighter clothing.&nbsp; When I did this,
I could no</B>
<BR><B>longer see the lady in white.&nbsp; It was only when I let my hair
grow back out</B>
<BR><B>that I could see her again, though only out of the corner of my
eye.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>don't think she recognized me with short hair.</B>
<BR><B>I'm not the only one who has seen the ghost, several of my friends
who spent</B>
<BR><B>the night with me growing up have also seen her.</B>
<BR><B>One friend who had gone with me to the movies walked me to the door
late one</B>
<BR><B>evening, but refused to come into the house after seeing the lady.&nbsp;
To this</B>
<BR><B>day, he won't come in the house after dark.</B>
<BR><B>I know she is a benign, friendly spirit.&nbsp; As a child she seemed
to like</B>
<BR><B>being motherly to my brother and myself, but as we grew up we saw
less and</B>
<BR><B>less of her.&nbsp; We can, however, still feel her presence.</B>
<BR><B>As the story goes, there was a fire in the house around 1940, but
no one was</B>
<BR><B>in the house according to public record.&nbsp; The fire destroyed
part of the</B>
<BR><B>upstairs and down into the kitchen.&nbsp; The papers could have
been mistaken...</B>
<BR><B>at least I think they were.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Grim Past</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: patg88@pcug.org.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>In the early 1950s I worked on a newspaper in Sydney Australia and
after finishing work about 2 am would walk from a suburban railway station
to my home. It was one of the few times that the area had no traffic and
was silent. I used to notice that at one particular spot on Burwood Road,
I would hear other footsteps as though somebody was walking with me but
they would stop when I did, so I assumed that my footsteps were echoing
from slightly rising ground ahead. A few years later another friend was
talking about a haunted house that his aunt had briefly occuppied. It turned
out to be a house in Burwood Road quite near to where I had often heard
the footsteps. Later I found that a gallows had once stood quite near to
that spot and that several executions had occurred there. Co-incidence,
imagination or some freak in the way sound travels ? I don't know. But
when I first heard the footsteps I knew nothing of the area's grim past.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Anything that has happened to me has stopped (Thank</B>
<BR><B>God) or at least happens so rarely that I don't really</B>
<BR><B>notice it.</B>
<BR><B>Alright, I have had a few things happen to me.&nbsp; Most</B>
<BR><B>of it is iffy.&nbsp; Anyway, the most dramatic was what</B>
<BR><B>happened when&nbsp; I was watching tv in my mothers room.</B>
<BR><B>All of a sudden, something just fell on the bed.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>jerked my head around to look at what it was and</B>
<BR><B>nothing was there.&nbsp; Everything was in order.&nbsp; But, I</B>
<BR><B>still run out of there quick.&nbsp; This only happened</B>
<BR><B>once.&nbsp; I can relax in my mom's room, I even fallen</B>
<BR><B>asleep in there.&nbsp; Next, I have heard bumping above my</B>
<BR><B>head, my mother has never heard it, and blames it on</B>
<BR><B>the pipes.&nbsp; Lastly, I've seen flashes of light in my</B>
<BR><B>closet out of the corner of my eye or figures out of</B>
<BR><B>the corner of my eye.&nbsp; But, since I wear glasses it</B>
<BR><B>could just be a reflection of my mom or somebody.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>don't know.&nbsp; I don't really believe in ghost, though I</B>
<BR><B>do think that demons and the like exist.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway this is all that has happened to me.</B>
<BR><B>My sister says that she saw a spooky man out of her</B>
<BR><B>window once, but I think it was just her imagination,</B>
<BR><B>since nothing else has happened to her.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Probably not your most interesting story , but -</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Several years ago I lived in a two-story house in Southwest
Michigan ,</B>
<BR><B>close to the Lake. One night I couldn't sleep , so I trudged downstairs
to</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen and read the paper for about 1/2 hour. I walked back
up the</B>
<BR><B>stairs and near the top I heard my Irish Setter begin to follow
me up. I</B>
<BR><B>hadn't noticed the dog come down , but the sound of her paws and
the creaking</B>
<BR><B>stairs were unmistakeable. I could clearly hear each step she took
up the</B>
<BR><B>stairs. I called " C'mon " , reached the top and turned towards
my bed. In</B>
<BR><B>the moonlight coming thru the window , I could see my dog asleep
on the bed ,</B>
<BR><B>but still heard the steps coming up. I'm not ashamed to say I immediately
got</B>
<BR><B>goosebumps the size of baseballs. I flipped on the lights , but
nothing was</B>
<BR><B>there - or anywhere else in the house. Nothing like that ever happened
again</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>So impressed and comforted by your sight.&nbsp; I had an experience
at the Saur Dough Inn in Seward Alaska two years ago that I never share
with people anymore because they don't believe me, and felt inspired to
write after reading on your sight.</B>
<BR><B>The hotel was a brothel at the turn of the century, and the inn-keeper
will happily tell you the upper rooms are haunted by the spirits of the
girls who lived there.&nbsp; The most prevelant is The Lady in White, who
was the Madame.&nbsp; (I may be remembering the name wrong).&nbsp; But
there are a few rooms downstairs in the basement as well, an that is where
I had my encounter.</B>
<BR><B>My friend Ali and I decided to stay there because of the legends,
and had spent two nights upstairs without a peep.&nbsp; Our last night
was in the basement.&nbsp; I had a little headcold and sniffles, and the
Innkeeper advised us to keep the windows closed due to a nasty draft.&nbsp;
After securing the windows shut, we went to bed. About two hours into a
fitful sleep, I was awakened by the window creaking open.&nbsp; I thought
it was odd, since we had latched it.&nbsp; The window being to my left,
I was staring at it when I realised there was a woman in white standing
next to the bed.&nbsp; (This is typically where people stop believing me)&nbsp;
She noticed me notice her, and reached out to feel my forehead.&nbsp; She
was also holding what looked like a towel in her right hand, and was smiling
in the most comforting way.&nbsp; I couldn't help it though - I reached
out and shook Ali awake, looked back - and she was still there!&nbsp; Ali
fumbled to focus and then I screamed - like nothing I have ever hear</B>
<BR><B>I think she was checking and making sure I was okay, and here's
the interesting thing, too - when we finally woke up, and got our bearings,
we realised the room was way too hot and even smelled a little funny.&nbsp;
We had left our propane lantern on.&nbsp; I think that's why she opened
the window.</B>
<BR><B>Ah.&nbsp; I feel better.&nbsp; It is a beautiful, magical place
to stay.&nbsp; If I ever return, I have every intension - there was no
malice in her visit.&nbsp; I only hope I can not scream at her if I ever
see her again.</B>

<P><B>Warning Dream</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tms2002@optonline.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had a dream that I was asleep in my dream when I hear my mom calling
me to come look out the living room window. I awoke in my dream and ran
to see why my mom was calling me. As I looked out the window there were
these little boys trying to put my boyfriend's car on fire. He had left
the back window open and they kept throwing lit matches into the car but
the match would burn out before it would land on the seat. All of a sudden
a woman appeared and was yelling at the boys to stop. My mother and I were
also screaming for the boys to stop. The last thing I did in my dream was
scream for my boyfriend to wake up because some little boys were trying
to put his car on fire. I awoke from my dream when the phone rang at around
6am. It was my boyfriend calling to tell me that as he was leaving for
his early morning fishing trip when he noticed that someone had stabbed
his tires and gave him four flats. I could not believe that my dream let
me know that his car was in danger.</B>

<BR><B>Unsettling Presence</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: nancyblue@juno.com</B><B></B>

<BR><B>apartment since my exhusband moved out last November.&nbsp; It was
almost as</B>
<BR><B>if the dwelling itself warned me away from crossing into particular
rooms</B>
<BR><B>or areas of the apartment.&nbsp; There had been times when I could
not sleep</B>
<BR><B>in my own bedroom because it was located near the rear of the</B>
<BR><B>apartment--I was afraid to go past the middle hallway.&nbsp; One
night I came</B>
<BR><B>up to get a jacket while my boyfriend was waiting outside for me
in the</B>
<BR><B>car.&nbsp; I got as far as one foot in the doorway and felt the
overwhelming</B>
<BR><B>presence and some sense telling me to turn around and get out NOW.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>forgot about the jacket and ran back downstairs and outside.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I hadn't had one of those experiences in some time until

<BR><B>her spirits and her Lord Phoenix. She is a Phoenix Witch, which
she</B>
<BR><B>explains to me as someone who has crossed over, was offered a second</B>
<BR><B>chance at life but with the cost of helping less fortunate souls
find</B>
<BR><B>their way back to Heaven.&nbsp; My boyfriend was there at the time
as well.</B>
<BR><B>When she was about finished with her reading, I happened to glance
over</B>
<BR><B>by my computer in the dining room...and saw a small, round, blurry
"ball"</B>
<BR><B>floating past the computer and disappearing before it reached my
living</B>
<BR><B>room (where we were doing the reading).</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.&nbsp;
I had to use the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom, which was located near the bedroom.&nbsp; As I went to
get up and</B>
<BR><B>glanced in that direction of the apartment, I had that overwhelming</B>
<BR><B>feeling to stay back away from there again!&nbsp; I asked her what
was over</B>
<BR><B>there and she went into the middle hallway with the candle.&nbsp;
She came</B>
<BR><B>back with an angry expression, saying that the "thing" called her
an</B>
<BR><B>"abomination".&nbsp; She felt it referred to her being brought back
and given</B>
<BR><B>a second chance at life.&nbsp; She felt the presence was jealous
and hurt.</B>
<BR><B>She called me over to join her in the "exorcism" of this spirit.&nbsp;
When</B>
<BR><B>she asked it repeatedly to leave, we both HEARD it (in a strong,
emphatic</B>
<BR><B>male voice) say "NO!"&nbsp; I was so scared! What scared me even
more was that</B>
<BR><B>my boyfriend declared out of the blue, "Someone died in your bathroom."</B>
<BR><B>What?&nbsp; "Yes, someone died in your shower.&nbsp; I knew about
it since the</B>
<BR><B>first time I showered here."</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I decided it was not wise to sleep alone at my place that
night, so as I</B>
<BR><B>went into my bedroom with both friends to pack, we noticed that
things in</B>
<BR><B>my room had been disturbed, moved around.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; When we moved into the bathroom to get my toiletries,
my boyfriend</B>
<BR><B>proceeded to tell me how the person died (slipped and fell in the
shower,</B>
<BR><B>broken neck...).&nbsp; I couldn't take anymore and left that night.&nbsp;
That was</B>
<BR><B>the last time I had my bestfriend do any readings here without her
spirit</B>
<BR><B>protection!</B><B></B>

<P><B>UK Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Becky</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My name is Becky, I am 20 and live in West Yorkshire, England. When
telling my experiences to those who weren't there when they happened, it
usually takes around 3 hours to tell all, so I guess I better condense
it a little. Like many people on this sight, I have grown up with supernatural
goings on, and, again like many people, I don't have time to tell you them
all.</B>
<BR><B>I'll tell you about when I was 17 and living with two friends in
a dingy rented terrace in EarlsHeaton, Dewsbury. My two friends, C (female)
&amp; D (male), and I all moved into this place together. They were a couple
so they shared the master room and I had the spare room. I won't bother
going into explanation except for the 'spot' which I'll explain in a minute.
the house was horrible, it was tiny and cramped and damp. with it being
a terrace I am guessing it was around 100 years old, most terraces in west
Yorkshire are all from around that period. So, the 'spot' was just outside
the bathroom door. as you walked up the staircase there was a tiny, TINY
landing area (only about 8ft long) which housed my bedroom door first,
then the masterbedroom, which was right next to the bathroom. So the bathroom
and bedroom doors made like an L shape to each other. After been in there
for only a matter of days I was in by myself, on the toilet. the bathroom
door didn't shut properly, and there was no lock, so I never liked going
to the bathroom in that house because of privacy reasons. Anyway, so I'm
on the toilet when all of a sudden someone starts dashing up the stairs
and RUNS HEAVILY straight towards the bathroom door. Straight away (the
bathroom was so tiny I was in arms reach of the door handle) I extended
my arm to grab the door so either C &amp; D didn't burst in. In the few
seconds that these footsteps were charging towards the bathroom I thought
one of them must have come home and was bursting for the toilet, that's
why they were legging it. I called out "C, D, I'm in here, don't come in!"
The footsteps got to the bathroom door and.... SILENCE. I called out both
their names again and, when there was no reply, I knew. I'd been through
haunting enough in my life to know when to get the hell out of there. So
I did, then when they both arrived home I told them that someone ran up
the stairs and towards the bathroom. Even though they're both believers
they were insistent that it would have been next door, but because the
walls are so thin it sounds like its closer. I argued that I'm not bloody
def and that I know the difference between someone running up our stairs
and next door's, but we agreed to disagree and the subject was closed.
Until more things started happening, that is. C &amp; D got the brunt of
the action because there bedroom is right next to the bathroom and it seemed
to be that area that had a lot of activity, throughout a matter of months
things just began to reach new heights with them. By this point I had moved
out for a while and the things I was hearing from them started to become
disturbing. Both of them had nightmares that they were being held down
in their beds, light bulbs would frequently smash and fall on C's head,
sounds like heavy furniture could be heard moving around in the cellar,
they both became constantly ill etc. and as time went on, things got worse.
I got a call from D, the male, a long time friend of mine who would always
be the first to look for a rational explanation. He said that he had woke
up at around 2/3am to see a ball of light on the bedroom wall. His first
instinct was that it was a burglar shining a torch in so he woke C. By
the time that she had woken up the light had gone from the wall and not
there was a bright light shining through the cracks of their closed bedroom
door, coming from the 'spot' on the landing. After a short amount of time
D got out of bed and opened the door, ready to bravely confront who ever
it was breaking in. When he opened the door he said there was a bright
light shining into their room but the landing light was off. The light
then disappeared and they were both left in darkness again. Ever the sceptic
D was still convinced that they had a burglar and he got C up and they
went to check downstairs. Everything was as normal. By now they had turned
all the lights on in the landing, bedroom etc. and decided they would try
and get back to sleep and think about it in the morning. The climbed the
stairs to go back to bed and saw the impossible. The bathroom door was
shut. It COULDN'T shut! I used to live there, I know. It was shut and D
said to C "there's someone hiding in the bathroom". he went to open the
door but it WOULDN'T OPEN! They said it was like someone was holding the
handle from the inside. At this point they stopped denying a break-in and
realised they had to face up to the fact that there was something beyond
their control going on in their house, so they had a sleepless night back
in their room, holding onto each other. The next morning, they opened their
bedroom door and the bathroom door was wide open, as usual. The worst,
final blow happened several months after that. now THIS is impossible.
C &amp; D were getting ready for a night out and C was getting ready in
the bathroom. She had brought her camera out of the bedroom and put it
outside the bathroom door (on the 'spot') so that she wouldn't forget to
take it out. Anyway, C being C, she did forget and went out without it.
She, D, and about 5 friends all got back to their house that night to find
the camera downstairs with three pictures taken. After asking everyone
if they had moved it, all said no. So she got the pictures developed. What
we found (I was there to view them before they got burnt) was spine-chilling.
Three pictures were taken with her camera while everyone was out, they
were all of their bedroom door taken from different angles, when you put
the three pictures together it made one big, bitty picture of the crack
in their door and the handle. at first we thought this has got to be a
prank and lamely tried to think of who would do that to them, then we decided
to try it out for ourselves, as one of the pictures seemed to be 'looking
down' on the door from the space above the stairs. so we did an experiment.
we took the camera to that area and tried to 're-take' the pictures that
were taken. it was impossible. you would have had to be 'floating' above
the staires to have got one of them, and the rest were in such awkward
angles it was a bugger to manuvour, no-one would have got to that trouble
for a joke- if there'd been anyone in, that is! to this day it still seems
unreal but we were all a witness to it. C &amp; D moved out swiftly after
the photos were taken and even now, I would NEVER go back into that place
by myself. I am addicted to this web-site, so no doubt i will be back on
with my other experiences again soon. Take care.</B><B></B>

<P><B>3 Short Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: B_Durette@msn.com</B>
<BR><B>A bucket of water splashing over my father.</B><B></B>

<P><B>We lived on a farm in Florida and our house was really big. I was
always scared to be there by myself. Well anyway I was 8 yrs old at the
time. My sisters, brother and myself was sitting in front of my father
and mother. We were watching some kind of movie that night when all of
suddenly a bucket of water flown over my father and tilted over him causing
him to get wet. We all jump up and the bucket drop to the floor. My father
was mad and thought it was one of us. So he told everyone to stay put and
finding out that none of us ever got up during the movie.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My father seen his mother walking through the field with a cane.</B>
<BR><B>I was outside playing with my brother and sister one day, my mother
was in the house and my father was in the fields cropping. I turn to see
if I could see him and I saw him running like crazy toward the house. When
he got to the house I asked him what was wrong. He told us that he seen
his mother walking through the field with a cane and she was wearing a
white dress. I'm like ok and he told me that she still lives in Puerto
Rico. We at the moment lived in Florida. So he's like something is wrong
and he goes to the phone and calls her and he found out that she just past
away that day. Is that weird or what.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My father coming back after death.</B>
<BR><B>I was ten when my father was in a accident and pasted away. I remember
a couple of&nbsp; night after the accident we were trying to sleep and
all we heard was things moving around. We never heard anything before until
after my father past away. I remember it so clearly. I was laying down
on the bed and while I heard the noises getting closer I felt someone sitting
on my bed next to me. I opened my eyes slowly and no one was there but
I still can feel someone there.&nbsp; I just kept in mind it was my father
giving me comfort and letting me know it was alright. The next morning
I went to the bathroom and I found my father clothe on top of the toilet
like he always had when he took a shower. I asked my mother if she took
his clothe out and put it on the toilet. I though maybe she was getting
rid of them.&nbsp; Specially after hearing him in the house for a couple
of days. She said no and that she just woke up and started breakfast for
us. So she walked to the bathroom and there his clothe was on top of the
toilet seat. We think it was my father that put his clothe there that night.
Things like his stuff moving around the bathroom and feeling his present.&nbsp;
My mother call the pastor from church to spray holy water and to guide
him to the light. Since that day we never heard him again. The only thing
happened after that was that he was in our dreams.</B><B></B>

<P><B>There was Something in our House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Stacy@canddvisionaryinc.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in the same house for all of my
childhood and have always</B>
<BR><B>had strange, creepy, "somebody is watching me" feelings in our home.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>lived in a nice, although small home in a quiet neighborhood in</B>
<BR><B>Whittier, CA. I always wondered about the previous owners and what
they</B>
<BR><B>must have been like...they had the same last name as ours...Anyway,</B>
<BR><B>things were always happening....faces appearing in mirrors, windows,</B>
<BR><B>items were moved from one room to the next, strange noises, hissing,</B>
<BR><B>talking, rattling windows and doors...</B>
<BR><B>I had asked my Mom if she knew anything about the previous owners
and my</B>
<BR><B>maternal Grandmother said, "Yes, they died in your bedroom.." I
guess</B>
<BR><B>they were both alcoholics and weren't very happy people. My Mom
said</B>
<BR><B>they were heavily involved in the Occult and had heard that they
held</B>
<BR><B>s&eacute;ances regularly in the house. I told my Mom many times
about a</B>
<BR><B>recurring dream I had in which I was an infant and a strange man
came</B>
<BR><B>into my room went to my closet, opened it, and took a small box
out from</B>
<BR><B>the beneath the floor boards....My Mom stared at me for a moment
and</B>
<BR><B>then said, "honey, that really happened..." I guess just after my
Mom</B>
<BR><B>and Dad brought me home from the hospital and my Dad had gone back
to</B>
<BR><B>work my Mom had put me down for a nap and gone to take a nice hot</B>
<BR><B>bath...While in the bathroom she decided to shave her legs and heard
the</B>
<BR><B>front door open, thinking it was my Father she called out to him,
but a</B>
<BR><B>stranger answered her...."I need to get something out of the closet
in</B>
<BR><B>the next room" he said..."I don't know you and my newborn daughter
is</B>
<BR><B>asleep in there, get what you need but if you touch her I will kill</B>
<BR><B>you." my Mom replied. "I won't hurt anyone, I will just get what
I need</B>
<BR><B>and leave." Then he got what he came for, said thank you and left.
My</B>
<BR><B>Mom said she had got out of the tub and threw on some sweats and
first</B>
<BR><B>ran in to check on me then ran outside but there was nobody</B>
<BR><B>there....Many, many things happened in our home and still do.</B>
<BR><B>I moved out 10 years ago but my sister still lives there and still
feels</B>
<BR><B>strange things almost daily. I married and my Husband and I stayed
there</B>
<BR><B>during the holidays a few years back and came home from a party
where he</B>
<BR><B>had a few drinks. As soon as we got out of the car he lost all the
color</B>
<BR><B>in his face and looked up towards the corner where there is a stop
sign.</B>
<BR><B>It was about 1 a.m. in the morning and he said, "Do you see that
little</B>
<BR><B>boy riding the bike on the corner?" I said, "What the hell are you</B>
<BR><B>talking about?" scared I stained to see if I could see anything...nope.</B>
<BR><B>He said, "Right there a boy with blonde hair and peddle pushers
riding</B>
<BR><B>the bike?" I freaked out and went into the house. He came inside
and we</B>
<BR><B>went out to the patio to sleep and got into bed. the patio is a
garden</B>
<BR><B>room with lots of windows and no curtains. He was just about to
lay down</B>
<BR><B>when he sat upright and said, "Oh my now the boy is sitting on the
fence</B>
<BR><B>outside..." I went to wake up my Mom and asked her if she had ever
seen</B>
<BR><B>a blonde boy around she said no but that doesn't mean he is not</B>
<BR><B>there....I always wonder about that neighborhood...</B>

<P><B>The Woman of the Woods</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:bethhowarth@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>this event is true and happened when i was 9 years old. It was the
night of November 12th, my birthday.&nbsp; Me and my friends were walking
back from the bowling alley to my house for a sleep over. {the bowling
alley was only 10 minutes away.} anyway,</B>
<BR><B>on the way back my friend matt dared me to go in the middle of the
woods without my flashlight.&nbsp; i went in and came out 10 minutes later.&nbsp;
all my friends had terrified looks on they're faces. "what?" i asked. matt
pointed behind me. when i turned around a 5 ft. tall woman in a white dress
with black hair was standing there!.&nbsp; she looked really mad. we ran
as fast as we could. we finally got to the house and jumped in our sleeping
bags. no one moved and we all eventually fell asleep.&nbsp; i awoke at
3:00 in the morning to go get a glass of water. i had totally forget about
the incident until i stopped and heard very, very heavy breathing behind
me.&nbsp; i thought it was my dog but when i turned around, it was her!&nbsp;
she had the same look on her face. i screamed as loud as i could and my
friends came running down the hall asking me what happened. i told them
and we all went back in the room and stayed up until the next day.&nbsp;
i told my mom what happened but she didn't believe me. that is until she
found my pet snake dead and she started seeing strands of long black hair
all over the house. we moved out shortly after that and i will never go
back to that house again, let alone look at it. I still find black hair
in my bed sometimes. even though were at our new house and there's no one
in my family with black hair. i think she is following me. maybe trying
to tell me something.&nbsp; on rare occasions i will be playing my drum
set when all the sudden i stop and hear mumbling and groaning.</B>
<BR><B>if i ever have an encounter with this ghost again i will send it
asap. thank you.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Old Cannery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: morag@moragmckenzie.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I work in an old salmon cannery in Vancouver, BC.&nbsp; The cannery
was built in</B>
<BR><B>1894 and was used in some capacity until 1979.&nbsp; It's now a
national historic</B>
<BR><B>site and museum.</B>
<BR><B>The site is definitely an industrial one.&nbsp; When the cannery
was in</B>
<BR><B>operation, there were lots of rather dangerous machines about, and
we have</B>
<BR><B>many stories of injuries and a few of deaths.&nbsp; We do know that
where our</B>
<BR><B>office building stands now was once the site of one of the mess
halls, and</B>
<BR><B>when it burned down there were about fifteen people trapped inside.&nbsp;
More</B>
<BR><B>than one person has told me about strange experiences in that building,
but</B>
<BR><B>I've not had the chance to experience them.&nbsp; Meanwhile, in
the actual</B>
<BR><B>cannery, the only specific death we know of is that of a four- or</B>
<BR><B>five-year-old girl who fell into the acid bath used to clean oil
and guts</B>
<BR><B>from the outside of the salmon cans.</B>
<BR><B>We close the museum to the public at 5 pm every day, and then have
a list of</B>
<BR><B>jobs to carry out to shut down the site for the evening.&nbsp; We
don't get out</B>
<BR><B>of the building until 5.20 or so.&nbsp; I have been on the closing
crew pretty</B>
<BR><B>much regularly for the last three weeks and every night at the same
time,</B>
<BR><B>just as we're about to set the alarm, we hear a sound from the north
end of</B>
<BR><B>the building.&nbsp; It sounds like someone dropping a heavy box,
which then</B>
<BR><B>spills its contents all over the floor.&nbsp; We've called out and
watched the</B>
<BR><B>spot where the noise comes from, without seeing anything or getting
a</B>
<BR><B>response.&nbsp; The alarm has never been set off, and since there
are motion</B>
<BR><B>sensors this suggests to me the noises are not being made by anything
human.</B>
<BR><B>Also, at the other end of the building there is a spot about 20'
square</B>
<BR><B>where a number of staff have felt chills, the sensation of being
watched,</B>
<BR><B>hair rising on the back of the neck, and so forth.&nbsp; Yesterday
a mother was</B>
<BR><B>carrying her three-year-old daughter through this area and the child</B>
<BR><B>suddenly burst into tears, screaming and kicking.&nbsp; She calmed
down</B>
<BR><B>immediately as soon as they were out of the area.</B>
<BR><B>The noise from the north end of the building doesn't feel threatening,
but</B>
<BR><B>the second one feels decidedly malicious.&nbsp; Lately something
has also been</B>
<BR><B>mysteriously causing our computers, lights, and A/V equipment to</B>
<BR><B>malfunction.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: judy@canniffe60.fslife.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Lee, I am 30 and I live in Scotland. I want to tell you
about something that happened to me and a friend when we were about 12
or 13.</B>
<BR><B>There was an old man ( a good old man ) who lived in the same block
as me. This man was about 75 and was always full of stories about the war
and the older days.</B>
<BR><B>By the way I dont think it would be right of me to mention other
peoples names without their permission.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway the old man was hit by a van and killed instantly and i think
the driver was done with drunk driving.</B>
<BR><B>This is where things get a bit strange</B>
<BR><B>I dont know how much time later ( about 1 to 2 years later)</B>
<BR><B>we were both walking along the road and walking towards the point
where ----- had been killed when he suddenly appeared.I turned around to
my mate and said"Do you see that" .</B>
<BR><B>These were my exact words.</B>
<BR><B>My mate turned to me and said "Its ----- ------"</B>
<BR><B>He repeated the name of the person i had just seen.</B>
<BR><B>We both turned round and there was nobody there and my mate jumped
out his skin and ran away home.</B>
<BR><B>I remember both of us later that day telling our parents and both
of us getting into trouble for making up stories.</B>
<BR><B>I lost touch with my old mate and have never spoken to him since(i
sometimes think that we both avoided each other after what happened).</B>
<BR><B>Finally i would like to say that to this day i have no idea what
happened.</B>
<BR><B>For one young boy to have this experience can be put down to an
hallucination but for two&nbsp; to share it at the same time</B>
<BR><B>is creepy.</B>
<BR><B>If anyone can give some insight please do.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Girl Standing Over Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pknowles15@comcast.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi my name is Amber Thompson. It happened
a couple of months ago while I was staying at (a friends). I was sleeping
on the couch and I could hear some one breathing loudly. When I opened
my eyes I saw a young girl standing over me. I thought it was my friend
because it was dark and I was tired. I told her to leave me alone and to
go back to sleep. Then she faded away slowly. The next morning I asked
my friend what she wanted when she woke me up, and she had no idea what
I was talking about!!! So I even asked her mom and dad they thought I was
crazy. I haven't seen her/him/it whatever it was since. But I know that
what I saw was no illusion.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Girl On the Phone</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Sevillafam5@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Recently I had been calling my friend mandy on th phone. I couldn't
get a hold of her because&nbsp; she was talking to her cousin. I was about
to dial her phone number when my phone started to ring. A whole bunch of
static rolled in. A little girl answered the phone in a really faint voice.
" Hello?" she answered. " Hello? Is anyone there?!" I asked sarcasticly.
all the static rolled out. and the phone was dead. I charged it up and
called mandy. I asked that is she had a voice mail where a little girl
that asweres the phone and hung up without a tone. She said no. She said
that she didn't even HAVE a voice mail!" Are you sure??" Mandy asked. I
said I was positive. So I believe that it was a lost girl, a ghost, a spirit,
the after world.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Followers</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gokoa@core.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It all started about six months ago, my three year old son started
seeing ghosts.&nbsp; Not the boogie man in the closet or under the bed
but real ghosts.&nbsp; One day in early spring as I was packing for a weekend
trip to a friends house I was about to take my son informed me that he
had to go to the bathroom, ok no problem, just as he's done so many times
before I told him to go down the stairs from our rooms and go to the bathroom.&nbsp;
I heard him thudding down the stairs as usual and the little running footsteps
thru the house.&nbsp; As I was finishing packing thinking of what we would
do that weekend I heard the most terrifying sound I have ever heard in
my entire life.&nbsp; My son was screaming, not just any scream, but the
kind of scream that makes your blood run cold and your heart hit the floor.&nbsp;
I heard him running and falling as I was hurling myself trying to get down
the stairs to him.&nbsp; As we reached each other at the bottom of the
stairs he was hysterical, he was shaking and crying and it took me the
better part of an hour for him to tell me what had happened to him.&nbsp;
When he had approached the bathroom he heard something, then he said someone
was knocking on the basement door, and as our house is set up the entrance
to the basement is right in the bathroom.I asked him to repeat what he
had said and he said someone was knocking on the basement door.&nbsp; He
then told me that he heard a little girl talking to him thru the door and
she was trying to get him to let her out.&nbsp; He then said ' mommy, I
know that nobody lives down there, it probably was a ghost.'&nbsp; I know
that I looked horrified and I was, because of what only one person knew
of that had happened about ten years before.&nbsp; I had heard that same
thing when I was a kid in that very same house at that very same door.&nbsp;
A little girl had cried for help from her mother and had asked me to please
let her out.&nbsp; I totally freaked and told my aunt whose house it is
we live in.&nbsp; I think she thought I was crazy and after so many years
I began to beleive it was true, and eventually all was forgotten, until
now.&nbsp; For months after that my son would have to be accompanied to
the bathroom, he was now afraid to go on his own.&nbsp; Always afraid that
the little girl would come back, and to be honest even I was a bit uneasy
to go in there to.&nbsp; Nothing happened for awhile and I assumed that
it was all over,until about a month ago.&nbsp; One morning I awoke to find
that my son had at some point in the night gotten into my bed.&nbsp; I
asked him what was the matter and he then asked me a question that still
haunts me, he asked me why did the little ghost girl follow me around the
house and how could she do that if she was dead.&nbsp; I was to scared
to answer.&nbsp; How do you answer that?&nbsp; Then he said something else,
he told me that last night he had seen her mommy and daddy standing over
the bed watching us sleep and that is what had scared him.&nbsp; They wanted
to know where their liitle girl was and that they needed to find her now.&nbsp;
I didn't know what to do, people were starting to think I was nuts.&nbsp;
Things went on this way a little while, there would be sightings of her
and then her parents and then things started to happen.&nbsp; The rooms
would be cold on scorching hot days and we would both hear footsteps all
around the house when nobody but us was home.&nbsp; My son would not be
left in any room alone or even sleep in his bed because he said that's
when her parents would watch him and demand to know where she was.&nbsp;
Then one day it just stopped.&nbsp; To afraid to ask my son for fear I
would provoke his fear againg I waited it out.&nbsp; And just last week
he out of the blue just said the ghosts went home because they had found
their little girl.&nbsp; Maybe they did, I don't know, but I do know that
I still hear footsteps sometimes, and the rooms still get cold.&nbsp; But
as long as he is no longer afraid I will leave well enough alone, maybe
all they really wanted was their little girl back.</B>

<P><B>The Brick Estate and Others</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: RGAGNE2@maine.rr.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I am a true ghost beleiver. I've always been really interested
in Ghosts, and when we moved to this huge Brick Mansion it got me wondering.
About a year ago, My parents and I moved here to this Brick estate. It
is beautiful. The staircase was imported from Italy, and it's huge. We
have a library, and even a music room. The house is the most geourgous
home you'll ever see, but one of the scariest homes you'll ever see. Long
dark halls, Dark hidden stairways, dark rooms in the old maids quarters.
It's scary. My whole 15 years of my life, I have been so scared of ghosts,
and I still am. Everytime I'm alone I think of them. Just their looks.
They stand there quie,&nbsp; tall, and wide eyed! Just knowing they're
dead and there walking around standing before you. I thought of Ghosts
in the house because it's so old. We saw a picture of it the year it was
built. It was still beautiful! Well anyways, A couple days with moving
into the house, We had a House party for all of our friends to visit the
new home. My aunt went up to her room, and the door was slighly open. As
she went to grab the door nob, the door harshly slammed. She screamed in
such horror everyone ran upstairs. You should have seen the tears running
down this womans face. I was also terrified. First thing I thought. Ghosts.
She had to leave with her husband she was in so much shock. I had trouble
sleeping thinking of the ghosts, but nothing ended up happening. The next
experience happened exactly two days later when I was walking my dog. The
house is down a long driveway, and it sits alone. I walk my dog on the
road my driveway starts. As I was coming back down the driveway, I seriously
just stopped. It was like all the color and feeling in my face just totally
dripped off of my face. I saw the perfect sillouhette of a tall man standing
perfectly straight in the guestroom window. There was a slight light shining
through the guestroom door from the dim lamp in the hall. I wouldn't even
go in the house. I called my Mom from the cell phone in the car, but she
was asleep (for it was about 9:30.) I sat outide in the car until about
11:00 until my Dad came home. I explained to him what happened and he just
kind of shrugged it off. I came in, but I said I want to sleep on the floor
in their room, so I did. After that night, I could really feel a pressence
in the upstairs rooms. It was so strong, my Parents admitted they could
feel it to. My dog would never go in any of the bedrooms except for my
parents, and she wouldn't go in the basement either. It felt like someone
if pushing on your chest. It feels weird. Little things started happening,
like doors would slightly open and close by themselves. I got used to it
but still was terrified. I actually got the courage to stay home alone
at night when my Parents went to a Superbowl part down the road. I refused
to go upstairs. I was watching TV when the lights started to dim and rise.
That scared me alone. Then I heard light footsteps above that would walk,
then stop, then take a couple more steps than stop again. I ran out of
the house and went to the end of my driveway and sat there in tears. I
would not go back to that house until my parents got home. I waited for
hours. My parents came home, and totally beleived me. They said they were
going to do something about it. My Dad came in the home and just said "Please
leave this home.... etc". The events totally died down. I got used to the
pressence and really didn't fear it very much. We still hear footsteps
late at night every once in a while, but the spirits here don't bother
us. Neighbors have told us plenty of times that many wealthy families used
to live their. None of them were bad. We don't fear them anymore, because
they have no where to go. If they feel comftorble here, there welcome and
they can stay for as long as they want. It still is their house.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Tell Me this ain't Freaky</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: p.p.stephens@worldnet.att.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a really freaky story that my friend told me, and it's 100%
fact. I live in Columbia, South Carolina, and downtown near the fairgrounds
there is an abandoned mill. The legend (and fact) about this mill takes
place about a hundred or so years ago, when children worked to help pay
the bills. The children sent to the mill were forced to work so hard that
several died of exhaustion. The owner of the mill was a truly evil man.
Instead of burying the dead children, he threw them in the incinerator.
The mill was shut down and abandoned, condemned to rust and dilapidate.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
night, my friends Heather, Jessica, and Nick decided they wanted a glimpse
at the spiritual world, so they went around to different places, trying
to find evidence of ghosts. They eventually went to the abandoned mill.
Heather immediately got a bad vibe about the place. She got sick twice,
advising the others they should go. But they ignored her warning, their
curiosity peaked. Nick jumped the gate with warnings signs nailed all over
it, saying he wanted to touch the tower. Jessica and Heather watched him
run to the tower, touch it, and rush back. At first it was all fun and
games, until Heather noticed the blood on Nick's palms. He didn't have
a scratch on his body.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three decided
that this excitement wasn't enough and decided to try and go inside. They
walked around the entire building, checking all the doors, but they were
locked. Heather then noticed a light on inside the tower. She knew this
was virtually impossible, since the power to the mill had been cut for
years. Nick suggested they try the doors again after Heather pointed out
the light, and this time, they were all open. They started to freak out.
What was going on? Was somebody pulling a practical joke? But their suspicions
were soon proven wrong, as the most impossible thing of all happened next.
The incinerator suddenly came to life.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heather decided that
enough was enough and insisted that they leave, but Nick and Jessica had
not yet had their fill of excitement. They wanted to go investigate. Heather
refused to go. So they asked her to stand watch, since tresspassing is
illegal. She reluctantly agreed and watched them set off for the incinerator,
when a shadowy figure on the bridge not far away caught her eye. She turned
and cried out. It was the figure of a man, but she could see right through
him! She screamed to Nick and Jessica, and they finally decided it was
time to leave. As they were walking quickly back towards their car, Nick
stopped short. Heather and Jessica turned to see what was wrong. Nick was
looking down in surprise at his arm. There were red marks, as if someone
had gripped it tightly. No one had touched him. The girls found the exact
same marks in the exact same places on their arms as well, and Heather
made another impossible discovery. There were bloody red scratches on her
side! Heather did not remember feeling anything touch her on that part
of her body. Now the three were panicked. They began running to the car.
Suddenly, they heard a noise behind them. It was a large black man on a
bicycle. They stopped, not knowing whether this man was a mugger or a spirit.
But he simply rode by them. The only remark he made was "Good morning!".
This was appropriate, as it was in the wee hours of the morning, but after
the events they had experianced only moments ago, they were ready to get
home. They left and vowed never to return...during the night, that is.</B>
<BR><B>*A back up of facts: The story of the abandoned mill is indeed true,
and can be found in most South Carolina history books. Ghosts are a frequent
thing here. I know several people who have ghosts in their homes, including
my ex-best friend, who's oldest brother used to play with the young toddler
ghost in her grandmother's house as a child. Indeed, when I was visiting
the spirit threw a temper, throwing the top of the trash can across the
kitchen floor. No one was anywhere near the trash can when it happened.
How do you like my story? I have plenty more, a few from the "ghost gang",
as I have come to call my three friends mentioned in the story above, some
involving myself, and several about the ghosts in Charleston and Columbia,
including the famous hitch hiker ghost. E-mail me at www.partyangel420.net
if you have a story of your own, or if you would like to know about the
ghosts in South Carolina. I hope you have enjoyed my story.</B>

<P><B>Strange Things in my House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Evilnoodlee@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when i was about 15 we
moved to a big old house in east london my mother had recently inherited
it from an aunt who had just died, the house needed an awful lot of repair
work carried out but mum who had recently been made redundant, sort of
made the restorations a pet project.&nbsp; Anyway i had always felt a bit
uneasy there so i wasnt very pleased about the move but seeing mums enthusiasm
about it all especially after she had been a bit depressed since losing
her job i bit my lip and said nothing.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the
moment we moved in it was obvious that something wasnt right,the</B>
<BR><B>house had a cold oppressive atmosphere and ever read the amityville
horror? well just like george lutz never being able to get warm, it was
exactly the same even after spending thousands of pounds on a brand new
heating system. Sometimes it would get so cold your hands and feet would
actually hurt. Our dog point blank refused to even enter certain rooms
and when the house was quiet i swear you could hear really fast gibbering
and chattering, dad by now (whom i might add is a huge sceptic) was also
beginning to have serious doubts about the house and tried to persuade
mum to sell, after all huge old houses like that sell for an asolute fortune
in london. Mum however went mental at the suggestion which was highly unusual
in itself as mum was usually a very placid person.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strange occurences were now becoming
commonplace and i have to admit that i started dreading coming home from
school.Friends had long since stopped visiting in fact many of them had
visited just once before making their excuses and leaving and always had
an excuse at the ready as to why they couldnt come over when asked.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this went on for about 8 months before
things came to a head, one evening whilst watching tv, the dog who even
though only 5 years old at this point had been ailing for some time,became
almost hysterical,barking at a particular spot(where i often felt unbearably
cold)then he seemed to have some kind of fit his eyes were rolling and
he began slavering dad rushed him to the car to the vet whilst mum and
i stayed at home, big mistake!! the electricity went and we were left in
almost complete darkness</B>
<BR><B>the walls started rattling and there was an eerie howling reverberating
around the house. i was crying and mum by now was actually smiling saying
"i knew youd come"over and over this went on until dad came back and found
mum in this weird trance like state and me huddled in the corner still
crying.Dad dragged us both out and in the instant we were out of the house
mum snapped out of her weird state and also began crying that night we
stayed with gran,dad hired someone to empty the house of our belongings
and we never set foot in the place again. sam our dog fully returned to
his previous good health,and to this day mum doesnt know who she was talking
to or what she meant during her strange trance,in fact we sold the house
to a property developer and dont even talk about it any more.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Strange Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: unearthlyempire@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am Eighteen years old and live in Aloha, Oregon. Although Ghots
and the</B>
<BR><B>like have always intrigued me, I've never encountered or experienced
them.</B>
<BR><B>Some members of my family have though.</B>
<BR><B>#1 A few years ago My Grandmother and two Aunts were driving home
from a</B>
<BR><B>christmas eve service late at night. They were passing by a cemetery
a few</B>
<BR><B>miles from my house when they saw the figure of a man standing over
one of</B>
<BR><B>the graves. As I've heard, they could see him clearly even though
it was</B>
<BR><B>dark, and he himself was very white in appearance. They have never
seen</B>
<BR><B>again since.</B>
<BR><B>#2 I have two cousins who lived at a Youth Facility in Salem, and
frequently</B>
<BR><B>visiting them, they tell us about the hauntings there. On one of
the girl's</B>
<BR><B>dorms there is a bed that whoever sleeps in it always claims to
hear a voice</B>
<BR><B>telling them to kill their self. And a girl my cousin knew did try
to kill</B>
<BR><B>herself after staying in that bed.</B>
<BR><B>#3 On another of the cottages, my younger cousin describes a black
shadow</B>
<BR><B>moving down the hallway outside her room, which disappears when
it hits the</B>
<BR><B>wall. And the staff decribe going to the basement to retrieve items
and</B>
<BR><B>having doors slam or hearing footsteps. The cabinents in their kitchenette</B>
<BR><B>have opened and closed on their own.</B>
<BR><B>#4 Just recently my aunt in Tacoma had a "guest" for a few weeks.
She woke</B>
<BR><B>up one night to hear noises in her kitchen. (She lives in a two-bedroom</B>
<BR><B>second floor apartment) She grabbed her baseball bat and went to
check them</B>
<BR><B>out, only finding the stuff on her counters rearranged. A few nights
later</B>
<BR><B>she woke up to find a man standing over her bed looking at her.
He's very</B>
<BR><B>harmless and seems content with moving things around in her kitchen
and</B>
<BR><B>walking around her apartment at night. Although he seems to have
disappeared</B>
<BR><B>since July and she hasn't heard or seen him since.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Shadow</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jacquie5787@hotmail.com]</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm only 13 years old, but i've had a few experiances with the paranormal.</B>
<BR><B>First off, there is, and always has been, this odd imprint on the
carpet in my hallway of a person. i think a woman, because it seems as
if it has hair. My family is the first to live in this house, so i don't
think this is a previous owner, or resident. When i was younger, maybe
around 6 or 7, i used to see things in that hallway. I always saw people,
no, more just the shadows of people, walking around there. I always had
to run through that hallway terrified into my parents room, and sleep on
their floor the rest of the night. After a while, i realized that they
normally just stay in the hallway, Rarely entering a room. The first night
this did happen however, a spirit the same shape as the one on my carpet
did come into my room. i just remember it walking around, never looking
at me. Just seeming to be looking for something. It went toward my closet
a lot during that time, and would open my laundry basket a few times. I
screamed and it disappeared, and since then i keep my door closed- sometimes
locked. Even today i am parranoid about my door always being closed and
locked. This stopped happening for years. (Serious signs.) But i would
still get subtle hints of their presence, like a knock on the door, or
something randomly falling off a shelf.</B>
<BR><B>So my friend was spending the night one night, and we fell asleep
on the couch downstairs. It was on a Monday because we had no school, and
therefore my father had work the next day, and needed his sleep. Tired
and drowsy, i woke up to my dad yelling to me. "DANIELLE!" (names have
been changed) "DANIELLE! BE QUIET! YOU ARE TOO LOUD AND I NEED TO WAKE
UP EARLY TOMORROW!" i noticed that 'alexis' was still sleeping. Having
just woke up, i had no clue what he was talking about. so i asked him.
"Dad, we were sleeping." he simply said "NO I HEAR YOU BOUNCING AROUND,
SLAMMING THINGS AND TALKING. DONT LIE TO ME, DANIELLE. NOW GO TO SLEEP
AND TURN OFF ALL THE LIGHTS." Confused, i just turned off all the lights,
woke up alexis, and we both tiredly bustled through the pitch-black rooms.
We got to the hallway, and i saw a black smear go in front of me. Guessing
it was my friend, i touched its back to guide me back to my room. It did,
and then moved to the left into my closet. Thinking alexis was going to
scare me (which she does ALL THE TIME.) i turned on the light quickly and
spun around. No one was there. I kept looking around, thinking she was
hiding. Without finding her, i open my door and gaze into the dark hallway.
I turned on the light, and saw alexis stumble out of another room. "Oh-
you already passed me. i was going to scare you."</B>
<BR><B>About a week later, me and her were going to go skating. She forgot
her socks, so i ran upstairs so she could borrow mine. i got to my door,
and the knob turned and opened about 3 or 4 inches. thinking it was my
sister, taking something from my room, i opened it really fast, but no
one was there. i grabbed the socks, and ran out.</B>
<BR><B>That night, she slept over again. I suddenly woke up and it was
extremely cold. i was on the couch and alexis was on the other couch. i
look on the floor, and i see a skinny man trying to stand. he was very
tall, pale, and skinny. i freaked out, because im tired, young, and scared,
so i decided to defend myself. I sat up, started screaming, and kicked
it twice. it finally disappeared, and was gone.</B>
<BR><B>i still hear things, and even as i type this, i hear a young child
humming a song. not a song i know, but a classical one. i learned to deal
with it, overall at least. i still get freaked sometimes, but im gernerally
okay. good luck everyone!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Scottsville Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BABYGIRL75670@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I HAVE A STORY I WOULD LIKE
TO SHARE CONCERNING THE CEMETARY. MY OLDER SISTER INVITED ME AND MY YOUNGER
SISTER TO VISIT HER IN MARSHALL TX.&nbsp; WHERE SHE LIVES. WHILE VISITING
SHE TOLD OF A CEMETARY SHE HAD BEEN TO WHERE WEIRD STUFF HAD HAPPENED TO
HER. SHE SAID HER AND SOME FRIENDS HAD DROVE THE TEN MINUTES TO THE CEMETARY
TO LOOK AT THE HISTORICAL GRAVE SITES. WHILE THERE THEY GOT A&nbsp; CHILL
THEY COULD NOT SHAKE OFF. THEY DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF
THE BAD FEELING THEY HAD. WELL WHATEVER THEY HAD BEEN FEELING WASN'T READY
FOR THEM TO LEAVE YET. THEY GOT IN THE CAR AND TRIED TO START IT BUT IT
WOULDN'T START. THE FEELING OF THE UNSEEN VISITER WAS ALL AROUND THEM.&nbsp;
THEY TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO LEAVE BUT THE ONLY TIME THE CAR WOULD START
IT WOULD ONLY GO A FEW FEET AND THEN DIE AGAIN. AFTER ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR
THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE CAR STARTED AND LEAVE THE PARKING LOT. THEY WERE
TERRIFIED AND NEVER WENT BACK.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHILE WE WERE IN MARSHALL WE DECIDED WE GO AT
NIGHT TO SEE IF WE COULD SEE ANYTHING. NOT EXPECTING TO GET A FRIGHT WE
ENTERED THE CEMETARY WHERE THERE IS A STATUE OF AN ANGEL THAT STANDS ADULT
SIZED ON A MONUMENT. WE WENT PASSED AND EXAMINED ALL THE OLD&nbsp; GRAVE
MARKERS WITH FLASHLIGHTS. WE HAD DECIDED TO LEAVE BEING WE WEREN'T GETTING
SCARED. AS WE WERE WALKING PASSED THE HUGE MONUMENT WE DISCOVERED THAT
THE ANGEL THAT HAD ONCE BEEN THERE WAS NO LONGER THERE. WE WALKED AROUND
TO MAKE SURE WE WERE IN THE RIGHT SPOT BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET
OUT TO WHERE THE CAR WAS PARKED. WE SEARCHED THE SKY WITH THE FLASHLIGHTS
TO SEE IF IT HAD TOOK FLIGHT. WE LOOKED ALL AROUND US WITH FEAR THAT IT
WOULD SOMEHOW SNEAK UP BEHIND US. WE NEVER FOUND THE ANGEL WE JUST RAN
OUT AND GOT IN THE CAR AND LEFT. I WAS JUST THANKFUL SHE LET US LEAVE.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ME AND MY YOUNGER STILL LOVE GOING AND LOOKING
THROUGH OLD CREEPY CEMETARIES DAY OR NIGHT. A FEW MONTHS AGO WE WENT TO
AN OLD CEMETARY WHICH IS ALSO AN HISTORICAL MARKER THAT HAS THE ORIGINAL
HOUSE THAT WAS BUILT IN THE 1800'S . IT WAS USED AS A SCHOOL AND CHURCH.
IT IS LOCATED IN SULPHUR SPRINGS TX.&nbsp; WE USED THE ADVISE GIVEN ON
THIS SITE ON HOW&nbsp; TO GET A PICTURE OF A GHOST. WE ASKED PERMISSION
TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THEM AND TOOK THE PICTURE. IT WAS AT NIGHT SO I MADE
SURE NO LIGHTS WERE PRESENT WHEN I TOOK THEM. I STILL HAVEN'T HAD THEM
DEVELOPED BUT IF I GET ANY GOOD PICTURES I WILL SEND SOME.</B>

<BR><B>Warrens Visits</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>To appreciate the story I am about to tell, there are a few details
you must first know.&nbsp; The house I live in is about four years old.
It was built by my wife and myself with the help of a few contractors.&nbsp;
The house sits on sixteen acres that was once part of a majestic seventy
five-acre farm.&nbsp; The original farmhouse still stands on an adjacent
lot.&nbsp; The farm was supposedly built by a solder who settled there
after walking off a battlefield during the civil war.&nbsp; The story goes,
that the solder walked north until he was too tired to continue walking
and this is where he settled.&nbsp; The last owner of the farm prior to
it being subdivided, is a sweet old lady named Ruth who is about ninety
years old and now lives in a small mobile home on a half-acre lot just
below ours and across from the old farmhouse.&nbsp; The farmhouse is now
occupied by a family with three young children.&nbsp; They are much more
equipped to maintain the old house and have kept it up quite well.&nbsp;
Ruths husband past away years ago.&nbsp; Ruth told me that her husband
farmed the land using only a horse drawn plow right up until the day he
died.</B>
<BR><B>When we first moved into our new house it was unfinished.&nbsp;
No carpet, no moldings and still unpainted.&nbsp; We worked day and night
to complete our new home.&nbsp; Things were going pretty normal until one
cold night in the middle winter my wife and I were awoken by the high pitched
screeching of the smoke detectors.&nbsp; We jumped out of bed, running
through the house looking for any signs of smoke, in a complete panic thinking
we may loose everything we worked so hard to build.&nbsp; Our search found
nothing.&nbsp; No smoke, no fire, no hint what so ever that there was a
problem.&nbsp; This same event happened several times in the next few weeks,
and I begin to notice it always happened at 11:11 pm.&nbsp; We consulted
the electricians that wired the house.&nbsp; They told use it might be
a power surge coming from the electric company.&nbsp; Others suggested
it was fumes from the new carpet and paint, or possibly spiders getting
into the sensors.&nbsp; My only thought was that it was very odd that it
always happened at the exact same time.&nbsp; What was even stranger is
that later I moved my clock ahead by ten minutes so I could force myself
to get up earlier, After I changed the clock, it still read 11:11 every
time the smoke detectors went off.&nbsp; After about three weeks the events
finally stopped.&nbsp; However, I still find myself waking up at 11:11
pm most nights for no reason that I can explain.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;After the house was complete my wife and I started to build
a small barn and some fencing for the two horses we had boarded at a near
by farm.&nbsp; We had purchased the horses about two years earlier, and
were very anxious to bring them home.&nbsp; We soon had the barn finished
and had our horses home, along with our two dogs, and we were very proud
of our little farm.&nbsp; From the house you could see the Dutch doors
we put on the horse stalls. It was a very satisfying sight to look out
and see the barn and the horses each morning.&nbsp; I noticed that the
horses loved to stick their heads out of the opened top door, and they
always seem to be watching something move along the tree line.&nbsp; I
later noticed the dogs doing the same peculiar thing from their pen behind
the house.&nbsp; My wife and I could never see, or figure out what they
were watching. Maybe a deer or other small animal, but it just seemed strange
that all four animals could see something that my wife and I could not.&nbsp;
Their moved in unison as the watched what ever was moving past them.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Up along the top edge of the property there are several houses
just on the other side of the tree line.&nbsp; It was common for our neighbors
to come down through the trees and up to the fence to see and pet the horses.&nbsp;
Being well-tempered and curious animals the horses would always walk over
to greet their visitors.&nbsp; However, on several occasions I would see
the horses slowly walk over to the fence side-by-side as they often did
when someone was there, but when we looked to see you was waiting for them,
we could see no one.&nbsp; They would stand there and act just like someone
was feeding them carrots, or petting their noses.&nbsp; It was cute to
watch but still very odd.</B>
<BR><B>One afternoon in the summer I went out to the barn to feed the horses.&nbsp;
I found both horses wearing their halters.&nbsp; I assumed I had forgot
to remove them from the day before, so I just removed the halters and hung
them on their hooks.&nbsp; I went back out about a half an hour later to
check their water, and once again I found both horses wearing their halters.&nbsp;
I later asked my wife if she had put them on.&nbsp; She just looked at
me funny and said, No I never left the house.&nbsp; A few days later
I went out and found the garden hose rolled up very neatly in the corner
and the barn was spotless.&nbsp; This seemed strange because it was common
for my wife or me to leave the hose stretched out on the floor.&nbsp; I
thought, Great, my wife decided to clean up the barn.&nbsp; I then stretched
out the hose and started filling their water buckets.&nbsp; I then decided
to go up to the hayloft to throw down some hay bails through the trap door.&nbsp;
When I came back down about three minutes later I found the water turned
off and the hose once again neatly rolled up in the corner.&nbsp; Plus
both horses were once again wearing their halters.&nbsp; I knew that I
hadnt done any of this, and my wife was nowhere in sight.&nbsp; This is
when I started thinking about all the strange things that were happening;
the smoke detectors, the halters, the hose that rolls up by itself, and
the fact that the barn is always clean and horses always look groomed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My wife and I tried to keep the horses looking good, but we had not had
a lot of time recently for grooming.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; appeared that
we had a mystery visitor that was taking care of our horses.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I never gave much thought to ghosts or spokes, but I suddenly felt very
uneasy.&nbsp; Pretty soon my logical mind kicked in, and I started to convince
myself that there was a reasonable explanation for all of these little
strange events</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;These little events continued.&nbsp; My wife and I simply
grow accustom to them.&nbsp; We actually started to expect them.&nbsp;
Most of the events seem to revolve around the horses.&nbsp; On one beautiful
fall day I was out in the barn filling water buckets and sweeping up when
I saw the horses walk over to the fence.&nbsp; In my mind I said, Do they
see their invisible friend or is someone really there.&nbsp; When I look
out I was relieved to see that there was someone standing there.&nbsp;
There was an older, tall, thin man wearing a white shirt, denim overalls
and a small brimmed hat.&nbsp; He had gray hair and a beard with no mustache,
much like the way the Amish look.&nbsp; I decided to go out and meet our
this man assuming it was one of our neighbors.&nbsp; I introduced myself,
and with a thick Pennsylvania Dutch accent the man introduced himself as
Warren.&nbsp; He said that he really loved horses.&nbsp; In fact he told
me he use-to-use horses when he farmed.&nbsp; I asked him where he lived.&nbsp;
He simply answered, Oh close by He then said, dont let me keep you
from our chores, I just wanted to come up and say hi to my two friends
here.&nbsp; I told him that they seemed to really like him too.&nbsp;
I also told him that he was welcome to come over anytime.&nbsp; He said
that his wife sometimes gets annoyed with him, so he goes for walks to
give her some peace.&nbsp; I then return to the barn to turn off the water.&nbsp;
When I looked back Warren had already left.&nbsp; When I went back to the
house I told my wife about Warren.&nbsp; She told me thats the guy she
often sees down at Ruths house. She said, I think he helps her around
the house.&nbsp; Hes there all the time.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Two month later we saw Ruth at her mailbox.&nbsp; My wife
rolled down her window to say hello.&nbsp; I leaned over and told Ruth
that I had met Warren, that he had come up to see the horses, but he hasnt
been around since it got cold out.&nbsp; Ruth laughed and said If Warren
gets to be a bother to you, just send him home.&nbsp; I asked her were
Warren lived.&nbsp; She said he sometimes lives with her and sometimes
lives in the farmhouse.&nbsp; I told her that it seemed odd that the people
who live in the farmhouse now never mentioned anything about Warren living
with them.&nbsp; Ruth very quickly answered, Oh, they dont know he there.&nbsp;
My wife and I just looked at each other.&nbsp; Ruth smiled, turned and
walked back to her house.&nbsp; At that point it pretty much hit me who
Warren was, that the man I had been talking with two months earlier was
Ruths husband and had been dead for over thirty years.&nbsp; This gave
me a feeling of total shock.&nbsp; Its hard to explain how you feel when
you suddenly realize that all those ghost stories you heard as a kid could
actual be true.&nbsp; You develop a fear that now anything is truly possible.&nbsp;
I kept thinking to myself No this cant be happening.&nbsp; Theres no
way that was her husband.&nbsp; But then what about all the other strange
events.&nbsp; A ghostly visitor was the only explanation I could come up
with.&nbsp; I turned and looked at my wife.&nbsp; She was just sitting
there staring back at me with a look of total disbelief.&nbsp; The next
thing we heard was a car horn.&nbsp; We were both startled for a moment.&nbsp;
We realized that we had been sitting there in the car for several minutes
just contemplating what we had just heard.&nbsp; The driver behind us got
tired of waiting and just went around.&nbsp; My wife and I then slowly
drove the last one hundred yards to our house without saying a word.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I started to say something, my wife quickly interrupted and said; I really
dont want to talk about this.&nbsp; We really havent talked much about
it since.&nbsp; As time goes on, and I thing about it, all I need to do
is remember how polite and happy he looked when I saw him and any fear
I may have had goes away.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Warren still comes around.&nbsp; I still find the halters
on the horses when I know I removed them.&nbsp; He still straitens up
the barn, and the dogs and horses still watch him go for his walks along
the trees.&nbsp; I still wake up at 11:11 pm almost every night, and I
have started having dreams about the farm the way it use to look years
ago, probably before I was born.&nbsp; I often times see Warren in these
dreams, but the dreams are always very pleasant.&nbsp; I have no idea what
the significance of 11:11 pm is.&nbsp; Maybe just a coincidence.&nbsp;
I have not talked to Ruth about this; I am not sure what I would say.&nbsp;
However, I did check the original proposal for the subdivision and Warren
was her late husbands name.&nbsp; Ironically it was also the name of the
man that originally built the farmhouse during the civil war, but I have
no idea if he liked horses.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Many Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Windsor234@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I have experienced strange happenings (unexplained) as far
back as I can remember. Rather than talk about the simple happenings Ill
tell you about the most prominent ones. Ill begin by telling you that
majority of these happenings never frightened me to the point of hysteria,
but made me very aware that we are definitely not alone.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; My first encounter was when I was around 5. I was living
with my grandmother in New Bedford, MA.&nbsp; I remember always being afraid
of the dark, and this is probably why. I was lying down to sleep and as
I lay there I noticed a shadow on the other side of the room. My grandmother
had an old desk and swivel chair there. It looked to be a shadow of someone
sitting in the chair slowly swiveling.&nbsp; I was curious to know if it
was just a shadow or did someone come into the room while I was not paying
attention. It began to frighten me and then I heard a low voice say Dont
be afraid. I jumped from bed and started to pound at the bedroom door
for someone to let me out!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; When I was about 8 years of age my mother, brother and myself
lived in an old farmhouse in Rehoboth, MA. The house (rental) came furnished
with everything from linen to arts and crafts.&nbsp; My brother one night
had said that he heard someone walking up the stairs and he thought that
it was my mother, so he decided to hide around the corner, jump out when
she came close enough and scare her.&nbsp; The foot steps came to the top
of the stairs; my brother jumped out and had the scare of his life for
there wasnt anyone there. I always came home from school and things were
constantly being noticeably rearranged in my bedroom. I thought it was
my mother but years later she told me that everything in the house was
constantly being rearranged. The house was originally owned by a Captain
and while my brother and I were investigating the grounds one day, we stumbled
on a gravesite (possibly a family plot) buried behind the stone wall that
ran across the property. It was very overgrown.&nbsp; The one stone I noticed
was of a Captain (the name escapes me all these years later) and he passed
away during the 18th century.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; It seemed as the years went on the happenings were getting
stronger and more noticeable. We lived in Dighton, MA from the time I was
10 till I turned 18.&nbsp; The house was fairly new.&nbsp; One night as
I was lying in my bed I heard the window rattle above my head. I then heard
breathing, like an animal breathes after a long run.&nbsp; I convinced
myself that I was hearing things and that these strange things happen to
not only me, but both my mother and my brother.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; The occurrences seemed very strong after my stepfather passed
away.&nbsp; My mother had known only to stay home and her finances were
not stable, so she was very upset about it. As I laid in bed thinking of
what I was to wear to work the next day, no sooner I heard a jingling sound
like change in someones pocket, coming from my bedroom closet. I passed
it off as one of my mothers animals playing in there.&nbsp; The next day
I grabbed the dress that I had thought of and ran down the stairs to take
a shower. As I did this, the change rattled in the dress pocket. I shrugged
it off.&nbsp; That day when I arrived back home from work I went into my
bedroom, looked at my closet and decided to clean the messy thing out.&nbsp;
I had old toys in there!&nbsp; One very large game box (the tower with
marbles and sticks that you pull out of it) sat at the very back.&nbsp;
I pulled it out thinking how long it had been since I had played the game
and decided to take everything out of it. As I did this I pulled out a
small waste paper bag that had been knotted to close it up.&nbsp; I opened
the bag and found a large amount of money in it.&nbsp; I immediately called
my mother (I knew she would be happy) and asked her if she had misplaced
money. She said no and I told her what I had found. My stepfather had left
the money there (probably figuring that I would never clean out my closet)
and I believe that he was telling me just where to find it. My stepfather
passed away on a date that coincided with 3 numbers that he used to play...3.6.9.
He passed away on March 26, 1979.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; As I got older I found that I was able to actually see apparitions
of the sort and hear voices clearly (no, Im not on medication).&nbsp;
An apartment house I lived in with my two children was very haunted.&nbsp;
It was in Somerset, MA and the history was that it housed a small tavern
when it was built back in the 19th century.&nbsp; In the dirt cellar you
could smell alcohol, but not liquor alcohol, rubbing alcohol.&nbsp; Upstairs
the empty room, which had but a bureau in it, was the noisiest.&nbsp; Someone
was constantly moving furniture around. Yes furniture that wasnt there.
It got so loud at times I had to yell to ask them to quiet down (a little
scared) but I knew, for some strange reason, that there was nothing harmful
up there.&nbsp; One afternoon in the opposite bedroom across from the noisy
one, I was standing there with a friend of mine and I was complaining how
my son leaves his room, messy. All of sudden one of his army tanks turned
on and started making the sound of shooting.&nbsp; I was stunned as was
my friend, and I reached over to take the batteries out.&nbsp; I continued
to complain about my son and two minutes later the tank started up and
began shooting againwith no batteries.&nbsp; My girlfriend screamed and
ran down the stairs fully aware of the goings on in the house!&nbsp; For
some reason, I knew what some of these ghosts were. I knew that in this
house it was an older woman. Though I never saw her..I new. She was probably
offended at my cursing regarding my sons messy room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; My grandmother passed away a few years ago and I stayed by
her side until she took her last breath.&nbsp; Before she passed, though
she was in a comatose state, I was washing the dishes in her kitchen. As
I stood there I heard Ruthie, Ruthie! I looked out the kitchen door figuring
someone was there to see her.&nbsp; No one was at the kitchen door so I
walked to the front door, no one there either.&nbsp; I immediately thought
that she was being called and that her time on this earth was not long.&nbsp;
When my uncle showed up to relieve me (we took turns watching her) I asked
him of who would have called Nana Ruthie? He said the only person that
he remembers would have been her mother. Her mother died many years before.
I told him what I had heard.&nbsp; My Nana passed away two days later.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; A month had passed and I had a dream of her house. The house
was painted tan with blue trim and the big overgrown bushes in front of
the house were cut down to stumps. I walked through the front door and
the little wall that sheltered the living space was gone and the room was
wide open.&nbsp; I walked to the kitchen and it was so terribly bright
in her kitchen, almost blinding and everything was repainted.&nbsp; I called
my uncle and told him what I had dreamt.he paused and said Lynn, go to
the house but he would not tell me why.&nbsp; I drove to the house and
sure enoughthe house was tan w/blue trim, the bushes were cut to stumps,
the small wall was torn down and it exposed the entire living area and
most of allhe had added a sliding glass door to a porch off of the kitchen
thats why the kitchen was so blindingly bright in my dream</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I had eventually purchased a home in Somerset and immediately
began to see a woman ascending the stairway.&nbsp; She would only get to
the third step and she would vanish. I never could see her face but she
was wearing black.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I have since moved again and in this house, which is in the
historic part of Somerset, we have a cat, a dead one.&nbsp; It began when
I was sleeping.&nbsp; I had a dream that someone or something was tugging
at my foot.&nbsp; I felt a searing pain in my foot and woke up. Soon after,
I began to see the little creature (cat) every now and then scurrying across
the room then vanishing.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I seem to be able to witness and hear things that eventually
come to fruition and anyone out there that this happens to, never think
that you are without sense.&nbsp; Just go with it and think of it as a
gift, something you might be able to help someone out with.</B>

<BR><B>I am Nuts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MrNiceGuy7921@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;This may sound crazy but it's true and it's the only time i
have ever seen anything like this,i am not a crazy and i don't see stuff
like this all the time or hear voices.I come from a small county full of
small towns and most the surrounding county's are the same. Around here
there is not much to do besides go out in the boondocks (middle of nowhere,
woods) and soot guns drink beer fish or have a small party. Well, when
I was in school there was a few spots we would go to hang out at. The one
IM going to talk about is called the lost city. The reason it is called
that is because it is what's left of an oil refinery that exploded 20 something
years ago and it kinda looks like a city. It was left alone and never tore
down and the woods grew up around it. We loved to hang out there because
there where lots of places to climb up on tons of concert to tag and it
was big enough that if you wanted to get some privacy you could. We had
a lot of parties out there.</B>
<BR><B>Well three of us got broke of the habit of going out there by the
events of one night. Me and two friends of mine Greg and Justin went out
there to mess around and just hang out and see if anyone else showed up.
We where sitting in the car BSing when Justin told us to hush. He said
he heard someone talking in the woods. So me and Greg shut up and listened
but did not hear anything. So we just sat there BSing some more deciding
what to go do when we started to hear it again. It was not exactly talking
more like mumbling and hissing sounds. We where sorta spooked but I thought
I was just someone messing with us so I told Greg and Justin the same and
they agreed with me. so we got out of the car and started walking around
acting like we where tuff guys. We yelled and cursed and said it would
take more than that to scare us that we knew they where out there. It did
not stop though and we did not stop because of that. We where walking slowly
toward the woods with my tire tool and some sticks when Greg saw something
move. He stopped and said shhh.He pointed to where he saw the movement
and we watched the wood line for more. We could still hear the sound and
still thought it was friends of ours. While we where watching we started
to see shadows moving around in the wood line. Justin told me to go turn
the light in the car on so we could see them. So I walked back to the car
and hit the lights. When I did we saw nothing and the sound stopped. That
scared us but we where still saying that it was somebody and not something.
We decided that it might not be someone we know and that maybe we should
go, so we all got in the car and as i started to turn around so we could
go the sounds started back up again. They where not any louder than the
first time but we could see people moving all around in the woods and grass.
At this point we where scared to death and i was doing my best to get the
car turned around. The lights hit one of the figures and as it did we saw
noting. It was like they where there but not there.I hit the breaks thinking
i was going to run over someone,but there was no one in front of the car.
Now we could see large black froms moveing along the treeline and moveing
some out in to the opening toward us.They where like shadows some big and
some small, some looked like people and others more like animals or shapes.I
could not move i was so scared i just sat there looking at them as they
moved around.I finaly snaped out of it and We got the hell out of there,
and have not been back.I dont think any of us ever want to go back. We
told a few people not many but i have been told similar stories of what
people around here call the shadow people.</B>

<P><B>Owensboro Haunts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Upstage7@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In checking out your haunted places section, I was reading over
the entries for my hometown, Owensboro, Kentucky.&nbsp; Having been involved
with local theaters for over twenty-five years, I have had a rather intimate
history with two of the sites mentioned, and I'd like to set the record
straight.</B>
<BR><B>First of all, let me state that I am the Technical Director for
the RiverPark Center, a performing arts center that opened in September
1992.&nbsp; There may have indeed been a woman who leaped to her death
in the Ohio River in 1927, but she didn't accomplish that feat from the
RiverPark catwalks...they weren't there until 65 years later.&nbsp; Even
the nearby bridge into Indiana wasn't opened until the mid '40s, before
that there was a ferry.&nbsp; Don't, however, be too disappointed.&nbsp;
Strange things do happen at RiverPark, including a sighting of the aforementioned
"Lady in White" on the Black box theater's tension wire grid (sort of like
a catwalk).&nbsp; This apparition was first seen in 1994 by two of the
people who were working on a rehearsal of Angel Street.&nbsp; The CO-director
and stage manager both saw this lady at the same time, from two different
vantage points in the theater.&nbsp; After that, the stage manager wouldn't
go backstage alone.&nbsp; Several other people said t</B>
<BR><B>At the Theatre Workshop of Owensboro, of which I have been actively
involved since 1978, I can't honestly attest to any of the things previously
reported, though TWO has it's share of strange occurrences too!</B>
<BR><B>There is a bell tower, though I've never heard any ringing, and
I've been there working alone both night and day many times.&nbsp; The
basements, both front and back, are creepy, but I've never been pushed.&nbsp;
I've heard the story about the suicide, but have never seen any proof to
substantiate that, though it could be true.&nbsp; Sometimes it does get
extremely cold.&nbsp; Then again, it can get excruciatingly warm.&nbsp;
The central air in that building is for crap.&nbsp; I don't think it has
anything to do with spirits.</B>
<BR><B>Things that have happened, without a doubt, (since I have been witness
to these things), are...several years ago, after a rehearsal, a few of
us were sitting in the green room swapping stories, and sipping drinks,
to unwind.&nbsp; When we had been there for about ten minutes, the back
door, which was closed and locked, swung open and closed.&nbsp; Then, the
door to the back basement, which is right next to the back door, swung
open and closed.&nbsp; We all laughed that "George," as we had dubbed the
fellow, must have had business in the prop basement.&nbsp; We went back
to talking, and about ten minutes after that, the basement door swung open
and closed, then the back door&nbsp; swung open and closed.&nbsp; George
had finished his business!</B>
<BR><B>One last story, though there are many more.&nbsp; Several years
ago I was building the set for a play called The Cemetery Club.&nbsp; I
was in the main part of the theatre, where I had set up my drafting table,
and was making trips to and from the stage, taking measurements of flats,
and making notations on my designs.&nbsp; Needing another measurement,
I looked on my table for my tape measure.&nbsp; I moved all my notes and
drawings around several times, and the tape was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;
Thinking that I had left it on the stage, I went up to look for it.&nbsp;
After a thorough fruitless examination, I looked at my table again.&nbsp;
Nothing.&nbsp; Back to the stage.&nbsp; Ditto.&nbsp; I broadened my search
to include the green room, the dressing rooms, the control booth, the restrooms...nothing,&nbsp;
Finally, making my way back out to the main hall, I capriciously called
on my friends on the "other side",&nbsp; my fellow thespians who had, over
the years, preceded me to the great beyond.</B>
<BR><B>" Come on Sid, Rae, George, ( a different one), Jane.&nbsp; Help
me out here.&nbsp; Someone's taken my tape measure."&nbsp; With that said,
I walked straight back to my table, and there, sitting on top of the papers
that I had been moving around, was my tape measure.&nbsp; Well,...I said
"thanks" ...I still had lots of work to do... but you can believe that
the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up for quite a while after
that!</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, if you ever get to Owensboro, visit both places.&nbsp; They
are each unique, and neat to see.&nbsp; Each has a website, though RPC
makes no mention of their eerie happenings.&nbsp; TWO may even soon add
a ghost cam to their menu.&nbsp; Check it out at www.theatreworkshop.org,
and good hunting!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Our Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: steere@sbcglobal.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>The house I grew up in has been haunted for as long as I can remember.
I remember as a child being afraid of the shadow that used to pass in the
hall at night. And hearing my mom tell us about the night she thought my
dad was trying to get into bed with her so she scooted over and bumped
into my dad, and the figure leaning over her disappeared. There were times
when the heat turned off or the air turned on by themselves, my dad sat
on the edge of the tub in the bathroom and watched the handle of the heater
turn off one night. My mom has seen the ghost many times but he has never
hurt anyone in our family. He is a little bit of a prankster though. He
likes to open locked doors while everyone is in the room, and no one by
the door. He likes to pinch toes in the middle of the night.</B>
<BR><B>One morning, I was the first one awake. I walked into the living
room and saw that the back door was wide open. I got my mom and we checked
the whole house, but there was no one there. We went to the back door and
before we could shut it, we had to unlock the dead bolt, for some reason
he leaves the door locked when he opens it.</B>
<BR><B>Another time my sister and I were in the living room, her watching
tv and I listening to a walkman. We had a blanket draped over a pole in
the hall to make a kind of door. For some strange reason we both looked
at the doorway and saw a pair of feet and legs walk from our bedroom into
the bathroom. We didn't waste any time, we ran to the hall, tore down the
curtain, and there was no one in the bathroom or in our bedroom. The windows
were shut and locked too. That's when we figured it out, it was our ghost.&nbsp;
He is not the only ghost in the house either. There is a lady who wears
a long flowing gown, and a child. I one time walked into my parents bedroom
and the lady was sitting in the middle of their bed, and she just disappeared
before my eyes. My sister has also seen her. It was almost 2 years ago.
We had just found out my dad had cancer. He was in his room telling my
mom about a dream he had had about seeing his Parents in heaven and telling
them he was coming home soon. Just then they heard a scream coming from
the den. My sister had walked into the dark room to get to the garage,
just as she reached for the light switch, a woman appeared right in front
of her. She screamed and closed her eyes til my mother came to her. Needless
to say, she won't go into any room alone if it's dark.</B>
<BR><B>The child likes to turn the radio on at different times of the day
and night. And sometimes in the middle of the night, you can hear a child's
laughter. We think it's a little girl, but we're not sure. She likes to
come up behind my mom's chair and shake it or bump it. And she loves to
pull on toes at night or climb into my mom's bed in the middle of the night.
Most of the time if you do get a chance to see her, it's out of the corner
of your eye. She has never really shown herself to anyone.</B>
<BR><B>My mom has never seen the lady or really seen the child, but she
has had many times seen the man in our house. He always wears a white t-shirt
and jeans. He has saved my family a couple of times through my life though.
He has woke my mom up when someone was breaking into our house, she got
up to check on her kids and saw a leg sticking in the window, and screamed.
The guy ran off and my dad woke up and we were all ok. Maybe he's our guardian
angle.</B>
