<P>
<P><B>Hi! I am a 27 yr old male who lives in Queens, New York. I do have
a</B>
<P><B>ghost experience relating to a deceased pet parakeet named "Prince".</B>
<P><B>This experience I feel is kind of small compared to many of the
stories</B>
<P><B>that I've read from your website already, But hey...... here it</B>
<P><B>goes......</B>
<P>
<P><B>Around October in 1989, my parakeet Prince developed an illness and
was</B>
<P><B>rapidly growing weak. Although I've tried to treat him and take him
to</B>
<P><B>the vet, his illness would never regress. Then one Thursday, during
one</B>
<P><B>of the usual exercising sessions (where I would allow the birds to
fly</B>
<P><B>freely about my room), Prince grew extremely tired in mid-flight,
bumped</B>
<P><B>into my dresser, dropped and finally landed at the foot of the
dresser.</B>
<P><B>His breathing faded and while in my hands, finally died with an
exhale.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then about two days later around 10 pm, I hear a faint chirping</B>
<P><B>somewhere in my room. I tried to follow the sound and my ears led me
to</B>
<P><B>the spot where Prince died. For some reason, I wasn't afraid. I then
sat</B>
<P><B>by the spot and silently listened until it untimately faded. The
sound</B>
<P><B>would then emanate at the same spot and at the same time every night
for</B>
<P><B>two weeks. I never experienced any fear for I knew exactly who it
was.</B>
<P><B>But I was facinated more than anything else. The chirping have never</B>
<P><B>returned to this day.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I was sent your page by my brother,and like it very much.I paid</B>
<P><B>attention to the ohio hauntings</B>
<P><B>and the winchester grave yard site. This is a true story, Ive been
there</B>
<P><B>and saw things,heard things.I heard someone call my friends name and
he</B>
<P><B>thought it was me. I saw a white image first and then a dark one. The</B>
<P><B>dark one seems to move and chase us out of the cemetary. I was</B>
<P><B>horrified,it actually followed us to our car,as we turned around it
was</B>
<P><B>half way down the hill, the next time, it was on the bridge.It was
a</B>
<P><B>experience I will never forget.I spoke to my Dad about it (he was a</B>
<P><B>pastor) and he warned me not to go back.That there was more evil
buried</B>
<P><B>there than good, we could get hurt.My Dad doesnt believe in</B>
<P><B>ghosts,however he did warn me to never return there. I have never
went</B>
<P><B>back in the night,and only once in the day. Not everyone believed us,</B>
<P><B>but we know what happened there and it was evil that we felt.It went</B>
<P><B>from warm to freezing in seconds when the shadow apeared,Im not sure</B>
<P><B>what it all means, but something happened up there and I will never</B>
<P><B>forget it.</B>

<P><B>This is probably the most boring ghost story your likely to hear, but
it is true.  It all evolves around three incidents that occurred all in the
same house when I was just a boy.  Years ago, when we first moved into the
house, I often felt that there was a presence in house with me.  I guess
it could have been all put down to an over active imagination, but then the
first, and most boring, incident occurred.  I was in the dining room of our
house, my brother and father were at the piano on the other side of the room
from me, and I was sitting next to a very old white book case that we had
bought second hand a long time ago.  Well, while I was sitting there I saw
an envelope move from one side of the book case to the other, as if it had
been pushed.  This was at night and all the windows and curtains were closed,
there are no vents in the back room and we don't have air conditioning, no
one had entered or left the room,  in other words there is no explanation
why the envelope should have moved.  the second incident happened when I
was with a friend.  We were both in my bedroom leaning out the window calling
to someone when a voice that I guessed at the time must have come from about
three feet behind us said ' shut up ' quite clearly.  There was obviously
no-one in the room as it is a small room that no-one could possibly hide
in, and everyone else ( there was only my mother  was downstairs ).  We were
both scared and ran downstairs, but didn't tell anyone.  The last incident
happened in my brother room.  I was stroking my cat as he lay on the bed
when all of a sudden he looked behind me and hissed as if there was something
in the room threatening him, it really scared me as there was no-one there,
yet he seemed to stare into a blank part of the room as if there was an intruder.
 That really scared me, so I ran out the room, but as I left a basket full
of stuff fell off a table ( no-where near me or my cat so neither of us touched
it ) fell over onto the floor.  Besides all that I had a terrible feeling
of dread wash over me.  Those are the most interesting stories, not much,
but there is no explanation for any of them.  Sometimes my cat will avoid
a particular place as if someone is standing there, he refused to go near
the front room door way once, and would move around it like there was someone
or something there.  I have had no other trouble, and the house feels fine
to me, so I don't think it is haunted.  My brother suggested spirits that
were just passing through caused this, and I am inclined to agree; that is
if ghosts were the cause.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My children and I had a very bad experience with a demon in a house
that we lived in. My son become very scared one night as he viewed a ghost
of a man with a sword sticking out of it's side. This ghost was standing
in the doorway of my son's bedroom very late one night. He said this thing
was just giving him the feeling of such terrible hatred and dread. It made
my son feel like it was going to kill us. My son started sleeping in my
daughter's bedroom and that thing started going from room to room looking
for my son and so it started coming into our room and scaring the daylights
out of me. I felt the hatred and anger. I know that it would have killed
us if we had not gotten our pastor out there to help us. When our pastor
pulled into our drive, he said he felt the anger and hatred just emanating
from the house to the outside. He knew what we were up against and we immediately
started saying prayers to Jesus and his army of saints to fight for us. It
worked so that while we were living there we had no more problems. But whenever
we drive by, we cannot even look at the house.</B>

<P>
<P><B>We bought this house in 1968, in a small suburb of Chicago,  We moved</B>
<P><B>in, on my sons 3rd birthday that December.  That little guy "talked"
to</B>
<P><B>Jonathan, who was evidently, a young man who "got me out of the well</B>
<P><B>when I was bigger", my son said.  </B>
<P><B>We heard noises from the attic of this house almost from the first</B>
<P><B>night.  Footsteps would fall on the stairs and no one was there.  The</B>
<P><B>rest of the children were afraid, but Frankie wasn't.  He said it was</B>
<P><B>just Joe.  I looked into the history of the property, and found out
no</B>
<P><B>other house had been listed here, in fact it was a duckblind for some</B>
<P><B>neighborhood boys for years  until developement after the Korean</B>
<P><B>Conflict.</B>
<P><B>One afternoon, while the children were in school, and the little ones</B>
<P><B>were napping I had a vision I guess.  I was in my kitchen and could
see</B>
<P><B>an old fashioned farmhouse kitchen, the woodstove, the table, the</B>
<P><B>washstand and the back door.  Through a window I could see the</B>
<P><B>outbuildings and a Winter scene even though it was, in reality, early</B>
<P><B>September.  I described the "vision" to my husband later that evening</B>
<P><B>and Frank overheard it.  He said "that was my house when I used to
be</B>
<P><B>bigger, don't you remember?"  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Frank doesn't remember any of this anymore, but things continue to</B>
<P><B>happen here.  The TV sets will turn on and off at will, the dog will</B>
<P><B>stare down the hall and sometimes bark at nothing there.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>We still hear footsteps on the stairs, and things will go missing for
a</B>
<P><B>day or two and then turn up right where we left them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>None of us feel threatened but some people refuse to stay all night
in</B>
<P><B>the bedrooms of the converted attic.</B>

<H3><A NAME=dream>A Dream and a Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by mrreinke@students.wisc.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about eleven years old, my grandfather became sick with
lung</B>
<P><B>cancer, and in six months it quickly spread, and eventually after a
lot</B>
<P><B>of suffering by him and the entire family, he died October 16, 1991.
</B>
<P><B>Since he was a well respected man in the community, it was very</B>
<P><B>difficult for everyone to handle, especially all of us grandchildren.
</B>
<P><B>Anyways, a week after to the day of the funeral I had a dream.  In
the</B>
<P><B>dream my cousin Ashley and I were at the church where the funeral had</B>
<P><B>taken place, only when we walked in, a play of sorts was going on.
</B>
<P><B>There were three different stages, one with all of us grandchildren
and</B>
<P><B>grandpa opening presents at christmas, one with all of us ice
fishing,</B>
<P><B>and another one with my dad, my uncle and grandpa playing poker (
which</B>
<P><B>none of them did).  When we walked up to the alter/stage, grandpa got
up</B>
<P><B>from all of the scenes and sort of meshed into one figure.  He came
up</B>
<P><B>to my cousin and I and hugged us.  Ash and I, knowing that he was</B>
<P><B>supposed to be dead, started to cry, and asked him why he had brought
us</B>
<P><B>to him.  Grandpa's face turned dark, and he started to say, "too bad</B>
<P><B>grandma didn't tell you", and we asked him,"tell us what, grandpa?"
and</B>
<P><B>this continued for a good while, until grandma appeared suddenly out
of</B>
<P><B>the shadows and screamed at us "too bad I didn't tell you" and then</B>
<P><B>pulled grandpa away from us.  I woke up crying and in a cold sweat
and</B>
<P><B>knew as soon as I opened my eyes that I wasn't alone in the room. 
I</B>
<P><B>felt like someone was standing right next to my bed.  When I felt the</B>
<P><B>air around the area, it was ice cold.  I freaked out immediately, and</B>
<P><B>threw the covers over my head, hiding from whatever it was- which I</B>
<P><B>ofcourse know is ridiculous, but I was 11. </B>
<P><B>	The next day I went and visited my cousin Ash, and told her about
the</B>
<P><B>dream.  Before I even explained an eighth of it, she turned white as
a</B>
<P><B>sheet, and started to cry.  She too, had dreamed the same damn thing.
</B>
<P><B>We never told anyone in our family, but I definitely would hold it
to my</B>
<P><B>grandmother to lie to us about something- her nickname in our family
is</B>
<P><B>"mother matriarch".</B>
<P><B>	The ghost part comes in here.  From the time my grandfather died
until</B>
<P><B>midnight of my 12th birthday (in Jan.), he visited us girls while we</B>
<P><B>were sleeping.  In our house the upstairs is two room, with a door</B>
<P><B>separating my room from my two younger sister's.  When we were
younger</B>
<P><B>we kept the door open, and starting the night after my grandfather
died,</B>
<P><B>my dad kept hearing footsteps upstairs.  He kept asking me if I was</B>
<P><B>walking around or if one of my sisters was sleep walking, and none
of us</B>
<P><B>were, so he just let it drop, not wanting to think about what it
might</B>
<P><B>be.  Eventually, though, my dad had enough and came upstairs during
one</B>
<P><B>of the walking sessions.  No one was walking around, or even awake
for</B>
<P><B>that matter, yet the footsteps continued, from one end of my sister's</B>
<P><B>room to the other side of mine.  We all knew it was grandpa, and we</B>
<P><B>weren't the only one's he visited.  Each one of the families heard</B>
<P><B>footsteps on and off after his death, but no one ever saw anything.</B>
<P><B>	The footsteps stopped for us on the night of my birthday.  After all</B>
<P><B>our relatives had left, it was about midnight, and I went to bed. 
I was</B>
<P><B>just about asleep when I heard the footsteps, and I was wide awake
when</B>
<P><B>they stopped at the foot of the bed.  All of the sudden, something
sat</B>
<P><B>on my legs, and I absolutely could not move them.  I prayed for "it"
to</B>
<P><B>go away, and no sooner than it sat down, it left, and we never heard
the</B>
<P><B>footsteps again.</B>

</H3><P><B>by LiQuidDoAp@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Let me first start by saying that your site rocks!!! Anyway to my story.
 It's pretty short but it was pretty scary at the time.</B>
<P><B>Well I work at Disneyland and oddly enough I'm a ride operator at the
Haunted Mansion attraction.   I had been working there for over a year and
hadn't seen anything out of the norm.   There were stories though of weird
occurences other cast members who worked the attraction have encountered.
  There's a story of a little boy in a red baseball cap who calls the name
of whoever is working in the load position.  He also runs around and suddenly
dissappears.   Well to my own story...I was working the load postion by myself
around 8:30 am since it was so early and there were not many guests.  Usually
there are two people at the load position.  One to get people on the ride
and one to make sure the lap bar goes down.   Well a small group came down
and it didn't take long to load them.  When down at load i usually sit on
the console since no guest can see me.   It's pretty creepy in the darkness,
the music and the sound effects down at load but I'm used to.  Everything
seem to be ok.   Then it happened.   One of the chains in the queue area
right next to me started to shake.  I was used to the chains swaying because
sometimes the air conditioning was on very high and caused them to sway.
  The chain wasn't just swaying this time.  It was shaking and rattling like
mad.   I was soooo scared I ran up the ramp into the camera room and told
the person there what had happened.    Marcus came down with me and I showed
him what happened.  All he told me was, "Remember, Nothing can't hurt you."
  He assured me something weird happens to everyone.  Another weird thing
is the elevator we call "ER 1" has a gargoyle in it that hisses at you if
you talk to it.  It's really weird,    The only explanaton we have to the
weird happenings is that awhile ago someone by the name of "Grandma Joyce"
had one of her friends spread her ashes throughout the attractions.  Man
after writing this I don't think I want to go to work tomorrow.  Again let
me tell you what  a great site ya have.</B>

<H3><A NAME=road>Man in the Road</A>
</H3><P><B>by amcqueen@email.msn.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't normally tell these stories to anyone because they sound
outlandish, but I am a professional who has an MBA in English and I have
had some of the strangest things happen to me.  The most memorable one was
in the fall of 1990.  I was a senior in high school, and my boyfriend and
I were out with our best friend.  Being a stupid teenager, I was riding on
my boyfriend's lap in the front seat because we were just going to the park
which was only about three miles from where we were, and we lived in the
middle of no man's land.  There was a forest of trees in the middle of the
fork.  We were talking and carrying on, and my friend, Mike, took the left
fork instead of the right fork.  I looked up, fussing at him for taking the
wrong road when we saw this guy in a gray sweatshirt and blue sweatpants
walk out of the trees right in front of the car.  Of course, I thought we
were going to wreck, so I braced my arm on the dashboard and ducked my head
preparing to be thrown through the windshield.  I was screaming.  But I felt
no impact.  When I looked up, we were on the right road going towards the
park, and there was no one in front of the car.  Of course, we stopped the
car and mulled around for a few minutes trying to see if maybe someone had
wrecked in the trees, but there was no sign of anything.  I do know that
about four years before that my brother had a good friend who died at that
intersection while running from the cops after a domestic dispute.  He never
made the turn, and went straight into the trees.  He left behind two small
children.  Maybe it was him trying to go home.</B>
<P><B>My next experience happened with a Ouija board and I can promise I'll
never touch another one.  We were trying to contact a friend who had passed
away about a year earlier.  I asked him to prove he was who he said, and
he gave us some details that each of us in the room would know about him
individually, but not collectively.  I asked him to prove he was there. 
I heard something happening in the laundry room and I threw the board into
the hallway and went to look.  All the cabinets above the washer and dryer
were open and all the stored sheets were laying all over the floor.  My cat's
food and water had been pushed to the opposite side of the room.  It was
too scary for all of us.  We camped out together in sleeping bags on the
floor as close to one another as we could!</B>
<P>
<P><B>And this is my final story, because this one is happening presently.
 I had a daughter two years ago.  I decided to pass on my middle name which
has been a family tradition for girls in our family for years - Grace.  The
wild thing is, my daughter was due on June 21st, which I thought was cool
because it was my brother's birthday, but she was born on May 27, 1996, exactly
one year to the date of the death of my Aunt Grace, whom I had adored during
life.  She was my godmother, and she never had any kids, and I felt it was
a meaningful tribute to her.  Anyways, getting to my point, my daughter was
born very sick, but became healthy very quickly.  She has grown into a radiant
little girl.  We have moved five times since she was born (My job had me
travelling and we finally decided to settle near one set of grandparents
so she could have the loving support I never had, so we moved to Atlanta.)
 The strange thing is I have noticed that she always has the coldest room
in the house.  My husband makes a joke out of it since he is always hot that
he doesn't know how we always do that.  I believe it is my Aunt Grace watching
over her, her guardian angel.  I have been in her room, putting her to bed,
reading her a story and felt someone sit on the bed with us with a great
thud.  My aunt was no little woman but always a beautiful one.  The strangest
thing that has happened recently is that an old makeup case with a cameo
on it (with the powder still in it) has appeared in my home. I know I did
not get this from my mom because we do not speak.  It sits on my bookcase.
 When my husband and I married, I decided to use her wedding band, but it
causes blisters on my fingers, and always appears in the jewelry box that
I keep in my daughter's room.  So now I know, that my Aunt Grace wants my
daughter to have it instead of me!</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=court>4 Harrison Court</A></B>
</H3><P><B>by sherylv@justhanson.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've always wondered what was going on in the house I grew up in. It
was</B>
<P><B>only 20 years old when we bought it. We knew the builders, and it had</B>
<P><B>had only one owner since then, an old woman who kept cats.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother bought the house when I was 4, and from day one, I was</B>
<P><B>terrified in there. It just felt wrong. It was a small house, only
2</B>
<P><B>bedrooms, all on one level, with the exception of an attic and a</B>
<P><B>basement. There were definitely sections of the house that felt
"safe"</B>
<P><B>and sections that did not. The back bedroom, the back bedroom closet,</B>
<P><B>the bathroom, and the short steps and hallway leading to the back
door</B>
<P><B>and basement, were not. The front bedroom, living room, and
ironically</B>
<P><B>enough, the kitchen ( so long as you kept your eye on that back hall)</B>
<P><B>were safe.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The things that occurred in the house were experienced by the entire</B>
<P><B>family, though my mother and older sister always had a "reasonable</B>
<P><B>explanation" for them. Heavy breathing could often be heard (moms</B>
<P><B>explanation...the swingset up the road creaking). Footsteps across
the</B>
<P><B>ceiling.(m.ex...the neighbors. now our house sat alone and shared no</B>
<P><B>walls so how would we hear the neighbors going up their stairs,
inside</B>
<P><B>their house??? ) Items that were set down would suddenly vanish, only
to</B>
<P><B>reappear after much frantic hunting. But worse than that was the
"feel".</B>
<P><B>People were loath to do anything that would make a loud
noise.Vacumning,</B>
<P><B>showering, flushing the toilet, frying food, anything that made a</B>
<P><B>coverup noise. It always made you want to spin around and run, when
you</B>
<P><B>couldn't hear past the noise you were making. As if it were allowing</B>
<P><B>something to sneak up on you.  When anyone went down to the basement,</B>
<P><B>which housed the washer and dryer, they ineveitabley RAN down the</B>
<P><B>stairs. Those stairs....you just didn't want to be caught on them.
My</B>
<P><B>mom was a compulsive decorater, and the only spot in the house that
did</B>
<P><B>not boast ornamentation was the hall leading to the basement stairs.</B>
<P><B>Even SHE couldn't bear to be in there long enough to hang a picture.</B>
<P><B>Once in the basement, the person felt compelled to keep a running,</B>
<P><B>shouted conversation whith whomever was upstairs. You did NOT want
to be</B>
<P><B>cut off, down there.  Sleeping in this house was a nightmare, the</B>
<P><B>overwhelming fear of shutting off the light, and daring to sleep.</B>
<P><B>Myself, and my neice both experienced this.  In the back bedroom,
too,</B>
<P><B>there was a closet. The closet door had a tendency to suddenly slam</B>
<P><B>open. My moms explanation? It was hung crooked. When I was 14, tired
of</B>
<P><B>it, I put a latch on it. Some years later, the door flung itself open</B>
<P><B>hard enough to send the latch flying through the opposite window.
Hung</B>
<P><B>crooked indeed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The most terrifying event in the house was experienced by myself, my</B>
<P><B>neice and my dog. We were sleeping, both in my room, my sister was</B>
<P><B>asleep on the sofa, and my mom in her room. Jennifer and I were
awakened</B>
<P><B>by a voice, from the area of the basement, calling my name. I thought
it</B>
<P><B>was my sister and asked her what she wanted. I woke her up. It had
not</B>
<P><B>been her. I woke my mom up. It had not been her. While I was talking
to</B>
<P><B>my mother, the voice came again, telling me to come to it. My neice</B>
<P><B>asked my mom if she had heard it, and my mother replied that she had</B>
<P><B>heard nothing, and that we were dreaming. Both of us, dreaming the
same</B>
<P><B>dream. Ooookay :) It went on all night, and my dog, gaurdian of my</B>
<P><B>wellbeing, hid under the bed and whimpered.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We lived in that house for 17 years. During that time we had bedding</B>
<P><B>switched from one bed to another, tapes and records moved under</B>
<P><B>furniture, and perhaps the most puzzling, we came home daily for a
week,</B>
<P><B>to find bowls of hot food, and cups of steaming tea, set out as
though</B>
<P><B>someone had just been there, yet the house was locked. We had a
neighbor</B>
<P><B>watch the house, to make sure neighborhood kids weren't coming in,
but</B>
<P><B>nobody was seen to enter.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To this day, whenever my neice, or myself, have a nightmare, it is
set</B>
<P><B>in that house. No dreams that take place in that house turn out to
be</B>
<P><B>good ones. I have actually had dreams that were going along fine,
until</B>
<P><B>I realized where I was..... I also remember having a dream that I was</B>
<P><B>married, and my husband had purchased a house. He took me to see our
new</B>
<P><B>home, and you guessed it...it was 4 Harrison court. In the dream, the</B>
<P><B>most amazing wave of terror swept over me, at the thought of stepping</B>
<P><B>into that house again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We have no idea what was wrong with it, we know the woman who bought
it</B>
<P><B>from us, and she still lives in it. We have no idea if she's had any</B>
<P><B>problems. It is and will remain, a mystery.</B>

<P><B>As several women have noted in stories on this page, what I usually
call the</B>
<P><B>Talent seems to run through the female line in my family. I don't
know</B>
<P><B>whether my mother ever had many experiences, but from the stories that
her</B>
<P><B>mother told me (my grandmother lived with us all the time I was growing
up,</B>
<P><B>until I was almost nineteen) she, herself, was very used to
"occurences",</B>
<P><B>as were her mother, her aunts, etc.  One of my great aunts was known
for</B>
<P><B>infallibility at picking Kentucky Derby winner; the ony time she
missed,</B>
<P><B>was the one time she attempted to bet on the race...dead wrong! She
never</B>
<P><B>bet, or missed, again!</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story, though, concerns the day my mother died.  Depression, as
well</B>
<P><B>as Talent, runs in the female line, and I wnder, sometimes, if the
two are</B>
<P><B>somehow twisted together....?  Anyway, the October after I turned
eighteen,</B>
<P><B>I came downstairs in the morning, to find my mother sitting at the
kitchen,</B>
<P><B>at the end of what looked to have been a long and terrible crying
spree.</B>
<P><B>She had recently started a new job, working at a place that taught
the use</B>
<P><B>of microcomputers and wordprocessors, and she had gotten me into one
of the</B>
<P><B>first classes there, so we would ride in together.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she and my father had
finally</B>
<P><B>had it out the night before, and that they were going to get divorced.
 I</B>
<P><B>was stunned.  I knew they had problems, but never realized how bad
things</B>
<P><B>were between them.  Dad had agreeed to pack his stuff and leave, and
Mom</B>
<P><B>would get everything else.  We were living on a fifty-acre farm with
a two</B>
<P><B>hundred+ year old house, with barns, outbuildings, etc.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I wasn't exactly a calm person myself by this point....my mother and
I had</B>
<P><B>only recently started talking to each other as adults, and maybe
friends,</B>
<P><B>moving the parent-child relationship into its next step.I tried to
comfort</B>
<P><B>her, and figure out what I could do to help, and assure her that
everything</B>
<P><B>was going to turn out for the best...while at the same time, the
small</B>
<P><B>child inside was howling her anguish, trying to figure how her world
had</B>
<P><B>come crashing down overnight.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was fairly protected, growing up..I new the horrible things that
happened</B>
<P><B>in the real world, but they didn't touch me, really, out there on the</B>
<P><B>farm...both parents had been married, and divorced, before they met
each</B>
<P><B>other, and both had children from previous marraiges...I grew up with
my</B>
<P><B>older sister, my mothers first daughter, and I loved her dearly; I
couldn't</B>
<P><B>even think how this would affect her.  She had already left for the
day.  I</B>
<P><B>never thought they would split, my parents, I thought they could heal
their</B>
<P><B>troubles...</B>
<P>
<P><B>After we had sat for a while, and cried, and had our tea, it was
getting</B>
<P><B>towards the latest we could leave, and make it to where we were going,
and</B>
<P><B>be on time.  My mother was still shaken, and told me to take my car
in,</B>
<P><B>she'd join me later.  I asked if she was sure, and she said, yes, she
had</B>
<P><B>to compose herself, and get herself straightened out for work; she'd
be in</B>
<P><B>later, and to tell the woman she worked with what was happening, so
she'd</B>
<P><B>know why mom was late.  I took my leave, hugged and kissed her, and
left,</B>
<P><B>telling her I'd see her there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Its was a 30 minute drive in, and I don't know how I made
it....auto-pilot,</B>
<P><B>perhaps.  When I got in, I told moms boss what had happened, and that
Mom</B>
<P><B>would been in when she felt ready, perhaps in half an hour.  I had
offered</B>
<P><B>to drive us both, but Mom said no, she wanted to take care of a few
things,</B>
<P><B>and perhaps talk to dad one more time before he left, he was going
to start</B>
<P><B>packing that morning....</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, it got to be half an hour later, and I was having the worst time
of</B>
<P><B>my life, trying to concentrate on my work.  Suddenly, I realized that
a</B>
<P><B>truly odd sensation was coming over me: I was sleepy, and just didn't
care,</B>
<P><B>and things were coming in and out of focus around me.  Moms boss (my</B>
<P><B>teacher) had been checking on me every once in a while, and she pulled
me</B>
<P><B>out of the room.  "you look horrible...and your mom isn't in yet. 
Are you</B>
<P><B>okay?"  I told her I *had* to use the phone, NOW!  Something was
insisting</B>
<P><B>to me that I call home.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I phoned, and woke up my father.   I told him that I knew what was
going</B>
<P><B>on, and was mom still there?  He said no, she left for work hours ago,
and</B>
<P><B>i replied that no, she was still there when I left, she had sent me
ahead.</B>
<P><B>Then I insisted he go look for her, she WAS still there, GO FIND HER
NOW!</B>
<P><B>Somehting in my voice must have gotten to him, because he said he
would,</B>
<P><B>and would call as soon as he found out.  I asked, should I come home,
and</B>
<P><B>he said no, wait for my call.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Twenty minutes later, my sister showed up, and said "get in the car,
we're</B>
<P><B>going home" and wouldn't say much else on the ride back.  She listen
while</B>
<P><B>I told her what Mom had said that morning, and started cursing my
father,</B>
<P><B>and I don't blame her, really.  And On the ride home, the blackest
cloud of</B>
<P><B>despair came over me suddenly.  I ha wanted to drive my own car home,
and</B>
<P><B>now was glad I didn't.....I was so upset, I couldn't breathe, could
hardly</B>
<P><B>see, and didn't say what I felt to my sister.  I knew, then, Mom was
dead,</B>
<P><B>or close to it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When we arrived home, there were was a police car, and officer in the
yard,</B>
<P><B>talking to my father, who looked like he'd been hit with a frieght</B>
<P><B>train...stunned white, calm, but in shock.  Thats when they gave me
the</B>
<P><B>news....mom had killed herself.  She'd driven down in the back field,
run</B>
<P><B>some vacuum hosing into her back window, and asphyxiated herself with
the</B>
<P><B>exhaust fumes.  My father found her, did mouth-to- mouth, and
scrambled</B>
<P><B>back up to thehouse to call an ambulance, and grab an oxygen we had
kept on</B>
<P><B>hand, in case on of my grandmothers should happen to have breathing</B>
<P><B>problems.  They lost her enroute to the hospital, which was a mercy,
since</B>
<P><B>she had inhaled so much of the fumes that her color had changed, and
if she</B>
<P><B>had lived, she would have been a vegetable. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I had to give my statement to the police, and then they left us to
our</B>
<P><B>grief.  But I know, as deeply as anything I've ever felt, that I felt
my</B>
<P><B>mothers dying moment, on the way home that day.  I felt it when she
was</B>
<P><B>leaving, and dad brought her back, and I felt her final moments.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Days, or weeks, that time is confused and mostly lost to me, I talked
to my</B>
<P><B>grandmother about it.  Allt he time mom was growing up, if something</B>
<P><B>happened, or was going to happen to her, her mother recieved warning
of one</B>
<P><B>sort or another....once, it was a knocking that followed her throughout
the</B>
<P><B>house; this time, she said, about two or three days before it happened,
my</B>
<P><B>grandmother spent a good fifteen minutes talking with HER
mother.....before</B>
<P><B>she realized that her mother had been dead for forty years, and the</B>
<P><B>apparition she was talking to was only her mothers head.....so she
put it</B>
<P><B>out of her mind, until the moment we talked.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several times since that awful year, I've seen or felt my mother</B>
<P><B>nearby...usually trying tosave me from some folly of my own, once at
least</B>
<P><B>saving my life.  I fell asleep driving home late one night, and woke
up</B>
<P><B>abruptly, hearing her voice saying my name, telling me to wake up NOW!
 I</B>
<P><B>was in the high speed lane of the OTHER side of the road, with a car
coming</B>
<P><B>at me!  I had just enough time to correct, and settle back to my side
of</B>
<P><B>the road....and believe me, I was wide awake the rest of the ride
home.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've had other warnings, and seen other things, but as so many others
have</B>
<P><B>said here...that is a tale for another day......</B>

<H3><A NAME=top>The Top of the Stairs</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	epona99@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I came across your web page and was facinated..I am 43 years old but</B>
<P><B>have had many experiences with ghosts since childhood that I feel are</B>
<P><B>related to 2 near death experiences I had at age 5 and at age
8..After</B>
<P><B>these I was able to both see and hear ghosts, or sense them and have</B>
<P><B>been involved off and on with people who have had terrifying
encounters</B>
<P><B>in homes and businesses and are seeking help to rid themselves of
these</B>
<P><B>enities..I seem to have a talent, brought back with me from 'the
other</B>
<P><B>side'  in childhood for turning souls to the light..The NDEs are
another</B>
<P><B>story however...</B>
<P><B> My first personal experience with a ghost was when I was about 6
years</B>
<P><B>old. I grew up in a small town in Southern Kansas that had a large</B>
<P><B>number of victorian houses, some quite elaborate and well maintained.</B>
<P><B>Most were nice, old family homes, most built in the 1870s and quite
safe</B>
<P><B>but as with all  small towns a few had a rather sinister
reputation...</B>
<P><B> One afternoon my grandmother and I were invited to tea by one of her</B>
<P><B>frinends. The woman had just bought an old victorian house on 10th</B>
<P><B>street and was looking forward to restoring the place when she and
her</B>
<P><B>husband both retired the next year.</B>
<P><B> When we pulled up in front I began to feel uneasy..the house looked</B>
<P><B>predatory, what in my 6 yr old mind I thought of as 'hungary'..With</B>
<P><B>great foreboding I followed my grandmother in and sat down in the
front</B>
<P><B>parlor where they began a long and now forgotten gossip session with</B>
<P><B>each other. I rember sitting there feeling completly frozen, and</B>
<P><B>wondering why my grandmother and her friend could not feel the cold
in</B>
<P><B>the air and the faint buzzing sound I seemed to keep hearing...</B>
<P><B> My undoing came when finanlly having only a 6 year olds bladder, I
need</B>
<P><B>to find the bathroom. The lady said to use the one upstairs since the</B>
<P><B>one off the kitchen was still being renovated. My feet dragging I
walked</B>
<P><B>out the pocket doors of the parlor and into the entrance hall to begin
a</B>
<P><B>very long climb up the stairs to the bathroom at the top.</B>
<P><B> Like many houses of this period the stairs had a landing and then</B>
<P><B>turned to create a flight up to the second floor..I had just started
to</B>
<P><B>climb the steps toward the landing when I looked up and standing
there</B>
<P><B>was a very pretty young woman in a white silk nighthown that looked
like</B>
<P><B>something a movie star of the 1920s or 30s would wear..She was
stading</B>
<P><B>on the landing with one hand sort of hidden in the folds of her gown
and</B>
<P><B>beconing to me with the other hand..The thing I rember was her hair
was</B>
<P><B>short and wavy in what I later found was called a marcel wave popular
in</B>
<P><B>the 20s and how the llight from a window beside her shimmered over
her</B>
<P><B>light brown hair..I took in all these details quickly because next
I</B>
<P><B>gazed up, still climbing the stairs as if my feet were not my own,</B>
<P><B>heading toward that long white hand that was motioning me to come</B>
<P><B>closer. Then I looked at her face and all hell broke loose!!</B>
<P><B> I must have fainted and tumbled back down the steps. The next thing
I</B>
<P><B>rember was my grandmother and her friend slapping my cheeks and
yelling</B>
<P><B>my name. I imediatly began screaming and crying, "Blood..she is
covered</B>
<P><B>in blood!!" and pointing at the landing..This of course broke up the
tea</B>
<P><B>party and I was taken home in disgrace since I apparently wet my
pants</B>
<P><B>when I passed out but even that humiliation was nothing compared to
the</B>
<P><B>relief I felt at getting away from that house...</B>
<P><B> For what I saw in that womans face is still with me in my worst</B>
<P><B>nightmares. She was smiling but it was the most hateful, wicked and
evil</B>
<P><B>grin I have ever seen!! Her eyes were just blank holes..no
eyeballs..and</B>
<P><B>her face was covered in blood!! Somehow I knew she had a butcher
knife</B>
<P><B>in her other hand and was preparing to use it on me!!</B>
<P><B> Years later, when I was in high school, I finally found out the
story</B>
<P><B>of the house on 10th street.  This was long after my grandmothers
death</B>
<P><B>and her friends. One day on my way home from school I decided to take
a</B>
<P><B>diffrent route, I realize now that I had avoided even passing in
front</B>
<P><B>of the house for years on foot as if it would reach out and grab me.
I</B>
<P><B>noticed the house was being torn down and stopped to look. A young
woman</B>
<P><B>drove up and stopped at the curb, getting out to join me on the
sidewalk</B>
<P><B>in front. She proved to be one of grandmothers old friends daughters
and</B>
<P><B>seemed quite cheerful about the destruction of the place. We began</B>
<P><B>talikig and she described how her parents were both sticken with
fatal</B>
<P><B>illnessess within a year of moving in and how after their deaths the</B>
<P><B>family had been unable to sell or even rent the house..</B>
<P><B> "Don't you know what happened there?" she asked. She then told me
that</B>
<P><B>in the 1920s a young couple lived in the house, she apparently came
from</B>
<P><B>a fairly wealthy and prominent family in the area. The rumor reached
her</B>
<P><B>that her husband was having a number of affairs with women all over
town</B>
<P><B>and had a number of illigetimate childeren scatered around the
county.</B>
<P><B>Being spoiled, over indulged and addicted to drugs and bootleg booze
did</B>
<P><B>not help her mood and she began to brood. One day she called her
husband</B>
<P><B>at his law office and suggensted he come home for lunch and no dbout
an</B>
<P><B>amorous encounter offered to make sure he showed up.</B>
<P><B> Apparently she was waiting for him on the landing of the stairs in
a</B>
<P><B>fancy nightie and holding a butcher knife. They later said she must
of</B>
<P><B>stabbed him over 70 or 80 times and muliated the body, leaving it at
the</B>
<P><B>base of the stairs. She was found in an upstairs bedroom dead of an</B>
<P><B>overdose of narcotics that were legal to buy in any drug store at
that</B>
<P><B>time....</B>
<P><B> You can imagine my reaction to the womans story...and her reaction
to</B>
<P><B>mine! I later went back into the local newspaper files and found the</B>
<P><B>story as she related it to me, having happened in 1922 and was quite
the</B>
<P><B>scandal of the time.</B>
<P><B> The lady herself had never lived in the house after her parents
bought</B>
<P><B>it since she was married with a home of her own but she described the</B>
<P><B>place as, 'unwholesome' and 'evil' and refused to set foot in the
place</B>
<P><B>after her parents death..</B>
<P><B> The reason I do not give the town name or family names is because
many</B>
<P><B>of these peoples decendants still live in the area..the last time I</B>
<P><B>drove past where the house use to be I noticed it had become a small</B>
<P><B>neighborhood playground! Despite being a nice summer day with many</B>
<P><B>children playing in yards and porches on either side of the lot, no
kids</B>
<P><B>would get close to the tempting swings and jungle gyms set up
there....I</B>
<P><B>did not need to stop and ask any of these children why. It is still
a</B>
<P><B>dark spot even on a sunny day.</B>

<H3><A NAME=hand>The Writing on My Hand</A>
</H3><P><B>by ldkk@flash.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was only two days before i was going to leave my house in the
middle</B>
<P><B>east to come to the U.S. to live there. Evereyone was excited,
because</B>
<P><B>we didn't like it that much there anyway. But i liked it there, though
i</B>
<P><B>had no problem living in the U.S. because i had been there many times</B>
<P><B>before.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We only had three paranormal  experiences in our former house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night i accidently fell asleep on the den couch, i woke up</B>
<P><B>frantically wondering how i fell asleep in the den, but i soon
realized</B>
<P><B>that i accindently fell asleep there.</B>
<P><B>I sat up, and heard some footsteps in the room, it was a marble floor,
i</B>
<P><B>called out "mom" but no answer, it was really dark, and then i saw
a</B>
<P><B>shadow, it didn't look like the shadow of a human, but more like a
big</B>
<P><B>irregular shaped figure, and it just walked by slowly as if it didn't</B>
<P><B>notice me. And then it disapeared.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My second experience was when my cat, saw something that i didn't
see,</B>
<P><B>the cat arched it's back, it's hair standing on end, and hissing</B>
<P><B>furiously. I jumped in front of the cat but still it kept hissing</B>
<P><B>furiously. It was only until i put my hand over the cats eyes that
it</B>
<P><B>stopped.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My third experience was two days before i left to move to the U.S.
I</B>
<P><B>woke up on a Friday morning to find writing on my hand, it was done
with</B>
<P><B>a red pen, if you were wondering what it said, i'm sorry but I
couldn't</B>
<P><B>read a word it said, it was more like cursive but unreadable, i
should</B>
<P><B>it to my mom and dad, with my hand shaking but they couldn't read it</B>
<P><B>either. I washed it off, but still it wouldn't disapear completely,
it</B>
<P><B>took three days of scrubing and bathing to get it off. I still go
back</B>
<P><B>to our old house every summer because my father still lives there,
and</B>
<P><B>he told me that nothing happend while i was gone. And he was still
in</B>
<P><B>disbelief that there was any paranormal activity in the house. But
my</B>
<P><B>mom new that there was something going on in that house, but not a
ghost</B>
<P><B>or spirit.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I only have one explanation for this activity, I think that the ghost</B>
<P><B>didn't want me to go, afterall these activities only happend in my</B>
<P><B>existance, it didn't happen to anyone else in my family.</B>
<P>
<P><B>If there is anyone else who could know another explanation please
email</B>

<H3><A NAME=suicide>The Suicide Haunting</A>
</H3><P><B>by gom@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 13 years old, I used to babysit quite a lot in my</B>
<P><B>neighborhood. Back then, I didn't believe in ghosts or the
paranormal.</B>
<P>
<P><B>  I lived in upstate New Jersey at the time My foster family had</B>
<P><B>recently moved into a new housing development in a small suburban
town</B>
<P><B>near the New York State border.  The house next door to us was an old</B>
<P><B>farmhouse (the housing development had been built on what had once
been</B>
<P><B>the farm).  The farmhouse had supposedly been built during the mid
to</B>
<P><B>late 1700's.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I came home from a babysitting job late one night, I looked out
the</B>
<P><B>window for several minutes at the stars, trying to find the different</B>
<P><B>constellations, as was my habit just about every night.  Then I saw
a</B>
<P><B>"ball of mist" which appeared to be "walking" down the middle of the</B>
<P><B>road.  I thought that it must be some kind of gas or water vapor,</B>
<P><B>although I'd never seen anything like it in my life.  It seemed so</B>
<P><B>"deliberate".  It never veered from the road.  I watched it go to the</B>
<P><B>end of the block and make a right into the woods that lead to New
York</B>
<P><B>State.  It was weird but I figured that there must be some rational</B>
<P><B>explanation for it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The couple who had just moved into the old farmhouse, needed a</B>
<P><B>babysitter for a Saturday night for their 4 year old daughter.  I
agreed</B>
<P><B>to babysit.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I arrived at the couple's house about 7PM on a hot summer night.  As</B>
<P><B>soon as I entered the house, their Doberman Pincher ran up to me and</B>
<P><B>started barking at me and howling.  He wouldn't stop regardless of
what</B>
<P><B>the couple tried to do.  His howls became shrill and he began to
growl</B>
<P><B>at me.  I'd never been afraid of animals, as I'd grown up around dogs</B>
<P><B>and I like animals very much.  This dog really scared me just the
same.</B>
<P><B>The husband put the dog down in the garage where it finally stopped</B>
<P><B>howling.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I met the little girl and then the mother put her to bed in her
upstairs</B>
<P><B>bedroom.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When the couple left, I turned on the T.V.. Despite the hot night,
there</B>
<P><B>was not even as much as a fan in the house, yet the house was</B>
<P><B>comfortablly cool.</B>
<P>
<P><B>At about 10 or 11 PM that night, the T.V. began to have
"interferance"</B>
<P><B>and the lights dimmed noticeably.  The television began to get so
much</B>
<P><B>interferance that it became impossible to watch.  The lights dimmed
even</B>
<P><B>more.  I thought that there must be something wrong with the
electrical</B>
<P><B>wiring in the old house.  I sat by the light and began to read.  The</B>
<P><B>house was becoming cooler.  Despite the hot night outside, this house</B>
<P><B>was becoming cold.  There was an afgan on the back of the couch, which
I</B>
<P><B>wrapped around me.  I went to the window, wondering why it was
suddenly</B>
<P><B>becoming cold.  The window pane was warm!  It was certainly warmer
than</B>
<P><B>that house was at that moment.  I tried to open the window to "let
the</B>
<P><B>warm air in" but I could not budge any of the windows.  The outside</B>
<P><B>world looked so strange from instide that house, as though you were</B>
<P><B>looking at something far away or were looking at a picture of
something</B>
<P><B>rather than reality.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then I began to hear what sounded like a light footfall at the top
of</B>
<P><B>the stairs.  I could only hear them coming down but not up, on about
the</B>
<P><B>top 1/3 of the stairway.  I looked to see if the little girl had
gotten</B>
<P><B>up but she was  sound asleep with her sheet tucked in around her.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I sat reading, the footfall became closer and got louder.  I stood
by</B>
<P><B>the stairway and watched.  I saw nothing but could still hear the</B>
<P><B>footfall.  I thought that this old house must still be "settling" to
be</B>
<P><B>making all this noise. Then the footfalls became a pounding and
seemed</B>
<P><B>to reach the end of the stairwell.  They were closer together, loud
and</B>
<P><B>insistant  But always, always, only descending the staircase, never</B>
<P><B>ascending it..  Than I heard a loud "bang" from the room directly in</B>
<P><B>line with the stairway at the top.  I raced to the room thinking that
I</B>
<P><B>might find the little girl there or a small animal which might have</B>
<P><B>gotten into the house and knocked something over.  I turned on the
light</B>
<P><B>to the room,; the room was VERY cold and the light very dim.  The
child</B>
<P><B>was not there and nothing was out of place.  I recoiled promptly from</B>
<P><B>the small, frigid room.  The hairs at the back of my nect were
standing</B>
<P><B>up and I felt a strange sensation, as though a current of electricity</B>
<P><B>was coursing though my spine to the base of my skull. I checked on
the</B>
<P><B>little girl, who was sound asleep despite the racket and still tucked</B>
<P><B>snugly into her bed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>At this point, I was getting scared but figured that there still must
be</B>
<P><B>some rational explanation for what was happening.  The footsteps</B>
<P><B>continued their pounding but now they descended all the way to the</B>
<P><B>foyer.  There was a deep, shag carpet runner along the foyer.  I
could</B>
<P><B>hear creaking floorboards beneath it and indentations in the carpet
as</B>
<P><B>though someone were pacing on it.  I thought that there must be some</B>
<P><B>"really small animal" on the carpet and decided to try to "catch it".
 I</B>
<P><B>planted myself in the middle of the carpet when something came over
me;</B>
<P><B>everything went dark for a second.  I felt as though someone had
thrown</B>
<P><B>something over my head and for a few seconds, I couldn't breathe.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This was no "small animal".  I was petrified.  I ran up the stairs
to</B>
<P><B>check the child and she was still fast asleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After the incident on the carpet, the footfalls started to make their</B>
<P><B>way up the staircase.  It was like a playback of what had been going
on</B>
<P><B>most of the night, only in reverse.  By the time the footfalls
reached</B>
<P><B>the top third of the stairwell, they had stopped the insistant
pounding</B>
<P><B>and were only lightly "stepping", yet still only descending the</B>
<P><B>stairway.  Finally, they disappeared entirely.  The lights resumed
their</B>
<P><B>brightness and the television was no longer bothered by
"interference".</B>
<P><B>By this time it was about 2 AM and  this "stair-walking" had gone on
for</B>
<P><B>several hours.  All through this, there had not been one peep from
the</B>
<P><B>dog in the garage.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The couple returned home about 4 AM.  They asked me, "if everything
had</B>
<P><B>been alright".  I had felt as though I must be losing my mind.  I
just</B>
<P><B>told them that everything had "been OK".</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day, my foster sister made a point of asking me, "how did
the</B>
<P><B>babysitting go?"  I told her, "that house is really WEIRD!"  Then she</B>
<P><B>told me, "I didn't want to tell you before you went babysitting
because</B>
<P><B>I didn't want to scare you".  She proceeded to tell me that the
former</B>
<P><B>owners had told her that the house was haunted.  They told her that
all</B>
<P><B>the members of the family had seen the ghost many times.  They
explained</B>
<P><B>that one of the original owners of the house, a Mr. H., had committed</B>
<P><B>sucide my hanging himself from the attic door which was diredtly
above</B>
<P><B>the top landing of the stairwell.  They had taken my sister for a
tour</B>
<P><B>of the house.  When they had been renovating the house, they had</B>
<P><B>discovered that the house beams and studs had been joined together
by</B>
<P><B>wooden pegs and not nails.  This was a very old construction
technique,</B>
<P><B>that was used because making wooden pegs was easier than having to
make</B>
<P><B>nails.  They took my foster sister for a tour of the cellar, which</B>
<P><B>consisted of a maze-like collection of windowless cubicles.  In each
of</B>
<P><B>the cubicles were manacles for hands and feet.  Had Mr. H.bought
slaves</B>
<P><B>to use as farm workers?  In that area, the growing season is short
and</B>
<P><B>the winters long and cold.  Buying slaves would hardly have been
"cost</B>
<P><B>effective" for such a short period of time.  Long ago, the land there</B>
<P><B>had belonged to the Ramapo Indians.  Had Mr. H. taken these people
as</B>
<P><B>seasonal slaves and "dispensed with" them after harvest time?</B>
<P>
<P><B>My friends went down to the town's city hall to check the records of
the</B>
<P><B>house.  The records showed that the house was considerably newer than</B>
<P><B>had been thought (about mid-nineteenth century).  This was after
slavery</B>
<P><B>had been discontinued in the northeast.  The former owners of the
house,</B>
<P><B>who were also builders and renovators of old houses, said that the
mode</B>
<P><B>of construction that was used in the house, would date the house as</B>
<P><B>being  much older.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I guess we will never know who was kept manacled in those airless
little</B>
<P><B>rooms in the cellar.  We will never know why Mr. H. was driven to</B>
<P><B>suicide or if his death was indeed a suicide.  Was the ghost that of
Mr.</B>
<P><B>H. or of someone else?  Perhaps  there is more than one tormented
spirit</B>
<P><B>in that "troubled"  household.</B>

<P><B>Dear Sir: Nice to visit your site. The place I live is full of
paranormal</B>
<P><B>activities. This was a very old cremation ground for Hindus on the</B>
<P><B>embankment of rivewr Gomti. Earlier due to flooding with watewr of
rainy</B>
<P><B>season and of the river people used to cremate in the greater area.
Now</B>
<P><B>this cremation is restricted to a quarter square kilometer. People
who live</B>
<P><B>here experience too much miseries, un-natural deaths, unrestricted</B>
<P><B>sufferings and blokade in their work and work/business; althjough some
are</B>
<P><B>affluent and resourseful. In my house alone,which is about 70-100
years</B>
<P><B>old, we experience different encounters with unexplained phenomenon
which</B>
<P><B>we try first to analyse logically and with resoning but fail to get
a</B>
<P><B>satisfactory answer. These are visualising images, sightings, gush
aroma</B>
<P><B>stepping sounds etc.As I practice Yoga and Alternative Medicine
therapies</B>
<P><B>so I have an idea of the occurance and autheniticity of these
phenonmenon.</B>
<P><B>We just observe and analyse and never accept the experiences on</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by MaReSaLFlA@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story goes way back to a when i was a child. I remember my mom
talking about her religious figures moving in the middle of the night.But
to her surprise that morning nothin was out of place. She even had someone
come in to see if a squirrel got into the house, it didnt. My sister remembers
hearing footsteps and the furniture in the basement moving, it sound like
there was a party going on down there. This only happened in the winter months.
I dont remember hearing any of that. Except footsteps in the hallway to our
bedrooms , my mother always told us it was our grandma, and of course she
wasnt there to scare us just look over us . We were never afraid of it. My
recollection of strange happenings started on the eve of December 26 1979.
That was the day my father passed away in that house. Of course i was the
only one home that morning. I was the one to find him.My mom had passed on
earlier that same year, may 20 1979.I never felt such fear . I as a child
was always afraid of this sort of thing happening to me ,and it did , I was
20 yrs old. I remember walking into his room and totally freaking out .That
evening after the whole family left myself and sister were to afraid to go
back to our room, it was right next to dads room. So we decided to sleep
in the living room. My sisters boyfriend at the time decided to stay with
us. It was around 12:30 am I was saying my prayers and also trying to figure
out what time he could have passed . In those days i slept in very late so
he wasnt found till one in the afternoon, when i awoke. He had been dead
for hours they said. All of a sudden i heard a clanging loud sound , at the
same time my sister and her boyfriend awoke by the same sound. I think he
was letting me know the time of his passing , it clanged 5 times...5 a.m.
That was just the beginning of things to follow. None of our family came
that often we often wondered why. We did find out years later ,that after
numerous time of telling our aunts and uncles, that we felt something in
the house ,The day the house sold they told us that they knew we were telling
the truth, but how could they admitt it to us, we had to live there. Wonderful
huh. We thought we were losing our minds. One of my aunts had a priest come
in to bless the house. It helped for a while. Then the banging, the smell
of flowers just the errie feeling in that house returned. I remember one
day about 3 in the afternoon there was a terrible storm, the lights went
out in the house ,at the time my son was 1 yr old . My sister took off work
for 6 weeks to stay with me , cause i wouldnt stay home alone. She finnally
had to go to work. She was expected home at 5, that day . After the lights
went out and the phone rang i heard from dads closet a knocking sound , i
mean loud knocking . I picked up my son and headed for a neigbors house.
I remained there till my sis came home. To say the least we sold the house
three yrs later. To this day I really dont Know what it was in that house.
I always thought it was my dad , but 20 yrs later I now do not think it was
him. I think it was pure evil there.I have married and moved to Florida I
wonder if the new occupents have any trouble in that house. When i go back
to visit the family and i get up the nerve, i might just drop in on them
to ask.</B>

<H3><A NAME=campfire>Campfire</A>
</H3><P><B>by angrybear@nbn.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife (Karen) and I decided to go on a camping trip with our three
children. We went to a campground we had visited several times before.On
the last day of our trip we the kids' bedding out on the line,because it
had a bad case of the smellys.We had a great day doing activities around
the campground,so we headed back to the camper for dinner. Karen decided
to make chicken for us, we cooked dinner and sat down to eat. I don't eat
chicken, so I ate the other things.  After dinner, we all went for a walk
to see the sights, half-way around Karen said she wasn't feeling well so
back to the camper we went/.  I had promised our boys I would toast marshmallows
with them.  By this time, it was getting late (9:30 PM) for the boys, Karen
said she would put the baby to bed and lay down herself.  The boys and I
toasted marshmallows for about an hour, they fell asleep in the chairs. 
Knowing I had to make their bed, I sat there awhile longer, and there he
was- an old Indian (Native American) he had long white hair a funny lookinghat
( like Peter Pan's) with one feather on the left side of it.  He seemed to
be 5 feet 9 inched tall and thin.. Around his neck were some sort of charms,
a bag hung down to his waist, and he had a pipe.  He was dressed in buckskin
pants, and a shirt (no, he wasn't wearing war-paint). He was warming his
hands on the west side of the fire(water-spiritual side to native belief).
 As I was studying him, he turned, looked at me, smiled, and disappeared.
 I sat there for awhile, thinking I must be going crazy.  The two boys were
still asleep on their chairs, so I got up to make their beds, but the sheets,
blankets and pillows were gone.  I looked in the camper and their bed was
made perfectly.  The next morning, I thanked Karen for making their bed for
me.  She told me, "I didn't make it."  I then told her my story and we agreed
that was really weird.  This happened over one year ago, and since then each
time trouble comes my way, I hear Indian drums.  How bad the trouble is,
depends on how long I hear the drums.  The experience is one that sits well
in my memory, the Indian made an impression that will last through my
lifetime.</B>

</H3><P><B>by canuslupus@uswest.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am 23,and live with my folks</B>
<P><B>in an apartment(don't laugh),and every once in a while my</B>
<P><B>mother and I see dark shapes from the corners of our</B>
<P><B>eyes.This happens once in a while,and sometimes we can</B>
<P><B>perceive a spectral cat through the sounds it makes.We think</B>
<P><B>it is one of our former cats(We have had many through the</B>
<P><B>years).Recently I purchased a human skull through a</B>
<P><B>mailorder company in Berkely.It is a chinese skull,with no</B>
<P><B>teeth,and slight damage.I usually keep the skull on my desk</B>
<P><B>next to my PC,but I kept it next to the head of my bed for a</B>
<P><B>while.Recently,something curious happened.I was sleeping,and</B>
<P><B>awoke to a dark figure standing over me next to the bed(My</B>
<P><B>bed is a boxspring,and mattress on the floor).I couldn't</B>
<P><B>tell if the figure was angry,or what,but I felt very spooked</B>
<P><B>at this.I am not sure if I should chalk this up to</B>
<P><B>grogginess,or perhaps the human remnant attracted this</B>
<P><B>entity.I could not see the face,but it was definately</B>
<P><B>looking at me.I have not seen it since.I am uncertain as to</B>
<P><B>whether it was apparition of the skull in life,or if it is</B>
<P><B>the shadow we sometimes spot from the corner of our</B>
<P><B>eyes.Geez,I'm getting chills just typing this up...</B>

<H3><A NAME=hope>New Hope</A>
</H3><P><B>by name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>I grew up in a house that my parent's built in New Hope, PA.  New Hope
is</B>
<P><B>an old town located on the Delaware River (not too far from
Washington's</B>
<P><B>Crossing) - it's an old mill town that dates back to the 1700's at
least (I</B>
<P><B>haven't yet researched the founding - but have been toying with the
idea to</B>
<P><B>write a book about it's history and might even explore writing about</B>
<P><B>paranormal activities in New Hope if I find enough information - this
will</B>
<P><B>have to be in the future since I'm currently in college and raising
two</B>
<P><B>children) - it originally had a different name, but when the town
burnt</B>
<P><B>down, the residents rebuilt giving it the name of New Hope.  New Hope
is</B>
<P><B>now more of a tourist town and is quite a famous place for tourists
to</B>
<P><B>visit (it contains alot of quaint shops) in Pennsylvania.  In the
more</B>
<P><B>recent past, New Hope was where the reporter Jessica Savitch, her
boyfriend</B>
<P><B>and dog died when their car careened into the canal that runs through
the</B>
<P><B>town.  My parents home was located not far from this site, up a hill
called</B>
<P><B>Windy Bush Road (unfortunately they sold their house last year, but
the</B>
<P><B>events that happened to me there are intriguing and I think that when
I do</B>
<P><B>research the area, I might pop in on the new owners to see if they've
had</B>
<P><B>any out of the ordinary experiences).  My parents home sat on 11 acres
up</B>
<P><B>on a hill just outside of New Hope and was rumored to be part of a
parcel</B>
<P><B>of land that William Penn (the founder of Pennsylvania) was interested
in</B>
<P><B>purchasing.  Located next to the land that my parent's built this house
on</B>
<P><B>is a large and very old farmhouse and my parent's land was supposed
to have</B>
<P><B>been the farmhouses' field and pastures.  My parents bought the land
in the</B>
<P><B>early 1970's and during the construction animal skulls were found -
such as</B>
<P><B>cow skulls and smaller mammals like raccoons, foxes, mice, etc.  An</B>
<P><B>intriguing area on this property was what I refer to as the grave -
back</B>
<P><B>behind the barn that was built (we used to ride &amp; show horses)
was a deep</B>
<P><B>stretch of woods that my parent's shared with the furniture artist
George</B>
<P><B>Nakashima.  It was a large mound that was redish in color (I suppose
from</B>
<P><B>the clay soil). My childhood friend and I used to trail ride our
ponies</B>
<P><B>back deeply into these woods and also found a site that we referred
to as</B>
<P><B>elephant mountain - located at the edge of the hill - if you would
look</B>
<P><B>down you could you would see the town of New Hope and the Delaware
River</B>
<P><B>right below - was a large mound of rocks layed out into a huge pile
with a</B>
<P><B>pit recessed into one side.  Some inquiry to people familiar with the</B>
<P><B>revolutionary war (remember I mentioned the town is only a little way
from</B>
<P><B>where George Washington and his men crossed the Delaware river into
New</B>
<P><B>Jersey to attack the English at Trenton) have said that often
revoltionary</B>
<P><B>soldiers would build a mound similar to the one that I mentioned in
order</B>
<P><B>to slow down an advancing army - they would use the rock mound as a
wall</B>
<P><B>and they would sit behind it or in the recessed pit and shoot down
at the</B>
<P><B>enemy as they would try to climb up it.  Also, back in this wooded
area is</B>
<P><B>many rock fences that farmers used to use back in prerevolutionary
times.</B>
<P><B>Sorry to make this so long, but I'm trying to give you a sense of the
age &amp;</B>
<P><B>history of this town and the property that I grew up on in
particular.</B>
<P><B>Anyway - about a mile down the road from my parent's house is a
cemetary</B>
<P><B>that's all but forgotten and some of the graves date back to  the
early</B>
<P><B>1700's.</B>
<P><B>Now onto my experiences... The earliest experience that I can
remember</B>
<P><B>happened when I was quite young (perhaps 11 or 12) - I was just
falling</B>
<P><B>asleep on a hot summer night.  The house was shut up tight with the
air</B>
<P><B>conditioning running and the only other people in the house were my
parents</B>
<P><B>who also were in bed.  I was just drifting off when I remember
distincly</B>
<P><B>hearing the sound of a loud crash going down the stairs.  To
adequately</B>
<P><B>describe this enormously loud noise: it sounded like a large box
filled</B>
<P><B>with china and glass was being pushed down the steps and with each
step it</B>
<P><B>hit it crashed even louder.  As soon as the sound stopped I
instinctively</B>
<P><B>thought  that a robber was in the house and jumped out of bed, grabbed
a</B>
<P><B>pair of scissors and ran across the hall to my parent's bedroom.  My
Dad</B>
<P><B>opened the door and had a gun in his hand - he and my mother were woken
up</B>
<P><B>by the sound and as I coward in bed with my Mother, he searched the
house,</B>
<P><B>but nothing was there.  The next morning I went from the attic to the</B>
<P><B>basement and throughly search every inch of the house - nothing was
out of</B>
<P><B>sorts, no picture fell and broke, nothing could explain the loud
crashing</B>
<P><B>sound.  The next summer, the same sound occured, with the same exact</B>
<P><B>results, but never occured again while I was there.  Years before,
when my</B>
<P><B>sister lived with us in this house, she would complain of being kept
awake</B>
<P><B>by scratching noises on the ceiling of her room (which is below the
attic)</B>
<P><B>- my father put rat and mouse traps as well as poison up in the attack,
but</B>
<P><B>never caught a rodent or squirrel - none of the poison was ever touched
and</B>
<P><B>no rodent feces was ever found as evidence of who was making the
scratching</B>
<P><B>noises.  When I was in high school, I had another strange experience
- it</B>
<P><B>was early morning (7 am or so) and I got up to let my dog outside,
as I</B>
<P><B>walked into the kitchen, I heard a loud noise that sounded like a
huge</B>
<P><B>lawnmower being turned on, really a deafening sound, like a lawnmower
the</B>
<P><B>size of a semi reving it's engine.  The only thing was, my parents
were</B>
<P><B>still in bed and no one was outside cutting the grass.  I shrugged
it off,</B>
<P><B>especially since no one else heard this noise.  Years later after I
moved</B>
<P><B>out, my sister and her family moved back in with my parents after they
sold</B>
<P><B>their house and were waiting until one that they were building was
ready to</B>
<P><B>be moved into.  My mother told me that one evening my sister and her</B>
<P><B>children went out christmas shopping and she was alone in the house
with</B>
<P><B>the family dog (my father &amp; brother-in-law were still at work).
 She did</B>
<P><B>the books for my father's business and had a small office located off
of</B>
<P><B>the back of the house near the garage.  The back door was located just
on</B>
<P><B>the other side of this office and she was completely alone
calculating</B>
<P><B>figures and didn't have a radio or television on in the house.  She
said</B>
<P><B>suddenly the dog began growling and then she heard voices talking and</B>
<P><B>thought it was my sister speaking to her kids (my mother never heard
the</B>
<P><B>back door open and didn't see them pass by her doorway - the front
door was</B>
<P><B>never used so they couldn't have come into the house without her
noticing</B>
<P><B>them)- she said it wasn't a distinct conversation, but sounded more
like</B>
<P><B>murmuring.  When she and her dog got up and walked out the doorway,
the</B>
<P><B>voices immediately stopped.  My sister wasn't there (she returned an
hour</B>
<P><B>later) and again, my mother checked but no tvs or radios were on. 
In the</B>
<P><B>late summer of the following year (my sister &amp; her family had since
moved</B>
<P><B>out and into their new home)- I was pregnant with my first child and
would</B>
<P><B>help my mother out with the family business by doing paperwork for
her at</B>
<P><B>her house.  I wasn't living in her home, but would drive up a few times
a</B>
<P><B>week to do things like payroll and checks.  It was early afternoon
and my</B>
<P><B>mother left me alone in the house (she had a doctors appointment) while
I</B>
<P><B>worked on the week's payroll at the kitchen table.  The dog (named
Baxter)</B>
<P><B>was seated at my feet and the house was shut up tight with the air</B>
<P><B>conditioning on.  Located next to the kitchen on the way down the
hall</B>
<P><B>towards the stairs is a door which leads down into the finished
basement.</B>
<P><B>This door was located diagonally across from the refrigerator and after
my</B>
<P><B>mother had been gone for a half an hour or so I got up from the table
and</B>
<P><B>walked over to the refrigerator to get something cold to drink (the
dog</B>
<P><B>went over to the fridge with me - he usually would get a hot dog or
piece</B>
<P><B>of lunchmeat if he begged)- as I went to open the refrigerator door,
I</B>
<P><B>heard a loud and distinct knock coming from the other side of the
basement</B>
<P><B>door.  It was a rap, not like a bang, but a knock like one would do
to get</B>
<P><B>someone to open the door. It was like" knock, knock ,knock, knock,
knock"</B>
<P><B>and was very loud.  What's weird about this experience is that my
instinct</B>
<P><B>completely took over and my "fight or flight" instinct kicked in -
before I</B>
<P><B>knew it I had ran down the hall, past my mother's office room, and
out the</B>
<P><B>back door.  As I stood outside (with goosebumps from head to toe and
the</B>
<P><B>hair all over my body standing at attention) I realized that I had
just</B>
<P><B>left the house - this is how quickly my instincts had reacted - I
hadn't</B>
<P><B>even thought about the knocking or whether to run or not, my body just
ran,</B>
<P><B>which convinces me that my instincts kicked in because this was a
definate</B>
<P><B>paranormal experience (the dog ran out with me and was whining and
hiding</B>
<P><B>behind me as we stood outside).  After an hour we went back inside
and</B>
<P><B>waited in my Mom's office until she returned from her appointment.
 We</B>
<P><B>checked the house, but nothing out of the ordinary (as usual) and the</B>
<P><B>basement door had been locked up tight - the only other way into the</B>
<P><B>basement was another door and steps (which was locked and bolted) which
led</B>
<P><B>up into the garage (which also was locked).  I'd have to say that
hearing</B>
<P><B>this knock was the most real paranormal experience I had up to that
moment</B>
<P><B>or since and was made more real and frightening by the fact that my</B>
<P><B>instincts immediately took over and I ran without even thinking about
it.</B>
<P><B>Only one other incident happened before my parents sold the house
(not</B>
<P><B>because of the paranormal stuff, but for economic reasons and the fact
that</B>
<P><B>they are now too old to take care of a large property) - the spring
before</B>
<P><B>they put the house up on the market I went with my son to visit them</B>
<P><B>(interestingly - I was pregnant with my second child at the time) -
I was</B>
<P><B>greeted at the back door by my mother and as I walked into the kitchen,
I</B>
<P><B>saw the arm of a man as he walked past the side of the refrigerator
and</B>
<P><B>down the hall towards the stairs.  What I saw looked like a bare, male
arm</B>
<P><B>(hairy and muscular) - but this was it, no head or legs just a quick
flash</B>
<P><B>of an arm - I thought it was my Dad going down the hall and I called
to</B>
<P><B>him, but no reply.  I walked past the refrigerator and to the steps,
but he</B>
<P><B>wasn't there either.  I went up to his room, and found that he was
in the</B>
<P><B>shower, which means it wasn't his arm that I saw.  No one else was
in the</B>
<P><B>house (no workmen or other family members) - this occured 2 years ago,
and</B>
<P><B>since then my parents have sold that home.  In my own home (which was
built</B>
<P><B>in the twenties) I've heard strange noises as has my husband, but
nothing</B>
<P><B>really frightening - just floorboards creaking and once a loud bang
with no</B>
<P><B>identifiable source, but I do feel that I am sensitive to such things
as a</B>
<P><B>result of the occurances at my parent's home in New Hope.</B>
