<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Ghost Experiences</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: hebthegr8@aol.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I moved from <st1:State w:st="on">Illinois</st1:State> to <st1:State w:st="on">Wyoming</st1:State> for my own personal reasons, lived in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Wyoming</st1:place></st1:State> for about a year
without any problems until my fiancee at the time and I had a falling out. I
moved in with my current boyfriend in a different house/apartment, and things
became incredibly weird almost immediately.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Within the first week of living in our new apartment, we
were sitting in the kitchen talking, when his phone rang. He answered the phone
and looked up at the cabinets, I looked over at the empty Pabst beer can we
were using as an ashtray and saw it drift about six inches towards the edge of
the table. I forced my boyfriend to get up and sat where he had been sitting,
trying every possible angle that he could have leaned on the table to make the
can move like that. It wouldn't move again any way that I leaned on that table,
so it couldn't have been either one of us.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>At first my boyfriend thought I was just being paranoid,
when he looked over at our cat Dustbunny. She had been laying in "her
chair" very calmly, half asleep, until I started freaking out. When he saw
that she was looking a couple of inches above his head, eyes rather large, he
felt something literally reach through his skin and grab his stomach. Whatever
it was didn't let go until he crossed the Wyoming/Colorado border.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Recently we've been inspecting the walls (the apartment
hasn't been fully renovated since at least the '70's) and have found some rather
disturbing things. For one, the bathroom door has chain locks not only on the
inside, but outside as well. The bedroom door in the very back of the apartment
locks on the outside only and has no doorknob; should that door be closed and
locked, anyone inside the bedroom has to wait for someone to come back and
unlock it.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The bathroom and bedroom are by far the scariest places in
here though. The bathroom door looks to have been kicked in by a very angry
person, and the wall leading back to the bedroom has human nail marks all over
it.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>More recently, which has definitely scared me, there has
been blood showing up without explanation all over the bedroom walls, in very
distinct patterns. The only theory my boyfriend and I can come up with, based
on my bouts of sleep paralysis and the unexplainable damage to the walls, is a
possible rape and murder long before we moved in here.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Luckily, we're moving to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State> at the end of this week.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Old House</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: GoJeffie24@aol.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was growing up we lived in a house in Laureldale
(suburb of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Reading</st1:place></st1:City>).
We had a door at the bottom of the stairs and our family would be in the living
room and the door would open. My dad always said we didn't close it properly.
So we would go slam the door shut and here the latch click in place and later
as we were all in the living room watching TV the door would come open again.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One night as we came home the door to the enclosed front
porch was open and again my dad said one of us didn't close it all the way.
When we walked in, the inner door to the living room was also open. When we
walked in the kitchen every cabinet door in the kitchen stood open.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My dad had his "den" in the room behind the stairs
and he had put a drop ceiling in it. We were not allowed in this room unless
given permission, but on numerous occasions my dad or mom would walk in the
room and one of the ceiling tiles was moved.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Later we moved out of the house and sold it to my mom's
sister and her family. One night my aunt was downstairs and my uncle yelled
down to her from upstairs "When are you coming to bed". She said soon
but it was almost an hour later before she went upstairs. As she turned the
corner to walk down the short hall to the master bedroom, there was a figure of
a man standing just beyond the doorway. She said "I'm coming, I'm
coming" but when she got in bed, there was my uncle sound asleep.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My husband's family knows of the bones coming up through the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His step-brother in law was practicing
football and tripped over what turned out to be a coffin that was
resurfacing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His father was also present
when a femur bone was excavated and determined to be a human bone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of his cousins who attended this high
school went to the 4th floor with some of their friends and reported actually
being able to hear what sounded like people banging on the door as if trying to
escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a fire that killed
everyone on the 4th floor which is why it is blocked off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one knows how the fire got started and
(according to local legand) the nearest 3 fire stations that could have been
there and probably saved the lives of some of the people on that floor, could
not get their station doors to open for the trucks to get out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A station about 5 miles away had to respond
and by the time they got there, it was too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I also have experienced "Stella" at Six Flags in
the theatre during one of the shows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was rather comfortable in the tent, although we expected it to be very
hot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Myself and the person I was with
suddenly felt a cold draft and then it stayed directly behind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We kept hearing someone talking in that area,
but the theatre was practically empty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We finally got up and left.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Shadow Man</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: speedy9747@aol.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Roughly four years ago, I moved to another county in a very
rural area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each day, I drive just under
50 miles each direction to get to work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the mornings, along a long section of highway, there are no houses,
lights and at 5:30 am, very little if any traffic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The other morning, I had awakened quite early and had left
to start my commute approximately fifteen minutes earlier than was my customary
time. I noticed immediately how abnormally bright the countryside was thanks,
in part, to the full moon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only
after the cloud cover lifted and the entirety of the moon's brightness
illuminated the road ahead that I saw something that didn't fit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't exactly certain what it was but I
knew that it didn't belong. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Bear in mind that on one side of this section of highway
lays a 100+ acre tomato field and on the other side there is a 100+ acre
pasture for dairy cattle. Both of which were quite empty and quite visible at
this time of morning under the full moon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I fixed my gaze on the dark object that did not belong as I approached
at around 60 MPH.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am unable to provide specifics beyond it was very dark,
very distinct and had the form of an averaged sized human male. It politely
stayed on the highway's shoulder until I passed and then through the rear view
mirror, I watched it stride across the highway before disappearing in to the
tomato field.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I said nothing about this to anyone that day, but on the
following morning's commute, I drove with anxious anticipation through that section
of highway with nothing remarkable. I rationalized that my prior experience was
nothing more than tired, morning eyes being tricked by the remarkable
brightness of the moon and the many unusual shadows it had created.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is, until a friend had called me during
my lunch hour concerned about her husband. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>According to her husband, he was driving down the same
stretch of highway at roughly the same time I had been when I first noticed the
shadow man the morning after my experience, when he saw (thanks in part to the
still abnormally bright glow from the almost full moon and limited cloud cover)
what I vaguely described earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
friend was concerned that her husband was overly stressed due to the new
financial strain of her recent unemployment. I assured her that her spouse,
though he may be overly stressed, was not hallucinating as I too, had seen this
shadow man just the day before. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have driven that route for the past four years with no
remarkable experiences, but in light of the recent events (no pun intended); I
will be more observant and expectant during my morning commute. I will keep you
posted if anything additional occurs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The <st1:place w:st="on">Alcatraz</st1:place> Ghost</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: gruenwhite@mesanetworks.net</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Although everything in this story sounds impossible its 100%
true!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>About five years ago, my family and I went to San Fransico.
My parents had lined up so many ideas. But the one idea that caught my
brother's interest was going to see an old abandened prison called <st1:place w:st="on">Alcatraz</st1:place>. Myself however as a 6-7 year old was the
oppiset. I was still scared of the dark and going to an old dusty dark
abandened prison wouldn't help anything! Since my brother really wanted to go,
my parents made me come! </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After sailing for what seemed 2-3 hours we came to a small
island with a large building on it. My parents told me the large builing was <st1:place w:st="on">Alcatraz</st1:place>. The name just gave me spine tingling chills.
Once I stepped inside I felt a strong presence coming from practically every
jail cell. I felt like a million eyes wer watching me walk. I had told my
parents several times I wanted to go. My parents though never answered, they
were concentrating on the tour. But I could tell I wasn't the only scared one,
my brother and many others who were in the tour had seemed pale. They shivered
when ever they passed a cell and didn't comment. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When we reached outside our tour guy told us to roam around
freely. My brother went up these outside steps to see what was in a window.
When he came down he was as pale as snow! We asked what was wronge. My brother
told us that inside the window was a man, that had a nose like a bird, and that
he was chipping his way out of one of the cells! Right away we knew it was
true. So my father and I decided to look for our selves. When we got up there
no body was there. But I had the same feeling of a presence over me that I had
earlier, and when I was about to leave I saw something out of the corner of my
eye. It was a man, that fit my brothers decreption, but he was dead! His body
was bloody and he had rot all over him!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>4 years later- I researched the history of <st1:place w:st="on">Alcatraz</st1:place>,
and found out that many men were killed in their escape, 2 drowned. The man I
saw had been shot in the back! I now believe my family is phycic because of the
fact that my dad, brother, and myself saw a ghost or spirit before!</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Concrete Ghost Story</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: jayandmelanie@sbcglobal.net</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have several ghost stories, but the one that I feel most
concrete on happened when I was about 7 or 8 years old. My parents, twin
sisters and I lived in a house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Tecumseh</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Oklahoma</st1:State></st1:place>. The house was only 10
or so years old when we moved in and, as far as I know, wasn't built on top of
an old burial ground or anything which perplexes me even more as to why I was
visited one night by an apparition.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One night, I was laying in bed. It was probably about 10:00
p.m. as Mom was still up watching T.V., but we kids were in bed sleeping. The
bedrooms and one bathroom were situated on one end of the house in a lower-case
'y' shape. Mom and Dad's room was on the bottom of the 'y' the bathroom branched
of from the middle. My sisters shared a room on the opposite end of my parents'
room and my room was at the end of the bend of the 'y.'</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Dad worked nights and Mom stayed in the den most nights so
she left the light on in the bathroom so we kids could find our way if we
needed to. I could just see the light on the wall from my bedroom since my room
bent off of the main hallway. I awoke to my heart pounding and the hair on the
back of my neck standing up. At about that time, my sisters screamed and I saw
the shadow of a little girl running down the hallway. I jumped out of bed and
ran into the den with my sisters to tell Mom.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I asked the girls what they saw because I knew what I had
seen and didn't want to taint their story. They said that they saw a little
girl in a night gown or dress walking up the hallway from my parents' room.
When the little girl turned to start walking into my room, they screamed and
she ran back down the hallway and disappeared.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The description they gave was that the little girl had wispy
hair and big eyes, but from the nose down her face was vague in detail almost
blurry. She wore a gown of some sort that was opaque and blurry like her face.
This described the shadow I saw to the last detail. Also, when the girl's
shadow ran past the light on the wall, she seemed to be smiling almost as if it
all were a game.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I never saw the little girl again, but from that night on, I
constantly heard footsteps in the house sometimes accompanied by heavy
breathing. I also thought I saw something peeking out of my closet at me,
hiding behind the clothes. I couldn't go to sleep at night unless the closet
door were closed before I lay down and some mornings it was open when I woke
up.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Once, I was running through the kitchen and the dishwasher
door swung open and tripped me. I know that Mom always latched it to make sure
something like that didn't happen and I feel like it was maliciously purposeful
that it opened just as I was running up on it.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This continued for the next several years until I verbally
confronted the footsteps and then nothing ever happened again. I don't know why
the spirit or spirits decided to stop harassing me, but I never experienced
anything else; at least not in that house, but that's for another time.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It wasn't long ago that I travelled to the U.K, a typical
tourist wanting to see anything and everything. It was this trip that changed
my life completely. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My brother (Ethan) and I were visiting Hampton Court Palace,
it must have been late evening at least and there were still a few other
tourists milling around the gardens, there were also a few "guards"
standing alert making sure that no one went to far as to touch anything. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ethan and I began heading towards staircase that would take us
to the second story. As we walked past one of the corridors, the door at the
opened. We thought nothing of it to start with, until it opened and revealed
that no one was there.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ethan was 4 years younger then me and was only 16 so he,
being a boy wanted to investigate. We walked into the room, expecting to see a
couple of people looking around or even kids playing hide and seek, instead
there was nothing so we decided that it must have been the wind. After all it
was a cold breezey day.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>From this room you could over look the maze, a couple of
kids were running around playing with there parents who were trying to get
family photos, upon looking i noticed something move in the mirror beside me, i
turned around, Ethan was already out of the room, un-interested in the history
side of things. I turned to look back out of the window but the curtains had
been drawn. Confused i went to leave the room, until the door creaked and
almost closed. I froze, (being a crybaby ha!) I just couldn't move. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When i came to my senses at what i was doing i just laughed
it off. I walked back out into the corridor, Ethan was talking to one of the
guards a few metres ahead so i wanted to look at some paintings. I went into
the next room, it was like a parlour almost with fabulous artwork and a
beautfully engraved fireplace. As i looked at the paintings i felt something
tug on my sleeve, i turned but nothing was there, i brushed off the feeling and
went back to the painting. Again something tugged on my shirt, this time i
turned to see a woman in the parlour with me, but she was sitting down. She
seemed dressed up so i thought she might have been performing a play about th
history of the Palace.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I slowly moved to stand infront of her, to look at another
painting, the door was also diagonally infront of me so i know this sounds
weird but when i turned around she was gone. I pulled my jacket close around me
and left the room to meet with my brother.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Soon after this we returned to our grandparents house, had
dinner and a shower then went to bed. My bedroom was next to my brothers room
but our grand-parents room was downstairs.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It would have been about midnight when I heard my brother
get out of bed, i was still awake reading. He tip-toed out into the upstairs
bathroom, i know because he left the light on when he came out. About half an
hour later I put my book down and rolled over to turn the light off.As i did I
saw someone standing in my doorway.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Thinking it was my grandmother i asked if everything was
okay. There was no answer just a low humming noise that seemed to be coming
from the figure. I asked again incase she didn't hear me right but still there
was no reply. I then heard what i thought was crying and the figure moved its
hands to its face. I went to pull the covers off of my bed to go and see what
was wrong, i still thought it was my grandmother.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>But as i sat up the figure backed away, still crying, i knew
it was looking at me, straight into my eyes. I felt a cold chill go down my
spine at this stage and as i spoke again the figure vanished and the humming
noise stopped. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Over my entire holiday i encountered the same figure at
lease six times. Each in different situations. The scariest<span style="">&nbsp; </span>however was when i was in the shower.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It was late at night because i had gone out to the pub with a
couple of my cousins and her friends so it was around 2 a.m.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was just standing in the shower washing my legs when a
shadow difted past the curtain.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I quickly pulled back the curtain but nothing and no one was
there.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I got out of the shower about 5 minutes later and dried
myself off, when i picked up my brush i noticed something really strange. The
hair on it was a dark auburn colour, but my hair is blonde. No one else in the
house has dark red hair either so it made no sense.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>As i began to brush my hair i cleared the condensation from
the mirror, as i did so i looked up, in the reflection a saw the same woman i
had seen in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Hampton</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Court</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Palace</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.
Scared out of my wits i grasped hold of the sink and stard at this lady. Her
hair was long and it was auburn, she looked angry in some way but the
expression she held was full of grief, i turned to look but she had gone. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This was the last time i ever saw her in the spirit, but
since flying back home to Australia i still get the feeling she is with me,
because<span style="">&nbsp; </span>sometimes when its late at
night, usually after midight i hear a soft humming<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and my hair brush always has auburn coloured
hair in it, even after i've already cleaned it.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The ghost of Rontignon</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Village</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Rontignon</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, southern
France, about three years ago.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After some years in an apartment, my father decided to buy a
house in a smart and peaceful area in a quiet suburb. He found a recent house,
no older than twenty years old, and bought it. He has been living there for
several months and everything appeared to be quiet and normal, until a night of
summer where strange things began to happen. This night, my father went to a
party at friends&#8217; with his new wife and he let at home my sister aged 16 and
brother aged 6. At about midnight or two a.m., my sister was awoken by noises
of steps at the end of the corridor. She thought my father was back, but she
wondered why the hall&#8217;s door didn&#8217;t make any noise as usual. As she opened her
bedroom door to see what was happening, she saw that the lights in the kitchen
were lit and heard someone walking in circle in it steadily. She called : &#8220;dad&#8221;
? And then, suddenly, the lights switched and the steps began to run in circle
in the living room in the complete dark. It lasted for minutes and stopped
suddenly. My sister was found in state of half shock few hours after when my
father went back. There were neither evidences of burglars nor anything. Few
days after, the whole family noticed that lights and TV worked by themselves
and heard doors slamming. My sister saw a sort of human shadow going from the
living room to the kitchen and heard regular knockings on her bedroom&#8217;s
shutters. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One day, my father&#8217;s wife&#8217;s grandmother came home to care
about my brother. While she was watching TV, she saw the lights in the hall
turning on and off in a steady way. As she hadn&#8217;t been told about those strange
events, not to frighten her, she thought it was a joke of my brother. But to
her surprise, my brother was deeply sleeping in his bed and the lights kept on
turning on/off by themselves. The door at the bottom of the corridor was
opening and slamming whereas there were nobody and all the windows were well
closed. As a devout catholic, she refused to listen her fear, stood before the
slamming door and screamed : &#8220;I am not afraid, I won&#8217;t move up from here !&#8221;.
Just she ended the phrase, the door slammed a last time, the lights kept lit up
and everything stopped. She became the new witness of those strange happenings.
</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After weeks of fright and lights mystery, the grandmother
went to the church to fetch some blessed water and watered all the walls of the
house with it. And since this moment, every happenings stopped, as suddenly as
they came.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A day, my father investigated in the city-hall and
discovered that the former owners were an unhappy couple. The old man died of a
cancer and his wife committed suicide&#8230; in my father&#8217;s bedroom. But it seems
that applying some blessed water on the walls made the ghost disappear. For
years after it, my family lived there happy and we definitely got rid of this
freaky presence.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>During the last week of October 2007 I had gotten word that
an old friend of mine who&#8217;d I had grown up with and worked with in high school
had very unexpectedly passed away. I was shocked by this and felt so guilty
that I had not kept in touch with him within the past year or two. I went back
and forth but finally decided that it would be best for me to go to his
funeral. I went and it was so hard for me, I didn&#8217;t know it was going to be
open-casket. Needless to say I took it pretty hard for awhile. About 2 or 3
weeks after the funeral I had the strangest dream, one of those dreams where
you swear it&#8217;s really happening until you wake up. It took place during the day
and it was beautiful and sunny, and I was walking cross the parking lot to my
school. All of a sudden I felt so emotional and started running towards this
person. I never saw their face but for some reason I knew it was my friend. I
hugged him and I remember him whispering &#8220;Everything&#8217;s ok. Everything will be
alright.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning when I woke
up I felt much better and started to reach a healthy level of grief. I think it
was his way of saying goodbye. A couple of weeks after that I was home by
myself and went downstairs and once I reached the foyer I could have sworn I
saw the light on at the top of the stairs (it was the middle of the day, no
lights were on in my house) and saw a shadow of a man standing there facing me.
It took me a second to realize what I had seen, so I turned around and looked
up the stairs but nothing was there. Somehow I knew it was him checking up on
me and even though it caught me off guard, I got the most comforting feeling
from seeing it. Later on that day I noticed that he had finally gotten his
headstone in the cemetery (I drive by it everyday, and had been checking
everyday to see if he had gotten it yet). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Since those two experiences I haven&#8217;t heard
anything from him, but I feel so much better that I had had them.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hello my name is <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">elizabeth</st1:City></st1:place>
and im 15 years old. i really never told anyone about my experience because im
not sure if it was real or a dream. ever since that night i became afraid of
dolls and today i don't like dolls at all. when i was 4 or 5 my uncle gave me
this doll she was really pretty and it had a green dress and blonde hair. it
wasn't plastic it was made out of like cloth and it was like 3 feet tall. i had
another doll that looked the same but it was orange with brown hair.i would
always put my dolls on this table and i would organize them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i really don't remember well but i remember i
would be alone in the living room playing tea with them and the little lamp was
turned on and that afternoon while i was playing with them, when i turned
around i heard one of them speak to me. i got so scared because i actually
heard her speak and i ran to my parents room and started crying. that night i
couldn't sleep so i just kept my eyes closed and when i opened them the green
doll was on top of me and i screamed when i turned around all my dolls were on
the floor and i ran to my parents room and started crying and they told me it
was only a dream and took me back to my bed and al my dolls were sitting on
their place. i got so scared that i couldn't sleep and i turned toward them and
just stared at them and the green doll's leg was moving and hitting the table i
started crying again and ran to my parents room and slept there. the next
morning my mother took all my dolls and put them in a plastic bag and put them
in the attic. everytime i would be alone in the living room watching TV i would
hear footsteps in the attic but i would ignore them and one day me and my dad
were watching TV we heard the footsteps he told me to go upstairs and check if
my uncle was up there and i went and nobody was there. i kind of got scared and
told my mom she threw the dolls away and after that i didn't hear footsteps.4
years later when it was my little sister's birthday she got the same doll and
after that i got scared that my mom had to take the doll away. Not really long
ago when i was reading a book my night lamp turned on and i turned it off and
it turned on again i got mad and decided to disconnect it but then i noticed
that it was already disconnected. i got freaked out and just decided to sleep
and forget about it. After that i woke up in the middle of the night because my
drawers were opening and closing i turned my night lamp on and as soon as i
turned it on all of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the drawers closed
really hard and nobody was there. the other night when my cousins were her we
were chilling in my room and the door was closed. we were talking and all of
sudden we heard someone slap my door really har and at first we thought it was
my mom or my dad but we opened the door and nobody was there. sometimes i have
a bad feeling that someone is watching me and i guess im ok as long as it
doesn't bother me. </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>If you check out the "Haunted Ohio"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>book series you will find my personal home's
story. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The house was built in 1816 and always rumored to be part of
the underground rail road. Elders in the area have many stories as do people
that I have grown up with that have experienced things in my house. I grew up
here and renovated it about 10 years ago. We have several ghosts, both inside
and outside. I have photos and evps to prove it. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The main ghost I believe is Sarah Dupler a female doctor
that would have lived here during the civil war. Her first husband died
December 26th 1863 leaving her with 4 children to raise. Her husband was buried
at our local cemetery with her family and she later was mistakenly buried on
the wrong plot. She walks the stairs and hallway as tho she is waiting for her
husband to come home. Her figure is white-ish and friendly. There is another
here, I beleive a man, a dark figure (maybe a slave) We see dark shadows moving
aound the porch, outside the windows etc as tho he is being protective. There
is also a female child, she likes to play hide and seek in the upstairs
closets, and play with my childrens toys. Electronics sometimes turn on or off
by themselves, things will be moved, doors will close and open, footsteps,
someone moving out of the corner of your eye, etc. It is fun to live here and
the farm is named "Hauntedhills Farm" . If you would like more
information you may contact me.</big></p>

Haunted cottage</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: MW69Email@aol.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I thought you would like to know about a couple of things
that happened to myself and my brother when we bought a 17th century cottage in
2001.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We were lucky enough to buy a detached stone cottage in the
middle of the <st1:place w:st="on">West Sussex</st1:place> countryside , which
had been a farm workers cottage for the Leconfield estate for hundreds of
years.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It was a in need of a lot of work,with no close neighbours
and surrounded by fields, myself and my twin brother bought it and went over
and collected the keys from the estate agents on the day of completion. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We took a friend over to have a look around and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>went upstairs, when you get to the top of the
stairs you can look down a central hallway which goes right down the middle of
the house, on your left is a single bedroom and on the right is a double
bedroom, you walk down the hall and have another bedroom on your left and
another on your right,and then at the end is a bathroom, all three of us went
into the bathroom and stood there talking , my brother turned around and looked
down the hall, and watched a black cat come out of the single bedroom, run down
the hall towards him,and run into the bedroom on the right,just before you come
into the bathroom. He said " A black cat just ran down the hall into that bedroom!"
. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We all<span style="">&nbsp; </span>went straight
into the bedroom,which was totally empty of furniture with no other exit and no
black cat!.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A couple of months later we needed to start renovating the
cottage and had to get an architect to draw us up some plans, I asked him to come
around at 8 am<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so we wouldn't be late
for work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Myself and my brother were downstairs in the front
room,which has a big window looking across the road in front of the house,and
across fields. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It had gone past 8 am and we thought the architect must be
lost as it was hard to find,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we just
caught something out of the corner of our eyes as we were talking in the front
room, looked towards the window and both watched a man walk<span style="">&nbsp; </span>past the window,wearing a long brown coat and
a large brimmed hat, we thought it was the architect,but couldn't understand
why he was walking in front of the house when front door was at the other end
of the house were you park your car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We both looked out of the window and couldn't see him,
I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>opened<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the front door and there was nobody there, we both went outside,were you
can look in both directions for Half a mile across fields,and see anybody
walking or running, with nothing to hide behind , he had just vanished. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all happened in a matter of seconds and it
was totally impossible to walk past the window and vanish,even if he had jumped
in a car or on a motorbike and driven off, we would have seen him or heard him.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ten minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was
the architect, we asked him if he had walked past the front of the house, and
he said he had only just arrived in his car. Thinking back about what the man
was wearing, he was wearing similar clothes to what a country gent would have
worn during the winter in the late 18th century. Weird stuff !.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hope these stories are of some interest to you .</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: Anonymous</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>During the summer of 2007 my girlfriend and I took a trip
down to South Yarmouth in <st1:place w:st="on">Cape Cod</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were staying at a cottage that was located
on a grassy area next to the beach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cottage was simple, kind of set up like a studio apartment, bedroom and living
room together with a small kitchen area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were rabbit dolls and decorations all over the room which was the
theme for the cottage, personally I couldn't take it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was creepy enough that's what I had to
look at when I was trying to relax, but as my girlfriend went in the kitchen
area, I was sitting on the couch and noticed one of the dolls slightly shaking
back and forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figured maybe
something made it vibrate in the room so I didn't think twice about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went out for dinner and got a few drinks
and came back when it was dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
settling into bed and everything seemed normal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I woke up in the middle of the night from a feeling of
pressure on my chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sleeping on
my back and the weight felt like someone was pushing me down and keeping me
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened my eyes and the feeling
went away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't short of breath or
anything, but it clearly woke me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried to get back to sleep but I felt terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned on my side to my girlfriend, she was
in a deep sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some time passed as I
was trying to get back to sleep when she sits up still with her eyes shut and
says "look at that", then laid down again like nothing happened,
still asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I look into the room and
there's a man standing there with a gray aura around him staring at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the quick moment I saw him he didn't
move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked like he was in his 20's
and his appearance was out of the 18th century, if I saw it correctly he looked
like a soldier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the room was
dark but he was clear as day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I threw
the covers over my head and later fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Experience</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: mylady502003@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My husband passed away in 1989 in our home. I knew the
moment he passed. Emergency personnell had laid him out on the floor of my
living room before he passed. When he passed there was a dark colored liquid
that came out of his mouth onto my carpet. I cleaned the dark stain out of my
carpeting and let it dry. There was no stain there when I got done but the
stain was always back the next morning. But my experience came one night in the
late 1990's. My daughter and her family had finally moved into their own home.
And it was a moonless night. Outside of my bedroom window was a dusk to dawn
light. It was cold out but there was no storm. But the electric went out. And
as I looked out the window out over the valley all was dark. Too dark. For some
reason, possibly since I was living alone in this house and it was on a hill
and a little remote as my neighbors were at their main home in NY and the
batteries went dead in my flashlight, I got frightened. It was the perfect
night for someone to try to break in any home. It was that dark. I was lying in
my bed covered up<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with the blankets as
it was getting colder when all of a sudden I felt someone sit on the edge of my
bed. That scared me even more as I had not heard anyone break in the door or a
window. And I could not see anything due to it being so black.Then I felt
someone take hold of my hand as if to comfort me and the pillows on the
opposite side of the bed moved. Even tho I felt comforted I pulled the covers
over my head and tried to get some sleep. All of a sudden the electric came
back on and I had to get up to turn off what had been on when the electric went
out. As I looked at the side of the bed that I had not occupied I noticed there
was and indent in the mattress as if someone had been laying there and the
pillows were all askew. That was my husband's side of the bed when he was alive.
I always felt that he had come to me in my time of need and provided comfort. I
have often had eerie feelings at different times but this was the one time I
remember so vividly.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Experiences with Ghosts</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: calisurfer_chic_14@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi, my name is Nicole and I live in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CA. I am only 17, but I've had quite a few
experiences. One of my closest friends, Marlee, is able to see and communicate
with ghosts, and she informed me that both of my grandparents' houses are
haunted, and also that I have a spirit that is attached to me. Anyway, on with
the ghostly encounters. Most of the experiences happened at my dad's parents'
house. Over the summer my mom had surgery and they offered to let me stay there
until she was back at home and able to do stuff again so that i would be able
to walk to work. I ended up staying there for about three and a half weeks.
After the first night i started getting funny feelings, especially when i has
near the hallway, and i got migraines more often than i normally do, but it wasn't
until about a week later that stuff actually started happening. One night i was
sitting on the couch watching TV with my grandma when I started hearing tapping
noises coming from behind me, but the only thing there was the front door and a
china hutch. They don't have mice or anything like that and I was absolutely
positive that my grandpa was sleeping in his room. After a couple seconds it
stopped, but then came back. I made sure to listen to it to see where it was
coming from, and it was actually coming from the door! I quietly said,
"Stop it." and it stopped. The next time something happened was a
couple days later. I had just gotten home from work, no one else was there so I
decided to take a shower. I turned on the shower and the battery powered radio
they keep in the bathroom. i got into the shower and was rocking out to the
song that was on the radio when it started going all staticky. I just decided
to tune it out and wait for the station to come back it, but that never
happened, by the time i got out, the radio was on a completely different
station. I just ignored it and went to my room to get dressed. Since nobody was
home yet I left my door open while i was getting dressed. i had my back toward
the hallway and was brushing my hair when i heard heavy footsteps coming down
the hall towards me (this didn't scare me because they sounded just like my
grandpa's footsteps, I just thought that he had come into the house without me
noticing) so I turned around to see nothing but an empty hallway. About a week
and a half after that, my grandparents informed me that they were going to go
to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Las Vegas</st1:place></st1:City>
for five days and that I would have the house to myself. They also said that I
was welcome to have friends over and have one of them stay the night, or i could
stay over at someone else's house as long as I got myself to work. The first
couple of days I decided to stay with friends, but on the fourth day they were
gone I decided just to stay there by myself. I had been out all day and decided
to watch TV for a while before I went to bed. After watching TV for about 20
minutes I decided to get my PJs on then watch some more TV. As soon as I got up
to walk down the hall, i heard the dog (who was outside) start whimpering
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>barking. i got about three feet down
the hallway when he suddenly stopped. I looked back down the hallway and
decided that he was being stupid, so I turned and started toward my room again
but as soon as I took one step there was an extremely loud bang on the wall
right next to my head. Needless to say, it scared the crap out of me and I took
off down the hall to my room. I put on my PJs and ran back into the living room
and called my dad. He was upset that I had called him so late and told my good
night and hung up. I watched a little more TV then went to sleep. The next day
was the day my grandparents were supposed to come home. I went with my friend
Krystal to get her senior portraits taken, and afterwards invited her, my
friends Phoenix, Javier, and Nolan over and offered to make them dinner. After
I started cooking Krystal and Nolan went to the store, and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:place></st1:City> and Javier decided to stay and help
me cook. I was making Spanish rice and refried beans, and i asked them to get
me another can of beans because I couldn't reach it. they both went to the
cupboard to get it. After a few minutes I still hadn't gotten the beans and
asked them where it was. They said that they had put it right next to me on the
counter. I told them it wasn't there and they swore up and down that they had
put it there. I just told them to get me another can, they did and I finished
cooking. A few minutes later Krystal and Nolan returned and a few more friends,
including Marlee showed up. We all ate outside and were having a good time when
Krystal and I decided to go inside to get something to drink. When I walked
through the door the first thing I saw was the can of beans that had gone
missing about two hours earlier! It couldn't have been anyone who was there
because not only were they all outside the entire time, but we never told any
of them about what happened. A little while later my grandparents came home and
said that they were going to bed, but my friends were welcome to stay as long
as they wanted. So at about 1 am there were only Nolan, Phoenix, Krystal, Marlee,
and myself left, and we were sitting in the living room talking, but we had all
of the light off because my grandparents were asleep. All of a sudden, at the
exact same time <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:place></st1:City>
and I looked down the hall and saw a black shape almost crawling towards us. We
looked at each other in confusion and shock and at that moment I felt so sick,
more sick than I have ever felt in my entire life. My muscles were burning, my
stomach was turning, I instantly got a migraine, and I felt dizzy, light-headed
and weak all at the same time. The two of us both ran outside because we
couldn't be in there anymore. Marlee and Krystal followed us out to make sure
that we were okay. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:place></st1:City>
and Nolan decided they wanted to go home, so Krystal offered to take them.
After they left I asked Marlee to stay the night with me. She agreed, so we
turned to go back inside. I was very hesitant to go back in and just kind of
stood in the driveway. She told me that the only reason I had gotten so sick
was that the ghost had passed directly through me. She assured me that it was
not trying to hurt or scare me, that it simply wanted to be recognized. After
that not much happened the remainder of the time I was there. Of course there
was the occasional unexplainable noise, just as a reminder, but nothing big.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Sorry this was so long, but I just needed to get it off my
chest and this seemed like the perfect place to do it. I love the website! Keep

me do things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like i was coloring a
rainbow one day and i was wondering what color should go first and i didnt say
this out loud but a voice that was beside me said put red first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but heres what i dont understand, when that
happened i was not sitting there looking at the picture i was floating up near
the ceiling and i was looking down at myself but just for that minute. And
until this day it still does that. for split seconds its like im taking up to
anothers view and i feel diffrent like emotional wise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was hoping that someone<span style="">&nbsp; </span>here could help me understand whats going on.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>As a grandchild of a rancher from Red Rock AZ, I was often
told about the man on the horse on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Picacho</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Peak</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was told to me, there was a wagon full
of gold that tumbled down the side of the peak that was never found by the man
on the horse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This image was seen by my
great-grandfather and told to the family for many years.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Just thought I would mention this since it is a story passed
down to me from my grandfather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The Aguirre family has been in the Red Rock area for over
115 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1992 my grandmother Rose
Aguirre died in the family home in Red Rock.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My husband and I, who are hard pressed to believe in ghosts, had two
separate incidents after the death of my grandmother Rose and my grandfather,
Enrique.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My husband and I and our three children lived in the family
home in Red Rock from 1998 to 2001.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
cold February night, I was awoken by one of my dogs, whose was whining like she
wanted to go outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After getting out
of bed to let her out, she chose not to go outside, but continued to whine and
pace the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I returned to bed
I was awoken a short time later by a light on in the hallway from the main part
of the house to our bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This light
is a bulb with a chain on it about six feet from the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other than my husband and I who were
sleeping, the only other person in the house was our three year old son, who
obviously was not tall enough to switch on the bulb. Who turned on the
light?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why was my dog whining?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, on several occasions I heard someone
walking the wood floors only to get out of bed and check that the kids were
sound asleep and a coldness feeling where the sound was coming from.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On another occasion my husband was awoken in the middle of
the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he arose, he saw thru
the curtains, toward the corrals, a man on a horse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a man on the horse with conchos on
the saddle like a saddle that belonged to my Tio Higinio (Gene) Aguirre who is
still very much alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the curtain
was drawn back the image disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
believe the horseman was my grandfather, Enrique Aguirre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was so convinced that this
happened, he checked for horse hoof marks the next morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were none.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Many times we would come into the home and find kitchen
cabinet doors open like my grandmother had been in the kitchen cooking while we
were gone.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am hard pressed to believe in ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe once you are gone, you are
gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the chills that ran up and
down my spine during these incidents was real.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Just thought I would pass on my experiences since I am from
an old cattle ranching family still in the Red Rock area.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi, my name is Keely, and I've sent a story before a few
years ago. Since I was little and confronted with ghosts I had no idea what to
do or why they were there. Now I know why they come to me so often. Most of the
time its because they need some one to help them, and hear them, and since I'm
what's I guess you could term 'sensitive' or 'psychic' they get attracted to me
(and others like me) because we're the only ones who can really help them or
actually hear/see them.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My most recent encounter happened while I was staying at a
Hostel in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Ireland</st1:country-region>, in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">county</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Killarney</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. The hostel used to be a HUGE
mansion owned by a British Lord. Eventually it was given back to the Irish and
they in turn, converted it into a hostel. There were, from what I could tell,
three ghosts. One was by the stairs, and while it wasn't bad, it did make me
uneasy enough that I couldn't walk alone down or up the stairs; much to the
amusment of the people working at the hostel who I got to walk with me at
night. Another ghost was, I believe, one of the owners of the mansion. He would
often check in on the rooms that had been converted into the lounges/play rooms
to make sure every one was having a good time, and the air he gave off was
"I own this". I always found it funny when some one would say at
precisely the time he arrived (leaning<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>in the door way smoking a pipe with a smile) "Is some one smoking
inside? Isn't that against the rules?". </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>But unfortunately, there was one ghost who was not good. In
fact, there has never been a time a ghost has ever really scared me, because I
can always tell before I see them if the energy is good or bad and act
accordingly. But this ghost caught me by complete surprise. I was talking to
one of the employees in the lounge (who I'll call bob), and the entire room is
covered in long windows (it was once the library). It was night time, around
twelve or one, and we were just talking about nothing important really, when I
saw her. She was outside the window, right behind the guy I was talking to. I
tried to ignore her at first, but I couldn't really, because she was standing
there, looking. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>She had a black dress one, with pale skin and dark hair
pulled back neatly in the center. She had a white cap on think, but she was, or
had been, a maid, I'm almost positive. She seemed placid, calm looking because
she stood so neatly, hands folded in front of her. And then I looked in her
eyes. Her eyes were dark, and when I looked at them a feeling of such fear, and
hate, and anger washed over me. She was tormented inside, completely focused on
her emotions. I had gone silent, and apparently pale, because Bob sat up and
asked what was wrong, did I feel ill? </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I shook my head and said I was fine, it was nothing. And
decided to ignore her. And then she spoke to me. She said "Let me
in." Over and over, and she asked me nicely, completely contrary to the
look in her eyes. I answered her in my mind "I can't." Then she started
asking more firmly, and I realized that I had to come up with an excuse. I told
her that I wasn't the owner of the house, it wasn't my place to let her in. But
she wouldn't let up, and turned pleading instead. I knew with all my heart that
I couldn't let her in, because if I did, I was the first person she would
attack before going on to do something really really bad.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Finally, not able to take it any more I asked Bob to close
all the blinds. He laughed then saw I was serious. He said he would, but only
if I told him what had me acting so weird. Once the blinds were closed I told
him what I saw, and outside, I could feel the spirit going from window to
window, trying to see me again. Bob took it all well, and said that he'd met
other people who could see or sense things too. The ghost tried to contact me
one other time in another wing, and tried to seem nice and humble, but I knew
better and simply left the room. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I don't know WHY she was so angry and full of hate, and one
day I hope to go back to the Hostel and find out. She's not allowed inside the
house, I know that much, but I don't know why.One things for sure though, when
I DO meet her again, I'm going to be inside, where she can't come in.</big></p>
