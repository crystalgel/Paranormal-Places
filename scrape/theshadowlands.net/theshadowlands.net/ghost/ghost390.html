<p class="MsoNormal">Dog Ghost</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Anonymous</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We seem to have a dog ghost in our house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the first incident occurred, I was
upstairs in the bathroom standing at the mirror with the door open (you can see
down a stairway to the front door from the bathroom).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was alone in the house at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I was there, I felt what I thought was
our dog's nose poke me in the back of the leg.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a very common dog thing for attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without looking, I reached around to pet our
dog, but there was nothing there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surprised, I c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed our dog's
name and saw him poke his head around the corner at the bottom of the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously it could not have been
him.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second incident occurred when my husband and I were both
in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, I was in the
upstairs bathroom (it's enough to give you a complex), this time with the door
closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doorknob rattled, just as if
our dog was asking for entry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(It's his
way of knocking; he rattles the doorknob.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I opened the door, and no dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked my husband if our dog was downstairs with him and he said
"Yes".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him if he had
heard the doorknob rattle upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
replied that he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were both very
perplexed as it did sound exactly as if our dog had "knocked" on the
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him about the phantom
nose-poking incident and given his witnessing the doorknob rattle, he believed
me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The third incident occurred to my stepson and not me,
thankfully.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> settling down in our respective rooms upstairs
when we heard his door open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A moment
later, he came into our room, a little flustered and asking if we'd heard his
door open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had, and we assumed it was
just a change in air pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he
said that what was strange about it was that when the door opened, it made a
sound as if a dog was pushing on the doorknob (again, a familiar sound we
experience regularly with our current dog), which does not usu<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y occur when the door blows open from air
pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd say that he believed my
previous stories at this point!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've only been living in this house a couple of years since
my husband and I met and married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never knew my husband's previous dog, as he passed away before I moved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My theory is that he is curious about my
presence in the house, since it has been some time since a woman lived
here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I think I hear a collar
jingle when our dog is away with the guys but I think that is purely
imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of these incidents has
been frightening, just curious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
house was built by a pastor and has a very comforting, positive
"vibe" about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed
this the first time I came here - how welcome and warm it felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I immediately felt like it was
"home".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe it has
positive spiritual energy because people of faith built it with love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We love our home and pray for its blessing
and protection.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Currently my two young-adult children I live in an apartment
in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:place></st1:State>
which has a very dominant male spirit present. Not sure if he is a good or
negative spirit. We <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> have had
multiple sightings of this person and some physical encounters with him as
well. We moved here October of 05 and my first week here I noticed a nice-sized
orb go from the front bedroom to the side bedroom. Afterwards lots of activity
and feelings started happening with us. I have not re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
unpacked yet for settling in because plan on moving this coming October. I have
matresses in the middle of my livingroom which is where I sleep with my
daughter. One evening I was laying on my matresses with my eyes closed trying
to f<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> asleep. The presence was
strong as usual, but this particular nite I was too relaxed to respond.
Suddenly I felt a hard impact in the top of my head - like somebody took the
side of their fist and punched me - but I didn't have a headache or any
lingering pain. Conversely, one nite my daughter said that she was having a bad
dream one nite and could not wake up. She said suddenly she felt taps on her
forehead which made her wake up from the bad dream. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">one day i was at my grandmas house (in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">england</st1:country-region></st1:place>) and was looking out of the
window when i noticed a man walking up and down the drive. He was dressed in
victorian clothes, had dark hair and a moustache, i also noticed that he was a
bit transparent. I told my grandma and described him too her. Her face went
pale and she brought a photo down from the attic. She asked me if it was him
and it was, i told her this and she told me that it was her father and i
shouldnt be scared of him because he was probably coming to check on me (it was
my 12 birthday) i have always felt protected in my grandmas house and now i
know why. My grandma says that he died in the spare bedroom at the back of the
house which is where i now see him frequently. He never talks to me, just smiles.
I told my mum but no one else (my grandma already knew). i am still 12 but am
nearly 13 and have no doubts as to what i saw. I have been looking at this
sight for a while but i never thought i would have a story to tell! <span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">hi,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was recently
reading the stories on your page, i have long been fascinated by the
paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i dont know exactly how to
put this down so i will just write things out as i remeber them..</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my grandfather passed away not 2 months ago, it seems like
forver but I remember feeling uneasy <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
week (we live about 1500 miles apart) and something kept nagging at me to c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> him to see how he was doing (my mother, his
daughter, later said that she experienced these feelings, before i told her that
i also experienced them).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>well sure
enough on sat afternoon i get the c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
saying that he had passed away that morning at exactly 4am.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after making the arrangements i flew out to
gather what belongings he had, which wasnt much, just a few books and videos;
and his favorite watch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>here is what
bothers me about things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His watch
stopped at 420am the day he passed away, 2. he had a bible that he often read,
and he used to make notes on a little cue card about his favorite passages, the
cue card was slipped into the bible in the book of st. Matthew, in the chapter
outlining the easter story, it was easter saturday that he passed away on. 3.
on the day of his passing i awoke at 4am and could not sleep, the odd thing is
1500 miles away, my aunt and her children experienced the same thing, and when
my uncle drove from the hospital to my aunts house (my aunt and uncle are
seperated so they did not live togther, and my uncle was the primary caretaker
for my grandfather)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they were <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> awake and explained to him that they had woken
around 4 and could not get to sleep, that is when he broke the news to them.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">ever since i have felt like he is around me and whenever i
think if him i can feel a warmth inside me that i never experienced
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he always believed that there
was a connection between the afterlife and this world (as any world war soldier
will, he fought in the war and was a decorated soldier) and i love him so much,
he was more of a father to me than my own; and i just hope that he is happy and
safe.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i dont not know if u will post this, but it helped me a
little to write things out, thank you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My mother died in 1994 . 2 weeks after she had passed, my
sister and I went to the cemetery to take her some flowers.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was a hot day in July, and we decided that we would just
drop off the flowers and leave because of the heat.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When we were standing at the gravesight, my sister said
"lets go, i cant stand this heat". Out of nowhere a cool breeze came
over us. It was so refreshing...It blew over us for about a minute or so, and
then it stopped. But it gave us an instant boost of energy, and we decided to
stay longer visiting the gravesight of our mom. It was something we have never
forgotten, and firmly believe it came from our mother who didnt want us to
leave, and to visit longer with her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On such a hot day, it was a miracle having this cool air hit
us and cool us off from that heat. Thank you mom, wherever you are.......</p>

door crying her eyes out after my mum had calmed her down she said that she was
just about to cross the road when a man in a flat cap and a scarf told her to
stop not 3 seconds after she had stepped back onto the pavement did a car speed
round the blind corner my sister turned round to thank the old man who saved
her however he was gone but in the 10 seconds these events happened the man who
would have been maybe 70 couldnt have ran into a place she couldnt see him
because the only place he could have was a back <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ey
20 meters away.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">she asked my mum why it could have been an old man my mum
replied that the place her sighting happened was a social place were some old
men including my great grandad used to smoke and have a chat to this day my
sister keeps to her story and is definate that it was my great grandad making
sure that she was ok.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghost Named Joe</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: dyrdahl@gvtel.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We live in a sm<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
house in a sm<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> town in northern <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State> c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed Lengby. My girlfriend Lynda bought the house
in 1984 from her sister-in law who had owned the house for a few years (she
owns many rental houses in the area). A few months prior to Lynda purchasing
the house, an old man lived there. He was known in the community as the town
drunk. The kitchen floor of the house was actu<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
filled with empty whiskey bottles and beer cans. He actu<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
lived in the house rent free because he had been found living in an ice fishing
house during the previous winter.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I moved in with Lynda in 2004, she had added on three
bedrooms and a living room and she had explained to me that any strange noises
in the house could be contributed to her ghost whom she c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed
Joe. Apparently, Joe (the old man) was living in the tiny house during the
winter of 1983 and had staggered home from the local bar. Something had
happened to the oil burning furnace during the night, causing black soot to
fill the house. Joe was found dead just inside the front door with soot
covering his nose and mouth. As a local deputy, I took it upon myself to do
some research and found out that a friend of mine who was currently working as
a police officer in a neighboring town had been the officer who found Joe dead.
He described the situation to me as follows. I was c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed
to do a welfare check on Joe because nobody had seen him for a few days. I went
to the door and knocked, but did not get an answer. I tried the knob and found
the door to be unlocked. I tried to push the door open and realized it was
being blocked by something. Pushing hard, I managed to open the door enough to
find Joe dead lying just inside the door and frozen stiff. The winters are very
harsh here and it seems that when the furnace went on the blink and filled the
house with smoke and soot, Joe tried to get to the door, but was overcome and
died. The faulty furnace went out and <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>owed
the temprature to drop to sub-zero.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On numerous occasions, noises can be heard throughout the
house. Lynda's son and daughter have asked if she had been messing with their
stereos, because they both reported their music had been turned down during the
night. We like to recycle our aluminum cans and were keeping them in a garbage
can in the kitchen. One morning, Brady asked us why we were rummaging through
the cans the night before. We explained to him that we had been sleeping
through the night and had not touched the cans. Brady went on to explain that
during the night, he was awaken by the sound of cans rattling and it sounded
like they had been dumped on the floor. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have myself heard cans being moved around in the middle of
the night and got up to find them in their place.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night, while sitting in my recliner in the livingroom,
just outside what was once the original front door watching TV with Lynda, I
clearly heard what sounded like someone f<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ing
on a cement floor just behind my chair. I looked at Lynda and asked if she had
heard the same thing. We had both heard the sound and had looked at the floor
in front of the door and found nothing there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">i lived in a house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">lincoln
  park</st1:City></st1:place>, that was definitely haunted. i truely believe in
things like this and wow...what an experience! before we even moved in we knew
that there were others there besides us. we were fixing up the basement and
heard people talking in the vents. we heard dogs barking, and a baby crying and
saw a man standing in the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>way.
my fiance and i had the same expeience when in tot<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
different parts of the house. we both heard a man choking in the bathroom, and
then a man whistling.the lights would turn on and off <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
by themselves.....and you could watch the light switch go up and down. on 2
seperate occasions, a man breathed on the back of my neck while i was in the
shower(nobody else was home) and i saw his shadow on the other side of the
shower curtain. we met the people who lived there before us and we asked if
they ever had wierd things go on there and right away they described the exact
things that happened to us.after living there awhile, i heard that many many
years ago....some time in the 1800's, a family had a house there, and it burned
down. i believe this to be true because of the man we always heard choking in
the bathroom. there was also said to be a dog which we also heard barking at
times. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A far back as i can remember I've always felt (and been)
different to everybody else. When I was a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>little girl, around 4 or 5 I guess (I'm now 16), I had a lot of trouble
getting to sleep at night. I was plagued with constant nightmares and was
obsessed with death or what I knew of death at the time. I was always scared
and now i think back I seem to rec<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
why. I was afrad in my room, I'd go im there and go to bed and I'd get a
horrible feeling of dread. I'd turn the light on and read (I'm getting ahead of
myself a bit, I know, before then I would go out and sit with my parents) and
aftr a while I'd settle down enough to go try to go to sleep again. I have
always believed in ghosts somehow even tho I am terrified of what happens after
death. My first experience happened when I was around 7 I think (I have a
terrible memory even tho that isn't that long ago). I was laying in bed with my
head slightly raised looking through my bedroom door into the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>way where my parents left the light on for me at
night. I was just laying there thinking when I got this chlling sorta sinking
feeling that scares me everytime I get it and I heard a strange sound like a
washing machine start up. At first its whush, was quiet then it got louder and
louder and somehow more deep. This didn't go on for very long when a figure
appeared not like you blink and its there or materialises there it just sorta
appeared, suddenly it was there! It was a t<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
figure, almost as t<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> as my door
frame which is over 2 metres high (somewhere around 6 feet I think). The figure
was in a long black cloak that consealed its entire figure and the light that
was coming onto it from the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
seemed to have no effect on the material. The noise had stoped when the figure
had appeared and the figure dissapeared just like it had come, just suddenly
not being there. I closed my eyes having not blinked for several seconds and
being overwhelmed with, well, shock I guess because I wasn't realy scared of
it, and there when I closed my eyes I could see the figure just as perfectly as
when it had been standing in the doorway. It was like I'd f<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>en unconcious within that split second and seen
it and had to force myself to open my eyes again. I believe that figure was
Death. Tho he (for some reason c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ing
Death a he seems right to me) didn't have his scythe, it seems to fit to me, it
feels right. I think I will be searching my entire life to find out the reason
He visited and hope someone out there can help me. I am not afraid of this
vision but maybe a little of what it could mean. I have had a feeling lately
that I might have some kind of power as I've always had a kind of insight in to
others minds and truthful guesses into the future or past. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Recently I had another experience but I felt this was
entirely different. I was asleep, dreaming about something that I can't
remember, when I awoke suddenly. I had my arms up behind me on the pillow and I
swear I could feel my hands around a guy on the ribs, it just felt like a guy.
The feeling went away very suddenly and I became aware of a presence in my
pitch black room. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I thought I saw a darker patch of black standing next to the
bed and could feel a menacing presence there. It stayed until I plucked up the
courage to grab my mobile and turn its light on that spot. There was nothing
there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've felt that presence several times since then but not in
the last couple of weeks. Also while reading some of the stories on this site
I've felt things like the stories were affecting something, they re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y spoke to me. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Especi<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y one I
just read entitled 'My House Expirence'.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Cromer</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">High School</st1:PlaceType>, NSW, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region></st1:place>, 1987. Our physical
education class has been cancelled due to thundery conditions, therefore, we
were sent to the libarary instead. A cluster of mates and I would often get
into in depth conversations, especi<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
when they involved a supernatural matter. Perhaps we thought we could startle
one another with our spook stories, but at least it kept us out of mischief.
There was always suppostion of "Kelly," an apparation of a young girl
who haunted Wakehurst Parkway, a long stretch of road in which you could get to
Frenches Forest, rather than having to travel along Pittwater Rd, then up
Warringah Rd, in order to get there. It was apparant that she was raped and
murdered back during the seventies, when hitchhiking along <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Wakehurst Parkway</st1:address></st1:Street>. <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Wakehurst Parkway</st1:address></st1:Street> was indeed infamous for
it's many fateful car incidents, where many fatalities have occured over the
years. Some people claim that "Kelly" has been known to cause certain
accidents, especi<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y when she would
enter people cars after midnight and if she wasn't informed to get out, your
car would often swerve off the road. "Kelly" was more often than not
was our more favourable topic of supernatural conversation. Whenever we'd speak
of her, one specific mate of mine would remain silent, as if the conversation
bothered him, or perhaps he was just plain old scared. It was this particular
libarary visit when he decided to share with his mates. You see, not so long
before his mother was involved in an auto wreck along the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Wakehurst Parkway</st1:address></st1:Street>. She claimed to have
seen "Kelly" herself seated beside her in the passenger's seat, as
she made her way back home during the early hours of the morning. It was not
long after she had seen "Kelly," had she crashed her car. Luckily
enough, she had survived the ordeal. When my mate spoke of this story, myself
and the others exchanged numerous glances of disbelief. Being a collection of
obnoxious fourteen year old boys, of course we thought he was full of it and
that he was trying to out do us <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>.
Still, he seemed so sincere of what he told us, and I guess deep within my soul
I did believe, but didn't want to be deemed the sucker by the rest of my mates.
Even so, still until this very day, I often get goosebumps and feel uneasy
whenever I mention this story to other people. From personal experience,
whenever somebody mentions something regarding the supernatural and the hair on
your neck rises, you definitely know there is truth to what's mentioned.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi. My name is Faye. I live in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>. This is a true
"ghost" story, which happened to me about a year ago. When I was in
year 6 at school, I went on a school trip to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I went there with some of
the teachers and children from my school. We stayed at a place c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed Chateau du Baffy, in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Normandy</st1:place></st1:State>. When we first arrived, me and my
friends were quite scared, because the place we were staying at was right
opposit a church, with a graveyard, and it looked rather freaky in the dark. We
were scared that the place was going to be haunted. I was sharing a room with 3
of my friends, and we <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> belived in
ghosts, a bit. Our room was right at the end of a corridor, I think it may have
been room 29? I can't remember. But that isn't important. Anyway, the week soon
passed, and there was no sign of anything remotely ghostly or freaky. Untill
the last night. On our last night there, we had a disco. Everyone went to the
disco and had fun. Before going, my friend locked the door of our room and made
sure it was locked, which it was. when we came back from the disco, my other
friend, who didn't have a key for the room at that time, pushed the door to our
room, and it opened. You may be thinking "So what? she opened a door. big
whoop." but my friend, Kim, was the only one who had a key, and she had
been at the disco <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> night, and she
hadn't unlocked the door before my other friend opened it. So the door should
have been locked. I thought that maybe the lock was just broken, and didn't
think it was freaky at first. But then we went inside the room. The only was I
can desribe it is tot<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y trashed.
The duvets had been taken off the beds and thrown on the floor and <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> the contents of our sutcases and bags had been
emtied out into random piles on the floor. Before the party, I had layed out my
clothes, that I was going to wear on the trip home, on a chair by my bed, and
they were crumpled up on the floor. There was water on the bathroom floor.
Obviously, no one could have gotten in the room, since it was locked (untill
now, of course) and no one could have gotten in through the windows, either
because our window had a view of the patio area just outside where we had the
disco, and someone would have seen if anyone went in through the window. It
could have been that the lock on the door was broken, and someone got into our
room, but person<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y, I think it was
ghosts. If anyone else has an idea of who or what could have trashed our room,
or if you have been to Chateau du Baffy and had similar experiences, feel free
to email me at yayfayethefreak8@hotmail.com</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I live in the <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>these events happened at my grandparents
house in central <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Mexico</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
First I want to tell my own personal experience. This happened five years ago,
I was 15 at the time, my parents, my brother &amp; sister &amp; I were on
vacation in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Mexico</st1:country-region></st1:place>
&amp; we were staying at my grandparents house. My gramps house are basic<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y seven adjacent rooms including the bathroom
(kind of like sm<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> apartments).
This means that no matter what room you're in you have to step outside and walk
into the room youre wanting to go to. Well any way it was the first night in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region> and it
was time to go to sleep. My parents were sleeping in my dad's old room &amp; my
brother and sister were sleeping in my grandparents room with my grandparents.
I Had to sleep in my old uncle's room. After wathing tv for a while I decided
to get some shut eye. As I was about to go to sleep I heard some sounds in the
room, it sounded like a child was crying on the sofa in front of my bed. I sat
up a little scared and confused trying to see if anything was there but I
didn't see or hear anything. I remember I started thinking to myself that maybe
it was my imagination &amp; that I was just tired from the long trip, so I laid
back in bed &amp; again as I was about to go to sleep I heard someone outside
my room's window laughing very diabolic<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y.
Scared, I stuck my head under the covers, seconds later I could hear it
breathing heavily over me. I remember I yelled "What the F###".got up
off the bed with just boxers on and ran to my grandparents room. I told my
grandparents what happened and they told me to sleep with my brother. My
grandma who is a very religious lady stepped outside and started saying prayers
around the house. For the rest of that vacation I didn't hear or see anything
&amp; I never slept in that room again. This other event happened in the early
80's before I was born and it happened in another room in the house, it was
told to me by my uncle's wife. She told me that one night she was sewing on her
bed, she had just put my new born cousin to sleep in her crib. She happened to
look up at her closets mirror and saw a man smiling at her, then he disappeared
and just as soon as he disappeared blood started running down the mirror. She
says she got scared but she still ran up to the closet and opened it cause she
didn't want any blood staining her cloths. When she opened the door the blood
stopped and it disappeared. I asked my uncle for the history of the house and
he told me that my grandparents bought the property In The 1950's and they
built <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> of the house, but before
my gramps bought the property people say that in the late night people wearing
dark hoods would walk into the property and do witchcraft or satanic rituals
there. That it for now I have more stories but I'll save them for some other
time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Haunted Experiences</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: elizadushkuslover@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Two of my most biggest passions have always been history and
the paranormal. I had the chance to do a final paper for my english 101 class
on a controversial topic, so I picked to write on hauntings in old town, san
diego (the birthplace of san diego/and state of california). I did so much
research on haunted activity in old town that I can give a tour of it with my
eyes closed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I never actu<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
experienced anything paranormal in my life until i started to write this paper.
To get more information, I decided to visit the famous Whaley House, which is
known as one of <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>'s
most haunted houses, and is also in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Old</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Town</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. I hadn't been to
the whaley house since fourth grade, so I didn't re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
remember anything about it. The minute we walked into the house, which is a
museum, the docent told us that the chandelier in the theater upstairs was
swinging, as well as the one downstairs in the dining room. my friend and i
walked into the dining room, and sure enough, the chandelier was swaying as if
someone had just touched it, but it was moving at a constant speed, not slowing
down or speeding up. we watched this for about 5 minutes and then went into the
courtroom of the house. I was giving my friend a history lesson about how a
group of city officials broke inside the house and stole <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
the court documents because they wanted to move the courthouse but Mr. Whaley
wouldn't let them break their lease. As I told her this, i saw a shadow in the
figure of a man walk along the side of the w<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
next to the windows in the room. No one was in the room except us, and only
someone in the room could have produced that shadow. It didnt scare me until i
realized that it was dead silent in the room. I clearly saw someone walking,
but heard no sound at <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>. We then
went into the theater of the house, and were sitting in the seats, just
talking. I look back just to look aroun the room and see a b<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> of bright light the size of a softb<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> in the middle of the aisle. no light was coming
off of it. it was a dimly lit room, so i know i saw a b<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
of light. It moved back and disappeared 2 seconds later. Again, we were the
only ones in this room. It was getting late, and the museum was closing. My
friend walked outside and i was inside the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>way
talking to the 2 docents for more info. We were the only ones in the house at
this point. I start to hear loud footsteps and i thought it was my friend until
i realize that they are coming from above me. One of the docents asks us if we
both heard it, and we both say we did. My friend was waiting outside when we
heard these.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I went back several times after that trip and experienced a
lot more stuff. One time I was in the theater again with a different friend
when she said that she felk someone lightly run their fingers through her hair.
That same time, i felt someone leaning over my right shoulder. On a different
occasion I felt a tug on my jeans as i was walking right above my knee. i felk
someone grab my pants and tug them. It's like i felt an actual hand grab my
pants. The most recent thing to happen to me was when i was in the house during
the daytime. I was standing at the foot of the stairs and i caught the odor of
a cigar. It smelled like someone had just come inside that minute from smoking.
It didn't smell like it was cheap, either. Mr. whaley was known for smoking the
finest cuban cigars (back when they were legal). No one was walking around that
area at the time, and i went outside to see if anyone was smoking, but there
was no one there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">These experiences changed the way i look at life. I have
always been interested in hauntings, but have never experienced anything until
i decided to go to the whaley house. Now i know that ghosts re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y do exist.</p>

</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day my Aunt Chelsea was talking to my Uncle Eric (this
was about 10 yrs. ago),and she was about 7 or 8 and my uncle was about 12 and
she said,"Hey Eric come meet my new friend in the backyard i named her the
lady in white!'' and he said ,'' Why did you name her that?'' she said
,''Because she always wears white.'' So they both went into the backyard and
came to see that there was nothing there.So then <st1:City w:st="on">Chelsea</st1:City>
pointed at thin air and said,''There she is.'' and then he said ,"<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Chelsea</st1:City></st1:place> theres nothing
there what are you talking about?Lets go inside.'' So they both started to walk
back and then <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chelsea</st1:place></st1:City>
looked back and pointed and said,''Eric look there she is!'' So Eric looked
back and seen her and screamed and started running in the house without Chelsea
and then Chelsea said,''Eric Wait! she's trying to take me!'' and then Eric ran
back and grabbed Chelsea and ran inside.The reason I know the lady in white is
a real ghost is because every now and then when you go in there back yard you
can see glimpses of her just by looking around and another reason I know this
is true is because a girl named Evalyn used to live there and died in that
house while wearing the color white and the reason i know this is because
Evalyn was my Grandmother!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, My husband and I stayed at a bed and breakfast in
Arrow Rock, MO. 2 years in a row. (our wedding night and our first year wedding
anniversary) The year of our wedding night nothing happened and it was so
beautiful and wonderful there. The night of our first year wedding anniversary,
we went back to Arrow Rock stayed in the same bed and breakfast. We went to bed
and after sometime laying there, I started dozing off and subconsciously kept
hearing a woman crying. I woke up and noticed Mike had his eyes closed and as
any good wife would do I nudged him and asked him if he heard that. He said
heard what as he was coming out of his dozing state. I said I think the lady is
crying, meaning that lady that owns the bed and breakfast. I know her name but
out of privacy and for the sake of her business I wont say it. I heard it again
several times and so did my husband. He got out of bed and went out one of the
bedroom doors that led into the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>way
and I got up and opened the door that led into the dining room, we both met in
the middle of the dining room and we could still hear her crying. But it was
coming from the music room and not her bedroom which was upstairs and not above
the music room. My husband walked into the music room and I walked to the music
room door. As I was standing there I felt something weird behind me so I just
stood there not moving and then I felt what felt like fingertips running down
the back of my neck. I very quickly ran into the music room and wrapped my arms
around my husband. We both stood and talked a little bit about the woman crying
and I told him I wondered what was wrong with her and why she was so sad. I
pretty much knew it wasnt the lady that owned the house but the next morning I
asked her if she had been crying that night and she said no. But I know what I
felt and we havent gone back since, even though I would re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y like to. Thank you, Wendy</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I LOVE your
site!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a story to tell and since
you get hundreds, I'll cut to the chase.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am employed at a local luxury movie theatre in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Wichita</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Kansas</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About two years ago, there was an instance
where an individual went into cardiac arrest and eventu<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
died in what is now considered auditorium 16.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides the fact that this a scary thing to think about, now from
several eyewitnesses, there seems to be SOMETHING lurking the cavernous h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ways and auditoriums of this theatre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One particular case is while waiting on a
film to finish in #16, <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> patrons
had apparently left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the employee
went in to clean it, while the theatre was still dark, they saw what was
believed to be a customer still watching the credits, at the very top row.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the lights came up, nobody was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second instance was with regards to the
womens restrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the end of the
night, when <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> but a few customers
had left, an employee went in to clean. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After it being spotless, a return visit only 30 minutes
later showed that toilet paper in one perticular st<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
was torn up and scattered about the floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This same thing has happened to several employees and always at closing
time, and always the same st<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third instance was more recent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A manager and employee were finishing up
closing duties.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>They both saw a
mysterious figure of a person 'dash'</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">up the balcony stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unsure of what it could be, the employee followed and found nothing. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">These experiences have not been proven by any professional
experts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are just strange things
that are witnessed by us 'normal' theatre people.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I've only had a few encounters with ghosts. When I was 11, I
had my first encounter of spirits. I don't quite remember when it took place,
but I do remember it was a saturday morning. I stayed up late the night before
watching friday night videos for me that was a treat because we only got 3
channels. But it was around 10 am and I was expecting to sleep in to well after
1pm, but it just didn't turn out that way. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The night before my aunt asked my mom if she would be able
to watch my cousins for the day while my aunt worked. So my mom said she would
be happy to, she would pick them up before 10 sat. morning. Well meanwhile I
was getting pretty irritated because I heard kids running up and down the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> way. We live in a trailer so you could hear and
feel everything in a trailer. Well I heard them run to the back of the trailer,
they were having a good time laughin' and screamin'. It was cute but not after
a late night like I had. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I hear them running toward the front of the trailer I
decided I would open my door and scare them while they ran past. So I heard
them comin' and as I opened my door and hollared there was nobody there. I was
kinda freaked out...half asleep and...dont re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
know what to think. I heard a car door slam, as I looked outside I saw my mom,
my sister and my two cousins getting out of the car. So as my mom came into the
house she said "good i'm glad your awake." I was scared to death not
knowing what to think....what to feel. She said to me, "If you weren't up,
I was gonna have the kids wake you up." It was very freaky..to this day I
get chills thinking about the laughs and the screamin and fun time the
"kids" were having. That's it..thanks!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">All this happened when I was 18 and 19 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think that what caused it <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> to occur is when I had taken off to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City> precipitously,
didn&#8217;t tell anyone till I landed there, was robbed in the first week and had no
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lacking accommodations I spread
my sleeping bag out over a tombstone in St Mary Abbot&#8217;s churchyard each night
and would dream that I was asking the interred people permission to crash
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They politely assented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I returned to the <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region> I was not ready for university yet though
accepted at McGill in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montreal</st1:place></st1:City>
for the next f<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> semester.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a waiter job which ended abruptly when
an entire family saw their dinner plates levitate behind me from right hand to
left before I placed them deftly on the table.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were suddenly not hungry anymore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eerie stuff kept happening over the next months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ll never forget one night when I approached
my station wagon in the dark street and it looked as if 2 long-haired grey
coloured men were sitting inside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Simultaneously in a horrible synchronous motion they slumped from the
seat with their legs hanging down lifelessly from either side of the car, as if
they were being pulled feet first downward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And as the front doors seemed to swing open<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw them both sink into the ground together.
Horror-struck, I had to muster <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
my strength to walk past the car and into the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few weeks later I was trying to f<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> asleep and turned over several times in
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thrust my hand under the pillow
and felt it seized by an immensely strong cold hand. It would not let go when I
pulled my hand back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly it did and
I turned over to see a phantom materialising from the floor up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It looked like it was filling in the form of
a man with purplish-grey indescribably smoky and wavering light and while it
was bending toward me I could see it clutching toward my body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember being so frightened as I felt its
icy fingers around my heart that I re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
thought it was the end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fainted and
then knew a deep sleep in which I dreamt that night the most vivid dream of my
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew at the time it was a
message sent to me from the past and this was about momentous events that
seemed to take me back alive many centuries and described people and
circumstances that would reappear later in my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t do justice to it after <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> these years, I can only say that intervening
time has taught me that this was intended for me to learn by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Several more eventful months passed and at last I went up to
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to start school. But I had warned everyone that I was not ready for school, too
wild to settle down, and I was thoroughly dangerous myself at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were frequent brushes with death,
accidents at work like a roto tiller coming untied and smashing blades first
into the cab of the truck I was driving, missing severing my head by mere
inches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were too many such-like
harrowing escapes to be ascribed to mere coincidence. I knew I had made someone
or something angry and a certain protection we take for granted had been
removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first night at school I settled into my dorm room and
had already made some friends and gone rock climbing with them on the cliffs of
<st1:place w:st="on">Mount Royal</st1:place> to relax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was awakened from sleep by someone knocking
at the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was a dorm room 70
feet above the ground, mind, but in my torpid state I saw nothing strange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Outside the window was a handsome naked blond
man about 25 years old but very pale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
motioned that he wanted to enter and I opened the window after some
hesitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like a dream and I
still remember that suddenly there was this big grey-furred feline creature
circling my little dorm room faster and faster, I can remember its lithe tread
and how it pounced abruptly upon me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately I was beneath the blond man who was suddenly making love to
me with the insistence of someone who has been hard up for a long time. His
body felt cold and irresistibly strong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember only being aware of this state but that somehow I desired <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> his amorous attentions.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I mentioned my encounter to the other guys on the
floor, they didn&#8217;t say anything at first.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surprisingly they didn&#8217;t express any scorn for this encounter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead they <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
looked very scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them fin<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y said that from my description it resembled a
man who was found outside the dorm in April of that year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had frozen to death and been buried under
the snow for months before anyone knew of it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After that encounter I knew somehow that my life was
imperiled, my hold on it was slipping.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The spirit had apparently known I was at a weak point in my life and was
trying to get me and keep me with it in the other dimension where it
dwelt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mentioned premonitions of death
to my friends and felt a helplessness and despair of life that I cannot adequately
describe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thankfully I have never felt
it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few weeks later I had to be
resuscitated in hospital due to heart failure and was without a heartbeat for
over 10 minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It&#8217;s taken me years to put these experiences down though I
remember them and many others often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
hope that by putting them out in the public domain I don&#8217;t revive this activity
but maybe others can learn from what I experienced 30 years ago.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 2 yrs old, my mom used to play a game c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed "monster" with me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But one night after that, I was in my bed, then I heard a
noise on my bed, then woke up, I then saw my Tommy doll sitting upright on my
bed.After I saw that, I was wide awake, because my mom never put it there.So I
sat up, tucked it in with me, and went right back to sleep.Then, once again, I
woke up and saw my Tommy doll, standing on my bed, and it was transparent.I was
so scared, I was silent.Then he took out those knife glove (Freddy Krueger
style) and then thats where I screamed like a little girl (Re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y) and my mom and dad came in and held me.That
was the scariest day of my life.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 5, my mom told me that my dad had a "ghost
friend" named Mickey.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So after <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
thses years, I fin<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y got used to
Mickey.But sometimes, he still freaks us out.</p>

but when i was 11(i am now 12)i was staying at my grandmas house (in england)
and i was looking out of the window. my cousin and sister were fighting at the
other end of the room and on the drive i saw a man in victorian clothes with
dark hair and a mustache. it freaked me out because even though ive belived in
ghosts since i was 8 i have only had 1 ghostly experience(an orb). now i
thought i must have been imagining it but when i told my grandma she asked me
to describe him so i did and her face went pale, she got a picture from her
bedroom, was it this man, she said. it was and she then told me that he was her
father and that i shouldnt be scared of him .(did i mention that day was my

yavapai nation.i have a personal experience i would like to share with you. One
night when i was walking home in the dark with my older brother. It was very
dark and quiet, nothing in particular was happening until we saw something.
Over a sm<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> hill we could see a
shadow that was completly black. Although it was dark we could make out the
figure that resembled a person. It was about 50 feet from us and we couldn't
hear footsteps and it appeared to be floating above the ground. It looked like
a bunch of little dots put together. We both saw it and we got scared and took
off. Before that my brother said he saw that with my older sister while walking
home a few weeks before. I have had conversations with other people on the
reservation and some of them have said to have seen the same thing. Another
time i was walking home about 3 oclock in the morning from my friends house
alone. I wasn't too far when I could hear people talking. I didnt think much of
it so i continued walking. I was in the middle of a field and i could still
hear people talking and laughing. The moon was out and I could see the area
pretty good. I stopped and looked around. Then it sounded like little kids
laughing around, around me. So i went a near by house and looked in the window
and everybody was asleep. I double checked to see if the tv was off and it was.
I waited a little when i heard footsteps in the gravel . There was a dog next
me that could hear it too. I looked around and saw nobody around. Then out of
nowhere i heard someone say "Hey" in a soft whisper. I freaked out
and ran in the house and asked them for a ride home. I know that this
reservation has alot of history behind it dealing with a fort for soldiers back
in the Geronimo years. There have been alot of death here and a lot that has
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hear numerous stories from
people who encouter such things as myself, but i dont let that keep me from
walking in the dark.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AT TEN BROECK AND AT MY MOMS HOUSE</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Bigowhiskeygirl@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was at Ten Broeck Hospital's Office/ Formerly The Kentucky
Military Institute taking care of some business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While waiting for the lady to find some paper
work my friend and I decided to go exploring. In a room next to the waiting
room was a large portrait of the family who ran the institute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not know why but my attentions were
drawn to the daughter of the family. It was a re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
strange feeling I had felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back
to the waiting area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman came out
of the office and I began telling her about the picture. AT the time I had no
idea who the portrait was of. The woman explained to me who the family was and
that the daughter who had drawn my attention had been seen haunting the place.
Just about the time she said that I felt a very cold breeze go through me and
come back through me. It was a cold unlike any I had ever known. It was beyond
bone cold. To this day when I tell the story and think about it I get cold
chills.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now for my mom's house. I have had many experiences. I have seen shadows
float down her h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>way, seen figures
in windows, heard footsteps in her kitchen when no one was in there. We would
be in the living room with the kitchen door locked when <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
of a sudden the back door would open then shut, and footsteps could be heard
but no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We heard the hot
water heater explode when it was still in tackt and we heard the front window
break when it didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night for over
an hour and a half her kitchen floor shook for no reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Drawers would open and close by
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not sure of the full
history of the house, however, I do know that it was built in 1959 and my
parents got the house in 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before
they got the house 4 families had moved in and out within the first 3
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One family was expecting their
first child when she miscarried and two of the families were newly weds who
after moving in there within 6 months got divorced. I am not quite sure about
the fourth family. I am sure if ghost hunters could go into that house they
would find something.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: obisjadedjedi@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The house I grew up in was most definitely haunted it was a
140 year old brownstone in Brooklyn <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New
  York</st1:place></st1:State>. I lived there for 16 years. After my mother had
had a cup flung at her from the cabinet (while my father</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">watched) my parents had a Wiccan exorcism performed on the
house. I was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">2 when we moved in so I can't remember when things were that
bad, but after the exorcism my father says that things calmed down. My first
memory of an encounter with a ghost first hand came when I was about 5 or 6
years old. I had just gone to bed for the night, and as I lay in bed trying to
f<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> asleep I felt a hand begin to
stroke my hair back<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from my forehead. I
opened my eyes expecting to see my mother and instead saw nothing. Though
someone was still gently stroking my hair NO ONE was their. My eyes about
bulged out of my head.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On Christmas eve of the same year I decided that I was going
to stay up until I saw Santa clause to see if he was real or not. I sat up <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> night waiting for Santa to come, and he did.
Even at that age I was shocked. He came into y room red suit and <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> and said merry Christmas then waved good by and
left. The next morning I was livid I demanded to know why my parents had
tricked me, I even accused my over weight godfather of the Santa hoax. My
parents were baffled, the ate the cookies and bit the end of the carrots we
left out for the reindeer, but they had never gone as far as to dress up as
Santa. My father is a very t<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
skinny man, and would make an awful Santa, he maintains to this day that my
seeing Santa that night not only confused him, but scared him, and that he had
always blamed it on the ghost.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">During my teen years things began to occur much more
frequently. On St. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Patrick&#8217;s day of 1998 I saw a little boy, constantly. He
would be standing in the stairwell at my school, the subway tracks, my class
rooms. He couldn't have been more then 7 years old, had light blond hair and
was dressed in turn of the century clothing with a little brown tweed vest and
hat. He didn't frighten me, nor did I feel threatened by him. I never saw him
again after that, but one day while my brother and I were exchanging ghost
stories he began to say that he would often see a little boy in our court yard,
as he began to describe him my mouth dropped, I had never told any one in my
family about the boy only two of my friends from school who had been with me
when I saw him. My brother said he had seen him by the trash cans, when he
talked to the boy he simply looked at him and disappeared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my father went on a business trip to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City> my brother, dog and I went to stay
with my mother. After about a week I realized I had forgotten my dogs favorite
toy at my dad's house. When I went to get it I remembered I had left it on the
top floor of the house. I hate the top floor. It was my bedroom for years and I
hated it then as much as I hate it now. Even in the middle of the day you get
this terrible oppressive feeling when you walk up there. This was one of the more
frightening things to happen to me. I was <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
alone and no one had been in the house for at least a week. I heard voices and
footsteps as if there were three of four people in the house. I couldn't make
out what they were saying but they got louder the further upstairs I got. I
found my dogs toy and bolted out of the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another day when I was home alone I heard a woman humming
for some reason this did not seem odd to me at first. It wasn't until I
realized that the humming had followed me from my bedroom on the third floor
down to the kitchen on the ground floor that it occurred to me that it perhaps
wasn't normal to hear disembodied humming.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The room next to our kitchen was the second most frightening
room in the house. My brother, my fathers girl friend Veronica, who lived with
us for a while and I would <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> see a
large black figure in that room. I would often cut through the court yard on my
way home from school and go through the back door, one day I found Veronica
waiting out their with a bag o groceries at first she claimed she had lost her
key a little while later she confessed that she was to frightened to go through
the room next to the kitchen by herself and she did not have a key to the front
door (which was on the second floor).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In July of 2004 I let my dog out in the court yard at about
3am (I didn't sleep very much) He had cancer and was very weak so I knew he
wouldn't run away. I was in the kitchen making a pitcher of iced tea. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I had finished I thought it odd that he had not come
back inside. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I went out to find him and found he was right in front of
the back door staring down at the other end of the court yard. "Do you
need to go or not?" I asked him, he had been pestering me to go out and I
didn't want to have to take him in only to bring him out again a minute later. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Norm<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y when I
would talk to my dog he would look at me, this time he just kept his focus. I
joked down the court yard to see what he was staring at. There at the other end
of the court yard was something very bright and round. I squinted to see if it
was a bag of some sort as it began floating down the stairs towards us I
grabbed my dog and pulled him inside. No way was I waiting around for the
glowing orb to come over and say hello.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When Veronica was living with us she had several experiences
in the upstairs room. One morning she woke to find water dripping on her head,
and when she looked to find a leak there was nothing. Another time on of the
windows flew open, and one of r perfume bottles was thrown from a dresser shattering
on the floor. (which would always stick and very difficult to open) This was
nothing compared to the story another one of his girlfriends told us years
later. This is taken from my blog which I wrote the day both my father and his
girlfriend told me:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"Early in the morning my dad heard the dog in his room
so he gets up annoyed that the dog is in there and is going to take him out so
he will leave dad alone. But the dog is not in my dads room in fact the door is
closed. So dad goes down stairs to walk the dog. Meanwhile Lisa is still in
bed. She feels something about cat size jump on her but is to scared to open
her eyes knowing we do not have a cat then she feels a huge weight on her chest
and she can't move and she hears voices speaking in rhyme talking about whether
or not they should let her up. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She manages to turn over and grab her cell phone to c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> my dad and ask if the house is haunted, he says
yes. She sees my dad come in and fix the blankets. Fin<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
she gets up and opens <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> the blinds
to let light in. Then her dad comes in and starts talking to her. She tries to
leave but when she opens the door she finds another door without a door knob. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Looking back she sees an 8ft t<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
man dressed <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> in white tattered
clothes with the head of a bird. The next thing she knew she was back in bed.
There was no cell phone, my dad never fixed the blankets, and it wasn't a dream
because <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> of the blinds were open
and hadn't been before. Creepy right?"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So that's my story. At least <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
I remember of it. I live 3,00 miles away now. My dad is about to move out of
the house, sad because I've always wanted to do some sort of investigation. I
was always to frightened to try EVP or anything like that when I lived there
and there is no amount of money that would make me use a Ouija board in there.
Over the houses many years there have been 3 suicides that I know of each
taking place 28 years apart. One woman put her head in the oven, a man hung
himself on the gate the court yard, and another slit their wrists. There has
been at least one funeral. For a little boy, the body was in the house during
the funeral. And who knows what else. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We've had sludge come out of <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
the drains only to disappear when a plumber looks at it and then reappear when
he's left. We've had the same whole in the ceiling plugged up at least 4 times,
each time it returns. As strange as it is I sort of miss living in a haunted
house some times.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, Ive been reading the stories on your sight for years
now. I have had some paranormal experiences,but until now I haven't had the
courage to tell anyone. The following is the most recent.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About 5 years ago after the final breakup in an on again off
again relationship, I decided it was time for a change. So I didn't renew the
lease on the house we had lived in for about 8 years.We had a hard time finding
anything,and the deadline was fast approaching,so I signed a leas on a house
that can most nicely described as a dump.Natur<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
I was depressed, for <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> the reasons
I just listed. One day my mother decided to pick my daughter up from the public
pool located at the local park.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When she saw what on the outside looked like a very nice
house for rent. Knowing my situation she told me about the house,and said it
wouldn't hurt for me to look at it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So a friend of mine,and I decided we would.on entering the
house I knew I was home (You know that feeling of belonging you get when you
return home after being gone a while?) I instantly knew where everything was
too. The lady who went to look at it with me thought the basement door in the
kitchen might be the bathroom, but I told her no it's upstairs. I still don't
know how I knew but I did. Well I fell in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">love with this lovely craftsmen style home with it's hardwood
floors, real wood </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">facings,baseboards,and bay window complete with window
seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I put a stop on the check I put
the deposit on the other house with,and signed a years lease on this gorgeous
home. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We moved in around the end of July,and things went great,
the feeling of belonging grew,it got to where I hated to leave the house I was
so happy with it. In fact I cant even find the words to express how happy I was
to be at home. Anyone who knows me knows that's not normal I'm not a homebody
at <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>. But anyway things were
fabulous for about a month. Then the bats started to fly around my house at
night. Annoying,but hardly paranormal, right?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bats were a problem,but they weren't in the house every night,so I c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed my landlord,and complained.(Didn't do much
good) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway one day while working in the kitchen I noticed the
paint on the door facing leading to the dinning room was peeling. And my
daughter noticed there was writing under it. upon investigation we discovered
that it was a height chart for 2 little boys who had lived there at one time (I
say little,but by the time it was done they were t<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>er
than me.) Deciding it was too charming to leave covered we scraped off the old
paint to reveal what we could.(One boy's name was no longer legible) Shortly
after that my daughter, and I were watching TV. one weekend night (One of the
few without the bats)When around 10:pm we began to hear some sort of
pounding,that sounded like it was coming from upstairs.So I went up to find out
what was blowing around,and move it.So I went upstairs,and nothing not one
sound. Thinking it had stopped I went back downstairs to finish my program,
just to find the pounding hadn't stopped. deciding it must be the basement door
to the outside, I went downstairs to check it out. When I got downstairs I
could still hear the pounding,but it sounded like it was coming from
upstairs<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the house somewhere. Well
since I couldn't find the source I decided to just turn up the television,and ignore
it. I had practice at that from a house I had lived in another time.But that's
another story.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway my daughter got tired and decided to go to bed,I
stayed in the living room watching TV. and discovered the pounding stopped
about 4:am. I also decided it must be a neighbor pounding a nail or something.
Thing went on pretty normal for a while with an occasion<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
bat here,and there,but otherwise normal. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It was during this
normal period that one morning I got up off the couch where I slept while
school was in session,so I could use the TV. as an alarm clock. Anyway one
morning<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after Amber (My daughter) left
for school I went into the kitchen to get something to drink,and when I was
coming back through the dinning room I could swear<span style="">&nbsp; </span>just for half a second I saw a woman with
long dark hair,wearing some kind of black,and yellow dress hurry across my
closed in front porch. Imagination right? </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That was autumn of my first year there. That winter my
mother who had emphysema became quite ill,and lapsed into a coma. I would
excuse Amber from school,and go to the city to see her with my father every
chance I got. But whenever I would come home from anywhere that winter I would
find the window in my bedroom open.This continued <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
winter,I would close the window,and go out just to find it open the next time I
entered the room. Mom stayed comatose for almost a year,then got better.but had
<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ot of rehab time to go through.
So she had to stay in the hospital in the city,we would go down and see her
whenever we had a chance, One spring evening when we got home Amber looked up
at our house,and showed us a large circle of light on the outside of our house
just above the second floor window,just below the eves. I knew it wasn't the
setting sun,because the house is completely shaded in front by 3 very large trees.
That summer after having gone to see my mother who was moved to a nursing home
tempor<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y to finish rehab,I came
home about to make a puddle.So I hurried upstairs to find I couldn't open the
bathroom door. It was blocked from the inside by the pedestal fan I used to
cool it with. See the upstairs of an old house gets very hot in the summer,and
I didn't have an air conditioner,the bathroom was too sm<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
to put the fan inside and close the door,but we were both girls so it wasn't
important to close the door. I was Finlay able to get it open before I made the
puddle, but Was very confused by it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then one day the pounding that only happened at night till
then started in the day. I was in the kitchen hand washing the lace sheers I
kept in the living room,and asked<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amber
to hang them on the clothes line to dry. When she came in she asked me what I
had wanted. Not knowing what she was talking about I asked, " What?"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She said that she heard me tapping on<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>window and wanted to know what I wanted. I hadn't<span style="">&nbsp; </span>taped the window at <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>.(
Another unusual thing about that house is when I would kill one of the bats
they didn't bleed)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We<span style="">&nbsp; </span>lived in the house
for about 3 years( I hate to move,and mom was sick,and need me to take care of
her so I didn't relay have time to move.)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The feeling of home,and welcome had worn off around the
second year,but it was so gradual I didn't even notice it at first.During <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> this time I was plagued by nightmares,and had to
have a light on somewhere in the house so i could see it at <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> times just to sleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was having some financial trouble,and got behind on my
cable bill so the company shut it off. But I still had the TV. set for 6:am.
One Friday night, Amber decided to go to a school dance,and spend the night
with a friend. So I spent the night alone watching video tapes till I got tired
enough to go to sleep. The next morning I was awakened by someone tapping my
shoulder. I opened my eyes to see a young child pointing at the blue screen TV.
I'm used to having young children around because I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>have my nephews children on occasion. But not
this time. Anyway being used to children I didn't think it was odd. So I just
shrugged my shoulders,and turned over to go back to sleep. Then I thought to
myself wait a minute I've never seen this kid before in my life. When I rolled
back over to find out who my visitor was, the room was empty. I got up very
fast,and looked every where but there was no one in that house but me. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That was the last night I ever spent in that house. After
that I started staying at my folks house to take care of mom till she passed
away,and the following spring my dad asked us to move in because he was lonely.
I don't know if that house is haunted by anything but bats,and possibly noisy
pipes,and active imaginations, or not. I don't think I want to find out either.
Thanks for reading my story.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Old Hag</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: mandylee@brightok.net </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, i've been coming to your sight for about 5 or 6 years,
and have even had some of my stories posted. And this is still the best sight i
have came across and have even got some of my friends and family hooked on your
sight.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway heres my storie.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I belive what im about to wright about is known as Old Hag or Sleep
Paralysis. Now this is the first time i have ever had somthing like this happen
to me and let me tell you it was the scariest thing i've ever exspirened and i
even knew what was happing to me at the time, because i have done some research
about it. So i can't imagin what it fills like to someone who has not heard of
old hag have this happen to them.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Ok, this happend last year. One day i had decided to lay
down on the couch and take a little nap.I fell asleep fast and was dreaming
about many things that i can't rec<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>.
when i swicted to a re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y vived
dream. In the dream i was doing my spring cleaning and puting our (mine,my 3
kids and my husbands) winter clothes in the closet,like i always do when the
weather starts geting warm. When i opend my clothet door to put the clothes up,
when a young man in his late teens early 20s jumped out of the closet and tried
to grab me.His re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y mean look on
his face that, and i got a filling that he hated me and not just me but <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> woman. I woke up with a start and could not
move. It <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> lasted about a sec. I
could not move anthing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now the funny thing is that i did'nt have a filling of evil
in the room, or of any one in the room with me. I could breath fine and did't
have the filling of some one on my chest, but when i awoke from the dream i was
screaming as loud as i could(i have never screemed,talked or did anything like
that in my sleep) and was still trying to get way frome the man in my dream.
And when i was fin<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y released from
my paralysis i was staining so hard i actu<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
flew of the couch and ran to my husband asking why he did'nt help when i was
screaming and he told me that he i was not screaming, for he was just in the
other room and would of heard me, because our house is tiny. Later i relised
that i could not even sream during the hole episode ( i know i was re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y tring to scream out loud and not in my head, because
my troughte hurt like i've been yelling). And the other thing is that re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y freaked me out was that i was dreaming of other
stuff and i could not remember when i woke up and still can't remember what it
was i was dreaming of, but i can remember the dream about the man so cleary
tell this day. I can tell you what he looked like and everything.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well thats my storie i know its not that scary to some, but
let me tell you i have seen some freaky things in my 26 years and this by far
is the scariest thing that has ever happend to me and i hope its the last time
i ever half to fill that again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I think it's important to keep the record of paranormal
history going for all kinds of reasons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What I am going to divulge is not something that happened to me
personally, but rather told to me by a close friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Granted, she has a terrific sense of humor, but when telling
me about the occurrences at her childhood home, she wasn't laughing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary grew up in a small small town in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State> - so small
that I'd never heard of it before. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Her parents lived in an old building that used to be a mail
stop on the Pony Express, or so it was thought.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mary's home was unique in that it had a wrap around porch on the first
level, and a wrap around porch on the second level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During her growing up years, she would wake
up in the night hearing a cowboy's spurs chinging around the upper deck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as she got older, the spirit got a little
more possessive of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night in
high school, her male friend spent the night - which was okay'd by her
parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a close to the
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary tells me that Nick who was
sleeping down stairs on the floor in their living room couldn't sleep because
something kept yanking the sheets off him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fin<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y after the third yank,
he freaked and demaned to be taken home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mary said that their cowboy spirit never hurt anyone, but it did make
itself known in the household.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told
me she kinda liked that she had a cowboy watching over her - I think she misses
him, too.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: sbooth@carlsonwagonlit.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Just reading through some of the stories and wanted to share
my "experience".</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was always re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
close to my grandparents but closer to my Poppa (grandpa). After my nana passed
away my poppa would see her sitting on the couch in her favorite spot. I can't
say that I ever saw it, but when I would go and visit him, I would feel her or
smell her powder. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Soon after she passed away, my poppa got depressed and would
always visit the cemetery up to 4 or 5 times a day. He would always cry and say
that he will see her soon. This was very painful for my parents and I to
witness and as much as we loved my poppa very much, sometimes we thought it
would be better for him to join her. He just didn't want to be here anymore.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Eventu<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y he
started to forget things (where he was earlier in the day, what people had said
to him a couple minutes earlier, even if he c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed
us and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we talked to him.. he would c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> back angry that we weren't answering the phone)
Being his only grandchild and him being my second father, this devastated me to
see him in this condition.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Eventu<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y he
checked himself into the hospital, and I knew that he wasn't going to be coming
out on his own. I would go and visit him every weekend.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About 6 weeks into his stay, I went to visit before I went
to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calgary</st1:place></st1:City>.
This is where I get choked up. To anyone else this is nothing, to me this was
my goodbye. He remembered that I was going, he remembered who I was visiting
and he was tot<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y coherent. His
"roommate" had pulled my father outside to tell him that <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> night and day (before we got there) that my
poppa just kept saying "I have to say goodbye to Sara.. I just have to say
goodbye to Sara..." My father told me outside and said that it's just
because I'm going away. I knew right then and there that it was the last time I
was ever going to hug, kiss, feel, see, talk to my grandfather. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I left for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calgary</st1:place></st1:City>
with an open heart that I would come home to see him, but with the fear that I
would have to go home early. I got home on a Sunday and had bought my Poppa a
glass Hershey Kiss " A Kiss That Lasts Forever". </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thursday morning (two days before I was going to see him) I
woke up suddenly at 6:20 am. I didn't have to be at work until 12 noon, so
didn't know why I was walking up. About 5 minutes later, I heard the phone
ring. I knew it.. I just knew what that meant. I thought that if I keep my eyes
closed, its not happening. Minutes later, my mother came down to my room and
again "if i don't open my eyes, its not happening".. The look on my
mom's face said it <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>. My Poppa had
passed away that morning at around 6:15 am. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As my mom and I made our way to the hospital and to get my
dad, I was fine.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didn't cry.. once I got into the hospital room where he
was still laying..</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know how to explain how I felt, but t was scared and
had a feeling being overwhelmed. I looked out the window and it seemed like it
was brighter then it should be. I swear that I felt how happy he was. The
scared part was seeing him a way that I never had before. I wanted to give him
a kiss, but it was like something just kept me pinned to the w<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>. I couldn't move.. couldn't get close or
anything, but I could hear him "Sara, I just want a kiss goodbye". I
had to get my parents to do it for me. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I went to the house to get clothes for the funeral home, and
I got an overwhelming sensation. I can't explain what it was. I ended up taking
a shirt of his that I've always liked and wear it to bed sometimes to feel
close to him. It had just come out of the wash when I took it and I was so
scared to put it back in the washer, afraid that I would lose any sort of
closeness that I still had with him. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I haven't gone back to the house and its now sold, but for
some reason something just kept me from going. I try to talk to them, but never
get anything back. Its been almost a year since he passed away, so I'm hoping
that him and my nana are catching up, then I re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
hope to get some sort of sign from them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My First Apartment</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: jedirebel@tds.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had never had any experinces with the paranormal, in fact
I wasn't even sure I believed in ghosts or the paranormal until<span style="">&nbsp; </span>july of 2004.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I moved from my home of 10 years to an apartment in town. It
was closer to work and I felt that a change was needed in my life. The
apartment building used to an be office building, but it had been remodeled,
and a hardware store was underneath. The apartment I lived in was sm<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> but sufficient enough for me. I loved the
convience of living in town, and I liked my new home, but something about the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>way gave me the creeps, luckily, my apartment was
first one at the top of the stairs, so I didn't have to walk don the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>way to far.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night, about a month after I moved in, I started hearing
footsteps outside my door. At first, it sounded like someone walking by, then
later it sounded like someone running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was tired and was trying to sleep, I fin<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y
got mad and got up to open the door, there was no one there. I looked down the
h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> there was no one. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now my apartment was next to the stairs, the very first one,
so I went down stairs to check the door and it was locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been raining but there was no sign
anyone had come in. I went back upstairs, got back in bed and a minute later it
started again. It continued until I got to the door, and then stopped again. I
looked out in the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> again, but no
one was there. this happened a lot. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After about a year, I got a job closer to my house, so I
moved back. I went back the building recently, the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>way
still gives me the creeps.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">this happened to me when i was about fourteen.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i had returned home one night from a friends house to find
that my older brother, who was supposed to be staying with me while my mother
was out of town, had left and gone to a friends cabin for the night,
irresponsibly leaving me home alone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">too frightened to stay there by myself, i c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed a friend who said he would come pick me up.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">after turning off the lights in my house, i remembered to
put my dog out for a pee before i left. i c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed
out to him, and from where i stood, i could see him walk to the edge of the
kitchen, start barking and going in circles, like he was confused.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">frustrated, i went upstairs and picked him up and put him outside
on his chain. i stood inside and watched him through the screen door.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">chino, my dog, started barking like crazy. i turned around,
and for about fifteen seconds, it was as if someone was flipping the
lightswitch in the kitchen on and off very rapidly.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i threw my dog inside and got the hell out of there!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was alone</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Over 29 years ago when I was pregnant with my son and first
child, my husband and I was asked by my uncle if we wanted to renovate and rent
at a very reasonable price my Grandmother's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had been unrented for several months when we fixed it up, including
replacing almost <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> of the windows,
and moved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first night we slept
there I was awaken from sleep by someone nudging me and whispering,
"Scoot, wake up."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, Scoot
is a family nickname for me and my husband has never c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed
me that,but no one else was in the house so I turned over to see what he
wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was sound asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought maybe I was dreaming so I dozed
back off to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I felt the
someone grab my arm as if to shake me awake and heard the whispered,
"Scoot, wake up." I was wide awake by then and heard something
else--someone was trying to open our bedroom window!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ed
out my husband's name and said that I was c<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>ing
the police, which I did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came and
found foot prints in the wet ground beneath our window and footprints going off
toward the highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day I
believe it was the spirit of my grandmother or grandfather trying to wake me so
that I would not be hurt by someone breaking into the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">a few years back probably around 2001, 4 of us went driving
through Turnbull canyon from the <st1:place w:st="on">Hacienda Heights</st1:place>
portion to Whitter. we went around probably midnight or 1 ish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in an older S-10 pickup with a camper
shell, a friend and i were in the back and my other 2 friends were in the front
cab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we had just gotten to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">peak</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Turnbull</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> canyon coming down toward
whitter direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Note this canyon is
very dark, and has many turns.) Well what happened was we were all looking out
the front windshield and we had perfect view of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When all of the sudden, the road turned to
dirt and veered to the right. Luckily my friend who was driving at the time,
slammed on his brakes, hard enough to throw all of us in a foward motion and
when we all looked backup, the road was back to pavement and going straight
instead of a turn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all decided to get
out and take a look for ourselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
we got out we saw that if my friend would of made that hard right we would of
veered off the canyon into the revine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we were looking around trying to figure out what happened we looked
into the bottom of the canyon and saw small camp like fires and saw 2 black
figures about 35 yards back from where we just passed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all freaked out and got back in the car
and made a dash for <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">whittier</st1:City></st1:place>
and took the freeway back home.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was always very close with my Uncle Paul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were like brother and sister with only 10
years between our ages.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I was
little Paulie was always scaring me by pulling pranks like grabbing my leg
through the banister<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when I would walk
down the steps and telling me about ghosts hiding in my closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In April 1999 he died suddenly at the age of
56.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was devastated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never got to say goodbye to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night the stereo in the living room came
on at 3 a.m. blaring music.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
asleep for hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nobody else
in the house except for me and my husband, Howie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went downstairs and shut it off.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A few months later this other thing happened
and it turned my husband into a believer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have three sm<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
dogs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two females and a male. Howie went
up to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was downstairs cleaning up
by dusting the furniture and doing some things in the kitchen. I kept hearing
this hisssing noise and fin<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y my
curiosity got the best of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked
into the h<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>way and yelled to my
husband "Are you running water, are you shaving?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he was in bed and had been for
awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard the hissing noise again
only it was right behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I froze,
and I mean froze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned around and
the duster spray can was spraying ever so slowly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked it out and thought the nozzle was
stuck but it wasn't that kind of a can with a nozzle sticking up .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had a large lever you press on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I examined it and put it back down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started up the steps and it went off
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran upstairs screaming and got
Howie to come downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought I
was nuts!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, he was barefoot and
stood in the living room near the can and accused my dog Muffin of peeing on
the carpet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said it was cold and wet
and the dog did it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got paper towels
and went to blot up where he said and there was nothing there. The capet was
bone dry and I asked him where the dog peed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said right it was wet right there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told him to feel the carpet, that it was dry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no wet spot anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just then the spray can went off again only
this time louder and longer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I freaked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He just looked at it and then at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realized then it was my Uncle Paulie who
came to play one last trick on me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
wet spot had to be a cold spot and it was right near the can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was trying to tell him and he said he was
tired and started up the steps to bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was in front of me and when my foot hit the third step the spray can
gave three short bursts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pushed Howie
aside and tore up the steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few
nights later in a dream my uncle came to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had on sweat pants and a sweat shirt like he always loved to
wear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came to say goodbye and he
hugged me so tight, it <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> felt so
real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up crying from the
dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know in my heart of hearts it
was him with the spray can and he truly did come to say goodbye to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I belong to a very catholic family and is a tradition that
whenever a person dies you should pray for that persons soul for 9 days in a
row&#8230; so we did when my granny died. The last day we were <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>
together at the house where she used to live and while we were stood there
praying the rosary, the lights started to flash and the chairs in the living
room (where we were praying) started to move very slowly but they were moving
toward us I was so scared that I ran out of the house, I still don&#8217;t know what
happened there but even though it was more than 10 years ago, it still scares
me</p>
