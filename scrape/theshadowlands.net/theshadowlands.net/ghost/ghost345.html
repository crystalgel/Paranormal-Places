<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My name is Kami Stafford,
and I live in Blackwell, Ok. My husbands family is from here both sides, and he
grew up here his whole life! So my sister and I read the story about Hallopeter
and what happened. So me my sister and my friend go looking, and i call my
husbands aunt to ask for directions. We found the bridge, and from the new
bridge you can see where the old one was. We went out first during the day, so
we'd know where to go then again at night with more people, my husband and his
aunt and uncle mainly. We all saw the white horse, and Mr. Hallopeter grieving
for his daughter..and as we left and looked up towards the house you could see
the gramma! But while we were there I had an overwhelming sense of saddness,
and bitterness. Then i started feeling as if i couldn't get my breathe, like
something was tightening around my neck persay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My husbands Aunt made us get in the car and go back to town, and when we
got to her house (her mother in law lives with them) we told gramma ida what
happened, leaving out the part about me and not being able to breathe. She
looked me square in the eye and said, you felt the girl kill g herself, and you
couldn't breathe. That freaked me out! but she said that the Hallopeter's were
a good family, and that the dad was a very strict man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Any ways, that is our
little family encounter with the Hallopeter's and i will leave it at that it
was the family we encountered not the bridge!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thought i would share that with you, beens we live her and all and found
the "legend" that made me curious<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>on your site!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi, the story that I'm
going to tell you didn't happen to me, it had happen to my mom when she was
growing up. The house that she lived in was a house that my grandma had bought.
I guess at one time it was used a funeral home. Upstairs in the back part on
the house was the maid's room. And I guess that she had hung herself in there.
The room was always cold even in the dead of summer. You could go in there on
the hots day and that room would be cold. Mom also told that when they would be
outside they would look at the houses big picture window (that was in the
living room) they would see people cupping there hands around there eyes to
look out the window.(like you would, to see throw the window better). My
grandma would lay in bed at night and hear someone coming up the stairs and she
would count the steps they took.When they would get to the second from the last
step going up it would stop, turn and run down the steps. And she would also
hear ever thing in the house (on the first floor)turn on and be turn up as loud
as it would go. When she would go down stairs to see what was going on ever
thing would be off when she hit the bottom step. On night my aunt asked my
uncle to go upstairs to get something for her but when he got to the steps he
felt something was wrong and he didn't what to go up stairs. So that night when
they all went upstairs to bed, when my uncle went in to his room the window and
frame was taken out of the window seal. The window was sitting on the floor
next to the window seal and the screen was cut out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandma was getting pretty upset so she
had ask a couple of guys to stay in the house at night.(one guy would stay at a
time) Everyone would sleep in th e rooms and the guy would have to stay down
stairs with a load pistol in hand. and every morning they would be gone my
grandma would call them to ask why they left and both said that she was nuts
for living there. One night before bed my grandpa came over and set a trap you
might say. The window that didn't have locks on them they would put knifes in
the tops so you couldn't open them inside or out. Made sure the front door was
locked and then went in the kitchen and put flour on the floor and went though
the basement to exit the house. In the morning when he came back. The basement
door was unlocked, there was one set of foot prints in the flour,(going from
the basement door to the living room door) and all the windows and doors were
still locked. And there was no one in the house. Beside who should be. Well
that is one of the weird houses that my mom and her family have lived in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hello!. First of all I
would like to say I LOVE THIS WEBSITE!... I am a very big fan of ghost hauntings
but I'm also a big scaredy-cat. I've read the haunted places index in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, but
there seem to be more that just what's posted. I'd like to share one of 'em as
a personal experience.....<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In a town called Sta. Ana
in </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Taguig</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">City</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> about 18
years ago, there's a construction site in the public market which is between
St. Anne Church and St. Anne Public Elemantary School.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When workers go on break, kids love to play
around the site, on the gravel and sand, even on the trailer trucks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, a boy was playing around one of the
trucks while suddenly, the scooper part of the front end loader (backhoe)
tractor fell on the boy and killed him instantly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now a private residence, which is also my
uncle's house, the boy makes constant apparitions with blood all over him,
exactly the way he looked when he got crushed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is harmless though, in fact he's very friendly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My uncle and his family are
too scared to live with that, so they called on a psychic and tried to tell the
boy to go away and come into the light but the boy sadly responded, "But
all my toys are here, this is where I play, this is where I live."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he left anyway, but he still didn't go to
the light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he went across the
street to my grand aunt's house, which by the way I'm not planning on visiting
in a long while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I was in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> for a
vacation last Feb 2005, I visited the house, I didn't think it would be a very
active ghost, but my aunt had warned me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What he enjoys doing I happen to experience myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day we were all upstairs in my grand
aunt's room, not knowing somebody was ringing the door bell. We all felt
someone touch us like a calling touch, since it can't speak, just to tell us
that someone is downstairs at the door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He does that to all the maids when they can't hear the door bell, or
when something is about to fall off the counters, he warns people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He doesn't show himself<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as often as he did at the other house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I believe he will never leave this
earth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is his home, forever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I owned a Victorian house
built between 1896 and 1897 in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Bloomington</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Illinois</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, between
1985 and 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house had been built
on a subdivided estate of what had once been one of the richest men in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Bloomington</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was near the old Illinois Central
tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the mansion and the tracks
had been removed by the time I bought the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I bought it from a landlord
who had only the upper half rented out; she moved immediately upon my
purchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I moved in, I wondered
why she lived upstairs when the downstairs was obviously the nicer
quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I presumed that she liked the
view from the upstairs turret room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think now she may have been afraid of the downstairs area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I lived there, I had three
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All happened while I was
alone in the house, all during the day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a.. I was in the downstairs
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house had been split into a
duplex at some point; I lived in the whole house except for the first 6 months
when I had a downstairs renter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she
moved out, I took over the whole house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had my newly acquired puppy in the kitchen with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was working at the counter and turned
around and saw a puddle of liquid about the size of a dinner plate in the
middle of the kitchen floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking
the puppy was the culprit, I put him in his crate to avoid spreading the
puddle, then wiped up the puddle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
determined the puddle wasn't "piddle" while I wiped it up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I became concerned there was a problem with
plumbing and checked for signs that the water had come from the sink, but there
wasn't even a dried trail reflecting in the light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked for a leak from above, from the
refrigerater and every other direction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was just a puddle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I resumed
my kitchen work at the counter with the puppy in the crate, thinking perhaps I
had misdiagnosed the puddle and the puppy was really the origin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned around again and the puddle was
there again, same size, same place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wiped it up again, told whoever it was to stop scaring people and resumed my
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The puddle never appeared again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">b.. I had been redecorating
the downstairs in preparation for receiving furniture that had been my
mother's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had brought back my set of
ladies' golf clubs with golf bag in from the car and set them near the front
door downstairs with intent to put them away later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then went upstairs and relaxed, watching
television in my upstairs turret "family room."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While watching television, I heard a
tremendous crash and ran downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
golf clubs had been thrown across the living room to the back wall,
approximately 22 feet, both clubs and bag.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I checked both the front and back door to see if someone had entered the
house; both were locked and undisturbed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The clubs were too far away from the front door to have merely fallen or
rolled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were all against the far
wall on a carpeted floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I presumed
somehow that I was being scolded for not putting away the clubs, picked them up
and put them in the closet under the stairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">c.. My most startling experience
occurred on a sunny afternoon in the downstairs turret room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was standing in the doorway of the closet
that had been added by building a flimsy wall of paneling and sliding closet
doors (ca. 1970) against one wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
looking into the closet at the bookcase that had been built into the back of
the closet (ca. 1940) and realized that the bookcase filled what had been a
doorway betweeen that room and the dining room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was analyzing how I might remove the closet wall and expecting that it
might possibly lead to tearing out the lowered ceiling in the living room next
to it, when I realized there was someone standing next to me in the doorway on
my right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a little taller than I
am (perhaps 5'4"), slight build, light brown hair, balding, wire-rim
glasses, white shirt with elastic arm bands, and medium brown wool
trousers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was looking intently at the
bookcase as I had been and appeared as disgusted with the poor remodeling jobs
that had occurred as I was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then he
wasn't there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't say he
"vanished" because I think of TV or movie special effects that show
that as taking some amount of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
wasn't like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was there and then
he wasn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw him again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The entire time I lived
there, I never felt threatened by this, only curious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sold the house in 1991 after moving to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">California</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

like to share with you an experience I had a couple of years ago. The encounter
was brief, but intense for me. I still find myself trembling when recounting
this story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Let me first give you a
little background on me. When I was fairly young, 4-7 years old, I was troubled
by what I now believe was a poltergeist. Every night, my parents would put me
and my sister to bed in our second floor bedroom. And every night I was
consistently harassed by a "fly" buzzing my ear. I never SAW the fly.
I only heard it. I would pull the blankets up or try covering my head with a pillow.
Nothing lessened the volume of the sound I heard. It happened winter, summer,
spring and fall. My parents would come into our room over and over; assuring me
that there was no fly in the room. They even armed me with a can of "yard
guard" for my childish protection. Nothing helped. My sister who shared
the same bedroom was never bothered by the fly. And on the rare occasion I
could talk her into sleeping with me or allowing me to sleep in her bed with
her, I had a restful nights sleep with no buzzing. This went on until we moved
into a new house when I was about 7-8 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On the night of the
experience I would like to relate to you, my husband and I had decided to stop
off at the video rental place on our way home one night. Now, I have to confess
up front, I hate going to the video store. Its always a long and tedious
adventure. So I usually stay in the car and wait. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The store is located in on
a main road that has lots of traffic. It was around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="18"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">6:00</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> or so on a weeknight. We pulled into the lot and
parked facing the front of the building. My husband went inside and I just
kicked back to relax. I love people watching, so I occupied myself with my
normal wonderings about the people coming to and from the video store that
night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was sitting in the
passengers seat, facing the store when a reflection in the side view mirror of
my van caught my eye. It was a young man, around 16-18. He wore a white t-shirt
with some type of black picture or symbol on it. He had short blond hair that
was longer in the front. He was walking toward my vehicle from the rear. I have
three teenage children so I am used to kids coming up to me to say hello or
enquire what my kids are doing that particular night and such. I did not
recognize this boy as a friend of any of my children. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Now, I know you all have
had this feeling at one time or another. You KNOW when someone is walking
toward you and is about to speak to you? Somehow your senses let you know this
person is going to engage you in some type of conversation. Be it short or
long. At this point I was still watching him in my side view mirror. Well, I
just had a feeling that this young man walking towards my car door was about to
say something to me. He looked as if he needed to ask me a question. I was
expecting him to say something like "do you know what time it is?" So
to be friendly and seem approachable, I turned to speak to him. I could still
see him coming towards my car in the mirror. But as I turned to speak to him
face to face, there was no one there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I leaned out of my car to
look around, nothing. I began to get a little freaked out that someone was
going to pop up and carjack me or something. I opened my car door and jumped
out, nothing. I ran around the rear of my car to see if he had ducked down
behind it, nothing. Around to the other sidenothing. I was really frightened
now and I began to cry. I made it quickly to the front door of the store, still
looking around frantically for this young man I had just seen. There was no
sign of him anywhere. I stood there a couple minutes just inside the door
watching the parking lot. He never reappeared. The entire front of this
building is windows, yet no one seemed to have seen what I had seen. I was
trembling so hard by this time; I could barely make my way through the store to
find my husband. He took one look at me and asked what was wrong. I told him
"I dont want to tell you. Youll think I am nuts". I finally calmed
down enough to let him know what had just happened. Although he tried, he had
no comforting words for me. What could he say, really?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was sill tearful and
shaky when I got home. My middle daughter asked me immediately what was wrong
and I told her the story. She looked at me with wide eyes and said "MOM!
That is the intersection where KC was killed last year". KC was a boy that
was from the neighboring school district that had been killed in an auto
accident right in front of that video store the year before. We did not know
this boy and I do not know what he looks like. I am not saying it was him. What
I DO know is that someone who is not of this world needed to ask me a question
that night and either changed his mind or was frightened off when I turned to
face him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">To this day I wonder what
he wanted to say..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My family moved into a
house about five years ago. We bought it from a lady whos husband had just died
on the property. It was quiet for the first year but then it started to get
strange. The big moments that i can remeber vary but still scared me all the
same. I think my first expericence was one night i had just gotten in to bed
and was about to fall asleep when i sat up suddenly and screamed bloody murder
for my mom. She should have been able to hear me because both of my bedroom
doors were slightly open. But there was this barrier type thing in front of me
and like absorbed the sound. It went away after abit an i went to sleep.
Another time i was sleeping and i remember being like shaken awake but
something and then i gasped and relized that my blankets were wrapped around my
neck then then completely covered my head then around my neck again. I of
course panicked and i couldnt get my head free then all of a sudden they were
like unwrapped and lifted off my head and lied next to me and i felt something
like brush my cheek and then dissappear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My cousin also has felt the presence of the spirt i assume is the guy
how died here for reasons i will explain later. We were home alone on summer
break when for some reason we both look at my moms door and see the knob turn
and the door open and slam shut. We investagated and the windows were closed
and nuthin was in the room except is was very cold and our house does not
contain A/C. Alrite the reason why we believe that the spirt is the gentleman
who died here is because he had his heart attack after cuttin the lawn on his
ride on lawn mower. From that day forward every ride on mower has stopped
workin and nothing is wrong with them and they always stop working in the same
spot. Lately nothing big has been happening except for the water in the bath
room sink turns on hot full blast and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>steams and no one has touched it all say when it happens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I just read a short article
on your site about animal ghosts. I found it very interesting that the majority
of reports had to do with pets visiting owners or poeple seeing spirits that
they didn't know but seemed to be evil in some way. I just moved to an old farm
a few years ago and the first time I went walking up to the barn I was overcome
by a sickness in my gut and an overwhelming sence of fear. Before I reached the
barn doors these feelings were so very strong that I turned on my heel and ran
full speed back to the house. My father looked over at me and asked what was the
matter. I looked up and plainly said to him "Someone died at the barn. I
can feel it!" He told me what he knew of the history of the place and it
was in the same family for generations. In fact the last generaltion to live on
the property was still alive and well in the town. But I was certain that there
had been a murder in that barn. So I did some research and it turns out that in
a way there was a murder. It was a bull. The previous owners (not members of
the original family) had a bull at pasture there but there was a drought and
they didn't feed him well to make up for the poor grazing. One day they decided
that the bull had become too mean, as animals tend to do when starved. Even a
human will turn mean from starvation. So, they decided to have the bull
butchered but couldn't manage to ship him to the butcher's. What they did
instead was corner him in the barn and bludgen him to death with boards and
bats that they had handy. Evidently none of them could manage a gun. I never
saw this spirit, but I did feel him and he seemed to call out in fear. It was
like he was so scared when he died that he didn't know where to go next. So I
went to the barn with some fresh hay and some flowers that I picked along the
way and i layed these things down and I simply talked to him. I just sort of
talked to the air in the same manner that I would talk to any animal and after
a few minutes, the sickness in my gut started to fade. Then before I knew it,
the air was clear as if no one was ever scared there at all. He was never a pet
for any one and he wasn't at all evil, but I'm sure he had a soul, and now he
seems to be at rest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there was a little girl and
a little boy that would only play with the children the adults could not see
them and after i turned 13 i couldnt see them anymore either but other things i
did see such as things being thrown at us from across the room and looking in
the bathroom mirror was the scariest thing to me you would often see some thing
or someone else staring back at you everytime we had a pet it would just die
and we couldnt figure out why and if we put a battary in a clock it would pop
and the battary acid would run down the wall and by the time i turned 14 being
a female i started my period and it seemed as all hell broke loose in that
house windows would shake it was always cold and doors would just slam i
researched the house and found it was built in 1923 and 2 children a boy and a
girl lived there and the girl had died from polio i never found out anything
about the boy but from my experiance they were both still there along with
other things i am scared to speak of we moved shortly after i turned 14 and
since then no one has owned the house for very long someone will buy it and
then sell i within a year i have kindof kept an eye on the house since we moved
and had earges to go back inside when i drive by it but i am to afraid of what
will happen to me if i do i have had years of bad dreams of what had happened
there and sometimes i can still sense the little girl being close by me she
never caused me any harm but seemed to warn me of things to come and sometimes
she still warns me by just a simple flicker of a light sounds strange i know
but this is something that not only have i experianced but only a few has
spoken of and of the ones that seem to be to scared to speak i know why<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>We had <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bought the house from my
Great Aunt and Uncle who told us the story of <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an orchard fro the first half of the
century (we have <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">an apple tree in our yard
that is well over 120 years old).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">second world war, the land
was purchased and subdivided. The house we <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bought was the one that the
developer lived in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Great Aunt <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">purchased the house years
after the developer had died, supposedly, and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">this seems straight out of
a bad comedy, by drowning in his breakfast <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">after suffering a heart
attack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">She said she had
experienced some strange things, but mostly as she and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">her new husband were
redecorating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The developer's wife had
lived for <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">some time in the house and
according to my Aunt was a little strange.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In the basement, which at
the time was completely unframed and open, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the developer's wife had a
toilet installed roughly in the middle of <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Initially we noticed
nothing strange, but a few months later our cat <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">began to act
strangely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would seem to stare into
certain corners <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and down the hall into the
dining room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had always joked the he
was <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">seeing the "permanent
resident". But then some strange things started <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to happen, all benign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lights turning on and off, books being moved <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">around, doors closing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then one day the ghost
really got my attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was designing
a <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">model sailing ship in my
office, my desk was covered with papers and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">books and various
schematics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was working when I turned
my chair <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">around to look up something
on the internet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had just begun my <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">search when felt this
strange feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then all of the papers
on the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">table were thrown
about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like a windstorm had
erupted in this <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">small room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The books began to fall on the floor until
the table was <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">almost clear of everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I slowly got up and left to room and did <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">not go back in there from
some time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then everything was quite
for about two years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the cat did
not <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">seem to notice anything.
Then one day I was watching a show on <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Chillingham castle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the show, I got up and whent to the
kitchen <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to get something to
drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very late so I left the
light on to <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">make sure that I did not
trip on my way back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pored a glass of
water <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and herd some strange
noises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked back and noticed that
the light <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was off and the TV was back
on and turned to a different channel, on <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">which in one half hour,
there was a show on EVP. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

Here" <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">By: Anonymous<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As an update to the story
"Dad's still Here".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to
spend the weekend with my Mom a month after my Father's passing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me the strangest story, and if I
didn't know my Mother, I would think she had imagined it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my Mom is about the most practical,
unflappable person I know; and isn't taken to flights of fancy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My Mother has a bone
disease that causes her pain when she lays down for too long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, she usually ends up sleeping for
a few hours and then moves to a recliner in the living room for the balance of
the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several times over the month
following my Father's death, she had moved out to the living room around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">3:00 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After 50 years of marriage, she was having a hard time adjusting to
Dad's death, and would spend the next hour crying and missing him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at these times, that she would suddenly
smell Dove soap in the living room and feel a definite chill in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My Mother's house is always
kept around 73 degrees in temperature since the cold aggravates her
condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also do not use Dove soap
or anything that smells like it in my Mother's house since she doesn't like the
perfumey smell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when my Father
was ill, the hospice nurses would bath him with Dove soap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have no explanation, but
when my Mother talked to the funeral director and hospice about what she was
experiencing, they both felt that it was my Father trying to reassure my Mother
that he was still with her and always would be.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We also have pictures taken
at that last Christmas that show my Father in his hospice bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In every picture showing my Father, there is
a white, shadowy image that looks like an angel standing behind my father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The image is not distinct, but you get a
sense of wings and robes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have tried
to recreate the pictures using different lightings and settings, and have not
been able to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, we have no
explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I, myself, do not think
that Dad is a 'ghost' in the sense of staying behind for unfinished
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I prefer to think that he has
become a Guardian Angel doing what he always did, looking after his family in a
way where his deteriorating strength will no longer interfere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have always believed in
the paranormal and study metaphysics.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, I never thought I could be a party to a paranormal experience..
for you see, it happens to others....not me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was always been a joke with me....a ghost could shake my hand and I
would be oblivious to it being a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And what was experienced, the joke has more truth then fiction to
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And to this day, I still
wonder....was this all real or was it just a whole lot of coincidences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being this experience traversed over the
course of approximately 6 months, I will try to condense it as much as
possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When my two boys were both
a few months shy of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4 and 10, the three
of us moved from an apartment into a small two bedroom house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We loved being in a house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in a good neighborhood, close to a
park, the elementary school and we had a nice landlady.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I put the boys in the master bedroom so they
could have more room, while I look the smaller room for myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Within a few months of
moving into this house, my youngest started talking about a new friend he had
made who also lived in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
told many children in this age bracket have imaginary friends and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>usually out grow the friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, I engaged Randall with conversation
about his friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked what his
friend's name was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He replied
with......"I dunno, but I call him the Little Monster."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was a little miffed at this but continued
on with,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>why the little monster?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because, he says, his arms, hands and feet
look like this, as he tried to bend and contort his arms and hands.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then his eyes got big as saucers and
says....but he drives a car!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Okeeee...
this child was verbose and articulate at a very early age, and with this
imagination, he is going to be a novelist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He told me his friend wants to play with his hot wheels most of the
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he continues, I get tired of
playing cars so I color or play with something else while he plays with my
cars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also added, the Little Monster
likes to watch TV....and specially likes </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sesame
  Street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Another question, was when other friends come over, do they play with
the Little Monster?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nooo, he says,
because he doesn't like other kids so doesn't come out of the closet....he only
wants to play with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, he lives in
the closet, I ask?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No, he says,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>don't know where he lives but when he goes
home, he just disappears.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When other
kids come over, he hides in the closet until they leave.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I asked him if he took his friend with us
when we went places and his response was kind of odd:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No, because he cannot go outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want him to play outside but he says he
cannot.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Little Monster says he use
to go outside in his car a long time ago but cannot do that anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My closest friend, on the
other hand, had a different take on the "imaginary"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>friend.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>During one visit to my home, she swore she saw a young child on what she
thought was a big wheels bike in the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said the child stopped at the entrance into the living room, then
moved on into the boy's room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she
got up to investigate, she found nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another time, while my boys were in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Arizona</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> for a few
days, she said she kept hearing a child's crying from the boy's bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For some reason, I felt like I had to tell
her about something odd the night before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The owner of the house had stopped by for a visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She use to do this periodically for no
specific reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had walked her out to
her car she had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>parked on my driveway
which under one of the living room windows.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we talked, I heard a young child's crying coming from the one window
and then:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Mommy, don't
go."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It caught my attention because
it was from my window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carmen
said....THERE is a young child living in this house and that child isn't of the
living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dismissed her thinking the
voice had actually come from another house....it was quiet in the neighborhood
and sounds can be misleading and if I knew she was going to get this worked up,
I wouldn't have said anything.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But I could
not shake off how strange I felt hearing that voice.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still, there were no bumps or thumps in the
night, footsteps, doors opening and closing,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>lights going on and off, vapors, shadows, etc., etc., all things of
which I associated with a paranormal experience.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I said....paranormal experiences just
don't happen to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
words...."suit yourself."<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One day Jason came to me
and said....Randall keeps turning on the television at night and it keeps me
awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I asked Randall why he was
turning it on and he said...because the Little Monster wants to watch TV and he
cannot turn it on so he asks me to turn it on for him.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I told Randall,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>you have to tell the Little Monster we have
rules in this house, and one of those rules is we do not watch television after
9:00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he wants to come and play with
you, he has to abide by my rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In the middle of that night
there was a loud thump from the boys room which shook the entire house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both of<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the boys started screaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
down the hall in a flash, running into Jason who was yelling about the Little
Monster...... I ran into the bedroom, Randall was sitting in the middle of the
floor crying and with one swoop, had him out of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got both boys into my bed and after what
seemed forever, had them calmed down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The story came out that the Little Monster wanted the television turned
on but Randall said he couldn't because his mom said no.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not a whole lot is known about what happened
next and I don't think I really ever want to know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as Randall put it....he threw a
tempertandrum....(how he pronounced it).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So now it is time to get to
the bottom of this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something is going
on and my children are involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
girlfriend and I approached the owner of the house and after a whole lot of
coaxing....the story comes out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had
a child named Bobby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bobby suffered from
a muscular disease and was crippled, his joints were swollen, and his limbs
were distorted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He endured so much pain
he cried constantly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said her
husband (who was a sob), didn't think he needed to be in a hospital because of
the medical costs, plus he was hardly ever home to hear the child's cries
(working or drinking in the bars).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
night, she couldn't endure any more, went into the bathroom and asked God to
take her son because she could not deal with his constant crying any more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died a few days later, at the age of
4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could feel a chill starting to seep
through out my entire body.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She always
felt guilty that she was not strong enough to help her child and instead, asked
for his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The night he died and
after the child was taken out of the house, her husband found the life
insurance papers he had on the child, told her to pack some clothes, and they
left the house...moving into a motel until they purchased another home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she couldn't give up the house and
decided to make it into a rental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The next question
was....did you ever tell either one of my boys this story?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer was no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I asked her if Bobby liked to play with
cars?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked at me very oddly and
said...he loved cars....so much so that one of the neighbors constructed
something which fit over Bobby's wheelchair making it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>look like a car.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was frozen to my chair and couldn't utter
a word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My entire body was now chilled
to the bone.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And so we commenced to
relay the experiences of the past months.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The time has come to let
Bobby go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps through the guilt of
this poor woman, she had kept her son earthbound and he not able to move
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We asked her if she would go into the
house and talk with Bobby telling him it is ok to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she couldn't do it....she had
already hurt him enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So my
girlfriend told me I would have to do it myself....as mother to Randall and
Jason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into the boy's
room....staying in there for an hour just talking with Bobby....telling him his
mother loved him very much but he is free to leave and his mother
understands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had only wanted what
was best for him and to no longer feel the pain from what was crippling
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also told him I loved my boys
more then anything but Randall especially, and he did not live on the same
plane of existence and Randall would grow up, and leave him behind.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We changed the bedrooms around, moving the
boys into the smaller room, while I took the master room.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Randall never had any more contact with the
Little Monster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something we had never
noticed before, but<span style="">&nbsp; </span>our cat, Licorice
would never go into the boys room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
afterwards,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her favorite spot was lying
in the window warming herself with the sun.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Both of my boys are now grown men and their memories of the experience
are vague to gray.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">But there is one thing that
to this day lurks in the back of my mind and I cannot shake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the time Randall was playing with
Bobby, one day he came to me saying his "friend" had another friend
who wanted to take them both to a place where they would have fun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This DID get my attention and I told
Randall...you know the rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You NEVER go anyplace with anyone I do not
know....and B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you go, I am to know
exactly where you are going!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So my question.....who was
this other friend and where was he going to take my child??<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was a manager of the Main
Theatre in Coldwater </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. When I
would be the only one there shutting down for the night, I would hear footsteps
in the ceiling above the main auditorium. One time, I went through my normal
routine of straitening up the 150 seats from the lounge position to the strait
position in the main auditorium, and then went upstairs to complete my
paperwork. I came down 15 minutes later and all of the seats were changed back
to the lounge position. I stood there and then I heard what seemed to be
whispering voices and then a cold breeze on my neck. From then on, I did all of
the work in the auditoriums with all of the house lights on and never stood
still.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">A few true stories here:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This one is not a true
'ghost' story, but something similar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">A couple of years ago, when
we had to put the dog down through illness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was watching him before
and after the vet injected him. For a few seconds he was OK, then I could see
in his eyes that he was fighting something, fighting to keep his eyes open,
slowly he gave every 'inch' of the way. His eyes slowly rolled up, quicker back
down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There was nothing for a
very short period, maybe a few seconds. Then this really intense energy
appeared from nowhere (the door and window were shut - no way in or out) It
seemed to swirl around the room. Then as suddenly as it had 'appeared', it
vanished...I've never felt anything like that before or since.I did ask my mum
later if she felt anything, she said no (because I suspected a possibility of
grief energy being emitted from her). I am certain in didn't come from me. Vets
characteristically don't give two hoots and this one didn't seem to notice
anything. Mum also said she did not know what the exact point when he (the dog)
died was. The 'energy' felt strange - not like hot or cold. Just something I
can't properly explain. I did not hear, see, taste nor smell anything
siginificant at the time (that I remember). No one left or entered the room
during this time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Strange figure on the
stairs<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Other events have been:
Whilst a teenager we lived in a flat at the top of a 4 storey victorian house.
The upper part of the flat was where the old attic would have been. My bedroom
was just across the the hallway at the bottom of the stairs. The hallway was
always gloomy near the stairs and there were doorways leading to other rooms.
The bathroom was off the landing at the top of the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I had got up in the middle
of the night to go to the bathroom (lavatory). I had been nervy about the
alcove ever since we moved in and leapt quickly toward the stairs to avoid it.
I had left the door open and whilst 'going', felt that someone was on the
landing was nearby. I didn't like the feeling, so without turning shut the
door. I now didn't know quite what to do as I was 'stuck' in the bathroom. All
other rooms meant I had to go over the landing, either my parents room or mine
downstairs. I thought I couldn't really spend the rest of the night hiding in
the bathroom with the light on, so I gathered courage and quickly opened the
door, which thankfully revealed nothing. (The bathroom has one of those
pull-cord light switches and I held on as long as I could keep the light on as
all other light switches were (typically) in the wrong direction) I was trying
to go as quickly as possible down the stairs without falling. About mid-way I
felt an urge to turn around, which unfortunately I did. At the top of the
stairs was a strange 'glowing' white figure (at least phosphorescent). It (I
got the impression it was a woman) was just standing there seemingly holding
onto the banister. I was horrified - I don't know how long I gazed at it for -
I just didn't like it. Turning and never looking back, I practically ran down
the remaining stairs across the hall, into my room, turned the light on, shut
the door and leant against it. Initially it felt like something/someone was now
outside my bedroom door. I don't know how long I stood there waiting for the
feeling to pass. I spend the rest of the night sat up with the light on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The following morning I
asked anyone if they had got up in the night and stood atop the stairs. No-one
had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was much relieved when we
moved out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">NB: Only the figure
appeared to be 'lit up', not the immediate vicinity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">House-buying<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Another time was when
viewing a house which we were possibly buying (until I went in it) only myself
and my mother were viewing the house at the time (no agents).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This house was in the same
town as the second story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Another older house (not
sure how old). Looked fine from the outside, quite pleasant, nothing out of the
ordinary. As soon as I stepped into the house, I immediately felt someone was
watching (the furniture had been removed, so was pretty much empty). Through
the hallway into the kitchen (which had a very high ceiling - I'm nearly 2
metres high, so probably up to 4 metres or so) it seems that something/someone
was in the corner of the ceiling looking down at us. Basically got the same
pervading feeling throughout the house, until we had reached the top floor. It
was only on the landing (of the top floor) where the feeling was strongest.
There was only one room up there, which oddly had less of a feeling than the
landing. Cut a long story short - strange 'watching' feeling throughout walking
around an empty house, with small one area exhibiting more energy than
elsewhere. Curiously upon leaving I asked my mother whether she felt anything -
"no, what sort of feeling?" came the reply. Strangely enough though,
I mentioned about this house to my brother and his then wife (unknown to us,
they had viewed the house as well) to which she claimed to have felt the same
feeling. However my brother felt nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Perhaps (it was) a former
resident, conducting an 'interview'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Apologies for all the
brackets, any bad grammar etc etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I LOVE this site. Here is
one of my stories...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was about 6-7 years of
age (25 years ago). I was living with my grandparents along with my father
because my parents were going thru a terrible divorce. I was afraid of open
closets so I ALWAYS made sure the closet door was closed before I went to bed
at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I woke up to a
flashing light. My night light (virgin Mary lamp) was going on and off. The
next thing I knew the blankets on my bed started to ripple. Starting from the
foot of the bed to the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>blankets that I
was clutching in my hands. The blankets then flew off the bed. I looked over at
my closet and the door was slid all the way open. There standing in my closet
was a boy. He looked like he was about 10 years of age. He had red curly hair,
short ripped pants, open front shirt and no shoes on his feet. He reminded me

came in the room. She did not see him. She said I was just dreaming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Wow. Where do I begin. Like
I stated in my first<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">email, I worked third shift
which was </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="23"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11pm - 9 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Thursday's to Sunday's. I
was considered part time. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">don't know if you have ever
been in the lobby of the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hotel, but if you have,
then you know of the revolving<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">door. Very old. Extremely
heavy. I would be working at<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the front desk and the
revolving door would just start<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">spinning, of course I would
always walk over to it to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">make sure no one was there
and there never was anyone<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there. Once the hotel was
done being built, Colonel<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Baker lived in the hotel in
room # 504 ( The Baker<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Suite ), about 7 months
after I started working there,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">mid November, I was in the
lounge watching tv about<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">4:00am, when the picture of
Colonel Baker ( Which was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">screwed in the wall so it
didn't fall ) started to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">spin as if there was no
screws in it. I looked at the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">picture and said
"Don't worry Mr. B. I wont let<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">anything happen to your
hotel" and then the picture<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stopped spinning and went
back to normal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On a Saturday night, after
a wedding in the hotel, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">after all of the banquet
staff left, I made my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">security round to make sure
all of the doors were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">locked in the rainbow room,
and as soon as I walked in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the room, all the lights
went out and the dance floor<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">lights came on and the song
"Rock a bye baby" started<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">playing about four feet in
front of me. I later found<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">out that this was the
Colonel's favorite song, through<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">researching done at the St
Charles Library.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The lobby of the hotel has
old marble floor, so when<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">some one is walking you are
able to hear there shoes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I would be working in the
back office and hear<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">footsteps, and go to the
front to see, and no one<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">would be there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">While I was employed there,
the hotels liquor room was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">broken into. I had received
a call from a guest room<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">saying that they heard loud
bangs and the sound of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">glass breaking coming from
under there floor. Well the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">guests that called were on
the 2nd floor. The 1st<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">floor was the lobby area.
The liquor room was in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">basement of the hotel. So I
called the police and once<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the police arrived, we went
down stairs to the storage<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">room and saw that the cage
door ( With a dead bold<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">lock ) on it was still in
tack. Meaning that some one<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">had to be very skinny as
the police said to crawl<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">under the cage, which was
about 2 inches above the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">ground, while we where
looking at the cage, the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bottles of liquor started
to lift off the shelf, make<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a complete turn in the air
and fall straight to the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">ground. The police officer
and I were in complete<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">shock while this was
happening. He took photos with<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">his camera that he had and
so did I ( Both cameras<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">were Polaroids ), once we
gave the pictures about 10<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">minutes to dry ( Set ) we
looked at them and they were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">completely black. Like we
took pics of the dark sky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After we left the basement,
the officer was telling me<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that he had responded to a
call while the hotel was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">closed ( Due to the
previous owners going bankrupt )<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that the lights in the
hotel were flashing. The hotel<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was closed for three years.
When the police arrived at<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the hotel to check out the
call, they checked the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">whole hotel and found that
the power in the hotel did<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">not work ( was not turned
on due to the hotel being<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">closed ) and said that
everything was clear, so they<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">went outside to get in
there cars and leave, when one<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of the officers spotted a
light on in the hotel. Once<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">he told the other officers
to look, all of the lights,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">in all 26 rooms that faced
route 64 ( </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">North Ave.</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> )<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">were all on and flashing.
Now call me a spectic, But I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">don't see why a police
officer would lie about<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">something like this. What
are they going to gain from<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The hotel had five floors
that the elevator went to,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">plus the penthouse which
was accessed by a staircase<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">on the fifth floor, and the
basement. For some reason,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">whenever the hotel's front
desk staff would assign a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">room on the second floor,
the guests ( Many different<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">guests ) would always say
that while they were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sleeping they felt some one
get into bed with them and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">rub their back. This only
happened on the second<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">floor, don't know why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I found your web site very
interesting!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made me remember back in

  Huntington Ave.</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was originally built by Mr. Post, one of the first presidents of the
shipyard down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many strange
occurences have happened there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There were always footsteps
that seemed to be coming towards you, then they would stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could hear doors creaking, as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night, my mother was checking on us to
make sure we were tucked in and sleeping soundly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went down the back steps to the kitchen
and found the mirror at the bottom of the steps broken and a hammer amidst the
shards of glass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was very alarmed
and called the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found no
signs of forced entry and no strange footprints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody had heard the glass breaking, either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There was one room that was
always cold, no matter how warm the rest of the house was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would hold seances in there to try to
bring back Mr. Post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The candle we used
would go out and sometimes we were not able to re-light it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The strangest thing was
when I was home sick from school one day and my two younger sisters were with
me in the TV room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were the only ones
in the house and had closed the doors to the room as we watched TV during the
afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my brother got home from
school, he rang the doorbell to get in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I opened the door to the front hallway,
the desk sitting there was overturned and all the trinkets, etc that were
adorning it were neatly laid out on the floor in front of the desk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legs of the desk were intact, so it was
not an accident!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I am still
haunted to this day by one or more of these ghosts!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Let me know if you would
like additional information regarding this house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Im only 16 years old but
wen i was in grade 3 my family and i lived in a house in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">edmonton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">alberta</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. It was a
4 plex and our landlords lived in th back. My mother and the lady of the house,
were good friends and so they were having tea at her house. I guess she wanted
to talk about something i shouldnt hear and so she sent me on a pointless
mission to get her a glass of pop. There were two ways to enter my house, one
being the side door, and the other being the front. Well i entered my house
through the side door, went to the kitchen and poured the glass of pop. For
some reason i decided to exit my house through the front door. To get to the
front door i had to pass my mothers bedroom. While walking down the hall i saw
something in my her room , so i stopped in front of the door, and there
standing on her bed was a women in a long black dress, almost prom like. she
was standing bare foot with her arms at her side. She had short black hair and
was just standing on my mothers bed. I didnt wait much longer until booking it
out of the house. Since then i had told my self that i was jus seeing things ,
but reciently my mother was talking about all the haunted houses we have lived
in , and then mentioned this same house. i asked her what she had seen and she
said that one day wen doing laundry she entered the laundry room , and in the
corner was a younger women .. i asked her to describe this women for me , and
she had the exact same description as i had saw. This i can say brought about
goose bumbs the size of mini hills. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The other confusing and
kind of scary thing with this house is that in my sisters room there was a
cabniet in the wall. It was almost a little room , but it was located about a
meter off the floor. During the day we would play dolls and such in it , but at
night my sister would throw HUGE temper tandrums! Throwing herself to the
ground. My mom didnt think much of it , but wen she would do this my mom would
put her into her room , and hold the door shut. This would then make my sister
FREAK out to even greater extents!, Now thinking back to it, realising that me
and my mother had saw the same thing, it makes us think that mayybe my sisters
temper tandrums wernt really her just acting out but instead maybe she saw
something ,... something she didnt like. I have many stories like this , all throughout
my childhood. Even though i am still a child there are soo many
"happenings" surrounding myself and my sister , it frightens even
me...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Not too long ago I sent a
story in about an experience I had in my parents basement. That experience
happend while my husband I were waiting for our house to be finished. Well, my
husband and I are finally in our new house. The new sub-division we decided to
build on is near a bird and wildlife reservation. Its out and away from
everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Anyway...we have two
bathrooms in our home. One is in our master and the other in on the otherside
of the house next to the other two bedrooms. For the 1 week straight after we
fully moved in, something small, but strange started to happen. My comb would
come up missing out of the master bathroom and appear under the sink in the
other bathroom. There is no reason why it would be there. My husband and I
don't use that bathroom to get ready in.....we have our own bathroom right next
to our room. To make sure, I even asked my husband and he couldn't explain why
my comb would be under the sink in the other bathroom. Well, after I found it
the first time, I remember putting it back in my master bathroom drawer and
checked on it several times before I went to bed. But surely enough for 1 week
straight, every morning, my comb would appear in the other bathroom. After that
1 week it stopped and hasn't happend again. But last night was something that
disturbed me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I woke in the early hours
of the morning to the sound of our black lab growling from the side of our bed.
Not long after I awoke to his growling, I smelled the most digusting smell ever
in our room. I can't describe the smell, but trust me...it was very disturbing.
My husband, of course, was fast asleep and unaware of the dog and the stench in
our room. I didn't see anything because I buried my face in the covers to get
away from that smell. As soon as our black lab stopped growling, the smell went
away. I dozed off till my alarm went off. I didn't think anything of it till on
my way to work. I wonder if we have company in our new house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The most recent was a new nursing assistant who<span style="">&nbsp; </span>saw a lady with a walker with a basket of
flowers on her walker. This was on the evening shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went down the hall to see if she could
help the lady who was wandering and when she got to the end of the hall she
could not find the lady with the walker.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She went and told her nurse and asked who the lady was that she saw. The
nurse asked the aide to describe the lady she saw and it was the perfect
description of a resident who had passed away several months before this aide
started working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have had many
stories from employees sighting past residents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all believe the stories are true and that the past spirits of our
residents wander the halls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have had a lot of
experiences with spirits and ghosts, even though I'm only 11 years old. One
night when I was laying in my bedroom trying to go to sleep, someone moved my
chair and started typing on my computer. (my computer was turned off too!)
About a week later I heard a baby screaming and crying drastically. I always
see white figures running through the hallway, and one time my younger brother
who is now 9<span style="">&nbsp; </span>years old said that he went
downstairs about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="5"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">5:00 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">..and a
big man with a hat on was standing at the end of our stairs. My brother ran
through him and woke my mom up, but she did not see anything. One day while I
was home alone, talking to one of my best friends, I saw a woman in a apron and
faded gray shirt, with her hair up in a bun, she also had glasses on. My
grandmother died 2 days after my birthday, and when she did I got an Indian
doll from her. She loved Indians, and she told me that when she was very sick,
lying in her bed, an Indian was next to her, watching over her. She started
hearing footsteps yup and down her stairs. Then we found out that when she
bought the house, it was property of an Indian graveyard. One night, I was
talking to my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>aunt on the phone, in my
mom and dad's bedroom, and the television turned on!! I was the only one
upstairs, and I ran down stairs and told my dad, he said the same thing
happened to him in the middle of the night! This never happens when I'm with
the whole family, but it happens to me a lot!<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hello!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have often visited your
website, but this is the first time I have told anyone about these experiences.
My name is Kris and I am 17 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The first experience is one
that happened to me in my bedroom one night as I dozed in and out of sleep.
About the third time that I jerked awake, I heard a sound. I looked over to see
the controller to my PS2 console dragging across the floor by an unseen force.
I thought that it might only be a trick of my mind at first (well, I was hoping
that was all it was. I knew better!), but even after I'd sat up it continued to
be pulled across the floor. I was immediately frightened and I threw on the
lamp light beside my bed, but it stopped as I did this. I must have sat there
for ten minutes staring at it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This has been the only
strange ghostly experience in my home, other than intense feelings of being
watched. At these moments I become very uncomfortable and the hair on my body
stands up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My family is very spiritual
and open to all sorts of topis, such as ghosts, magic, psychic ability. I have
had several clairovoyant experiences during my life, but I know this was of a
different kind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The second part of this
email is about my uncle. Fairly recently he told my father about some very odd
experiences in his home. My uncle is a very serious, quiet, religious man and
he was only reassured into telling my father about this after my father
happened to mention a book about psychic ability. This left my uncle feeling
that my father wouldn't judge him and that he would be receptive to the idea of
ghosts or a poltergeist. I'll quit babbling now and tell you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Every night when my uncle
and his wife are in bed, trying to sleep, they hear stampeding and other loud noises
in the living room. Once my uncle set his guitar on a table there and left the
room, but when he returned the guitar had disappeared. He searched all over the
place for it, but when he came back to the living room, there it was on the
table. Another time his wife and he were in the kitchen. They had just set a
pie down in the middle of the kitchen table. Some invisible force pulled the
pie across the table and lowered it slowly to the floor. They were both
watching this in amazement. The force lifted it again and slid it back to its
spot in the middle of the table!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">An interesting thing to
note is that this is a recent appearance. He's lived in this home for a few
years with no disturbances. My uncle is a construction worker or something like
that, I know that he regularly disturbs the ground and buildings. I thought
that there might be a connection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I just wanted to share this
story, but any help or advice would be extremely appreciated! He may or may not
want to rid his home of this presence. I don't know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I worked in the biology
labs for four months as a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">biology lab assistant,
basicaly, I was there to do<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">what no one else wanted to
do, clean up, set up,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">washing dishes, whatever. I
worked late most nights,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">washing test tubes and doing
dishes from different<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">labs. I was often in the
biology labs alone at night,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the occasional public
saftey officer walked by to lock<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">up. I was there not too
late one night working, I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">putting glassware away in
the glassware closet, when I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">looked up to see a man
walking down the hallway. He<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was about my height,
5'11", slim, and elderly. He had<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">white hair on the sides,
bald on top. He was wearing a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">white lab coat over dark
slacks and a white shirt,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">black tie. He was carying a
beaker of clear liquid in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">one hand, and had a large
book in the other, with a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">dark brownish colored
bottle sitting on top of his<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">book. I thought he was one
of the Chemistry professors<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I had not met yet, I worked
in the biology labs and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">had only been there for a
little under a month. I kept<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">working, as he walked
around the corner. I came<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">accross a glass piece I had
never seen. I ran in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">direction he had gone to
ask where it went. When I got<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to the hallway he turned
on, no one was there, I tried<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the offices, all locked, no
one was around. I figured<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">he was in one and just
didnt want to be bothered. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">finished up working for the
night, watched public<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">saftey go through and lock
up, kicking me out, I left,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the following morning I was
there to finish up when<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">public safety got there to
unlock the doors, no one<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">aside from public saftey
has keys to the building. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">walk up to the glass room,
the door is unlocked and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">open already, weird but ok,
I walk to the next room to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">put the glassware I had not
finished away, it was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">gone, I walked back<span style="">&nbsp; </span>into the glassroom it was all put<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">away, clean. No one was in
the building during the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">time I left and the time I
came in. I asked my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

description I gave worked in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my
daughter moved into a house about seven years ago and right from the start we
knew something was,nt right<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">we could
smell this horrible smell like rotten cabbage and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">we even
called in the fire brigade as we thought there could be a fire they checked out
the whole house but found nothing even though they could smell the smell
too,then the light bulbe began falling out of the sockets when we walked
beneath them just missing us.My daughter had a new baby and I think it upset
whatever it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The bby
had'nt been home more than a week when the dog started barking savagely and
standing in front of the moses basket as if guarding the baby from something we
could'nt see.then one day as I was going out i turned to se a woman with blonde
hair standing on the stairs.She was smiling and she was a lovely looking woman
she wore a fifties type coat down to mid calf length woth a wide collar<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">her legs
stopped just below the hem line I could not see her ankles or feet but I knew
she was good and not evil.By this time though my daughter was terriefied and
moved out<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I often
wonder if the new tenants had seen anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>




<><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Oh and
another thing when the midwife came to see the new baby the fire surround fell
over and I had to throw myself over the baby to stop her getting harmed,I just
put that down to the fact her dad had'nt put the surrround up properly but ny
daughter told me later the fire surround had been screwed to the wall for weeks
and had been solid up<br>
till then
weird isn't it<o:p></o:p></span></>
