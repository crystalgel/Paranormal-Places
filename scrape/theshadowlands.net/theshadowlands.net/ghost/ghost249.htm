<BR><B>&nbsp;A Floating Tea-Towel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: scott_l2k44@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Im 15 now, I have not encountered a ghostly object yet since a while
ago.&nbsp; It all started like this.&nbsp; I was in my old house which
is now probably 17-19 years old now, My nan bought me a LEGO set which
included two men and a bike and helicopter.&nbsp; I was up late at night
and the only light coming through was from the street light.</B>
<BR><B>I was playing with it in the dark on my glass table.&nbsp; The table
was transparent so I could see through it completely.&nbsp; My mum woke
up and came into the kitchen and asked me what I was doing then told me
to go to bed.&nbsp; I told mum that I was hungry so she gave me something
to eat.</B>
<BR><B>After I ate the food she gave me, She and I went to bed at the same
time.&nbsp; I went to my room as she did then 5 mins. after that I came
back out and started playing with my LEGO.&nbsp; about 2 mins. after I
came back out, I noticed a WHITE TEA-TOWEL LOOKING FIGURE (TRANSPERENT)
came underneath the table and was floating at my feet.&nbsp; I was absolutely
SCARED!!&nbsp; I jumped over the table and ran into my sisters room and
awoke her.</B>
<BR><B>She woke up and asked what's wrong....a few seconds after she was
awake she saw it.. the scariest thing in my life appeared infornt of both
our eyes.&nbsp; We both gripped tight of eachother and stayed tight.&nbsp;
It was floatingat a medium pace like water but a lil' slower.</B>
<BR><B>I said these exact words "Please don't hurt me but please go away
and never come back".&nbsp; I think it worked (For about three years...)&nbsp;
About 3-4 years after that my sister and I shared a room when i was about
10-11 years old.&nbsp; Just next to the door was a little wall that had
the light switches on it.&nbsp; I saw the floating towel again just hanging
on the wall for a few small seconds that i can remember.</B>
<BR><B>About 1-2 years after that one morning....I overheard a conversation
with mum and her boyfriend while they were in bed.&nbsp; I heard something
about the taps turning on for no reason really early in the morning when
it was dark.</B>
<BR><B>The thing that really annoyed me was that mum didn't beleive me
until she started having sounds (not visions but sounds).&nbsp; She heard
alot of the time walking noises on the floor boards upsatirs from downstairs
where she was.&nbsp; That was long ago because i'm in a new house now.</B>
<BR><B>Just a few months ago in the year 2002, my mum called a phsychic
woman and the woman told mum that she will be very successful in her music
career and go to japan and europe in the future yadayada....then she started
talking about my mums dad (my grandfather).</B>
<BR><B>The woman said something about her dad is ALWAYS beside you and
he holds your hand alot of the time while you are walking, he's beside
you know sitting on a chair smoking a cigarette......etc...and then the
woman explained to mum that her dad was walking up and down the hallway
upstairs while mum was downstairs...so that explains the walking footsteps
upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listening to my most scariest thing in my life</B>

<P><B>The stories that I wanted to tell you are numerous but I'll give
you some</B>
<BR><B>of the interesting stories.</B>
<BR><B>The first one happened to me 2 years ago maybe I told you about
it</B>

so, in</B>
<BR><B>this mail I'll try to make it easier to understand what I want to
say and</B>
<BR><B>find an answer for this phenomena ok let's starts one day I was
walking</B>
<BR><B>with brother and our friend we were going to drop him to his home
his</B>
<BR><B>house wasn't far away from our house so; we've decided to walk with</B>
<BR><B>him to his home it was 9:00 p.m. as I remember when we arrived at
his</B>
<BR><B>home and after he entered his house I felt like something is coming
straight</B>
<BR><B>to us at the first time I thought it a lightning but I said how
does this happen</B>
<BR><B>if there's no cloud in the sky when I looked up it started to expand
like</B>
<BR><B>if you throw a stone into water and it looked like waves then were
not working</B>
<BR><B>so I left behind and went down stairs for five minutes and when
I returned</B>
<BR><B>it was normal I was surprised this thing didn't stop it continued
to happen</B>
<BR><B>again and again 'till I decided to sell the mobile phone with a
cheap</B>
<BR><B>price and I bought another one I see that the first thing is not
related to</B>
<BR><B>what I'm talking to but this mobile story happened after that thing.</B>
<BR><B>These are some of the stories that I wanted to give you and if you
want</B>

<P><B>Civil War Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: FROSTY76OVI@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>First off, I am a Civil War Reenactor. My Captain was a real big
Civil War buff and did everything historically accurate. He ordered a Civil
War wedding ring and gave it to his wife. A few weeks later, he awoke to
find a young girl about 20 years old walking around his room. He ignored
it and went back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>The same thing happened again a few weeks later and he thought it
was a dream so he went back to sleep. That morning, his wife's ring was
all scratched up on the inside. A few weeks later the scratches were gone
and the name Mary was inscribed. That night he awoke to find the girl roaming
his bedroom once more. He called out "Mary!" and she turned, looked at
him and disappeared.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Don't make a lot of Noise!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: karenk@engsig.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>About two years ago, my mothers boyfriend let me use his appartment
to throw</B>
<BR><B>a party. I'd never been there before but I was pretty excidet about
the</B>
<BR><B>whole thing, untill we got there that is! The appartment was in
an</B>
<BR><B>old-fashioned, aristocratic house and on the 3. floor. The minutte
I stepped</B>
<BR><B>in the door I felt like my friend and I weren't alone.I felt like
something</B>
<BR><B>was watching us all the time, something disturbing, even evil. The</B>
<BR><B>appartment eventually became full of people and I let go of the
thought,</B>
<BR><B>although I never stayed alone in a room. The next day I returned
to clean</B>
<BR><B>the place and the feeling was stronger than ever, I felt absolutely
full of</B>
<BR><B>dread. So I put on some music to keep my mind on something else,
and turned</B>
<BR><B>it up all the way. I started cleaning the room that was next to
the</B>
<BR><B>livingroom (where the stereo was) when suddently, I heard the music
turn</B>
<BR><B>off! I ran into the livingroom and saw that it wasn't turned off...the</B>
<BR><B>volume was turned all the way down and it was one of those buttons
that you</B>
<BR><B>have to litterally turn. I felt like screaming but found myself
unable to,</B>
<BR><B>and so I just finished my cleaning and never ever returned. Even
when I got</B>
<BR><B>down on the street and discovered I had forgotten my gloves- I refused
to go</B>
<BR><B>back there, eventhough it was freezing. I swear it happened, and
I can tell</B>
<BR><B>you for sure: I was never alone up there. Later on my mothers boyfriend</B>
<BR><B>would tell me that he often heard the doors slamming when he was
alone with</B>
<BR><B>no windows open...spooky!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Fear No Evil</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wyllowwynd2002@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am what one would call an emotional empath.&nbsp; For many years,
when I</B>
<BR><B>was younger, I didnt know how to shield out the emotions from the
people</B>
<BR><B>around me, nor the emotions left behind by people who had once been</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; That lead to my having an emotional breakdown, a kind
of sensory</B>
<BR><B>overload similar to having to much light in your eyes and going</B>
<BR><B>temporarily blind.&nbsp; At any rate, one of the most devastating
things that</B>
<BR><B>i experienced at that time was something that has led me to believe
very</B>
<BR><B>strongly in Places that are truly evil.</B>
<BR><B>I was about 14 at the time, and had just moved from Los Angeles
to a</B>
<BR><B>small twon in the mojave desert.&nbsp; The house we moved into was</B>
<BR><B>nondescript...........a house that was built decently but cheaply
to be</B>
<BR><B>used as a rental.&nbsp; It had 3 bedrooms and two baths, a living/dining</B>
<BR><B>combo and a smallish kitchen.&nbsp; My family consisted of myself,
my sister,</B>
<BR><B>my two brothers, and mother and stepfather.&nbsp; My sister and
I shared one</B>
<BR><B>bedroom and my brothers shared another room.&nbsp; Now, my brothers
room was</B>
<BR><B>very small..........not much bigger than a large closet.&nbsp; My
bedroom was</B>
<BR><B>on the far side of the hallway past the boys room.&nbsp; From the
first day</B>
<BR><B>we moved into that house, I feared that room.&nbsp; It was an unremarkable</B>
<BR><B>room in every visible way, just very small.&nbsp; But I feared that
room with</B>
<BR><B>all my heart.&nbsp; I would not even go to the bathroom at night,
because i</B>
<BR><B>had to pass that room to get there, I went to bed before it got
dark so</B>
<BR><B>I would already be past that room at dark.</B>
<BR><B>By the time this incident occured, we had already lived there some</B>
<BR><B>months.........and I had told my mother that I was afraid of the
room,</B>
<BR><B>but of course she just laughed at me.&nbsp; One night, my stepfather
had gone</B>
<BR><B>out of town on business, and had called my mother to ask her a few</B>
<BR><B>things.&nbsp; While she was on the phone, she asked me to go check
on the</B>
<BR><B>boys........they had been in bed for a little while and she wanted
to</B>
<BR><B>know if they were sleeping yet.&nbsp; Now, I had never dared to
say no to</B>
<BR><B>mother, or even argue with her before, but this time I did.&nbsp;
Needless to</B>
<BR><B>say, she forced me into it.&nbsp; I remember going down the hall
towards the</B>
<BR><B>room..........scared to death........and opening the door up.........but</B>
<BR><B>what I saw was NOT the boys bedroom.&nbsp; It was completely black,
a</B>
<BR><B>complete and total absence of light.&nbsp; I screamed and tried
to back up</B>
<BR><B>away from the door..............but something grabbed me and pulled
me</B>
<BR><B>into the room.&nbsp; As I turned around to try to get back out of
the</B>
<BR><B>room..........I saw that there was no longer a door..........I screamed</B>
<BR><B>and screamed and I could feel something, some presence, something
that</B>
<BR><B>had never been human, nearing me and I fainted.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
I came to, I was</B>
<BR><B>laying on the floor in the hallway and my mother was kneeling next
to</B>
<BR><B>me, very white-faced.&nbsp; I asked her what had happened and she
said that</B>
<BR><B>she had come down the hallway behind me to make sure I did what
she had</B>
<BR><B>asked and she saw me step thru the doorway and vanish.&nbsp; She
could hear</B>
<BR><B>me screaming, but it seemed to be coming from very far away.&nbsp;
She said</B>
<BR><B>that she reached thru the doorway and tried to see if she could
feel me,</B>
<BR><B>and I kind of fell into her arms, unconcious.&nbsp; She pulled me
out of the</B>
<BR><B>room and then looked up and the room was normal in every way............</B>
<BR><B>and my brothers where still sleeping on the bunkbed not five feet
from</B>
<BR><B>where I was laying.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say..........we moved soon after that, and she nver
made me</B>
<BR><B>go near that room again.&nbsp; But it was an experience I will never</B>
<BR><B>forget...........the feeling of vileness that issued from that house
was</B>
<BR><B>the like of which I have never experienced since.&nbsp; After I
had the</B>
<BR><B>breakdown, for many years I could not feel any emotions from anyone,
not</B>
<BR><B>even my own.&nbsp; It took me years to recover from that, and regain
that</B>
<BR><B>sense.</B>

<P><B>Ghost Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: moon_beam31@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>The "experiences" I've had have been far and few between but enough
to</B>
<BR><B>rattle me.</B>
<BR><B>I've had more when I was younger, but some I can scarcely remember,
mostly</B>
<BR><B>just sensing things in certian parts of my grandparents home, being
afraid</B>
<BR><B>to go into the rooms because the hair would stand up on my arms
and neck and</B>
<BR><B>I always felt like crying.</B>
<BR><B>The more vivid ones I remember were living here in Sprinfield Missouri
with</B>
<BR><B>my mom and grandpa. Once when I was 17 I went into my mother's bedroom
while</B>
<BR><B>she was at work, and I went to turn on the light and the switch
didn't work,</B>
<BR><B>I shruged it off thinking the light blew up but the minute I stepped
into</B>
<BR><B>the room my whole body went tense. I could feel something sitting
on my</B>
<BR><B>mother's bed but I couldn't see it. Then I heard the bed springs
creak like</B>
<BR><B>someone was getting off and I felt it coming toward me..needless
to say, I</B>
<BR><B>ran out of there and never looked back, locking the doors behind
me. I</B>
<BR><B>didn't come out until my mom came home from work. I was waiting
up for her,</B>
<BR><B>I told her what happened and she kind of laughed, not believing
me. I</B>
<BR><B>followed her into her room, still kind of nervous and the light
worked</B>
<BR><B>fine..I didn't know if I was imagining things or if I really had
an</B>
<BR><B>encounter with a spirit..but I was horrified, and couldn't sleep
at all that</B>
<BR><B>night.</B>
<BR><B>A few months afterwards me and my boyfriend were sitting together
in the</B>
<BR><B>living room, I was on his lap...and I heard the door come open to
the</B>
<BR><B>hallway and I snapped to look and no one was there, then right infront
of me</B>
<BR><B>it slammed shut..I got up and went to see who it was, not really
believing</B>
<BR><B>my own eyes..and no one was even in the house with us..</B>
<BR><B>I think maybe it was my grandma, she died a bout a year or two prior
to</B>
<BR><B>that, I don't think she likes my boyfriend that much..</B>
<BR><B>One experience surely sent chills down my spine that wasn't mine..but
my</B>
<BR><B>mother's..she was living in her apartment while I was in oklahoma
visiting</B>
<BR><B>with my boyfriend's family, and she was laying awake in Bed and
saw the</B>
<BR><B>silohette of a man walk out of my bed room, and stop infront of
her door and</B>
<BR><B>turn to look at her. She said that the man was transparent, but
almost</B>
<BR><B>looked solid, like he wasn't a shadow..he just sort of moved on..but
it</B>
<BR><B>naggs me wondering what he was doing there..</B>
<BR><B>I've also gotten quite a few pictures of orbs and ecto, but for
some reason</B>
<BR><B>it's only when I'm taking the picture, one is of my cat Salem, with
a bluish</B>
<BR><B>white blob in the corner near his head that looks like ecto..and
I end up</B>
<BR><B>with orbs off all kinds when I'm taking pictures of myself or things
in my</B>
<BR><B>room. I'll try to get some pictures up if I can catch them again.
I think</B>
<BR><B>the things are "Susan" as she calls herself..I contacted a few spirits
on</B>
<BR><B>the Ouiji board with my boyfriend, and "Susan" and "Fredrick" were
the ones</B>
<BR><B>we talked to the most, they claimed they have been with us all our
lives,</B>
<BR><B>and knew everything about us. While I'm skeptical about it all..I
can't help</B>
<BR><B>but still be curious if it is true or not..oddly enough the spirits
won't</B>
<BR><B>talk to me when I'm by myself..and I trust my boyfriend enough not
to move</B>
<BR><B>the dial..and they never formed actual words, everything was in</B>
<BR><B>abbreviations, we had to figure it out for ourselves what they meant...</B>
<BR><B>I think somehow me, my mother, and my boyfriend are being followed
by</B>
<BR><B>spirits for some reason..</B>
<BR><B>Well..I think that's all for now..I hope..</B>

<BR><B>The Cemetary Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>by: lisa.maree9@bigpond.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I can't remember what year this happened, but it was about 20 years
ago. My aunty and her boyfriend at the time were 'parking' out side the
local Cemetry, around midnight. They heard a noise, and Kelvin(her boyfriend)
got out to see what it was. He saw a white figure near the front of the
car, and he jumped back in and locked the door. They watched the figure
do a lap of their car, before disappearing in the spot it appeared. After
it was gone, Kelvin started the car and drove straight home, speeding all
the way.Needless to say, I dont think they ever went parking at night again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Grandma</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anabublegum@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My grandma passed away sometime ago(maybe last year)and since then
she has been making her self known.</B>
<BR><B>First of all, she used to have a little flower pot that when you
pressed a button, the flowers would start dancing and it would play her
favorite song, "In the Mood". Well, after she passed, my grandpa put it
inside the closet on the motion detector mode so that he would know if
someone was there. One day when my mom was there she opened the closet
door and it started to play. They went to turn it off the motion detector
mode, but it was already off.</B>
<BR><B>Another thing is that my cousin Megan claims she used to be visited
by her. She does gymnastics and when she would leave, her room would be
clean and all her stuffed animals in place. When she would come home, the
stuffed animals would be thrown everywhere, and her room would be totally
messed up.</B>
<BR><B>Also when she would leave her room just to go get a drink or something,
she would always close the door so their dog, Rusty couldn't get in. When
Megan would come back, her TV would either be off if it was previously
on or on if it was previously off.</B>
<BR><B>One day my mom and I went over to my aunt and Megan's house and
there weren't there yet. So we unlocked the door and went in. We sat in
the front room on the couches and talked while we waited and Rusty was
barking in his crate in the back room that was locked(he always barks when
hes locked up). So we were talking when we heard a closing of a door downstairs.
My other cousin Justin's room is down there so we just assumed it was him.
We thought he might be frightened if he heard us talking up here so we
asked Craig, my mom's boyfriend(who is also a police officer) to yell down
the stairs to tell Justin(even though we were just a few feet away from
the stairs ourselfs). So sure enough he yelled, "Hey, Justin! It's me,
Craig! Me and Stacey(me)and Sharon(my mom) are just here to visit and we're
waiting for Sandy and Megan." No answer. I just merely glanced down the
steps because I frightened of Justin's no response. It was pitch black
down there and all the lights were turned off. We wanted Craig to go down
and So we all sat back down and calmed down. All was quiet(except for Rusty
of course) when all the sudden.... BOOM!! There was a big thud where the
attic would be but they didn't have an attic. There was a few more and
there was silences between each one and we noticed Rusty was silent.</B>
<BR><B>A few moments later, my Aunt Sandy, Megan, AND Justin arrived. We
belive this was the mischeif of my Grandma.</B>
<BR><B>Well, thats all I could fit. I'll send more soon!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Great Aunt Ivy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: variven@bellsouth.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; This true story of my Aunt Ivy took place in 1920..</B>
<BR><B>Ivy was my Grandpa's oldest sister, him being the baby out of 14
children.</B>
<BR><B>Ivy had already married and begun a family of her own. Just at sunset
one day, as they were all sitting on the front porch, Ivy came walking
up, and said "I've come home ,mommy". My great-Grandmother thought it strange
because Ivy was expecting a child and lived far away, but they were happy
to see her anyhow. She stayed for dinner, and spent the night. Just after
dinner, my grandfather got in trouble, and was going to get a spanking.
Ivy got between the two, and said "No daddy, don't spank him tonight".
Later, they all went to bed. When they awoke the next morning, she was
gone. About noon, her husband pulled up in the wagon, and told them that
Ivy had died in childbirth about sunset the day before. All she could tell
him during her labor, was "I want to go home", which was impossible, because
she was in labor and 50 miles away. My great-grandmother told him, she
DID come home, and nobody was really surprised, because she was always
a very determined person!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; This was told to me by my grandfather, who really never spoke
much anyway. So I tend to believe him when he tells us stuff like this!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Haunted</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Nirvanaboy101@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,my name is James I'm 18 years old and I live in North Carolina.4
years ago,a friend and me where hanging around his house in his dads bedroom.Joey(my
friend) told me that he didnt like staying in his house alone because he
could always hear the floor creaking.I told him it was nothing to worry
about because old houses do that all the time.But one Thursday night at
10 p.m. we had just got done skateboarding and I walked him home,He asked
me to stay with him so I said yes.After a hour of so playing video games
we heard the front door slam pretty loud,Of course we thought maybe it
was his dad.But Joeys dad had a habit of calling out Joey's name when he
got home,to see if he was home.</B>
<BR><B>After the door slammed we looked at each other and the only thing
that could come to our mind was to say Holy sh*t,from downstairs it sounded
like foot-steps walking under us.We instantly got a chill down our back
and decided to walk down stairs.Of course we where scared to death but
we couldnt just sit their and let it happened.I never really belived in
the whole paranormal stuff at the time.So I immediatly ran down the stairs
and looked around,We didnt see anything the front door was closed and locked
just the way we left it.</B>
<BR><B>We walked back up-stairs,went to his dad's room and locked the door.We
where kinda shook up,so we sat down and listened to some music trying to
pass the time.When 12 O'clock came I decided to sleep over,so I called
my mom and told her that we would be at his house.We went to sleep,and
around 2am(may be wrong on that)we heard footsteps coming up the steps,all
we could do was cry like little kids because it was scaring us to death.We
put on music again trying to mute the sound of footsteps.We finally where
able to go to bed,we woke up at 11am and walked down the hallway.The exact
place where the footsteps came from we got a chill,we knew that it had
to have been something paranormal because stuff like that doesnt just happened.</B>
<BR><B>We never told ANYONE about our expereince because we knew that people
would think we are crazy.Espially me at the time I was suffering depression
and i didnt need anything to set off my mom.So we kept it to ourselfs.Byt
to this day we havent heard anything like this happening again.We hope
that its finally moved on or its just not trying to scare us anymore.</B>
<BR><B>My second ghost story(sorry for ALL the typing)</B>
<BR><B>This happened when I was around 5 years old,I had recently lost
my grandfather due to a heart-attack.He passed away right where my room
is.One night,I was sleeping with my mom and we usually kept the door opened
incase I needed to go to the bathroom.I was sleeping and I woke up and
turned over,I looked out the window and saw a figure of my grandfather
standing at the door looking very depressed.I could see it perfectly very
solid.Then it turned around and walked to the bathroom.My imidiate thought
was grandpa is alive so I ran to the bathroom and didnt see anthing.Everything
was as everything should be.To this day I know it was my grandfather and
everyonce and a while I will get a tingly feeling down my spine like someone
is rubbing my back and its not really a scary feeling its a very comfirting
feeling.I feel like he is watching over me</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;Haunting in my House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kiddieslodge@bellnet.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>The land on where my house sits, I was told was a strawberry field.
The house itself was built by my father inlaw 20 years ago. My ghosts experience
began one day going into the basement. For background purposes I am from
Portuguese descent. I was born and raised in Toronto. My mother experienced
many ghostly and out of body experiences, which I always found interesting.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways, back to my story. I was walking to the basement of our
house like any other time to go get something. While walking down I decided
to look the opposite direction of the way I was&nbsp; going, when all of
a sudden my body was frozen and I saw a man sitting on the sofa. He stared
at me with disgust and got up and walk into thin air. At first I thought
maybe it was my imagination. Even, I don't have that great of one, and
I knew the details that I have seen were to real. The man was dressed in
a black suit and top hat. When I spoke to my brother-in-law he said that
description was an undertaker. One year later my father- in -law passed
away.</B>
<BR><B>I've had many other experiences sometimes scary, but fascinating.
I thought you might be interested in hearing my story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Kenton Street Haunts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: phaslon@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello fellow Believers!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my first experience when I was five years old
and I am forty-one</B>
<BR><B>years old now. I consider myself a pretty intellegent person with
very</B>
<BR><B>little mental illness. You notice I said very little. If people
said they</B>
<BR><B>were not just a little wacky, they would be lying. Any way. This
one is just</B>
<BR><B>too weird for a haunting. So, what is it?</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Springfield Ohio on Kenton Street going towards
East Street, there are</B>
<BR><B>two businesses that sit side by side. These businesses are: The
Koering</B>
<BR><B>Bomag and Champion. Koering made road rollers and Champion made
caskets. My</B>
<BR><B>father use to weld caskets for Champion but then he went to Koering
to weld</B>
<BR><B>rollers.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Between these two buildings (I think they are empty
now) there is this</B>
<BR><B>raised bit of land. What appears to once be a cornerstone can be
found</B>
<BR><B>there. And behind this area are quite a few trees. I remember my
sister and</B>
<BR><B>I taking many walks past that area and I felt unease. A cold chill
if you</B>
<BR><B>will.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now comes the weird part. I had a dream when I was
in Junior High School</B>
<BR><B>about this place. It was obviously night-time in my dream. I was
standing</B>
<BR><B>beside the cornerstone, looking with shock what was about to take
place in</B>
<BR><B>front of me. There was this robed individual holding up a male infant.
"It"</B>
<BR><B>placed the infant on the cornerstone and I had the strong feeling
that "It"</B>
<BR><B>was about to sacrifice this child! I could not speak. Then I noticed
there</B>
<BR><B>was others near me, dressed in the same way. I kept moving in and
out from</B>
<BR><B>between them. I felt like; "Oh my God. Do you see what that person
is about</B>
<BR><B>to do?" I could not see their faces because of the hoods and they
acted like</B>
<BR><B>I was not even there! I felt helpless. "It" sacrificed the baby
and I could</B>
<BR><B>do nothing to stop it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time it was "just a dream". I never spoke
of it to any one. It</B>
<BR><B>was just too bizarre and they would have thought me a would be child
killer</B>
<BR><B>in the works since a child was involved. But, on one of those walks
with my</B>
<BR><B>sister, I stopped and looked up towards the cornerstone. "Lori.
I had this</B>
<BR><B>weird dream about this place." "So did I", she said. And she went
on to tell</B>
<BR><B>me my dream! The differences were that she was there instead of
me and that</B>
<BR><B>the robes were burgandy (they were black). Everything else was the
same.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We had discussed about going up there late at night
when there was no</B>
<BR><B>chance of anyone seeing us. How would we explain to the police what
we were</B>
<BR><B>doing there? "Well, officer. You see...We saw a baby killed here
and we were</B>
<BR><B>just wanting to see if we could find something." All we would have
to do is</B>
<BR><B>dig or scrape dirt away in this area we both felt the child had
been buried.</B>
<BR><B>But, what if we found bones? What would we do? Then "It" would really
truly</B>
<BR><B>move from being a dream to something much more scary.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; We couldn't do it. I have been back there a few months
ago with a new</B>
<BR><B>video camera my daughter and future son-in-law bought me for my
birthday. It</B>
<BR><B>was raining and very cold. I picked up a dog howling in the distance
and</B>
<BR><B>possibly a baby crying but I saw nothing except the earth, the cornerstone</B>
<BR><B>and the trees. I am still spooked by that place and I am far from
being a</B>
<BR><B>kid!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Little Girl Crying</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 17 years old my family and I rented a house in Macomb,
Illinois.</B>
<BR><B>At night I would hear a girl about my age</B>
<BR><B>crying. Since I shared the room with my sister I thought it was</B>
<BR><B>her so I would get up and check. She was always sound asleep.</B>
<BR><B>One day I had my white rabbit running around downstairs and</B>
<BR><B>noticed a white animal running upstairs, thinking it was my rabbit
I went</B>
<BR><B>after it when it disappeared into thin air. My rabbit was sitting
next to</B>
<BR><B>the chair I had just been in. I was the</B>
<BR><B>only one in the family that heard and saw this. My Mom talked to
the</B>
<BR><B>landlady when I told her about it. But all the lady would say is
that a girl</B>
<BR><B>died there. My sister must of been sleeping in her room. She also
had a</B>
<BR><B>white poodle and that is what I saw run upstairs. It would of been</B>
<BR><B>interesting to find out more about this girl and her dog but we
moved away.</B>
<BR><B>19 years later I still wonder if that girl is still trapped and
crying for</B>

<P><B>My Best Ghost Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: superj2121@houston.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; In the year 1999&nbsp; after I had just gotten my drivers
license&nbsp; my best friend and i decided to go for a short ride. We had
been listening to our favorite country song "The Little Girl" by John Michael
Matgomery. We were having a great time until some drunk driver came and
slamed into our car. The car started to flip over and over again. I luckily
had only minor injuries but my friend who forgot to where a seatbelt was
killed. Now every time I go down that road while listening to the radio
that same song comes on and at the corner of my eye I see my best friend
sitting safely with her seatbelt tightly on her.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;My Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: EniledamS@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello my name is Madeline Smith and I am 12 years old. Ever since
I was a young child strange things have happened to me. From a girl named
Sally who told me she died in a car accident, to (one of the strangest
yet) a pig-like apparition in the hallway that charged at me whenever I
tried to go to my room sometimes forcing me to sleep on the couch. Through
all this I have one experience that stands out as even so extreme I sometimes
have trouble believing it happened myself.</B>
<BR><B>My family and I were returning from San Francisco when my grandmother
saw up ahead a very old graveyard and asked my mother to stop so that she
may take some pictures. I had an uneasy feeling as we pulled up. I hesitated
as they got out for some reason it just didn't seem right ... more so than
entering a graveyard. There was a light breeze as I stepped out of the
car and walked through the large metal gate into the small yard. My relatives
wandered about gawking at the headstones of angels and such but I just
slowly wandered aimlessly between the rows. While doing this I came upon
the plain-looking headstone of a young girl who had died of smallpox, as
I read the writing and the DOB to DOD I was caught up in a sort of dream
only everything seemed perfectly real even and especially up to the feeling.</B>
<BR><B>I was lying in a hospital bed covered with a single blanket, my
head hurt and I was breathing very deeply as though labored. Curtains hung
from both sides of me and nurses and a couple of doctors were rushing right
and left. I heard their voices talking about patients and certain illnesses
but they sounded distant and hard to hear. As all this was going on I began
to hear my heart beating, at first almost as my own but gradually it became
slower and I had the sudden urge to sleep...and it beat so soft and so
slow ... it finally stopped and all went black. I found myself back in
reality, with tears streaming down my face, staring at the headstone. Shortly
after this my mothers camera stopped working, and I told her just plain
out "They're upset, can we please leave?" it almost seemed as if someone
had told me.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kinkyshitten@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi - i guess this is where is tell you what has happened to me.</B>
<BR><B>Ever since i was a young girl, i've always been intrigued and perplexed
my</B>
<BR><B>ghostly happenings, and looking back, i guess i was always a little
more</B>
<BR><B>receptive to picking up on strange things going on around me. This
the first</B>
<BR><B>account. My eldest sister moved into her own place quite a few years
ago.</B>
<BR><B>She and her husband left the spare room empty for the time, and
it was only</B>
<BR><B>when my grandad unfortunately passed away that they put the bedrrom</B>
<BR><B>furniture from his room in their spare room. Istayed over there
quite a lot</B>
<BR><B>from that point on, but i was unaware of where the furniture had
come from.</B>
<BR><B>I often woke in the middle of the night with a strange feeling -
not a</B>
<BR><B>threatening one, but quite brooding all the same, and made my way
downstairs</B>
<BR><B>where i would stay for the rest of the night, sleeping soundly on
the</B>
<BR><B>settee. My sister had a cat- Miller - whom they had had for a couple
of</B>
<BR><B>years, and who had never shown any strange behaviour before. Yet,
when i</B>
<BR><B>reported my experiences to my sister, she explained that it was
strange that</B>
<BR><B>i should say that, as just a couple of days after the furniture
was</B>
<BR><B>delivered, miller was upstairs in the spare room, and my sister
in her</B>
<BR><B>bedroom, when she heard miller start hissing and spitting, and when
she went</B>
<BR><B>to investigate, he was stood up on the bed, with his back arched,
fur on</B>
<BR><B>end, and his tail was all bushed out, still hissing at something
she</B>
<BR><B>couldn't see. He then ran from the room like a bat out of hell,
and wouldn't</B>
<BR><B>fall asleep in that room again. My niece was born less than a year
after</B>
<BR><B>this, and since she has come into the world, all strange feelings
and</B>
<BR><B>strange cat behaviour in that room seems to have stopped.</B>
<BR><B>But this is the story that inspired me to write to you and share
my</B>
<BR><B>experience:</B>
<BR><B>Just over three years ago, i started University in Leeds. I was
to be</B>
<BR><B>staying in University accomodation for my first year, and so was
very</B>
<BR><B>pleased to find that this accomodation consisted of a large victorian
house,</B>
<BR><B>which had been separated off into 3 different floors, with 10 Bedrooms
in</B>
<BR><B>total. On the bottom floor were 4 rooms, each with 2 boys in. the
second</B>
<BR><B>floor was made up of 5 bedrooms - 2 double rooms for girls, a double
room</B>
<BR><B>for boys, and two single rooms, occupied by two lads. On the top
floor was</B>
<BR><B>one bedroom -&nbsp; a single room for a female, with a small landing
outside,</B>
<BR><B>anda bathroom across the landing. I was to be the fortunate girl
at the top</B>
<BR><B>of the house on her own, in room number 10.</B>
<BR><B>I found the house a little scary - it was my first time living away
from</B>
<BR><B>home, and anyone would have been naturally a little apprehensive
about being</B>
<BR><B>stuck on the third floor on their own of a huge old house. But,
i made the</B>
<BR><B>room my own, and found it pretty cozy after a while, for a time
at least.</B>
<BR><B>The first thing that my fellow housemates and I remember happening
is when</B>
<BR><B>one of the other girls was up in my room on her own using my computer,
and</B>
<BR><B>the rest of us were downstairs on the ground floor in the communal
area. The</B>
<BR><B>girl suddenly came bolting down the back staircase, slamming open
the bottom</B>
<BR><B>fire door, and into the lounge, visably shaken. She said she was
just being</B>
<BR><B>silly, but she had her back to the door,when she said she had felt
cold air</B>
<BR><B>surround her, and the hairs on the back of her neck stood up. She
was sure</B>
<BR><B>someone was stood behind her, so she turned and simply bolted down
two</B>
<BR><B>flights of narrow stairs to get away.</B>
<BR><B>We all dismissed it as being just 'one of those things' and put
it down to</B>
<BR><B>normal jitters. But it was to get much more interesting.</B>
<BR><B>The next thing to happen to me, and i still get shaky and tearful
when i try</B>
<BR><B>and verbally tell people -i was just really really scared. It was
near</B>
<BR><B>Halloween time in that first term, and a couple of the boys had
gently</B>
<BR><B>teased that they were goint to do 'something' to scare each of the
girls. as</B>
<BR><B>a result of this, when i went to bed that night, i checked my room
from top</B>
<BR><B>to bottom, and then locked my door. At about three in the morning,
i was</B>
<BR><B>aware of a pressure resting on the top of my foot. I was drowsy,
and still</B>
<BR><B>half asleep, but as i was coming around, i felt fingers tighten
around my</B>
<BR><B>ankle, release and then felt fingers tip toe up my leg - imagine
making your</B>
<BR><B>first and middle finger 'walk' - that was what i was feeling going
up my</B>
<BR><B>leg. i was awake by now, but couldn't focus, and couldn't move.
when the</B>
<BR><B>hand reached the top of my knee, it paused, and then suddenly grabbed
my</B>
<BR><B>knee hard, making my knee jolt in a reflex action. then, it was
gone. I felt</B>
<BR><B>nothing else, but sat in the dark, in the corner of my bed against
the</B>
<BR><B>wall,and didn't sleep until the sun came up, and i got the nerve
to move,</B>
<BR><B>turn on my light, and my TV. I told my housemates what had happened,
and</B>
<BR><B>they assured me that i was dreaming it,and shouldn't be so sensitive,
and</B>
<BR><B>why didn't i wake someone up to help? because i didn't dare move,
because i</B>
<BR><B>knew - KNEW - something would be in my way before i got to the door.
I slept</B>
<BR><B>in one of the double rooms with the other girls for the rest of
that week,</B>
<BR><B>and finally slept in that room again. Since then, i've always had
to sleep</B>
<BR><B>with some source of light in any room i&nbsp; sleep in, whether
it be a burning</B>
<BR><B>candle- dangerous, i know - or with my TV on, or with a lamp, when
i'm on my</B>
<BR><B>own. I also have fairly frequent recurring nightmares where someone
walks up</B>
<BR><B>the side of my bed and is looking down at me, often a child or a
small</B>
<BR><B>figure, and often have to get up and check my room two or three
times before</B>
<BR><B>i'm satisifed i'm alone.</B>
<BR><B>I never felt comfortable in that house again,and had no reason to.
Other</B>
<BR><B>people began to experience things -&nbsp; my boyfriend was coming
down the main</B>
<BR><B>grand staircase in the foyer at about 1.00am, when he was physically
pushed</B>
<BR><B>from behind down the last 3 steps. Another time, it was him and
another guy</B>
<BR><B>were in the house on their own one night when the rest of us had
gone out,</B>
<BR><B>when they heard running footsteps on the second hall floor above
them. There</B>
<BR><B>is a firedoor at the top of each staircase,and in the case of the
main</B>
<BR><B>staircase, there is a reinforced glass and wood panel cordoning
off the</B>
<BR><B>upper landing, so no one could fall. There was a light switch for
the upper</B>
<BR><B>hall at the bottom of the stairs, and at the top on the other side
of the</B>
<BR><B>door. Simon, one of the guys, turned on the light at the bottom,
so the</B>
<BR><B>landing was illuminated. When he reached the top of the stairs however,
the</B>
<BR><B>light on the other side went out, even though there was nobody visable
near</B>
<BR><B>the light switch at the top. This was repeated for 2 more attempts,
until</B>
<BR><B>they refused to enter the landing in the dark, and left the house
for the</B>
<BR><B>night until we all got back.</B>
<BR><B>We had a cleaner who came into the house every other day, and who
had worked</B>
<BR><B>at the university for many years. she was about 45 years old, and
had grown</B>
<BR><B>children of her own. When we aked her about the house one morning
while we</B>
<BR><B>were all there, she told us flatly that she did not like the house,
and in</B>
<BR><B>the holidays when all the students went home, she would not come
in and do</B>
<BR><B>the clean out on her own - she just refused. She said that she would
never</B>
<BR><B>use the main staircase either - she would only use the small service</B>
<BR><B>staircase at the back. She left it at that, but that just reinforced</B>
<BR><B>everything we had experienced. It got really strange towards the
end of our</B>
<BR><B>time there - one of the guys saw a young boy - aroungd 8 years old
- stood</B>
<BR><B>outside his bedroom window at about 2.00 am in the dark, just staring
in.</B>
<BR><B>There were reports of bulging in the ceilings of bedrooms, on the
lower</B>
<BR><B>floors, which the staff attributed to squirrel nests, strangely
enough. One</B>
<BR><B>of the final things that occurred was when we were all eating take-out
on</B>
<BR><B>the second floor of the house. From there, we would see the firedoor
and</B>
<BR><B>accompanying window which surrounded the spiral staircase that led
to my</B>
<BR><B>room. The window was at foot height as you climbed the staircase.Anyway,
we</B>
<BR><B>were all sat there, when four of us, all facing the window, saw
the distinct</B>
<BR><B>shadow of legs climbing the stairs to my room, even though no body
had moved</B>
<BR><B>from where we were, and whoever it was would have had to pass us
on their</B>
<BR><B>way up, and nobody had. that was pretty much that then, i resisted
sleeping</B>
<BR><B>there as much as possible,refused to be on my own for prolonged
periods of</B>
<BR><B>time,and was never more glad than the day we packed up and left
that place.</B>
<BR><B>I wanted to share my story, because i feel that, despite the fear
i felt at</B>
<BR><B>the time, and still feel to an extent when recounting the details,
i feel</B>
<BR><B>priviledged in a strange way to have had such experiences. I have
remained</B>
<BR><B>friends with the people i lived with that year, and when we go over
what</B>
<BR><B>happened and talk about it, there is a strange affection within
us all for</B>
<BR><B>what happened and what we shared. It brought us together, and that
can never</B>
<BR><B>be a bad thing.</B>

<P><B>My Mothers Old House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: stillhascherry21@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One day my mother told me what happened one night she had fallen
a sleep on her couch. She said she felt someone tapping her on her back
and she woke up. Then she heard a mans voice say I have money hidden inside
this house if you find it you can have it. But when see turned over to
see if anyone was there she saw nothing but air. At that time she was scared
of what just happened. The next day she called her sister, asked her to
come over to her house. They went searching around the whole house tapping
on the walls to see if it sounded hollow, and looking in the floor vents
but they fount nothing at all. Thats all she could do because she was just
renting the house.</B>

<BR><B>My Old House in Victor</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Rosebud1060@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in the High Desert area of So. California.&nbsp; Victorville
is the name of the town, but 70 years ago the name was The Town of Victor.&nbsp;
History,&nbsp; according to the older folks is that this used to be a town
where outlaws used to hide out and became a place of many murders and known
as a bad luck place.&nbsp; I was born here in 1964 and was raised here.&nbsp;
when I bought my first house, it was downtown which is now refered to as
Old Town.&nbsp; My house was built in the early 1930's.&nbsp; I was told
by my husbands Grandfather that that whole block used to be the location
of the first cemetary.&nbsp; The cemetary was moved one block up to make
room to build houses.&nbsp; In other words, bodies were exhumed and relocated.&nbsp;
When me and my family moved in there, things were pretty normal and quiet
at first.&nbsp; In the hallway and the washroom (laundry room) instead
of light swaitches on the walls, there were light bulbs on the ceiling
and a chain or string hung down to pull in order to turn it on.&nbsp; One
night as I was lying in bed trying to go to sleep, I happened to be looking
out into the hallway and noticed that the string from the light was swinging
back and forth, slowly at first, then began to swing faster and as far
back and forth as it could reach.&nbsp; When I woke my husband, he just
lay there looking too and we just didn't know what to believe.&nbsp; Things
started to get weirder after that.&nbsp; Things came up missing and I would
find them in strange places. I was always blaming the kids who never seemed
to know what I was talking about. We had wood floors and I would often
hear footsteps crossing the room.&nbsp; The toilet would flush by itself.&nbsp;
We could never have a cat for a pet, it would always go and live at the
neighbors or run away. One night I had a party for my son and as my family
sat around the kitchen table talking, all of a sudden my sister grabbed
her purse and jacket and said she had to go home,later to explain how she
had seen in the darkened room what looked like a white shirt floating across
the room by itself.&nbsp; One night my daughter came into my room and said
she couldn't sleep because her bedroom door wouldn't stop openning and
shutting (by itself). One night as I was in bed I heard the back door unlock
and close and footsteps across the kitchen floor.&nbsp; I was so terrified,
I thought we had a burglar, I woke my husband who searched the house and
found nothing. A couple of times when I was alone in the house I heard
heavy breathing&nbsp; behand me.&nbsp; My best frien stopped coming over
to visit because she said she felt like she was being watched.&nbsp; I
contacted a Christian Phschic who came over and brought a psychic friend
of hers.&nbsp; Without charging a fee, after hearing the experiences I
had, she wanted to know for herself what was going on. Her findings were
that there was a spirit of the first owner of the house, a man who was
not happy at the thought of another man living in that house and was causing
these things to happen.&nbsp; She said at one time, the man became deathly
sick and almost died in that house.&nbsp; She said his spirit was there
and he didn't want to go on to the next place.&nbsp; She gave me some herbs
and told me to make little white sacks from material and hang them round
the house and also to talk to him and tell him to go ,not to be affraid
to move on to the next place where he should go.&nbsp; I moved out of that
house after 12 years and have been in another home for 6 months now.&nbsp;
Last month, and article came out in the Daily Press about the Community
Center in Old Town, which happens to be one block from my old home.&nbsp;
The article states that during major renovations to the Community Center,
the constuction workers threatened to quit because their finding tools
moved around or doors found open the next day when they came to work when
the doors had been locked and noises which made them uneasy being there.&nbsp;
Determined to find out what was going on,&nbsp; the man in charge hired
a psychic who performed a se'ance. It was determined that there was a spirit
if a man who once lived in Victor and he had died from being shot in the
head.&nbsp; He also said that there were other spirits there from around
the neighborhood.&nbsp; Maybe the spirit from my old house was there that
night too.&nbsp; My old house has been vacant for 6 months now.&nbsp; I
guess I'm glad to be out of there and don't miss the strange goings on.&nbsp;
Things are peaceful and I have a much more relaxed feeling here at my new
home.</B>

<P><B>My Own Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was reading through some stories on your site and it prompted me
to send in my own. Actually, this particular story was not an experience
that happened to me, although I have had other strange things happen. My
friend's name is Maggie. We live in an area around St. Louis, Missouri-this
is a city with a lot of history, and it is very old. It has many many buildings
that are supposed to be haunted. One old mansion in the city was home to
a family back in the 1800s, who brewed beer. As i understand it, nearly
every member of this family-the Lemps-either was murdered or commited suicide.
Their mansion, the Lemp mansion, is now a bed and breakfast, and is turned
into a haunted house for people to go through at halloween every year.
It would have to be one of the most popular haunted houses in the area.
Maggie, and three of her friends, were going through the mansion around
halloween about 2 or 3 years ago. It wasn't too scard i asked her to describe
the man. As she did this, I was going to a website about the Lemp mansion,
which had a picture of one of the Lemps himself. (I forgot the man's first
name, but he had committed suicide in the 1800s) Maggie had described that
man exactly, without having ever seen the picture</B>

<BR><B>My Strange Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:space_harrier@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realize I am among those who would listen.....so
I will share with</B>
<BR><B>you the(hopefully anyway) condensed version of my life story.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite a few years ago, when I was 6 years
old, I was swimming in my</B>
<BR><B>Uncle Steve's pool, diving in, jumping out, etc.&nbsp; Well, suddenly,
I got</B>
<BR><B>really brave, and wanted to touch the bottom of his pool.&nbsp;
I was a child</B>
<BR><B>with a small lung capacity(and asthma on top of that), and probably
should</B>
<BR><B>have abandoned the idea, but, typical of me, I did not.&nbsp; I
tried many times,</B>
<BR><B>but could only get about halfway, then had to come up for air.&nbsp;
Did I</B>
<BR><B>mention he had a 21 foot deep pool?&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; He was quite
well off,</B>
<BR><B>money-wise, so he wanted to buy something he could show off, of
course.</B>
<BR><B>Yeah, he had a pool worthy of a Gym.</B>
<BR><B>Anyhow, I wanted to do a final attempt--give it my all.&nbsp; I
gathered my</B>
<BR><B>courage, and my breath, and went for it.....and, halfway down, as
last time,</B>
<BR><B>I ran out of breath.&nbsp; I kept on.&nbsp; It burned.&nbsp; It
was painful.&nbsp; I kept on.</B>
<BR><B>The bottom was in sight....I was almost there!&nbsp; I touched the
bottom, and</B>
<BR><B>attempted to push off, and head toward the surface.....but my body
had no</B>
<BR><B>energy left.&nbsp; The "Push Off" became a "Dead Float."</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slowly float toward the surface of the
pool, and felt life slipping</B>
<BR><B>from me.&nbsp; It is rather hard to describe, but I felt like I
was still, and my</B>
<BR><B>body was rising...and I felt really light headed, and I was near
paralyzed.</B>
<BR><B>Life was fading...then, suddenly, the pain stopped, and I was able
to swim</B>
<BR><B>to the surface, and pull myself out of the pool, onto the cement.&nbsp;
I lie</B>
<BR><B>there, gasping for air.&nbsp; When I got my breath, I got up, slowly,
and looked</B>
<BR><B>around, to see if my Uncle had noticed my absence.&nbsp; I didn't
see him--but</B>
<BR><B>what I did see changed my life forever.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw many people sitting around my Uncle's
outside patio table,</B>
<BR><B>conversing, gesturing toward each other, as if they were discussing</B>
<BR><B>something.&nbsp; I began to walk closer, to see who they were.&nbsp;
They continued</B>
<BR><B>their actions.&nbsp; I walked even closer.&nbsp; Then, when I got
about 20 feet from</B>
<BR><B>them, one of them turned his head toward me.&nbsp; Not his body,
just his head.</B>
<BR><B>His face is forever burned into my memory.&nbsp; It is a face that
had life</B>
<BR><B>ripped from it.&nbsp; A pale face, with minor noticeable features,
such as a</B>
<BR><B>plain nose, and eyes I could barely tell were there...because they
were</B>
<BR><B>somewhat transparent.&nbsp; The others began to turn toward me as
well, and two</B>
<BR><B>of them began to rise from their sitting positions...to come toward
me.&nbsp; One</B>
<BR><B>or two of them began to walk my way.&nbsp; That was it....I felt
madness coming</B>
<BR><B>over me.&nbsp; My eyes knew they were real, but my brain tried very
hard to tell</B>
<BR><B>me that they were not.&nbsp; I was terrified.&nbsp; I was also curious.&nbsp;
Something</B>
<BR><B>told me to get away, and get away fast.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took a step or two backwards, my gaze
locked on those lifeless eyes</B>
<BR><B>of the first ghost's, and I could feel myself being drawn into some
sort of</B>
<BR><B>vacuum.....it came in intervals, like a heartbeat....my body would
pulsate,</B>
<BR><B>then stop....pulsate, then stop.&nbsp; Then, I felt an incredible
force pull me</B>
<BR><B>back, my hands out, towards the pursuers.....and, I suddenly saw
my Uncle,</B>
<BR><B>bringing me back to life.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me I was gone.&nbsp; I was dead.&nbsp;
No pulse, no breathing, nothing.</B>
<BR><B>He had tears in his eyes, and was so thankful I was back.&nbsp;
He said I had to</B>
<BR><B>be out at least 5 minutes, because that is how long he was in the</B>
<BR><B>house....he saw me dive under, he said.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will never forget what I saw that day...I
still dream about</B>
<BR><B>them....and I still see them to this day.&nbsp; They have never
hurt me, but they</B>
<BR><B>always show up at inopportune times...when I was younger, they would
stare</B>
<BR><B>into my doorway, and motion for me to join them in another room.&nbsp;
When I</B>
<BR><B>would follow, they would move into another room.&nbsp; I would follow
them for 10</B>
<BR><B>minutes sometimes, then just give up. I would encounter them multiple
times</B>
<BR><B>a day, no matter where I go, so I know they were not bound to any
one place.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Libraries, friend's houses, my house, school, parks...it
didn't matter.</B>
<BR><B>When the lights were dimmed or off, they would really come for me.&nbsp;
I had</B>
<BR><B>this saying when I was younger, that I would tell people(like my</B>
<BR><B>psychiatrist for a month or two, hehehe), when they asked why I
didn't like</B>
<BR><B>going to bed:&nbsp; "...because at night, they come for me."&nbsp;
How true it was.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, when I died that day(and
I did it again a few years</B>
<BR><B>later, hehehe--I wanted to conquer that pool!), I opened some kind
of door</B>
<BR><B>that didn't close.&nbsp; I also gained a few "abilities" from this
experience, as</B>
<BR><B>well.&nbsp; I have great eyesight, but I cannot look into lights
brighter than</B>
<BR><B>about 20 watt.&nbsp; No joke.&nbsp; I think my brain got all messed
up when it was</B>
<BR><B>without oxygen for so long, but who knows. I also get odd feelings
when</B>
<BR><B>something bad is about to happen...like when my Great Grandmother
died(or</B>
<BR><B>VaVa, in Portuguese), I felt quite sad.&nbsp; That night, my Dad
called me to</B>
<BR><B>tell me the news.&nbsp; I got the same way a month or two ago, when
my friend</B>
<BR><B>lost his Grandfather....but, sometimes, one or two things will slip
through</B>
<BR><B>the cracks, and get by...that same friend lost a grandmother a week
ago, and</B>
<BR><B>I felt nothing.</B>
<BR><B>If anyone wants to hear more, or would like to discuss such things
with me,</B>
<BR><B>I welcome you all.&nbsp; I am quite busy all the time, and am hardly
ever home,</B>
<BR><B>but my AIM is: spaceharrier18, and my email address is</B>

<P><B>My Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lisa.maree9@bigpond.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I lived with my parents, we had a ghost living with us aswell.
One night when my brother and mum were out, and I was in the shower, my
dad was in the lounge watching tv. He saw something move in the doorway
to the hall, and he saw something run into my bedroom. I came out of the
bathroom not long after, and confirmed that I hadn't been to my room. My
mum saw the same thing, when all of us were in the lounge with her. I never
actually saw it, but I did see something it left behind. I was in my room
with my boyfriend, when I noticed a mark on my dressing table mirror. On
closer inspection I found it was a set of handprints, like someone with
sweaty hands put them on the mirror.I called everyone into the room, and
we all compared our hands with the prints. None of us matched, they were
too small. Our house was fairly new, so we hadn't heard of anybody passing
away while living there. We never saw the ghost again after that.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Oakwood Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: stdkmc31@shsu.edu</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I love your website. I just wanted to comment on one thing. I was</B>
<BR><B>looking on your Haunted Places Index and saw that Oakwood Cemetery
was</B>
<BR><B>listed. I grew up in Huntsville and have heard stories about Oakwood
all</B>
<BR><B>my life. The statue at the Powell family plot, although known as
the</B>
<BR><B>"Black Jesus", the proper name is "Christ in Bronze" and it's a
very</B>
<BR><B>rare statue. I think only two or three exsist. The first person
buried</B>
<BR><B>in the plot was Rawley Rather Powell, the five year old son of Benjamin</B>
<BR><B>Harrison Powell III and Marion Rather Powell, also known as Miss
Mamie.</B>
<BR><B>Rawley bled to death when he hemrraged after having his tonsils
removed.</B>
<BR><B>This happened in 1925. Ben and Miss Mamie were devestated by the
loss of</B>
<BR><B>their beloved child and spent a lot of money setting up a nice plot
for</B>
<BR><B>him. It is the only place in the cemetery that is protected. No
trees</B>
<BR><B>are allowed to be cut down in that plot.</B>
<BR><B>There are four other people buried there besides Rawley. Ben, Miss</B>
<BR><B>Mamie, Ben IV., who died in about 1994, and Ben IV's infant daughter
who</B>
<BR><B>died sometime in the 1940s. I remember hearing that the gravediggers
had</B>
<BR><B>a hard time digging Ben IV's grave because of the preservation clause.</B>
<BR><B>The tombstone for his daughter is at the entrance to the plot. I'm
not</B>
<BR><B>sure if this is where she is actually buried.</B>
<BR><B>Oakwood cemetery is a fascinating place. Besides General Houston,
it</B>
<BR><B>contains the graves of many prominent early citizens of the area,</B>
<BR><B>including Henderson Yoakum, an early historian. It also includes
the</B>
<BR><B>graves of several Union P.O.W.'s from the Civil War.</B>
<BR><B>Another story about Oakwood is about Maydell Oliphant. She was from
a</B>
<BR><B>prominent local family and very popular. One night she came home
from a</B>
<BR><B>party very ill. Within a day or two she died and was buried in Oakwood.</B>
<BR><B>Her family had a statue of her made in Italy for her tombstone.
Within a</B>
<BR><B>few days rumors began to circulate that Maydell had been buried
alive.</B>
<BR><B>When her grave was finally dug up, Maydell was dead, but it appeared
she</B>

<BR><B>Ranch Style House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rodman@c-magic.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have never really had any experiences with haunting, until I started
visiting my father and his wife.I ended up staying a short time with them,my
thoughts of the paranormal will never be the same.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; let me set the stage for you.I live in mid Missouri,an area
steep in the history of a young nation ever expanding westward.houses here
has survived Indians,tornados,a civil war,and various traumatic times until
now.the place where my father stays is resting on the foundations of a
large,multistory house,in the middle of a 1500 acre ranch.the house that
he lives in is a ranch style house,dwarfed by the size of the foundation
of the former house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; as I first came to the inner gate to the house,I had an overwhelming
sense of pressure across my chest.and in an instant,in a vision I saw several
confederate solders come riding up to the gate.I thought I had this vision
several other times,but I then realized that some times the riders were
union soldiers.I knew then that there was something different with this
house.as I was getting settled in my room I saw that a good dusting was
needed.so I did,windows and sills included.the very next day I noticed
inside the closed windows,where I cleaned the day before.there was so many
dead flies I could not count them all.then as days passed,the feeling of
uneasiness kept me on my toes.I started to hear people call my name out
loud when no one was around.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I kept seeing people out of the corner of my vision,that
would disappear when I looked directly at them. then finally one night
I was awakened from my sleep by my bed jumping up and down,I quickly jumped
out of bed and dashed thru the doorway.as soon as I cleared the doorway,the
bed stopped moving.I stayed awake in the living room the rest of the night.the
next day,I asked if anyone has ever seen or heard anything strange happening
in the house.they affirmed that voices were heard,people were seen,and
my fathers wife was awakened by something that grabbed her blanket down
by her feet,and started to shake it up and down like someone making a bed.another
figure was seen trod walk across the living room and turned right and started
to walk up the stairs that no longer existed there.I left there with a
feeling of dread,danger,and foreboding,never to return again.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Natchez Chase</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Lou602@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Several years ago I was traveling down the Natchez Trace late one
night. I don't know if any of you have traveled the Trace at night, but
it is very dark and not many lighted areas except from on coming cars.
This makes it a very lonely drive and the speed limit is 50 so time goes
by really slow. Up grades are always being made and at times you must detour
off the Trace to a near by road and in several miles you can go back on
to the Trace, mostly for bridge repairs. As I approached one of these by
pass detours that night I will never forget what I saw. On the left side
of the road there stood a tall man I'd say around 6 foot with a white beard.
He was standing perfectly still and did not make any moves pointing his
finger towards the by pass exit. He was bare foot and wore clothes that
were gray in color. His pants were ragged up to mid shin. I remember that
he did not scare me. I had a feeling of good will come over me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Seen Heard and Felt</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pete.robins1@BTopenworld.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Rachael and I have seen, heard and felt a ghost. I am
13 years old and when I first had an encounter with a ghost, I was 11.
I was with my parents walking threw a haunted graveyard. This may seem
silly for a 11 year old with her step sister and parents to be walking
late at night in a haunted graveyard. We had just been on a 26 mile walk
up Cleave Hill. This is in England. Walking threw the graveyard was the
quickest way home. The graveyard was called Prestbury graveyard and I think
most the most haunted place in Cheltenham. Any way there was a path striate
threw the graveyard. As I was walking down it I started to feel all warm
and fuzzy in my stomach and my heart I began to feel chills and I looked
up and I saw a nun walking towards me. It wasn't a ordinary person I could
see striate threw her. I was surprised that it was only me that could see
her. She was walking strait towards me, when she came up close, I thought
she would just disappear, but she didn't she just walked striate threw
me and when she did it felt really good. I a flush feeling in my head and
I felt really good about my self. I didn't even feel negativity. I was
just in perfect calm. I felt as if she blessed me. I'm not religious. In
fact I am, but my religion is witchcraft. I just felt so good as if there
was a pure spirit guiding my way home. I saw object around me glowing a
blue-grey and then everything was a blue-grey colour an inch surrounding
every object including me and my family. And that I would say was the best
experience of my life. Nobody has believed my as I told them my story I
was just hopping someone who has had experience with ghosts would believe
me.</B>

<P><B>Rented House in Burnaby</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: zena23@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Judy.</B>
<BR><B>I am a 38 year old Canadian woman.</B>
<BR><B>Several years ago I lived in a big old house in Burnaby,B.C.</B>
<BR><B>It was the top level of a hugh house that had been built during
the war.</B>
<BR><B>The apartment I occupied had 3 bedrooms.</B>
<BR><B>I lived there alone.</B>
<BR><B>The bedroom I slept in was directly across the hall from one of
the other two,</B>
<BR><B>it was identical in every way to my room,</B>
<BR><B>there were some antique items that were in there when I moved in.</B>
<BR><B>A bed,a dresser with a mirror and and old sitting chair.</B>
<BR><B>I usually always made sure that the door to that room was closed</B>
<BR><B>because it gave me the creeps to look into it at night time.</B>
<BR><B>This particular night,I had used the mirror in there to do my make-up
and I had forgotten to close the door.</B>
<BR><B>I had come home and gone to bed.</B>
<BR><B>In the motion of turning over,I happened to look into the door frame
of the other room,</B>
<BR><B>and I noticed a figure standing in the door,holding the side of
frame.</B>
<BR><B>I could see no features,only an outline,that looked like the oppsite
of a shadow.</B>
<BR><B>It had a sort of glow.</B>
<BR><B>I thought to myself,"What if it starts to come towards me?</B>
<BR><B>As soon as I finished the thought,</B>
<BR><B>I was out of bed and clicked on the light.</B>
<BR><B>I suddenly felt remoreful,and sorry for this spirit,or whatever
it was.</B>
<BR><B>I clicked the light off.</B>
<BR><B>It was gone.</B>
<BR><B>The very next day I called a friend and he helped me move.</B>
<BR><B>I abandoned whatever furniture I could not take in the first load,</B>
<BR><B>including a sofa and loveseat that was almost brand new.</B>
<BR><B>To this day,almost 20 years later,I wonder who or what I saw there
in that house.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Trentonbuzzsaw@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was a 3rd. Class MS onboard the USS Coral Sea, according to reg's
many personnel known as "mess cooks" were sent to our division as a sort
of labor pool. One such mess cook Galen Mullis &amp; I became friends.
He was from Engineering, &amp; he told me about the Shaft Room where a
nasty smell permeated this space, even after many refurbishings. Including
several 'Yard(s) refitting; chipping &amp; repainting, dismanteling of
the shaft etc.</B>
<BR><B>Well, there was this smell in this compartment that smelled like
death. I immediately felt uncomfortable as well. I had come to find out
that a former shipmate had hanged himself in this room, &amp; no one found
him for weeks. This unfortunate deed happened in the 1960's, yet the odor
from remained.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Worth Telling</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ksmcgee4416@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I live in northwestern Montana in a very rural and mountainous area.&nbsp;
One</B>
<BR><B>cloudy afternoon after finishing up work, I loaded up my three dogs
and</B>
<BR><B>decided to drive to a little local cemetary that I had never been
to before.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; It is tucked back in the woods far from the main road on
a unmaintained</B>
<BR><B>curvy dirt road.&nbsp; I was driving my 1972 GMC pickup truck and
I thought to</B>
<BR><B>myself, "Looks like rain.&nbsp; Maybe I should head back home in
case it rains</B>
<BR><B>because my wipers haven't worked in years."&nbsp; I was almost there,
so against</B>
<BR><B>my better judgment, I headed to the cemetary.</B>
<BR><B>Once I got there, I found a very small graveyard on a beautiful
hill with 18</B>
<BR><B>graves (possibly more unmarked).&nbsp; Some were marked only by
wooden crosses</B>
<BR><B>without names or dates on them.&nbsp; (This may be because the area
I live in is</B>
<BR><B>known for its poverty level).&nbsp; I was extremely upset to find
the place a</B>
<BR><B>complete and utter mess.&nbsp; There was trash laying around the
gravestones,</B>
<BR><B>plastic flowers in their vases had been knocked over, the grass
was not</B>
<BR><B>mowed - the place was in a state of neglect.&nbsp; I left the dogs
in the cab of</B>
<BR><B>the truck and proceeded to walk around and pick up the trash, depositing
it</B>
<BR><B>in the bed of my pickup truck for later disposal.&nbsp; I straightened
up all the</B>
<BR><B>vases and flowers, and was talking to the residents as I did so
saying</B>
<BR><B>things like, "I can't believe you would all be left like this,"
and "I am</B>
<BR><B>going to clean this place up - people need to have more respect
for all of</B>
<BR><B>you." After I was done, I walked over to a grove of trees and stood
in the</B>
<BR><B>center for a few moments when I felt a distinct presence behind
me, and</B>
<BR><B>heard/felt someone breathing immediately behind me.&nbsp; Right
at that moment,</B>
<BR><B>my dogs started barking like mad and when I spun around to see who
was</B>
<BR><B>there, I saw no one, but the dogs were all staring in my direction,
still</B>
<BR><B>barking and looked really agitated.&nbsp; I stood there looking
back at them and</B>
<BR><B>it started to pour down raining.&nbsp; I ran back to the truck and
got in and</B>
<BR><B>said out loud, "Great, now we're stuck here until it stops raining
because I</B>
<BR><B>won't be able to see to drive us home."&nbsp; I started the truck
anyway to let</B>
<BR><B>it run for awhile (early fall is chilly here in MT) and the windshield</B>
<BR><B>wipers started up by themselves.&nbsp; I swear I then heard a woman's
voice</B>
<BR><B>whisper "Thank you."&nbsp; My dogs were growling and looking around
at me and</B>
<BR><B>each other like, where did that come from?&nbsp; I felt really good
about what I</B>
<BR><B>had done, as it surely made a person (or people) on the other side
happy,</B>
<BR><B>and they returned the favor.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Body in Red</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B>i know that i keep sending in stories that i say didnt actually
happen to me, but i want you all to know that i have had some strange experiences
of my own..i will probably post them later, but for right now i dont feel
comfortable writing them, because they scare me as i am still living in
the house it happened in. Anyway, this story actually happened to my grandpa
before i was even born. Everyday on the way home from work he would pass
a very small bridge with a small amount of water running underneath it-not
a river, just a very miniscule creek. He was used to passing over the bridge,
it wasnt a big deal, and though it is larger now and in an area surrounded
by businesses, at the time it was still undeveloped and was just a quiet
road surrounded by trees and field. Anyway, one day on the way home from
work my grandpa was in a good mood and just sort of looking out of the
windows of his truck and thinking. He glanced atis the real part that gives
me shivers, and i swear that it's true- about two weeks later, an article
appeared in the paper. A seven year old boy,&nbsp; (it showed a picture
of him, and he was in red and had dark hair-and yes i know the picture
wasnt of the day he died, so the red thing isnt about the actual body,
if you get what i am saying, but that is what he saw,) and the article
reported that a young boy riding his bike had hit a ditch of some sort,
and crashed his bike into the little creek, under the bridge. He had&nbsp;
struck a rock with his head and had died instantly. I remember the way
my family tells this story to this day, they know that my grandpa had had
some premonition of what was going to happen over a week later.</B>

<BR><B>The Cabin</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:earhox@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was 18 I came home from college for the weekend to visit my
boyfriend</B>
<BR><B>who was living with a co-worker in a small cabin in the woods.&nbsp;
The next</B>
<BR><B>morning my boyfriend and his roommate got up early and headed to
work</B>
<BR><B>leaving me alone in the cabin.&nbsp; After they left I got back
into bed to relax</B>
<BR><B>for awhile as there was no tv to watch or anything else to do.&nbsp;
I thought I</B>
<BR><B>would have a nice relaxing day alone.</B>
<BR><B>I must have dozed off because I was suddenly shaken awake.&nbsp;
My first thought</B>
<BR><B>was that my boyfriend had come home and was trying to wake me.&nbsp;
But when I</B>
<BR><B>tried to open my eyes to see what was up I found that I couldn't
get them to</B>
<BR><B>open.&nbsp; The shaking stopped and I continued to focus all my
energy on forcing</B>
<BR><B>my eyes open to see what was going on.&nbsp; Not only couldn't I
open my eyes,</B>
<BR><B>but I couldn't move my body either.&nbsp; I'd heard of sleep paralysis,
but had</B>
<BR><B>never experienced it before.&nbsp; I tried to relax until it passed,
but the</B>
<BR><B>sense that someone was kneeling next to the bed with its face within
inches</B>
<BR><B>of mine was horrifying.&nbsp; It was like there was a very menacing
presence</B>
<BR><B>right there staring at me, and all I wanted to do was turn my head
and look</B>
<BR><B>at it.</B>
<BR><B>After a couple minutes went by I was able to let out a kind of strangled</B>
<BR><B>shreik, which I have never done before or since, at which point
I regained</B>
<BR><B>control of myself. Needless to say I sprang out of that bed and
flew into</B>
<BR><B>the next room badly shaken and sweating profusely.</B>
<BR><B>The day that ensued was anything but relaxing.&nbsp; I could not
shake the</B>
<BR><B>feeling that someone was watching me.&nbsp; I am not a paranoid
person, and this</B>
<BR><B>was a new kind of fear for me.&nbsp; It was extremely unpleasant.&nbsp;
To keep myself</B>
<BR><B>busy until my boyfriend came home, I set about cleaning the cabin.&nbsp;
I found</B>
<BR><B>myself thankful that these two guys were such pigs as it kept me
busy for</B>
<BR><B>most of the day.&nbsp; But being late fall, darkness came early
in the evening.</B>
<BR><B>And with the growing darkness came the growing fear that something
was</B>
<BR><B>indeed watching me.&nbsp; It became so strong that I had to pull
all of the</B>
<BR><B>curtains closed in the hopes that whatever it was was outside.</B>
<BR><B>This done I continued to seek out anything remotely untidy to straighten
up.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; My nerves were frazzled and I realized that I was trembling
quite abit.</B>
<BR><B>Never have I felt this kind of irrational fear.&nbsp; I was very
aware that I was</B>
<BR><B>acting crazy, but it was like some kind of flight instinct was setting
off</B>
<BR><B>all the self preservation hormones in my body.&nbsp; I just couldn't
help it.</B>
<BR><B>I bent down over the coffee table in the living room and picked
up a plastic</B>
<BR><B>cd holder in order to wipe the table down.&nbsp; I set the cd holder
square in</B>
<BR><B>the middle of the table and turned toward the couch to straighten
the</B>
<BR><B>pillows.&nbsp; As I turned I caught a quick movement in the window
behind the</B>
<BR><B>couch.&nbsp; This frightened me so badly that I just froze where
I was.&nbsp; So much</B>
<BR><B>for my flight instinct.&nbsp; And as I stood there frozen to death
staring at the</B>
<BR><B>window, I heard the distinct sound of the plastic cd holder crashing
across</B>
<BR><B>the wooden floor behind me.&nbsp; When I was finally able to turn
around to see</B>
<BR><B>about the noise, the case was gone.&nbsp; So I turned back to see
what had caught</B>
<BR><B>my eye in the window.&nbsp; The curtains were open just a crack
and the movement</B>
<BR><B>I saw was just the reflection of myself turning to straighten the
sofa</B>
<BR><B>cushions.&nbsp; I had scared the pant off myself.</B>
<BR><B>At that moment my boyfriend and his roommate got home and I broke
into tears</B>
<BR><B>and tried to tell them what I had been through.&nbsp; It sounded
so stupid.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>roommate went down the hall and retrieved the cd case from his room.&nbsp;
It was</B>
<BR><B>cracked and a couple pieces had broken off of it.&nbsp; Somehow
the cds it was</B>
<BR><B>holding had all ended up under the coffee table.&nbsp; We tried
to figure out how</B>
<BR><B>a rectangular object could have slid off the table and rolled down
the hall,</B>
<BR><B>around the corner into the back bedroom.&nbsp; Let alone with such
force that it</B>
<BR><B>was badly broken.</B>
<BR><B>It was a pretty scary experience and I sincerely hope that I never
feel that</B>
<BR><B>kind of fear again.&nbsp; Anyone who has felt this will agree.</B>

<P><B>The Call of the Banshee</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Sciaccay@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a true encounter with the other side that happened when I
was younger.&nbsp; My family had a house built in a clearing in a piece
of Woodland know as Ojibway. When the house was in the finishing stages,
my brother who is 10 yrs OLDER than I&nbsp; went into the basement and
immdeiately hated it. It wasn"t anything you could see.. Anyways we moved
into the home and tried to make it comfortable. Thats when the phone calls
started. At first we thought it was the wrong number, we now in the yr
2000 recount our experience as something more than a mis dialed number.
Anyway the call would usually come around the time my Dad left for work
at 11pm. The voice on the other line was an elderly lady telling that "david
and Christine" could not have their piano lessons today because she was
ill. My&nbsp; mom would hang up. at first she was pleasant but after awhile
my mother was getting angry. I was 3 at the time and I was dealinWe worked
through each incident and I was 6 when it started up again. My brother
and my father seem to see or witness things. My mom took the phone calls
from the woman and it was always the same saying David and Christine and
about their piano lessons. Telephone company at the time requested a new
number but because we just moved from over seas we didn't want to do it
so soon. So we had to either put up or shut up.&nbsp; One night about 8:30
my brother stayed home while the rest of us went grocery shopping. I guess
from what I was told, He and&nbsp; a friend werr working on his bike in
the basement. the phone rang and my brother ran upstairs to answer it.
His friend heard my brother on the phone and also heard a womans voice.
He came upstairs and my brother hung up the phone. The friend told my brother
what he had heard. They both went back down stairs and they both heard
a door shut and what sounded like a womans voice. They ran upstairs and
there was nobody. My brother ran upstairs towards the bathroom andthe old
woman moaned and the phone went dead. No dial tone nothing. My dad heard
a screech so unearthy and so scary that even the dog cowered down. The
calls stopped. Freaky coincidense is that my Aunt Christine and Uncle David
who live in another country were taking piano lessons from an eldely neighbour
who passed away . The date cooresponed with our start of phone calls. There
were alot of other weird things and in the end we moved. I often wonder
if the reason why three families have since moved from that house have
had any weird things.</B>

<BR><B>The Ghost of Coach Hill</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gemma@gice.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This took place in a quiet neighborhood near Terrace Gardens of Coach
Hill. I'm 17 who is currently in Forest Lawn high School. I live with my
mom but on most occasions I'm pretty much on my own I'm well into reading
and does not believe into the paranormal activities until now.&nbsp; So
take a moment to read my story. It was when I fell asleep late one afternoon,
I was awoken to a loud bang in the up stairs kitchen.&nbsp; I then felt
paralyzed from the loud bang and thought to myself "Could this be my mother
or an intruder?" As instincts, I rushed to my dresser were my cell phone
sat and instantly phoned my mother. Before I got to talk to her she instantly
said to me "Scott honey I'll phone you right back I'm in a meeting!" Before
she let me go I rushly said "mom there's someone else in the house!" Before
she replied the phone went dead as if the reception&nbsp; was being blocked.
The silence of up stairs then led to foot steps, which then trailed its
way towards the stair way.&nbsp; The thought of survival came to mind and
reached for my baseball bat.&nbsp; As I griped my bat thinking that I must
be going crazy. I then heard the mid weight soft steeps head for my bedroom
door. I then yelled ''who's there!'' No one responded.&nbsp; Then said
''you'll be sorry for opening the door!'' It was quiet for a moment and
then the loudest, violent, banging, pounded on my door as if an angry 400lb
man was boxing a punching bag. I slowly opened my door not knowing what
I'm about to see and nothing was there. I looked at the markings on my
door and saw the big indent and felt more scared. As I begin to look for
my cordless phone to call the cops I realized that my mother didn't pay
the monthly bill so the phone was useless. I then tried my cell phone again&nbsp;
and got nothing but static. I had no choice but to search the house to
see who it was and found nothing to be seen at all. The locks on the doors
and windows were locked. They haven't been touched at all. Suddenly the
lights started to flicker for a while as I stood there in shock and heard
my bedroom door slam with a bang. I turned my head towards the stairs with
a snap to see a black darken figure race with speed up the stairs and out
the front door breaking the lock right in my face leaving the door a jar.
I don't know what I experienced that day but I'm sure it was abnormal.
I believe the black figure looked allot like a scrambled screw up on a
computer screen. Thank you for reading my story of my life.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Ghosties</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: belle98@attbi.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have read thousands of stories submitted by people on this site
and it</B>
<BR><B>never gets old to me.&nbsp; I decided it was finally time to share
my most</B>
<BR><B>significant experiences here.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy reading.&nbsp;
In 1998, I began</B>
<BR><B>to frequent a neigborhood watering hole in one of the many ethnic</B>
<BR><B>communities still in existance here in Pittsburgh, PA.&nbsp; The
music was</B>
<BR><B>great, the bartenders were cool, but there was just something about
the</B>
<BR><B>place that kept luring me back.&nbsp; The building itself was tall
and old,</B>
<BR><B>narrow in the front where the bar was with an even more narrow passage</B>
<BR><B>to the back room where there are pool tables and even a fireplace,</B>
<BR><B>probably the original fireplace since the building was built, now
gas</B>
<BR><B>fueled.&nbsp; You got the feeling that this place was probably a
Tavern of</B>
<BR><B>sorts from the time it was built, which I now estimate to be somewhere</B>
<BR><B>around 1875. It didn't dawn on me until I had been going here for
about</B>
<BR><B>a year that the women's bathroom, no matter what the time of year,
was</B>
<BR><B>at a constant 50 degrees or so.&nbsp; Always cold in there, and
you always</B>
<BR><B>have the feeling you're being watched.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;It wasn't until I met my current boyfriend, who lives directly
above</B>
<BR><B>this place in an apartment, that things started to get really cool.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>had decided to stay at his place for the first time one night and
I woke</B>
<BR><B>up in the night to find a man standing at the bottom of the bed.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>rubbed my eyes and just looked at him for a few moments, then realized</B>
<BR><B>that he was gray - the best way I can describe it is like he just
walked</B>
<BR><B>out of a black and white TV - and he stood there, hands on hips,</B>
<BR><B>watching me.&nbsp; I could feel that he felt I was an intruder there,
he was</B>
<BR><B>specifically giving me that vibe. I realized that this was an apparition</B>
<BR><B>and like most of the encounters I have had, I also realized that
when it</B>
<BR><B>actually DID happen to me, it wasn't as scary as I had set myself
up to</B>
<BR><B>believe it would be.&nbsp; I closed my eyes and sort of rolled over
and</B>
<BR><B>squeezed my boyfriend.&nbsp; I ran over in my mind the conversation
I had had</B>
<BR><B>when I first met him about my interest in Parapsychology, and I
remember</B>
<BR><B>thinking "Oh my God, he doesn't even realize they're here!"</B>
<BR><B>So I turned back over to find the man still there, still looking
at me.</B>
<BR><B>This time, I pinched my boyfriend and he muttered in his sleep.
I just</B>
<BR><B>had to verify that I wasn't dreaming.&nbsp; Suddenly, movement caught
my eye</B>
<BR><B>peripherally to the left - I rolled over a little more to see a
woman</B>
<BR><B>with LONG hair bent over me on my side of the bed.&nbsp; I squeeeeezed
my</B>
<BR><B>eyes shut tight.&nbsp; I didn't feel the negativity coming from
her that I</B>
<BR><B>did from the man, who was still there. So they watched me.&nbsp;
Each time I</B>
<BR><B>opened my eyes they were still there.&nbsp; I remember thinking
about my</B>
<BR><B>theories that ghosts didn't have control over their actions, all</B>
<BR><B>hauntings were residual, blah blah blah....I thought this blows
that</B>
<BR><B>theory! I opened my eyes to look again and they were both gone.&nbsp;
To this</B>
<BR><B>day, I think they were just checking me out.&nbsp; I think they
have always</B>
<BR><B>been there and they just wanted to know what I was doing there!&nbsp;
This</B>
<BR><B>was the first time I had ever seen an appartition, ever.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The next time it happened was a similar scenario.&nbsp; I
was lying in bed</B>
<BR><B>awake, trying to sleep.&nbsp; My boyfriend had been sawing logs
for quite</B>
<BR><B>some time.&nbsp; I was looking at the ceiling when, again, peripherally,
I</B>
<BR><B>caught movement by the doorway to the room.&nbsp; I looked quickly
in that</B>
<BR><B>direction and I saw a woman enter the room.&nbsp; NOT the same woman
I had</B>
<BR><B>seen previously, either.&nbsp; This one was dressed in some kind
of</B>
<BR><B>turn-of-the-century barmaid get up and this one was carrying a tray!&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>thought "well, that's something you don't see everyday!"&nbsp; So
I watched</B>
<BR><B>her.&nbsp; I did not feel afraid.&nbsp; She seemed completey oblivious
to me, and</B>
<BR><B>I was scared then, but kept quiet.&nbsp; She walked down along the
foot of</B>
<BR><B>the bed, stopped. Walked a little more, stopped. She came up along
my</B>
<BR><B>side of the bed and sat down holding this tray with what looked
like old</B>
<BR><B>beer mugs or steins on it.&nbsp; I did not feel the bed drop or
give from any</B>
<BR><B>kind of weight, but I could plainly see her sitting there. She also
was</B>
<BR><B>gray, looked like black and white TV.&nbsp; I remember thinking
"Am I just</B>
<BR><B>going to lie here and&nbsp; wait for her to go away or should I
test this?"</B>
<BR><B>I tested.&nbsp; I started to swish my feet around under the covers,
and she</B>
<BR><B>slowly faded away - almost like "dissolved".&nbsp; She never did
look at me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I had discussed these things with my boyfriend about a week
after they</B>
<BR><B>happened, and he urged me to give my opinion of what I thought was</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; I told him what I had seen and he smiled.&nbsp; He
said, "You just</B>
<BR><B>verified what I had always thought.&nbsp; A man and a woman are
here.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>think they like me."&nbsp; I laughed and said, "Oh, I think you
have more</B>
<BR><B>than that!"&nbsp; After the initial sightings, things began to happen.&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was like my presence there "woke them up".&nbsp; Items began to
disappear,</B>
<BR><B>then reappear in other places. A pair of gloves I had bought myself</B>
<BR><B>around Christmas completely disappeared and I took to blaming my
sister</B>
<BR><B>for this, as she liked to steal my things.&nbsp; Appliances and
lamps turned</B>
<BR><B>on and off. You could almost feel the "zap" of electricity in the
air.</B>
<BR><B>You'd see movement out of the corner of your eye constantly. The
sound</B>
<BR><B>of a man coughing in the kitchen. One night, my boyfriend felt someone</B>
<BR><B>get into bed and lie down next to him - someone very cold and invisible!</B>
<BR><B>Someone brought by some old photos from a previous Halloween taken
in</B>
<BR><B>the apartment.&nbsp; There were five people in the photos and there
was an</B>
<BR><B>orb above every one of their heads. I am skeptical about&nbsp; orbs,
but I</B>
<BR><B>still thought there being one for every person was kind of interesting.</B>
<BR><B>The items that were disappearing at this time, seemed only to be
MY</B>
<BR><B>things, or important things of his that I would get blamed for moving</B>
<BR><B>when I didn't touch them.&nbsp; I was starting to get annoyed.&nbsp;
I am a good</B>
<BR><B>and nice person and I treat my boyfriend better than anyone he's</B>
<BR><B>probably ever known in his life. I couldn't understand why they
didn't</B>
<BR><B>like me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;On Valentine's day of the following year, I was given a key
to my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend's apartment.&nbsp; I was overjoyed. Finally, I could come
and go as</B>
<BR><B>I pleased and I wouldn't have to ask him to come downstairs and
unlock</B>
<BR><B>the main door for me anymore.&nbsp; About a week after I got the
key, we were</B>
<BR><B>at the bar and I really had to use the restroom.&nbsp; The bar's
bathroom was</B>
<BR><B>packed, a five-girl wait.&nbsp; I decided to use his bathroom right</B>
<BR><B>upstairs.&nbsp; I unlocked the door, ran upstairs, did what I had
to do and</B>
<BR><B>quickly ran back downstairs. When I went to lock the door behind
me, my</B>
<BR><B>key was bent.&nbsp; It was bent almost to the shape of a question
mark!&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>had never seen anything like this and I racked my brain trying to</B>
<BR><B>remember how it could have been bent that way. I spent 10 minutes
trying</B>
<BR><B>to straighten it out on the doorjamb, but to no avail.&nbsp; I went
back into</B>
<BR><B>the bar and showed my boyfriend and he was upset about it.&nbsp;
He said,</B>
<BR><B>"well, I guess some people can't handle this responsiblity," and
took</B>
<BR><B>the key off of my keyring and tossed it in the trash.&nbsp; I was
VERY upset.</B>
<BR><B>I tried to explain that there was no way possible I could have done
that</B>
<BR><B>to the key!&nbsp; I couldn't even bend it back!&nbsp; This led to
an argument</B>
<BR><B>between us and I was so upset that I just left.&nbsp; I used his
key to</B>
<BR><B>unlock the upstairs door and went upstairs and got in bed.&nbsp;
As I sat</B>
<BR><B>there crying, I felt the electrical "charge" come into the room.&nbsp;
I got</B>
<BR><B>very mad.</B>
<BR><B>I said "Look!&nbsp; I love this boy.&nbsp; I don't know why you
are doing things</B>
<BR><B>to try to drive us apart.&nbsp; I take good care of him, I make
sure he eats</B>
<BR><B>and has clean laundry and I JUST LOVE HIM!&nbsp; I wish you would
please</B>
<BR><B>stop.&nbsp; I have no objections to you being here, but you have
gone too</B>
<BR><B>far! You need to get where you're going to and fast!&nbsp; You shouldn't
be</B>
<BR><B>here, YOU HAVE PASSED ON!"&nbsp; Everything was quiet.&nbsp; I cried
myself to</B>
<BR><B>sleep and woke up about an hour later when my boyfriend came upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>He came into the bedroom and sat down on the bed.&nbsp; He said
"I'm sorry.</B>
<BR><B>After you left, I fished the key out of the trash.&nbsp; We looked
at it and</B>
<BR><B>there really is NO WAY you could have bent that key that way. We'll
get</B>
<BR><B>you a new key."&nbsp; I thought I heard a quiet sigh somewhere in
the room,</B>
<BR><B>and that was the end of that.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The next morning, I woke up, got dressed and came out into
the living</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; We looked at the key some more and were just perplexed.
We</B>
<BR><B>decided to get some food.&nbsp; I went into the bedroom to get my
watch on</B>
<BR><B>and there, lying at the bottom of the bed were the gloves I had
lost</B>
<BR><B>around Christmas!&nbsp; They were lying palm-up, put together as
they would</B>
<BR><B>be on a pair of hands.&nbsp; I just smiled.&nbsp; A peace offering.&nbsp;
After that,</B>
<BR><B>things died down considerably.&nbsp; I did not feel any presences
in the</B>
<BR><B>place besides our own.&nbsp; No electrical zap in the air.&nbsp;
No movement out</B>
<BR><B>of corners of eyes.&nbsp; All activitiy pretty much stopped.&nbsp;
That was about</B>
<BR><B>a year ago. Things were quiet - until now.&nbsp; Sometime in November
2002, I</B>
<BR><B>got up off the couch to stretch, and happened to see a little black
cat</B>
<BR><B>run across the doorway in the kitchen.&nbsp; My boyfriend had not
seen it</B>
<BR><B>and, although he does have a cat, his cat was asleep behind him
on the</B>
<BR><B>couch. I ran into the kitchen and looked everywhere.&nbsp; There
was no cat.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes at night we can hear the sound of a bottle cap being batted</B>
<BR><B>around on the kitchen floor. It's very distinct, there's nothing
else</B>
<BR><B>that sound could be.&nbsp; His cat has always been strange, but
now we are</B>
<BR><B>noticing more that she seems to be playing with another cat.&nbsp;
A few</B>
<BR><B>nights ago, my boyfriend was in bed falling asleep and he was petting</B>
<BR><B>his cat, to his left.&nbsp; He said that he felt another little
kitty run up</B>
<BR><B>onto the bed and lie down next to his cat!&nbsp; His cat then bristled
up and</B>
<BR><B>ran off of the bed and into the living room.&nbsp; He could still
feel the</B>
<BR><B>weight of the other cat next to him, but when he tried to touch
it,</B>
<BR><B>there was nothing there. I have also always been skeptical about
animal</B>
<BR><B>ghosts, but this is too weird!&nbsp; Things have remained quiet
lately.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>only thing I've noticed is, more and more frequently, that "zap"
of</B>
<BR><B>electricity has started to come and go again. I am not opposed to
them</B>
<BR><B>being there.&nbsp; I feel that there is defintely more than just
one or two</B>
<BR><B>spirits there, and also downstairs.&nbsp; I would still like to
get to the</B>
<BR><B>bottom of why the owner of the bar REFUSES to be there alone to
close up</B>
<BR><B>at night!&nbsp; I've heard a few stories leak out about things being
crazy</B>
<BR><B>down there after hours as well, but the only thing I've ever experienced</B>
<BR><B>there was cold spots and being touched softly on my shoulder. I
am sorry</B>
<BR><B>for the length, but I don't know a shorter way to tell my story!&nbsp;
OH,</B>
<BR><B>also, anyone in the Pittsburgh area who is open to this stuff and
who</B>
<BR><B>wants to do some investigation, please feel free to contact me.
Happy</B>
<BR><B>Hauntings, all.</B>

<P><B>The Girl's School In Beverly New Jersey</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Trentonbuzzsaw@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 13 or so, my parents went to a party at a friend's
house on Warren &amp; Farnum Sts in Beverly. There is a large 3 story house
that is now apartments. While at the party they heard screaming &amp; pounding
in the attic; the party was in a 2nd flr apt. Many people went up there
&amp; found nothing. I had come to find out that there was a fire in the
attic when this building was a school for girls in the 1800's. Apparently
there had been a fire at some time that took the lives of 2 girls. Now,
my parents are most sensible,&nbsp; &amp; I do not think that this was
a lark on their part.</B>
<BR>

<P><B>The House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: THEYEXECUTIONER@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>OK heres the background of my house. It is about 75 years old when
my parents bought it was built on an Indian burial ground. The previous
owners of the house were a family of 6, a mother a father two sisters and
a two brothers. The father died the reason I could not find the mother
died two months later of heart ache. One of the brothers soon killed himself
in the basement and one of the sisters contracted a rare disease called
elephantitus were your whole body swells up and becomes gray. The other
sister did not have any problems but the other brother was a drug addict.
This family was very religious and hung religious items in the unfinished
basement.</B>
<BR><B>When I was 8 I started noticing weird happenings in the house although
I did not see anything I felt it. I would sense something coming down from
the stairs into my living room I looked were I thought the feeling was
coming from and I followed the feeling 10 feet until it disappeared I was
not shore what to do so I did nothing. A year went by with these feelings
until I started feeling it enter my room late at night and being awoken
by its presence. Every time this happened I was not scared I just felt
uneasy.</B>
<BR><B>It would be another year until I started seeing its figure. It started
as a dark 6 foot shadow that I seen coming up from the stairs and into
my room and hover over my bed for a moment then disperse I could sense
that this was not a bad spirit and did not mean to harm me. I then started
staying up late and playing video games in my liveing room when i seen
what i felt in the past year 2 white orbs that were the size of eyes came
in through the window on the side of the steps and made its path through
the living room 10 feet from the steps then disappeared, although these
times it seamed to go faster than when I used to feel it.</B>
<BR><B>Then 2 years went by until a great events started occurring at this
time I was 11 and it was the summer before I was to enter the 6th grade
and my cousin had moved in who is part Native American. The first event
that happened was that when I was laying in my bed early in the morning
I felt a presence take me over although I was still conscious it felt that
our spirits had joined. I would then look up at my ceiling fan and with
no windows open I would make it move without touching it would go one way
very slowly then I would make it stop and spin the other way. The next
event was the first threatening one, there were four 2ft by 1ft boxes stacked
in the middle of my room. One night I woke up to an evil presence in my
room and as I did I seen all the boxes toss up into the air and fall. I
did NOT pay much mind to it until the next morning thinking they just fell
over. When I awoke the next morning and started cleaning up I noticed that
the bottom box was on its side.</B>
<BR><B>I knew it was the bottom box because it was the only box that had
stuff in it. At the site of this I knew something was wrong and I fell
back on my bed and laid there for a few minutes stupefied by the site and
thought.</B>
<BR><B>That night me and my cousin stayed up late playing video games.</B>
<BR><B>my dog was up stairs because it was thundering and he is scared
of thunder so he goes up there to try and get into a bedroom and hide under
the bed. i went upstairs to get something and as i was going down the stairs
my cousin was waiting for me at the bottom of the steps when we herd loud
scratching coming from his bedroom that lasted 3 seconds. We got scared
and ran into the kitchen. we then went up stairs to see what it was thinking
it was my dog. we looked down the hallway upstairs. all the doors were
closed but my dog was standing in the middle of the hallway staring at
us in a threatening kind of way. As we approached him he growled stopped
then ran down stairs. we opened the door to my cousins room to see 2 sets
of 3 3 inch claw marks scratched into the floor.</B>
<BR><B>Since these events have happened i have moved from that house and
have lost the feeling of my soul being joined with another but have gained
the ability to tell if something is true or not. i can tell because my
eyes start to have 2 tears build in them then role down my cheeks. I still
get feelings of paranormal beings when i go over my friends house who has
a poltergeist there. i know i sensed it because i said i felt a presence
there before he could tell me there was one.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The New House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: darkhorse@sc.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am fifteen years old, and i have never believed in ghosts...never.</B>
<BR><B>I know that there are people everywhere who say the exact same thing...and
i know that there are few people who would believe me, that most would
call me paranoid. But i have a story to tell, and i have never believed
in not telling a good story...</B>
<BR><B>As I was saying, i have never believed in ghosts. Even when i was
younger, i was certain there were no monsters under my bed and nothing
was hiding in my closet. And then, just two summers ago, my family moved.</B>
<BR><B>We moved from the same small town I had always lived in to the so
called "big City"-- to Ft. Jackson, a military base in Columbia, SC,</B>
<BR><B>And it began. From the first night, wierd things happened. That
night, my dog, who is, at six years old, relatively mature and quiet, woke
me for the first time since he was a puppy and needed help getting on my
bed. He was growling, the most awful look on his face. Sugar is a sweet
dog, but on this night he looked...scary. NOt at me, you must understand.
He was in full out guard stance at the foot of my bed, fending off--mothing.
He faced out towards the center of the room, and there was nothing there.</B>
<BR><B>That was the first and only night that i slept with my bedroom door
closed. Make that, I tried to sleep with my door closed. After waking,
there was little hope that i would fall back into any sort of peaceful
rest. And this was only the beginning.</B>
<BR><B>Everywhere that I go, there's this feeling that something doesn't
want us here...something is always watching us. Even as I type, I feel
it. Doors close on their own...the sliding glass door at the back of the
house closed itself one day, just this past summer. I was just relaxing
on our patio. I had left the door open, so that the breeze could air out
the house. It was cool, for a midsummer's day,and the breeze was so peaceful.
I was alone, as one usually is when this sort of thing happens, when the
door slid shut. It didn't slam, it just slid. I saw nothing, no person,
nothing. But Sugar was again in guard stance, silent this time, just watching.</B>
<BR><B>Other times, my radio will turn itself on and off. It came to the
point where i couldn't sleep at night, everything that i had believed,
that there is no such thing as ghosts, was coming unraveled. I would hear
voices, so I started sleeping with the radio on to block them out. And
it would turn its own volume up. Or, the station would switch and the CD
would change...even though i was careful to put it on repeat...I didn't
want the silence, the silence was frightening. The silence was menancing.
The silence wasn't silent, it kept telling me through the feeling that
it didn't want us here, that we were invading.</B>
<BR><B>Then things started falling off the walls. Posters, pictures, decorations,
whole shelves. We would wake up to the sound of thumping, of glass breaking
as things came falling down. And oddly enough, one or two times, a picture
would be shattered against the opposite wall, as if it had been thrown.</B>
<BR><B>Before and after school, i am home alone. It is unavoidable, really.
It was on one such occassion, conincidentally while i was finishing Stephen
King's IT, I began to hear laughing, just a chuckle at first. Again, home
alone, no body there. So, as i sat frozen to the couch, this chuckle began
to grow louder. It became an all-out laugh, then it became maniacal. It
was loud and...insane. Am I getting my point across? It wasn't a ha-ha
this is funny, It was a wild, crazy laugh. I was...frozen. I truly could
not move, I just sat there and listened to it.</B>
<BR><B>During the first few months, this was the extent of it...the dog
would overreact, things would fall, my stereo would act up, doors would
shut. But that's was all, and I am no weakling, i could handle it. I just
made sure that I stayed alone as little as possible. I never mentioned
it...no one did, it was an unspoken rule. But my younger sisters began
refusing to be left upstairs alone. Even my parents were wary of this feeling.
But still, there was just a sense of disbelief, of denial. We tried to
explain it away.</B>
<BR><B>And then it happened.</B>
<BR><B>I was awoken once again in the middle of the night, much as before.
But this time, it was to my mother screaming. Again, she was one of the
first to rationalize every happening. But this particular night, even she
could not explain the cold hand that ran along her back as she lay down
to sleep. My dad was away, which he often is due to his job.There was no
one in the house but myself, mom, and my sisters...and we were all in our
respective beds.</B>
<BR><B>So we moved from the feeling and from being touched indirectly through
our belongings, to being physically touched. Since then, I too have had
a similiar experience...in bed one night, early for a change, i felt a
hand move the hair away from my face. Just brush it away. But unlike mom,
this hand didn't frighten me...for the first time since I actually admitted
that something supernatural existed in our house, I wasn't afraid of it.
I was reminded of my grandfather's touch, when i was a little girl. That
was the first and only night that I have slept completely sound, without
any fear, in this new house. But it vanished as quickly as it had come,
because things only got freakier.</B>
<BR><B>I had visions, i suppose, just glimpses out of the corners of my
eyes. I would write them off as paranoia, but it is too real. Too real,
to see the black shape moving towards the closed front door and vanishing
through. Just a glimpse, mind you, so i can never be sure of what it is.
Perhaps it is just paranoia...and I know that none of my friends believe
me. I tell the story now, a year and a half, perhaps a little more, at
parties to get a laugh. But anyone, even the staunchest skeptic, who steps
within these walls admits that there is something strange about this new
house.</B>

<BR><B>The Shelter Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: angelface15_1984@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;This is a true story. You can call me Amanda and I am 18 years
old. It</B>
<BR><B>wasn't too long ago when this happened. About June of 2002. I was
at the</B>
<BR><B>homeless shelter in my bed having trouble sleeping. Nothing I did</B>
<BR><B>worked. Well, the girls in my room liked to keep the door closed
so that</B>
<BR><B>the lobby light wouldn't come on. It was getting well past midnight
and</B>
<BR><B>I noticed the door opened. Since everyone was asleep I knew it wasn't</B>
<BR><B>one of the girls. I turned my head over and saw an old lady hobbling</B>
<BR><B>into the room. She was African American with grey in her hair. She</B>
<BR><B>looked like a bag lady you see on T.V more or less. Well, I watched
her</B>
<BR><B>go onto the other side of me and stand there. I was in an ill mood
so I</B>
<BR><B>told her that floorspace, people who slept in the lobby when there
were</B>
<BR><B>no beds available, were allowed in the rooms. She started to say</B>
<BR><B>something, but for the life of me I don't know what. I mean I heard
what</B>
<BR><B>she said and I answered her, but the next morning I could not remember</B>
<BR><B>what she said, all I could remember is that her lips moved and what</B>
<BR><B>happened after that. Anyway, So after I answered her I turned my
head</B>
<BR><B>for a moment, hoping that she would catch the drift to leave the
room.</B>
<BR><B>When she didn't budge I turned around and her head was cocked backwards</B>
<BR><B>and blood was pouring down her forehead, into her mouth, and down
her</B>
<BR><B>chin. She had this look of extreme pain and terror. I pulled the
blanket</B>
<BR><B>over my head and waited a couple of seconds. when I looked back
she was</B>
<BR><B>gone.</B><B></B>
