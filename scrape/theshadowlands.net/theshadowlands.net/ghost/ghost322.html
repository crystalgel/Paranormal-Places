family and I believe that we live in a haunted house.<span

Northwood’s) almost six years ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
that time, my four children were ages 7, 5, 2 and 2 months.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

will never forget my first “experience” in this house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It happened about two weeks after we moved
in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My two oldest were at school, my 2
year old son was playing in his bedroom and my baby was napping in her
crib.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I decided to take a shower.
However, I left the bathroom door opened so that I could hear my son and/or
baby if they needed me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was only in
the shower for a couple of minutes when I heard my son talking in-depth to
someone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What was really strange about
it was he would say things and then pause as if someone were talking back to
him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>At first I figured that the baby
had awakened and he was probably keeping her company until I got out of the
shower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Upon
getting out of the shower however, I noticed my little boy running past the
bathroom coming from the opposite direction of his and his baby sisters’
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was running away from the
direction of the kitchen and the basement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I thought his behavior a little strange, so I asked him what he had been
doing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His response caused goosebumps to
say the least.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He looked up at me and
said, “I was talking to the little boy who lives in the basement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He wants to know what we are doing in his
house”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>That
incident marked the beginning of many strange occurrences in our house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>None of them bad, just very strange.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We do not feel threatened or uncomfortable,
although when we used to rent the upstairs out to people they had uncomfortable
and unpleasant experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There
have been way too many experiences to write them all down here.<span

just let me know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

parents left), but again there was nothing there. At </span><st1:time

font-family:Arial;color:white'> I heard noises again coming from the basement.
I went down to check out what was making the noise and as I was walking down
the stairs I saw a shadowy figure standing by the laundry room, staring at me.
I tried to move, but nothing happened. I couldn't see the figures face only the
outline, but I could tell it was a boy (around the age of 17-19). I closed my
eyes to make sure I wasn't imagining anything, but when I opened them the
figure was still there. I realized that I could finally move my fingers and I
immediatly reached and turned on the light. I could still see the figure, but
then it disappeared in a flash. I never saw the figure again. The rest of the
night I talked with my friends online, telling them what had just happened.
None of them believed me, but ever since then when I read ghost hauntings
online, my mind recalls that night in the basement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was once an occupant (97-98) in one of the rooms in the old 'white cottage'
that held the older children on grounds. This establishment, as I found out
while I was there, used to house orphans and sick children in the past. Most of
the children had polio, or other life threatening diseases. One night, I had to
go to the bathroom, and it was just about </span><st1:time Minute="0" Hour="2"><span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'> or so. I woke and sat
up in bed, frozen. I was petrified after hearing young children running down
the hallway, laughing and playing it seemed. It sounded so real, like the feet
were actually TOUCHING the floor, but I know the cottage I was in had no
children that young. The noises I heard finally trailed off, and I got the
courage to go out into the hall, and saw not a thing, just darkness. I ran down
the hall to the woman who was on staff for that evening. She didn't hear
anything, but told me that when she made her rounds upstairs, it was very scary
because she would hear doors open and close behind her, but no one was awake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

another instance, one summer night, it was humid and still, with no wind. There
were swings outside my window, about a few feet away near the wooded area. I
saw the swing go back and forth by itself, and was really frightened by this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

1997 I bought a house at 4209 10th Ave. In Chattanooga, TN. I have since sold
the house. The first night I stayed in the house I heard, what sounded like children
run up the stairs and down the hall on the second floor. On other occasions I
also had some strange thing happen like the my sons bed shook violently on day
when I was upstairs cleaning, and on night we came home and found ketchup and
mustard on the kitchen floor but the containers were still full and in the
fridge. My children have seen an old woman in a red dress at night with a knife
in her hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
following happened on Dec. 4th 2002 on my 40th birthday. It was on a Thursday.
I took the day off work and my girlfriend and I visited the Queen Mary. We
started our tour in the Engine Room. There were probably only 2 or 3 dozen
people on the ship that day and we had the engine room to ourselves for at least
an hour and a half. It was wonderful, no one else around. I had seen
documentaries about the young man who had died in the engine room and wanted
very much to see the place where he was crushed by a water tight door, #13. We
were about finished in the engine room and I was surprised/disappointed I
hadn't stumbled onto the spot yet. I was walking down a gangway in shaft alley
when all of a sudden I got the most horrible feeling of dread and terror. I saw
the escalator up ahead and started walking faster to get out of there. The air
felt heavy and dense, suffocating. I walked about 20-30 steps and finally
turned around expecting to see my girlfriend right behind me. Instead she was
still aways back, bent over reading something. I was thinking *** come on,
let's g let's get out of here*** I walked a few steps back toward her and the
feelings of fear and foreboding were intense. She finally caught up to me and
the atmosphere lightened somewhat. I said to her&quot;you know, a guy was
killed down here...&quot;. She replied &quot;I know, I was just reading a
plaque about it (where it happened) right there in that doorway&quot;. Here I
was in the spot the whole time and didn't even know it except for a very strong
emotional reaction. Perhaps it was John Pedder sharing his last few moments of
life with me, the emotions he felt as he was being crushed to death. Maybe he
will share it with you too if you're open to the experience. He took me totally
by surprise, however.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Later
in the day we were up in the center of the ship standing near an elevator,
trying to decide where to go next. We were at least 20 feet from the elevator
when the door opened and closed all by itself. No one got on or off, no one was
in it and no one else was around except us. At the time I didn't think much of
it. Probably just an electric short or something. Now I wonder different, like
maybe all the stories ARE true. Maybe The RMS Queen Mary really IS haunted. I'm
inclined to think it is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
is kind of hard to explain.. but here it goes! I used to live not too far out
in the woods, but it was out there, so we had one of them little motion
detector porch lights for just in case. Well, me, my sister, and my momma were
all sitting in the living room that night, watching TV. Well, I just so happen
to look up at the window, and there is someone standing in our window, but for
some reason, the porch light was NOT on. Our uncle hadn't died that long ago,
and strange stuff had been happening around our house, so my momma hollared,
&quot;Damn you Tim, quit aggrivating us!&quot;, and all of a sudden the face
disappeared. Another day, me and my sister were the only two people at home,
and all of a sudden for NO reason at all the blow dryer came on, not that
strange. But the our computer would ALWAYS type stuff, you could hear the keys
moving, on its own, nobody would be around. The mouse would move, and my momma
would always tell my uncle Tim to go away, and it would stop. These strange
happenings followed us when we moved from that house. Hes been dead for 4 years
now, and the strange things haven't happened in about a year and a half. My
sister and his daughter had a wreck one night, and the car came really close to
flipping (the were on two wheels going around a curve), and the seat belts did
not lock that night, and nothing happened to them. They say it was him watching
over them. But this is ghost encounter, not that strange...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>On
March 2, 2001 one of my very good friends died in a car accident on his way to
school. Ryan was an awesome person and friend. Before he died we joked that if
the other person died that we would come back and mess with the other. After
Ryan died I would periodically go through old letters and e-mails that he had
written to me. Then I noticed yellow butterflies appearing on significant days.
Like, on the day that Ryan died I would see a yellow butterfly . Then at my
grandfathers funeral, they were folding the flag to give to my grandmother and
a yellow butterfly came and flew right in front of me. So, I always say that
when I see a yellow butterfly that it is Ryan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I would also have dreams about him but, he would never speak in them. He
would just be there. I finally had a dream about 2 1/2 years later where he
talked to me. We were in an airport, and he told me that he would always be in
my heart and that he loved me. I know that dream was very important because I
was just getting out of a long relationship and asked him for some support. I
guess that was my support. I also read in some stories that when people pass
away they have to &quot;work&quot; to get<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>their voice. I guess that is why it took Ryan 2 years for him to talk to
me. The real reason that I am writing this is because I always asked Ryan to
come visit me and talk to me. After the dream in the airport I knew that he was
here with me. One night I woke up and looked out my bedroom door.( My bed faces
the door and when the door is open I can see into the kitchen.) Anyway, I
looked out the room and saw a figure in front of the refrigerator. It was dark
and I couldn't really see details. I obviously got scared and turned over the
other way. I looked at the clock and noticed that it was 5:18. Then I
remembered that it was the 2nd. Ryan died three years and one month ago this
very morning. I turned back around and looked toward the kitchen. The figure
was still standing there. I did notice that he was smiling. So I waved quickly
to it and then turned around again. So, I gave myself a couple of minutes to let
everything sink in and realized that it had to be Ryan. So, when I turned
around again he was still standing there, smiling at me. So, I decided to get
up and walk towards it. I always wanted Ryan to come visit me and I didn't want
to be scared anymore. So, as I walked toward the kitchen I had to adjust my
eyes because the light outside of my apartment shines into the kitchen. When I
walked into the kitchen the figure disappeared. I did remember that the figure
was wearing a cut off shirt and athletic shorts. The most unique thing about
this was the hat that the he was wearing. Ryan always wore his hat a little to
the side (all the hockey boys did). The guy in my kitchen had a hat on, which
was a little to the side, just as Ryan would were it. The other detail was that
Ryan went to the gym the night before he died. I know that Ryan came to see me
that night and was just trying not to scare me so, he kept his distance. I have
decided that next time Ryan pays me a visit I will not be scared. After all
this is all I have wished for since his passing. He was just doing what he said
he would do... messing with me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have never responded to a website like this before and I do not “fancy myself a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
family visited Rose Hall several years ago while on a cruise – this was one of
the excursions offered by the Cruise Line. My group consisted of My Husband and
myself, my two teenage children and my teenage niece.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The house is beautiful. It sits on a small
hill where it can be seen for miles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
tour begins in the basement “tavern” where you are offered something to drink.
As soon as my son and I crossed the threshold, we became physically ill.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The nausea increased as the tour continued
through the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tour guide held
nothing back as she described each bedroom, who died in that room and how Annie
was suspected of killing them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were
encouraged to take pictures of the mirror that reportedly sometimes displayed
Annie’s image when film was developed. There is also a chandelier in the house
that displays an image when film is developed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There is a display of these for you to judge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When my neice (who is quite the cutup) leaned
out the balcony window – yes the same window from which Annie used to watch her
slaves, my son and I ran out of the house so we wouldn’t – well – soil Annie’s
floor – we were that nauseous.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once we
were outside the nausea went away. It didn’t even come back when we toured the
grounds including the site of Annie’s final resting place.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My son and I were quite disturbed by the
whole experience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was 17 at the time,
6 ft 4 – 250 lb very macho guy…and it really scared him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He told me later<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(and not to anyone else in my family) that he
felt a message like someone was trying to communicate with him while in the
house<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>telling him not to feel sorry for
the men, they deserved to die. I didn’t experience this…I will always remember
the awful nausea. We have been to many old places – Blarney Castle, Tower of
London, England’s Moors – but we have NEVER experienced anything like we did at
Rose Hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
moved into a Trailer that had been in this spot for YEARS. Well one night when
going to bed, my mother and her boyfriend heard a noise in the kitchen, upon
entering they saw a little white ball rolling around in a circle, and a child
laughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
the laid back down they looked out of the bedroom toward the front of the
trailer and saw a woman dressed in a white gown, kind of like something from
the 1800's. She was standing by the front door. When she turned to open the
door mom said you could see she was pregnant. From that point on you could walk
through the trailer and get near a air duct and there would be a big wet,
sticky spot in the carpet when NOTHING was spilled there. I also woke up one
morning and pages of our bible was torn out and shoved under the couch, to beat
it all the pages that were torn out were about not commiting adultry and stuff.
We asked the landlord if he knew of a death in that spot from the past or
anything and he said his family had owned that property since the early 1800's
so I dont know but it was spooky!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

me in the trailer park I lived in. I had been there many times and never felt

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>anything
was wrong with the house, until her and her mother had told me about the
strange <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>things
that had happened and the back story of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

moving <o:p></o:p></span></p>

being <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>a
skeptic and all, and did so until one night. I stayed over like many times

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>nothing
unusual happened until I laid down to go to bed. I slept in her sister bed who
was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Which made no sense because the entire hallway was carpeted. They would come

about just <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>getting
up and running home. When the footsteps stopped for what seemed to be the last <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I started to relaxed and tried to go to sleep again. Then about 3 minutes later
I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>opened
my eyes to see that all I could see directly in front of me was complete

was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>couldn't.
I couldn't even breath and I can't tell you if it was due to the fact that I
was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>so

Finally <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
managed to jump out of the bed and the minute I did so I was able to breath and
scream <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>again.
I yelled out my friends name and curled up behind her on her bed before I was
able <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>to
go to sleep again. Apparently at about the same time the same thing happened to

a old prison that is in north Jefferson city (actually right outside city
limits) a few of us thought it would be fun to go in there at night. we took
candles and cross's and the appropriate séance stuff inside and began. There
was old pull shades on the windows at the end of the hall. The lights started
flickering on and off. (the power to that place has been off for at least a
decade) and the windows snapped down and up. We all got up and ran outside but
a friend was still inside she said she sat there until a guard helped her out.
when we went back towards the entrance to get her she was smiling and saying
thank you. it was the weirdest and most unforgettable experience I have ever
had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that my mom and dad built. it was not an old house...it was brand new.<span

OK here is the story.... time goes on and at the age of 15 i'm
writing/improvising a musical passage in my room......and i get a funny feeling
someone is watching me. it intensified so much that i started drooling over my
instrument.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>so i turn around and there
stands a very tall man with a top hat and a trench coat just standing there, he
floats down the hall with the trench coat swaying behind.<span

time goes on i see the same figure in the hall for several weeks. he always
looked like a shadow not a real person and he never made a sound.<span

until.....i made an A-plus on an algebra test and came home from school and
interrupted my mom and my sister with my test score. my sister startes yelling
at me for interrupting when my mom grasps and yells &quot;oh there is a man on
the sofa&quot;, my sister and i at the same time say &quot;he's always in the
hall!&quot; and then my mom, sister and i describe him to a T.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the man never left the hall until that day.
we all three have agreed on that, and we all three described him, which is the
only reason why i believe in what i saw. we asked my dad and he said we we're
crazy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>what i saw was real or i would

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
following incident happened to me when I was about 12 or 13 years old (I am now
45). During the 1970s, my mother and I would spend our summers at the Jersey
shore in Wildwood Crest. We would work at my uncle and aunt's restaurant from
5:00 PM to sometimes 2:00 AM. Many times during the day I was alone in our rented
apartment because my mom would get up to go food shopping or run other errands
before we had to go to work. The apartment was on top of the owner's house and
we had rented this same place for about 7 or 8 years. It was a small place with
no living room, 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, and a large eat-in kitchen. All the
rooms were accessible from a main hallway which ran along side each room. One
Saturday afternoon in late August, while my mom was away doing her chores, I
decided to watch a pre-season football game in the front bedroom. It was the
only room with a television set. I sat on the bed and watched the game for a
while until I became hungry. I went into the kitchen (which was the furthest
room from the bedroom) to make myself something to eat. While I was walking
down the hall toward the kitchen to prepare my snack I heard the TV changing
channels in the front bedroom. You must remember that this was the early 1970s
and the changing of channels was had distinctive sound. You had to physically
turn the dial and it made a loud clicking sound. I was too scared to go back to
the room which I had just left, so I continued into the kitchen. I waited there
for a while and tried to figure out what had just happened. I was hoping that I
was mistaken about that sound and that when I would go back into the bedroom
the game would be on. I cautiously went back up the hall into the front bedroom
and saw that the channel had indeed been changed!! I ran out onto the porch and
waited until my mother came home. That's all there is to my story...it's not
much but I am certain that it happened. I could never figure out an explanation
and I never told my mom about it. I've had no other experiences since that
(thankfully!).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was the subject of ahaunting in my last house. At first i was in denial having
seen it and heard it . I asked for help when my alarm was being set off
repeatedly on the same night .Statues i had would fall from the window ledges,
cold air in the centre of my face on a hot summer night ,a feeling of gloom and
sadness always present in the house and so many other things that i put down to
paranoia. Then one day irecorded my own story on a tape it would not rewind nor
would it play. The very next day i told my brother that it was useless to use
as it did not work, to prove this i tried to rewind it and it worked, only my
voice was in the background and a deep baritone voice in the foreground. I was
so afraid ispoke to people i knew and to a phsycic who all heard the voice even
the priest. I also had a mirror from adressing table that had been in the same
position fall on my back. WHEN I MOVED FROM THE BACK BED ROOM TO THE FRONT,
THAT IS WHEN IT STARTED.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also had the
sound of amillion marching feet above me in my attic,the next night a flock of
birds so loud that really believed i had a nest of some sort up there , there
was nothing.I sought help of a medium through the spiritualist church and he
told me all i knew that i did indeed have haunting, a man who had died suddenly
and did not want me there.I was totally traumatised, i also lived within twelve
of a sub power sation. Now that i have left acouple have it and they have
children. I would hate them to ever see and hear the things that i did.When it
staryed i was very ill but as i got stronger the presence grew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what I remembered she passed away around September of 1985. Shortly after her
death we started to experience strange things happening around the house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm a HUGE believer in ghosts and spirits
always have been, long before Grandma Betty passed away. I've read a lot of
true ghost stories. My experiences weren't bad or scary and for a while we
weren't even really sure if it was Grandma Betty or not, we weren't sure who it
was!! Here are some of the stories and experiences I would like to share.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
of those things that would happen around the house was the TV shutting off by
itself always during dinner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the 4 of
us would be sitting around the table, all of a sudden we would hear the
&quot;click&quot; of the TV, and it would be off!!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first couple of times it was very creepy
to us, and then my mom would start to laugh because my sister and I would be
flipping out!! My dad on the other hand is somewhat of a non-believer, he
always came up with an excuse, every time something strange would happen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another
time I came home from school, no one else was home or had been home pretty much
all day, both my parents worked at the time, I went to the bathroom which was
on the second floor of the house, and I noticed a blob of shampoo in the middle
of the bathroom floor. The weird thing about this was there were no shampoo
bottles tipped over anywhere, and it was in the MIDDLE of the floor. No where
close to the bathtub. I thought how strange!!! Instead of cleaning it up, I
left it there to show my sister!! Shortly after my sister came home from
school, I told her I had to show her something, so I took her upstairs and
showed her the blob of shampoo that was in the middle of the floor!! Both of us
thought it was so strange!! We even asked our other 2 sister's if either one of
them came over during the day and spilled some shampoo and forgot to clean it.
They both said no, and asked us why. So we proceeded to tell them what had
happened. We told my parents, and once again my dad said maybe it was the dog
that did it!!! We had a huge sheepdog at the time, everything strange that
happened was blamed on our poor dog by my father!!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another
time in the middle of the night I was awakened by a huge crash sound coming
from the bathroom!! All the bedrooms were on the second floor of the house, so
I got up and slowly opened my bedroom door, my father and my sister did the
same thing, so my dad went to check things out. He goes into the bathroom turns
the light on, I said to myself, it must've been the medicine cabinet that fell,
that's how loud this crash was!! My dad said there was NOTHING!!!!! There was
nothing on the floor, in the bathtub, in the sink, anywhere!!!! That was very
strange!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
of the most bizarre things that happened was at night time, I would hear
breathing in my room!! Like someone was sleeping with me!! Sometimes it would
literally wake me out of a sound sleep because it was so loud!!! I would get so
scared that I would lay very still hoping whoever this was would go away. It
wouldn't last all night, but it probably lasted for a good 20 minutes or so!!
It used to happen so often that after a while it wouldn't even phase me
anymore, I would actually tell it to shut up!! And it would too!! So one day at
dinner I finally got the nerve to say something to my parent's and my sister
about what's been happening. All I said was &quot;I have something to tell you
guys, I hear breathing in my room at night!!&quot; Well my sister drops her
fork and looks at me and quietly says, &quot;me too!!&quot; Then we both
started to flip out!! But once again according to my father we probably heard the
dog breathing from the hallway!!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It
was Christmas morning, I was still sleeping when I heard all this commotion
from downstairs, so I got up and there was my mother, my father, and my sister
looking thru all this stuff in my parent's garage. I asked them what was going
on, and my mom said listen, so I stood there and very quietly I heard what
sounded like a music box playing Silent Night. My mother told me that used to
be Grandma Betty's favorite Christmas song. They were looking for some kind of
music box in the garage, but didn't find anything!!!!!!!! We never owned a
music box that played Christmas songs!!! So after it played the whole song it
stopped. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
last thing that ever happened in the house was one night my mom was in the
living room by herself watching TV, she turned the TV off and just sat on the
couch and closed her eyes, and then she felt like someone sat down next to her.
She kept her eyes closed and moved her hand over to feel if something was
there. Nothing!! She continued to sit there with her eyes shut, and then she
said she felt this presence next to her get up off the couch and then it was
gone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
realized it was Grandma Betty, we always had a feeling it was her, but we were
never 100% sure until we heard the mysterious &quot;music box&quot; playing
Silent Night that Christmas Day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
remember telling a friend about my stories and when I told her about how my mom
felt something or someone sit down next to her on the couch, my friend said to
me, &quot;she's gone.&quot; I said &quot;what&quot;? And she proceeded to tell
me that she believes that was Grandma Betty's way of finally saying good bye to
my mom. She was right, from then no strange happenings ever happened again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
have only told this to a<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>few people. I
don't think they understood what happened any more than I did. This happened
about 20 years ago. My husband and I lived in an upstairs apartment over a
garage. It was early in the morning when I heard sounds coming from our bedroom
window. There was banging and loud whistling. When I looked out the window I
saw a painter in white overalls and a white cap, putting up a tall ladder
beside my window. He claimbed up to the window and started painting. All the
time whistling. I went into the bathroom to get dressed then went into the
kitchen to make coffee. I could still hear the whistling. I decied to take the
painter a cup of coffee. I went to the window with a cup of coffe in my hand,
held the cup up as if to ask do you want a cup of coffee? the painter smiled
and tipped his hat. When I got to the outside where the painter was. There was
no painter! No ladder! No imprint of the ladder legs in the wet ground! No sign
of any paint on the house!. I went next door to the landlord, with cup still in
hand, and asked where the painter went. The landlord said that no painter had
been hired to paint the house. I don't know who or what happened that day.
Months later I was talking to my grandmother and told her about what happened.
She looked strange and got real quite, then she asked me if the man had been
whistling &quot; Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me&quot;
when I said yes she said that it had to be my grandfather. I didn't know him
but he had been a painter and loved to whistle that song when painting.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have never seen him again, but the memory
is still so clear even today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi,
I would like to add to the story of Cerro Gordo (Bunkhouse), California.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
visited there in June of 1999 and stayed in a room of the old Bunkhouse.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I stayed in the first bedroom on the
right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only other person in the
Bunkhouse that night was the caretaker and he was in the last room on the left.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Bunkhouse is on a hill and has no outside
porch light and no electricity once the generator is turned off for the
night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To enter the Bunkhouse you have
to walk up a dark unlighted hill and open a screen door and then the front
door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>After I closed my door and got in
bed the caretaker turned off the generator and entered his room and closed his
door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>While
trying to fall asleep I heard footsteps in the hallway outside my room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No doors had opened in let anyone into the
hallway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I heard the footsteps the
second time I started to panic and was breathing rapidly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was so scared I couldn't reach out from
under the covers to grab my glasses or uncover my head for air.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I couldn't turn on a light, there was no
electricity!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>And I was so scared I couldn't
scream for the caretaker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All I could do
was whisper &quot;go away, don't come in&quot; over and over. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Then
I heard<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a noise, like sratching, above
my head on the wall by the bed..I couldn't move or roll over.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was frozen in place.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wanted &quot;it&quot; to think I was
asleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After what seemed like an
eternity, i fell asleep from exhaustion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
next morning I told the caretaker about the footsteps in the hallway.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He swore to me that he never left his room
during the night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I then told the owners
about the noise in the wall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They told
me it was no mouse or rat in the wall because the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>interior walls are solid 3/4 inch wood.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And they weren't surprised by my story!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Thanks
for letting me give you more info about this location. People need to know that
it is NOT JUST<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>THE LAST ROOM ON THE

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
would like to report my house as being haunted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>and it is in one of the older neighborhoods
of St. Petersburg, Florida near Crescent Lake and the Old NorthEast
neighborhoods.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My house is now 80 years
old and I'm sure a number of things have happened with its occupants over the
years, but I bought the house in 2002 and several occurrences have happened
since then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>December
2002-- While preparing to move into the house, my girlfriend and I were
painting many of the rooms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She chose to
paint the old nursery in order to make it into her studio and our guest room,
but she couldn't get the door to stay closed to keep the heat in unless she
used something to block the door shut.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After she left for work one night, I walked in that room to see if I
could do something with that door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
closed the door and it stayed shut just fine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We knew the ceiling fan didn't work but the light did, but after the
door stood shut for me I could hear a slight humming.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finding the noise was coming from the ceiling
fan, I discovered that the fan was stuck but the motor was trying to turn
anyway, and I wondered how long it would have taken for that motor to perhaps
overheat and catch something on fire?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>January
2003-- A month later my girlfriend was getting out of bed and was struck by the
overwhelming scent of an old lady's floral-scented perfume, of which we had
nothing of that sort in the house, the mattress and box springs were brand new,
and we knew it wasn't anything we'd moved into the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>July
24th, 2004-- During a birthday party at the house one evening, a friend decided
to use the upstairs washroom and when he came back down, asked me if there's
&quot;anyone else&quot; living there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
said, &quot;Yes, what happened?&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
explained that as he was leaving the washroom he felt something bump into his
arm as if a person was passing by him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When I asked where it happened, he told me, and it was right outside the
bedrooms where the first two incidences happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Late
August, 2004-- As I was typing on my laptop on the bed that evening, I clearly
saw two small, white lights, almost like eyes, appear off the side of my
bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I looked directly at them they
quickly dropped back down out of view.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
leapt over the side of the bed and looked underneath, but there was nothing
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>September
28th, 2004-- A friend who has been able to sense spirits well all her life
visited the house, and is sure she could tell where the old lady was, as well
as the spirit of a young girl... both in the room where the door wouldn't stay
shut back in December of 2002.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
is an incident that happened where I work.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I am a nurses aide, meaning I do everything a nurse does, just for less
pay, anyway this story is about one of my favorite residents. I am not legally
allowed to say names or locations, nothing identifying, but I can tell it in
general.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
lady came in with terminal cancer, a sharp tongue and a wonderful sense of
humor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was such a comedian.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hardly ever had a bad day until the end, and
she was always playing pranks on her husband of 60 years and the staff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
day she died the family was all heading down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She had been struggling since the day before, but when the end stage
breathing began and she began to severely mottle we called the family. By nine
thirty in the morning she was surrounded by family, sons, daughters,
grandchidren, great grandchildren and great great grandchildren.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were waiting for her husband who was
coming from the other end of the city and his own doctors appointment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Instead
of asking the staff to leave the family asked us to stay if we could, so the
nurses made some arrangements and two of us wee allowed to stay, i was one of
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
were all surrounding the bed and touching her and telling her it was ok, she
could go when suddenly she did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her
chest rose once more then nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
waited to see if she would start again, she had in the past, she'd scared the
crap out of one of the students we had at the time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
partner went for the nurse manager to pronounce death and we all hugged each
other and cried. Her husband walked into the room virtually unnoticed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suddenly he was just there and he picked up
her hand to kiss it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We all fell silent
to alow him his moment of peace with her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The air felt super charged, like something special was about to
happen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Then the bedside lamp
flickered several times, it was a brand new lamp, so the connection wasn't the
problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her husband closed his eyes and
bowed his head, we could see his tears and were about to turn away out of
respect when his eyes grew wide and suddenly he chuckled softly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of us felt like a breeze blew by us,
really quick like.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the lamp
brightened again and the feeling of waiting was gone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He looked at me when we had to back up for
the nurse to pronounce death and he asked me if I had felt anything strange.I
told him I saw the lamp flicker and felt cold.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He told me that when he was trying not to cry he had felt something
touch his face the way his wife had touched him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was true, every day she would kiss him and
she would reach up and cup his right cheek in her hand.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then he would lean into it and kiss her palm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was their ritual every day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She died physically before he could get
there, but she waited around just long enough to say good bye to her husband. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
the staff, found out that a week later he followed her to the next life quietly
and in his sleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There
have been several strange and sometimes sad things that have happened where I
work, and I am convinced that we have our share of ghosts, we are a personal
care home, but that one was one of the most touching and I am glad I got a
chance to be a part of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
is absolutely true to the best of my recollection of the event that took place
when I was a child. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
occurrence happened when my grandma and I went to stay by her sister's house in
Alsip, Illinois right off of (115th and Cicero) for the weekend. This was
something we did every so often so she could spend time with her sisters and I
could visit with the cousins on my father's side. This was in the late eighties
around 87-88. My great aunt Rosie and her husband Henry, whom everyone called Red,
had owned the house since the late sixties. It was a typical tri level suburban
home with the basement stairs down off of the left side of the kitchen, and the
upstairs bedrooms and bathrooms off the kitchen on the right. There was always
something creepy about two sections of the house. The basement bathroom, and
the upstairs bedroom that was directly across from the upstairs bathroom. My
grandma told me she used to use that particular bedroom all the time when she
and her late husband would come stay the night. There was a picture of my great
grandparents in that room on the dresser that gave me the wiggins as well but
black and white photos tend to be somewhat creepy as a rule I guess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
grandma is quite a feisty lady, and if she finds something she likes, she
sticks with it. Hence that night when she was in the bathroom upstairs putting
pin curls in her hair. (A style that she rocks to this day). I was downstairs
in the living room with my great aunt Rosie, my great uncle Red, my other great
aunt Gloria, and my cousin Danny. We were watching a movie when we heard my
grandma let out a startled &quot;OHHH!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
is what she claims had happened. As I stated she was pin curling her hair and
looking in the mirror. She had her arms up to fasten the pin when she felt
someone standing just outside the doorway. She didn't bother to look, she just
started talking. &quot;If you have to pee Glor, just go ahead, I'm almost
done.&quot; No response. She waited a few seconds and finally gave up on the
pin and looked to the doorway. She says what she saw was a figure, impossible
to make out features as it consisted of a black wavy substance. It was thin,
which is why she had assumed it was my great aunt Gloria, as Rosie was rather
round and short. That is when she let out the &quot;OHHH!&quot; sound. The
figure seemed to melt back into that bedroom, and blended into the darkness
until it vanished. When we heard this my aunt Rosie yelled to my grandma
&quot;You okay Gray?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>(My
grandma's name is Grayce, for some reason Rosie has always called her Gray.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
grandma came down the stairs visibly startled, and rattled off her experience
at 100 miles an hour. She said she wasn't sure who or what that was but she
didn't feel it came to bear good tidings. We believed her, but no one thought
much of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Approximately
two weeks later Red died in his sleep. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Rosie
didn't mention anything about the figure that came to my grandma after that,
but my grandma insisted it had come to warn of death. Since then, her daughter,
my aunt/godmother, tragically passed away at age 47 of kidney failure. Gloria
passed away five years after that, and her brother Bruce the following year. It
may all be a coincidence, but my grandma insists she was visited by an angel of
death that night, and I believe her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Paranormal
activity seems to run rampant in my family. I have story after story, let me
know if you'd like to hear more I would love to tell someone…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

thinks my house is haunted, Im no exception. This story<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>happened
today October 14/04 and totally creeped me out. I've had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

before, as I wrote to you last time something along these<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>lines
happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
have a 17 year old cockerspaniel named Pebbles. I've had her since I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>was
4 years old. She's a great puppy and still quite with it, although<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>she's
deaf now. Today as I was dressing for work I heard a scratching<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>on
my bedroom door and of course I thought it was her, but it was so<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>strange
as NEVER comes downstairs, its hard for her to get up and down<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>the
stairs. But since I was the only one home, I assumed she needed to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>go
outside and just couldn't wait. So<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
open the door to let her in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>so
I can just quickly finish dressing and she suddenly turns at my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>door
and starts<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>growling
towards the other end of the basement(our basement is shaped<o:p></o:p></span></p>

an &quot;L&quot; and my bedroom is where the top of the &quot;L&quot; would be)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>...since
she's deaf, she<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>usually
turns (jumps in fact) when you tap her on the ass, but I did<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>that
like 4 times<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>and
she wouldn't turn towards me...it was WIERD. finally, I shook her<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>and
she half turned but kept looking the other way too, growling as<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>she
did. It was scaring the shit outta me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So I grabbed my sweater,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>looked
towards where she was looking, saw nothing but felt the need to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

up the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
followed me, but slowly and kept turning around and growling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>So
I grabbed my shoes cause I did not want to be that close to the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stairs and they are right at the main entrance of the house,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>so
I figured I'd go out the side door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>she
only goes out the house thru the front door, but I couldn't leave<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a child my family often gathered at our house for holidays. One time<span

all the children present we were posed on our sofa with the smaller children
setting on the older one's laps and some standing behind the sofa so that every
one could get into the picture. being the oldest one there I was setting in the
middle of everyone holding another child on my lap when something really
strange happened. I felt a pain in my finger and looked down and saw a small
withered looking hand with talons where fingernails should have been. I don't
recall seeing anything attached to the hand. I just saw the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>hand. and it clawed at my hand and made a
gouge in my little finger, causeing it to bleed. Of course I screamed bloody
murder and everyone jumped off the couch, and the adults took the cushions off
the sofa and turned ut up on it's side and never found anything that could have
caused the wound. I still have the scar in the form of a perfectly shaped
capitol letter A on the little finger of my right hand. I can't say exactlly
how old I was at the time but I was between age 5 and 10 years of age. That's
not the only thing that happened in that house to myself and several other

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi
I'm 17 yrs old. I live in Houston, Tx. When i was 14 yrs old I was sleeping in
the living room. I went back to my room for a brief moment to get a pillow.
When I came back to the living room I saw that there was a woman all in white
just sitting on the other couch we have. She was beautiful and had curly hair
and yes, she had wings too. She was just sitting there with a smile on her face
watching every move a made and then when I got to the couch i was sleeping on,
she watched me go to sleep. I felt so safe around her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Room Mate<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
happened when I was 13. It was 3 in tha morining and i was the only one up at
that time. I was in the living room watching movies and drinking orange juice.
It started to get cold in the living room so i got up to turn off the fan. When
i was reaching for the fan switch i heard a voice of a lil gurl. the lil girl
said, &quot;Ana come play with us&quot; then i heard the gurl giggle. When i
looked behind me there was nobody then i looked to the tv to see that there was
no tape on and even the tv wasn't on. The direction that the voice was coming
from was from a wall in the corner of the living room. I wasn't really scared i
was more like freaked that i actually got to hear a ghost call my name. I think
she is the one that plays with my hair and tickles me when im asleep. I haven't
heard her since. But she still plays with my hair and tickles me while i sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Cambridge Ohio and I have been all my life. (19yrs). When I was 17, my friends
and I was interested in spirits/ghosts/apparations and so we had bought some
equiptment to help us go ghosthunting. we had heard about the woman in white
located in the Northwood cemetery and we thought that would be the best place
to go. So on the night of September 18th, 2002 we decided to try and get the
the ghost on camera. We had gone about 7:30pm and had been there for an hour or
so waiting and hoping we see her. It started getting late, later than what we
all thought, but we didnt care we were going to see her that night! Well, I
started to feel somewhat dizzy, I had this weird feeling, like I wanted to
start crying? I didnt understand that? So I just kept walking with my other 2
buddies, but as I kept walking I started feeling even more emotional, tears
started to drip from eyes. My friends looked at me and said whats the matter
and I said I didnt know? At that point we were smack dab in the middle of the cemetery.
I wanted to go home at that point! So we started walking towards the car, and
then I started hearing these cries, cries of little children, all around me. I
asked if my friends could hear them, but they thought I was just messing with
them, but one glance at the freighten look on my face they started believing.
But they couldnt hear the cries? Only me? Why me? The children seemed as if
they followed me, the cries got louder and louder. We finally got to the car
and by this point I couldnt hear the cries any longer, I dont even remember
them stopping... I wasnt really all there, I was crying so bad, Emotionally
beaten...by torment, the cries imbeded my head all night. I felt somewhat
better once I got home, I felt like id been mentally raped. I ended up selling
all my ghost equiptment over the next couple of weeks on Ebay and I will never
go to Northwood ever again. Ive tried telling people but all they do is laugh
and make fun. My friends were there they know what they saw, I know what I
heard, I felt how they felt. The white women,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I believe she is there, but I believe there are more, more intense
things than a woman in white, what is making the children cry in Northwood
Cemetery? If you are interested in hearing more, or even wanna come check it
out for yourself , I would love that.... hopefully what happend to me will
happen again. So everyone will then believe me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was 11 years old my Grandmother passed away two weeks before Christmas in
1990<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>while we lived in Florida. I was
very close to her and she had this chair that she had for years, before we even
moved there. Well on Christmas day of 1990 my brother, who was 17 at the time,
and I went to the living room and all we could smell was our Grandmother. We
then noticed that her chair was rocking just the way she always rocked when she
was alive. Of course this freaked me out, my parents came running out and they
saw the chair moving but couldn't smell her. They thought we had moved the
chair. Well about 4 years later We moved back to Massachusetts and I was
staying with my Aunt while my parents packed our house in Florida and moved
everything up here. One night I was in my cousins room with her listening to
the radio and all of a sudden the volume was really low. We went to check it
and the dial was turned all the way down. Neither of us was near the radio and
there was no one else in the room. So we didn't think to much of it then all of
a sudden my cousin started crying. I asked her what was wrong and she said she
could smell our Grandmother. I started to smell it to and next thing we know
the stereo was louder than anything. My aunt came in yelling at us to turn it
down but almost as soo nas she was done yelling the volume went back down and she
could smell it to. I have since grown and started my own family and my 6 year
old daughter who had never even seen a picture of her great grandmother tells
me that she knows what she looks like and she has described her smell. I
finally took out a picture and showed it to her and she said that is the person
that talks to me, i can't understand her but she trys to talk to me. I started
talking to my daughter in French and she told me that is how my grandmother
speaks to her. She also said the woman's name is Terry, thats what she called
her the first time she saw her. My grandmothers name is Theresa. It was very
spooky but I finally realized that my grandmother was right, she will always be
there for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hello
i am currently 14 and live in California and just recently a few weird <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>things
have happend. The first happed in the summer that just passed of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>03'/04'
i was hanging out with my friends at a nearby school called <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>peninsula.
The school was said to be haunted, the main building which wasnt <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>very
big was quite old and so was the school. The building looked more like <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>a
home/store. My friends and i late at night sometimes would go to the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>school
and play hide and seek and tag in the dark. Now at one point i got <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>seperated
with my friends Paolo, and Ben (whom i was hiding with) and i was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>near
the old bulding. It is told that a woman died there ( i dont know how ) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>and
so i was creeping past when i looked up and a the second floor window, a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>very
faint white light with the slightest tint of green was eminating from <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>the
window along with the sound of a violin. Now normally i would say, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>&quot;someone
must be here late from the school staff, maybe a music teacher&quot; but <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>i
mean it was around like 12pm-1am and the light from the window wasnt a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>normal
light. At seeing that i loudly scream SH** and slowly backed away <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>body
numb in fear, and after i shouted the light got brighter and the violin <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>louder,
like it was approaching the window, I then proceeded to run off the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>school
grounds, now i also ran because there is someone who lives at the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>school,
a care taker (we have to be quiet and not wake him up or he will <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>call
the cops), now one would think it could have been him, but his cottage <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>he
lives at on the grounds is close to the bulding near the exit of school <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>grounds,
well as i was running i saw a light flip on in his home and just as <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>i
was leaving the school premise he opened the door to peer around. Later <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>when
i found my friends again (i waited for them outside of the school) when <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>we
were at my friends house they were talking about their hiding spots and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>one
of my friends mentioned the violin and light, and after that a couple <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>others
admitted to seeing it...so i wasnt the only one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
other other time: In my house there are normal odd occurances, creaking <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>floorboards
as if someone where walking, not sneaking, nor troding their way <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>through
my house, just walking at a normal pace, doors would open from time <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>to
time, see shadows move out of the corner of my eye, and hear thumping <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>from
all over, under the floor boards in my hallway (we have NO basement) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>and
from the walls, all this happened while i was alone. My mom belives <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>strongly
in the paranormal, yet i have not told her of this, and she has yet <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>to
encounter any of this stuff, but as i was saying. So every night i sleep <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>in
the living room (my bed is too small and room too small) and i was awoken <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>in
the early morning, The air around my upper body was lukewarm yet at my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>legs
toasty, yet as seconds past a heavy unseeable pressure was pressing <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>down
on my chest making me stuggle for breath and the air rapidly became <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>cold,
(now if you know me i sleep like a bear in hybernation getting <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>tranqed)
well that stuff didint bother me too much, but then in an instant <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>my
throat became fridgidly cold, and it felt as if someone grabed me by the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>throat,
then if felt as if i was being choked, my breathing restricted, my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>eyes
shot open and they opened as i was looking down and i saw a pale, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>semi-translucent
(more solid than not) hand at my throat, i was in a state <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>of
semi conciousness and i flailed my arms as if to get the attacker off me <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>and
flung my blanket into the far corner of the room and my eyes darted to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>across
the room as a shadowy figure of a averagly tall female with long <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>brown
hair was drifting backwards mouthing what seemed to be the words <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>&quot;sorry&quot;
now during the attack my body was numb and icy cold but as she <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>mouthed
what i thought to be sorry my body immediatly warmed and the numbing <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>ceased.
I fell back asleep almost immediatly as weird as it seems, and when <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>i
awoke my blanket was on me, and when i asked my mom if she did it the next <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
know your imagination can get away from you sometimes, But what I saw at the
trail that night I'll never forget. I'm your original 15 year old girl living
in a small town in Alabama called Athens where nothing goes on unless you're
trespassing or vandalizing. I had always heard tales about the
&quot;haunted&quot; trail that is 5 miles longs &amp; is part of a historical
mark for the Civil War(There is a train trestle that the war was faught on, on
the trail).I've never made it back to the trestle, and I kind of don't want to
from what I saw only 200 yards into the trail. It was your typical summer night
in Alabama, clear &amp; warm. Me &amp; a few of my friends decided to go
&quot;ghost hunting&quot;, Something we always do. I brought up the subject of
The Trail &amp; we were on our way immediately. It was around 11 p.m., Very
dark, &amp; Extremely Eerie at the trail, So eerie that it sent chills down our
backs. I had been to the trail many times before this certain night, But could
never bring myself to walk down it because of this gut feeling I had(W h I
would've stuck to it). There were 4 of us, &amp; we had 2 flashlights, so the
guys decided the girls should carry them. We started on our way down the trail
checking every birdhouse, tree, and sign we saw. We really didn't think we'd
see anything, Actually, we really hoped we WOULDN'T see anything. I was walking
in front while my girl friend walked slightly parallel to me &amp; the guys
were behind us. If anyone was going to see anything, it would be me. We got a
good ways down the trail, and I heard a weird noise and started shining my
light all around the place. The next thing I know, I'm shining my light on a
guy dressed in a light grey outfit, he looked like a Confederate Soldier from
those Civil War movies, like &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;. He was standing on the
left side tree line, and walked right in front of me, light shining on him
&amp; all, and walked into the right side tree line &amp; vanished. I started
screaming, my legs went numb, and I got this overwhelming feeling of someone
watching me. My girl friend who was behind me was not there anymore, nor were
the guys. They all saw what I saw, and started running back to the vehicles. I
ran back to the car also, and none of us talked on the way home. We all knew
what we saw, and we feared it. I will never go back to that trail, ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
Old Crow Inn is located in Danville, KY. It is the oldest stone house west of
the Alleghenies. It was built in 1780 and originally called the Barbee House.
It now serves as a bed &amp; breakfast. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A
few years back, my wife and I were to stay at the inn after attending an
evening performance at another historical site in Danville, The Pioneer
Playhouse. It was the early fall and as we returned for the night the air
suddenly turned cold and a fine, misty rain began to fall, accompanied by a low
fog that formed amongst the trees and shrubs on the grounds surrounding the
inn. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>If
you visit the inn's web site you will see a picture of the room we stayed in,
referred to as &quot;The Granary&quot;, a very quaint part of the house once
used to support the attached kitchen. In earlier times the kitchen had been
manned by a rather large, black lady who had subsequently been murdered (along
with her dog) by what was described as &quot;gypsies&quot;. (This, however, did
not occur at the inn but a few miles away. In addition, her murder and the
facts surrounding it would not be relayed to my wife and myself until the next
day.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>As
we prepared for bed I recall peering out the barred window above the bed,
thinking how cold and damp it looked and what a good night it was to be inside.
But as the night progressed I became very restless, unable to completely fall
asleep, seemingly remaining in a state of semi-consciousness. At one point I
recall looking over at my wife and thinking how soundly she was sleeping,
almost as if she had taken a sedative (which she had not). Eventually, I did
fall asleep and began dreaming that I was in a town which seemed to be set in
the early nineteen twenties or thirties. I remember looking in store fronts at
the period items that were for sale and seeing old cars from that era parked on
the dirt street. For some strange reason I knew that this town was populated by
black folks, although I do not recall seeing any people of this race in my
dream, or for that matter, any people at all. Suddenly I became very agitated
and frightened of something that I could not see but that was very terrifying
to me. I remember thinking that I had to wake up in order to escape whatever
was scaring me but I couldn't make myself open my eyes; it was a very helpless
feeling. Suddenly I felt the distinct sensation of someone (or something)
squeezing my left toe (as my foot was sticking out from under the covers). I
know this sounds somewhat comical but in retrospect it brought to mind the way
a mother or grandmother might wake a child from sleep, whether to get them up
for the day (or to spare them from a bad dream). I immediately woke up to find
no one at the foot of the bed and my wife still very sound asleep. I couldn't
get back to sleep as I kept thinking about how frightened I had been and how
real the sensation of my toe being squeezed had felt. Eventually we got up and
dressed and went up to the main part of the house to meet our hostess and the
other boarders for breakfast. Up to now I had not said anything to my wife
about my experience because I was not sure how it would sound to her. As we
made small talk with another couple, who had stayed the night in a restored cabin
located on the grounds, our hostess entered the room. I asked her if she had
experienced any strange occurrences during her time as owner of The Old Crow
Inn. Without hesitation she began to relate several instances to us such as the
times when her house pets would become frightened by unseen presences,
particularly in a certain room of the house and how she and her family had been
saved from a faulty furnace leaking carbon monoxide by a warning she had
received during a dream. She was very convinced that the old house had a
presence or multiple presences of some type. She also recounted some of the
history of the inn, including the murder of the black cook and the sudden death
of a previous owner who planned on razing the inn in order to replace it with a
housing development. Before I could recount my experience of the night before,
the couple spoke up. They said that before going to sleep that they had both
been reading in bed. Eventually they had turned their respective reading lamps
off at each lamp rather than at the master switch across the room. They did
this for the obvious reason of not having to cross an unfamiliar room to turn
on the light if it were needed during the night. But when one of them indeed
found the need to get up during the night, they discovered the master switch
had been thrown, disabling control of their lamps from their bed. And then upon
awakening the next morning they found that the master switch had again been
thrown after they had reset it following the first instance. I then related my
&quot;toe squeezin experience&quot; which was received rather well, presumably
due to the stories that had proceeded it. After breakfast my wife and I
returned to our room and prepared to leave. My wife eventually went back into
the main part of the house to retrieve the invoice for our stay while I
remained behind and began to fill out a check for payment. While waiting for
her to return I put the checkbook down onto a small table and began to organize
our luggage for transfer to our car. When my wife came back with the invoice I
asked her what she had done with the checkbook although I was standing there
when she entered the room. It wasn't where I had just left it a few minutes
before so we began to search for it. Eventually we found it buried under a stack
of magazines, almost as if it were deliberately being hidden there. This event
tended to re-enforce what had transpired<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>the night before and what our hostess had related to us about the inn.
And while these experiences were unusual we have returned to stay at The Old
Crow Inn several times with out experiencing anything similar to what happened
during that particular visit. But to this day I can still remember the distinct
feel of the physical pressure applied to my toe by whoever or whatever woke me from
my disturbing dream. And I know that I will never, ever forget it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

NAME IS JUAN AND I LIVE IN N. RIALTO IN WHAT THEY CALL “THE COUNTRY CLUB”. IT
IS A VERY QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD, COMPARED TO WHERE I USED TO LIVE AT IN LA PUENTE
1 YEAR AGO. AFTER I MOVED INTO MY HOUSE, I FELT A STRANGE FEELING THERE. IT WAS
FAR TOO QUIET AND DARK AT NIGHT. I WAS USED TO NOISE. ONE COLD NIGHT THIS YEAR
IN JANUARY, MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WERE HAVING SOME DRINKS WITH THE LIGHTS OFF, BY
THE FIREPLACE. MY GIRLFRIEND GOT UP TO USE THE RESTROOM, BUT THEN RAN BACK
CRYING AND JUMPED ON MY LAP. I ASKED HER WHAT WAS WRONG, BUT SHE JUST TOLD ME
SHE GOT A REALLY SCARED FEELING FOR SOME REASON. I JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS
SLIGHTLY INTOXICATED SO I JUST COMFORTED HER AND MADE HER FEEL AT EASE.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A
WEEK LATER, MY GIRLFRIEND TOOK OUR BABY INTO THE ROOM TO PUT HER TO SLEEP, AND
FELL ASLEEP HERSELF. I ENDED UP FALLING ASLEEP IN THE LIVING ROOM BY MYSELF. I
WOKE UP AND SAW AN IMAGE OF SOMETHING VERY DISTURBING. TIL THIS DAY I KNOW I
WAS WIDE AWAKE AND I KNOW WHAT I SAW!!! I SAW THE IMAGE OF A LADY AT THE END OF
THE COUCH WHERE I WAS SLEEPING AT, AND SHE APPEARED TO BE VERY SAD, LOOKING
DOWN. IT WAS QUITE A SHOCK AT FIRST, BUT THEN I REALIZED I HAD NO FEAR OF HER.
MEANWHILE, I’M STILL LOOKING RIGHT AT HER! I JUST TOLD HER “YOU DON’T BELONG
HERE, AND I WILL PRAY FOR YOU”. SO I DID! OF COURSE I CLOSED MY EYES TO PRAY,
AND WHEN I OPENED THEM, SHE WAS GONE. I KNEW WHAT I SAW THOUGH…!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>TWO
DAYS LATER, I COULD NOT HOLD INSIDE OF ME WHAT I HAD SEEN ANYMORE. I WANTED TO
TELL MY GIRLFRIEND, BUT I WAS AFRAID SHE WOULDN’T BELIEVE ME AND MAKE FUN OF
ME. EITHER THAT OR GET SO SCARED SHE WOULD NOT WANT TO COME OVER ANYMORE. SO I
TOLD HER. WHEN I TOLD HER I WOKE UP AND SAW AN IMAGE OF A LADY, SHE STOPPED ME.
SHE THEN DESCRIBED THE LADY TO ME. SHE SAID “WAS SHE OLDER, HAVE SHORT HAIR AND
LIGHT SKINNED, AND ABOUT 5’6’’? I WAS SHOCKED FOR A MINUTE THEN ANSWERED “YES,
HOW DID YOU KNOW”? SHE THEN TOLD ME, “REMEMBER THAT NIGHT WE WERE HAVING DRINKS
AND I WENT TO GO USE THE RESTROOM BUT THEN CAME RUNNING BACK”? I ANSWERED “YES,
WHY”? SHE THEN TOLD ME THAT THE SAME LADY WAS AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY STARING
AT HER ANGRILY!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>THAT
IS MY STORY, SORRY IT’S LONG BUT I WANTED TO FULLY EXPLAIN IT. MY GRANDMOTHER

Point on Lake Huron is said to have the most shipwrecks of the entire lake,
that is until they built the Lighthouse. It was the summer of '81 and I was a
girl of eight lucky enough to be invited to my rich aunt's summer home. The
&quot;cottage,&quot; as my aunt referred to it was built on the beach and was a
five minute walk to the lighthouse. My cousin and are were the same age so the
two of us played from sun up till sundown. Her older brother would show us all
the things he would find while snorkeling among the boulders. Our imaginations
would run wild wondering about what had happened to all those ships, and the
people on them. We would examine the wooden planks and wonder what part of the
ship is this from? The strangest thing he found was a cast iron wagon wheel. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
nights always caught us girls on our guard. The beach itself wasn't scary, but
rather the back of the house facing the road. Our room was located upstairs
facing the street, and had a glass sliding door that went out to a large balcony.
The house was surrounded by thick(and very dark)woods, and on one side was the
neighbors house. I awoke one night out of a dead sleep to go to the bathroom. I
got out of bed trying to see my way to the door, and glanced out the glass door
to the neighbor's house. He had his porch lights on and I noticed someone
standing there. I wondered if I was seeing things, but no, there was a woman
dressed in a long flowing gown looking up at his balcony. I knew it was a ghost
because I could see that she was somewhat transparent and had a soft glow. I
was more amazed than afraid. After a few seconds she disappeared. It all
happened so fast that I didn't have a chance to wake up my cousin and show her.
When she was awakened I described what I saw,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>a woman with very long wavy hair wearing a long dress looking up at the
balcony next door. Since the Neighbors house was so close there could be no
mistaking what I saw. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
grew up in a haunted house in the Olney part of Philly. Every night I would
hear whispering, and people calling out to me. I also knew someone was standing
at the foot of my bed. One particular time I was lying in bed when an unseen
person sat on the edge of the bed. There was an imprint in the mattress, and I
felt someone there. The “person” sat there for several minutes then got up and
left. There was a cold spot at the foot of the stairs of this house, and there
were times when I would see glances of someone out of the corner of my eye. I
lived in that house until I turned 13, and up until that time for as long as I
can remember, I had these weird experiences. The voices and whispering and the
person at the foot of my bead happened mostly every night. I thought this was
normal, so I didn’t tell anyone. Recently I questioned my other family members
especially my brother who shared my bedroom, and no one else had any strange
experiences. A strange footnote, when we moved to south jersey, my sister and
father experienced a doorlatch opening and closing by itself. I had no ghostly
experiences in the house in jersey, or since. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
