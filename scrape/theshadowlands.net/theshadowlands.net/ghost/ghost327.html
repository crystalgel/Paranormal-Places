<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">By:
Speedy9747@aol.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
am usually a
very articulate person, but it has been more than a bit difficult to
put into
words the events that happened to me between 1990 and 1993.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In the late summer or early fall of 1990, my
family had lost a home to fire. Money was more than a little tight and
the
insurance was less than adequate. My family was forced to sell the
remaining
property to pay the difference between what we owed and what the
insurance
covered. With no expendable cash, clothing, furniture, home, food etc;
we took
what we could get. What we got was a “fully furnished” apartment on the
rougher
side of town until the actual bungalow we were slotted for became
available. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
tenant
currently residing in the bungalow was an eccentric elderly lady who
reminded
me of the wicked witch of the west. She had the crooked nose, the
grating laugh
and she shuffled about with a nefarious smile. I tried to avoid her
(because
she gave me the hee-bee-gee-bies) to no avail. She was everywhere. I
would see
her at the grocery store, the movie store, outside of the apartment, at
the bus
stop. I even started having weird dreams about her. At fifteen, I was
too
ashamed to talk about my “scary lady” nightmares, so I kept them to
myself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Finally,
moving
day arrived. The “Scary Lady” (as the local pre-school children I
babysat
called her) was moving out and I would finally have a reprieve from
that
godforsaken smile. I felt elated and hopeful for the first time in
weeks.
Elated, that is, until the evening of our move. I had been unloading
boxes from
the two-wheeler and placing them in the appropriate room when I came to
what
would be my bedroom. There in the center of the room was a cardboard
box sealed
shut by residual wax from a once large, red candle. Crazy Lady had left
me a
souvenir. I told my parents who, in turn told the landlord who, in turn
told
Crazy. She was coming to retrieve her things. My stomach felt that
awful
churning in its pit with each passing minute. When she finally arrived,
her company
removed the box while she smiled at me and said “You’ll really like it
here. I
can tell he’s going to like you.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Her
warning
seemed to be the absolute truth. Immediately things began to occur that
defied
any logical or reasonable explanation. The first events were horrible
nightmares that walked me through a brutal murder that happened in my
bedroom
in the late 60’s or early 70’s (I initially concluded this based off of
their
clothing and music). Each nightmare grew in intensity and clarity.
After months
of these reoccurring dreams, I ventured to the local library and
searched for
the street name. In 1971 a young man was murdered in that house in the
room I
used as my bedroom exactly as I dreamed it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">There
were also
footsteps at all hours of the day and night that were not of an animal
nature
and when all parties were accounted for. Items were moved from one room
to
another or from one floor to another. Pictures were turned face down or
moved
to an upside-down position when on the wall. During storms, balls of
lightening
would dance around in the kitchen. Locked doors would open and close,
locked
windows would open and close and the footboard of my bed would come
unhinged
and slam on the floor with intense force. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Our
dogs would
awake, perk up as if they had been called and run up stairs as if
greeting and
playing with an unseen friend. If you were outside of the home, you
could feel
someone watching you. Twice I awoke in the morning where locks of my
hair had
been cut in the night. Each time I made my bed and left for school, I
would
come in to find the impression where someone had sat though I was the
last to
leave and the first to arrive. On full moons and lunar eclipses, the
sound of
scratching would emanate from within the walls. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Friends
and
especially boyfriends would refuse to come over or come in because
they’d swear
they heard someone threaten them to stay away from me. On several
occasions I
heard a male voice calling my name or felt a man’s body spoon with me
in the
middle of the night. Often while I showered, I would feel like someone
was
peering in on me. There were several times that I would wake up to find
my
shorter skirts sitting on my dresser where I had laid pants out the
night
before. There were unexplained drafts, noises, and feelings everywhere
within
that house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Over
time, I
began to see a man’s silhouette outside my bedroom door or closer into
the
room. On a few instances, I saw the shadowy silhouette in the bathroom.
With
these sightings came more direct physical contact. I would jolt out of
bed at
all hours of the night feeling icy hands on my face, neck, legs, back
and/or
abdomen. I began to dream very sexual dreams starring the young man
from my
earlier murder dreams. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">After
three
years of this constant and increasing torture, we moved. By then, I was
18 and
heading down the home stretch of my senior year staring down the barrel
of
college. The relief I felt with the move was soon replaced by the fears
of my
own uncertain future. Just days before I was to leave, my mom, sister,
brother
and I began to talk. It had been three months since we had moved from
the house
on Shoreline and strangely not a word had been said until that day. It
was then
that we all began to talk openly about the “experiences” we had each
individually known. I will not go in to the events experienced by my
family
members but I will say that I am not the only one who was haunted
there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">, I use to live in a home
with 2 ghosts,
a mother and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">daughter.
They
had died in house fire were my home had been built. My<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">home
before I
move in had been on fire several times, till it was set on<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">fire
and burnt
to the ground. The story of their death is that one night<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">that
the
grandfather had woke to stoke up the fire in a wood burning<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">stove,
unfortunate, he use some gasoline to get the fire going better<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">and
it back
flash on him causing him to spill the rest of the gas. He<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">died
later in
the hospital, the mother and daughter never did get out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
"mother" ghost first appear to me when I had my baby, she awoke me<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">to
warn me of
someone entering the home. Standing above me was like a<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">"grayish"
mist. The 12 year. old little girl had like a "crush" on my<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">son
and played
tricks on him, like if he turn the light off she would<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">turn
them back
on, or the T.V.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">One
day my
mother was visiting and my children was getting out of hand<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">and
mom started
to scold them and the "mother" ghost got upset and knock<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">some
of the
dishes off of the shelf and then knock the stove pipe off of<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
stove. When
the dishes came down, one hit one of my girls and left a<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">scare.
The two
ghosts, never let anyone live in "their" home for more<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">than
2 years, if
even that long, well, they must have like us, we lived<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">there
for about
8 years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
house is no longer
there, and sometimes even today I still feel like<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
mother and
daughter has move with us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Thank

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">When
in I was
small we lived in a big house close to the cemetery. I had a friend who
would
not believe me and told me that I was crazy. I told him that I saw
lights out
side and that you could here some children laughing. One day as we were
walking
home my friend asked me if I had called him I said no and he laughed
thinking I
was pulling his leg. Later that day he came over to my house and slept
over .at
night we heard a noise coming from the cemetery my friend and I got out
of bed
and thinking we were being brave left the house for the cemetery. As we
got
closer the sound got louder pretty soon all you heard was a roaring
sound that
scared the hell of of us we took off and never heard anything from
there again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sleeping on our stomachs and we felt the pressure on our backs like
someone was
holding us down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has happened to me a
couple of times and only once with Chris.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When it happened to Chris he felt annoyed and mad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He thought that one of his little brothers
was pushing on him because he felt hands on his back and knees on his
legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started to "shake"
the "person" off and said get off of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
he felt it sit up on it's knees on the
back of his legs and he repeated, "Get off of me."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pressure finally released and Chris was
able to look behind himself and when he did he found out that he was
alone in
the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not his brothers.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He says that he didn't feel scared or
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basically he went back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Wish
my
experiences had felt non-threatening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
more or less was spooked by it because I couldn't move or open my eyes.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I did have the sensation of going through the
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also couldn't speak so in my head
I kept screaming, "Get off, get off, get off!'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second time it happened was shortly after
we moved across the street into a new townhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
time I forced my shoulder to jerk the
being off of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would let up but
then come right back down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally got
it to go away so that I could get up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was really unsettling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
thing is
that I didn't know it had a title or what it was until I came across
your web
site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I read the description about Old
Hag Syndrome and got all excited and had Chris come down to read it too.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He was amazed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said, "Mom, that is what happened to
us but the only difference is that we were on our stomachs."<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in awe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And thrilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I'm
sorry to cut
myself off but it is getting late and I need to go to bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have so many other stories I would like to
share with you (if you are willing to listen).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Especially about my "Crisis Apparition" that occurred with my
Grandmother last year 2 weeks before she died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Very interesting yet sad story to tell. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Well,
until next
time I wish you all well and good luck with the hunting and research.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">This
happened to
me back in the early 70's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I live in the
city of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Gadsden</span></st1:place></st1:city><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">, Al, and one of the times
that my sister
and her husband and two daughters were down for a visit from </span><st1:state><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Minn.</span></st1:place></st1:state><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My niece who was around 12 years old always liked to stay over
night
with my wife and I ( I was around 21 years old then). My niece was
going to
sleep in the front bedroom while my wife and I slept in our room in the
rear of
the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Around
1 or </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="2"><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">2 am</span></st1:time><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> my wife woke me up and told
me that my
niece was asleep in the floor by our bed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>we woke her up and she said that she did not want to sleep in a
room by
herself, but did not say why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her
to get up and sleep in our bed and I would go to the front bedroom and
sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">When
I got to
the front bedroom and just got into bed, I felt as if someone was
pushing me
down with their hand on my chest. I tried several times to get up but I
could
not and it was hard to breath. I kept trying to raise up or even turn
over but
I could not. I was really getting scared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>after about a minute or two (felt like a hour to me) the
pressure
released and I was able to get up. I then went into my room and I slept
on the
floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
got up the
next morning and went to work but did not say anything about what had
happen to
me during the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I came home for lunch I was talking with my
wife and I told her what had happen to me and she told me that was what
had
happen to my niece and that was why she came into our room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We
never went
back into that room and later moved from that house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have never had anything else happen and I
hope I never do again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nativeson71@earthlink.net<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We
wanted to
sell our house soon after moving in... but they got used to us and us
to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We
live in a
1926 bungalow in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Tampa</span></st1:place></st1:city><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">, and I'll tell you just a
couple of the things that have
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Soon
after
moving in, we kept having creepy things happen like the lights flicking
on and
off, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not<span style="">&nbsp; </span>believing
in such "nonsense" we
dismissed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the fan would be on
when we had left it off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the TV was
on when we came home one night, when we knew we had turned it AND the
cable box
off before leaving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">THEN,
I was
leaving for work one morning and out of the corner of my eye, I saw the
French
door on the right front of our house was standing wide open and the
deadbolt
was in the "locked" position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This door had not been used since we first moved in and had the
door (which
was ugly) and the locks changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
checked the "locked" status of the door on several occasions for the
security of my family, and there was no way it could have opened in the
"locked" position (with the deadbolt out).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
kind of freaked out, and we started talking
about moving again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">THEN,
we were
watching TV a few nights later, when a man walked by the door in our
hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, I freaked and jumped
into defense mode, but there was no one there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was an apparition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">THEN,
I had a
dream that something was wrong in the house and got up to investigate.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing a noise behind me, I turned (in
dream) to see a spectral figure who grabbed me around the throat and
was
choking me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My wife awoke from hearing
my choking, and she woke me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
shook violently for about 5 minutes after.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, we were convinced to either move from our beautiful new
house, or
have an exorcism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We
decided to
buy several crosses and place them around the house, and announced to
the house
that we weren't going anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This did
not stop the paranormal activity, but made it much less scary in nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We
had some
friends over who were skeptical about our "experiences".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were talking about everything that had
happened and my wife's cousin was nay-saying everything we mentioned,
when the
cork in the salad oil shot into the air about six inches.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They freaked, and suddenly my wife's cousin's
husband wanted to stay up all night in our house with a video camera.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My wife announced to the house that we would
make them a plate of salad if they really wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
this time, we were certainly converts,
with witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We
still get up
in the morning to find the dining room light and fan on when we rarely
use that
room (and certainly didn't the night before), but it has become less
frightening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, we haven't had
anything as endangering as doors opening or choking dreams to where we
would
feel unwanted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We
have also
found a few very old items buried outside, which we have<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>incorporated into our curio to honor those
that lived here before us, so I think that helps a bit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Hey
man, great
site to get scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a ghost story
that maybe will be <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">interesting
for
others to read, ready? here we go.....<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">It
was like,
1999 and I used to work in this computer distribution center in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place><st1:city><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Fullerton</span></st1:city><span

 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">CA</span></st1:state></st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>HUGE warehouse full of computers and IT stuff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I can tell <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
building was
kind of old but not like ancient old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ok
lets get down to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">business...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">When
I started
to work there as a Security Officer, we had those big metal <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">detectors,
kind
of the same ones in the airports, well, me and some other <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">officer
are
sitting next to them, when all of a sudden, those things will go <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">off
for no
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We initially believed the
forklift was just riding behind <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
wall and
made them go off, but if we were working the weekends, and the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">warehouse
is
sealed, and no forklift was in use, same thing will happen, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">metal
detectors
will go off don’t know why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But That’s
nothing compared to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">what’s
next....In one weekend I was working in the com. center( a place with <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">cameras
and all
that security stuff).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its about time to
go home and I go to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
restroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>5 minutes later I come out and
try to open the com. center door and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
felt like
someone was holding the door from the inside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thought my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">relief
was
already on site and he was playing a joke on me, so I told him, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">common
man, let
me in...yep he did but when I got inside, NO ONE was there.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Needles
to say,
I grabbed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my things and waited
downstairs for my relieving <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">officer
so I
could go home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">In
a different
occasion, I am training the new officer for the graveyard <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">shift.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We are sitting right next to the employee
entrance door around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">3am</span></st1:time><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">and
he looks at
me and tells me....hey dude, who’s the lady in white?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I’m <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">like-
what lady
in white?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He says that some lady wearing
something <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">white
just
walked in front of the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I go out
side to check and nothing <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">there
and from
the moment he said he saw this lady to the moment I went to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">check,
maybe
only 1 min has passed and there is no way someone can get out <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">of
that huge
parking lot in less than that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He kept
on saying he was sure <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">of
what he saw
and I was like yeah sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe an hr
later, his cell <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">phone
rang, he
picked up...nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>15 minutes later,
phone rings again...no <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">one.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>45 minutes later, phone rings again, he
picked up and said if you don’t <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">want
to talk
just stop calling...and he just drop his cell phone and said...I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">quit.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I’m like. why man? he told me some faint
voice told him hello.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">him
to stay
until the end of the shift and he agreed, but the phone was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">ringing
every
once in a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he would never pick up
and once again, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">needles
to say,
that was his first and last day working there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Some
other day,
in a weekend, around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="16"><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">4pm</span></st1:time><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> I’m standing next to the
intercom <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">(we
have an
intercom so truck drivers could announce themselves) and I hear <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">this
metallic
clicking noise in the intercom.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I’m
like, maybe someone <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">playing
and
since it was the weekend, that meant trespassers so I go to the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">door
and look
out and nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I’m like. maybe darn
birds were playing with <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Same moment I’m thinking this, intercom goes
off again ..click click <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">click
like
someone making noises with a coin or something but imp looking at <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
gate and no
one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I go investigate and tell
the other S/O to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">pay
attention to
the noise I was going to make to compare...and yes same <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">noise
I was
making flipping the fire dept key covers, was the same noise we <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Want
to hear
more? ok here....<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">My
boss and I
are standing outside the building, smoking a cigarette and we <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">look
up to were
the office windows are and we see the shadow of someone <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">walking
thru.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I’m like..man who is crazy enough
to work at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">3am</span></st1:time><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he
was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">like,
I’m in the
same floor and I’m up there by myself, plus access to that <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">floor
is
restricted only for certain employees and there are no employees in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
facility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not go up there to
check, sorry for my boss he went up <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">there
just to
get his stuff and spend the rest of the evening with us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Sometimes
I used
to be up there by myself and I could hear someone walking <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">out
side my
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was when I first started
working there so I had no <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">idea
that only
management have access to that floor and no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">After
learning
all this, I didn’t work that com, center again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">This

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
lived there
with my boyfriend and his roommates -- I was haunted for 3-4 weeks and
would
stagger every 2-3 days apart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
character was a spirit just wanting to let someone know he was still
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story went as I was told when
he and his brother were younger and helped build the house they lived
in when
they were grown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One died of an overdose
and the other a shot wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ashes of
Tom and Steve were spread over the baseball fields that were in the
back of the
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a store on the corner
of the roads mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And two house
sit next to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All three are to be
believed haunted since the family owned the property back in the day.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The store on the corner was shut down buy the
government because of the gasoline tanks weren't secure and up to
regulation
standards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which took an impact on the
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Ghost I think of almost every
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing that for over 30 years, his
"kind" of people lived in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
house was sold in November 2001 to the store owner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Who now has expanded his business with a
drive thru.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
house is
very beautiful inside and well kept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
since sold from my friends to the new owner, The New owner was to move
his
mother in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was wondering how the
ghost felt about this since this wasn't his type of people he would of
hung out
with if he was alive.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">But
It started
and creeped me out really bad to where I wouldn't stay there by myself.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>After a week or two I was getting used to it
and becoming familiar with his character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was a prankster Spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just
wanting to let his presence be known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
occasionally drive by the property wishing I was able to know the
people who
are in the house now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had many
encounters inside the house and also seen the Orbs floating in the
bedroom that
I was in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard 5 sets of footsteps as
if to be in sandals and with a wet sound.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thru the window to my left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which
didn't make sense there were prickly weeds a pine tree and no one
really walked
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a window at the feet of
the bed and I was waiting for one of the 5 roommates to say Hey let me
in, I
locked myself out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing was said, I
asked my boyfriend did you hear that, he was asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So he didn't hear the footsteps or see the
orbs I saw after the footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the
footsteps stopped I then asked if he heard that moments later I was
watching
all around the room and at the window at our feet bottom left corner
there was
a white ball floating slowly up and down about 2-3 ups and downs and
then faded
but continued on the corner of the other side of the window and it was
shorter
1-2 ups and downs and then up and left the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
scared me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was one of the first
encounters.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
boys had the
basement clean and made up as a professional wrestling ring, with all
of the
trophies of one of the roommates winnings thru the Tuff Man contest
From
Hara.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very neatly kept.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So coming down into the basement to the
immediate right was a boarded wall with a curtain for the door which
was the
washer and dryer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a window
above the washer and dryer and I was standing there waiting to convert
the wash
to the dryer and I heard and broom stick fall to the ground with a
couple of
bounces as if someone dropped a mop handle or broom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked up to the window and said out loud,
Very funny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So just for curiosity I
went<span style="">&nbsp; </span>around<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
basement looking for a similar item that
would have made that sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a broom
or mop no where.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back to the
washing room and stood there for a moment and it did it again.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I said Very, Very funny.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
had driven
from New Carlisle to this house my boyfriend and I were going to go out.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I got there he was asleep in his bed and
didn't appear that he was going to make it on getting up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So I got up and left out of the house thru
the breezeway and out the door to the driveway.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I got thru the parking lot of the store next
door and my boyfriend called me on my cell and told me to come back and
that he
would get up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned around and parked
in the driveway and came back thru the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The door separating the breezeway going to the house had the old
door
knobs that had the square screws which they never stayed in, A screw
driver or
the door handle would let you into the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I entered the house and slammed the door shut.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no way that it would of slid open
once it was shut either the door knob or the screwdriver was needed to
get
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into the bedroom and sit on
the side of the waterbed and dangling my feet and my boyfriend had
still made
not effort on getting up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Momentarily,
the breezeway door slammed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With no
noises before hand as if one of the roommates were home so I waited for
voices
to be heard from some of the guys, No voices.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Just a door slam exactly like the slam I done when I came back
from
leaving the first time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I paused....and
then spoke softly and asked my boyfriend, "What was that?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>he said, "the door."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Then
He and I
were the only ones home and getting ready to turn into bed for the
night since
he worked early needing to be at work at </span><st1:time minute="0"
 hour="4"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">4:00 a.m.</span></st1:time><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So Down the hallway straight ahead was the bathroom, to the
right was
the room he and I stayed in and the bedroom on the left was the room
that the
guy was shot in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which the roommate
there said he didn't believe in Ghost and had never seen anything.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So I was in the bathroom sitting
there and
getting ready to get up to pull up my pants, and I feel this knock on
the
bottom of my left foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not my right one
too, just the left one...I said before I thought it out, Ha Ha very
funny, I
called out my boyfriends name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well the
walls were made very strong, out of sheet metal and when something
happens like
this your mind automatically races to find an explanation for what just
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I thought, His head board
of his waterbed was about a foot from the wall and even if he knocked
on the
wall...which were strong walls...why would I only feel this in my left
foot and
not both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I get into the bedroom and if
he had done that the water bed would had of been still moving.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was still... <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">It
was if The
Prankster Spirit was in the basement hitting the ceiling of the
basement
underneath the bathroom floor with a broom handle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt it in only one foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">So
were all
sitting around watching a fight on the big high time cable and I asked
one of
the guys had they ever seen, felt or heard anything, he looked and me
and his
eyes were as if enlarged and I asked him what happened and he didn't
want to
tell me but just by the expression on his face you can tell when
someone has
had a Haunting experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took me
about 10 minutes to get his story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said he was standing at the bottom of the steps of the living room and
someone
tapped him on his shoulder he turned around and no one was there.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I never experience the touch other than the
knock in the bathroom on my left foot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I saw and heard things.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
house is
definitely Haunted and I just want to be around when it is made more
known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because I miss the Ghost and
think of my experience often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wonder
if he has changed since his kind of people have gone and there is an
older lady
to be living there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I once drove past
about 6 months after we left the house and there was a sign out in the
yard as
if it was a daycare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That didn't stay in
the yard too long because I cherish my time in that house and miss it
allot and
thinking about my experiences almost every day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I feel for the Ghost and him being lost and not able to make the
complete crossover to leave what he knew in life behind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I often wonder if maybe he may of become an
angrier ghost or remains the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the store and the two houses that sit together were connected back in
time to
one family that owned all three and the baseball fields that are no
longer
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the ashes of the brothers
were spread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was something in my life
I will never forget and will always think about.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">This
past
Halloween I went to a known Haunted area in my town in New Carlisle,
called </span><st1:street><st1:address><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Staley Road</span></st1:address></st1:street><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I took my girlfriend out there October 31st we went and parked
by the
barn and turned the car off and sit and waited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got out of the car and took a few pictures and presently
awaiting for
the development of those hoping to see an image or capture something
that I
couldn't see with my eyes.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">So
the interest
of being haunted and knowing that I wasn't in any kind of harm my
interest in
this field have excelled and I seek these places out hoping to have
another
encounter with the third world.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">For
those who
don't believe....Just wait until it happens to you.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
live on the
south side </span><st1:place><st1:city><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Edmonton</span></st1:city><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> </span><st1:state><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Alberta</span></st1:state></st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> (In Canada) about two
blocks away from a
cemetery. The cemetery is called Pleasantview. It's a beautiful, quiet
area and
cemetery, with all denominations buried there. There are large
jackrabbits that
inhabit the grounds and there's always someone paying homage to their
loved
ones.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One Thursday in Early October
I
decided to visit this graveyard (Like I always do) but this time I
brought
along my 13 year old stepson. It was getting dark and chilly as we
reached our
destination, a two minute walk away. As I entered the graveyard I
noticed that
there we're two people setting up what appeared to be photographic
equipment
and Geiger counters etc... a little further up the slope that we we're
on. I
had just turned to say something to my stepson when I saw a white mist
shaped
like a human, walk by to my right about 30 feet away. The two people on
the
hill setting up their equipment must have seen it too because they both
stopped
what they we're doing and stared in that general direction. I had
stopped dead
(Pardon the pun) in my tracks and was staring too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My stepson saw nothing except the shocked
expression on my face. It was only there for a second but it was real.
I had
brought along an MP3 player in the hopes of catching an EVP. I did in
fact
catch a voice. I asked if there was anyone that wanted to give me a
message or
just talk, and I got an eerie "yesss."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had been walking around after darkness
fell amongst the tombstones. It had taken me awhile to get over the
initial
shock of seeing the mist before I could continue on and even
concentrate on
catching an EVP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard only my voice
and that of my stepson when I asked the question originally. I only
heard the
voice answer yes when I played back the recording. I hadn’t heard it
when I asked
originally if anyone wanted to talk. It was creepy<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">This
is just one
of the many happenings around this neighborhood. There is an old folks
home
right next to the graveyard (Literally, within 20 feet) There are
always orbs
and such around the cemetery and I for one have seen many things that I
cannot
rationally explain. My stepson is now a believer as well. WE have had
many odd
happenings here in my own home. I live in town homes that 40 years ago
we're
army barracks. just the other night my boyfriend was in the kitchen
cleaning up
a broken glass (That had just flown off the counter of it's own
volition) when
one of my 6 year old daughters plastic toy tops flew off the table and
started
spinning by itself on the floor. The funny part is that the top didn't
have a
stem so you could grab it and spin it. The kids had broken it off.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend knew this place was haunted but
had never experienced anything before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Things are constantly getting moved or disappearing altogether.
There
are blue orbs that float around and my doors occasionally open and
close by
themselves. Something keeps tapping at my daughters window and
sometimes it
shakes so violently that I think it's going to come right out of it's
frame.
There is no wind when this happens and no breeze that could cause this
kind of
shaking. My cat goes mental and stares at things that I cannot see. All
cats
are crazy to some extent but this one seems terrified. Like something
is
chasing him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">A
few of my
neighbors have reported similar problems and sightings as well. It's
never dull
here. I also wanted to add that I am epileptic and that<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>since I have moved here my seizures have
increased in severity. I am on the same medications, same dosage and
everything. It's just in the air I guess.............<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Here's
another
one for you:.... <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I’m
33 years old
now but in my 9th grade my first year of high school I went to a
private
Christian school in </span><st1:place><st1:city><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Longview</span></st1:city><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> </span><st1:state><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Washington</span></st1:state></st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I made a lot of new friends there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Things were going well for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
school we were to go on a retreat to a place called “</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Camp</span></st1:placetype><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> </span><st1:placename><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Bethel</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">”. I think it was in Bothel </span><st1:state><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Washington</span></st1:place></st1:state><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">....<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were going for one night and two days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was fun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course we learned about god and nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
played games and we all had a great
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that night something happened
there that I do not understand to this very day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
hope someday to understand it but for now,
I really have no explanation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
main Lodge
was of course by the main parking lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had the wreck hall and the kitchen, and a really big wooden
fireplace
and as fate would have it, the only restrooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The cabin that was used for the retreat however was down a long
trail in
the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boys and the girls
couldn’t sleep in the same quarters so we had a draw straws to see
which group
got to sleep in the lodge and which group had to go sleep in the cabin
out in
the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cabin had no bathroom so
if you had to go in the middle of the night you had to walk down the ½
mile
long over grown trail back to the lodge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was hoping for the lodge, I mean we were girls for Goodness
sake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as luck would have it we got the
cabin in
the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were a group of about 15
girls so it wasn’t too bad, I mean they say there’s power in numbers
and the
teacher was a guy, so we were out there all alone, just us girls and
the
wilderness, so we got settled in, and dressed for bed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">What
happened
next is something that has puzzled me ever since that night.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We all got tucked into our bunks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had a bunk on the top, I guess I felt
better on the top bunk thinking that there would be no eight legged
crawly
things up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was freezing cold
out there in that cabin, I could see my breath in front of me, and my
sleeping
bag wasn’t much help at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lay there
for what seemed like a long time, but It must have been about 25 or 30
minutes
and this tremendously weird feeling started growing inside of me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It felt even colder in the cabin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had this sick feeling in the pit of my
stomach, a cross between fear and danger and then the feeling that
someone was
there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Three
of the
girls got up because they had to go use the bathroom and they all went
together
because it was after mid night and they had to walk down the long path
through
the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three had left the cabin
and not even 2 minutes later I saw my friend Denise by the door.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She said my name a few time trying to get my
attention and when I sat up she told me that she had to go to the
bathroom and
to please go with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The others had
just left but if we hurry she assured me that we could catch up with
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don’t know what it was, I looked
at her but
it didn’t feel right, that strange feeling inside of me was tugging at
me
hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She motioned for me to come with
her but I said no that I didn’t have to go.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I really did have to go but for some reason I was scared out of
my
mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw her open the door and slowly
step outside as the door started to creaked shut almost in slow motion.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I started thinking to myself that I was just
being a chicken, and a stupid chicken at that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was my friend so why wouldn’t I go with her, so I jumped up
to go
with Denise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was out of my bunk before
the door was closed all the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I
reached the door it had just at that moment shut the remainder of the
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I opened the door I saw her walk
off the
porch and I said “Denise wait I will go with you”.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then she was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard a voice
behind me say “You will go
with me where?”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I froze in my fear.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was Denise in her bunk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was so confused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her, “But
you were just walking out
the door to go to the bathroom and you asked me to go with you.”<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She said, “No I didn’t are you crazy?<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I would rather hold it all night then walk
through these woods in the middle of the night.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
told me that I must have been
dreaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got back in my bunk and I
was so cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt so confused at that
moment and the fear was at almost 99%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
however knew that I wasn’t dreaming, I saw her, I heard her and I even
got out
of my bed to go with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don’t quite
understand it to this day, but looking back now, I think that it must
have been
something supernatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was real, I
did not dream that and I have never forgotten.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I often wonder what or who it was and why they wanted me to go
with
them, and if I had, what would have happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember it like it was yesterday.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was about 14 at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
any length, I was glad that we only had to stay one night.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">This
was a post
I made on the Proof Positive message board for the television show, I
was
interview for the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Gettysburg</span></st1:place></st1:city><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> episode, I thought my story
would be worthy of ones you put
on the site... so here goes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">So
I was with my
girlfriend Amanda, and my two friends Marc and Megan. We are regulars
in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Gettysburg</span></st1:place></st1:city><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">, I live about a half hour
away, and we
are there almost every weekend, and some weekdays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">So
we are
walking around the Bathroom area across from Devils Den, there is an
open area
in the woods, a trail on the left and the right of you, and if your
facing the
bathroom, then we took the left. Up the hill, through the woods, it's
kind of
creepy, it's a tight trail, so your flashlight really doesn't give you
any idea
what's around the corner, and you need a flashlight because of all the
big
rocks and everything. Anyways, we got to a certain point where there is
a fork
in the path, as soon as we hit this point, everyone felt as if they
were very
very sad, and frightened of something. Marc, being the guy he is,
decides to
walk a bit more, and jumps, runs back to us, and says he saw something
(this is
Marc's first time, so he doesn't know what's what really.) So we all
decided to
walk back down the path and go across devils den and into Triangular
field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Being
stupid me,
I decide, "hey, I don't feel like driving the car up and around Devils
Den
and park again, so we can just backtrack when we are done in the
field!"
So that's what we do, we got to the field, and no one else was around
(it's
after park closing, maybe 11 or so.) Marc is leading the pack, as we
are
walking, Megan gets her hair tugged on, and we start hearing something
rustling
around in the bushes near us, I looked over to my right and right
beside the
woods, I see this black form run, didn't even seem like running as it
wasn't
bobbing, it just moved from one point to another and disappeared. I
looked at
Amanda and she said she saw it too. We kept walking down the path, and
get
close to a corner of the field that is usually really active...I once
again had
a feeling of despair and dread, I didn't want to move any further, so
Marc
decided he wanted to move forward a bit, while the rest of us stayed
back.
Megan was snapping off pictures, and Amanda and I were just looking
around. All
of a sudden, Marc comes running back yelling to leave, saying something
was
running around near him. So we decided to leave, we walked up the path
at a
semi brisk pace, all the while I am seeing things moving to my left and
right,
the same black form just going from point a to point b. We got out of
the field
and to the top of Devils Den, we started to walk down the path around
the Den
when all of a sudden we all just stopped dead in our tracks, as if we
hit a
barrier....off in the distance, on the same path that we took by the
bathrooms,
there is a large light sitting on the trail, as we started to move, it
did
too.....so we started to run to the car and it just came towards us,
but not
staying on the trail, it was just pushing through the woods. We got to
the car,
jumped in, and the car wouldn't start, three times I tried before it
started,
when it finally did, I reversed, as I stopped to put it in Gear, Marc
screams
"HOLY SH*T!!!" and we all turned around to see the light from the
trail immediately behind the car, hub<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">,
maybe three
feet in diameter, bright and clear, just sitting behind the car, I
gassed it,
and we left the Den.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Afterwards,
we
went to Sacks Bridge, talked to a few people and at one point, we were
on one
side of the bridge, when all of a sudden, this women’s car alarm starts
going
off, we all just kind of stood there for a second, before anyone really
knew
what to say. The women pulled out her keys to show she had no automatic
lock,
or car alarm button, just her regular keys....Marc and I decided to go
to the
car, all the time, the alarm starting and stopping. As we get to the
car, it's
starts, as if someone was inside turning the keys to the
ignition....Marc and I
walked to either side of the car, no one was inside or anything, it
stopped and
started 5 times, until the women finally jumped in the car and started
it and
shut it off herself, then it stopped for the rest of the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">So
that's my
story, I tell it on Proof Positive, but in a much shorter description,
and not
as detailed, they wanted it to be short.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
have two
stories one that happened to my grandma and one that happened to my
Mother both
in a small town called Labasa in the smaller (</span><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Vanua Levu</span></st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">) Islands of Fiji.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">THE
WELL AND THE
BABY<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">My
Grandma lived
on a farm with my grandpa in the 1960’s in a town called Labasa, on the
Northern side of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Fiji</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">. Although my grandpa was
studying law at
the time they were just starting off and couldn’t afford much and lived
in the
area where my Grandpa’s family were bought up and where my Grandpa was
bought
up. At the time of this story my Grandpa was in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> finishing off getting his
qualifications. And at the time my Grandma had a baby girl who was
5months old
at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">On
Thursday my
Grandma went across the cane field (nearly all farming in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Fiji</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> is sugar cane based) to get
her washing
done, she knew there was a well nearby and put her baby done near the
well
where there was no grass while she washed her clothes using the water
from the
well. The following night the dogs outside were howling all night and
kept
everyone up and the baby too who was crying all night. When my grandma
finally
got some sleep she had a weird dream where a cow standing by the well
told her
that her baby has crossed where she stays and she should keep away. My
grandma
thought that while the dream was weird it probably means nothing, it
was a cow
so it didn’t make much sense to take it seriously. Two days later my
grandma
went back to well and put her baby in the same place did her washing.
The
following night she got another dream but this time the cow standing
next to
the well said that her baby crossed the line where she stays, where she
lives
now and that her soul is hers. The following day my grandma got a bit
concerned
by the dream and stayed home. Around </span><st1:time minute="0"
 hour="18"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">6pm</span></st1:time><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> at night she was sitting in
her chair
with the baby in her arms. The door creaked open and the baby woke up
and
looked into my grandma’s eyes then took a small breath as if she was
choking
and then closed her eyes and blood trickled down from her mouth. The
baby died,
and the hospital said that there the baby was 100 percent healthy none
of the
internal organs were bleeding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">When
my grandpa
came back from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
 style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"> a day later my Grandma told
him what
happened, and he told my Grandma that one of her cousins committed
suicide in
that well and the body was never found. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Does
anyone here
know what the symbolism of the cow might have been, I never could
understand
that, email me!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">THE
STRANGE CAT<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">This
happened to
my mother. In Labasa (A town in Fiji), my mum was pregnant with my
brother and
my dad and my grandma decided to bring some family over from the other
side of
town to stay with my mum throughout the day and keep her happy. They
had a
great time, but since they do need to work to satisfy their own
families
household expenses my Dad had to drop them off and they couldn’t stay
the
night. So it was about 11pm when they set off to drop them off. Around
11:40
they crossed the Labasa Local Cemetery and my mums cousin said “hey
look a
pretty cat my cousin loves cat she’s lonely at home why don’t you come
home
with us so she can take care of you”. Everyone in the car thought it
was funny
and didn’t take much notice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Later
at night
at 2am my mum woke up screaming at the top of her lungs, when my
grandma came
into the room my mum kept yelling “there’s a black cat on the top of my
dresser
(Makeup Stand etc)” over and over again. My Grandma switched on the
light and
saw absolutely nothing on the dresser. My Grandma then tried to touch
my mums
for head to see if she had a fever and was delusional but she was
aggressive
and kept telling my Grandma that her eyes looked like cat eyes and that
she was
evil. So my Grandma ordered my dad to run to the backyard and get her
some
leaves from the lemon tree. She then grabbed my mums hair and tied it
in a not
and made her sniff lemon leaves and said “Wherever you came from you
better
leave now” she said that about 5 times then my mum collapsed and fell
asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">In
the morning
my dad and others asked my mum what happened last night and she
couldn’t recall
the event.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Does
anyone here
know if their family elders used similar techniques??<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
have many
other stories of experiences my Grandma had, if you would like more
stories you
can reply back to this email and ill give u some more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Oh,
where do I
start....<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was eighteen my then
girlfriend were living in Holland Mi. we had gotten into an argument
and were
on our way home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we didn't have a car so
we got around on my bicycle and her roller blades.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>when we were almost home at about 11:30PM we
passed a pizza place across from our apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I noticed a person going through the trash can in front of the
pizza
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started to cross the street,
which at that time of night had no traffic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>when I was dead even with him he was on the center line.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at him and every part of him was
visible by the street light except his face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't mean his whole head but just his face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>he had kind of blond hair was wearing a
flannel shirt and blue jeans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amber, My
girl friend was about twenty yards behind me and she seen him also.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact she had to swerve to avoid a
collision with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beyond the side walk
on our side of the road was an undeveloped piece of property. less than
one
minute later I stopped to make sure she was OK because that guy gave me
the
Creeps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked her if she seen him and
she told me about almost crashing into him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked back and he was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we
went back to where we had seen him and looked in the vacant lot for him
because
we didn't know what happened to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
searched for almost an hour before giving up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we got home my roommate was home and we told him what
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we went back with him and
tried to re-enact what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
all three of us taking turns on the bike we could not find a way to get
just
our faces in a shadow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>also we tried
sprinting across the vacant lot and any way we did it we couldn't get
across
without being seen in the amount of time it took get to where we
stopped,
looked back, and went back to where we seen the guy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>we have no idea what we seen that night. But
in my opinion what we seen that night was super natural.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I will never forget the events of that
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and it still makes the hairs on
the back of my neck stand up to talk about it.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
recently read
some of the stories that were posted on this site.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am a<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">believer
in
ghosts and the paranormal, I have also experienced some strange<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">things
in my
life time when it comes to hauntings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Someone told me that<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">when
you believe
in ghosts your more in tune to them, therefore they come to<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">you
instead of
someone that doesn't believe them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">My
first
experience happened to me in 1999, it was the summer and I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">working
late at
godfathers a pizza place in my hometown, I got home around<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">2:10am
I
remember this quite clearly, I usually stayed up and watched TV<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">but
I was tired
and went right upstairs, now to picture this the way it<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">happened
I have
to explain my room, my bed was facing the door so when I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">laid
down I
could just open my eyes and see the door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As soon as I got in<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">my
room I felt
strange, that weird feeling like something else is in there,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
shrugged it
off saying that I was to old for that kind of thing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">kid
I was
terrified of everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I laid down and
shut my eyes, the<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">creepy
feeling
was even more intense I couldn't shake it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As soon as I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">opened
my eyes I
saw a black shadowy object coming towards me fast!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">a
round head and
it's arms were outward, but they faded as the went out, it<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">was
coming right
for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was floating in the air but
at top speed like<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">if
it had a face
I would be looking in it's eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn't scream I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">couldn't
close
my eyes and I couldn't move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like
I was paralyzed<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">with
fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I tried to scream nothing came
out but
the sound of me<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">breathing
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't even explain the terror I
felt, in a snap it was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">over,
the creepy
feeling was gone out of my room and nothing was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Some
people that
I told about this said I was dreaming but I remember<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">clearly
when I
crawled into bed I set the alarm and it was 2:20am, after<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
incident was
over it was 2:23am.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I can not fall
asleep within<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">that
time frame,
I told my mom who doesn't believe in ghosts and she told me<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
was dreaming
as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember this encounter so
vividly still today 5<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">yrs
later and
when I tell the tale I still get tears in my eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
second
encounter that I faced was not more than a month after.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">lying
in the TV
room watching TV it was around midnight or so....I always<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">watched
TV late
being the terrified child I could never fall asleep at a<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">decent
hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>only a little lamp was on and then
the TV, I was getting<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">a
little sleepy
so I got up and turned the lamp off (which made the room<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">quite
dark).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few minutes later I got that
creepy feeling, and I mean it was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">bad,
I wanted to
get up and turn the lamp on but I was to scared to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">tried
to shake
it off but I couldn't I turned the TV up and tried to forget<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to go to my room to get away from
the creepy feeling but my<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">house
it dark at
night, there’s 3 flights of stairs I have to go up to get<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">there.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I must have fallen asleep, but what
happened when I was asleep<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">is
the weirdest
thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was wearing a white t-shirt and
shorts that night<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">and
the couch I
was on was a corner couch, there is 4 stairs going up to<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
kitchen and
beside the base of that are many stairs going to the<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">basement.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The couch in no more than 2 feet from the
stairs and the square<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">in
which the
connect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden I was walking
up the stairs to the<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">kitchen,
I was
wearing the same a white t-shirt and shorts, as I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">walking
up the
stairs I was turning to face something that wasn't there,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">and
that thing
was doing the same thing, I could not see this thing but I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">could
feel it
intensely, I was turning to look at it (even though I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">couldn't
see it)
and then all of a sudden I was on the platform where the<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">top
of the
basement stairs start and the kitchen stairs start.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was cross<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">legged
looking
down at my legs, I felt drugged somehow,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was trying to<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">look
up, when I
got my head up a little I could see glowing legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">reaching
out
trying to touch them, then I was up on my feet, like some<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">force
had all
control of my body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right then I saw
man, he had no hair and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">was
glowing, he
didn't look at me but we were a foot apart.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His face was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">looking
down and
his head was moving towards my shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was like he<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">was
trying to
put his head on my shoulder, as he motioned this I was slowly<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">moving
my head
and shoulders back, I was scared, really scared, then I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">awoke
on the
couch short of breath like I hadn't breathed for 15 minutes.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">strange
thing is
this all happened in the room I was sleeping and I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">wearing
the
exact same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realize I was asleep
but this wasn't a<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">normal
dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still have that creepy feeling
in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">live
there
anymore but my parents do, as was intrigued as to why weird<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">things
were
happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I thought back to when I
was a child I remember<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">bizarre
things
happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also asked my sister and
she also had some<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">stories
that she
couldn't explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing like this ever
happened to my<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">parents,
but I
still get chills when I think back to those experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

supernatural experience with the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">exception
of my
older brother Will and my dad. My mom had a dream after my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">brother
Peter
died at the age of 13 where she was in her dead grandmother's <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">house.
her
grandmother told her that Peter was upstairs and was busy. He had <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">gone
to a better
place and could not come down to visit. He was happy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My oldest sister Bonnie also had a dream
the
year she started high <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">school.
In it,
Peter was waking her up for school and he told her that she <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">would
never be
alone again. it was either that year or early in the next <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">year
that she
met Jaimme Mills. They are married and have a one-year-old <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">son.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span

Amber
were sleeping one night in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Tommy's
room
down stairs. Over the baby monitor they heard their son Zach <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">wake
up. He was
only one. Music was heard coming from the baby monitor from <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Zach
toy. A toy
that was kept across the room from Zach. Amber remembered <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">that
Zach slept
in Peter's old room and asked Tommy, "Tommy, what's that?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Its just Peter making sure that Zach
has a good night sleep," answered <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">my
brother as he
rolled over and went back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My older sister Mary Grace is the
only one
to have seen figures. She was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">sleeping
in
Peter's old room with Zach one night she cam out from <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Charlottetown
when she awoke to find a gray figure with a cap on starring <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">into
the crib.
She shook her head and the figure was gone. She asked Amber <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">if
she checked
on Zach or if anyone else did. No one else did. She went to a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">psychic
who told
her that a man died recently, an older figure who she loved <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">dearly
and now
he was watching over her. indeed the psychic was right, my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">grandfather
had
died the year earlier and always wore his hat when he <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">visited.
A few
weeks ago, she was sleeping on the couch upstairs when a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">figure,
a man,
came up and talked to her for a few hours and she returned to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">her
slumber. At
that time I was the only one sleeping downstairs, and I sleep <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">in
Peter’s old
room. I slept the whole night. No one we know of who is <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">living
was
talking to her that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I, too have had some experiences with
the
supernatural. the day before my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">sister
was
talking to the person from the basement, I was in my little <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">brother
Brandon's room playing Gamecube while he was making his bed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Suddenly,
his
quilt began to float as if someone was holding it with their <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">thumb
and index
finger. He called our mom to come see and she came <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">reluctantly.
Brandon moved his hands all around the point of the blanket but <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">it
would not
come down until he pulled it. it floated for about two minutes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
next night I
came up at 11:00 PM to use the bathroom. When I came out <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
rocking
chair in the living room was rocking on its own. it did it again <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">two
nights
later. my deceased grandfathers loved to rock in their rocking <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">chairs.
the
lights in my room will go on and off on their own. I’ve seen the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">switch
move up
and down before. I know the bulb is fine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span

is

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Hello-
I once
lived in both houses, once in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">70's
and in the
80's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first house had many cold
spots, in it, from<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">demon
or spirit
possession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
middle
house, I lived in, in the early 80's.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night, I had all<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
doors and
windows shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sitting in the
dinning room and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">sewing.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, there was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>cold wind that swept past me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Then,
in the
corner of the dinning room-the N.E. corner, there was a<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">book
case-the
doors were hard to open-and I had a book of the Life &amp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Times
of Jesus
in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, that one book came out
of there and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">crashed
onto the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, a knife levitated in the
kitchen<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">door-pointed
at
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I said, "If the Name of the
Father, the Son,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">and
the Holy
Spirit, get out of my home!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
breeze went thru me,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">again,
and
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved out of there a few days
later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
next
residence was on the corner of 12th and Kansas Ave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The house<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">has
long since
been torn down, but when I lived on the second floor, I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">saw
a baby girl
ghost run from the closet to the kitchen, then back<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">again.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was my son, cause he was that
age, at the time, but<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">this
ghost had
long blond hair and pink diaper pins on her diaper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">went
to look in
the back bedroom, but my son was still napping.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">looked
in the
closet, and there was one step in there, and the rest was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">boarded
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My ex-husband also saw the little baby
ghost,
too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">appear
very
real-and even had pink barrettes in her hair.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(My son also<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">had
blond hair,
at the time, but not long hair.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">That
was the
only time that I saw any ghosts, and I have seen allot in 52<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">years
of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Also,
when my
father died, in Nov. 1973,' the house that I was at was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">the
first house.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>I went over to the house,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">that
I lived in
and moved out of, to call the hospital, and found out he<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">was
dead!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coincidence??<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Thanks
for
listening to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I live in California,
now, and think about<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">those
happenings
above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

go
upstairs<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">As
a child I
grew up in Guadalajara, Jalisco in Mexico. My father being in the
United States
and my mother working two jobs I spent a lot of nights at relative's
homes and
friend's homes. One particular place I remember very well. My Dad's
sisters had
just purchased a home and I started spending a lot of time there. I
always saw
my aunts acting weird every time I started to go upstairs and would
tell me to
stay on the first floor to watch television or play, never would they
let me do
anything upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">About
two years
later I was finally told the reason I was never allowed to go upstairs,
I was
told the ghost of a little girl lived upstairs and did not like anyone
going up
there. I thought "yeah right, ghost"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Boy was I about to crap my pants that night. After everyone was
ready to
go to bed my aunt put a pair of shoes at the very top of the stairs and
when we
all went to bed I heard noises and all of the sudden I heard steps.
When we
turned on the lights the pair of shoes were about half way down the
stairs. As
soon as we turned out the lights you would hear the steps again until
the shoes
were at the very bottom. I was so scared I demanded to be taken to my
Grandma's
place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">About
a year
later I finally had the guts to go back to the house. I asked if I
could go
upstairs and my aunts agreed. Upstairs they still had boxes filled with
old
junk that they never unpacked because they also feared what would
happen if
they slept upstairs. As soon as I saw all the cool stuff in the boxes I
asked
if I could take something and they agreed. As I was leaning over to
take and
old puzzle the box moved away from me as if whatever it was did not
want me to
have anything out of it. I backed up and saw someone run into a room
that was
ate the end of the hall. I ran down stairs and out the door and would
never be
returning to the home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Every
time I
would see any of my aunts I would ask them about what else has happened
in the
home and one time they said they heard a little girl crying very
faintly. One
day they ran into the previous owner of the home and they asked him if
he had
ever noticed anything weird about the home. He said that he had noticed
some
weird stuff but never gave it much thought. But one thing that he did
tell my
aunts was that he had heard a family had lived in the home and the
children
slept upstairs but every time they all went to bed the father would
sneak
upstairs and take advantage of his little girl. It went on like that
for a year
until the mom found out and confronted the father. He stabbed and
killed his
wife when she threatened to leave along with their children then went
upstairs
and choked his daughter in her bed and left town with his son. No one
ever
heard of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
don't know if
the story is true but the place is definitely haunted. My aunts lived
there for
about 10 years and finally sold the place when they were financially
stable. I
have never heard of anything else since I left to come to the U.S. but
I sure
hope the new family that lives there doesn't go thru the same thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">A
Ghost in My
Old House<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">By:

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
never was a
believer in "Ghosts". I had heard many stories, but was a big
skeptic. Then a couple of incidents occurred and you better believe I
believe
now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Since
I had
moved into my house, we had heard the sound of pitter pattering of feet
in
rooms no one is in, our perfectly good microwave would also just go
nuts
beeping (like someone was playing with the buttons) for no apparent
reason. My
fiancée, DeAnna, always said, there is a ghost in this house. I would
call her
silly and always dismissed this as critters under the house and just
random
malfunctions with the microwave…..all things are explainable in my mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Then
one day my
brother Matt was over with his young child Christopher. Christopher did
not
talk yet and none of my kids nor DeAnna were home. We lived out in the
country
so we didn't have any close by neighbors. As we stood in the kitchen
debating
about politics. We heard a child's voice yell, "Uncle Matt he's got the
book!". Matt darted into the TV room with me close behind and there was
Christopher standing there with DeAnna's collector edition of Winnie
the Pooh
stories that had been on a higher shelf on the bookcase. DeAnna was
always
telling the kids that that was a valuable book and not to leave it out
or play
with it. Matt took the book from Christopher and placed it back on the
bookshelf. We then turned to each other and he asked me, "Did you hear
that"? I said, "yeah, someone said Uncle Matt, he's got the book".
We then searched the house and property and no one was around. We both
got the
chills and the hair on our bodies stood up. Weird…...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">A
couple of
weeks later, DeAnna had asked the kids who left out the milk, and they
replied
in a snotty childlike manner, "the ghost did". That night they were
long asleep, we had gone to bed and DeAnna heard some noise coming from
the
kitchen. She got up and there were the kids fully dressed and fixing
there
cereal. DeAnna asked, "What are you doing"? My son Richie replied, "he
told us that it was time to get up and go to school so we did"……ghost
revenge maybe?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Not
too long
after that, the kids were in bed asleep, DeAnna was in the back bedroom
taking
a bath. I was watching TV laying on the couch. I was facing the hall
that had
the laundry room off to the right and I could see about half the dryer.
Before
her bath DeAnna had loaded a load to be dried so the dryer was going.
Suddenly
I see the dryer door gently open and close turning off the dryer.
Puzzled, I
got up to see who was there and no one was around. I checked the kids
room and
they were sound asleep. I walked to the back bathroom and Deanna was
still in
the bath. I asked her if, per chance, she had walked around and shut
off the
dryer. She said no…….. I went back to the living room and kicked back
on the
couch to watch TV. About 10 minutes passed and my daughter come out and
was
whining, "I don't know where it is". I said. "what
sweetie"? She cried, "I don't know where it is"? I replied,
"you don't know where what is", knowing she must have been talking in
her sleep. She said, " the jacket, he wants his jacket and I don't know
where it is, now he won't leave me alone"! I asked, "who
sweetie"? She said, "the little boy, he wants his jacket and he won't
leave me alone". Man did I get the heebie jeebies. I carried her back
to
her room and she was in a dead sleep within seconds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We
never felt
threatened by the ghost. When the sounds on the microwave got too
annoying
DeAnna would lecture as if she was talking to a child and the noise
would stop.
We bought the house from my ex-in-laws who built the house. They never
had any
children of there own (that I know of), though they adopted and raised
three
(as far as I know). We have since moved and the people who bought our
house
rebuilt it from the foundation up. I don't know if they have ever
experienced
any incidents. I have not since. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
do believe
that spirits are out there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">After
re-reading
the article I wrote to you about earlier. I noticed I had made a few
major
errors. Thinking it was on the west wing. And hence this corrected
version of
my response. Also attached are two drawings. mhi.jpg shows the entire
building.
ward.jpg shows a rough drawing of one of the wards on the east wing.
Also
included are two odd happenings I experienced. One of which has nothing
to do
with ghost. But definitely hints of some very unusual doctor behavior I
observed. And dos give an idea of just how weird this place really was!
Frankly
I am not surprised that there were a lot more ghost stories emanating
from that
place!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Possible
source
of phenomena? <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">One.
It was a
sound caused by wind pushing an open door closed. These doors were made
of
heavy gage steel. And when subjected to a breeze. Tended to accelerate
slowly.
Gaining speed as the door was forced closed. (Hence a person who just
opened a
door along with maybe a window or two. Would not even have noticed the
door
closing. Until he/she was well out of the area. At which time there
would be a
resounding metallic bang! 'If there as any such thing as the Slammer?
This is
definitely it!') The fact the wards are aligned north/south. Insured
that the
prevailing winds. Which in Iowa move in a general east/west direction.
Would
hit the windows square on. Making for an espely drafty building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Two.
It could
have been the sound of furniture being moved about in preparation for
cleaning.
(Through this usually tended to occur much earlier in the day. But the
procedure basically consisted of. Moving all the furniture to one side
of the
room. At which time the floor was mopped. Then the furniture was moved
to the
other side of the room and the rest of the floor mopped. Oh and yes! It
was
quite a job! And was done daily!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Three.
From
about 1969 to about 1973 or so. The ward directly below where the
person heard
the weird sounds. Was the adolescent ward. (Ward 2 east it was called.)
And
below that. From pre-1969 to about 1973 or so. Was the children’s ward.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Also
there was
one memorable suicide on ward 2 east circa 1971. That I remember very
vividly
due to my indirect involvement in the aftermath. There was a teen age
girl. Who
horded her sleeping pills. Who used them to end her life while out on a
family
visit. The reason I recall this so vividly was due to at the same time
of the
tragic incident. A new policy was made on the ward. Where anybody
caught
hording sleeping pills was immediately taken off the medication. Well
you see.
I was on the medication and did not want to me. So I made up a little
lie.
Saying I was hording them. And was taken off. Who said doctors were
smart? Oh
and after that incident. While the staff were kind of paranoid over
additional
suicides. Would often say I was going to well. You know. Only to then
break out
laughing due to the panicked look on there faces. (Oh I even falsely
confessed
to setting a fire on ward 2 east. That of course was set by somebody
else. So I
would be in lock up and not have to go to phys-ed! They never caught
the guy
who actually set the fires due to my interference. Yea I was quite a
handful in
my youth.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Also
the
building being of concrete construction with a lot of pipes and air
ducts.
Running both horizontally and vertically. Made it easy for sounds to
travel
from one part of the structure to another. The observer often hearing
sounds
appearing to come from un-expected directions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Must
say though
the report of apparitions in the hallways. Is intriguing. For I
remember a
staff member entering my room on ward 1 east. Which was two floors down
from
where the guy said he heard something. Who asked me if I had a bat in
my room.
And thinking he was referring to a plastic baseball bat. I had. I went
looking
for the item. At which he then realizing I was thinking of the wrong
kind of
bat. Said no. I am talking the animal. He then said somebody said he
thought he
saw a bat in his room! This occurred around about 1969. Only I
dismissed it off
as simply being well. It was a mental hospital after all. I my self
never did
see anything paranormal. When I was there. Through if the person who
wrote the
article on your web page. Heard the sounds circa 1969-1972? He may have
heard
me slamming a door. Which I often did sense it made a very loud
threatening yet
harmless noise. That drove the staff nuts. Who knows? I may be your
ghost? I
also seem to recall having thrown a chair or two as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">One
other odd
thing happened when I was there. Which if you have any idea as to what
this
could be? (Sure seems to be some kind of experiment under way. But why?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
pool hall
incident. Circa. Summer of 1969. Location. In pool hall in basement of
west
wing of the MHI in Mt. Pleasent Ia. On the day in question. I along
with
several other residents of ward one east. (Which was the children’s
ward.) Were
in the pool hall during a recreation period. The pool hall as it was
called.
Consisted of two connected medium sized rooms. Located in the basement
of the
west wing. On one side were pool tables. The other room was used as a
lounge
area. With seating for maybe two dozen people and a television set. I
was
setting in the lounge area. Facing towards the entrance door to the
room. When
this man walked into the room. The man was in his late twenties or
thirties in
age. Tall in stature with dark gray medium length hair. The man was
wearing
leather restraints. Which consisted of a belt around the mans waist and
leather
cuffs around each wrist. Which were fastened to the belt. Along with
one or
maybe two orderly escorts. The man then stopped in front of me. As if
trying to
make sure I saw him. Even moving his bound arms as if to draw my
attention to
what he was wearing! He then moved into the other room. Followed. I saw
him then
playing pool briefly before leaving the pool hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Now
what is
unusual here of course is the location.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Since one normally dos not parade a violent mental patent past a
group
of minor children.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a pool hall!<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(Think?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Pool cues = shisklabob?)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
would be housed in an isolation unit on the violent ward!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>And this is the only time I ever observed
anything like this!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any medical
setting.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I really do get the
impression.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But why?<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Remember this was 1969.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Iowa.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Not modern day Castro st.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>San
Francisco.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And nothing unusual
occurred
after wards either.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aka.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nobody came up and tried to conceal me
or
treat me etc.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Its as if once they
found
out what they wanted to know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did
nothing with the information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">My
names Ashley.
I'm 17 years old. I live in a small town called Homer City in PA. When
I was in
6th grade (5 years ago) my parents got a divorce, me n my dad moved in
w/ my
aunt for 3 months, then he found a house in Homer City. (we used to
live in a
mining town outside of Chg. had gone to the same school all my life
until that
move. the reason he bought a house in HC is so I could go back to
school w/ my
friends) The house we moved into was really old so old it only has 4
heat
decks. Me &amp; my little sister shared a room &amp; my older sister
had her
own room where shed do tero cards (spelled wrong but u get the idea
haha). My
older sister ended up moving out after she graduated high school. So of
course
I got her room. I didn't realize it at the time but I believe she open
up a
portal (in my room, hers at the time) but never closed it. This isn't
when
weird things started to happen w/ me but this is my favorite
interaction. I had
just got done moving my stuff in to my "new" room when I was laying
on my bed, which was beside a window, talking on the phone to my
friend. When
suddenly the window started shaking really bad, almost like someone
wanted in.
That day the wind was not blowing at all &amp; there’s no way somebody
can get
up to my window unless they had a ladder. L e everyone else would
probably do I
ran down stairs. The next day I was just sitting in my room talking on
the
phone again to the same person. I opened my closet door to find a
little girl
I’d say about 3 or 4 sitting there in a dress w/ her knees pressed up
to her
chest. She obviously was dead but she looked as if she was out of a
movie. She
also had vomit all over her dress &amp; face &amp; was crying. She
looked so
scared. I screamed dropped my phone &amp; went running down stairs. I
picked up
the other phone to see if my friend was still there &amp; she was. I
had left
my phone on that I had dropped. we both heard someone moving across my
floor
like they were crawling. We then heard the phone being fumbled around
&amp; then
it shut off. Like she made sure I had got it so I could still talk to
my
friend. You're probably thinking it was probably my dad or my sister.
But my
sister was playing on the front porch &amp; my dad was outside mowing.
Who else
could it be? For about 3 days I felt as if someone was following me
around the
house &amp; watched me while I slept. On the third day my dad was in
the attic
going through stuff that was left up there. He found a picture &amp;
brought it
to me while I was on the computer. He was like I thought you'd like
this &amp;
handed it to me. I looked at it &amp; just got the biggest smile ever.
It was a
old black &amp; white picture of the little girl w/ an older lady &amp;
a
little boy in front of MY HOUSE! I thought of it as a sign that the
little girl
was there &amp; just wanted a friend or something. I keep that picture
in my
room, sitting on my computer desk. It never leaves. Its like a band to
keep all
evil out of my room closing the portal my sister opened. I like to
think of her
as my safety &amp; through that picture she watches over me. After
finding the
pick. no evil interactions have happened. But all the time I hear them
(the
little boy &amp; girl) walking around upstairs, opening &amp; closing
doors,
walking up &amp; down the steps, &amp; I hear clicking noises like t y
need me
but when I follow them it gets farther &amp; farther away or moves to a
diff
room. Often I see whitish blue balls of energy zoom up the steps. My 2
friends
know they r welcome in my house to stay. Well simply because it was
theirs
first. I trust them &amp; they trust me. They have never harmed me but
brought
me noting but protection. Inside my house &amp; out (like when I’m
driving I
always feel the little girl there). Or when I need to talk I talk to
her she
doesn’t answer me w/ words but w/ actions. She also likes to miss place
things
of mine that show up other places a few days later. I have other
stories but
like I said this one is my favorite &amp; it has allot of meaning. You
can
believe me or not, its your choice. But I feel everyone has a guardian
angel.
Mines the little girl, my safety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
read about
your site on DailyInbox, and thought I should share my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">My
Mom passed
away on August 11th at 92 --at home and in my arms. We have had a
conflicted
life together and weren’t always close.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">The
next
morning, as I was sitting at my dining room table eating my cold
cereal, the
smoke alarm went off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have lived in my
house for 17 years, and the only time that alarm has ever gone off is
when I
was cooking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would not stop. I had to
take it down and hit it to make it stop.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The second day while I was home taking care of things, it went
off 8
times, each for a few seconds, or until I said, “Mom, it’s okay.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I know you are fine. Now go off and have a
good time!”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Twice, other people heard
it, one working in the yard, and one on the phone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It happened once more, one week after her
passing, and it hasn’t happened since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">My
mother had
nightly “visits” by family members long gone, and would tell us about

I'm not
frightened by the cemetery in my home town.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would spend hours walking through it night or day looking at
the
tombstones and imagining what these people were like while they were
alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt a calming sensation as soon
as I entered
the gates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that change about two
months ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had walked up to the
cemetery at about 2am (its never locked up since its in the middle of
the
businesses).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was going to find a place
to sit with my flashlight and write.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
started back where the oldest graves are.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Coming from the woods in the very back of the graveyard I caught
a
glimpse of some kind of light, when I looked in that direction it was
gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Didn't think anything about it and
kept going.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few steps later I heard
someone say "stop turn around".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I froze in place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like
it came from right beside me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I swear I
stood there for about two minutes scared out of my mind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then I heard "go now!".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I turned
around and took off
running!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know why after me
going there for two years these spirits or whatever it was, no longer
wanted me
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I haven't been back to the older
part since then and no longer go after dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Day<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
was at my
friend's house 2 father's day ago. He was staying with his elderly
grandma
because she had vertigo and could no longer care for herself without
other
people's help. He was staying there with his girlfriend and they had
the
basement to themselves. The three of us were hanging out playing dice
and I asked
my friend about his grandma. He explained that is was not his real
grandma, it
was actually his mother's mother-in-law from a previous marriage and
her
ex-husband had died and his mother was the only one left to care for
her. As we
were playing dice I asked about his grandma's family. He explained that
her
husband had died years ago and her son had also died. Just as he was
talking
about her husband we heard her walking around upstairs. Since she was
semi-crazy due to her illness he had to go upstairs and attend to her.
Just
then we heard her say plain as day "No, get away from there or he will
hear you" the voice was his grandma's and we freaked out because she
was
talking to somebody. We went upstairs and checked the house and found
her asleep
in her bed. We thought it was very odd and figured she somehow must
have
hurried back to her room while we were walking upstairs. Anyway, we
went
downstairs and continued our game of dice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">A
few minutes
later we heard her walking around upstairs again and now my friend was
pissed
because we were again interrupted. He went upstairs and after a few
minutes my
friend yelled downstairs that his grandma was nowhere to be found. So
me and
his girlfriend went upstairs and we started looking for her. When we
went
upstairs we heard a knock at the front door and it was his grandma. Now
this is
where things got weird. Due to her vertigo she is prone to do very
unnatural
things like wander outside and stuff like that. Since she was prone to
do
things like that they rigged her house up so that it was impossible for
her to
leave the house. Basically she was locked inside the house. She has no
possible
way of leaving the house on her own. She cant even figure out how to
unlock a
door. Once we let her back in we asked her how she got outside. She
said
"the man of the house let me outside" The three of us were taken back
by this to say the least. We checked all of the windows in the house
and they
were all sealed shut and locked from the outside as well as the inside.
We asked
her where she got out of the house at and she said the front door. The
strange
thing about that is that the front door has a latch at the top of the
door and
in order to open the front door you have to take a pin out of the
latch. When
we opened the front door it still had the pin at the top of the door so
it is
impossible to go outside through the front door and have the pin still
at the
top of the door. We checked the backdoor and the pin was also at the
top of the
door. Once again we asked her how she got outside and she said "the man
of
the house let me outside". We were all a little freaked and put her
back
to bed and went downstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Once
we got down
there we all came to the conclusion that "the man of the house" was
obviously her husband who had died years earlier. A few minutes later
my
friends girlfriend realized that today was Father Day's and we once
again came
to a conclusion that her husband had come back to visit her on Father's
Day.
Once we sat back down we looked at the dice on the table because we
were about
to begin playing again and 3 dice were separated from the rest and they
were on
the numbers 6, 6 and 6. Things then got real spooky. We believe that
through
the numbers 666 the ghost had given us a sign that he was indeed there
and the
numbers were the only logical way we could have showed us that. Not
that he was
an evil ghost but if the numbers the dice were on where 4 or 6 or 7 it
would
mean nothing to us but since the numbers were on 6, 6 and 6 it got our
attention very quickly. After that I was afraid to go upstairs myself
and had
to have them both come upstairs with me to let me out of the house. As
I was
walking to my car I had the absolute feeling I was being watched and I
was
scared to death to look back. I hurried to my car and drove off as
quick as I
could. I have not been back to the house since. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Another
strange
occurrence happened this last Father's Day. I had not seen my friend in
over a
year because he moved away after this grandma had passed on and he had
to get
his own place. I went over his new house and we were talking about what
had
happened that night. Just then his girlfriend remarked that that day
was
Father's Day. I hadn’t seen him in over a year and the day we finally
meet up
again was on Father's Day....too weird. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">My
name is
Annie. I am freshmen in high school, that’s really all I feel
comfortable
saying. I feel I experienced some kind of haunting or something in
health class
today, and I’m really sort of freaked out. I believe I came in contact
with the
ghost of a boy who went to our school and died a few years ago. I knew
nothing
about him to begin with, only that someone in our school had died
within the
past two years. I wasn’t even at the school at the time, like I said,
I’m a
freshmen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">It
happened in
health class. We had a very small class that day because most of the
students
had gone to listen to the president speak at a nearby park. I t was me
and
about seven other kids. The class clown was being a jerk as usual; I’m
going to
call him Don because I did not ask permission to put him in this. Don
was
goofing of, hiding from the teacher in a book cabinet. He had been in
there for
awhile when I started to fell dizzy and get a headache. I couldn’t
shake this
presence I felt, as though I was being watched. I figured, oh it’s
close to
Halloween and I’m letting imagination get the better of me. But after a
few
moments I couldn’t stand it and I looked up from my work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">There
was a
black shadow in the corner near the book cabinet; I could se it clearly
against
the white dry erase board. As I was staring at it, the headache got
worse.
Then, a though popped into my head. ‘A’ I though,” his name starts with
an A.”
I ran of a list of names that sated with A, I had a feeling it was
Andrew.
Then, I suddenly felt Don should not be in that closet. He really did
not
belong there. Some of the other boys in the class tied the door to the
cabinet
shut, and I felt a stab of anger, and it wasn’t my own. I started to
feel
extremely sick, but to my relief the bell rang and we left. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
tried to
forget about it, but I couldn’t. I started to ask what the name of the
boy was
who had died. No one seemed to know. But I finally asked a track coach,
he told
me the boys name was Alex. I freaked out and ran to get my friend
Maria. I told
her about what I had seen and see took me to her friend Robin. Robin is
a
wiccan, and he told me that I had seen a ghost. The told me he had
known Alex,
and that my hunch about the closet had been right. He had done “stuff”
in that
closet. That’s all Robin would tell me, I suspect it had something to
do with
Wiccen magic. Don, over heard this conversation, and actually became
very
frightened, thinking that the Ghost of Alex was out to get him. I
explained
that I did not think Alex was a hostile spirit; he just wanted Don out
of his
closet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Don
remained
unconvinced, and I told him that if he really wanted to be sure, go
apologize
to him. This was more for Don’s sake than it was for Alex’s, I really
don’t
think he cared. While Don and Maria went to apologize, robin sat me
down and
asked me if I could describe Alex to him. I closed my eyes and it was
like I
was looking right into a profile. He was pretty tall, and thin. He had
sandy
blondish brown hair that he wore flared in the front and dark eyes that
were
hidden behind a pair of silver rimmed glasses. I told this to robin,
who didn’t
say anything. I went o to tell him how he wore a lot of black and dark
colors.
I told him that he really liked this one blue sweater with a name on
the front
that had something to do with the stars, but he wasn’t wearing it. He
was
wearing a black t-shirt with a white strip that went right across his
chest.
When I opened my eyes, Robin was staring at me in shock. He then told
me that I
had described Alex perfectly, from the silver rimmed sunglasses that he
liked
to wear and the hair style. He then told me his favorite sweater had
been a
navy blue hooded sweater with the name of the band “The Artaris.”
Written
across the front. But he still seemed some what shaken, and I soon
realized it
was with good reason. Robin told me that I had described Alex wearing
exactly
the same outfit he had last seen him in two days before he had died.<span

Ghost in my
Old Home<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">By:Ken.Valencia@escocorp.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
never was a
believer in "Ghosts". I had heard many stories, but was a big
skeptic. Then a couple of incidents occurred and you better believe I
believe
now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Since
I had
moved into my house, we had heard the sound of pitter pattering of feet
in
rooms no one is in, our perfectly good microwave would also just go
nuts
beeping (like someone was playing with the buttons) for no apparent
reason. My
fiancée, DeAnna, always said, there is a ghost in this house. I would
call her
silly and always dismissed this as critters under the house and just
random
malfunctions with the microwave…..all things are explainable in my mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Then
one day my
brother Matt was over with his young child Christopher. Christopher did
not
talk yet and none of my kids nor DeAnna were home. We lived out in the
country
so we didn't have any close by neighbors. As we stood in the kitchen
debating
about politics. We heard a child's voice yell, "Uncle Matt he's got the
book!".
Matt darted into the TV room with me close behind and there was
Christopher
standing there with DeAnna's collector edition of Winnie the Pooh
stories that
had been on a higher shelf on the bookcase. DeAnna was always telling
the kids
that that was a valuable book and not to leave it out or play with it.
Matt
took the book from Christopher and placed it back on the bookshelf. We
then
turned to each other and he asked me, "Did you hear that"? I said,
"yeah, someone said Uncle Matt, he's got the book". We then searched
the house and property and no one was around. We both got the chills
and the
hair on our bodies stood up. Weird…...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">A
couple of
weeks later, DeAnna had asked the kids who left out the milk, and they
replied
in a snotty childlike manner, "the ghost did". That night they were
long asleep, we had gone to bed and DeAnna heard some noise coming from
the
kitchen. She got up and there were the kids fully dressed and fixing
there
cereal. DeAnna asked, "What are you doing"? My son Richie replied,
"he told us that it was time to get up and go to school so we
did"……ghost revenge maybe?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Not
too long
after that, the kids were in bed asleep, DeAnna was in the back bedroom
taking
a bath. I was watching TV laying on the couch. I was facing the hall
that had
the laundry room off to the right and I could see about half the dryer.
Before
her bath DeAnna had loaded a load to be dried so the dryer was going.
Suddenly
I see the dryer door gently open and close turning off the dryer.
Puzzled, I
got up to see who was there and no one was around. I checked the kids
room and
they were sound asleep. I walked to the back bathroom and Deanna was
still in
the bath. I asked her if, per chance, she had walked around and shut
off the
dryer. She said no…….. I went back to the living room and kicked back
on the
couch to watch TV. About 10 minutes passed and my daughter come out and
was
whining, "I don't know where it is". I said. "what
sweetie"? She cried, "I don't know where it is"? I replied, "you
don't know where what is", knowing she must have been talking in her
sleep. She said, " the jacket, he wants his jacket and I don't know
where
it is, now he won't leave me alone"! I asked, "who sweetie"? She
said, "the little boy, he wants his jacket and he won't leave me
alone". Man did I get the heebie jeebies. I carried her back to her
room
and she was in a dead sleep within seconds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We
never felt
threatened by the ghost. When the sounds on the microwave got too
annoying
DeAnna would lecture as if she was talking to a child and the noise
would stop.
We bought the house from my ex-in-laws who built the house. They never
had any
children of there own (that I know of), though they adopted and raised
three
(as far as I know). We have since moved and the people who bought our
house rebuilt
it from the foundation up. I don't know if they have ever experienced
any
incidents. I have not since. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">I
do believe
that spirits are out there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>side of
the block. It continued on
right down to the front of<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
building and there turned left over
the archway. The end<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>of the
corridor was bricked off at what
seemed to be about<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>halfway
over the archway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I hope
that sets up a picture in your
mind as it is necessary<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>so that
one can understand how several
of us saw what<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>follows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
is normal in boarding schools there
is a lights out time<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and
one is supposed to go to sleep,
often we talked or<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>quietly
mucked about for some time.
Any large amount of noise<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>would
bring the matron along with all
her fury.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One night
after lights out I was
chatting with the boy at the<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>window end
of the dormitory and a light
from the small window<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(barred)
at the back of the tower
caught my eye. It appeared<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to be
coming from a candle as it
flickered somewhat.2 or 3 of<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the others
who were awake were told to
come and look and we<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>all agreed
basically that there
shouldn't/couldn't be a light<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in that
room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
scenario was repeated on many
nights, often with shadows<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>moving
around in the room. The thing
that really got to us was<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that at
times one could see that
something came between us<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and the
candle and yet the candle flame
could still be seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All
our questions to the matron and teachers
were never<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>answered
and we were told to ignore the
whole thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was
no entranceway to the tower
from any side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We asked
in the village for information
and were told that<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
building was haunted, had been for
many years. No one<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>could or
would tell us anything more
except to leave well<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have since made enquires on this and
it is
admitted that the<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>building is still haunted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
