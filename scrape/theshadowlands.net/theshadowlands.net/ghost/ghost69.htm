<P>
<P><B>I would like to share my brothers experience as well as my own.  I
was always</B>
<P><B>pretty skeptical when it came to ghosts.  I never said that they don't
exist.</B>
<P><B>I always wanted to believe in them, but I had never seen one.  This
all</B>
<P><B>changed when my older brother started having some sightings at his
house in a</B>
<P><B>western suburb of Chicago.  It all started about 10 years ago.  One
night my</B>
<P><B>brother was letting his dog out in the backyard before he turned in.
 In the</B>
<P><B>middle of the lawn he noticed a grayish mass.  As he looked more closely,
the</B>
<P><B>form began to take the shape of what looked like a person kneeling
in prayer.</B>
<P><B>The dog was oblivious to this shape so my brother just shrugged it
off as his</B>
<P><B>eyes playing tricks on him.  Ever since that night my brother has had
numerous</B>
<P><B>experiences.  About one week later my brother was exiting his front
door.  As</B>
<P><B>he walked to his car he once again saw this "shape" kneeling on his
front</B>
<P><B>lawn.  To my brothers horror, the shape this time stood up and started
walking</B>
<P><B>towards him as if to greet him.  He turned and ran back to the house.
 Once</B>
<P><B>inside he became sick to his stomach.  He didn't understand.  Was
someone</B>
<P><B>playing tricks on him?  About 6 months passed.  My brother was watching
TV</B>
<P><B>late one night when his wife called him to bed.  He turned off the
TV and</B>
<P><B>started heading to the top of the stairs where his wife was waiting
for him.</B>
<P><B>When he got about half way up, a small ball of light materialized
between</B>
<P><B>them.  This ball stayed in the same place for a few seconds then
suddenly</B>
<P><B>"whisked" behind my brother and disapeared.  Both my brother and
sister-in-law</B>
<P><B>knew now that they were not alone in the house.</B>
<P><B>My brother called me the next day to tell me what had happened.  I
thought</B>
<P><B>maybe he was drinking or something.  I told him, "Well, has this thing
tried</B>
<P><B>to harm you in anyway?"  He said, "no."  So I told him just to relax
and</B>
<P><B>eventually this thing will go away.  I was wrong.  Whatever was in
and around</B>
<P><B>his house apparently liked it there and had no intentions of leaving.
 A few</B>
<P><B>days later my brother heard something rattling around in the bushes
in front</B>
<P><B>of his house.  He opened the blinds and stared out the window.  There
in the</B>
<P><B>darkness, staring back at him was a face.  My brother froze.  The face
was</B>
<P><B>that of an Indian, old and wrinkled.  Finally realizing what he was
looking</B>
<P><B>at, he closed the blinds and just sat down on his sofa.  About a minute
later,</B>
<P><B>a sweet and heavy scent permiated the entire room.  Then the ball of
light he</B>
<P><B>had seen before materialized in his living room.  He was scared but
not as</B>
<P><B>scared as he was before.  He thought back to what I said.  This apparently
was</B>
<P><B>not a hostile spirt.  It just seemed very interseted in my brother.
 My</B>
<P><B>brother lives in a town which borders the Des Plaines river and the
land was</B>
<P><B>once the property of Alexander Robinson, chief of the Potawatomi, Chippewa
and</B>
<P><B>Ottawa Indians.  He was given a large plot of land for his aid during
the Ft.</B>
<P><B>Dearborn Massacre.  He is buried along with his family no more than
1/2 a mile</B>
<P><B>from my brothers house.  His final resting place, in a forest preserve
has</B>
<P><B>always been a hot spot for supernatural activity.  My brother was
convinced</B>
<P><B>that the man he saw was infact an Indian.  Maybe even Alexander
Robinson</B>
<P><B>himself!  Over the next few years, my brother and this spirit lived
together</B>
<P><B>in peace in the house.  Every once and a while the spirit would make
himself</B>
<P><B>known.  A ball of light appearing here and there, a sweet and pungent
smell.</B>
<P><B>It was almost as if this spirit was a new member of his family.
 Occasionally</B>
<P><B>he would call me and tell me stories.  I would play along with him,
never</B>
<P><B>really believing his stories.  That all changed one night back in 1992.
 I was</B>
<P><B>at my brothers house watching a baseball game.  I was sitting on the
couch and</B>
<P><B>just happened to glance up his set of stairs.  Up there in the darkness
I saw</B>
<P><B>it!  AlI I saw was its head.  It had no facial features.  I only saw
two eyes</B>
<P><B>looking down at me.  I jumped out of my seat.  I knew I wasn't seeing
things.</B>
<P><B>My brother said, "relax, he won't hurt you."  Just as he said that,
it</B>
<P><B>disapeared.  I had just seen my first ghost.  I have been a believer
in the</B>
<P><B>paranormal ever since.  </B>
<P><B>Probably the most graphic incident happened to my brother just a little
over a</B>
<P><B>year ago.  The spirit spoke to him!  It was late at night and my brother
was</B>
<P><B>lying in bed.  He was just about to doze off when all of a sudden he
heard a</B>
<P><B>deep voice say, "Wake up.  They're trying to get in."  My brother jumped
out</B>
<P><B>of bed.  As he did he noticed a bright light out side his window. 
He looked</B>
<P><B>out and saw a police car driving slowly up the street shining his spot
light</B>
<P><B>at the homes across the street.  My brother would later learn that
the house</B>
<P><B>across the street was broken into that night.  The spirt was warning
my</B>
<P><B>brother.  He is convinced that someone was trying to get in that night.
 Well,</B>
<P><B>thats my story.  My brother still lives in the house with his Indian
friend.</B>
<P><B>He's says that he will never sell his house.  He doesn't want to leave
his</B>
<P><B>friend behind.  My brother has become very spiritual since his experiences.
 I</B>
<P><B>think this is proof that ghosts are not out there to harm us but to
guide us.</B>
<P><B>Thanks for reading, I hope you can print it on your sight.</B>

<P>
<P><B>The one and only McDonald's in Burlington Vt. has at least one spook.
It</B>
<P><B>seems that it was built on the old foundation of what was a theater.
When</B>
<P><B>the theater burnt to the ground. And the story goes that there were
two</B>
<P><B>children who died in the fire along with an old man that tried to
save</B>
<P><B>them.  Many staff have reported that they have heard thing banging
around</B>
<P><B>in the basement, some have seen thing move by them selves, ie..
coffee</B>
<P><B>cups have been known to fly across the room with out any help. And
on one</B>
<P><B>occasion an old man came in out of the rain and went in to the
bathroom,</B>
<P><B>this is not unusual as many street people use the bathrooms at this
store.</B>
<P><B>What was weird about this time was that no one ever saw him come out,
when</B>
<P><B>the manager went in to check on him all she saw were his watery foot</B>
<P><B>prints going in, there are no windows in the mens room. Is this a
true</B>
<P><B>story? If you ask the corporation they would say no, but just ask the</B>
<P><B>staff who saw their coffee cups fly across the break room.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=monk>The Monk</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  litonjualf@earthlink.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi!  I wrote of an experience with the spirit of my mother a couple</B>
<P><B>weeks back, a nice ghostly experience.  Now I have a different</B>
<P><B>experience to tell.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was about 6 or so years ago, at the same apartment I wrote about
in</B>
<P><B>my last story.</B>
<P><B>Very early one morning I suddenly awakened.  I looked at the bedside</B>
<P><B>clock and saw it was 3:00 A.M.  I wasn't nervous or anything, I
figured</B>
<P><B>I must have just finished a dream cycle and woke up. I decided to use</B>
<P><B>the restroom and exactly three minutes later was back in bed (I again</B>
<P><B>had looked at the clock).  I knew I was wide awake and was settling
down</B>
<P><B>to go back to sleep when suddenly my body felt weird. A feeling of</B>
<P><B>paralysis came over me, where I could only move my fingers and my
head.</B>
<P><B>I sleep on the right side of the bed, and when I looked over to that</B>
<P><B>side there was a dark figure right by the side of the bed.  It looked</B>
<P><B>like a monk, dressed in robes and a cowl, but with the cowl pulled
over</B>
<P><B>the head so I couldn't see the face (not that I was really trying to,</B>
<P><B>mind you!)</B>
<P>
<P><B>I saw the monk reach over me and insert his hands into my heart area</B>
<P><B>(that's the only way I can describe it).  I saw the form of his hands
go</B>
<P><B>into my body and even felt their presence inside me, doing something
to</B>
<P><B>my heart.  As I mentioned, I was mostly paralyzed, but was trying
with</B>
<P><B>all my might to awaken my husband, who was sleeping soundly next to
me.</B>
<P><B>I looked over and tried to scream, but could only manage the very</B>
<P><B>faintest moan, barely audible even to me.  My fingers were trying in</B>
<P><B>vain to touch him but weren't close enough to reach him.  I was</B>
<P><B>definitely on my own!</B>
<P>
<P><B>The only thing I could control was my mind, and I started silently</B>
<P><B>praying for this thing to leave me, to get out.  I was able to use
a</B>
<P><B>force of will from inside me and somehow, between this and all my</B>
<P><B>praying, this forced the monk to move away and dissolve.</B>
<P><B>As soon as this happened I was released from the paralysis and I
broke</B>
<P><B>out in a cold sweat.  I didn't awaken my husband just then, I wanted
to</B>
<P><B>be sure I really wasn't dreaming.  I wasn't!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, for this to happen once was bad enough, but the monk apparently</B>
<P><B>wasn't through 'reorganizing' my innards!</B>
<P>
<P><B>About a month to 6 weeks after the first incident, I got another
visit</B>
<P><B>from the Monk.</B>
<P><B>Again, it was very early in the morning (not sure of the time this
time</B>
<P><B>around as I didn't get a chance to look at the clock), and I awakened</B>
<P><B>suddenly with the distinct feeling that someone or something was
there</B>
<P><B>beside me.  Again, the paralysis came over me as before, and as I</B>
<P><B>looked, there again was the monk beside my bed.  This time I watched
him</B>
<P><B>go to the foot of the bed, whereupon he climbed on the bed and
straddled</B>
<P><B>my legs.</B>
<P><B>He then reached his hands into my solar plexus region and as before
I</B>
<P><B>could feel my organs being moved around. No pain of any kind, just
a</B>
<P><B>very unsettling sensation of energy inside my body.  Of course, this
was</B>
<P><B>not something I particularly cared to have happen to me, and after
again</B>
<P><B>trying in vain to somehow awaken my sleeping husband, used a
combination</B>
<P><B>of prayer and inner will to somehow "push" him off of me and away.</B>
<P><B>This I was able to do once again, but even after I was able to move</B>
<P><B>again and woken up my husband and told him about it, I could still</B>
<P><B>"feel" this energy in my body, no matter how hard I tried to push it
out</B>
<P><B>of me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure what this all means.  I was of course terrified at the</B>
<P><B>time, but I am puzzled as to what the meaning of all this was.  I am
not</B>
<P><B>exactly sure if this was a negative spirit or a positive one.  I was</B>
<P><B>scared, but mainly because of the experience itself, not because I
was</B>
<P><B>threatened.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I should also mention that these were not my only experiences with
this</B>
<P><B>entity, whatever it is.  I have had at least two dreams that I can</B>
<P><B>remember in the years previous to these occurrences where the Monk</B>
<P><B>appeared.  Not threatening, but not exactly jolly and calming,
either.</B>
<P><B>More like a presence that was around but I wasn't sure what it's
purpose</B>
<P><B>was.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There were also coinciding odd incidents in the same time frame as
the</B>
<P><B>Monk visits.</B>
<P><B>On two occassions, about a month apart, I would find a tiny scoop of</B>
<P><B>flesh taken out of my left middle finger, in the same spot both
times.</B>
<P><B>It was bizarre - I only noticed it as I was reaching for something,
and</B>
<P><B>saw that it was cut with precision, and there was no blood or pain.
 I</B>
<P><B>searched the sheets of the bed and anything around the bed that might</B>
<P><B>have caused this to happen, but there was nothing. And it happened
a</B>
<P><B>month later, as I mentioned.  I still have the scar.  Have never been</B>
<P><B>able to explain it, but I have wondered if the wounds and the Monk
were</B>
<P><B>connected in any way.</B>
<P>
<P><B>If anyone has any ideas out there, please do contact me!  I'd be
really</B>
<P><B>interested to hear them.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=my>My Aunt's Farmhouse</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  llizard@prodigy.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>       My Aunt and Uncle bought a farm in Pennsylvania </B>
<P><B>in the mid-fifties. In 1964 I was five years old. I was staying with
my Aunt </B>
<P><B>because my Mother was going to have another baby. My Aunt kept close
tabs </B>
<P><B>on me and I was rarely out alone. One day I was outside playing by
the </B>
<P><B>barn. Suddenly a little boy appeared. He was so vivid I can still </B>
<P><B>see him. He was wearing fifties clothes, an aviator type hat and a
plaid </B>
<P><B>jacket. He wanted to play and I said sure. He and I played in the </B>
<P><B>barn. He showed me a hole in the floor of the barn. He said, </B>
<P><B>see that hole? My Dad was bringing in a bull and the bull crashed </B>
<P><B>through the floor. I forget everything else except that my Aunt was
</B>
<P><B>very worried about me and called me into the house.</B>
<P><B>I found out later that the house was very, very </B>
<P><B>haunted. From the time they moved in. The house had old-fashioned </B>
<P><B>thumb latches that would constantly click and open. My Aunt finally
put </B>
<P><B>moleskin under them so they could sleep. My Uncle was found dead in
the </B>
<P><B>house in 1964. He was buried on his thirtieth birthday. My Aunt put
</B>
<P><B>the house up for sale when he started appearing to her, naked, and
exhausted, like </B>
<P><B>he had come a long, long way. One day my Aunt was outside working when
a man </B>
<P><B>rode up in a bicycle. He knew all about the farm. He said he used to
</B>
<P><B>play with a little boy in the barn.</B>
<P><B>My Aunt still kept property around the </B>
<P><B>farm. My cousin built a home there. My Cousin was in a restaurant </B>
<P><B>one day and there were workmen at the next table talking about the
</B>
<P><B>farmhouse. They said it was haunted and they would never go back into
that </B>
<P><B>house.</B>
<P><B>The old house has had several owners. It is not a happy </B>
<P><B>place. Now the new house has problems. Vapors go in and out of the
</B>
<P><B>window and my cousin's grandchild keeps saying Hi, to an unknown </B>
<P><B>person.</B>
<P><B>I just found out today that a little boy lived in the original </B>
<P><B>farmhouse with his mother, who was a widow and was very ill. The little
</B>
<P><B>boy had a lot of free time and used to play in the barn a lot. He would
</B>
<P><B>sleep on a chest next to his mother. I have never forgotten </B>
<P><B>him.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=from>Visitations from Relatives</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  Jamini350@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>                  These visitations from relatives who have passed
on</B>
<P><B>started back in the year 1974.  My husbands grandmother passed away
before we</B>
<P><B>were married in 1972. When our 1st child was born 1974, I had known
that there</B>
<P><B>was such  things as spirits or ghosts  for a couple of years. One night
our</B>
<P><B>son was woken up by what I thought was a possible Diaper change or
he wanted a</B>
<P><B>nighttime feeding. When I finished giving him a bottle, which he didn't
drink</B>
<P><B>much at all, I put my son down to sleep. As I went to put the bottle
back,I</B>
<P><B>walked in the hall to go towards the kitchen , which was on the left,.
I felt</B>
<P><B>a strong presence in the livingroom , which was on the right side off
the</B>
<P><B>hallway. I felt as if eyes were upon me and they were watching my every
move.</B>
<P><B>It was  weird. The only thing that came into my mind at that moment
was I felt</B>
<P><B>the personality of  my husbands grandmother. I wanted to stay in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen,Because I was a little fearful of the encounter, but I knew
I must go</B>
<P><B>back to bed. This happened about 2a.m.As I left the Kitchen to go back
to</B>
<P><B>bed,I  felt she was still in the livingroom. I just went back to my
bedroom.</B>
<P><B>The next morning I told my husband ,who is aware of the spirit world
, what</B>
<P><B>happened.. My husband called his mother to ask when did Grandma die
.She told</B>
<P><B>us what day.The day Grandma made her presence known was the day of
 her</B>
<P><B>anniversary when she died.</B>
<P><B>                  A few years later  my husbands grandmother ( his
fathers</B>
<P><B>mother) passed away. A year passed and again I was woken up to my
toddlers</B>
<P><B>crys and I went to see what was the matter. After I attended to my
son, again</B>
<P><B>I was going back to my bedroom and as I approached the hallway , I
felt a very</B>
<P><B>strong presence in the livingroom. This time I felt the presence
advance</B>
<P><B>towards the hallway where I was. I was frightened. At that moment the
only</B>
<P><B>thing that came to my mind was my husbands other grandmother. I felt
her</B>
<P><B>personality. She was a very strong headed woman not like his other
grandmother</B>
<P><B>, who was more gentle in spirit. I again told my husband what I
experienced</B>
<P><B>and he again asked his mother what day did his fathers mother die and
that day</B>
<P><B>was the 1st anniversary of his grandmothers death.</B>
<P><B>                          My husbands Uncle  died  back in the 1980s.
A month</B>
<P><B>after his death,  my husband was awoken by someone shaking him .</B>
<P><B>My husband said that when he opened his eyes, he saw his uncle looking
very</B>
<P><B>much alive and healthy.  My husband wasn't frightened to see him but</B>
<P><B>acknowledged his uncle by name and was about to sit up when his uncle
extended</B>
<P><B>his hand out as if to say don't bother getting out of bed.  He then
told my</B>
<P><B>husband in a gentle reassuring voice " Tell your mother I'm all right".
He</B>
<P><B>then faded right before my husbands eyes!</B>
<P><B>Excitedly, my husband jumped out of bed to light up a cigarette.  Stirring
me</B>
<P><B>from my sleep.  I asked him what the matter was, he told me "I'll tell
you</B>
<P><B>tomorrow".</B>
<P><B>                         Since then, some Aunts and Uncles on my side
have</B>
<P><B>died but we never got a visitation from them. The visitations seem
to happen</B>
<P><B>on my husbands side of the family.  </B>
<P><B>                         There are  other paranormal activity that
has</B>
<P><B>happened in our family,but I will save those for another day. </B>

<P>
<P><B>         Here is a story that my mother told me after my father died.
 I</B>
<P><B>personally did not witness this but believe me, my mother would never
lie</B>
<P><B>about this.  It really isn't that big of a story but I thought you
might be</B>
<P><B>interested.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     About two weeks after my father commited suicide, my mom was asleep
on</B>
<P><B>the couch in our living room.  The living room faced a long hallway
in our</B>
<P><B>house and she was sleeping with her head in that direction.  She told
me she</B>
<P><B>awoke suddenely by a gust of wind and when she looked up, she saw a
figure</B>
<P><B>floating down the hall towards her holding a candle.  She could not
make out a</B>
<P><B>face but she did notice the figure had on brown work boots.  Right
there she</B>
<P><B>knew it was my dad because all he ever wore were brown work boots.
 She said</B>
<P><B>she was not scared as the figure floated right by her into the kitchen
as</B>
<P><B>vanished.  A couple of days later she spoke with a priest concerning
what had</B>
<P><B>happened.  The priest had told my mother that the candle the figure
was</B>
<P><B>holding was a sign of hope.</B>

for all of</B>

<P>
<P><B>my story my seem small to many people but it meant alot to me when
it</B>
<P><B>happened.</B>
<P><B>My story begins when I was 11 going on 12. Raised in a tight family
with love.</B>
<P><B>My mother had me when she was 19 and my father never claimed me as
his own, so</B>
<P><B>the only man in my life was my grandpa.  Surrounded only by girls meaning
me</B>
<P><B>my mom, grandma and aunt, he raised me up as a tomboy bigtime.  We
had a very</B>
<P><B>close bond me and him, there was never a time when I wasn't with him
I think.</B>
<P><B>Anyway's my grandpa had not been feeling well for many months, the
doctors</B>
<P><B>told it was work and old age and didn't really run any tests even though
he</B>
<P><B>was fully insured by medical coverage.  I was at my moms when we got
a call</B>
<P><B>that my grandpa collapsed and fell down and wouldn't wake up. They
rushed him to</B>
<P><B>the emergency room and that's when they finally decided to take some
tests to</B>
<P><B>find out that he had lung cancer.  The doctors gave him 2 weeks to
3 months to</B>
<P><B>live since his blood was already in his spinal cord, which is very
bad.  He</B>
<P><B>was in terrible condition and I was devistated.  Two days later I stayed
at my</B>
<P><B>friends house, she was trying to comfort me and cheer me up some but
how can you</B>
<P><B>cheer some one up when you know that a loved one is going to die and
soon.  That</B>
<P><B>night I cried my self to sleep.  Then early that morning I awoke hearing
my</B>
<P><B>grandpas voice saying Alexis I will always love you and be there for
you and</B>
<P><B>that was it.  I knew he was dead at that very second, I looked at my
friends</B>
<P><B>alarm clock to see what time it was it was around 1:10 in the morning.
 The</B>
<P><B>room was ice cold and I started crying uncontrolably knowing that the
only man</B>
<P><B>I knew as a father was gone. My friend woke up wondering what was wrong
but</B>
<P><B>through my sobs she couldn't understand me.  The phone rang about 5
minuetes</B>
<P><B>later. It was my mother calling saying that they were on their way
to pick me</B>
<P><B>up, to go to the hospital.  It was weird when my friends mom came in
to tell</B>
<P><B>me who it was I told her he was dead before she even said a word, and
when she</B>
<P><B>asked me how I knew, I told her he was just here.  After my mom and
them</B>
<P><B>picked me up we got to see my grandfather for the last time.  He looked
very</B>
<P><B>peaceful.  I later asked the doctor at what time my grandpa had passed
away</B>
<P><B>his answer is what shocked me but confirmed to my self that I wasn't
mad ( in</B>
<P><B>the head), he told me some time between 1:05 and 1:15 am.  I now know
that my</B>
<P><B>grandpa came to say his last good bye to me at 1:10am waking up hearing
his</B>
<P><B>voice for the last time.  There have been two times that he has shown
himself</B>
<P><B>to me. Once in a dream, that was to real, I mean I could smell him
when I</B>
<P><B>awoke even, and the second was when he saved me by pulling me back
on to the</B>
<P><B>curb before getting hit by a car.  I know he keeps his promise I still
feel</B>
<P><B>his presence every once and awhile, and he lets me know he is near.</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I lived in one house for 22 years, and experienced several
unexplainable</B>
<P><B>happenings. One particularly memorableevent occured while I was
resting</B>
<P><B> on the couch. I could sense something was entering the kitchen, and
</B>
<P><B>moving into the family room. My eyes were closed, and there was no
sound,</B>
<P><B> but I was aware it was moving toward me.</B>
<P><B>It actually sat on the arm of the couch, grasped both my hands and
squeezed them </B>
<P><B>firmly, then gave me a comforting pat on the head, and then left the
</B>
<P><B>room. I jumped up from the couch and called out, then searched the
house, </B>
<P><B>but found nothing. I recently moved to another house, and one night
a valance </B>
<P><B>fell from above the sliding door in my bedroom, for no apparent
reason.</B>
<P><B> The next morning I heard water running, and discovered the washer
was turned </B>
<P><B>on, and there was water running into it! I had not even been in the
utility room</B>
<P><B> since the previous day.</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My husband died about two years ago.  We both loved animals very much.
 At one</B>
<P><B>time he said to me "Ann, when we get to heaven we are going to be met
by a</B>
<P><B>zoo!"  In February of this year (1999) I went into the bedroom to turn
down</B>
<P><B>the bed.  To my surprise there was a cluster of sparkling lights above
my</B>
<P><B>pillow.  I wasn't frightened but was curious  about this.  I looked
carefully</B>
<P><B>all around the room  but didn't see the lights anywhere else.  I looked
again</B>
<P><B>at my pillow and the lights were still there,  As I continued watching
the</B>
<P><B>lights gathered closer together and formed the image of a cat.  This
half</B>
<P><B>formed cat jumped off of my pillow and jumped down off of the bed.
 It</B>
<P><B>completely disappeared before it reached the floor.  I looked around
for it</B>
<P><B>but couldn't see it anywhere.   We have had several  small animals
over the</B>
<P><B>years  so I couldn't tell which one this was but I got the idea that
it was</B>
<P><B>friendly.</B>
<P><B>This house is only about 50 years old but has quite a history.  The
land was</B>
<P><B>part of a land grant granted by the King of Spain to a Franciscan order
in the</B>
<P><B>1700's and was used as a cattle range until the last century.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  danbao98@netzero.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I am writing this story to share with you people about what I have</B>
<P><B>encountered which is all true. Not a make BELIEVE story. I was around
7</B>
<P><B>years old when I was going swimming in the old river in Quang</B>
<P><B>Ngai,Vietnam. My family were living in a suburban place. It is dark
and</B>
<P><B>scary in Vietnam escpecially when we don't have no lights, one scary</B>
<P><B>things that always scared me was the graveyards. People that died</B>
<P><B>buried their bodies  anywhere, even near rivers or so. Well to
continue</B>
<P><B>my story, it was around 12:00 pm, and the weather was extremely hot.
Me</B>
<P><B>and my two brothers decided to go for a swimming, When we got to the</B>
<P><B>river, my two brothers went off , leaving me alone by myself. Seeing
my</B>
<P><B>two brothers having fun, I started to go forward to them. As I was</B>
<P><B>walking, I felt something really abnormal. It was the sands. The
sands</B>
<P><B>was moving down as I take each steps. After realizing that I was scared
I</B>
<P><B>decided to go back, as I turn my body around, something or a hand I</B>
<P><B>would say grabbed my leg. It started to pull me down. First, I thought
it was</B>
<P><B>just the sands, but then I can feel the fingers and the feeling of
a</B>
<P><B>hands. Then I started to go down. I try to scream but I couldn't.
When</B>
<P><B>my head were almost cover with water, my older brother came to me and</B>
<P><B>all of the sudden the hands let my leg go and I was up again. I was
so</B>
<P><B>lucky that day. My brother saved me. I told him about the incident
but</B>
<P><B>he told me it might be the sands.(Trust me it wasn't I can feel the</B>
<P><B>hand.). This is not the end yet.  Several days after the incidents
a</B>
<P><B>neighbor's daughters went to swim in the same river but in up  North.
One</B>
<P><B>of the sister swim and sometime pull her down. The other sister
couldn't</B>
<P><B>do anything, she decided to grab on to the other one and both of them</B>
<P><B>die. Many of my townspeople said that the water ghost took the two</B>
<P><B>sisters life. In case if you don't know, There are alot of Ghost in</B>
<P><B>Vietnam. The water ghost which is very common, if you have the same</B>
<P><B>birthday as the person that die, they will pull you down and kill
you,</B>
<P><B>they do it to release their soul. I am currently living in America.
I</B>
<P><B>must say I believe in Ghosts.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  Obbagirl@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My husband, Chris, &amp; I had just moved into our first apartment
together.  As I</B>
<P><B>was out working, Chris had noticed that there were two bowls placed
in our</B>
<P><B>cupboard, with a single fork resting at the top.  We were using the
cupboard</B>
<P><B>only to store food, so when I had gotten home, Chris had questioned
whether I</B>
<P><B>had put the bowls there.  Of course, I hadn't.</B>
<P>
<P><B>For the next couple of days after that, Chris and I would wake up with
a start</B>
<P><B>-- literally shot up from our sleep -- at exactly 6:30 every morning.
 What</B>
<P><B>made this even more unusual was that the both of us didn't need to
wake up</B>
<P><B>until 10:00a.m. for work.  But there we were, up from the middle of
our sleep,</B>
<P><B>leaving us to do nothing but look at each other &amp; wonder why.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several days pass, and I started to feel nervous.  I started getting
the idea</B>
<P><B>into my head that there could be a ghost in the house, causing us to
wake up</B>
<P><B>at this ungodly hour.  As Chris and I were about to go to sleep, I
began to</B>
<P><B>hear creaking noises from the kitchen nearby.  I got up, turned on
the kitchen</B>
<P><B>light, and found that the cabinet, the utensil draw, and the cupboard
directly</B>
<P><B>across from the former two were all slightly opened to the same degree.
 I</B>
<P><B>closed all of them, went back to bed, and began to hear the same
creaking</B>
<P><B>noises all over again.  Now totally scared, I found myself getting
up every 15</B>
<P><B>minutes to shut the doors and draw -- which were progressing opening
more and</B>
<P><B>more, faster and faster.  I had to finally ignore it to get a decent
night's</B>
<P><B>sleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One morning, I was awoken by a man's voice, saying,"Who are you?"
 Again,</B>
<P><B>waking up at 6:30, we both shot up to see an old man standing at the
foot of</B>
<P><B>our bed, sternly looking at us, dressed in overalls and a red plaid
shirt.</B>
<P><B>Although I could see him in color, the window behind him shined the
morning</B>
<P><B>rays right through him.  We stared in shock for about 10 seconds, then
he</B>
<P><B>vanished.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>With that, we didn't see or hear from him again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The little old lady downstairs, our landlady, showed us her family
pictures</B>
<P><B>about a month after the hauntings ended.  Chris and I both agreed that
the man</B>
<P><B>we saw was her husband, who had built the house himself and died about
10</B>
<P><B>years ago.  We've never told our landlady, but we think that her husband
was</B>
<P><B>just making sure that we wouldn't harm his wife.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=dog>My Dog Bandit</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: Factrychk@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello, I was reading your stories and found them very fascinating..I
have a</B>
<P><B>story I would like to share about my dog Bandit. Bandit was a lhasa
apso that</B>
<P><B>me and my family had for about 14years. Bandit had a series of
medical</B>
<P><B>problems, which since he was mainly "my" dog, I got a job to pay his
vet</B>
<P><B>bills. (I was barely in my teens) we all loved that little dog so much.
I have</B>
<P><B>a large family..4 brothers and my parents and myself. Well, towards
the end of</B>
<P><B>his life he became very ill, I was not living at home at the time,
but my mom</B>
<P><B>would always call me when something was wrong with him. On this day,
I was</B>
<P><B>driving out to my moms, I started to cry and became very sad, I think
I had a</B>
<P><B>premonition of what was to come the next few days. Bandit it turned
out had</B>
<P><B>diabetes, and we didn't know it, he was very sick and spent the next
few days</B>
<P><B>in the vet while they tried to stabilize his glucose level...to no
avail, he</B>
<P><B>wouldn't eat, he was very weak, he kept getting fevers..there was no
hope. We</B>
<P><B>had to make the decision to put him to sleep. I must say that was the
single</B>
<P><B>most difficult decision I had ever had to make. I was devasted. My
mom called</B>
<P><B>my brothers at there jobs, and everyone was there at that vet that
day, except</B>
<P><B>my dad,he was working. We spent a little time with him in the room
before they</B>
<P><B>took him back to give him the shot. That dog was smart...I could swear
the</B>
<P><B>little guy knew somthing was up..finally, they took him back and 2
of my</B>
<P><B>brothers went back there with him...they came back out crying and I
knew it</B>
<P><B>was done..I was completely devasted..that was my baby. But strangely
on the</B>
<P><B>way home, I felt a sense of relief, like he wasn't in pain or
suffering</B>
<P><B>anymore. Like any crazy pet owner, I had him privatley cremated at
a cemetary,</B>
<P><B>and to this day his ashes are in my mothers armoirre. But..in the weeks
to</B>
<P><B>come after we put him to sleep, my little brother...(who still lived
at home)</B>
<P><B>could swear he heard bandit at night..sometimes when Bandit would get</B>
<P><B>restless, he would kind of wimper, like he wanted someone to pay attention
to</B>
<P><B>him, that's what my brother would hear..then my brother would call
out his</B>
<P><B>name(which is what he used to do when Bandit was alive) and it would
stop. And</B>
<P><B>my father...big spook skeptic...also heard Bandits claws tapping on
the tile</B>
<P><B>floor in the kitchen...one of his favorite places to sleep. My mom
is always</B>
<P><B>trying to get me to take the ashes with me, now that I have my own
home, but I</B>
<P><B>always tell her no, because that is his home. I don't know about anyone
else,</B>
<P><B>but I firmly believe that if an animal is treated and loved like one
of the</B>
<P><B>family, that they develop a soul, and maybe, just maybe, they are waiting
for</B>
<P><B>us in heaven...My belief is that my 2 grandpas that passed on some
time ago,</B>
<P><B>are taking care of Bandit till I get there...:)</B>

<P><B>I would like to tell you about an experience </B>
<P><B>that happened two summers ago in my ex's aunt's store in downtown Toronto,
Ontario.</B>
<P><B> I was hanging around with my ex and his uncle while they were doing
some work in the </B>
<P><B>store. I was sitting on the stairs while they were working. About </B>
<P><B>two feet away from me and about three feet from my companions, there
was a box </B>
<P><B>of vegetables sitiing flatly on top of another box of equal size and
</B>
<P><B>weight. All of a sudden, the box flipped upside down, like some unseen
</B>
<P><B>force threw it, and vegetables went flying as the box went flying.
It </B>
<P><B>raised goose-bumps on all of our arms. Apparently, there was some other
</B>
<P><B>weird things that went on but no one would reveal to me what it was.

</H3><P><B>By:  phoenix5@zoomnet.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have lived in my house </B>
<P><B>for 10 years now.I moved here when I was four years old.Our house is
101 years </B>
<P><B>old now.It was built in October,1898.My first experience with my great
</B>
<P><B>grandmother was the night we moved in.I was sleeping and I saw the
figure of a </B>
<P><B>beautiful woman dressed in a ball gown that was probably dated in the
1800's.She </B>
<P><B>walked over to my bed and looked at me sternly,what happened after
that I do not </B>
<P><B>know.When I awoke in the morning my clothes were tatterd and torn and
I had </B>
<P><B>scratches and bruises all over me. My mom was terrified to because
the ghost had </B>
<P><B>visited her to.She says that the figure just stared at her for a long
time until </B>
<P><B>my mom became so frightened that she had to turn on the light.I never
saw </B>
<P><B>anything again for seven years.On November 21,1994 my best friend and
her older </B>
<P><B>sister were staying all night with me.We were all sleeping in my room(we
had </B>
<P><B>school in the morning).My room gets cold in the winter because there
is no way </B>
<P><B>of heat up there so I had a little portable plug in heater in my room.At
about 4 </B>
<P><B>a.m. they woke up and saw the knob on my heater turning on it's own
and </B>
<P><B>the shadow of an old woman on my blinds.They tried to wake me but I
was in such </B>
<P><B>of a deep sleep they thought I was comatose.Things have gotten alot
crazier </B>
<P><B>since then.Things came up missing in the house after we had just placed
them </B>
<P><B>there,we here footsteps in the hallways upstairs,door slamming and
flying open </B>
<P><B>by themselves,etc.We've finally become used to all of this.The past
two years </B>
<P><B>have been so chaotic they often frighten me.Last summer my friend Andrea
was </B>
<P><B>standing underneath the chandlier in the living room and one of the
light covers </B>
<P><B>fell right in front of her,if she hadn't have jumped back it would've
landed on </B>
<P><B>her head.I checked the chandlier and the bolts and screws were so tight
they </B>
<P><B>couldn't be moved.Then it stopped for a couple of months. Last Semptember
was </B>
<P><B>the first time I had seen my great grandmother since I was four.I was
asleep in </B>
<P><B>my room when the instumental Clairde Lune came on.My room went completely
black </B>
<P><B>then I saw lights like from a disco ball or something(the little circles
of </B>
<P><B>light all over the floor,ceiling,etc.)and I saw the figure of my great
</B>
<P><B>grandmother and great grandfather dancing to it.When the song was over
they </B>
<P><B>disapeared and my normal lighting returned.Then last December I had
a </B>
<P><B>party,three of my friends were sleeping in the extra room upstairs
while me,my </B>
<P><B>boyfriend and another friend were sleeping in my room.My friends that
were </B>
<P><B>in the extra room talking when the door started swaying back and forth.They
</B>
<P><B>checked the windows which were shut tightly and locked as well as all
other </B>
<P><B>windows upstairs.Then the room went completely pitch black and an elderly
woman </B>
<P><B>appeared and began talking to them.She told them to be very careful
of what they </B>
<P><B>say in the house and to be quiet so they wouldn't awaken him.She also
said that </B>
<P><B>she's been protecting all of us for years from him.Then she disappeared
and </B>
<P><B>everything returned to normal.My most recent experiences were last
night and </B>
<P><B>right now.Last night I was laying awake when the song Living Dead </B>
<P><B>Girl by Rob Zombie came on the TV. All of a sudden the volume went
all the </B>
<P><B>way up,I have no remote to my tv so I couldnt've accidently turned
it up.My TV </B>
<P><B>is on one side of my room and my bed is on the other.When the song
was over the </B>
<P><B>volume returned to where I had it. As I'm typing this everytime I mention
</B>
<P><B>him(whoever he may be)I get a very cold chill and the hair on my neck
and back </B>
<P><B>stands up,my cats tail gets real puffy and his hair stands up on his
back.Then I </B>
<P><B>hear people arguing in the hallway upstairs(I'm home alone) then it's
all over </B>
<P><B>and I feel safe.I just wish I could talk to my great grandmother and
thank her </B>
<P><B>for protecting me,my family,and friends.I'm glad to have her around
even though </B>
<P><B>she's scared me from time to time.</B>

<P>
<P><B>    I have seen ghosts all of my life and live with one now.  I was
told</B>
<P><B>by my grandfather that it is a gift so I just accepted it.  I have
many stories but I will start</B>
<P><B>with the most interesting.</B> <B>   Some years ago a co-worker and
friend asked my to grow and arrange</B>
<P><B>the flowers for her</B> <B>wedding.  She asked my in Feb. so all winter
we talked about it at</B>
<P><B>work.  She has one sister</B> <B>who is handicapped and in a wheel
chair, who was the flower girl.  There</B>
<P><B>were five brides maids.</B> <B>I kept having this dream  of the wedding.
 There was someone at the</B>
<P><B>alter,  then the bride would</B> <B>come down the isle, then the sister
in the wheelchair.  Finally I asked</B>
<P><B>my friend if she had an</B> <B>older sister.  The succession of the
three women made me think there</B>
<P><B>must be someone.  She</B> <B>was shocked when I asked her because indeed
she had an older sister who</B>
<P><B>died when she was</B> <B>three weeks old.  I told my friend of my dream
and told her, her sister</B>
<P><B>is with her in spirit and</B> <B>grieves the fact that she can't truly
be your older sister in the</B>
<P><B>living.  I asked the bride if we</B> <B>could make a bouquet for her
and lay it on the alter.  The morning of</B>
<P><B>the wedding, when</B> <B>I was lugging in big buckets of flowers from
the garden, she came.  She</B>
<P><B>was a small precious</B> <B>sweet soul.  Of course she startled me,
but I clamed down and turned to</B>
<P><B>focus on her.</B> &nbsp;<B>She nodded her head and closed her eyes
as if to say thank you.  What a</B>
<P><B>sweet spirit.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My name is John and I'm 22 years old.  I'm currently living in California
in</B>
<P><B>the home I grew up in.  I'm writing to ask you a few questions that
will</B>
<P><B>hopefully shed a little more light on my "encounters".  I'm a rational
young</B>
<P><B>man, not normally taken to flights of fancy.  I'm an ex Police Officer
and</B>
<P><B>served in the United States Air Force as such.</B>
<P><B>	I came home a few months ago and am living at home until I can reasonably
get</B>
<P><B>myself on my feet financially.  Being an ex cop, I have a few compact
firearms</B>
<P><B>located throughout the house which are normally locked up.  One of
which is</B>
<P><B>located in the bedtable beside my bed.  It's a Sig 226 with a lazersight
and</B>
<P><B>halogen minibulb.  (Not a cheap sidearm).  Anyways, to get down to
my point.</B>
<P><B>I am a light sleeper, as the Military has done to me in the past few
years.</B>
<P><B>	One night, around 0415 I awoke with the feeling that I was being watched.
 I</B>
<P><B>woke up and turned onto my side and looked at the doorway, which was
open.</B>
<P><B>Just outside my doorframe in the darkened hallway was a shadowed
shape.</B>
<P><B>Thinking it an intruder, I watched for a moment, and blinked the sleep
from my</B>
<P><B>eyes and got ready to take a course of action.  As I stirred slightly
to</B>
<P><B>attempt to reach for my gun, the figure moved deeper into the shadows
of the</B>
<P><B>hall and moved down the hallway towards the landing.  I opened the
nighttable</B>
<P><B>and grabbed my gun, and ran to my doorframe and then uncharacteristically
just</B>
<P><B>jumped into the hallway, my finger on the button that enabled my
halogen</B>
<P><B>minibulb and lazersight to activate.</B>
<P><B>	What I saw still scares the bejesus out of me even to talk or think
about.</B>
<P><B>Standing at the top of the stairs was a vaguely female shape.  I could
make</B>
<P><B>out the contours and lines of the female form.  My small light illuminated
the</B>
<P><B>entire hallway like a small sun, my lazersight showing as a hazy dot
against</B>
<P><B>the dark shape.  The thing that mystifies me, is that whatever it was,
cast a</B>
<P><B>shadow of its own on the wall.  I got the distinct impression that
whatever</B>
<P><B>this thing was, it turned around in that instant.  I stood there looking
at it</B>
<P><B>and it stood there looking at me.  I've been in wartime situations
and have</B>
<P><B>seen death in someone's eyes more times than I dare to even want to
count.</B>
<P><B>But whatever this was scared me into being numb!  Whatever this thing
was, it</B>
<P><B>slowly started "walking" towards me and I raised my gun and drew down
on</B>
<P><B>whatever approached me.  It seemed almost to pause for a moment, then
seemed</B>
<P><B>to almost "blur" and rushed at me and then through me and then was
gone, as</B>
<P><B>the only thing behind me was the hallway towel closet.  I dropped my
gun,</B>
<P><B>unable to keep from shaking in pure terror, much as I am now.  I woke
my</B>
<P><B>parents and my father proceeded to grumble at me with some very
colorful</B>
<P><B>explatives about being woken for a "ghost" and walked out to the
hallway,</B>
<P><B>grabbed up my gun and did a walk-thru of the house and found
everything</B>
<P><B>secured and in proper order.</B>
<P><B>	When this thing walked "through" me, I didn't feel the coldness that
I've</B>
<P><B>read about on your page.  I felt warmth, almost like a warm body, then
it was</B>
<P><B>gone.  That's my question.  Am I imagining all this?  Why the warmth?
 Is that</B>
<P><B>unusual?  Even now I'm scared stiff and always close my door and lock
it at</B>
<P><B>night and normally don't sleep until about 3am, as I am terrified of
what</B>
<P><B>could be outside in the hallway.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=with>My Grandfather is with Me</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:   Elvanic1@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I rarley tell anyone this story cause usually they think I am off my
rocker.</B>
<P><B>Being only 13 my ghost experiences are not many but for ones I have
had to me</B>
<P><B>they are freaky.  The whole thing started when my Grandfather died.
 He was</B>
<P><B>only 56 and I felt guilty because I had to leave the hospital.  When
I</B>
<P><B>returned about an hour later he was dead.  I have always carried that
guilt</B>
<P><B>with me and always will.  My parents often leave me alone to go shopping
and I</B>
<P><B>just sit around and watch TV.  One time it was a hot Australian summer
( I am</B>
<P><B>australin) and I thought I would die ( pardon the pun) without any
cool</B>
<P><B>breeze.  I was watching an old Titanic movie when the shutters
started</B>
<P><B>banging.  Now not really banging but swining back and forth and hitting
the</B>
<P><B>window.  Well this scared me to death ( pardon another pun) but I soon
forgot</B>
<P><B>about the incident.  Another time at the same setting it was a corner
of the</B>
<P><B>eye thing that got me.  Just for a brief second I think I saw a tall
figure</B>
<P><B>outlined in black.  Well we eventually moved to America to travel and
see the</B>
<P><B>country.  Well this spirit or ghost or grandfather must have just got
packed</B>
<P><B>away in the baggage because when we moved to Texas it was just the
same.  Its</B>
<P><B>just a feeling.  I mean not just that kind of feeling but a strong
I-am-</B>
<P><B>scared-as-heck feeling.  This continued throught to phoenix where I
saw</B>
<P><B>shadows a couple of times.  We know live in Connecticut and grandad
is making</B>
<P><B>himself known.  Our house detects any move.  I mean you move a muscle
it</B>
<P><B>creaks. Well it seems when I alone the creaks are just always happening.
 In</B>
<P><B>the dead ( I keep punning) of the night it still creaks.  Its not my
parents</B>
<P><B>or my brother.  My brother sleeps above me and is only 5.  My parents
are</B>
<P><B>across the hall and I can always hear them geeting out or into bed.
My dad has</B>
<P><B>had some experiences.  While in our current house he was collecting
firewood</B>
<P><B>and felt a squeeze on his shoulder.  He has also seen a little boy
with lumps</B>
<P><B>on his head when he was a kid. My mother has seen a ghost.  They are
both</B>
<P><B>nurses and know what they see.  Now the thing is I always feel guilty
when I</B>
<P><B>see or feel the presence.  I think it might be grandad telling me not
to feel</B>
<P><B>guilty or something.  But its everywhere.  Its like grandad just follows
me.</B>
<P><B>I have the feeling 24/7.  I will try and get my parents to e-mail you
with</B>
<P><B>their stories.  Thanks for reading</B>

</H3><P><B>By  : Angeldawnn@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B> Well, I recently was discussing 'ghost' experiences with my friends
at work</B>
<P><B>and I mentioned a frightening experience that happened to me, my husband,
and</B>
<P><B>my sister in-law.  Talking about what happened 6 years ago got me
curious</B>
<P><B>again and</B>
<P><B>I decided to see if anyone had experienced this same sighting.</B>
<P><B>  It all started 6 years ago when my husband and I went to
Glenburnie,</B>
<P><B>Maryland </B>
<P><B>to visit my sister in-law.  At the time she rented the upstairs space
of an</B>
<P><B>old house.  When you open the front door, the stairs are directly in
front of</B>
<P><B>you.    There is another door leading to the down stairs rooms, however
it has</B>
<P><B>been bolted shut.  Upstairs, she placed a curtain at the top for
added</B>
<P><B>privacy.  There are two rooms, one to each side of you.  Each room
has a walk-</B>
<P><B>in closet, one closet has been transformed into a kitchen, with a small
sink,</B>
<P><B>refrigerator, and microwave.  Directly across the stairs is a bathroom.
 The</B>
<P><B>room to the left she has converted into a T.V/living room.  </B>
<P><B>  The night we arrived we sat around talking about childhood memories.
   I</B>
<P><B>noticed as we were talking, I would hear the toilet flush for no reason.
 She</B>
<P><B>made a comment about how the toilet liked to mess with her.  She said
it</B>
<P><B>flushed sporadically, mostly when she had guests over.   My husband
had</B>
<P><B>jokingly  made a comment about how it must be haunted, and the ghost
didn't like to share her</B>
<P><B>with anyone.   The next night the three of us had gone out to a local
club and had came</B>
<P><B>back slightly intoxicated.  We were being somewhat loud, not to where
we were</B>
<P><B>disturbing, just laughing and having fun.  The toilet was silent the
whole</B>
<P><B>night, as if it was mad at us.  The next day we were out sight seeing
and got in late.</B>
<P><B>My husband was tired so he went to bed and my sister and I stayed up
to girl-</B>
<P><B>talk.  When we finally went to bed, it was just after 1:00am.  That
night changed my</B>
<P><B>outlook on everything supernatural, however I didn't realize it until
several</B>
<P><B>days after.</B>
<P><B>  Me and my husband slept in the waterbed in one of the bedrooms and
my sister</B>
<P><B>slept on a cushion/mattress on the floor in the living room.  At 2:00am
I was</B>
<P><B>awakened by sudden harsh movement of the waterbed.  It felt as if someone
was</B>
<P><B>pounding on it.  I looked around and nobody was there.  My husband
was sound</B>
<P><B>asleep.  I layed back down and no more than 10 minutes later I felt
another</B>
<P><B>hard movement.  This time I sat straight up, my husband also felt the
movement</B>
<P><B>and he sat up.  We were blaming each other, telling the other to knock
it off.  I had</B>
<P><B>a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach.  About 40 minutes later
the</B>
<P><B>movement came again, this time harder.  At the time I was just starting
to</B>
<P><B>fall asleep again.  </B>
<P><B>I got mad and yelled to the air to quit moving the damn bed.  I don't
really</B>
<P><B>know who I was talking to, but it felt good to yell.  I then fell
completely asleep</B>
<P><B>along with my husband.  Let me just mention that it was the 4th of
July</B>
<P><B>weekend and the humidity was awful.  I was sleeping in just a light
T-shirt and we were</B>
<P><B>not using any blankets.  Around 4:00am my I was awakened to my
husband</B>
<P><B>throwing the blankets atop of us, he kept saying "don't move, he is
here" over</B>
<P><B>and over again.  My husband, however was still asleep.  I thought he
was</B>
<P><B>dreaming.  Then I felt another hard pound on the bed and I screamed.
 I knew</B>
<P><B>someone was standing at the bottom of the bed, I felt him.  My scream
woke my</B>
<P><B>husband up completely and he threw back the covers.  I was expecting
to see a mass murderer standing</B>
<P><B>there, however the room was empty.   He went over and turned on the
lights.  We both looked pale as if we saw a</B>
<P><B>ghost.  I asked him why he threw the covers over me and he told me
he had a</B>
<P><B>strange dream.  He said in his dream he had gotten out of bed and looked
out</B>
<P><B>the window down to the front porch of the house next door.  There was
an older</B>
<P><B>man dressed in a colonial outfit sitting in a rocking chair, smoking
a handmade pipe.  He</B>
<P><B>looked up at my husband and waved.  My husband then turned around to
face the</B>
<P><B>bed where I was laying.  The man was now standing over the bed staring
at me.</B>
<P><B>My husband said in his dream he yelled at the man and he ran over to
cover me</B>
<P><B>up.    </B>
<P><B>In reality, my husband never got out of bed.  I was fully awake after
my</B>
<P><B>husband had thrown the blankets over me and we were both completely
still when</B>
<P><B>the violent pounding happened.  I wanted nothing more than to get out
of the</B>
<P><B>house.  </B>
<P><B>  There was no way were we going to fall asleep again, so we turned
on all the</B>
<P><B>lights and went into the room where his sister was sleeping to wake
her up.</B>
<P><B>We told her what happened and she said she had a strange, scary dream
also</B>
<P><B>that night.  She said she was laying down on her stomach and she
heard</B>
<P><B>something behind her.</B>
<P><B>She tried to get up to see what it was, but she couldn't move.  She
said it</B>
<P><B>was as</B> <B>if something was on top of her.  I had this feeling as
if something was there</B>
<P><B>still.  I can't explain the feeling, but my hair on the back of my
neck was</B>
<P><B>up.  My husband went downstairs to go outside a little while after
we woke up his sister, it</B>
<P><B>was now about 6:00am.  He found the front door wide open, as if someone
ran</B>
<P><B>out of the house in a hurry and forgot to shut it.  We were trying
to rationalize</B>
<P><B>what had happened and we couldn't.  Everything was just not in order.</B>
<P><B>Everything I have said so far doesn't really account to much, just
some young people scaring</B>
<P><B>themselves with pretend ghosts, right.</B>
<P><B>  Well, we left the next day, thank goodness.  The night we got back
to</B>
<P><B>California, where we are from, I called his sister to let her know
we had made</B>
<P><B>it.  She said she was going to a friend's house to spend the night
because her toilet was</B>
<P><B>flushing    every 10 minutes and she was scared.  We both made a joke
of it, but deep down</B>
<P><B>inside we knew something was wrong.  That same night we were watching
TV, </B>
<P><B>trying to unwind from the long trip.  I turned it to Sightings, the
TV show,</B>
<P><B>which I</B> <B>might add I never watch.  For some reason I felt I needed
to see this show.</B>
<P><B>The</B> <B>show aired a strange, horrifying story.  It was about the
ghost of Glenburnie</B>
<P><B>Maryland, Colonel Daniels.  He apparently was the local townskeeper
back in</B>
<P><B>the day.  He would sit on his porch and smoke his pipe and watch the
town.</B>
<P><B>There</B> <B>were several sightings where he would come check on all
the new people in the</B>
<P><B>town.  I was never so scared as I was at that moment.  </B>
<P><B>  I am writing to you to not only share my experience, but to also
ask you if</B>
<P><B>you have any information about this particular haunting of the town
of</B>
<P><B>Glenburnie, Maryland.  Thank you for letting me share my story.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=friend>My Friend's Haunted House</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  aphrodite_luv@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>	Hello. I have visited you site many times and thought I should share
my </B>
<P><B>story with your readers also. Just so you know I am 21 and I live in
a </B>
<P><B>small city in Michigan. My friend's parent's house is haunted. I've
</B>
<P><B>known her since we were 10 yrs old but have only been going to her
house </B>
<P><B>since I was 16.</B>
<P><B>	Right off the bat I should tell you that the house was built sometime
</B>
<P><B>during the 1860's. Everyone that goes there knows that you either feel
</B>
<P><B>right at home there and are really comfortable or you can't stand to
sit </B>
<P><B>in the house at all. I have always been comfortable there. I even lived
</B>
<P><B>there for almost a year. Anyways back to what I was saying.....there
</B>
<P><B>were many couples and families that moved in before they did. everyone
</B>
<P><B>of them moved out in a hurry. One couple was there for 2 nights and
then </B>
<P><B>left. Her family has been there for quite a few years now. My friend
has </B>
<P><B>2 older sisters her mom and her dad.</B>
<P><B>	Two times since they moved in the ghosts (we know there is a man,
</B>
<P><B>woman, and a little girl ) kept pestering her dad while he was trying
to </B>
<P><B>go to sleep to let him know that the house was going to catch on fire.
</B>
<P><B>	Another time years ago, the middle sister was home alone watching
TV </B>
<P><B>when she heard my friend calling her from upstairs. She went to the
</B>
<P><B>bottom of the stairs to see what she wanted but before she climbed
the </B>
<P><B>first step she remembered that she was alone and that my friend was
</B>
<P><B>still at school.</B>
<P><B>	A few of our friends have also seen strange things happen. Once another
</B>
<P><B>friend of mine and I were watching TV waiting for our friend to come
</B>
<P><B>home. (The couch faces the big window in their livingroom) We saw a
</B>
<P><B>little girl skip across the porch in front of the window heading for
the </B>
<P><B>door. My friend and I thought it was our friend's neice so she went
and </B>
<P><B>opened the door for her, but no one was there.</B>
<P><B>	Just recently though her mom was in the kitchen and she looked out
the </B>
<P><B>window to see what the guys were up to. They were looking under the
hood </B>
<P><B>of my friend's boyfriend's truck. When her dad came in her mom asked
who </B>
<P><B>was out there with him and he said Steve* and his brother. She said
no </B>
<P><B>there was another man standing right next to you. None of them had
seen </B>
<P><B>the male ghost out there but her mom. </B>
<P><B>	One time my friend was sick and she was laying in bed it was about
1 or </B>
<P><B>2am. Her door was open a bit and she saw a woman whom she thought was
</B>
<P><B>her mom looking in on her. She called for her mom but the woman just
</B>
<P><B>left. She asked her mom the next day and her mom said she never got
up </B>
<P><B>last night.</B>
<P><B>	Her mom had slept in one Saturday morning and she heard what she </B>
<P><B>thought was one of her grandaughter's come in her bedroom. She had
her </B>
<P><B>eyes closed and felt someone kiss her forehead. She opened her eyes
to </B>
<P><B>say goodmorning and there was no one in the room. The girls weren't
even </B>
<P><B>over.  </B>
<P><B>	Another time her mom was sitting on the floor in the livingroom playing
</B>
<P><B>solitare and my friend was sleeping on the couch. Out of nowhere she
saw </B>
<P><B>footprints in the carpet walking around her and the cards. They have
</B>
<P><B>really plush carpet.</B>
<P><B>	Also in the old houses they had parlor rooms for funerals. It's now
</B>
<P><B>their den but I have noticed that no matter what it is always cold
in </B>
<P><B>there, and I always feel like someone is watching me when I'm in there.
</B>
<P><B>	There are many more things that have happened in that house, but I
</B>
<P><B>don't want to use up all of your space. I'm just glad that they are
nice </B>
<P><B>ghosts and not violent. I will swear on a stack of bibles that </B>
<P><B>everything I described is true to my knowledge, and my own experiances
</B>
<P><B>that this story IS real. Thanks for reading.  </B>

<P>
<P><B>    Hi my name is Kal and I wanted to share an experience I had in
the</B>
<P><B>Philippines when I</B> <B>went on vacation there with my mother. We
were staying at my aunts house</B>
<P><B>and were all sleeping in the same room because it was summer there
and</B>
<P><B>the house only had one air conditioner. Anyway to make a long story</B>
<P><B>short one night my mom,me,aunt,and two cousins</B>
<P><B>were sleeping in that room when I heard my mom calling my name. She
was</B>
<P><B>telling me to</B> <B>wake up. So as I started to wake up I heard the
drawers on dresser</B>
<P><B>opening and closing.</B>
<P><B>The lamp was also turning on and off there was also a horrible smell
in</B>
<P><B>the room it smelt</B> <B>like rotten eggs. I was kind of scared but
not to bad because other</B>
<P><B>things like this had happened before to me and my friends but we
never</B>
<P><B>really paid that much attention to them</B> <B>before because when
they happened </B>
<P><B>we were usually drunk or really tired</B> <B>and it only occured three
or four times before.</B>
<P><B>   Anyway back to my beginning story. When my aunt said "He knows
your</B>
<P><B>here the rucuss</B> <B>stopped. You see my mom and aunt believe that
the "ghost" was my grandpa</B>
<P><B>coming to see  me because I left the Philippines when I was only two</B>
<P><B>years old and now I am twenty-five.</B> <B>I was also my grandpa's
favorite grandson.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  hutson@cyberhighway.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story is one that my grandmother told me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 15 years ago my Grandmother's friend Kioko was married in the
back</B>
<P><B>yard of her (my Grandmother's) house.  After they were married they
decided</B>
<P><B>to go for a little trip to Yellow Stone National Park.  They told my</B>
<P><B>Grandma that they would return in about 2 weeks and they would call
and</B>
<P><B>tell her how they were doing every once in a while  they left an
emergency</B>
<P><B># just incase.</B>
<P><B>	About the third night that they were gone, Grandma was in her bed
and she</B>
<P><B>was trying to sleep but had a terrible time getting comfortable.  She
had a</B>
<P><B>terrible feeling that something was wrong.  She couldn't quite
pinpoint</B>
<P><B>what was wrong so she decided to try and call the number that Kioko
gave</B>
<P><B>her in case she needed something.  As she was getting out of bed she
heard</B>
<P><B>something.  She knew that she was probably hearing things so she
didn't</B>
<P><B>think anything of it.  She walked down the hall and then all of a
sudden</B>
<P><B>she saw "Kioko" walking down the hall.  Grandma reached out to grab
her and</B>
<P><B>Kioko dissapeared.  </B>
<P><B>	Later, when she finally gathered her senses and walked into the
kitchen</B>
<P><B>and called the number.  Kioko picked up the phone on the other line
and</B>
<P><B>When Grandma heard her voice, she knew that she was okay.  </B>

<H3><B><A NAME="ghost cats">Ghost Cats?</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  goats@ohiohills.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>     I have always believed in the supernatural because the </B>
<P><B>house I grew up in, and which my parents still own, is haunted. It
is an </B>
<P><B>old farmhouse from 1828. We would hear people walking up the stairs,
and </B>
<P><B>people talking in other rooms, but you couldn't make out what they
were </B>
<P><B>saying. My grandfather on my father's side of the family wouldn't even
</B>
<P><B>stay in the house at night; he was scared of the voices.</B>
<P><B> In the past ten years or so, </B>
<P><B>the walking and voices have stopped. I'm not sure if it is because
I used </B>
<P><B>to try to talk to the ghosts when I was a child and reassure them that
we </B>
<P><B>weren't there to harm them, but they no longer seem very active. I've
</B>
<P><B>heard recently that sometimes they respond like that if you try to
talk to them, </B>
<P><B>but that was just what I did when I was a child and afraid of them.
The </B>
<P><B>most recent ghostly activity there was when my father's glasses went
missing for </B>
<P><B>about a week. All of us looked for them, but they were nowhere to be
</B>
<P><B>found. Then, one day, they were back again, lying in their case on
the </B>
<P><B>table just inside the back door! We also have a large library of books,
</B>
<P><B>and often books will go missing also.</B>
<P><B> Another strange thing in our </B>
<P><B>house is the ghost cat. I'm not really sure which of our deceased cats
it </B>
<P><B>is, or if it's even one of our own. I never experienced it firsthand,
but </B>
<P><B>one night my husband (then boyfriend) was sleeping in the spare room
and the </B>
<P><B>cats' food bowls were on the ground by the bed, right below where his
head </B>
<P><B>was. He was awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of a cat
</B>
<P><B>eating hard cat food, and he looked down to see which one it was. There
</B>
<P><B>were no cats in the room, but he could still hear the noise of a cat
eating out </B>
<P><B>of the bowl.</B>
<P><B> The next morning, my husband told us about the incident. My father
got a strange look on his face, and </B>
<P><B>then he said, Well, that's funny because... and he told us about </B>
<P><B>feeling a little cat jump on his bed and curl up by him almost every
night, but </B>
<P><B>when he would look for it, there was nothing there. We also noticed
that </B>
<P><B>the two cats who live in the house often seem like they are watching
something </B>
<P><B>or someone moving across the room, but whatever it is is invisible
to </B>
<P><B>us. One final interesting incident, although I'm not positive that
you could call it a ghostly </B>
<P><B>incident, also involved a deceased cat. The background is that my father
</B>
<P><B>had found a little black cat who had stumbled across the busy highway
in front </B>
<P><B>of his car one morning. He quickly pulled onto the side of the highway
and </B>
<P><B>rescued the cat, which he took home with him that afternoon. The cat
was </B>
<P><B>so happy that all it wanted to do was lie in the grass in the warm
sun and </B>
<P><B>purr. Unfortunately, despite my parents' efforts to save it, it was
too </B>
<P><B>sick and weak to ever recover. They told me about this incident a day
or </B>
<P><B>two after the cat had died, and I was upset because I like black cats
the best </B>
<P><B>and I had never gotten to meet it.</B>
<P><B>A few months later, I was on the highway, driving to Cincinnati to
see my parents. I wasn't thinking </B>
<P><B>about much of anything, and certainly not about cats. Suddenly, I got
a </B>
<P><B>most vivid image of the little black cat in my mind, although I had
never seen </B>
<P><B>it. I could see it lying in my parents' yard in the sun, as they had
told </B>
<P><B>me it loved to do, and it was like a wave of sadness sweeping over
me when I saw </B>
<P><B>it. When I glanced over then at the side of the highway, I thought
I saw a </B>
<P><B>tiny little kitten face peering between some weeds at the edge of the
</B>
<P><B>shoulder. Although I often stop to help stray cats and dogs, I do not
</B>
<P><B>think I would have stopped for this one, thinking it was just my mind
playing </B>
<P><B>tricks on me, if I hadn't just had the vision of the little black cat
who had </B>
<P><B>died. The kitten I thought I saw on the side of the highway looked
so </B>
<P><B>small that I wasn't even sure I really had seen it, especially since
I </B>
<P><B>was going at least 65 mph! When I pulled my truck over </B>
<P><B>and backed up along the highway shoulder, I couldn't see anything at
all, since </B>
<P><B>the weeds were high. But when I got out of the truck and walked back
along </B>
<P><B>the highway, I spotted a small black and white kitten with long hair.
It </B>
<P><B>was so scared and starved that at first it didn't even notice I was
there; it </B>
<P><B>just was lying down with it's nose touching the ground. When I called
to </B>
<P><B>it, though, it finally looked up, and then it started running towards
me, crying </B>
<P><B>as loudly as it could. It was so small that I could hold it in one
hand, </B>
<P><B>and I never would have seen it without the intervention of the black
</B>
<P><B>cat. I took it into the truck and gave it to my parents, who nursed
it </B>
<P><B>back to health and still have it to this day.I think that the haunting
in </B>
<P><B>our house when I was a child was fairly normal and not at all sinister,
from </B>
<P><B>what I've heard of other accounts. I'm actually glad that I grew up
in a </B>
<P><B>haunted house, because that experience gave me a lot of faith in the
reality of </B>
<P><B>the spiritual world. It's also nice to have had experiences with ghost
</B>
<P><B>cats, since I am deeply committed to helping stray animals, and I think
that if </B>
<P><B>there can be animal ghosts, then that offers some proof that they have
souls </B>
<P><B>too. I've just found your web site (I've just gotten hooked up to the
internet for the first time!), and I really </B>
<P><B>enjoyed reading the true stories and thought I'd send you mine if you
want to </B>
<P><B>use it. Thanks for having such a lot of information about the </B>
<P><B>supernatural!</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  m-vasconcellos2@email.mc.ti.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My mother told me this story.  It happened to her years ago (1940's)
 when</B>
<P><B>she lived in the coal mining region of West Virginia, and was then
married</B>
<P><B>to her first husband.  If my own mother didn't tell me this first-hand,
I'm</B>
<P><B>not sure if I'd believe it, but my mother isn't one to spin yarns.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She had walked down the street (approx 1/4 mile) to her mother's house
for</B>
<P><B>supper.  When she left Granny's house, it was dark.  On the other side
of</B>
<P><B>the street, between Granny's house and Mom's house there was a
mountain</B>
<P><B>which had a dirt trail leading up to a house.  A light caught her eye,
so</B>
<P><B>she watched it figuring someone was walking up the trail carrying a
lantern.</B>
<P><B>But when the light rose up into the trees, and then up above the trees,
she</B>
<P><B>thought it was rather strange, but really didn't think too much about
it.</B>
<P><B>When she got to her house, she called for her girlfriend (she lived
in the</B>
<P><B>apartment upstairs from Mom) to come out to see it.  All of a sudden
her</B>
<P><B>friend started uncontrollably crying and saying that there was going
to be</B>
<P><B>an accident in the mines.  Both her husband and my mother's worked
the night</B>
<P><B>shift in the coal mines.  That every time that light was seen an
accident</B>
<P><B>happened. Legend had it that an old coal miner used to live up on
that</B>
<P><B>mountain, and that he had died in an explosion in the mines.  Since
then,</B>
<P><B>his ghost comes back to warn the men when there's going to be another</B>
<P><B>explosion.  And sure enough, whenever that light was seen, there was
an</B>
<P><B>explosion indeed.  </B>
<P><B>My mom tried to calm her friend down, and they all went in for the
night.</B>
<P><B>At about 2:00 am Mom was awoken by a knock at the door.  It was some
men</B>
<P><B>from the mine who came to tell her that there was an explosion in the
mine,</B>
<P><B>and that her husband had been hurt (he lost two fingers in the
explosion).</B>
<P><B>From that night on, Mom said she would never look up that mountain
trail</B>
<P><B>again.  She didn't want to see the lantern light.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=arc>The Architect's House</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By:  diana@crslaw.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>In the early 1980's I lived in Bloomington, Illinois.  I did not then</B>
<P><B>drive a car, and would take the bus to work and back every day.  Each</B>
<P><B>day to and from work the bus passed by a beautiful old house with
lovely</B>
<P><B>stained glass windows.  Whenever I passed by that house I thought to</B>
<P><B>myself that it looked haunted.  There was no reason for me to think
so.</B>
<P><B>I never saw anything unusual while passing by.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day at the office, a co-worker named Sue, was telling a story of</B>
<P><B>some strange experiences she had been having.  Sue was living with
her</B>
<P><B>boyfriend who was then out of town.  She and her boyfriend hadn't
been</B>
<P><B>getting along, and while he was gone she was considering leaving him.</B>
<P><B>Sue was living in the very house I thought to be haunted.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Up until that time, Sue had never experienced anything unusual while</B>
<P><B>living in the house, but as soon as she started thinking about
leaving,</B>
<P><B>she began hearing loud booming noises as if someone was pounding on
the</B>
<P><B>walls and doors.  Also, while walking up or down the stairs, she
would</B>
<P><B>feel someone grab her ankle and try to trip her.  She thought maybe
her</B>
<P><B>boyfriend hadn't really left town and was trying to scare her.  She</B>
<P><B>called where her boyfriend was supposed to be and he was indeed
there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Sue did a little research on the house and found out it was the last</B>
<P><B>house built by a local architect.  Also, the architect had lived in
this</B>
<P><B>house before his death some decades before.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Sue eventually broke up with her boyfriend, moved out of the house
and</B>
<P><B>after a time, left the state.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Two years later I was drinking beer in a local bar when I overheard</B>
<P><B>another friend of mine, Frank, telling some people about some strange</B>
<P><B>experiences he was having at the house he lived in.  He had just
decided</B>
<P><B>the day before that he couldn't afford the rent where he was living
and</B>
<P><B>would have to move out.  That night while he was laying in bed he
heard</B>
<P><B>a very loud booming noise is if someone was pounding on the door
outside</B>
<P><B>of his bedroom, but when the noise stopped and he went out to</B>
<P><B>investigate, no one was there.  It was the very same house!  As far
as I</B>
<P><B>could tell, Frank and Sue did not know each other.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was very intrigued by Frank's story.  I had never seen or heard a</B>
<P><B>ghost and thought I could handle the experience if I was not alone.
 I</B>
<P><B>asked Frank if I could spend the night with him in the house.  He</B>
<P><B>consented.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had never been in the house before.  It was as beautiful inside as
it</B>
<P><B>was outside.  I particularly remember a circular stained glass window
in</B>
<P><B>the west wall of the living room; a picture of some birds and plants.</B>
<P><B>Apparently, the ghost of the house only started acting up when the</B>
<P><B>current resident began to think about leaving.  Perhaps because I</B>
<P><B>admired the house so much  nothing happened while I was there, </B>
<P><B>but I believe Sue's and Frank's stories.</B>
