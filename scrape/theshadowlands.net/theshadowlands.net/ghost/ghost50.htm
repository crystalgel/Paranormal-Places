<H3><A NAME=my>My History</A>
</H3><P><B>by MSadie1@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Long before I knew it, my sister found out that one side of my family
had a history of being psychics, yet she did not know which side.  She knew
it was passed down to a few in each generation.  She was one, and she did
not know the other.  Later, we found out, it was me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was a baby, my mother would have to stay up until about 3 am,
each night, trying to get me to sleep.  I would cry and later (when I was
older) point at the walls and things behind her.  It freaked her out, and
she wondered if I was autistic (slightly autisitic children tend to laugh
and cry at things that aren't there.).  She got me tested somehow, and found
out that i wasn't.  As I got older, I would have nightmares more and more.
 At least, that's what my mother thought.  I would never tell anyone, but
I would see people gathering around me and looking down at me.  And each
night, as i would be inbetween sleep and being awake, I would see these people

more and more clearly.  At the age of 5, I started having dreams where people

would tell me things about stuff that was happening.  Four days before my

birthday on August 28th, 1992, my grandfather was admitted to the hospital
on a very serious coronary congestion.  That night, I had a dream where my

grandfather came to me while I was sitting in his entryway in his house,
and sat down and talked with me (something he had NEVER done, my grandfather
was quite abnormal and strange).  He ended the conversation by say "Julie
(not quite my real name, sorry :P), I'm going away for a very very long time,
and you can't come with me.  But know that I'll be happier there, and I'll
always watch over you and your grandmother and your family.  Always know
that I love you all, and please watch over your family for me.  Especially
your new cousin.  Please know that I'm always with you, especially when you
need me."  He then kissed me on the forehead, and walked out the door to
the garage.  I woke up then, crying, but strange, i felt happy, not sad.
 Almost as if in a habit, i looked at the clock.  I remember it being around
2:45 am.  And I thought, I don't have a new cousin, and I don't even have
one on the way.  The next day, my parents and my aunt and uncle sat down
me, my brother, my sister, and my two cousins, and told us that my grandfather

had died in the night.  Around 2 am, my grandfather had a heart-attack. 
I wasn't scared, I finally realized what my dreams and visions were.  A gift
from God.  Since my grandfather died, he visits me at least once a week and
talks to me about what's going on.  He also can be seen late at night, strolling

through my dining room.  It's almost a casual thing at my house.  I'll look
back and say "Oh, Grandpa's visiting again"  and it's almost a comfort that
he's still around us.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Once, my mother called us into the entry way in our house where we
have a large curio-cabinet, and she was all scared because things had been
moved.  The only way to open them is with a key that is in my father's nightstand

drawer.  None of us are allowed in my parent's bedroom, and besides, why
would we want to mess with a bunch of Royal Daulton figurines, etc, anway?
 But things had been moved from shelf to shelf and a few things had been
moved to another cabinet in the living room.  We all swore that we hadn't
touched it, and we all remembered that our house had been deemed "haunted"
by my sister's extremely psychic friend Rachel.  We'd all basically known,

because our previous house had been haunted.  By then we thought it was some

silly trick pulled on us by my house's spirits.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But nowadays, my grandfather gives me messages to tell my family. 
Since, my other grandfather has passed away, as have my aunt.  And when I'm
going through a really rough time, I go up to my room to take a nap, and
halfway to sleep, they'll appear.  And they each have a certain place on
my bed that they sit by.  My grandfather that died recently sits at the end
of my bed rubbing my legs.  My grandfather that died when i was younger sits
by my head, stroking my hair and whispering in my ear.  My aunt though, stands
by the door staring longingly at me.  She had never known really known me,
but always told my father before she got sick with Multiple Sclorosis, that
she loved to look at me because I looked so much like HER kids. And she always

felt bad that she never knew me.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>One last thing, the psychic stuff is passed down to each generation,
and my cousin Jared has been the first to show signs of it.  He'll tell his

grandmother (my aunt) that his "angel" say something for her to do.  Or if
she's lost something, he'll say that his "angel" told him where it was. 
And she'll find it exactly where he said.  He can tell you anything about
how they look by looking back over his right shoulder.  He's always been
a strange child, and did the same thing I did when i was younger.  We've
also started to believe that my aunt who had died from MS, knew from the
time i was born that i had this gift, because she too had it.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=life>Ghosts in My Life</A>
</H3><P><B>by pern1@InfoAve.Net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Am I strange or is the rest of the world?  All my life I have seen,

felt</B>
<P><B>or "known" there are ghosts about me.  I first had the experiences
as a</B>
<P><B>small child of seeing firey lights of different colors flit about</B>
<P><B>whereever I was.  They were "my friends"  Always there to comfort and</B>
<P><B>aid me.  Music coming from no where that no one else seemed able to</B>
<P><B>hear. I learned early that "we" know these are true happenings but

"we"</B>
<P><B>don't talk about them.  The first real ghostly experience I was

involved</B>
<P><B>with occured when I was around 6 years old.  We lived in a 30 year

old</B>
<P><B>house in Florida.  It was two storied and the bedrooms were all</B>
<P><B>upstairs.  My dad was a postman and very quiet person.  I arrived

home</B>
<P><B>from 1st grade.  My mom was out and my grandmother was living in our</B>
<P><B>garage apartment.  I decided to go over and see her as soon as I

changed</B>
<P><B>clothes.  While I was upstairs, I heard steps on the front porch. 
I was</B>
<P><B>young enough not to be conscious of time, real world.  I thought it

was</B>
<P><B>my dad home from work.  I ran to the head of the stairs and called

down</B>
<P><B>"Daddy" just as I heard the front screen door slam.  However, my Dad</B>
<P><B>didn't answer me.  I started down the started down the staircase</B>
<P><B>following the footsteps.  As I reached the bottom step I heard my

mom's</B>
<P><B>buffet drawers being opened and closed.  Again, I called out with no</B>
<P><B>answer.  Just as I reached the dining room, I heard the faucets

running</B>
<P><B>from the kitchen and called out for the third time.  Still no answer!

 I</B>
<P><B>ran into the kitchen just in time to see the back door swing shut.
 I</B>
<P><B>looked over at the sink and the taps were running full force.  I was

so</B>
<P><B>short that I had to get my stepstool and drag it over to the sink,

climb</B>
<P><B>up and only then could I turn them off.  I proceeded to go out the

back</B>
<P><B>door, still thinking I was following my dad around.  He had a</B>
<P><B>woodworking shop in our garage and spent lots of time there.  So, I

went</B>
<P><B>to the door there but it was still padlocked.  All I could think at

the</B>
<P><B>time, was "Daddy must have gone up to the apartment to see

Grandmother".</B>
<P><B>So, I climbed the outer stairs to the garage apartment and knocked
on</B>
<P><B>her door.  No answer!  I knocked twice more and frustrated finally</B>
<P><B>called out "Grandmother!"  She came to the door and said "Oh it is</B>
<P><B>really someone, come on in Bitty."  My dad wasn't there.  It wasn't</B>
<P><B>until years later that the family was sitting around the dining table</B>
<P><B>and Grandmother spoke about all the time someone would knock on her

door</B>
<P><B>at the apartment but when she answered no one was there.  It was then

I</B>
<P><B>finally realized at 12 that I hadn't followed a manifest person that

day</B>
<P><B>but whoever else was "living" in our house.  I started young I guess

but</B>
<P><B>life is full of surprises I've found both visible and invisible.</B>

<H3><A NAME=story>Jonesboro Ghost Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by l.schroeder@gte.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is my first time writing and I am very excited to have found you.
I have always had a great interest in "real" ghost stories, the kind told
by those who have experienced something they cannot explain.  I had some
unusual experiences in a house I lived in with my husband and 3 year old
son two years ago.  We were transferred to Jonesboro, Arkansas and were having

trouble finding a home, all the homes were older and run down or new and
very expensive.  My husband called me very excited and said he found a house
the he had to have.  I could not make the trip to Jonesboro, so I agreed
that based his judgment we would put a contract on the house.  A few weeks
before we moved I was finally able to have a look at the house.  From the
outside I loved it , but the minute I walked into the house I had a terrible

sinking feeling in my stomach, like when you are very dissapointed with

something. The house was beautiful and very large, it was 20 years old, but

looked new.  I had no reason to dislike the house, but I still had a terrible

feeling when I was in the house.  The current owners loved the house and
didn't want to leave it, so I thought that it must be ok.  The first experience
I began to have was while waiting for the movers to arrive with our furniture,
me and my son were completely alone in the house.  We were sitting in the
living room watching the rain when I suddenly heard the toilet down the hall

flush.  Needless to say this was very frightening and at that moment I knew
I was right about my "feeling" that there was something in this house.  I
felt very nervous all the time like I expected to see something at any moment.
 I always saw shadows out of the corner of my eye.  These were dark shadows
and they moved, I kept trying  catch them, but they were always just out
of range and would dissapear when I looked directly at them.  I also heard

things. This always occurred when I was very busy or distracted by something,

then I would hear someone say something, but I couldn't tell what was said,
it was just the sound of a voice.  Once when my young son woke up sick in
the middle of the night and me and my husband were running water in his bathtub

to clean him up, I heard someone yell something downstairs.  I heard the
voice over the loud running water.  I ran out into the hallway to look down
into the foyer from upstairs, I just knew there had to be someone there,
it was so loud, but there was no one and my husband didn't hear it . I said

"Didn't you hear that?, someone just yelled up the stairs!" He thought I
was imagining things until one night when I had been out and returned to
find him and my son huddled together  in the den looking scared. I asked
what was wrong and my husband said "Trey (my son), just told me something
that scared me to death" the hair on his arms was still raised. Trey was
in the dining room, that we converted into his playroom, which was right
across the hall from the den where my husband was watching television.

&nbsp;Suddenly Trey ran into the den and jumped up on the couch, telling
my husband that there was a lady in his playroom.  My husband thought he
was playing , but realized quickly that Trey was very much afraid and began
to question him.  Trey told him, that a lady with dark curly hair was standing
in the corner of his playroom by the windows.  He said that she told him
that she loved him and then told him to "close his eyes". This is when he
came and got my husband.  He pointed out the spot where he saw her but there
was nothing there.  This scared my husband because he could tell that Trey
was very sincere in what he was telling him and believed that he actually
did see something.  Later Trey told me of seeing the same lady in the basement

when he was playing there and that she would "hide" when I came into the
room. It has been two years since this happened and my son still remembers
being afraid of the woman.  Two more things occurred that make believe someone

was with me when I was in that house.  Once I was alone in the living room

reading and the latch on the door of a stereo cabinet flipped up as if someone

hit it with their finger!.  I was on the other side of the room and there
was no one else home.  The only  incident that my husband witnessed was late
one night when all three of us were watching TV in the living room. My son
was asleep and my husband and I were on separate love seats that were placed
in a U shape around the room with a large coffee table in the middle.  On
the coffee table was a flower arrangement in a basket.  Suddenly while were

dozing almost asleep one of the vines in the flower arrangement lifted itself
up and then bounced back into place... as if someone picked it up and then
let go! My husband jumped up and said "what the hell was that?"  I was never

comfortable in that house and was relieved when were transferred after living

there only two years. I tried to research the history of the home but came
up with nothing except the name of the former owners, who loved the house.
 I just don't understand what happened there and feel that I may have experienced

a truly haunted home. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to tell about
this. It's hard to tell someone who doesn't believe in hauntings.</B><HR>

<P>
<P><B>Well, my story is actually my husbands but he's not here so I will
tell you.</B>
<P><B>My parents had left for St. Louis for a vacation and my husband and
I were supposed to come by twice a day to feed the dogs.  My husband came
out while I was working and he was looking for my dad's dog Pennie and called
for her outside.  While he was calling for her he heard this little boys
voice callout for Pennie to.  At first he thought it was the little neighbor
kids down the road.  So he continued to go inside the house and look for
her.  He opened the hallway door to the upstairs and called and at the foot
of the stairs he heard this little voice again.  He told me he was very calm
and not afraid.  Well he couldn't find Pennie and was worried about her.
 He looked for awhile longer and decided to wait for me later.  As he was
going out the door there was this big bang on the door and a voice said "
where you going?"  Well my husband was very freaked out by then and and started

to leave when he looked back into the garage he saw a figure sitting in one
of the lawn chairs.  So he hotfooted it back home.  He told me the story
when I got home and I was a little freaked by it to because about 25 years
ago my dad's step-sister had a little 3 or 4 year old boy and he was killed
by a little trailer that can be pulled by a tractor, he was playing under
it and pulling on it when he was underneath.  By the way this is a very old

family house and two other people have died here. Natural causes of course.
 But we all thought it was a little strange.  Nothing has ever happened like
that before.  Believe it or not but I certainly do.  Also my dad took Pennie
with them.</B>

<P><B>My parents had enlisted the help of my carpenter uncle to renovate

the</B>

<P><B>house.  On three seperate occasions, my father had put his power

drill</B>
<P><B>down on the floor next to him, turned away, turned back to pick it

up,</B>
<P><B>but found it gone.  He finally found it again in wierd places like

the</B>
<P><B>driveway, or in the backyard.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Stuff like that continued to happen, and the last occurence happened</B>
<P><B>just before we finished the renovations, when my uncle was finishing

up</B>
<P><B>the skylight.  He was on the ladder and felt something push him off,</B>

<P>
<P><B>Noone ever believed me when  I told them this story .Well here it

goes</B>
<P><B>My family finally had enough money to rent a house it wasn't  too old

maybe</B>
<P><B>thirty  or thirtyfive  years  old it was two floors a basement and</B>
<P><B>the main floor . We had three bedrooms , living room , and dining room
, and</B>
<P><B>of course the kitchen.  Well my father had died two months after we
moved in</B>
<P><B>I don't think he was the cause of the situations but I do know a old

woman</B>
<P><B>died in the house . Well let me start I went to a basketball game with

my</B>
<P><B>mother and stepfather and decided to come home early so I'm walking
up my</B>
<P><B>drive way and see all the lights are on in the house when I know we

shut</B>
<P><B>them off my mom hates wasting energy, anyway I see a black figure

jumping</B>
<P><B>around the living room I thought it was my brother and his friend

just</B>
<P><B>playing around in the house. So I walked slowly to the window and tapped

on</B>
<P><B>it ever so lightly maybe to give them a little scare but  I was the

who</B>
<P><B>would be scared well I tapped and the black figure turned and looked
at me</B>
<P><B>and there was no face just black he or it ran down the hallway I'm

still</B>
<P><B>thinking that it might be my brother so I ring the doorbell but I get

no</B>
<P><B>answer so I go to the back door and it's locked so I get my key go

inside</B>
<P><B>and the house was quiet and completely empty . I think back and now

I'm</B>
<P><B>scared. My parents come home I think maybe it was maybe a burgelar
or</B>
<P><B>something and I told my mom about it and she told me that she saw the

same</B>
<P><B>thing coming from work one day . That was one incident. Our basement

you</B>
<P><B>like if you stood down there too long you were going to get hurt or</B>
<P><B>something . My bedroom was filled with bad spirits or just really sad
ones .</B>

touching</B>
<P><B>me or standing right next to me I didn't see anything until about a

month</B>
<P><B>before we moved out I was deep asleep and had this feeling to wake

<P><B>he told me that a couple of nights before he had the same feeling to
wake up</B>
<P><B>and there was a old man standing over his bed I remember him coming
into my</B>
<P><B>room to sleep that night .  We lived there for six years and nothing

<P>
<P><B>I was dating a guy when I was 14, about 5 years ago.  His house had

been</B>
<P><B>built over an old well.  The story goes that in the early 1900's two</B>
<P><B>children were playing near this well, and the little girl fell in and

her</B>
<P><B>brother tried to help, but fell in too.  Their parents didn't know

they</B>
<P><B>were missing for a while, but by the time they got there, it was too

late.</B>
<P><B>Well, they moved, and a nother house was built over it.  My boyfrinds</B>
<P><B>closet was built over this well.  One night it was raining really hard,

and</B>
<P><B>he was playing his guitar.  A bolt of lightning struck right outside

his</B>
<P><B>window and lit up the whole room.  About 10 seconds after that happened,

we</B>
<P><B>heard children laughing.  I looked in the corner of his room,and saw

two</B>
<P><B>children standing there staring at us.  I just sat there and stared

back.</B>
<P><B>They stood there for about 45 seconds, and then vanished.  After that,

he</B>
<P><B>would find things missplaced, and then find them later.  He came home

on</B>
<P><B>several occasions to find his room messed up.  He would pick it up,

leave,</B>
<P><B>come back, and it would be messed up again.  We broke up soon after

that,</B>
<P><B>and I have never heard about the children again.</B>

<P>
<P><B>          I have had numerous experiences with supernatural entitys.
But one that sticks out in my mind happened to my brother and I about 2 years

ago. &nbsp;          I have a cleaning service and clean many buildings at
night, but the case in point occured at a clinic in an older district of
south Ft. Worth.One night my brother and I where finishing up at this clinic.
I have a habit of walking through a building before we lock up to be sure

everything is secure and the lights are off. &nbsp;           My brother
was in the lobby area of the clinic preparing to leave when I informed him
I was going to check the building. There are 4 hallways in this clinic with
many examining rooms, so I proceeded to walk the building. About halfway
through my walk thru I heard another pair of steps about 10 foot or so behind
me. &nbsp;I assumed it was my brother coming to help me, so I started talking
to him. At the last stop of my walkthru there is a breakroom, I reached in
to turn off the light of the breakroom and turned around facing back towarrds
the direction from which I had just come, expecting my brother. What I turned
to was not my brother but the upper torsol of a male figure, somewhat

seethru,misty white. I blurted out a few choice words and the figure was

gone.</B>
<P><B>            After this experience my brother as well as heard many
strange things as well as the figure of a female. I was talking to one of
the doctors one day in the receptionist area when I noticed a picture on
the wall, instantly I reconized one of the people in the picture with the
figure I had seen. A cold chill came over my body at this point. I pointed
out the picture to the doctor and asked who this person was. The doctor stated
he was the doctor who founded the clinic in 1929 and had died in 1985. I
thought to myself, I knew doctors worked alot of overtime but this was going
to an extreme.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I was 12 years old, and this incident occured a  few days after my</B>
<P><B>grandmother died.  I shared a large bedroom with my two sisters; They</B>
<P><B>slept on one end in their beds, and I slept on the other end, since
I</B>
<P><B>was the oldest.  The only door to the hallway was at their end of the</B>
<P><B>room, on my left as I slept.  I awoke suddenly one night, perhaps</B>
<P><B>sensing something, and looked toward that door.  A white figure

glided</B>
<P><B>in, and headed for my bed; I was not afraid, only curious.  The

figure</B>
<P><B>looked like the pictures I had seen of the Virgin Mary, and was very</B>
<P><B>bright.  I heard my sister Joan call out, and then she hid under her</B>
<P><B>covers.  The form (ghost?) came over to my bed on my right, and

lightly</B>
<P><B>took my arm; I heard her "speak" to me, but it was in my head, I did

not</B>
<P><B>hear it with my ears.  She said "come with me."  I was afraid then,

and</B>
<P><B>jerked my arm away.  She looked at me, and I felt a great sadness

coming</B>
<P><B>from her, like she had wanted to show me something.  She then turned

and</B>
<P><B>glided through the wall to outside.  The next morning, my sister got

up</B>
<P><B>and looked at me, and we both knew that we had seen something

special.</B>
<P><B>This is not the end of the story; later in life, I went to a retreat

to</B>
<P><B>try and recover from my divorce; There I met two people who had had

the</B>
<P><B>same experience as I, at the same age!  We later became very good</B>
<P><B>friends, and there was a special bond between us</B>
<P><B>     If there is anyone out there who has had the same or similar</B>

<P>
<P><B>I just returned from a two-week vacation in Cape May, NJ.  The house
which my family (grandparents, two aunts, two uncles, my brother, my sister
and my mother) rented was located on Sewell Street.  When I arrived on Sunday

night my grandmother was getting ready to go to bed.  We sat on the bed in
the bedroom which my mother, my sister, my aunt and I would occupy.  My

grandmother went to bed and my uncle awoke to use the bathroom.  We too sat
and talked for a while.  Everyone else was in bed.  After I was through talking

to my uncle, I went downstairs to the living room to read my book before
going to bed.  While I was sitting there I heard noises coming from the kitchen

which sounded like someone was walking around in the kitchen.  I got up from
my chair and checked and there was no one there.  Again, I sat down to read
my book and heard the noises again.  I then decided to go sit and read in
the kitchen thinking that maybe the noises would stop.  While I was in the

kitchen I heard similar noises coming from the living room.  This time it
sounded like someone was running up and down the stairs and in the hallway.
 Ever time I went in to check the stairs as well as the hallway there was
nothing there.  I was driving myself crazy so I decided to go to sleep. </B>
<P><B>		When I woke up the next morning, I did not mention any of the strange

occurrences to anyone because they might think I was crazy.  I went about
my day enjoying the beach, etc. that day and later that same night I was
sitting up talking to my aunt after everyone else had gone off to sleep.
 We were sitting in the kitchen and I heard the noises coming from the steps
and hallway again.  I did not say anything to her because I wanted her to
bring it to my attention.  Finally, she said did  you hear that and I said
did I hear what and she told me she heard someone going up and down the steps
and in the hallway.  I went to check and again no one was there.  It went
on for hours and neither of us could think straight so we went to go sit
in the living room.  When we did the sounds kept coming from the kitchen.
 My sister then arrived from Philadelphia and when we heard her car out front
I told my aunt not to say anything to her and see if she notices the noises.
 My sister came in and we all began talking and my sister said who is in
the kitchen.  My aunt and I responded no one and continued talking.  My sister

kept saying come on, who is in the kitchen.  We said no one and then we all

starting talking about it and I told them what had happened the night before.

 </B>
<P><B>		We all continued our vacation and did not mention the incident to
anyone so as not to scare my grandparents because they are in their 80s.
</B>
<P><B>		Several nights later my brother came to me and said "have you heard

anything strange in here?"  I responded "yes."  He told me about the sounds
he had been hearing and I told him what I heard as well as what I heard while

talking to my aunt and sister that night.  He said the sounds woke him out
of a sound sleep.  I might add he is a very sound sleeper and is usually
not awoken by ANYTHING.  </B>
<P><B>		Several nights later I was in bed and I was not in one of those not
so sound sleeps where you know you are dreaming but you are not really asleep
and I was just kind of laying there thinking about the dreams I was having.
 When I opened my eyes I first looked at the time and it was 4:30 a.m. and
I saw a man with dark hair, a tan colored tam on his head, a plaid shirt
with a white undershirt underneath  -- he had a pipe in his mouth and he
was very heavy but yet he was standing in a position that humans would not
be able stand in -- although he was there and I saw him and he was clothed
he was not really standing on the floor and it was like if I went to touch
him my hand would have gone right through him.  Naturally I was alarmed so
I thought maybe I was just seeing this because I was in the dark, in a strange

house and there were some clothes hanging on the closet door where I saw
him so I turned on the light and he was still there.  I kept turning the
light off and on to wake my mother.  She usually wakes up for every little
noise or disturbance but not this time.  I kept looking at him and he had
his index finger and middle finger together rubbing his chin while he was
looking at me rather puzzled I guess because he was wondering why I kept
turning the light off and on.  Who knows?   I just turned the other way and
said a prayer that I would fall asleep.  I did.  </B>
<P><B>		The next morning when I came down my brother and uncle were there
in the dining room playing cards.  I was trying desperately to tell them
what happened when my brother said "hold on, I have to tell you what happened

last night."  I couldn't wait so I told him what happened and he said "you're
not going to believe this."  I thought he was joking around at first and
then he told me that around 4:30 a.m. last night he heard someone knocking
on the dining room window (which was not on street level) so he got up to
look and when he did he heard the back door slam really hard.  He went to
check the back door and it was locked.  While he was standing there puzzled
he heard glass break out front.  He ran out there and checked  the windows
and none were broken.  He went out on the front porch and saw the candle
which we were using earlier in the night to do tarot card readings broken
on the porch.  </B>
<P><B>		My brother and I told the whole family about these occurrences and
they were either amazed or thought we were crazy.  </B>
<P><B>		Two nights later my uncle was in bed and heard strange noises coming
from my grandparents room.  He went in to check on them and they were both
sound asleep.  </B>
<P><B>		This is a very strange occurrence and I just wanted to share it with
you because I feel that you are a believer and will not think I am crazy.

<H3><A NAME=man>The Man</A>
</H3><P><B>by kimblumenfeld@classic.msn.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>It started when I was just a little girl. I would see things in my
room at </B>
<P><B>night, movement, shadows and dark forms.  I was told that it was a
dream and </B>
<P><B>that I should not watch scary things on tv.  Now I am 29 years old
and I am </B>
<P><B>not dreaming anymore. The ghosts started to intensify when I was pregnant

with </B>
<P><B>my first child.  I was 21 and still at home.  I would wake up in the
night </B>
<P><B>with a feeling of being watched.  Affraid to open my eyes.  I would
anyway and </B>
<P><B>the same man would be ther looking over me, without an expression and
cold </B>
<P><B>eyes.  I tried sleeping with the light on but this did not stop it.
 I knew it </B>
<P><B>could not be a dream because it was the same image every night.  My
son was </B>
<P><B>born and we moved into our own place, about eight blocks away from
my home. </B>
<P><B>The man did not appeare for a few months but he did eventually show

himself.  </B>
<P><B>Frightened every night as to what I would wake up and see.  My husband

worked </B>
<P><B>out of town during the week so I had my best friend come stay with
me.  I </B>
<P><B>warned her that in the night I sometimes screamed because of what I
see.  </B>
<P><B>Hesitant at first to believe me.  Then the screams came and she to
was a </B>
<P><B>believer.  My friend eventually moved into her own place. What happened

next I </B>
<P><B>can not explain. My friend has never experianced any ghosts or such,
but, one </B>
<P><B>morning while lying in her bed she felt something jump up on it, like
a cat </B>
<P><B>would, the only thing is she did not have a cat, before she knew it
she was </B>
<P><B>frozen as if someone was lying atop her and restricting her movement.
 The </B>
<P><B>incident left as soon as it came but she was aware that this was an
event that </B>
<P><B>she could not get over.  She moved shortly after.  The stranger thing
was that </B>
<P><B>the man I had seen for four years was gone, had he been the one at
her house? </B>
<P><B>Did he move on with her?  I will never know.  I have never seen him
since.  </B>
<P><B>  My husband and I eventually bought our own home and began to move.
 The last </B>
<P><B>night in our apartment I awoke to at least 6-8 apperitions above my
bed. The </B>
<P><B>spooky thing was that I was pregnant with our second child. It was
as if they </B>
<P><B>came to say goodby.</B>
<P><B>  We got settled in our new home, incidentally, is three blocks from
our </B>
<P><B>apartment.  It was about a year before the first incident. We knew
when we </B>
<P><B>moved in that the lady of the house had died here. That is who I expected

to </B>
<P><B>see but quite the contrary.  It was a man in police dress, like you
would see </B>
<P><B>at a funeral or graduation.  His image appeared in the mirror next
to my bed. </B>
<P><B>He is only one of the many ones that I have seen here. Now I only see
an image </B>
<P><B>once  and never again do they appear.  Some months it is every night
and some </B>
<P><B>months none at all.  Just when I think they are gone, I wake up and
scream.  </B>
<P><B>They never touch me or try to talk to me they just stand there and
stare down </B>
<P><B>at me.  The lights can be on or off it does not matter.</B>
<P><B>  I think that my younger son is experiencing the same thing but I
do not know </B>
<P><B>how to ask him without scarring him.  Some nights he sits sraight up
in bed </B>
<P><B>and crys and points with terror on his face.  I look but ther is nothing

</B>
<P><B>there.</B>
<P><B>  All I want is to know if I will ever be able to go to sleep and be

confident </B>
<P><B>that I won't wake up screaming.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you for your time and hopefully someone out ther can relate to

me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=strange>Strange Coincidence</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	neuronaut101@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife and I had moved rented a 60-plus year old house because the
</B>
<P><B>landlord allowed pets.  My wife had misgivings about the house from
the </B>
<P><B>first day we viewed it, but she agreed to move in.  We live there for
6 </B>
<P><B>months, August 1997 through January 1998.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She had a strange feeling about the stair case, as if something bad
had </B>
<P><B>happened, or would happen to one of us.  I couldn't blame her, for
the </B>
<P><B>stair case was dark, with no railing, and carpeted so that it could
be </B>
<P><B>easy for someone to fall down the stairs.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She also swears she heard old-time music playing in our bedroom late
at </B>
<P><B>night.  I never heard it, and I don't believe it was our neighbors.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She also would see "people" out of the corners of her eyes when she
was </B>
<P><B>alone.  This hadn't happened to her before, and hasn't since in our
new </B>
<P><B>house which we have lived in for 9 months.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The strange coincidence is this.  One afternoon I was in the bathroom

</B>
<P><B>taking a shower when I saw movement, about the size of a human, move
</B>
<P><B>across the floor in front of the sink toward the door.  I thought it
was </B>
<P><B>my wife, so I opened the door, but she wasn't around.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About a week later, we were talking about how cold and weird the house

</B>
<P><B>was.  My wife told me, in addition to the music and odd feelings, that

</B>
<P><B>when she was taking a shower, she had seen movement in front of the
sink </B>
<P><B>going toward the door.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I told her that the same thing had happened to me.  I thought that
</B>
<P><B>perhaps reflections off moving cars in the street in front of the house

</B>
<P><B>could explain the movement, but it wasn't sunny when I showered.</B>
<P>
<P><B>At this point I was freaked out.  So, in addition to poor insulation,

</B>
<P><B>bats in the attic and mice in the walls, we had ghosts.  We moved out

</B>
<P><B>within a few months.</B>

<H3><A NAME=lake>Spectre of Spanish Lake</A>
</H3><P><B>by Kavman@trail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Reading some of the stories that your readers have sent you brought
back a memory I thought I had long forgotten and I would like to share it
with you. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view)
it did not occur to me, but, instead happened to a childhood friend of mine.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>     Being an X-Army brat, part of my childhood was spent in a suburb
just east of St. Louis called Spanish Lake. It was called that for a lake
that was near there and a favorite hangout of many of the towns people. A
nice lake, during the day. But at night, it was said that the ghosts of a
sunken Spanish Galleon walked the shores of the lake, especially during the
summer months. In search of what, was unknown. At one time I had been told
 that several people had simply disappeared from there and were never heard
from again. Truth or not I will not venture a guess. The lake was also said
to have a section that was bottomless. And there, supposedly, lay the Spanish
Galleon. Being teenagers, and fearing nothing, several of us used to go there
with our girlfriends (or boyfriends) and "park." But one night, my friend
told me he had learned his lesson and would never, ever go there again.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>     I came out of my house one summers day in 1971 and I saw Randy
up the street absolutely throwing a fit. Yelling, screaming, cursing, and
in general having the preverbal cow. He was standing near his car, a 1966
Plymouth Roadrunner in mint condition. Or at least it almost was, now. Something
you must understand is that this car was Randy's pride and joy. He babied
this car and it was one of the fastest cars in the area at the time as well
as one of the sharpest looking cars. It was painted a metallic Turquoise
and "Built To The Hilt." I asked him what he was so pissed off about, and
he showed me. What I saw scared the bejesus  out of me. It looked as if 
someone or something had run their fingers down the entire length of the
passenger side of his car and completely melted the paint where they had
touched the car.</B>
<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>     He told me that he and his girlfriend, the night before, had gone
to their favorite spot on the lake to "be alone." He told me that they had
been there long enough to fog the windows a little. During a pause (for breath
catching, or something ) one of them looked out the front window. Seeing
what appeared to be a sort of red glow emanating from the lake itself. At
first they tried to ignore it, their attention on each other, but, unfortunately,
they both became rather interested in it. Randy told me that from within
the glow he started to make out what looked like a ball just a little brighter
than the glow itself. At this point Randy told me that it appeared to start
coming toward them. He told me that it looked like it was pulsing or something,
almost as though it were alive. It came slowly toward them and they got really
scared. His girlfriend told him that she wanted to leave....now.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>     Randy told me that he tried to start the car and absolutely nothing
happened. Not one damned thing. It was almost as if all the power had been
sucked from it. Meantime the red glow continued toward them. He said his
girlfriend became near hysterical, wanting to leave but he told her that,
try as he might, there was nothing he could do, and he was not about to get
out of the car to find out either. All they could do was make sure the car
doors were locked and the windows were up as far as they would go..... and
wait.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     He said that after a short time the red glow completely surrounded
them and his car began a slow rocking motion, at first. Then without warning,
Randy told me that the car began to rock more violently and he said he and
his girlfriend could hear a growling, or something of the sort, anyway. Then
he told me that he could hear a scraping sound down the passenger side of
his car. He said the best way he could describe the sound was like someone
scraping their fingernails down a chalkboard. Randy said this went on for
several more minutes, he wasn't sure for how long. And all he and his girlfriend
could do were sit there and hold one another. She, of course, in tears and
Randy very nearly there himself. </B>
<P>
<P><B>     Suddenly, he said, the growling stopped, the scrapping ceased
and the glow was gone. It simply wasn't there anymore. Shaking, he reached
for the ignition switch and tried turning the key. He said the car started
right away and they got he hell out of there. Not looking back once and were
grateful when they were back up on the main road heading into town. By the
time Randy had been able to calm his girlfriend down and get her home it
was very late. So he decided to just go home and try to get some sleep but
not before trying to see what kind of damage had been caused.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>     Randy told me that after he had gotten home he went into the house,
got his flashlight and went back outside. He said that, at the time, he saw
absolutely nothing, and after (very) careful examination too. But the next
morning his brother had wakened him wanting to know what had happened to
his "baby." That's when he discovered what he had.  He tried, several times
after that to fix the problem, but within a few days the fingerprints would
reappear just as if they were fresh. Shortly after that I  left Spanish Lake.
I was told that Randy eventually got rid of his car and I heard nothing more
of it. But to be honest with you I've not been to awfully curious either.

</H3><P><B>by damc@adinet.com.uy </B>
<P>
<P><B>First sorry my english.I'm from South America</B>
<P>
<P><B>This happend in my old and big house (old in the two senses, because
I used</B>
<P><B>to lived there when I was a child and because it is old).When I was
young I</B>
<P><B>always went to bed early , because my mother (who was the one that
went</B>
<P><B>later to bed) said to my father (I heard her a lot of times) that she
heard</B>
<P><B>sounds in the kitchen that is about 10mts from the bedroom and 12
from</B>
<P><B>mine.so I prefere to went early so the other noices didn't let me
hear</B>
<P><B>those spooky sounds (until the day that I going to tell I never heard</B>
<P><B>nothing). One winter night I was alone at my home because my parents
go to</B>
<P><B>dinner outside and my brother , that is bigger than me was outside
also</B>
<P><B>with some friends, it was Friday, and  I was so young to go out, but
to big</B>
<P><B>to be afraid of being alone.</B>
<P><B>I prefer to stayed looking the TV (loud, very loud) , because in my
mind ,</B>
<P><B>the only thing was up and down was that sounds of the kitchen. The
room</B>
<P><B>where the TV was (living room)  was  adjacent to the kitchen.I left
the</B>
<P><B>lights on , all over the house, including the kitchen.</B>
<P><B>At 23:45 I heard a sound from the kitchen I must say that I was
really</B>
<P><B>scared, but I wanted to know what happend , the sound was like a cup</B>
<P><B>dropped from the sink, so I open the door slowly, thinking that
something</B>
<P><B>or someone could jump on me, I had a scissors in my hands, just in
case.</B>
<P><B>When the door was opened enough to see the kitchen  , I looked to the
floor</B>
<P><B>seeking the cup, I didnt find anything , the kitchen has a another
door</B>
<P><B>that lead to stairs that lead to the service room, I decided to go</B>
<P><B>there.That room was the only one that I don't leaved the lights on,
 I was</B>
<P><B>afraid to go there, because i've to pass through the kitchen to do
that ,</B>
<P><B>so I prefered to leave it off.</B>
<P><B>The kitchen is big , a normal person  must walk 15 or 20 steps to
cross</B>
<P><B>along  the kitchen.I was at the sill of the service room door.i could
heard</B>
<P><B> noices but I was afraid to turn on the light because I had to go into
the</B>
<P><B>room to did it.So from one of the drawers of the kitchen I took a
wood</B>
<P><B>spoon (a long one) with that spoon I turned on the light, and ....you
will</B>
<P><B>not belive what I saw in the room.</B>
<P><B>It was a cat!!!. The  window was opened and a very cold wind was
getting</B>
<P><B>into the house, I was almost freezed.I ran  to the window , looked
 the</B>
<P><B>backyard , from this window you can see all the backyard, nobody could
use</B>
<P><B>this window to get into the house because is on a third floor.But I
noted</B>
<P><B>something wrong near the plum tree, a pretty big hold.</B>
<P><B>The cat stayed there looking at me, I like cats, so I gave it milk.The
cat</B>
<P><B>was the one that dropped the cup  to the floor.</B>
<P><B>Then I went back to watch TV and then to sleep.</B>
<P><B>The next morning I told my mother what happened to me last night while
a</B>
<P><B>was alone. </B>
<P><B>When I  finished , she said, near the plum tree.....  yes I said.</B>
<P><B>He wents to her bedrrom and brought with her 3 pictures, and asked
me ,</B>
<P><B>this is the cat you saw?</B>
<P><B>Oh yes , you know this cat,  I said.</B>
<P><B>Yes of course, this was Tilly , my cat , but it died about 20 years
ago,</B>
<P><B>and I buried there... near the plum tree....</B>
<P>
<P><B>While the time passed by, I think that I never seen that cat that was
only</B>
<P><B>my imagination, I was a child , afraid, maybe I saw that pictures
before,</B>
<P><B>but what I'm  really sure is that the pot of milk that I gave Tilly
was</B>
<P><B>empty the next morning...</B>

</H3><P><B>by horvath@comm.mot.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>In the mid 80's my wife and I bought a home in Hanover Park, IL. It
was</B>
<P><B>a neglected house which had a hard time selling and was being rented.</B>
<P><B>The owners lived in a different state and the tenants let the place
go</B>
<P><B>pretty bad. We saw a lot of possibilities and the price was right.
So we</B>
<P><B>moved in and things were, to put it bluntly, bad. The place was
filthy,</B>
<P><B>there were spiders everywhere, the gas wasn't on (in late Oct.) and
it</B>
<P><B>was raining continually. So I'm sitting in the living room area</B>
<P><B>questioning my sanity when I see this "blob" of haze a little larger</B>
<P><B>than a basketball (round in shape) start moving across the living
room</B>
<P><B>about 7 ft away and just sort of floats into the dining room and out
the</B>
<P><B>patio door. It just went through the door and out of the house. I'm</B>
<P><B>like, am I seeing thing's now or was that an apparition. It was wierd</B>
<P><B>because I wasn't scared, it was more like- wow what was that.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We finally got the place in shape and it turned out to be a nice
home.</B>
<P><B>We had our first child just before moving in and it was nice to have
a</B>
<P><B>place of our own. I never mentioned the apparition to my wife, lest
she</B>
<P><B>think I was really losin' it. A few moths later in the spring, other</B>
<P><B>things started happening. My son who was now a full year would wake
up</B>
<P><B>in the night laughing deliriously. My wife thought it was hilarious.
I</B>
<P><B>never mentioned what I had seen to her. She couldn't figure out what
was</B>
<P><B>so funny. I remained tight lipped. This happened on a regular basis
for</B>
<P><B>about a month. Then one day she calls me at work in a panic saying
that</B>
<P><B>Chris, our son, got out of his crib and was sitting on the floor
playing</B>
<P><B>with his toys. Fine, except Chris couldn't walk just yet and
definetely</B>
<P><B>lacked climbing skills. So how did he get out? If he tumbled out he</B>
<P><B>would most likely have been hurt or screaming at the very least. To
this</B>
<P><B>day we don't know and he has no recollection of the event. Other
events</B>
<P><B>included the TV turning on at night, a strange happening of voices
in</B>
<P><B>the night, strong flowery odors, a feeling my wife once described as</B>
<P><B>having been passed through by something, and the car shutting down
in</B>
<P><B>front of the house once we moved out. We sort of visited and when we</B>
<P><B>passed the front of the house the car just shut down. It restarted
with</B>
<P><B>no problem and had no problems before or anytime soon thereafter-
wierd.</B>

</H3><P><B>by kellie72@juno.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> I have had three encounters with ghosts in my house.  The first one
occurred two days </B>
<P><B>before Christmas I was awaken up by sounds of foot steps coming from
the attic </B>
<P><B>knowing that no one &nbsp;could stand up and walk around in our attic.
 Also heard sounds like </B>
<P><B>someone was running their fingers through change.  </B>
<P><B>The second encounter occurred why my mother and stepfather were away.
 I would wake </B>
<P><B>up to sounds of people talking so I would check the rooms to see if
any tvs and radios </B>
<P><B>were on I never found one on.  It sound like two people arguing but
you could never catch </B>
<P><B>would they were saying.</B>
<P><B> The third encounter took place in my bedroom I woke up with the strange
feeling I was </B>
<P><B>beening watched I look over saw a man stand near my bed I sleep on
top of  the bunk </B>
<P><B>bed.  Is face  and hands were glowing white and he wore suspenders
and a large hat. </B>
<P><B>&nbsp;Those are my stories.  </B>

<P><B>When I was 14, I had a slumber party to celebrate my upcoming birthday.
I invited about 5 girls. Well, I had this dog named Shana who always slept
under this Pear Tree we had in our backyard. It produced such GOOD fruit,
we didn't even think about cutting it down. Anywaz, it was time for us girls
to go to bed, so we all went into my room. Shana followed since she slept
on my bed.  </B>
<P><B>Sometime around midnight, I was awaken by my friends snoring. I sat
up and I saw Shana. Only it was a faint image of her. She kept fading and
fading away, and I kept yelled Shana! My friend Ellen woke up and told me
I was screaming, and I told her it was just a dream, so we both went back
to sleep. </B>
<P><B>I woke up early the next morning and went out into the kitchen to find
my mom and dad somberly looking at the floor. I asked what was wrong, and
they told me Shana died. I was heartbroken. Shortly after her death, we moved
to a different neighborhood. But when we went back to get the last of our
stuff, Shana's Pear Tree had died and there, at the foot of the tree, was
Shana's coller and leash..... </B>

<H3><A NAME=farm>Old Farm House</A>
</H3><P><B>by TVail1960@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>The story takes place in Minnesota on an old farm house.  We kids heard
many strange noises in the night at our house and our parents wrote them
off to childish imaginations.  The things we heard were cars driving up to
the front of the house and car doors closing.  We would even hear footsteps
coming up the front porch and the door opening, but when we would look there
would be nobody there.</B>
<P><B>	As time passed we started to hear noised inside the house itself.
 On one occasion I went upstairs to do something that I now forget.  While
there I heard someone come up the stairs.  I looked but found nobody there
and when I returned down to the living room where my siblings were intently
watching t.v., I asked if anyone had just came back down and everyone said
no.  </B>
<P><B>	As mentioned earlier my parents thought it was all childish over active
imaginations.  My mother had a change of heart when while sitting in the
dining room in an empty house she heard what sounded like pebbles being thrown
down the stairs.  Being home alone she had a little change of heart concerning
the "childish imagination" explanation.  </B>
<P><B>	Most of the events that occurred were just noises, but our Poltergeist
had a tricky side also.  </B>
<P><B>	Every day I would set my alarm so that I could get up on time to catch
the bus.   There was a period of a week that I would wake up and my alarm
had been mysteriously turned off.  Having read that if these things happen
you should just sternly tell the ghost that this has to stop.  One evening
I decided to give this a try and I did just that.  I never had any more problems
with the alarm clock after that.</B>
<P><B>	It also seemed that the pranks weren't always on the so subtle side.
One evening I was talking to my sister in her room when the light suddenly
went out.  I reached over and turned it back on and at that moment the door
to her room flew open with a rather loud bang.  This scared us pretty bad,
and we decided to vacate rather quickly.  We later discussed the event and
treed to find a cause such as wind, but the carpet in her room being a thick
shag wouldn't allow this and we triode to replicate it and it took a pretty
hard kick to make the door do the same thing.</B>
<P><B>	There was only one person in the family that had saw anything.  This
was the youngest of our nine kids, and he not only saw the apparition once
but on three occasions.  As I mentioned there were nine kids and we had to
resort to my younger brother and myself sharing a couch bed.  Three consecutive
nights he would wake up and see what appeared to be a women in a flowing
gown enter the living room and then float up through the vent that went into
the bedroom up above.  This shook him up each time and he would run into
our parents room which was next to the living room.  </B>
<P><B>	There were other events that occurred but telling all of them would
take up too much space and I have already written a small novel here.</B>

<H3><A NAME=lost>Lost Love Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by finsinmn@mctcnet.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Back in September of 1982, my boyfriend of 4 years named Keith and
I</B>
<P><B>were visiting his sister Julie,  her husband and family in Oronoco,</B>
<P><B>Minnesota. He was 17 and I was 21.  An odd age range, but he looked</B>
<P><B>every bit my age and was mature, as well.  Sitting up late, we were</B>
<P><B>talking and for some reason, we got on the subject of death.  I asked</B>
<P><B>him if he believed in the afterlife and he said that he did not.  He</B>
<P><B>believed that when it was over, it was over.  But he knew I believed
and</B>
<P><B>I asked that in case there was an afterlife of any sort and that if
we</B>
<P><B>were able, that if one of us should die before the other, that the
one</B>
<P><B>who died would come back and watch over the one left behind.  He</B>
<P><B>agreed.   As time passed, Keith needed his space and I gave it to
him.</B>
<P><B>Reluctantly at times to the point where we would get into heated</B>
<P><B>arguements and I would move out of  his home where we lived together</B>
<P><B>with his father.  In June 1983, on a windy, extremely hot Wednesday</B>
<P><B>night, Keith died in a fire that consumed their trailor house.  I
hadn't</B>
<P><B>been with Keith for about 3 months as our break-ups and make-ups were</B>
<P><B>getting more sporradic.  I recall trying to hitch hike to his place</B>
<P><B>that night 12 miles away but as I stood on the highway for what
seemed</B>
<P><B>like 45 minutes, I just wasn't getting a ride, which was strange
because</B>
<P><B>I hitch hiked that highway regularly and never had a problem getting
a</B>
<P><B>ride within 5 or 10 minutes.  But that night was oddly humid and so
hot</B>
<P><B>that within minutes of leaving my apartment to go to the highway, I
was</B>
<P><B>soaked with sweat like I had just taken a shower and didn't dry off!</B>
<P><B>So, I went back home.  The next day my sister contacted me saying
that</B>
<P><B>Keith had died the night before.  I was devistated!  My whole world
fell</B>
<P><B>to pieces.  I spent the next few days with Keith's dad at  Julie's
house</B>
<P><B>preparing and attending the wake.  At the wake, I was alone in the</B>
<P><B>viewing room with Julie and everyone else was downstairs visiting.
 It</B>
<P><B>was a closed coffin service, but  I had written a letter to Keith and</B>
<P><B>wanted to place it in the coffin.  But due to the extensive damage
to</B>
<P><B>Keith's body in the fire, the funeral home director would not let me
see</B>
<P><B>him, so I decided to put the letter in the small groove between the
top</B>
<P><B>and bottom halves of the coffin.  As I was putting it there, a gust
of</B>
<P><B>wind came out of nowhere!  It seemed to come right from the groove
where</B>
<P><B>I was about to place the letter.  It was so strong and sudden that
I</B>
<P><B>screamed.  People came from downstairs to see what the matter was and
I</B>
<P><B>told them I had seen a mouse.  No one in their right mind would
believe</B>
<P><B>me and besides, maybe it could be explained some way I could not
figure</B>
<P><B>out.  During the wake, I had a 110 camera and took several pictures
of</B>
<P><B>the coffin. I took some of the actual funeral as well but the ones
from</B>
<P><B>the wake came back with some very strange whisps of white something
on</B>
<P><B>the coffin.  These pictures I will have to retrieve from Julie as I
have</B>
<P><B>gotten married 6 years ago and gave my photo album of Keith to her
as a</B>
<P><B>means of trying to let go of the past and move foreward into my new
life</B>
<P><B>with my husband and daughter.  But when I do, if I can't figure out
how</B>
<P><B>to scan them and get them on here, I will send them in.  I believe
I</B>
<P><B>have something here!  Also, in closing, I realized the depth of the</B>
<P><B>promise we made to each other that night just months before Keith
died,</B>
<P><B>and have spoken allowed,( hoping it will release him if he were bound
in</B>
<P><B>any way) that I release him of his promise and set him free, several</B>
<P><B>times in the past few years.  Thank you for listening.</B>

<P>
<P><B>This old building is haunted by a few ghosts (one of whom I've had
the pleasure of actually seeing..well..hearing, actually). One of them is
a German Sheperd Dog who can be seen, waiting patiently for his master to
come and pick him up. Another is an old security guard who can sometimes
be seen in the lunch room. Finally, the former editor of the Californian
&nbsp;can be sometimes (though rarely) seen walking through the hallways
of the building. When I my friend's father brought us on a tour of the place
one night (we soon discovered that our small group was the only living people
there at the time), we heard a rather unusual noise. The former typewriter
room, which is now an expansion of the lunch room, had typing sounds coming
from it. We entered the room, thinking someone was still there, possibly
using an electronic typewriter. But we saw no one, and the typing stopped
as the last one of us entered. My friend's dad shrugged and led us back down
the hall--and the noise started again. We came back, and the noise stopped.
By that time we were pretty darn spooked. We all agreed that we'd leave then
and there, go get some Taco Bell and continue the tour in the morning, when
living emplyees were actually bustling aroun the place. As we left, we heard
the typing continue. This time, though, we didn't bother to investigate.
The next morning, my friend's dad told a co-worker about the experience.
The news soon spead about the building, and everyone beleived that it was
the former editor.</B>
