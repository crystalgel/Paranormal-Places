<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">My husband and I
had an experience a few years ago that I believe is a result of my own
thinking/wishes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Although I have 4
daughters, I once miscarried many years ago and have always wondered about that
child and also what the sex <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">would be. One day
I wasn't in the best of moods and was wanting a sign from that child if
possible<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">to let me know
they're ok and also whether they were a boy or girl. To make a long story
short, I'd thought if<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">it was a girl I'd
like something unusual to happen in one part of the house and if a boy to show
a sign in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">opposite
side...One afternoon a few days later, our front doorbell rang, the front door
was open but the screen closed<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">and no one was
there. Then another evening we were sitting alone out on our front porch and
suddenly the kitchen light came<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">on. We could see
it through the bay window while outside. My husband thought maybe our daughter
had come home but she<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">hadn't, plus we
would have seen her drive up the driveway. Then a large, dark shadow moved from
where the light had been turned<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">on and through the
foyer by the front porch where we were sitting. I leaned over since it seemed
to almost consume me before it<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">disappeared. My
husband stood up and was disturbed, thought maybe someone had broken into the
house, but I just sat there and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">knew that it was
the sign I had asked for....I wasn't frightened. Later on when we were talking
about it my husband said that it looked like<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">or was the outline
of a male figure, that he saw a torso and head and broad shoulders in the
outline.So, that's my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">story. My husband
was a real skeptic about<span style="">&nbsp; </span>things like
this...neither of us are now! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I have experienced
the supernatural first hand. I rented a home and soon found that strange things
began happening. One of the first things that happened was my being awaked
feeling as if someone was shaking my bed. The first few times I thought that it
was my imagination and wrote it off as such. However, I awoke one night to a
baby crying when I checked on my baby he was sound asleep, but I could still
hear faint crying. My husband at the time would often stay up late watching TV,
I would go to bed having a newborn to tend to. I would leave the door to my
room open because of the things that had been happening. My bedroom door would
suddenly begin to ease closed and shut. I told my husband that I hadnt shut the
door, he told me it was probably the house settling. After awhile the door
would slam shut, clearly letting me know that it wasnt the settling of the
house. My sister stayed with me when my husband took a job out of town. I told
her of the times that it felt as though someone were behind me when I walked
down the hall, and of the other things I had mentioned. She laughed and told me
it was only my imagination. She would soon experience for herself that it was
not my imagination. My Son was two at the time and had a habit of getting the
tv remote and changing channels. My sister and I were watching TV and suddenly
the TV turned off. My sister began looking for my son, she thought he had the
remote. He didnt, the remote control was on top of the television. She got up
and turned the tv back on, as soon as she turned her back to walk back and sit
on the couch it turned off again, it did this several times. We knew that it
wasnt the television, it was brand new. She began having the same feeling of
being watched and feeling as if someone were behind her only to turn around and
find no one. She became so afraid that she would stay in the house, I decided
to move out as well fearing what might happen next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I know this one
will be short, but I thought I would share it anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the evening of </span><st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="5"><span style="">May 24, 1989</span></st1:date><span style="">, I was preparing to take a bath (only 8 at
the time) when my mother tells me that my great-uncle had just died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His name was Arthur Martin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arthur's daughter stopped at my grandmother's
across the road to tell the news, and when the news got to my mother, she woke
my dad up to tell him (he was asleep on the couch after coming in from
work).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time she woke him up, he
jumped from the couch screaming that "Arthur's dead! Arthur's
dead!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother simply replied,
"I know."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must have dreamed
it; I don't think it could have been a premonition...since it practically
happened at the same time, as Arthur was being carried to the doctor when he
died, and he only lived two miles from us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">When I was about 3
years old my great grandfather died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was too young to understand what had happened, but my omother said I was
special to him because my parents were the only ones in my family who let my
great grandparents watch me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(my uncles
thought they were "too old.")<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night, a couple of days after he died, I ran into the dining room to
give my great grandpa a hug.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
disappeared before I could touch him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother said I was crying and asked me what was wrong. I told her grandpa left
before I could give him a hug.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few
months after that, I was in my bed trying to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw a shadow of what looked like my
grandfather's stature walk across the hallway wall; which was odd, because
there were no windows in any direction that could've cast a shadow on that
wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another experience was more of a
third party experience, but happened in the same house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house we lived in was on a cul-de-sac and
we were at the very bottom, and our family friend lived at the top. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">My family and I
had gone on vacation (I was about 5 at this time) and we asked our friend to
watch the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>She said she was walking up to the door to get
the mail, and saw an older man in my bedroom window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked who he was when we got back and we
didn't know what she was talking about.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said he was waving to her and looked friendly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a month after this discussion, my
mother, our friend and I were going through photos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We came across a picture of my great
garndparents together at my parent swedding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our friend told us that this was the man in my room that she had
seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point, my great
grandfather had been gone for almost 2 years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I still feel him and my great grandmother (she passed about 7 years
after he<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">did.) whenever I
feel lost or troubled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not scare
me, because I know they are looking out for me and they love me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Matthew.Edmonds@cn.ca<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I've never been a
firm believer in the paranormal, I haven't dismissed the possibility, but it
really is something you need to experience before you can say you 100 precent
"believe" in the spirit world.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, after this incident, I can now say I'm a firm believer, and want
to experience more!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that the
following experience was "pleasant" per se, in fact, I was scared out
of my wits...but it opened a door to a world I want to learn more about!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Here's my
experience!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Last year, I was a
security guard at the CN shops in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Winnipeg</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Manitoba</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shops are where all the
train engines are repaired, wheels are maintained, cars are painted, and is
pretty much a 10 acre garage for trains.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are many buildings at the shops, but the "Stores"
building in particular, was definitely the creepiest place I've been in the
darkest hours of night!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of these
buildings were built between 1905-1909, and as you can imagine, there have been
many stories of deadly accidents over the years!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such as one unfortunate man standing behind a
rail car, who was crushed through the abdomen as another railcar backed into
him and locked the cars in place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
more stories, but I'll try to focus on this one!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Anyways, I worked
the night shift (as you've probably already gathered!), along with one other
guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every hour, the guards on duty
had to switch between working in the North gatehouse, and patrolling the
premesis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of us would have a 2-way
radio for communications, and since the property was so widespread, the radio's
we had were very powerful and efficient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Well, one night,
it was my turn to take a patrol around </span><st1:time minute="45" hour="3"><span style="">3:45am</span></st1:time><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
did my perimiter patrol around the outside of the buildings, then began my
interior patrol.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of these buildings
were operational 24/7, with the exception of the paintshop, and the stores
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The paintshop isn't all that
bad, just a lot of weird noises, but nothing really out of the ordinary for a
building with exposed pipes and old heaters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The stores building on the other hand consisted of 3 floors...the
basement, main level, and upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was closed down about 12 years ago when the floor on the upper South East level
fell through, killing 2 men, and was deemed condemned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Althought this building was condemned, we
still had to patrol the interior, to make sure no one was on the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Most nights I
would just do an exterior patrol, as I always felt uneasy going in there. This
night I had to go in there because my co-worker told me an alarm had gone off,
and I had to turn it off and investigate the problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, armed with my 4 cell mag-lite, and my
nifty 2-way radio, I enter the building, and head for the alarm panel, which is
about 20 feet from the entrance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the
lights are off, so I can only see what's in the circle of light from my
flashlight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I punched in the code to
turn off the alarm, which was triggered from a door on the upper level, and
instantly a cold chill came over me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
radio'd the other guard to tell him where the alarm was triggered, and when he
returned his confirmation, the radio started making very loud squelching
noises, and I couldn't make anything out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This scared the crap out of me, as the radio was freshly charged, and
it's never made that noise before...so I turned it off!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I made my way
upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I go on, I must explain
this building a little further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main
level has only a few offices, and 4 loading docks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the most part, it's an empty warehouse
that used to be used for storing scrap metal, and old engine parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights that still work are few and far
between, most of them flicker, and it really looks like a scene straight out of
Resident Evil!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are 2 elevators on
the southwest wall, that don't work, and are propped open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next to the elevators are the stairs leading
up and down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stairs are made of
steel, with the same grip used on many half tonne trucks for steps, and are rusted,
and very unstable looking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upstairs, all
the windows are boarded up, and the lights don't work at all!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The floor is divided into 2 large rooms, and
the door between them is a small garage door, with a pull cord hanging from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Moving on!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I begin my journey up the stairs, trying to
be light on my feet, but in an empty warehouse, wearing steel toed boots, the
stairs are very loud!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I started feeling
nervous, as I was expecting to see someone up there!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I get upstairs, not even the mag light
could cast light far enough to see the other side of the pitch black
warehouse!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I slowly make my way towards
the garage door that divides the 2 rooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since I can't see very much, everything I hear is of questionable
nature, and really starts freaking me out!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I passed the garage door, and shine the light towards the door that
triggered the alarm....and guess where the door is?!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right beside the floor that had fallen in and
killed those men 12 years ago!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I get
closer to the door, the door slammed shut! <span style="">&nbsp;</span>At this time I was quite shaken, and decided
to get the hell outta dodge!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">So I start walking
back to the garage door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I get
closer, I notice the pull string for the door is swinging back and forth,
getting faster and faster!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cold
breeze rushed past me,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>knowing all the
windows are boarded up, and the ventalation system hasn't worked in years, I
knew I wasn't alone!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Frantically, I ran
for the stairs, and just as I reach the top of the stairwell to go down, my
flashlight abruptly died!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tears are now
rolling down my face from fear as I quickly make my way down the stairs and
head for the exit in complete darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">When I got to the
door, it was locked!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know for fact I
didn't lock the door, because I had a feeling I'd be running out of there
before I even went in!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned the lock
and ran outside!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">After I caught my
breath, I turned the radio back on (as I turned it off after hearing the
squelching noises), and radio'd the other guard on duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked what all the commotion on the radio
was about, and who I was taking to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
told him it was making crazy noises when I entered the stores building, so I
turned it off, and had just turned it back on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said that was really strange, because the whole time he could hear
what sounded like 2 men talking, but couldn't make anything out!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, just to see if he was playing a joke on
me, I asked him to flash his light from the Gatehouse towards the stores
building,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">and sure enough,
he was in the guard house the whole time!!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I made my way<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">back to the gatehouse,
my flash light turned on!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">From there on in,
I never went back into the stores building, and I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">knew for sure that
all this talk of paranormal activity, and the spirit world, wasn't just a myth
blowing in the wind!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">This is a true
story, and beleive me, I've questioned all the possibilities of what caused the
door to slam, the radio making strange noises, the pull cord swinging, my
flashlight burning out, who the other guard heard speaking...and came up with
no explanation, other than the 2 spirits of the men who died were playing
tricks on me!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Thanks for hearing
me out!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Hello my name is
Brandon and i just saw your site because me and my friends are big into getting
really drunk and visiting haunted houses and what not in Arlington Texas and we
have a bunch of places we like to go visit that arnt on your list which im
suprised they arnt ... but even though most of the incounters we have seen we
really did see things and not just because we were totaly drunk.... I was going
to see if you could add </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="">Williams</span></st1:PlaceName><span style=""> </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="">Elementary School</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span style=""> to your list to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Arlington</span></st1:City><span style=""> </span><st1:State><span style="">Texas</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style=""> because it all started out one day after school me and 4 other of my
friends (</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Chad</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, Howard, Travis,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Thomas) were
walking to my friends Travis's house which is located beside Williams and you
have to walk through a thick trail of trees but its pathed with concrete that
leads to the park which is also Williams Playground for the kids. So we were
walking down the path to the park and as were walking we all couldnt but notice
the swing set every time we would get a glance at the swings in between the
thick forest they were moving as if there was someone in them swinging but
there wasnt anyone in the swings..... so we didnt know what was going on so we
finnaly made it to the Park/Playground so we could take a better investigation
and the swings were just sitting there not even moving a bit and there wasnt
anyone in sight.... so we didnt think much of it and we continued walking
towards Williams and when we got to the school we looked back at the swings and
they were swinging again with nobody in them and we just freakin ran like hell
the other way and i looked back and saw 3 to 4 little kids but they didnt look
to be real cause they were really smoogy and i couldnt make out their faces and
they were running in circles in the soccar field which is located inbetween the
school and the playground/park... so we kept running till we got to my friends
house and never looked back..... finnally we had to go back home (Chad , Me,
Howard, and Thomas) we all lived on the other side of the school we desided if
we should take the long way or the fastest way which was through the school so
we went through and we decided if we saw anything wierd to just run like hell .....
so as we were walking back through the school we walked the trail that was next
to the soccar field and everything seemed normal then we got to the concrete
trail and looked back at the park/playground it seemed all wierd then we look
at the soccar field and there was a kid hanging from a rope at the school and
we just fucking ran like hell and we didnt stop till we were all at my friend
(Thomas's) house which is the furthest house from that school and we all got
drunk so that we wouldnt remember much... the next day it was reported in the
news papers that one of the kids that was a geeky type kid that had really no
friends hung himself at Williams Elementary School and we couldnt believe that
we actually saw it... but we were all devistated and just couldnt think if what
we saw was actually real or not but it was real..... now till this day i walk
through there and me and my friends continue to get drunk there to see if we
can see any more sightings but the only thing that happens there now is ever
once a while if your driving towards the front of the school you can look into
the new wings they've built and the fire alarm will be going off and my friends
tell me they will see a figure of a boy in the same wing the fire alarm is and
if you drive into the pickup area of the front of the school its the 2nd street
light you pass with your car will turn off but only that one for some reason
........ but all this is all true it happend before i moved to denton texas
which was 2 years from this time of the year.... all the rest of my friends
still live there and all of us saw the things ive explained ... hopefully thats
a place you can put in there ohh yea the house on Arkansas Rd in Arlington
Texas... been there actually went inside the cellar but i didnt see any or hear
or feel anything the house on the inside has alot of sprey paint taggings and

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I have a few
creepy encounters to relay, none of which directly happened to me (thank
goodness) but to close family, which is why I believe they are true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First of all an aunt whom I am very close
with has two children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had moved
into the city when her kids were about 5 and 7 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day the youngest, a boy, Matthew, was
outside playing and he bolted out into the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt hurriedly ran out to catch him and
fortunately he was all right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on
their way back to the house they passed a neighbor who was out gardening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remember, my aunt was new to the neighborhood
and had never met this lady.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As my aunt
and cousin passed her she looked at them and said &#8220;you never have to worry
about that one.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little taken aback,
my aunt questioned her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the lady
responded that he has spirits with him keeping him safe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Intrigued (and very open-minded), my aunt
questioned her further to find out about these so-called spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lady went on to describe one of the
spirits as very stand-offish, tall and skinny elderly female.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now vaguely, this could be a description of
my grandma (my aunt&#8217;s mother) who had been dead for several years, never having
met her grandson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet it still wasn&#8217;t
enough to convince my aunt, but once the lady described the second spirit, my
aunt was a believer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said he was a
friendly old man who always stayed close to the boy as a way of thanks to my
aunt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is short, bald and wears
glasses and his name starts with the letter &#8220;P.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eerily enough, this describes my
great-grandpa Peter (my aunt&#8217;s grandpa).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We believe he was thanking my aunt for watching over his wife since my
aunt was really the only one who visited her on a regular basis and kept her
company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">After some time
passed, my aunt accepted her son had two spirits with him, and moved on with
her life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She believed they were her
relatives and were a positive force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly after all this happened, my great grandmother passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And once again, my aunt encountered her
intuitive neighbor, who still didn&#8217;t know anything about the family, they had
only talked that one time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she
commented to my aunt as she looked at Matthew playing outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said he has a third spirit with him
now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said this one is a female and
she stays close to the old man and it makes him very happy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can only assume that my great-grandma was finally
reunited with her husband.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">This odd encounter
with her neighbor brought back some other experiences that happened, but were
pushed back into my aunt&#8217;s mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first one happened to her just when Matthew was first born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The baby was crying in the middle of the
night, so she got up to rock him back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She sat in his room in a rocking chair half-asleep when all of a sudden,
she smelled perfume that was just like her mothers (the one who is supposedly
watching over Matthew, though she didn&#8217;t know this yet).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She noticed the window was open and figured
it was coming in through there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still,
the smell unnerved her and she moved into the living room with the baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she was rocking him the same scent wafted
by her again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time she looked and
the windows were all securely closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Another experience
that happened centering around my grandma happened to another aunt who also had
a son who was born after grandma&#8217;s death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One day, he was playing in his room, talking amiably to himself for a
long time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Amused by his
behavior, his mother asked what he was doing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He looked up at her and plainly said, he was having a tea party with
grandma Mary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This completely freaked my
aunt out because there is no way he could have known her and she never
remembered even telling him her name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I&#8217;m just grateful
grandma got to meet me before she passed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I visited a
psychic who was a friend of a friend whom I had consulted previously several
times and found her to be very accurate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friend told me to ask the psychic about my past lives, so I did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most recent she told me about was that I
was a horsewoman in 1700s Austria, that I loved my horses very much and was
very good with them, but that I fell off a horse and broke my hip and it never
healed properly so I walked with a limp for the rest of that life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What&#8217;s interesting is that 3 years prior to
that, I had visited a chiropractor because I hurt my back, and after looking at
the X-rays he took, the chiropractor asked me if I walked with a limp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, I said no, and he was absolutely
amazed and said that one of my hip bones was malformed and that I should be
walking with a limp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that
apparently I was born that way and I&#8217;ve compensated for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;d heard that it&#8217;s possible to carry over
physical traits from one life to the next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">My name's Carly,
im 16 and from </span><st1:place><span style="">Yorkshire</span></st1:place><span style=""> in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">well, i suppose i
should start from the beginning. It all started when me and my friend Katrina
decided to make a horror film up in the graveyard, we had fun, messed around
and eventually it became a great place to sit and talk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">The graveyard was
at the edge of a village up on the top of a hill and there was a path leading
past the church, through the trees to a clearing and bench where the newest
graves were.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">We'd been going up
there for about a month, month and a half, almost every night and it was
absolutely fine, we never felt in the least bit scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Until that night
...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Our other friend
Sarah had managed to get away for the evening from babysitting her younger
sisters and we'd gone to sit up at the bench. Sarah and Katrina were sitting on
the bench, Sarah to the right and Katrina to the left and i was sat on the path
infront of them. We were talking casually and it was gradually getting darker
and darker until you could vividly see stars in the sky. Suddenly, while i
looked at them, three blue flashes appeared, one to the right of Sarah, one to
the left of Katrina and one inbetween.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">'What the hell was
that?' i asked, but ofcourse, they hadn't seen anything and they sort of
doubted i had. But i knew i had. i know what you're thinking, it was a
reflection. But, we were on top of a hill surrounded by trees in the dark and
they were blue!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">It didnt take long
for me to convince them though as the very next night, me and Katrina were back
up there, talking as the night before, but, we were perched on the arms of the
bench. All of a sudden, Katrina flew forward on to her knees on the seat part
of the bench, it was still quite light, twilight, and, almost straight after
she fell, i saw another blue light dance out from behind where her shoulder
was, fly past me and disappear into the graves. 'What just happened?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">'Someone pushed
me!' she screamed, i helped her up and almost instantly we decided to leave
back down the path and go to the park. Going to the park though, took us up
near the church and back down through an unmarked path through a different part
of the trees and down the hill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">We had our arms
linked because we were quite freaked out but that wasnt the end of it. We'd
almost got to the first line of trees and suddenly, Katrina fell, her feet,
slipped out from underneath her and she fell on her bum dragging me with her.
The grass was bone dry and she couldnt have tripped because there was nothing
to trip over, the path was completely clear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">It was about a
week later when we finally convinced Sarah, as when going up another hill out
of the village, just about on parallel with graveyard, Katrina was thrown to
the floor again, this time on a tarmac road, in the same style as before. At
first, we all just thought she'd tripped, so, we helped her up and carried on
up the road, but, upon our return, just about at the same place, Katrina's legs
were lifted throm underneath her once again. I don't think whatever it is,
really wants, at least Katrina, up there ...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Hi, I still work
for the Corporation that owns that store so no names please, but I thought I
would tell you a little more of the history as I have heard and experienced it.
It actually started as a disgruntled worker. This man was fired and he had a
friend at the newspaper. His theory was that if he put out a story that a man
was killed and buried in the foundation nobody would go eat there so the store
would close. The newest story is that a little boy seven years old<span style="">&nbsp; </span>haunts the place. He was killed in a DUI
crash about 100 yards up the road about 10 or so years ago. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I was an assistant
manager there for 5 years. I have worked in the store all hours of the day by
myself. I have been in it well after closing and sorry to say I have never felt
or seen or experienced anything ever. I am not a person who scoffs at the
people that say they have experienced something. I have an open mind and I have
visited places that have left me knowing that I was just visited by something.
I hiked all threw the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="">Shwangunk</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="">
 </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="">Mountains</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style=""> in NY. And Oscar was a frequent visitor at
my Mother in laws house in NY. I have had my hair lovingly raked out by Oscars
hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Once again I still
work for the company and you have contacted the store about it two years ago.
We did ask. They will never let you stay over night. Shame it would be
interesting. That store is packed out the door on Halloween because everyone
local knows about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Just thought you
might be interested in what the locals say. Have a Great Day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">i have always
believed that there is something out there. i have had two experiences with
ghosts. the first was when i was sitting with a friend one night, up the road
from my house. i just happened to look over and i swear i saw a shadow of a
person walk through my windows. the kicker is, that there were no lights on and
no-one at home. my mom was at work and i was down the street.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">the other story
was more frightening. i used to have some really close friends and we all did
this together. there a story of a man who went camping with his family. they
say he killed his wife and two children, then disappeared himself. he makes his
presence known by an eye shaped yellow glow over the houses. i have seen it,
really. we were at my house one night and two of us saw the black figure of a
man next to a tree in the yard. we immediately turned on the light and wen tout
together. guess what, no-one there. he had a habit of following us around and
scaring us. i know it sounds funny, and i don't know why us, but we did manage
to get rid of him and i haven't seen him since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">believe it or not,
i swear it happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I have always been
fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal, but I cannot say that I ever really
had an experience before this one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I was living in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="">Louisiana</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=""> with my boyfriend at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were living in a relatively new condo. I
had never been afraid or felt weird there before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My mother was moving out of state and gave
me a gilt-framed mirror before she moved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had it for a short time and I kept it in the extra bedroom upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I placed the
mirror at the foot of the extra bed-facing the bed and leaning against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started keeping that door open whereas I
kept it shut before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I just felt
uncomfortable with that door closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Sunday morning before mardi gras in 1996
I had plans to meet family and friends for a parade. My boyfriend was supposed
to come home and meet me before we left, but he never came. No call.
Nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I was upset, but
left without him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had done this type
of thing before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not get a call
from him until that evening. When I made it home that night, I tried not to
argue or get upset because it just made things worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had gotten into bed late that night and
stayed up talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was really good at
talking. Of course I wanted<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to believe
what he said so bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed I began
to feel very nervous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feeling of
unease got stronger as the night wore on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were still talking, but I was becoming so jumpy! It didn't make sense
because we were not discussing anything that would frighten me. The TV was
off-so no scary movies..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the night
progressed, my unease grew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
seemed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>barely able to tear my attention
away from the doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I became so
skittish I had to be right next to my boyfriend. If he walked into our closet
and I had to be right beside him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he
went to the bathroom, I would follow and stand outside in the lavatory. It was
pretty pathetic. I remember telling him "Its in there!", meaning the
extra room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one point I was in the
lavatory and the door to our room slammed shut! I swear I jumped three feet! I
was convinced that something was in the spare bedroom and it felt angry!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend checked the extra room but I
could not step foot in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept
yelling "Get out! Get out!" I ran downstairs and sat on the sofa
facing the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, there was
nothing in the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then began
hearing footsteps overhead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were both
downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where I was sitting was
directly beneath the guest room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
boyfriend mentioned that since I had brought the mirror in he would find
himself looking up when he was home downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said that when he would put his shoes on, his attention was always
drawn to the ceiling which was under the guest room which housed the mirror. He
said that he wasn't scared, but that he couldn't help looking up. At about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="5"><span style="">5 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style=""> I called my mother to come get the
mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was hearing distinct footsteps
overhead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was quite scared!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard another door slam(all had been closed
at this time) and I ran outside! I was only wearing a t-shirt but I didn't
care! I tried to tell myself that the air conditioner kicked on causing the
door to slam, but it hadn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also
noted that the wind was very still, so that didn't do it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stood outside the front door until daylight
came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed my fear just went
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't feel like anything was in
the house like it had before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
came and picked up the mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
told her what happened, she said that she felt that whatever it was was mad at
my boyfriend and not me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her that
I didn't care and to take the mirror!<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">She said that she
never particularly liked the mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
ended up dropping it off at the Goodwill store.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I haven't been that frightened since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to find them snoring when we got up and went into their bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">also: I heard a
girl crying down in the den which we didn't have down there at night (bedrooms
were upstairs) also our neighbor experienced a girl crying over at her house
also,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(her daughter had just died in a
car wreck) at the time most of this occurred.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I lived in a
slightly haunted house here in NC for over a year. Whe4n I was there alone, I
could smell fresh brewed coffee, and none of the three coffeepots would be
going. I could hear someone call my name, knock on the door, walk across the
floor and so on. One night I was IM'ing a friend, and I heard a very deep voice
say "GET OUT!!". I told my friend what I heard, and it said it AGAIN
wit more insistance. When I ignored it again, I heard heavy footsteps walk from
the hallway behind me and go into the living room. My cousin started into the
hall one afternoon, and yelled for me. She had walked into something; she
could,'t see it, but she could feel it. She wanted me to make sure nothing
happened to her. I could see a faint dark form, but when I reached out as if to
touch it, it disappeared. I never did find out who was int he house, but I know
one thing for a fact. It bout drove my dog crazy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">We had orbs and
plasma all over the place. If I can find one of the pictures, I will send it
along.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I will never
forget this experience as long as I live. I was a little kid, probably six or
seven years old. One night, I couldn't sleep, and I was a little nervous about
it. You know how kids are - they can't get to bed and they don't know what to
do. It was dark and I didn't like being up alone. My sister - who shared a room
with me - was snoring away with no problem. Anyway, I was sitting on the edge
of my bed, looking down, starting to cry, all because I felt sad and alone. I
remember that I suddenly thought I should look up, so I did. There was someone
sitting next to me and it looked a little like my dad. I remember I wasn't
scared at all - in fact, although I knew it didn't look exactly like my dad, I
was thrilled to see him. He was smiling at me and I think he had his hand on my
shoulder. I was so sure this person was sitting there that I rummaged under my
bed for a book I wanted him to read. When I got up from looking for the book,
the man was gone. I got really upset - I didn't understand why my dad left. So
I cried. I walked into my dad's room - he was fast asleep. He woke up and put
me back to bed and told me not to worry about it. I fell asleep right away
after that. I realized later that the man sitting there looked a little like my
dad - but A LOT like my late grandfather. I never knew him at all - I was only
about 1 and a half when he died. But my grandma always says I'm a lot like him
and he LOVED me - he had three boys, and I was the first little girl he ever
had around. I know ghost stories usually scare people (and to be honest, the
thought of this happening now makes e shiver) but at the time, I felt no fear
at all. I was thrilled to see him sitting there. And looking back, it makes me
feel so happy and content to know that I saw him once that I can remember. I've
told people this and they say, "Oh, you were little. You don't
remember" or "Are you SURE you weren't seeing things? You were
scared." All those things are true, but I'm not crazy and I'm not a fool -
I KNOW there was a man sitting next to me and it stands out in my memory very
clearly. I was sure of it then, and I'm sure of it now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Roughly two years
ago, I was stationed on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="">USCGC Harriet Lane</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="">, a two hundred and seventy foot cutter out
of </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Portsmouth</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Virginia</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival to my unit, I was
immediately informed about a "ghost" that existed on the fantail (the
stern of the boat) of our vessel named "White Eyes". The story goes
that about 1-2 years prior to my arrival to the cutter,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the vessel was tasked to an alien migrant
interdiction ops patrol off the coast of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Haiti</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While on this patrol, the cutter responded to a report of an over turned
Haitian sail freighter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the cutter
arrived on scene,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they found the
overturned vessel, and several deceased Haitians floating in the water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every one of the deceased were brought on
deck and placed into "body bags".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the deceased however, stood out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Persons who were on the cutter at the time remember one person, a very
tall, elderly man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This mans eyes
allegedly were permanently rolled back into his skull, creating the allusion of
having completely white eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
hearing this story, I immediately denoted it, thinking that they were just
messing around with the new guy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over
the span of my first 3 month patrol I managed to avert seeing White Eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All though, many would report discrepancies
on their security rounds that were very eerie.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, five or six persons reported seeing White Eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still shrugged it off, thinking that they
were still just messing around with the new guy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On my second patrol (this was actually off
the coast of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Haiti</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">) I saw one of the scariest things that I've ever bared witness to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On my first round of the night (approximately
</span><st1:time minute="30" hour="0"><span style="">12:30
 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="">) I ventured down
to the fantail to find that all of the straps on our small boat had been
removed, and all of the secondary gas cans had been unchained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking nothing of it, I fastened all of the
fittings and proceeded though my round, immediately reporting the discrepancy
to the conning officer via radio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On my
second round,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything was normal on
the fantail, and I began to take the stairs up to the flight deck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About two steps up,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and a feeling of total terror came over
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could sense that something was
very wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I immediately turn around to
see the silhouette of a tall man,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with
illuminated white eyes, staring at me with a piercing gaze, roughly ten feet
away from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only truly visible
part of the "person" were the amazingly bright eyes. For about two
seconds I was absolutely petrified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Next, I collected myself, and ran as fast as I possibly could up the
stairs; not stopping until I reached the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I informed everyone of what I had seen, and
they were not at all surprised or skeptical.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This has been a common occurrence on the vessel prior to, and ever since
my arrival to the cutter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">A Ghost Cat<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">What I'm
submitting, are true experiences that were what swayed me to believe in
something like ghosts. Not a human ghost, a cat ghost. About twelve years ago,
when my daughter was a little girl my future ex-wife and I got her a cat. His
name was Tiger and we got him from the pound. We don't know how old he was but
he lived in the house for a few years. Anyway, I think he haunts the house, or
me, since he died. I feel really guilty because I yelled at him one day, and
the next day I found him under my bed- dead! He got down in the cellar after a
heavy rain had flooded it. He was coming downstairs and I yelled at him to get
back upstairs (not those exact words!) and I never saw him alive again. A few
weeks later I woke up in the middle of the night- sleeping on the same bed he
died under. I felt him jump up on the bed like he sometimes did, and walk up
the blanket, which was over me, and sit down on my chest. Very distinctly. Only
thing is, he wasn't there because he's dead! Anyone who has ever owned a cat
that jumps in the bed, knows what it feels like. Cats walk very slowly and
deliberately in the dark. And Tiger always d that- if you were laying in bed he
would walk right up your body looking at you in the eye. I looked around at the
clock and everything and made sure that I was definitely awake when this
happened. I was fully conscious. Not long after that, but not because of that,
I moved my bedroom downstairs to a bigger room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I didn't say or
think anything about it until about six months later, in fact I kind of forgot
about it. My girlfriend at the time was helping me pull up the carpet
downstairs. She suddenly turned around and said- "I just saw a cat run go
around the corner and run up the stairs!"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But there was no cat in the house. She swore that she saw a dark, tabby
cat (Tiger) out of the corner of her eye. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Next, my daughter,
at that time a teenager in high school moved back in with me and slept in the
upstairs bedroom- my old bedroom. I was visiting my girlfriend's house one
evening<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and my daughter was home by
herself. She called me frantically and said that she had just felt a cat
walking on the bed and it woke her up. To this day a couple of years later, she
swears that several times she saw Tiger out of a corner of her eye, or heard
him purring in her ear or patting at her face, laying in her bed in my old
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once, a friend of hers who
didn't know anything about Tiger asked her about "the cat"- which
they just saw run upstairs, but which we did not have. My bedroom is downstairs
now and I seldom go to that old bedroom anymore. When I do go up there, in the
back of my mind I keep my eye out for a cat. So, I guess poor ol' Tiger still
haunts me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>I rolled down the window, because it sounded like there was a woman
crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I Went forward really slowly,
and it stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stopped the cr and
listened, and then it started again, this time though, it sounded like it was

sound along the side of the car, but when i looked in the rearview mirror,
nothing was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finaaly freaked
out, and drove home really fast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="color: blue;">THE
DANCING SHADOW BLOBS<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">I grew up in a town near </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Hartford</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">Connecticut</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">. I was seven or eight (1957-1958) when I had the experience I'm about to
relate. One night, I'd either had a nightmare or a usual childhood case of the
creeps, and I handled the fear, as I sometimes did, by retreating into my
parents' bedroom and begging to share bed space with them. Only my mom was home
on this particular night, while my father was working a night shift. She let me
stay, but she was grumpy, scolded me for my silliness, then rolled over, away
from me, was instantly asleep, and played no part in what followed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Meanwhile, I
couldn't get to sleep and I couldn't relax. It wasn't fear, just restlessness.
I was lying on the right side of the bed, almost next to a west-facing window.
The window was an older sort with a heavy wooden frame and thick wooden
mullions, that we opened by pushing it up, with some effort, and closed by
pulling it down, also with some effort. At that moment, it was closed. The
window was fitted with panes of glass perhaps 3/4ths of a foot square,
separated by the vertical and horizontal wooden mullions. The shade, an
older-style canvas one with a pull-string, was pulled completely down, covering
the entire window. Ambient light from the moon and a few scattered streetlights
shone through the window, illuminating the shade. The effect was of squares of
dim luminosity, cast by the panes, separated by black bars of shadow cast by
the mullions, the bars crisscrossing horizontally and vertically to frame three
stacked, horizontal rows of luminous squares, each row with three squares:
left, middle, and right. What I saw had to do with the bottomost horizontal
row.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Still unable to
sleep, I was sitting up for the moment, looking casually toward that window,
when, without prelude, a troop of shadowy "blobs" suddenly marched
leftward, in single file, from beyond the right edge of the rightmost square,
as if from offstage. There were perhaps five of these blobs, which began to
lightly hop and bounce about, in a comical, cartoonish way, along the bottom of
the illuminated square.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I can best
describe a typical blob as follows: it was dull black, the same black as the
shadows cast by the mullions. Imagine a stylized star, cut out of black paper,
with the standard five points. Cut off the points almost but not quite at their
bases. Now you have five straight edges separated by five notches. Make the
straight edges bulge slightly outwards. Now round out all the sharp points,
ending up with a rounded object with five low but distinct bulges where the
points of the star were. The bulges correspond very roughly to a head, arms and
legs. Soften the edge of the object to render it fuzzy. Imagine the object
moving about, along a horizontal surface, hopping along on alternate
leg-bulges, and occasionally making impressive leaps. Imagine each of the five
bulges on the blob slightly extending, then slightly retracting, not all at
once but individually, in a rhythm, constantly, and you have a
"blob." Each blob was about the size of a silver dollar,
two-dimensional, and completely silent. All looked exactly alike, and all were
constantly in motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">The five blobs I'd
seen trooping in from offstage were soon busy dancing, cavorting, hopping up
and down, leapfrogging over one another, and sometimes making high, broad
jumps, but all confined to the rightmost square. The blobs seemed to be made of
the same "substance" as shadow itself,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and behaved as if other shadows, including
other blobs,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>were something like solid
matter to them. They acted as if the bars of shadow cast by the mullions and
separating the squares were semi-solid barriers that the blobs could cross only
with difficulty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About ten minutes after
their appearance, one of the blobs forced its way through the black bar
separating the right and middle squares, slowly and with an effort, like a man
pushing his way through a thick hedge, and landed in the middle square. Once
that particular blob had done this, the others, one at a time, followed the
first into the middle square,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but
without meeting the resistance met by the first blob. Tha bar of shadow was no
longer a barrier. Now the blobs were free to cavort in the right and middle
squares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Meanwhile, more
blobs were popping in from the edge of the right square and joining in the fun.
Occasionally, one blob would make an impressive forward-and-reverse jump,
hopping in a great arc over its fellows, from the right square into the middle
one, then immediately hopping in reverse to its original spot, five or six
times, in one continuous motion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">At first, I felt a
little bit of fear, realizing that I was seeing something decidedly unnatural,
a phenomenon I couldn't cross-reference with any other. But the blobs were so
sprightly, whimsical, and non-threatening that I soon forgot any fear and just
sat watching their antics, fascinated. In time, they broke the shadow barrier
between the middle and left squares, as they had the barrier between the right
and middle squares, and were now free to gambol about in all three squares, all
across the bottom of the windowshade. By now there were perhaps fifteen blobs
in all, hugely enjoying themselves. One blob made an incredible fore-and-back
leap, five or six times in a row, from the right square all the way across the
middle square into the left square. I silently rooted for the little guy. Near
the very end of the show, it or another blob repeated that display, as if
showing off one last time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">This Dance of the
Shadow Blobs went on for most of an hour. Twice, I lifted the shade to see if
there were objects outside casting the shadows, but the light was too dim for
me to make out any such thing, while I realized that there were no creatures in
known nature able to act in such a fashion, casting shadows but behaving as if
their shadows were confined to squares of light within a shade. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Once, I became
bored with the show and lay down for maybe ten minutes. When I sat up and
looked at the window and shade, the blobs were still there and the party was
still in full force. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Perhaps ten
minutes after I resumed watching the Blob Fest, and about three-quarters of an
hour after its beginning, it began showing signs of winding down. There were
fewer blobs, and the remaining ones' activities became gradually less
energetic. When perhaps five blobs were left, the show wrapped up abruptly. As
if on some signal, the blobs stopped their antics, dropped to
"ground" level along the bottom of the squares, lined up in single
file, and marched off to the right edge of the right square and out of sight.
The show was over. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I never had the
feeling or notion that the blobs were putting on some sort of show exclusively
for me. They seemed confined to their own little pocket universe, completely
unaware of my presence. I didn't participate, but merely observed from a
distance, like someone watching a musical play rehearsal from some hidden spot.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I have no explanation
for the Shadow Blobs. I know I wasn't dreaming, in the same way that I knew I'm
not asleep and dreaming right now. There was no sense of waking after the blobs
disappeared, time passed normally all through the blob convention, nothing else
around me changed as in the manner of dreams, and I didn't react with the
unquestioning nonchalance of the dream state. I acted as any curious young
child might when faced with a new, unexplainable, and fascinating phenomenon
that poses little or no threat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">If there's a
psychological explanation, I lean toward it having been an hallucination
brought on by boredom, sleeplessness and the dim lighting. Sensory deprivation
experiments have demonstrated that relaxed subjects, staring continuously at
something like a dimly-lit screen in dark surroundings, will begin
hallucinating, often well within an hour. Yet, I'd never experienced anything
like the blobs before that night, and I never have since. If what I saw was
objectively real, then perhaps I glimpsed some realm of nature rarely seen,
where shadow is solid or semisolid matter, and where living creatures are made
out of shadow-stuff. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="color: blue;">HOLE IN
THE DARK<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">This happened when I was five or six, and may, or may not, have been an
hallucination brought on by fever. I've hallucinated occasionally in
fever,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but those were distortions of
size and perspective, and the fever on this particular night was mild and well
below hallucination strength. It was nighttime and I was in bed, restless,
tossing and turning, trying to get into some comfortable position. Running out
of options, I tried something different altogether: lying face down, my face in
my hands. This felt comfortable for a minute or so, but then I saw what looked
like a perfectly round <i>hole </i>materialize, as it were, in the darkness of
my closed eyes, and directly in front of me. The hole was darker than the
darkness that surrounded it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Spooked, I pulled
out of that position and sat up, eyes open. The Hole was still there, right in
front of me, even with my eyes uncovered and open, seemingly about six feet in
front of me in the dark room, the apparent size of a baseball at that distance,
and still darker than the darkness surrounding it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stayed exactly in the center of my field of
vision, no matter where I looked. It never changed its appearance, distance, or
size, and gave the impression of being <i>not </i>a flat, round-edged disc, or
a sphere, but a <i>hole</i> <i>in the darkness itself</i>, opening into some
greater darkness behind and beyond. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Now I freaked, and
Shirley, the babysitter--Mom and Dad were at a movie--came rushing to my
rescue, switching on the room light and banishing The Hole. I told her what I'd
seen. She gently blamed it on a dream and my fever, and presently left, turning
the light out. There was no sign of The Hole. I remembered that I'd brought it
into existence by laying face down, face in hands. I couldn't resist the
experiment of repeating that position to see if I could thereby re-summon The
Hole. I succeeded, and events passed as before, The Hole parked in front of my
field of vision. Again, I freaked, and again, Shirley ran to my room and wiped
out The Hole by turning the light on. I explained my freakout, she cautioned me
against summoning the Hole again via my special method, then once again left,
turning off the light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I took Shirley's
advice seriously, with no desire to tempt fate once again, but for awhile, I
looked fearfully all about the darkened room, wondering if that Hole was merely
hiding somewhere for the moment and might soon reappear, even without being
summoned. It didn't, and I dropped off to sleep. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="color: blue;">THE
HOWLING CAR<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">I had this dream, or experience, when I was
no older than five (1955). It began as a dream, in which my friend Mike and I
were walking along a familiar street in our neighborhood, heading toward a
small corner store to buy candy and cards and such, as we often did. All of a
sudden, a horrible, high-pitched, metallic, ear-piercing <i>screeching and
whining sound </i>came from some source behind us. I turned, and saw the
source. It was a metallic box, about the size of an average hardcover book,
attached flatwise to the underside of a bulky gray </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="">Plymouth</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style=""> parked along the roadside, facing away from
us, the box's nearest edge flush with the back edge of the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the surface of that nearest edge was
something like a wing nut, slowly rotating, and that was the source of the
painful sound. Terrified, Mike and I started to run, but we seemed paralyzed by
that screeching noise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I woke up at that
moment, and, to my horror, I could still hear that very same screeching,
whining sound, as loud and painful to the ear as ever. It seemed to be all
around me, not coming from any particular direction. Even at that young age, I
knew that dreams shouldn't follow me into the waking state, and that if they did,
something must be seriously wrong with reality or with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I freaked, crying out in the night, and my
mom and dad rushed into the room, and soon had me calmed and falling asleep
once more. They'd heard nothing unusual. But that dream, or phenomenon, has remained
as one of my earliest memories and one of my most vivid, along with The Hole In
the Dark and the Dancing Shadow Blobs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="color: blue;">BEDEVILED<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MOON<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">An occurrence that might or might not have
been some sort of waking dream came my way in the same general age span, 5-7,
as in the preceding accounts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I was wandering
about in my neighborhood one evening in early autumn. The sun had set a half
hour ago or less, the weather was still warm and pleasant, and the sky was
clear, the sort that generally follows a mild, sunny day. I remember exactly
where I was standing when I saw something that sticks in my mind to this day
and refuses explanation, even though what I saw could not have been happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">The full moon was
perched in the sky to the general southeast, just beginning to increase in
brightness as the sky darkened following sunset. But there was something wrong
with that idyllic sight: the Moon was <i>rotating</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">It was rotating
vertically, i.e., as the Earth would seem to if you looked at it from space
from such a position that the poles were to your right and left. The Moon (or
whatever it was) rotated visibly, a complete rotation taking perhaps 30
seconds. There were shadowy, dark gray areas on the Moon-thing, the same sort
one sees on the Moon anytime it's visible, except that these were moving along
with the Moon-thing's rotation. I remember seeing certain markings show up
repeatedly, as they would on a rotating object. One marking in particular very
vaguely resembled a human figure lying on its side, but I should make clear
that the resemblance was coincidental and no more humanlike than the
man-in-the-moon face. I recall it because I kept an eye on the rotating Moon
and saw that marking roll into sight and out of sight several times, always at
the 30-or-so-second interval. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I already knew a
fair amount of kid's-level astronomy and general science, and I knew that the
Moon does NOT rotate, but keeps one side towards the Earth, constantly. All I
could infer from what I was seeing was that perhaps, sometimes, the Moon DID
rotate, for whatever incomprehensible reasons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't realize at that age that it would have taken a mighty natural
force to start the Moon rotating, and that the Moon, rotating as fast as I
seemed to be seeing, would have torn itself apart, while the fragments, caught
in Earth's gravity, would have battered the Earth into a seething, smoking,
probably lifeless ruin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">So what did I see?
A balloon, like an advertising dirigible? No, because if<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see that much detail, I would have
been able to see lettering and logos, but I saw only meaningless shapes like
the Moon's markings. A waking dream?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
can't prove it wasn't a dream, I can only say that my memory of the sight is
like any memory of a real, vivid, and puzzling occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know I was awake then in the same way that
I know I'm awake right now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Moon?
No, for all the obvious reasons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">What puzzles me
most is how something so illogical and unnatural could act so mechanically
blase, a moonlike object rotating at a constant rate and showing the same
markings repeatedly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="color: blue;">LIVING
PATCH OF MIST<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In 1970 -- I was in my twenties and finishing
college -- I used to take evening and nighttime walks to "The
Reservoir," just a block away from where I lived. It was a fenced-in but
easily accessible area the size of maybe three football fields. Vegetation
there was a mix of grass and woodland. There was a paved road running through
it, and it was a great place for taking walks and clearing out one's head after
classes and homework or summer blues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
small reservoir was underground, beneath a grass-covered, man-made hill with
flat sides and a flat top: a truncated pyramid about 300 feet long (east-west),
200 feet wide, and 50 feet high. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">One mid-summer
night, I was taking my usual walk through that area, passing the reservoir on
my left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was completely dark by then,
with no moon. Close to the west end of the reservoir, and maybe two-thirds of
the way to the top of its flank, I saw what at first looked like the image a
lit window would cast on the ground just outside, at night. It was a yellowish,
more or less square shape, maybe three feet on a side,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with in-bulges of shadow here and there, as
if there were plants and knick-knacks on the window sill, casting shadows. Bit
there were no houses and no windows around. Very puzzled and mystified, I began
hiking up the side of the reservoir to get a better look at this phenomenon. As
I got to within fifteen feet of the patch, I saw that it was definitely a patch
of luminous mist, flat and positioned a few inches off the ground, slightly
above the level as the recently mowed grass. The ground was sloped, being the
side of a lopped pyramid, and the area of the patch of mist was parallel to the
sloping ground. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">As I got closer,
the patch started to <i>move</i>, very slowly, away from me and further up the
hill. It picked up speed and spread out, losing the squarish shape. As I
reached that spot, the patch had broken up into streamers of faintly glowing,
bluish mist or fog, flowing along the ground at that same height, away from me,
and still picking up speed, as if it were running away, until it had dissolved
completely. It<i> wasn't </i>a case of me or my feet kicking up a wind that
moved the patch of mist. That sort of motion would have just slightly churned
and jumbled a little cloud of mist. This cloud of mist moved <i>very
purposefully </i>and <i>under power all its own</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It acted like a living creature. This <i>purposeful
</i>movement, under its own power, was the strangest quality of the little mist
cloud. Sometimes I've wondered if the cloud was just a patch of
will-o'-the-wisp, a natural phenomenon, but that doesn't explain the quality of
the movement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="color: blue;">GHOSTS
OR GRUMPY OLD MEN?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">From 1980-1985, I lived in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="">Berkeley</span></st1:City><span style="">, </span><st1:State><span style="">California</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="">. I had a day job doing yardwork in exchange for rent and utilities,
working in two residential areas, both within a fifteen-minute walk of each
other, a few blocks south of the campus of the University of
California-Berkeley. I did my yardwork three days a week, and walked from one
area to the other to get it all done in a day. On that walk, in either
direction, I always passed a certain house on a street corner (I can't remember
the street names) between the main drags of Telegraph and Shattuck Avenues, in
a quiet residential area of families and UC students. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">This house was a
medium-gray, two-story Victorian, the sort whose archetype spans the cover
of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>nearly every gothic romance
paperback. It lacked only the frightened young woman fleeing into the
foreground and tossing one last look over her shoulder at the brooding,
sinister mass of the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">The house looked
firmly closed up and unoccupied, though with no cheap repair jobs like boards
nailed over windows. The small, suburban back and side yards were home to
several pine trees that seemed to cast an aura of depression and gloom over the
house and yard, even on the sunniest days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never saw lights on within the house if I passed it when it was
getting dark. The front porch was littered with pine needles in brown drifts,
and decorated with bits and pieces of old junk mail and wind-trash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I only saw people
in and around that house once, but I'm not likely to forget that one time.
Walking by there around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="12"><span style="">noon</span></st1:time><span style=""> one day in spring or summer, I saw three men
walking about the yard, as well as in and out ot the house. They were short,
dumpy, balding, middle-aged men,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>caucasian,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with odd body
proportions, who shared a very obvious family resemblance, but not close enough
to proclaim them triplets. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">What struck me
then, and now, when I recall the sight of the men, is their physical appearance
and facial expressions. Their backs looked slightly but permanently swayed into
noticeably uncomfortable-looking S-shapes, while their limbs were short and
pudgy, although the men weren't dwarfs in the physical sense. Their ugliness
stopped just short of being grotesque and deformed. Their faces closely
resembled one another's, while all three faces were some of the most negative
I've ever beheld, with bitter glares and frowns of what looked like
ill-controlled anger, disgust, and frustration, well on the way to becoming
active malice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The faces never lost
those ill-tempered frowns and glares duringthe few minutes I watched the men
while I slowed down my walk by the house. The men never talked to one another,
and scarcely seemed to notice me, if they did at all. Their clothing was odd,
too. It looked normal in and of itself, merely trousers and buttoned shirts of
no special style, but the apparel didn't fit the mens' bodies correctly, being
too tight in certain odd places and loose and billowy in other odd spots, while
the pot-bellies of all three men bulged almost cartoonishly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">I was amazed and
fascinated, and I always will be,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by the
appearance and activity of those slightly unnatural-looking men, wandering
around in what for them was the perfect setting. I even wondered then if they
were ghosts, but they seemed too solid and objectively real to be ghosts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Later that day, I
walked home past that house. It looked shut to the point of being airtight, as
before, and there were no lights on in the windows. I never again saw the men
there whom I'd seen on that day. Yet, I'll never forget them or the feeling I
had on that one day, when I walked by a supposedly uninhabited house and saw
its true inhabitants, or people who could have been.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I wanted to share some of the things that happened to me and
various members of my family in my grandmother&#8217;s house. It is a house that was
built in the early 60&#8217;s&#8230;brick, three bedrooms and two baths. Nothing abnormal&#8230;.well&#8230;..except
this stuff.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My grandmother was a very religious woman, she read the
bible before going to bed every night. She would not speak of these happenings
unless you coaxed it out of her. One evening, she put my then 6 year old uncle
down for bed. She walked down the hall, and walked back up the hall and glanced
in his room before continuing on her way&#8230;there sitting on his chest was an imp
type being, sort of like a little tiny man, he turned and looked at my
grandmother and gave her a slow wicked smile and faded away. My grandmother
snatched my uncle up and ran out of the house. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About a week before my grandfather died, the lamps in the
living room, which had been unplugged for vacuuming around the furniture all of
a sudden blew their bulbs. The family was all sitting in the living room when
it happened. While they were still in shock over the lamps, they witnessed
something like a towel being thrown from my uncle&#8217;s room (same little boy as
previously mentioned) into the bathroom across the hall. When they went to
inspect nothing was there. Also, one evening my grandmother was using the
bathroom, when she heard a jar full of marbles fall crashing into the tub,
since my uncle had a marble collection, she didn&#8217;t think too much of it, until
she moved the shower curtain and nothing was there. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After my grandfather died, it calmed down a bit. When I was
about 10, my cousins who were the same age<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and one older spent the night with my grandmother. While we were
settling down and trying to go to sleep, there was a bright glow in the room,
and something tried to strangle me. I could not breathe, my cousins could not
move and we were terrified. When we were finally let go, we ran to tell my
grandmother who reassured us, but was scared just the same.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 16 or so, I spent the night with my grandmother I
was sleeping in a sleeping bag on her living room floor&#8230;I woke up in the middle
of the night to someone standing over me&#8230;it was all black and solid, and I
jumped up and ran and got my grandmother. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When she passed away, my mother offered to give me the
house. I was young and newlywed, and I turned the offer DOWN!!!<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyone that has ANY idea what this experience was all about,
please feel free to email me!!!!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As a child I experienced things that at the time I did not
question but now almost twenty years later I am beginning to become a little
more than curious and wonder if I have something inside me that allows me to
see things others can't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents
house is rumoured to built on the site of a monstary and later on in history a
German Prisoner of War Camp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of the
experiences I have encountered seemed to be linked to this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have many, many stories and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>don't know quite how to write them down or
where I should start.... I think I'll put them under headlines.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Pyramid<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is the one that mystifies me the most.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was around thirteen I shared a bedroom
with my younger sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both woke up
around the same time and saw a pyramid shape about two foot tall by our
wardrobe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had a kind of glow about it
and as we stared it raised itself up about six inches and moved towards my bed
before disappearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never worked
out what it was or what it symbolised.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Man on bike<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Again this is an experience I shared with my sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were talking in bed with the light off
when my mum came in and turned the light on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My sister asked her to stop as the man on the bike would disappear and
sure enough a man on a motorbike drove across our bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We live in a two storey house!!!<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The monk<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is the one the whole family has experinced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every now and again a man dressed in
traditional monks clothing will walk from our living room and out towards the
staricase before disappearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
an air of calmness about him and we do not feel threatened by his
presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rarely talk about him to
people outside the family but others have commented on seeing shadows and
feeling cool in certain areas of our house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact the other day my four year daughter was watching television in
the living room and stated that a man had just walked pasted her and touched on
the head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was not scared or bothered
by this at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have run out of room
but this is just an insight to what I have experienced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Am I weird or do others experince this amount
ofsupernatural activity??<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: dotg@alltel.net<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Im a 14 year old girl who lives in <st1:State><st1:place>Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>,the
last few years ive lost animals which were very dear to me,mainly my most loved
ones.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first one i lost was Tiger,he was a calico,and which is
very very rare,any ways it was a normal day boreing and such i was sitting at
my computer listening to music and eating pizza.I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>looked out the door after my dad wa
leaveing,and seen my kitten had been run over by my dad,which was the very
first time ive seen an animal run over,all i could do is watch him die.About
the next night i was standing outside it wasn't to late about 8pm and heard a
cat meowing in the porch next to where i was standing.I walked into the porch
to see tiger,sitting there and stareing at me then he disappeared,since then
ive not seen tiger.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now to tell you about checkers,and Benji.Checkers was
another kitten,a brother of tiger,it was a early morning after my mom went to
work.i had just fed them(this is after tiger died)And went inside,hours later
it began to rain,and i went outside and found Checkers laying dead in the
garden,and i wasn't sure what happend(i think the lady across the street
posioned him now.)So my dad barried him that evening,up to now i still see him
in the garden at times.Later that day after Checkers died,my dog benji he had
Conjestive heart failure,i had him for 7 years my granma an granpa took him for
a ride,and let him drink icewater on the way to pick up my mom.He died in the
car five minutes before my mom got to the car,so when they got back heart
broken i cryed for days and i still see him walking around the house,and it
still scares me at times.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Last one is my cat who i wasn't a fan of but still cared deeply
for..Devil,he got his name from me because he looked evil he was solid black
and wasn't friendly,he bit my friend on the hand and she sitll has the scar.On
the fourth of july,he was hit of course i didn't see,untill i was rideing my
scooter down the road and stoped in the drive way and smelled something well i
looked to the ditch,and he was laying there dead,i cried worse than i ever
have(strangely)then it began to storm..and we couldn't barry him at the
time,like when checkers died(it rained)when benji died(it rained)when tiger
died(it rained)After we barried devil,i began to see him ONLY AT NIGHT!! out
side on the ramp looking into the door at me,he looked more calm and nice than
he did when he was alive.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">These are my true storys,and to this day i still see them
all..<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have had more than my fair share of ghostly
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first experience was
right after High School (1994) and My grandmother had just died. We had had her
cremated and her ashes we in their urn on top of her headboard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After she died my grandfather shut her door
and never opened it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came to
visit him and when it was time to go to bed I went to her room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always slept with her when I went to visit
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well she had a cat named Miss
Piggy that cat slept with her every night that she had had her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well afte rmy grandmother died and my
grandfather had shut her door the cat hadn't been allowed back in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So needless to say Miss Piggy was very happy
when I went to go to bed and opened her dorr, cause she came flying in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We laid down to go to sleep and got all<span style="">&nbsp; </span>covered up, Miss Piggy in her usual spot at
the bottom of the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We laid there for
what seemed like 30 minutes to an hour and all of the sudden her curtains
started to fly up in the air like a huge breeze was blowing in, Only thing was
the windows were not open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miss Piggy
stood up and arched her back and started hissing like crazy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I said, "Grandma, please go away I
can't deal with this right now" and the curtains stopped and the cat laid
down and went back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is
that one.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Next in 1997 I met my best friend Michelle and her husband
had just passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we would go out
to the mall or something she would always say Wade would want me to leave the
TV on so if someone was going to break in they would think someone was
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, she never would leave the TV
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So everytime when we would come back
her TV would be on but not on a channel on the Blue Screen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was odd but I was like wow, your
tv comes on, you know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then it just
started getting a little wierder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
would come back and of course the TV would be on, but then she would put the
key in the door and try to open it and the door knob would only turn just a
little bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like someone was
holding the door knob from the inside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because you could turn it slightly and then not at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She started using her upper body to try to
open it and then almost fell down when the door fell open, and she almost fell
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don;t remember anything
happening for a while after that and then she moved her trailor from <st1:State><st1:place>West
  Virginia</st1:place></st1:State> to <st1:place><st1:City>Burnaugh</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Kentucky</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then things started getting really bad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now instead of the TV coming on the the blue screen it would be
Kung-fu.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day I had to go somewhere and
Shell was supposed to go with me so I went to get her up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came to the door and you could tell that
she just got out of bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked behind
her and every piece of furniture in her living room was turned over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had been up ealier to get her daughter
ready and off to school and went back to bed, when she was up earlier
everything was normal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now she gets up
lie 2-3 hours later and her enitre living room was tore up?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had also been complaining that she kept
feeling something get into bed with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It felt furry like a bear she said and it would attack her I guess
because she would show me scratches down her backside (buttocks area and
thighs) that did not look like fingernail scratches, they were like a wide cat
nail scratch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Welll thigns kept going on
and her and her daughter went on vacation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She asked me to come over and turn lights on and I could use her
computer and stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came over one
night and opened the screen door and the front door, walked in and shut them
both completely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went over and sat
down at the computer desk with my back to the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sidenote-when her trailor had been moved
from WV to KY it had been bent and messed up pretty bad so her doors were hard
to open or shut cause things weren't square anymore.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Front door opened completely not hte
screen door then the front door just the front door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing else happened and I got out of there
pretty fast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well another night she was
baby sitting my liile girl for me and I would go pick her up after work and
everyone would normally be asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
would go get my daughter and put her in her car seat and leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well when I came in this night I sat down in
her chair and the TV came on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
figured that the remote was under my butt, but it wasn't. I looked over and all
of her remotes we neatly side by side on her table??<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said, "Wade, it is <st1:PersonName>Kelly
 </st1:PersonName>not Michelle and the TV turned off."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That happened to several people in her
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She talked to a pastor about her
problems and he came over to "bless" the house and told her to keep a
bible open to the lord's prayer and it never happened again.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Most recently is my mothers new house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They bought the house in 2002 and the
previous owners had both died of natural causes in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one ever really thought anything about
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was creepy when they first looked
at it because everything was as it would be and like someone would be home any
second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they moved in my brothers
were making noise in the kitchen so they started the rule that no one was
allowed in the kitchen afetr <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
as she is a light sleeper a hair hitting hte floor could wake her up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night she heard the cabinets shutting and
opening and got mad and went into the kitchen but no one was there, she figured
the ran upstairs the back way so she went upstairs to catch them breathing hard
after running aaway...but they were both sound asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the basement you could hear her walk up
behind you because the floor was tile, so my brother would be down there doing
laundry and she would be walking all around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then she really started bothering him upstairs after my brother left for
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The home has hard wood floors throughout but
they are all covered up with carpet??<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
the doors are hard to open and close because the carpet is thick and the doors are
a tad to big.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well if he would go to bed
with his door open she would slam them, hard task for a human much less a
spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Int he shower she will poke him
through the curtain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has seen his bed
indent from someone sitting on it that isn't there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The son of these 2 spirits is the one who
sold the house and he allowed my parents to go through and decide what they
wanted to keep and he made a price and added it to the total.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So there are a lot of her things still in the
house, and I think that is one reason why she is around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She alos like to move his watch and things
from his dresser to his desk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well he
has since left for college so while my parents went to <st1:place><st1:City>Slidell</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>LA</st1:State></st1:place> to help with the hurricane disaster
relief I was in charge of feeding the fish and collecting the mail etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went over everyday and she never bothered
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the last day as I was leaving I
saw my mom's family Bible laying upside down on the floor still open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in the middle of the table the last
time I left where it stays and no it was upside down on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well I picked it up and put it back where it
belonged, although I though it wierd because there is NO WAY that it could have
fallen off and landed that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plus we
don't have earth quakes or anything like that to shake it and cause it to
fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well I walked out the door locked
it fromt he outside and left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
called the next night to tell me she had gotten home safe and that the house
looked nice, but I could have taken the 2 seconds it would have taken and
picked her family Bible up? I said, "Mom, before I left you house
yesterday I noticed the Bible was on the floor and I did pick it up."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said, "Well it is laying upside down
on the floor, I just figured Ray (my son) did it."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said, "No, I saw it on the floor
before I left.........the story I already told you......and locked the door
behind me".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said something else
trying to explain it and I said LAHOMA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the lady who lived there and funny thing they still keep a sign
in the garden that says Lahoma's garden.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No wonder she hangs around, all of her things are still here.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well that is it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
life of ghost stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last one
happened this past weekend. :)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I can confirm most of this for you. My name is Paul Hammond
and I worked at the Middlesex Shelter from<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">1996 to 2000. You wrote this:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Shelter) - The TV in the women area changes channels and
goes on &amp; off by itself. If you&amp;#65533;re downstairs alone you will
sometimes hear your name called. While in the shower you can see a shadow walk
by. Things disappear and will reappear days later in a different spot. While
sleeping some have had their beds shaken and blankets pulled down. A few
people, while watching TV, have had their shirts tugged at.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And once in a while the lights will flicker on &amp; off and
radio dials will change on there own. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I can confirm all but the "Shadow". The blankets
story is interesting because that is how the staff would wake people up
everyday if they were not up on time at <st1:time minute="15" hour="6">6:15AM</st1:time>.
I have no doubt the rest is true because I experienced it as well. You could
feel it was an evil place and many had suffered and died there. We had about 50
to 70 people a night stay there and gave meals to about 50 more each day. Death
happened all the time due to clients doing drugs and other factors you can
picture. We had about one death a week wile I worked there. Also to many of the
clients this was the place they identified as home. Some have stayed there<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">9 years or more. Also the adjacent building <st1:Street><st1:address>201
  Middlesex St.</st1:address></st1:Street> and next to it the site of what had
been Butches Bar is also haunted by the Homeless Dead. 201 was also a
place<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that Mill Workers received there
pay in the 1800's.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have a question on another site in Downtown Lowell. Very
interested in what you know about <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>River</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName>Place</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Towers</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
( was <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Merrimack</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Plaza</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
