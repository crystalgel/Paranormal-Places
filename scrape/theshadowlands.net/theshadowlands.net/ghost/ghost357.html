<p class="MsoNormal">The Farmers Dog</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: rositori@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In <st1:country-region><st1:place>england</st1:place></st1:country-region>
I would often stay awake untill the sun went down in summer. When it went own I
would usually lie in bed and try to get to sleep. But sleep would not come
untill at least <st1:time minute="15" hour="11">11:15</st1:time>. I thought it
was because I had an active mind from the day and I simply was ot tired. But
the thing was , if I had an actie mind , surely I would fall alsleep easily i I
was tired. But that was not the case. I began having feelings that something
was watching me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>, and preventng me from
sleep. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night , I went through my normal routine and when
darkness fell , the feeling of being watched came upon me once again. My
brother came into my room and sat on my bed . He told me that there was a black
dog sitting outside his bedroom window and just watching him. Of course , I did
not entirl belive him. He opened my curtains just a tiny bit an looked out. He
gasped and looked back. He told me that the black dog was , this time outside
my window. I too looked out and there it was. It just looked at me. It was
entirely black and very big. I think that it was an irish wolfhound. It had big
yellow eyes that nevr blinked. Not once. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now my brother<span style="">&nbsp; </span>being
six years older than me was obviously much braver than I. He went back into his
room and than came back into mine. With him he had his duvet. That night he
slpt in my room , so that we both would not lose our minds and become scared
out of our wits. As usual at <st1:time minute="15" hour="11">11:15</st1:time>
roughly , the feeling that I was being watched left me. I looked out of my
window and I found that the dog was gone. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next dy when we woke up , we decieded to tell our
parents. We thought if they wont believe a eight year old girl , they must
believe a 14 year old boy. So we told them and they told us to go to the musuem
and find out what we could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So , we went
to the museum and told the person in chrge of our experience. The man listened
carefully and when we had finished , he went over to a large filling cabinet.
He sorted through untill he came to a file named "The farmers
dog"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside there were lots of
pictures and recordings of the dog , and when the dog had been sighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The man told us that , many years ago , when our village had
been only a tiny hamlet , there had been lots of farms. One man called John
Brown owned one farm. He was known for his scary repuation and for his scary
dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>John Brown treated his dog terribly
, he kicked the dog if he didnt do what he was told and would beat him up when
the dog<span style="">&nbsp; </span>let a fox get away. One day the
farmer was so angry with his dog , that he beat him to death.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now the owner of the museum had given us lots of info that
helped us a lot but somehing remained unsolved. Why did the dog come to our
part of the vllage , and why did he leave at <st1:time minute="15" hour="11">11:15</st1:time>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man told us that the area where my
brother and I lived , is where the farmer used to hunt for animals. Sometimes
the farmer would let his dog go out alone to search for food but the dog had to
be back by <st1:time minute="15" hour="11">11:15</st1:time>. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My brother and I were plaesed by our discovery but the dog
still visited us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man at the museum
told us that when we next saw the dog , we were to go outside and stroke him.
We were to tret him excactly how a dog should be treated. We were to tell him
that the dog did not have to hunt anymore and that he could just rest in
peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So , the next time we saw the dog
we did this , although terrified. When we touched the dog it felt like we were
touching air. But the dog seemed to listen and after that night , we never saw
the dog again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sleep Paralysis Experience</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: hillbilly_auctions@yahoo.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Okay, this is very weird.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I just last night experienced for the first time what I think is Sleep
Paralysis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just wanted to know your
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was using a pulse oximeter last night so my doctor could
look at my sleeping patterns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
having a hard time sleeping, so I laid on the sofa for a bit to see if I could
drift off while watching TV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
have any luck there because I kept hearing this banging noise off in the
distance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about 45 mins of listening to my
husband snore and snort, I decided to go sleep in my daughter's room. (She is
away visiting her grandparents).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway,
not long after laying down in her bed, I had the feeling I wasn't alone in the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The door closed when the A/C
kicked on (at least I hoped that's why) and it kinda jolted me awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was making up my mind to go back to bed in
my room when the weirdest sensation came over me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't move, I could barely breathe and
that feeling of someone else in room was over-powering and I would swear I
heard rustling behind my head, coming from the closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a minute or so, it stopped and I went to
get out of bed and it started again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried to say "stop", but I couldn't make my lips move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened about 6 times in a row.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last time I jumped up and RAN to the
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cat was just outside the door
all hunched and hissing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped into
my bed and pulled the covers over my head!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since we moved in this house, I have felt something here,
and even thought I'd caught glimpses of something out of the corner of my
eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My kids have never said anything to
me, but they all sleep together in the same bed, and often leave the TV in my
daughters rooms on, with the sound off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now I am really worried and I don't know if I want my kids sleeping in
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She's going to be gone thru the
weekend, and I was thinking about trying to get up the nerve to try to sleep in
there again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the way, I will be
calling my doctor to get the results of the pulse oximeter test next week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am hoping that I can get a copy and see if
there are strange readings back to back.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks for reading my story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It makes me feel better to tell someone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Sisters Apartment</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My youngest sister was taking care of an elderly gentleman
some time back and with her pay</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">they gave her an apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The apartment was situated upstairs and the doctor had an apart</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">ment downstairs.. Now the house was really old I'm not sure
just how old but befor the doctor</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">bought it it was a funeral parlor..Then many years ago he
made a doctors office with 5 examination rooms and a records room in the front
of the house.....Now the house was set up </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">like this...It had both a front door (leading to the doctors
office area) and a back door witch led</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">to his apartment and stairs leading up to the other 2
apartments...the one upstairs apartment </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">was vacant...(the one in the back) and my sister had the
front upstairs apartment....Now her </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">apartment had the front entrance also...If you walked
through the front door..to the left was</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the old doctors offices and a big foyer with a winding
staircase wich led to my sisters </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">apartment.. If you took the front way the stairs end at a
hallway about 15 ft long and on your</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">left was her bedroom, the attic entrance...and then straight
ahead was the door to her living</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">room...Well one night I had had a dream about that area of
her apartment and the panic and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">fear I experienced was overwelming to me and I couldn't get
it off my mind...When I had visited</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">her I senced something but didn't pay any attention to it
until I had this dream..After that I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">mostly used the back door...But when ever I would be in that
hallway near the front stairs I</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">would always get this very heavy feeling , and a feeling of
urgency to get myself into the living</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">room area and fast....just as you entered the living room to
the left was her two daughters</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">room...The doctor was very old and senile so he needed
pretty much to be helped with every</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">thing...So my sister had baby monitors both for him to call
her and for her to hear the children</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">at night when she had to go help him with watever he may
need...Well one night (this was long </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">after my dream) she was downstairs with doctor and it was
late...My daughter was spending</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the night, when she had left the chilren were sound asleep
for hours...She heard toys going off</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and sounds like the children may be up on the monitor and
when she went upstairs to check</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">they were all sound asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My daughter had also sensed some strange things when there</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister has
long since moved and the doctor has passed away his daughter lives in </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the house now..I often want to stop and talk to her to see
if she has noticed anything strange </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">herself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Haunting Moments</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ladibugg35@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As a child we were told a lot of creepy things that
happened. We lived out in the country. There was a few houses around at the
time and we lived on a three and half acre farm. Us kids would go out in the
front and play ghost in the graveyard or sometimes we'd play truth or dare.
This one night, we were all holding hands sitting in a circle and we kept
hearing a noise saying coo coo and we thought it was just a owl. We asked my
brother truth or dare before he could say truth, a big black wing, we thought
it was a bat, swooped over us. We got up and screamed and looked up in the sky
and there was nothing around. So we thought it was just our imagination. We sat
back down and this thing swooped down again. At that moment we ran in the house
and realized there were bats outside. That was one of the spooky moments.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another time, i went to church and wanted to get my glory
on. After my sister dying of cancer, well let me take you back to her death.
She was in the hospital before this happened and he was taking keemo therapy
and radiation and she kept asking me if she was going to make it because she
didn't want to die. I told her that we all have to come to that day to just
pray. She kept smoking and I told her to stop smoking. That night, she had her
last cigarette. I was called at the hospital at <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12
 midnight</st1:time>. My sister was dying. I started praying in the emergency
room and she wasn't responding but I could feel her spirit was there and i was
talking to her. I said caroline hang on. I said if it's the will of god go with
him. I came back home because i needed sleep. She left me in charge on pulling
the cord or letting them do whatever they needed to help her.I came home and
fell asleep. Something was tapping at my window. I woke up and my sisters face was
staring at me in t window. She kept telling me to come to the hospital and i
said no that i couldn't. I got up and went to the bathroom. I kept smelling
cigarette smoke as i sat there on the toilet. There stood my sister in the
hallway smoking and she kept looking at me. I said no this can't be. I went to
lay down i went to pull the cover up and something pulled the cover down.
Something was telling me to come to the hospital. I started crying as i made my
way. I said lord I can't do this on my own. I need you to help me make the
right choice. Help her find her destiny. I went into the room and kissed her. I
said caroline it's time you help me make this descision, either you stay with
us or come home with the lord. 5 minutes later the heart monitor went dead. I
started crying because i knew she was gone. We burried her, made funeral
arragements. A few weeks later, i went to church. I was coming down the road. I
was happy and singing it was about 11 at night. It was so funny because the
light on the road, never takes forever to turn green. I stopped i felt a cold
black feeling come over me. I got chills on my arms. I looked to the passenger
side, and there sat my sister caroline. But it wasn't her, it was an evil
spirit form of her. I said i rebuke you in the name of jesus. The light still
wouldn't turn green, i looked around. I heard something on the side of my van.
I gave it the gas, i came down to my house and ran to my door and i heard
footprints behind me. I got to the door and my hand started shaking. I got in
and it was dark. I turned the hall light on and my heart was beating. I began
praying, i smelled smoke again. I looked in the kitchen and there stood my
sister laughing at me with dark evil eyes. SHe was laughing at me and it was
like her eyes were bleeding. And i told her to get out of my house. I went back
to bed, and i haven't seen her no more. Months has gone by and i go driving and
i look off into the golf course. I see my sister driving her cart smoking. It
took many months for that all to go away. TOday i l in my bed and night time
falls. I can't turn off my lights right away because there are dark spirits in
my house. Sometimes they walk by me and my hair stands up. I go to close the
curtains that closes off the living room and dining room and there's like hands
trying to reach through the curtains. I go into my room and my spirits can't be
me anymore. I rise up and i see them trying to get on me but they can't get me.
I don't wanna go to the bathroom at night so i try to hold it until morning
because i feel something is going to get me. I thought i was the only one
seeing these, thought i was going crazy. Maybe i was missing my sister. One
night, my oldest daughter went to the movies and my little 6 year old. SAid
mommy, don't turn off the lights. I asked why. She said i see people. I said
what kind of people do you see? She said their scary momma. They're white
ghosts and their scary, their in our house momma. Just not in our room. WE kept
hearing things in the other room. The glass fell and broke, a cupboard slammed
and a hour later my husband and older daughter came home. we didn't see no
more. I know i'm not crazy. My 13 year old sees spirits. My oldest son is
scared to turn off his t.v. at night because he said there are good and bad spirits
in our house. The good ones out weigh the bad ones in the house. I know when my
husband is not in the bed with me i can't sleep. because i wake up in the
middle of the night with cold sweat. And someone is always standing by my bed
looking at me. When i turn on the light, there's nobody there. I really don't
know what is happening over the years. But i know there's a lot of spirts out
there. I know i'm not crazy. The devil is a powerful person but not as powerful
as god and as long as i believe in the lord i have nothing that can harm me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I am 22 years old and
have had a few run-ins with ghosts or what I believe to be ghosts...anyways I
live in Gainesville,Florida and have since i was 3 years old...After basic
training I moved to Parkersburg, WV for a change of scenery and my best friend
at the time was living there so I thought it would be good for me. Anyways a
few days after being there I met my future ex-wife...I stayed with her at her
mothers house for about a week or so and couldn't stay there anymore...the
scary thing that set me off was actually my first ghostly happening...I came to
her work &lt;she was a bartender&gt; and told her i was going to go home and
take a nap til she got off..well I got home and layed on the couch and turned
on the t.v..I dosed off for maybe 20 mins or so and was woken up to the radio
being on full blast and as I looked around i noticed the remotes that I had
laid in on my chest..were on the coffee table in a line..I looked over at the
front door and the front door was wide opened and the screen door was opening
and slamming closed...after gathering myself and about creating a bowel
movement in my pants I put my shoes back on and sprinted towards the door and
as soon as I got to the stairs I froze and became ice cold and was absolutely
terrifed..after about what felt like 10 mins staring at the steps I ran back
outside and headed towards the bar where she worked...I told her what happens
and she had told me that "David" must have been messing with me and
she told me the reason why I froze at the stairs must have been cause that is
where she sees him most of the time...I was always kinda scared to be alone
after that in that house....I had more expierences in WV but wont take up to much
time telling them..I will move on to the recent ones...I have been in my
apartment going on 2 months now and I day i moved in I have heard strange
noises coming from upstairs...like the cabinet doors in the bathrooms opening
and closing..I also hear like a child running back and forth between the
rooms..I have a 2 Bedroom 2 1/2 bathroom townhouse...one day i came home from
work and I ALWAYS shut everything off all lights...t.v...radio...even the
a/c..I cant afford a high electric bill....I came home form work around 10 at
night like usual to all the lights being on my tv and my radio was
playing....The most recent happening was about 3 days ago..I invited my sister
and her boyfriend to my apt to eat and watch some movies...During the movie we
kept hearing the usual noises that I explained earlier and then all of a sudden
my t.v. shut off and it was pitch black in apt and I heard my sister scream and
after I went and turned on the light he was crying hysterically and when I
asked her whats wrong...she yelled at me asking why I shut off the t.v. and
tried to scare her by blowing in her ear...After I convinced her that it wasn't
me cause I was on the other couch and we were seperated by a table and the ear
that was blown in was facing the wall away form her boyfriend...after she
calmed down I felt a finger go across my neck...it felt the same way as if you
move your finger over from one side of your neck to the other as if you are
gesturing someone that you are going to kill them.....that really freaked me
out and I grabbed my cigerettes and headed towards the door...that was the
first time I was ever touched by anything...It wasn't the greatest....I haven't
ever really been comfortable in my appt and definetly not now....could you give
me some suggestions or comments and tell me what to do??? I talked to the owner
of the appt...its one of my close friends and asked about the history of the
place..he said he had no clue what or if anything happened...</p>

itself has been around since the 1860's you can hear the stories from any
employee and as a matter of fact the big man in charge now Mr. Jerry Brick will
not go into the ballroom by himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
back to me well i was a ride control operator<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>in the deep south section of the park.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one night after shutting down the skyride i had a cigarette in between
the skyride and thunder river rapids<span style="">&nbsp; </span>u
see there is a bridge in between the two rides that the public can not see,
anyway i was going to but my cigarette out when i felt a tug on the back of my
shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first i thought it was one of
the maintenance guys becasue they always tried to scare us however i turned to
find no one around me so i quickly tried to put my cigarette out again and this
time the tug nearly pulled me off my feet needless to say i never shut that
particular ride down again by myself</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I came across your site dong some personal research to
quench some spur of the moment curiosity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I decided to look into some of the areas in <st1:State><st1:place>south
  dakota</st1:place></st1:State> that were haunted, as I grew up there, and am
a fan of local lore, myths and haunts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
read you're section on O'Brian's Pub (Which actually is the same as Rushmore
brewery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was changed to Rushmore
Brewery when new owners took over the buisiness.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway back to my origonall point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a job there the summer before my 8th
grade year, as a dish-washer/bus boy, and i often worked the late shift as it
was more natural for me to be up during the late hours of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>O'Brian's was devided into two parts. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The bottom floor was the pub its self, and te top floor was
a fine dining section called "Reflections Diner".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pub closed down at 11 while reflections
closed at <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9 pm</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Reflections closed the dish washers had
to go up and roll silver ware and put it away in that part of the
establishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everytime I went up there
I would always hear<span style="">&nbsp; </span>silverware being
thrown to the ground, knowing full well that My freind and I were the only two
living souls on that level of the building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As much as we hated giong up there, some nights we'd go up when we
didn't have any work to do and just wait and listen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We walke all over that top floor,except one
area in a corner of the room that always invoked the largest amount of fear
from us when we approached it, and we could never find the silverware that had </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">made the noise.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
know this may not be very interesting, however, reading </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">through your site brought back some memories, and I felt like
sharing that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Oh! also one update on another haunt in <st1:place><st1:City>Hill

<p class="MsoNormal">A friend of mine has a house down on Pease av. Well there
house is huge! There house is 4 storys and it is around 105 years old. Built
before world war 1. And my friends mom was baking cookies. and know one was in
the house with her because her husband was at work, and the kids were at
school. So anyway, Shes standing in the linvingroom watching tv</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">waiting for the cookies to be done. when she accedently
forgot about them. Do they started to burn. So she ran through the
dinningroom... ( also they have this really big miror thats been passed down
through the family for years) well anyway, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">as she ran passed it, she thought she saw something. She
walked back and looked in the mirror, when she saw this dark shadowything, all
hunched over. Sortof like the grimreaper. Well as shes froze there, she turns
around slowly ( to see if she could feel anything) when it was GONE!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Theres also alittle girl that died in the
lundryroom from a bad sickness. And she likes to play with change ( money). So
whenever you go in there, she throws them at you. Trust me, I have wittnessed
it. There dogs spazz out all the time. They get locked in the basement and in
the attic. Which also, is the spookiest place in there house! You can here
things and defentily feel things and see things. Her son talks to alot of the
spirits. and if you stay the night there, you will see thinhs you could never
imagine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My dear mother passed away on <st1:date year="2004" day="3" month="6">3 June 2004</st1:date>, after a long and brave battle with breast
cancer. Apart from a couple of dreams just before and after she passed on there
have been a couple of incidents that I find hard to explain.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was lying in bed in the early hours of the morning at my
father's home reading a book, and I'd allowed my left arm to fall out of bed. A
few minutes later I had the distinct impression of someone lighly grasping the
tips of my fingers, like Mam used to do long ago. I know I didn't have pins and
needles, nor was I dreaking, I was wide awake. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A month or so ago I was again reading late at night (this
time in my flat in London) feeling a bit down about my mother's death, as I
still do on occasions. I thought to myself "I wish you could let me know
you're still around, Mam. I really miss you". Not two seconds later the
bulb in my bedside light went out, not quickly, but slowly getting dimmer and
dimmer until the light disappeared. Needless to say I was shocked at this, and
I laid in the dark for a couple of minutes, but thanked my Mam and said that I
hoped I would find another bulb, which I did.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">These two incidents gave me a lot of comfort. I often wonder
whether she's still around. I sense she's resting in peace, but likes to keep
watch on me and Dad, who lives away from me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My ex wife used to tell me about her "guardian
angel" who used to follow her around when she was a child. She would tell
me about a man she would see at night and stand there and smile and disappear.
I've seen and heard unusual things before, so I naturally listened with
earnest.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have three instances that I personally witnessed and would
like to tell you about them.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She lived in an apartment above her parent's house. The night
before we were married I was allowed to sleep on the fold out couch in her
apartment. She had a cat, and the cat and I just didn't get along. I'm a dog
person, and the cat never let me get close to it. About <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00</st1:time> in the morning, I woke up hearing moans and screams.
A blast of cold air was coming in through the windows, and the curtains stood
out straight away from the wall. I could see my breathe when I exhaled it was
so cold. I even heard the shake and rattle of chains along the moans. The cat
was so scared, it jumped under the covers with me. It felt like it was freezing
inside the house it was so cold. Mind you, this was the middle of August in
1980 when they were having the longest streak of 100+ degrees temperature to
date. I didn't know what else to do, so I hid under the covers with the cat.
Twenty minutes later, the moans and the sound of chains disappeared, and the
rest of the night went without any more incidents.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next day, I told my fianc&eacute;e about what had happened. Of
course, she was interested. We eventually went through the day's activities of
getting married, and adjourned for the evening that night again at her
apartment, but this time I was in her bedroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Her bedroom door had louvers in the middle, so you can see
who's on the other side of the door. My wife noticed her cat staring through
the louvers watching something on the other side of the door. She told me to
look at the cat. I did, and I could see a pair of man's shoes standing on the
other side of the door, with pants extending up, just like someone was standing
there, but about eight inches off the floor, the pants ended, there was just
empty air further up. I got out of bed to investigate, and the shoes
disappeared.... just moments before I reached the door. Nothing there. At least
there weren't any screams this time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The last incident took place about a year later in our own
apartment. She was primping her hair, getting ready for bed, and smoking her
cigarette. She stopped for a moment, and asked, "Honey, did you see my
cigarette?" "No, last I saw it you put it in the ashtray."
"Well, help me find it. We don't want any burn marks in the carpet."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We looked. And we looked. We looked all over the floor, the
bathroom, the closet, and of course, the ashtray. We looked for ten minutes.
There was simply no place for it to go. We shrugged our shoulders, she lit
another cigarette, put it in the ashtray, moved her hand away, and the original
cigarette appeared, still lit, and the smoke starting to float upwards, along
with the second cigarette.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I saw it appear; I didn't blink. One second it was gone, the
next it just appeared. We both saw it happen. I looked at the ashtray when it
was gone, and it wasn't there. It appeared in the same slot she had put it in.
It just appeared. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We figured her ghost was just playing a game with us.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am 12 years old and strongly believe in ghost. My mom
lives in a haunted house. You may think im crazy but I speak to the ghosts.
There is a man, a woman, a young boy, and a baby girl. My mom and everyone that
enters the house believes me. Here are some things that have happened to me and
my family. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was little I went down stairs to get the kitten food
and saw a little boy in a blue bathrobe petting my dog through the cage. The
dog was rubbing his face against the cage as if they were petting him. Also, I
know how they all died. The man shot the women then shot himself and the boy
jumped from the balcony. The little girl (she&#8217;s about two.) climbed onto the
balcony to see her brother and looked over the edge falling to her death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lot more has happened but the most recent
ones are&#8230; My mom and older sister were in the basement and heard what they
thought at the time was me calling for my mom. Only I wasn&#8217;t there and they
figure it was the ghost boy. And I have a two year old sister and when my mom
was in the hallway she says she felt my sister grab her hand but, when she
looked down she wasn&#8217;t there and my sister was asleep in her room with the door
shut. Also, when my sister was a little baby my mom had her cradle at the foot
of her bed and she said that the cradle was rocking as if someone was rocking
it and she heard a woman faintly singing a sweet lullaby. Lights always go on
and off along with the t.v. and stereo, there always is some thing that goes
missing and we find in plain sight later and there are always footsteps going
up and down the stairs and down the hallways. We often hear children laughing
and playing and ALWAYS have the feeling of their presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom says when I was little I would play
with a little boy in the house when I was alone turns out my imaginary friend
was a ghost!!! The ghosts are scary but never have hurt us in a physical way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">(By the way, on the state-by-state listing on this site,
this place is mentioned: The Brea-Olinda High School Performing Arts Center.)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was in the school musical my freshman year, and my
experience was limited in both performing and the supernatural. Oh, sure, I had
hard the rumors about the PAC being haunted and the cold spots in the dressing
rooms, but I didn't exactly buy into it because the person who told me the
stories was a girl who was prone to lying about some things. So I just blew it
off and didn't think anything of it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We had been practicing in the auditorium for about a month
and I hadn't felt uneasy, scared or even picked up the vibe of being watched.
In fact, I had been in there on my own a few times, too, and even then I felt
right at home, despite my normal creeped-out feeling of being in a strange
place by myself. I was convinced that there was no haunting taking place due to
my lack of normal premonition about those things......if I don't include the
odd shudders I would get in the middle of doing something, the eerie gentle
pulls on my long hair, and my neck feeling prickly when sitting backstage, but
I get that everywhere I go. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didn't believe that there was anything there until our
last performance. I was sitting backstage left on the couch someone had put
there when I looked to the door to the stage hallway. (There is a hallway that
runs the length of the stage and backstage areas for the choir and band
performers when there is a concert.) The door had opened and I had looked up to
see who was entering, but it was held open a little as if the person was
talking to someone down the hall. The odd thing was that I didn't hear any
voices coming through, and there was no really loud noise to obscure the sound
that should have been coming from the door that was only a few feet away. The
door opened wider, then closed a little, the opened, then finally fully closed.
I saw no ones hands holding that door open, and to this day I stand by what the
girl sitting next to me said when she saw the door: </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"Didn't you know the PAC is haunted?"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've been told that sometimes the choir members will hear
piano playing coming from the PAC only to find that there is no one there, and
the music will stop when someone goes to investigate. While it is eerie on so
many levels...I am definitely going to continue performing there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that's my story, and i'd love to see it posted!! please
email me back when you post it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and my one request is that my email adress not be put up--
instead, please put up the adress hmdarkprincess@hauntedmansion.com. it IS a
real adress, don't worry, but it's just not my main adress.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">EXPERIENCES GOOD AND BAD</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: pink_songbird@shaw.ca</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been reading all these amazing stories and I find
myself willing to tell a story of my own. Like so many others, the paranormal
seems to follow me wherever I go. It all started when I was just an infant and
my parents had rented a house on the West Side of Edmonton. I can still vividly
see the house and each room is still etched into my mind. The upstairs
contained two bedrooms; both had slanted ceilings and small windows. My room
was the only room with a door that would lead to the attic, where my parents
would often find me playing. My mom used to say that she felt such peace when she
would go upstairs and my brother and me would play endlessly.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At night my parents could hear me talking to myself and
would just laugh it off. As I got older I still continued to "talk to
myself" and one day, my Grandfather even asked me who I was talking to. I
replied, "to the man in my room." Everyone was quite taken aback and
a little unsure, but it continued. I vaguely remember him. All I remember is
the comforting feeling I had when he was around. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, this was not the only thing to ever happen to me.
It was always a common occurrence for someone in our family to sea loved one
who had passed away, still making dinner when they came home, or hearing chains
dragging in the hallways. I always saw bright, white apparitions of light
around me and someone sitting on my bed. I was never afraid, but I was always
(and still am) remarkably interested.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am very fortunate. I have had only one disturbing
ghost/poltergeist experience. I was staying at my grandmother&#8217;s with my cousin
who lived there. I ended up staying in the side room where my grandmother
slept. I had a good sleep when I was awakened by someone sitting on my bed. I
thought it was my cousin coming to wake me up. Of course, there was no one
there. I was suddenly slammed down into the bed and something covered my whole
body and face. I could not scream or even utter a sound. It then made violent
licking sounds in my ear. It released me and it was sometime before I was able
to get up. I told the story to my cousin and my grandmother. They both laughed,
but they believed me. My grandmother said nothing ever bothered her in there.
My cousin&#8217;s brother, who also stays in that room from time to time, has had the
same thing happen to him. To this day, I refuse to go into that room or even be
left in the house alone!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It&#8217;s nice to know that you really aren&#8217;t going crazy and
that many others experience similar things that you have.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I do, however, will continue reading everyone else&#8217;s
stories. I am truly enjoying them!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This house is in <st1:City><st1:place>Omaha</st1:place></st1:City>,
Douglas County, Nebraska and was built in I believe 1955.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In 1989 I purchased this property and lived in this
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sold the property and moved in
1997.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in this house with my son and our Golden Retriever
"GINGER" - who made a point of lying on the floor, next to my son's
bed, when he went to his room every single night!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This house has three bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we occupied this house, the
"Smallest Bedroom" has what we referred to as the "Dog
Door" - that conveniently led to our back yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time I purchased this property, there
was no other door (except this Dog Door) leading to the back yard.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was told by the old man I purchased the property from -
(who was 91 years of age in 1989) - That two (2) unmarried Sisters (who may
have been the first owners of this property) are the ones who installed this
"Dog Door" in the "Small Bedroom" for their dog or dogs -
that led into the back yard.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On dozens of unexpected nights while we were sleeping, our
dog "GINGER" could be found in the hall and at the door of this
"Small Bedroom" WHINING... and became loud enough to wake both my son
and I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Too many times, my son and I
would both be coming out of our bedrooms at the same time and could also hear
scratching within the walls of this "Small Bedroom."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After speaking with other people who voiced their opinion
about having "Something" living in their homes, on occasion, when my
son "was not at home" I told this Entity or Spirit that
"IT" would have to remain quiet if it stayed, otherwise leave -
because it was frightening my Son and our Dog and is no longer welcome in our
home!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never went so<span style="">&nbsp; </span>far to sprinkle "Salt" around our
house as others suggested and have done, but I did place a cross on the wall
and other Religious artifacts in this Small Bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My son did became so alarmed and frightened at the noise in
the walls of this "Small Bedroom" that I called Nebraska Pest
Control, among other companies, to come and inspect the house for
"Pests" that may be crawling and scratching within the walls of our
home and particularly this "Small Bedroom!"<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">NOTHING WAS EVER FOUND IN THE ATTIC AREA, OR WITHIN THE
WALLS OF ANY BEDROOM OR IN THIS HOUSE TO INDICATE ANY "PESTS" OF ANY
KIND!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My son and I both instinctively knew soon after we moved
into this house that NOTHING WOULD BE FOUND...because "WE COULD FEEL a
PRESENCE" as our Dog "GINGER" did!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In fact, my son was so spooked by "GINGER'S"
whining behavior and the sounds coming from that Small Bedroom during the
night, that my son refused to nap or fall asleep in that house until I came
home!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now the year is 2005.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Looking back at the time we lived in this house, my son and
I know a "SPIRIT OF SORTS"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that was not so "APPARENT" to "Us and We Could Not
See" - was obviously "APPARENT" to our Dog GINGER!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My son and I came to the conclusion that our Dog GINGER
"COULD SEE THIS ENTITY or SPIRIT" - And... that GINGER "COULD
FEEL IT'S PRESENCE" (as we often did)!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Prior to 1989, we can only assume that a person or pet
probably died in the room of that "Small Bedroom" and still lives on
in this particular house!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From the time we moved into this house in 1989, we NEVER
used "This Small Bedroom" as a Sleeping Room, and there was NEVER any
activity of any kind coming from this room during Daylight hours!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">AMAZING FOR MY SON AND I, THAT THE ONLY DIRECT CONNECTION WE
HAD WITH THIS ENTITY or SPIRIT - WAS THROUGH OUR DOG - GINGER'S BEHAVIOR... WHO
PROVED NOT ONLY TO BE A VERY GENTLE, LOVING and FRIENDLY DOG (prior to and
after 1989), BUT BECAME AN EXTREMELY INSTINCTIVE and FIERCELY PROTECTIVE DOG
FOR US (after we moved in and lived at <st1:address><st1:Street>4680 Vinton
  Street</st1:Street>, <st1:City>Omaha</st1:City>, <st1:State>Nebraska</st1:State></st1:address>)!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I realize our "Encounter" is not so shocking...But
it is TRUE!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My uncle passed away in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>
about 18 months ago. He was a real character. He enjoyed blowing a whistle and
yelling &#8220;Everybody in the pool!&#8221; at our summer place, then he did it for years
afterward even if there was no pool around, just to get a rise out of people. I
planned to pick up a whistle and yell his favorite line at the funeral, but I
had pretty much forgotten about doing it until the night before we buried him.
NOBODY knew of my plan. So, the night before, my mother comes walking up to me
the wicker basket from the kitchen, kind of a &#8220;catch-all&#8221; for various things.
She asks me &#8220;Is this yours?&#8221; and on the top of the basket is a big old plastic
whistle&#8212;which NONE of us had ever seen in our house before. My uncle lived in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>,
so it wasn&#8217;t his! I don&#8217;t even know why she came up to me with the junk
basket&#8212;she looked like she was in kind of a daze, with a blank stare on her
face! I wasn&#8217;t even sure if she was asking me about the whistle or another item
in the basket! So at the funeral, I totally forgot about the whistle in the
car. The graveside service was finished and as I was about to drive away I
remembered the whistle in the center compartment, ran out and blew it--I yelled
his famous line and threw it in the grave. His wife, my Aunt Barbara saw me do
this from the car and gave me a big nod of approval. I take this is a communication
from my uncle&#8230;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Barbara, his wife, just passed away about two weeks ago. So
last week was her funeral in NY. The clouds broke 2 minutes before the
graveside service and sun came shining through, which her daughter predicted
would happen 20 minutes before(nice). So after the graveside service, we&#8217;re
about to leave and her car is completely dead. A late model Nissan with no
maintenance problems just dies there. My cousin (her daughter) said that her
mother was trying to keep her there. I think she was playing a joke on her
son-in-law, as we all left him there to get a tow truck! Although she wasn&#8217;t a
practical joker in life, I think my aunt<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>finally lightened up and did something funny for once&#8212;and who better to
play a joke on but the son-in-law!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So two nights later, I&#8217;m feeling like maybe I can ask for a
&#8220;message from beyond&#8221; and see if she is ok over there. I&#8217;m not teary-eyed or
upset or desperate or anything. I&#8217;m in my bed, really calm and receptive, just
trying to commune with my aunt. All of a sudden, my whole body goes gooseflesh
and I feel the tremendous energy pulsating through my body. Wave after wave of
energy making my skin feel electric! I felt all of my close family who passed
on around me in this tremendous, positive energy field. I got the message that
everything is fine&#8212;not verbally, but possibly telepathically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It actually was hard to stop this incredible
pulsating field of electrical/magnetic energy it, as I had to tell them I had
to rest and go to sleep. I thanked them for coming through to me and tried to
come down from this energy surge/communication. It wasn&#8217;t easy to do! I&#8217;m not a
complete believer in the afterlife or psychic communication with the dead, but
this experience was too strong to ignore.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also, my grandmother who passed in 1976 seems to stick
around the baby grand piano she used to play(now in our house). She was a
concert-level pianist. Strange thing is I feel a powerful energy at times near
the piano. Now I know that items that meant something to the person who passed
over tend to have a lot of significance to those who survive, but it&#8217;s not like
I get nostalgic or weepy when I approach the piano. I don&#8217;t expect anything
weird to happen as I pass by it. I was eight when she passed on, and she was a
very dear person in our lives. It&#8217;s a very positive energy field, and as a 37
year old man I must say that being near it is quite extraordinary. Sometimes I
feel the energy, sometimes not. I feel it only if I am calm and and in an open
minded state. Really cool to know that literally her spirit lives on&#8230;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyhow, I was hoping you might be able to shed some light on
these experiences. I enjoyed writing about them. Also I feel a bit strange for
publicizing them as well. Thanks for providing the venue!</p>

</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The story I'm telling
is true. Around Christmas of 2004 when I was 13 , I visited my great
grandparents,who lived on a farm near the woods.They're dog,Freckles, had died
a couple of months before.They then had bought a new dog,Spot but this one had
black spots instead of brown,like the old one.We had spent a few hours there,it
had gotten a little dark, but I had decided to walk down to the woods
anyway.So, me and the dog walked down there,the dog was as hyper as he could
be.While walking down there I saw a white dog with big brown spots. Then,spot,
ran down and played with what I thought was a stray.Anyway I thought nothing of
it,so I kept walking down to the woods without Spot. As I was walking I started
to realize that the stray looked exactly like Freckles.Then it dawned on me how
long Spot had been gone, so I called him and when he didn't answer I ran back
and told them that Spot was playing with the ghost of Freckles.So my grandma
went and looked.She brought back Spot but didn't see anything else. I never saw
the dog agian.But to this day I can't help but wonder whether it was a dog....
or an old friend.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Man On the Bicycle</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: SwtKatie169@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have always been very interested in paranormal activity
and ghosts and what not, especially at my curious age of 17! I have always sort
of believed in the back of my mind that ghosts are real even though so many
people don't believe in it. One night about 3 months after I got my license, I
became a full-on believer in ghosts. I live in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and I live near several areas of land that used to be old slave plantations way
back in the day. It was about <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10pm</st1:time> on
a Friday night in August and I was driving with my then boyfriend up the road
to get something to eat. Along the way I saw this old looking man on a bicycle
and he was wearing an old ragged hat that covered the upper most part of his
head and a big, thick button-down petticoat and long, baggy pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was really strange to see a person with
that much clothing on in the hot Georgia weather in August, but I thought it
was just some homeless man and when I went to turn the bend which would put him
out of site, he looked at me right in my eyes and it gave me the creepiest
feeling ever. I could tell this man was Asian, whether that was important or
not I still don't know. Literally a minute down the road I realized that I had
forgotten my purse at my house which we were coming from so I turned down this
narrow dirt road in the back of my community to go back home real quick. It was
really dark on this road and there was only one street light and it was in
front of one of the old slave plantations about a mile from my house. So I had
just turned down this road and all of a sudden I see the Asian man on the
bicycle under the street light in front of Rice Mill Plantation, the old slave
land. At first I didn't really think much of it because I was in a hurry to get
back home. I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the street light get dimmer
and dimmer and it was just the weirdest thing to me. The creepy part was that
the man was just standing there under the street light staring us down. When I
looked through to rear view mirror he was watching us drive away as the light
went out. I thought it was just some delusional old man. After I got back to my
house I started thinking about it and realized that there was absolutely no
possible way that the man on the bike could have made it from the end of my
neighborhood to a mile down the road under some street light in a minute or
less. The driving took like a minute and 30 seconds for me to see the man for
the first time, turn around to get my purse and see him standing under a street
light that was a mile away from where I had literally just seen him that short
time ago. There was no possible way he could have traveled that far on his bike
in that short amount of time. I told my mom about it and she told me that it
was probably a ghost. Ever since that night, I have believed that there really
are ghosts out there and that even non-believers can see them!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Saved by My Guardian Angel</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: MsZinaK@msn.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I want to relate this story while it is clear in my head. I
was going to NJ from VA to visit family last Thursday, June 16. I am alone
driving my red sports car. I am in the middle lane<span style="">&nbsp; </span>going at least 65 mph keeping up with the
traffic in front of me. I am driving with my mind on automatic because I have
made this trip so many times. My mind is wandering at the moment, concentrating
on the music and to seeing my friends and family again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly my eye catches a truck to my left
coming into my lane and cutting me off and I knew she was going to hit me with
her big truck. My little sports car suddenly moved the the right<span style="">&nbsp; </span>lane without me steering it. My hands were
still driving straight ahead it was as if my car was pushed over so quickly to
the right lane and then back to the middle lane because if I had stayed on the
right lane I could have been hit by another car coming behind on the right
lane. It felt like the wheels had been elevated slightly in order to make such
a quick instant move over to the far right lane and back to the center. The
driver of the truck moved back to her left lane after she saw me. I had such an
adrenaline rush from the fear that I was shaking for a while. I was not paying
full attention to the road and yet in an instant my car got out of her way and
I swear I did not turn the steering wheel, it was as if someone else did it for
me and saved me from a bad car accident or even saved my life as I was in a
little car and the other driver drove a truck. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I truly believe this was my guardian angel. I feel like I
know my guardian angel because sometimes I hear this voice calling my name. The
voice sounds almost like an echo in my head<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and talks very fast and he or she uses my nick name all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voice sounds neither male or female.
Sometimes the voice awakens me in my sleep. One time it said to me. "It's
an emergency." </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For instance, I cannot find something and look in vain. Then
when I stop looking for it suddenly it gets presented in front of me in an
obvious spot that I wonder why did I miss it there. Its usually little things
that I can't prove and only I know</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">about them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before my
trip, some things were moved in my bathroom from a high shelf and placed side
by side on my bathtub mantle. I think someone is trying to show me that they
are there. Only my husband and I live in our house and he says he definetly
didn't move those articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not
trying to prove something one way or another, it's just what I believe to have
happening to me. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Amanda I'm 15 years old and I live in Big lake
Alaska. Last year my uncle passed away after a life of heavy drinking and
smoking I never really knew him very well he lived in Sitka Alaska next door to
my grandparents and my grandfather (his dad) kind of watched over him because
he had some mental issues due to his heavy drinking. He was found sitting
upright in his airstream holding an inhaler in his hand. No one know for sure
what he died of he was only 56 years old. abotu a week after his passing I was
in my room just thinking about him when I suddenly got the feeling to walk to
my window so I did and I looked out and there he was I could barly see him it
was ass if he was part of the air and i couldent reallt see his face but I knew
it was him because an overwhelming feeling of security came over me and he
didnt speak but I knew that I was suposed to tell my dad my grandpa and my
other uncle goodbye for him.Why he came to me I don't know I didn't know him
very well infact he kind of scared me because he was not well kept and looked
very creepy and i knew he was not all there mentaly. I belive that he came to
me because I have seen apparitions in the past and I belive that such contact
was possible though I do not know why he did not contact my father instead who
also has seen apparitions in the past and belives. I guess I will never know</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi there. After reading all of these stories I finally
realised that I had an encounter too. I always thought that ghostly encounters
were supposed to be frightening ordeals, but the one that I had was actually
very pleasant and reassuring..</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">7 years ago my aunt who lived in <st1:place><st1:City>Brooklyn</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>New York</st1:State></st1:place>, died from cancer. I did not
attend the funeral then, because I had a very important year at school and we
lived (and still do) in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Netherlands</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
so it would take too much time. My parents went and I wrote my ti&aacute; (spanish for
aunt, that's what we would call all my aunts) a letter saying goodbye. After
that we still visited the house, but nothing ever really happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A couple of years ago we visited my other aunt who still
lives in the house. Maybe I should explain first the floorplan of the house
(this becomes important later on in the story): on the first floor lives my
oldest aunt, on the second floor is the bedroom of my aunt who lives downstairs
and then on the 3rd floor is where my passed aunt used to live. On the topfloor
is where the guests (in this case, me, my parents and my cousin [who was never
there before]) stayed. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Back in the day when my ti&aacute; was still alive, she would cook
us very big meals, it didn't matter if it was breakfast, lunch or dinner, ti&aacute;
would always be in the kitchen, making sure that everything she cooked would be
just right (and a lot!). Needless to say that her floor and ours always smelled
of good soulfood. On this particular trip, our first morning there, we woke up
to the smell of a traditional "ti&aacute;-breakfast". At first we thought
that it was my other aunt from the first floor who was making us breakfast, but
when we came down, my other aunt didn't even wake up yet!! And downstairs it
did not smell of breakfast, the smell stopped at the third floor... My dad
never smelled it, but my mom and me truely believe that it was ti&aacute; who was just
saying "hi" and welcoming us back into her home, with a traditional
breakfast.. :)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I never had any other encounters and to be truthful I hope I
never do, unless it is one like this.. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We recently moved into a home that was constructed in the
early 1900's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the first day of
moving in I knew the house was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a few weeks I started sensing our little ghost more often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started seeing a little girl in a blue
dress around 8-9 years old in my head &amp; the name Sarah has also stuck in my
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, after a while my daughter
would hear footsteps in the hallway &amp; the occasional door slam when no one
else was home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little background on my
daughter. She will be 12 next month &amp; when I was pregnant with her I had a
lot of strange occurances happen to me that made me know she was going to be
special.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen ghost &amp; felt
their presence all my life, I am 36 now, and I knew that my children would be
the same way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And they are. Both my kids
feel presences &amp; hear spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Back
to my story, just recently my daughter has started having dreams that come
true, the same as me when I was her age.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told me a few days ago that she dreamed of a little girl in a blue
dress that was about 3 feet tall &amp; my daughter stated the girl told her
that her name was Sarah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mind you I have
been really careful when talking to my daughter about her gift because she is
not real fond of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when she told me
about her dream I let her know that Sarah is our ghost &amp; now she knows what
she looks like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sarah has been really
quiet for the past few months &amp; I recently spoke to a friend that also
senses &amp; sees spirits &amp; he informed me that our little Sarah is content
because she feels she has a friend in my daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two days ago I was doing some cleaning &amp;
had two of my daughters braclets on my make up desk. I picked both up with the
intention of taking them to my daughters room &amp; instead placed them back on
my desk to do something else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well when
I went back to get the braclets only 1 was left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think Sarah liked the green one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my daughter what happened when I took
the 1 braclet (orange) that was left to her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said Sarah can keep it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
just laughed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am interested in seeing
where it is going to show up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, that
is it for now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am sure there will be
more stories to come.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Growing up, I was raised in a strict Christian home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never believed in ghosts because I was
taught they didn't exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived in a
100+ year old home and I had never experienced anything out of the
ordinary...until I married my husband.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had grown up believing/seeing ghosts along with his whole family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We talked about it only a few times but it
wasn't until we moved into our new house together that I became a
believer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a small 2 story, 100
year old house that we had bought from a family who had lived there for over 20
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after moving in all the
smoke detectors' batteries went low.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of changing them, we just took the batteries out and threw the
detectors in the pantry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few nights
later as we were watching TV in the other room, we heard a loud strange
screeching noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We assumed it was
coming from outside, but decided to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we entered the kitchen, we realized that
the noise wasn't coming from outside, but from inside the pantry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I opened the door I found the smoke
detector was making the noise...with no batteries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although this freaked me out, I wasn't
convinced it was a ghost just yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night while laying bed I woke up for some reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was laying there I heard a noise at both
windows on either side of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded
like someone was throwing stones at the windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A minute or so later it felt like someone was
at the foot of our bed and nudged it with their leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't my husband, because he was sound
asleep next to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I still was
not a believer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on in the year our
carbon monoxide detector's batteries were going low.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This also happened in the middle of the night
with my husband sound asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It woke me
up with the loud beep (you all know what I'm talking about) and I woke my
husband up to tell him, remembering what happened with the smoke detector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me to take it down and take out the
batteries, so I waited for the next beep before getting up (so it wouldn't beep
in my ear, this happened about every 60 seconds or so) and just before I
touched it, it beeped again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
freaked me out so bad, I couldn't sleep the rest of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around this time is when I started realizing
that these weren't just coincidences, but it wasn't until Christmas Day that I
became a full fledge believer. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our house upstairs had an access door to the attic above our
kitchen (this was an addition to the house).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This door was about a 15" square hole on the side of the wall,
right by the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was framed by
wood that had a door that came completely off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It fit snugly in the hole, so there was nothing to hold it on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The night of Christmas Eve 2002 we were at my
in-laws' house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We spent the night and
when we returned in the morning, we found the door was off and set along side
of the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now mind you, I realize
that critters could get into the attic somehow, but I'm pretty sure that it
can't take the door off and neatly set it up against the wall next to the
hole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is when I became a firm
believer that there was more on earth than just us living beings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband was curious to know what had happened in the
house to cause these "hauntings", so he decided to do some research
at the local library.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked the woman
there if she could help him find out some things about a haunted house in
town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she didn't know much
about it, but she would get someone else to help him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the other lady saw him she told him that
she had already told him he needed to go to the courthouse to get some
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband told her he'd
never stepped foot in that library before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The woman looking a little startled told him that a guy that looked JUST
like him had been in there a few days earlier asking about the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband thanked her, and with that, we
decided we didn't want to know what had happened!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now, there are other things that have happened since then,
but nothing major.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have just moved
out and we decided to ask our neighbor if he had heard of anything unusual
happening in that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said no, but
that he grew up next door to the house and at some point a woman shot her
husband with a rifle in that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
now believe we have the answer to who the ghost was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were leaving, I said my goodbye to Mr.
Parks. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Childhood ghost memories. ...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had already mentioned my paternal grandparents house
stories. One I did forget to mention was that i had a cousin who when all of us
where hanging around in the house in front he took a glance at our house.
Something in the attic window caught his attention. He said he couldve sworn
that he saw someone there. When we looked up no one else saw anything. I knew
better. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Before they moved into the house i grew up more in they
lived directly across the street in a much nicer bigger house. Why they moved
into the smaller house is beyond me. Anyhow that house had alot of scary things
too. It always gave me the chills. The basement in that house was a no-go with
me. I was terrifed of going down there and it was always cold no matter whether
it was the height of the summer outside. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My maternal grandmas house was spooky as well. I didnt see
as much as felt it. My mom and her mom saw alot. They said they would go into
rooms and see pools of blood and then blink it was gone. My youngest moms
daughter was very young and we would walk into a room where there was no one
and say something like who are all those people? We would all give each other a
look and didnt say anything. This was also the house where i started suffering
from sleep paralysis. Its where you are awake and aware but cant move and you
usually feel someone is with you and may even be the cause of the not moving.
As i got older it happened less and less.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We recently moved into a home where the previous owner died
due to smoke inhalation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house has
been empty for 2 1/2 yrs, mostly due to this reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day we came and looked at the house my
husband and I walked in the front door and we both felt like we were home, I
physically felt like I had gotten hugged at the door, it felt good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we looked at the home, we both wanted
it so bad, then the realtor informed us of the old lady's passing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It didn't bother me, I didn't feel spooked or uncomfortable
at all neither did my husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew
the real test would be our children.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We got the home, moved in, and the kids loved it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not tell them of the previous owner's
death, and they still have not been spooked being alone downstairs or upstairs
by themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The owner died in the early morning hours, the neighbors
said she had kept strange hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had
lit a candle and thrown the match in the bathroom trash and stuck the can back
under the sink and closed the doors, it smoldered and when she went in to try
to put out what she thought was a fire it was too much for her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I did not have anything begin until we had been here for 2
weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pictures got moved from counters
to table tops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed to be just 1
particular family picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There have been
chairs in the basement that don't seem to want to stay pushed under the
table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Always turned out as if watching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one particular day the young gal that is
staying with us was having dinner with my children and I and we had been
talking about how we met our husbands and then suddenly something tugged at my
hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked around to see if the boys
were messing me, they were not around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't say anything to my guest, she did notice however that my head suddenly
went back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just shrugged it off, then
it happened again, after the third time my guest looked at me and stated
"she's here isn't she".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
believe at that point I was finally relieved that there was some actual
contact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really felt that she was
wanting to join us in our little chat.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A little spooked we got up and cleaned off the lunch stuff,
I had pushed all the chairs in and went into the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I returned there were 3 chairs pulled
out as if to invite us to sit with her!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So we did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't speak to
here but now we always pull the third chair out when we chat.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have had lots! of problems with keeping candles lit,
imagine that!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would light one and turn
to light another and go back and the first one would be out. Back and forth I
would go until I finally spoke out loud and told her " I promise, I will
not go off and leave one lit and I will be safe with them"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I no longer have trouble keeping candles lit.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I decided it was time to tell my husband what had been going
on, of course he laughed at me and told me I was loosing it
half-heartedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night we were lying
in bed watching a movie and the bed started shaking, you know like someone was
wiggling their foot with that nervous twitch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thought it was him so I nudged him and he asked me if I got my motor
started, Ha.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him it wasn't me and
that he was the one with the problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
wasn't him, we decided she was just letting him know she was for real.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We've had other little things, but mostly they just involve
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think maybe she was just so lonely
before that she is enjoying having another female companion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I understand her family didn't visit much.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is all for now, if I see anything or hear anything I'll
let you all know.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When i was a kid I saw alot of things. I used to think i was
crazy. My grandmothers would assure me i wasnt. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My paternal grandmother said that when she was a kid she
would see dead relatives like her own grandmother who had died even before she
was born. She said her visions were very real to her. She could smell and hear
them. She would go and describe who she saw to her mom and her mom would say
that looks like my mom or something like that and then would proceed to pray.
When she had my dad she almost died. She might alot of things these days at her
tender age of 70 something but she never skips a detail when it comes to her
life and death experience. She said she could she her body going out of her and
the efforts below her to bring her back and that only for a brief moment she
thought that my dad would be motherless and then just felt peace and she said
she heard a voice that said it wasnt her time and then she was back in her
body. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My great grandmother on my moms side had the sight as well.
I remember her pretty well because she died when i was 10 or 11. My mom says
that she would tell her things that scared her. She just knew things. When my
great grandmother died she sent what i have heard referred to as a emergency
call of the spirits i guess. Where there is a tradegy somewhere and the loved
one is sending out a beacon of love so to speak. My mom said she was awakened
in the middle of the night to only see her abuela floating at her bedside. She
called her mom and was told that her grandma almost died. My mom went to a
fortune teller of sorts and the lady told my mom that when abuela died she
would get all the she had. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mom tried to deny she could see anything when i was a
kid. She would try to ease my fears by telling me i was just seeing things when
she knew better. Everytime something bad was going to happen a woman would
appear to her. The lady wouldnt say anything but just appear. My mom had good
reason to be a little afraid though. When they lived out of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>
they lived on an island. They had maids and stuff and she had to let one of
them go. The following day she was shocked to find that there was her name
spelled backwards on a building. It sent chills down her spine. She would later
leave the country they lived in sick with something not even the doctors here
could figure out. Eventually she just got better. As my mom has gotten older
her 'visions' have gotten more cryptic. She says less but when she does we stop
and listen, just in case. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My kid has similar talents. I hear her talking and i dont
make a big deal out of it. I know her dad has similiar abilities. Living with
him could sometimes get spooky. I had all but ignored my kids abilities but its
my mom who pointed them out once when unknown to anyone my uncle finally passed
after a long time in a coma. Before anyone knew it my kid was giggling and
telling someone to stop teasing her. My mom understood the familiar phrase he
would tell her. My mom said they would hear people at the door and my kid would
say something but my mom would warn her its not who she thinks it is and to
stay away. My kid is much less verbal about it and doesnt freak out. Its as
normal to her as anything could be.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghostly Sobs</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have an interesting story to tell. I am part Puerto Rican,
and part Cuban. I used to spend a lot of time at my grandma's house in <st1:place>Puerto
 Rico</st1:place> through out my childhood. There was a legend connected to the
area where my grandma lived. This is the legend as it was told to me; A long
time ago a widowed woman and her only son lived in the area. The boy used to
love exploring the woods and caves. One day the boy left his home to go
exploring as he had done many times before. On this particular day a very
strong storm blew in while the boy was exploring. As the weather grew
progressively worse, the boy's mother became worried and decided to go out to
look for her son. Neither mother or son were seen again. Some people believe
that the boy died accidentally in one of the caves he loved to explore, and
that the mother came across her son's body and killed herself, for she loved
her son dearly. Anyway, the legend says that on bad stormy nights you can hear
the sounds of sobbing echoing through the area, as if it were coming from the
depths of a cave. As a child I never believed it. I thought it was just a scary
story told to pass the time, as my grandmother loved to tell ghost stories. One
night when I was about 8 years old, and visiting my grandmother a really bad
storm blew in. Every one was already in bed and I was trying to go to sleep. As
I lay in bed tossing and turning a noise caught my attention. I decided to lay
perfectly still to listen and try to figure out what it was. As I lay there
listening, I realized the sound I was hearing was sobbing. I thought some one
in the house was crying. But then i realized it could not be any one in the
house. You see, my grandmother's house had a tin roof and the walls of the
rooms did not reach the roof. So if anyone in the house would have made any
noise you would be able to hear it as if they were in the same room as you. But
the sobbing I heard sounded as if it where coming from outside the house, and
it was echoing, which is why I had a hard time figuring out what it was. Then I
remembered the story I had been told and I became really scared. I covered my
head with the pillow until I fell asleep. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Stories</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: shadowedlegacy@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In reading some of the stories about encounters on the
website I have decided to share two of mine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am a very open minded person and have a very strong beleif in the
supernatural I have had several encounters.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Figure In the Rain</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The earliest encounter I can remember was when I was eleven
years old I was spending the night with a friend in this two story house that
was around 100 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
sleeping in a bedroom on the second floor that had a large window that allowed
you to overlook the street and driveway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had been raining when I went to sleep around <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11pm</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both my
friend and I woke up in the middle of the night at the exact same time for no
apparent reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rain had increased
to the point its was pouring and since I love the rain I looked out the window
to see it, my friend joined me and we both looked out the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Standing half way between the street and the house in the
driveway was a man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was shrouded in
gray and was wearing a gray hat almost like a cowboy hat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a pale white face and dim eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stared thinking it was some crazy person
just standing outside until he looked up at us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Getting freaked out we both ducked out of view, five seconds later I
looked back out the window and he was gone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because there were no trees or bushes to hide behind in the near area
that it would take five seconds to get to the only expination was that he
vanished.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Glass Vase</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 14 years old my friend and I were sitting in her
house in the living room at <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1am</st1:time>
playing a video game.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was dead
quiet except for the quiet noise coming from the television from the game we
were playing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were startled by thier
pet cockatoo that suddenly began to squak as if someone was trying to kill it
then a loud crash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her parents came out
of their room as we got up and went to investigate the loud crash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The glass vase they had sitting on a shelf
had shattered sitting on the shelf.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing had struck it, it didnt fall off the shelf, it simply shattered
where it was.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm not sure how to go about writing my experiences, but
here it goes anyways...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been a believer in the paranormal, mainly ghosts and
UFOs, since I was about six years old, encouraged and supported by my
grandmother on my mother's side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never
really had any experiences at that age, except for feeling unexplained cold spots
and chills while walking the lower levels of a known to be haunted antique
store that my grandmother regularly took me to after I moved to California from
Sweden, as well as a vague apparition that showed up in a photograph of a
vanity mirror taken after my grandma won it in an auction a few years later
(the environment around it was checked, and there was nothing obvious that
could have caused it, and the camera's flash had not been on).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I experienced nothing else in the few years
following.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I am now sixteen in
age, and we have had some experiences in our house since my dad's father died
around half a year ago.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first experience happened only a few days after my
grandfather, who had been fighting with my father for a rather long time,
passed from cancer (I was fifteen at the time).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Around 2 in the morning, the approximate time that he had died, I heard
the phone ring, but went back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The next day after picking me up from school, my mother told me that an
unidentified young girl called us that night, asking for George. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>When my mum told the girl that she had the
wrong number, the girl replied, "No...where's George?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that, she hung up, however, mum heard
no dial tone or even the sound of someone hanging up a phone on the other
end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oddly enough, my grandfather's name
had been George, and even my father, a sceptic, had been creeped out that night
after being told what had happened right after the girl hung up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dad also now wakes up at night around the
same time that his father passed on a regular basis.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second experience, or actually experiences, have been
very recent, the past few weeks actually, in the short hallway that contains
our computer room, farther down, our laundrey room, and at the end, the doorway
to our garage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first was a sudden
coldness that mum experienced in the laundrey room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The door had been closed, the AC was off, and
there are no windows in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second happenings have been my and my father's computers turning on by
themselves, the first being mine turning on when I walked into the room, the
second being my father's when he walked into the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was on my own computer at the time his
turned on, and we just stared at each other, wondering what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked throught the entire computer, but
found no reason for it turning on automatically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly was last weekend when I had been home
alone, my younger sister and both parents attending a baton twirling
competition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had just taken the family
dog out, and was now bringing her back into the garage and approaching the door
to the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I leaned down to take
the dog's leash off, I heard the distinct sound of someone fumbling with the
doorknob to open it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking it was
someone from the family, even though I had not seen our SUV pulling up when I
was outside, I looked up to see who it was, only to see the door push open
inwards a few inches with nobody there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I checked inside to make sure and still saw no one, nor was anyone
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot explain how the door
opened, as it has a spring to close itself automatically and keepitself shut,
and I am 100% sure that that there was no wind and that it had slammed shut
when I left to take Skye, our dog, out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would also like to note that there is a box sitting on a shelf that my
dad brought home after his father's death right next to the garage door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This box contains my grandfather's valuables,
along with a tooth that might have been either his or his wife's (who passed
away herself about eight years ago), so I suspect that box, or possibly some of
the other posessions of my grandfather that are in the garage, to be the source
of these happenings.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I also have one other experience that may have something to
do with my dog, Falina, who passed of internal bleeding and liver failer on <st1:date year="2001" day="30" month="11">the thirtieth of November, 2001</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around the beggining of this year, I woke up
one night with a strange feeling. At the time, I was facing my wall, with the
door on my opposite side, where our hallway nightlight is visible and shines
into my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, I heard the
faint jingle of pet tags and something solid passed the night light in the
hall, casting a shadow on my wall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Looking to the end of my bed, I saw both of our cats sound asleep, and
our other dog, who was still a puppy when Falina died, was sleeping
outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, when I asked my mum the
next day if anyone had been out of bed, she said no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm still not sure if I imagined it, but
since my dog's ashes are next to my bed, and my room is located right above our
garage, where she died in my arms, I believe that she very well could still be
here with us.</p>
