<center><font face="Arrus BT"><font size=+3>Where to Find Ghosts</font></font>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT"><font size=+1>by Dave Juliano</font></font></b></center>
<b><font face="Arrus BT"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">This questions is often asked by the budding
ghost hunter, the curious and the concerned.&nbsp; Where are ghosts?&nbsp;
How do we locate them?&nbsp; Are there any near me?&nbsp;&nbsp; First I'll
cover some the basic</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">theories concerning the living and the dead
interacting.&nbsp; I believe that all people have the ability to see/sense
ghosts.&nbsp; Some of us are born sensitive, always seeing/sensing them.
Some are sensitive in certain locations like their home or other place
they are relaxed.&nbsp; Others are just in tune at the right time and show
sensitivity briefly.&nbsp; Having said that, I'll tell you now that spirits
can be anywhere.&nbsp; There isn't any place that you will not find them,
but the point of this article is to help you find them so there are places
that are more likely to have strong spirit activity.&nbsp; In location
of strong spirit activity, it is possible for the less sensitive to slowly
learn how to tune in.&nbsp; These are also the places where ghost investigators
or hunters will look since the odds are better that they will locate a
ghost or two.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT"><font color="#CCFFFF">Cemeteries</font> - The
age of the cemetery doesn't matter but the older it is, the more time it
has had to accumulate restless spirits.&nbsp; Why cemeteries?&nbsp; Well
there are theories such as they are portals to the other side or that some
spirits are drawn to their former bodies.&nbsp; Why did we pick that spot
to build a cemetery?&nbsp; American Indians looked for sacred ground to
bury the dead.&nbsp; Were the people who picked a location for a cemetery
drawn to a spot by other forces?&nbsp; There may be more at play here in
the cemetery than meets the eye.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT"><font color="#CCFFFF">Schools</font> - Schools
and former sites of schools may have the build up of psychic energies and&nbsp;
imprints of all the highly emotional events that have transpired there.&nbsp;
All the energy, hormones, etc. create a place where there is a surplus
of super charged energy.&nbsp; This always seems to attract spirits.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT"><font color="#CCFFFF">Theaters</font> - The
actors have run the gambit of human emotions inside the walls of a theater
plus&nbsp; many have interesting hauntings attached to them.&nbsp; Many
old theaters have interesting histories that may contribute to the likelihood
that there are spirits there.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT"><font color="#CCFFFF">Battlefields</font> -
These are great locations simply because of their nature.&nbsp; Many violent
deaths in one area will always hold some spirits and psychic energy there.&nbsp;
A soldiers life and death struggle exudes a large amount of energy.&nbsp;
this is also a great spot for residual hauntings.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT"><font color="#CCFFFF">Churches</font> - There
is a long history of the faithful returning to the church they worshipped
at.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">They may be looking for the salvation they
were promised and cannot find.&nbsp; Churches also have large amounts of
human emotional energy trapped there left behind from weddings, funerals,
etc.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT"><font color="#CCFFFF">Hotels/Motels/Boarding
houses</font> - Many dark dealing and highly emotional events take places
in</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">these rooms.&nbsp; They also have a lot of
traffic, many people are in and out of these rooms.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT"><font color="#CCFFFF">Historic Locations</font>
- Many historic buildings, because of their age, have had more time to
have</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">spirits attach to it.&nbsp; These buildings
are often open the public and can give you a easy place to</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">start.&nbsp; Many even have known histories
of hauntings and you may be able to gain access to the</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arrus BT">building after hours after speaking with the
caretakers.</font></b>
