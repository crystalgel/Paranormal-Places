<p class="MsoNormal">Black Magic</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A while back, a friend and I had been dabbling into black
magic, somewhat half-heartedly (I was into it much more than he).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had The Necronomicon (which has another
paranormal story with me altogether) and other spell books.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We created a game called Necronopoly, a Monopoly
spin-off, of course, which included Heaven and Hell cards, grave yards instead
of rail roads etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, we were on our
way to another friend of ours house around dusk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were getting off of the exit ramp from
I-70, the kind that makes almost a full circle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About halfway around the loop I spotted what looked to be a homeless man
off to the side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being the stupid
teenager I was, the first thought that popped into my head was to tell my
friend to swerve and act like we were going to hit him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I said a word of it, I got the worst
chilling feeling inside of my stomach I had ever felt and I completely froze
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I watched the man as we drove by,
who did look like a homeless man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
beard and moustache covered his mouth, but the part of his face that struck
more fear in me was his eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
blue and glossy, almost as if he was high on drugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stared straight at me the whole time we
passed, which seemed like an eternity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could not move, I could only sit there frozen, perhaps even shaking a
little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got to the street light
at the exit ramp I was finally able to talk to my friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I explained to him what had just happened and
while I did this, he just shook his head, looking more scared than I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he saw the man from a distance and
got the same feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was so scared
he could not look at the man at all as we passed and could not even bare to
look in the rear view mirror behind him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After talking, we both agreed that this man was The Devil himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only wondered whether he was around
because of us, or was it coincidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even in writing this now, years later, I see his face, his eyes, and it
gives me chills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sometimes, like
right now, makes me feel like someone is behind me, though no one is.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In just this year I have had many encounters with a ghost,
some of them life saving. My first encounter was at the beginning of this year,
right before I turned 11.(I'm almost 12 now.) My Cocker Spaniel Tobie had died
a week before they started happening. Most of them happen in my school, which
is over 100 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in science
working on a chemical mixture when i heard a voice in my head that said
"Get out of the room now!!!! Get out fast!!!!!!!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Frightened, I excused myself to go to the
restroom. Not 30 seconds after I had left the room I heard a loud bang, and saw
smoke come out from under the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
later found out that my partner had put in too much of something, and caused a
serious negative reaction, puting her in critical condition. If I had been in
there, I too would have been serioulsy injured. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another time my English teacher told me to come to his
classroom. As I approached he tried to sexually attack me. But when he got
close, a blue glowing wall formed between us, blocking his path to me. Then the
wall shrank and turned into a little dog... it was Tobie! He started snarling
and barking and made my teacher back off. I started screaming for help which
two 8th grade boys responded to. Later that night Tobie appeared on my bed and
snuggled up close. He felt so real, I could feel his fur against my arms. I
calmed down and fell asleep, and when I woke up the next morning he was gone. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I know Tobie has come back to protect me. Because whenever I
feel sad or scared or whatever... I feel a soft brush of fur on my arms, or a
wet slobbery lick on my cheek.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The year of 2003 my sister had been graduating from
highschool and moving into her apartment. As she was getting shown around the
house she was taking alot of pictures of every inch of the house. These
pictures soon came in handy later on.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As soon as she figured out what color to paint her basement
she began to work on painting it. After the paint had dried she had to paint
over it a second time when she got to the door to her tornado shelter she
noticed the word "Help" written on it. Not thinking anything of it
she continued painting. After touching up on a few spots she went to check
again and noticed that the writing was blue. she thought that maybe the paint
had an affect on the color of the word. She decided she would try to go over it
once more and to her surprise the last color was red.Then she remembered she
had taken pictures. She went back to look at them and noticed nothing had been
written on the door then. She started to become a little scared, and worried
about it constantly. After bringing people over to see it and try to uncover
the weird incident more things were starting to happen. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Although she never seemed to see any figures she could
always feel the presence of something there. As days went on she noticed the
word "Help" getting brighter red then the day before. After a few
weeks of this happening it soon starting running down the door. After
contacting her landlord, he soon revealed that the word "help" on the
door was too thick to be paint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
soon proved to be blood!!!! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After figuring this out she decided she would move to the
dorms instead staying in that same apartment. To this day, the new owner of the
apartment, has been painting layers of paint on the door, but "Help"
just won't seem to go away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">About 6 months ago a friend and I went for a weekend of
ghost hunting using your web site as a guide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The 1st place we stopped was Joes' Road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was awesome,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we parked, put
the car in neutral and at the bottom of the hill, apparently we were backwards
because we only moved about 10 feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
we turned around to try again and this time we moved all the way up the
hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got it all on tape, we were
going 7 mph up the hill,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened the
door and taped the road, then we taped the back window, we didn't see anything
until we got home and then the orbs in my back window appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We even tried baby powder on my tail gate but
it was too windy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We talked to some
local's and they said they do it when there's nothing else to do and it always
work's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband went fishing one day
on lake Winnebago, and checked out Joe's road in daylight, he said that the
road was down hill,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but I told him then
why didn't it work when we were parked backyard's, if it's a hill it will work
either way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It's not a long road but it has two hill with a valley
between the stop signs and a farm house down at the bottom. My friend and I are
convinced of Joe and his road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
recommend it to anyone, you have to try this one!!!!!!!.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On that same trip we also tried Chilton's <st1:Street><st1:address>Breed
  Street</st1:address></st1:Street> and stayed at the Karsten Inn in
Kewaunee<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of all the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>places we stopped<span style="">&nbsp; </span>these 3 places were the best.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In Chilton we parked at the corner and just videoed,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my camera was real goofy,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it would get real blurry and then clear
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the end of the road there was a
light that kept changing colors and got bigger and smaller.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When cars appeared at the stop sign their
headlights were fine one minute and you could tell that it was a vehicle, and
the next time the lights were big, blurry, and looked like only one light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could not tell it was a car, until you
looked up from the camera.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At the Karsten we actually stayed in Agatha's room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We read the guest book of stories, and later
we went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We woke up in the middle
of the night to an awful smell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also
heard bump's and noises all night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
we woke up we opened the door to find our door frame in the hall way on the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We then went down to breakfast
and met the other couple staying there,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>they asked us about the party we had the night before at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 pm</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We then told them that we didn't get into the inn until about <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30-10:00</st1:time>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This month we plan on taking another trip to investigate
more hauntings we will keep you informed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi ! I read your stories on the "Shadowlands"
website. I am a true believer of ghosts, ufo's, spirits, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your story was very interesting to me. I am
emailing you because i wanted to share an experience I had when I was younger,
maybe 10 years old or so. This took place in my bedroom, I remember it was
either Halloween or around Halloween because my mother had carved out a pumpkin
and put a candle in it to lite the room. Anyway, I don't know what time it was
but what I do remeber is what I saw. I was completely woke and aware. My bed
was against the wall, and to my right, was the door, which was open. However
the open door is not what scared me. What I saw was something that appeared to
be a little witch, on the door handle. Almost the size of a "treasure
troll" but<span style="">&nbsp; </span>bigger. It had a pointy
hat, there was no face, but I remeber being scared as hell . When I screamed
for my mother, no sound could come out of my mouth. I could hear me saying
"ma!, ma!" yet there was no sound that you could coming from me. I
guess I heard myself in my head? This was very real. It wasn't my imagination
nor was I asleep to be dreaming. I never told my mother until years later for
some reason, because it was almost like I totally forget (for some strange
reason) . And then one day, with my mother and I having a conversation, I just
brung it up. She laughed. But to this day, when I talk about it, I can still
re-live that memory as if it just happened. Another incident happened that took
place, only this time both my mother and I both seen the same thing. This is at
a different apartment and I was much older here. A teenager between 13-*16
years old. We were watching TV, all lights out in the house and the only light
that was visible was the TV light. Next door, was my room, which my door was
open. While watching TV, i saw something out of the corner of my eye, a little shadow,
that for some reason, felt like it was the size of a doll or smaller. It dashed
into my room! The ironic thing is that my mother saw the same thing! We both
looked at each other with a puzzled look on our face to figure out what that
was. We didn't own any animals of any kind. No birds flew into the house. It
was unexplainable. But we both seen these "shadowy" things out the
corners of our eyes. These stories are very true. I hope you can email me and
give me a little insight? Thank you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our Son</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: badco6@tampabay.rr.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is a story about what happened to me and my husband
about three years ago. We had two small children, a boy and a girl. Our son
died of a bad illness. Soon after is when this story began. We had just
returned from retrieving our son ashes, which we kept in an urn atop our
bedroom dresser, earlier that evening. We had just put our infant daughter to
bed and were laying in bed watching T.V.Our son's urn slowly started moving
from the back of the dresser to the front. Then started shaking from side to
side. As if he wanted out. I was very scared as this was my first experience
with actually seeing a spirit. I hid my head under the covers and told my
husband to move his urn to the back of the dresser so it wouldn't fall off. I didn't
think I could stand actually have to see his ashes. My husband got up and spoke
to our son [he was much braver then I was at the time] telling him it was OK
and he needed to be careful not to fall off the dresser. My husband had just
returned to bed when it had started again. This time he removed our son's urn
and placed it on the floor. That&#8217;s what started it all. For then we heard a
loud crash come from the bathroom. My husband went to investigate. Returning to
tell me he had found nothing broken or moved. Then the noises moved to the
kitchen and then to his bedroom. As if he was still going about his play. We
then realized that our son must not know that he had passed on. My husband
tried speaking to him and telling him it was OK and he should go on to Heaven.
The noises stopped. We thought he listened to him. But then there was knocking
at the door. It was our best friend and was also our son's God mother. We sat
on the living room couch and told her what had just happened. She in turn told
us what we had assumed. He was too young to realize he was gone. From our
friends vantage point on the couch she could see partially into the bathroom.
We heard her gasp and then cry out.&#8217; My God, she said, look at that&#8217; we all
went into the bathroom to discover what had made the loud crash that had come
from the bathroom earlier. There was a small hand print on the cabinet under
the sink. It was just the size of our recently departed son's and looked as
though he had been playing in the dirt, for it was brownish- black in color. I
know that it was not there earlier for I, my husband, and our friend had spent
the last few days cleaning the house, removing all his clothes and toys. Giving
them to our friend, who also had a young son? That was the end of it for that night.
But it started again the very next morning. I must tell this about our son
first so you will understand what happened. Our son slept in the room on the
other side of our bedroom wall. When he awoke every morning he would play for a
little while quietly, then when he started to get hungry he would knock on the
adjoining wall. This would wake me up. The very next morning I was awakened by
the knocking on the wall. And have just woken up, I was still disoriented, got
out of bed to go and tend to my son. Not remembering that he was gone until
opening his bedroom door to find it empty. I was not so scared this time and I
spoke to him. I told him that we all loved him and missed him but that as he
had passed on I could not give him his breakfast. I went back in my bedroom and
woke my husband to tell him what had happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later that morning I received a frantic call from our
friend, telling me of the very real dream she had had the night before after
leaving our house. Her youngest son was only two months old at the time and
still woke in the middle of night for a bottle. So when she "awoke"
to her son's cries she just got up and went to the kitchen to heat him a
bottle. She was turning lights on as she went. As she turned the kitchen light
on there was our son standing in the middle of her kitchen. She was shocked at
first but then started to speak to him. Our son and friend were very close
before he died and went to her house frequently to play with her three
children. She was a strong believer in the super natural. It didn't bother her
at first. A game that they used to play was my son would run around her house
with a beach ball and she would chase after him. In this "dream&#8221; he had
the ball and was calling to her to chase him. She went after him calling his name.
After a few minutes of chasing him, he ran into her youngest son's room and
disappeared. That&#8217;s when she woke up to, up&#8217; you may have already guessed it,
her son's nightly feeding. So she was very frightened then thinking she had
dreamed what was about to happen. It didn't though. It was our son's way of
telling his best friend good bye. All that day we heard noises much the same as
the night before. Only his spirit was no longer in his urn, so it didn't move
anymore. But the strangest of all was to happen to me that night while I slept.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband and I were babysitting our friend&#8217;s three
children at her house, while she and her husband were out at a restaurant. We
were in the living room with our daughter and her two older children playing
video games. Her youngest son was taking a nap. A few minutes later he awoke
from his nap and started to cry for a bottle. So I went into his bedroom and
there in his doorway was my son. The exact spot that he had disappeared from in
my friend&#8217;s dream. I yelled for my husband to come to me. Just as my husband
was coming down the hall, our son ran out of the bedroom and down the other end
of the hall. When we started to walk towards, him showed us he had the beach
ball in his hands. Then he spoke&#8221; Momma, Daddy, want to play ball&#8221;. So we all
sat down in the hallway and rolled the ball back and forth. After a few minutes
he got up and went out into the living room to watch the other kids play video
games. That is were my dream ended. Later in the morning, I called my friend to
tell her about my dream. It was like she had the first half of the dream and I
had the second. Nothing like that had ever happened to either of us before or
again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Over the next couple days, the noises continued. My husband
and I felt very bad, not able to really get over our son&#8217;s death because he was
still with us. Which was a good thing and a bad? Our son had a little bid more
time with us, but we knew we had to help him move on, we just didn&#8217;t know how.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later that night, after my husband had left for work, I was
home alone with our daughter. I had just put her down to sleep. I was sitting
on my bed watching T.V. when I heard a noise coming from the living room. I
looked out my bedroom door and out into my kitchen. [It was a very connected
apartment} I saw a man standing in my kitchen. I was very scared at this
because it was not my son and I had no idea who it was. Then just as quickly,
he disappeared. Then, I saw my son run by the bedroom door. I got a very cold
feeling of dread. I just felt such anger coming from the kitchen and fear from
my son. It looked as if my son was running from the man. That made me mad! Who
was this man to scare my son even in death? I knew that right then and there
that I must do something. I called my husband and friend and they both came to
me. My friend said that we should get a Ouija board and try to contact this man
and find out what his problem was with our son. So, she left and my husband and
I went to buy one. We came home and went into our son&#8217;s bedroom and sat on the
floor. It wasn&#8217;t long before the man came through. He explained to us that he
had been cremated right before our son and some of his ashes had been left
behind and now were in the same urn as our son. He wanted the rest of his
ashes. We told him there was nothing we could do about that. But that we would
help him and our son move on so they could be at peace. The man explained to us
that since he was trapped with some of his spirit in our house and the rest of
it else where, that I would have to guide him through the Ouija board. So, I
did. And our son followed. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That was the end of the man. But our son still comes to
visit us occasionally. We feel him with us always. Losing a loved one,
especially a child, is very difficult. But by our son hanging around for a
while, it did help us by getting to say good bye one last time.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

up loud enough to hear in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She (my Mom) double checks before she leaves the room to make sure the

<p class="MsoNormal">I have had a few dreams of events that have taken place

there were about a dozen cars parked in front of their house and people going
inthe house were dressed in like Sunday clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back in our house and told my mom that

<p class="MsoNormal">ok, so here goes my story. i know it sounds really
impossible to some but either bare with me, or quit reading. about 2-3 years
ago i lived in a very old appartment complex in marrysville <st1:State><st1:place>ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.
when we first moved in i knew there was something very weidr about it, it just
didnt seem like a very happy place. my parents were in the process of a divorce
and my dad lived within walking distance. i choose the room on the left once
you walk up the stairs. there was a stair case with a landing 1/2 way up the
stairs that you could see from my door way. my moms room was right on the other
side of mine and the bathroom right across the hall. well back to the story. so
i was being baby sat by my best friends sister and we were down stairs
listening to music and suddenly all the lights and music went off. we figured
the power had just gone out so we just started talking. after about like 10
minutes the tv came on and it was al static. lately i had been seeing a man in
a black cloak run from our kitchen out the back doo and i looked over and saw
it again. nobody in my family believed me so i looked to <st1:place>constance</st1:place>
and asked her if she has seen that and she said yes. so we were a bit freaked
out and decided to go upstairs. at about 3 in the morning <st1:place>constance</st1:place>
went to sleep and i stayed up because i could have sworn i was hearing people
down stairs and that the stairs were creeking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i turned to switch the stereo on ( the power had come back by this time)
and i head a voice right behin me. it was a guys voice and it said '' dont
scream and dont be afraid.'' i slowly turned around expecting to see a guy with
a rope or something ready to tie me uo but there was nobody there. i quietly
ased who was there and where they were but nobody answered. ( <st1:place>constance</st1:place>
was baby sitting for a week) i decided i had imagined it so i just decided to
go to bed. the next night we were watching a cartoon in my bed room and i heard
the same voice. i turned the tv off and asked <st1:place>constance</st1:place>
if she had heard that and she said she thought she heard a man talking. so i
asked who was there and where they were again. this time it answered me. it
said its name was willy and that he<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>wanted to be friends. he said he was sitting right beside me. i turned
to look and i couldnt see him. will said that he was my guardian angel so i
wouldnt be able to see him. i think it was a mistake but i agreed to be a
friend. so me and constance talked to him for the remainer of he baby sitting
stay. after about a month things started to turn for the worst. i had a problem
with one of my friends and i told willy and he/it asked me if i wanted him to
hurt them. that was when i decided he wasnt very friendly and asked him to
leave. that night i had my friend that had made me angry( we made up) spend the
night as a way to say i forgive you. well i thought something might happen but
i took my mind off of it. at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
we decided to turn the tv off and just talk untill we fell asleep. i heard
something on the stairs and went to look but i couldnt see any one but i tho ht
i heard my name in willy's voice so i went back to my room and shut my door.
right after i shut my door i heard someone laughing and this freaked us both
out because my mom was at the neighbors house. i ran over and locked my door
then ran back to my bed and grabbed my baseball bat and stood by my closet
ready to hit anyone who came in. then my door knob started shaking and my door
rattled violently. i seriously thoughti heard willy's distinct laugh so i
hollered at him and told him to go away and never come back. right after that
the dor stopped and we both vowed to never tell any one we knew what happened
unless we seriously considered it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so,
do i sound like a nut yet? thanx,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: nsmommy0@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I wanted to tell you of some personal experiences that
happened in <st1:place>Randallstown</st1:place> <st1:State><st1:place>Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a Job Corps center on Old Court Road
it is technically considered <st1:place><st1:City>Woodstock</st1:City> <st1:State>Maryland</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Center is called <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Woodstock</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Job</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName>Corps</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a student as well as a Residential
Adviser at this facility from 1995-1996 (student).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1998-1999 (residential adviser)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, this is a huge mansion type building
that currently houses up to 550 students, it used to be a monk monastery, there
is a graveyard for the monks that still sits at the entrance of the
center.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, when I was a student
there, there were a lot of strange things that would happen but we had one that
was widely known around center he was called the black monk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not because of the color of his skin but
because he had no face and under the hood of his cloak you could only see
black, he used to walk around the center at night if you woke up in the middle
of the night and looked out your window you would sometime see him on the
grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next experience is that
there is a dorm called <st1:City><st1:place>Columbia</st1:place></st1:City>
(all of the dorms are named after surrounding towns).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the dorm that I lived on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There used to be an extension to the dorm
that you could access through a door at the back of the lounge (the entrance to
that part was always kept locked) on the upstairs section of the dorm. This
section of <st1:City><st1:place>Columbia</st1:place></st1:City> burned down
sometime in the eighty's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the dorm
caught fire there was a sixteen year old girl who perished in the fire she has
been seen many times in the dorm lounge. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Just before I started at the center there was a dance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would have happened in the summer of
1995 the night of the dance a young girl, I believe she was 16 or 17 was out on
the grounds walking to the dance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she realized that the dance was starting she began to run to the entrance to
get to the dance. As she trotted towards the entrance she realized that she was
having trouble breathing she was an asthmatic and had forgotten her inhaler in
her room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having trouble breathing and
with no one around (everyone was in the dance) she sat down on the steps to the
then flagpole (now waterfall) and perished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was also a resident of Columbia Hall and you could hear her wheezing
walking down the hall at times during the night or when the dorm was
quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, when I was a staff member
there I was placed on Columbia Hall as staff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, in the mornings we used to have to check all of the rooms to make
sure that the girls had cleaned there rooms, close and lock the lounge and laundry
room, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One morning while I was up
there I would always start at the far end of the dorm checking rooms and the
laundry room was about midway down the hall and the lounge was at the end of
the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I went in to check a
students room and when I came back out of that room I realized that the lounge
door was closed, it was open when I went into the first room and closed when I
came out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I decided to go down and
just lock it figuring the door had just caught wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I went to lock it, it was already
locked!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this was impossible since the
door had to be locked with a key!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Than
just at that moment I heard the washing machines ALL FOUR OF THEM start up in spin
mode so, at this point I got creeped out and I went into the laundry room to
investigate thinking maybe one of the girls was being funny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got into the laundry om there was no
one in site and as I lifted the lids all of the washers were half full with
water (mind you I said that they were in spin mode!)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point I became too creeped out to
stand it so I ran downstairs to get another staff member to come up with me
until my inspection was complete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don't know if I have some kind of gift or something but,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not the only one to see or hear these
things (except that morning no one else was with me) but there was something
about that place that just seemed to draw this out in me I was always the one
to see them and draw other peoples attention to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since leaving there I have not had such
powerful occasions I have had some strange things (feeling someone else is in
the room etc, etc.) but nothing this strong,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and I will never forget them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thanks for listening</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">it is called a promise. well one day my aunt and my uncle
lived together. well my uncle had promised to my aunt that he would someday cut
down the tree in their backyard. well on a day my uncle was drinking cofee but
all of a sudden he droped dead. so on the night of the funeral my aunt and the
people living around her thought they heard someone liting off fire crackers in
the backyard. so they went out to take a look. when they went out no one was
there but they watched in amazment as the tree in their backyard fell down all
by itself. theweird thing is that during that night there was no rain no wind
no lightning no thunder or anything that could of knocked the tree down. its
almost as if the tree tore itself off of the roots and ground and threw itself
against the ground. but thats not what i think, i think that my uncle kept his
promise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am Selena I live in IL. <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
but that's all i can tell you sorry. I don't like giving out info about me. I
practice witch craft. white magic only! I am also somewhat religous. (christin)
sorry if i spell a lot wrong I have ADD and dilixia. Wow i guess i do give a
lot out a bout me. lol. well anyways. I had just went on to your site about
vampires and I ended up hearing a very loud growel. It might sound like much
but resintly i have been feeling very uneasy about my aprtment. sounds and all
really late at night when i know the people up staris are asleep. but most of
the noises come from my kittchen or my room when i'm on the computer in my
front room. not only this but my friend and i tend to feel a power or even see
things. no one can prove it so they say it's not real. I have dealt with stuff
like this my hole life. even my mom and dad have. they both have tolled me of
stories about thier inconters. the one that stood out the most though is my moms
storie about a house in <st1:place><st1:City>Willmington</st1:City>, <st1:State>IL</st1:State></st1:place>.
I don't know if that's spelled right. oh well. oh any-ways. my mom and dad
owned the house befor my mom left him. but it i think was reported that 2 wemon
died there. well my mom was home alone when my dad went to drive me and my
brothers and sisters to my grand parents (6 hour drive all toghter there and
back) well it was dark out my mom was sitting in her room with our dog at the
time. when the lights started to go off bye them self. and it wasn't like acurcit
bracker or any thing it was the swittch that went down every time my mom put it
back up. then she started to here some one walking up on the second floor. (my
mom was the only one home) she thought someone broke in so she got the baseball
bat and cheecked every thing. d i mean every thing. and all the things that
they say would happen happened. including my dog waking up and starded barking
at the celing. she never found anything but that didn't make her stop
wondering. we left the house my mom me and 2 sisters and 2 brothers. my other
sister and brother stayed with my dad since the where his and some othere
lady's. I have talked to them about it and they said they would lay on the
floor half in and out of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there door ways
talking. one day they started to hear some noises. they where scared and went
to bed. or at least thats what they say. my mom and us moved to a new town far
away. and after a while my dad joined us only to live across the street. I
don't know if the house still stands today still but i think i have an address
and photo some where. I don't know what to ask but what is going on with me and
my friend I mean none of the othere can see them even we are staring strait at
then. scarry. oh well. even if you don't have an answer to this little sorta
long storie you can use this for your ghost stories if you think it's worthy. I
do not lie. so i'm telling you this is 100% real. thank you for lisening good
bye</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Before I was born my great grandma really wanted to see me.
But she died soon before I was born. When I was 3 or 4 years old I came
downstairs from my room and told my mom something that happened before I was
born. She was apalled. She asked: "Who told you that?!" And I replied
simply: "The old lady upstairs." Because of the info i told about my
great grandma, my mom souly believes I spoke to the ghost of my great grandma.
I have had other paranormal expierences as well.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi my name is Raynie and i am 16 years old.All of my life my
family members have told me stories about ghosts and experiences that they have
had in my grams' house.They have also had sightings in every other one of my
family memebers home but that is another story.Well i didnt really believe
theses stories until I had a strange experience myself.I went to sleep at my
grams' house one night to take care of her while she was sick and i was laying
down on the family room couch.I then heard a noise coming from my left
side.Ithen looked to the left only to see that nothing was there,then i heard
footsteps leading to the basement door which you can see from where i was
laying down.I looked over once more and i saw the basement door begin to
open..as i got up to go check it i heard footsteps coming down the stairs..come
to find out..it was grams..but she didnt go anywhere near the basement that
night.I kind of brushed it off as a figment of my imagination..until a few days
later i went to check on my grams' and i noticed that my grams's house was
oddly cold.Ichecked the a.c. to see if it was on and it wasnt..i went upstairs
to check on her and found her lying up in bed waving and saying goodbye to
someone ( i couldnt really make out the name) a few minutes later i got a call
from my mother saying that my aunt had passed on..i was so0 freaked! well after
that my grams' decided to sell her house and move into my aunts old house and
take care of her children.It sometimes feels like my aunt is there with
us.Sometimes we will be sitting on the couch watching t.v and it will just turn
off by itself.My last experience was about two weeks ago and i havent had one
since..but when i get another one i will let you know!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Accident</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: cella@sio.midco.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I was driving with my mother and two children in my car
we slowly approached an accident site.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were living in Sioux Falls, SD, and it was in the year 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my horror, a motorcyclist had collided
with a car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car, driven by an
elderly man, pulled out of a driveway and right in front of the on-coming
motorcyclist, who appeared to be in his 30's.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I told my children to remain inside my car, as my mother and
I got out of the car to see if there was anything we could do to help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accident had happened only a few moments
before we arrived at the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police
hadn't even arrived yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The elderly
man, who was the driver of the car involved in the collision, was sitting on
the curb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had no injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motorcyclist was lying in the middle of
the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't until I approached
more closely that I realized the horror of what I was looking at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the motorcyclist struck the car, part of
the motorcycle itself became wedged beneath the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motorcyclist went underneath the car and
out the other side. When the motorcyclist's body went underneath the car, his
legs and his body were mangled and one of his motorcycle boots was pulled right
off his foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motorcyclists body was
lying flat on the stomach, with his arms flat beside his chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man's legs were completely twisted
around, and looked as it he were lying on his back from the waist down, except
for his legs which were twisted round and round.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man's neck was completely twisted around
and looking upward toward the sky.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That's when I realized the man wasn't dead yet!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began crying uncontrollably at the
sight!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am a very devout Catholic and I happened to have a pocket
full of Scapulars that afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As my
mother and I watched this man look up into the sky, as if he were focusing on
some unseen object, he drew in his last breath right before our eyes!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knelt beside the man and I spit upon his
forehead and whispered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I baptize
thee in the name of thy Father, thy Son, and thy Holy Spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I placed a Scapular in the palm of the
man's hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I did this, the man exhaled
for the last time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked away sobbing my heart out.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the year 1997, I was having extreme marital
problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I married in 1993 to a very
abusive individual, and finally in 1997 I decided to pack what I could in the
trunk of my car, load up my four children in the middle of the night and get as
far away from my abusive husband as I could get.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said "goodbye" to my mother at
10pm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The further I drove out of town,
the more it felt as if I were doing the right thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been driving on the very dark highway
for a while, when SUDDENLY OUT OF NOWHERE I saw the figure of a man in the lane
ahead of me!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I panicked because I was
driving about 80 miles per hour and I knew that there was no way that I could
stop my car without hitting the figure in my lane up ahead!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see that it was the figure of a
man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as I began to scream out of my
fear of striking the man, he looked right up into my eyes!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I let out a blood curdling scream, yet none
of my children awoke!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I closed my eyes
knowing that my car was going to strike that man!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car never hit anything, or anyone as I
slammed on my brakes!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just when I
realized that I had seen that mans piercing blue eyes before, when I should
have struck that man, I instead experienced a passing through his ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought I was having a "heart
attack" because I was in so much pain!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn't even breathe, or move.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My car came to a complete stop on the highway after I slammed on my
brakes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no other cars in
sight and I feared another vehicle might come up behind me and hit my car!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I couldn't move!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Little by lilttle I began to slowly breathe
again, and the intense pain began to subside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked up and I saw the figure and the piercing blue eyes of the
motorclyclist that was killed back in 1989, who I had prayed for!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he disappeared into thin air!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could never forget the piercing blue
eyes!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was still wearing the same
clothes he had on the day he was killed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Same boots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I do not know "why" he came to me that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was it to "thank me"?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or did he come to bring me a message?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I arrived at my destination, I found out that my Aunt
was dying from cancer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was able to be
close to her during the last days of her life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I dont know if I saved the motorcyclist somehow with my
blessing, prayer and Scapular on the day that he died?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I dont know if he had some kind of divine
intervention for me where my Aunt was concerned?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I do know that his spirit passed through
my soul on the highway in the middle of the night back in 1997 as I fled for my
life with my children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">What do you think?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My friends and I had just graduated from high school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We spent the entire summer ghost
hunting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since we lived close to G-Burg,
we decided to make a trip up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don't remember the road we turned onto, but it was up past the main part of
town, going north.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were two guys,
a girl, and myself, and we pulled the car over and got out to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was after midnight, very warm outside, and
the moon was out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first thing we
noticed was a chilly mist above the ground.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This may be a common occurrence, but it added to the experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boys went out into the fields and split
up, and my friend and I stayed by the car, smoking cigarettes and
chatting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We weren't able to see where
the boys were, but we stuck close by in case they came running back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leaning against the car, I saw the property
across from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had old wooden
fencing and a barn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a farm
house, still occupied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A generator of
some sort was running with a low hum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
started to hear something other than the normal workings of a house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard clops, made from hooves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also heard wagon wheels on the pavement
rolling closer and closer.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I remained
still and did not let on that I heard anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It became more noticeable and my friend asked me if I just heard
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I nodded and we backed up
closer against the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We continued to
hear the clopping and turning wheels, followed by low mumbling, like that of
men talking quietly to one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
we looked at one another and started to question whether should get back into
the car, two full shadowy figures walked past us, within a foot of us!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The moonlight was our only source of vision,
and who sees shadows at night?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
not a drug-induced nor alcohol-induced hallucination--two figures truly passed
by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't say anything at first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I slowly turned to my pal asking, 'J, did you
see anything?'</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She responded, 'You mean the two shadows walking in front of
us?'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was enough confirmation for
me! I told her I saw the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
screamed and jumped back into the car, hugging one another and hoping that
nothing had followed us in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moments
later, the two fellas opened up the car doors, jumped in, lit cigarettes,
started the car, and started to speed off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Confused, we asked what happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither said a word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
gentleman driver, S, pulled over a half a mile up from where we originally
sat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shaking, he started comparing
stories with the other gentleman, R.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, we asked what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>S
told the group that when he went in the opposite direction of R, he stood in
the field and was tapped on the shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A voice said, 'hello'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking
it was R playing a trick, he turned around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same
time, R was struck with a small rock and he heard horse hooves trudging
by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scared, both ran and met up in the
middle, and headed towards the car where they found J and I clutching one
another, screaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True story, I assure
you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Disturbing the Spirits</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: katja@spinningjenny.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been reading the stories on your web site for several
weeks no, and I think it's interesting how different people react. I have two
stories, one long one that happened to me, and one I was told second hand by a
friend who is very straightforward and honest. Please do not use any e-mail
address but the one at the bottom of the page.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was discharged from the Air Force in '04 due to
disability, and because of that I wasn't allowed to return to work for several
months. Since I wasn't being paid, when a close friend asked me to help her
house-sit for a week for a good amount of money, I jumped at the chance. When
there was only a few days before the house sitting was to begin, she told me
the house was haunted. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have to explain that I do not go into cemeteries because I
feel like I am suffocating, or having an anxiety attack or something. I KNOW
it's because of the spirits trying to contact me (especially after reading
other people's similar experiences). So when she told me the house was haunted,
I hesitated. But she needed me for late night and early morning and she
couldn't get anyone else, so I told her I would still do it, but if anything
creepy started happening, I was out of there!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The day I was supposed to start house sitting, we went to
the house together to introduce me to the four dogs (the Irish Setter is the
only really significant one, his name was Toby) and show me where everything
was. The house is very old, actually a converted barn. When you walk to the
front door, it's actually a breezeway. Straight ahead was Mattie's (the woman
who was paying us to house sit) office. I was told that the doors to the office
were to remain closed, and not to go up there. To the right was Mattie's
mother's house (which was built new) where Toby and the littlest dog lived.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To the left was Mattie's house where she lived with her
husband and three children. Walking through the door, the stairs were
immediately on the left, going to the upstairs, which was all open in the
middle (again, it used to be a barn). The sitting room and dining room (where I
never went) were on the right side, and to the left was the kitchen, stairs to
the basement, and the living room where I was going to be sleeping. In the
living room was a door onto a small porch that was cluttered with junk. My
friend told me not to open the door, it was hard to open (you had to shoulder
it and then force it past the junk) and even harder to close because it wasn't
hung right and the wood was swollen because of the humidity. Through the tour
of the house, I was a little creeped out, but I attributed it to just being
nervous. After going in the basement, I REFUSED to go down there ever again, it
just felt...BAD. Last bit of info on the house, at the top of the stairs, the
hallway that circles all the way around is bare wood floor. Mattie's bedroom is
the first one on the left, and there's a small (8x8) area between her bedroom
door and the "hallway" that is carpeted.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There were six spirits in the house. Three of them have been
living there for quite some time and are well known to the family and are
playful or flirtatious (my friend had been slapped on the behind when she was
making a bed and she was alone in the house) but the meanest thing they ever
did was not let you light the gas stove. The other three were new and unknown,
they had followed Mattie home from work. The only thing she knew was that one
of the new ones was female and she would let out a bloodcurdling scream as if
she was being murdered.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The last bit of background I will give you is that I am
Wicca, and several years ago I had my "third eye" (spiritual vision)
opened by a druid, and I sleepwalk. Back to the story.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She showed me around the house and we played with the dogs,
and I left to return that evening. I was sitting on the couch watching TV, and
around 2100 I decided to go to sleep. All four dogs were in Mattie's side of
the house with me, and the doors were all closed. As I was laying on the couch
(which is under Mattie's bedroom), I hear footsteps upstairs. Heavy footsteps
in work boots. They started at the top of the stairs, sounded four times and
stopped as they reached the carpet. I took a deep breath, and tried to sleep.
Within a few minutes, all four dogs jumped up barking and ran for the front
door into the breezeway. Not sure what it was, I went out, and saw the cat
outside, let him in, and went back to lay down on the couch. The dogs all
followed me in and settled down. Ten minutes later, they jumped up, barking,
and ran for the door again. This time there was nothing there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There wasn't anything there between the first time and
midnight when it finally stopped. Periodically until nearly midnight the dogs
would be settling down for the night, and they would get up barking and go
running for the door.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I mentioned this to my friend the next morning, and she told
me that the next time it happened to explain to "them" that I needed
to rest (I was coming down with a nasty cold at that point) and to please let
the dogs settle down. That night, right on time at 9:05, the dogs all four got
up barking for the door. I did what my friend told me to do, and it was quiet
for the rest of the night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Over the next few days my friend and I started noticing
things out of place.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">While we later discovered that it was Mattie's mother in law
(she saw where my friend and I "hid" the key between shifts), the
spirits were getting VERY upset. By this time my start of a cold was pretty
terrible, and I was sleeping restlessly. For those of you who don't know much
about sleepwalkers, it's the subconscious mind getting up and doing things.
Well, that night my subconscious mind was "up and doing things" when
I heard a bloodcurdling scream. I sat bolt upright, and Toby (who had been sleeping
on me at that point) jumped off the couch and ran barking for the door to the
little porch. The door that was supposed to be impossible to open swung open
without a sound. I can't think of a time in my life when I have ever been more
terrified, but I somehow managed to lay back down and get to sleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I mentioned, Mattie's mother-in-law was coming into the
house and disrupting the spirits. The night I was sleepwalking, I heard one of
the spirits, establishing that they could communicate with me. The night after
the scream, I was wrapped up in some sweat pants, a sweatshirt, and thick heavy
socks. I was very sick. I also found every blanket I could get from the house
(I think it was 7) and doubled some of them over to crawl under.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The heat was turned up, and Toby was sleeping on me. I
shivered for nearly an hour, freezing like I have never been cold before. Maybe
it was my cold (even though no other time have I ever been cold, I'm always
hot) but I had the claustrophobic feeling that I would get in a cemetery. My
friend and I hypothesize that all six of them were standing around me, trying
to make me hear them so they could tell me about the mother-in-law coming into
the house during the day.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My second story is second hand, but I thought it was interesting.
A friend of mine in New Hampshire lives in a house that was built in the
1700's.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Lights go off and on, doors slam, etc. Nothing malicious,
just letting the new owners know they were there (she said there are two, and
one of them is a man). One night her niece and nephew were spending the night,
and since they like scary stories, they decided to have some fun and turn on
the tape recorder, since it can supposedly pick up frequencies we can't hear.
They walked around the house talking and giggling, and finally got tired when
nothing happened and went into the family room to play monopoly. The two kids
were going to sleep in the den, which had an alcove. The two of them started
arguing because her niece didn't want to sleep near the alcove. Her brother said
that he would, and the game went on. Finally someone noticed that the tape
player was still recorded, so they rewound it and played it as the game went
on. At the point in the tape where the two were arguing over sleeping
arrangements, a voice as clear as day was recorded on the tape "Shh, we
won't hurt you." Everyone in the house that night was on the tape, except
that one voice. She still has the tape and still doesn't want to believe how
the voice got on there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sorry it's so long, but I'm glad I was able to say
something. I have more supernatural stories, but those are my two ghost
stories.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know if being able to tune myself in to the spirits
would be better or worse, right now it's just a lot of feelings, kind of like
trying to listen to a static radio station. Any thoughts on that, let me know.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, this is the first time i have ever written down the
things that have happened to me and my family. Im sure there are worse cases
but this is what has happened so far....</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My boyfriend and i LOVE to go out and search for old houses
ans see if they are haunted. we found one one night that was in the middle of
nowhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my kids were with us , 12 yrs.
and 15yrs., and things were pretty quiet until we went up on the back porch to
go in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in front of us was this room that
our flashlights didnt seem to reach into even though it was only 5ft. away. for
some reason I told jerry( my boyfriend) not to go in there. he said ok and went
to the door on the right. things were pretty normal throughout the house until
we only had that room left to look at and I refused to go in until everyone
else did. you must realize that it is the middle of summer and at least 80 to
90 degrees out side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we went in and i
was slammed with this vision of a little girl being hurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to say what i was seeing and then
my boyfriend interupted me and started saying what he was seeing and it was the
exact same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he started looking at
some old news papers on the walls and all of the sudden the room got so cold
you could see your breath. My children and I stood back and all the sudden
jerry's shirt was pushed against his lower back. He shivered and pulled his
shirt down and went on reading and it done it again. We think it was the little
girl because when we finally left the house we all had this strange feeling of
being watched all the way home. after that strange things would happen around
the house like t.v. being turned on in the middle of the night or off while you
watch it and silverware flying across the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This didnt bother any of us because if it was
the little girl then she wasnt alone any more. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hi again, I wanted
you to also know about the house we found and named " The Growling
House".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we took a couple of friends
to this one. there was six of us this time . when we got there we walked around
the house. couldnt get too close because of the weeds and bushes but we were
able to go around to the back of the house and found a well and old sheds.
After a few minutes we went back around front intending to go through the front
door to look inside. Jerry would always go first to keep us safe but as soon as
he stepped inside there was this growl that seemed to come from every where.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I yelled for him to get out and as soon as we
all backed off about 10 to 15 ft. the growling stopped. Every time we tried to
approach the house it would start again then something else would happen to run
us off. T he second time we approached we were run off by huge bees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third time we were run off by bats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were scared out of our wits so got back in
our van but one of the girls with us was determined to go inside.Jerry went
with her and I staid in the van with the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took a couple of guns , just in
case,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and we watched thier flashlights
go toward the front of the house , then to the side but they stopped
short.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next they went back around front
and stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone in the van jumped
because all the sudden we heard rapid gun fire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We kept an eye on thier lights and all the sudden they came running
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They refused to go back up so we
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were driving off everyone
got the feeling that we werent alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the next 4 or 5 months after this my family and I were tormented
with things like the covers being yanked off my kids while they slept and
thrown across the room, the t.v.'s going off and on ALL night long every night,
a growling in my daughters room,all of us waking up with bad bruises,we could
hear someone walking around upstairs while we all were downstairs watching
t.v., jerry had a huge black smoky cloud rush across the room at him just to
disappear befor hitting him, I heard people talking outside my bedroom door one
day while the kids were at school and Jerry at work. When i opened the door the
voices stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we had a priest come by
and bless the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 2 wks. after
that jerry's son stopped by while I was home alone and as we sat talking the
door to upstairs opened and slammed VERY hard. We still hear from it sometimes
but not as mean.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Everything not in it's Place</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: yatahey_princesssummerstorm@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At the time I lived in the Allston-Brighton section of
Boston, MA, my family and I had several experiences with strange occurrences
that were attributed to &#8220;ghosts&#8221; or &#8220;poltergeist&#8221; activity, one of the
strangest was back in the early 1990&#8217;s.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In our apartment you could walk in 360-degree uninterrupted
circle. Now, the rear most bedroom had full visual unimpaired line-of-sight of
the bathroom, dinning room and kitchen. I was sitting in this rear bedroom on
the bed reading a book, and in the dinning room my friend Tiffany was playing
Solitaire, I think. Point is she was in the dinning room. The bathroom is in
the situated exactly midway between these two rooms. There was no one home but
the two of us. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I sat there reading, I heard this sound, &#8220;chink thump&#8220;. I
looked up expecting to see Tiffany trying to get my attention or something. I
didn&#8217;t see her and she made no vocal acknowledgment of the sound. I went back
to reading. A few moments later I decided I wanted to go get coffee or
something and as I passed the bathroom, I noticed the bathtub stopper was in
the middle of the bathroom floor. I thought little of it, picked it up and
placed it on the back right hand corner of the bathtub. Went, got my coffee,
and went back the bedroom and my reading. Shortly there after, I heard that
sound again; &#8220;chink thump&#8220;. Again I looked up expecting to see Tiffany, or hear
her call m or something&#8230;nothing. Again I thought little of it and went back to
reading. After I finished my coffee, I went to put the cup in the kitchen and
noticed the tub stopper back on the floor. Puzzled, I picked it up and put it
back, again, in the rear right hand corner of the tub. The cup placed in the
sink, I went back to reading, and shortly thereafter, again, I hear, &#8220;chink
thump&#8220;. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now this time I call out Tiffany &#8220; Did you hear that?&#8221;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She responses anxiously, &#8220;Yeah, that isn&#8217;t you? I thought
that was you before.&#8221;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220; No that is not me! I thought it was you. Look in the
bathroom and tell me if the tub stopper is on the floor.&#8221;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She gets up and comes toward me slowly and timidly looking
in the bathroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She almost whispers, &#8220;It&#8217;s on the floor&#8221;.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I do not remember what I said or did that made her come and
jump on the bed with me, but neither of us moved off that bed until the rest of
the household came home. And I had to use the bathroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I do not know how the stopper kept getting on the floor. If
either of us had gone in bathroom and put it there, we would have been highly
visible to the other. Plus the location where I put the stopper on the tub was
not one where it could have slipped and fallen on the floor, especially into
the middle of the floor. If you were facing the side of the bathtub, it would
have been on the right hand side furthest away from you in corner against the
wall. If it had fallen from there, it would have fallen in the tub, not across
the open tub to land in the middle of the bathroom floor. The other strange
thing was the order in which the sound was heard. It was a distinct &#8220;chink
thump&#8220;. With just enough pause in the middle to let one visual e the chain
hitting the floor before the stopper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Which, had it been thrown or had it fallen there, the two sounds would
have been closer together and the thump would have been heard first. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I still can&#8217;t figure it out, unless someone or something
just didn&#8217;t want that stopper on the back of the tub that night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One day my mother and I were at home alone taking a nap when
the phone rang.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom answered it and
it was the Mayo Heart Clinic confirming my father's appointment to check into
the hospital the following week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father didn't have any heart problems and hadn't been to the doctor in
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, his name is a very
common one and it was not unusual for us to get another "George
Smith"'s mail, bills even dry cleaning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mom told them that they must have the wrong "George Smith".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point, they gave my mom our address
and my father's social security number trying to determine if they had, indeed,
made a mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the information the
person on the phone gave was my father's.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Mom told them that there had obviously been some sort of
mistake since her husband was healthy and did not have heart problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next week (New Year's Eve) my father had
his first heart attack....on the very day the caller was trying to confirm as
his check-in date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never did figure
that one out.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I got married in November 1998.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Christmas my husband's father got sick
and it was determined that he needed emergency bypass surgery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We flew up to see him and spent Christmas
with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not do well but managed
to linger until February.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his
death we remodeled our house and put new furniture in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few months later the remote control to the
VCR disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We looked all over that
house...nothing!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately one of
the items of furniture we had broke and had to be replaced therefore the floor
was cleared of all items and vaccumed in preparation for the new piece to be
delivered, which it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Walking down
the hall after the arrival of the new piece I look down where it had been
placed and between the chair and the wall in plain sight was the missing remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now that floor had been totally bare and I
know for a fact that the remote was not there before.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">3 months later the remote to the TV disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again we searched everywhere to no
avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we were going to be
moving and I felt I'd find the remote in the process of packing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I packed the entire house by myself (husband
is a truck driver and was not at home)---no remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved everything and I unpacked
everything---again, no remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few
weeks later we went to the mountains for the weekend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got home, we sat down on the couch
and I happened to glance at the coffee table and, wouldn't you know it, there
sat that remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point I felt
that my husband's dad was with us and playing around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My daughter (12) and nephew (5) were playing with my
nephew's plastic dinosauers on her bed and they had used four throw pillows to
make "caves" for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
sitting in there when I heard them looking for a missing dinosauer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stopped what I was doing and looked under
all the pillows (putting them back into the "cave" position after
looking under them) and blankets on the bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally my daughter said "Grandpa, can I please have the dinosauer
back?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>about 10 seconds later one
of the "caves" fell open and there sat that dang dinosauer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had looked in that very spot and it was
NOT there!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter just looked at me
and said, "Thank you grandpa."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My nephew was curious about what was going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once my daughter explained it to him he
looked at me and asked if it was true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before I could answer the light in her room turned off for a few seconds
then back on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figure it was his way of
answering my nephew's question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband and I have now divorced and his dad must be
following him because we haven't had any more things disappear.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One story is a ghost story, the other one is just kind of
freaky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hope you enjoy them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know if they had not happened to me, I
would have a hard time believing it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This was about 5 years ago. Me and my sister were sleeping
in my bed, (her room was located at the back of the house and she often heard
noises so she usually got into my bed in my room at the front of the house.)
When all of a sudden my sister woke up. She looked to the right and she looked
out my window and she saw a face!! Then the story gets deeper, as she went back
to sleep she felt a hand pull her down and she fell off of my bed! I woke up
and all I saw was her on the floor. I asked her what her problem was and she
said, "The lady in the window pulled me off the bed."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in Smyrna for some time about six to seven miles
from the Stones River Battlefield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the last two years of my stay there i encountered some very odd things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my friend and I were sitting on my
porch and i was staring off into the distance not paying attention and i
thought i saw a little girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking it
was just my imagination, being 2a.m. or so, i brushed it off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a month or so later, keep in mind i
never told anyone, my boyfriend at the time was bringing me home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was there and all of the lights were
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we said our goodbye's my front
porch light switched on, and *Brian said who is that little girl walking across
the window? I told him to be quite but he kept saying he wasn't lying so i just
said whatever and went inside and fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About three months later it was storming outside and i was home
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My newfound boyfrind *Jake was
out with friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My phone was not
working, it was storming like crazy, and i was home alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&gt;From inside my house i heard a music box
playing rock-a-by-baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've never owned
a music box so i don't know where this sound could have came from.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>maybe what i saw was nothing maybe it wasn't
but im not lying about it or making anything up.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Possible Ghosts of U.S. Navy Sailors?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: White.Christopher@lincoln.navy.mil </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've been to the shadowlands site a few times, and read some
interesting stories (some have even made this sailor so afraid at times I tend
to get a bit paranoid-- espescially those dealing with U.S. Navy ships-- go
figure).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is the first time I've had a chance to write one in,
and I hope everyone finds this entertaining and interesting-- maybe even find
that these sort of things have happened to them, as well.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been in the Navy for 12 years now, and have some
things that are hard to believe, but nine times out of ten have a logical
explanation to how or why they happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But there were two incidents aboard my first ship, USS Curts (FFG-38)
that I seem to remember the most.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I checked onboard the Curts in Feb. '94, as it was leaving
Singapore (at that time, the ship was homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, near
Tokyo).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about a two-week cruise
back to our homeport, and as you can probably imagine, being a new sailor then,
I was a little overwhelmed by all the stresses involved with having to travel
half-way around the world to get to the ship, on top of that, being stationed
overseas (leaving home for the first time), and having to adapt to this new
environment.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So maybe this first experience was the stress, but it was
real enough for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was what made me
a "true believer" in the supernatural (although I had had some
questionable experiences before I joined).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, on the way back to Yokosuka, I was on a night watch
one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time, I was standing
an under instruction watch on the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My chief was standing Conning Officer (he gives course/speed orders and
helps w/ general navigation of the ship), and had authorized us (the guys on
watch) to smoke behind the pilothouse (for you land lubbers, that's the
bridge).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess it was sometime between
two and two-thirty am when I decided to go 'round back and burn one real
quick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I let Chief and the qualified guy
I was on watch with know I'd be out there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I stepped out into almost complete darkness (and it didn't
help that, even though I eventually got used to being up there, I'm afraid of
heights), except for the pale moonlight reflecting off the seas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I slowly (and probably over-carefully) felt
and slid my way back, until I was aft of the pilothouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I reached in my pocket, pulled out a smoke
and my lighter and lit up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was about a quarter of the way through my cigarette, when
I heard a door to the fire control space aft of the bridge open up and saw what
appeard to be another sailor come out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All I could make out was a silouette of a person, so naturally, I
assumed it was one of the guys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
what I could tell, he was wearing dungarees with a peacoat and what appeared to
be a white hat, a.k.a. "dixie cup" (for you newer squids, back in the
day, we did wear white hats with dungarees-- what y'all call utilities).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"Ya got a smoke?" he asked, and as I was new and
didn't know anyone on board yet, and was looking to make a few friends, I said
sure, reached into my pocket, grabbed the pack and opened it up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took one out, put it in his mouth, and
then asked for a light.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I pulled out my lighter again and was going to light it up
for him, when the light from the flame revealed that, the person who I gave a
cigarette to not more than thirty seconds ago, was not a sailor, but in fact
was not there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The flame also led me to look down to the deck, where I
found the cigarette.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This only happened once, which I find suprising since there
were many nights that were just as poorly lit (or even darker nights), or were
filled with bad weather.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second experience I remember was quite a bit more
blood-chilling, and ten times more dangerous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It happened about 18 months or so later, after I had been onboard
awhile, and had made Petty Officer Third Class (to y'all in the other branches,
I was an E-4).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was in charge of maintaining/inventorying our storeroom on
the fourth deck (about two decks below the waterline and about six decks down
from the bridge, where I normally worked).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never really liked going down there, hell, I hated going down there--
reason being, I always sensed another presence there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kind of like when you're in a room, and
you're doing something when someone else walks in and you don't look up to acknowledge
them, but you know they're there, except in this case, no one else was
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And add to that, the feeling of
being watched (that, and I had heard several stories of guys getting trapped
and dying in similar storerooms on various other ships).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On this particular day, I was alone in the storeroom,
inventorying our signal flags and parts for our searchlights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only other spaces in the area were the
sonar room and a small engineering space.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The sonar room was located just in front of the only ladder (stairs)
that led down into the area, and was locked (as it usually was in port), while
the smaller space adjacent to the storeroom door didn't have its own door, just
a single opening that led into it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
wasn't any other way to access either of these spaces (i.e., no other doorway).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ladder leading down to this area rattled
loudly whenever anyone walked on it, and I always heard it rattle from the
storeroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I unlocked the storeroom, opened the door, latched it open,
and went in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I set down my clipboard and
began counting flags and spare parts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About thirty minutes into my work, I heard the door close, almost as if
a slight breeze had eased it shut, and one of the individually operated dawgs
(door</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">latches-- there were eight on this particular door) come
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked over, and sure enough, my
ears didn't lie to me-- the door had closed, with one dawg down over the
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked over and opened the door
again, and thought to myself that I had surely latched the door open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then re-latched it open and checked the
area, thinking I hadn't heard anyone come down the ladder, and the person who
may have slipped by was just screwing with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First I checked the sonar room (which was locked from the outside with a
padlock)-- those of you in the Nav know how funny those sonar techs think they
are-- but no one there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next, I checked
the other, smaller space in front of the storeroom door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one there, either.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I then forced myself to shrug it off, and chalk it up to
being forgetful and having a vivid imagination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I proceeded with my work, hoping to get done before the chow line
secured, as I was almost working through lunch, and was wanting to get off
early that day so I could go party with the boys in <st1:City><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As my luck (the only kind I got, anyway)
would have it, I got the exact opposite of I had hoped for.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I started working again, and heard the door close again,
only this time as if someone had intentionally closed it, and two dawgs hit the
striker plates on the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stopped,
let out a deep breath, cursed God for having me here (something I did much of
in my younger days), and turned around, only to find my ears still held
true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew I had not heard anyone come
down the ladder, and knew that no one else was there, but once again checked
when I got outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My instincts were
right, but now my "sixth sense", I guess, kicked in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the top of the ladderwell before I
re-entered the storeroom to make sure nobody was there (and no one was),
inspected the door and the latch holding it open to see if the door had just
been popping loose, and re-latched the door two or three times just to make
sure I had done it (hey, this way I couldn't go wrong-- I knew I did it!).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I went back in, and hastily began counting flags and parts
(I think I even fudged a few numbers)-- by this time, I was feeling<span style="">&nbsp; </span>considerably paranoid, as was evident by the
goosebumps on my arms and the hair standing up on the back of my neck.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I rushed through, the door closed again, this time even
more forcefully-- not quite a slam, but awfully damn close-- with three dawgs
coming down.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This led to the same routine-- exiting, checking, latching
and re-latching, re-entering.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By now, I was shaking and sweating profusely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I purposely started writing down numbers
without actually counting, or just taking a quick peek at the shelves to see if
there was stuff there that wasn't on my list, or to check and see if items
listed as being low in quantity were still there or if we were out.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, the door closed with the hardest intensity I had
heard yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was as if someone, a
rather large, muscular someone, had intentionally slammed the door as hard as
they could, and two dawgs dropped down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran over to the door and lifted one of the
dawgs, another dropped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lifted one
more, and two dropped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one point, six
of the dawgs were dropped down-- it seemed like there was someone on the other
side dropping them faster than I could get them up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept thinking that I had to get out, I
wanted out, and I really felt sorry for the fucking asshole on the other side
of the door who thought it'd be funny to scare the piss and shit out of me, and
whether or not I should call medical immediately after I gave him the worst
ass-beating of his natural life, or if I should beat his ass, then go have a
couple of smokes and a soda, and give medical an "Oh, by the way..."
after the said smokes and soda.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I worked to get the door open for what seemed like hours
(although I'm sure it wasn't more than a couple of minutes), when the dawgs
finally stopped dropping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I burst
through the door yelling what ever obsenities that managed to make it out
of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my mouth without getting mixed up
with others (I was swearing more than any normal, healthy sailor really should,
if that gives you an idea), and swinging and kicking.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Much to my surprise (or maybe expectation?), there wasn't a
soul to been seen outside that door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
a single body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sonar still had the
padlock on the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one across from
the storeroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody at the top of the
ladder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just the feeling of an unknown
presence and of strong paranoia.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I half-muttered, half-growled another list of curses to
myself, and to anyone or anything down there with me, and ran up the ladder as
fast as I possibly could, vowing vengence upon my supervisor for sending me
down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got back up to the bridge
and grabbed my supervisor in probably the rudest way possible (it could have
gotten me in front of the old man-- the ship's commanding officer-- if you know
what I mean), and yanked him into the chartroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him, in no uncertain terms, that I
wasn't going back down to the storeroom ever, at least not alone, and if he
didn't like it, he could shove it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think it hit home-- he maintained the "deer-in-the-headlights" look
for several moments after that, and then developed the "I'm lost..."
look shortly thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didn't tell him what had happened until a couple of days
later when he asked if anything had happened while I was there.... the way he
asked was in the manner that he had a feeling something had happened, but
didn't know what.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said something
about some "funny vibes", "something not being right", and
"someone else" he thought was there, but wasn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I told him my story, he no longer sent
me down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he started sending
down other guys, two at a time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I never figured out what happened there, nor have I ever
heard of anyone else having a similar experience, save for some of the few
sonar techs that said once in a while, they also got the feeling they weren't
alone, either.</p>

ghost stories are rather small, and not really much to tell, but I still like
sharing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was about 11 years old
when both of them happened. My grandma lives about half a mile away from me,
and she got that house after the ex-owner, an old lady, had died there. Well
anyways, I was sleeping in the living room there, when all of a sudden I woke
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I see an old lady with a walker
walking from the living room into the kitchen. all I could do was hide under
the blankets. I know I wasn't dreaming because I even pinched myself to make
sure. Everything was normal, and there was nothing out of the ordinary. (Apart
from what I had just seen).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It couldn't
have been my grandma because she isn't that old and doesn't have a walker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second one I'm not so sure about. This
took place a couple of months after the first one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sleeping in the living room again, when
I woke up and looked to my left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then
saw a tall, grayish,square like figure just looking at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then hid under the covers again. After a
while, I figured it could've just been shadows or something. But as soon as I
looked back up, it was gone. Well those are my stories. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Another Strange story about the house I grew up in (see page
311 "Grammy's Ghost"). My father, who would always scoff at any tales
of the house being haunted, actually told me these. He said that my cousin's
ex-husband, who was now living with my father, was asleep in his bedroom
(strangely enough my old room) when at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2-3:00am</st1:time>
he felt as though he was being watched. He awoke to find an old man staring at
him. The old man then walked out of the room and turned right and walked down
the hallway. After he was out of view my cousin's ex said he could still hear
the footsteps going down the hallway. My father said that later that same
morning the cousin's ex came down and asked him why he didn't say anything
about the house being haunted. My father remained skeptical though until he was
alone in the house and he heard footsteps in the same hallway. He thought it
may have been one of my brothers who still live there, but when he called to
them no one was there and both brothers came home shortly thereafter. I never
felt threatened in the house, but I never felt comfortable when I was alone or
when my parents had gone away.</p>

anniversary of his passing. it was a couple days after this that i was out
side, it was about 10:00 pm and i felt sort of like a hand touch my shoulder. i
turned around and there was a small orb of light slowly bobbing up and down in
mid air. it was like a blueish color and it was about the size of a plum and it
slowly drifted down the stairs of my porch and slowly faded away into the
ground to where my dad died. i couldnt tell if it was my dad or my grandfather.
will it come back? i havent seen it since that night. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: gjp_80@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was staying at my aunty's home down in tasmaina where i
learnt very quickly the horrors of its past. Her home was built back in the
1900's when convictes first landed their home still has the remains of a moet,
servants head quaters and the hospital which it became.I went down with my
grandparents, they had warned meof the presents in the house. My grandfather
had seen a young girl in a long white gown holding a candle enter the spare
room as she vanished before his eyes. The very first night we arrived the fun
began. I was sleeping in my cousions room with them when i awoke to someone
calling to me, as i opened my eyes i saw two white fairies floating above me as
the light from the moon hit the room they vanished. From that night on as i
slept i could feel something touching my head. Around 4 days later as we all
slept smoke filled the rooms the strange thing was our door was open but
nothing entered. The next morning we awoke to find all the display plates which
a kept in a locked cardboard left lying on the floor in perfect order. 2 nights
later there was this huge storm and as the dogs had puppies they had got loose
and where running in the yard my aunty was woken my a frozen touch on her cheek
the man stood over her and pointed out the window once she left the room he
vanished. A few days later i got sick and was in the computer room with my
cousion as i wasnt allowed outside as i stare at a doll I swear it blint at me
I got out of there so fast. Later on that day i went to go to the toilet with
this house there is one large room which contains the laundry, bathroom and the
toilet as i entered this room the bathroom door wasnt quite shut and i saw a
man standing in there. I ran out of the room and when and asked my grandmother
who was in the shower as my cousions where in the room, my uncle and
grandfather were out the back in the shed and grandma and my aunty where in the
lounge room. After a few days feeling well i went back outside to play when i
was confranted by the man in the shower. I later found out that his name was
Shane and he had once owned the house he was found shot dead. Also while
playing outside hidden behind huge over growen trees was once appeared to be a
grave site, as i hearded for the house i saw the most grusome sight of a man
from the window under the house he was so distuted. thankfully after that day I
was heading home. They're since seen a little girl which skips around the
house, and hearded the screams of pain from the room down stairs thankfully i
didnt hear any thing like that. They did move out after that though.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I read about George at Kinder Cemetery, in St. Helens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I went there at 2 am one morning and made
a video to see if I could find me a ghost!!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, I did !!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very first
thing I said, after pressing record on my camera, is "George"?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard nothing, but got a chill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the video, you can clearly
hear a man reply "get back in your car" then, you can hear the sound
of me getting a chill! Seconds later, it is very clear that the head of a very
small child, appears to be rising from the ground, directly in front of a large
grave marker, titled, Andreas. there are no dates or other markings on the
stone, so it is impossible to tell if the marker belongs to this small child or
somebody else!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a very frightening,
yet, thrilling experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I highly
suggest, anybody in the mood for a good ghost hunt, go to Kinder cemetery.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I want to tell you of an experience I had alittle over a
year ago. I was living in a house on Bessemer Street in Youngstown, OHio. I
knew the house was haunted by a woman who was killed by her husband some years
before. (I was a baby when she died.) I think my room used to be her room. I
never felt comfortable sleeping there, so I often slept on the couch in the
livingroom. One night I woke up and felt like I could hardly breathe. I felt
like there was a tremendous weight on me, and I couldnt move or speak, except
for open my eyes. I opened my eyes and saw a HUGE black hooded figure at the
end of the couch, kinda leaning over it looking at me. Mind you, I couln't see
his eyes, Thank God.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I instantly slammed my eyes shut and kept trying to scream,
but couldn't. Everytime I opened my eyes, he was closer. Till he was right over
me. I took a deep breath in and started screaming. I woke my sons up. Needless
to say I got up and turned on every light in the house! I think it was death. I
don't know why he came to me. Not long after my grandmother passed away. (She
lived next door to me).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have more stories about that apartment if you want to
know. I also have a picture I believe is Teressa. (Thats who was haunting my
house.) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you for your time. And thank you for your website.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">i don't actually live with ghosts but at my uncles farm they
have a cabin it's going up for sale pretty soon but there is a ghost in the
cabin. The funny thing is that they just built it and no one has died in it or
anything. my cousin said that the ghost is a girl that follows him everywhere.
when my other cousin, my little brother and i, were watching a show in one of
the rooms, than we heard foot steps walking across the floor upstairs, we tried
to ignore it, than in the middle of the movie the movie screen went fuzzy. We
all stared at the television shocked, than my cousin screamed and my and my
brother and i screamed after her we ran out of the cabin we got to the house in
five seconds. apparently everyone heard us screaming and we told them what had
happened they told us the power probably flashed or something, but i still
don't believe that. Please email me back for more info.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted House</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our house was built in 1959. To my knowledge nothing ever
bad happened here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time we
noted anything was the mid 1970s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
moved here in 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both my husband and
I awoke in the night and saw the figure of a man walk across the room at the
foot of our bed and disappear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
husband jumped up and turned the light on and then ran throughout the house
looking for the intruder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was
found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Over the years we have heard noises coming from the bedroom
areas, doors closing when they are all open.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our neighbor has seen lights on in the middle of the night when we are
asleep. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few months ago, I was standing at the bathroom sink, mid
morning, and saw a man walk by. I thought it was my husband and when I walked
out to see where he went, he wasn't there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went back down the hall and he was still in the master bathroom and
had not walked down the hall.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day we were all sitting at the table and four of us
observed a can of Coke move across the table and stop before it fell off of the
edge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the basement on the carpet, a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>spot just became wet, even though I was the
only person down there this week. I scrubbed it up and so far it has remained
dry. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We hear the sound of the doggie door being opened and
closed, even though the dog is asleep in front of us.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There is far too many incidents to mention, but
interestingly enough, our dog never acts like she hears any of these unnatural
sounds, even though she barks at humans or dogs, etc outside. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I am only 13 (almost 14) but i think i have experienced
paranormal phenomenon. The first time was when I was about ten. I had gotten a
keyboard for christmas and it was set up with its stool in my room. I had just
gone to bed and just happened to look at the keyboard and a black cat weaved
itself through its legs. naturally i went screaming to my parents and they reassured
me it was nothing. Another time i awoke to a huge face floating in front of me.
Now it may have just been my imagination but i dont think so. On another
occasion i was in the shower and someone went sccccccc like they were trying to
say scary in a drawn out voice. I am the only one in my house that believes its
haunted. sometimes when my sister goes by my room to get to the bathroom she
snaps at me right before she enters the bathroom. Well one time i swear i heard
someone snap at me but when i turned around noone was there. I checked the
bathroom and my sister wasnt there my parents where in the living room and my
sister in hers. that one happened about a month ago. All the time i feel like
someone is watching me or is in the room with me whenever i am alone in a room
in my house even in my own room. sometimes when i go to bed i even make m
parents look in my closet. I have told my mother and my sister about it and
they dont seem to think anything is wrong and im just paranoid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Detroit :: Union Soldier</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A couple years ago I used to have to take the bus every day
to get to work. One morning in the late summer I was riding to work on the bus
traveling down Woodward in Detroit and I saw a man dressed entirely in a Union
soldiers uniform walking down the street. At first glimpse I didn't think
anything of it but when I looked around to see if anyone else noticed, and no
one did, I looked towards the window again and the guy was gone. I really don't
know if it was a ghost or not but I know he looked very real and very out of
place. To me it seemed just too hot to be wearing that uniform with the
muskett, cap, and everything. It all looked so very authentic. He was an
African American, looked old like in his 70's, and the uniform wasn't clean
like a reenactment guys..it was dingey. I would say this happened in late
August around 10:30 a.m.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A Couple of Ghosts on Board the USS Saipan Lha-2</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: boerjan@saipan.navy.mil</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am currently 22 years old, and stationed on the Uss Saipan
home ported in <st1:place><st1:City>Norfolk</st1:City>, <st1:State>VA.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have a couple that I've heard of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first and most creepy is a forward ammo
hold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of the AOs (ordinance
handlers) have always felt funny going into the space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, a couple of the AOs went to the
space with a video camera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon getting
close to the door a green dot appeared on the camera screen and started moving
around, and yet it wasn't visible without the camera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they got closer to the door, the dot went
away, the screen turned blue, then black then the red record light went
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later the camera's owner thought
about it, and realized that if his battery died, it would have all stopped at
once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon turning the camera back on, he
had half a charge, more than enough to keep recording.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hooked it up to a TV and watched the video
with his friends at the point where the camera shut off, the video turns into
pure snow...just like any other blank tape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rest is still there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of
the AOs will go to that hold unless ordered, and they don't even go by themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another <st1:place>Saipan</st1:place> ghost
is in an engineering space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If somebody
falls asleep below decks in the engineering spaces, and nobody wakes them up,
SOMEBODY wakes them up.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One story I've heard was that a guy was asleep, and while
asleep, somebody tapped him on the shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the navy we generally wake people up that way so no matter how deep
you sleep, a tap on the shoulder will wake you up.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyways, upon waking up he sees a figure go through a door
and dog it down.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Curious to see who woke him up, he goes through the door,
and nobody is there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's normally
credited to a death that happened onboard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the ladder wells leading down to the aft engineering spaces is
where the death occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sailor fell
down the stairs and died, and every night, between 0100 and 0200, the watch can
hear somebody falling down the stairs, but nobody is there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From time to time people witness a figure
walk out one door and into another in the engineering spaces, only to be gone
upon investigation.</p>
