<P>
<P><B>I'm 23 years old and I have had two strange experiences.</B>
<P><B>     I was born in Janesville, Wisconsin. Around our area we</B>
<P><B>     had alot of indian burial grounds. We even had a cave</B>
<P><B>     that was said to be an indian cave. Anyway, when I was</B>
<P><B>     six I was always awoken to hearing footsteps going up </B>
<P><B>     and down the stairs. Usually about 2 or 3 in the morning.</B>
<P><B>     I'd go in the living room to the steps with my blankets </B>
<P><B>     around me and turn on the lights. There would be nothing</B>
<P><B>     there. I would tell my mother about the noises and she</B>
<P><B>     would always tell me that it was the house settling.</B>
<P><B>        I understand that a house settles but this sounded </B>
<P><B>     like a person running up and down the steps. I remember </B>
<P><B>     something else. Since I was six it's pretty hard to remember</B>
<P><B>     exactly what happened, but it was enough for me to still</B>
<P><B>     remember it today. Like everybody else It makes me shiver.</B>
<P><B>     I remember walking down the steps and going thru the basement
door</B>
<P><B>     and looking behind me, I saw a grey figure. No feature just 2
eyes and</B>
<P><B>     a very devilish smile. I don't know what happened after I seen
that. </B>
<P><B>     It might have been a dream. The running of the steps however I
know </B>
<P><B>     for a fact. Even being six.</B>
<P><B>        My second experience is the worse. I was sixteen. I moved from
the </B>
<P><B>     house in Wisconsin when I was nine and moved to Delaware. I went
to my </B>
<P><B>     grandmothers house in New Jersey with my parents one night. I
used her </B>
<P><B>     bathroom in her masterbedroom. It was late. I could hear my parents
</B>
<P><B>     and grandparents talking in the kitchen. Noone else was there.
I had </B>
<P><B>     the door shut. I heard little footsteps, almost like a childs.
I heard </B>
<P><B>     really heavy breathing. It came closer and closer to the door.
All of </B>
<P><B>     sudden it stopped. I pulled my pants up and ran into the kitchen.
I </B>
<P><B>     sat at the table and stayed in the kitchen the whole night with
my </B>
<P><B>     parents. I never told anybody. When I turned 21 I stopped at my
</B>
<P><B>     grandparents before going to Atlantic city with my friends. My
uncle </B>
<P><B>     Mike lives there with my grandparents now. We got on the subject
of </B>
<P><B>     hauntings and I began to tell my Uncle about the strange occurence.
He </B>
<P><B>     looked at me with wide eyes and said" Oh my, god, that happened
to me </B>
<P><B>     last month." He told me in detail exactly what happened to him.
Me and </B>
<P><B>     him sat motionless just starring at eachother for about 5 minutes.
We </B>
<P><B>     both had goosebumbs. My grandparents still live in the house.
Whenever </B>
<P><B>     I go over I never use that bathroom. This is completely the truth.
It </B>
<P><B>     almost seems like a dream. But its not. I'm actually happy I have
an </B>
<P><B>     experience to tell. </B>

<H3><A NAME=boyfriend>Boyfriend's Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by kath417@u.washington.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>My boyfriend used to work at the company near waterfront.  Sometimes
he</B>
<P><B>had so much work to do he had to stay till midnight!  Well, that was
one</B>
<P><B>of those nights.  After he finished working, he had about 45 min left
till</B>
<P><B>his last bus home.  So he desided to take a walk along the
waterfront.</B>
<P><B>This was one of those cold October days (like now) in Seattle.  He
was</B>
<P><B>walking by the Marina and watching all those boats and ships roacking
on</B>
<P><B>the water.  One of the ships cought his attention the most.  It was
an old</B>
<P><B>rickedy ship that didn't even look like it was functional anymore.
 The</B>
<P><B>strangest thing about it was that it had a gangplank and an opening,
so</B>
<P><B>that anyone can practically walk in.  So, being so curious as he was
(it</B>
<P><B>was a long time ago and he was kind of young and dumb, now he
wouldn't</B>
<P><B>have done that) he desided to go in and check it out.  The place had</B>
<P><B>nothing in it, no furniture, no electronics, no controls to guide the</B>
<P><B>thing, no wheel to stear.  It was dark and spooky, the floors were</B>
<P><B>squicking and almost ready to break on him.  The whole place was
giving</B>
<P><B>him creeps.  It obviously stayed there for a long long time, since
there</B>
<P><B>was no way it could move even an inch!</B>
<P>
<P><B>He walked into what was like some sort of a room.  The room looked
empty</B>
<P><B>and it had nothing but an old chair in the middle of it.  he sat on
the</B>
<P><B>char and started to light up his sigarete.  Out of nowhere he started
to</B>
<P><B>hear sounds of someone breathing.  He also heard some movement that
realy </B>
<P><B>scared the crap out of him. when he stood up from the chair, he saw
some</B>
<P><B>shadows move.  Now, he thought he've had it and started to walk
towards</B>
<P><B>the door out.  All of a sudden, the doorway got blocked by the figure
of a</B>
<P><B>big man, dressed up in old close.  "What are you doing here?" the man</B>
<P><B>asked him "and why are you here?  Are you a cop?"  "No", my boyfriend</B>
<P><B>answered, but what are you doing here.  The big man didn't say
anything</B>
<P><B>but just stared back at him with that emotionless stare of someone
who is</B>
<P><B>extremely tired.  My boyfriend also heard some movement in the back
of the</B>
<P><B>room, so he turned around and he saw a woman with two young children.
 My</B>
<P><B>boyfriend then understood that this must be a family that doesn't have
a</B>
<P><B>home, so they just live on this boat.  he felt sorry for them, gave
an old</B>
<P><B>man 20 bucks and quickly got out of the ship.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>As he was heading back, two cops stoped him and asked him what was
he</B>
<P><B>doing on that boat.  He said that he was just looking around.</B>
<P><B>The cops were really suspecious (as they always are).  they though
he was</B>
<P><B>shooting up some drugs or something like that, so they asked some
more</B>
<P><B>questions.  My boyfriend finally told them that he saw a family down
there</B>
<P><B>(I don't think he should of done that)  The cops got really surprised
and</B>
<P><B>took him back to the ship with them to look for that family.  the
thing</B>
<P><B>is, he was talking to cops right next to that gangplank of that ship
and</B>
<P><B>that was the only entrance to the ship, there is no way they could
of</B>
<P><B>jumped into that freezing water and there were not a place to hide.
 those</B>
<P><B>cops had flashlights and they looked all over the ship and couldn't
find</B>
<P><B>nothing but that 20 bucks that he gave to an old man, lying on the
floor</B>
<P><B>of that room where he went.  Needless to say, my boyfrind had some</B>
<P><B>explanations to do with those cops.  After making sure he was
alright,</B>
<P><B>they let him go home.</B>
<P>
<P><B>the next morning when my boyfriend went back to work, he went back
to that</B>
<P><B>place.  All the ships and boats were in place...except for that one.
 he</B>
<P><B>couldn't see that ship ever again.</B>

<H3><A NAME=died>After Grandma Died</A>
</H3><P><B>by sandee@kntv.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandmother died on Mother's day 3 years ago.  A few days before,
she</B>
<P><B>was at home with my grandfather and began not feeling well.  I didn't</B>
<P><B>get a whole run down of the situation, but apparently, she had a
really</B>
<P><B>bad headache and called to my grandpa.  I think that she must have</B>
<P><B>passed out, because an ambulance was called and she was transported
to</B>
<P><B>the local hospital.  She never regained consciousness, and the Drs
said</B>
<P><B>that she had had a massive brain hemmorage and even if she had been
at</B>
<P><B>the front steps of the hospital there was nothing that anyone would
have</B>
<P><B>been able to do.  My mom and her siblings gathered and decided to
have</B>
<P><B>her removed from life support (at this point there was no brain</B>
<P><B>activity).  My grandmother lingered until all of her children were
able</B>
<P><B>to gather to say their final goodbyes.  She finally passed away on</B>
<P><B>Mother's day.  There was only one person out of the whole family that</B>
<P><B>didn't get a chance to say goodbye...that was me.  My son was very
young</B>
<P><B>at the time and I had no sitter, both my parents as well as most of
my</B>
<P><B>closest relations were unable to sit with him...so I never made it
to</B>
<P><B>the hospital to say goodbye.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, fast forward past the usual funeral stuff.  Shortly after</B>
<P><B>grandma's passing, strange things started happening to me.  The first</B>
<P><B>incident happened when I was reading a book...a small lamp just
clicked</B>
<P><B>on for no reason...as if someone was telling me that I didn't have</B>
<P><B>enough  light to read by.  After that, a small television that I had
in</B>
<P><B>my room would turn on and off, usually this happened late at night
after</B>
<P><B>midnight.  The last time it happened (after that I just unplugged the
TV</B>
<P><B>when I went to bed) it flicked on and off a whole bunch of times and</B>
<P><B>finally stayed on...the show currently on?  A local psychic show!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>I talked to my mom about it and she said that because I didn't get
a</B>
<P><B>chance to go to the hospital before grandma passed, that she was</B>
<P><B>probably just coming around to see how I was doing and make me feel
a</B>
<P><B>little better (I felt like a total heel for not making more of an
effort</B>
<P><B>to see her).  I finally had a short chat with my grandma but wasn't
sure</B>
<P><B>if she heard me or not...I said that I was really sorry that I didn't</B>
<P><B>get a chance to see her before she passed and that I missed her a
whole</B>
<P><B>lot.  It must have worked because all the strange occurrences stopped</B>
<P><B>happening after that.</B><HR>

<H3><A NAME=talk>Ghosts that Like to Talk</A>
</H3><P><B>by shmoomax@Dreamscape.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am writing this, because it is good to know that we are not the
only</B>
<P><B>ones to admit to ghosts.  </B>
<P><B>	We have been in this house for seven years.  Almost from the start
we</B>
<P><B>have heard voices.  At night, you can hear someone talking in the</B>
<P><B>house.  It is like if you listen to someone in the other room, you
can</B>
<P><B>hear them talking, but, you can't understand what they are saying.
 My</B>
<P><B>husband has heard this,too.  Though it took him awhile to admit it
to</B>
<P><B>me.  </B>
<P><B>	As time goes on, they get more open.  One night we were sitting in
the</B>
<P><B>family room.  My dog, Sadie, was sound asleep on the floor.  All of
a</B>
<P><B>sudden, she bolted upright, into a sitting position.  She stared past
me</B>
<P><B>into the laundry room that connects to the kitchen.  She didn't bark,
or</B>
<P><B>even look at us.  She just stared past me.  I, of course, asked my</B>
<P><B>husband to check it out.  My dog would not go into the kitchen, not
even</B>
<P><B>for a treat.   My husband said it was ice cold in there, even though
it</B>
<P><B>was 80 outside, and we do not have air conditioning.  It took over
half</B>
<P><B>an hour for Sadie to feel comfortable enough to venture into the
other</B>
<P><B>room.</B>
<P><B>	Since then, things have gotten more exciting.  I was home by myself
for</B>
<P><B>the weekend.  Around 9:00pm, I was on the computer.  The back door
was</B>
<P><B>shut, locked and checked as all doors are when I am by myself. All
of a</B>
<P><B>sudden, the door blew open.  There wasn't any wind outside, and the</B>
<P><B>handle of the door was unlocked.  </B>
<P><B>	A couple of days after that, I was in the kitchen, making coffee.
 To</B>
<P><B>set this up:  my dish drain sits in the sink.  Not on the counter.
 A</B>
<P><B>plastic bowl flew out of the dish drain and landed about four feet
from</B>
<P><B>the sink.  Now here I am, talking out loud asking why they can't do
this</B>
<P><B>stuff when my husband is here to witness it.</B>
<P><B>	Since I have had my computer, about one and a half months, I have
had</B>
<P><B>another occurence.  Twice, while sitting at the computer I have felt</B>
<P><B>someone come up behind me.  The first time I said,"hi hon", assuming</B>
<P><B>that it was my husband.  When I turned around he wasn't any where</B>
<P><B>around.  He was in the back of the house.  The second time it happened
I</B>
<P><B>saw a shadow at the same time I felt someone behind me.  This time
I was</B>
<P><B>sure it was my husband.  Again, I said,"hi hon".  From the other room
my</B>
<P><B>husband yelled,"who are you talking to?".  I replied, "no one dear".
 </B>
<P><B>	We continue to hear the voices.  They are not frightening.  I have
had</B>
<P><B>times when I have gotten up to see if the television was on.  We have</B>
<P><B>gotten used to them.  Hopefully, they are happy to be with us, and
don't</B>
<P><B>plan on anything too drastic.</B>

<H3><A NAME=woman>Ghost Woman with an Umbrella</A>
</H3><P><B>by rxmason@uswest.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>We moved into an older house in Beaverton, Oregon.  One night my wife</B>
<P><B>awoke in the middle of the night and saw a figure of a heavy set
woman</B>
<P><B>(to large for Mary Poppins) dressed in dark clothing, holding an</B>
<P><B>umbrella, standing near our bed.  My wife watched the figure for
awhile,</B>
<P><B>then went back to sleep.  My wife said that at the time, she didn't
feel</B>
<P><B>concerned about the ghosts presence in our room.  Since Portland gets
a</B>
<P><B>lot of rain, the umbrella seemed appropriate.  We speculated that she</B>
<P><B>was perhaps a neighborhood ghost, checking out the new people who had</B>
<P><B>moved in the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time, a few years earlier, when my wife was pregnant, I awoke</B>
<P><B>in the middle of the night and thought I saw my wife sitting up in
bed.</B>
<P><B>Then, as I looked more closely, I realized my wife was asleep laying</B>
<P><B>flat in the bed.  There was a young woman, with long hair, wearing
light</B>
<P><B>colored clothing, sitting on top of where the baby lump was.  I
watched</B>
<P><B>for a long time, and then said something like "Will you look at that".
</B>
<P><B>At that point, the apparition disappeared in front of me.  I think
it</B>
<P><B>was our son's guardian angel or spirit.</B>

<H3><A NAME=crazy>Am I crazy?</A>
</H3><P><B>by TERNAM@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a 26 year old female, and I try not to believe haunting ghost
stories.  I believe there are spirits, and I believe that woman on Oprah
who talks to spirits.  I live in an apartment with two other women.  We all
have our own bedrooms.  I had programmed my VCR to tape a midnight marathon
TV show this past May.  I had set my VCR to tape from 12 am to 6 am.  I fell
asleep by 12:30.  At about 2:30am, I felt a presence standing by my bed.
 I kept my eyes closed, because I guess I was afraid. My eyes felt pretty
heavy, like when you are not totally awake, but sort of consious of what
is around you.  Anyway, my T.V. was off, but the VCR was recording.  I could
hear the hum it makes.  Then I heard the VCR switch off.  For some reason
I thought my roommate came in and turned it off and that was the presence
I felt.  When I didn't feel the presence anymore, I opened my eyes, and checked
the clock.  That's how I knew it was only 2:30.  Then I got up, and checked
to see if the tape had run out.  It hadn't. I reprogrammed the VCR, and went
back to sleep.  I was baffeled by why either of my roommates would come into
my room and turn off my VCR.  We don't do that kind of stuff for each other,
and we would never go into each other's rooms while we were sleeping.  I
asked my roommates if they had come in my room at about 2:30, and switched
off my VCR.  They both looked at me as if I were crazy.   They said they
didn't get in until about 3 or later.  Since then, I have felt a presence
twice in the morning just as I am waking up.  Each time I am afraid to open
my eyes, or they feel as if I can't open them.  I can hear my roomates in
the bathroom, and in the kitchen getting ready for work, so I know I am awake
on some level.  Am I dreaming this stuff?  I know that VCR turned off, I
had to reprogram it.  This probably isn't as exciting as other stories, but
I wonder if you have an explaination for me. </B>

<H3><A NAME=kentucky>Haunting in Kentucky</A>
</H3><P><B>by amrobe02@ulkyvm.louisville.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>My story will seem strange to most, but it is true.  I recently moved
in</B>
<P><B>with a long time friend of mine.  There had been some strange things</B>
<P><B>happen in his house for many years.  His family built the house and
has</B>
<P><B>lived there for around 35 years.  Three out of the four children in
the</B>
<P><B>family claim to have seen apparitions or felt something unusual.  All
of</B>
<P><B>three of them actually saw things when they were very young.  As they</B>
<P><B>got older, they usually only felt a presence.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I moved in, I noticed strange things happening.  I had always
felt</B>
<P><B>there was something special about the house, but not scary.  On
several</B>
<P><B>occasions, I would think I heard my friend yelling for me.  Then I
would</B>
<P><B>go to where he was and he would not have said a word.  One night, I</B>
<P><B>thought I heard my son calling for me.  I went to his bedroom to
check</B>
<P><B>on him and he was sound a sleep.  I have also been standing in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen and felt like someone was behind me.  I would start talking
to</B>
<P><B>them because I would think it was someone in the family.  When I turn</B>
<P><B>around, no one is there.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I first moved in, I was asleep in downstairs bedroom and I was</B>
<P><B>having a very strange, very detailed dream.  I was dreaming about a</B>
<P><B>woman telling me she was going to knock the gun rack off the wall.
She</B>
<P><B>was very insistant and very rude.  I had never seen anyone like this</B>
<P><B>before in my life.  In my dream, I was argueing with her, but she
kept</B>
<P><B>insisting.  That night, I awoke to a loud crash.  It scared me, but
I</B>
<P><B>was too sleepy to get up and check it out.  The next morning, the gun</B>
<P><B>rack was on the floor.  We couldn't understand how it could have</B>
<P><B>fallen.  It had been up there for years.  When we took a closer look,</B>
<P><B>the nail in the wall had actually been bent.  We couldn't pin another</B>
<P><B>explanation on it.  This was only one of many things I have
experienced,</B>
<P><B>but it would only bore you to tears.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A couple of years previous to this, my friend's sister had an</B>
<P><B>experience.  She pulled up the driveway that night and thought she
saw</B>
<P><B>here niece running down the stairs that led to the basement.  She
pulled</B>
<P><B>on up the driveway, but she didn't see her brother's vehicle anywhere.
</B>
<P><B>She jumped out of the car and ran to the stairwell and saw nothing.
 She</B>
<P><B>said she got the chills.  She said the apparition looked like a young</B>
<P><B>girl around 10-years-old with blond hair.  She had on a coat.  That's</B>
<P><B>all she could remember.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The strange thing about this is, there have not been many occurences
of</B>
<P><B>actually seeing a "ghost".  About a year back, we all sat down and</B>
<P><B>talked about our experiences.  We all agreed that what is there isn't</B>
<P><B>bad.  We each talked about how we feel safe in the house, like
something</B>
<P><B>is there to protect us.  Everyone had a very sentimental attachment
to a</B>
<P><B>certain tree in the yard also.  Everyone of them has had a paranormal</B>
<P><B>experience around this tree.  I would like to research who owned the</B>
<P><B>property before my friend's family bought it.  I was told that there
was</B>
<P><B>a house somewhere on the property where the woods are now.  If I do
find</B>
<P><B>out, I will share it with you.  Everyone seems to think that the</B>
<P><B>presence is a child.  I believe that it either changes form or there
is</B>
<P><B>more than one.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>My friend had told me a story about playing hide and seek with a
group</B>
<P><B>of neighborhood kids when he was little.  He trying to find his
brother</B>
<P><B>when he thought he had spotted him under the big tree (the same one)
in</B>
<P><B>the yard. He said he ran over to tag him and it was boy lying on his</B>
<P><B>belly with his head in his hands.  The boy smiled at him and he said
he</B>
<P><B>realized that it wasn't his brother and he ran.  He says it was a
young</B>
<P><B>Indian boy.  In the area where his property is located, many Indian</B>
<P><B>artifacts have been found.  I don't doubt that it isn't an Indian boy.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>It's really hard to explain the feeling you get when you go into
their</B>
<P><B>house.  After living there for several months, I am beginning to feel
it</B>
<P><B>more and more.  I'm not afraid to stay there by myself.  It feels safe.
</B>
<P><B>BUT it's not just in the house.  Every one of us have felt the same</B>
<P><B>feeling in the woods, by the tree and just sitting out on the back</B>
<P><B>porch.  It seems to be occupying the entire property.  I know this</B>
<P><B>sounds very strange, but it's very true.  I hope to find out more
about</B>
<P><B>the history of the property in hopes of determining why the "ghost"
is</B>
<P><B>there.</B>

<H3><A NAME=dream>Dream Haunting in Atlanta, Georgia</A>
</H3><P><B>by karielb@qtm.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several years ago, I had a dream. One of those that you wake up from
all</B>
<P><B>covered in sweat, and scared. The dream recurred twice within days
after</B>
<P><B>the first dream. It is interesting because I have never stayed in</B>
<P><B>Atlanta, only driven through on my way somewhere else. But in a dream,
I</B>
<P><B>was there, and I want to know if this house, that I saw in my dreams</B>
<P><B>really exists. I think that it does. I think I was being sent a
message,</B>
<P><B>but I was not certain at the time what to do about a place I had
never</B>
<P><B>been, and a haunting that I could not resolve.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I dreamed of Atlanta, not the city, a rural place not far from the
city.</B>
<P><B>I sensed as you do in dreams, that we were very near Atlanta. In the</B>
<P><B>dream, my husband, children and I had had to move there. We bought
this</B>
<P><B>house, a very large white clapboard house, one level, with a large</B>
<P><B>attic. It had pillars and a front porch that wrapped around the
entire</B>
<P><B>front of the house. The road leading to the house is a red clay dirt</B>
<P><B>road. The road winds and is heavily tree lined. In fact, it is easy
to</B>
<P><B>drive past the driveway, nearly choked off by the overhanging tree</B>
<P><B>branches and brush. The drive is circular and loops in front of the</B>
<P><B>house passing within just a few feet of the huge plankboard front
porch</B>
<P><B>steps. There are large front windows flanking a large heavy wood
paneled</B>
<P><B>front door with a small clear pane of oval glass set in it. There is
no</B>
<P><B>doorknob on the door, it is a large worn brass latch pull handle with
a</B>
<P><B>deadbolt lock set above it. It was summer, hot and dry. It was
August,</B>
<P><B>mid month, I think. We had to go inside and I didn't want to. The
house</B>
<P><B>was really pretty. I liked the house, in fact I thought it was really</B>
<P><B>rather charming, but I did not like the idea of "entering" the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We parked the car, got a few bags, walked up the big board steps to
the</B>
<P><B>door, unlocked the door and everyone in my family piled into the</B>
<P><B>livingroom ahead of me. Everyone really loved the house, it had a
huge</B>
<P><B>livingroom or greatroom, with a large field stone fireplace on the
east</B>
<P><B>wall, a beautiful braided rug, wonderful overstuffed sofas and
chairs,</B>
<P><B>and floor lamps, including a Tiffany. South was the kitchen and
dining</B>
<P><B>area, and off the kitchen swing around to the west were bedrooms and</B>
<P><B>baths. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The problem came from a coat closet immediately to my right, or on
the</B>
<P><B>west wall next to the front door. The house had dark walnut or darkly</B>
<P><B>stained oak doors and trim throughout. This small closet door stood
only</B>
<P><B>about 6 high, and was very narrow. Standing just inside the front
door</B>
<P><B>next to this closet door I felt drained and cold, not freezing, just</B>
<P><B>slightly chilled, and the worst feeling of absolute cold terror
welling</B>
<P><B>up inside my head and chest. It is the kind fear you first feel when
you </B>
<P><B>first learn something is terribly wrong with a loved one. Horrible</B>
<P><B>feeling of terror and sadness. Of being in terrible emotional pain.</B>
<P><B>Sorrow. I felt certain in that moment in my dream, that I was
standing</B>
<P><B>next to a door that I should never in my life open. But in my dream
as</B>
<P><B>in my real life, I did open it. It was a coat closet, empty, save for
a</B>
<P><B>few old wire hangers, dark inside with a hanging bulb light. Empty
and</B>
<P><B>cold inside. But definately not haunted, I felt nothing inside the</B>
<P><B>closet. But after I closed the closet door, I looked at the door of
the</B>
<P><B>closet, the door itself..made my heart ache, and my fears welled up</B>
<P><B>inside of me again, terrible feelings of dread. I knew in that moment</B>
<P><B>someone in the house was now, right then and now, and for as long as
I</B>
<P><B>continued to live in the  house...watching me. It was such a real</B>
<P><B>feeling of needing be out and away, that I cannot describe it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I awoke. But twice more I dreamed of the house, of moving day, of the</B>
<P><B>door to the closet, all the fears returned. The presence had no</B>
<P><B>identity, no sense of male or female. Only of being closed in on...of</B>
<P><B>being watched. And with each repeat of the dream more details of the</B>
<P><B>inside of the house were seen. I know every square inch of that
house,</B>
<P><B>nothing is frightening in the house except the door of the coat
closet</B>
<P><B>near the front door. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I would love to know if the house exists. I think it is northwest of
the</B>
<P><B>city. The dream was too vivid, too many colors and details were seen,
I</B>
<P><B>know too much about a house I was never in. I feel I was there, if</B>
<P><B>anyone reads this story and thinks they might know something of this</B>
<P><B>house, I would be interested in hearing from them.</B>

<H3><A NAME=pub>Essex Pub</A>
</H3><P><B>by CHazell@uwic.ac.uk </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a story that a friend of mine told me. When she was a young</B>
<P><B>girl, about nine or ten I think, her parents moved house, and moved
into</B>
<P><B>a working pub in Essex, England. Right from when she moved in she had
a</B>
<P><B>bad feeling about the place and she told her parents as much. Her dad</B>
<P><B>wasn't one to believe this sort of thing and put it down to a child's</B>
<P><B>imagination. The pub itself is a large two story building dating from</B>
<P><B>about 1850-1860. The family lived in the first floor and the 'pub'
area</B>
<P><B>is on the ground floor, the pub also has an extensive cellar where
the</B>
<P><B>beer is stored.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She always felt that something bad was in the pub, to use a clich&eacute;
a</B>
<P><B>'presence'. She had lived in the pub for about 2 months, keeping her</B>
<P><B>worries to herself as she didn't want to tell her mum or dad again.
Her</B>
<P><B>dad used to get her to help out in the pub, getting bottles and
crisps</B>
<P><B>and such like from the cellar. She said she never felt comfortable
doing</B>
<P><B>this. During this time she also noticed that the door to the cellar</B>
<P><B>would be open in the morning when she came down for breakfast, she</B>
<P><B>started to note that at night it was always closed then the next
morning</B>
<P><B>would be open. Her parents started to become more and more
argumentative</B>
<P><B>during this period and her dad would often ignore her. He accused her
of</B>
<P><B>stealing crisps and drink from the cellar because of the door always</B>
<P><B>being open in the morning, and because of this he got a padlock for
the</B>
<P><B>door. The first night the door was padlocked, it was open again in
the</B>
<P><B>morning. She couldn't have opened the door as she had no idea where
the</B>
<P><B>key was, and her parents insisted it wasn't them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was around this time that she started getting really spooked about</B>
<P><B>the cellar and made an effort to avoid it. She told me she felt the</B>
<P><B>presence was a 'bad thing', 'low down' but at the same time 'high
up'.</B>
<P><B>She was becoming more agitated, and told her mum. Her mum now
admitted</B>
<P><B>she had felt uncomfortable in the house, particularly the cellar.
They</B>
<P><B>both decided to go to the local library and investigate the history
of</B>
<P><B>the house. They discovered that around 1900 a landlord of the pub had</B>
<P><B>killed his wife, in the cellar. He had hung her from one of the large</B>
<P><B>meat hooks that were still in the roof beams when she lived there.
She</B>
<P><B>said this explained the feeling of low down, the cellar, but high up,</B>
<P><B>the hook. About two months after she found this her parents divorced</B>
<P><B>because they argued constantly. </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story might sound made up but ever since the murder took place,
not</B>
<P><B>one landlord and wife have lived in the pub and not ended in
premature</B>
<P><B>death of one or more commonly divorce. In fact the brewery chain who
own</B>
<P><B>the pub now refuse to let the pub to couples because of this. Shortly</B>
<P><B>after leaving the pub my friend came to live in my house, which was
a</B>
<P><B>large converted guild hall in rural Suffolk. The house had an old
part</B>
<P><B>dating from about 1400 and a newer section from about 1620. It was</B>
<P><B>situated next to the local church which was built in about 1200.</B>
<P><B>Although I never experienced anything (I was five at the time) my
friend</B>
<P><B>said she felt someone watching her in her bedroom, and she felt she
was</B>
<P><B>never alone in that room. She said she didn't feel it in any other</B>
<P><B>rooms. It is interesting to note that when she was moved rooms so
that</B>
<P><B>my parents could renovate the roof and ceiling, the whole roof and</B>
<P><B>ceiling collapsed, and was held up by only three nails. I don't know
why</B>
<P><B>she felt what she did, I have never known the history of the house.
I</B>
<P><B>myself have also never been subject to anything that might be
described</B>
<P><B>as strange, or outside normal childhood paranoia, but for all this,
I</B>
<P><B>believe what she told me. In her case there appears to be evidence
to</B>
<P><B>support what she said.</B>

<H3><A NAME=home>Haunting at a Friend's Home</A>
</H3><P><B>by lepchick@mindspring.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>In my life, I have seen, heard, and felt hundreds of unexplainable
things.</B>
<P><B>Most of these things have been harmless, like the ghost who lived in
my</B>
<P><B>apartment building in college, who would read the newspaper over your</B>
<P><B>shoulder, or turnthe television on in the living room to get your
attention.</B>
<P><B>But one experience in particular frightens me to this day.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A friend of mine and I, I'll call him "Joe," went to call on some
mutual</B>
<P><B>freinds on a Saturday afternoon.  Our friends, "Dan" and "Mike" were</B>
<P><B>brothers, Dan being the younger of the two.  Dan and Mike's family
had moved</B>
<P><B>into a new house six months earlier.  The house had been built just
after</B>
<P><B>WWII in one of those neighborhoods built to supply returning G.I.'s
with</B>
<P><B>affordable housing so they could get back into the swing of life and
raise</B>
<P><B>families.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Dan and Mike had always been outgoing young men, the lives of the party,
as</B>
<P><B>it were.  However, since moving into the new house, both of them (Mike
more</B>
<P><B>so than Dan) had begun to change.  The day Joe and I called on them,
it was</B>
<P><B>our first visit to the new house. Both Joe and I are extremely sensitive
to</B>
<P><B>paranormal activity.  From the minute we enterd the front door, we
knew</B>
<P><B>something was awry. We entered Dan's bedroom upstairs, and the feelings
of</B>
<P><B>fear subsided, somewhat. We felt that that room was a "safe place"
in the</B>
<P><B>house.  But on moving towards the basement, we knew that was where
whatever</B>
<P><B>it was that was in the house was centered.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The four of us marched down the stairs to watch television in the
family</B>
<P><B>room in the basement.  Right after the bottom of the stairs on the
left side</B>
<P><B>were two doors.  The second was the laundry/utility room, and the first
was</B>
<P><B>Mike's bedroom.  Sitting on the couch, the doors were to our right.
 Right</B>
<P><B>from the start, Joe and I felt sick.  There was something like an
energy</B>
<P><B>force eminating from Mike's bedroom.  It came out in pulses, very
strong,</B>
<P><B>ans it was making Joe and I sick to our stomachs.  Mike said we could
watch</B>
<P><B>one of his movies, and went to his room to retrieve the tape.  Just
as Mike</B>
<P><B>opened his door, a huge black wave came pouring out into the basement.
 I</B>
<P><B>was frozen in fear.  The only words I can use to describe the feeling
was</B>
<P><B>one of pure evil.  Joe grabbed my arm, and screamed for all of us to
run.</B>
<P><B>We vaulted up the stairs &amp; didn't stop until we hit the neighbours'
yard</B>
<P><B>where we collapsed, exhausted from sheer terror.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After that experience, we did a bit of digging and found out that the
house</B>
<P><B>had been for sale for some time before Dan and Mike's parents bought
it.  We</B>
<P><B>also found out why.  The family who had lived there before had died
in the</B>
<P><B>house.  The father had killed his wife and son, and then himself. 
In Mike's</B>
<P><B>bedroom.  Whether there had been anything there before, or what the
land was</B>
<P><B>before it was a neighbourhood, we were never able to dig up.  So if
it was</B>
<P><B>the people or the place that caused the disturbance, we are not sure.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Mike and Dan's family has since moved from the house, and I have no</B>
<P><B>knowledge of the new inhabitants.  Nor do I care to back to find out.</B>

<H3><A NAME=story>Screaming Ghost Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by colon@nwu.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure if this is the result of a ghost or what, but about six
years</B>
<P><B>ago I was taking a nap on my bed early on a summer evening. I live
a very</B>
<P><B>rural area and have only a few neighbors, as I'm mostly surrounded
by</B>
<P><B>fields. My room is on the southeast corner of the house and has very
heavy</B>
<P><B>wood-framed windows that face each of those directions. On this
particular</B>
<P><B>evening the south window was closed.</B>
<P><B>I was lightly dozing when I heard a very peculiar scream. It sounded
like</B>
<P><B>it started in a field beyond the house of our neighbors to the west
and</B>
<P><B>circled around south until it ended up somewhere by our neighbors to
the</B>
<P><B>east. It began high and got lower as it went east. Keep in mind only
my</B>
<P><B>east window was open, but I heard the scream very clearly the whole
time.</B>
<P><B>It kept repeating, each time starting closer to our house from the
west and</B>
<P><B>ending closer to my east window. It also kept getting shorter and lower
in</B>
<P><B>pitch. Finally it stopped after about 15 minutes when it sounded like
it</B>
<P><B>was ending right outside of my window.</B>
<P><B>I was frozen with fear on my bed the entire time. A few moments after
the</B>
<P><B>last scream ended, I walked into the kitchen, which is on the south
side of</B>
<P><B>the house, and asked my mom if she had heard anything--she hadn't.
I've</B>
<P><B>never heard anything like this screaming since.</B>

<H3><A NAME=site>Historic Site Hauntings</A>
</H3><P><B>by Saphire484@aol</B>
<P>
<P><B>I worked as a museum curator at a historic site for a number of years.
 The site was  the ancestral home of  one family for over 250 years.  I had
access to all areas of the 30 room mansion. These are some of my
experiences:</B>
<P>
<P><B>During the fall when we were no longer open to the public, I would
be alone in the house vacuuming and cleaning and making it ready for the
closed season.  I would bring a radio in with me to keep me company  One
day, I went outside for a break, leaving the radio on.  When I went back
inside, the radio was off and the plug was emoved from the outlet.  I was
the only one on site that day and I always locked myself inside the house
to clean.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One year, a cataloger was working on the computer in a back storage
room.  She was the only one in the house.  I was working in an outbuilding
next to the house  I had heard a loud slam from the screen door of the side
porch and looked to see the girl running toward me.  Her hair was standing
straight up!  She said that she couldn't work in the house that day...she
had heard a women humming a song and got this strange feeling all over her.
 She asked me to go back in the house with her.  We went toward the screen
door that she ran out of and observed that it had been latched---from the
inside of the house.  We entered through the main door of the house, walked
to the side porch area that she had exited and the wooden door to the little
side porch was not only closed, but bolted shut!  Once again, no one else
was on site that day.</B>
<P>
<P><B>While opening the house up one morning (raising over 40 window shades
and opening designated doors), I was in the 1930's wing of the house when
I heard a door open from the main part of the house and distict foot steps
walking matter-of-factly through the "Gun Room"  two rooms behind me.   
I said, "Good Morning"  thinking that it was a co-worker who was scheduled
to work.  But there was no respnse.  I got a strange feeling, mustered up
courage to go through the gun room and  through five other rooms to gu out
the door of the house.  I walked down to the parking lot and there were no
cars other than my own.  I was alone at the site again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another morning, while opening the house I was again in the 1930's
section of the house when I thought to myself, "what would happen if I went
out through the the `New Kitchen' exit porch and the latch was locked on
the outside and I couldn't get out?" It was just one of those subconcscience
thoughts when it actually happened!  Luckily, a co-worker was outside to
let me out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Late one summer  morning, I went into the house to use the staff bathroom
which was a door located at the end of the visitor reception room.   It was
a weekday and we were closed to the public.  As I was in the bathroom, I
heard the reception room door open, footsteps walk up to the bathroom door
and two sharp knocks at the bathroom door.  "Just a minute," I said. But
there was no answer .  I heard a noise from the floor above me where catalogers
were working.  It sounded as if they were pushing something (perhaps a chair
or trunk)  across the floor.   I went upstairs and asked them if they were
moving something.  "No," they each replied.  They were just writing paperwork.
 I asked if either of them knocked on the bathroom door.  They both said
"no."  They hadn't heard the reception room door open at all, which they
had been trained to listen for.   </B>
<P>
<P><B>I've never really believed in any of the paranormal, but this next
story changed my mind:</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was working in an outbuilding  which was used as an office.  We were
opened to the public and had a staff of four giving house tours.   During
the afternoon, one of the tour guides came in and said she had two psychic
visitors and they had questions for me.   The tour guide told me that during
her tour, one of the women placed her hands over the roped off doorway of
the north wing bedroom and she observed the eye hooks embedded in the doorway
turn full circle without the woman touching them!  The psychic said that
she saw a spirit in the north wing, but he wasn't  the popular namesake of
the site.  She said she recognized the spirit from the family photographs
in the reception room.  I went back into the reception room with the two
psychics and one of the women walked right over to the photo of the gentleman
who built the north wing!  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The intriguing part of this was the fact that the psychics warned us
that we would experience chaos that afternoon--but not to worry as it would
be not earth shattering.  They explained that with their presence, they've
disrupted the spirit's plane.  Anyone coming within 5 feet of the house would
be affected. Well, let me tell you what happened.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>From 2pm-4pm: I observed a group of visiters in the house walking around
all over the rooms, not staying together, touching furniture and objects,
tour guides yelling at them (these were events I 'd never seen in my 10 years
there), law enforcement rangers documenting  vandalism in the historic cemetary,
 and a group of 50 severely mentally disturbed patients arriving and moaning
loudly on the front lawn (the size of a football field) of the house!!  People
were trying to open windows from the outside and knocking on different exterior
doors  trying to get in.  Mind you, we had and entrance sign posted at the
reception room door which was acknowledged any other day!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Some of my former co-workers will attest to these happenings.  The
staunch and pompous law enforcement ranger who was my former clueless boss
didn't believe in himself or anything else.  He's still there, hates people
and believes that if thesehappeninmgs were known, "you'd have every kook
in creation over here with metal detectors and crap."  So this has proven
to be a great sounding board for me!  I'll write more stories as I remember
them, if you like.  Thanks for listening!</B>

<H3><A NAME=great>My Great Grandfather</A>
</H3><P><B>by bfisher@mail.lrc.state.ky.us</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Great Grandfather always from the time I was small sat in a chair
in the same place </B>
<P><B>in their house.   In fact all I remmber of him was that he could not
walk.  He was </B>
<P><B>cripled and was in alot of pain. I'm know am 37 years old and have
moved into my Great </B>
<P><B>Grandparents house just in the last year.  And one night while my daughter
and I where </B>
<P><B>sitting in a chair just about where my Great Grandfather always sat.
 There came a </B>
<P><B>horrid smell and I thought that my other daughter had gotten sick,
so I jumped up to run </B>
<P><B>and see about her in the next room.  Well she was sound asleep and
my youngest was </B>
<P><B>saying Mommie what is that smell.  I looked and I picked the chair
up and looked under </B>
<P><B>it.  Nothing was there but that smell.  Know that all the windows where
shut and the </B>
<P><B>doors.  So I was just freaking out.  The next day my husband came home
from being out of </B>
<P><B>town and I told him about what had happend.  He had had the same thing
happend to him </B>
<P><B>one night after we all had gone to bed. Then it dawned on me that my
Great Grandfather </B>
<P><B>always smoked a pipe and sat in that same place and that is the smell
that we had </B>
<P><B>noticed.  It was always very strong when you walked in the house years
before when I was </B>
<P><B>young.  So I know that both of my Great Grandparents deid in the house
and so far this </B>
<P><B>is the only things that have happend to us.  And hopefully the last.</B>

<H3><A NAME=modular>Haunted Modular</A>
</H3><P><B>by guamautoinc@netpci.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a story about a time when I had moved into a modular home.
 We</B>
<P><B>live in Guam a small island in the middle of the Pacific.  The year
was</B>
<P><B>1992 and my girlfreind and her 7 year old son had moved from another</B>
<P><B>house into a modular home that had a small extention to it in which
an</B>
<P><B>elderly couple rented (for way too much money).  The move in and
seting</B>
<P><B>up was unaventfull and things were going ok untill a couple of months</B>
<P><B>after.  The first indication that something was going on was Bill my</B>
<P><B>girlfreind's son (my son now) started having sleeping trouble.  He
would</B>
<P><B>wake in the middle of the night screeming.  When we would ask him
what</B>
<P><B>the problem was he said that there were some little people that were
in</B>
<P><B>the back yard playing around a tree and they wanted him to come with</B>
<P><B>them.  I dismissed this as a child hood dream and let it go at that.
</B>
<P><B>Whithin the next few days he had the same dream (or so I thought it
was</B>
<P><B>). And I became concerned that the change in living between the old</B>
<P><B>house and new was affecting him.  In any case I let him sleep in the</B>
<P><B>living room from that time on for a long time.  He wouldent hardly
go in</B>
<P><B>there except to change his clothes.</B>
<P><B>	About a month later we started hearing quite a lot of noise and it</B>
<P><B>occured almost exactly at 3:20 am each morning.  The first sounds
were</B>
<P><B>suttle as opening and closing of droors.  Steadaly increasing to
heavy</B>
<P><B>sounds of running inside the house.  I could have explained these
away</B>
<P><B>as my imagination but my girlfriend said she had heard the same
sounds.</B>
<P><B>	I started investigating the background of the Modular and started
to</B>
<P><B>speak to the elderly couple about what was going on.  They had both
said</B>
<P><B>they had heard the same types of noises even when the house was vacent.
</B>
<P><B>They had said the last tennant only stayed for 2 to three months and</B>
<P><B>then suddenly left in the middle of the night never to come back.</B>
<P><B>	The owner of the modular had stated that it was used as a day care</B>
<P><B>center for many years and was closed down ( due to what I dont know
) in</B>
<P><B>any case I was in the hous and wanted to stay even with all the weird</B>
<P><B>noises so I decided to try to confront whatever was in the house. 
I</B>
<P><B>waited untill the usual time 3:20 AM  and the sounds started as they
had</B>
<P><B>consistantly for a few months.  I got up and went into my son's room
and</B>
<P><B>had a word with the room.  I had asked if whoever was there to show</B>
<P><B>themselvs and was not successfull in contacting any one or any thing.</B>
<P><B>	the sounds continued on but got progressivly sooner and sooner in
the</B>
<P><B>evening.  One night we had went to a dinner party and left one of my</B>
<P><B>girlfreind's sisters to watch bill.  When we arrived home the front
door</B>
<P><B>was wide open and she was sitting on the doorstep looking straight
out.</B>
<P><B>	We had asked her what had happened and she said things were being</B>
<P><B>droped allover the house,  plates , books , nick nacks etc. we
confirmed</B>
<P><B>this by finding the items on the floor.</B>
<P><B>	The occurances finaly became less frequent and mellowed out quite
a</B>
<P><B>bit.  Untill one evening,  we were fast asleap and all of a sudden
I</B>
<P><B>heard running on top of the roof.  Loud footsteps like a full size
man</B>
<P><B>of 200 lbs.  I could hear these clearly since the roof of the modular</B>
<P><B>was tin.  In any case I went outside to take a look and of course
there</B>
<P><B>was nothing,  But when I came back to bed I felt a presence between
my</B>
<P><B>girlfriend and I it was like a resistance that had a bad odor to it
or</B>
<P><B>the room. My girlfreind and I both felt and smelt it. there was also
a</B>
<P><B>long female sounding sigh that occured right when the resistance</B>
<P><B>started. </B>
<P><B>	I did not know what it was but it scared the hell out of me and her
and</B>
<P><B>we both sat up and rode the night out.  </B>
<P><B>	The occurances were less and less after that last time and we really</B>
<P><B>had a good time in the house.  We became to feel there was someone
</B>
<P><B>watching us and sharing our lives.  We moved out about 2 years later</B>
<P><B>and  learned the new tennants had a hell of a time in that house. 
The</B>
<P><B>elderly lady that lived next door became good friend with my
girlfriends</B>
<P><B>mother and they always talked.  </B>
<P><B>	The new tennant had two teanage daughters that stayed in Bills old
room</B>
<P><B>and they say they were being watched through the windows. ( maybee
a</B>
<P><B>peeping tom ?? )  they are teenage girls you know.</B>
<P><B>	in any case sorry for the boring story but every part is true and
I now</B>
<P><B>beleave there are somthings that are out there we cant explain.</B>

<H3><A NAME=aunt>My Aunt's Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by foxfire123@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story is about a house my family lived in for generations. It's</B>
<P><B>more of a group of stories really. My family has told each of them
to me</B>
<P><B>many times, and I love hearing them. First let me say before i
continue</B>
<P><B>that I truly beleive in every single story. Everyone who has told me</B>
<P><B>stories about this house have never been known to lie (they believe
that</B>
<P><B>by lying about something like that, they wish it upon themselves)</B>
<P><B>	Let me start with the first generation of my family to live in the</B>
<P><B>house. My great-grandmother and grandfather bought it in Hampton, Va
in</B>
<P><B>the 1930's i believe. When they bought it it was a rather large
2-story</B>
<P><B>house overlooking the James River. They had children (my grandfather,
my</B>
<P><B>great aunt and uncle) and decided they needed more room in the house
so</B>
<P><B>they built an extra room on the back to serve as a storage room. My</B>
<P><B>great-grandmother had a sewing room with a hanging lightbulb. She
would</B>
<P><B>sit and sew all day then read her bible every night in that room
before</B>
<P><B>bed. Nothing ever happened until she would open her bible...every
time</B>
<P><B>the light bulb would start swinging violently as if someone had
smacked</B>
<P><B>it. </B>
<P><B>	My great-grandfather had a garden in the back of the house. Part of
it</B>
<P><B>was planted in the original property, and the other half was in the</B>
<P><B>newly added property. Nothing within the original boundery would
grow,</B>
<P><B>all the plants would die. But those on the new property flourished.</B>
<P><B>Thinking maybe something was wrong with the soil he had it tested,
only</B>
<P><B>to find out both sides of the old boundary line were the same exact</B>
<P><B>composition.</B>
<P><B>	My great-aunt had strange things happen to her, like at night there</B>
<P><B>would be an imprint on her bed like someone was sitting on the edge
of</B>
<P><B>it next to her, but no one would be there. Once when they were
outside</B>
<P><B>having a cook-out when she was around 11 she saw a light come on in
the</B>
<P><B>attic. My grandfather (13) saw it too so they went to investigate.
The</B>
<P><B>only way into the attic was a trap door in the bathroom upstairs that</B>
<P><B>has been sealed over with plaster and paint. When they got to the</B>
<P><B>bathroom, the ceiling was untouched. They later found out that the
attic</B>
<P><B>had no electricity running to it.</B>
<P><B>	My grandfather is a quiet man and doesn't talk about the old house</B>
<P><B>much, but I did manage to get a confession out of him. One day he was</B>
<P><B>home sick from school at about 15. Both his parents were at work and
his</B>
<P><B>brother and sister were at school. He was dozing off on the couch,</B>
<P><B>listening to the radio when his favorite radioshow started getting</B>
<P><B>staticy. He smacked the radio a couple of times but then stopped when
he</B>
<P><B>clearly heard the radio say "ow, stop!". There was also a rocking
chair</B>
<P><B>in his room when he was 19 that belonged to his great-great aunt. One</B>
<P><B>night he came home drunk and was lying down to go to sleep when he
heard</B>
<P><B>the chair start to creek (that's why no one ever sat in that chair</B>
<P><B>because it made that god-awful sound when it rocked). He saw it
rocking</B>
<P><B>out of the corner of his eye, so he sat up to look at it. When he did
it</B>
<P><B>stopped. But as soon as he laid down again, it would start again.
This</B>
<P><B>went on for about an hour until he said "look, you're giving me a</B>
<P><B>headache, stop it and let me get some sleep". It stopped. The next</B>
<P><B>morning he took it ou back and chopped it into a million pieces.</B>
<P><B>	My great-aunt till this day still lives with my great-grandmother.
(My</B>
<P><B>great-grandfather died when i was 5). My great uncle went into the
army</B>
<P><B>and served in vietnam, and my grandfather moved into the house across</B>
<P><B>the street. There he got married and had my aunt, my mom, and my
uncle.</B>
<P><B>My mom and aunt used to go spend the night with my great-grandma and</B>
<P><B>they had strange things happen to them too.</B>
<P><B>	My mom remembers having the same thing happen to her that happened
to</B>
<P><B>my great-aunt. She, too, would wake up and see the imprint on the
bed.</B>
<P><B>One thing she remembers in particular is the glowing ball she once
saw</B>
<P><B>hovering in the corner of her room. It was about a foot in diameter
and</B>
<P><B>just hovering there for about and hour, then it vanished. </B>
<P><B>	The only thing my aunt remembers about the house is what she calls
"the</B>
<P><B>purple lady". She would refuse to go up the stairs because she saw
a</B>
<P><B>lady dressed in purple standing at the top of the stairs. She had
long</B>
<P><B>black hair and blue eyes, beutiful. She would stand there and say
"come</B>
<P><B>up here, come to me cindy, I won't hurt you, I promise". Most
children</B>
<P><B>would have gone, but my aunt felt like something wasnt right. She</B>
<P><B>refused to go upstairs by herself.</B>
<P><B>	My mom and aunt were the last generation to stay in the house. My</B>
<P><B>family moved on to Richmond, Va or other parts of Hampton. Every once
in</B>
<P><B>awhile while I'm visiting mom in Hampton I'll go by the old house
that</B>
<P><B>I've heard so much about, and every time I do, it's up for sale
again...</B>

<H3><A NAME=ghost>Jacqui's Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by cjcosper@brooksdata.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is just a small thing really, but it did scare the hell out of
me in</B>
<P><B>high school.  I had lived in the same house since I was 6 and I don't</B>
<P><B>remember not being afraid of a certain room in our house.  Our family
area</B>
<P><B>was a den off of the kitchen but, also off the kitchen was a more
formal</B>
<P><B>living room that my mother reserved for guests.  This living room also
had</B>
<P><B>another doorway which led directly outside the hall of my bedroom.
 Day or</B>
<P><B>night did not matter, I would run past that doorway.  This doorway,</B>
<P><B>incidentally, had no door.  I could not put my finger on exactly what
made</B>
<P><B>me feel so uneasy.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't know if this was related or not, but I had become accustomed
to</B>
<P><B>falling asleep with my television on...Mtv generation and all.
 However,</B>
<P><B>when I woke up the next morning, my tv would inevitably be off.  I
chalked</B>
<P><B>it up to half-waking enough to turn it off myself.  I was a little
less</B>
<P><B>sure when my stereo began playing by itself in the middle of the night.
 I</B>
<P><B>was a little freaked out by this but what do I know about electronics?
 </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Now, this did not happen every night.  There was no real frequency
or</B>
<P><B>pattern to these occurences.  The clincher came when, after rearranging
my</B>
<P><B>room late one night, the stereo began playing, once again.  The reason
this</B>
<P><B>bothered me was that my stereo had been unplugged in the rearrangement
of</B>
<P><B>my room!</B>
<P>
<P><B>I never saw anything unusual, no ghostly apparitions or such but I</B>
<P><B>continued to zoom past the living room door.  Hated was the night when
I</B>
<P><B>had one too many beverages before going to bed and had to get up in
the</B>
<P><B>night!  I began preparing to leave for college in '89, and a certain</B>
<P><B>incident still gets to me when I think about it.  It was the middle
of a</B>
<P><B>Saturday afternoon and my father was gone so my mother, sister, and
I were</B>
<P><B>just doing laundry and being lazy.  My sister and I were watching movies
in</B>
<P><B>the den while my mother was preparing lunch.  When the movie was over,
I</B>
<P><B>went through the kitchen, to the hall, and by THE DOORWAY.  As I
moved</B>
<P><B>past, I heard a loud crash.  I called to ask my mom if she was ok as
she</B>
<P><B>was asking me the same question.  I ran back to the kitchen as did
my</B>
<P><B>sister.  After we were all accounted for and realized that none of
us had</B>
<P><B>touched anything that made that noise, I ventured in the living room.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother had a brass candlestick holder with heavy, glass candles
in it. </B>
<P><B>I found the candlestick holder on the ground, near the table where
it</B>
<P><B>usually rests.  What really spooked me was that the candlesticks
themselves</B>
<P><B>had been hurled across the room near THE DOORWAY that only moments
before I</B>
<P><B>had walked by.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Take this as you wish.  I moved away and went to college soon after
this. </B>
<P><B>Of course I returned, summer and holidays, and my parents still live
there.</B>
<P><B> However, to my knowledge, since I left, nothing else has happened,
not</B>
<P><B>even when I visited.  And my parents now use the room as an office
so it is</B>
<P><B>used every day.  I can now go in there during the day but you won't
catch</B>
<P><B>me in there at night!</B>

<H3><A NAME=stuff>Weird Stuff?</A>
</H3><P><B>by Gallowad@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, my name is Mark.  I live in an apartment on the Northwest side
of Chicago.  My roomate (my brother, Matt) and I don' t really see each other
that much.  This is primarily due to the fact of our conflicting schedules,
therefore when we are at home each of us are alone.</B>
<P><B>The interest begins here.  I am somewhat of a nightowl.  I sit up and
channel surf the TV.  It started when I would be relaxing on the couch, flipping
through the channels.  I would often see something out of the corner of my
eye, a movement I happened to notice walking through the short hall that
adjoins the two bedrooms, the bathroom and the kitchen.  It would always
be the same.  It looked like someone, dressed in light colored clothing walking
towards the kitchen.  I always thought it was my eyes palying tricks on me.
 </B>
<P><B>Occasionally my brother and I are home at the same time.  One night
we were both in the living room and Matt jumped as if he were surprised.
I saw what I've been noticing in the hall and knew he had seen it too. I
asked what was wrong and he said he thought someone was walking towards the
kitchen, this surprised him, as we were the only ones in the apartment. 
Before I could say ANYTHING he went on to tell me all the times he's noticed
someone walking, in light clothing, towards the kitchen.  I was shocked.
 He has been seeing the same "tricks on the eyes" as me.</B>
<P><B>We discussed the situation at length and discovered every time we had
noticed the strange occurance it was ALWAYS the same scenario.  White clad
figure, walking briskly toward the kitchen, no noise.  That's it!  </B>
<P><B>This is where we put two and two together.  We were hearing from our
respective friends things like "I called and no one answered" or from our
girlfriends "where were you...I called and you weren't there".  We would
(though each of us didn't see a trend yet) be puzzled.  There was some one
at home at the time of the incoming calls.  We would even page people and
ask them the next time we talked, "Why didn't you return my page?". As always
we found the ringer on the phone was off.  At the time we thought nothing
of it. We immediately talked of ghosts, what other explanation could it be?
 The figure was always going towards the kitchen, and the phone is the first
thing one would get to upon entering that room.  I never shut the ringer
off and neither does he.</B>
<P><B>I have always thought and believed in the supernatural.  This presence
has never caused any harm or attempted to shock us in any way.  Please respond
to my mail and relay some tips on investigating this abnormality further.</B>

<H3><A NAME=basement>Ghost in the Basement</A>
</H3><P><B>by tshan@ameritech.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi my is Tamika, and I thought that I was the only person with a</B>
<P><B>horrible ghost story.  Well here it is.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It happened in 1987.  Me, my sister, and my mother lived with my</B>
<P><B>grandparents.  We slept in the basement.  We shared a bunkbed. My
mother</B>
<P><B>slept on the bottom and my sister and I slept on the top. </B>
<P>
<P><B>This particular night, my mother had stayed the night over her</B>
<P><B>boyfriends house.  I was waken up by the sound of my name, someone
was</B>
<P><B>calling me. I looked up and the entire basement looked as though it
was</B>
<P><B>daylight.  I looked around and I saw it.  A sore for sight eyes.  It
was</B>
<P><B>almost beautiful, a woman in white flowing.  It appeared to me that
she</B>
<P><B>was floating, with her white blowing in the air.  But there was no
air.</B>
<P><B>Once I saw that I instantly became extremely terrified. I could only</B>
<P><B>hide myself under the covers, wondering why would this person be in
my</B>
<P><B>basement calling me, looking the way she did.  I nudged my sister a
few</B>
<P><B>times and asked her if she would look and see if she saw anything,
she</B>
<P><B>was to busy sleeping to do it.  So I finally got up the nerve to pull</B>
<P><B>the covers down off of my face and see what it was or where it was
or if</B>
<P><B>it was gone.  And it was gone.  I jumped up out of the bed turned the</B>
<P><B>light on, and headed upstairs.  Once I got upstairs I saw that my</B>
<P><B>grandparents were up having their morning breakfast.  And guess what?
</B>
<P><B>It was pitch black outside.  I couldn't believe it.  I had told my</B>
<P><B>grandparents about what had happened and my grandfather showed me</B>
<P><B>something in the paper about many people having the exact same</B>
<P><B>experiences that I had had.  It didn't feel any better about it.  I
just</B>
<P><B>made me wonder, WHY?  Why did it have to happen to me.  Does anyone
know</B>
<P><B>why?  Now the thought of a ghost gives me the creepy-crawlies.  Thanx</B>
<P><B>for listening, or reading.  However you want to look at it.</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Grandmother</A>
</H3><P><B>by detyreed@nisc.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandmother was dying of colon cancer, I was notified by my
mother(it</B>
<P><B>was her mother that was dying) that the doctors had given her only
2</B>
<P><B>days to live. I told my mother that since she had been with grandma
all</B>
<P><B>day that I would stay with her that night so that mom could get some</B>
<P><B>much needed rest.  Grandma had been in a coma for a couple of days
and</B>
<P><B>her breathing was labored because her lungs were filling up with
fluid.</B>
<P><B>The nurse asked if I would like a cot to sleep in since I told them
I</B>
<P><B>would be spending the night, I said that I preferred to sit beside</B>
<P><B>grandma. I was watching Johnny Carson, which came on at 10 pm CT when</B>
<P><B>grandma reached over and grabbed my hand that I had laid beside her
on</B>
<P><B>the bed. She never moved anything else or muttered a word.  We sat
there</B>
<P><B>holding hands for an hour and at exactly 11pm she took a very deep
and</B>
<P><B>final breathe.  I was unable to sleep for some time having had</B>
<P><B>reoccuring dreams of her drowning.  My grandfather was still alive
but</B>
<P><B>unable to care for himself and was placed in an elderly care
facility.</B>
<P><B>Mom toyed with the idea of renting out grandma's house or selling it.
 I</B>
<P><B>told mom I was uncomfortable with the idea of someone else living in</B>
<P><B>that house since I had grown up there ( we only lived approx. 1 mile</B>
<P><B>away). It was agreed that I would move in with a room mate. Six
months</B>
<P><B>passed before we were able to have an auction to liquidate as much
as we</B>
<P><B>could for funeral expenses since we didn't sell the house, it was
agreed</B>
<P><B>that instead of rent I would fix the house up and when I moved the
money</B>
<P><B>from the sale would be used to cover expenses for grandpa's funeral.
The</B>
<P><B>room I chose for my bedroom had been the guest room, since I wasn't</B>
<P><B>ready to sleep in grandma's room having taken care of her in there
while</B>
<P><B>suffering from the cancer, chemo and radiation therapy, the memories</B>
<P><B>were to awful. To continue, the room was directly across from the</B>
<P><B>kitchen door way and the kitchen was lit up by the blue glow from the</B>
<P><B>clock on the microwave oven. I had been sleeping soundly  and rather</B>
<P><B>peacefully when for some odd reason I was instantly awake, I sat up
in</B>
<P><B>bed a looked out of the bedroom door into the kitchen and saw my</B>
<P><B>grandmother at the counter in one of her floral dresses and
half-aprons</B>
<P><B>making cookies as she always did when we were children. I sat and</B>
<P><B>watched her for several minutes and a very peaceful feeling came over
me</B>
<P><B>as if she was telling me that she was glad that I had moved into her</B>
<P><B>house to take care of it as she had always done. She never turned</B>
<P><B>around, just kept making cookies and I went back to sleep. I have
never</B>
<P><B>seen grandma since then and lived in her house for ten years, until
my</B>
<P><B>son was 6 years old. Grandma didn't live to see my son but I felt by</B>
<P><B>living in her house she was watching over us ( I'm a single parent
and</B>
<P><B>can use all the help I can get). Things had become hectic with my
other</B>
<P><B>grandmother and I moved closer to her, still in the same town. We
sold</B>
<P><B>the house and saved the money as agreed to pay for grandpa's funeral.
He</B>
<P><B>died exactly 10 yrs and 1 wk after her but enter the hospital the
same</B>
<P><B>day she had passed away.  Mom and Ichose the buyers carefully and</B>
<P><B>financed the loan ourselves so that if anything happened the house</B>
<P><B>before it was paid off it would return to the family and we could</B>
<P><B>continue to take care of grandma's house. It was not difficult to let
go</B>
<P><B>of the house, as if grandma understood that I had been there for her
and</B>
<P><B>was now needed elsewhere, but I often remember my childhood there when
I</B>
<P><B>drive by and the memory of grandma's last visit from beyond.  I know
she</B>
<P><B>is at peace and now grandpa is with her and a new family will make</B>
<P><B>memories in a house that was always accustomed to laughter and love.</B>

<H3><A NAME="my ghost">My Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by VIKING3@prodigy.net</B>
<P><B>When I was young, 10 years old, I lived in a house in Franklin MA,
that</B>
<P><B>had a ghost in it.  I have 4 other syblings, and I don't know if they</B>
<P><B>ever saw it or if they remember the things that I went through because
I</B>
<P><B>told my parents that I did ( now that I'd mentioned this, I'll ask</B>
<P><B>them).</B>
<P><B>  As a child I was very reclusive, and this worried my parents.  But,</B>
<P><B>when I told them about then 'Guy I can see, watching me out of the</B>
<P><B>corner of my eye', they sent me to counceling.</B>
<P><B>  All through the counceling I stuck to my story.  What had happened,</B>
<P><B>simply was, that when I was alone I would see this man, out of the</B>
<P><B>corner of my eye, watching me.  I could discribe his appearance
exactly,</B>
<P><B>down to what he was wearing and the part in his hair.  He never
showed</B>
<P><B>any hostility toward me, so I was never afraid of him, He was a part
of</B>
<P><B>my everyday life. I was so not afraid of him that it was almost a
year</B>
<P><B>before I told my parents about him, and it was because they asked "
What</B>
<P><B>are you lookin for?" I was trying to see where he disapeared to.</B>
<P><B>  Later in my years, 21 or 22, I started seeing him again.  My job
was</B>
<P><B>close by, so I used to walk to work.I would leave for work very early
in</B>
<P><B>he morning.  It was winter so at that time it was fairly dark.  I
would</B>
<P><B>travel by dark roads, not seclusive, but dark.  One night, about a
week</B>
<P><B>into my job, as I was walking, I heared and saw, someone walking
behind</B>
<P><B>me.  Right behind me so that I could see him out of the corner of my</B>
<P><B>eye.  But, when I turned to look, he wasn't there.  But I did see
him,</B>
<P><B>it was the same guy, dressed differently.  As I got to the main road,
A</B>
<P><B>police officer ( who I knew ) picked me up and gave me a ride the
rest</B>
<P><B>of the way and said he would do so when ever he saw me ( thanks James</B>
<P><B>).  Still, every ( or most I should say ) morning, this 'guy' whould</B>
<P><B>walk with me, through the dark roads, until reached the policeman.
 He</B>
<P><B>was as apparent as if it was a physical person walking with me out
of</B>
<P><B>the corner of my eye, I could hear him walking.  At times I could</B>
<P><B>physically feel someone touch me ( my shoulder or waist ).</B>
<P><B>  Of couse I felt comforted by this ( anyone whould ).  But the fact</B>
<P><B>that I had the experience in the past maded me realize ( or think )
that</B>
<P><B>he was there to protected and comfort me ( he was an old friend ).
</B>
<P><B>  I still have him with me today, and I just wanted to relay to
people</B>
<P><B>that not all ghosts are harmful. I have 4 syblings ( he followed no
one</B>
<P><B>but me I think ),but he only connected with me. </B>
<P><B>  I have had freinds who formed freindships with their ghosts and
have</B>
<P><B>confirmed the exsistence of them.  I just want to let people know
that</B>
<P><B>it is possible to live with some ghost...... some ghost.</B>

<H3><A NAME=bridge>Infinity Bridge</A>
</H3><P><B>by KellamJ@pge-texas.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, you asked for stories, so here it goes.  All my life I have had</B>
<P><B>little oddities that are a part of my everyday dealings and life. 
My</B>
<P><B>friends even call me the chaos goddess as objects tend to disappear,
only</B>
<P><B>to reappear in a perfectly logical place later.  Always have the
kindly</B>
<P><B>spirits been allowed in my life, and I have chased off a few nasty
ones.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Beginning when I was young, the most vivid image I have is of my
bedroom,</B>
<P><B>most assuredly haunted, by something nasty.  My bedclothes would rise
up at</B>
<P><B>the end of the bed.  My closet would swing open and I could see a
noose,</B>
<P><B>and a figure hanging from it.  Ever Daddy's brave one, I just hunkered
down</B>
<P><B>under the covers and prayed to God.  And boy did I pray.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I grew older the visions stopped, and the audial noises began. 
I would</B>
<P><B>be taking baths, the house empty, and I could hear someone calling
and</B>
<P><B>banging on the door, "Help me!  Help me!"  I would jump out of the
bath</B>
<P><B>dripping water on the carpet, and dash out the door.  The noise would</B>
<P><B>suddenly grow fainter, as I ran around the house, looking for the source
of</B>
<P><B>the cry.  I never found it, but I always chased it.  Hoping to
somehow</B>
<P><B>help.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My friend would witness pictures that would slide across counter
tops,</B>
<P><B>glasses of water that would move across counters and window sills.
 There</B>
<P><B>was a cross stitch of Mary Poppins that my mother made, and at night,
it</B>
<P><B>would move, and it would try to talk to me, but no sounds would emit.
 My</B>
<P><B>sister saw this too.  We told Mom, but she just accused us of watching
late</B>
<P><B>night TV.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Later in my life, I was at a friends house, who is stalked by ghosts.
 I</B>
<P><B>had forgotten my childhood visitors, and just silently discredited</B>
<P><B>everything.  Staying at her house one night the room grew chilly and
cold.</B>
<P><B>I sat up in bed and there at the end of the bed was an entity that
was</B>
<P><B>looking directly at her.  He was clothed in black that seems to pull
at any</B>
<P><B>potential light in the room.  His eyes, gleaming in the light turned
to me.</B>
<P><B>My friend slept fitfully beside me, but never waking.  I looked in
horror</B>
<P><B>at the figure, and my mind went blank.  Eventually I just screamed
at him</B>
<P><B>to leave, "in the name of God Leave!"  And he swiftly departed.  My
friend</B>
<P><B>fell to a sound sleep.  And she claims she has not seen him since.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There are other incidents but the following stands out to me as so
many</B>
<P><B>people felt it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Most powerfully felt by a large group of people was the occurrence
at</B>
<P><B>Infinity bridge.  It is in Fort Worth Texas.  It is a bridge that is
build</B>
<P><B>in such a way that when you are under the bridge and you look at the</B>
<P><B>support beams, it seems to transform itself into doorways upon
doorways</B>
<P><B>into infinity.  My husband, a man of science and a true skeptic has
even</B>
<P><B>been a little creeped by this place. He will tell you that even during
the</B>
<P><B>day, when you are under the bridge, and you should be able to see where
the</B>
<P><B>bridge ends, you can't, it seems to reach on forever.  My husband,
myself,</B>
<P><B>another couple, a brother and sister, and a dear friend headed out
to this</B>
<P><B>bridge one dark night.  We made sure that no one was around, as it
is noted</B>
<P><B>to be a place where the nastier element tends to hang out.  We stood
on the</B>
<P><B>first concrete support and looked out over the water and into the
infinite</B>
<P><B>illusion.  It wasn't long before the hairs began to raise on my arms.
 I</B>
<P><B>was filled with peace and joy.  The girl next to me was filled with
fear</B>
<P><B>and dreading.  The men knelt down, or got away from there pretty
fast,</B>
<P><B>feeling like they could not breathe.  The sister turned on the brother
and</B>
<P><B>began shouting at him.  The dear friend just kept looking behind her,
as if</B>
<P><B>looking for something.  Soon, I saw a white glow coming from somewhere
in</B>
<P><B>the darkness.  And I felt the presence of a small boy, who wanted to
play.</B>
<P><B>Then I repeatedly heard and saw the water beneath the bridge ripple
as if</B>
<P><B>someone had been skipping rocks.  The girl next to me saw blackness
and</B>
<P><B>dark tendrils from the doorway.  She never saw the light that I did,
and I</B>
<P><B>never saw the darkness that she did.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After we got back, I did some asking of questions.  I had never heard
of</B>
<P><B>this bridge, and I did not know its story.  Evidently, there is the
spirit</B>
<P><B>of a little boy trapped there, said to be killed in a Satanic ritual,
or</B>
<P><B>just drowned.  One way or another, no one knows for sure, his body
was</B>
<P><B>found in the water beneath the bridge.  Most everyone who goes senses
the</B>
<P><B>evil.  Most everyone who senses the evil is somehow compelled to come
back</B>
<P><B>and revisit it.  I was given a very rare experience indeed, as it is
not</B>
<P><B>often that the little boy's spirit comes out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We did make it back to the car.  Everyone a little shaken.  The sister
was</B>
<P><B>most affected with this intense pull to return to the bridge.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I will not return, unless I could learn how to release the boy.  But
he did</B>
<P><B>not seem at all disturbed about being there.  Maybe he was there to
protect</B>
<P><B>me.  I do not know.  Maybe he was my angel for the evening.  Regardless,
I</B>
<P><B>was safe that night from the evil that everyone else felt.  It never</B>
<P><B>touched me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=about>My Story About Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by MOJO15326@prodigy.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello my name is Nilita, and here is my story.  My parents and I
 moved</B>
<P><B>from my hometown of Medical Lake, Washington to Orlando, Florida that</B>
<P><B>didn't last very long so we moved back to Wa.  My parents were in the</B>
<P><B>process of buying a house so a friend of their's (I'll call her "KAY,"
for</B>
<P><B>the sake of her identity) let us stay with her for a while.  See her</B>
<P><B>husband had died about five years before so she lived alone in very
large</B>
<P><B>old white house that took up about the whole block.  It was just me
and my</B>
<P><B>mom there, we were waiting for my dad to drive up with the U-Haul truck.
</B>
<P><B>We arrived on a Friday, that next Saturday Kay left for a short visit
in</B>
<P><B>Seattle.  That following Sunday my mother and I came home from visiting
all</B>
<P><B>of our friends, I ran upstairs where me and my mother shared a room,
we</B>
<P><B>stayed in the blue room.  I went to change into my pajamas and I
heard</B>
<P><B>something in the direction of the closet, I also felt someone watching
me. </B>
<P><B>I ran downstairs yelling for my mom, I told her what I had just
experienced</B>
<P><B>and said, "There is someone upstairs in our room."  She went upstairs
and</B>
<P><B>checked it out no one was up there.  I always felt like someone was</B>
<P><B>watching me in that house, and I couldn't wait until my parents got
a place</B>
<P><B>of our own, I wanted out of that house.  Not until about a year later
I</B>
<P><B>found out the whole story.  See that Saturday morning when Kay left
for</B>
<P><B>Seattle, my mom asked her if she could sleep in her bedroom while she
was</B>
<P><B>gone.  Kay asked why and my mom said, "because the bed upstairs in
the blue</B>
<P><B>room is too soft and it hurts my back."   Kay said, "Are you sure that
is</B>
<P><B>the real reason?"  My mom said, "yes what are you talking about?" 
Kay said</B>
<P><B>well people don't like sleeping in the blue room because they say they
feel</B>
<P><B>someone watching them."  Also every picture taken in that house has
an</B>
<P><B>orange fuzz somewhere in the picture, whether it be above you, on the
side,</B>
<P><B>or around you, but never covering you up.  I would love to send you
some of</B>
<P><B>these pictures, but I have no idea how.  Maybe you could tell me how,
and</B>
<P><B>I'll send them to you to show on your page.  Now someone else lives
in that</B>
<P><B>house, and I often wonder if the new owners feel and see some of the
things</B>
<P><B>that Kay and the rest of my family experienced. And I wonder if her</B>
<P><B>husband's spirit still lingers on in that house.  </B>
<P><B>					Thank you for letting me share my story.</B>
