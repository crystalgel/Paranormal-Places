<B>The general Hollywood concept of a ghost is not accurate but it's what
many think about when they speak of ghosts.&nbsp; There are basically three
types of hauntings.</B>

<P><B>The first type of haunting is exactly like a video playback of a
historic or tragic event.&nbsp; This is called a residual haunting.&nbsp;
The event unfolds in front of you and there is no interaction between you
and the ghosts.&nbsp; They seem to not notice you and go through the motions
of the event that occurred in the past.&nbsp; This event has been imprinted
on the area or building and is replayed back later when conditions are
right.&nbsp; The ghosts that you see in this type are not earthbound spirits,
they are just visual play backs.&nbsp; Since everything is made up of energy,
the theory is that some of the energy from an event can be recorded by
certain materials and played back when the atmosphere triggers it.&nbsp;
Remember that video and audio tape is just oxidized (rust) film that enables
the images and sounds to "stick" to it.&nbsp; This type may be frightening
when you see it, but you are in no danger so enjoy the experience.</B>

<P><B>The second type of haunting is an interactive spirit that manifests
in many ways.&nbsp; You may see a full bodied or partial bodied apparition.&nbsp;
More frequently than that, you may here voices, music, footsteps, etc.&nbsp;
You may also smell odors which sources cannot be found (i.e. pipe tobacco
when no one smokes).&nbsp; You may also see orbs, mists and other light
effects.&nbsp; You may feel touches, cold spots, and other light physical
contact.&nbsp; This ghost is the spirit of a deceased human being.&nbsp;
They may be stuck here (earthbound) for reasons such as tragic sudden death,
fear of moving on, guilt or unfinished business.&nbsp; They also could
be here visiting loved ones or to warn or pass along a message.&nbsp; These
human spirits are the same as they were in life, so they may be good or
bad, but not really evil.&nbsp; Think of all the people you know, probably
a bit of good and bad, some worse than others.&nbsp; This type can cause
some scary situations but you must think about the situation they are in,
you don't see them but they see you.&nbsp; They will try to get your attention
any way they can.&nbsp; Many times this is the terrifying event people
will write to me about like the lights going on and off, items moving,
noises, etc.&nbsp; For the most part these are just attention getters and
nothing more.&nbsp; There are a few more mischievous human spirits that
will do these things to bother you and scare you on purpose.&nbsp; They
may just be a prankster or maybe they want you to leave the old home or
not to change something in the home.&nbsp; They have all the same motivations
you and I would have.&nbsp; These human spirits account for a majority
of the hauntings we encounter and are relatively harmless.&nbsp; Yes, there
are extreme cases and sometimes they can cause dangerous situations, but
this is not the norm and is rare.</B>

<P><B>The third type of ghost you may encounter is not a rare one, but
is rare that they interact with the living.&nbsp; They are non human spirits,
commonly known as demons and devils.&nbsp; They are mentioned in the bible
numerous places in both the old and new testaments.&nbsp; People like Ed
and Lorraine Warren have been dealing with this type of spirit for years.&nbsp;
This type is dangerous and can cause you harm.&nbsp; I believe that if
there is good, there must be a counter balance, evil.&nbsp; These non human
spirits often disguise themselves and friendly and helpful human spirits.&nbsp;
They often appear in cases dealing with Ouija boards, black magic and satanic
worship.&nbsp; This is why I recommend not trying to contact spirits and
doing ghost hunts without some understanding of what's out there.&nbsp;
It's also why I recommend you go with or learn from experienced people
before hand.&nbsp; That way you can ghost hunt with relative safety from
these entities.</B>
