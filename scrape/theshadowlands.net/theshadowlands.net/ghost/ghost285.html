<P><B>I am Glad I get to Experiences these Things</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kalaschi@comcast.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am from massachusetts
and&nbsp; I have had experiences with ghosts all my life but never really
thought of them as such untill a few years back. the earliest experience
I remember was when I was 6 years old.1982&nbsp; My room had 2 windows
one facing the middle of town and the other facing my back yard (no lights)
well my bedroom door faced the backyard window so no light would shine
in at night, well one night i thought i heard something so I looked up
and looked at the door and saw a white figure peeking out from behind the
door. at first I thought it was a light from my window that faced town
because of the lights so I dismissed it. The next night I didnt see it
and I never thought about it untill a few nights later when again I herd
a noise and looked up and saw the same figure well being so young and brave
I got up and went to the window (facing the town) and figured my shawdow
would block the light well to my surprise it didnt so I went to the other
window and again my shawdow did not block the so called light needles to
say I jumped in bed and covered myself up. After that I wouldnt sleep in
my room anymore. We moved shortly after and we lived in a 2 family home(1983-1985
on the first floor the owner lived upstairs alone with his miniture poodle
well about a few months there i started hearing this howling noise comming
from our stove all the time and my room was off the kitchen so i heard
it all the time. I told my mom and she just said that it was the landlords
dog and I believed her because it kinda sounded like a dog well aboiut
6 months later the dog was put down and about 2 to 3 days later I heard
the same howling noise again well I was so scared I could barelt sleep
at night I again told my mom and she dismissed it and told me not to tell
anyone. well we then moved to No. woodstock NH to my grandfathers house
. I had never seen anything there but my mother had seen a ghost walk from
her bedroom acroos the kitchen turned and looked at her at that moment
she ran to turn the light on and it was gone. What really scared her was
that when he looked at her he was standing behind a ladder that went to
our loft it had a board behind it so when you put the ladder up it covered
the ceiling well she saw his face through the board. Come to find out while
we were going through old pictures and it was the origional owner of the
house. We moved a few more times and nothing really weird happened untill
1991 when we moved to methuen and the house we lived in used to be an old
milking barn. Well Late at night when I would use the bathroom when I looked
in the mirror I would see my face but very distorted a few time i just
thought it was because I was out drinking with my friends but a few times
it happened when I wasnt. My dads camcorder would turn off and on without
the battery in it. My sister who was 3 or 4 would see glow in the dark
people she called them walking around in her room. My brother and sister
would always end up sleeping in my parents room. When I moved out I lived
in a 2 bedroom apartment. I had a spirit that would turn my water in the
bathroom on and twice it turned my gas stove on. I used a oija board to
see what it was and supposedly his name was Zachary and he was a little
boy well he never really bothered me again but I think he followed me again
to my next house I lived in. well thats what I figured because small things
would happen like the apartment before. Well for the next few years I was
spirit free untill 2002 the house i am in now I havent heard or seen anything
but I always have that feeling of someonethere, things go missing then
reappear in weird places I have experienced sleep parylis I am not terrified
but I get scared and nervous at times. So far everything is fine and Im
gld I get to experience these things. Thank you for this site and letting
me have a place to write my experiences.I love your site I always visit
it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted Places - Nebraska</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: chrism@acton.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was checking the list of haunted places in Nebraska, and was shocked
to</B>
<BR><B>read that my son's former place of employment was listed.&nbsp;
He'd worked at</B>
<BR><B>Speed Indoor Racing for about 9 months.&nbsp; He'd never mentioned
anything</B>
<BR><B>happening there, so I asked him if he'd ever experienced anything.&nbsp;
Not</B>
<BR><B>being the kind of individual to take events too much to heart, he
started</B>
<BR><B>telling me that on the 2nd floor where the offices were located
it was</B>
<BR><B>constantly cold.&nbsp; He said it never mattered how hot the rest
of the building</B>
<BR><B>was, the office section was cold.&nbsp; He said there were 2 offices
that were</B>
<BR><B>locked and no one ever entered them.&nbsp; No one would ever give
him an answer</B>
<BR><B>as to why they remained locked.&nbsp; One night he and several co-workers
were in</B>
<BR><B>the employee break room after hours playing games, and they heard
someone</B>
<BR><B>run down the hallway pounding on all the doors and walls.&nbsp;
They were all</B>
<BR><B>there in the room, no one was ever located inside the building besides
the</B>
<BR><B>employees.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By:PAUL.E.MELODY@saic.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was stationed at Fort Benning we lived in a large old house
on main post in an area called the "Iron Triangle", built in the 1930s.&nbsp;
Every night between 11 PM and 1 AM we would hear someone walking down the
stairs.&nbsp; At times in the large bed room you could feel someone looking
at you, and on occasion, when sleeping, you could feel someone pressing
their hand to your back.&nbsp; At night on some occasions the door to the
small bed room would slam shut.&nbsp; A very spooky house.</B>
<BR><B>I have been told by the Post's Commanding general's wife at the
time that the old mansion is haunted by the daughter of a former commander
whose daughter committed suicide in the house in the 1950s.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Guardian Angel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: blondgirl8@netzero.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>First let me tell you how much I love your website. My story is not
so much a tale of a ghost sighting, it's more about love reaching out from
beyond the grave. My sister in law Lisa &amp; I were extremely close from
the first time we met. She passed away very suddenly at the age of 30 (
8 years ago in November). My family was devastated, we were very close
as I said, I felt like I had lost my best friend.</B>
<BR><B>About a year after she had passed I had gone to the cmemtary to
visit her &amp; as always was talking her, telling how things were.</B>
<BR><B>Before I left her I told her I just needed her to give me a sign,
something anything to let me know she was ok &amp; happy &amp; that she
was at peace &amp; was where she was supposed to be. I told her if she
could just do that for me then I would be ok &amp; I could go on.</B>
<BR><B>About a week had gone by &amp; nothing happened, no sign, nothing
out of the ordinary. I was beginning to tell myself to stop looking for
things.</B>
<BR><B>The Saturday after my trip to the cemetary I was at work ( I worked
in a bank at the time ) we were closing &amp; one of the tellers had a
difference so I went over to help. I began counting her cash drawer &amp;
when I got to her singles she had a bunch of them so I ran</B>
<BR><B>them through the money counter. The pile of singles got jammed &amp;
as I took them off the counter one bill lay face up on the machine, it
had two words written on it ( in strangely familiar writing I might add)
it said.....ANGEL LISA .</B>
<BR><B>I never questioned that angels exist after that, and I know now
that love stays with you even after death.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for letting me share this...</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Real Haunted Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:ckspeer77@prodigy.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Halea from Indiana, and I was looking at your web site.&nbsp;
I have always been very interested in paranormal activities throughout
the United States all&nbsp;&nbsp; my life. I am only 19 years old but love
to hear real ghosts stories, even my family knows I do. When I was 11 years
old my grandmother died of cancer, my fathers mother.&nbsp; My father grew
up in Haubstadt Indiana, a little town near Evansville and Princeton.&nbsp;
On the night of my grandmothers memorial service&nbsp; in 1995, my sister
and I was sleeping in her house on the sofa of her living room.&nbsp; It
was a sectional couch and I could see in the hall way and somewhat in the
kitchen, my sister could only see toward the front window in front of her.&nbsp;
My grandfather was sleeping in his room down the hall, which I could see
perfectly and my parents were sleeping in the next room.&nbsp; I never
saw anyone come through the hall way, but suddenly I heard foot steps in
the kitchen, a chair scoot out from the table, and a coffee cup being set
on the kitchen table.&nbsp; I also heard playing cards being shuffled as
she did every morning when she played solitaire.&nbsp; I was really scared
at that moment.&nbsp; I told my mother the next week and she told my father.&nbsp;
My father informed me later that my uncle heard her voice one night telling
him that she was alright and don't worry about her.&nbsp; This is not my
only encounter with paranormal activates.&nbsp; I will write more about
the other experience later.&nbsp; Thanks for your interesting web site,</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;Sensivity Passed</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tryche517@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am so glad that I am able to talk about the crazy things that have
happend in my home that my family lived in.&nbsp; My husband and my three
children were living in an older apartment in Santa Clara,Ca.&nbsp; First
of all, when i had my youngest I hemmoraged and was told NOT to have anymore
children for 5 years, as I would not be able to safely deliver.&nbsp; But
within a year after my daughter I became pregnant.&nbsp; About this time
I started to REALLY feel a negative entity around me and my kids(my husband
just ignored things).&nbsp; My 4 year old daughter at one time was being
choked, where she ended up with marks litterally on her throat.&nbsp; Soon
after that my son(2 yrs old) was forcebly knocked off his bed while I was
trying to get them both to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>I had always felt it in my apt, but I am a sensitive so I basically
just got used to it.&nbsp; When I did end up getting pregnant again, after
talking with my husband and doctors, I reluctantly opted to terminate it.&nbsp;
Within three days after I was being physically thrown from my bed(my husband
worked third shift so he wasnt home during this time) and punched and scratched
and litterally sat on.&nbsp; I finally decided to tell it that I would
not allow it to harm me and my children and that I was in control of everything
and that I w ted it out if it wasnt gong to be a positive force.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Things got better for a while and then I ended up having a
child(in spirit) popping up in the apt.&nbsp; THis one used to hide toys,
mess with my shower curtain(I always lock my bathroom door when I am in
the shower-PSYCHO got to me eh?) anyway, it would throw my clothes all
over the room and flicker the lights to where I just wanted to hurry up
and get rinsed and get out.&nbsp; He was facsinated with my husband- he
would yank at his shorts and pull his beard and at one point slapped him
on the butt while he was getting changed.&nbsp; He would play with my kids
and they would talk to me about him(how I know its was a "him").&nbsp;
This one I just left alone...</B>
<BR><B>We moved out and things are still crazy around my family.&nbsp;
My 12 year old(the 4 year old from before) is clairyvoyant, and actually
finds delight in answering MY questions about" who and what" when I encounter
a spirit.&nbsp; I'm not sure if its her age or my open mindedness about
all of this.&nbsp; but I'm glad that my sensitivity is passed to her.&nbsp;
thanks again.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Places in Rhode Island</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ramtail@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Deep in the woods of Foster, Rhode Island, along an old road lies
the remains of the Ramtail Factory. This once thriving woolen factory was
Foster’s largest attempt at a waterwheel driven mill so prominent of its
day. Now, just stone foundations, the area still marks its place in time
as Rhode Islands only officially haunted site as recognized in the 1885
State Census (page 36).</B>
<BR><B>If one is traveling down Route 6 west from Providence, soon you
will come to the Historical Hopkins Mill District. Ramtail Rd cuts across
the thoroughfare and it is just before the Bridge, on your left you will
see a field where the old road picks up to this most haunted locality.
But! dare not venture alone or after the suns rays have fallen beyond where
earth meets the sky for darkness cloaks the area with a sinister uncanny
pith. It is there, in the eerie darkness, where the sounds of footsteps
and the swinging of an old lantern can be heard as the ghost of Peleg Walker
makes his eternal rounds watching over the decrepit ruins of the factory
the same as he did in</B>
<BR><B>life.</B>
<BR><B>The factory was founded by William Potter as a fulling mill in 1799.&nbsp;
Local farmers took their wool to be cleaned and prepared for cloth. It
wasn't until 1813 when Potter bought more land to the south of the mill
and took on a partner. That man was his son-in-law, Peleg Walker. Together
they established the Foster Woolen Factory, more appropriately known as
the Ramtail Factory, along the banks of the Ponagansett River.</B>
<BR><B>It was now designated to weaving and spinning cloth. Every day&nbsp;
wagons rolled over the little</B>
<BR><B>bridge which traversed the river laden with deliveries to and from
the bustling complex. William Potter ran the business by day and Peleg
was given the task of night watchman. As soon as the twilight hours reached
the land, there was Peleg Walker, lantern in hand sauntering from&nbsp;
building to building keeping the nights concerns in harmony. When the sun
began to rise, he would then finish his shift by ringing the large bell
of the factory which beckoned the workers into their new work day. It was
a good partnership until one day.</B>
<BR><B>Somehow Potter and Walker had a dispute. There is no written record
of what the argument was about although it was said to be over money. Whatever
happened it was also known that the disagreement had enough impact on Peleg
that he was quoted as saying that they would someday soon have to take
the keys to the mill from a dead man’s pocket.</B>
<BR><B>His promise was fulfilled when, on the morning of May 19, 1822,
the echo of the work bell failed to permeate the air. The curious workers,
along with Mr. Potter, arrived at the mill only to find it locked up. They
broke into the main building where a grisly spectacle awaited them. There,
hanging from the bell rope was Peleg Walker. In the pocket of the 35 year
old Walker were the keys to the factory.</B>
<BR><B>He was given a Christian burial in the family plot overlooking what
is now Hopkin’s Mill Pond. Everything could continue as before, or so they
thought.&nbsp; A few nights later, the bell began tolling at the stroke
of midnight. The awaken little hamlet apprehensively approached the mill.
When they entered the building, the strange tolling ceased. After a search
turned up nobody else in the structure, it was once again secured for the
night. The pealing of the bell filled the air again the next night at the
witching hour and, as before, with no evidence of foul play. The Potter’s,
now in dismay, removed the rope but this did not stop old Peleg from his
nightly succession. The phantom ringing invaded the dead of night once
again and the Potter’s were forced to remove the bell once and for all.</B>
<BR><B>One night, however, the villagers were awaken by a frightful disquiet.
It was the mill running full tilt. The frightened inhabitants ogled in
disbelief as the factory ran by its own volition. Every wheel, spindle,
and loom was turning at&nbsp; full tilt. Even the giant water wheel used
to run the mill was turning opposite the flow of the stream!!! When the
same incident took place a few nights later, the workers began to leave
the cursed grounds for fear of their lives.</B>
<BR><B>The ghost of Peleg Walker was soon to be seen by a few men walking
by the factory one night. They witnessed the glowing nightshade walking
about the mill buildings with a lantern in its hand. The men knew by its
distinctive features that it was the spirit of Peleg Walker.</B>
<BR><B>By now the struggling business was too far in debt to continue.
No one would work in a haunted factory where the specter had hung himself.
By 1850, the Ramtail factory was no longer open. The factory's demise is
credited to the haunting of Peleg Walker in the Foster Historical records
book in the Rhode Island Historical Library. The whole mill complex was
burned to its foundations in the 1880’s by an immense blaze. It is these
very foundations that still sit portentously in the thicket of Foster even
as you read this narrative.</B>
<BR><B>My investigations with the ghostly site began on a fall day in 1993
when I, and a friend visited the site via the old road which still runs
passage through the forest. After crossing over the remnants of the old
bridge, (now a flooded out&nbsp; beaver dam) we came upon the ruins. Laid
out precariously were several foundations and some small rusty artifacts.
One foundation was very large in area. This was the main building. We now
knew what to expect on our late night return.</B>
<BR><B>It wasn't until several vigils did we witness a most hair raising
spectacle. My friend, John, and I stood on the old road overlooking the
main foundation when it happened! About 45 minutes had passed when we witnessed
a glowing oblong ball of light emerge from behind the trees and hover in
the air within the foundation. It stirred about within the foundation for
about 40 seconds then continued on its way back into the trees. Later I
would realize that the specter of light was hovering at the height of what
was once the first floor of the factory.</B>
<BR><B>Another nightly visit turned a few skeptics into trembling believers.
As we stood in the eerie blanket of darkness, there slowly came near, the
sound of a lantern swinging to and fro. Now it was right beside us passing
by us and returning towards us again yet there was no visible form to be
seen carrying the phantom torch as the creaking filled our ears causing
the very hair on our necks and arms to stand tall. Another night at the
coveted sight would give me the same show as before. Peleg was still making
his rounds in the old factory just as he did in life. All were truly convinced
that the Ramtail Factory is truly haunted.</B>
<BR><B>We all think that Peleg still makes his eternal rounds of the same
place he so lived in life. On his stone the inscription reads “Life how
short eternity how long.” Has he been fated to follow those very words
forever by haunting the site where he took his life? If so, then Ramtail
factory will always be guarded by its watcher and even if you don’t see
him, one visit and you yourself will be convinced that the factory is indeed
still alive and full of spirit</B><B></B>

<P><B>UNCLASSIFIED other experiences.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Gemma.Cox@defence.gov.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi I thought I'd send you some more of my experiences,</B>
<BR><B>(last story insights into my future) well this all happened a few
years</B>
<BR><B>later</B>
<BR><B>When I was going into my senior years of high school I was starting
to feel</B>
<BR><B>as though I didn't fit in. Don't get me wrong I had loads of friends
but it</B>
<BR><B>was more within me that I felt I needed some answers and to meet
like minded</B>
<BR><B>people.</B>
<BR><B>I joined a meditation group, we would meet once a week and each
member of</B>
<BR><B>the group would have a turn in giving a lesson. (we had healers,
psychics,</B>
<BR><B>naturopaths, hypnotherapists, counsellors. You name it we had all
sorts)</B>
<BR><B>over the span of the year we would learn about and experience crystal</B>
<BR><B>healing, natural therapies, past life regression, tarot readings,
astral</B>
<BR><B>travel, aura photography, we learnt heaps everyone would contribute
I was in</B>
<BR><B>my element.</B>
<BR><B>I also think this is what opened me up to what I am now.</B>
<BR><B>When I began working for a company called global treasures, I had
no idea</B>
<BR><B>how many amazing people and non-physical people I would encounter.</B>
<BR><B>I began to study healing (hands on and through the will of my mind)
my boss</B>
<BR><B>would help me by ordering in all the books I needed, I think the
more I</B>
<BR><B>learned spiritually ( tarot, crystals, palmistry, interpret aura's)
must of</B>
<BR><B>opened a gateway of some sort to the other dimensions.</B>
<BR><B>I had a customer come in and tell me I needed to learn to defend
myself, he</B>
<BR><B>could sense many beings around me. My guardians were always close
by, but</B>
<BR><B>because the more spiritual I would become, the more attractive my
energy</B>
<BR><B>would be to more needy, less powerful spirits, and that could be
potentially</B>
<BR><B>dangerous because I was so spiritually advanced for my age, I could
be taken</B>
<BR><B>advantage of. I was sixteen turning seventeen and although some
my age might</B>
<BR><B>think this guy was crazy it made a lot of sense. I think my fun-loving</B>
<BR><B>nature made me seem some what powerful to them but my customer was
right&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>needed a lot of training for what was a head of me but I didn't
think I</B>
<BR><B>would so much practice so soon.</B>
<BR><B>BABY STORY</B>
<BR><B>this is in no way a scary story</B>
<BR><B>I woke up early in the morning and noticed what I can only explain
as a</B>
<BR><B>shadowy figure in the top corner of my room. Being half asleep I
passed it</B>
<BR><B>off as a dream, as I was tossing and turning to get comfortable
I got a</B>
<BR><B>glimpse of it again but this time I noticed what it was, it was
a baby</B>
<BR><B>floating in my room. A overwhelming sense of calm swept over me
as it smiled</B>
<BR><B>at me and I felt so much love, it was like as though I knew it,
as if it</B>
<BR><B>were a soul mate coming to say hello. I slowly drifted back to a
deep sleep</B>
<BR><B>and when I awoke for breakfast I thought it was a dream. I sat down
watching</B>
<BR><B>TV and my nephew who was visiting ( only two) with his mum from
Britain</B>
<BR><B>pointed at the ceiling and said "baby, baby" I then knew I wasn't
the only</B>
<BR><B>one to have seen the little baby.</B>
<BR><B>Two weeks later my brother and his fiancee were playing with the
digital</B>
<BR><B>camera and when my brother looked at the photo he took there was
a</B>
<BR><B>translucent baby sitting beside my brothers fiancee on the couch
smiling.</B>
<BR><B>I've looked everywhere for the photo, we printed about atleast ten
from the</B>
<BR><B>camera but it was about two years ago now so I wouldn't even know
where to</B>
<BR><B>start looking. All I know now is a couple of days after the photo
was</B>
<BR><B>discovered my mums good friend lost her baby, she was six months&nbsp;
pregnant.</B>
<BR><B>ANGELS VS EARTH BOUND SPIRITS</B>
<BR><B>This is one of the more full on stories of mine some people might
find it</B>
<BR><B>hard to believe and some might not. Either way I'm going to tell
it,</B>
<BR><B>Like my boss had advised me I began to read about angels, how to
contact</B>
<BR><B>them, ask for they're guidance that sort of thing. I've never been
religious</B>
<BR><B>as such, I don't believe in the devil. I think that's something
the church</B>
<BR><B>made up in the middle ages to have power over people by making them
fear</B>
<BR><B>anything paranormal or the unexplained (eg all the people who have
died by</B>
<BR><B>the hands of the church in history because of ignorance) don't get
me wrong</B>
<BR><B>though I do believe there is a creator but I think there's no need
to have</B>
<BR><B>to go to a church to worship and share beliefs. There's one thing
I do know</B>
<BR><B>and that is there are a lot of confused spirits who die unexpectedly
( war,</B>
<BR><B>murder) who choose to roam the earth. When they are ready to accept
it they</B>
<BR><B>will pass over, depending on the way a person dies I think depends
on how</B>
<BR><B>friendly a spirit may come across. Some spirits didn't want to die,
and</B>
<BR><B>instead of crossing over and beginning a new life opt to hang around
earth</B>
<BR><B>until they can communicate they're story either to loved ones or
to anyone</B>
<BR><B>who will listen. Often people that are sceptic and closed off might
not hear</B>
<BR><B>or see spirits, but they have a lot of ways of communicating with
the</B>
<BR><B>living. (that can sometimes mean by destruction of property) and
there are</B>
<BR><B>also spirits that loved there lives so much they continue to live
it out</B>
<BR><B>even though they are dead and I think this is frustrating for them
to not be</B>
<BR><B>able to communicate with the living the way they would like. Which
then</B>
<BR><B>results in them trying to control, and sometimes destroy our lives
eg</B>
<BR><B>poltergeists.</B>
<BR><B>It was around 3:30 am and I was really restless that night I got
up to get a</B>
<BR><B>drink then went back to bed it seemed to be really windy in my room
all of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden but I didn't have my window open due to the storm earlier
on that</B>
<BR><B>evening. I closed my door and got back in bed I started hearing
noises like</B>
<BR><B>faint whispers, I dismissed it as the wind out side, but then I
felt a</B>
<BR><B>overwhelming sadness in the room I opened my eyes and at that second
my door</B>
<BR><B>opened with such force my whole body filled with such fear. My heart
was</B>
<BR><B>beating so fast at this point, it was as though a cyclone was in
my bedroom</B>
<BR><B>my blinds were bashing against the window really hard. My room filled
with a</B>
<BR><B>bluish-white light and that's when I could see the outline of atleast
twenty</B>
<BR><B>or more figures surrounding me. They were whispering my name but
they're</B>
<BR><B>voices sounded muffled (sort of echo's) they all asked me to help
them cross</B>
<BR><B>over they said "gemma , help us please help us we want to cross
over" and</B>
<BR><B>that's when I remember what my customer said so I simply replied
"I'm not</B>
<BR><B>ready to help just yet I don't know what to do I need some training
before I</B>
<BR><B>can help you". I then closed my eyes and asked for guidance from
archangel</B>
<BR><B>Michael to protect me and take over the situation. almost instantly
a</B>
<BR><B>outline of a well built man stood beside me and white light filled
my room</B>
<BR><B>all was now quiet. As the light slowly dispersed, above my bed were
a pair</B>
<BR><B>of outstretched wings.</B>
<BR><B>Now I know that if I hadn't asked for guidance I could have been
in trouble</B>
<BR><B>I wasn't properly trained to handle the situation and being so young
the</B>
<BR><B>spirits could have well over powered me. Now before I go to bed
each night I</B>
<BR><B>always imagine a white bubble surrounding my house and that of family
and</B>
<BR><B>friends and haven't had any problems with them since, but that's
not to say</B>
<BR><B>they aren't going to try again they may wait until I'm older</B><B></B>

<P><B>In 1987 a friend of mine moved from Melbourne to a country town called</B>
<BR><B>Kickatinalong in Australia,&nbsp; .&nbsp; It was a one horse town
with lots of</B>
<BR><B>history behind it with outlaws (bushrangers), drovers(cowboys) and</B>
<BR><B>drifters.&nbsp; It was on a main cattle route for selling and transported
by</B>
<BR><B>train to other places.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in later decades due to droughts
and recession</B>
<BR><B>in the economy lots of people had sold up and moved to the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Those</B>
<BR><B>who stay are retired farmers or local aborigines from the Flagon
tribe.</B>
<BR><B>He bought the hotel/pub(bar), as the town was on a come back with
the</B>
<BR><B>tourism boom, he thought it was a good investment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
hotel was called</B>
<BR><B>the Wheelabarrow which consists of a one level building with a verandah</B>
<BR><B>running around the outside.&nbsp; The bar area had&nbsp; some tables
and barstools</B>
<BR><B>around, and a kitchen behind the whole floor was wooden.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It had a history</B>
<BR><B>of fights, murders and deaths through the years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
first week he shut</B>
<BR><B>the place down for renovations, which when ahead without incident.</B>
<BR><B>After the first night of trading as by law was at 1200 p.m. until
10 am the</B>
<BR><B>next day.&nbsp; He cleaned up and locked the place up,&nbsp; making
sure to check the</B>
<BR><B>toilets so no one was hiding there that might rob the place.&nbsp;
Then went</B>
<BR><B>back to one of the shacks to the rear of the Hotel, two rooms in
each,</B>
<BR><B>there were seven of them and he used one as a house and the others
as hotel</B>
<BR><B>rooms for the tourists.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning he came in early to do&nbsp; breakfast for the
tourists staying</B>
<BR><B>in one of the shacks</B>
<BR><B>As he walked into the bar from the kitchen it looked like a fight
had taken</B>
<BR><B>place as three tables were laying on their side and some bar stools
knocked</B>
<BR><B>over.&nbsp; Three bottles laid on the floor empty and two classes
on the bar one</B>
<BR><B>half full.&nbsp; He called the police they checked the doors and
windows with no</B>
<BR><B>sign of break in either inside or outside, and they filed a report.&nbsp;
One of</B>
<BR><B>policeman suggested he get a dog, and lock in up in the bar at night
and it</B>
<BR><B>would scare off anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same incident happened every
morning for</B>
<BR><B>three days so he brought a dog from a local half Germansheppard
and</B>
<BR><B>dingo(Australian wild dog).&nbsp; He lifted it locked up overnight
and the next</B>
<BR><B>morning when he opened the door he just about fell over when the
dog bolted</B>
<BR><B>out the door with its tail between its legs.&nbsp; It was the last
he saw of it.</B>
<BR><B>He walked into the bar again and the same sight as before with the
chairs</B>
<BR><B>and tables.&nbsp; So he thought he would get to the bottom of it
and sleep in</B>
<BR><B>the bar over night.&nbsp;&nbsp; He closed the bar at 1200 pm as
usual, checked the</B>
<BR><B>windows and toilets.&nbsp; He set up a stretcher to sleep on behind
the bar and</B>
<BR><B>then read a book for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then turned the lights
off.&nbsp; Two hours</B>
<BR><B>later he woke up to go to the toilet as he stood up he saw a white
mist</B>
<BR><B>floating around the entrance to the pub door it looked like smoke
he</B>
<BR><B>thought to himself shit fire but when he looked again it had a green
tinge</B>
<BR><B>to it and it started to float towards the bar the hair on his back
started</B>
<BR><B>to raise as he stood there unable to move in shock and as the mist
came</B>
<BR><B>closer it started to form into a human shape.&nbsp; Then it stopped
in front of</B>
<BR><B>the bar he saw it completely form into a complete human form of
what looked</B>
<BR><B>like a drifter with a old hat and old clothes with tatters and rips.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>face half shaven but he could see through it.&nbsp; Before he could
do or say</B>
<BR><B>anything it spoke saying give me a drink.</B>
<BR><B>Standing there scared sh*****s!, and unable to move because of shock
!,and</B>
<BR><B>horror of at having a ghost in front of him! damaging a drink, no

<P><B>I lived in a large house at the above address. a week after moving
in i had strange dreams of leaving my room and the house was furnished
in 1940's style. One of the rooms that we used as a bedroom was once probably
a dining room . In my dream i entered the room and saw a woman in a dark
blue dress with silver earings she had dark hair and red lipstick. She
was at a desk , lit by lamplight speaking on the telephone ( gossiping
about someone) Next I saw a shadow on the wall of a hand holding a large
knife, then i heard the sound of material ripping. Next I saw blood fingermarks
on the wall leading to the bathroom. I awoke in terror and could hear noises
in the hall. Although i was desperate to go to the bathroom, something
told me not to leave my room at that time, The noises continued for about
a half hour , finally i felt it was ok to leave my room. Later i removed
som wooden sheeting from one of the doors in this area of the hall and
found a lot of marks like the marks of a large knife having stabbed the
door . around the lock the door was almost destroyed. Many&nbsp; other
inhabitants of the house heard strange noises from this part of the hall
in the middle of the night. Others entered the house and immediately felt
uneasy. One who was never told of the experiences walked in the front door
and pointed to that area of the hall and said "There is something evil
in this house and it is there" Noone ever felt really comfortable in the
house. I hung a crusifix in the hall and no occurrences of a major sort
occurred but the cold feeling in that part of the hall , the noises and
bad feelings never stopped in the 3 and a half years i was there. We never
found&nbsp; out the house's history but were relieved to eventually leave.
The house still stands</B>

<BR><B>The Evil</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pbldgreceptionist@bv.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;hey what's up? I have been reading these stories for about
a year now. Out of 7000 stories I have probably read about 3000 of them
and counting. Being fascinated by the unknown has propelled me to endless
nights of reading at work. Most of the stories I have read consist of the
same things, strange tapings, dark figures, glowing eyes, and cold spots
even in the dead of summer, but some have more content than the usual paranormal
activity. For years now I have been able to see and feel more than the
eye can see.&nbsp; I'm 21 now and have experienced quite a few activities
that are considered unknown. The first ghost I can remember was when I
was about 2 or 3 and we lived in Kansas city, mo. I had major problems
getting to sleep (still do) when I was young. A ghost came to me in my
room one night, and told me his name was grandpa bowers. He looked transparent,
but I could still see details about him.&nbsp; He stood about 5 ft tall,
but was bent over with a cane, as alot of elderly people are. He had long
white beard and was very kind and I can remember the bright light that
surrounded him.&nbsp; to this day I am unsure if grandpa bowers was a ghost
or an angle.&nbsp; He would periodically come to me in the night when I
was scared to read night time stories until I would fall asleep.&nbsp;
My folks have told me when I was young I would talk to an imaginary friend
that they could not see or feel. He stopped popping in when I was around
5 and we moved out of that house to Lee's summit, mo and I have never seen
him again. But the reason im writing hear is a ghost I have seen in my
buddy's house. When we hang out there strange things happen. We hear someone
walking up stairs when we are downstairs.&nbsp; the sink turns on by itself
and doors open and shut&nbsp; at certain times of the day. but the scary
things happen the spare bedroom.&nbsp; In here I believe there is a evil
or very sad and angry spirit that wants to harm us. The strange thing is
that the closet has a box in it. Not a ordinary box, but one that has been
carpeted over and takes up most of the room in the closet. It stretches
about 4ft vertical and about 5 ft long and is about 3 ft deep. Now a number
of things run through my mind when I think what could be in that box.&nbsp;
One day I was in that room helping move a bunk bed to my friends storage
unit. I was alone unbolting the bed with a screwdriver when I heard some
whispering coming from the closet. Thinking that it was my friends downstairs
I just ignored it. Then in a heartbeat the room became dreadfully cold
and I could see my breath. about a minute later I could feel this presence
walk out of the closet even though I could not see the door open. almost
as if it walked through the door. I stopped unscrewing and felt this presence
right over my shoulder looking down at me. I looked up, but saw nothing.
two seconds later I was being thrown across the room into the opposite
wall. I hit the wall back first and fell to the ground. I had no idea what
the hell had just happened, and my friends came running up thinking I had
dropped the bed on the floor and found me looking at them horrified.&nbsp;
I was asked what happened and I told them everything. They sure as hell
believed me too. Rob&nbsp; told me that one night he was sleeping in that
room and felt something rubbing on his crouch. Thinking that it was his
girlfriend he thought nothing of it, but the rubbing turned into a scratching
and then into a clawing until he ripped the blankets off and ran downstairs.
his girlfriend was asleep in the couch in the living room. Something locked
his 5 year old son in the closet and we could hear him screaming from out
back. when we ran up stairs josh was in shock and had bruises all over
his body. we got a priest to come and bless the house but he was terrified
to enter that particular room and said there was something in there that
had red eyes and was waiting for him to enter so it could try to eat his
sole.(or so he told us hysterically) so he left screaming at the top of
his lungs until he got into his car and left the driveway. We decided to
put a digital camera in the room one night with infra red and night vision.
After reviewing the tape the next day we were horrified of the thing we
saw. A dark figure walking out of the closet that turned and seemed to
have noticed the camera. It picked it up and looked straight into the lens
and all we could see was red eyes and a devilish grin with jagged teeth
protruding from within. Almost as if it were saying I SEE YOU WATCHING
ME. Needless to say I have never returned to that house and my buddy has
since moved out. I could tell you ghost stories all night but I need to
get to work. later on.</B>

<BR><B>The Kid</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Orfx2003@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I, as well as almost everybody who probably looks at this site, am
a strong believer in ghost. I have had a few ghostly experiences. Most
of them happened when I was a little kid and I don't remember them to well.
But lately I've been seeing this kid at my school bus stop. It's only happened
like three times so I'm still a little skeptical he's real. The first time
it happened I just passed by him on the school bus. He just kept staring
at me. I didn't think anything of it then. I turned around to talk to my
friend for a second and when I turned back around he was gone.&nbsp; But
the second time it was a little bit weirder. It was in the morning time
like at 6 or something. I thought it was a little strange for a kid his
age to be out that late (he looks about 8 years old, and he is always wearing
the same clothes red T-shirt blue jeans). And today while I was waiting
for my Mom to pick me up I saw him walking up the street and a car drove
by him he was gone. I got up and walked to where he was, but I didn't see
him I didn't even see any footprints where he had been walking.</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 35 years old I stayed over my mom's house and I
slept in my old room. My young daughter and my mom slept together in another
room and while they were sleeping, I was watching television but I was
not too interested but I was watching it anyway suddenly, I heard coming
from the balcony behind my bed board someone knocking glass window behind
the bed board. Whoever was knocked three to four times, but I didn't&nbsp;
try to see who it was since I knew that there wasn't anybody awake at the
time, especially that I knew that it was impossible to be someone out there
since my mother's appartment is up on the 27th floor. The knocked continued
but I still didn't answer then, I heard a lady talking while knocking;
she called my name more than three times while saying "Are you there? It's
me. You don't recognized me? I want to see you." I still didn't respond
to the person or thing. I slowly low down the television so she won't know
that I was there, but she continued knocking while calling and telling
me what she wanted. finally, I got up and went to sleep with my mom in
the other room. My mother asked me what was wrong and I told her I talked
to you tomorrow about it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I personally have been up that way and though i don't personally
have a story to share, i will say that even being in the driveway in a
car on a bright sunny day gave me the chills. since my visit (with a friend
who has his own stories of the place) i have kept an eye out for other
peoples' stories. i have read a few entries of people online who go Geocaching
there. One even mentioned being freaked out. You may want to visit the
webpage and read through the entries and see if there are any stories of
interest.</B>
<BR><B>When i was there two summers ago with my friend he was shocked and
i was scared at the sign we seen up... they were planning on turning it
into a residential and commercial complex. I haven't looked into the matter
since my return from the vacation a year and a half ago; until tonight.
...they are going through with it! *faint* I feel sorry for those people.</B>
<BR><B>If the porch didn't scare me into screaming, driving by the basement
thingy sure did. I was certain something was watching from the darkness.
Sure, the grounds and building are stunningly beautiful... but the past
and the aura of this place far outweigh the visual splendor.</B>

<P><B>About 20 years ago, my mother was going through a very difficult
divorce.</B>
<BR><B>With 5 boys and the future of single parenthood, she had a lot to
worry</B>
<BR><B>about.&nbsp; She lost what would have been son #6 in 1966 to what
can easily be</B>
<BR><B>managed today; born three months premature.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last
few nights she spent</B>
<BR><B>in our old house prior to us leaving on the couch.&nbsp; She had
my younger</B>
<BR><B>brother who was 2 at the time sleeping next to her.&nbsp; It was
especially hard</B>
<BR><B>for her to drift off because the end of her marriage was near.&nbsp;
She finally</B>
<BR><B>was able to go to sleep, but not for long.&nbsp; She was awoken
by the sound of</B>
<BR><B>shuffling feet in the footed pajama bottoms we used to have as kids.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>opened up one eye, then two.&nbsp; Standing right there before her
was a small</B>
<BR><B>boy with pajama bottoms and a striped shirt.&nbsp; She wondered
how my little</B>

reached back</B>
<BR><B>behind her, and he was still there asleep.&nbsp; Her heart was pounding!&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>blinked long and hard, only to open them again and the little glowing

<P><B>Interesting Addition</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: torino1975@comcast.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I recently told you of my experience of the house I had lived in
when I was younger…and this past Christmas my own father told me the most
amazing thing I’ve ever heard from his lips (I told you in recent experience
that he heard/saw something at the “Willis Street” house, etc) and when
he told me this, I simply sat and stared at him.&nbsp; For him to have
told me this tidbit just proved to me just how far he has come to having
“things” happen around him, and I am kind of excited, scared, and a bit
shaken.</B>
<BR><B>My family moved to the state we are living in now July, 1992.&nbsp;
We were 1 &frac12; hour drive from my parent’s house, my old hometown.&nbsp;
Because of us being gone for many years (military) we were excited to be
back around family, even if it did take us an hour or so drive. We’d go
home every weekend and every chance we could!&nbsp; My parents enjoyed
having their grandchildren around and I enjoyed being back home and seeing
old friends, old hangouts.</B>
<BR><B>Whenever we visited, my two boys would sleep in my old bedroom in
a double bed that belonged to my grandmother.&nbsp; The first six months
to a year that we’d visit on weekends and holidays, it seemed to be normal
visits.&nbsp; But then my middle child would suddenly request to bring
his sleeping bag and sleep on the floor.&nbsp; I thought it was because
his older brother would thrash around in his sleep and kick at him.&nbsp;
He only said, “No, it is too crowded.”&nbsp; I took it to mean that my
oldest son took up too much room.&nbsp; It got to be so bad, that I finally
made a pallet on the floor with blankets, sheets, and pillows for him to
rest.&nbsp; He didn’t like that, either.&nbsp; It kept happening until
he started to sneak downstairs at night to sleep on the couch, we’d wake
up the next morning to find him sound asleep with his pillow and blanket.</B>
<BR><B>The only explanation he’d give us was “it’s too crowded.”&nbsp;
And naturally, we thought it was because he wasn’t used to sleeping or
sharing a bed with his brother and was used&nbsp; to “spreading out” without
touching anyone else.&nbsp; It wasn’t until two years after we moved here
and started our weekend visits home that my oldest son started to complain.&nbsp;
There’d be many nights I’d “check on them” before going to bed and find
both boys on the floor, blankets and sheets and pillows around them, sound
asleep beside each other.&nbsp; This truly baffled me as the mattress wasn’t
too hard or too soft.&nbsp; (I am getting to my Dad’s “confession” I am
just now putting the “starting bits” or the baffling parts of the puzzle
into place!)&nbsp; I always made sure the bed was fresh, spraying Lysol
on the mattress (no one slept on it as it was now used as a guest room
and sometimes it was musty or “smelled funny”) along with fresh linen,
etc.</B>
<BR><B>Well, the boys grew older and they stopped coming down on weekends
with my husband, daughter, and I.&nbsp; My dad has health issues and has
to wear an oxygen mask when he sleeps and the machine that delivers his
oxygen to him is extremely loud so now he sleeps in “my” old room while
my mum still sleeps in their room.&nbsp; My husband and I have my brother’s
old room and my daughter has what used to be the “TV” room my brother and
I had when we were young.</B>
<BR><B>ANYWAY…we were recently home for the holidays and we got to talking
around the dinner table and I had mentioned that I had written about my
“Willis Street” experiences and submitted them to a haunted house site
on the internet.&nbsp; Of course hubby rolled his eyes and made his usual
wisecracks and my mum just nodded and my brother looked like he was trying
to ignore me.&nbsp; My dad kept on eating and my son looked at me and said,
“You ever experience anything in this house growing up?”</B>
<BR><B>I said not really, except once or twice having the icy-cold fingers
of fear that someone was again watching me or standing near me, but nothing
to really verbally express.</B>
<BR><B>Then (this simply amazes me to this very second that my dad admitted
this!!!)&nbsp; my dad looked up and said to my son,&nbsp; “I now know why
you refused to sleep in my bed.”</B>
<BR><B>My son just laughed and said, Why is that, Pops?&nbsp; And my dad
said, “When I first moved in ‘that back bedroom’ I was lonely for your
grandmother.&nbsp; We hadn’t slept apart since marrying in 1963.&nbsp;
But one night, I had settled down and taken my pills and put my oxygen
mask on and was almost asleep when I felt the side of the bed go down as
if someone was getting in bed with me.&nbsp; I thought it was your grandmother
so I reached over to pat her hand and there as no one&nbsp; there.”&nbsp;
(I must have been gaping like an idiot at this!) and I looked at my son
and he was just staring at my father.&nbsp; He went on to say that it didn’t
happen all the time, but from time to time he’d be almost asleep and the
bed would creak and sag as if someone was getting in bed with him.&nbsp;
Then he told us at the table Christmas Day that the only thing he could
figure out is that it was his mother, my grandmother and my children’s
great-grandmother climbing into bed with him as the bed he was sleeping
in was hers and my grandfather’s marital bed (new mattresses of course
*heehee*) from when they were first married, that is how solid the bed
and bed frame was built!</B>
<BR><B>Now, like I said, it simply amazed me to no end that my father would
tell us this, and be so honest and straight forward about it and so nonchalant.&nbsp;
I mean, I expected him any second to laugh and say, “Gotcha!” but he didn’t.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say, I won’t go in that bedroom at night and sometimes
when I am in the upstairs hallway getting ready to use the upstairs bathroom,
I’ll get this “feeling” not scared, icy cold with fright, or anything to
concern me, but it is a “feeling” just the same.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for letting me share.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; There are some things
in this world that happens that we just can’t explain!</B>

<BR><B>My Friend and My Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jossy57@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>OK, my friend and I have had several ghost story experiences together.</B>
<BR><B>Where we live, is by a small forest, at the edge of a clearing.&nbsp;
My friend was coming to visit me at my house (which is a good, 10 minute
drive) from town.&nbsp; That night, my parents were out, and we were watching
some movies, and eating *too much*.&nbsp; Now, I have always felt uneasy
in that house....and for nights, even at the age of 15 I would sneak into
my parent's room at night, and sleep on the floor, just like a small child,
so, you could imagine how scary it was for the 2 of us, alone in the house.&nbsp;
In the middle of one movie, I heard a strange noise upstairs...after jumping
in my friends lap, we finally worked up the courage to go upstairs and
check it out.&nbsp; As I got to the top of the staircase, I looked out
the window, and from it, it looked like a strange figure running across
the yard, and into the forest.&nbsp; The only problem, was that the figure
was running on all fours, the way people do *spider walking* and I literally
went into hysterics!&nbsp; My friend, who isn't as skeptical as she was
then, did not believe a word I was saying, but called my parents and told
them to come home.&nbsp; I don't understand why she didn't see it, but
I do know that I did, and I will not EVER to this day, live in a secluded
area again.&nbsp; It has been 4 years since this event, and I'm in college
now.&nbsp; There are times when I look off into space, or into a dark hallway,
and I still think I can see the silhouette of the figure..running past
me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have new information from the local Methodist church in the area
about this house.&nbsp; One of the</B>
<BR><B>residents who lived there was a insane man who went around and broke
everything inside.&nbsp; I have</B>
<BR><B>also noticed there is no mailbox or address numbers at the house.&nbsp;
A church member told me there</B>
<BR><B>are a lot of wild cats living in there too.&nbsp; Today, the garage
now has a tarp over it, the boat</B>
<BR><B>that used to be in there has been taken away and a front end loader
now sits in front of it.</B>
<BR><B>There were windows on the side facing Johnson Rd. that would stand
open all day and all night but</B>
<BR><B>now they are closed and locked.&nbsp; The house has also been sold
to a new owner so it looks like the</B>
<BR><B>house is finally going to have someone living in it again after
several years of being vacant.</B>
<BR><B>The house must have sold quickly because I saw a realtor's sign
for about a week but the following</B>
<BR><B>week, it was gone.&nbsp; The person who bought it may have bought
the land instead of the house so it</B>
<BR><B>may be torn down and a new house may go up in its place or as I

<BR><B>Hotel Room</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kellidawn@union-tel.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have recently started traveling alot due to my job.&nbsp; I stayed
in a hotel in Wheatland, Wyoming from Sunday, Jan. 11 until this morning,
Jan 15.&nbsp; The first night I was there I felt as if someone was watching
me soon after I got checked in.</B>
<BR><B>I got settled in and turned the lights and tv off to go to sleep.&nbsp;
I had just gotten comfortable when I felt something lightly punch me in
the center of my back.&nbsp; Of course I jumped up and turned on all the
lights and searched the room.&nbsp; Nothing there.&nbsp; I decided it must
have been a muscle spasm (not many muscles on your spine, but it was as
good as I could come up with).</B>
<BR><B>I turned the lights back off and heard someone walking back and
forth upstairs.&nbsp; It was annoying since it was after midnight at this
point.&nbsp; I could not sleep.</B>
<BR><B>After some time I began to wear down and decided maybe there was
something there I can't explain.&nbsp; So I actually began speaking to
it.&nbsp; Keep in mind I am a very stable person who handles stress the
way most chew a piece of gum.&nbsp; I sat up and told the air "Whatever
you are, if you need something from me tell me now.&nbsp; Otherwise please
leave me alone so I can sleep.&nbsp; I have five children to support and
have to rest for work tomorrow."&nbsp; The footsteps subsided and I did
get to sleep without further incident.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning I got brave and told the cleaning girl about it.&nbsp;
She told me that most of the staff will not go into that wing of the hotel.&nbsp;
She said I was not the only person who has had wierdness in that room.&nbsp;
(Then WHY rent the room to begin with???)</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, the manager offered to move me, but I declined.&nbsp; Partly
out of curiosity, partly because I have this strong desire to never be
controlled or manipulated.&nbsp; So I stayed.&nbsp; The manager told me
that she believes the older part of the hotel and the kitchen in the restaraunt
are both haunted.</B>
<BR><B>Basically the question I have is about my four days in room 41.</B>
<BR><B>After the second night, my bed would be bumped or the footsteps
would start as soon as I began to stretch out to sleep.&nbsp; I began to
experiment a bit.&nbsp; As long as there was any activity in the room,
whatever it was would leave me alone.&nbsp; If I would turn out the lights
and tv, it would start in again.&nbsp; I could sleep undisturbed if I left
the television on and I could even mute it.&nbsp; Otherwise, my bed would
be bumped or my hair would get tostled or the footsteps would start.&nbsp;
Oh, and about the footsteps..............I didn't realize since it was
dark when I checked in, but this was a single story building.&nbsp; There
is no upstairs.&nbsp; The manager told me that the footsteps is the biggest
complaint she has heard from other people who have stayed in that wing.</B>
<BR><B>Okay, my question.&nbsp; It seemed to me that this, whatever, was
bored.&nbsp; As long as there was activity in the room it was pacified.&nbsp;
When the room was quiet, I got disturbed.</B>
<BR><B>I know nothing about these things, but it seems almost logical.&nbsp;
If I were trapped in a room that was usually empty, I would want to take
advantage of the rare times there was anything happening.&nbsp; Any opinions?</B>
<BR><B>By the way, I went so far as to leave the tv on when I was out of
the room.&nbsp; I kinda felt sorry for it.&nbsp; And yes I will stay at
that hotel again in a few weeks and in room 41 if I get assigned that room.&nbsp;
What, am I nuts!!</B>

<BR><B>Monroe and Adrian Mi</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: joefsiegel@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I'm writing this because I have experience with two of your haunted
places and I know of another two, one unconfirmed that I didn't notice
on your site, the river raisin battlefield and an old house on Macomb St.&nbsp;
I grew up in Monroe, Mi right on Elm street down the road from the old
burnt down paper mill and down the road from a River Raisin battlefield.&nbsp;
I remember when the paper mill burnt down and I'm not sure why it seems
so haunted because I don't know of anybody actually dying in there. But
I have to say, I've seen shadows moving in there and not animal shadows
and I've been in there once and the feeling was enough to make you never
want to go back, but on top of that I heard voices and shouting and felt
taps on my back and shoulders.&nbsp; At the River Raisin Battlefield if
you go back in the woods you can hear voices and if you take pictures you
get those weird little balls of light.&nbsp; At the house on Macomb St.
I personally have seen ghostly figures moving upstairs when the house was
uninhabited also I've heard plenty of stories about the place such as things
moving through the garden at night. Another weird thing with that house
is that it's constantly up for sale at least until the last people who
bought it, it might be up for sale again. As I was growing up someone would
by the old house then two weeks later they were selling it, it went on
like that for years and years.</B>
<BR><B>The second place I have first hand experience with is Siena Heights
University in Adrian Mi. I went to college there.&nbsp; I had friends in
Room 211 and the place does still have strange things happen there.&nbsp;
Plus a few friends and myself had ghostly experiences in an old bomb shelter
in the building. We heard footsteps and things moving when nothing else
was there.</B>

<BR><B>My Imagination</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pamabbott03@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in this house for five years, in Desoto, TX. This was when
I was about five but the happenings at that house are still new on my mind.
In this House a feeling of uneasyness. I always saw the lights flicker
on and off in the bathroom, even though no one else could. Also, one night
I saw something I will never forget.</B>
<BR><B>Me and my sister shared the back room ( which was actually a garage
but we turned it into a bedroom),&nbsp; In this room we had bunk beds I
slept on the bottom, she slept on the top, but that night we both slept
on the bottom. I always had trouble sleeping, and that night was no different.
I was still awake, while everybody else was asleep, and I happened to glance
up to a pair of red eyes staring right at me about&nbsp; 30 feet from my
face. I told my sister to wake up, but she told me I was dreaming and told
me to go to sleep, so I put the cover over my head and fell asleep.</B>
<BR><B>We used to have a painting of a girl sitting on a chair holding
a bunch of daisies, but she was looking away. One night I had a dream,
it was late at night and I was staring a the painting. I saw the girls
eyes turn and look right at me and she started. The dream seemed so real
I was starting to have doubts on whether it was really a dream or not.</B>
<BR><B>we never researched and today I can't help but feel that maybe everything
that happened was maybe it was my immagiation runnind away with me. Or
maybe not.</B>

<BR><B>My Sighting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bob@curran101.fsnet.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>It happened two tears ago me and a group of friends were all 16/17
yrs old. it was late autumn. we decided to take a walk through the grounds
of the old rectory in Coupar Angus, Scotland.As i recall it was about 10.30pm
darkness had just fallen. To get towards the old house you need to walk
through an apple orchard, we had just entered the orchard when we all suddenly
looked at a big oak tree to the forward right of us it was so weird how
we all focused on that tree without anyone saying "look at that" in front
of our very eyes appeared a young girl on a swing she seemed to be dressed
in i guess to be Victorian dress. I only hung around for a matter of seconds
but that was long enough to see her dress blowing behind her as the swing
came forward. Now being a coward i left quickly but my friends stayed a
final few seconds after me and all four of them saw 3 adults appear in
front of them. Two men pushing the swing and a lady watching and laughing
at the side of the swing. We all met up on the road out side the rectory
and discussed what we had seen. Theres Just no rational explanation for
what we seen that nite other than a ghost. Ever since i can remember i
thought if i saw a ghost it would scare me to death. but when i did it
was a totally different experience. It was kind of calming, quite and peaceful
for those few seconds.</B>

<P><B>The Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lunarshape31@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Greetings!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I notice you accept true ghost reports, so I thought I'd share
mine...</B>
<BR><B>It's not overly dramatic, but it's interesting:</B>
<BR><B>Back in 1998 on a June night, my girlfriend Adrianne and I were
driving around looking for something to do. Since it was a full moon, we
decided to go visit the local cemetery. It'a a Catholic one titled "Our
Mother of Sorrows" (located near the university*). It was about 11:00 at
night and the place was closed. However, we managed to park in front of
the church and find an opening to the left.</B>
<BR><B>Adrianne was nervous about entering, but I simply strolled in ahead
of her. We both heard dogs barking behind a fence and so I made a werewolf
joke which was enough to send her back to the car. However, I continued
walking around the headstones until the barking got to me also, then I
headed back.</B>
<BR><B>After we were back inside my Taurus, we talked about how chicken
we were about the barking. Then, suddenly, we both heard a sturdy rap on
the car. I thought my girlfriend had made the noise with her boot, but
she flatly denied it and she had thought I did it. Once, we were convinced
neither of us made the sound, I looked behind the car to see what it could
have been. There was nothing there and no wind present either.</B>
<BR><B>At this point we decided to leave the cemetery right away. However,
Adrianne felt uneasy the rest of the night. I was fascinated by it.</B>
<BR><B>In later months, I returned to the cemetery and brought a mini-recorder
with to see if I could snag any spiritual dialogue in the silence. I played
back the tape but found no results.</B>
<BR><B>So we didn't see a ghost, just heard something unexplained that
strange night.</B>
<BR><B>*University of Nevada at Reno</B>
<BR><B>Feel free to list this report on you're sight. I also have a sort
of phantom photograph which shows a glowing sphere in the background that
I may send you (taken recently).</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had unexplainable things happen to me since the age 2! This
one is the one I remember the most! Over the summer of the year 2003 I
was 13 years old.&nbsp; my parents was asleep! I was in the living room
and my daddy was on the couch. For some reason I woke up! I sat up and
looked at the clock it was about 1 am, so I layed back down. I opened my
eyes and saw a women in a white dress looking down at me! I rubbed my eyes
to see if I was just seeing stuff and it was still there, and it was! The
weird thing was I felt no harm. So I went back to sleep! I have not seen
her sense!</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Well I have a very CHILLING story to tell.When I used to live

door there was the living room and right by the closet was my room.Well
in the living room was a big stereo system.So one night I was sleeping
with the stereo on...then all of a sudden it just shut off I was so scared
and to scared to run to my brothers room that was down a different hall.The
next morning I told my mom.Then in the afternoon on top of our TV we had
to bobble heads. I said stupidly if there was a ghost knock the heads off.
With in 2 minutes they were on the floor.I ran screaming and crying.Another
very scary sighting was seen by both my brother and me. One night we were
in my room when all of a sudden there was a little girl standing in front
of my door.At first I thought I was imagining it but then my brother started
screaming.To this day I still believe that house was haunted.Just before
we moved my mom helped me pack my room.There was this piece of wood that
could be lifted up.When my mom lifted it there was a picture of this family
that was standing in my room.I asked a neighbor about a previos family
living there he said that something happened ther in the early 1900's.This
story is all very true</B>

<BR><B>Families Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: flyday@bellsouth.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My family has had several incidents that we believe to be paranormal.
About twenty years ago, before I was born, my Mom was driving to work when
she saw a little boy in the middle of the highway. She says that he looked
very solid, and can still describe him. He was wearing a red shirt with
white stripes and blue jeans. He had brown hair and blue eyes. My Mom swore
that she thought she had hit him, but when she slammed on the brakes, no
one was there. Later that day, she was driving home on the same road, and
the same thing happened. She never saw him again, but she never forgot.
A couple years later, she was living in a house that she thought was haunted.
At night you could close all of the doors to the hallway, but the hallway
was still lit up with a strange glow. When she got a new puppy, she put
the puppy into the dining room the first night. At about 2 'o clock, she
heard a crash and ran into the dining room. In the dining room was a fireplace.
On top of the mantle was a box that had a set of wine glasses in it. The
top had been taken off of the box, and all of the wine glasses had been
smashed in the fireplace. My Mom believes that whatever was in the house
just didn't like the puppy.</B>
<BR><B>Later, after I was born, we moved into a different house. No one
in my house smokes, but you can smell cigarette smoke in certain rooms
sometimes. Also, about two years ago, I started to feel scared whenever
I walked thru the small hallway beside the kitchen. If I had to lock the
backdoor at night, I would do it quickly and then run. I told my Mom that
there was something there, but she didn't believe me. Then, one morning,
she was packing lunches when she turned around and saw a figure in the
doorway that leads to the hallway. She yelled for me in a voice that told
me that something was wrong, and when I got in there, she asked me if anyone
had been in the hallway. I told her no, because I was in my room, and my
little sister was still asleep. When she told me what she had seen, all
I could say was "I told you so.".</B>
<BR><B>A couple months later, my cousin Q moved in with her son Shawn.
At their last house, Shawn kept telling his mom that the house was gonna
blow up. Whenever she asked him why he said that, he said that Ben had
told him. Shawn didn't know anyone named Ben, so she put it down to a little
boy's active imagination. A while later, she started smelling gas. When
she called someone to come check it out, she found out that their house
had a gas leak, and that the house could have blown up.</B>
<BR><B>Since Q moved in, some strange things have been happening. For example,
a week ago, Q stayed out late one night. When she got home, she fell asleep
almost immediately. She woke up at about 3 or 4. It was really dark, and
at first she didn't know what had woken her up. Then she heard a voice
tell her to go to the backdoor. She went and found the backdoor wide open.
When she went back to bed, she realized what had just happened. Earlier
that night, before Q's incident, I had been laying in bed, when I felt
something in the room. I couldn't tell wether or not it was harmless, so
asked it to be good to us and to protect us. Suddenly a name popped into
my head. Ben. So I guess that Ben decided to follow Shawn. But thank god
that he did, because we found out later that our neighbors house had been
burgalarized that same night</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Fire!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: telapedersen@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I never really believed in ghosts until my fience died suddenly.
Two nights after his death I was sleeping when my woodstove caught fire.
I was literally picked up and carried into the living room and shaken awake.
When I awoke I wasn't even touching the ground, seeing the fire then, I
quickly put it out and sat in shock. I know it had to have been my fience
watching over me.</B>
<BR><B>Now it is 10 years later and I am living in a new house. Ever since
I have moved in I have noticed things being moved around and have heard
odd sounds throughout the home. I came home one day and every cupboard
in the house was wide open, this is only one of the strange things that
have happened. My son told me that in the early mornings he can see a figure
standing in the kitchen. Not anything too scary has happened until recently
though to make me afraid. I was in a very deep trance like sleep and was
aware that I was very cold, like being wrapped in ice. I awoke to see a
dark figure standing at the edge of my bed but all I could do was close
my eyes and fall back asleep. I realized that I couldn't move because it
fealt like I was being weighed down by something very heavy. I couldn't
yell out because it fealt like my mouth was being covered and it was very
hard to breath. When I was finally able to awake completely I didn't want
to fall back asleep, this is the third time a dark figure has stood at
my bed and I'm not sure of what to do about it, and it is getting a bit
more frightening each time. I haven't told anyone about this because it
would all be a joke to them but I saw your websight and figured, why not
tell them</B><B></B>

<P><B>Stranger Things</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: linaforever@cherry-bubbles.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Ashley, im almost 16 years old (January 27). I live in
Plymouth, Massachusetts. I have lived here in the same house all my life.
(Im going to a thing called ghost theatre for my birthday, what a coincidence).
:) Anyways... Me and my family have believed that there was something in
my house with us for a while now. Little things would happen all the time
but only four or five really strange things have happened here. Let me
just start by saying that ghosts really really do scare me A LOT. I have
always believed in them even since I was very small. To lighten up the
mood in the house me and my parents joke about it and call the ghost "Bob"
or some other silly name like that... I just hope im not upsetting it.
Anyways... on to the stories.</B>
<BR><B>The first really weird thing I ever experienced was when one of
my best friends candace was sleeping over. Her and I had been hearing weird
things through the night and we had decided to go on the computer in the
morning. I was playing on the computer and she was sitting in another chair
of to my right side sortof behind me. I was typing or something when i
felt a hard poke on my right arm. Imagine someone had taken their index
finger and kind of ... dragged it down your arm from just below your shoulder
to just above your elbow.</B>
<BR><B>I turned around and asked her "What?", thinking she had poked me
to get my attention.</B>
<BR><B>"What?", she replied.</B>
<BR><B>Me: "Didnt you just poke me?"</B>
<BR><B>Her: "No... I didnt."</B>
<BR><B>Me: "But I just felt you poke me."</B>
<BR><B>Her: "I didnt touch you...Ive been sitting right here the whole
time."</B>
<BR><B>Me: "Holy CRAP!"</B>
<BR><B>I also have a picture of my boyfriend playing a guitar sitting right
next to where I am now. He was sitting on the bed next to me and in the
picture is a brown figure that looks like its sortof reaching for the guitar
while hes playing it. Its not a shadow.. it is an opaque figure. Also it
has a head and another arm. I have taken pictures with my other friend
Leah in the same exact spot trying to see if we could catch something else
weird and we got a bunch of orbs, not as scarey as the guitar picture but
still strange.</B>
<BR><B>Once when my friend Aurissa slept over we could here the benches
at my dining room table moving around (these are big wooden benches i can
only pick up one end at a time to move them and im a pretty strong girl).
Well... being the scaredy cat that i am, me and her decided to put on my
lava lamp to give us a little light in the room so we didnt have to sleep
in the dark. I got up out of my bed, went across the room to my entertainment
center, turned on the lamp, walked back, and layed down. The lamp turned
off. So I got up again, walked back, turned it on again, and layed down.
It turned off again. I thought there might have been a problem with the
wires or something. So i got up to turn it on again and right before my
hand touched the little switch on the cord we heard this strange noise
that seemed to be comming from right where i was standing. I want to say
it was almost like a scream... but a soft scream and then i heard a weird
voice that said something, I dont really know what it said but I assume
it was something along the lines of "Dont f***ing mess with my lava lamp".
So I layed down and we left the TV on all night :).</B>
<BR><B>My brother(Sean) and his fiance (Lissha) lived with us for a year
or two, in this room, with their daughter Morgan. This was quite a while
ago because Morgan was probably 2-3 years old and shes almost 7 now. Anywho,
My mom came downstairs to get their laundry or something, the door to this
room doesnt close all the way... I dont know why... it just never has.
And usually Sean would throw his towel over the door anyways so it would
be even more open. Well when my mom came down here and looked through the
crack in the door she thought she saw something moving in here. It was
in the afternoon so she thought Lissha might have gotten home from work
and was changing. She also saw long brown hair about the same as Lissha's
so she disreguarded it and went upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>My brother was sitting on the couch watching TV and my mom goes,
"Why didnt you tell me Lissha was home from work... I would have started
dinner."</B>
<BR><B>Him: "Shes not home yet... she wont be home for another hour."</B>
<BR><B>Her: "... Then whos down there NOW?"</B>
<BR><B>Another very strange experience i had was in my bedroom upstairs.
Me and my boyfriend had just gotten home from school together and he came
over on the bus. We got back to my house and went to put our stuff down
in my room when i walked in.. pretty much all of my underwear .. panties...
bras... socks... two swimsuits.. ect. was scattered all over the floor
in front of my dresser. Now if any of you knew me in real life, you would
know i was a neat freak. i hate it when my stuff or space is disorganized.
So i went downstairs to ask my mom what the hell was going on. and when
i showed her the mess she said she had been in my room probably like an
hour before and it all wasnt there. Also when i opened up the dresser it
looked as if someone had just grabbed a handful and just dropped them one
by on all in random places on the floor. In the drawer there was just a
big open space and all of the other underthings were left undisturbed.</B>
<BR><B>Finally another thing that happened before I was born. My mom and
dad were in their room talking in front of their vanity and all of a sudden
a little jewelry box lifted off the vanity and projected itself to the
floor a good few feet away. My parents were in shock because my dad had
given the little box to my mom for christmas a few years before. His mother
had died recently and he had failed to tell my grandmother that he had
gotten the exact same box for her too. Think she might have been a little
pissed?</B>
<BR><B>Well i think that pretty much covers the stranger things that have
happened in my house.. so adios.</B>

<P><B>Hello! During this time in WWII the Battle Of The Bulge</B>
<BR><B>was taking place throughout the Ardennes Forest when the German
Army launched it's last major offensive. 80,000 American casualties are
said to be the final tally of which i am unclear as to how many were fatal.</B>
<BR><B>fierce fighting also took place in the Hurtgen Forest as well</B>
<BR><B>during that time.</B>
<BR><B>I have spoke with various people over the years that have visited
Bastogne and the surrounding area and have camped out and roamed around
the Bois Jacque Woods where many casualties occurred during intense fighting
and artillery shellings from the German forces. A few claimed the wooded
areas have a sense of "forbboding" to them or an "unnatural energy." Most
shrug it off as nonsense or whatever. I personally have yet to visit the
areas, but wonder why more European battlefields are not listed?</B>
<BR><B>Search results always yield the usuall Civil War sites.</B>

<P><B>Ghost and Newspaper Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anaangelsfan22@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a true personal experience that I had back in the summer
of</B>
<BR><B>1997. I was sitting at the dinning room table cutting out some articles
in</B>
<BR><B>the sports pages from the week. I would cut the pictures out and
place</B>
<BR><B>them in a folder. I had several stacks of newspapers set out on
the</B>
<BR><B>table neatly. I got up to go out side to tell my mom something in
the</B>
<BR><B>garage. I came back about 2 minuets later to find one stack of papers
by</B>
<BR><B>the front door, another stack underneath the table, another under
the</B>
<BR><B>chair and another in the middle of the livingroom floor! I ran outside
to</B>
<BR><B>tell my mom. It was only my mom and I home at the time. Although
I had</B>
<BR><B>2 cats, they couldn't have done something like that. The stacks
were</B>
<BR><B>placed neatly too! I was 14 years old at the time. A few years later
I</B>
<BR><B>was told that back in the late 50s or early 60s, there was a chinese</B>
<BR><B>family that lived in the house and they had a 3 year old boy. They
also had</B>
<BR><B>a Koi pond in the backyard and apparently the boy fell in and drowned.</B>
<BR><B>I have asked some neighbors about the story but they say that they
have</B>
<BR><B>never heard it before. I am still trying to check the records and
city</B>
<BR><B>newspapers. For the past year I have noticed things missing, being</B>
<BR><B>moved, nioses in the night and orbs showing up in photos. I guess
now I am</B>
<BR><B>more sensitive to ghost than I was years ago. He bugs my brother
a lot</B>
<BR><B>to by shutting his computer off while my brother is using it and</B>
<BR><B>knockings on the windows at night. Also about a few months ago.
I was just</B>
<BR><B>getting out of the shower when on the steamed mirror, I saw writing
that</B>
<BR><B>wrote "R.P." It was some sort of initial. I guess it was the little
boy</B>
<BR><B>giving me a clue on his name. I just wish I knew more about the

<BR><B>Haunted Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BobnDebsplace@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I know of a haunted home in Gilmanton, WI. The house is no longer
there anymore. The people who owned it were talking about it one night
in a Tavern in Gilmanton. There names were Lenus and Connie. After talking
with them about their frightening experiences. A few friends of mine decided
we would go and see for ourselves. I remember that day. We all do. Something
was there you couldn't see it, but we knew it. You could feel her. I knew
it was a female. I just know. This place really had something going on.
The rumors were the place years ago used to be an old stage coach drop
off. They supposidly had it bulldozed down due to the fact so many of the
towns kids would throw party's there and they were afraid someone would
get hurt. I am not sure if you are interested in this, but I thought I
would tell you about it. This isn't the only place in Gilmanton that was
haunted. There were always more storys.</B>
<BR><B>Mondovi WI also had a haunting in the old Motel. The Mondovi Police
Dept. told me they was involved in the search of the Motel. Rumor has it
that a traveling Salesman came through town and was seeing a woman. Woman
happened to have been married and her husband supposidly killed the man.
He told me this was all documented years ago in the Police logs. Take it
or leave it. I thought I could add to your haunting list. I am sure who
ever publishes books would need witness accounts. These people I have named
above are still alive and maybe would tell you their stories.</B>
<BR><B>Just for your information.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Church</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: snowboardbune69@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My names Becky And from Sioux City, IA. Me and couple friends of
mine heard about a church out in Turin, IA that is said to be haunted.
We all went out there...U come to a gravel road and the church is on the
left had side of the road. The story behind the church is that is was built
in 1818 and a little boy was up in the bell tower because he was getting
punished and that is where they sent him and one day they forgot the little
boy was up there and they went to ring the bell for church service and
the little boy fell out and he died. So now people said that he now haunts
the church. Well me and some friends got up enough guts to go into the
church and take a look around. Well we didnt see anything at first but
then we just kept getting weird feelings that someone was there in the
church so we started taking pictures of everything in the church and we
also took a picture of the way up to the bell tower. We went outside the
church and was looking in the bell tower and there we seen a bluish color.....it
was pitch dark outside so i know it wasnt any kind of street light or something.
We left the church and we got out pictures back and there were SO MANY
messed up pictures. The picture of the way up to the bell tower we seen
a face of a little boy plain as day!!! I will have to scan those pictures
and send them to you guys. Well anyways Thanks for letting me send in my
story! keep up the good work about all the haunted places! Thanks again.</B>

<P><B>Weird Stuff</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: savannahnodskov@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi there well where do I start... well before i was born my great</B>
<BR><B>grandfather had past away when he was using the restroom one evening.
well</B>
<BR><B>some years passed and my father and my mother moved into the house
where my</B>
<BR><B>great grandfather had passed away in. My father and mother were
in bed one</B>
<BR><B>night and my father decided to tell my mother about how his grandfather
had</B>
<BR><B>passed away. when he told her that he was using the restroom they
started</B>
<BR><B>giggling hysterically and they were'nt stopping for breath, then
the window</B>
<BR><B>in the bathroom slammed shut and my mother could never get the window
opened</B>
<BR><B>ever again!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally skip some more years (like two)
and I was born and when i was</B>
<BR><B>little I would always star into the bathroom when I was trying to
fall</B>
<BR><B>asleep don't ask me why because it always scared me to death but
I would</B>
<BR><B>feel something staring at me back, but nothing too big happened
at that</B>
<BR><B>house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when i was 12 or 13 I cant remember which
age I was at we were</B>
<BR><B>living in omaha (well I have been here for my whole life) in the
historical</B>
<BR><B>district of omaha. we lived in an apartment off dodge street. and
by that</B>
<BR><B>time my parents had gotten a divorce. I was asleep one night and
I had woken</B>
<BR><B>up to get a drink of water We didn't have any air-conditioning so
everyone</B>
<BR><B>was sleeping in the living room and i happen to be the only one
awake. well</B>
<BR><B>I look over at my mother she was sleeping on the couch and I was
on the love</B>
<BR><B>seat and I see a little boy in maybe around the turn of the century
clothes</B>
<BR><B>on(1899-1900) reading a book I got really scared and started humming
really</B>
<BR><B>loud. and I rubbed my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing anything
and he was</B>
<BR><B>still there so I started screaming for my mother to wake up and
she did and</B>
<BR><B>he wasn't there. Man I was so freaked out that night that I didn't
move</B>
<BR><B>until my mom got up at 4 am to get ready for work.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
time with the same little boy I had moved when I was</B>
<BR><B>almost 14 into my mothers&nbsp; friends house and I was watching
television one</B>
<BR><B>night and one of my friends had stayed the night over there Nicki
had fallen</B>
<BR><B>asleep on the couch and I was sitting in a chair. well I look over
at nicki</B>
<BR><B>and she hadn't started snoring and I was going to say something
( this girl</B>
<BR><B>had like super snoring powers she is loud) like why are you faking
it but</B>
<BR><B>when I look over that little boy is there again&nbsp; I am freaking
out again and</B>
<BR><B>I yell for nicki to wake up and she does and he is gone.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that same house whenever you would
walk up stairs from the basement</B>
<BR><B>you felt like someone was chasing you up the stairs I have never
seen</B>
<BR><B>anything at that house but you felt something there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
night my friend and I (christina) are just up stairs in my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom watching television and I go down stairs to get up some
pop and</B>
<BR><B>popcorn and she starts hearing scratching on the walls across the
room from</B>
<BR><B>her and she tells me to knock it off but when I don't say anything
she yells</B>
<BR><B>at me to stop because she is trying to watch something I heard her
in the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen and went to the upstairs door and said what and she started</B>
<BR><B>screaming and running for the door and I said what is going on and
she tells</B>
<BR><B>me what happened and I tried to convince her that there is nothing
up there</B>
<BR><B>even though I know that she heard it because I have heard it myself
and came</B>
<BR><B>down to the main floor I had to up there and for like 10 minutes
by myself</B>
<BR><B>to show her that nothing was up there. Boy was I scared up there
but I made</B>
<BR><B>it through with out anything happening to me. All sorts of weird&nbsp;
stuff had</B>
<BR><B>happened to me at that house and I have many stories but&nbsp; they
are for</B>
<BR><B>another time</B><B></B>

<P><B>Occupied House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:Chad.Carter@cingular.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am not one to believe... but this has gone on far too long for
me to just dismiss it.</B>
<BR><B>In November 1998 I bought a house in Douglasville Georgia.&nbsp;
I was getting out of the Army (going into the National Guard).&nbsp; My
then future wife was pregnant with our first and only child.&nbsp; From
the minute we moved in, I noticed strange things happening.&nbsp; I would
loose things and suddenly find them in places that they would have no apparent
reason for being.&nbsp; I once lost a hammer for six months and suddenly
my then wife found it in the dryer, and trust me, we did clothes in that
time.</B>
<BR><B>We would leave the house and come home to find ALL the faucets running.&nbsp;
Lights would be on in the morning, and the front door would be standing
wide open.&nbsp; This might be a little strange, but I passed all this
off as forgetfulness and being a non-believer it seemed perfectly ok.</B>
<BR><B>My wife and myself had a falling out and I was being deployed to
Saudi Arabia for six months.&nbsp; While I was gone I had my parents get
my mail, attend my bills, and basically take care of my house while I am
gone.&nbsp; When I came home I found my house completely destroyed.&nbsp;
I have a lot of movies and kept them on the bookshelf next to my television.&nbsp;
They were all over the floor.&nbsp; All the mail my parents had been bringing
in was all over the kitchen table like someone had read it and newspapers
were strewn around the house.&nbsp; They were dated for the time that I
was gone.&nbsp; During my investigation of the house my parents called
and asked me if I had someone else looking in on it and getting my mail.&nbsp;
Ofcourse, I said no.&nbsp; They said sometime between the first and second
month I was gone things started happening and that my dad had originally
thought I had been robbed.&nbsp; But nothing was missing.&nbsp; The air
conditioner was turned off and they said while I was gone it was a daily
occurance for them to turn it on because someone else had turned it off.</B>
<BR><B>Not being there for six months, I was willing to pass it off as
something weird that just happens.&nbsp; Well, me and my wife were going
to give it a try again.&nbsp; I wanted to surprise her by painting the
living room and asked my family to help.&nbsp; So they all came over (Mother,
Father, Brother-In-Law, and Sister).&nbsp; It was around 4:30am and we
were just finishing up when all of a sudden the computer turned itself
on and was playing all the login sounds I have configured for it.&nbsp;
I might have passed this off as something weird, but the volume on the
computer was turned ALL THE WAY UP.&nbsp; For the software to do this,
it had to have happened AFTER the machine was turned on.&nbsp; We were
all in the living room at the time painting.&nbsp; I came out of my office
looked at my family and said that the computer had just turned itself on.&nbsp;
No sooner had I gotten the words out of my mouth than my entire family
had left me standing there.&nbsp; Kind of comical when I think about it.</B>
<BR><B>Fred" as I have come to name "it".&nbsp; Has been there as long
as I have.&nbsp; I continue to live in the same house and now have a new
girlfriend.&nbsp; I tend to think Fred was mis-named.&nbsp; Simply because
since I have gotten a new girlfriend, it has become more active.&nbsp;
My girlfriend's daughter has a half bookshelf that is in her closet.&nbsp;
Every once in awhile while my Girlfriend is in her room a book will be
thrown at her from the closet.&nbsp; Fred will turn off the water heater,
and not just blow out the pilot light, physically turn the switch to off.&nbsp;
Funny enough, most of the activity happens while no one is home.&nbsp;
I have been gone for a week at a time and come home to find the entire
contents of my refrigerator on the coffee table.&nbsp; Clothes that had
been folded and put away, hanging from ceiling fans.&nbsp; Now I might
have forgotten to fold them but I certainly didn't hang them on the ceiling
fan.&nbsp; In the 5 years I have lived there, I have never once felt threatened
or felt like something was going to harm me.&nbsp; Although my girlfriend
has been hit several times by flying objects, I don't think they are meant
to hurt.&nbsp; I have never seen Fred or any of these events taking place
in real time.&nbsp; I almost feel like I am a real forgetful person had
it not been of the other people involved to remind me that these things
really do happen.&nbsp; It is a rather daily occurance for me to go home
(as I get off at 3pm) to find a faucet running.&nbsp; I have in times tried
to communicate, lightheartedly, by simply asking Fred what he wants or
if he needs help.&nbsp; Most of the time I simply joke with him and ask
him to have the laundry done when I come home.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp; Reassuring my father-in-law</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cfoxrun@wildmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi!&nbsp; I adore your site.&nbsp; I'm not the one in my family who
usually has</B>
<BR><B>ghostly experiences, but I did have one.</B>
<BR><B>A year and a half after I got married and moved to California, my</B>
<BR><B>husband's father died.&nbsp; My husband and I flew back to New York
for</B>
<BR><B>the funeral and when we returned, my husband brought back his</B>
<BR><B>father's gavel (he was a federal court judge.)&nbsp; A few days
after our</B>
<BR><B>return, I was home alone in our two story apartment, doing dishes</B>
<BR><B>downstairs.&nbsp; I started carrying on a "conversation" with my
dead</B>
<BR><B>father-in-law, reassuring him that I would take good care of his
son</B>
<BR><B>and not to worry.&nbsp; I started to get this very clear feeling
that</B>
<BR><B>someone was "listening" to me, that my thoughts were being heard.</B>
<BR><B>Then, I hear a loud thump from upstairs.&nbsp; I dried my hands
and headed</B>
<BR><B>upstairs.&nbsp; I had no fear which is amazing to me since I am
usually a</B>
<BR><B>real scaredy cat.&nbsp; When I went into my husband's upstairs office,
I</B>
<BR><B>found his father's gavel had fallen off the desk and onto the floor.</B>
<BR><B>The gavel had been securely on the desk, set back from the edge
by at</B>
<BR><B>least six inches.&nbsp; I think that my father-in-law wanted me
to know</B>
<BR><B>that he had heard me and that he was okay too</B>

<BR><B>The Russian Ghost</B>
<BR><B>by Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I saw a ghost while I was away on holiday in Russia. I was traveling
by coach in a party of eight to 12 others. We had been traveling most of
the day to get to the town of Kostrumo, in the Golden ring outside of Moscow.
The countryside consists of vast expanses of Siberian Silver Birch and
forests. As we neared the village I noticed out of the window on my left
a graveyard. Standing next to a grave was what I assumed to be a woman
in a black cloak, who was a widow, mourning the loss of her husband. It
was strange, but not unusual to see this.</B>
<BR><B>I noticed that in the graveyard was an orchard of cherry trees.
I did not think too much about this and looked away. I then took a glance
again over my shoulder. As I looked back through the coach window, the
figure had moved and was now standing next to a low wall and the wrought
iron gates, the main entrance. The figure was ominously tall, looking much
more than normal, and took on a threatening presence or shape. I noticed
that there was no face in the hood of the cloaked figure. Far more disturbing,
though, was that it seemed to be watching me and its hands were rested
upon the top wall. I got a glimpse of its hands - it was not human! The
hands and fingers on them were very long - over a meter in length and were
skeletal, long and bony.</B>
<BR><B>As I continued to look back at it, a skull appeared in the hood
and two orange eyes looked back and it grinned at me. I looked away instantly
and did not look back, as I figured that it represented death. I thought
I must be imagining things, so I tried to put the whole thing out of my
mind and get on with the rest of the holiday.</B>
<BR><B>One thing that did strike me as odd was that the graveyard was completely
run down and overgrown with long grass; no one had been there in months
or, in fact, years. So what was this figure doing there? I did not think
too much about the incident and had forgotten about it. Two days later,
I arrived at a new hotel and had sat down to eat dinner in the main restaurant
along with other Japanese guests. As I ate, I looked up into the corner
of the restaurant, and it was decorated with pots and other antiques. But
what drew my attention was a large wood carving by a Russian artist of
a figure from Russian folklore. My Blood chilled to the bone. For there
was a carving of a hooded figure - a man who looked like a monk. His arms
were completely outstretched and its fingers were long and bony, at least
over a metre long. This was exactly what I had seen in the graveyard.</B>

<BR><B>Spooky Going Ons!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rach_price@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This isnt actually an account of what i have experienced but what
my family have experienced in my nan and grandad's house.&nbsp; I don't
know the history of the house or anything, but i know that my dad and aunt
moved in when they were very young, they were still at primary school (
we live in Birmingham, England)</B>
<BR><B>My nan and grandad told me this story;</B>
<BR><B>On night at my nan and grandad's house they had a few family members
over, so althogether there was my nan, grandad, dad, aunt, great uncle
and his son (my dad's cousin).&nbsp; There had been a power cut in the
area and my nan had put up 2 candles in the living room, where all the
family were, 1 at each end of the room.&nbsp; My grandad was trying to
scare the children so he was telling them about ghosts. ( my great nan,
grandad's mom, had died a few years previous) My grandad said that if there
was anything ghostly in the room with them to blow out the candle, sure
enough 1 of the candles went out, which could be put down to a breeze,
but then shortly afterwards the other candle went out @ the other end of
the room, there wasn't a breeze to be felt going through the room.</B>
<BR><B>Another story my nan and grandad told me was;</B>
<BR><B>One day when my nan was in the house by herself, my dad and aunt
were at school and my grandad was at work (he was working mornings until
late afternoons at the time).&nbsp; My nan had just got in from shopping
and decided to start cleaning the house, she went to open the bathroom
door, but it wouldnt open, so she thought my grandad was in there and called
him, he didnt answer, she called again and said that if he was playing
tricks on her he would pay for it! shortly after my grandad walked through
the door, so my told him about the bathroom and he tried to open it himself
and couldnt, they decided that there was a burguler in there so they called
the police from a woman who lived down the road's house, she also came
to try the door and couldn't open it.&nbsp; Finally the police arrived
and just when they went to open the door, it just opened by itslef, the
window was shut and everything.</B>
<BR><B>A event that my dad experienced, he doesn't like to admit it because
he 'doesn't believe'.&nbsp; Before he met and married my mom, he was sitting
alone in my nan and grandads house with his dog, shep.&nbsp; He then felt
as if someone was standing behind him watching him and all the hairs on
the back of his neck stood on end.&nbsp; Shep, his dog, sensed something
and started to act paniky and started to whine and jumped onto my dad,
as if he was scared of something there.</B>
<BR><B>Finally the last event that i know of in my nan and grandad's house
is when my aunt married my uncle and they were in the dining room of the
house, from which you can see out the kitchen window.&nbsp; They both saw
an old woman looking throught the kitchen window and my aunt recognised
her as my grandad's mom who had died years ago.&nbsp; Both my aunt and
my uncle (who had never even seen a picture of my great nan before) identified
the woman in pictures which my grandad showed them of her.</B>
<BR><B>I havent yet experienced anything like this is the house, but i
am only 16, so may yet experince something.</B>

<BR><B>I was reading about the Trempealeau Co. Wisconsin Chaney Beast with
green eyes. I know of a man who saw these eyes more than once in Augusta
while with his friends. He told me it was like they were hoovering over
the river. The boys were camping out and didn't stay long after the eyes
would move but not far. They yelled out and no one answered, but the eyes
remained. I wasn't sure if my friend saw the same green eyes. All I know
is in the mans article about the Chaney Beast he stated there were sitings

<BR><B>Never Truly Alone</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dragonrider13@lycos.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've lived in two haunted houses thus far.&nbsp; The first one was
in a nearly brand new two-story house at the time (built in '92 and we
were moving in it in '94) in Ypsilanti, Michigan.&nbsp; Sometimes the house
made me feel uneasy, but I was usually unaware.&nbsp; However, it was our
dog that was the clue.&nbsp; He would often watch the top of our stairs
intently and flick his ears slowly back and forth, as though listening
to someone as he watched them.&nbsp; My brother and I would follow his
stare and see nothing.&nbsp; My dog would trot along, wagging his tail,
going from room to room, then suddenly stop and spin around to sniff his
tail as though someone pulled it.&nbsp; Nothing out of the ordinary ever
happened to our family, though I often woke up in the middle of the night
to feel like someone was around when no one was.</B>
<BR><B>The second haunted house in Novi, Mi was much older in comparison,
built in the 1940s and having been added on to several times.&nbsp; Even
from the night we moved in, I could tell there was someone with us.&nbsp;
As I brought boxes in from the U-haul, I felt someone following me with
idle curiosity.&nbsp; I would often look in the windows at my reflection,
hoping to see whatever was following me.&nbsp; This spirit wasn't malevolent
in the least since the house always seemed to have a special warmth about
it that made us enjoy coming home from school or work.&nbsp; My mother
even said it was "like the house greeted us" as we returned.</B>
<BR><B>However, I don't doubt this house had several different spirits
residing in it.&nbsp; The previous owner's fiance had died 9 months before
we bought it, and we were less than a block away from a place that was
on the list of the 10 Most Haunted Places in Michigan.&nbsp; The original
mansion a block away was converted to many sorts of offices and restaurants,
trading hands often in a shifting economy.&nbsp; Everyone I spoke to who
worked there talked of strange incidences, particularly around the bar,
but they knew Michigan's past.&nbsp; A strongly religious family had owned
that mansion and most of the surrounding area, including the property our
house sat on.</B>
<BR><B>It was also no surprise that our house was rather "lively".&nbsp;
Friends we invited over had their qualms.&nbsp; One friend didn't want
to go anywhere near the detached garage.&nbsp; I couldn't blame her.&nbsp;
I always felt uneasy and threatened in there as well.&nbsp; Something malevolent
WAS in there, but it was either dormant or unable to do anything since
it was quiet.&nbsp; My brother's friend never even wanted to come over
since just looking at the place gave him the creeps.&nbsp; Another friend
of mine who spent the night complained she couldn't sleep in the living
area because she was too uncomfortable.&nbsp; She couldn't explain her
uneasiness about the room, but she had trouble getting to sleep and staying
asleep.&nbsp; Another friend was in my room once at about 3 AM.&nbsp; She
was showing me new CDs she had bought while I was looking up something
on my computer.&nbsp; She went over to my stereo to change CDs and suddenly
paused, crying, "Hey!&nbsp; I saw something move!"</B>
<BR><B>"It's 3 AM," I replied.&nbsp; "Our eyes are tired."</B>
<BR><B>"No," she insisted.&nbsp; "I saw something move out of the corner
of my eye!"</B>
<BR><B>I outwardly brushed it off calmly, but inwardly felt myself getting
uneasy at her confirmation of what I'd been denying all along.&nbsp; Denial
is a strong thing.</B>
<BR><B>Our house had all the classic problems: erratic electricity (sometimes
an outlet worked, sometimes it didn't); lights flickering; fixtures trembling;
cold spots; rhythmic knocking on certain walls; cold chills that'd sweep
across the room; plain ol' sensations of someone else being in the room;
seeing things move out of the corner of one's eye.&nbsp; We had a logical
explanation for everything.&nbsp; The knocking and scraping in the walls
were trapped animals and birds (sometimes this was the actual case).&nbsp;
The electricity was bad since the house was old and the wiring needed to
be redone.&nbsp; The house needed a second heater and wasn't properly heated,
and that's why there were temperature extremes.&nbsp; If you saw things,
your eyes were tired.&nbsp; Sometimes, though, things happened that we
just couldn't explain at all, like the reactions of our friends or some
of the freakier events that occurred.</B>
<BR><B>I never communicated with the ghosts or actually saw them.&nbsp;
Then again, my mother engrained much wariness in me about the beyond.&nbsp;
She said, "If you talk about it and think about it, it'll come to you.&nbsp;
The less you acknowledge it, the less problem you'll have."</B>
<BR><B>This was only somewhat true.&nbsp; This attitude I kept up was a
drain on my sixth sense, but it also kept the ghosts from directly communicating.&nbsp;
However, one night as I was dozing off to sleep, I got my closest encounter
I cared to have.&nbsp; It was about six months after we'd moved in and
I'd been talking to a Wiccan friend recently about her religion.&nbsp;
She had told me about how Wiccans use a lot of visualizing of energies
in their minds to help them with spells.&nbsp; This night, as I tried to
sleep, I felt the familiar cold chill that often seeped into my room.&nbsp;
Over time, the spirits had gotten bold with us and now entered into my
room in particular since it was the first bedroom off the hallway leading
in from the main rooms.&nbsp; Unlike usual, this chill actually approached
me rather than go by me and began to ice my toes.&nbsp; The chill slowly
crawled up my legs, getting to my knees, while the cold around my feet
never receded.&nbsp; Realizing I was actually being targeted, I visualized
this wh</B>
<BR><B>ite energy in my mind exploding at what was approaching like a firework.&nbsp;
I projected out a warning with it and I felt the chill immediately recede.&nbsp;
In fact, the sensation I got was equivalent to knocking something across
the room.&nbsp; I "felt" it fly back to my wall, stunned.&nbsp; I received
feelings of hurt and shock and an apologetic, guilty air that weren't mine
- the closest I'd gotten to actual communication - and I suddenly felt
semi-guilty for what I now realized to be a rash action.&nbsp; However,
there was a determination and firmness for me to stand my ground and that
it'd better respect my personal space.&nbsp; Though it stayed around, the
presence was cautious and wary and never got within four feet of me up
until I moved.</B>
<BR><B>For the last two and a half years I've lived in this new house,
it's been completely quiet.&nbsp; It's been a vacation on my sharpened
sixth sense at not feeling a new, unseen presence in just about every room.&nbsp;
Needless to say, when my grandfather decided to visit me just hours before
he died last year, I was completely surprised to have my sixth sense go
off.&nbsp; I came right out of a deep sleep at 2 A.M., literally jerking
my head up and gasping, immediately awake.&nbsp; My first conscious thought
was, &lt;i>someone's in my bedroom&lt;/i>.&nbsp; My eyes flew over to the
door, where I felt the presence was hanging around, coming in from, or
leaving.&nbsp; I couldn't quite tell.&nbsp; I was initially scared, thinking
of burglars and the like.&nbsp; Even though I saw nothing, my sixth sense
was sure something was there.&nbsp; I scanned the area around my door for
another moment before assuring myself I wasn't in danger.&nbsp; I tried
to shake off the feeling and go back to sleep.&nbsp; When I woke up the
next morning, my mom had a</B>
<BR><B>lready gotten the call about my grandfather's death, though she
already knew beforehand.&nbsp; He'd paid us all a visit that night and
his presence woke my mom up as well, just with less intensity.&nbsp; She
says even now she can sometimes smell cigar smoke - his favorite thing
to smoke - and feel his presence.</B><B></B>

<P><B>4 HOODED FIGURES IN MY ROOM</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Crystal12780@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One night around 1:am. I had awoke to something standing infront
of my bedroom door. I wear glasses and didn't have them on at the time.
I was looking at the black figure that looked like it had a black hooded
robe on. I sat up in my bed to make sure it wasn't my mom. I yelled, mom,
Is that you!? But there was no answer. all of a sudden the hooded black
figure just jumped towards me. I fell back on my bed in shock. I layed
there while the figure flew over me. It's hood had flew off and it revealed
it's face. It looked like an older figure that had a long nose and a black
swiffle mark on his face. It flew really slow over me. Looking at me. But
it looked scared like something was after it. It had red eyes that was
round. really strange. I was told never look a ghost in the eyes if they
are red. Well, i was in shocked and didn't think about it then. It kepted
looking at me then at the wall behind my bed. Then he was gone. I could
see the figure but yet see through him to my ceiling. It was very weird.
Then something told me to look at the door again . There was another black
hooded figure just standing there. But he didn't stay there long. He flew
past me really fast. Then after he diappered i looked at the door 2 more
times and there were 2 more ghost standing there the same way and flew
off the same way. Except the lost 3 when they flew away they're hoods flew
back and there were no faces. After they were gone for good i layed in
my bed for a long time thinking about what just happened and if it was
real. Oh, they were real alright. I also realized that they seemed to have
been chasing that first ghost. But i have no idea why and why they were
there.</B>

<P><B>A Black Shadowy Figure</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jmhredzak@alltel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;One night I was going to go to bed {the usual 9:30 time} and
I was about to close my eyes when all of a sudden I hear a scream in my
kitchen.Now my bed is on the same floor as my kitchen and that scream sounded
like a women suffering or dieng.I continued to stay in my bed and closed
my eyes saying to myself, "It's not real it's not real" but that scream
happened again and at that one I knew i wasn't dreaming.My sister woke
up and had heard the scream too. We both went to the kitchen with a flash
light and we saw standing in the middle of the kitchen a tall shadowy figure
standing there staring at us in a mean nasty sort of way with his/her red
eyes.Me and my sister stood there staring at the ghost but I couldn't move
I was way too scared. My sister dropped the flashlight and screamed towards
her bedroom. I followed her screaming as well. So we both went to sleep
in the same bed so we can keep ourselfs comfortable. My mom had heard the
yelling we made but she didn't get out of bed thinking we were having a
bad dream or something. I wanted to get out of bed and go across the hall
and tell my mom what me and my sister had saw.But I was too scared to even
move.We heard that scream for the last time before me and my sister fell
asleep.{My sister is 15}.And we just couldn't figure out why and how that
figure was here and how it got here but we were terrified and from that
moment on I havn't saw any ghost or scream since. So the next morning I
went to the kitchen to make myself a bagel with butter on it for breakfeast.
Now i'm not scared at day time where there is light so I was able to go
to the kitchen that day. We had a drawer of where we keep all of our silverwere.And
when i opened that drawer to get a knife, there was only one knife in the
drawer and it had blood all over the blade. And it wasn't going to come
off anytime soon</B><B></B>

<P><B>Childhood Exorcism</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ETippett@fortisproperties.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was a small child I was terrified to be alone in our basement.
I</B>
<BR><B>always felt watched from one particular corner. This irritated me
as I was</B>
<BR><B>dying to create a playroom for myself down there that I could go
to get away</B>
<BR><B>on my own.&nbsp; The basement was huge, 50 feet by 30 feet completely
open and</B>
<BR><B>mostly unfinished, a child's clubhouse dream. But I could not stay
down</B>
<BR><B>there and play alone like I wanted. My brother used to tease me
and run</B>
<BR><B>upstairs ahead saying "I'm going to lock you in!", which in retrospect
was</B>
<BR><B>very silly as there was another exit at the far end that he could
not lock,</B>
<BR><B>but the thought of having even one exit temporarily barred scared
the heck</B>
<BR><B>out of me and I would shriek and scream at him. Once he turned off
the</B>
<BR><B>lights and pretended to hold the door shut. I scared him with how</B>
<BR><B>desperately I clawed at the door and went into hysterics. He never
turned</B>
<BR><B>the lights off on me again. I always felt like something was following
me up</B>
<BR><B>the stairs so I used to run up them as fast as I could and slam
the door and</B>
<BR><B>latch it as if the devil was on my tail. I got tired of being scared
and one</B>
<BR><B>day I grabbed my children's bible and a wooden cross (at the time
I was a</B>
<BR><B>practicing Christian) and I walked around the whole basement saying</B>
<BR><B>something like I had read in the bible, "In the name of Jesus Christ
I</B>
<BR><B>command you to leave this place."&nbsp; After that I was able to
play down there</B>
<BR><B>at least in the daytime.</B>
<BR><B>I find I have had many of the same experiences that others on this
site have</B>
<BR><B>had, my name being called by a female voice when only my father
was home,</B>
<BR><B>hearing footsteps behind me all the time, phantom cats leaping on
my bed,</B>
<BR><B>waking to see "something" standing by my bed etc. I have never experienced</B>
<BR><B>being held down or unable to move though and I hope I never do.</B>

<BR><B>My Desk</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:chuckqclark@prodigy.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is January 23rd, 2004. I am 56 years old and of all mental faculties.</B>
<BR><B>Three evenings ago I was sitting at this computer on my old roll
top desk(top part missing, obtained years ago at an auction) and laughing
heartily at some jokes from friends coming across the mail.</B>
<BR><B>I accidentally knocked something off the pullout to my right elbow
and bent under the desk center opening while seated to retrieve the item(didn't
know what I had knocked off). Well..., I did not find the item, BUT I heard
a female childs voice laughing and talking. SO I sat back up and made another
'dive' under the desk to look for the item again. Hearing the same or similar,
it sounded like a little girl teasing while playing hide and go seek. THEN
I dove under desk once again and heard the same thing! So I got off my
chair and crawled under the desk and did not hear the child again. I was
NOT afraid. It was the voice of just little girl I estimate around 5-6
years of age or possibly up to 8 years of age. I don't know if I'll ever
hear her again. A&nbsp; lifetime of explanations connected to this old
desk will never explain my experience.</B>
<BR><B>My little dog, a miniture pincher had previously been going under
the desk, digging in the rug a bit and sitting in the same corner I heard
the sound emmanating from. Maybe my baby has a friend in the child and
vice versa! He is very special to me an so is the little girl from wherever
she is and the desk! I have no grandchildren and no other sound device
nor implant did I find.</B>
<BR><B>Perhaps the little girl's voice is a friendly haunting who responded
to the hearty laughter at online jokes I read; I don't know.</B>
<BR><B>This desk MAY have belonged to a banker or bank he worked at. I
found some documents dated around 1900-1910 in linings and cracks way inback
of the inside of the desk. I know the bank and may contact them to see
if they have any pictures from that time frame for me to view. I'd like
to match up the desk, if possible, to the man(or woman) who worked behind
it and see if possibly he or she brought a little girl to work that played
under their desk. Time will tell and my efforts, maybe.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know what to make of this experience.</B>
