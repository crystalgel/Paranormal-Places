Ile<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My name is
Christina, and I
have something to add about the boy in beige that is seen riding his
bike in
the animal sanctuary on Grosse Ile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two
of my friends and I saw him about thirteen years ago after we were
coming home
from a late night movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We saw him on
Hickory Island which is on the south end of Grosse Ile; not in the
animal
sanctuary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard of sightings of
him in the animal sanctuary though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was in the middle of a bad snow storm, and as we were driving he was
facing
toward us on his bike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in all
beige, and the coat he was wearing was too thin for this kind of
weather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wasn't riding the bike, but
was rocking
back and forth on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bike looked
really old, and he had this totally blank look on his face.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We thought this was extremely odd because who
would be on a bike in this weather, and wearing such a thin coat?<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We dropped my one friend off, and as we were
going back down the road, we couldn't find him anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No bike tracks, nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was one
of the scariest experiences of my
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard a rumor that he died back
in the 1960's on Hickory Island, but I haven't been able to verify that
yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have only told a couple people
about this because I was afraid people wouldn't believe me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This ghost is very real, and I am glad that I
have been able to share my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">A Haunting I never
Believed
In<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">By:
flynnard@sbcglobal.net<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
spent 11 years of the 18 at my parents in a
now 52 year old house. This house never seemed to bother me at all
until about
the time i turned 10, at least thats the earliest i ever remember
seeing
anything. We had just rearranged the house so my brother and i switched
rooms
with my mother and stepfather. this room had a doorway partially
blocked due to
the fact it sat right next to the furnace and mom didnt want us playing
there,
or so i thought. I remember seeing a tall man standing there almost
like a
shade the only real distinguishable feature was an overly long top hat
he wore.
Everny night i would lie in bed and just stare at him standing next to
the
furnace thinking its only my mind but i felt differently. I never
understood
why he sat there sometimes waking me with how strongly i felt a pull
towards
him a feeling i now understand i get in the presence of the
supernatural. To
continue i never actually believed he was there until we added our new
room on
the house and instead of there he sat in the chair i kept by the door
in my new
room i was about 15 at the time. When i moved the chair he stood in the
spot
where it used to be always never moving except to take his hat off wipe
his
brow and put it back on. I thought i was crazy and it would disappear
until i
get a call from my mom in the middle of my overseas tour. When she
calls me she
said andy im scared and i said why? She says the man in black waved and
then
left. I said what are you talking about ( im twenty at this point in
time) she
tells me the reason we switched room all those years ago was because
she was
seeing him too and she knew i could because i used to see stuff as a
kid that
only she could see too. I said so wait whys that scary. she says after
i left
for basic he started walking back and forth outside my door like he was
waiting
for me to come home and she knew when he would appear cuz the dog would
bark
then sit at the door to the porch ( which also led to my doorway and
had
windows in it). she would turn on the light in the living room and he
would
stop turn and look at her. I asked her so whats that supposed to mean.
She said
i dont know and as soon as she did i left my little guard shack ( i had
a guard
shift to watch our site) and i dropped my phone because not ten feet
away was
this guy not just a shade full bore person looking just staring at me
waving
with a malicious grin black out eyes and he dressed like an undertaker.
I said
what do you want and he stopped waving and looked me dead in the eyes
so i
started to pray. It was the only thing i could do i mean heres this
thing in
the middle of the desert just staring at me finall when i finished his
smile
was gone and he just stood there i said go away and bother someone
else. He got
what appeared to be angry and the slowly turned and walked away i
havent seen
him since and i pray he doesnt come back but im still watchful and i
hope no
one else has an experience like mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">We lived in a
one-hundred
year old house<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in Mankato, MN.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter who is now a very well educated
adult of forty, to this day reports that something/someone she could
not see
picked her up into their arms and held her behind the upstairs master
bedroom
door, and in a tiny area off the upstairs bathroom (which has since
been
walled-off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt neither threatened
or afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever in the basement, I
had the sense that I was definitely not alone and always felt fearful
when down
there.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son, would see a
"shadowman" walk out of his closet in the furthest bedroom upstairs
at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(He is now 45 yrs. old and
still insists this happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, on the
other hand, did feel threatened and afraid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These events occurred back during the 1970s but we continue to
believe
that that house is haunted!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this
time, (5/27/2011) the house is still standing but no one remains living
there
for more than five years (or less).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My son and I were
sitting
watching ghost hunters we spoke of my daughter Diane who committed
suicide 25
years ago . When all of a sudden in the garage a loud noise (really
loud)
occurred. We jumped up to see what happened and a shelf which had been
anchored
to wall for at least 14 years had been literally torn from the wall
(This shelf
was approx 3 feet wide and 4 feet long)..and everything went on the
floor it
bent the washer top and really nothing sitting on it was heavy . but..a
picture
of Diane that had been framed and was apparently stored up there.;was
shattered
on the ground.. we cleaned up the mess in silence ..noting how odd this
was, It
was more than odd believe me. In this house which is not a scary place
I hear
knocking from one corner of my bedroom where the tv sits loud enough to
wake me
up.always at night after I go to bed. and there are sounds like someone
walking
at night usually after 9:00 PM in the upstairs . I have even seen the
dog look
up as if expecting someone to appear, I am not frightened<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it is just what it is and I thought it might
be interesting to you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">About 12 years ago,
I was
living at home after college. Well, in January 1999, the rest of my
family went
on a cruise while I stayed home to work at my new job. The first night,
I came
home the tape recorder in the kitchen had all the buttons pressed down.
The
second night, I came home the alarm clock in my parents bedroom was
going off,
and you can't set that alarm clock for more then 24 hours ahead of
time. The
last night, I was downstairs in my bedroom in the basement with my
pets, when I
heard footsteps in the kitchen directly above me. I thought maybe my
brother
was playing a trick on me with the tape recorder and alarm clock, but
he never
said anything, and I never told him what happened. Anway, I don't
beleive in
hauntings, I just think things happen that people can't explain, just
like
UFOs; but I have no explanation for the things that happened 12 years
ago when
I was home alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bridge -
Jasper, TN<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I grew up in
Jasper. I had
heard the stories surrounding the bridge for most of my youth. I have
had
several strange experiences on and near the bridge, and I have recently
done
some research into the background story.The ghost is a young woman (15)
named
Maureen Cordell. She was murdered in Chattanooga, not far from my
current
residence. She disappeared in July of 1966. Her body was discovered
that
November by two men who were looking for tin cans to build a rat guard
on a
chicken coop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a harrowing event
for the men, as Maureen's head rolled out of the duffel bag when they
hauled it
out of the water of the Sequatchie River.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have had a car that would not start once I honked my horn
three times.
Several friends were with me at the time. The car was brand new (it had
16
miles on it!) and worked fine afterwards. We did not get out of the car
to see
if Maureen would swoop down on us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A car
that I was a passenger in shifted gears by itself and rolled back and
forth on
the bridge. There were three others in the vehicle at the time.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>If you are interested in the details, I would
gladly share more. Thank you for your interesting website.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My story is about
Ed's
whistle:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I work at a university in the
maintenance department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came into work
early to get setup for an campus wide power outage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was to manage the phones and radio in case
of an emergency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I arrived at 4 am to go
over the schedule with our High Voltage group.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had an lanyard with my ID and a whistle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
walked down to the shop to check in with
the crew, but they were not there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
walked back to my office and the whistle fell off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thinking it was not on tight enough, I put it
back on and tested it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
secured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Half an hour later I went back
down to High Voltage and we had our meeting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went back to my office to get ready for the outage.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The whistle fell off again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This time I was getting concern and went into
the conference room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ed's picture is
hanging on the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whistle was a
gift from Ed 2 weeks before an explosion (that later took his life).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was something from his police officer
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Came in and handed this to me and
said, "something from the old fat man".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
always wear it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept the whistle
incident to myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afraid of the guys
would think I was
"barking".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Power was to go off
at 7 am, but went out at 6 am.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not
able to get anyone on the radio or on Nextel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two hours later I found out that one of the vaults had arc twice.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the vault next to the one High
Voltage team was about to go into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
of the technicians bent down to tie his boot and felt heat on his back.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked at his supervisor and asked what
the heck was that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supervisor told him
to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took two steps and was 10
feet away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he turned around, smoke
was pouring from the vault.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
finally talked
to the supervisor and told him what had happened with the whistle.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me, if that ever happen again.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Track him down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
co-workers were non-believers, but after
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let's say they have had a change
of heart. Ed was like a big brother to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A wonderful co-worker who cared a lot about the safety of others.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a very spiritual man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I know that he was trying to give me a sign
to protect my co-workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since this
incident, my guys always make sure I'm at the campus in our "War
Room" (Ed's Room).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I am a ghost
investigator out
of rockingham north carolina, saw you had my dorm at Lees-McRae college
listed
as haunted. I lived on 3rd floor of Tate Dorm. My first year there, i
had
posters in between the heading of my bed, down the sides of my bunk bed
as
well. i started having these bad dreams. in the dream, first night, i
could
hear loud sounds of poster board being ripped. woke up the next morning
to find
that the poster i had taped up that was closest to my feet, had fallen
over my
feet and lower legs. using the same piece of tape, i just pushed the
poster
back up. the next night i again heard in my dream poster board loudly
ripping...woke up the next day, the poster beside the one that fell the
previous night was laying over my stomach, again, i pushed the poster
back up
not adding anything new. the next night i dreamt someone was trying to
sufficate me, next day i woke up with the poster fallen over my face.
the
shower stalls or bathroom when alone felt really heavy like there were
presenses in the room with you, i hated washing my face or having my
face under
water for fear what i might see when i opened my eyes. also walking
down the
hall, you felt as if you were being followed. the telephone stalls use
to be
elevator shafts when it was the hospital. if you were out in the hall
(which i
did alot of, cramming for exams the night before) and it was really
quiet, you
almost could feel someone walking up the hall towards you. also, the
old
elevator shafts you could hear cranking of the wheels turning just like
the
sound you might would hear if the elevators were still in tact...or the
sound
was from that area...at the time, i never wanted to investigate where
it was
coming from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My 15yr old son saw
the image
of a person running slowly past our back window last week, he has seen
things
at other times also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son stopped what
he was doing &amp; told me what he had seen..a person in a white hooded
jumper
wearing dark, maybe black long pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
then went on to tell me that he'd seen the same "person" twice at our
previous address (we've been here for almost 3yrs) once standing at the
front
window looking in &amp; also standing next to an old Fig tree facing
our
townhouse..we lived in a complex of townhouses &amp; the old treehas
been there
for many, many years &amp; still stands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The previous tenant in our townhouse worked for the morgue &amp;
I'm of
the opinion that maybehe brought "someone" home? We all saw shadows
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this house we are currently
in, we've had the laundry door open by itself, the abovementioned
appear again
&amp; my 4yr old just today, turned around from the kitchen bench while
I was
making cupcakes &amp; "blew raspberries" at something a few metres
away! <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I asked him why he did that &amp;
he replied,"I heard a noise over there, just like the noise I heard in
the
wall while you were asleep".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
13yr old has heard footsteps on paper he had left on the floor in his
room, so
came &amp; got us to check his room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
been watching t.v. on the couch and saw someone walk past the front
windows
towards our door, so I got up to answer the door and there was no-one
there?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have had experiences in other
houses
before, but I find this "hooded person" intriguing...three times this
person has appeared at two different places. Do they attach themselves
to us?
Thanks for reading, we are from Brisbane, Australia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I had to write this
story
down and share it. My family has been experiencing the paranormal for
years and
like them, I have had several encounters, most of them are small or can
be
rationalized, this one however, can&#8217;t. My husband, dog and I live in a
1500 sq.
foot rancher on Vancouver Island. One night at around 10PM I was lying
in bed
with the lights off, trying to drift off to sleep (My husband was in
the office
doing book keeping with his music playing and the door closed) and our
dog was
on her bed, across the room and to the left of me. After about
15-20mins of
being in bed, I opened my eyes because there was movement at the end of
the bed
(like what you would see if someone walked directly in front of you in
the
pitch black) the figure was as tall as my husband and of a similar
build, so I
assumed it was him. This figure walked across the front of our bed and
over to
where the dog was and just stood there over the dog, looking down at
her. I was
curious as to why he was just standing there in the dark so I asked,
&#8220;What are
you doing?&#8221;, as I said this, our dog began to growl (our dog never
growls) the
form then turned and looked at me. I turned over to reach the light
switch
beside me and as I turned back there was nothing there. I looked down
at the dog
and she was lying down with her ears back and the fur between her
shoulder
blades was standing up. I called the dog onto the bed where she stayed
for the
rest of the night. I told my husband about it in the morning, he still
thinks
it was a nightmare. I know it wasn&#8217;t. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">This happened about
4 years
ago. I didn&#8217;t remember falling asleep in the first place so I guess I
just
drifted off. I was woken up by growling. I didn&#8217;t open my eyes because
I
figured I had fallen asleep in my living room again and that my dog,
Jaxx, was
just growling at something. I mumbled at him to shut up and tried
falling back
to sleep, but the growling just continued. Eventually it was right in
my face
and the breath smelled awful. I peeked my eyes a peeked and swung my
hand
telling him to shut up again. But it just continued. By this time I was
entirely frustrated. I opened my eyes quickly to yell at him, but when
I did, I
was in my bedroom. My dog wasn&#8217;t anywhere and I couldn&#8217;t move. Then I
finally
realized my bed was shaking. I couldn&#8217;t move or yell. I laid there for
a few
more seconds, then blacked out. When I came back around, everything was
back to

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">I was a cadet at
Wentworth
Military academy in the 117th and 118th Corps of Cadets (1996-98).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In those years I was there I lived in most of
the mentioned barracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived in Marine
Hall (my first barracks), Hickman Hall, East Barracks, and the barracks
above
the mess hall (Forget the name).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
in Foxtrot Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I encountered a
couple of scary times I would like to share.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Scholastic Building &#8211; During the weekends the scholastic
building doors
were chained and locked as it was closed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My buddy and I had left a window on the first floor unlocked and
snuck
in one afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were snooping
around classrooms and what not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
on the 2nd floor and there is a stairwell on each end.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While on the 2nd floor we heard voices and
footsteps on the first floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We got
scared because we thought it was a TAC officer (Works for school &#8211; Kind
of like
a teacher figure) so we made it for the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we crept down the stairs we heard a LOUD banging, almost as
if
someone had taken a baseball bat and was smashing the radiator pipes
repeatedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It scared us so bad we
bolted down the stairs into the classroom where we came in and jumped
out the
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were scared senseless and no
one else was in the building as we checked the doors and they were
still
chained up. Hickman Hall &#8211; Hickman hall was a scary place to live.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>My name is probably still written in the
tower as my buddy and I went up into it and wrote our names on the
brick with
whiteout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still remember the shower
room was in the basement of the building and painted all red (creepy).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The times I showered down there I was always
scared senseless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rumor had it a kid had
hung himself from the pipes in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
platoon sgt. Had asked me one day if I was up the night before late and
in the
hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
began to tell me that he woke up that
night and went to use the latrine when he saw someone walking down the
hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He yelled for them to get back in
their room and said the person walked between my room door and the next
room
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not through the door but through
the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He checked both rooms and said
everyone was asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was freaked out
about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those are the two most
memorable stories I have but my best friend at the time and I also had
a couple
of slammed door incidents at Hickman hall basement when it was
abandoned and we
snuck in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scared the hell out of us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Hi, I just read
Dave Js
story, and a few others. Creepy. Its inspired me to send in my story.
This
occurred in Denver's Capitol Hill neighborhood, 2000-2002.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a lengthy search one summer, I finally
found the historic little apartment I wanted. Old apartment building,
built in
1910. Probably about 20 units, all really small, but really cute. The
building
was being renovated, so I had to wait for a month or so while the
workers
finished. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So they eventually
finished
my unit and I moved in. They were still working on other units in the
building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My first night
there, empty
apartment except for my bed, and I sat up thinking about where to put
my
furniture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something about the bedroom,
though. I felt like I was being watched when I was in there. We've all
felt
that feeling before, but this was intense. I felt that THE STARE WAS
COMING
FROM THE CEILING FAN. I literally hopped right up to the fan to check
it out,
up close. Of course there was nothing there except the inner working of
the
fan. I thought it was weird, but I wasn't concerned or anything. I
didn't keep
me from sleeping in the room. Probably about a month later I was awoken
around
2 or 3 am to something SHAKING MY BED. My first reaction was it was a
cat on my
bed. As I slowly came to, I remembered that I don't have a cat. Then it
sank
in. I was frozen with fear. I couldn't muster the strength to get out
of bed.
Yep, thats me, a grown man in his twenties too scared to move. I fell
asleep
eventually again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strangely, when I woke
up I had forgotten all about it. I kept sleeping in the bedroom without
worry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then probably about a week later IT
HAPPENED
AGAIN. I was in a deep sleep. I was awaken to my bed shaking. As I
opened my
eyes, the shaking stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thats when
the previous instance came back to me, so I realized now that this
happened
twice. I went out to the couch in the living room and slept the rest of
the
night. I only slept in the bedroom one more time, when my father came
out to
visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few weeks later, one night
around 3am, I HEARD A WOMANS BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM COMING FROM WHAT
SEEMED LIKE
THE WALLS OF MY APARTMENT. A FEW MONTHS LATER, one Sunday morning
around 7am I
heard what sounded like someone, really angry, putting away dishes in
the
unoccupied apartment next to mine. I could not believe how damn loud it
was.
Then I thought about what I was hearing. Kitchen cabinets sliding out
and then
slamming shut, quickly. No dish sounds like clanging. All really fast,
and over
and over again. This went on for 10 minutes. That spooked me. I pounded
on the
wall and the sounds stopped. Eerily quite after that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That's it really. Not really a proper
conclusion to the story but I imagine thats just how these things work.
This
playful ghost obviously hasn't concluded their own story, and it felt
it needed
to communicate with me. I stayed in the apartment for 2 years total. I
still
live in Denver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've toyed with the idea
of knocking on the door of my old apartment and asking the current
resident if
they've experienced anything out of the ordinary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
also wondered if there was some kind of
tragedy in the apartment building, and more specifically in the bedroom
of that
apartment. It's interesting. I have an awesome story to tell people.
People are
going to believe what they want to believe, and when I tell that story
some
people are fascinated, but most others are skeptical. Thats okay. I
don't need
them to believe me. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I kind of feel
sorry for whatever this thing is. Why is it still sticking around? It
was
frightening at the time, but I never felt threatened. Take care,
believers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
