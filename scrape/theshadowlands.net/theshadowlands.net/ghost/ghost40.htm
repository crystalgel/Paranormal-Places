<H3><A NAME=some>Some Czech Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by Derek.puffer@netchannel.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was vacationing in Prague last year and gathered some interesting
ghost stories about the city. The first tale is of a Templer Knight who rides

through the streets of the Jewish Quarter with his head tucked under his

shoulder. He was decapitated by a butcher during a progam in order to drive
out the Jews from the city.                                Another tale tells
of a man with lots of hair who was ridiculed by his neighbors. After awile,
he started to strangle people to death, including small childrean. To this
day, people have reported hairy hands trying to choke them and repulsive
odors coming from noware.                  A more friendly ghost is of a

beautiful lady in white who haunts the garden near Prague Castle. No one
knows who she was, but some people think she's the spirit of a woman who
hanged herself after her child died from the plague.                    
     Now for more gruesome stuff, the ghost of a turk who carries the head
of a young woman haunts a s!</B>
<P><B>treet near Tyr's Church. He killed her in a fit of jelousy and took
her head so he could take it back to Turkey with him. But soon, he heard
vocies telling him to bury her head with her body, so he did. However, the

gruesome sight of the murderous turk still haunts the street of this brutal

murder.                  Last is a more recent haunting in the city. During
the 1970's, the Communists ordered the destruction of a graveyard for an

apartment building. Soon, residents reported tales of skeletons and specters

walking through their rooms and evan a vampire who lurks in the building.
The Communists dismissed this as nonsence and some people got arrested for
their beliefs. After the collapse of Communism in Czechloslovakia in 1989,
a group of gypsies performed a seance in the building. They say it's an evil

place and from thatday on, nobody lives in the building. Some people stil
think the ghost still haunt the site and will only rest when the building
is demolished.</B>

<H3><A NAME=story>Ghost Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;KHANTY@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I first married my husband, I thought I was marrying into a strange

family when they told me about the ghost of their beloved dead. My sister-in-law,

A, confirmed this story after moving in with them years later. She has never

heard of this story, and the family don't talk about it much. The only reason

they told me is my husband spilled the beans.It happened to him when he was
4 yrs.old. He was at his great-grandmother's house, I will call her V. He
asked V. who was that strange man in the living room, V. assured my husband
that it was nothing to worry about, he just checks on her ever so offend.My

husband decribed the man to a tee. My mother-in-law, G., has seen the ghost
too while she was there helping out with the ironing, he apperaed to her,
she became frightened and threw the iron at it. The ghost as it turned out,
was V.'s deseased husband, who died before my husband was born. After my

husband's father died of cancer in his home , the room he spent his final
days in was only used for storage. This is where my sister-in-law, A, comes
in. She tells me that she sees my father-in-law walking down the hall late
at night and he isn't alone. She wanted to know who the white-haired lady
was. That was V. who died when my husband was 9 yrs. old. She was full-blooded

Cherokee so her hair turned white in stead of gray. And she was the only
one in the family with Indian blood in her veins.The ghosts don't harm anyone

they just show up every once -in-a-while to see if everyone is o.k. Have
I ever seen these ghost ? No I haven't. I don't spend the night there either.
I have never seen a ghost in my life and I don't plan to either!</B>

</H3><P><B>by bobbyhill@earthlink.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>My story begins back home in El Paso, Texas, when I went to vist a

house</B>
<P><B>where several of my friends rented a house and lived as roommates.
 I was</B>
<P><B>told the history of the house, but I didn't really want to believe

the</B>
<P><B>stories.  The stories were typical of ghost stories where a figure
of elder</B>
<P><B>woman was seen walking around the corner, a telephone cord swinging
on it'</B>
<P><B>s own, animated dolls, a face present in a lit fireplace, and so on.
</B>
<P><B>The basis for this story is that an elderly woman was killed by an

intruder</B>
<P><B>and was discovered a while after.  It was said that the chalk outline

of</B>
<P><B>the body was left to be covered by carpet along with other markings

typical</B>
<P><B>of a murder scene.  I was a little uneasy being left alone in that

room,</B>
<P><B>because I was afraid of seeing or feeling something.</B>
<P><B>One day I decided to take up an offer to spend the night with my

friends</B>
<P><B>because the majority of us worked at a movie theater and decided to

carpool</B>
<P><B>to work the next morning.  The night seemed all right as long as the

lights</B>
<P><B>stayed on and everybody hung around and watched the television.  That

night</B>
<P><B>would bring the things I didn't want to know.</B>
<P><B>We got settled to get ready for bed and we decided to sleep in the

room</B>
<P><B>where "she" was murdered.  The first thing we heard was a slow rapping

on</B>
<P><B>the side door and the neighbors dog was crying mournfully.  The first

we</B>
<P><B>did was look at each other, pick up our sleeping bags, and sleep in

the</B>
<P><B>next room which was the entry room.  Four of us slept in front of the</B>
<P><B>couch, one slept on one couch, and one on the other.  </B>
<P><B>We heard the coffee table creaking as if someone was sitting on it
while a</B>
<P><B>knocking sound came from the wall.  I made the mistake of speaking

first</B>
<P><B>telling this being I wanted sleep because I had to open the next day

and</B>
<P><B>didn't want to be disturbed.  </B>
<P><B>While I was facing the room we had just run from, I heard a Christmas</B>
<P><B>ornament being yanked off the tree while the TV guide flew off the

table</B>
<P><B>and landed on one the guys. He put the guide back on the table, only
to be</B>
<P><B>hit by a coaster.  Then the girl laying in front of me yelled at me

because</B>
<P><B>she thought I had kicked the back of her knee.  My knee was bent

behind</B>
<P><B>hers, but I would know if I had kicked her.  Meanwhile, the creaking

and</B>
<P><B>knocking continued.</B>
<P><B>I was afraid to face the dining room so I stayed facing the abondoned

room</B>
<P><B>and I continued to see things fly off the coffee table.  After about

an</B>
<P><B>hour of disruptions and my threatening we decided to see if we could</B>
<P><B>recreate the sounds with what we thought was the cause.  </B>
<P><B>We found a extra Christmas tree pole behind one sofa, sat it straight

up</B>
<P><B>and let it drop against the wall.  When the sound resembled what we

had</B>
<P><B>been hearing, we screamed and ran into the girl's room.</B>
<P><B>Everyone got tucked into bed and I turned the lights off and as soon
as I</B>
<P><B>got into bed we heard a loud thud.  I got out of bed and turned the

lights</B>
<P><B>back on only to discover an address book onthe floor.  It had been

thrown</B>
<P><B>from a dresser and against the door.  I then turned off the light and

laid</B>
<P><B>down when I was hit on the head.  Now I thought someone had thrown
it, but</B>
<P><B>it came from direction of the ceiling and no one could have gotten
up quick</B>
<P><B>enough to hit me as soon as I turned off the lights.  Cursing, I got
up and</B>
<P><B>turned the lights to find a Disney figure from a Happy Meal in our
bed.  I</B>
<P><B>turned off the light, threw the figure straight ahead, and was about

to</B>
<P><B>cover my head when I hit in the mouth very hard with something.  This

time</B>
<P><B>I was scared and angry and everyone knew I had been hurt because I

had</B>
<P><B>screamed very loud.  I once again turned on the light and found the

figure</B>
<P><B>in the bed and the head had been turned around.  I knew I had a welt
on my</B>
<P><B>lip because it strung and it felt like it sticking out pretty far.
 I threw</B>
<P><B>the doll in the closet and packed up my bag, because I had enough of
this. </B>
<P><B>Everyone else decided to follow me into the guy's room and once again

we</B>
<P><B>got ready for bed.  </B>
<P><B>I was hit on the head with a quarter and had my sleeping yanked over

my</B>
<P><B>head, but after that evening nothing bothered us again.  I ended with
a few</B>
<P><B>hours sleep and was very grumpy.  </B>
<P><B>I never saw a being, but I knew that someone had dome those things
to me. </B>
<P><B>There was no way for my friends to hit me because of the timing and

the</B>
<P><B>direction the object came from.  I had learned my lesson never to stay

in</B>
<P><B>house that is haunted because I may not enjoy my stay there.</B>

<H3><A NAME=man>The Man</A>
</H3><P><B>by Debm73@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well to begin I have finally felt the relief of knowing by coming to
this site that what has happened to me and my family isnt as rare or unheard
of as I had once thought..</B>
<P><B>We were all very scared and spoke to no one about any of this for fear
of people finding us absolutely insane or a joke.About ten years ago my family

was going through some financial difficulties and realized we had to find
a more affordable home to live in. So my parents and my younger brother and

sister and I went around and looked at many different homes.We were all starting

to feel a bit discouraged because the homes we were seeing in our price range

were all very small and cramped.We had one more home to see that day and
the owner had told us over the phone to feel free to stop by and look at
the home and let him know of our decision.</B>
<P><B>When we arrived we at first thought that it had been the wrong house

because of its enormous size and the price the owner wanted for rent.We all
went in very excited at the room and the  4 levels of this home and decided
that this was the ONE..So the next few weeks were spent on the normal moving
in and all the excitement that comes with a new beginning.I picked for my
room the 4th level of the house which seemed to an attic converted into one
large bedroom..At my age at the time which was 14 I figured I could have
all the privacy I wanted away from my parents because it was a level all
to itself.My first memory of this room was opening the door that led up to
the stairway and feeling a very cold air hit me as soon as it was opened.I
figure the house was vacant for awhile and there would be no reason for it
to feel any different.I went on to unpack the boxes and set up my room in
my own little world until about 900 that evening  every single light in the
house had went out.My father had reset the breaker twice that night and spoke
to the landlord in the morning about it..He said he would have an electrician

come out in the morning.But as luck would have it the electrician found no

problems and we chalked it up to just one of those things.The second night
in that home we were all awakened about 3 o'clock in the morning by the blaring

sound of the first floor stereo on full blast. I remember running down the
steps and seeing my father with a furious look on his face thinking one of
us were up at that hour. But we all got downstairs and we realized we had
all been sound asleep until this minute.We then shut it off and we all went
back to bed and about 1 hour later the exact same thing happened which my
father than ripped the plug out of the wall and stamped back into bed.In
the morning we were all talking about the broken sleep and how strange that
had been.Well that day wore on setting up some more things and all seemed
fine until late afternoon my brother hightailed it down the stairs screaming
and we were all yelling in unison "WHATS WRONG?" I had never seen my brother
look so pale and so shaken in all my life and I started to get really worried.He

finally told us he was fiddleing around in his room putting up some posters
when he realized some man was standing in his doorway.My brother said "who
are you?" and man came towards him at a very fast pace and slapped him so
hard across the face that he still had a red mark on the right side of his

face.My father than ran up the stairs seaching for this intruder and found

nothing.My mother called the police and they didnt seem to believe one word
of what we were saying but  they offered to make a report of it..OH great
some comfort in that!! We were all very shaken up and my brother decided
to take his sleeping bag and bunk in my room that night.I was grateful for
the company.In the middle of the night we were awoken by mother screaming
for my father and we all ran down to her.My mother had went down for a glass
of water and found a man staring at her through the kitchen window over the

sink.At this point my father flung open the back door screaming various obcenites

looking for this guy and found nothing.I dont think any of us got any sleep
that night. My father spoke to the police and the landlord again and they
could offer no relief or explanation.And now as I come to this next account
I feel absolute terror just remembering the details.Later that day I had
went to take a shower.I stepped into the bath and started the normal routine
of washing.I had just started lathering up my hair and tilting my head back
with my eyes closed under the shower head when all of the sudden I felt this

gripping feeling around my neck.I coundnt move, I couldnt scream and the
grip was getting tighter and tighter. The hot water came on full blast and
burned the entire back of my body.I dont know how long in actual time I was

standing there being chocked and burned but I felt like I was going to die.In
one instant it stopped and I let out the most gut wrenching scream I had
ever heard come from my own mouth.It seemed everyone was in the bathroom
in seconds pulling me from a crounched position in the shower begging me
for an explanation.My mother than saw the hand prints on my neck in deep
red marks. Over and over she asked what happened.I couldnt utter a word.My
mom started crying and yelling at the top of her lungs WHAT THE HELL IS GOING
ON IN THIS HOUSE??? I remember her holding me and rocking me as we both sat
there and cried for what felt like hours.</B>
<P><B>Well I cant remember how long in between it took for the next occurance
but in the meantime I felt like I was going to have a nervous breakdown.I
would not take a shower without my sister sitting on the toilet until I was

done.I would never sleep the same way again.Every sound made me jump and
my nerves were absolutely frazzeled.I didnt want to be there,none of us did.
We had no expalnation and who could we turn to? Six more months went by in
that house with various things happening which would take a novel to explain
in detail.Lights turning off and on,doors slamming open and closed sounds
of someone walking up and down the stairs when we were in bed.My family was

coming apart.My mom and dad started to fight constantly.My mom begging him
to leave and him screaming in frustration we had no money to move.We made
sure no one was alone in that house ever.We were all scared to do normal
things alone in a house which most people took for granted such as take a
shower ,get a glass of water anything which entailed no ones usual assisstance.

My dad finally figured out a way we could save some money and leave.He just
plain out stopped paying for the rent and we had enough to leave before we
were taken to court.</B>
<P><B>Well we found another home and life seemed to get back to normal.I
cant tell you how awful life was for us until we left that house.We were
all deeply changed forever and it will never leave the back of our minds
that it could happen again.I dont know what happened to that house ,if another

family moved in and so on and frankly I dont care.None of us ever will drive
down that street again or utter a word about it until me today writing this.Im

not sure how my family would feel knowing I shared this story but being that
no names were mentioned I guess this could never come back to us.That is
my story.That was our living hell .</B>

<H3><A NAME=visions>A Lifetime of Visions</A>
</H3><P><B>by thomasent@www.valuu.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Ever since I can remember I've been able to see and feel things that</B>
<P><B>nobody else could.  My mother says I have an old soul because when
I was</B>
<P><B>barely old enough to talk I would tell her stories about things that

I</B>
<P><B>had done...things that I couldn't have even known about.  When I was</B>
<P><B>very young I was playing in one of those little plastic Wal-Mart</B>
<P><B>swimming pools at my cousin's house in Texas.  I heard someone behind

so</B>
<P><B>I looked up and saw an angel plain as day...the angel stood there and</B>
<P><B>smiled at me, she said something to me, but I have never been able
to</B>
<P><B>remember what it was.  The whole family was out in the yard at the

time</B>
<P><B>but nobody saw anything.  I've always known what people and places

where</B>
<P><B>"bad", meaning that they had negative energy surrounding them. I'm
so</B>
<P><B>sensitive that everytime we drive by this one house I start to cry</B>
<P><B>uncontrollably.  Needless to say that we try very hard not to go that</B>
<P><B>way.  When I was 16 I went with my friends to a place in the ozark</B>
<P><B>foothills in Arkansas called Dover Lights.  It got its name because</B>
<P><B>according to legend, Spanish Conquistadors (sp?) buried their gold
in</B>
<P><B>the valley and their ghosts came back to look for it.  The lights are</B>
<P><B>the lanterns that they carry.  I don't know how much of this is true,</B>
<P><B>but I know that spanish ghosts aren't the only thing up there.  Let

me</B>
<P><B>give you a little layout info so you can understand the rest of the</B>
<P><B>story better.  To get to the Dover Lights you have to drive up a

steep</B>
<P><B>curvy dirt road for several miles.  It's not really a mountain, but

it's</B>
<P><B>close enought for the locals.  Dover Light's itself is really just
a</B>
<P><B>parking spot on top of this hill that overlooks the valley of the</B>
<P><B>legend.  The drop from the spot is several hundred feet almost

straight</B>
<P><B>down. There is a railing at the edge of the "cliff" so people don't

make</B>
<P><B>a fatal mistake and keep driving.  We went up there during the day
at</B>
<P><B>first to get a glimpse of the beautiful view.  There was another car</B>
<P><B>there, but it was empty.  Around midnight we went back up there to

see</B>
<P><B>the "lights", the car was gone and the railing was smashed through.
</B>
<P><B>Several of the other people I was with had been up there before and

had</B>
<P><B>seen the lights, but this was my first time and I found it

interesting.</B>
<P><B>I immediatly didn't like the place at all...it was evil if ever there</B>
<P><B>was a such thing.  I mean the PLACE was evil, like it was a doorway

or</B>
<P><B>something.  The first thing I noticed was the dark shapes in the</B>
<P><B>treeline.  Then I started feeling something moving closer.  I told
my</B>
<P><B>friends, two of whom were as or more sensitive than me, that we had

to</B>
<P><B>get the hell out of here now or we might not ever make it.  They all</B>
<P><B>agreed and we jumped in the car and took off as fast as possible down</B>
<P><B>the dirt road.  The chase was on.  There are different levels of

demons,</B>
<P><B>strengths and sizes I mean.  At first the things coming out of the</B>
<P><B>treeline after the car were small, land bound creatures that really</B>
<P><B>weren't very fast.  Then bigger and faster.  Finally the most

terrifying</B>
<P><B>thing I could possibly imagine was on our tail.  It was huge and it

was</B>
<P><B>flying.  I could hear it behind us.  I could also hear it in my head.

</B>
<P><B>Not words so much as images and violent emotion. One of my friends
in</B>
<P><B>the front seat told us not to look back.  The guy sitting next to me</B>
<P><B>thought we were all crazy and said we were just trying to scare him,

so</B>
<P><B>he immediatly looked behind us and lapsed into some sort of trance.

 He</B>
<P><B>passed out and we could not wake him up for anything.  I was slapping</B>
<P><B>him, beating him, pinching him, yelling at him and nothing happened.
</B>
<P><B>Then the mental beating I was going through got worse.  I started

being</B>
<P><B>able to hear actual words.  It wasn't english, but I understood anyway.

</B>
<P><B>It hated us.  It wanted to get to us because we had invaded it's home</B>
<P><B>and because we knew it was there.  I heard it say things that

terrified</B>
<P><B>me beyond belief, but I was trying very hard not to show my fear. 
We</B>
<P><B>finally got off the mountain but it kept chasing us.  Finally, when

we</B>
<P><B>got into the city limits it stopped.  We stopped at a gas station in

the</B>
<P><B>middle of town because all of us had to calm down.  The guy who had

been</B>
<P><B>sitting next to me came to and said he didn't remember anything after

he</B>
<P><B>looked back, though the look on his face said otherwise.  My other

two</B>
<P><B>friends and I sat on the car and talked about what we had just seen.

 I</B>
<P><B>was trying to forget the things that I had "heard" but when my

friends</B>
<P><B>got to that part they looked at me.  I asked them what they had heard.

</B>
<P><B>It was the same thing.  The creature, I know it's name but choose not

to</B>
<P><B>mention it here, said that it would have my first born child because

it</B>
<P><B>could not have me.  I don't know what it was that made it unable to

get</B>
<P><B>to me.  All I know is that about two weeks later I found out I was

about</B>
<P><B>a month and a half pregnant.   A month later I miscarried.  I have

never</B>
<P><B>been able to make sense of the whole thing.  But I moved to Wisconsin</B>
<P><B>almost immediatly after my miscarriage hoping to put enough distance</B>
<P><B>between me and it.  Everytime I go home I feel it.  It knows when I'm</B>
<P><B>close, but I've never been back to the lights.  I try to stay as far</B>
<P><B>away from that mountain as possible.  If you have any comments or</B>
<P><B>suggestions I would love to hear them.  I have another story about

the</B>
<P><B>area around Dover, Arkansas if you would like it, but it's not a</B>
<P><B>personal experience, it's just folklore as far as I know.</B>

<H3><A NAME=texas>Texas Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by jfp411@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have two stories to tell you about.  Both are in Texas.  Only one
have I</B>
<P><B>seen the other I heard about as a child and saw later on a paranormal

tv</B>
<P><B>show.  The first is located in Galveston TX. at the Texas Medical Center.

</B>
<P><B>There is a small 3 or 4 story building which I believe to be a trauma</B>
<P><B>center.  Located on the side of this building just above a side entrance

is</B>
<P><B>a "picture" of a face that is about 7 to 8 feet tall.  The story I

heard</B>
<P><B>sayes that the former owner willed the property to his grandaugther
on the</B>
<P><B>condition that it stay in the family.  As soon as she got the deed
upon his</B>
<P><B>death she sold the property to the TMC.  And the trauma building now

stands</B>
<P><B>approximatly where his house used to be.  I have even heard that some

of</B>
<P><B>the nurses inside have seen an older gentalman wondering the halls
late at</B>
<P><B>night.</B>
<P><B>     The other place is a set of railroad tracks in San Antonio where

a</B>
<P><B>school bus full of children was hit by a train.  That is documented
in the</B>
<P><B>local paper as fact.  The funny thing is that if you were to sprinkel

some</B>
<P><B>flour on the back of your car and stop on the tracks placing your car

in</B>
<P><B>netrual it will be "pushed" of the tracks.  And upon reaching "safety"

get</B>
<P><B>out and look at the back of the car and there are several little hand</B>
<P><B>prints in the flour.  Eventhough I only saw that part on tv it still

gave</B>
<P><B>me chills because of hearing about it from a family member so many

years</B>
<P><B>earlier.</B>
<P><B>     The "face" in Galveston is visible 24hrs a day so you can see
it for</B>
<P><B>verification purposes anytime you want.  Providing they will let you
in. It</B>
<P><B>is not visable from the street but there is a large hole in the fence

where</B>
<P><B>I hear some people like to sneek in late at night to view the face.</B>
<P><B>     If you have any questions or would just like to contact me my

e-mail</B>

<P><B>So i took a flashlght and went up to look.</B>
<P><B>Well I got my head in and had the flashlight on and was just starting

to</B>
<P><B>look around when I felt this cold breeze on the back of my head.</B>
<P><B>I felt like some one was breathing on my neck(this was in the middle

of</B>
<P><B>summer ,a attic crawl space should be HOT!)</B>
<P><B>Well I felt a feeling of extreme terror and practically fell out of

the</B>
<P><B>opening ,dropping my flashlight as I came down.</B>
<P><B>It took me almost an hour to get enough courage to close the opening</B>
<P><B>back up again.  </B>
<P><B>Well a week past and I started to see things out of the corner of my</B>
<P><B>eye.First it was just sudden glimpses,but then it happened more

often.</B>
<P><B>I finaly realized I would only see these strange things when the door

to</B>
<P><B>the opening was OPEN!</B>
<P><B>I told my mom to please keep it closed,she never asked why she just

said</B>
<P><B>she would.</B>
<P><B>It never failed .I could always tell when the door was open.One night

I</B>
<P><B>was sitting in the living room (in the dark) talking to one of my</B>
<P><B>friends on the phone when I saw something look out of my bedroom

 right</B>
<P><B>in the direction of the chair I was sitting in.right away I dropped

the</B>
<P><B>phone and ran into the dinning room where my mom and her boyfriend

were</B>
<P><B>sitting and slammed the door to the attic closed.I even yelled at her

to</B>
<P><B>"keep the damn door closed,PLEASE".when I went back ,it was gone and

as</B>
<P><B>long as the door was closed I never saw IT again.</B>
<P><B>We have moved now and I dont see things out of the corner of my eye</B>
<P><B>anymore.But thinking of that place still gives me the creeps!</B>

<H3><A NAME=events>Unexplained Events</A>
</H3><P><B>by FAYBELL1@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My stories relate to things dissappearing in my home and light bulbs

burning out.</B>
<P><B>when I purchased my first condo, in No. Calif., a friend gave me a
hand made a simple basket with pink flowers as a housewarming gift. About
1 yr. later I was transferred to So. calif. In my new condo, that I was renting,

I put this hand-made basket on my kitchen counter. Less than a yr later,
I came home from work one day,  turned on the tv and was standing in the
kitchen fixing something to eat, when I realized something was not right.
Then I noticed that I cound see the tv screen, from the kitchen, un-obstructed.

The simple/nothing flower basket was gone.  Noramally, I would have to slide
the basket to one side of the counter to view  the tv in the living room.
I searched and I search the entire,  small,  condo for the basket, but never
did find it. I was living in a security bld. located on the 2nd floor. Nothing

else was missing. Also,  while living in that condo, I awoke in the middle
of the night and saw a man standing in my bedroom doorway, and then in my

bathroom sitting on the shower door watching me. I thought it was a dream,
but now when I think about it, I don't think I dreamed it. However, I remember

being in a dream like state. About 4 years went without incident, for the
most part. </B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1995 I was relocated back to No. Calif. and purchased a, brand new,

condo. Then about 2 yrs. later,  another strange thing occured. The lighting

fixtures,  in both bathrooms,  has 8 25watt lightbulbs, across the top of
the mirror, on a medal frame. For some reason, the lightbulbs in my master

bathroom are constantly burning out. True this bathroom gets the most use,
 but it seems about every couple of weeks two lightbulbs will burn out. I
thought this was a little excessive, but did not give it much thought. Until
one day I was getting out of the shower, and for some reason, something made
me look-up at the track of lightbulbs, one of them was flickering and then
burnt out. Although I was getting tired of replacing the lightbulbs, I still
did not give much thought to the event. Then about 3 days later, while in
my spare bedroom working on my computer, I went into my bathroom turned on
the lights, and again something made me look up at the lightsbulbs The light
bulb that had burned out a few days prior was gone. The socket that you screw
the lightbulb into was empty. </B>
<P><B> I just stared at the empty socket in disbelief.  I live along, no
one had been over, no one else has a key to my condo  and I know that I did
not remove that lightbulb. For one, I would have put in a new lightbulb,
and for two, I'm only 5'1'' so I would have had to stand on the toliet set
lid to reach the light fixture. Since it is a production for me to change
the lightbulbs, I  think I would have rememberd doing so.  I now think there
is something more involved and causing the frequent event of the lightbulbs
to burn out.</B>
<P><B>Excatly what is involved here,  I do not know but it's something.</B>
<P><B> I have started to keep a log, by lightbulb socket# 1-8,  of which

lightbulb burns out and the date a new bulb is added. I started the log on,
Oct 1, 1997. Since then, I have changed the lightbulb in socket# 5  two times.

Socket #'s 1,2,3,4,7,8 I have changed the lightbulb 1 time each, and for
socket #6 I have not changed the lightbulb at all. (at least not since keeping
 a log)   It seems, for some reason, that when 1 lightbulb burns out, a second

lightbulb will also burn out with in a few days. So for that reason, I'm
usually changing the lightbulbs in pairs.  </B>
<P><B>Two lightbulbs on 10/1/97. Two on 11/6/97. Two on 12/8/97. Two on 1/27/98.

 </B>
<P><B>These lightbulbs are the round clear fat lightbulbs, and they are

expensive.</B>
<P><B>If anyone out there has any input as to what is going on here, please

by-all-means, drop me an email. </B>
<P><B>My tv remote control has also mysteriously disappeared as well, and
I have never lost a tv remote control before. In reading some of the other

stories submitted here, there's seems to be alot of experiences or situations

surrounding energy sources such as electric lights, tv's, stereos, small

appliances and battery operated flash lights.</B>
<P><B> I have become very sensitive,  and if I'm not totally pre-occupied
by other events,  I get a tingling (static electricty feeling) sensation
whenever another energy presence is in the room or house. </B>
<P><B>I have also experienced the feeling of some one getting into my bed
 and lying on-top of me. This seems to occur when you are in the last stage

before going into a deep sleep. </B>
<P><B> although it seems to be extremely diffucult to come out of this paralized

state/stage of sleep,  I now force myself to wake completely and say out
loud, "get off of me and go away". (or I ask my decease mother or grandmother
to intervene).  </B>

<P>
<P><B>I have seen your site....and think it is wonderful....I would like
to</B>
<P><B>tell a story of my own...ever since I was very little, odd things

have</B>
<P><B>always happened to me...the story I would like to tell is about my</B>
<P><B>grandmother's funeral. She died in the spring of 1997. My family and</B>
<P><B>whatever relatives that live in San Antonio Tx were attending the</B>
<P><B>service. The pastor did not know her, but was saying the usual things</B>
<P><B>about what a nice person she was and blah, blah, blah. Towards the

end</B>
<P><B>of the memorial when this guy is winding up, he talked about life</B>
<P><B>ever-lasting and how the soul never dies. There were like two lamp

posts</B>
<P><B>on each side of her coffin with flowers and pictures in between them.</B>
<P><B>Anyway when he get towards the end of the sermon, one of the lights</B>
<P><B>flickers when he is talking about how the soul goes on forever, then

the</B>
<P><B>darn thing goes out completely for about 15 seconds. Before the light</B>
<P><B>began to act funny, the hair on my arms and neck are standing

straight</B>
<P><B>up like I'm sticking my finger in an electric socket! Not trying to

be</B>
<P><B>too funny...in my head I start hearing the theme to "Twilght Zone".

She</B>
<P><B>was a huge fan of the program. I have a son who is 21 years old and
a</B>
<P><B>daughter who is 17...they too say they had this experience...but no

one</B>
<P><B>else did. In fact they asked me about it before I could question them.

I</B>
<P><B>do know for a fact there were at least 20 others in the church with

us</B>
<P><B>and we did ask if any one else had seen anything out of the</B>
<P><B>ordinary....but no! I personaly think she was trying to tell who ever</B>
<P><B>could "hear" that yes, she was still alive only not in the physical</B>
<P><B>body. That we do survive death! Who Knows for sure?</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Own Experience</A>
</H3><P><B>by starsign19@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>dear shadows i don't know if this counts as a "ghostly" experience

but</B>
<P><B>it certainly was scary.when i was about 14 yrs old or so i joined a
</B>
<P><B>youth club at our local church (Christ Church, The Church of England)

</B>
<P><B>and started attending the sunday services as well. Soon i became a
</B>
<P><B>staunch christian attending bible studies as well. My best friend,
Naomi </B>
<P><B>was the person that introdeced me to the youth club.Her father was
a </B>
<P><B>minister that dealt with people that approached the church with </B>
<P><B>"problems" like possessions &amp; hauntings.Anyway one night i was
just </B>
<P><B>about to doze off when a strange humming sound started at my head behind

</B>
<P><B>me , i had a headboard with a built in light and i thought perhaps
it </B>
<P><B>was an electrical fault with the bulb.As soon as i moved to check it
the </B>
<P><B>humming stopped. i ignored it then went to sleep.The next night the
same </B>
<P><B>noise started again. i ignored it but the noise came closer and it
was </B>
<P><B>more of a vibration now it "came over" my head and as soon as that
</B>
<P><B>happened i could not move.I found that my body felt like concrete and
i </B>
<P><B>could not even bend my pinky finger. I had this feeling though that
if i </B>
<P><B>could just move the tiniest bit or speak</B>
<P><B>then this thing would go away. i fought it mentally ,just willing it
to </B>
<P><B>go away . this story goes on for about 2 years so I'll condense it
</B>
<P><B>slightly. As time went by i became more afraid this was becoming more

</B>
<P><B>severe it felt like something slipped into me and held me prisoner
and i </B>
<P><B>could not move. i began sleeping with bibles in my bed to protect me
and </B>
<P><B>i found that if i was touching something living it seemed to have </B>
<P><B>trouble taking me over.(i must emphasise i never saw anything &amp;
it never </B>
<P><B>made me do anything but it was just a strong presence)for this reason
i </B>
<P><B>would let my maltese dog sleep on the bed and would grab onto her when
i </B>
<P><B>felt the vibrations.I told my friend Naomi about it &amp; she was not
sure </B>
<P><B>what it was,she wanted me to speak to her father but i felt silly &amp;
did </B>
<P><B>not want to. One night i thought</B>
<P><B>what if this isn't a bad presence but a good one? perhaps my fear is
</B>
<P><B>stopping me from an incredibly divine experience so i decided i would

</B>
<P><B>not fight it that night. when the vibrations started i tried to relax

</B>
<P><B>and be calm. i didn't fight it (remember once it is over me i cannot
</B>
<P><B>move or speak)i let it come over me with no struggle , seconds later
i </B>
<P><B>definately felt that this was a bad,bad thing. Nothing good would have

</B>
<P><B>let me feel so afraid.I had to fight really hard to make it go away.
By </B>
<P><B>this stage after months of fighting this thing off every night i was
</B>
<P><B>exhausted every day and my teachers were starting to ask me if i was
</B>
<P><B>alright.Naomi was the only one that knew what was wrong.she said perhaps

</B>
<P><B>because i was a "good" person "bad" forces were attacking me.after
about </B>
<P><B>2 years this happened less frequently but still scared me . I am 27
now </B>
<P><B>and although it almost never happens it occasionally does,i have moved

</B>
<P><B>several times so it is not dependant on the place, it follows me around.

</B>
<P><B>I can find no pattern as to my emotional state, or time of year,or
</B>
<P><B>country or any pattern whatsovever and although more than a decade
has </B>
<P><B>gone by if someone can explain what that was that terrified me for
years  </B>
<P><B>i would appreciate it. you can mail me on starsign19@hotmail.com </B>

<H3><A NAME=few>A Few Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by jorcutt@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B> I have had quite a few little experiences in my sixteen years of life,

</B>
<P><B>but I will only relate the ones that really seem important.  A few
years </B>
<P><B>back, before I moved in with my grandparents, I was baby-sitting my
two </B>
<P><B>little sisters, my little brother, and one of their friends.  It got
</B>
<P><B>really boring, but they wanted me to do something with them, so I pulled

</B>
<P><B>out a big box of "censored by my parents" books that I kept hidden.
 </B>
<P><B>These books were mostly R.L. Stine books and those sort.  I started
</B>
<P><B>reading one of them to the kids, and one of my sisters went into the
</B>
<P><B>kitchen (adjecent to the living room where I was).  About two minutes

</B>
<P><B>later we heard an ear-shattering crash.  I ran into the kitchen and
</B>
<P><B>there was my sister, paralyzed by the shock, standing in front of our

</B>
<P><B>icebox (just a shelving unit of some sort, about three feet high.)
 The </B>
<P><B>icebox had a sheet of glass on top of it, about two inches thick that

</B>
<P><B>protected the icebox from scratches.  It had shattered.  I'm not talking

</B>
<P><B>cracked, or broken, I'm talking split into a million pieces and had
</B>
<P><B>flown everywhere in the room, but miraculously not touching my sister.

 </B>
<P><B>We stood in shock for about five minutes, then I asked my sister what

</B>
<P><B>she had done to the glass.  She began crying hysterically and said
that </B>
<P><B>she'd only touched it with a plastic bag in passing.  Now, my sister
was </B>
<P><B>about five or six years old at this time, and although I know she has
a </B>
<P><B>tendency to lie, there was no way that she could have produced the
</B>
<P><B>hysterics that she was having if she was lying.  I suppose she could
</B>
<P><B>have touched a pressure point on the glass, but I still highly doubt
</B>
<P><B>that the glass would have flown to every corner in the room.</B>
<P><B>  This experience comes from my mom, who used to be involved in the
</B>
<P><B>occult during college (I should take a moment here to say that I've
</B>
<P><B>considered myself Wiccan for the past year and a half, so I have no
</B>
<P><B>problem with what she says she did.)  She was in to astrology and stuff

</B>
<P><B>like that.  She tells me that on one of her vacations home, she was
in a </B>
<P><B>back bedroom with her little brother (my uncle) and they were the only

</B>
<P><B>ones home when the bathroom (just a bit down the hall from the bedroom)

</B>
<P><B>light began flickering on and off, not electrical because they could
</B>
<P><B>hear the light switch clicking up and down.  Not too long after that,

</B>
<P><B>she was lying in bed listening to the radio, and I forget what song
was </B>
<P><B>playing, but it was a popular New Age song, and the radio dial began
</B>
<P><B>turning, like someone was trying to change the station, but the same
</B>
<P><B>song kept playing, without interruption.</B>
<P><B>  The final event I will tell you involves my own personal ghost. 
I </B>
<P><B>have lived with my grandparents for about four and a half years, and
I </B>
<P><B>never noticed anything odd about my room except for the fact that it
was </B>
<P><B>always colder than the rest of the house. (I'm going to give a little

</B>
<P><B>history on the house and the room just to clear up any suspicions.
 The </B>
<P><B>house was built in the early seventies, but the people who built it
</B>
<P><B>moved out after six months for what seemed to be financial reasons.
 My </B>
<P><B>grandparents bought it soon after and have been living here ever since.

 </B>
<P><B>My grandfather's grandmother came to live with them before I was born,

</B>
<P><B>and she was quite a cranky old lady, although she loved me to death
when </B>
<P><B>I was born.  She never got along with my grandmother, feeling that
my </B>
<P><B>grandpa deserved better.  Anyway, Nena (my grandpa's grandmother) lived

</B>
<P><B>in what is now my room for a long time, having a small bathroom </B>
<P><B>installed the closet and having her own hospital bed.  She was moved
to </B>
<P><B>a nursing home when I was two or three, due to her increasingly </B>
<P><B>worsening mental and physical condition.  She died when I was about
</B>
<P><B>five.  The room she had occupied was then transformed into a playroom

</B>
<P><B>for myself and my younger sister.  When I moved in with my grandparents,

</B>
<P><B>I claimed the room and turned it into my own.)  When I began to get
</B>
<P><B>involved with Wicca and other "different" things such as ghosts, I
began </B>
<P><B>to notice that I could feel a presence in my room at different times.
 I </B>
<P><B>knew that it was male, but I never heard it or saw it.  It would mostly

</B>
<P><B>stay in my room, but occasionally it would follow me around the house.

 </B>
<P><B>The most unusual thing about this ghost was that whenever I was really

</B>
<P><B>tense or upset, I would feel ice-cold sensations on my back and neck,

</B>
<P><B>like he was giving me a backrub.  I loved these.  I could sense him
</B>
<P><B>strongest when I would come into my room from the shower, wearing only
a </B>
<P><B>towel, but I could always tell that he would turn away when I was </B>
<P><B>dressing.  On one occasion, I was changing in my grandmother's room,
and </B>
<P><B>out of the corner of my eye I saw a man, perhaps six feet tall, in
his </B>
<P><B>twenties, wearing a blue shirt, standing in the doorway.  My heart
</B>
<P><B>stopped, and I froze where I was, too scared to turn and look.  I </B>
<P><B>finally did, and there was nothing there.  On returning to my room,
I </B>
<P><B>heard him for the first time.  I didn't hear it as I would hear someone

</B>
<P><B>talking, but it was more like he was communicating with me </B>
<P><B>telepathically.  He told me that his name was Ralph.  He became a </B>
<P><B>constant companion to me, keeping me company on many lonely nights.
 I </B>
<P><B>only told one person, my best friend, about Ralph, and she believed
me.  </B>
<P><B>We would be without Ralph for a few days, then he would come in and
we </B>
<P><B>would tease him about being out at a ghost bar drinking and picking
up </B>
<P><B>ghost chicks.  At the time I felt I knew him well enough to tease him,

</B>
<P><B>but every time that we or I would tease him, I would feel his friendly

</B>
<P><B>presence turn angry.  During the summer, I would often sleep in the
</B>
<P><B>guest room because that's where our computer was.  I never felt Ralph
in </B>
<P><B>that room until one night when I had just laid down to sleep, around
two </B>
<P><B>or three in the morning.  I was just drifting off to sleep when I felt

</B>
<P><B>Ralph's presence, along with another unfamiliar presence.  I greeted
</B>
<P><B>Ralph warmly, and joked again about him having been out at a ghost
bar.  </B>
<P><B>I went to turn over to get more comfortable, and found that I couldn't

</B>
<P><B>move anything except for my head, which I could turn slightly.  I began

</B>
<P><B>to get very scared, and I begged for Ralph to let me up.  To this day,
I </B>
<P><B>don't know if it was Ralph or the other presence that held me down.
 </B>
<P><B>Anyway, I was basically paralyzed for about five minutes, and during
</B>
<P><B>that time, I could hear in my mind two men, sounding drunk, laughing
and </B>
<P><B>joking about me.  Finally I was able to move, and I just layed in bed

</B>
<P><B>for the rest of the night, trying to put the experience off to </B>
<P><B>imagination or exhaustion.  I couldn't.  The next night I did a blessing

</B>
<P><B>of my house and told any beings present that they were to leave.  I
did </B>
<P><B>not encounter Ralph again until about two months ago, when a couple
</B>
<P><B>friends and I (one of them being the one I had told about Ralph) were

</B>
<P><B>playing with a Ouija board.  She asked if I would mind bringing Ralph

</B>
<P><B>back.  I reluctently agreed, and we asked him to come back.  I told
him </B>
<P><B>he could stay with me if he never pulled what he had pulled again,
and </B>
<P><B>he agreed.  He stayed with me for a couple of nights, but then left
to </B>
<P><B>who-knows-where.</B>

</H3><P><B>by sbellas@lycosemail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is the story of my first "ghost" sighting.  This occurred when
I</B>
<P><B>was in sixth grade right after my grandfather's death.  My

grandfather's</B>
<P><B>funeral was held in his home.  I was quite upset over his death.</B>
<P><B>Unwilling to see him dead in his own home, I chose to stay home while

my</B>
<P><B>family went to pay respects.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Around dusk, I went upstairs to my room to get something.  After

turning</B>
<P><B>the corner of the stairwell, I saw my grandfather standing in the

door</B>
<P><B>of my bedroom.  He was dressed in funeral garb, a black suit and I</B>
<P><B>specifically remember how shiny his shoes were.  After he scowled at

me</B>
<P><B>I ran screaming down the stairs.  I had a feeling that if I turned
on</B>
<P><B>all the lights, the tv, and the stereo, I would be protected from him.

</B>
<P><B>After this occurrence, I was afraid to sleep alone in my room for

many</B>
<P><B>years.</B>
<P><B>////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</B>

<P>
<P><B>This next occurence happened when I was in 11th grade.  My sister was</B>
<P><B>away at college and my mother was the only other female besides me</B>
<P><B>living in our house at the time.  On a school night I fell asleep on

our</B>
<P><B>downstairs living room sofa.  I was awakened to the sound of the</B>
<P><B>basement door opening.  A glowing white woman emerged from the

basement</B>
<P><B>with her long and very blond hair streaming behind her.  She had on
a</B>
<P><B>flowing white dress and spoke with a very soft, light, and peaceful</B>
<P><B>voice.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>She came to where I was lying and told me to go to my room.  She said</B>
<P><B>that it was a school night and that I needed to set my alarm in order

to</B>
<P><B>wake up the next morning.  I was quite confused and convinced myself</B>
<P><B>that she was my mother and I got up.  I was quite wobbly and unsteady

as</B>
<P><B>I made my way to the stairwell. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As I started up the stairs, I was so sleepy that I thought I would

fall</B>
<P><B>and almost did.  I felt hands on my lower back protecting me from a</B>
<P><B>fall.  I looked behind me (I could still feel the hands on me) but
I</B>
<P><B>couldn't see anyone behind me.  When I woke up the next morning I was</B>
<P><B>quite perplexed that I was in my own bed.  I asked my mother why she</B>
<P><B>woke me up the night before and she denied any involvement.  To this</B>
<P><B>day, I have no idea who the apparition was.</B>
<P><B>////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</B>

<P>
<P><B>My next strange tale occurred in November of 1991 after I had moved

to</B>
<P><B>Boston.  I was living in an old abandoned distillery in South Boston.

</B>
<P><B>The entire building housed artists.  I met three artist neighbors,

one</B>
<P><B>of whom was a practicing wiccan.  They held a welcoming ceremony for

me</B>
<P><B>as I had just moved in.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The ceremony was rather wiccan in nature and included the circle of</B>
<P><B>candles with the offerings to the spirits.  After we closed the

circle</B>
<P><B>we went upstairs to the kitchen to have some drinks.  This woman

lived</B>
<P><B>in a huge loft space with three floors.  Her basement, which is where

we</B>
<P><B>held the ceremony, was on the sixth floor of the distillery.  The

wiccan</B>
<P><B>woman went back to the basement to get something.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A few minutes later, she came running up the stairs with an offering

for</B>
<P><B>me which she said she found in the middle of where our circle had

been</B>
<P><B>drawn.  She held in her hands a purple hyacinth, my favorite flower.
</B>
<P><B>Now as I mentioned previously, it was winter, we were on the sixth</B>
<P><B>floor, and no windows were open.  I took this as a sign that A) the</B>
<P><B>spirits were pleased that I had decided to move to Boston, or B) she

was</B>
<P><B>forcing bulbs quite early in the season.  I chose option A.  If

anyone</B>
<P><B>has any comments feel free to send some mail.  Sincerely S</B>

</H3><P><B>by Wdmkr@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This happend over five years ago, but everything your going to read
is true.I was living in Maryland at the time. While I was giving my daughter
a bath my husband recieved a phone call. It was my mom. Her dad had died
that afternoon. I was very upset. We were a close family. Everyone else was
in another state,New York. But after I cried myself to sleep that night,
I woke up. It was around 3 or 4 in the morning. And there was my husband
sitting on the bed with his head down. I told him to go to bed get some sleep.

And he patted me on my leg and got up. The next morning when I got up. I
was the first on up. I went down stairs to find my husband sleeping on the
couch. When he got up I told him he didn't have to sit up with me last night.
He said he didn't. He was tired and fell asleep on the couch. He never went

upstairs that night. Well I just put it off to being upset and all. Well
when we went home for the funeral I got taking to my mom. And she had a similar

story about seeing someone that night. Well  after talking to other people
in the family everyone had a story about that night. I guess Grandpa wanted
to say good-bye to everyone that night. And till this day, I can still smell
his pipe.</B>

<P><B>This happened to my friend. She comes from Crewe, in Cheshire,

England.</B>
<P><B>An old man and his grandson were murdered in a council house by</B>
<P><B>burglars. After the funerals, new people moved in. These new tenants</B>
<P><B>reported strange flapping sounds, radio interference, unexplained

cold</B>
<P><B>spots and ghosts seen. This also happened to the next-door

neighbour's.</B>
<P><B>The tenants and neighbours moved out, and the house was boarded up,

but</B>
<P><B>Carol tells me that once, when passing the house at night, she

witnessed</B>
<P><B>a pair of wings, flapping at the upstairs windows.It was not a bird,

as</B>
<P><B>the wings were not birdlike. No windows were open and the roof was
in</B>
<P><B>good repair. Both houses remain boarded up to my knowledge, as nobody

in</B>
<P><B>Crewe will inhabit the houses, and even vagrants shun them. This</B>

</H3><P><B>by P.GRIFFITHS@uk22p.bull.co.uk </B>
<P>
<P><B>This tale concerns a haunted piano, rather than a haunted house.</B>
<P><B>Some years ago, a friend of mine bought a small piano. This was a</B>
<P><B>second-hand piano and the two ladies who sold it to him, seemed glad

to</B>
<P><B>be rid of it. After only one week, notes on the piano began to play</B>
<P><B>during the night and day, when nobody was in the same room. My

friend's</B>
<P><B>sister also experienced strange events at this time - curtains

blowing</B>
<P><B>when no windows were open and doors opening and closing under their

own</B>
<P><B>steam. The piano also began to slam its cover down whenever it was</B>
<P><B>played and the music lectern moved of its own volition, witnessed by

all</B>
<P><B>members of the household. Not surprisingly, once the piano was

re-sold,</B>
<P><B>all supernatural events surrounding it, stopped. This happened in an</B>
<P><B>ordinary house in Hanwell, West London.</B>

<H3><A NAME=only>My Only "ghost" Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	moziechloe@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure if this can be considered a ghost story. But here goes:</B>
<P><B>   </B>
<P><B>When I was much younger, around maybe 5 or 6, something strange but
not </B>
<P><B>entirely bad happened to me. I was very, very prone to nose bleeds
</B>
<P><B>during my childhood. Some would last for up to almost 3 hours and my
</B>
<P><B>parents, not having much else to do, simply instructed me to lay down.

</B>
<P><B>This would of course result in blood slowly trickling down my throat,

</B>
<P><B>which in turn, resulted in some more (ahem) gruesome events because
my </B>
<P><B>stomach wouldn't hold it. Often in my sleep, my nose bled and I wouldn't

</B>
<P><B>even be aware of it, until I woke up with a horribly stained pillow.
One </B>
<P><B>night in particular, when my parents had to unexpectedly leave, they
</B>
<P><B>left me alone in the house, right after putting me to bed. I awoke
</B>
<P><B>coughing and choking on blood. It was pitch dark and I instantly sat
up </B>
<P><B>when I felt someone sit down next to me on the bed. Well, I was just
a </B>
<P><B>kid, so I automatically assumed it was my mother, home early, or </B>
<P><B>something.  A large clot of blood had formed on my tongue and I couldn't

</B>
<P><B>even speak. So my first reaction was to spit into my hand and ask my
</B>
<P><B>mother for a tissue. But before I could spit into my raised hand, she

</B>
<P><B>gently put her hand on mine and used a wad of tissue to wipe off my
</B>
<P><B>tongue. Then she got up and left my room and I just laid back down
and </B>
<P><B>went to sleep. Later, the next day, I thought it strange that my mother

</B>
<P><B>hadn't turned on the lights (both my parents knew I was terrified of
the </B>
<P><B>dark), hadn't said a word, and hadn't brought me a cup of water to
wash </B>
<P><B>out my mouth. So, I asked her and she said that she didn't even go
into </B>
<P><B>my room the night before. She said she and my father had come home
with </B>
<P><B>my brother and they talked at the dinner table for a while before </B>
<P><B>turning in for the night. She said no one had gone into my room and
</B>
<P><B>suggested it was all a dream, but that doesn't explain the traces of
</B>
<P><B>blood still left in my mouth that morning. We have since moved from
that </B>
<P><B>house, in Stafford, VA, but after that one event from my childhood,
</B>
<P><B>there were more occurrences in the same house. None of them were bad
and </B>
<P><B>mostly happend during the night. As I said, I was and admittingly still

</B>
<P><B>am, terrified of the dark. And many times when I woke up at night and

</B>
<P><B>tried to find my way to my parents' room in the dark, I would feel
</B>
<P><B>something constantly at my side, softly nudging me until I reached
their </B>
<P><B>door. I never told anyone because I felt like this was MY friend and
no </B>
<P><B>one else in the house ever spoke of strange things happening to them,
so </B>
<P><B>I just thought I'd be chastised for an overractive imagination. Thanks

</B>
<P><B>for giving me the chance to talk about it now, because ever since we
</B>
<P><B>left that house, I've found myself missing that comforting presence
most </B>
<P><B>nights.</B>

<H3><A NAME=hell>Hell and Back</A>
</H3><P><B>by Sarah2732@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>In 1971 my parents bought a house in Syracuse, NY. My family was the
first to live in this house that were not of the house's bloodline.  After
my parents paid fully for the house they obtained the deed. In it were the
names of the entire family that had lived there prior to us, dating back
to 1832. I think that the original family is still there.</B>
<P><B>     Among many things that happened to us (doors opening and closing,

someone walking up and down the stairs every night) I have see the good and
the bad of these spirits. </B>
<P><B>     When I was 11 years old I finally got my own room. Being the youngest

of four this was a very big deal to me...like a right of passage.  I was
placed in the smallest room of the house. But I loved it, until that night.

</B>
<P><B>I woke up at 4:12 am and I heard the most horrible noise. It was like

someone being tortured.  I couldn't sleep for the rest of the night. I ended
up down stairs on the couch. The next night I tried again. And again at 4:12
am I was up.  This went on for about two years before I got sick. I found
out when I was 14 that I had a very serious case of psoriasis.  It may not
sound bad but even the doctor I had (and I had many) said that that they
had never seen anything like it. This problem made me look like a monster.
I was head to toe in it.  There were very large patches on my face and back,
they were painful.  Also it only took a total of three weeks for it to start
and grow. I didn't leave the house for months thinking that I looked like
a burn victim. I stayed in my room though and every night at 4:12 am I got
woken up by the horrible noise. </B>
<P><B>My parents got very worried by my behavior and they wanted to seek
help for me. I just wanted to get to a library and find out what was in my

room.</B>
<P><B>     So it came to me one day to look at the deed. It seems that a
young girl about my age was burned, almost to death in my room in 1892. 
(I obtained this information by the family of the previous owners.)  The
young girl was in  the care of her aunts at the time. They fixed the room
after the fire and hid her there like a dirty secret.  The girl lived there
in that one room for ten years before she committed suicide.</B>
<P><B>      I wasn't ready to wait ten years for it to stop.  But as it turns
out I didn't have to. One night I sat up all night. I just wanted to talk
to her and see if I could help.  Obviously a girl like that didn't have many

friends and now either did I. I knew that she had something to do with me
being like that. I needed answers. 4:12 am came and the screaming started
like clockwork.  I locked my door and left a note for my parents that whatever

they hear they were NOT allowed to open the door.  I heard her scream and
I started to scream with her. Suddenly she stopped. But I kept screaming.
 I began to beg her to help me and told her that I know how she feels.  I
stopped screaming and cried the rest of the night. </B>
<P><B>     The following morning I returned once again to my doctor. He noticed

that the marks on my back were fading and that a very large mark on my forehead

had gotten smaller and lost some of it's color. Within three months my skin
was as clear as it was before the screaming started.  </B>
<P><B>     The noises at 4:12 am stopped. I never heard them again.  Maybe
this is just in my head but I believe that if it wasn't for her I wouldn't
have gotten those marks and if it wasn't for her I wouldn't have lost them.
She did save my life, my fate was close to what hers was. Taking my life
wouldn't have been a problem for me then...I had no life to live.  </B>
<P><B>      There is only one other thing that was strange about this story.
When I looked at the deed I found the girls name, Sarah.  The same as mine.

</B>
<P><B>      Do you think that this is possible?  I no longer live in the
house and have no problems with psoriasis.  I am happily married and have
a beautiful little girl.  Sometimes at night I do wake up at 4:12 am but
this time I feel more of a sense of peace than hurt. I don't hear screaming
but it is just a feeling that Sarah is finally at rest. </B>

<H3><A NAME=farmer>Ghost Farmer</A>
</H3><P><B>by wwishart@mail.auracom.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in a rural area on the island of Cape Breton in the province
of Nova</B>
<P><B>Scotia, Canada. In my barn, I have a Jersey cow, a Holstein bull, a

goat,</B>
<P><B>two Standardbred horses, two Clydesdale horses, and a ghost farmer.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My farm is built on the site of what used to be a farm around the turn

of</B>
<P><B>the century. Maybe what I have is someone who didn't want to leave.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, one day I went down to my barn, and everything was locked up
as I</B>
<P><B>always make sure it is every night. All  the windows and doors were

bolted.</B>
<P><B>But my Clydesdale mare, Bev, who was locked in the barn the night

before,</B>
<P><B>was outside. No way she could get out unless she unlocked all the doors

and</B>
<P><B>then re-locked them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Other times I've gone down and found Bev's mane braided. I've also</B>
<P><B>discovered that my older mare, Carrie, had had her tail trimmed, and

once</B>
<P><B>her mane was feathered - a complex job that I can't even do, and that

takes</B>
<P><B>a competent horse person more than an hour to accomplish. Recently

Carrie</B>
<P><B>and Bev's tails have been trimmed. The ghost farmer seems to have a

real</B>
<P><B>interest in draft horses.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Other times I've found the lights on when I know I've turned them off,

or</B>
<P><B>the door to the haymow open when I know it was closed.  Sometimes the

radio</B>
<P><B>I had turned off is on, or it's tuned to a different station than the
one I</B>
<P><B>usually have it on. The ghost farmer seems to prefer country and

western.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I know that it's not a neighbor playing a joke, because I have about

400</B>
<P><B>collective pounds of doberman here who raise a ruckus when a leaf falls,

let</B>
<P><B>alone when someone comes around.</B>
<P>
<P><B>All of this has been going on for about 4 years, ever since I started</B>
<P><B>keeping horses. The ghost farmer means no harm. In fact, I think he

saved</B>
<P><B>one of my horses. A couple of years ago, Bev got sick. Really, really

sick.</B>
<P><B>Dying sick. But it was an ailment that no one could have seen just
by</B>
<P><B>looking at the horse. Something kept nagging at me, saying, "Call the

vet</B>
<P><B>for Bev. Do it. Do it NOW." I fought the feeling for a couple of days,

then</B>
<P><B>called the vet on nothing more than that feeling. And the vet told
me if I'd</B>
<P><B>waited another day, Bev would have been dead from a still undiagnosed

blood</B>
<P><B>ailment, and he was just amazed that I'd called based on nothing more
than a</B>
<P><B>feeling. Well, of course I called. Thanks, ghost farmer. Whoever you

are,</B>
<P><B>you can stay. Just stop leaving the haymow door open, please.</B>

<H3><A NAME=2>2 Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, here are two other quick ghost stories that actually happened
to me.</B>
<P><B>About two years ago my mother and law whom is a therapist took on the
task of becoming a live in therapist to one of her very ill patients. This
woman was 52 and her mother had died in the house a year earlier.</B>
<P><B>It was around Christmas time and I was in the kitchen making Starbucks

coffee for my husband and his mother and Claudia when they returned. Claudia
was my mother in laws patient. My husband and I were staying with them for
the holidays to help out and visit. Besides my mother in law needed other
sane people to talk to because Claudia is not exactly what you'd call a very
sane person.</B>
<P><B>Everyone was gone shopping. I was staying with my dog, and Claudia's
two dogs. After I finished making the coffee I took my dog out for a walk.</B>
<P><B>I was outside standing 3 feet from the livingroom window when I noticed

someone in the house. I looked and got closer. I was standing a foot away
from the window watching Claudia's dead mother taking Christmas ortaments
off the tree and placing them on the piano. Shock is not the word. I wanted
to run screaming down the street. Instead I just stood, scared out of my
mind watching her until every Christmas ortament was off the tree and on
the piano. I ran in the house with my dog in tow. Claudia's mom looked up
at me like she was scared out of her mind and shrunk into the wall. When
my mother and law and my husband and Claudia got back they asked me what

happened. I reluctantly took my mother in law to the side and told her exactly

what had happened. </B>
<P><B>I thought she would tell me I was absolutely full of it but she didn't.
She told me that one night she was asleep in the bedroom, Claudia's mother
had died in and she saw a human form take shape under the covers in the other

twin bed beside her. She went and touched it and it fell flat again. She
also told me that she was in the den meditating one night and she opened
her eyes and Claudia's mother was watching her. When she stared right back
at her, Claudia's mom dissapeared.</B>
<P><B>One night my mother and law was asleep and Claudia's mother and father
came in the bedroom and stood at the foot of the bed staring at my mother
in law telling her to leave this house that she wasn't welcome and to leave
there daughter alone.</B>
<P><B>We ended up cleansing the house with Sage and everytime after that
that we felt the presence we told it to leave, that it wasn't their house

anymore. It worked but they ended up moving last year anyway.</B>
