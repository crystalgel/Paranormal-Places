<b>My Experience with Angeline</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Shaylund@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I first got married, I was really young, and we lived with my</b>
<br><b>mother for about 2 months. My mother's house is very old, and my</b>
<br><b>grandmother, Angeline, had grown up in the house. Early one morning,
as</b>
<br><b>I was getting ready for work, I noticed the smell of Granny Angeline's</b>
<br><b>perfume. It smelled of flowers, and vanilla, a delightful smell.
I</b>
<br><b>always loved that smell, I always felt warm and protected when I
smelled</b>
<br><b>it. Three years later, I had my first child, a boy, by the name
of</b>
<br><b>Jericho. Jericho looked exactly like granny Angeline, and my mother
said</b>
<br><b>if Granny Angeline was alive, she would</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;have spoiled Jericho rotten! I knew granny Angeline watched
over</b>
<br><b>Jericho whenever he played. When Jericho was 3, my mother, (Granna
Mae</b>
<br><b>to him) was looking at some family pictures, and when she came to
a</b>
<br><b>picture of Granny Angeline, Jericho smiled and said "thats Granny</b>
<br><b>Ashaline!" (he could'nt yet pronounce Angeline, (the "ine" on the
end is</b>
<br><b>pronounced like ice, with a "n" instead of a "c")</b>
<br><b>I asked Jericho how he knew that, and she said "she pushed me up
the</b>
<br><b>hill on my John Deere!"</b>
<br><b>(Jericho has a small John Deere tractor, as he is OBSESSED with
John</b>
<br><b>Deere stuff)</b>
<br><b>I knew Granny Angeline was there, and I'm sure she still is. thanks
for</b>
<br><b>your time.</b>

<p><b>Our Lady Spook</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:celticspirit25@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mother sister and I moved into a house with my grandmother. The
house was 30 years old or so but being in Ohio that land it self had history.</b>
<br><b>One night I was asleep in my room which was down stairs.&nbsp; I
was woke up by what felt like someone "tucking" me in. I felt the hand
move across my belly pulling the blanket up or trying to.&nbsp; I shot
up and turned on the light and there was nothing there.</b>
<br><b>several months later I was again asleep when I heard my bedroom
door open. When the door opened it would rub on the carpet.&nbsp; But the
first think I noticed was the I did not hear the door open as I usually
do because the door always sticks.&nbsp; Then I realized that i did not
hear the bell i kept on my door either which always rang.&nbsp; When I
shot up and turned on the light this time I instinctively looked to the
far side of my room. There I saw my ferret looking in a corner of a room
that there was nothing in. My ferret looked at me then back at the corner.&nbsp;
I turned off the light and quietly said "if you want to stay in here that
is fine but please let me sleep.&nbsp; I really need my rest. " From then
on when ever I felt our lady spook it was when I was awake.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Old House</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Dansmomi@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Hello,&nbsp; when I was a young kid we lived in South West Philadelphia.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think</b>
<br><b>I was about 4, I was sick, I woke up one night because I felt my
bed moving.</b>
<br><b>When I looked up there was 4 shadowy people around my bed, rocking
it. They</b>
<br><b>had no faces and they didn't look like they had clothes on. I don't
know what</b>
<br><b>the purpose of this was, but I wasn't scared, I just looked at them
and went</b>
<br><b>back to sleep.&nbsp; Another time I was sitting on our landing and
looked up the</b>
<br><b>steps and I saw two shadows running back and forth, it looked like
they were</b>
<br><b>playing tag.&nbsp; I was never afraid of these things, I didn't
feel they would</b>
<br><b>hurt me, but when I would go up the steps by myself I remember being
feeling</b>
<br><b>like someone was watching me, but nothing ever happened to me.&nbsp;
They weren't</b>
<br><b>mean as far as I could tell.</b>
<br><b>I didn't realize they were ghosts until I was much older and didn't
live in</b>
<br><b>the house anymore.&nbsp; My mother grew up in that house.&nbsp;
She had some</b>
<br><b>experiences, but nothing she would ever really go into to much detail
about.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The only experience I remember that she would talk about was
after her</b>
<br><b>grandmother died (she died in the house) her dog started going nuts
in the</b>
<br><b>middle room.&nbsp; He was looking at the middle of the room and
jumping up and</b>
<br><b>down.&nbsp; Maybe he saw my great grandmother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't think she really</b>
<br><b>believed in it.&nbsp; I know my uncle, who also grew up there, had
some</b>
<br><b>experiences.&nbsp; He told me once he was sleeping in (my room)
the middle room,</b>
<br><b>when it got real cold and he felt like something was in there with
him, but</b>
<br><b>he didn't know what.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes I still have dreams or nightmares about the house.&nbsp;
I haven't lived</b>
<br><b>in it for over 20 years.&nbsp; Pretty weird huh?</b>
<br><b>I don't know how many ghosts or spirits or what have you were in
that house,</b>
<br><b>but I'm sure there were many and they are probably still there and
still</b>
<br><b>doing their thing.&nbsp; They just didn't seem out to hurt or scare
me.&nbsp; Maybe my</b>
<br><b>greatgrandmother kept them from harming us?&nbsp; Who knows??</b>

<br><b>The Red White and Blue</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: chummer@t-one.net@t-one.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My grandfather passed away last March, and I have&nbsp;
long since been greiving his departure. After my grandfather died my grandmother
was left to live alone in her large house just outside of Irons Michigan.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My uncle and two cousins came up from Indiana
to visit us for a week, this past summer. My sister and I were staying
at my grandmother's&nbsp; to help take care of my cousins. One night we
were having a bon fire in my grandmother's yard which lies right on a lake.
I, the only one sitting next to the fire was thinking about my grandfather
and all of the things we used to do together. My grandmother and sister
were sitting back on the patio watching the fire from there and talking
to my cousins and uncle who were in the house behind a screen door playing
video games. As if he were reading my mind, my cousin made a coment about
my grandfather. "Will Grandpa ever come back Grandma?" he asked. The question
sent a sharp pain through my heart.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No Jimmy, answered my grandmother, grandpa is
always with us, even though you can't see him, he's here in spirit." Of
course my cousin didn't understand this being only four years old, so he
continued with questions. Then quieted and continued to play his video
game.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat still staring at the warm fire, remembering
the times I'd look at my grandfather and see him smiling at the blazing
warmth. Just then I got a strange feeling, and urge to look over at the
flag towering high over me and the fire. It was completely calm. There
was no wind, not even enough to slightly blow a small leaf resting upon
the ground. As I looked up at the flag. I remembered when my grandfather
would come out every morning and raise the flag to the top of the flag
pole and solute it. Smiling as he did so. He was so patriotic.&nbsp; He
loved this country and fought as hard as he could for it while he was in
the army during WWII. I gazed at the beautiful red, white, and blue colors
of our country's flag as it lay limpling hugging the flagpole. Just then,
the flag rose and spread out completely straight. My heart jumped, as I
knew there was no wind to have made this happen. I heard my grandma mutter
"Thank you Carey." I looked back at her and she just smiled.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later I learned that my grandma had said a prayer
to my grandfather. She had said "Carey, If you are here with us. If you
are protecting over these children please give me a sign." That was when
she saw as I had. The flag that he loved so much, spread out straight.
From that moment on I knew that my grandfather was standing with me, protecting
me, and I know he still is to this day.</b>

<p><b>Not just Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Valaria324@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>One of my older brothers, Tim, was born with a veil over his face.
According</b>
<br><b>to the "old wives tales" this means he would be able to see things
that</b>
<br><b>others couldn't. This was proven one April night in 1986.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Being the youngest of seven, and only 18, I still lived at
home when my</b>
<br><b>mother got ill. My oldest sister Penny and Tim had come down to
our house</b>
<br><b>because they were concerned about my Mom being sick. Well, the night
Penny</b>
<br><b>arrived we all sat around laughing and having a good time. We all
then</b>
<br><b>decided to watch a movie (Nightmare on Elm Street). About halfway
through the</b>
<br><b>movie Tim said "Isn't someone going to answer the door?" Since he
likes to</b>
<br><b>pull jokes we all laughed at him and said "Sure I bet it's Freddy
(Krueger)!"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;But he was very adamant that there was someone knocking at
the door. We all</b>
<br><b>looked out the window and there was nobody there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"It's a woman with shoulder length hair wearing a black dress.
She's right</b>
<br><b>there on the steps!" Tim kept insisting and finally he got up and
went</b>
<br><b>outside. When he came back in he said he couldn't find her and she
must have</b>
<br><b>left. We didn't think twice about it until the next day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My mother got worse so my dad and Penny took her to the hospital
(which was</b>
<br><b>60 miles away). About 2 hours after they left Penny (who has shoulder
length</b>
<br><b>hair) called us and said to come right away that our Dad had collapsed
in the</b>
<br><b>ER.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So Tim and I got ready to leave but before we could Penny
called to say our</b>
<br><b>Dad was having a heart attack. So Tim and I got in our cars and
raced down</b>
<br><b>there. When we got there Penny met us at the door and told our Dad
was dead</b>
<br><b>and they had all ready taken him to the morgue. Being in shock we
didn't</b>
<br><b>connect Tim's sighting of the woman in black at the door with what
was</b>
<br><b>happening. But Tim's sightings weren't finished yet.</b>
<br><b>About a month after my Dad was buried, Tim and his wife had gone
to the</b>
<br><b>cemetery to check on the headstone that was supposed to have been
placed that</b>
<br><b>week. They were checking the headstone to make sure the information
on it was</b>
<br><b>correct. Tim said to his wife "Look there's a man dressed like Dad
sitting up</b>
<br><b>there on that bench" (my Dad had been a farmer so he always wore
overalls and</b>
<br><b>straw hat if he was working outside). At first they didn't think
anything of</b>
<br><b>it because the town where my Dad is buried is a farming community
so there's</b>
<br><b>a lot of people dressed that way. Then the man started walking towards
them</b>
<br><b>but no matter how close he got they could never see his face even
though the</b>
<br><b>hat wasn't covering it. Then Tim started to think it was Dad so
he walked</b>
<br><b>towards the man and said" Dad?". The man turned around and started
walking</b>
<br><b>away and they couldn't catch him even though the man only walked
and they</b>
<br><b>ran. He finally disappeared at the edge of the cemetery which was
nothing but</b>
<br><b>a line of trees on the edge of a creek with a plant (factory) a
few hundred</b>
<br><b>yards behind that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When Tim told us about the man in the graveyard everyone thought
he was just</b>
<br><b>missing my Dad until I pointed out that there are NO benches anywhere
in that</b>
<br><b>cemetery.</b>

<br><b>The Incident</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KemahTxCpl@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When my Granddaughter was no more then 1 week old an incident happened
that I</b>
<br><b>will never forget. My daughter was changing Taylor on the floor
and at the</b>
<br><b>top of her head against a wall I had a round table with a heavy
lead crystal</b>
<br><b>platter setting on it. we owned a large grey tabby that was very
playful; and</b>
<br><b>he had jumped over my shoulder and across the round table proceeding
to knock</b>
<br><b>it over and straight for Taylor's head. The platter fell DIRECTLY
down</b>
<br><b>towards the baby's head....but astonishingly enough, it rolled in
the oposite</b>
<br><b>direction, hitting the wall. Everyone screamed including the baby
and I</b>
<br><b>grabbed her up to check for injuries. We took her to the ER and
she was fine.</b>
<br><b>What we did find was a red mark on her forhead,about 1 inch long
and narrow.</b>
<br><b>I believe that this was from a ring on a hand that deflected the
platter.</b>
<br><b>There was NO WAY it could have missed her without help and certainly
would</b>
<br><b>have done horrible damage to an infant' skull.</b>
<br><b>Fate has wanted to print this story, but I have not yet sent in
their</b>
<br><b>paperwork. I will soon. I have had other encounters with the paranormal
and</b>
<br><b>have been drawn to it all my life. I have the gift of psycometry

<p><b>The Picture</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wacker.20@juno.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am young but have had my run of bad luck. When i was
8 two of my</b>
<br><b>dearest friends were shot minutes after i left the woods. Sandy
, Clair</b>
<br><b>and i were in the woods in the summer. We had fallen asleep in the
tree</b>
<br><b>house when all of a sudden</b>
<br><b>i was woke up by a noise. Sandy turned to me in here sleep and told
me to</b>
<br><b>run away as fast as i could. I was shocked and did not want to leave
but</b>
<br><b>then she screamed at me. I took off running into the woods. I stopped
and</b>
<br><b>turned around to hear</b>
<br><b>two gun shots and screams. They had been shot in the sleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Three years later, i was talking on the phone with a friend
and i</b>
<br><b>noticed my dog stareing at the corner of the room where i had a
picture</b>
<br><b>of my friends and i in the woods, i turned and saw a shadow in the
window</b>
<br><b>of a little girl. I told my friend about what i saw,i kept watching.
It</b>
<br><b>turned to me and said to run, run fast. My friend ont the phone
asked who</b>
<br><b>said that. I turned off the phone and ran out of the house just
as a</b>
<br><b>indow was broke in the house by a man with a gun. I ran nextdoor
and</b>
<br><b>called the police.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A week later at about 1 am i saw the picture fall off the</b>
<br><b>wall i went to pick it up and saw that in the picture they were
glowing</b>
<br><b>and pointing to my desk.I walked over to see a small note that read
"</b>
<br><b>Things will be okay, we are with you."&nbsp; I started to cry and
the writeing</b>
<br><b>disappeard. The next day my parents told me that my uncle had died.
I was</b>
<br><b>close to him, he was an artist and was my favorite person in the
world.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I signed my signiture on a paper and i was just like his (i
never saw</b>
<br><b>his before) I could also draw amazingly well!</b>
<br><b>(i could not draw before)</b>

<br><b>Not At Rest</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; patricia_ruiz@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just have a couple of things that have happened in my life; I always
felt that there was a presence in my mother in law's house. One night,
I heard knocking on the door of the room I was sleeping in. I ignored it
at first, but the knocking didn't stop, I knew for sure that it was a knock
at the door. I got up and opened the door, and there was nothing there,
that scared the hell out of me, I felt like I had let it in the room. I
always feel like I'm being followed really closely when I walk through
her house, my sister in law feels that there is something there too. Another
happening was one night when I was driving back to Oceanside from Tijuana
Mexico after a night of partying and a man in all black walked across the
path of my car. I told my mother about it and she said that it was death.
The man didn't have features or anything it was just a slim figure black
from top to bottom that walked across in front of my car. He was just in
the road, he walked slowly across. Another thing that happened both to
me and my mother was while we were both in our beds (separate times) and
I felt that I was being held down to my bed, I tried so hard to move and
call out for my mother, but I could not. I knew that this was death trying
to take me. It makes we almost want to cry remembering it because I could
not move at all. No sound would come out of me, and the same thing happened
to my mother.</b>
<br><b>One thing that happened to my grandmother is that she was forbidden
to be with my grandfather by her father. On her father's death bed, he
made my frandmother promise that she would not see my grandfather anymore
because he cheated on her and beat her. She broke that promise to him and
one night while she was asleep, she dreamt that her father was angry at
her, and he was chasing her, she ran from him and woke up sweating, someone
told her that if her father would have caught her, she would have died
there in her sleep. My grandfather is now dead, he was killed in car accident
8 or so years ago, he has come to me to talk to me, at first I was scared,
my mother told me that if I wanted him to leave me alone, I only had to
ask and he would, but I didn't want that. He visits in my dreams sometimes.
My oldest brother and my grandfather did not get along while my grandfather
was alive and they never made up, but he has come to my brother since his
death to tell him that he loved him, and all was good between them and
he watches over my brothers.</b>
<br><b>When I read the stories of the people who have written in, I feel
chills through my body because I know that it's real and these people's
souls are not at rest.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Mirror Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Eternlnte7@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>There was some sort of ghost in my house not too long ago. I never
managed to</b>
<br><b>get a picture of it because it usually appeared in the mirrors.
Heres the</b>
<br><b>story:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been aware of the haunting for a while,
about a month, since I saw</b>
<br><b>a girl who appeared to be about 14 or 15 in my mirror one day. My
sister saw</b>
<br><b>it one night, and was really freaked out, she ran into my room because
our</b>
<br><b>parents would have yelled at her for making up stories, and told
me she saw a</b>
<br><b>Ghost in her mirror. She described what it looked like, brownish
blonde hair,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;with blue eyes, and wearing an old white dress, and you couldn't
tell how</b>
<br><b>tall she was because she always seemed to be a long distance away.
It only</b>
<br><b>came out of the mirror once, and that was in my sister's room. My
sister had</b>
<br><b>still been really scared, and had dragged me into her room to her
company</b>
<br><b>until she wasn't as scared, and just as I was leaving her room,
my sister</b>
<br><b>said "its back!" rather too loud, waking my parents up who first
yelled at</b>
<br><b>her for screaming and then me for being awake that late. Then the
ghost came</b>
<br><b>out of the mirror in my sister's room. My parents didn't seem to
see it, but</b>
<br><b>me and my sister did. It went right through my dad at me, and it
passed right</b>
<br><b>through me, and went into my room. That was the only time we saw
it outside</b>
<br><b>of the mirrors. It hasn't appeared for about a year now, but now
we have tons</b>
<br><b>of non-human ghosts. These are ghosts who are out of the mirror,
but I</b>
<br><b>haven't even tried to photograph them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everynight, my room is full of them. They are
a lot like the ones that</b>

<p><b>When I was in the 5th grade, in the begining of the school year,

<br><b>About four days later in 2 in the mornings I heard my door open,

<br><b>up (my door is very loud) and no one was there and all of a sudden
my mother</b>

was no</b>

I got up</b>
<br><b>and walked down stairs to see where she went and I saw her sitting
on my</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Strange Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AngelEyez363@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story is rather strange. One night, I went to bed with a somewhat
uneasy</b>
<br><b>feeling. It took me forever just to get to sleep. When I finally
did,I awoke</b>
<br><b>in the middle of the night to find myself unable to move. I looked
up through</b>
<br><b>the covers bunched up around my head to try to figure out what was
happening</b>
<br><b>or what was pinning me to the bed. My aunt was visiting and had
a little cot</b>
<br><b>outside of my room in the hallway. I tried everything I could to
get up and</b>
<br><b>run to her for help. I couldnt move my legs and I was terrified.
I opened my</b>
<br><b>mouth to scream for her, but no sound came out. There, floating
above me, was</b>
<br><b>some sort of small figure w/ a black flowing cape. I stared out
at it in</b>
<br><b>fear. I was so afraid I couldnt even make an attempt to help myself.
After we</b>
<br><b>both looked at eachother for a few seconds, it lifted its above
it's head</b>
<br><b>holding some sort of weapon...I think it was a knife, and I heard
the words,</b>
<br><b>"She always wants to..." As the words were being said from whatever
was</b>
<br><b>saying them, I thought to myself,"In Jesus name, flee." I'm a Christian
so</b>
<br><b>instantly I would turn to God at a time like this. At that moment,
the figure</b>
<br><b>disappeared and I was once again able to move. I was terrified and
tried to</b>
<br><b>convince myself it was a dream as I fell asleep once again. But
this was no</b>
<br><b>dream. My family has experienced many strange things throughtout
their</b>
<br><b>lifetime and there seems to be something that lurks upstairs in
our house</b>
<br><b>constantly. We just hope that it isn't anything that wishes to cause
harm.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep-Over Scare</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BitterPrincess15@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Sarah and I had something strange happen to my when
I wan</b>
<br><b>having a sleep-over.&nbsp; My family had just added two new rooms
on the back part</b>
<br><b>of my house and the day my sister and I got all our furniture moved
in I</b>
<br><b>decided to invite about 5 friends over to spend the night in my
new room.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was about midnight and we decided to play a game called Sardenes.&nbsp;
If you</b>
<br><b>don't know what that game is, it's sorta like the opposite if</b>
<br><b>hide-and-go-seek.&nbsp; You turn out all the lights and one person
hides and</b>
<br><b>everyone goes to find them.&nbsp; When you find the hidden person
you hide in that</b>
<br><b>spot with them untill the last person finds them.&nbsp; Whoever
is last bacomes it</b>
<br><b>in the next round.&nbsp; We were playing it and my sister was it.&nbsp;
Me and one of</b>
<br><b>my friends were the last two people looking.&nbsp; We decided she
was not in my</b>
<br><b>room, so we began looking in her room.&nbsp; My sister had not put
anything in her</b>
<br><b>closet yet, so my friend and I decided that it would be easy to
find her if</b>
<br><b>she was in there.&nbsp; Her closet has two sliding mirrored doors
and is about 10</b>
<br><b>feet wide.&nbsp; My friend went in on one side and I went in on
the other.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>thought it was sorta colder in the closet than in the rest of her
room but I</b>
<br><b>didn't say anything.&nbsp; Still in my side, I felt someone brush
up agianst me.</b>
<br><b>I could literally feel their cold skin.&nbsp; I asked my friend
if that was her</b>
<br><b>and she said "Yeah what are you doing over here, I thuoght you were
looking</b>
<br><b>in the other side of the closet."&nbsp; I said "I am in the other
side of the</b>
<br><b>closet, you just come over here and touched me."&nbsp; We thought
the other was</b>
<br><b>joking with us.&nbsp; My sister and other friends could hear us
and since we left</b>
<br><b>the closet doors open and their eyes had adjusted to the light,
thes could</b>
<br><b>see that neither of us were even close to one another.&nbsp; My
sister got scared</b>
<br><b>and turned on the light.&nbsp; When my friend and I saw how far
away we were from</b>
<br><b>each other, we got really scared and out of the closet fast.&nbsp;
Needless to</b>
<br><b>say, we quit playing the game.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other things have happened in the new part
of the house, but those</b>
<br><b>can wait.</b>

<p><b>I've already submitted one story (story page 163, very bottom) about
the</b>
<br><b>things which have gone on at my home.&nbsp; In it i mentioned that
i attend a</b>
<br><b>school haunted by a spirit named Emily. Let me explain about Emily.&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>murdered before the school existed and her body was dumped in the
vacant lot</b>
<br><b>which is now my school.&nbsp; And I've FINALLY had an experience
with her, though</b>
<br><b>not many people believe me.</b>
<br><b>It happened last week.&nbsp; My first class of the day was cancelled
due to the</b>
<br><b>teacher's absence.&nbsp; I had an hour to kill before my next class
so i went to</b>
<br><b>the computer lab.&nbsp; The lab is located in Building D, the room
that was built</b>
<br><b>over the spot where Emily's body was found.&nbsp; About 15 minutes
before my class</b>
<br><b>started I left the lab, walked through the campus security section,
and to</b>
<br><b>the C Building elevator.&nbsp; As I rounded the corner and neared
the elevator, my</b>
<br><b>hairs on my arms and neck stood up.&nbsp; It creeped me out.&nbsp;
I pressed the button</b>
<br><b>and waited for the elevator to come down the shaft.&nbsp; It arrived,
the doors</b>
<br><b>opened, and I stepped in.&nbsp; As soon as I did, I got MAJOR chills.&nbsp;
I started</b>
<br><b>shivering and I got goosebumps.&nbsp; I just stood there for a few
seconds, then</b>
<br><b>wondered why the elevator wasn't moving.&nbsp; I finally realized
that I hadn't</b>
<br><b>pressed the button for the 3rd floor (when you don't press the button,
the</b>
<br><b>elevator will not move).&nbsp; I took a step so I could reach the
buttons, but</b>
<br><b>before I pressed it, the elevator started to rise.&nbsp; I said
out loud to</b>
<br><b>myself,&nbsp; "That was wierd."&nbsp; As soon as I said it, something
whispered in my</b>
<br><b>ear,&nbsp; "Just be quiet."&nbsp; I was so startled, i jumped into
the elevator wall</b>
<br><b>and gave myself the biggest bruise I have ever had.&nbsp; I couldn't
wait for the</b>
<br><b>elevator to reach the third floor.&nbsp; When it did and the doors
opened, I flew</b>
<br><b>out into the hall and slammed into the wall.&nbsp; I was trembling,
and the people</b>
<br><b>walking past were giving me funny looks.&nbsp; I couldn't walk cuz
my legs were</b>
<br><b>shaking so bad.&nbsp; And out of all the people I told, only two

<br><b>My Ghostly Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: shanns28@twave.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello. My name is Shannon S. I am 28 years old. My ghostly encounters
started when I was about 12 years old. I always wanted to stay home when
my family went out to dinner or something, so I would stay home with a
friend or alone. One day I was in my bedroom, I slept in the basement,
when I could hear someone upstairs laughing and sounded like children playing.
I was scared to death. I told my grandma about it when she got home, but
noone believed me. Well this went on for somewhile and I could hear things
at night when I went to bed. I could hear people laughing and talking and
all. Then it got to the point where my grandmother was hearing the same
things. One day she was in the kitchen and heard someone come in the front
door. She told them she would be right there and when she got there no
one was there. She can also go to bed at night and feel someone breathing
over her. In the same house right after my nephew was born, my sister-in-law
called screaming in the phone that her and my brother needed somewhere
to stay the night. I told them to come to my house and when they got to
my house they had a story to tell. They had been asleep, the rest of my
family was on vacation, when she felt something in the bedroom. She opened
her eyes and she said there was a pair of red eyes starring at her and
a voice saying, "Your baby is crying, you need to take care of him."</b>
<br><b>She awoke my brother and they came and stayed with us that night.
I can remember her saying that they had turned all the lights off in the
house and when me and my hubby got up the next morning to go to work, all
the lights in my grandmothers house were on.</b>
<br><b>My second encounter was at a ex-boyfriends house. I was sitting
in the living room looking out the window. I didn't see anything and then
all the sudden two little girls with bonnets and long dresses appeared
in the yard. They were laughing and playing. I watched them for awhile.
I could feel the fear overwhelm me. I looked again and the little girls
were gone. I mentioned this to my ex-boyfriends mom and she said that two
girls had died out in the yard of some kind of fever years ago.</b>
<br><b>My third encounter was at my husband's moms house. Me and my husband
were only dating at this time and I was sitting in the kitchen. I seen
something black pass in front of my face. I seen this several times. My
hubby's family thought I was crazy. Then one day, his mom seen the same
thing and she knew I wasn't crazy.</b>
<br><b>My fourth and final encounter was at my husband's grandmas house.
He lived with his grandma when we were dating. I used to go there to get
ready to go to work every morning. I was in the bathroom one morning. I
had already washed my hair and I always flipped my heard over to blow my
hair dry. I got my hair blow dried and flipped my head back up. When I
flipped my head back up I could see a man through the mirror, in a wheelchair,
watching me. Well this just totally scared me to death and I took off running
into my hubbys bedroom. I was screaming and he wanted to know what was
going on. I told him what I had seen. He said, "That is just grandpa, he
won't hurt you." I told his mom about it and she said that he used to sit
and watch them fix their hair all the time. I didn't know nothing about
him, because he passed away in 1983. Several times, I was in the house
and could feel a presence there. I could hear things and I also heard several
times the sound of his grandpa's wheelchair coming up the hall. It made
a squeeking noise. I asked one day if people had heard this and they said,"Yes
it is just him coming up the hall in his wheelchair."</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost as a child</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Alarose4@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened to me when I was only about 7 years old (I am 23 now).
I live</b>
<br><b>in Alabama (which if I may say has quite a history of haunting).&nbsp;
During the</b>
<br><b>summer, my Aunt Marie babysat me and my sister.&nbsp; She lived
in an older house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;During this time I recall on a couple of occassions seeing
a little boy.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>was about my age with brown hair and brown eyes.&nbsp; Whenever
I would see him (I</b>
<br><b>was very shy) I would just grin and walk out of whatever room I
was in at the</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; One day my aunt asked me to get some canned corn from
the pantry.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>went into the pantry (it was a huge walk in one) and the little
boy was</b>
<br><b>standing at the end of the walkway.&nbsp; I grabbed the corn and
decided to ask my</b>
<br><b>aunt about it.&nbsp; I asked her (I recall this well) "Ree-Ree,
who is that little</b>
<br><b>boy that I keep seeing? Is he a friend of Anthony's?"&nbsp; (Anthony
is my cousin)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She turned really white and said that she didn't know.&nbsp;
I found out years</b>
<br><b>later (after the house was torn down) that my cousin Angela had
also seen the</b>
<br><b>little boy.&nbsp; She too had asked questions.&nbsp; My aunt never
took it seriously.</b>
<br><b>She thought that Angela was telling little white lies (she was about
13 at</b>
<br><b>the time).&nbsp; But when I asked it scared her because Angela and
I never played</b>
<br><b>together or talked (she was too old to play with me, or so she thought!!)
and</b>
<br><b>she knew that I did not hear the story from her.&nbsp; I suppose
she realized then</b>
<br><b>and there that the house was haunted.&nbsp; My family has a history
of staying in</b>
<br><b>haunted houses.&nbsp; I've often been told of the house that my
mother's family</b>
<br><b>(her, 3 sisters, and 3 brothers) lived in.&nbsp; The story I will
never forget was</b>
<br><b>that one day she (my mother) had come home from school.&nbsp; Since
no one was</b>
<br><b>home she decided to call one of her friends.&nbsp; Well, they were
on the phone</b>
<br><b>and one of the phone lines picked up.&nbsp; Mom mom told her friend
to tell her</b>
<br><b>brother to hang up the phone and her friend said "It's not my brother."&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>mom said "yes it is, I heard him pick up.&nbsp; Tell him to hang
up." The girl</b>
<br><b>then replied, "It can't be my brother, we only have one phone in
the house."</b>
<br><b>Mom said that she hang up the phone and ran outside until my Grandmother
and</b>
<br><b>Grandfather got home.&nbsp; There are many other stories from this
house (which</b>
<br><b>still stands to this day).&nbsp; If you would like to hear more.&nbsp;
I'm more than</b>
<br><b>willing to share.&nbsp; I hope you found this story somewhat interesting.&nbsp;

<br><b>Scarey</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dawnfinch@nii.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I grew up in a house in Bellingham Massachusettes. Actually we moved
there when i had just turned 14. I had always loved ghost stories and horror
movies, even when I was very small, but I never really "Believed" in it.</b>
<br><b>I noticed a "strange feeling" from the first time I set eyes on
the house. It is a very old house, there is even tunnels underneth it.
Anyway I had the feeling of being watched and followed. I was with all
members of my family as we walked through.</b>
<br><b>We moved in shortly after the walk through. At first nothing really
happened until about a month after we moved. Nothingbad just little things,
a light switch going off, missing things then showing up again 5 minutes
after right were they were put.</b>
<br><b>Then when I was about 16 something scarey happened. I had been asleep,
but i was startled awake by someone calling my name. I thought it had been
part of a dream but I was wide awake at this point. Again someone said
my name in just above a whisper. I looked at my clock which read 2:10 AM.
I thought it was my foster brother neil. But when a third time I heard
my nmae said It was not his voice nor any other member of my family.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I turned on my light and looked into the hallway. No one was
there, and no one could have gone away from my door without being seen
or heard from where my room was.</b>
<br><b>After I moved My room to the 3rd floor more things happened. I would
close my door tight at night and this door had a latch on the handle that
kept the door closed but not locked. Every night that latch would lift
and the door would open a bit, a while later it would close &amp; latch
and I would sometimes hear footsteps in the other room or go down the stairs.
Neil also had similar experiences in that sam room when he slept there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Richmond Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:erthling@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was about 15 (probably in 1973), my family and I moved into
a</b>
<br><b>tri-level in the far west end of Richmond, Virginia.&nbsp; The subdivision
is</b>
<br><b>called Tuckahoe Village.&nbsp; A modern tri-level in a not-so-old
subdivision is</b>
<br><b>a relatively new house and one wouldn't think there would be a ghost
in such</b>
<br><b>a place, but as soon as we moved in, I started seeing what I've
since called</b>
<br><b>"streaks of light".&nbsp; They looked like a thick falling star
streak, only</b>
<br><b>curving.&nbsp; These streaks of light only appeared in the lower
part of the</b>
<br><b>house, which consisted of a den, a bedroom I shared with my 13 year
old</b>
<br><b>sister, a half bath and a laundry room.&nbsp; I never saw anything
on the upper</b>
<br><b>levels of the house.</b>
<br><b>When in the den (located on the front of the house), just out of
the corner</b>
<br><b>of my eye, I would see a whitish streak of light arc into a corner,
or</b>
<br><b>behind a chair, or into the hallway.&nbsp; They were never directly
in front of</b>
<br><b>me, just off to the side, enough to catch my attention and make
me turn my</b>
<br><b>head to try and see them better.&nbsp; They would be on the left
side of the</b>
<br><b>room, or the right... it didn't seem to matter, and eventually,
they began</b>
<br><b>to make me curious.&nbsp; What were they and how was this light
getting into the</b>
<br><b>room?&nbsp; At first I thought it must be car lights from outside,
reflecting and</b>
<br><b>catching my attention.&nbsp; When I would see one, I'd jump up and
run to the</b>
<br><b>window to see if a car had just driven by.&nbsp; There was never
a car.&nbsp; I'd</b>
<br><b>adjust the shades in the room to see if light could possibly get
in around</b>
<br><b>the edges, but I never could figure it out.&nbsp; Eventually, I
ignored them, but</b>
<br><b>I saw them every day and it didn't seem to matter if it was day
or evening.</b>
<br><b>Although they were not directly in front of me, when I turned my
head, I</b>
<br><b>clearly saw the tail end of it disappear behind a chair or around
a corner.</b>
<br><b>I simply had no idea what they were and I couldn't explain them.</b>
<br><b>After approximately two years of daily "streak sightings" in the
den, I</b>
<br><b>began to see them in my bedroom which was located on the back of
the house.</b>
<br><b>This was VERY confusing to me since I could NOT figure out how light
from</b>
<br><b>cars outside would be able to get into my room with only one small
window on</b>
<br><b>the side.&nbsp; I began to think I must be seeing things, since
I didn't see them</b>
<br><b>anywhere else in the house, or in any other place for that matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I kept</b>
<br><b>a parakeet in my room.&nbsp; One night, the bird woke me by wildly
flapping</b>
<br><b>around in his cage.&nbsp; The cage was covered and the room was
dark.&nbsp; We slept</b>
<br><b>with the window cracked and I though perhaps a bug had gotten into
his cage</b>
<br><b>and was bothering him, so I got up, picked up the cage, walked through
the</b>
<br><b>dark bedroom and hallway into the dark den.&nbsp; I didn't check
on him in my</b>
<br><b>room because I didn't want to wake my sister with the light.&nbsp;
As soon as I</b>
<br><b>crossed the threshold of my bedroom, the bird stopped flapping around
and</b>
<br><b>was quiet.&nbsp; Once in the den, I turned on the light, removed
the cage cover,</b>
<br><b>and checked on the bird.&nbsp; He was quiet, seemed fine, and I
was annoyed</b>
<br><b>because he woke me up for nothing.&nbsp; So I covered the cage,
turned out the</b>
<br><b>light and headed back to my bedroom.&nbsp; AS SOON as I stepped
across the</b>
<br><b>threshold to my room, he began to go wild in the cage again.&nbsp;
I remember</b>
<br><b>standing there, in the dark, stepping back and forth, back and forth,
across</b>
<br><b>the threshold of my bedroom and thinking it was crazy.&nbsp; Outside
my room, he</b>
<br><b>would be calm but inside, he would go wild.&nbsp; I had to get some
sleep so the</b>
<br><b>bird would just have to get over it.&nbsp; I put him in my room
and after a</b>
<br><b>minute or so, he calmed down.&nbsp; I have always wondered about
this incident</b>
<br><b>because although it was dark both inside and outside my room and
the cage</b>
<br><b>was covered, stepping across the threshold definitely made a difference
to</b>
<br><b>the bird.&nbsp; What did he sense that I didn't?</b>
<br><b>When I was 18 and soon to be married to my high school sweetheart,
I saw</b>
<br><b>something that would make me realize I'd lived with a ghost for
three years.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My sister and I had just gone to bed and turned out the light.&nbsp;
I remember</b>
<br><b>settling back on the pillow and looking up toward the ceiling.&nbsp;
I was not</b>
<br><b>asleep as I had just put my head down!&nbsp; Suddenly, at ceiling
height just</b>
<br><b>above my feet, an upper torso appeared!&nbsp; It was a woman and
she looked like</b>
<br><b>a 1920's flapper.&nbsp; She even had the little band around her
head, as was the</b>
<br><b>style.&nbsp; I could see her grinning face, neck, shoulders and
upper body very</b>
<br><b>clearly, but nothing below that.&nbsp; Within an instant, she swooped
toward my</b>
<br><b>face.&nbsp; I heard laughter and sensed she found frightening me
amusing.</b>
<br><b>Immediately, to the right side of my face, there appeared a bright,
whitish</b>
<br><b>light.&nbsp; I can remember thinking to myself, "If you think Im
going to turn</b>
<br><b>my head and look at you, youre crazy!"&nbsp; After what felt like
an eternity</b>
<br><b>but was probably only about 10 seconds, the light just faded away.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>whispered to my sister, "Wendy!&nbsp; Wendy!&nbsp; Did you see that!?!"&nbsp;
But she</b>
<br><b>didn't answer so she must have fallen asleep already.&nbsp; I took
a deep breath</b>
<br><b>and thought, "Well...we have a ghost.&nbsp; And if that's the best
you can do,</b>
<br><b>knock yourself out!"&nbsp; I felt angry that the ghost deliberately
tried to</b>
<br><b>scare me.&nbsp; It seems odd, but I felt like it couldnt get much
worse than</b>
<br><b>that, and it didn't kill me, so I turned over to face the wall and
went to</b>
<br><b>sleep!&nbsp; I told my mother about it in the morning and asked
her if shed ever</b>
<br><b>seen anything, but she hadnt.&nbsp; I dont think she really believed
me.&nbsp; After</b>
<br><b>that night, I never saw the ghost or any streaks of light again.&nbsp;
I moved</b>
<br><b>out shortly after this incident.</b>
<br><b>Years later, my husband and I bought a house in the same neighborhood
just</b>
<br><b>up the street from the haunted house.&nbsp; During a yard sale one
day, I</b>
<br><b>happened to meet some people who lived there!&nbsp; I casually asked
them if they</b>
<br><b>had ever seen any strange lights in the den, but when they looked
at me like</b>
<br><b>I had two heads, I let it drop.</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I believe in ghosts but to my knowledge have never seen one until
recently.</b>
<br><b>My father passed away suddenly in February 2000 from a lethal arythmia
(it effect the lower part of the heart). According to the doctors he didnt
suffer any pain and didnt know he was dying, it apparently took all of
3 minutes for him to pass away.</b>
<br><b>At first mom and I didnt pay attention to what was going on, but
then it want beyond reasonable explanation. One night my mom went to bed
early she was in there for about 10 or 15 minutes when she came back downstairs.
She told me that dad was upstairs; according to her she had laid down when
she felt the bed shake slightly, then she felt someone lay down next to
her she was ready to jump out of bed when she felt a hand on her thigh.
Whenever my mom was upset my dad would do that to comfort her.</b>
<br><b>I have converted one of the bedrooms into a computer room and it
was a habit of his to go to bed early and every night he would open the
door and poke his head in the room and tell me goodnight and he loves me.
Since his death he still comes into my room to tell me he loves me.</b>
<br><b>Twice I have heard the front door open and close; it usually happens
around 6:00pm when my dad would come home from work. Also on my birthday
I woke up at 5:00am and had the feeling to go downstairs. When I got there
I noticed the fan on; this is Michigan in the middle of winter here there
is no reason for the fan to be on. I figure it was my dads way of saying
Happy Birthday.</b>
<br><b>There is a message on the answering machine from my dad, a month
after he passed. Actually he is kind of singing "I outta go". Ironically
my mom had been singing just a little while before and in the song she
sing "I outta go".</b>
<br><b>There are so many other things that have happened since he passed
but I will end the story here.</b>

<br><b>Little Boy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: njeffrey@carmike.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; First of all I'd like to say that I really enjoy reading all
of the</b>
<br><b>stories on this site and I enjoy this site very much. Anyway, here
is my</b>
<br><b>story.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Ever since I was about 4 or 5, I can remember having many
expierences</b>
<br><b>that I can only say were ghosts. My first sighting happened around</b>
<br><b>Christmas when I was very young. We lived in an older house that
was quite</b>
<br><b>small but not to small. I was asleep one night and for some reason
I woke</b>
<br><b>up and looked towards my door which looked into the kitchen and
I saw a boy</b>
<br><b>about my age ride up right in front of my door on a scooter and
stop and</b>
<br><b>look right at me. Of course I was not scared because he was a little
kid</b>
<br><b>just like me and he looked perfectly human. So he just looked at
me for a</b>
<br><b>couple of seconds and then turned towards the living room, and as
he</b>
<br><b>started to ride off I said " Hey wait! That's mine.", just to see
if he</b>
<br><b>would stay and talk to me, but he rode off into the living room
and I</b>
<br><b>jumped out of bed to follow him and when I got into the living room
he was</b>
<br><b>gone. Now there was no where else for him to go because the kitchen
and</b>
<br><b>living room were side by side. I remember the Christmas tree still
lit up</b>
<br><b>with lights and he was no where. I went into my mom's room and he
wasn't</b>
<br><b>there. At that time I didn't think about things like ghosts in my
house</b>
<br><b>that looked like little boy's only scary ghosts that would attack
me in my</b>
<br><b>sleep or something like that so I didn't say anything about it.
But a few</b>
<br><b>years later I realized what I saw that night was indeed a ghost.
Many other</b>
<br><b>things happened in that house that my mom has told me about but
thats</b>
<br><b>another story.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The next expierence I had was in the house we lived in after
that. After</b>
<br><b>we moved from that other house we moved into this cute house that
was again</b>
<br><b>quite small but not to small. Any way, my room was at the end of
the hall</b>
<br><b>and I could look out of my room into part of the kitchen and part
of the</b>
<br><b>living room. On several occasions I would wake in the middle of
the night</b>
<br><b>and for some reason I was just frozen with fear of something in
my room or</b>
<br><b>something that I just can't explain. I would just lay there for
hours</b>
<br><b>scared stiff trying to hide under my covers but then again I wanted
so hard</b>
<br><b>to scream for my mom but nothing would come out. Most nights I would
try so</b>
<br><b>hard to scream and I would get so scared wanting so badly for my
mom to</b>
<br><b>come rescue me that I would wet the bed and at that time I would
fianally</b>
<br><b>be able to somewhat call for my mom. I acn't explain what I felt
becuse I</b>
<br><b>never saw Anything but I knew that something was there and if I
got out of</b>
<br><b>bed something bad would happen. My mom said that one night in that
house we</b>
<br><b>were all asleep and she and her boyfriend woke up when they heard
a loud</b>
<br><b>crash. They went into the kitchen to find that the chair in the
living room</b>
<br><b>was flipped over into the kitchen and the stuff on the kitchen table
was in</b>
<br><b>the bathroom floor perfectly arranged like it was on the table.
Like the</b>
<br><b>other house I have other stories to tell but I'll wait until another
time.</b>
<br><b>I'd like to end by saying that most of my childhood I expierenced
some kind</b>
<br><b>of phenomenon like I said that I can only attribute to being ghosts.
Thanks</b>
<br><b>for listening.</b>

<br><b>Haunted?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rodman@lamere.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm really not sure why I'm writing to you. I thimk my house may
be haunted but Im not sure. I think that I've always loved ghost and ghost
stories and Im probaly the most bravest of all of my friends. The reason
Im not sure why Im writing to you is because if you answer and give some
clues on how to really find out if your house is haunted then I may see
a ghost and then I wouldn't be able to live in my house anymore. Ok so
now Ill tell you why I think my house is haunted.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was my 12 birthday and there was
about 10 little 12 year old girls running around my house. It took awhile
but they all commed down and we decided to play a really scary game called
Vinnty Lord. We didn't think it would work but it did. We tried it about
15 times with about 5 different girls. When we were about to give up my
friend decided she would be the victum.</b>
<br><b>She layed in the middle of the floor and we all stood around her.
We decided to contact alittle girl that lived in my house about a hundred
years ago. When we finished Sally(name changed to proctect her) opened
her eyes and they were all bloodshot. I couldn't believe it. My other friend
Michelle(name changed also) started asking her questions. We were all so
freaked out. My friend Michelle is a ghost freak,who's idea in the first
place, got really scared after asking her a few questions. We couldn't
understand what she was saying because she was whispering but we treid
our hardest. We think she said that she was stangled but were not sure.
When Sally woke up she was crying and said that she couldn't feel her body.
It&nbsp; was really scarey.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since then I know that something is
in my house. When our woodstove is going and its really hot in the house
you'll go into a corner and it'll be freezing. And there are footsteps
in the middle of the night when were all sleeping.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was also at my best friends birthday party-not long after mine- and we
deciced to play Vinntey Lord again. Sally decided to be the victum again
and Michelle was the one in charge. It worked again and we all got freaked
out again. About and hour later while we were outside cheering I had this
image in my head. I really didn't think anything of it so I just kinda
blew it off. But they kept coming. Looking for an answer I went to Michelle(we
tried to contact her grandmother) and asked her what her what her grandmother's
house looked like by the images in my head and they were all right.I had
guessed what her grandmothers house looked like when she died about 5 years
before and Michelle lived in a different state when she died!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting in Utah</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sk8achase@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a true story about a place that is haunted in&nbsp; Ut, on
the 13th of</b>
<br><b>October, It is at a friend of mines house, we were playing one night
at we</b>
<br><b>decided to record EVP in one bedroom that a person has died of old
age</b>
<br><b>sleeping, we already knew the place was haunted because of deaths
in the</b>
<br><b>house and the things that happen such as: the faucet in the kitchen
turning</b>
<br><b>on for no reason, it really turns on, we stuck a bowl under it empty,
and in</b>
<br><b>the morning it was half full of water, also down in the basement
the closet</b>
<br><b>is big and long, it is a dark place, we suspect a haunting going
on because</b>
<br><b>the hangars go back and forth frequently, and another thing is that
the house</b>
<br><b>is from the 1800s, very old, probably mid-1800s. So we decided to
record EVP</b>
<br><b>in the bedroom and the closet, and various places in the house.
Not even</b>
<br><b>thinking what we were getting into we started recording in the bedroom,</b>
<br><b>asking for a name, how the ghost died, and how long has the ghost
been there,</b>
<br><b>then we went to other rooms to record and we asked various questions.
We</b>
<br><b>played the tape back and the first question was, "What was your
name?" we</b>
<br><b>heard a response saying Mable, the same name of their grandma that
died in</b>
<br><b>the house. We heard things on the tape from the closet saying "Get
Away", and</b>
<br><b>"Shhh!!" We decided to stop messing with the recorder and go back
upstairs to</b>
<br><b>play, we started playing when we heard something like the sound
of the</b>
<br><b>hangars going back and forth, so we got really scared and tense,
nobody dared</b>
<br><b>to go near the stairs, then all of a sudden my friend's Mom called
from her</b>
<br><b>work and asked, "What is going on, I have a bad feeling about leaving
you</b>
<br><b>guys all alone." We knew something was going on too, so we went
to the</b>
<br><b>neighbors house across the street to get away, the neighbor didn't
believe</b>
<br><b>us, and thought we were scared for no reason, but she took us in
anyways, and</b>
<br><b>said, "I am going to call your Mom," to my friends. Then I looked
outside and</b>
<br><b>all the lights in the house were off!! I know we didn't turn any
lights off,</b>
<br><b>so I decided to go in the house all alone, because nobody dared
to follow,</b>
<br><b>and the door was locked!!!&nbsp; Then their Mom came home, and unlocked
the door,</b>
<br><b>our neighbor told her about how we were scared and came over, she
didn't</b>
<br><b>believe us either, this is a true story and we were not exaggerating,
I am</b>
<br><b>still scared to go in that house, that was one night I will never
forget.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Odd Or Common</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:jarritt12@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is a very odd story to me, but some people that Ive talked
to say it</b>
<br><b>is really common. I had a twin sister that died when we were 16.
I was driving and she was</b>
<br><b>riding with me and we had a wreck. I blamed myself for her death
for a long time. About a</b>
<br><b>year after she died, I woke up to see her sitting on the corner
of my bed. She was holding</b>
<br><b>onto her head and motioning to a picture of our youngest sister
that was on my bookshelf.</b>
<br><b>Then she disappeared. I thought I was dreaming and went back to
sleep. The next day,</b>
<br><b>our sister, the one she had motioned to, fell on the bleachers at
school and cut her</b>
<br><b>head. She was OK, but the whole experience had me shook up. When
nothing else strange</b>
<br><b>happened, I managed to put it out of my mind.. However, when I was
packing my things to</b>
<br><b>go to college, I had another strange experience. I looked up from
the box I was</b>
<br><b>packing to see my sister standing beside my door. She grabbed her
chest and grimaced and</b>
<br><b>then disappeared, but on the floor where she had been standing lay
a picture of</b>
<br><b>my grandfather. I remember that picture well because it was in the
front page of my photo</b>
<br><b>album. Heres the weird thing. I had packed that photo album at
least a week before in the</b>
<br><b>bottom of a box. Its possible that the picture had fallen out,
but where it was laying,</b>
<br><b>right in front of my bedroom door, I think I would have noticed
it sometime before this. When</b>
<br><b>I got the album back out, that picture was missing. Two days later,
my grandfather had</b>
<br><b>a heart attack and died. I couldnt keep m self from thinking that
my sister was</b>
<br><b>telling me things from beyond the grave, although I had never believed
in ghosts. She repeated</b>
<br><b>these appearances several times, once appearing with a candle and
speaking my</b>
<br><b>aunts name the same night that my aunts home burned down. No one
was hurt, and my aunt</b>
<br><b>claims that she woke up that night after having a strange dream
about my sister.</b>
<br><b>She jerked awake and realized that there was smoke in the room.
That was the first time</b>
<br><b>anyone else in my family claimed to ever dream about or see Laura,
my sister, besides</b>
<br><b>me. I never told anyone that Id seen her, because my family is
very sensible and would have</b>
<br><b>thought that I was nuts.</b>
<br><b>Then, in my freshman year of college, I was going home after a party,
and I</b>
<br><b>saw her again. Just as I had gotten into my car, I looked over to
the passengers</b>
<br><b>seat and there she was. She looked at me and kept shaking her head
sadly, motioning with her</b>
<br><b>hands for me to give her my keys. I didnt know what she was trying
to tell me, and she</b>
<br><b>disappeared so quickly that I didnt have much time to think about
it. I was slightly</b>
<br><b>shaken as I pulled out of the driveway and started home. Let me
clear up that I was not drunk. I</b>
<br><b>had not had anything at all to drink that night. I was going around
a curve and my tire</b>
<br><b>caught the edge of the pavement. I tried to correct it, and from
what Ive been told, the</b>
<br><b>car ran off the other side of the road and into a ditch. It flipped
several times and threw</b>
<br><b>me out, somehow coming to rest with its hood on my shoulder. I
almost died and</b>
<br><b>nearly lost my arm. I know now that Laura was trying to warn me
not to drive.</b>
<br><b>One of my aunts said that the night I had the wreck, she thought
she saw a</b>
<br><b>girl that looked just like Laura walking down the sidewalk in front
of her house. She</b>
<br><b>almost went to speak to the girl, but changed her mind. When she
turned from the window</b>
<br><b>and went back into the kitchen, there was a picture of me hanging
on her</b>
<br><b>refrigerator. She had never had a picture of me hanging there, and
no one in her family had put it</b>
<br><b>there. Since then, my Guardian Angel sister has visited many people
in my family</b>
<br><b>to herald both good and bad news. I think that she is still just
like she was in life,</b>
<br><b>always watching out for those that she loved</b>

<br><b>My Two Uncles</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: patricia_ruiz@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I already shared a couple of my experiences but as I read along other's
experiences, I remember things that happened to me or family members. Back
in '95, my step sister, myself, and a family friend went to the store and
bought an ouija board. This was suggested to my step sister and I by the
family friend. So, we did, I was kinda weary of the idea because I did
believe in the power of the board because of the fact that my great uncle,
who is a pastor of a church told me of his bad experience with a board
before he became a pastor. He said that the board predicted that he would
be a minister by the way. He said that the board predicted every question
that he and his friends asked of it including what would become of their
lives how many children they would have and things like that. He says that
is the way that the spirit you have contacted gets you to trust it and
invite it. He said that once the spirit was invited, it didn't want to
leave. My uncle lives on a mountain in Hazard, KY and outside of his house
once you pass the gravel and the paved road, there is nothing but woods
and wilderness, he said that ultimatly, they threw that board out there
there's nowhere for it to go but down cause he lives on the mountain. He
said that the next morning, that board was on his front porch. That's why
I had that weariness about buying a board but we scrounged up the twenty
dollars to get it anyway. Well, thank God we were unable to contact any
spirits good or bad, I guess we were too nervous and giggling to get the
right atmosphere for it. But, I kept the board under my bed so that my
mother wouldn't see it, she probably would have started crying at the sight
of it. The next day when we took it out to try again (after my mom and
step father left) the damn thing had evil faces on it. There were so many
evil faces on it they were very clear and we could all see them. I couldn't
do anything but cry almost. I took that board and every gladlock trashbag
in my mother's house and just kept wrapping it in bag after bag until the
box was empty. I took that out to the dumpster and threw it in. It didn't
come back thank God. I've never dealt with that ever again and I wouldn't
recommend it for anyone. It can only end up bad. I was blessed and spared.</b>
<br><b>Another incident happened with my youngest uncle Pierre who has
3 daughters. He's 30 and he lives with my grandmother still. One day he
called my grandmother from his job and told her that he had had a bad dream
that a little girl had been hit by a car and she had died. He got home
from work a couple of hours later to find that it was his daughter in his
dream, she had been hit by a car that jumped the curb and killed her. He
was so devastated and he had seen his little girls death in a dream that
night before the day she was killed.</b><b></b>

<br><b>over that time period in six different places I moved to rid us
of that</b>
<br><b>thing. I cannot tell you all of them but to put it short, things
like strange</b>
<br><b>sounds, voices, a foul smell of rotting flesh, objects being moved
and seeing</b>
<br><b>the apparition in two-forms. I will give two incidents for an example.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; At the peak of it's power in 1994 I had gone to bed and slept
very restless</b>
<br><b>due to all that had happened. Around three am I was awakened by
the terrible</b>
<br><b>smell which engulfed my face making me sick. I got up and looked
around then</b>
<br><b>I saw a dark form without a distinct shape in the hall I shut my
door and got</b>
<br><b>back in bed leaving the light on. Soon I finally dozed off and just
as I did</b>
<br><b>something kicked my right foot which had been hanging off the bed
and knocked</b>
<br><b>it back onto the bed. I jumped up in surprise and realized I had
not imagined</b>
<br><b>the pain that now shot through my right foot. Three days later I
went to the</b>
<br><b>doctor my right foot had a perfect triangle shaped bruise right
where I had</b>
<br><b>been hit by that thing. It was in the arch.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My daughter also woke up that
morning with strange scratches on her</b>
<br><b>legs and body. She left after that to stay at her mom's.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The next interesting incident was of the two forks
on the counter. It was</b>
<br><b>a few weeks after the bruise. I had cleaned up the kitchen and laid
two forks</b>
<br><b>on the counter side by side instead of putting them up. As I turned
to walk</b>
<br><b>out of the kitchen I heard a metal to metal noise behind me. I turned
around</b>
<br><b>and saw that the forks were now crossed into the shape of a crucifix.
I</b>
<br><b>called my daughter in to show her and fixed them back the way they
were. I</b>
<br><b>told her lets see if it will do it three times like it did with
many other</b>
<br><b>"tricks"</b>
<br><b>We walked out into the hall adjacent to the kitchen and heard the
noise of</b>
<br><b>silverware moving. It sent chills down my neck. When we went back
in there</b>
<br><b>the forks were crossed again only they were like the shape of a
crucifix. I</b>
<br><b>checked them for magnetism and they were not. So I placed them back
on the</b>
<br><b>counter top side by side this time we had to wait a few seconds
longer when</b>
<br><b>we heard the now familiar noise come from the kitchen. My daughter
began to</b>
<br><b>cry as we saw the same shape again made by the forks and by an unseen
force.</b>
<br><b>I fixed them back again and they remained untouched all night after
the three</b>
<br><b>times forming the cross. My daughter left and I sat up all night
hearing</b>
<br><b>knocks raps and a voice imitating my daughter from the back of the
house. I</b>
<br><b>had no where else to go and had every light on in the house but
sometimes the</b>
<br><b>lights would go off once around 4 am I woke in total darkness and
was very</b>
<br><b>frightened as I could feel a foul breath on my face.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people have seen this thing. I saw if often
as a dark form but I saw</b>
<br><b>it's face only once round three am. It was not human is all I can
say. I</b>
<br><b>thought God help us. Nine years have passed since this began, shortly
after</b>
<br><b>using the O-board. It has weakened a great deal but it is still
here.</b>

<br><b>Hearing Ghosts as a Child</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: redhotmagma@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello I am a 22 yr. old that still remembers the things
I used to hear in</b>
<br><b>the old farm house I used to live in when I was a little kid. here
is one of</b>
<br><b>the stories.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about 6 yrs old and I got to move up into the
room up stairs that</b>
<br><b>was forbidden to me before I moved up there. No one was up stairs
accept me</b>
<br><b>and the house was before the civil war. The room I got was huge
and the room</b>
<br><b>used to be the old servant's&nbsp; quarters. Anyway write when I
was about to</b>
<br><b>fall asleep I would here somone coming up the stairs and they would
never</b>
<br><b>stop, I just fell asleep to them being scared because no one would
answer</b>
<br><b>when I called out to ask who was there. Every night this would happen
and I</b>
<br><b>would tell my mother and she would just say, "Whatever it was it
won't hurt</b>
<br><b>you, because Jesus is watching out for you." That put my 6 yr old
mind at</b>
<br><b>ease. Then one night I was so currious I got out of bed slowly as
the foot</b>
<br><b>steps were going up the stairs and as soon as I stuck my head around
the</b>
<br><b>door way the foot steps stopped and I saw nothing. I then started
walking</b>
<br><b>back to the bed and they started up again. Then I ran and jumped
on my bed</b>
<br><b>and went to bed scared again. So this kept going on and I finally
got used</b>
<br><b>to them and then I quit hearing them. Years went buy untill I was
about 11</b>
<br><b>and I had a friend, Matt, stay over and he heard the foot steps
and he was</b>
<br><b>all freaked out. I told him to ignore them and they would go away.
Well he</b>
<br><b>stayed over so much that he didn't hear them anymore either. Then
Another</b>
<br><b>kid,Kenny,&nbsp; stayed over while Matt was over and kenny woke
us both up and</b>
<br><b>was holding my M16 water gun out in front of him freaking out asking
what</b>
<br><b>the hell is coming up the stairs. We both told him to ignore the
foot steps</b>
<br><b>and to go to sleep. So two other people heard them so I know it
just wasn't</b>
<br><b>my imagination. I have always been kinda into ghosts ever since
then. I used</b>
<br><b>to go to cemetaries all the time and to freaky abandoned places
to see if I</b>
<br><b>could apot some ghosts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I do think that kids can see more spirits
because they don't have the</b>
<br><b>'reallity' blanket over there heads. I think grown ups just see
things and</b>
<br><b>they just write them off as not being there or just something they
just</b>
<br><b>don't care about. If you have any comments write back I'd like to
hear what</b>
<br><b>you have to say about my story and I enjoyed this web site as well.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Sensitive Children</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: maygirl67@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have a ghost story similar to many of hte ones here at this site.
I'll</b>
<br><b>start by giving a little information. My house was built in the
late 1800s.</b>
<br><b>My family has no knowledge of any deaths in the house. I was raised
to be</b>
<br><b>religious and always rely on God.</b>
<br><b>Ok- on with the story! I have learned that children are especially
sensitive</b>
<br><b>to hte paranormal because of their innocence. When i was about 8
years old I</b>
<br><b>still shared a room with my 2 little sisters (who were 6 and 4 at
the time).</b>
<br><b>Late one night I was awakened by a hand gnetly rubbing my shoulder
trying to</b>
<br><b>wake me. Thinking it was one of my sisters needing a glass of water,
I woke</b>
<br><b>up and asked them what they needed. To my suprise no one was there
but i</b>
<br><b>could not move and still felt a distinct pressure on top of me.
When i</b>
<br><b>looked around my room i noticed something extremely unusual. We
had a little</b>
<br><b>stool below our mirror. Dancing on this stool were three little
spirits.</b>
<br><b>They had wings so i believed them to be our three guardian angels.
I wanted</b>
<br><b>to run to my mom but i couldnt movve. I have no explanation of what</b>
<br><b>happened. I only remember it.</b>

<p><b>i really enjoy this website....my name is keny</b>
<br><b>my house has always had a common visitor so to speak.</b>
<br><b>it started when we first moved in when i was 9 ..we noticed that
we</b>

else</b>
<br><b>there...then the doors sarted to open and close by themselves....it
has</b>
<br><b>been that way for years but never any violent acts from th visitor
or</b>
<br><b>visitors.</b>
<br><b>then my best freind died on feb 29 of this year....about a month
after</b>

<p><b>Freak Out</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: beth_o@co.kandiyohi.mn.us</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi! My name is Beth and have been telling my story to my friends
for many years.&nbsp; I am now 32 and at the time of my ghost experience
I was 9 or 10 years old but it feels like it was yesterday because the
picture of him is so vivid in my head.</b>
<br><b>We (my mom, dad, and two other sisters) lived on a farm place that
we rented from our neighbors and this was in Raymond, Minnesota.&nbsp;
We moved there when I was probably two but I never noticed anything for
quite a few years.&nbsp; Of course a lot of noises you could never explain
but wrote them off to three girls home alone in the country.&nbsp; We raised
Arabians on our farm and had about 10 - 15 horses and we also boarded some
too.&nbsp; So my sisters and I would go riding and in the fall we would
be riding the horses through the leaves and then every so often I could
hear something so would stop the horse and the footsteps would continue
for a few more steps and then stop.&nbsp; So then I would do it again --
ride for a little while and then stop and the same thing -- some footsteps
would continue in the woods.&nbsp; Since all the leaves were off the trees
you could see right through the woods and nothing was there.</b>
<br><b>Then another time that sticks out was when my sister was home alone
and she heard what she described as a whole dresser falling over and crashing
-- she was so scared she just ran to the neighbors, which was not close,
and had them come over and look with her and nothing had been moved.</b>
<br><b>Then finally I saw him.&nbsp; I was going down into the barn to
the tac room to get my saddle and in the barn were many stalls for the
horses to stand and at the end one was a ghost -- I know because he was
there but yet white cloudy looking -- an old man with a long beard and
overalls on.&nbsp; Needlesstosay, I totally freaked out and droped everything
and ran to the house to get my mom and went back and nothing.</b>
<br><b>That was pretty much it besides more noises and then we had to move
to town because my mom and dad got divorced and mom and us girls couldn't
handle all the chores.&nbsp; So we picked a house and moved in and I went
into the basement and in the pantry was a picture of this old man that
the people had left -- he looked exactly like the old man that I had seen
in the barn.&nbsp; Now this is two totally different houses and from the
country to town and not our picture.&nbsp; This, of course, really made
me nervous but for some reason left the picture sit down there and did
nothing with it.&nbsp; As a prank -- we thought -- my girlfriend and I
had told a couple of boys from my class the whole story and they didn't
believe us so we took them to my house to show them the picture.&nbsp;
Well we, my girlfriend and I, shut them down in the basement and the one
boy could see a shadow walking towards him and totally paniced and pounded
on the door to let him out and that someone was coming.&nbsp; We let him
out and he was white as a ghost and ran home.&nbsp; I think that freaked
us out so bad that we never really talked about it again and nothing further
happened.&nbsp; I do think I made my mom take that picture to the garbage
though.&nbsp; It was scary but at the same time I feel lucky to have experienced
it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Philadelphia Alley</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hreid1@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This past summer, my family and I visited Charleston, S.C.&nbsp;
I begged to</b>
<br><b>go on one of the ghost walks, and we went.&nbsp; On the tour, we
passed</b>
<br><b>Philadelphia Alley, and our tour guide said it was no man's land,
where</b>
<br><b>pirates and vagabonds used to go to kill and fight duels since the
law</b>
<br><b>jurisdictions fell short on all sides.&nbsp; My brother wanted so
much to</b>
<br><b>prove the tales of tourists tripping and falling wrong, that my
father</b>
<br><b>allowed him to walk down it at midnight.&nbsp; He was about half
way down,</b>
<br><b>and stepped into the light of a streetlight, and felt the burning</b>
<br><b>sensation of a hand on his right shoulder.&nbsp; He ran screaming
back to our</b>
<br><b>car.&nbsp; Later, at our hotel, we found a burned-in thumb print
where he</b>
<br><b>said he felt the touch of fire.&nbsp; He stupidly went back (in
broad</b>
<br><b>daylight this time) and picked up a piece of the cobblestone street
and</b>
<br><b>carried it with him.&nbsp; For the rest of the trip, he was plagued
by</b>
<br><b>voices, spilled drinks, and his camera was misteriously moved to
under</b>
<br><b>the couch on which he slept.</b><b></b>
