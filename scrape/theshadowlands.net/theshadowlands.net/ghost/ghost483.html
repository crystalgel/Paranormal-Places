<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Tobey hall dorm at the State University
College of Oneonta,
early 90s. I turn the light off in my girlfriend's room and we both see
a young
woman's face taking up almost the entirety of the TV screen. Terrified,
I
turned the light on and the face remained there, at least for another
minute or
so. I think she had blank eyes. I once heard breathing in the room
coming from
a part of the room where there was no person. My girlfriend heard
breathing in
that room almost every night, like someone was standing right next to
her bed.
I'm interested to hear from anyone who has also experienced something
in that
dorm.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Raleigh - Bridge</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>animeblastauctions@msn.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well, I do enjoy your site it's interesting
but this one
story in particular interested me. However the bridge is not in
Raleigh, it's
in the Asheville/Arden area I believe. That's where I was when I was in
high
school at 17 and me and my friend one night while out driving told me
talked
about haunted places and I said I wanted to go to one and he told me
the story
about the bridge. This was ten years as I am 27 now and will try to
rememeber
as much as I can. The story as I was told was that long ago a woman had
thrown
her baby off of the bridge, killing it. She then killed herself (I
don't recall
by way of her death, I want to say she hung herself under it from what
I
recall). I remember it being and feeling somewhat eerie when I got
there, I
then turned off my car and not for very long as I was worried traffic
coming up
behind me and we were with a girl who was freaked out by the whole idea
in the
backseat of my car screaming and crying after I turned off the engine.
I turned
it back on right away to calm her down and I thought it turned on kinda
funny.
Then while leaving my windshield wipers swept across the windshield one
and
when I went to turn them off thinking I accidently hit it with my knee
in all
the yelling from her in the backseat freaking out I then noticed that
they
weren't turned on at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It acted funny
for a minute or two after that (a beep as if a door is open but only
one beep,
etc.). I didn't go back there again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wrote it off as a coincidence but was a little freaked out myself in
the back
of my mind. I just wanted to share that with you, I didn't know that
urban
legand was popular this many years later, noone ever hardly even talked
about
it back then....</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost Experience </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>robzet5@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The experience I have to tell is as follows:
back in the
50's in Cuba (pre-Castro)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother
was out in broad daylight hanging clothes out to dry. Now I must point
out that
she didn't drink, or smoke, was not prone to hallucinations, and was
not
stressed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>out. Also, I was not there so
this is not a first had account. However, this story comes from a
reliable
source, my mother! So anyway, there she was hanging clothes out to dry
when a
friend of the family who had died the a year ago, appeared as clear as
can be!
My grandmother's reaction was to state the obvious: "You're dead!" To
which the apparition replied: "I'm not dead, but ------- is."<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>(the name of both the phantom and the member
of the family to which the spirit referred to is lost to me. My parent
does not
like to talk about such occurrences, so I have not pressed her for
names) My
grand mother's reaction was to look away, shaking her head trying to
take it
all in. When she finally did look back, the ghost was gone. At this
point my
grandmother rushed inside to tell everyone what she had just
witnessed.. Within
an hour a call came announcing that indeed the person mentioned by the
shade
had in fact passed away! I asked my mother when she first told me this
story if
anyone thought the person in question was ill because had that been the
case,
then it's not too hard to picture an active imagination already
anticipating
that person's demise, but that turned out to be the contrary. No one
had any
reason to believe that the family member the ghost talked about had
been sick
much less dying. To this day I have no explanation for this event.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Codynew14@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was (and still am) interested in the
occult. So i ask
permission to be loaned the key to the graveyard to see if i could find
anything. I spent the night in the part of the graveyard dedicated to
my
family. During the night i saw countless shadow people jumping between
tombstones and around the section i was sitting in. At 3:46am i heard a
whisper, It was an eldery woman, my great grandmother i believe, and
she told
me,"don't worry, you're safe here. We won't let them hurt you." I
continued to see things and at am i<span style="">&nbsp; </span>saw
a demonic figure walking towards me and then disappear. I later left
after sun
up and to this day i wonder if my great grandmother was protecting me
in death
as she had in life.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost Story</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>melkorainu@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hello I have a ghost story I would like to
share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This story isn't as intense as
other stories
I've read but it's one of my strongest "hard to think its a
coincidence" one. I was 18 years old at the time of this event and I
currently lived with guardians at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of the family members there have had some dealings with
paranormal
or unexplainable events happen to them inside of that house.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't remember the exact time but I know it
was dark outside, if I had to guess I'd place it around 10-11pm.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was empty except for my friend Rudy
and I who were upstairs in my bedroom sitting around shooting the
breeze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were talking about some kids in
our high
school when the electronic fan I placed in my window made a beeping
sound and
let it's twin fans whirr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both took
note of it but I knew it was just a feature the fan had, once the air
in my
room would get too hot it would turn on for a second or so to cool the
air.
This on and off effect occurred every 40 minutes to an hour so I didn't
think
anything of it at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
noise did make a noticeable pause in the conversation so to get back on
track I
grinned towards my friend and said "Like my Devil fan?".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Right after I said that the fan Beeped again
and let it's fans whirr on for a second, then it turned off again.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>A few things about this made me uneasy, the
fact that it beeped more than what it was accustomed to (and I have
owned that
fan for years before and it always beeped only in 40 minutes to hour
bursts
depending on the temperature outside), how I had said the word
"Devil", and perhaps the most unsettling part was how it beeped in
such a conversational beat with Rudy's and my discussion to follow.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That part stuck to me the most, just how it
didn't beep randomly seconds after we asked it something or interrupt
with a
beat before we finished asking our questions; it was always beeping in
the
perfect time as if something intelligent was talking back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could tell we both felt a little apprehensive
about this but neither one of us wanted to let the other know we were
uneasy so
we shot each other sheepish grins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rudy
chuckled and said "Ohh man! Hah hah, maybe somethings trying to talk to
us" Beep! Whirrrrr Still keeping up with this uneasy game I jokingly
asked
"Is something actually there?"Beep! whirrrr Rudy and I looked at one
another not quite believing this was happening to both of us and we
were
hearing the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Feeling more
uneasy about this I tried to laugh it off and joked to Rudy "I think
whatever it is, it's going to get you Rudy".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dead
Silence from the fan. A very frightening
feeling came over me and my smile curdled on my lips as I got the
impression
that whatever was controlling the fan was thinking "No.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Guess again"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend Rudy noticed
the silence--and I later
found out felt the same impression from it's refusal to answer my
statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rudy, very serious and calmly
said,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No, not me; it's going to
get you [me]; confirm that your going to get Josh" Beep! Beep! Beep!
Whirrrrrrrrr! Rudy and I sat up straight looking at each other shocked
and in
disbelief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rudy let out a scared yell
and we got up to run out of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
we were running the fan went hay wire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fans stayed on and the electronic beep was going off like an
alarm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It felt that whatever it was, was
laughing at us maliciously and the beeps beat kept that tempo.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It kept beeping and we could hear it go for
another half a minute or so from where we were listening downstairs.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We kept our ears strained for any more noise
and a few moments later heard heavy footsteps walk around directly
above us (my
room was also directly above us).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
wanted to leave so we gave ourselves a pep talk and charged upstairs to
grab
our shoes and phones. Nothing happened there and I strode to the fan to
unplug
it. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I remember standing there hands
clenched and trying to not let fear creep into my voice said in a stern
and
commanding voice, "I don't know what you are, and I mean no disrespect
by
unplugging the fan, but you do not own this home and you will not make
yourself
known to me anymore".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We still left
the house that night and I've continued to have other experiences but
none were
as convincing to myself as the one with my friend and the fan.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I Thought That was What Happened to Me</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>angelad@celluphone.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hello Everyone. My name is Angela. I have had
many weird
things happen to me throughout the years starting when I was around 5.
What had
happened to me then has stayed with me my whole life and I always
wondered did
that really happen to me or was it my little kid imagination. Well when
I
turned 26 I got the confirmation I was looking for. Ok the story. When
I was 5
me, my mom, dad and little brother lived in a 2 flat. Below us lived my
moms
brother, his wife and my 3 cousins. I would hardly ever sleep in my
room, when
it was time for bed I would go in my bed and wait for everyone to sleep
then
sneak my way to living room and sleep on the couch which is located
closer to
my parents room. I just felt safer. One night I woke up for some reason
(on the
couch) when to get up and something grabbed me by my ankles and was
dragging me
under the couch. I was screaming at the top of my lungs. Finally my
parents
woke up, flicked on the lights and found me halfway under the couch
gripping
onto the rug. They asked me what I was doing and I told them I fell
because I
don&#8217;t think they would have believed me. From the age of 5 till 26 I
thought of
it off and on trying to figure out what happened that night. Well I got
my
confirmation at my cousins wedding. The cousins that lived downstairs
from me
in the 2 flat were there and we all sat at the same table. Out of the
blue my
cousin asks me if anything has every happened to me in the 2 flat. I
just
looked at him and said are you serious. I asked him to tell me what he
experienced first. He said that at night he would hear noises outside
his
bedroom and one night he peaked out of his door and saw a dark shadow
figure go
from the bathroom down the hall and right through the back door that
lead
upstairs to our apartment. I then told him what happened to me and
right there
and then I knew I wasn&#8217;t dreaming.. I finally have closure to that
story. I
have LOTS of stories to tell but will split them up. My family has a
history of
hauntings going all the way down to my great grandparents. Thank you
for
listening.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This is an experiance that happened to me
about five years
ago, I was working in the gym at a hotel in moodiesburn near glasgow.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One night i was getting ready to leave for
the night, the route i had to take was down a dark corridor to the main
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was a walk I had made many
times and had never had any problems but this night as i was going
along i felt
like i was being watched, as i got to the end of the corridor i turned
to close
the door when i saw what looked like a white shape running towards me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say i closed and locked the door
very quickly and sprinted to the bus stop outside the hotel.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The next night I was working again and
decided to see what could have caused it, I went through every
possibility i
could think of from car headlights to interior lights but nothing
reccreated
what i had seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About two days later I
was looking through the old accident book when i found an entry from
three
years before, a man was running on the treadmill and died of a heart
attack
whilst using it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was interesting
was it was the same date and time i saw what i saw</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Here is my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
house is 6 years old and has never been lived in by anyone else.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This started about 2 months ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am lying in my bed alone with the door to
the hall and the door to the bathroom open. I swear I see the door open
a
little bit and then go back to where it was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I will see black figures with little or no shape appear in the
doorway,
then woosh, they are gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will also
see what looks like people I know, who will stick their head in the
door, then
turn and leave.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Last night I was
asleep
when I felt something nudge me 2 times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I woke up to see this black form standing beside me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It stood there for about 2 seconds, then
vanished out the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These figures
have no legs. The are just a black oval shape with no faces or arms.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Just a black form. Last night was the first
time it really scared me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt like it
was the Grim Reaper asking me to follow him.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A Boy Ghost?</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>invershecky77@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This happened to a friend and I back in the
mid 60's, when
we were 12 or 13 years of age each, and we were camping with our Church
group
and while we had some "free time", Alan and I (I as in Mark) decided
to do some exploring on our own, so we set off towards the perimeter of
the
park where we found a fence (that we could squeeze through) surrounding
the
park property, and bordering some large open cow pasture land was a
grove of
trees right smack in the middle of it. We set off across the pasture
land
towards the grove of trees and much to our delight (for it was a hot
day), we
found a meandering stream in the grove of trees that was about 6 feet
deep and
about 6 feet wide and it wandered all throughout the grove, but to our
dismay,
Alan and I realized that we were wearing Blue Jean pants and a T-shirt,
and had
not brought along our swimsuits, since we were not planning on going
swimming
until later, when the springs in the park was less crowded, so we had
nothing
to wear to go swimming at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
Alan convinced me that there was nobody around to see us, and we could
go
swimming like they used to do in the "old days", by going swimming in
the nude, or "skinny-dipping", and nobody could tell we had nothing
on, once we were in the water, and not wanting to be labeled a coward
(or
chicken) by my friend, I quickly got undressed and we dove into the
cool
water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We swam around in the water for
about 15 minutes when we were startled to see a young Boy, about our
age,
dressed in some dusty old-fashioned looking overalls, and bare-foot,
staring at
Alan and I from the bushes, and even though he probably saw we were
both
"skinny-dipping" (by our clothes hanging from the bushes), neither
Alan or I felt embarrassed about it, (after all, of us were Boy's), and
Alan
got bold, but staying in the water, Alan said "Hi" to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Boy came out of the bushes, but didn't
get near the banks, and he looked at Alan and I and said "Hi" back,
and we asked him if he wanted to go swimming too, and the Boy said,
"No,
he couldn't swim very well, but could we come out and play?", and we
said
"Sure", but just as soon as we started to crawl up the crumbling
banks, the Boy just stepped back about 5 feet and disappeared before
our very
eyes, just kind of blinked out of sight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alan and I did not wear glasses and our vision was perfect, and
we were
looking straight at the boy as we climbed out of the stream, and like I
said,
the Boy just disappeared before our very eyes, just kind of blinked out
of
sight, and Alan and I quickly got into our Jeans and looked around for
him, but
he was nowhere to be found in the bushes, and if he wanted to play with
us, why
did he disappear?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if he had left the
grove of trees (which he didn't), we would have seen him in the wide
open
pasture land, and afterwards we talked about our experience between us,
but
Alan and I didn't tell anyone of this, knowing that no one would ever
believe
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alan and I both wondered later, if
the Boy might have fallen in the stream from the crumbling banks and
drowned in
that stream many, many years ago, and as the kids our age wouldn't be
caught
dead wearing old-fashioned looking overalls, when all of the kids we
knew were
wearing the latest looking fashions, was it even remotely possible that
perhaps
Alan and I saw a Ghost that day, one who was lonely and just wanted to
play?</big></p>

</span>yellowfire2@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My fianc&eacute;, our doggies &amp; I moved
into an apartment in
Huntington Beach California in August of 09. It is now January 2010.
After two
months of living there red &amp; green crayon marks would appear in
different
sections of my living room on the walls. It looks as if &#8220;someone&#8221;
grabbed
several red &amp; green crayons and made a short dash across the wall
with
them. Once a month I would notice a new one on a different wall. At
first I
thought it was the dogs. I thought that maybe they were playing with
something
that ran across the wall but I have never bought them a toy that would
in any
way damage anything in the apartment. Then I thought perhaps my
fianc&eacute; or I did
it but once I noticed it on a cabinet in the kitchen, I KNOW THAT WAS
NOT FROM
US! First of all, I would have noticed that right away when we moved in
because
I am always cooking or baking second of all, after looking at all of
the items
in the home, I have nothing that could make those kind of marks. This
morning,
I noticed a new one in our game room. They are all the same for the
most part,
there is one small green mark in a few spots but they are mostly green
&amp;
red. Before today, all markings were in the living room. They are all
pretty
low to the ground, like it is within reach of a toddler. Interesting.
These markings
DO NOT come off! I have tried many different methods of cleaning and
they will
simply not come off/ rub off, scrape off&#8230; nothing! I must mention that
on one
occasion, I was getting ready for work &amp; the dogs were in the
living room
playing when I heard this bark that I did not recognize. My dogs kinda
freaked
out a bit and ran around barking looking to see where that other bark
came
from. I am not too sure where that came from but it was an interesting
little
event. Let&#8217;s see what comes of these markings&#8230;</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I worked at Dowling as a janitor for a year.
My shift was
overnight, and for three months I worked that shift alone. I never saw
a purple
orb, but I didn't spend a lot of time outside. What I can tell you is
that
after the creepiness of being in a big building all alone wears off,
there are
still sounds and such that can't be explained by me. Every week, if not
every
night, doors would open and close by themselves. I and the others would
go chasing
these noises, thinking there was someone in the building, but of course
there
was no one there, or I wouldn't be writing to you. And the security
company
wouldn't call to say an external alarm went off; so there couldn't have
been
anyone there. Sometimes we would be in the library and we'd hear one of
the
counselors' doors (the library was the same room, but divided by office
walls
from the counselors' area) open and close. Sometimes classroom doors
would. At
times I'd be in the gym and would chase the sound of footsteps. The
place does
make a lot of building noises. It's difficult to report on anything I
heard in
the auditorium (the creepiest place in the school) because the roof and
heating
system would collaborate with the big empty space to make many
mysterious
noises that could be too easy to explain away. Plus, the auditorium was
creepy
because it was always dark until I would clean it, and there were so
many
access areas, such as backstage, or the lighting area above, the stage,
and the
several doors, that would really just make me paranoid. Having said all
that, I
did sometimes get transfixed on the idea that an emaciated, naked woman
was
watching me. I only got that feeling in or around that particular room.
It
makes no sense to me, but I did avoid it. The band room was also a
little
creepy. I would sometimes take my lunch there so I could listen to the
radio,
and the doors within would make noises like they were opening and
shutting.
There was one definitive time that I also can't explain. I went into
the
library and locked the door behind me, because I was hearing so many
noises
around that door that night. Then I climbed over the wall to the
counselors'
area and unlocked that door so I could rush through it when I heard the
noise.
Sure enough, the library door tried to open, because I heard the
deadbolt hit
the doorframe. So I ran to the hall and listened for footsteps, but
there were
none. I ran to look down both north-south halls along the library, but
there
was nobody, and there was nowhere to hide. I didn't think someone
could've
gotten away like that without making enough noise for me to hear it. A
similar
tale happened one night when all three of the overnight janitors were
in there.
We heard the noises in the counselors' area, so I climbed the wall
while the
other guys went to the doors, but nobody was there. I want to reassure
you of
two things, even though these aren't really the most impressive tales.
First, I
don't really believe in ghosts. I'm open enough to the idea, I guess,
but anytime
I heard a noise, I would go looking for somebody, because I assumed it
was an
intruder. There were times we had intruders, and times people who had
rights to
the building were found. However, there were so many times that we were
sure
there were noises, and so little chance for whoever was making them to
escape,
and we still found nothing, that I thought you might be interested to
hear the
story of Dowling from someone who was there for a long time. Second,
the
building stopped creeping me out by itself about a week after I was
working
there alone. I heard noises, and chased them, but the air unit, the
building
settling, and other normal noises stopped giving me the jitters by the
time
they became normal for me. I don't really believe in ghosts, but I saw
the
purple orb listed on the website after a night of chasing these noises,
so I
decided to write this to you. Albeit two years after the fact. Two
creepy
stories about the place from a source that I'm not sure I trust: One
time, he
saw people in robes walking into the woods west of the building. One
time, a
girl was raped in the auditorium. A funny, unbelievable, but true story
from
the overnight shift: Ninjas attacked the school one night and put one
of the
soccer goals in the atrium. The kids did this for their homecoming
prank. They
seriously climbed onto the roof of the school with two of the school's
regulation-size soccer goals, and dumped them into the atrium. I chased
off a
bunch of the kids when they were trying to get on the roof a third
time. They
were all dressed like ninjas.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When my husband and I were first married, we
lived in an old
farmhouse where a woman named Jessica had died. When we moved in, there
were
shades, curtains, and blankets tacked over the windows. The woman had
been very
afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were many weird things going
on there, which I won't go into here. But the final straw was when I
was
painting old iron bedsteads white in an upstairs bedroom and found a
message
one morning written with the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>white paint
on the green carpet stating " I HATE YOU".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
couldn't afford to leave right then, but
we gone soon thereafter. 34 years after, we would never go back there.<span

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My son and I were avid bikers and used to
take part in bike
races. He always told me to shorten my chain, but I didn't find that
necessary.
He died and it took some time before I felt up to take another trip on
my bike.
When I brought it out I found to my consternation that the chain had
fallen off
the prockets. That should have been absolutely impossible, as nobody
had touched
the bike since I left it. However, I put the chain back and took a
ride.The
next time I brought the bike out to ride the same thing had happened. I
then
remembered my son's urging to shorten the chain and did shorten it. The
chain
has never again fallen off. Could it be that my son from the other side
made
the chain fall off? I believe so.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunted House in Haddonfield</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>hrbarlowm@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I dont want to give my name but I lived a
very old town<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Haddonfield, NJ. It was a
white duplex off of
Warwick Road on Park. Cat would chase "something" all around the
house only to hiss at it up in the corner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would wake around 3 am terrified feeling like something was
staring at
me. Objects were thrown about the house. You could hear people talking
through the
computer speakers when the computer was off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of this took years to escalate when something began throwing
my dog
against my bedroom door. I broke a bottle and screamed at it to
stop..all of
this awoke my dad who was screaming for me to come downstairs (I slept
in the
attic). I didnt see the dog when I left my room.(could it have been
imitating
the dog to scare me?) My mom would hear me going up to my room...when
she
realized it wasnt me. I was no where near the house I was actually 10
miles
away at my boyfriends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hear
rattling in my bedroom closet. Something turned on a strobe light in my
room
around 3 am , it actually resulted in giving me a seizure. We moved out
of
there but my dad was never the same. Im not sure if it is related but
he hung
himself not long after we moved out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
dont know who or what it was but it wasnt happy...sounded like more
than one
person when voices came through the speakers.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ray
and Carol built
a log house on some property they owned way back in the woods in 1984
so they
could be away from everyone. After they had lived in the house for 4 or
5 years
they began to notice some strange things begin to happen. The comodes
would
flush randomly and no one would be in the bathrooms. At night you can
hear
Indian music and chanting. There has been times when a white mist would
go from
one bedroom to another as if looking for someone and the area would
become very
cold. Televisions would be unpluged from the wall when you were
watching it.
Door chimes would ring and no one would be there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are some Indian burial sites on the
property in the back of the house and arrow heads and flint and broken
pottery
has been found by him in the back of the house. Human bones were found
when
they had their driveway bulldozed. They sent them to a univeristy in
Alabama
and were told they were pre-historic and they were reburied where they
were
found. This is 2010 and you can still hear these things happening
according to
them this is a true happening and not a made up story.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was sitting at a red light with my husband.
Nobody else
was there at three in the morning. I saw a bunch of well dressed people
in
church clothes heading towards the city's famous haunted church. The
story was
that a crazed man had came in diring a service and killed everyone
there and
then burned half the church. My husband loooked at me and asked me if I
saw the
people too. I just nodded. He rolls down his window and asks the people
what
they were doing. They look over at us and that's when we saw their
eyes. They
were pitch black with little red dots in them. We were so shocked we
didn't see
the light turn green. They then pointed their fingers at us and
screeched
"it was John. John kills!" We had no idea what this meant, but we
screeched off. I can't get their faces out of my head.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Story</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>peterswk@hotmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have had a few encounters with the
supernatural in my
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought I would relay one of
these events to you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the early 90&#8217;s
my wife and I had moved to a small town in Washington State where I had
taken a
job as a police officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we first
moved to town, we rented a really tiny house for a short time, as it
was the
only thing we could find in town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
soon as a larger home opened up, we jumped at the chance to move.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Our new landlord, a friend of mine who worked
for the city, explained that he was remodeling an old house and it
would be
ready in a couple months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anxious to
move, I agreed to help him finish the place, for no security deposit,
and a
quicker move in date. I worked night shifts, so before work I would
head over
to the house to paint and clean up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
also helped to remodel an upstairs bedroom into a new bathroom.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an old house that had been built in
the late 1800&#8217;s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a two-story
home, and my landlord was in the middle of building an addition to the
ground
floor which would add a laundry room, dining room, and extra kitchen
space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My landlord and his family were
extremely religious people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
attended church &#8220;religiously&#8221; and were very opinionated about their
faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the things that they would
definitely
discount was the existence of ghosts, or anything paranormal.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the family, my landlord&#8217;s father was the
most staunchly religious, and one heck of a cabinetmaker!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On to my experience&#8230; On one of my days off, I
had worked at the home for most of the day by myself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had used a paint sprayer to paint the
upstairs hallway and the stairwell down to the main floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course I<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>got some overspray on the wooden steps of the stairwell, so I
was using
a bucket of water and a rag, to clean it up before it had a chance to
set
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was working my way down the
stairwell, bending over to get each stair, when all of a sudden I felt
someone
grab my butt!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not just a twinge, but a
full hand grab!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could feel the
fingers!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It startled me so much, that I
swung around with my fist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mid-swing,
the thought occurred to me that it might be my wife sneaking up on me,
and I
was going to knock her down the steps!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I turned around no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It spooked me enough that I immediately stopped what I was doing
and
left for the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day I told
my landlord about my experience, even though I was a little embarrassed
about
my reaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my surprise he told me
that his dad had experienced a frightening event a few nights earlier
that had
caused him to leave the house and never come back!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently his dad was alone in the house,
and had just finished installing the kitchen cabinets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He left the room for a few seconds, and when
he returned all of the cabinet drawers and doors were opened, even
though he
knew that he had left them closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
scared him enough to leave the house, and to tell his son that he would
not
return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remember, this was the religious
guy who doesn&#8217;t (or didn&#8217;t) believe in this kind of stuff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even though I was a little uncomfortable, we
did move into the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn&#8217;t have
much money back then, and didn&#8217;t have much of a choice at that point.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived there a few years, and my wife and
kids had a few more encounters, usually noises and bad feelings about
rooms and
being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never experienced
anything else in the house, but I think I might have frightened
whatever it was
with my reaction so it left me alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Who knows?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years later a friend
of my daughter&#8217;s whose family lived in the house after we did, shared
with her
some of the same types of experiences we had.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never felt that it was menacing, just a little mischievous.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for listening to my story.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Her Proper Goodbye</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: gnarlycarly12@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My name is Carly and i used to live in a 100
year old house
on the eastern shore in Maryland.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
house was on a street with about 10 other houses all closely related in
shape
and size except my friends. She is my best friend and the man who had
built all
the houses on our street lived in hers. They have never had any bad
experiences
in theirs up until now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friends older
sister came back for thanksgiving and she woke up in the middle of the
night
and saw a form of a giant man. He was leaning over her. She thought it
was her
boyfriend but when she looked next to her, he was sleepin. She didn't
think too
much more about it until the next day where the rest of the family
shared that
they have been hearing and seeing things too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My house was only a few years younger then hers. My parents
bought it at
an auction because the whole thing had to be gutted and renewed. As my
dad was
working on it he was putting in new windows one day and saw a man. He
was
crouched down with his face right up against the wall looking at the
window he
had just put in. The man saw my dad got up and disappeared. I have had
my own
experiences too, like we used to hear someone running up and down the
halls all
night. My room was right at the end and my bed looked out the door.
When the
person got to the end you could hear them turn around and run back.
That wasn't
too bad though, i also remember going into my room and saw a crowd of
people.
They were all sepia colored in trench coats so long you couldn't see
their
feet.. But one looked at my over the collar of his coat, he had bright
yellow
eyes. I didn't go back in the room for weeks, i would stay in the other
guest
bedroom. I had a great-aunt and she was a psychic, i loved her. We had
the
strongest bond you could ever have with anyone. She died of cancer and
it was
terribly hard on me. I ended up with some of her things, like her tarot
cards
but most importantly, her angel cards. I had just gotten these and i
was up in
my room playing with them when I pulled up one card that had a picture
of a
lady on it. This lady looked exactly like my aunt, and she was
surrounded by
animals. My aunt had a basement full of bunnies, birds, fish she had 20
cats
and 5 dogs. The message on the card said, " A message from your loved
one:
I am fine, very happy now. Don't worry about me and don't forget me but
don't
let me overtake your life." then it said goodbye and i love you on it
too,
after i read that I teared up and ran downstairs.. i showed my mom and
she
couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it either, so I got scared and
told my
mom to take the cards out of my room, just in case. My mom put them on
her
dresser they were there about a week or two and then they disappeared.
My mom
never moved them and neither did anybody else. No one had touched them
and they
just vanished, I am for sure that was her final message to me, maybe
not
forever but just so i wouldn't worry. It was her proper goodbye.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Spirit of a Smiling old Man</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>wynnemel1@yahoo.com<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hello. My experience happened when I was in
my late 20's.
Back around late 1994 or early 1995. I was laying in bed asleep. I felt
something touch my face and woke up. I was face to face with a smiling
old man.
He crawled back wards out of my bed and stood there smiling at me. He
looked
like he was causian decent, in his 80's, at least. He had a glowing
light all
around him. He looked like he was at peace while staring at me. I have
no idea
who this<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was. Furthermore, I don't know
why I wasn't afraid of him. I had roomates at the time. I don't know
why I
didn't go running down the hallway to get someone. I just stayed in bed
and
stared at him. I wasn't afraid at all. It was almost peaceful. He faded
away
and I looked at the clock in front of me.It was 3 am in the morning. I
stayed
up a little while and went to sleep. How do you talk about something
like that?
I didn't tell any of my roomates. I did call my best friend and
thankfully she
seemed to believed me. I gave her my rocking chair and she wanted to
make sure
the spirit was not standing next to it. So yes, I think she believed
me. I have
thought about it alot over the years. Trying to figure out who this
could have
been. I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>told my grandmother. She's
Catholic, and thinks it was an angel. I have never met my father, and
have no pictures
of him. So I don't know what he looked like. My mother is Spanish and
French,
and supposedly my father was of caucasion decent like the spirit of the
old
man. So maybe it was the father or grandfather that I never met. Who
knows.
Since then, I have now have a husband and children. I mentioned it once
to my
husband, he looked at me like I was crazy and I am not allowed to talk
about it
again. Anyway, thank you for reading my story.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Strange Sighting</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:janr@whiteearth.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The week<span style="">&nbsp; </span>before
Thanksgiving my son and were emptying out a house that was to be torn
down and
his new one brought in .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
standing by my pickup truck which we were loading and he happened to
look at a
bright light in the sky and said &#8220;Hey look at that<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Is it a plane?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I looked up
and there were no flashing
lights, just looked like a wide set of headlights, no other colored
lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought at first it was a
plane, but no sound for as low as it seemed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It came over slow and headed East and I thought it would
disappear over
the trees like the planes that come over do, but instead it went up and
did so
very quickly until it was a speck that disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Still wonder what it was. Back in 1990, my
husband and I were talking outside out home and happened to look at the
edge of
our 40 acres.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There just above the trees
was a long cigar shaped object that covered the entire line of the 40
acre
parcel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had flashing lights and
looked like windows were along the side of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was reported in the newspapers as a lot of people saw it that
same
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made no sound at all. My son
passed away in August of 2008 and I Have had my grandson say that he
sees him
in my bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find that strange.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Last week he came to me and his mother and
said that there was a man in my bathroom and he need to put underpants
on and
he needed to put his clothes on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
found my son dead he was naked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
grandson did not see him that way the day he died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He looked at a picture and said it was his
Uncle Bob.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He has told me many times
that there are ghosts in my house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE
have heard doors open and close and sometimes the floors creaking. Last
fall I
had gone in my bathroom to turn off the lights the kids left on.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I called out to them thinking that maybe
someone was still in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally
I said loudly and impatiently WHO IS IN HERE?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I heard a voice distinctly say<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;Iam&#8221;, very quietly and clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
did not recognize the voice and thought one of the kids were playing a
joke on
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no one was near the bathroom
which<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is just off my master
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn&#8217;t scare me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There are other strange things that happen at
my house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE hear little kids outside
talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of the time it is
indistinct and you can&#8217;t make out what they say and other times
something comes
in clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We just think the land is
haunted.</big></p>
