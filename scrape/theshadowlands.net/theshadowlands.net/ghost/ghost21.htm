</H3><P><B>by hal@lanplus.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I read Mr. M. and Pepper and wanted to let the writer know that a similar
experience happened to my sister.</B>
<P><B>My sister is an animal lover and has worked at vet clinics for about
three years.  Often she will care for the sick animals in need of overnight
supervision and bring them home to look after their needs.  </B>
<P><B>While I was in Mexico, my sister was watching my dog.  She had brought
home a baby Chihuahua that was very ill and was caring for it with the proper
medicine and supervision.  My dog slept beside the Chihuahua's carrier that
night, being the caring dog that he is.  </B>
<P><B>My sister had gone to bed around 11:00 that evening.  She was sleeping
rather unrestfully until approximately 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. when she awoke with
a jolt.  Her heart skipped a beat or two and as she sat in bed she somehow
knew that the Chihuahua had just died.  My sister remained in bed, afraid
to check on the puppy in the next room because in would sadden her greatly.
 She eventually fell back asleep.</B>
<P><B>The next morning, indeed, the animal was dead. </B>

<H3><A NAME=evil>Evil Spirit</A>
</H3><P><B>by rechelle@millscorp.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>It took me many months before I could recall my experience of the</B>
<P><B>paranormal.  I believe it was because it frightened me so much, that
I</B>
<P><B>subconciously forgot about it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I remember my mother telling me about her strange childhood, and all
the</B>
<P><B>weird thigs that happened in her house.  The focal point of her
stories</B>
<P><B>generally involved her mother. My grandmother was into the occult,
and</B>
<P><B>had no fear in getting involved in some of the scarier stuff.  She
would</B>
<P><B>often tell my mother that when she looked in the mirror, she would</B>
<P><B>sometimes see a beautiful Indian princess.  Cool, so my mother
thought</B>
<P><B>she would take a peek the next time her mom was in the bathroom so
that</B>
<P><B>she could view this lovely princess too.  Instead, when my mom peeked</B>
<P><B>around the door, in the mirror looking back at my grandmother was
this</B>
<P><B>horrible looking monster (demon?).  </B>
<P>
<P><B>After that incident strange things would happen.  My mom had a large</B>
<P><B>teddy bear in the corner of her room (the kind you can win at a fair).
</B>
<P><B>One night, she woke up and the bear had lifted its arm out, as if</B>
<P><B>reaching for her.  Things would also ocasssionally levitate in the</B>
<P><B>house. As scared as she was, she never told anyone, especially my</B>
<P><B>grandfather.  She already had a strained relationship with her dad,
and</B>
<P><B>did not want him to think she was crazy.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I really didn't think much about her stories until I experienced them</B>
<P><B>first hand twice.</B>
<P>
<P><B>During the first incident, we paid a visit (they lived in Ohio and
we</B>
<P><B>lived in NY).  My mother was concerned about my granmother's
continued</B>
<P><B>involvement in the occult.  Well, she thought things were just fine,
and</B>
<P><B>my granfather thought she was just crazy.  Anyhow, just as we were
ready</B>
<P><B>to leave, my grandmother stood on the stairs of her house.  What</B>
<P><B>happened next I couldn't believe. A man's voice came out of her mouth</B>
<P><B>and said that they would find us dead on the highway.  At that time
my</B>
<P><B>parents did not give this incident much thought until a couple of
months</B>
<P><B>later a drunk driver hit us.  Luckily, we all survived.  My mom was</B>
<P><B>injured the worst, with much reconstructive surgery performed on her</B>
<P><B>face.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The second incident I will never forget!!!  Once again, my parents
tried</B>
<P><B>to speak to her about not getting so involved in the occult.  She
still</B>
<P><B>didn't seem too interested in listening, so my parents asked if she</B>
<P><B>didn't mind if the prayed with her.  Well, that upset the spirit so
much</B>
<P><B>that right there, as they were praying she started speaking in the
same</B>
<P><B>voice we had heard just a year ago.  This time evil laughter was
coming</B>
<P><B>from her lips.  My sister and I were so terrified, we ran into the</B>
<P><B>living room, and just crouched in a corner crying.  We could still
hear</B>
<P><B>the spirit's hideous voice from the living room.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, to say the least, this was the last day of our visit.  Once
again,</B>
<P><B>as we were in the car, the spirit once again said that we would all
die.</B>
<P><B>This time my parents told the spirit that this would not happen, and</B>
<P><B>that God is protecting this family.  As we pulled away from the
house,</B>
<P><B>the spirit was cackling and reapeating "you're all gonna die, you're
all</B>
<P><B>gonna die". Never have I been so frightened in all my life.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, to say the least none of us died, and I believe that it was</B>
<P><B>because my parents told the spirit "no".  However, to this day (this</B>
<P><B>happend when I was 7 and 8 years old and I am now 30), I am still</B>
<P><B>somewhat afraid of the dark.</B>

<H3><A NAME=cat>Cat's Farewell</A>
</H3><P><B>by RSGGo@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had a calico cat, Jessica, and she developed diabetes around age
8.  She received daily shots for several years.  One day, however, she became
very ill.  It was late at night, so I took her to an emergency clinic in
the city.  They took xrays and said she was quite ill and would need to remain
with them that evening.  I didn't like the idea of leaving her there, but
she was ill and it was the best thing to do.  I went home and sat and sat
and worried and worried about her. I called the vet and was told I would
be told if there were any news.  So, I continued to sit and worry.  My friend,
Maureen, suddenly mentioned that she thought she heard the mewing of a cat
from outside - yet, at the same time, she said the sound seemed to emanate
from all around her.  She asked me if I heard it. I said no.  Well, just
at that moment the phone rang.  I picked it up.  It was the vet calling to
tell me Jessica had just died.  Both Maureen and I are convinced that the
sound we heard was Jessica letting us know she is all right and out there
somewhere on her way. </B>

<H3><A NAME=life>Life goes on...</A>
</H3><P><B>by sharafj@msn.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I am not sure that anyone will believe this, I am not sure I care.
 It's over. </B>
<P><B> My baby son, my wife and I are alive.  I don't think I can explain
why I am </B>
<P><B>writing this to a bloody web page.  I guess I have to let it out. </B>
<P>
<P><B>It started in September.  We had just closed on our new dream home.
Four </B>
<P><B>bedrooms on a beautiful and peaceful  2 acre wooded lot outside Oxford,
</B>
<P><B>Michigan.  It was a brand new house. One with no history, good evil
or </B>
<P><B>indifferent.  Just perfect for us. </B>
<P>
<P><B>My company had relocated us up from Houston and our housing search
had been a </B>
<P><B>long and arduous one.  Property prices in Michigan are considerably
more than </B>
<P><B>Texas, so when we found this house and decided on it we were relieved
and </B>
<P><B>happy.  I was so relieved that I deliberately did not mention to Katelynn,
my </B>
<P><B>companion and wife that Moshe, the 80 year old builder, told me of
the tragedy </B>
<P><B>that had occurred during the building of the house.  I am an engineer
for a </B>
<P><B>major computer Integration company. Rightsizing scares me, not ghosts,
at </B>
<P><B>least then.   </B>
<P>
<P><B>Two weeks in we started hearing the normal house settling noises. 
A bump from </B>
<P><B>the attic, pops in the walls and sound from the basement that could
be </B>
<P><B>described as squishing or splashing.  Never having had a basement before
who </B>
<P><B>knew what were "normal" basement noises.  As I now think about it,
the first </B>
<P><B>"odd" thing I recollect was that our dog, Blaze, cowered when we heard
the </B>
<P><B>water noises from the basement.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The noises continued but their timing was strange.  Always they started
in the </B>
<P><B>attic, then were heard in the walls and then the sloshing in the
basement...  </B>
<P><B>As I mentioned I am an engineer and I didn't yet mention that my wife,
</B>
<P><B>Kathleen, is a Computer Systems expert, both of these professions don't
allow </B>
<P><B>room for a belief in luck or coincidence.  So of course we started
looking for </B>
<P><B>the structural cause of these noises.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>We pulled up insulation in the attic, I removed drywall, and we practically
</B>
<P><B>camped out in the basement to "catch" the water noise to no avail.
 I called </B>
<P><B>Moshe and let him know that the noises we heard were infuriating and
that </B>
<P><B>there was a severe electrical problem causing the noises.  I thought
about </B>
<P><B>blaming the plumbing but figured the legal liability of an electrical
problem </B>
<P><B>would bring him out to the house quicker.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Of course, he came with an electrician who certified that there was
no </B>
<P><B>ELECTRICAL Problem!  But... as they were leaving they heard the noises.
 Paul, </B>
<P><B>the electrician was from Oxford, and went deathly pale, he spoke to
Moshe for </B>
<P><B>several minutes outside the house on the lawn and left.  He said nothing
</B>
<P><B>further to me and I have not heard from or about him since.  Katelynn
did ask </B>
<P><B>Moshe what the noise was and what Paul's problem had been.  His answer
</B>
<P><B>devastated both of us.  Moshe said that Paul had been in the home building
</B>
<P><B>business at one time and had poured a basement for a house not far
from our </B>
<P><B>home.  The building crew had heard an identical noise coming from the
basement </B>
<P><B>but within hours of the concrete floor being put down.  It disturbed
the men </B>
<P><B>so bad that after two days of the noise they broke through the basement
floor </B>
<P><B>and found a family of raccoon.  Mother and baby's were dead but had
obviously </B>
<P><B>live on for sometime after being buried in concrete.  I guess air get
trapped </B>
<P><B>and they were able to breath for a while.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Moshe's eyes betrayed his thoughts.  So before he mentioned anything
I told </B>
<P><B>Katelynn that there had been a man killed during the building of our
house.  </B>
<P><B>She was not happy with me for not telling her before we closed.  Things
had </B>
<P><B>happened to her as a child that made her more sensitive to these type
of </B>
<P><B>issues.  That's her story.  Katy asked the inevitable and was even
more upset </B>
<P><B>with me after getting the answer.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>A young man, a carpenter, had been working in the house.  This was
before the </B>
<P><B>basement floor had been poured.  He went down into the basement and
started to </B>
<P><B>walk across toward a backwall and had apparently become stuck in some
deep  </B>
<P><B>mud or muck.  He either fell asleep or became unconscious somehow because
the </B>
<P><B>next day concrete was poured in through a tube from a basement window.
 The </B>
<P><B>only way anyone guessed what had happened was when the concrete was
being </B>
<P><B>smoothed part of a hand, fingers rigid, was seen coming out of the
concrete.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Of course, the body was dug up and the basement repaired.  A sick feeling
came </B>
<P><B>over me.  Of course the body was dug up. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Moshe laughed and said you haven't anything under your basement.  Katelynn
and </B>
<P><B>I went inside for our regular hot chocolate.  The house did not feel
the same. </B>
<P><B> The chocolate tasted like hell.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We went to bed at about ten and about eleven, Evan our two and a half
year old </B>
<P><B>woke us by screaming.  He was not in his room in fact he was not upstairs.
I </B>
<P><B>raced down to the first floor and found the basement door open.  Evan
was on </B>
<P><B>the lowest step and in the half light of the basement bulbs it looked
to me as </B>
<P><B>if something had a hold of his right leg and was pulling him.  Katelynn
had </B>
<P><B>followed me down and screamed when she saw Evan.  I was the first to
reach him </B>
<P><B>and for the life of me I could not pick him up.  He seemed to weigh
a 1000 </B>
<P><B>lbs, or else he was being held.  Katy put her arms around him but she
had to </B>
<P><B>lay down on the floor to do so. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Again it could have been the bad lighting but it looked to me as if
Evan and </B>
<P><B>then Katy were lying in the floor, yes in the basement floor, not on
the </B>
<P><B>floor.  I am not sure exactly what I did at that point, crazy thoughts
about </B>
<P><B>dead carpenters and raccoons crashed through my head, but I knew that
they </B>
<P><B>were not going anywhere without me so I grabbed both by and arm or
a leg and </B>
<P><B>pulled with all my might.  I am six three, two hundred and forty pounds
and </B>
<P><B>still I couldn't get them off that floor.  Both were hysterical, Katelynn
</B>
<P><B>never let go of Evan and I never let go of both. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Eventually I felt something give and after a long time or a short time,
I </B>
<P><B>don't know anymore, I pulled at them and both ended up on top of me
on the </B>
<P><B>basement stairs.  We left the house with no clothes or belongings and
went to </B>
<P><B>stay with my wife's family in Warren, MI.  That was a week ago. Evan
and Blase </B>
<P><B>sleep with us now.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I spoke to Moshe a few days after we left the house.  I don't exactly
what I </B>
<P><B>said, something about a flaw in the floor of the basement.  He didn't
believe </B>
<P><B>me, I don't care.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He called me back.  The basement crew came to fix the floor today.
 They found </B>
<P><B>another body.  A women's body.  She had been with the carpenter.  Moshe
said </B>
<P><B>the police said she had struggled a long time under the basement
floor.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am not sure what we will do now, life goes on...</B>

<H3><A NAME=family>Acceptence into the Family</A>
</H3><P><B>by LV72@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a true story that happened to me before I married my husband.
 Everyone on my husbands side of the family always said Grandpa was waiting
for Grandma to die so they could go together to the other side.  He made
several appearances to different family members since his death.  I believed
them, but didn't expect to see him myself.  I often joked that one day my
husband would look at me and see Grandpa with his arm around me in acceptance.
 One night around Christmas time Gram { a nickname} , a family friend, and
I were sitting in the kitchen talking about a recent suicide.  Gram called
to my husband in the next room to ask him a question about the suicide. 
My husband didn't answer.  She called to him again.  Still no response. 
I thought he was being rude, so I called him.  No response!  I walked into
the livingroom and called him and called him.  He was sitting in achair staring
at the Christmas tree.  I looked at him and noticed subtle changes in him.
 My husband is a large man, but the person in the chair was heavier and seemed
shorter.  I also noticed smoke rising from his right hand which I could not
see.  He was also balding alot on top which was weird because my husband
has a thick head of hair.  I continued to call him right up to the chair.
 He looked up at me and immediately his appearance returned to normal.  When
I asked him why he had not answered he replied that he had not heard.  I
then noticed that there was no cigarette in his hand and the smoke was gone.
He could not have put it out without my seeing him.   When I told them what
had happened Gram said " Oh, that was just Grandpa."  I laughed it off. 
 A few weeks later I was helping Gram do something in her room.  I had never
been in there before.  I glanced at her dresser and there was a picture of
Grandma and Grandpa.  I said " Hey, that's who I saw that night!"  Gram said,"
I told you it was just Grandpa."  From then on I knew I was just one of the
family!</B>

<H3><A NAME=visit>Grandma's visit</A>
</H3><P><B>by kwwhitaker@apex2000.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandmother (grandma) lived with my family from the time I was a
baby up</B>
<P><B>until the time she passed away in 1975 at the age of 87. I was away
at</B>
<P><B>college in a town twenty miles away from where my parents and
grandmother</B>
<P><B>lived, when grandma had hip surgery. I was busy with exams at the time
she</B>
<P><B>had the surgery and never made the twenty mile drive to visit her in
the</B>
<P><B>hospital duing the surgery or after the surgery, I thought I could
go see</B>
<P><B>her on the week-end after the exams were over.The last day of my exams,
my</B>
<P><B>mom called and said grandma had had some complications set in after
the</B>
<P><B>surgery and it looked like we were going to lose her. I ran and jumped
into</B>
<P><B>my Volkswagon to rush to the hospital to be with her before she passed
away.</B>
<P><B>Only I never got out of the city limits that day because of an ice
storm</B>
<P><B>which had hit the night before. To drive to Midland meant that I had
to go</B>
<P><B>over an overpass to get on the highway. Well, the overpass was so icy,
my</B>
<P><B>car couldn't get the traction to go over it, I tried many times, but
my</B>
<P><B>tires just kept spinning, so I turned the car around and went back
home. I</B>
<P><B>called my mom after I got home and told her what had happened and that
I was</B>
<P><B>going to figure out a way to make it to Midland one way or another
to  see</B>
<P><B>grandma. Mom told me it was to late, she had just slipped away
fifteen</B>
<P><B>minutes before I called. </B>
<P><B>        After I heard that, I felt so bad because I hadn't taken the
time</B>
<P><B>out of my busy schedule to make it over to see grandma after her
surgery,</B>
<P><B>and now she was gone. My family and I went to grandma's funeral a couple
of</B>
<P><B>days later. After the funeral, the rest of the family went to eat at
the</B>
<P><B>church, I didn't go with them, I went to my parents house to just be
alone</B>
<P><B>for a bit. While I was sitting on the couch just thinking(about what,
I</B>
<P><B>don't remember,) I looked over at Grandma's rocking chair a few feet
away</B>
<P><B>and she was sitting in it! I blinked and took a second look.... she
was</B>
<P><B>still sitting there, only she wasn't wearing the clothes she had been
buried</B>
<P><B>in; she was wearing an old dress she used to wear around the house
for</B>
<P><B>everday wear and to wear while woking in the yard. I remember looking
at her</B>
<P><B>and she raised her right arm from the chair, kind of gave a little
wave and</B>
<P><B>smiled at me.(she always had a wonderful smile and a mischievous twinkle
in</B>
<P><B>her eye when she was alive.)I smiled back at her, she nodded her head
at me,</B>
<P><B>waved again, then she was gone.</B>
<P><B>        After she left, I felt so peaceful, the guilt I had been feeling
for</B>
<P><B>not  seeing or being with Grandma before she died was gone. I truly
believe</B>
<P><B>she came back to say say goodbye to me. She always loved her grand-kids
(my</B>
<P><B>two brother's and I,) while she was alive, so I guess her coming back
to say</B>
<P><B>goodbye to me, was her way of telling me, that even though she was
gone, her</B>
<P><B>love for us was still around.</B>

<H3><A NAME="my family">Ghostly Experience from My Family</A>
</H3><P><B>by spau@comnet.ca </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi,</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a 30 years old technical professional and like many technical</B>
<P><B>people, I prefer to explain thing logically, but what I am going to
tell</B>
<P><B>you is beyond any logical explanation. These are my family
experience,</B>
<P><B>not mine and I swear on my life that they are real, not just stories.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My family, especially on my father side, has been encountering
ghostly</B>
<P><B>experience over the years and I was told these stories that make me</B>
<P><B>scared but at the same time I would like to be the one who
experienced</B>
<P><B>them. The descriptions are very short because I don't remember the</B>
<P><B>details, just the jest of the stories.</B>
<P>
<P><B>1 st encounter (according to my memory)</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandparents used to live in an old building in Hong Kong, it was</B>
<P><B>built before the second world war. They moved into this unit in this</B>
<P><B>building a few years after the war ended (after the japanese invasion
of</B>
<P><B>the land). Like many old building built around the war time, it had
long</B>
<P><B>hallway and dark corners. My aunt (my father's younger sister) told
me</B>
<P><B>they always got this old chill in their bathroom which was very small</B>
<P><B>compared with western standard. They always felt there was a presence</B>
<P><B>there, and they never spent more than a few minutes there (even for
a</B>
<P><B>shower). </B>
<P>
<P><B>Second encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another encounter was a bright light suddenly appeared in the
kitchen,</B>
<P><B>like an explosion. According to what I was told, the light was seen
from</B>
<P><B>one end of the long hallway and the kitchen is on another hallway.
It</B>
<P><B>lasted a second or so, but it was observable. When my grandparents
went</B>
<P><B>inside the kitchen and checked, ther was nothing and nobody. The</B>
<P><B>location of the kitchen was not at a place bright sunlight would
shine</B>
<P><B>through. The light was certainly not a reflection and more than a
bright</B>
<P><B>light similar to a nuclear explosion, there was no sound.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Third encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>But the more scary one would be this crying sound coming out from the</B>
<P><B>wall at one of the dark corners. At around 12am most nights, the
sound</B>
<P><B>came out from the wall. I forgot whether it was a male or female
sound</B>
<P><B>but it was definitely a human crying sound. My uncle's bed was
opposite</B>
<P><B>to this wall. Surprisingly ,my uncle got angry instead of being
scared,</B>
<P><B>he used to shout at the wall or threw one of his slippers at it,
saying</B>
<P><B>"Shut the F... up" (in Chinese of course), then the sound would stop.</B>
<P><B>But he got very frustrated doing this almost every night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several years after, they moved to another building and again built</B>
<P><B>around the war time. On one of this Chinese halloween nights, when</B>
<P><B>families are burning stuff (for-the-dead-money, paper cars and house,
it</B>
<P><B>is a tradition for the deads, hoping the dead ones get them on the
other</B>
<P><B>side) for their love ones on the street, there was one such ceremony</B>
<P><B>right at the entrance to the building where my grandparents lived.</B>
<P><B>Around 12am, everyone was retired in their rooms and suddenly, all
of</B>
<P><B>them heard this crying noise of a man running across the long hallway</B>
<P><B>which ran through the length of the unit , there was windows in the</B>
<P><B>living room which was one end of the hallway and the other end would
be</B>
<P><B>the balcony. The dog was barking very loudly as this noise was
running</B>
<P><B>from one end to another end. Everyone came out from their rooms which</B>
<P><B>ran along the length of the hallway.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Fourth Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>This happened to my aunt (my father eldest sister). When she was</B>
<P><B>preparing dinner in the small kitchen, she suddenly felt a cold chill</B>
<P><B>coming from her back, she turned and then saw this woman watching
her,</B>
<P><B>like many chinese ghosts (my impression with all stories that I
heard),</B>
<P><B>you can see the face, not fog or just shape, chinese ghosts usually
have</B>
<P><B>very well defined shape, almost like a real person. As an experience</B>
<P><B>person with this sort of thing, my aunt did not care or respond and</B>
<P><B>pretended she was not there, it was believed that if you communicate</B>
<P><B>with the ghost, it will grow attach to you and never leave you alone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But on one occasion, she got very angry as her cabinet in the kitchen</B>
<P><B>were opening and closing like crazy, she slammed on the kitchen bench
in</B>
<P><B>frustration and said that she had had enough, the whole thing stopped</B>
<P><B>immediately.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I guess my family had a way with ghosts.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Fifth encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the same place as in encounter four above. While watching TV
behind</B>
<P><B>which was the balcony and where my aunt's dog was, my cousin suddenly</B>
<P><B>jumped and asked my aunt who the person head was, flying around near
the</B>
<P><B>balcony, the dog was barking at the same time. My cousin was very
scared</B>
<P><B>as he could clearly see the blood was dripping from the neck. The
head</B>
<P><B>was floating around. My aunt did not see it this time but believe my</B>
<P><B>cousin right away as her family had been encountering this for years.</B>
<P><B>She tried to calm my cousin, but it was a very scary experience for
him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Sixth encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>(Same place as above)</B>
<P>
<P><B>My eldest cousin was sick (he was just a kid at the time)and had been</B>
<P><B>sleeping in the bed. One day (during the day)when my aunt brought in</B>
<P><B>some lunch for him, he asked who this boy was and said he was
drowning,</B>
<P><B>he could see this image near the ceiling. The boy was drowning in
water</B>
<P><B>and seemed to be screaming. Without any disbelieving, my aunt asked
her</B>
<P><B>neighbour who was in the apartment building for a long time, about
any</B>
<P><B>prior incident in the neighbourhood. The building was at a very</B>
<P><B>residential area, not downtown apartment building. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The answer she got was , there was a boy drowned a few year back in
the</B>
<P><B>buiding swimming pool. Well, what else....</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was a kid at this time and spent time in their apartment a lot, but</B>
<P><B>never once I saw anything, I would say now it is a disappointment for</B>
<P><B>me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Seventh Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>My aunt (as above) moved to another buiding with larger living area.
I</B>
<P><B>had been there many time and I did not like it as it was dark even
with</B>
<P><B>a lot of sunlight outside.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day, as she was doing some dusting around the apartment and was
in</B>
<P><B>her bedroom, she suddenly saw all this fog around the whole apartment,
I</B>
<P><B>would say it was like the Victorian London type of foggy. She smelt
this</B>
<P><B>rodden meat smell,(this was new to her), as she turned back, she saw</B>
<P><B>this giant pair of hairy feet(just the feet, no upper body or head
or</B>
<P><B>anything), walking across the fog which was very close to the floor.</B>
<P><B>then suddenly the feet disappeared. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As the smell thing was new to her, she asked my granddad what would
that</B>
<P><B>be as my granddad was the most experience with this type of thing.
His</B>
<P><B>reply was "Oh, it was just dead people smell", meaning her apartment
was</B>
<P><B>visited.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Once again, with all the time I spent there, I saw nothing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Eighth Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mum was visiting Taiwan. She was sleeping soundly in her bedroom
in a</B>
<P><B>hotel, until she was awaken suddenly. She then saw this figure in the</B>
<P><B>dark with a giant pair of eyes approaching her, she could not
identify</B>
<P><B>whether it was a man or a woman, as she screamed, my dad got up and</B>
<P><B>turned on the light, nothing there in the room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nineth encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>At the same place as above. Around 1am, my mum was still up but my
dad</B>
<P><B>was asleep. My mum heard this noise coming from outside the hotel</B>
<P><B>building, she looked out down from her window, she saw a group of
people</B>
<P><B>outside seemed to be having a party, the noise was so loud, it could</B>
<P><B>easily be heard even inside the hotel room. My mum, however, could
not</B>
<P><B>figure out whether it was a group of men or women or both, the image
was</B>
<P><B>so VAGUED,even at this short distance.She did not take any notice and</B>
<P><B>went to bed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning , she asked the management whether there was a party</B>
<P><B>outside last night. The management replied there was no party and</B>
<P><B>certainly not at 1am at night. But the noise was also heard by
several</B>
<P><B>people in the group. Ghosts ?????</B>
<P>
<P><B>Finally, tenth Encounter:</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was visting England with my brother and was staying in one of my</B>
<P><B>families house, it was a modern house. One night, when I was out and
my</B>
<P><B>brother was alone in the house and was sleeping in his room with the</B>
<P><B>door completely closed. He suddenly heard footsteps on the stairs.
They</B>
<P><B>were spiral-shaped stairs running all three floors. The footsteps
were</B>
<P><B>clearly heard and were coming from bottom to top floor and was</B>
<P><B>approching his room on the third floor. My brother thought it was me</B>
<P><B>(the owner was gone for a trip), so he did not care, suddenly he
heard</B>
<P><B>someone was talking outside his room (the foot steps stopped at the
same</B>
<P><B>time, what he heard was someone speaking in Victorian English, it was</B>
<P><B>certainly not modern English. my brother recognised that it was not
my</B>
<P><B>voice, he got a little bit scared. He did not open the door to find
out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>By the time I came back, I asked him what was wrong as his face was</B>
<P><B>white. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Once again, I was there for a year on my own, I never heard or</B>
<P><B>encountered anything.</B>

<H3><A NAME=us>It Happened to Us</A>
</H3><P><B>by Tantilizr@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> It started when I was a little girl but became intense as I grew older
and opened my mind to the unknown.</B>
<P><B>     I always believed in "GHOSTS", but never thought I would encounter
one .  Especially one from my own family!.  It all started in May of 1995,
when my aunt suffering from severe emphysema spoke to me a week before she
died and told me she would see me soon,but hopefully not for the wrong reason.
 I laughed and told her that I loved her . That would be the last time I
would speak to her, (SO WE THOUGHT!). </B>
<P>
<P><B>     I was living out of state at the time, when I was home alone with
my son lying on the couch.  Suddenly I felt the loss of my breath and my
heart pounding outside my chest I was terrified and couldnot move from the
couch. It seemed an eternity until I was comfortable again and then the phone
rang.  At that moment I knew my aunt had passed away!. I ran to my yard to
smoke a cigarette, When out on the lawn I saw what I beleived to have been
old family members that had passed moving towards me as to show me they had
come for my aunt to bring her to a better place .I froze in my path and glanced
again only to see them turn and walk disappearing in a blink.    </B>

<H3><A NAME=southern>Southern Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by fourten@bellsouth.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>My experiences have been many and varied, all of which have occured
since moving to </B>
<P><B>Florida in 1981. When I moved here, I lived with my mother and brother
in an old house in </B>
<P><B>Jacksonville in the Riverside area which is filled with historic homes,
many of which </B>
<P><B>have been renovated. My room was in the converted attic and my brother's
was downstairs </B>
<P><B>next to the back porch. Many times when I climbed the stairs to my
room, I would pass a </B>
<P><B>very cold spot and often I could hear a song in my head. When I would
go to turn on the </B>
<P><B>radio in my room, the very song would be on in the exact point I had
"heard".  My brother </B>
<P><B>also swore he had seen the figure of a woman in white on the stairs
on occasion. He had a </B>
<P><B>distinct dislike for the room he was in and convinced my mother to
allow him to make a </B>
<P><B>room in the attic with me. I always felt uneasy in his room as well
and detested the back </B>
<P><B>porch even in broad daylight. We never did find out anything about
the house, but my </B>
<P><B>mother confirmed to me many years later that she too had felt weird
things in the house.</B>
<P><B>  I had one strange experience in the apartment we lived in next. I
was dating a certain </B>
<P><B>boy and, one night coming home from work, I very clearly heard him
speak my name as if he </B>
<P><B>was standing behind me. He was twenty miles away at the time, but the
minute I opened the </B>
<P><B>door, the phone rang and it was him calling.</B>
<P><B>  The most weird things that ever happened to me occured when I was
living with a </B>
<P><B>roommate in a small house on the southside of Jacksonville. Some friends
and I were </B>
<P><B>playing around with automatic writing once and when one girl was 'writing',
we all felt </B>
<P><B>this electric shock go through us. It was so strong, it caused the
metal of my earrings </B>
<P><B>to leave black marks on my ears.  Then I started having very bad nighmares
which I would </B>
<P><B>run screaming from my room. Not long after that both my roommate and
I started hearing </B>
<P><B>noises in the spare room like paper shuffling and my roommate would
find her filing </B>
<P><B>cabinets open. The nightmares intensified and then I started hearing
the paper-shuffling </B>
<P><B>noises in my room, often right next to my head when laying in bed.
 Eventually my friends </B>
<P><B> consulted a ouija board (not the best of sources, I admit) and they
told me that the </B>
<P><B>presence in the house was a man named Richard who had come back to
the house to watch </B>
<P><B>over me and protect me from what I did not know. Later, my roommate
found out that a man </B>
<P><B>had died in the house named Richard who had been an accountant. One
time we were </B>
<P><B>discussing this man in the living room and actually felt him come into
the room. All the </B>
<P><B>hairs on my body raised up at the sensation. We thanked him for his
help and then he left </B>
<P><B>the room.  After I started dating a new man who I later married, we
stopped hearing any </B>
<P><B>signs of Richard- I suppose the matter-of-fact nature of my husband
was protection </B>
<P><B>enough.  A few years later after leaving that house, I found out that
there was a </B>
<P><B>witches' coven practicing in the woods behind our house. As soon as
I left that house, my </B>
<P><B>nightmares abruptly stopped and I haven't had any outstanding incidents
of the ghostly </B>
<P><B>kind.</B>

<H3><A NAME=child>Child's Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by Ellehcim23@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When i was 13 my family moved to Missouri.  we bought a house that
was about 20 years old, the seemed fine.  After we lived there for about
3 years, my sister came to visit with her two children (they were 1 and 3
yrs old). I came home one night real late and snunk in to my room so as not
to wake anyone up,like the kids.  After falling asleep, I woke up to this
feeling of being restrained by the ristsand this heavy feeling on my chest,
I had not opened my eyes yet but i was awake, instead i called my nephews
name( while visiting he liked to sleep with me) thinking that he had woke
up and came to climb in bed with me. When he did not answer, I called out
my neices name thinking she came instead,again no answer. But this time my
heart start racing and I became fearful. My eyes flew open and I saw this
cloudy figure hovering over me floating down toward the foot of my bed.I
staired in confusion not having a clue as to what I was seeing, and the only
thing I could was try to scream, but nothing would come out. I felt powerless
.  Suddenly I felt my strength come back and I jumped under my covers terrified.
 After awhile I finally fell back asleep.  </B>
<P><B>After a few weeks later, the same thing happened again, but this time
I saw the face of a child and I just staired at it and its mouth was moving
as if it were trying to speak but nothing came out.  I just rolled in hopes
that it would go away.</B>
<P><B>  Awile later a friend of mine that lived down the road was coming
home from work one night and in the head lights she could see a child sitting
on the small bridge right  </B>
<P><B>past my house, but when she got to the bridge the child was gone. 
I had never told her of the ghost that I saw which I just wonder if  it might
be the same one she saw.</B>
<P><B> I found out later that my mother and my brother had exsprienced strage
things in the house too, like hearing voices and foot steps .</B>

<H3><A NAME=door>Basement Door</A>
</H3><P><B>by JAubele@pritchettnet.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm a 36 year old marketing professional that encountered several </B>
<P><B>strange events in the old house I grew up in in suburban Pittsburgh.
</B>
<P><B> This 100 year old, 12 room house was the first my parents ever bought
</B>
<P><B>back in 1963.  I lived there for ten years with my parents and 4 </B>
<P><B>sisters.  There were many strange events witnessed by my mother while
</B>
<P><B>she would be home all day taking care of us, but I was too little to
</B>
<P><B>understand and only wish to convey an actual experience I encountered
</B>
<P><B>and remember with great detail.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was in 1972, while the family was in the downstairs living room
</B>
<P><B>watching TV together.  It was probably around 8 pm  when we were </B>
<P><B>startled and terrified to hear a large, crashing sound coming from
the </B>
<P><B>outside hallway.  My parents were visibly shaken, my mother clinging
</B>
<P><B>to myself and my sisters as my father charged to the hallway to </B>
<P><B>examine the disturbance.  Their first thought was an intruder in the
</B>
<P><B>house.  My mother frantically yelled to my father as to what it was.
</B>
<P><B> My dad, after searching the house, came back and informed my mother
</B>
<P><B>that the basement door (leading from our hallway to the basement had
</B>
<P><B>come off the hinges and fell down the basement stairs.  The access
</B>
<P><B>from outside of the basement was locked, as well as the main door from
</B>
<P><B>the outside of the house to the hallway.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This old house featured solid oak doors-very heavy and sturdy.  The
</B>
<P><B>family went to the hallway and were amazed to see that huge door </B>
<P><B>laying at the bottom of the basement steps.  Being the only boy in
the </B>
<P><B>family, I was charged with helping dad put the door back on the </B>
<P><B>hinges.  Here's where it gets very strange.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The door was off the hinges and at the bottom of the steps, yet the
</B>
<P><B>hinge pins were still in the hinges.  All of the hinges on the door
</B>
<P><B>and the door frame were completely in tact.  The only way for that
</B>
<P><B>door to end up at the bottom of the stairs was to remove the hinge
</B>
<P><B>pins, and push the door out from the frame.  How were the pins still
</B>
<P><B>in there and the door off the frame?</B>
<P>
<P><B>Even stranger, as my dad and I tried to remove the hinge pins from
the </B>
<P><B>hinges on the frame to put the door back, we were unable to lift them
</B>
<P><B>off.  It took a hammer and screw driver to pound the old hinge pins
</B>
<P><B>out of the frame to reset the door and hammer the pins back into </B>
<P><B>place.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This has taxed my reasoning for many years.  In my search for a </B>
<P><B>reasonable explanation, I have found none.  I find myself burying this
</B>
<P><B>in the recess of my mind rather than deal with the reality of what
</B>
<P><B>could have actually caused this.  Your website called it back to my
</B>
<P><B>attention, so I had to share it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There are several members of my family that can substantiate this </B>
<P><B>event.</B>

<H3><A NAME=walk>The Walk</A>
</H3><P><B>by jrnm91c@prodigy.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>My great-grandmother's parents were two very smart and genuinely good</B>
<P><B>people.  Her mother's name was Anna, and her father's name was Archie.
</B>
<P><B>He called her Anne.  Every night, they would take a walk around this
old</B>
<P><B>park that is out back of the house.  They looked forward to spending</B>
<P><B>that quiet time with each other.  Archie suddenly died one year of
an</B>
<P><B>apparent heart attack.  Anna was heartbroken.  By now, my</B>
<P><B>great-grandmother was a young teenager, about 13.  One night, a few</B>
<P><B>weeks later, Anna had a dream about Archie.  In the dream, he was out</B>
<P><B>back of the house, outside the fence.  He said: "Come on Anne, let's
go</B>
<P><B>for our walk".  She replied to him in the dream, she said: "No Archie,
I</B>
<P><B>don't feel like it".  The next night, she had the same dream, except</B>
<P><B>this time, Archie was inside the fence.  He said the same thing and
she</B>
<P><B>replied the same way.  Anna had this same dream for the next couple
of</B>
<P><B>nights in a row, and every time, Archie would ask the same thing, but
he</B>
<P><B>would be a little closer to the back door.  Finally, one night, she
had</B>
<P><B>the same dream, and Archie was at the back door.  He asked the same</B>
<P><B>question and she said no.  The next night, she died in her sleep.
 Which</B>
<P><B>means that this time, he got inside the house and she took the walk
with</B>
<P><B>him.  I guess "the walk", meant for her to die and come with him.</B>

<H3><A NAME=uncle>My Uncle's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by sanders@remc11.k12.mi.us </B>
<P>
<P><B>I used to live in Niles, Mi.  The person who owned it before us was
my</B>
<P><B>uncle.  It also used to be a Hospital for the civil war, then it was,</B>
<P><B>years later, the art museum for nancy drew.  I'll start with my
uncle.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He lived in a seven bedroom Masion alone.  So of course he easily
fixed</B>
<P><B>up the rooms and rented them out to acquaintences.  When someone he</B>
<P><B>rented to had a money problem and couldn't pay him, or tried to move
out</B>
<P><B>with a debt the upstairs, front hall light would dim and lighten, dim</B>
<P><B>and lighten, ect.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother and Aunt were visiting my Uncle one day, Upstairs in one
of</B>
<P><B>the rooms was two pictures, one of a man, and one woman, They all
called</B>
<P><B>these two George and martha, (they looked like the washingtons) all
day</B>
<P><B>My mother keeped telling my aunt (jokingly) "Kris, stop flirting with</B>
<P><B>george , martha's going to get mad."  all day she went on and on.
 When</B>
<P><B>they were leaving, my aunt, the last one walking out of the house,
was</B>
<P><B>shoved down the front steps. No one was behind her, and as they
turned</B>
<P><B>to look at the door that was left open.  It slammed shut.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I lived in the house, I was in the basement one day shooting a
BB</B>
<P><B>gun at some cans.  As I put things away and started up the stairs,
the</B>
<P><B>door shut, and locked.  (It only locks from the Kitchen side)  I sat
and</B>
<P><B>waited for about 20 minutes and sure enough they decided to let me
back</B>
<P><B>in, the door unlocked and reopened.  I was the only one home.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>A friend was staying over one night.  My sister was away at a friends.
</B>
<P><B>THis friend of mine came in at about 1 am and woke me up, seems my</B>
<P><B>sisteres alarm had gone off, she mustv'e forget to turn it off.  I
went</B>
<P><B>in and made sure both the alarms were off.  After about 20 min. of
sleep</B>
<P><B>she came back in and said it was going off again, this time I went
in</B>
<P><B>and unplugged it, 30 min. later it was on again.  This time I was
sick</B>
<P><B>of them and threw it under the bed, it still popped on a little later</B>
<P><B>too.  To make matters worse we had been watching horror movies all
night</B>
<P><B>before hand.  I think they wanted attention from this guest, that is
not</B>
<P><B>what they got, she left immediatly in fear.</B>
<P>
<P><B>During summer, we had no form of air conditioning, this house was so</B>
<P><B>large that it was humid and uncomfortable.  All we had to do was</B>
<P><B>complain about how hot we are or something, and all of a sudden a
cold,</B>
<P><B>yet refreshing, chill would shoot through our bodies.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The most remembered of all was in dream form.  I had a dream one
night</B>
<P><B>of a young teenage girl, she had long brown hair and was dressed in
a</B>
<P><B>long dress.  She stood at the end of my bed watching me.  After time
any</B>
<P><B>where I slept she was at the foot watching me.  Later my sister found
a</B>
<P><B>picture of what I described in her history book, This was the girl,
she</B>
<P><B>died of some dieseas at the age of 13 in this house.  </B>
<P><B>One night When a friend was over, She came and handed this friend a</B>
<P><B>black rose, my friend pierced her finger and the blood drop turned
the</B>
<P><B>ground to a lava looking form. When i got up and my feet touched the</B>
<P><B>ground, I was dressed like this girl.  she took my hand and tried to</B>
<P><B>walk me through my floor length window that was now a great light.
 My</B>
<P><B>friend grabbed my arm and was trying to pull me back and hold on. 
I was</B>

<P>
<P><B>When I was smaller, 4 years old maybe, I was visiting my Gran's</B>
<P><B>House in Guelph, Ontario ( I live in Cambridge, Ontario ). At about
2</B>
<P><B>in the morning,I was woken up by the noise of someone falling down.
Being </B>
<P><B>small I started to cry and asked for Gran. She didn't come, and I was
so </B>
<P><B>scared. I got up out of bed and, in an act of bravery, ( for a 4 year-old
</B>
<P><B>at least ) ran down two flights of stairs to Gran's room. That's when
it </B>
<P><B>got bad. Her door was locked, and she wouldn't wake up to answer the
</B>
<P><B>door. I saw a large object that I called " The Fat Man " come down
the </B>
<P><B>stairs. It was murmuring about a  bookit seemed to be looking for.
I was </B>
<P><B>scared, and I started screaming at him to go away. It turned at me,
and </B>
<P><B>what I saw then scared the $%^% out of me! He had no face! It was a
blank </B>
<P><B>grey area on it's head. No nose eyes or other features. It's murmurings
</B>
<P><B>became increasingly louder, and it floated hurriedly towards me. I
put my </B>
<P><B>arms over my face,to protect myself from the ghost. There was a </B>
<P><B>horrifying sound of wood snapping, and whatever it was fell through
our </B>
<P><B>wooden balcony on the landing.</B>
<P><B>                               Later, when I was older, I asked Gran
if </B>
<P><B>she ever saw the ghost. " No," she said. " But, a long time ago, a
heavy </B>
<P><B>man lived here. He was leaning against the balcony over there, when
it </B>
<P><B>gave way. Poor man. Fell three whole stories, hit the ground like a
sack </B>
<P><B>of flour. No one found his body for months, as he lived alone, and
kept </B>
<P><B>to himself.When they did find him though, his face had completely rotted
</B>
<P><B>away..."</B>
