<P><B>I'll Never Forget...</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: cacampbellsk.sympatico.sk@sk.sympatico.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had an experience a few years ago that I'll never forget...I stayed
in</B>
<P><B>a three level house in an older section of the city. This section is
a</B>
<P><B>regal type of area but the houses date back to the beginnings...</B>
<P>
<P><B>The house had 2 living rooms, a small kitchen ,big verandah on front
of</B>
<P><B>house and 1/2 bathroom on main level. The second floor had 2
connected</B>
<P><B>bedrooms and master bedroom with another verandah which ended up on
top</B>
<P><B>of veranda on main floor. There was a full bathroom on this floor
also</B>
<P><B>with, get this, a hanging type of verandah that led off from the</B>
<P><B>bathroom. Nobody used this verandah which went to the back of house.
On</B>
<P><B>the 2nd there was a small spiral staircase that led to the 3rd</B>
<P><B>floor...there were 2 bedrooms here...this is where I stayed...</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was a hippie type of setting in that there was a bunch of friends</B>
<P><B>living together...mind you this happened in the early 80's. About the</B>
<P><B>3rd night of my being in my new surroundings I began to feel quite</B>
<P><B>depressed to the point that I felt suicidal &amp; I didn't know why.
When</B>
<P><B>comparing stories later with another person that had lived there with</B>
<P><B>me, I found out that I wasn't the only  one to experience suicidal</B>
<P><B>thoughts. Along with my suicidal thoughts that night, I  had another</B>
<P><B>strange thought go through my head right then, "There's a girl in
here</B>
<P><B>right now." I wondered what I was doing thinking stupid like that.
You</B>
<P><B>see, I left this house before anyone else and I was the last person
to</B>
<P><B>find out that a strange girl(and she was also malicious) was being
seen</B>
<P><B>by the ones who weren't smart like me to move out earlier. I
basically</B>
<P><B>kept to myself while I was living there and I was given my space.
Life</B>
<P><B>in that house got spookier...One night as I was washing my hair in
the</B>
<P><B>sink (2nd floor), and the doornob behind me, which led to verandah,</B>
<P><B>began to jiggle and make a sound like someone was playing with the</B>
<P><B>doornob. Of course I was spooked. I would stop and look at the</B>
<P><B>doornob,with soap running down my face, and wonder what was going on.
I</B>
<P><B>mustered enough courage to open the door to see who was in the</B>
<P><B>verandah...nobody. So I thought I must be imagining things &amp; then</B>
<P><B>proceeded to finish my hair. The doornob jiggled again. I would stop</B>
<P><B>washing my hair, look at the doorknob, and then the jiggling would
stop.</B>
<P><B>I tried the more to hurry up with my hair. Everytime I started to
wash</B>
<P><B>my hair the jiggling would continue until I looked at the doorknob.
I</B>
<P><B>was quite scared. I only got my hair done that night because I got
a</B>
<P><B>friend to talk to me while I did my hair. In the meantime different</B>
<P><B>people were having their own experiences. On one of the rare
occaisons</B>
<P><B>when there was hardly anybody in the house, one of my friends was
about</B>
<P><B>to ascend to the 2nd floor when a pillow came rolling down the
stairs.</B>
<P><B>She began to question whoever was around if they were the prankster.
At</B>
<P><B>that time I was on the 3rd floor reading a book and she questioned
me</B>
<P><B>also. We didn't say much more to each other about the odd incident
but I</B>
<P><B>know people living in this house were beginning to talk and compare</B>
<P><B>their experiences. A bad habit of mine at one time was to stay up
watch</B>
<P><B>TV and drink coffee all night. Just once I tried to do this in this</B>
<P><B>house. I found I couldn't do this because when I did attempt to enjoy
my</B>
<P><B>favorite pasttime, I felt such an such a feeling that someone was</B>
<P><B>watching me and I knew that I was the only one up. I also felt so
very</B>
<P><B>scared that I just didn't dare stay up any longer. I quickly trashed</B>
<P><B>that idea. I would find out later from my other friends who tried to
be</B>
<P><B>up alone that they would experience someone calling their name in a</B>
<P><B>whispering voice. I'm really glad that didn't happen to me...Finally
I</B>
<P><B>couldn't stay there anymore because I was so depressed. I felt like</B>
<P><B>everybody was friends but me (depressing thoughts). I asked my mom
if I</B>
<P><B>could come back to live at home. I was glad when she said yes. I
didn't</B>
<P><B>bother to let anybody know my plans to leave...I just thought I would
do</B>
<P><B>my friends a favor before I left and that was to leave the house</B>
<P><B>spotless &amp; clean. So on one  particular day, when no one was around,
I</B>
<P><B>began to clean. I even made myself a pot of coffee. I got my clothes</B>
<P><B>ready. Meanwhile I was feeling more &amp; more jumpy. I was even scared
to</B>
<P><B>leave my packed clothes on the 3rd floor and get them when I left.
I was</B>
<P><B>that jumpy and I still didn't think the reasons were that the house
was</B>
<P><B>haunted. So I took my clothes and propped open the front door with
them.</B>
<P><B>I managed to finish cleaning one living room when suddenly an</B>
<P><B>overpowering feeling of fear overtook me so that I dropped everything</B>
<P><B>that I was doing and literally ran out the front door grabbing my</B>
<P><B>clothes as I left. I got outside and took a long look at the house
and</B>
<P><B>walked away. I'll also never forget the feeling of relief &amp; peace
I felt</B>
<P><B>as I got further &amp; further away from the house. I was never on
too great</B>
<P><B>on talking terms with some of the people there afterward because I
was</B>
<P><B>quite depressing to be around when I was living there. One night I
was</B>
<P><B>visiting an one of the old friend's when all of a sudden the sound
of</B>
<P><B>many rushing feet came throught the door. Here it was the good ole
gang.</B>
<P><B>They had fled that house in fear because they were beginning  to see
the</B>
<P><B>spirit of a girl there beginning to manifest itself exactly about the</B>
<P><B>time I left there! I'll never forget...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Interesting Story</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: rachle@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had no choice but to believe in the "other side" from as early
as</B>
<P><B>I can remember.</B>
<P><B>My first and only visual confrontation with a spirit occurred when
I was</B>
<P><B>between 2 &amp; 3 years old.</B>
<P><B>My mother had put me in a crib in her room for a nap while she went</B>
<P><B>downstairs and continued her housework.  No one else was in the house</B>
<P><B>but her and I.  </B>
<P><B>I remember waking from my nap and holding on to the rails  of the
crib</B>
<P><B>while yelling "Ma, come get me".  The house was very large, and I
could</B>
<P><B>hear her walking about downstairs.  I felt very impatient about
getting</B>
<P><B>out of the crib and remember sizing up the railings to decide whether
or</B>
<P><B>not to climb out.</B>
<P><B>I continued to yell, "Ma, come get me" and out of the corner of my
eye</B>
<P><B>I saw "something" glide off of my mother's bed and materialize into
a</B>
<P><B>grey, shape. It precisely glided forward, and then towards me and</B>
<P><B>extended its "arms" out  to me!  I backed away from the rails, and</B>
<P><B>uttered "No, not you!"  I didn't know anything about spirits, but I
knew</B>
<P><B>that witnessing this was shocking.</B>
<P><B>The figure immediately retracted to exactly where it had come from,</B>
<P><B>including flattening back out on my Mother's bed.</B>
<P><B>In a matter of seconds, my Mother appeared in the doorway. I told her</B>
<P><B>that "something" else had tried to lift me out.  She looked
frightened</B>
<P><B>for a moment and then told me that I was dreaming, but all of this
had</B>
<P><B>occurred while I was awake and waiting for her.  I didn't understand,</B>
<P><B>then, why she hadn't given more credance to such an unusual event.
</B>
<P><B>My grandmother had passed away when I was age 2, I later learned. 
I</B>
<P><B>believe that her spirit had tried to show me kindness, however I
never</B>
<P><B>felt comfortable alone in an empty room of that house.</B>
<P><B>In the next ten years my own mother passed away.  My brother, father.</B>
<P><B>and I all experienced strange occurrences of one kind or another.</B>
<P><B>My father told me years later (when I was in my late 20s) that he too</B>
<P><B>believed that the house was haunted and it was only when he gave away
my</B>
<P><B>Grandmother's bedroom set and her giant framed photographs, that the</B>
<P><B>unusual goings on had ended.</B>
<P><B>I am not sure that they have ended.  I haven't lived in that house
for</B>
<P><B>28 years, but often wonder.</B>

<P><B>Litchfield Mn </B>
<P>
<P><B>By: "Jackie Moore" </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Okay, I've always thought about ghosts but it all started when I moved
to Litchfield, Minnesota.</B>
<P><B> We remodeled an old farm house that had 5 fires in it. One day I was
cooking in the kitchen and</B>
<P><B> all of a sudden the towel caught on fire. It was terrible. That wasn't
even the worse of it. </B>
<P><B>One night I came home from work and my brothers wouldn't go to bed
so I sent them up stairs. All</B>
<P><B> of a sudden there was pounding on the walls upstairs. I went upstairs
and outside to check and </B>
<P><B>at that time my brothers were down stairs crying. So I called my boyfriend
first and then my mom</B>
<P><B> who was at work too. I was crying so she came home instantly and we
prayed. That hasn't happened</B>
<P><B> since. Then I was taking a shower one morning and on the mirror was
DIE. I wasn't too afraid cuz</B>
<P><B> I thought it was my siblings but no one was home. So I was afraid.
Another incidence is this </B>
<P><B>little t.v. we have doesn't stay on. I'm convinced that I have ghosts
and it really scares me.</B>
<P><B> Lately I moved to Hutchinson and I experienced something else that
I found unexplainable. One </B>
<P><B>night I was just watching television and the fire alarms in my apartment
went off. They aren't </B>
<P><B>battery operated either. Freaky huh. Well there are my stories.</B>

<P><B>My Friends Experience </B>
<P><B>By: "ALISTAIR STEWART" </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>Recently my friend was in bed when she saw a figure in the corner of
her room. It was a little </B>
<P><B>girl with no face (It was grey with no features except two black holes
for eyes) but the rest of</B>
<P><B> her body was visable. She was wearing denim dungarees and her hair
was in pigtails she also </B>
<P><B>discribed some sort of small hat (quaker's style) but wasn't sure.
The girl slowly came towards</B>
<P><B> her but then disappeared when she shouted loudly. We are trying to
find some sort of explanation</B>
<P><B> for this and we would be grateful if you could help.</B>

<P><B>My Ghost "SAM"</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: DROFFEML@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have lived with "ghosts" every since I can remember.  The house I
lived in </B>
<P><B>while I was growing up is haunted by a blonde child (boy I think).
 The only </B>
<P><B>way you can see this ghost is out of the corner of your eye, you never
can </B>
<P><B>see him looking straight ahead.  He runs up and down the hall (which
ends </B>
<P><B>into the kitchen).  You can see the hallway/kitchen entrance from the
</B>
<P><B>livingroom and for years I would see him run by, but I always thought
it was </B>
<P><B>my little brothers (who were the same height and blonde).  Until one
night</B>
<P><B>my parents were gone and my four brothers and I were sitting in the
livingroom </B>
<P><B>with the lights off watching T.V. and I saw him run from the kitchen
and</B>
<P><B>down the hall, I sat there for a minute wondering what my little brothers
were </B>
<P><B>into.  Then I realized everyone that was in the house was in the livingroom
</B>
<P><B>with me.  I always knew the house was haunted, but I never thought
I had</B>
<P><B>ever seen the spirit until that night.  Then I realized I had been
seeing it for </B>
<P><B>years.  I told my brothers about it and we all decided to call this
spirit </B>
<P><B>Sam, because we didn't know if it was a girl or boy and Sam seemed</B>
<P><B>apporiate. </B>
<P><B> It seemed to be attached to just me, cause I was the only one who
could see </B>
<P><B>it and my room was the region of its source somehow.  My room was always
the </B>
<P><B>coldest room in the house no matter what time of year.  I grew up in</B>
<P><B>Oklahoma and the summer's out here aren't very nice, but my room was
always cold.  </B>
<P><B>Cold to where I would need a comforter and blankets every single
night!</B>
<P><B>Some nights Sam (I hope that is who it was) would shake my bed and
wake me up</B>
<P><B>in a fright, leaving me there wondering if the bed was really still
moving or was </B>
<P><B>it just my heart pounding.  I was too scared to move or open my eyes
to see. </B>
<P><B>Some nights he would turn on my radio waking me up and wondering if
my</B>
<P><B>little brothers were being brats again only to find them sound asleep
in their</B>
<P><B>room. </B>
<P><B> There was one night that I was not quite asleep yet, I was lying on
my back </B>
<P><B>with one of my arms up resting on my forehead, when I felt this cold
breeze </B>
<P><B>on my arm and then something just threw my arm off of my forehead and
onto</B>
<P><B>my chest and then the radio came on.  It was so fast I didn't know
what had </B>
<P><B>happen until I thought about it.  Soon after, I moved out and in with
my </B>
<P><B>sister (who really needs to submit her stories), when I was 16.  My
parents </B>
<P><B>moved a couple of years later, but they still own the house.  When
I was</B>
<P><B>24 I had gotten a divorce from my first husband and moved back into
the house</B>
<P><B>with my two children.  I made the room that use to be mine into a toy
room, I </B>
<P><B>really didn't need them to sleep in there.  Then I meet my second
husband</B>
<P><B>and he moved in with us.  The next thing I know Mark (my second/present
husband) </B>
<P><B>is asking me if anyone has every died in the house.  I told him that
I</B>
<P><B>really didn't know and asked him why.  He told me that the toyroom
light keeps </B>
<P><B>flicking on and off.  It freaked him out really bad.  I explained to
him</B>
<P><B>that there was a spirit in the house and we have always called him
Sam and if Sam </B>
<P><B>freaked him out too bad to tell him to just go to bed.  Then Mark was
able</B>
<P><B>to see him, only out of the corner of his eye, running up and down
the</B>
<P><B>hallway.  </B>
<P><B>It would freak him out pretty bad and he hated it when it would happen
while </B>
<P><B>I wasn't home (he feels safe when I am at home even now, because he
says I </B>
<P><B>know how to handle the spirits!  I'm just not afraid of them is all).
 But </B>
<P><B>soon he got use to telling Sam to go to bed, when he would say that
the </B>
<P><B>happenings would stop for a night or two and then start up again. 
We lived </B>
<P><B>there for two years and then moved out.  It is empty right now, until
my </B>
<P><B>parents sale it, for some reason everytime they try to sale it something
</B>
<P><B>happens and it never sales.   Well there is the start of my little
</B>
<P><B>adventures.  I have more because that is one of my hobbies "Ghosts
Hunting" </B>
<P><B>is what my sisters and I call it.  I will have to submit the story
about the </B>
<P><B>one that followed me home one night, but that will come later.  Hope
you </B>
<P><B>enjoyed.  Not quite scary, but adventful.</B>

<P><B>My Great Aunt's House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Pookmalone@cs.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My great aunt Marion had 3 sons; Murphy, Peter and Victor. Peter was
the </B>
<P><B>oldest, and when he was in his early 30s, he killed himself in her
house.</B>
<P><B>He </B>
<P><B>was staying with her while going through a divorce, and he was very
</B>
<P><B>depressed.  One day while my aunt was at work, he took all the pills
in her </B>
<P><B>medicine cabinet (and there were a lot - Marion had a heart condition)
and </B>
<P><B>drank most of a bottle of vodka. My poor aunt found him dead on the
floor in </B>
<P><B>her den when she came home that evening.  Then, within a few months,
Murphy, </B>
<P><B>who was in his late twenties, was diagnosed with some rare kind of
cancer</B>
<P><B>and </B>
<P><B>died of it within 6 months.  A few months following that, my grandfather
</B>
<P><B>died, and grandmother went to live with Marion, her sister.   A few
months </B>
<P><B>later, my grandmother died of a stroke on Maron's living room couch.
 (Poor </B>
<P><B>Aunt Marion, you'd think all that shock and grief would have finished
her </B>
<P><B>off, what with her already having heart problems.) All these deaths
happened </B>
<P><B>in the time span of about year.    The next Valentine's Day rolled
around, </B>
<P><B>and when Marion came home from work, her housekeeper told her she "couldn't
</B>
<P><B>get the hearts up of the carpet in the den".  She didn't understand
what the </B>
<P><B>lady was talking about, so she went into the den to have a look. There
were </B>
<P><B>hearts, in a pattern like footsteps, leading from the doorway of the
room to </B>
<P><B>the place where Peter was found.  In that space was a great big heart,
a </B>
<P><B>couple of feet wide.  It was like someone had brushed the nap of the
carpet </B>
<P><B>in the opposite direction to draw the heart shapes into the carpet.
 The </B>
<P><B>housekeeper told my aunt she'd vacuumed over it numerous times, and
done </B>
<P><B>everything she could think of to get rid of them, but they wouldn't
go</B>
<P><B>away.  </B>
<P><B>Marion got down on her hands and knees and tried to brush the hearts
away </B>
<P><B>with her hands.  But they just wouldn't go. They finally called the
</B>
<P><B>University of Maryland, who promptly came out and investigated.  They
</B>
<P><B>confirmed it as an actual psychokinetic phenomenon.  As far as I know,
the </B>
<P><B>hearts are still there today.  Marion thought it was a message from
Peter; a </B>
<P><B>valentine to say he loved her and that he was sorry he killed himself
(and </B>
<P><B>for doing it in her house).  My mother thinks it was grandmother, because
</B>
<P><B>"she was so sweet and that's just the sort of thing she would do -send
a </B>
<P><B>valentine to her sister".  Other relatives thought it might be Murphy
for </B>
<P><B>some reason I can't remember, but I think it was Peter, because the
"foot </B>
<P><B>steps" lead to the big heart that was in the place where they found
him.   </B>
<P><B>The whole thing clearly says Peter to me.  Spooky, huh? Definitely.
But also </B>
<P><B>kind of neat, because to me, it's more proof that there is life after</B>
<P><B>death.  </B>
<P><B>And it's also neat to know that they can communicate with us, and that
maybe </B>
<P><B>our loved ones who go on before us get to watch over us, or at least
come </B>
<P><B>back and visit us sometimes, even if we aren't always aware of it.

<P><B>My House is Haunted</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: RASKLEKING@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>    My name is Albert ,I am 12 years old. My house is very haunted.
I know </B>
<P><B>that on the website you must have many stories about people living
in</B>
<P><B>haunted houses. However my story is truly unique. My grandmother would
never come </B>
<P><B>into my house because she knew it was haunted. She never said anything
about </B>
<P><B>it but I knew. She can tellthe history of a house by just taking one
step</B>
<P><B>in. She would either like the feeling or dislike the feeling of the
house. She</B>
<P><B>is afraid of my house.</B>
<P><B>    It all started back when I was 8 years old. Me my brother and my
pop-pop </B>
<P><B>were outside looking for arrowheads. We found two. When it started
to get </B>
<P><B>dark we went inside for bed. In the middle of the night I awoke and
I did</B>
<P><B>not know why. So I went and got some water. a came back to my room
and found a </B>
<P><B>tall green man walkingacross my room and through the wall. I was in
the</B>
<P><B>state of shock. Isnapped out of it a few minutes later and I slept
in the living </B>
<P><B>room.    When I was ten my favorite cat died. He was black and white
and always </B>
<P><B>slept on my bed. I had a dream one night that he had come back from
the dead </B>
<P><B>and was running around the house terrorizing me and my family. When
I woke</B>
<P><B>up I was covered with black and white cat hairs.</B>
<P><B>    Everybody thinks that I should get my parents to move somewhere
else but </B>
<P><B>I won't. Because if it is haunted what will happen to the next family
who </B>
<P><B>lives here? I'm not leaving until I find out what's going on.</B>

<P><B>My Story and a Little Advice</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>By: Emily N Wallace </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Hi. I read your story about your encounter with the ghosts. I do believe
in ghosts because when </B>
<P><B>I was a little girl I lived in a haunted house. I don't believe in
human spirits bound to the </B>
<P><B>earth however. I only believe in demons. When Satan was thrown out
of Heaven he took angels with</B>
<P><B> him. Those became demons. I believe sometimes they take human form,
just as I believe God's </B>
<P><B>angels do the same. Anyway, they are not usually a pleasant thing to
have around, whatever they</B>
<P><B> are. Here's my story.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The house that I lived in for the first four years of my life was haunted.
It was not haunted </B>
<P><B>when we left. I'm not sure how old I was when the demons were driven
out, but I think I was about</B>
<P><B> 18 months old. I don't remember any of this. The entire account has
been told to me by my family</B>
<P><B>. My father was a pastor of a church that was on the same lot as the
house. The house and the </B>
<P><B>church were, literally, 5 steps away from each other. What makes this
so odd is, the house and</B>
<P><B> the church were both haunted. There are so many stories from different
people that heard and </B>
<P><B>saw different things, this story is going to be very choppy. I know
that it already is. Just</B>
<P><B> bear with me. My dad would be working in his office in the church
and hear noises. Footsteps, </B>
<P><B>doors banging, and he got strange phone calls some times. My sister,
who would practice the </B>
<P><B>piano and singing in the church also heard these things. A lovely old
women at the church said</B>
<P><B> that she heard demons laughing and playing in the church. In the house,
or the parsonage, as </B>
<P><B>we called it, there were many more strange things. The door bell would
ring constantly for no </B>
<P><B>reason. My aunt was sleeping on the couch one night and thought she
heard something. It sounded</B>
<P><B> like ladies having a prayer meeting. She got up to look around to
see if a TV or radio was on,</B>
<P><B> and nothing was. She went back to sleep. She woke up again and saw
a woman standing near a </B>
<P><B>window. She went back to sleep. (My aunt has seen such things before,
I don't think it bothered</B>
<P><B> her.) A friend of my parents staying with us saw the same thing at
a different time. Neither </B>
<P><B>my aunt or this friend had spoken with each other about this. An evangelist
and his wife were </B>
<P><B>staying in one of our bedrooms. During the night a hand started choking
the wife. The only thing</B>
<P><B> she could do was squeeze her husband's hand to wake him up. He woke
up and told it to go away in</B>
<P><B> the name of Jesus. It let go of her. </B>
<P><B>Now you have to understand my father was not one to get into the ghost
thing. Neither was the </B>
<P><B>friend who saw the woman, like my aunt did. I would never expect him
to admit our house had been</B>
<P><B> haunted but he did. I didn't hear all of this until I was much older
and it shocked me. Anyway,</B>
<P><B> everyone at church must have found out about all this activity. At
some point they all got </B>
<P><B>together and prayed through the church and through the house. No priests
needed, no rituals, or </B>
<P><B>holy water. Just some good ole church folks praying. After they prayed,
all the activity stopped</B>
<P><B>. You see, they told those demons something very important. To go away
in the name of Jesus. That</B>
<P><B> name is very important. It has authority. It is the only thing that
can drive them away. The </B>
<P><B>only thing. </B>
<P><B>My advice to you or anyone you know struggling with a ghost problem
is to find someone who goes</B>
<P><B> to a Pentecostal church to help pray the problem away. I say Pentecostal
because those are </B>
<P><B>people that know about spiritual warfare. I go to the Church of God
of Prophecy. I know you </B>
<P><B>must think I'm some kind of religious nut rambling on here but my story
is true. I believe your</B>
<P><B> story because I know that if you tell a ghost to go away it will quit
bothering you. It probably</B>
<P><B> did stick around though. And I also know that it is a bad thing to
call a ghost back. They can't</B>
<P><B> be helped. These aren't people who need rest. These are fallen angels
who are damned. They don't</B>
<P><B> shy away at crosses or any other religious relic. They only respond
to a person who is saved by</B>
<P><B> the blood of Jesus and rebukes them in the name of Jesus. No demon
is afraid of any human. That</B>
<P><B> includes priests, or any other kind of minister. Remember my father
was a very wonderful </B>
<P><B>minister and we had demons in our house. The only person they are afraid
of is Jesus Christ. </B>
<P><B>Call on Jesus, and let Him remove the spirits. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm sorry this e-mail was so horrendously long. I do hope this helps
you or someone else in some</B>
<P><B> way. </B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 3 in 1987 me and my mom lived with my moms best friend
in Gibraltar ,Michigan.</B>
<P><B> He was a mean old man but helped my mother out with tremendlessly,but
what she didnt know is </B>
<P><B>that he was malesting me while he watched me . I was to young to know
it was wrong so of cource</B>
<P><B> I never told her. About a year later we moved in with my cousin cause
her friend " Lester" lost</B>
<P><B> the house. I'd say 2try later my mom got a call from him asking us
to come live with him again, </B>
<P><B>so we did. He passed on 2 yrs later. In his car out in front of the
house, he had a heart attack. </B>
<P><B>He left everything to my mom even his GHOSTLY car.</B>
<P><B>It all started one day about 2 or 3 years after Lesters death, We were
at my moms friends house</B>
<P><B> and was getting ready to leave and I when out to the car to warm it
up and listen to the radio</B>
<P><B> ( in the car he died in). I looked up to see if my mom was coming
yet and I looked back at the</B>
<P><B> radio I seen something out of the corner of my eye, so I looked it
was him laying there </B>
<P><B>motionless with a mist all around him, I got out of the car and ran
in the house and told </B>
<P><B>my mom what I had seen, she tried to tell me it was my imagination.
But I knew what I saw. </B>
<P><B>It was calm till I turned 12 thats when most of it started. One day
I got ready for bed, and I </B>
<P><B>had to slam the door and pull on it to make sure it was shut and lock
it cause it was old , and</B>
<P><B> thats what I did. So I was laying on the couch right beside the door
when it opened forcefully</B>
<P><B> and slammed against the couch. I shot off the couch but thought it
was my mom back from work ,</B>
<P><B>she is the only one with a key ,but her car was no where and no one
was at the neighbors so I </B>
<P><B>was stunded cause I knew I shut and locked it.</B>
<P><B>Then it occured to me it was him. That was probably the worst thing
that happened. But glasses </B>
<P><B>would fall off the dish drainer and brake, tv would turn off and on
in the middle of the night</B>
<P><B> along with the stereo, walls would shake when they are as sturdy as
a brick, I'd hear glasses </B>
<P><B>hit in the kitchen like a cheers or something,washer would turn on
and off by its self. The worst</B>
<P><B> was when I'd be sleeping and I'd feel something grab my arm. My dog
would look at things that </B>
<P><B>but I seen nothing .</B>
<P><B>Well now I have moved out of that house and have no things happening
.So thank you for listening </B>
<P><B>to my story. </B>

<P><B>Nana</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>By: "JANAI" </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>While reading others stories I felt that I would like to share my
own.</B>
<P><B>When I was a little girl I had a Nana, my mothers grandmother , that
adored me and I was her </B>
<P><B>constant companion. She used to tell me stories and give me treats
even though dinner would be</B>
<P><B> cooking and she wasnt suposed to..(thats what Nana's are for) she
used to say to me.</B>
<P><B>At the age of 7 I was sleeping in my bedroom when I woke up cold and
decided to shut my bedroom</B>
<P><B> window.As I got up to go to the window I noticed my Nana sitting in
my rocker in the corner of</B>
<P><B> my room. I was a little shocked that she had come over to our house
but I was also excited </B>
<P><B>because I Loved her and when Nana was there I could usually get away
with murder,,LOL</B>
<P><B>She looked at me and whispered for me to HUSH, in a realy strange husky
tone is the only way I </B>
<P><B>can describe it,thats all she said over and over was HUSH BABY HUSH
, so I went over to her to</B>
<P><B> sit on her lap like I always do but she was realy cold and that kinda
scared me a little .SHe</B>
<P><B> told me she loved me and that I was a small peice of her heart that
would go on and on . I didnt</B>
<P><B> understand what she meant but sometimes she would say those sort of
things so I wasn't concerned</B>
<P><B> .She told me to go back to bed that shed see me tommorow .So I did.</B>
<P><B>The next morning my mom woke me up to tell me that Nana had died peacefully
in her sleep that </B>
<P><B>night ,I told her that was impossible cause she was at our house last
night,unfortunately though</B>
<P><B> it was true she had died in her sleep but I think she had come to
say goodbye to me before she </B>
<P><B>left for the next world.As promised though I did see her the next day
while laying on the sofa </B>
<P><B>in our living room I looked up at the mirror on the wall opposite the
couch and saw her </B>
<P><B>reflection smiling back at me. That was my experience with the paranormal
my Nana loved me so </B>
<P><B>much that she came back from death to say goodbye to me and I love
her all the more for it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>For the skeptics who don't believe me well, who says LOVE doesnt conquer
all including death?</B>

what</B>
<P><B>it was and i felt safe in the house.I had a dog that would run up and</B>
<P><B>down the stairs as if she were plying fetch.But on the day we were</B>
<P><B>packing to move I had a sad feeling about leaving the house.I was in
my</B>
<P><B>kitchen packing dishes and my husband had steped out to laod the van</B>
<P><B>when I got a really bad chill and I felt very sad.I looked up to the</B>
<P><B>hall and there stood a young women about 25 years old.She had on a

<P><B>I have another experience for you. When my grandmother was raising
my dad and uncles around the </B>
<P><B>50's they heard of a ghosts that might live there. When they were doing
there homework downstairs</B>
<P><B> they heard someone yell Norma. (that's my grandmothers name) They
thought it was my grandfather</B>
<P><B> but he was at work. About thirty years later when I was little my
grandma and grandpa had dogs.</B>
<P><B> They would be the only ones there and they said the dogs would stand
at the end of the stairs </B>
<P><B>and just go crazy. Now I am 15 and I stay there and sleep downstairs
on the couch. A couple of</B>
<P><B>times when I was there I could have sworne I've felt a presence and
once I did hear something </B>
<P><B>like someone was moving around, maybe I'm just going crazy. Thank you
for listening.</B>
