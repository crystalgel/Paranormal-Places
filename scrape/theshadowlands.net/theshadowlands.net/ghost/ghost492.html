Home</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp; greenstupidperson@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My
family came back from vacation to our house ,which has never given us a
reason
to believe anything supernatural was at work, and almost instantly
things began
to happen. Small noises were heard in the walls, but they were
irregular and
not bothersome, then the loud banging in the ceiling started, and it
seemed to
be centralized around me. Eventually it ebbed away and nothing was
heard for a
few weeks, then as I was going to the bathroom i looked into my
sister's room
and standing next to her bed I saw a shadow, it was bulky and hulkish,
next
second, it was gone. My mom woke up one night and saw&nbsp; a large
shadowy something in her room, then
pass through the wall into my sister's room. I was laying in bed
listening to
music, when something prickly or scaly grabbed my wrist .Nothing has
been seen
since but the knocking is loud again and phantom smells spring up
constantly
and are extremely offensive, it smells like something died.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost
of Logan Square</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
kookie1258@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This
is a true event that happened to me. One night my eyes were opened into
the supernatural
and for the first time in a long time I could sense and see things no
one else
could.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was September of 1990 and
some friends of mine were taking a weekend holiday and asked me to
house sit
for them. Their apartment was a gorgeous grey stone building on
Sacramento
Boulevard in the Logan Square Neighborhood in Chicago.&nbsp; I&#8217;d been
there many times before, but this
particular time something felt different from the moment I stepped into
the
foyer.&nbsp; I was with another person, a
friend of mine at the time, and as we got ourselves situated we decided
to
order pizza.&nbsp; Before the pizza arrived I
decided to take a shower in the master bathroom.&nbsp; While I was
showering it felt like someone
was in the shower stall with me&#8230; watching me.&nbsp;
I couldn&#8217;t see them but I knew someone was there!&nbsp; A feeling of
uneasiness came over me and my
heart started pounded in my chest. I hurried as fast as I could to dry
myself&nbsp; off and get dressed in my sweet
pants and t-shirt. I ran out of the bathroom almost slipping on the
marbled
floor.&nbsp; I told my friend what I&nbsp; felt but he just laughed it
off.&nbsp; He said the apartment was big and usually
full of people laughing and having a good time and now it felt
empty.&nbsp;
It did seem like a logical explanation as to
why I was feeling a little spooked, but I&nbsp;
couldn&#8217;t shake the feeling that someone or something was there watching
and waiting&#8230;&#8230; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>He
then went on to take a shower and as he did I sat on the edge of the
bed in the
master bedroom waiting for him to finish. The whole time I kept looking
around
and feeling a little on edge.&nbsp; It was
warm outside and we had the windows open yet I felt chilled to the
bone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was still in the shower when the doorbell
rang.&nbsp; I knew it was the pizza guy so I
grabbed the money and quickly walked down the long hallway into the
living
room.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I reached the middle of the
living room I suddenly stopped. I was just a few feet from the front
door and
from the corner of my eye I could see a dark shadow at the end of the
table in
the dining room.&nbsp; I must have done a
Michael Jordan leap to the front door because I opened it so fast the
pizza guy
was startled.&nbsp; Feeling a little
embarrassed I smiled, grabbed the pizza and gave him a $20.00 dollar
bill. I
told him to just keep the change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
that time a large pizza was only about $12.00 bucks plus a free 2 liter
of soda
so he got a good tip.&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked as fast
as I could to the kitchen to get two glasses with ice.&nbsp; They had
an old refrigerator with aluminum
ice trays.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t pull the lever
back from the ice tray to retrieve the cubes as someone had over filled
it and
water had frozen around the lever.&nbsp;&nbsp;
While struggling to pull the lever I could feel someone in the kitchen
watching me.&nbsp; All the hairs on the back
of my neck and arms were standing straight up straight!!&nbsp; I swear
I felt someone touch the back of my
neck and lift&nbsp; strands of my long
hair!&nbsp;&nbsp; I grabbed everything and ran down
the hall screaming and crying back to the master bedroom.&nbsp; My
friend told me to relax that I was letting
my imagination run wild.&nbsp; I told him it
was not my imagination and I knew what I saw and what I was
feeling!&nbsp;
It was all too creepy and instead of trying
to comfort me, he was making me feel like I was crazy!&nbsp; I was
livid but scared! I ate some pizza,
watched a little TV and fell asleep.&nbsp; It
must have been about 2:00 am when I was awakened by a strange noise of
something being dragged on the floor or feet shoffling.&nbsp; I opened
my eyes and at the foot of the bed
were 3 beings.&nbsp; It was like a mist or fog
of some sort.&nbsp; I could make them out to
be a woman a man and a child. They were transparent but I could see a
human
form.&nbsp; Their eyes were dark black holes
and they were tall and thin.&nbsp; As they
walked along side of each other the woman suddenly noticed I could see
them.&nbsp; They were as surprised and seemed
as frightened as I was.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked at
the man and pointed at my direction.&nbsp;
They all looked at me at the same time!&nbsp;
My heart was beating so fast I thought it would explode in my
chest!&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t move to alert my
friend sleeping next to me.&nbsp; My body was
paralyzed and all I could do was follow them with my eyes!&nbsp; I
couldn&#8217;t even speak because my tongue would
not move!!!&nbsp; The atmosphere in the room
was strange.&nbsp; I could see what looked
like&nbsp; a water reflection on the
wall.&nbsp; The only way to explain is water
reflecting from a pool and how it dances off the walls like sparkles of
light.&nbsp; I laid there what seemed like an
eternity and then my body just gave in to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; I awoke
some time later and while opening my
eyes I could see the younger ghost or being or whatever it was right in
front
of me slouched down his face right in mine!!!&nbsp;
I gasped and he took off to the foot of the bed and out the door where
his parents (I assume they were his parents) stood watching.&nbsp; Then
just like that they were gone,
vanished.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t fall back to sleep
until sun rise about 6:00 am or so then only sleeping about an hour. I
got up
put on my gym shoes not bothering to get dressed because I slept in my
sweat
pants and t-shirt. I never returned to that apartment nor did I ever
see my so
called friend again.&nbsp; His
loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My friends who lived there never
experienced anything.&nbsp; In fact no one
actually believed me when I told them.&nbsp;
It did happen and I will never forget the terror I felt that night nor
will I forget the ghosts of Logan Square. This is absolutely a true
story. </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Our
Experience at Motel 6</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cathyannperrin@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Motel
six on woodlands village bld flagstaff az room 351 third floorMy family
and I
stayed there for 3 months on the third floor room 351.&nbsp; We have
pics of the demonic face in a mirror,
at first we were always angry and upset alot and we had alot of health
issues
all of a sudden, felt like you were going crazy. Our son was on his
cell phone
and happened to look up at the mirror and saw this immage of a demon
looking
type face and he took a picture with his cell phone, it really was
frightening
and we were scared to stay in the room. The maid was in the other room
cleaning
and we asked her to come and and showed her the picturewe took and the
mirror
we got it off of and she said I see that alot up Here in other rooms,
she said
the third floor was haunted and she had seen other strange things but
never
told me what they were but she did say we were stronger than it and not
to worry,
well we weren't going to stay and find out so we packed our stuff and
got out.
We reported it to several paranormal groups, we did find out from one
of the
front desk clerks that there has been alot of violence, drugs, and
deaths there
and I think that's why the manager of the motel had a priest bless it .
I do
know people who run it are acting very strange now, very werid to say
the
least, I would advise people to not stay there.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>To
This Day I still get Chills</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sweet_annie_wood@yahoo.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;My family and I lived in GA. for about
3
years.&nbsp; My sister came to visit in July
of 2008 while my husband was in Iraq.&nbsp; We
went to Midway, GA.&nbsp; They have a museum
and cemetery there that are very old.&nbsp;
During the civil war the soldiers would use the cemetery to keep their
cattle and horses.&nbsp; There are hundreds or
thousands of people buried in this cemetery.&nbsp;
Basically there are people buried on top of people.&nbsp; Anyway, we
went into the cemetery after
visiting the house and church.&nbsp; As we
walked into the side of the cemetery I felt a pain in the side of my
chest.&nbsp; It was not a sharp pain, just a
dull annoying pain.&nbsp; We walked around and
looked at pretty much all of the stones.&nbsp;
The whole time I had this pain and at one point under one of the trees
the pain became sharp, but subsided as I walked away from that
spot.&nbsp;
We walked out the front of the cemetery and
the pain was gone.&nbsp; I did not say a word
about the pain to my sister until we left the cemetery.&nbsp; A couple
days later she was doing some
research about the cemetery and found a story that she told me to sit
down
before she read it.&nbsp; She told me that
there were forbidden lovers that would meet in the cemetery late at
night, so
that the girls father would not find out.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the father did end up finding out.&nbsp; He went to the
cemetery and waited.&nbsp; The first one to show up was the boy.&nbsp;
The father stabbed the boy and left him to
die.&nbsp; When the daughter found her lover
she took the same knife and stabbed herself.&nbsp;
They were found under the same tree that I felt the sharp pain.&nbsp;
That is the only experience that I have ever
had.&nbsp; I am not a sensitive person, but in
that case I was the only one who felt anything.&nbsp;
When I think about it still to this day I get chills!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A
Story for The Shadowlands</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RJsOldie@aol.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi,
Wanted to share a story with you. The house I grew up in, my Parents
had bought
just before i was born....in 1965 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. When I
was about
maybe 3 or 4 I would go around the house talking to myself, I suppose
this is a
natural for a child, but not sure I was talking to anything there, just
gabbing
like a kid i suppose.When i was 5, I returned home from School one day
with my
older Sister, a friend of mine and a few of my Sister's friends. We
were
talking on the front porch and all of a sudden we all heard the
upstairs toilet
flush. &nbsp;Going around to the back of the
house where the only window is to the bathroom, the window was shut and
nothing
was against the house (ladder) or anything else to get up there to
it.&nbsp;
Needless to say, none of us had gone inside
until our Mom got home from work.&nbsp; Another
time, i would be sitting on the kitchen floor and roll my ball across
it, and
every time i did this, it would stop ( like someone else would be on
the
receiving end ) and roll back to me.&nbsp; As
I got a bit older, perhaps 12 or so, there was one place in our
livingroom
where I stood only to feel a tap on my right shoulder...happened only
once to
me but on a different occasion it has happened to my older Sister as
well.&nbsp; I have heard someone calling my name on more
than one occaision in my bedroom....the strange thing is before i hear
the
voice, I'd be standing there, like i'm transfixed on something or
intently
listening for something, but i was always alone.&nbsp; Another time,
strangely enough i was looking
out my front bedroom window as my Mom was mowing the lawn, and I got
this
distinct voice, whether it came from my head or inside my ear, to get
my head
out of &nbsp;the window because it was going
to slam shut. As i did this, it surely did slam shut and broke the
window.&nbsp; A bit of history as I know it on the house:
The house was built in 1950&nbsp; A woman had
died in that house when she was in her late 90's...never knew if she
had family
or not...never knew how to go about and check it out.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Augusta
, ILL</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
astridst.claire@gmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In
2007 we bought a very large house in Augusta, ILL. The house is the
oldest
house in the county, built in 1859, William Dexter for his family. We
are the
9th owners of this house. When we eent to do the final walkthrough, I
asked
about Halloween, as we like to do a display. He told me no one would
come. When
I asked why, he told me that the locals believe that the house is
haunted. I
laughed at that, I couldn't believe it.&nbsp; The
house is a Victorian Italiante, and looks every bit of the term creepy.
Town's
people call it the Munster House. Forgetting about what theseller said,
we
moved in in August. The house had a very "sad" feel to it. The
strange things didn't start to begin until Nov., right after Halloween.
I
smelled smoke in the sunroom. It was in a 2ft squre area. We searched
the house
inside and out , from basement to cupola, and could find nothing. It
just
vannished after about 20 mins. This happened twice. Then there were
"golden " , I can't call them apparitions, more like a curtain,
walked across the dining room doorway , in the early hrs. of the
morning for
about a week. &nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the middle of
January of 2009, the 21st to be exact, my son was awaken by a woman's
voice at
1:40 am. He thought it was his wife, but she was asleep. He followed
the voice
around the entire second floor and to the servants stairway, where it
suddenly
stopped. &nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hrs. of the
morning the next day, I was awakened by unfamiliar footsteps in the
upper hall.
As I listened, I too heard voices of a woman talking to someone at the
top of
the servant's stairway. Loud enough to hear, but not loud enough to
make out
waht was being said. &nbsp;&nbsp;Now I brought this
to the IPRS, they are a branch of TAPS, and they wanted to come out and
investigate. I have declined as the town's people would probably flip
out. I
told them that they may not find anything as I exorcised the house
after my
son't wife was pushed down the main front hall staircase. That happened
in
April of 2008.&nbsp; This house had slaves
back in the 1800's, and a story is told about town that a black slave
was hung
on the property and buried. I can find no indication that this house
was
involved with the underground railroad, coming from Mo. to ILL. As was
also another
story told about this house.&nbsp; After
Halloween of 2009, we were seeing Shadow people in broad daylight, in
Victorian
dress.&nbsp; </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Child
Ghost in Moore OK</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rob@rcewebsites.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
am very curious as if anyone has ever reported a child ghost in a Moore
Ok&nbsp; on Sequoya Ave.&nbsp; Many years ago when I was first
stationed at
Tinker AFB my wife, daughter and I moved into a temporary duplex in
Moore.&nbsp; It was very nice, clean and recently fixed
up.&nbsp; Very reasonable price as well (lower
than like residences in the area).&nbsp; It
wasn't long though until we started noticing strange things in the
house.&nbsp; I worked nights and my wife constantly
complained that she didn't feel like she was alone when I was
gone.&nbsp;
She would often spend time at friends houses
because of this. &nbsp;Shortly we started
getting glimpses of someone in the house.&nbsp;
One day I asked my wife if she had been seeing anything and she said
yes.&nbsp; I told I had too, and asked her to
write down what she had been seeing and I would write down what I had
been
seeing. &nbsp;She wrote a young girl about 13
yrs old wearing a long white robe or bedclothes.&nbsp; I wrote down a
young girl about 10-11 yrs old
wearing a long white slip or night robe. After that we would see this
form a
lot walking from one bedroom to the next.&nbsp;
Never scary or evil, she seemed lost or looking for something. We moved
into our permanent home and never looked into the history of the
apartment.&nbsp; I can't even remember the
address now but have always remained curious if something had happened
there or
if anyone else had ever seen anything.&nbsp;
This was at least 25 years or more ago.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Dark
Red-Eyed Hound </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
taintedcurse@live.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>About
two months ago, my 16 year old nephew was telling me about his mother's
house,
that my hubby and I will be renting in the coming months. Somehow, we
got on to
a discussion about hauntings.&nbsp; Then he
told me that he had seen some weird stuff in his mother's house.&nbsp;
He told me that a few times, he woke in the
middle of the night and heard some evil growling coming from outside
his bedroom
window.&nbsp; He said that it sounded really
terrifying.&nbsp; I said to him, "Are you
sure you were definately awake?"&nbsp; He
believes 100% that he was very awake. He remembers waking up and
hearing it and
had trouble going back to sleep that night.&nbsp;
He said this happened a few times in the space of about 6
months.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He then went on to tell me that something
happened there that made him REALLY terrified.&nbsp;
He said he was woken in the middle of the night again, to the sounds of
low menacing growling. But instead of the sound coming from outside his
bedroom
window, they appeared to be coming from the hallway inside the
house.&nbsp;
He said he tensed right up and tried not to
breath too loudly so that he could hear the growl.&nbsp; His eyes were
locked onto his bedroom door
which was open slightly.&nbsp; He told me that
he was freaked out when he saw the door move and saw the tip of a dog's
nose,
as it slowly stuck its head through the door.&nbsp;
He said that the black hound had glowing red eyes, and by this stage he
didn't know what else to do but to flick the bedside lamp on and as he
did
that, the hound had vanished and all was quiet.&nbsp;
He said that never happened again but it wasn't too long before he
moved
out and moved Interstate for a year and a half. &nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as you
can see... I'm sitting here
knowing that in a couple of months, my hubby and I will be moving into
this
house with our 7 year old son.&nbsp; Also, my
sister-in-law who is the owner is also moving in but only staying 4
days a week
due to work and uni commitments being closer to her mother's house
where she is
currently living.&nbsp; Her son, my nephew is
also moving back, but he refuses to stay in the house, so he will be
taking the
back room in the garage.&nbsp; I have
experienced many paranormal things, which is why i like to keep an open
mind
with his story. I have also read many stories from people talking about
these
sorts of apparitions, hounds from hell, imps etc.&nbsp; I'm looking
forward to living there because
the house is very nice and it has a lovely swimming pool, but i hope
that if all
my nephew said was true, i hope that 'thing' is gone now.&nbsp; The
current renters of that property wanted
to break their lease as well about 4 months ago, not giving any real
reason but
decided to stay.&nbsp; But they were given
notice last week and don't seem upset in the slightest, to be told to
move
out.&nbsp; It's like they had every intention
of moving.&nbsp; I guess i will be living in
that house soon, and will see for myself. (hopefully i don't see
anything).&nbsp; I've had my fair share of
hauntings and i don't care to experience any more.&nbsp; Anyway, I
thought I would share this.&nbsp; If things do start to happen there,
this will
be the first place I will come to tell my story.&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rockinomega1@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My
name is jordan and I've had several weird experiences at a place called
flint
baptist church. I have a friend who's dad used to be the pastor in that
church.
I used to visit all the time when I was younger. my friend lived in the
pastoral, it was about 200 yards from the church. So on fridays and
saturdays
we would go over to said church and play pool, ping pong,
instruments... ect.
These experiences weren't only felt by me but also by my friend and who
ever
else was there. &nbsp;One night around 12:00
a.m. I can remember we were playing pool and I heard someones voice
upstairs so
I asked my friend if his sister had somehow gotten in, he said no she
doesn't
have a key. I could have sworn I heard 2 women carrying on a
conversation that
night. Another late night we went to find some drumsticks so my friend
could
play drums. We walked into the sanctuary and the door to the baptistry
slammed
shut. We were seriously freaked out. One night we went by the nusery
and it
smelled of fresh talcum powder but the church hadn't had people in it
since 3
days before. My friend had also told me that a baby had died in the
nusery
before his dad was pastor of the church, so that could have explained
the
nursery haunting. About a year ago my friend told me that strange
happenings
were going on in his house. He said he'd seen a woman in a white dress
walking
the house in his kitchen and his hallway. And the rest of his family
has
reported the sightings as well. I spent a good portion of my life at
that house
and I haven't seen anything but I've always felt like something was
following
me down the hallway during the middle of the night</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost
Stalker</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; raesrose@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
grew up in a very big, kinda creepy house in Dallas, Texas.&nbsp; It
had 6 bedrooms and numerous crawlspaces,
even a room that you could only get to through the attic.&nbsp; From
the time I was 8 I could feel something
there.&nbsp; Especially in one particular
corner of my room.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t look in
that corner in the dark, I was certain that I would see
something.&nbsp;
I moved rooms as a teenager to the room
directly below that one, and the same corner gave me trouble.&nbsp;
When I was old enough to move out, I was
hopeful that whatever it was wouldn&#8217;t follow me.&nbsp; It had
progressed to the point where I could
tell where in the room this entity was, and what the expression was on
his
face.&nbsp; Usually it felt he was hateful,
and laughing at me.&nbsp; But when I moved 200
miles away, he followed me.&nbsp; I began
having dreams about him and one night I dreamed that I was running
around,
telling everyone that he was going to get me, but no one would
listen.&nbsp;
I awoke to find him lying on top of me,
trying to get into my body.&nbsp; I was, of
course, petrified and didn&#8217;t move for a solid hour.&nbsp; He was
incredibly angry that he couldn&#8217;t get
in, and eventually faded away.&nbsp; That was
it.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t live like that anymore
and I was determined to take back my life.&nbsp;
Several times he came back, and I was too afraid to do anything, but
one
particular night I was in my apartment alone, playing with cards, and I
felt
him appear in the bedroom door behind me.&nbsp;
And I got pissed.&nbsp; Just the right
emotion for evicting a spirit from your life!&nbsp;
I yelled &#8220;in the name of Jesus get out of my house and my life and
don&#8217;t
EVER come back!&#8221;&nbsp; I think any declaration
would have done, but given my upbringing, that was what came out.&nbsp;
Immediately he was gone, and now 23 years
later, he has not been back.&nbsp; Ghost or
demon, I don&#8217;t know, and I don&#8217;t care! He&#8217;s gone!</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I
come from a large family,..shared a bedroom with 2 older brothers, so I
was
often put to bed in my parents bedroom since my bedtime was much
earlier than
my brothers. &nbsp;And then after I would fall
asleep I would be put in my own bed. One night I remember when I was
about 6 or
7 years old, not long after my parents had bought this antique bedroom
set.
After being sent to bed, I layed there for awhile,not tired at all,
just lay
there awake. I remember looking up because I noticed the room became a
bit
brighter, and standing in front of my mothers dresser ( a low one with
a big
mirror on it ) was a young woman with long black hair just standing
there and
brushing her hair. I wasnt scared at all I remember, in fact I just
kept lying
there and watched her. I couldnt believe my eyes. As I was looking at
her, she
turned her head and looked at me and just smiled, then continued
brushing her
hair. I remember I was looking at her and just wondering who she was. I
had
never seen her before.I even put the blanket over my head at one point
because
I thought she might be gone then, but she was still there when I took
the
banket off again. I had no idea who she was. I noticed she was wearing
a long
blue nightgown that seemd to be almost glowing blue. It must have been
the
smile , or maybe that she didnt seem to be paying too much attention to
me, but
I got out of bed and walked over to her and tried to tug on her
nightgown to
get her </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>attention
but my hand went right through as of nothing was there, but she was
still
there. Again, she looked down at me and smiled. And again, maybe
because she
smiled at me, I wasnt even a little bit scared. So I got back into bed
and just
went to sleep. I never told anybody. About 15 years later my parents
asked me
to watch over their house while they would be away on vacation, so I
did. I
slept in that same room that had the same furniture in it,...not ever
even
thinking twice about my past experience. Nothing happened during the
night. I
was however expecting my girlfriend at the time to stop over the next
morning,
so when I woke up to being kissed on the cheek, I wasnt a bit alarmed.
But when
I rolled over expecting to see my girlfriend ,...no one was there. I
thought
maybe she was playing a trick on me and began looking around the house
for her.
I even went outside to look but no one was around except me. I was
kinda
freaked out so I called her house ( not expecting her to actually even
be there
) and to my surprise...she answered the phone. Now I'm sure alot of
people
would say I was dreaming ( in both cases ) but I am absolutely positive
I was
not. I am 47 years old now and can remember both as if they had
happened last
night. Many years later I did tell my sister who I am very close
to,..and was
very surprised to find out that she had a very similar experience. I
dont tell
many people about it, but when I do,...it does give me the chills for
some
reason.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghosts
In Old El Paso Adobe House</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
33indigo@charter.net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In
the mid-1960's my brother and I stayed for two months in a
hundred-year-old
adobe house in El Paso, Texas, with mud-brick walls so thick that there
were
stairs within the walls. The very first night the resident ghosts
appeared to
both of us.&nbsp; Something awoke my brother,
who saw a figure of an elderly Mexican man, in old-fashioned dress,
leaning
over me, peering down into my face as I slept.&nbsp;
At this very moment I was dreaming that something very opressive was
pushing down upon me, and I began to writhe in my sleep, trying to push
it away
and resist it.&nbsp; My brother feared I might
die of fright in my sleep, so threw his pillow at me to wake me.&nbsp;
As I waked the opressive feeling left and the
figure disappeared.&nbsp; The next morning my
brother spoke to the man who rented the downstairs apartment, who
reported that
he had lived there comfortably with the ghosts for the past twenty
years.&nbsp; "They're only curious as to who you
are," he said.&nbsp; "the man you
saw was the brother, and only appears on the top floor."&nbsp; "The
sister often is seen walking along
the downstairs corridors on moonlight nights, appearing
&nbsp;&nbsp;solid
for a while, then gradually fading out
and fading in again farther along."&nbsp;
"she's very benevolent," he said, "One night she gently
kissed me on the forehead when I was going to sleep."&nbsp; We learned
the history from elderly neighbors
in the area.&nbsp; Eighty years before, in a
fit of rage, the sister had pushed her brother to his death down the </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>stairs,
then walked down the stairs and hung herself from one of the exposed
ceiling
beams.&nbsp; They've been walking the place
ever since.&nbsp; I was very curious myself to
see what I could learn about the afterlife from these beings, so stayed
on for
two months there.&nbsp; When the landlady came
for the rent I asked if she knew the place was haunted.&nbsp; She
immediately went into a panic,
wailing&nbsp; now I'd want to leave, like all
the other renters had done.&nbsp; I reassured
her that I'd be staying on, that I wasn't afraid. Despite my bravado, I
did
find it difficult to get a good night's sleep there. Late at night I'd
wake to
a strong field of some kind of energy hovering directly over me, like
an
electrostatic field produced by rubbing a hard rubber comb until it
picks up
bits of paper.&nbsp; I'd be totally paralyzed
and All the hair on my arms and legs would be standing straight on
end.&nbsp;
The energy fieldwould last about twenty or
thirty seconds, then fade away, and I'd eventually &nbsp;&nbsp;get back
to sleep, only to have it happen
again later in the night.&nbsp; Instead of
fear I'd describe my feeling as totally paralyzing awe, produced by
confronting
something that is absolutely incomprehensible, totally alien,&nbsp;
while I'm still alive, that is, the mystery
of death itself.&nbsp; After more than a month
of this, I wasn't learning any more about these beings, so I began to
think of
some kind of exorcism to quiet down the spirits.&nbsp; I consulted a
local Mexican lady about hiring
a&nbsp; witch, to do a clensing ceremony on
the house.&nbsp; I was warned not to involve
myself with any powerful local sorceress, that I might bring on more
problems
than I eliminated.&nbsp; So, knowing that
these traditional Mexican people of eighty years before were no doubt
devout
Catholics, I borrowed a large silver and ebony crucifix and hung it
directly
above the head of &nbsp;the stairs that the
brother had been pushed down to his death, and all apparitions stoppped
&nbsp;instantly from that moment on, and I slept
soundly for the remainder of my stay in that house.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My
Story and Sara's Story </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
 href="mailto:arnoldb08@yahoo.com">arnoldb08@yahoo.com</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Afternoon, I'm
emailing you today
because I (Arnold) and a friend of mine Sara have &nbsp;had things
happen over the years in both
of&nbsp; our lives.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'll
start with my story, i haven't had nearly as much actively as her, but
since
about 2001 in Las &nbsp;Vegas, NV and I've
lived here since 1996. Very light actively such as tv changing channels
from &nbsp;our first house to my dogs barking or growling
at things not visible in my room or hallway. After we moved to a
different
house a few years later, one morning I was showering for school and i
clearly
remember placing my cell phone in the middle of the counter and heard
something
fall. &nbsp;Mind you my father was at work and
my mother was sleeping and I had both doors locked so no one could
enter and i
found it on the floor and it puzzled me. In later months Ive woken up
with
pressure heavy breathing and sweating for nearly a week straight. We
again
moved in 2007 to a larger brand new home in which I've come to the
conclusion
was sleep paralysis where i was laying in bed i felt my tv switch off
on an
automated timer. Suddenly I felt my eyes open and feel a presences come
towards
me and slowly grip and push down my legs and work its way up to my
upper torso
and head area and lasted about 1&nbsp; min or
more i couldnt speak yell or move </big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>around
from under my sheets. I would occasionaly hear things in that room when
no one
would be up at 1am and even my brother once he moved in again with us
*Richard
-27 at the time would feel things or hear things that wouldn't let him
sleep.
Finally due to the economy we moved in a rental home a year or so later
something semi odd happened i was in my room and no one was home i knew
that
for a fact and my dog, the same one from earlier events, flipping out
in the
living room and my girlfriend at the time went in the kitchen by
herself and
felt really uneasy and unwelcome. &nbsp;&nbsp;</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Now
my friend Sara story,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the summer of
2003, She was about 12 years old living in Modesto, CA she and 3 other
friends
decided to play with a Ouija board in her backroom. One of her friends
did a
ritual of protection, which her friend thought it was a good idea,
after
contacting a younger male spirit for a short period of time and they
were able
to get his age of 24-26 and had a tramatic death in his previous life.
They failed
to close the portal in the board and basically walked away from the
board and
left the way open. Over the next 4 years she would hear knocking from
inside
the walls adjecent the room the Ouija board was messed with previously.
Around
the hours of 12am -4am the power in her room would flick on and off,
the stereo
would turn on, as well as the tv turn off on its own. One night a
friend of
her's woke her up out of a deep sleep to point out a darkness where the
corner
of the backroom and enveloped the whole ceiling covering the ceiling
fan they
both could not see through the blackness. In 2008, She moved to a
different
house within 2 weeks of moving in she started hearing knocking in her
room, Tv
turning on and off, Lights going on and off. Her boyfriend would work
the night
shift and she would be home alone and go in the kitchen, anything left
on the
counter such as : plates, silverware, spice rack, etc. would shift 4-5
inches
in random directions. In 2009, she moved back home where it first
began, on the
first night of moving back in while stadning in the living room facing
the
hallway she saw a darkshadow figure of a younger male at the beginning
of the L
shaped hallway after taking a second glance it was gone. As she went to
walk
down the hallway to go to her room, the end of the hallway acceses the
back
room, there is a floor to ceiling mirror; The door was shut as she was
walking
instead of seeing her self in the mirror as she should of she saw the
same
shadow figure 3 feet of the ground it was as if his knee down were
missing. It
stayed in that fixed postion until she ran in her room and shut the
door.
Within the next year knocking continued and activety followed her as
she moved
3 times in that year alone. On August 7th, 2010, She drove from
Modesto, CA to
Las Vegas, NV while taking the I-15 to cross state line she glanced in
her
mirror and saw a shadow figure in her backseat. I have been friends
with her
since April of 2010 and in the process of her moving back with her dad
and
stepmom I hung out with on a daily basis till classes started on August
30th,
2010. We have both witnessed drawers open in our absence in her bedroom
and
bathroom, doors creaking open when no one is home, the sound of glass
breaking
when nothing&nbsp; has moved or shifted. She
seen a face in her back window one late night we were driving on an
empty
backstreet and even seeing the shadow figure sitting her back seat in
broad
daylight with me next to her in the car. Her fish tank being moved
while she
was out for the night or even in the day. Items being moved in a way
some
intellegence would be nesscary such as her fish net being moved from
the top of
her dresser to under a belt and her tv cord. From August 24th to Now,
it as a
presence of attachment with her whereever she goes from the moment
wakes to the
moment she tries sleep and at times if shes alone it will keep awake
and feels
like a heavy pressure lays upon in times when she drifting to sleep to
her
awake. The night of September 4th, 2010, she&nbsp;
left to go change and get ready around 10:30 at night while I played
Laser tag with friends. She was home alone as she got ready, while
showering
she felt the presence in the bathroom with and in the process of
getting
dressed and putting on her make up she saw a figure walk in her room
thinking
it was her dad she entered after it to find her closet door open with
the light
her phone flung across the room the charger unconnected all her drawers
open
*approximetly 6 drawers* her fish tank yet again moved the tv turned on
and the
computer turned off, and the bed was unmade. she rearragned everything
closed
the drawers and conitnued to get ready as she reenetered her room again
her
phone and charger were off the connection and tossed about 12 feet
across the
room and her closet door closed, she then forgot her charger in her
room she
went back upstairs in which she felt the presence folllow her all the
way to
her car and sit in it with her and has been with her ever since its now
4:28 pm
on September 10th, 2010 it has been 6 days since that night and it has
progressively seem to get worse in where she wont or chooses not speak
about it
even to me.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunted
Condo</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; raesrose@gmail.com</big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When
I was a teenager we went on vacation to Keystone, Colorado and stayed
in a very
nice, open floor plan condo.&nbsp; Everyone
else loved it, I was creeped out the minute I walked in.&nbsp; The
nights were the worst.&nbsp; I felt like there was something going on
all
night long that I couldn't see, but whatever it was, it was
frightening.&nbsp;
One day the family decided to go on an outing,
but I was a few chapters away from the end of a book and I wanted to
finish
it.&nbsp; I unfortunately decided to stay back
alone.&nbsp; They had been gone for about 30
minutes when suddenly there was something right behind me, breathing
down my
neck.&nbsp; It wanted me OUT and out NOW.&nbsp; I jumped up and ran
from the condo and about
30 yards down a forest path before I realized I had left my keycard in
the
condo.&nbsp; Not that I really wanted to go
back in there, but I was locked out and alone.&nbsp;
It turned out to be a pleasant afternoon finishing my book by the
whitewater in the forest, waiting for my family to return.&nbsp; I was
very glad though that we were leaving
for home the next day.&nbsp; I didn't bother
telling my family, they wouldn't have believed me or understood.&nbsp;
I just said I was locked out.</big></p>
