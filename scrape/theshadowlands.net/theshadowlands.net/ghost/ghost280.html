<P><B>Woburn, MA- Valley Rd.</B>
<BR><B>By:&nbsp; Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in this house in the 70's.</B>
<BR><B>The attic was a hole in the ceiling of the closet in the master
bedroom. It was freezing there and often whispers could be heard when the
closet door was opened. We all had a strange feeling of being watched but
the strangest thing that happened occurred on the night we moved out.</B>
<BR><B>My mother was concerned, because we moved early, that if we left
the house empty, vandals would get in. So she and I spent the night with
blankets in the living room. The rest of the rooms were empty.</B>
<BR><B>I don't remember the time, only that it was dark and we were there
only long enough to lie down when we heard a door slam up stairs.</B>
<BR><B>All the windows were closed. We closed and locked them ourselves
when we first arived.</B>
<BR><B>The doors all had a wide gearth so they touched the wall when opened.</B>
<BR><B>What caused the door to slam?</B>
<BR><B>My mother and I grabbed our blankets and left and we never returned.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>By:&nbsp; Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in this house back in 1976. Now it is a realtors place of
business.</B>
<BR><B>In the back room on the first floor there was a blood stain we couldn't
remove. Outside the window a harmonica played.</B>
<BR><B>Our father, a devout Christian, would yell "tell that guy outside
to shut up!" But no one was there. This back room was my parent’s bed room.</B>
<BR><B>My sister and brother and I were fans of Dark Shadows at the time
and thought we'd "investigate" So while our parents were sleeping we left
a tape recorder in the room.</B>
<BR><B>The readers of this story may take the rest of what I am about to
say as reality or fiction.</B>
<BR><B>When we played back the tape there was a lot of distored noise like
wind, and a very muffled, deep voice that said "Help Me". I was 14, my
brother was 15 and my sister 12. The voice was not a child's. Nor was it
my father's who didn't believe in anything he didn't see with his own eyes.&nbsp;
Our dog would bark at the couch in the living room (the room next to my
parents room), and no one would be on the couch. The rocking chair in the
same room would rock with no one in it.</B>
<BR><B>We also had a Lazy Susan. A kind of plate that would spin on a base.
It was my mother's. She couldn't find it when we first moved in, but we
kept hearing it spinning.&nbsp; I will never forget this house. There was
purple and pink leopard wall paper in my bedroom and psychedelic lights
in the living room. Much later I learned that hippies had lived there,
but nothing to explain the paranormal events.</B>
<BR><B>In the basement there was an eerie feeling, and a section of the
cement floor was uncovered about the size of a grave. There was a back
room we used as a play room but we were often driven upstairs by an overwhelming
feeling of being watched by something threatening.</B>

<P><B>Long Island, Bayshore – House on Maple</B>
<BR><B>By: tiekshia@excite.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was told that the house used to be an old boarding house and there
were also devil worshipers living there.&nbsp; My daughter was thrown from
the bed one night.&nbsp; I had a demon in my room, one of the other women
were blessing my room when something touched her, she thought it was my
daughter until she saw a shadow in the closet.&nbsp; The kids will not
go into the basement without screaming for their parents as if they see
something we can't.&nbsp; There is an eerie feeling at the back room of
the basement no one goes there.&nbsp; Things are thrown sometimes and it
always feels like someone is watching you.&nbsp; I have heard whispers
in my ear that no one else had.&nbsp; I heard a low whisper of many voices
in my room get louder like all of the people were getting closer then I
felt a really bad chill up my spine(never happened before and I have had
many ghost encounters).&nbsp; And I think they were upset because another
woman that lived in the house also had splashed holy water around the room.
and things were missing and moving by themselves. Knocking on doors when
reading the bible out loud.&nbsp; Nightmares every night I slept in the
room alone or with my daughter.&nbsp; This place is indeed haunted if I
ever saw one my self and no one really knows about it because the shelter
is confidential, and you don't know until you have to live there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Who Was This?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:Montgomep@co.oswego.ny.us</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am nearing my 40th birthday and throughout my life I have had several
experiences some not as scary as others.&nbsp; I have been witness to some
strange and unexplainable things.&nbsp; One such event happened while spending
the night at my friends house.&nbsp; We were 11 at the time.&nbsp; We had
been told countless numbers of times by her parents to quiet down and go
to bed.&nbsp; When Becky and I finally were able to get into bed, her on
a top bunk me on the bottom, we did some talking and were drifting off
to sleep when we both heard footsteps outside of her bedroom.&nbsp; We
were afraid it was her father checking up on us so we both closed our eyes
and pretended to be sleeping.&nbsp; We heard the door to her bedroom open
and felt a draft.&nbsp; There was a very pleasant smell which neither one
of us could identify.&nbsp; As we laid there with our eyes closed tight
both of us felt a warm breath on our cheeks and a blanket was placed over
each of us.&nbsp; After the person left we able to open our eyes.&nbsp;
We did not think anything of it until in the morning when we talked to
Becky's parents who both told us they did not come into the room.&nbsp;
When we told them the story they asked to see the blankets so we brought
them out.&nbsp; Becky's mother became somewhat pale and told us she had
never seen the blankets before.&nbsp; Someone wanted us to be warm and
made sure we were taken care of.&nbsp; To this day we have no idea who
this person was.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Ramkota Inn - Greeley, Colorado</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: echolobita@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It brings back such memories to see Greeley, Colorado’s Ramkota Inn
listed</B>
<BR><B>in your Haunted Places section. I worked there as a front desk clerk
when I</B>
<BR><B>was 19, nine years ago. I grew up in Greeley, so I’d heard all the
stories</B>
<BR><B>about the woman who’d been thrown off (or threw herself off) the
balcony of</B>
<BR><B>the old Chief Theatre, which was the building that stood on the
ground</B>
<BR><B>before the Ramkota was built. Every Halloween, the Greeley Tribune
featured</B>
<BR><B>entertaining pieces about Rosy, as the woman’s ghost was known,
and I was</B>
<BR><B>always enthralled by the stories. When I started working there,
I couldn’t</B>
<BR><B>get enough of my co-workers' tales. I kept waiting for my own. I
worked</B>
<BR><B>there for about a year and a half and it wasn’t until I’d put in
my two</B>
<BR><B>weeks that I ran into anything remotely paranormal.</B>
<BR><B>One slow Sunday night, I was working alone. There hadn’t been a
banquet or</B>
<BR><B>party in over a week and the hotel was almost completely empty.
My shift was</B>
<BR><B>about over, so it must have been around 10:45 or so. I was finishing
up the</B>
<BR><B>bookkeeping and I happened to look up at the stairs that led to
our banquet</B>
<BR><B>rooms--which were directly across the lobby from the front desk--just
in</B>
<BR><B>time to see a lone red balloon, making its way down the stairs.
It hovered</B>
<BR><B>on the landing and remained there until my co-worker came in at
11:00 to</B>
<BR><B>relieve me. We were both rather frightened, since there hadn’t been
any</B>
<BR><B>parties (thus, no stray balloons) in so many days, and he made me
pop it</B>
<BR><B>before I left him alone for the night shift.</B>
<BR><B>Another night, I was working the evening shift with a fellow desk
clerk,</B>
<BR><B>whom I'll call David. We were working alone—the only other co-worker
around</B>
<BR><B>was our manager-on-duty, who was a woman. The third floor was under</B>
<BR><B>renovations at the time, thus, about half of the rooms were blocked
and</B>
<BR><B>couldn’t be reserved. Due to our computer system, it was literally</B>
<BR><B>impossible to reserve or rent out the rooms. So, when a call came
across the</B>
<BR><B>switchboard from one of the blocked rooms (the room number would
show up on</B>
<BR><B>the switchboard when a call came through—like caller ID), David
and I looked</B>
<BR><B>at each other in disbelief. That particular room was supposed to
be empty. I</B>
<BR><B>made him answer the call. When he hung up, he told me that a man
had been on</B>
<BR><B>the other line and he’d said, rather jovially as though he knew
David well:</B>
<BR><B>“Hi, David! Hey, you wanna bring me up a new remote control? This
one’s not</B>
<BR><B>working!” We weren’t sure what to do. One of us had to stay at the
desk, so</B>
<BR><B>someone would have to go up to the room alone. So, David decided
to do it.</B>
<BR><B>Perhaps you might have said, “No way. Mr. Ghosty’s going to have
to go</B>
<BR><B>without a remote!” but David and I were both curious. So, he made
himself an</B>
<BR><B>electronic key and went up. He came back about ten minutes later,
pale as a</B>
<BR><B>. . . well, extremely pale. He said that when he'd opened the door,
the room</B>
<BR><B>was definitely in renovation mode, but the TV and every single light—even</B>
<BR><B>the lamps—were blaring.</B>
<BR><B>I wish I’d seen Rosy. Most stories came from the housekeeping or
restaurant</B>
<BR><B>staff. And most stories were harmless—Rosy seemed to be just a lonely</B>
<BR><B>spirit, trying to make contact with the living world. Definitely
stay at the</B>
<BR><B>Ramkota next time you’re in that cowtown . . . maybe you’ll have
even better</B>
<BR><B>luck than I did.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Old Shuck</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ochristophersrobbins@qcl.org.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am only twelve, which is why no one has believed me. This story
is not really for me, but for my grandmother who passed away 2 years ago.</B>
<BR><B>This was my grandmother's sighting of a ghost.</B>
<BR><B>I had been staying at my grandmothers for a week and before dinner
we decided to take a walk,</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother's house was situated in Norfolk and there are lots
of nice roads to walk along and eat</B>
<BR><B>Blackberries .we was walking when a shiver went down my back and
this ticked my nose. I hung back to sneeze, and when I straighten</B>
<BR><B>Up my grand mother was deathly pale, and looked rather ill.</B>
<BR><B>I asked what the matter was and she could only reply dog. I took
her home and made her a cup of tea,</B>
<BR><B>And when she calmed down she told me she saw a big dog, black with
yellow eyes. Then it had just</B>
<BR><B>Disappeared. I was always very fond of my grandmother but then I
wasn't sure I believed her,</B>
<BR><B>But it did make me think. The next day I went to the library and
got all I could on ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>I found a dictionary on them and I looked it up, I found a chapter
on a ghost called the</B>
<BR><B>"Old shuck". It was the ghost of a dog that fitted my grandmother's
description exactly.</B>
<BR><B>I also read that if you see the ghost then a year from then, you
would die.</B>
<BR><B>I was quite disturbed at this piece of information, and decided
to ignore it.</B>
<BR><B>Then, a year later, my grandmother got cancer and died.</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother was a healthy person,</B>
<BR><B>And she was only 65 .</B>
<BR><B>I couldn't find a logical explanation</B>
<BR><B>And I am still puzzled to this day.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Not My Imagination</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Scrogginscottage@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story happened along time ago about 1979-80 when I was around
15 years old. It was a Saturday evening in the summer of Northern England
where I live and every weekend I would stay at my grandparents house. This
particular Saturday my Gran had gone to my uncles to baby sit and I followed
around two hours later. I had two routes I could walk, I&nbsp; could go
along the road or along the canal bank and across the railway crossing
( I decided on the latter). The day was very clear and sunny and quite
warm, it was around 6.00pm in the evening. I knew the walk would take about
half hour and just set off, I walked the canal without a soul in site it
was around half mile then had to leave at a lane that went over the railway
track. I started the walk on the lane and was around 20 yards down just
before the railway crossing when I distinctly heard very audibly a childs
voice coming from the derelict building to the left of me, my main instinct
was he (sounded like a boy) was in trouble and was calling for his Grandad
so I decided to go in, the building wast open at the front and had no windows
(they were all broken). I ent in calling for the child and went to where
I thought the voice came from. I searched and searched but no child, the
voice always seemed to be far away, I must have spent 15 minutes looking
around and shouting. In the end I gave up went back to the road where the
voice was still clear and audible, I carried on my way and thought it was
either a ghost or my very vivid imagination.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Never Underestimate the Power</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bored_as_hell03@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. I just want to say first of all, that i love this site!! And
i love ghosts and ghouls and things like that!! I have a story to tell,
and it happened 6 months ago!! Im 13. I was on holiday with my ma and pa
in Florida. We were staying at a hotel, and i was alone as they had gone
down to the lobby to check out times for activities. I was on my bed, reading,
when i heard the bath start to run, then stop. I heard this about 4 or
5 times.&nbsp; Then it turned on, and kept running. At the time, i didnt
believe in ghosts or anything. I went into the bathrom and there was a
woman leaning over the side of the bath, with her hands in the water. For
some reason, i wasnt scared at all!! But as i got closer, i saw that the
woman had her hands around a samll bois neck, pushing him under the water.
She looked up at me and screeched " You want to join him kiddie???" I ran
like crazy!! Out of the room!! Without the key!! When i found my ma and
pa, we checkd out. When i got home i did some research on the hotel and
them particular rooms, number 156ab. It turned out that a depresses moth
of one boy had stayed their, for a booked week, but only made it 3&frac12;
days. She had got really p****d off with him, and told him to take a bath
and killed him that night. Then the next day she hanged herself through
guilt. Well, i hope you like my story. All i know now is, that i will NEVER
underestimate the power of ghosts.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Best Friend's Mother Said Good-Bye To Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AAlphaComp@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am 25 yrs old and have been best friends with Katie since first
grade.&nbsp; Her mother was always sweet and she and I shared the same
astrological sign, Aquarius.&nbsp; Sadly, when Katie and I were 20 her
mother was diagnosed with liver cancer.&nbsp; A year later, during the
summer, when Katie and I were 21, her mother was extremely sick already,
the doctors and family knew that the illness was terminal, but nobody knew
how much longer she could live.&nbsp; Doctors said she could live for another
3 months to a year.&nbsp; Anyway, we all lived on Long Island, NY, but
I was going to Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, Connecticut.&nbsp;
So before I left for school I went to the hospital with Katie to visit
her mom.&nbsp; She looked awful, but I was hopeful for her, for Katie's
sake.&nbsp; I went to school in September.</B>
<BR><B>Sometime in mid October on a Sunday I was looking through a J Crew
magazine and I thought to myself "It looks like fun to be a model for J
Crew".&nbsp; That Sunday night, I dreamed that my mother and I were in
the waiting room for a modeling agency, and we were going to model for
the J Crew cataloug.&nbsp; We were sitting in chairs looking through magazines,
there was a receptionist desk to the left of us, and the exit/entrance
was to our right.&nbsp; The person at the receptioist desk was blurry.&nbsp;
All of the sudden, Katie's mom breezed in!!! She looked radiant, had a
smile on, so bright and happy, I've never seen her look like that.&nbsp;
She wore a white outfit, pants, blouse, boots, and a puffy vest (looked
like down).&nbsp; The outfit looked like something from the 80's, but she
looked great in it.&nbsp; She waved to me, then vanished into the wall
behind the receptionist desk.&nbsp; I knew , as soon as she waved, that
she died.&nbsp; I knew it with all my heart and soul, there was no doubt
in my mind, that she had just died and said good bye to me.&nbsp; Still
dreaming, I turned to my mom, and I said " Mom, that was Katie's mom she
just died and said bye to me. Did you see her?'" and Mom said "no, I didn't".&nbsp;
Then my dreamed ended.&nbsp; I hadn't talked or emailed Katie since I left
in September, I didn't know about her moms condition at the time.&nbsp;
In the morning, Monday, I told my roommates the dream, and said "Wouldn't
it be freaky if Katie's mom really did die?".&nbsp; On Tuesday,&nbsp; Katie
called me and told me her mom had been comatose for several days, and died
on Monday, early in the morning.</B>
<BR><B>I never told Katie.&nbsp; Still haven't.&nbsp; I don't understand
why her mom said goodbye to me.&nbsp; I always liked her, but I was best
friends with her daughter, not her.&nbsp; Anyway, a year later Katie visited
me at school, and on the one year anniversary of her mother's death, she
showed me a picture of her and her mother when Katie was about 3.&nbsp;
Her mother, had the same smile she had in my dream, and she wore a very
similar outfit!</B>
<BR><B>Weird huh?!&nbsp; Thanks.</B>

<P><B>This is a story about what happened to my best friend.&nbsp; I don't
remember the</B>
<BR><B>exact date and time, but I do know it happened in 1978. Today I'm
51 years</B>
<BR><B>old and my best friend is 47 years old.&nbsp; We don't really talk
about it much,</B>
<BR><B>only that we do know it really happened, and it's just between us
and you</B>
<BR><B>readers that believe.</B>
<BR><B>Lois, (not her real name), moved into a small 4 room house right
next door</B>
<BR><B>to me, it was a nice cozy looking little house, it had a white picket
fence</B>
<BR><B>around it and flowers in the front yard.&nbsp; No one lived in the
house as long</B>
<BR><B>as I and my husband lived next door which was about 5 years.&nbsp;
There was</B>
<BR><B>always an older gentleman that would keep the house from disrepair.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, one day Lois told me that she got a great deal on a house
rental,</B>
<BR><B>and guess what?, it was right next door to me!</B>
<BR><B>We were both escatic about this, so right away I helped her move
in.&nbsp; She</B>
<BR><B>finally got her own place, for she definitely wanted to get out
from under</B>
<BR><B>her mother's wing.&nbsp; The house was so cute!&nbsp; And it was
furnished!&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>furniture was antique!&nbsp; It was perfect for her.&nbsp; She loved
the little house.</B>
<BR><B>She had a good job working for a trucking company as a bookkeeper.&nbsp;
And she</B>
<BR><B>was single!</B>
<BR><B>Lois moved in with my help, and everything was perfect the first
2 weeks.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>noticed something was bothering her during the third week she lived
in the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; She would come over to my house and visit till the
wee hours of the</B>
<BR><B>night and fall asleep on the couch.&nbsp; She did this for about
a week and</B>
<BR><B>finally I asked her to tell me what was wrong, cause I couldn't
stand it any</B>
<BR><B>longer.</B>
<BR><B>Finally she told me that I probably wouldn't believe her if she
told me what</B>
<BR><B>was happening in the house.&nbsp; I said don't say that, you are
my best friend</B>
<BR><B>and I am here to help, is someone bothering you, should we call
the police?</B>
<BR><B>Lois is a very truthful and honest person, and very loyal friend.&nbsp;
She told</B>
<BR><B>me that something was in the house, and that she thought it was
a spirit.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>told her, I believed her, I grew up in a family that believed in
the spirit</B>
<BR><B>world.&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me that during the day and even at night,
the spirit would</B>
<BR><B>open and close the cupboards, and she could hear shuffling of feet
going</B>
<BR><B>across the kitchen floor, and sometimes she would smell Ben-Gay,
or</B>
<BR><B>Mentholatum in the air.&nbsp; She said the spirit would even take
a shower, she</B>
<BR><B>could actually hear it get into the shower stall, and turn on the
water</B>
<BR><B>faucet, but when she would go into the bathroom, NOTHING!!! Lois
said this</B>
<BR><B>happened anytime during the day and night.</B>
<BR><B>It got to the point, to where I would have to stay with her at night
until</B>
<BR><B>she got sleepy, then I would leave.&nbsp; These happenings never
went on when I</B>
<BR><B>was there, and we couldn't understand why.&nbsp; But of course I'm
not intune to</B>
<BR><B>the spirit world as she is.&nbsp; Lois never slept in the bedroom
because she</B>
<BR><B>swore someone was always on the bed, she could hear the bed creak,
when they</B>
<BR><B>moved, and even hear their snoring!&nbsp; She was determined to
live in the</B>
<BR><B>house, and did not want to move back in with her mother.&nbsp; I
wanted her to</B>
<BR><B>move in with me, until she found another place, and she wasn't for
that idea</B>
<BR><B>either, she said I and my husband definitely needed our privacy.</B>
<BR><B>One morning, around 4:30 a.m., I heard our door open, I knew it
was Lois</B>
<BR><B>because she was the only one we gave a house key to.&nbsp; I got
up because it</B>
<BR><B>was so early in the morning.&nbsp; Sure enough it was Lois, she
was sitting on</B>
<BR><B>our couch in her PJ's breathing very hard.&nbsp; I was very concerned,
I turned</B>
<BR><B>on the light, she was very pale.&nbsp; I asked her if she was sick,
I wanted to</B>
<BR><B>take her to the emergency room.&nbsp; Finally, she took a few deep
breaths and</B>
<BR><B>calmed down, I got her a glass of water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lois told me,
"I am not going to</B>
<BR><B>live in that house anymore, I've had enough!"&nbsp; "I'm moving
out today, and</B>
<BR><B>your going to help me, I'm moving out today.!"&nbsp; I told her
well okay, I'll</B>
<BR><B>help you.&nbsp; Lois told me,&nbsp; " You would't believe what happened,
I woke up and</B>
<BR><B>looked toward the kitchen doorway, and right in the middle of the
doorway</B>
<BR><B>was a glowing ball, about the size of a basketball." "It was forming
a shape</B>
<BR><B>like a lamp and getting bigger, I closed my eyes thinking I was
dreaming and</B>
<BR><B>pinched myself, I was not dreaming!" " I closed my eyes again, and
shouted</B>
<BR><B>out, Dammit!, Leave Me Alone!", I opened my eyes and it was gone,
that's</B>
<BR><B>when I raced out of that damn house and ran over here.!"</B>
<BR><B>Well, Lois moved out of the house and back in with her mother, waiting
for</B>
<BR><B>the day when she could move out again.&nbsp; We looked up the history
of the</B>
<BR><B>house and found out that a widow lived in the house.&nbsp; She was
around 88</B>
<BR><B>years old, and had meals delivered to her at noon.&nbsp; The lady

<BR><B>I Need Guardian Angels</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kai_2003_17@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have never actually seen a ghost before. Since I have been about
14 I started feeling like someone is always watching me now, so all the
time i am looking around me. I remember when my friend died about two years
ago she was 16 and was in a car accident. I have never told anyone this
because sometimes i think that i just dreamt about her that night. Well
it was December 30th and she was coming back from her friends house that
night. We aren't really sure what happened except everyone thinkings she
was trying to turn the radio up, the road she was driving on has no shoulders
and lots of people have died on it. We think she ran off the road a little
then finally swerved to the other side but then finally lost control of
her car and hit a tree and she was instantly killed. One thing i remember
about that is i am a nightowl and that night i remember remember feeling
like something bad was going to happen that night, but never thought about
it much. I remember the next morning my mother waking me up and saying
that she had been killed at first i didn't react but then i ha realized
i lost my friend. I am always seeing stuff out of the corner of my eyes
but when i turn to look there is no one there alot of my families and friends
have</B>
<BR><B>died. And it always seems like i am being watched! I read alot of
stories on your website, I would really like to get in learning some more
things, i would also love to see a ghost. I know i would be freaked out
but maybe just some want to be helped so they can go wherever they are
going. who knows? I would love to hear more stories, i have always believed
in ghosts and i think i always will. Also another thing that happened to
me this year when i was at a camp was i took alot of pics and it seem alot
with me and friends there are alot of mist and stuff and streaks in the
pictures that caught me by surprise when i looked at your site. Maybe they
just like to follow me and make I sure hope so cause i need guardian angels!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Greenville, AL haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jmcgough@hvc.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>There is a house on Ft. Dale Rd. that is haunted.&nbsp; My sister
was so scared that she refused to step foot in the house again about 6
months before we moved out.&nbsp; There were several spirits there.&nbsp;
One was a man that would just stand and watch you from the doorway of one
of the bedrooms.&nbsp; Another was a little boy.&nbsp; Late at night, my
sister saw him run through the kitchen and into the dining room.&nbsp;
Later on, my two brothers were trying to go to sleep in there room.&nbsp;
The oldest thought my younger brother was messing with him by tapping him
on the shoulder.&nbsp; When he was finally fed up with the younger denying
it and he sat up, the comforter on both beds went flying off without either
touching it and they saw the little boy run out of the room.&nbsp; My younger
sister repeatedly saw faces in our bedroom.&nbsp; My mother saw a floating
mass in her bedroom, which I later saw on the last night we slept there
hovering about my younger brother.&nbsp; My sister said that every night
she could feel somebody tuck her in and this same spirit later helped her
to my mother the day she collapsed and was paralyzed for a week or two.&nbsp;
There were lights that darted around the house that couldn't have possibly
been from car headlights.&nbsp; My oldest brother was playing around on
night and was trying to take a picture of whatever it was(he was in his
2o's at the time) and something came face to face with him and he lost
his breath.&nbsp; Later that week, my mother got scared and wanted my oldest
brother to sleep in the room with me.&nbsp; Just about the time that he
dozed off, something grabbed him and threw him up against the headboard.&nbsp;
He doesn't scare easily it being that he has been in the military special
forces, but he was truly scared that night.&nbsp; The last day we were
there, my mother made my sister go back into the house one last time.&nbsp;
My sister was in our old bedroom and said she saw something that resemble
to her a demon.&nbsp; I didn't believe in things like this until I lived
in that house.&nbsp; Recently, my mother was approached by the woman that
bought the house after we moved out.&nbsp; She asked my mother if we ever
had any "visitors".&nbsp; My mother's reply was, "Oh, you mean the ghost?"&nbsp;
The people have been hearing and seeing things too.&nbsp; They've only
lived there for a couple of years and are now in the process of selling
the house because they can't stand the things that are happening any more.&nbsp;
Just so you know, Ft. Dale Rd. used to be one of the main routes taken
by the Confederate soldiers during the Civil War.&nbsp; There were several
attacks along that road.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Grandma's Phone Call</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: carbine_master@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 12 years old, my grandmother died.&nbsp; She must have
been 69 or 70 at the time, but she was a very active and vigorous woman.&nbsp;
She had a force of personality that could be felt across the largest of
rooms.&nbsp; Most people, even total strangers just felt drawn to her,
and this made her the natural center of attention at social events.&nbsp;
I loved her very much.&nbsp; I was her very first grandchild, and I always
felt very close to her.&nbsp; It’s hard to put into words, but she just
seemed so alive, like she was full of light and merriment.&nbsp; I never
thought about life without her, although by 12 I was old enough to understand
that no one lives forever in this world.&nbsp; She was not struck down
by old age, though.&nbsp; She died in a horrible car accident.&nbsp; Mom
and dad never told me the details, and believe me that’s just fine.&nbsp;
But what bothers me is that on the day that she died, I was playing by
myself.&nbsp; The phone rang.&nbsp; I answered it (I had just been given
the privilege of staying home by myself).&nbsp; It was grandma on the phone.&nbsp;
She sounded very sad.&nbsp; She told me that she had to go away on a long
trip.&nbsp; She said that she loved me very much.&nbsp; I asked how long
she’d be gone, and she said she didn’t know, but it would be a very long
time.&nbsp; I asked her if I could go with her, and she said no.&nbsp;
She didn’t give me the chance to say anything else.&nbsp; She just said
again that she loved me, and hung up.&nbsp; It was the weirdest conversation
I’d ever had with her, and it was about to get even more weird.&nbsp; My
parents got home half-an-hour later, and my mom was crying.&nbsp; I told
her Grandma had called.&nbsp; She looked at me like I had said something
terrible.&nbsp; It was then that I learned what had happened.&nbsp; They
told me that Grandma had died two hours before as the result of her injuries,
but I had just received the call 30 minutes ago.&nbsp; Over the next couple
of days, I tried to talk to both of my parents about this, but neither
mom or dad would listen.&nbsp; Now I’m 25.&nbsp; I have never been able
to let go of this.&nbsp; I didn’t imagine it!&nbsp; It only happened this
one time, much to my regret.&nbsp; There is no doubt in my mind that that
was her voice on the phone.&nbsp; I would know her voice anywhere!&nbsp;
My parents still will not speak with me about it, and I have long since
given up on ever getting any sense of closure.&nbsp; Have I gone off the
deep end?&nbsp; After I looked at your web page, I got the feeling that
you people might be able to tell me what happened.&nbsp; Did I experience
something real?</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Ghosts all Around</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: redhott_182003@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>well lets start with my house in Jackson MI. The ghost in this house
only came at people as a joke more than any thing else. It lock my grandmother
in her room from the out side when noone was home so she had to wait intill
my mom and I got home. This other time I was sleeping with my dog (that
has no tail) and there was something hiting my pillow and the dog was on
the other side, when i woke up and looked there was a face right there.
We moved out of that house and down to Morenci MI. Now this house i have
only seen the ghost twice. The first time was when it came up the basement
stairs and turned and looked at me and when I said some thing it turned
and walked back down stairs. The other time was when I was working down
in the basement and i felt some one looking at me so I turned around and
there it was looking at me and then it was gone</B>

<P><B>Ann</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tjburden@mts.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>It all started when we moved into an old one room school house in
the town of Oak Bank, Manitoba and that is where the story begins.&nbsp;
It was in the early 1980's I was about 8 years old when we moved to that
house and a lot of things happened there some can be explained others we
still question to this day.&nbsp; The house is set on 3 achier property
and the closest neighbor is 1/4 mile away and it is all gravel roads and
very dark. My mom my self and my 2 sisters where at home one day and my
dad was gone for the weekend so a friend of my moms came over with her
kids and we were all in the living room area at the opposite end of the
house to the door the door was locked and we made sure of that there.&nbsp;
We were all sitting watching a movie and all of a sudden it sounded like
the door opened and there were foot steps up the 3 steps to the main floor
of the house (school room) so my mom got up and checked and the door was
still locked and no one had come in to the house.&nbsp; this happened about
7 or 8 times that night.&nbsp; then as quickly as it started it stopped
the next night it was the same thing but this time you could hear laughter
of children in the yard in the back of the house so when you looked out
the windows there was no one there the door opened and closed and lots
of laughter and voices filled the room and then went silent as they got
past the wall to the living room.&nbsp; Getting more and more scared we
all slept in the same room that&nbsp; night.&nbsp; Time had passed and
the construction on the house began the house was getting an addition built.&nbsp;
the door opening and closing stopped but the laughing in the yard never
did.&nbsp; moving forward to the later part of the 80's I was 16 now and
I was baby sitting my cousins who at the time were 6 and 4 and they were
in the living room and I was in the kitchen.&nbsp; I say a little girl
out of the corner of my eye run past me so I turned my head right away
and said my cousins name and her brother said no shes sleeping on the floor
right here and I was ok sorry.&nbsp; the figure ran toward the basement
stairs and vanished I went back to the living room and my cousin asked&nbsp;
if I seen her to and I was who and he said the little girl she was there
at the steps and was smiling I asked what she was wearing to compare to
what I seen and it was the same little girl in a white dress with pink
ribbon and long blond hair and big blue eyes with white shoes on and she
was a little girl about 5 or 6 years old so I told him to forget it we
will watch TV till our moms come home and we were so scared we refused
to move our moms came home and we told them what we had seen and no faster
did we tell them but you heard a ruckus in the pool in the yard it had
a 6 foot high chain link fence with locks on the gates so no one could
get in with out the keys.&nbsp; the ruckus got more and more louder so
I decided to go investigate it I opened the door and clicked on the light
and in the pool were 2 large dogs thinking they belonged to the neighbor
we called him and he came over and got the dogs out and they did not belong
to him they ran toward the back of the yard and vanished.&nbsp; Time went
on about a month or 2 passed and my mom was in the kitchen with a bag on
the counter and from the other side she seen a little girls hand reach
up grab the bag and pull it off the counter no one was near the kitchen
when this happened but my mom she blamed us till it happened again to her
the next day and she seen the little girl run past to ward the basement
again she yelled to me and I cam running she described the little girl
to me and I told her that is what I seen to that night.&nbsp; we would
find a childs hand prints on furniture and on mirrors the radio would go
on full blast in a room that was for guests dolls and toys would be scattered
about the basement floor and I was the youngest at 17 years old at this
time we would go to have a shower and the lights would not work and the
shower doors would rattle violently and when that would happen it was a
very uneasy feeling in the house then a figure of a large dark man appeared
and the little girl would not be around to leave her hand prints on the
dresser in front of the mirror violent things happened when he would appear
our pet parrot died of a broken neck and the car brakes would fail as you
would be coming in to the yard when some one was in the driveway the water
in the shower would go scolding hot when there is no one else home to run
water to do that.&nbsp; The worst thing was a Ouija board that was in the
basement for years was all of the sudden in the middle of the basement
floor it had been in the house for a long time and never touched till this
figure appeared in the house then one day a man came to the door and asked
if his mother can come and see the old school that she used to teach at
and we undoubtedly said yes to her request and she walked through the house
and remembered what is used to be like there we had asked if any one had
ever died on that property that she could recall and she did a little girl
named Ann she was killed in the back yard in the back of the yard by a
baseball it hit her in the head and killed her unfortunate accident and
we described her to this lady and she said that is what she was buried
in over 60 prior to and she was wondering how we knew so much about her
it was a never talked about thing so we told the story to the lady and
her son and to their amazement little Ann had appeared it was like she
wanted to say hello again she was 5 years old when she passed&nbsp; she
was buried at the cemetery 1 1/4 miles away form the school and was not
ready to leave it was her first year in school I would have loved to had
more to the Ann story than i do but the house burned down in 1991 and I
have gone back to the property at night and you can still hear the children
laughing in the yard if Ann is still there I do not know but I will go
back with a camera and listen for the voices and then take a picture and
hopefully I get a picture of Ann to share</B>

<P><B>When Ghosts Attack</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: georgie_gooch@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was young I lived in a very old four story house in the oldest
neihborhood in the city of Calgary. As a child I was very sensitive to
the things that were going on around me and still am.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Strange things started to happen one night when I was about
nine years old, I suddenly woke up to the sound of heavy breathing, which
might not seam that unusual considdering I lived with my dad and my brother
but I had long become accustomed to the noises that they made so this was
very odd. I was trying to get back to sleep when all of a sudden my cat
Sheba started growling, and it seemed that in unison both the hair on her
back and the hair on my neck stood up at the same time and the room whent
ice cold.</B>
<BR><B>I looked out into the hallway and I saw what I can only describe
as a shadow, walk from one end of the hall to the other. Only it wasnt
really walking it was more like it was limping. I could faintly see the
outline of rags hanging off it's back. After it disapeared the room temperature
whent back to normal.</B>
<BR><B>When is was finaly old enough to stay home alone things started
to get really strange. Most place where I spent most of my time when I
was alone was in the sub basement right abouve the bedrooms watching tv
with my cat sleeping across my lap. I would be watching my favorite programs
when suddenly I would here a door slam when no one was there and none of
the windows were open so the wind couldn't have pushed it closed. After
the door would slam I would hear footsteps going down the stairs and comming
closer and closer to me and then as soon as my cat woke up hissing the
footsteps would run back upstairs, open and then slam the door closed.</B>
<BR><B>After about a year of this happening, the entity became violent
with me. Durring the night I would have horrible nightmares and would wake
up the next morning with scratches all over my body, I would be pushed
down the stairs and violently attacked when I landed. It got to a point
where I would have things thrown at me if I was alone in a room.</B>
<BR><B>Nobody would believe me until one day when my dad walked in the
house just in time to see my being shoved down the stairs. That night he
packed me and my brother up and we stayed in a hotel until we could find
a new house.</B>
<BR><B>I just did some reserch about the area and the house in which I
lived and found out that it was the site of a brutal murder suicide. I
still get uneasy feelings when I'm at the top of a stair case so just in
case I have had ever house that I have lived in blessed just to make sure.</B><B></B>

<P><B>the Hill House in Streator Illinois</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: germanchix71@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
many stories surrounding the Hill house in Streator.</B>
<BR><B>Built by the Hill family its many hauntings are of course surrounding
them.</B>
<BR><B>The full history of this house and family can be found in the book
Biography</B>
<BR><B>in Black (a history of Streator). But here is a quick rundown.&nbsp;
The son of</B>
<BR><B>the hill family was known to have a gambling problem,&nbsp; his
mother, having</B>
<BR><B>found out that he was forging checks in her name confronted her
son, who</B>
<BR><B>subsequently murdered her and burried her in the coal cellar while
his</B>
<BR><B>father was away.&nbsp; The father later committed suiced with a
gun to his head</B>
<BR><B>in the den.&nbsp; The son, never having been found guilty, later
died in a plane</B>
<BR><B>crash.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been
in the and talking to former residents, there have</B>
<BR><B>been reports of a child crying,&nbsp; it was rumored that Mrs. Hill
had abused</B>
<BR><B>her child.&nbsp; Also are reports of angry piano playing even though
there is no</B>
<BR><B>piano in the residence.&nbsp; Apparitions have been seen in the
windows of the</B>
<BR><B>home as well.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The home
has been empty for many years and many attempts have been</B>
<BR><B>made to remodel the home, so far none have been fully completed.&nbsp;
The home</B>
<BR><B>is now owned by another man who is currently remodeling it, I have
not been</B>
<BR><B>able to enter the home since then, the new owner is nearly impossible
to</B>
<BR><B>contact, I haven't succeeded yet</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Face</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AmeNoTenshi1@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My experiences have been going on for a number of years now. My first
experience was when I was ten years old. It was in the evening and I was
getting ready for bed and what not, and when my parents came into say good
night the power went out because of a rtaher violent storm outside. Well,
that was all fine and dandy but right after they left the power went out
again and right in front me was this humongous face, it had an expression
of complete and utter evil. I was so frightened by it that I couldn't even
move let alone scream for my parents whose bedroom was right across the
hall.&nbsp; It seemed like an eternity before the power finaly blipped
back on and I bolted to my parents room in a completely hysterical state.
They didn't seem to concerned about it though. From that day on I have
refused to sleep without a light on in my room for fear of seeing that
awful face again. After that I started feeling small thing about me. Like
getting a sudden feeling that something was watching me. Usually I felt
this while on the computer which was located in my brother's room. One
time in the evening I was online chatting with some friends when I got
an incredibly overwhelming feeling that I was being watched even though
there was nobody else was in the room. Well, there was this painting that
hung on the wall of an old man and the feeling of being stared at seemed
to be coming from it. I tried to ignore it until the feeling finaly intensified
so much that i felt like I was&nbsp; going to choke. I quickly got up and
left the room and started sobbing as I told my mom about it. My mom seemed
genuinely concerned about it and took the painting off the wall and stuck
it in a closet. Another time I was sitting on the computer I suddenly felt
the weight of a hand resting on my shoulder and when I turned around to
see what it was nothing was there.</B>
<BR><B>We moved from that house about 2 years ago to a rather small city
that also happens to be incredibly old. The neighborhood we live in used
to consist of a lot of plantations back in the 1800's or so. In this house
my room is the only room on the second floor of the house so I'm pretty
much seperated from everybody else in the house while I'm up here. One
night I was laying on my bed and listening to some music when I heard this
horrible racket coming from right outside my window. It was this awful
high pitched screeching sound, it was definitely not a natural sound. And
so I got up from my bed and pulled open the shades, despite being horrified
at what I might find, and there was nothing there, there was not a single
trace of there being anything out there. More recently though I have begun
to see dark shadowy things floating around my room very late at night.
I still sometimes get the feeling of being watched but not enarly as instense
as on that one occassion. Sometimes I'll be sitting on the computer when
this dark shape will just "fly" over me and the computer and disappear.
And that's all there really is to say about my experiences. Thank you for
your time.</B>

<P><B>I know this is like so many other stories but I couldn't help myself
from</B>
<BR><B>sharing my families experiences.</B>
<BR><B>Four years ago my son and I moved into our apartment and were expecting
my</B>
<BR><B>second&nbsp; child's birth. Everything at first was strange of course
because I</B>
<BR><B>had never lived in an apartment so all the noises were wierd to
both of us.</B>
<BR><B>And we had never lived in town.</B>
<BR><B>About a month after we were settled in we had set up our soon to
be "little</B>
<BR><B>sister's" bed and put away all the clothes that had been gifts at
the</B>
<BR><B>shower, and had set down to watch some tv. I got to thinking how
I had</B>
<BR><B>wished I had thought to shut the bedroom light off when we left
the&nbsp; room,</B>
<BR><B>when it went out. I looked around and my son was sitting on the
floor in</B>
<BR><B>front of the chair where I was so I knew it wasnt him. I dismissed
it.</B>
<BR><B>Two weeks later I was coming in from work (12 hour shift at hospital)
and</B>
<BR><B>was thinking how good it would feel to have a hot bathe before I
went to</B>
<BR><B>pick up my son. I walked into the apartment to hear water running
and</B>
<BR><B>panicked. I thought I had accidently left water running while I
was at</B>
<BR><B>work,,,imagine that bill. I ran into the bathroom to find the tub
full of</B>
<BR><B>steaming water and my candles burning,,,I freaked. I was a single
mother</B>
<BR><B>and no one was supposed to be in my apartment!! Even my mother didnt
have a</B>
<BR><B>key yet!! I ran out of there realllll quick. I ran to the babysitters</B>
<BR><B>house..no small feat with me being 7 months pregnant and dragged
her back</B>
<BR><B>up there with me. We walked in and down the hall to the bathroom.
The tub</B>
<BR><B>was empty and the candles were not lit,, she looked at me like i
was</B>
<BR><B>insane,,,but she did say it was humid in the bathroom as if the
water had</B>
<BR><B>been running,,,and she could smell my candles but they hadnt been
burned</B>
<BR><B>the wicks werent even blackened.</B>
<BR><B>I dismissed this as a tired mind,,,,maybe I was wishing so much
for that</B>
<BR><B>bathe that I convinced myself the tub was full and the candles were</B>
<BR><B>burning,or I was going insane.Hey with my families past I could
believe it.</B>
<BR><B>Well I called my mother that evening and told her about it and we
laughed</B>
<BR><B>she said I had to be losing my mind to think that had happened .
I agreed</B>
<BR><B>with her,,,well someone decided to let me know otherwise.</B>
<BR><B>That same night I heard something in the kitchen,, my heart stopped
my son</B>
<BR><B>was sleeping in the other room and here I am pregnant and someone
has</B>
<BR><B>broken into my apartment. Then I got mad,,,,how dare someone!! I
walked</B>
<BR><B>into that kitchen ready to kick butt,,,,,and froze. Now there is
only one</B>
<BR><B>door to my kitchen and I had heard these noises right up to the
point I</B>
<BR><B>walked in and there is no where to hide in this apartment trust</B>
<BR><B>me,especially the kitchen. There was no one in the kitchen,, but
all the</B>
<BR><B>doors were open and all my dishes were stacked all over the room,,,,instead</B>
<BR><B>of in the cabinets. My refrigerator was standing open and all the
food was</B>
<BR><B>stacked on the floor. I screamed ran in grabbed my son and got the
heck out</B>
<BR><B>of there. We stayed the night with my mother.</B>
<BR><B>The next day we had her neighbor a local cop go in with us and he
looked</B>
<BR><B>around.He and I looked through all the rooms and found nothing and
no signs</B>
<BR><B>of forced entry and he laughed and asked my why I had taken all
my dishes</B>
<BR><B>out of the cabinets was I moving out already?! He thought it was
funny. I</B>
<BR><B>said no that was how I found them when I walked in there,,I told
him the</B>
<BR><B>food was on the floor in front of the fridge too. He walked back
out of the</B>
<BR><B>kitched and said um no its not the fridge is fine,but you dishes
are</B>
<BR><B>everywhere. I just stood there. What was going on?</B>
<BR><B>Well he left and my mother and I finished putting dishes away and</B>
<BR><B>straightening up the kitchen and my mother asked me if I was alright
and</B>
<BR><B>left after I said yes.My son was at daycare and I was home alone
and</B>
<BR><B>decided since I didnt have to pick him up for a while I was going
to lay</B>
<BR><B>down. I took off my watch and rings and laid them on the table next
to the</B>
<BR><B>bed which was my habit and laid down and napped. I woke up about
two hours</B>
<BR><B>later and was getting ready to pick up my son and realized the watch
and</B>
<BR><B>rings were missing. I looked around the bed and figured I knocked
them off</B>
<BR><B>and would find them when I got back home. When we returned my son
went to</B>
<BR><B>get some juice out of the fridge while I was looking for my watch
and ring</B>
<BR><B>and what does he find but the watch and ring in the fridge of all
places.</B>
<BR><B>I just knew I was losing my mind. That night I heard noises from
my son's</B>
<BR><B>room and thought he was up playing,,,I walked in and felt a cool
wind pass</B>
<BR><B>me in the hall,,my son was sound asleep.</B>
<BR><B>I walked into the living room and just sat down,,I looked around
the room</B>
<BR><B>and decided whatever or whoever it was needed to know I knew it
was there</B>
<BR><B>finally.So I looked around again an quietly said that if it was
happy here</B>
<BR><B>I had no problems with it,,I didnt appreciate what it was doing
the jokes</B>
<BR><B>and pranks,,,especially if it was going to scare me like that with
a baby</B>
<BR><B>on the way. But if it wanted to stay it could on the condition of
not</B>
<BR><B>scaring my child. Things calmed down for a while little things would
happen</B>
<BR><B>and we would laugh and say the ghost did it.</B>
<BR><B>But really it wasnt until I brought my daughter home that the "ghost"
got</B>
<BR><B>excited. My daughter was two days old when I and her big brother
brought</B>
<BR><B>her home and went to bed exhausted with her in the bassinet next
to me.</B>
<BR><B>That night I was awoken by my daughter cooing and happy sounds&nbsp;
coming from</B>
<BR><B>her crib. My son was asleep in the bed next to me,, I was mistyfied
never</B>
<BR><B>had a baby woken up happy like this around our family,,especially
that</B>
<BR><B>young. I noticed a coolness around her bassinet and asked "it "&nbsp;
to please</B>
<BR><B>not frighten her.</B>
<BR><B>My daughter on more than one occasion would be heard giggling and
cooing</B>
<BR><B>when she woke up and be waving at nothing I thought. A friend of
mine</B>
<BR><B>commented on it and I jokingly said "Oh the ghost is entertaining
her" ,I</B>
<BR><B>had no idea how right I was.</B>
<BR><B>I met a girl I worked with shortly after that whose family used
to live in</B>
<BR><B>the apartment and she asked me if I noticed anything different about
it? I</B>
<BR><B>asked oh you mean the ghost ,,really its harmless. She laughed and
said you</B>
<BR><B>mean you have seen Pops? I just stood there ,and laughed ,,told
her I was</B>
<BR><B>joking. She said no your not ,Pops loved that apartment and loved
to play</B>
<BR><B>practical jokes on everyone who came in there. But his greatest
love was</B>
<BR><B>his grandbabies.</B>
<BR><B>Till the day we moved out we "chatted" with Pops,,the night before
we moved</B>
<BR><B>we had everything packed up and ready to go the next day when my
son came</B>
<BR><B>out of the kitchen and asked why the old man was crying? I went
in and saw</B>
<BR><B>"Pops" for the first and only time since we moved in. I guess it
was his</B>
<BR><B>way of letting us know he would miss us. We miss him, he kept us
on our toes.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Oh just so you know I have met the lady that moved in after
we left but</B>
<BR><B>she never said or not whether Pops has showed up. I wonder?!</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;My Time at Mexico</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Meny401@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>the thing with this story is that it was too scary the first time
it happened. Around august i was at home watching tv, chillin', when out
of nowhere my cousins daughter comes in and asks for my drink (we were
in mexico and i loved this drink called penafiel and my niece, i think
that's what you call it, knows how to get to my house.) Any way,she told
me she wanted some so i get up to the&nbsp; kitchen and there is an opening
to go to the bathroom which scares me a lot. I'm serving the drink, and
my niece looks at the opening and starts laughing like there was no tommorow,
and trust me, that opening&nbsp; is not a cool sight to look at, especially
around 9:30!! So i start to move away when this...thing comes out of the
hole and my niece starts telling me that it wants to be friends, but i
wasn't takin any chances so i grab my niece and left.</B>
<BR><B>The next day was a Sunday and me and my cousins were doing a sleepover.
My aunt fanny (little hard to say in english) was going to sleep with us
that time. At around 3 we heard a whole lot of dogs bark and then the phone
rang. Fanny picked it up, and it was her sister! We didn't go to sleep
then so we fooled around a bit and heard a loud knock by the opening (we
had a door so we couldn't see what was going on). My cousin volnteered
to go but seeing as i was in great fear they decided i should go. (that
and the reason i am a 13 year old energetic kind of guy). Any way as i
open the door we look around and my aunt was getting upand asked what that
noise was, and we all just looked at each other and went back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>I will send some stories some other time, also i like the shadowlands
a lot!</B>
<BR><B>Keep up the good work. And sorry it was so long</B>

<P><B>My Best Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BoyOsage@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i have waited a long time to talk to someone who might understand&nbsp;
what ive seen.&nbsp; its almost as if a weight is being lifted from my
chest.&nbsp; Several years ago (about eleven) i lost my best friend.&nbsp;
Richard had several best friends, a big heart, and an intelligent zest
for life.&nbsp; Shortly after he past away i was woken up early in the
morning(i've always said it was 3 a.m. but i don't know for sure).&nbsp;
The only light in the room came in through our curtains from a street light
about 20 to 30 feet away. My wife was right next to me. My daughter was
in her crib in the next room.&nbsp; Richard was her god father although
we aren't really religious.&nbsp; After i was awoken my body froze i was
scared to death.&nbsp; My eyes were fixed on something in my hallway.&nbsp;
The bedroom door was open. Something (the ghost)&nbsp; was just floating
there kind of looking, if you will, at me in my bed.&nbsp; There was no
real shape to it.&nbsp; Although there did seem to be a top, middle(fatter
there) and the bottom kind of trailing off.&nbsp; The texture to this thing
was kind of grainy or sandy,like moon dust swirling super fast like in
a circle or circles within itself.&nbsp; At this point the only two thoughts
in my mind were getting away, and my friend Richard.&nbsp; I couldn't move,
I couldn't speak, I don't know if I was breathing.&nbsp; My&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
eyes were wide as hell, I couldn't believe what was happening.&nbsp; Just
when I thought it couldn't get worse this thing like ducked under the upper
door jamb and got very close to the foot of my bed.&nbsp; I swear I tried
with all my might to push back, my eyes were popping out of my head.&nbsp;
I was starring right at the ghost scared to death.&nbsp; I was wondering
what was going to happen.&nbsp; How long was it going to be here. And just
as it came it left, dropping down and swooshing out the door down the hallway
towards the front door.&nbsp; My whole body was released and tears came
rolling down my face.&nbsp; I woke up my wife and told her what happened.&nbsp;
She wasn't interested. She was tired and upset that I woke her up.&nbsp;
I've told this story many times almost always with goosebumps appearing
on my arms and the hair on my neck raising up. That is my story I hope
you believe it.&nbsp; There is noway I was dreaming, noway.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My wife and I have experienced many strange things.&nbsp; I'll write about
those things later.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy my ghost story.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goodnight Richard, I love you and still miss you.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Mansion</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mind_tripper69@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This experience happened in Marietta, Georgia.&nbsp; It happened
today.. me and</B>
<BR><B>some friends decided to go check out this abandonded mansion that
some</B>
<BR><B>people at school knew about.&nbsp; The mansion is on White Circle
Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We</B>
<BR><B>went up this long long old driveway and got to the house, out in
front is a</B>
<BR><B>totalled MG.&nbsp; The car has been there for a long time, the tires
are all</B>
<BR><B>flat, the car is rusted, the windshield is gone.&nbsp; The skidmarks
that lead</B>
<BR><B>off the road to the tree where the car struck are quite visible.&nbsp;
We went</B>
<BR><B>inside the mansion and I had the worst feeling I've ever had in
my life.</B>
<BR><B>There was food still in the refrigirator, unwashed dishes in the
sink,</B>
<BR><B>unopened letters dated from 1991 on the counter, strange pictures
of hippies</B>
<BR><B>from the 60's, a strange picture of a blurry face of sumone screaming,
there</B>
<BR><B>are still suits and sweaters hanging in the closets.&nbsp; There
is a guest house</B>
<BR><B>below this one, that's when we had the sighting.&nbsp; We were at
the back side</B>
<BR><B>of the house, looking through the kitchen, which smelled so bad
we couldn't</B>
<BR><B>go in (the smell was coming from the open refrigirator, which was
full of</B>
<BR><B>bags and a bucket), anyway, my friend said "dude, someone just walked
by the</B>
<BR><B>front window" and my friend NEVER sounds scared, but he did when
he said</B>
<BR><B>that.&nbsp; I pointed the flashlight toward the window and just
saw our</B>
<BR><B>reflections, and I said "nah man, it's just us" not 30 seconds after
I said</B>
<BR><B>that we heard a door open, so we ran.&nbsp; We got back up to the
mansion and</B>
<BR><B>looked back down to the front of the house, but no one was there..
then we</B>
<BR><B>drove down there.. and there was no one.&nbsp; Other things we found
at the house</B>
<BR><B>were 2 nooses, several refrigirators which smelled amazingly bad
and only</B>
<BR><B>god know's what is in them, a bloody wife beater shirt, and a 20's
race car</B>
<BR><B>in the barn/shed type thing.&nbsp; This was my first time going
to a haunted</B>
<BR><B>house.. I've never been so scared... but I definetly want to see
more.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Believe it or not. My name is Jerry i live in San Antonio,Tx. Heres
my story. Last year i was working out of town had my company truck to travel
to work to Mission Texas. This day was Monday early morning about 3:30
in the morning taking off to work in the highway. Near getting to Three
Rivers Texas. It was pitch dark and light rain i remember. I would say
before getting to Three Rivers i still needed about 20 miles. I saw a person
walking along the the shoulder of the road and had a luggage with them
also strolling with them.This person was wearing a raincoat with the hood
on. This person saw my truck no cars were in front of me or in back of
me. To my surprise this person never waved for help nor did i see a car
that was stranded along the highway, that would say this person was stranded
nor did wave for help. Remember pitch dark and was walking along the shoulder
of the road. Three rivers, Tx was still 20 miles ahead no lights,no sign
of the town, pitch dark. I was scared. I pressed my gas pedal as fast as
i could. Never looked back. Was this a ghost, or a person knowing the way
to Three rivers. Pitch dark asking no help at all. Ill let yall decide.</B>

<BR><B>Knocking Doors</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pop741.1@netzero.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Heres my story. I moved into my house 3 years ago. The first year
i started to hear noises. I was at my bathroom taking a shower it happened
about 8:00 am in the morning. All i heard was a knock on the door about
2 times. After i got of the shower. I went to my sons room and my bedroom,
where my husband was there. They were asleep. I thought it was one of them
knocking on the door to use the bathroom. I told them when they woke up
if they knocked on the door and sayed no. I thought i was hearing things.
So i just let it go. My niece was staying at my house the 2nd weekend.
She was taking a shower when she told me she heard a knock on the door&nbsp;
about 3 times. When she got out she looked to see&nbsp; if anybody was
awake. We were all asleep she told me it was about 8:00 in the morning
also. When she heard that knocking sound. I never mentioned the story to
my niece cause didnt want to scare her about the knocking sound. She told
me the story what she heard and then i proceeded to tell mine also. I was
watching tv on my back den with the door open in the front and the back
door but kept it locked so my screen door was locked also. I heard somebody
knocking in the front door.It was loud. It was about 8:00 in the morning
also. I went to go and check and there was nobody. I was scared cause it
all happen</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;at 8:00 in the morning. I decided to call a lady to come bless
our house. After that i didnt hear any more knockings. This is my story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Winnipeg House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: iam_styxx@shaw.ca</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; There is a house in Winipeg.&nbsp; My mother lived there
with my brother for over 2 years..&nbsp; In the time they lived there,
they experienced many strange and frightening things..&nbsp; One involves
my daughter who was in kindergarten at the time. She was over one evening
and she started to walk around the house and place shells and rocks in
all the windows.&nbsp; My mother asked her why and she told her, "so the
mean man will leave you alone."&nbsp; My mother hadn't told her anything.&nbsp;
"who told you about the man?"&nbsp; My mother asked.&nbsp; "My daughter
looked at her and said,"The girl in the closet, the one hiding from the
man."&nbsp; My mother called me and asked me to come get my daughter. My
brother would hear people running up the stairs when he was home alone
or at night when he and my mother were sitting in the living room.&nbsp;
The running was usually accompanied by angry snarling noises.&nbsp; They
would both hear a little girl crying out in fright, usually as they passed
a crawl space door 3/4 of the way up the third floor stairs.&nbsp; He actually
heard the girl in the living room one day,"she said" Get out he's coming
back."&nbsp; He heard the running and snarling then.&nbsp; He left fast.&nbsp;
My mother would also wake up to feeling someone sitting on her bed or the
feeling of a warm hand on her hip. They also experienced cold spots and
whispering.&nbsp; I visited some times and always felt ill at ease, like
I wasn't wanted there.&nbsp; My daughter would say that she felt sad for
the girl.&nbsp; I think you would have to get Piolas permission to see
the house if there is any interest.&nbsp; She owns it. Thanks for listening.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Figure Surrounded by Light</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: midnight_sky1002@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>Hello,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My name is Aimee and I have seen a ghost before, or at least
i think it was one. This happened in my grandmother's house about 7 years
ago.I've never told anyone about this except my grandmother. I was eight
years old. Her house is square in shape and her living room is in the front
of the house,straight across from that is the den.Turn left from there
and you'll find her (and my deseased granfather's) bedroom. To the right
is the kitchen.Well, anyway one day i walked in to the kitchen through
the back door from playing in the backyard to get a drink of water when
i heard a sound in her bedroom. it sounded like something heavy falling
off the bed. Well, this scared me very badly since my father was at work
and my sister, mother and grandmother were in the backyard and noone else
was there. But being the curious child i was, i had to see what it was.
I walked in the den and took a peek in the bedroom. What i saw i'll never
forget. It was this figure, tall and kinda surrouned in this light. You
can imagine my reaction. I screamed, ran out of the house and refused to
go back in for weeks. My grandmother sat me down one day(in my house) and
asked me what it was. I told her i what i had seen, and she said that was
probaly my grandfather and not to be afraid. I went back into her hous
and was ok from there on out.I've never seen it again.</B>
<BR><B>In my house footsteps would walk up and down the hall in frount
of my room all the time, but i wasn't afraid of them because my mother
told me it was santa clause.I beleive it was the same as the something
i saw in my grandmother's house. my mother and father swear they have heard
a little rubber ball bounceing up and down the hall outside my room at
night.then we moved(not into a different house, we moved our own)and it
has been relatively quiet. Well, that's my ghost story. Thanks for your
time!</B><B></B>

<P><B>A cottage in Devon England.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: HollySycamore@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; This all began in 1994, i had recently finished my training
as a staff nurse in a large London teaching hospital.. i was 20 years old
at the time and in all honesty desperate to leave the rat-race of London,
I had always loved the south-west of England, so when 8 months into my
work as a qualified nurse I saw an advertisement for a staff nurse at a
Devon hospital i decided to go for it. I was delighted at be accepted,
and began my search for accommodation, now London is an expensive place
to live, and Devon isn't much cheaper so i was only expecting very basic
living quaters.... half expecting to end up in nurses accommodation to
tell the truth, well i couldn't believe my luck when I spotted a beautiful
old cottage up for rent and well within my budget. At the risk of sounding
cliched it was chocolate box, the type of Devon cottage people would give
a limb for but generally couldn't afford, i was so happy with the place
i didn't question the low price of the rent. So here I am in a part of
England that I had always loved, doing the job I loved, with the most wonderful
cottage.... and having more spare cash than i could ever have hoped to
have had if i had stayed in London.... in short i thought this was as good
as it got.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well my first inkling that there may be problems was
just before i actually moved in, my family had travelled to see me (i was
staying in B&amp;B accommodation while the final touches were being made
to the cottage) my mother, father younger brother and stepsister were to
join me for three days over a long weekend. My stepsister had always had
some kind of psychic ability, it was a family fact and was never questioned,
well the moment she set foot inside the place her face stiffened, I could
see this and asked her what the matter was, she managed a smile and said
she was ok, no problems etc.... whilst everyone else was totally impressed
with the place (my father asked more than a few times if i was sure the
rent i was paying was correct and there hadn't been some mistake) her demeanour
didn't change much and I knew she was worried about something ... still
I was far too pleased with things to worry much myself and as yet it hadn't
even occurred to me she was having a psychic episode, much less the problem
was anything to do with my new home. We had an enjoyable weekend, and soon
it was time to say our goodbyes. Gina's (my sister) mood hadn't changed
much, and that's when she told me what was bothering her.... " Lisa " (me)
she said grabbing my arm..... " you can't stay here... it's not right,
there is something here that will harm you ", well as uneasy as her outburst
had made me I was not about to let anything spoil my perfect little world,
and I'm ashamed to admit I told her i wasn't going to allow her jealous
pangs to ruin what I had going here. she looked sad as i said this, but
told me that if anything threatening happened not to hesitate to get out,
or at least get help.... well I made loopy gestures at her, strange as
I knew damn well she did have ability, we had seen examples of it many
times over the years, I suppose I was just too exited at everything finally
coming together for me to allow ANYTHING to put a dampner on it. Over the
next few weeks I really settled in .... my job was not due to start for
another 2 weeks, so I really enjoyed my leisure time, getting to know the
area, making the cottage my own with some of my own touches... and basically
relaxing. It was a Friday afternoon when there was a knock on the door
and an old lady who introduced herself as living close by in a cottage
a little further down the way. I was pleased to meet a new neighbour and
immediately offered her a&nbsp; cup of tea, she hesitated and said that
she was suddenly really late for something which had up until that moment
slipped her mind, but she asked " come over to me tomorrow afternoon and
we can get to know each other a little better " i agreed, pleased that
they seemed such a friendly lot around here, ignorantly not stopping to
consider the woman's behaviour as a little strange, now that I look back
it is obvious her whole demeanour changed as soon as I invited her into
my home. The next day, i made my way as promised to her home about 50 yards
along the lane, she was very welcoming and we spent an enjoyable afternoon
chatting, before I left she strangely behaved very much like my sister
had just before leaving to head back to London..... " please dear " she
said rather imploringly, " be careful in your new home " I can now see
my attitude towards people in general was changing, I rather patronisingly
said I would, and made mental notes about the poor old dear evidently suffering
some kind of dementia. Over the next few weeks the place had really begun
to feel like home, my job was going well and I had already made a lot of
new friends. This was also about the time I had noticed at times the cottage
would become freezing cold in places even though I was using the central
heating, it got so bad I had the landlord call out a plumber to ensure
there were no faults in the system (none were found) I noticed things going
missing and later reappearing in places I was sure I had not left them.
Most oddly I noticed that there was a strange symbol, etched onto a lot
of the cottage's original woodwork, which I put down to the architects
mark of work, some sort of signature. I had been there two months when
i decided it was high time for a housewarming party, it was set to be a
big event, I had invited my family, new friends from the hospital, and
all of my old friends and work colleagues. Well my sister completely refused
to come, by this time I believe she had convinced my mum that something
was amiss with the house as my mum rang incessantly to make sure I was
ok (she had never been like this before, and I had lived away from home
for almost three years by this time) the party went ahead and was a great
success, new friends getting on well with old friends, everybody having
a great time, until Jenny a girl i had been friends with since school days
and who was staying with me overnight came running downstairs babbling
incoherently about a woman on the landing...a woman who was definitely
not a party guest, I scoffed "how do you know? ... you haven't met everybody
here yet" she looked terrified as she shot straight back at me..." a woman
with red glowing eyes "a few party gores were visibly shocked at this and
some (I suspect) wondered if i had invited along a friend from the funny
farm. Jenny called a cab soon after and decided she wouldn't be staying
with me after all. As the last of my guests were either leaving or retiring
to various parts of the cottage for the night, my mum helped me clear around.
... she was not herself, "oh Lisa" she sighed," your sister has been having
nightmares about this place for some weeks now, I had tried to allay her
fears and tell her that there is nothing wrong with this place, but she
never been wrong before, and what has really brought this home to me that
Gin is right is the fact she says she saw a woman when we came to see the
house...a woman with red eyes... it was what she was trying to tell you
that day when we left to go back to London. She saw her standing outside
underneath the willow tree in the garden, she senses evil here lisa ".
For the first time doubts about the place trickled into my mind, and i
could not brush them away. I decided my best course of action from this
point was to go and see my neighbour again.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Cousins as was her name, was only too
pleased it seemed (also a little relieved) that i had come to see her regarding
this matter, what she told me shocked me to the core. It transpired that
the original owner, the man who had infact designed and built the cottage
had been heavily into black magic, his name was Matthew Martin, and had
even at one point been tried for the murder of a young teenage girl in
1883 although later acquitted.&nbsp; Then she asked me something really
odd, " Lisa dear " she began " have you ever noticed strange markings anywhere
in the house " ? I told her i had, and described them, an odd triangular
shape, with what looked like ( as i said it the realisation dawned on me
) an inverted cross underneath.....&nbsp; I began to put all of the odd
things together, bad smells, the woman two of the people closest to me
had seen, cold spots, and an odd scratching on the ceilings that I had
put down to some kind of vermin in the attic. I gave my notice on the cottage,
and collected my belongings soon after, I did as it happened end up living
in nurses accomodation, later some details emerged... nobody had ever lived
in the cottage for more than a few months at a time, which is why the rent
had been so cheap (the landlord was just desperate to have the place occupied)
there had been three suicides which by all accounts had been totally out
of character for the victim. People had found pets dead for no apparent
reason.... in the garden of the cottage... under the willow tree.... people
had seen lights in the cottage at times the was no tennant I also found
the landlord had not set foot inside the cottage for over 20 years, I now
live in London again and as far as I know, he decided to put the place
up for sale.... to this day it is still empty, falling into a state of
disrepair, in my opinion the place should just be destroyed, and the land
blessed.....</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; It was Saturday, halfway through autumn. I was sat in the
back room of my house, my father reading the paper and my mother doing
some sewing. The year was round about nineteen sixty four. I had dozed
off for a while when suddenly I awoke, my eyes ajar.&nbsp; I could see
my mother and my father but I couldn’t move .!&nbsp;&nbsp; All my limbs
were as if paralysed . The only thing that I could move were my eyes. Then
my body started to move, I came out of myself, my body was still in the
chair but I was rising up away from it.&nbsp; I reached the ceiling, turned
around and looked down on myself sitting in the chair.&nbsp; I was sat
quite normally, asleep.&nbsp; My mind was going six to the dozen, what
was this all about ? what was happening to me ?&nbsp; I just stayed where
I was, looking at myself and my parents wondering what the hell was going
on when my dog, Sally, jumped on my lap.&nbsp; I suddenly, with great speed
flew down from the ceiling and back into myself.&nbsp; Suddenly I could
move !! All my feeling had returned.&nbsp; To this day I cant explain this
event. Sadly both my parents and my dog, Sally have died so there is no-one
that can corroborate this event, but take my word for it, this is the truth
!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>RUNNING LADY</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: friggincoldnd@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My friend and I were scared silly one night.&nbsp; In Rogers, Arkansas
there is a area called Monte Ne.&nbsp; There is a abandoned hotel that
was once magnificent.&nbsp; It was a real treasure in that area.&nbsp;
Now it is mostly run down and under water from when the Army Engineer Corp
flooded the area to make Beaver Lake.&nbsp; The hotel is now a place for
teens to hang out and drink at night.&nbsp; Several of my friends and I
were walking around there late at night because we had nothing better to
do.&nbsp; We had a shortage of flashlights and being the scaredy cat that
I am I absolutly had to have my own flashlight.&nbsp; So my friend and
I jumped in the car and drove real quick back to my house.&nbsp; As we
were driving back to the hotel (we were doing about 25) my friend looked
in the rear view and seen a lady running down the road behind our car.&nbsp;
I turned around to look and we were discussing stopping in case she needed
help.&nbsp; That is when we noticed that she didn't have any feet and was
keeping up with the car very well.&nbsp; So naturally being scared out
of our minds we gased it.&nbsp; Now the road is not very long and we were
almost to the hotel so we only sped up to about 40.&nbsp; When we did that
the woman's eyes turned red and she started screaming and looked furious,
but she still managed to keep up.&nbsp; She stayed only 1 or 2 feet from
the bumper.&nbsp; As we came in view of the hotel we turned around to look
at her but she was gone.&nbsp; The image is still so very clear in my head
t t I could draw every facial feature.&nbsp; The clothes she wore looked
around the 60-70's area.&nbsp; It was a white dress with a really low V
neck and semi long sleeves.&nbsp; It was a calf length.&nbsp; She had dark
brown hair that blew back as she was moving.&nbsp; To this day I won't
drive through Monte Ne valley with my windows down.</B>

<BR><B>House of Many Spirits</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: neko93@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>For some reason my grandparent’s house always frightened me. When
I was a little girl I would spend the night at their house and dread going
to bed in the guest room. Later when my grandfather had emphysema and was
hooked up to oxygen and the oxygen tank was in this room. The low hum of
the oxygen machine did little to settle my nerves as I tried to sleep in
this room. One day when I was about sixteen I was visiting my grandparents
my grandfather told me that there had been some strange occurrences in
the house. He told me that sometimes the doorbell would ring and when he
would open the door no one was there. He also told me that he would see
things that weren’t really there. I thought my grandfather was probably
joking because he was always pulling my leg and telling me funny stories.
A few years later, my grandfather had become very sick. At this time he
was in the hospital more than he was at home. The night before he went
to the hospital for the last time, he had some visitors. My grandmother
told me this story. She said he woke her up around 3 A.M. and he was crying
and looked like he had been scared to death. He told her that there were
three men standing in the doorway of their bathroom and he thought they
were there to take him away from her. Their master bathroom doorway is
right in front of my grandmother’s side of the bed. He described the men
as dark and wearing cowboy hats. The next day my grandfather went into
the hospital for the last time and never returned to the house.</B>
<BR><B>A few years after my grandfather died, my grandmother began to tell
me of the strange occurrences that she had witnessed in her house. She
has received visits from my grandfather. His breathing has woken her up
a couple of times and she sees him standing by the foot of her bed. The
last time he came to see her, she didn’t open her eyes. She said he was
talking to someone else who he had brought with him to meet her and she
did not want any part of it. As soon as she screams or tells him to go
away he quickly vanishes. She has also seen another spirit in her house
that stands in her the doorway of her bedroom, which is at the foot of
the bed. When she sees this she closes her eyes and prays for it to go
away and it does.</B>
<BR><B>At first, I did not know how to take what my grandmother was saying.
I had always felt uneasy in that house, but I couldn’t understand why she
was finally seeing things only after my grandfather died. One day I was
a witness to a strange event myself. I had gone over to visit my grandmother
and we were talking in the kitchen. The kitchen faces the living room and
in the living room there is a large window by the side entrance into the
house. You can easily see people walk up to the doorway through this window.
While we were talking I noticed that an elderly woman with a black dress
and shawl was walking up the doorway. Actually, the way this woman was
walking was almost like she was floating up the steps to my grandmother’s
doorway. It’s hard to describe. I immediately told my grandmother that
one of her friends was paying her a visit. When no one knocked on the door
I became suspicious. I looked out the window, but nothing was there. Through
another window in the living room I looked down the street and no one was
there. For some reason, I had a strong feeling that I shouldn’t open up
the door to see if anyone was there. I think my grandmother had seen this
woman too because she immediately started to pray. I tried to talk to her
about it but she changed the subject so I took her queue and dropped it.
After this experience, when I would go visit my grandmother I could not
stay after dark. I had a strange feeling that I was being pushed out of
the house after it got dark.</B>
<BR><B>When I was 25 I moved to Washington and left my grandmother behind
in her scary house in California. The first time I came back home to visit
her I was uneasy about staying the night in her house. I decided that whatever
it was was not going to push me around. That night around 10p.m my grandmother
and I were talking and out of the corner of my eye I say a small figure
do what seem to be a summersault all the way down my grandmother hall.
I did not let my grandmother know about this because all of this scared
her and I did not want to upset her.</B>
<BR><B>The rest of my story will sound fishy and I don’t even know if I
believe it myself but here goes. This night I was seeing things and they
were talking to me except it was in my head. I was actually seeing these
things with my eyes. I saw a tall man in a cowboy hat with a beard sitting
with his leg over his knee on my grandmother’s couch. I saw a little boy
doing acrobatic trick from one end of the hall to another. I saw many but
those were the one’s I remember. It felt as though so much information
was coming to me at once that I couldn’t handle it all. I also heard voices,
many voices. One voice did stand out from the rest. I started to ask them
questions. I asked why they were there. I believe the voice that stood
out was a woman’s and she told me that it was because my grandfather forgot
to close the door when he left. I didn’t completely understand this. I
asked them if her if they could leave and they told me that my grandfather
had to come back and close the door.</B>
<BR><B>I don’t know what to think. I am not sure if what I thought I was
experiencing was real or not. I do know that on my next visit my grandmother
had previously had the house blessed. I also took the added precaution
of telling whoever was there that I didn’t want to see or hear anything
from them and that they needed to leave my grandmother’s house because
they were not going to ruin anymore of my visits with her and make her
afraid of her own house.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Paranormal</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SkullMugz@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>This is my experience with the paranormal. A few years ago my uncle
died. He was a homeowner and, since I was the last living relative, I had
to go through his house. Taking what would be needed and what would not
be needed. On the third day of going through the house I went to the attic.The
first thing I noticed was the coldness of the attic even in the summer.
I rummaged through very old things. Soon, to my surprise, I found an old
chess set. They were rather old from the age that they looked at the way
the pieces were designed. I decided to keep the chess set. It was late
and I lived about two hours away so I decided to stay in the house. I fell
asleep in a disturbed night. The next morning I was up. I went through
my daily morning rituals. When I went up to the attic I found that the
chess set I had set down with the pieces arranged, a game had been played.
The funny thing is the white king was turned over in the show of the defeat
to the black pieces. The white king was still rolling from being turned
over.</B>

<BR><B>Olde Mill Steakhouse, GA</B>

<P><B>By: PrincessE369@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I would have put this under the other link but it would not work,
so I am doing this another way. I am a waitress at Olde Mill Steakhouse
in Fayetteville, GA, on Hwy. 54, and it is the most haunted place I have
ever been in. As the history explains, the mill has not always been just
a mill, but was once a Civil War hospital and later a whorehouse. Rumor
has it that two people also committed suicide together in the attic. Strange
apparitions, lights going on and off, flying objects, etc., are all very
common at the Olde Mill. I have always been very skeptical about such things
until I witnessed such activities myself. Every person who works at Olde
Mill has SOME kind of story to tell about the (probably numerous) ghosts.
One particularly creepy one happened to my friends who were still at work
late one night when they heard waltz music from upstairs and what seemed
to be dancing. When they investigated it, no one could be found, but all
the lights in the attic had been turn on, although no one had been upstairs.
Another common story is that lights can be seen floating on the lake late
at night and many times people have drove away from the mill, looked back
and saw glowing figures in the doorway. I think this is one place that
you might want to check into. It's definitely interesting! Thanks for your
time!</B>

<P><B>Not Creepy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:abandon_thoughts@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've had this fondness for ghosts ever since I was a little kid and
there's a reason for that. I've never told anyone my story except my grandmother.
When I was about two years old, my grandfather passed-away in his bedroom
for unknown reasons and my grandmother would always tell us that she would
frequently see him. My father told me it was a lie because she missed him
and cuz that's where she kept her money. I believed my father for the most
part until I was about 12-years old. I remember spending the night in her
house (I lived right across the road) and that I was playing with her record
player. My grandmother was asleep and so I decided I'd sneek into my grandfather's
room to find more records. The hallways would often grow chilly almost
every night though she had no air-conditioner (We were poor back then.
Heh.) and that the windows would always shut even though the last task
that my grandmother would do is to close the windows before she went to
bed. Now, I opened the door slowly as to not wake my grandmother who was
across the hallway in her small bed. Let me remind you that I had only
seen this room one other time and I had never been inside so I was quite
scared as I stepped a foot in. The bed and the dressers were painted over
with dust and spider webs. I slowly opened the closet, and I wasn't too
paranoid at the time and nor did I think that I'd see or hear what I saw.
I was more afraid of my grandmother catching me until I started digging
around in the closet and I heard a muffled voice say something. I don't
know what it said, but I knew it was behind me. I slowly turned around
and saw a ghostly like figure standing at the edge of the bed. It wasn't
a full person detail, but I noticed that it was as tall as my grandfather
(He was a big man. Stood a good 6'5''). I ran out crying and my grandmother
woke up and asked me what was wrong until she saw that the door was open.
She looked to me and gently said, "You saw him too?". I couldn't believe
that my own grandmother's house was haunted. Ever since, I've never gone
into the house or room. I'm 16 now (not too much older), and the house
was recently reconstructed by one of my uncles, but something that's very
creepy. My old house was given to my grandmother when we moved away and
she recently passed-away in that house. Not the same house my grandfather
died in, but there has been several owners in this house and all of them
move out because of noises. To this day, there's still voices and shadows,
but it's hard for me to comprehend since they were both very elderly and
very sick at the time of their deaths. It's my little ghost experience.
It isn't creepy or scary, and I'd rather keep it this way.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Parent's House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lawhorn@peoplepc.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>We moved into my parent's house when I was 13. I was happy to be
moving in there because for 13 years I had to share a room with my brother.
My room was in the upper part of the house and right across from my parent's
room. The first night that we stayed in the new house I was awakened by
something tapping on the wall above my head. So I sat up in the bed and
cut my lamp on and it stopped it went on for about 2 weeks. So it scared
me enough that I went and slept in my parents room on the floor. When I
returned back to my room a few days later nothing happened. I had asked
a friend of mine to come over and stay the night and us get up and go to
school the next morning. I had gotten up and went to the kitchen to get
some juice and I almost screamed I seen this girl setting in the livingroom
with long dark hair and a white gown on I had stopped what I was doing
and said to my self that it was my friend that was over the house she had
slept in a white gown and has dark hair but when I looked back she was
gone. So I went to my room and she was still asleep. I kicked her and asked
her how she could scare me like that she replied that she did not know
what I was talking about. So when I got home from school that day I told
my mother what had happened. She told me that I was just very sleepy and
that I had just imagined what I had seen. So a few weeks later my mother
was in the livingroom and said that she felt someone walk into the livingroom
and she looked up and seen this girl and thought that I was just home from
school already and then realized that it was to early for me to be home.
And looked back and the little girl was gone. She told me about it later
and asked me what she looked like I told her that she had on a white dress
or gown and had long dark hair. She said that was the same person that
she had seen as well. About a month later my father was awakened by someone
laughing so loud that he got up out of bed and went to the front door he
thought that it was my brothers and their friends but when he cut on the
front porch light they stopped laughing. My mom's friend was having a hard
time so my parents took care of her daughter and at time she was about
2 she stayed with us until she was 6 and the last time that she stayed
there she had woke me in the night to tell me to look I never looked I
just told her that she had a bad dream to go back to bed. The next day
she asked if she could go and leave with her mom that she did not want
to stay there anymore. It took her about a year to tell us why she wanted
to go and why she would not come and stay the night anymore. The night
that she woke me she said that she woke up because she could hear someone
singing so she sat up in the bed and said that she seen this little girl
sitting in my bedroom floor and that she had all of my glass dolls in the
floor and was playing with them. She said that is when she tried to wake
me up and tell me that someone was playing with my dolls that she knew
that no one was allowed to play with. She said that the little girl got
mad at her and that the dolls started to fly over the bed at her. So after
that she did not come over or even stay there for over a year. The night
that I got her to tell me the story of why she wanted to stay that night
as soon as her mother left the croutons in the den came flying off the
wall and fell in the floor it looked like there was wind up under them
and they just fell off. Then my father started adding to the house and
built an upstairs' to the house for another room. When he started that
he had to go somewhat into the attic and that is when he found a box that
had things in there for a babyshower for a girl that was never used. About
4 years after that my two brothers where in the upstairs that my father
built and was laying in there beds asleep when they both were awakened
by this woman screaming and then the scream went into a growl. They said
that the both asked each other if they heard that and they both said yes
and just pulled the blankets over their heads and went back to bed. My
parents still live there and still see the little girl once in awhile and
sometimes she has on this old Southern Bell dress. My mother recently was
waling to the bathroom and thought that it was smoke from where everyone
was smoking in the house that was in the diningroom and she came downstairs
and said that she had to leave right then and there that it was not smoke
that she had walked through that it must have been a spirit. She said that
when she walked through it she felt like she was as light as a feather.&nbsp;
Since then I have married and moved out and bought a house of my own and
I have seen this old man in my house. I don't see him all of the time but
I know when he is there I smell maple syrup and it is very strong smelling.
I grew up with ghost always in my life for as long as I can remember.</B><B></B>

Norfolk, Virginia. My cousins came into town that day to mourn, when we
were driving away from his house,&nbsp; we looked at the front porch for&nbsp;
a last look at where he used to wave to us goodbye from across the street.
He was standing at there, waving back at me totally smiling. i asked my
cousin if she saw him and she said i was seeing things, i looked back and
he was still there, then he vanished in a white haze. sometimes i would
go back into his office, where he used to keep everything special. it would
get cold all of a sudden, and then warm again,&nbsp; things would move
from their shelf. eventuallly the room was taken down for remoddeling,
the wall was was removed and his things were put in storage i think. i
havent felt anything since. the last thing i remeber is that i heard from
my dad that he had said he wouldent get to see me before he died,&nbsp;
mabey thats why he showed himself to me, i dont know, thank you.</B>

<BR><B>Late Night Drive</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ITAARPER@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Maybe this is a ghost story, maybe it's not.. You be the judge..
I know it sure freaked me out.. I was driving to town late one night taking
my usual backroad to avoid all the traffic.. I have been on this road many
times before, nothing strange had ever happened to me before.&nbsp; I was
driving along and all of the sudden i saw a bright light in the middle
of the road, I slowed down thinking it was a flashlight, maybe someone
was walking or something.&nbsp; As I got close I saw there was nothing
there, my car drove through the light, as it did I felt chills go through
my body, all the way to town, I felt so strange, so uneasy,&nbsp; I even
speeded up so I could hurry and make it to town.&nbsp; So I could get out
of my car.&nbsp; I made it to the store, the minute I got out of my car
I felt normal.&nbsp; I did my shopping, got back in my car, never thinking
about what had happened before, everything was fine, I felt normal,&nbsp;
that is , until I made it back to turn off on my usual country road.&nbsp;
As I turned onto the country road , I felt the same chilly feeling again,
I looked in my rearview mirror and I swear I saw a mans figure looking
back at me, I slammed on breaks, turned around and nothing was there. I
even cut on the inside car light, but still nothing.&nbsp; I was feeling
so freaky, I can't explain it.&nbsp; I continued to drive home, I made
it back to the same spot where I had first seen the light in the road.&nbsp;
As I approached the place I slowed down to look, I saw nothing, but I started
to feel "not" so uneasy.&nbsp; It was kinda like something, had just took
a ride with me for awhile..&nbsp; I don't know, but I will tell you this,
I sure haven't been on that road again for a late night drive to town.</B>

<BR><B>so beautiful. then he said" Oh yes now I remember I seen u on the
highway to</B>
<BR><B>Las Vegas" after that some other person came it was a young man
by the name</B>
<BR><B>of johnathan he came to call the other one because he was needed.
Then my</B>
<BR><B>husband went to the room and went into bed, so I followed him and
woke him</B>
<BR><B>up and asked who was he talking to and he said noone why, I said
u were so</B>
<BR><B>he remembered&nbsp; and told me. I told him to describe the person
he was talking</B>
<BR><B>to he discribed my dad from head to toe, keep in mind my husband
had never</B>
<BR><B>met my dad, he died about 6 years ago. Then I asked him who nancy
was and he</B>
<BR><B>yelled at me " how do u know about her" I said u were talking to
her, and</B>
<BR><B>thats when he said on the las vegas highway he and some friends
were driving</B>
<BR><B>when they see this pretty young women walking along the highway
so they</B>
<BR><B>pulled over to ask her if she wanted a ride she turned around to
them and</B>
<BR><B>said no thank you turned and vanished.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time was about a few months ago when
ca nights were still cold</B>
<BR><B>to where you need to sleep with a heater on, well me my husband
and baby</B>
<BR><B>were sound asleep when we hear his closed door open little by little
sort of</B>
<BR><B>like creaking then all of a sudden his duffle bag was thrown out
onto the</B>
<BR><B>floor it made a BIG BOOM SOUND, we both jumped up so high, the next
morning</B>
<BR><B>I asked him where was the bag and he said it was on the bottom where
his</B>
<BR><B>shoes are, now I thought it was on the top shelve cause thats how
it sort of</B>
<BR><B>sounded but it was not and one more thing it flew by the crib which
was 10</B>
<BR><B>ft way from the closet.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband kept having restless nights
because they would bother him at</B>
<BR><B>night, then it started through out the day. Diffrent ones each night
was bug</B>
<BR><B>him.&nbsp; In may and in june 03, I would be alone in the house
and as soon as I</B>
<BR><B>enter my husbands office his floor lamp would turn on by itself.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we both were affected by all of this
so thats when I decided to call</B>
<BR><B>the paranoral people and explaim whats going on in my house so they
made an</B>
<BR><B>appt and came over in june, and when they came with there equipment
they</B>
<BR><B>started getting readings and one other lady was taking picture with
a</B>
<BR><B>digital camera and orbs would show up, about 7 pm my husband gets
this bad</B>
<BR><B>headache and starts holding his head and says stop im tired of this
then he</B>
<BR><B>sits on my rocking chair and all of a sudden he is stiff with his
eyes huge</B>
<BR><B>with no expression on his face, well he was channeling the spirits,
they</B>
<BR><B>were going into his body and speaking through him.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The following sat after that they came back but this
time with a pshyic,</B>
<BR><B>and thats how we found out about the vortex in our bedroom and about
the</B>
<BR><B>little girl in our bedroom she said the girl looked between 7 and
8 by the</B>
<BR><B>looks of her dress it was about the 60-70's she has pony tails and
that she</B>
<BR><B>is attracted to my middle child who is a girl and about 7 she wants
to play</B>
<BR><B>with her because she is lonely.</B>
<BR><B>And the pshyic did say that the girl never lived here or even died
here she</B>
<BR><B>is just attached to this room and my husband,&nbsp; its not a puppy
love but a</B>
<BR><B>father type. My husband says she wakes him up when noises are heard
outside</B>
<BR><B>he warns him and even saved his life. The little girl wanted my
husband to</B>
<BR><B>adopt her and he said he cant do that she even asked if our baby
was her</B>
<BR><B>little sister.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pshyic had a talk with the little
girl and told her she</B>
<BR><B>can send her to the light if she wanted to.&nbsp; she also had a
talk with the</B>
<BR><B>guy dave who loved to bug us.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hallway Apparition</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shanebungay@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Grandparents dont believe this story but they werent home.....</B>
<BR><B>I was home alone one night about 2 years ago,watching Tv in my room
when I heard sounds like walking in the attic. Curious, I stepped out into
the hallway. The light was on in the kitchen but the hallway was dark.
I looked out into the hall and was scared out of my wits at what I saw.
Halfway down the hall I saw the spirit of an older man with a suit and
hat. All I saw was the back of him as he walked down the hallway and disappeared.
I told this to my grandparents. They told me they used to look after an
old man who liked to tease and carry on. The next night I was alone I heard
more footsteps and what sounded like laughing. My grandparents insist im
just hearing things But I know what I heard. I havent seen the hallway
apparition since but I do sometimes still hear noises in the attic and
basement.</B>

<P><B>I had just woken up one night, and it must have been about 2 in the
morning. I was still really drowsy so I'm not sure if I imagined it, but
when I turned over and looked towards my door I saw a dark figure standing
there. Because it was right next to my door it was like it was guarding
it so I couldn't get out. I've never been so scared in my life. I kept
blinking hoping it would go away, but it didn't, so I pulled the bed covers
over my head and screamed as loud as I could! lol, I bet I woke the whole
of my street up. Then my parents came running in, and it had vanished.
Whether it was a ghost or not I don't know, but I do know that it was terrifying!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dealings with Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: secndtwilight20@optonline.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello! My name is Maryalice, and I'd just like to share my ghost</B>
<BR><B>experiences with you.</B>
<BR><B>Over the summer, I enjoy staying up until all hours of the night
just</B>
<BR><B>occupying myself with various things, such as painting, writing,
and</B>
<BR><B>reading. About two summers ago, I was sitting in what we call the
Den. If</B>
<BR><B>you sit on the far right end of the large couch, you can see straight
down</B>
<BR><B>the hallway and into one of the bedrooms. I was sitting there when
I looked</B>
<BR><B>up to see a figure dash from the front door into the kitchen. It
was a</B>
<BR><B>girl, probably about eighteen or nineteen who was dressed in this
navy blue</B>
<BR><B>gown. The style reminded me of the Titanic, so I figure from about
the</B>
<BR><B>1920's or so. She had dirty blonde/light brown hair that was pulled
up on</B>
<BR><B>top of her head. I went into the kitchen but nothing was there.</B>
<BR><B>On a separate night in the same summer, I was going to bed and walking
down</B>
<BR><B>the hallway when I saw this extremely bright blue light glowing
outside of</B>
<BR><B>the main bedroom at the end of the hallway (the one that is visible
from</B>
<BR><B>the Den). I stood motionless for a minute and then finally turned
on the</B>
<BR><B>hallway light to see what it was. It disappeared and didn't return
even</B>
<BR><B>after I turned off the light again.</B>
<BR><B>My Aunt has just recently gone into the hospital. She had been sick
for a</B>
<BR><B>little over a year, and had recovered from cancer through it all.
On late</B>
<BR><B>nights when I would be downstairs on the computer and she'd be in
the Den,</B>
<BR><B>she would have this hand-rung bell that she would ring if she needed
my</B>
<BR><B>help. A few days after she was taken into the hospital, I was sitting
in</B>
<BR><B>the Den and watching the TV when I heard her bell ringing distinctly
from</B>
<BR><B>her room. I got nervous, thinking perhaps my grandmother, her sister,
was</B>
<BR><B>ringing it because something was wrong. I ran down the hall to find
my</B>
<BR><B>grandmother sleeping and the ringing subsided. Then, a few nights
after</B>
<BR><B>that, I was sitting in my basement on the computer. At about 1:00
AM I</B>
<BR><B>heard the ringing again, but this time it was far away. So, once
again, I</B>
<BR><B>made a dash up the stairs and to where my grandmother was but the
ringing</B>
<BR><B>stopped. When I told my sister, she believed that my aunt was dreaming
of</B>
<BR><B>being home and ringing the bell, which is why I heard it.</B>
<BR><B>When it is extremely quiet I can hear the distant voices of children
and a</B>
<BR><B>man. The children are often on either side of me, whispering and
laughing.</B>
<BR><B>The man is harder to understand. It always sounds like he's telling
the</B>
<BR><B>children to do something, but I can never understand what he's saying.
The</B>
<BR><B>children also talk, but I can never understand what they're saying
either.</B>
<BR><B>I just hear their laughter and muffled whispers. My sister also
hears</B>
<BR><B>voices such as these, but she can actually understand what they're
saying.</B>
<BR><B>I just thought I would give my input and my dealings with ghosts.
Most of</B>
<BR><B>my family, almost all, don't believe in a word I say and tell me
it's my</B>
<BR><B>imagination. My sister believes me, though, and she's the one who
sent me</B>
<BR><B>your site. I'm just glad I'm not the only one who has dealings with
ghosts!</B>

<P><B>An Unseen Presence</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: plturner2@insightbb.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is perhaps an unremarkable ghost story and
I'm still not sure</B>
<BR><B>exactly who or what it was.&nbsp; But it did happen to me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband's first wife passed away June 2003.&nbsp;
She had lived in</B>
<BR><B>Louisville's West End, while my husband and I lived in the South
End.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Their son was staying at the house to watch over it until
the estate</B>
<BR><B>could be settled.&nbsp; After her death, he mentioned that at night
he would</B>
<BR><B>often hear the television, even though he hadn't turned it on.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One evening we took S. home after an afternoon
visit.&nbsp; It was dark</B>
<BR><B>and the street was quiet.&nbsp; Across the street from the house
was an</B>
<BR><B>abandoned cemetery, now overgrown with man-high grass and weeds.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was standing by the side of the car, watching
S. go to the back</B>
<BR><B>gate.&nbsp; Suddenly, I felt something push against my side.&nbsp;
It wasn't a</B>
<BR><B>shove nor was it a mere brush.&nbsp; Whoever or whatever touched
me wanted to</B>
<BR><B>make its presence known.&nbsp; At first I thought it was S. but
he had</B>
<BR><B>already gone into the back yard.&nbsp; Then I thought it might be
one of his</B>
<BR><B>dogs, but none had come outside.&nbsp; Could it be my husband or
daughter?</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;No.&nbsp; They had been on the other side of the car all that
time.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't feel the presence again, but I won't
forget it either.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>husband thinks it was the ghost of his ex-wife.&nbsp; I wonder if
it wasn't a</B>
<BR><B>spirit from across the street -- unhappy with the conditions of
that</B>
<BR><B>ancient,&nbsp; abandoned cemetery.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Boyd House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:angel42773@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I saw this site and could not resist sharing some of the paranormal
experiences that I had growing up in the 250 year old Boyd House. As if
being 250 years old isn't enough to provide plenty of ghost stories, there
was also a cemetary about 500 feet from the house.</B>
<BR><B>My whole family has had experiences in this house and I would like
to relate a few of them. The first happened to my step-father while the
rest of the family wasn't home. He was down in the basement working on
the furnace and heard someone walking around upstairs. Thinking that we
had come home, he came upstairs to talk to my mother only to find that
nobody was there. He no sooner got back to the basement and the footsteps
started again.</B>
<BR><B>The next event happened to my little sister. My parents had gone
out one night and my other sister and I were at my father's house leaving
my youngest sister at the house by herself. She was taking a bath and thought
that she heard footsteps in the kitchen. She got out of the bathtub and
walked into the kitchen to see who was there and all she found was our
cat staring at an empty space in front of the cupboard with her back all
raised up. My sister got scared and called me at my father's. While we
were on the phone she thought she saw a car pull up and a couple seconds
later, I heard someone knock on the door over the phone. She looked out
the window and said she had to go because our grandmother was there. We
hung up, but she called right back to tell me that when she opened the
door, nobody was there. I called my grandmother and she had never left
home. Not to mention that it took a good 15 minutes to get from our house
to her's and this all took place in about 3 minutes time.</B>
<BR><B>The next event took place while we were off school one day because
of the snow. Our parent's were at work and we were in the living room watching
TV when I saw someone walk past the window on the side of the house. I
could see him clearly. He was a man of about 35 years of age. He had a
full beard and moustache and was wearing a black/red flannel jacket with
jeans and heavy work boots. I walked outside to ask him what he was doing
there and saw him going into the woods behind our house. I thought maybe
he was a hunter so I went after him to tell him that we didn't allow hunting
on our property and he disappeared at the edge of the woods. I should tell
you now that the cemetary is about 20 feet from where he disappeared. There
were no footprints in the snow beyond where I saw him either.</B>
<BR><B>Over the next several years, I moved away, got married and started
having my children. During this time, things continued to happen to my
mother and sisters. One thing in particular was the voice that they would
hear outside. Always after dark and always when they were alone. Just all
of a sudden they would hear a voice clearly telling them to "hurry, get
back in the house!" and it was coming from right beside them, with no presence
to go along with the voice.</B>
<BR><B>The last two events that took place in the house that I know of
involved me. My husband was in the Navy and had been stationed on a ship
that was going overseas for 6 months. Not wanting me alone with a new baby,
he sent me home to stay with my mother while he was gone.&nbsp; While there,
my 2 year old daughter and I slept on the pull-out bed on the couch. It
was around 2 am and I was watching a movie when my youngest sister's boyfriend
came downstairs to leave and said he was glad to see that my daughter had
made it back to bed. I asked him what he was talking about and he said
that he had heard someone coming up the stairs a while before that. My
sister's full length mirror was positioned so that you could see the stairs
from her bed and when he looked in the mirror to see who it was, he said
it was my daughter and he told her to go back downstairs with me. The thing
is, I was laying right beside my daughter the whole time and she never
moved. Also, the stairs are in the living room and I never heard any footsteps
on the stairs and nobody else went up or down the steps.</B>
<BR><B>The last thing that happened to me was while I was visiting my mother
at the end of summer. At the time, we lived in Indiana and we had come
to visit for the weekend. I was 8 months pregnant with my fourth child
and on the day that we were scheduled to leave I got up early to pack our
stuff for the drive home. I stepped down onto the first step to go downstairs
and felt hands on the back of my ankles. Before I could grab the bannister,
the hands pushed forward and down I went. I fell the whole way to the bottom.
I broke three bones and was quite sore for awhile, but remarkably, the
baby was uninjured.</B>
<BR><B>Since then, my sister's have both moved out and started their own
lives and my mother and step-father are divorced now. My step-father still
lives in the house, but hasn't had any other experiences. I think maybe
it was just us girls. My husband always said that my family was weird anyhow
because we only have female children and the women in my family are very
domineering over men. Maybe the ghost is a man and decided to teach us
a lesson.By the way, the uninjured child that I was carrying was a boy.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Our haunted house in New Zealand</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ytwich@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I lived in a haunted house for 13 years and to be honest I was so
young when we moved in I had no idea anything abnormal was happening.</B>
<BR><B>Every night when I would go to bed as soon as the lights would go
out I would wait for this strange light which used to hover in the corner
of my room just below the ceiling it was about a foot in wide and could
have not been coming from anywhere.</B>
<BR><B>One morning when I was about 7 I woke up and looked straight at
my wardrobe doors as I did this they slammed shut with such force that
I just about stopped breathing , then about 3 seconds (which felt more
like 3 hours) they clicked as they locked themselves.</B>
<BR><B>From that day on strange bad smells would appear and disappear,
lights would go on and off and doors would casually open then shut as something
would enter the room.</B>
<BR><B>These are just a few of the things we experienced in that house.-</B>

<P><B>My Uncle's Ghostly Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: AlabamaPeg@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Acutally, my Uncle Buddy had two seperate and different experieces.&nbsp;
These stories have been told to me by my uncle.&nbsp; Both happened to
him when he was a young boy.&nbsp; So, without further delay I will proceed
with the first as follows:</B>
<BR><B>1.&nbsp; When Uncle Buddy walked to school he had to walk down railroad
tracks&nbsp; This was the shortest way back and forth.&nbsp; One afternoon
as he was walking home he noticed a little girl walking behind him.&nbsp;
He was aggravated with her following him so he sped up his pace and so
did she.&nbsp; He began to run and so did she.&nbsp; He finally got home.
Later on to find out that this little girl had been killed on the railroad
track some months before.</B>
<BR><B>2.&nbsp; Uncle Buddy had went to visit an aunt and uncle of his
and my father's.&nbsp; He was spending the night.&nbsp; He had been told
about the house being haunted but had never saw a ghost before this night.&nbsp;
Now, this was a long time ago when people sat by fireplaces and talked.&nbsp;
There was no television.&nbsp; Something knocked on the front door.&nbsp;
Uncle Buddy told them he would answer the door.&nbsp; It was almost time
to go to bed ( night).&nbsp; He answered to find nothing there.&nbsp; He
shut the door and sat back downs.&nbsp; Something knocked on the back door.&nbsp;
He thought someone was playing tricks on them.&nbsp; He answered it to
find also nothing was there.&nbsp; This time he thought he would be cunning
and wait behind the door the next time.&nbsp; So, he waited by the front
door and sure enough something knocked he swung the door open quickly and
a black casket floated through him and through the room and out the back
door.&nbsp; He never forgot that night ever.&nbsp; He said he thought it
was some kind of a warning that someone in the family was going to die.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>My cousins told me about a house they lived in located in Empire,
Alabama.&nbsp; I spent the night there with them, but I kept my head under
the covers all night long.&nbsp; They had been told the house was haunted
before they moved in, but poor people sometimes do not have a choice.&nbsp;
After they had moved all their belongings in they proceeded to unnail the
kitchen door leading into the living room.&nbsp; On the wall behind the
door was written "She shot him in the back".&nbsp; Sometimes at night they
said they could hear shooting across the bedroom.</B>

<BR><B>Maggie</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cmeltr@sbcglobal.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I love ghost stories, being from New England, I think everyone
I know has seen a ghost, or some sort of unexplained phenomenon.&nbsp;
Some of my experiences freaked me out but this one I have always found
humorous.&nbsp; When I was 15 I went to live in a group home in Portland
Maine.&nbsp; When I went to the interview... and to spend a trial weekend
there, everyone started telling me about Maggie.&nbsp; From what I remember
them telling me, is that Maggie was an older woman who owned the house...
at one point it was a funeral home( I am not sure if that was before or
after maggie, but there were some artifacts left in the house that led
me to believe that the funeral home part was true)&nbsp; Anyways, the girls
there, and the staff as well told me about employees who had quit because
of Maggie.&nbsp; They told me about the pantry light that comes on by itself,
(it came on while we were chatting about Maggie) they told me also how
Maggie hated locks... and she would set off the alarm at night.&nbsp; Some
of the things they told me I thought was a little far fetched, but the
stories were amusing.&nbsp; I moved in a few weeks later, and aside from
the pantry light I didn't see any other evidence of her for some time.&nbsp;
I started to think the light was just a symptom of living in an old victorian
house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months after
I got there a new woman started working at the home, she was the first
person to opt to sleep in the third floor apartment that the group home
had... I didn't even know there was an apartment up there since everyone
else slept downstairs on the couch...&nbsp; Her first night there after
we had all went to bed, she opened the door to tell us to quiet down..
we thought she was a quack because we were all in bed.&nbsp; She did the
same thing the rest of the weekend... we hadn't said anything to her about
it until the next time she was on.&nbsp; She was telling us how she didn't
mind us talking but we needed to stay quiet at night, we finally told her
we weren't talking at night.&nbsp; She stayed up there a few more times,
and soon she moved to the couch like the others, and eventually quit...
someone said she quit because Maggie had freaked her out in the bathroom
one night.&nbsp; She was going to the bathroom and the window started opening
and shutting by itself, the water in the sink and shower came on and the
lights were flickering.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was about a month later that I had my
first 'unusual' experience.&nbsp; All of us girls were rushing through
our chores so we could go out.&nbsp; I had walked through a hallway where
we kept speakers to the stereo, it was quite common for one of us to turn
it on during chores.&nbsp; I was a little irritated with it this time,
because I thought someone had turned it on and not put it on a channel...
it was making that am radio dead air buzzing sound.&nbsp; It was driving
me mad... I stomped into the parlor yelling at whoever might have done
it and I saw that the power button wasn't lit.&nbsp; I hit it anyway and
went back out to the hall, the sound was still there, I hit it again and
no light.&nbsp; I was a little spooked and decided to unplug the stereo,
only when I kneeled down to unplug it, it was already unplugged.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everyone in the house laughed it up for a while since I had yelled at the
other girls for it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best one happened at about 10 or 11
o'clock one night.&nbsp; All of us girls were hanging out in one of the
bedrooms talking.&nbsp; The staff had let us know it was 5 minutes until
bedtime.&nbsp; We all knew that it was our last chance to smoke that night.&nbsp;
We all bolted out the bedroom door, and the R.A. was at the bottom of the
stairs, we got to the banister and the girl at the front stopped dead in
her tracks, when we looked at the stairs we all saw her.&nbsp; An old woman
walking up the stairs, she was almost clear, she looked distorted like
if you were trying to watch her through the steam from a boiling pot.&nbsp;
I thought I was hallucinating, until I looked away from her and realized
everyone saw her, seven girls and the RA. We of course screamed and ran
down the back steps.&nbsp; but there was Maggie after that we all knew
Maggie was real...Thanks Maggie for launching my interest in ghost investigation</B>

<P><B>Ghost in driveway</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DerangedState@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I live in the bronx and I'm not sure how many places would be haunted,
but here is my story anyway. I very recently went out to ride my bike around
my neighborhood. I ended up meeting some friends and we went on a bike
ride. My friend informed us of a empty house that was surrounded by a large
track. We went to the track and rode our bikes all day exchanging different
stories until about Twilight. Around this time we noticed alot of different
things in the house going on and off behind the boarded off doors and windows.
I'm a teenager and as all teenagers we're stupid among ourselves. We soon
all decided to investigate this house. When we did we hadn't gotten close
to the house when in the driveway I saw a boy. He was dressed in old fashioned
clothing and staring at me. I thought it was another person when he went
around a corner. When I went to investigate he was gone. I asked my friends
if they had seen him and they thought I was trying to scare them. We left
after that and I spoke to a man who had a similar experience with such
things and I wanted to find out more so he guided me to this site.</B>

<BR><B>Florida Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mhouse4@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here is a story a co-worker told me about her experience.&nbsp; A
few years ago her family moved into an old house in Florida.&nbsp; It just
so happened that this was one of Thomas Edison's assistants, former home.&nbsp;
As soon as they moved in they heard a baby crying.&nbsp; They could never
really quite tell where it was coming from and thought someone that lived
near by must have a child.&nbsp; As time went on and they met their neighbors
they realized that most of these folks were retirees and no one had a baby.&nbsp;
They continued to hear the baby cry off and on.&nbsp; One time they woke
up to strange drawings and letters on the windows of an inside door.&nbsp;
They heard other unexplainable sounds in the house also.&nbsp; When they
investigated the history of the home and its former owner, they found out
that they had more than one child who had passed away.&nbsp; Eventually
they moved and as they were all tired and it was late at night, the children
and their mom were laying on her big bed just talking.&nbsp; She got up
after a bit and got her last suitcase and opened it up.&nbsp; When she
did, the baby's cry came out with a whoosh of air.&nbsp; It was loud enough
to be very startling to everyone, but that was the last they heard of the
baby.</B>

<P><B>Dad's visits</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Stewarttm66@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>This isn't a story, just basically an expierences that I've had
since my dad passed away in 1999.&nbsp; The first experience was shortly
after the funeral it was only a ceremony at the local church, there was
no viewing as my dad's body had been sent off for cremation a few days
before.&nbsp; I never got the chance to day goodbye to my dad and it was
bothering me.&nbsp; Anyway I was sitting in my car by a river with my ex
fiance' and we were talking about my dad and his life.&nbsp; I remember
talking about how he loved the outdoors and takingh his family camping
and fishing.&nbsp; All of a sudden I felt a presence and the lights came
on in my car and all the windows rolled down.&nbsp; The keys were in my
hand and not in the ignition, the car was not running!&nbsp; It really
freaked me out for&nbsp; a moment until I realized that it was my father.&nbsp;
The expierence lasted just a few minutes.&nbsp; My exfiance' agreed that
it was just my dad saying goodbye.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't think much about the previous experience until about a
year later.&nbsp; It was the weekend and I was still in bed lounging, while
my exfiance' was in the kitchen making coffee.&nbsp; I suddenly got the
feeling that I wasn't alone in the room.&nbsp; I was afraid to move so
I laid as still as I could.&nbsp; I saw the mattress sink as if someone
sat down and the room was filled with the scent of Old Spice cologne.&nbsp;
I tried to stay in the room for as long as I could, but it was just a bit
too much and I got scared and ran out of the room.&nbsp; My exfiance' asked
what was wrong and then went into the bedroom and he too smelled the cologne.&nbsp;
We both agreed that my dad was letting me know that he was okay.</B>
<BR><B>I now look forward to the next time my dad comes to visit.&nbsp;
I hope I won't freak out this time.</B>

<P><B>By: Wifeofbilly@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I just wanted to share with you my experiences of the school.&nbsp;
I have been there on 2 different occasions, once about 6 years ago and
then again about 2 years ago.&nbsp; The first time I went out there I was
with 3 of my friends, we were about to stop the car and get out when we
saw a vehicle coming (it was around 9:30 pm) so we decided to turn around
and come back in a few minutes.&nbsp; The car came racing up behind us
flashing its lights behind me and kept getting right on my bumper everytime
I would speed up.&nbsp; As luck would have it, there was a full moon out
and I was able to get far enough a head of the other car to pop my head
lights out and drive by the moonlight where I cut down a side road and
lost them.&nbsp; We then returned to the site and were getting out of the
car and walking up to the gate when we heard someone scream and saw what
appeared to be some one lighting a cigarette.&nbsp; We then decided to
leave.</B>
<BR><B>Then about 2 years ago, a different set of friends of mine and I
decided to go back out there.&nbsp; We decided not to stop this time.&nbsp;
We went to the end of the road to turn around, at the end of the road there
are railroad tracks.&nbsp; It was a very clear spring almost summer night
and as we crossed the railroad tracks, a white apparition went across the
hood of my car (this was also a different car from the one I drove out
there the first time but I had just recently put the transmission of the
other car into this one) We got turned around and was about to pass the
school again irronically in almost the exact spot where the first inncodent
occurred, we saw a car flying up on our tail flashing its lights in my
rearview as it had done a few years before.&nbsp; Once again I was chased
at a high speed and almost didn't loose them until we got close to the
rural neighborhood about 5 miles up the road and then the car was gone.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The White Light</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MiracleMetsfan1@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>This summer i attended a socialist kibbutz-style sleepaway camp
in upstate new york. The story I'm telling takes place on a Friday night.
I was sitting around in my cabin with my friends, and it must have been
around 11:00 at night or later. All of a sudden, two boys in my kvutza&nbsp;
(which is an age group, sorry for the hebrew) named Benno and Noah burst
through the door, obviously very frightened. They claimed to have seen
a "white light" in the forest that was right behind where the cabins stood.
Being more curious than afraid, I went out with some of my friends to look
for this light, and i saw...nothing. I was quite dissapointed. I had heard
that two other boys in my kvutza had seen this light, so I went to talk
to one of them, whose name was Adam. Me and a friend of mine found him
in his cabin, and he told us the whole story. The previous year he had
seen the light between two of the boys cabins. He described it as a blinding
white light. He looked behind him to see if there was anyone else around
who could see it, but when he looked back, the light was gone. He saw it
again a year later in the same forest, but 50 or so yards away from where
he saw it the last time. This time he ran, though it followed him and remained
opposite him in the forest before dissapearing. I thought this was probably
just the boys scaring themselves, but some of the boys who had seen the
light got some counselors to go into the woods with them to look for it.
That night they all requested to sleep in different cabins, far from where
they saw the light. Though i didn't see the light myself i think there
must be some truth to the story, since all four of them who saw it were
very frightened and obviously not faking.</B>

<BR><B>The Dog</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kats_89@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is my first story and probably not my last. Well, in 4th grade
I had lost a dog that was my best friend and had grew up with. Naturally
I was real sad and cryed almost every night. That summer, I was alone in
my room (My mom was off doing errands) and I was thinking about my dog.
Just then I got a chill up the back of my neck. After about 5 seconds (the
chill still there) I heard a barking outside of my window. Now I kind of
recognized it because that was just how my dog barked. But when I went
to look under my window, there was nothing there. Yet the barking continued,
this time in my room. I remember that all I felt was a chill and sadness,
as if something was saying goodbye or something. I saw nothing, and felt
no fear. After about 3 minutes of the barking my mom came home. As soon
as she opened the door, the barking stopped. Since then I hadnt heard the
barking since. But the odd thing now is that we have a new dog (about 1
year) and he will never go to the same spot that my old dog went (she had
a certain spot she would go to the bathroom, and she liked it in my room).</B>

<P><B>My Very own Ghostly Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ktd7@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>About 3 years ago my cousin and I were driving back from a concert
at the Mayerson theater in Dallas, Texas. It was at night when we passed
by White Rock Lake to get back to his house. He started telling me the
story of the lady of White Rock Lake. Of course I was thinking this was
just another stupid take-off of the lady of the lake but I listned anyways.
He said that about 15 years ago a boy and girl were driving around the
lake around the same spot we were at right then, and that they swerved
off the road to avoid another car full of drunk drivers and ran straight
into the lake. The boy survived and ran off leaving the girl to drown.
Supposedly they never found her body, but on nights like this some say
they can see her walk around the lake like a glowing angel not paying attention
to anyone or anything thats surrounding her. After he finished I was thinking
yeah right but right then a lady dressed in white walked across the road
carrying a candle covered in&nbsp; moss, and walked right in front of the
car and into the trees not even paying attention to us even though we were
inches away from knocking her down and disappeared into the trees. He elbowed
me in the chest saying mockingly "maybe thats the lady of White Rock Lake."
and snickered at his lame joke but when we drove by the spot that I her
walk through I discovered that if what I had seen was real then she had
walked right into a very thick willow tree trunk. I have shared my experience
with many other people but none have believed me but I hope there are believers
and others who have witnessed the same type of unusual experience out there
for I don't think I imagined it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a short one. there is an old mission cemetery
near a place called mission bend (named for the old Christian mission for
Indians where all the students and teachers died from some illness in the
1800s) mission bend is located near mazie Oklahoma. I sometimes go fishing
at the river on mission bend&nbsp; state park. on only one occasion while
driving home after dark I drove slowly by the cemetery that is located
literally right beside the road. the teacher was not buried in the ground
she was buried in a tomb above the ground. anyway while I was driving past
I looked up to see a woman in a long dress (it looked white but I couldn't
tell for sure) and she was walking holding an old lantern. I watched her
for about 3 or 4 seconds as she slowly disappeared near the rear of the
cemetery. I have drove by there many times since but I have never seen
it again.</B><B></B>

<P><B>ISU Frathouse Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: moose187@comcast.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hello,&nbsp; I've been visiting this place for some time, and have
now decided to tell my story.&nbsp; (This is not the Frathouse in your
haunted places index)</B>
<BR><B>In the late summer of 99, I had to make the trek</B>
<BR><B>from the Chicago burbs to Illinois State University in order to
prepare my room for the upcoming semester.&nbsp; The day started out normal,&nbsp;
I made my way to Kingsley CT. and pulled up to my Frat house that I would
be living at.&nbsp; I was one of only 6 or 7 cars in the whole Court that
day.&nbsp; The court during the school year is a very busy place with a
lot of traffic and movement (the occasional Police breaking up a party,
or the Freshman vomiting on the way back to the dorms was just the tip
of the iceberg in the Court).&nbsp; At my frat house, there was only one
car in our parking section.&nbsp; It belonged to my friend who had come
to get his room finished and refurbished like I was doing.&nbsp; We did
our what's up routine and talked about each other's summer.&nbsp; We then
proceeded to look around at the other unoccupied rooms, because this was
our chance to snoop around without disturbing other peoples privacy.&nbsp;
An hour or 2 passed, and I decided to get to work on my room.&nbsp; My
room had for as long as most people that I've spoken to could remember,
was always a&nbsp; game room with a pool table in the middle of it.&nbsp;
I had another room also across the hallway, but it was too small and windowless,
so I used it as my closet and computer room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After&nbsp; cleaning up my new room, I began to paint the walls, and gloss
all the wood trim in the room.&nbsp; As I was about a third of the way
complete on my painting,&nbsp; I heard a loud noise like someone had jumped
down to were my door was from up stairs.&nbsp; This was possible, it was
only six or seven steps above my floor.&nbsp; (My room was the only room
on this floor, because this room was between the first and the second floor,,,,we
also had a third floor and a bedroom above my room).&nbsp; After I heard
the noise, I continued painting thinking it was my friend from earlier.&nbsp;
Not ten minutes later, the same thing happened while I had my back to the
door, and to the landing where this person might have jumped. ( I couldn't
see the landing, because there is a fire safety door that stays closed
unless propped open.)&nbsp; A little weary at this point, I decided to
turn on the radio and get back to work,&nbsp; Just when I was forgetting
the previous incidents, I heard what sounded like a stampede of people
fighting and banging around on the walls only ten to 15 feet behind me.&nbsp;
This commotion was extremely loud and had me nervous.&nbsp; So I exited
the fire door and went upstairs to find out what was going on.&nbsp; After
checking the upstairs with no luck, I went downstairs to do the same.&nbsp;
No One.&nbsp; I then went to look at the front of the Frat house in the
parking lot.&nbsp; I looked in the parking lot and realized I was the only
one parked in the Court.&nbsp; The other Frat houses in the Court had no
movement.&nbsp; I then got a little worried, and began to pack up my stuff
for the night, not staying overnight like I told my family I would.&nbsp;
As I was packing up,&nbsp; I got the feeling that someone or something
was waiting for me.&nbsp; I looked out my window and noticed the wind and
lighting in the distance.&nbsp; The weather wasn't&nbsp; that bad when
I went to have a look in the parking lot, but minutes later it looked like
it would rain cats and dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp; After putting away my supplies,
I made a quick exit out my fire door, and down a half flight of stairs
and through the main levels fire door that had been propped open, which
promptly closed itself as I walked out the main entrance and to my car.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Early in the semester. I came back from Labor weekend and was telling my
friends how my weekend was etc,&nbsp; when a couple of them started joking
around about the frathouse being haunted.&nbsp; They didn't get into much
detail, because these stories were told to them by older members.&nbsp;
One had to do with blood dripping on someone in a bedroom upstairs while
they were sleeping, and the other story had to do with Christmas break
when people stayed their and thought they heard a party going on and familiar
voices talking.&nbsp; Other then that all was calm until the end of the
school year.&nbsp; The last day of school and the last party of the year
another event happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had brought a girl I was dating up
to my room to be in the air conditioning (the only air conditioned room
in the frat house other then the Chapter room) , and to get away from the
crowd.&nbsp; While we were talking, she got a strange sick looking expression
on her face, and started to panic.&nbsp; After calming her down she began
to tell me that she saw a girl being beaten in the corner of the room,
and she told me a girl had been raped where we were standing.&nbsp; At
this point I wanted to believe her, but I didn't see anything in the area
she was talking about, and she started to cry.&nbsp; At about that same
time my alarm clock started going crazy!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I went
to shut it off, it wasn't set to go off.&nbsp; So I unplugged it and hurried
her out of the room hoping that we could forget about this and enjoy the
rest of the evening.&nbsp; Later that night I had a couple people stay
in my room and nothing happened.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The next year I had a roommate in the same room I had been
staying in, and nothing happened until mid October.&nbsp; It had been a
long night of fun,&nbsp;&nbsp; Before going to bed, about 5 or 6 of my
friends were in my room talking about the night, when all of a sudden we
heard my fire door open and saw a shadow being cast onto the ground from
the light outside my door (my room was pretty dark at the time)&nbsp; I
called hello and said come in, but nobody answered, I then got up and looked
in the hallway, and my door was shut and the shadow and the light was gone.&nbsp;
A couple of my friends thought they felt or heard something also, but nothing
was there.&nbsp; We tried to recreate the shadow, and the closest we got
was when someone would crouch down as far as they could go, to make a similar
shadow., so what ever it was, was probably only a few feet tall!&nbsp;
A couple months later, my roommate and I were messing around taking pictures
with my digital camera, and notice a lot of little orbs moving to different
locations,&nbsp; We joked about it, and I told him all my ghost stories
(which I probably already told him).&nbsp; Not to long after, my roommate
and his girlfriend were spending an early Friday evening laying around
and cuddling. (I had went home for the weekend).&nbsp; While my roommate
and his girlfriend were sleeping my roommate woke up and noticed a green
smokey cloud in the corner of the room by the door.&nbsp; My roommate was
no chicken sh-t, he had survived a drive by shooting, and was an all around
tough kid who wasn't afraid of much.&nbsp; When I got back that weekend,
he told me what he saw and that he was so scared he closed his eyes and
just held on tight to his girlfriend who wasn't a witness to this spooky
mist that seemed to be observing them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around this same time,
I had been hearing people jumping on our ceiling from the third floor,&nbsp;
I just played it off as people being drunk upstairs, this happened every
once and a while, usually when I was the only one in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One time I was messing with my DJ equipment in my room one afternoon when
I felt the bouncing of someone walking right up behind me.&nbsp; No one
was there.&nbsp; I felt this a few times that day.&nbsp; I continued to
hear the banging and jumping upstairs, so I decided to check it out.&nbsp;
I ran to the bedroom that was usually kept open during the day, hoping
to catch someone in the act, and was surprised to see no one was there.&nbsp;
I went down the hallway and found someone studying and asked them if people
had been up here, or if he might have heard any jumping or banging, he
replied no with a "what kind of question is that look".&nbsp; So I left
it alone.&nbsp; That was my last year living in the frathouse.&nbsp; During
the summer, I came down to school to watch my friend's band play.&nbsp;
After the show, some of us met back at the frathouse to have a couple beers.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;We were all outside when what looked like a bright flash of
light came from the frathouse's foyer.&nbsp; I even remeber a couple people
saying, who took the picture, and nobody had a camera, we were a little
freaked, but people just wanted to party and forgot about the incident
quickly.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;When I moved back for my last year, I moved into an apartment
complex near railroad tracks on the southwest side of campus.&nbsp; During
the first couple weeks, my "troublemaking roommate" would all of a sudden
have his radio turn on and his cd player play song # 6,&nbsp; my two roommates
and myself thought it strange and didn't rule out the possibility that
it was a ghost.&nbsp; Still early in the year I saw one of my apartment
neighbors walking from class, so I offered her a ride.&nbsp; She joked
around about ghosts in her apartment, and I told her I believe her.&nbsp;
She asked me why, and I told her that we kept having electrical problems
and the radio would go on.&nbsp; She looked surprised and said no way,
because her roommates radio would do the same thing, and it would blast
song number 6 also.&nbsp; Crazy Crazy.&nbsp; After having a few minor questionable
experiences that year, and having pretty much kicked out my slacker bad
news roommates, it was calm and quiet (maybe the ghost moved into one of
their vacant rooms ha ha).&nbsp;&nbsp; With a week left before finals,&nbsp;
We had our usual Saturday night after-hours party at the Frathouse.&nbsp;
It was a good time, but people left a little early do to Finals.&nbsp;&nbsp;
While packing up my DJ equipment in the Frathouse basement, a friend and
I being the last ones to leave witnessed a 50lb loud speaker that was set
on its side (the stable balanced way) slide off a file cabinet and crash
onto the floor, for no reason at all.&nbsp; It seemed as though my friend
ran to me or got pushed to me so he wouldn't get hit by this moving object.&nbsp;
We looked at each other kind of confused, but thinking that what we had
just seen was impossible.&nbsp; There was no way it could have fallen like
it did, no one was there to push it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In away, I felt that whatever
happened there that last night was the Ghost/House 's way of saying goodbye,
and keeping the the stories alive for the younger generation of memebers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks for reading, hope it was entertaining.</B>

<P><B>By: cordonez1@nc.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I moved in with my sister before she had her baby.&nbsp; Well after
my niece was born thats when things started to get werid. My sister put
the baby in her basenet or crib. She closed the door so it would be more
quite for her.So we were in the living room talking about stuff and all
of sudden we hear a crash in the room were the baby was. We screamed "The
baby!", we ran to room and open it, and my niece was quitely sleeping in
her crib and we looked around to see if anything had fallen but no everything
was were it was supposed to be. We weren't scared just really mad that
what ever it was, it was trying to mess with the baby.</B>
<BR><B>Another thing was when my sister woke up and it was freezing in
the house she went to see if the air condition was on, and it was. It&nbsp;
was weird because it was the middle of winter and she asked her husband
but he didn't&nbsp; turn and I wasn't home that time, after that I blessed
the house with holy water.</B>

<BR><B>Do Not Disturb</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: E4matter@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I would like to share with you an experience i have witnessed.
It may not be scary, but the after thoughts had me shaking. One time, me,
my younger brother and my 2 cousins were hanging out in my living room.
There were the only four of us, everyone else including my parents went
next door to my neighbors house for a party. As we all sat there in the
living room, we ran out of subjects to talk about until i brought up the
subject about ghost. My cousin then asked me if my house was somewhat haunted.
Me being unsure whether if it was haunted or not ask a question out loud.
I said in a loud voice "If there is a ghost in this house, let the picture
on the wall fall down". We waited for 5 seconds after I said this but nothing
happen. But then the door upstairs (which is my sister's room) bang shut
really loud. Me, my brother and my 2 cousins ran as soon as this happen.
We went outside to talk about it and figure it might be my sister playing
a joke on us (please note that that day was a very hot and humid day with
no wind whatsoever). We then went to my neighbor's house to see if my sister
was there. Turns out that she was there the whole time. This is very freaky
to me because the owner of the house before died of old age in the hospital
(as i heard). I'm just guessing that she gave us a sign as not to disturb
her. Thanks for reading.</B><B></B>

this house, I was told that right down the block, there was a kid who drowned
in a swimming pool and died. Me being the skeptic that I am, didn't mind
the whole situation. One night while i was in the back patio drinking and
talking to my family, I heard a baby crying. I wasn't so sure the first
time that i heard it so i kind of ignored it. Abut 2 minutes later, I heard
the cry of the child again. This time I was pretty sure that my mind wasn's
playing tricks on me. I tried to trace the sound of the cries as where
it was coming from. The sound led me under the tree further in the backyard.
As I look under the tree, I saw a little boy at the age of 2-3 looking
at me. I wasn's scared or anything, but I knew it was the little child
ho drowned so I kinda shook it off and went back to the patio to talk some
more. I sat there for about an hour then I went in. When I went in, my
brother ask me where is johnny (johnny is the little kid who lives there
with them). I said Johnny is the room sleeping with his mom. My brother
said he just saw a little child sitting on my lap as I was sitting there
talking. I told him no one was near me at that time nor did any child sat
on my lap. As soon as I said this, my borther knew that the story about
the child drowning was true. I told him I knew it was the little child
because when i was sitting there, I felt as if someone was near me and
I was cold as ice. Then there's this tme when both of my parents went to
the casino with me and my siblings at home. As I was taking a glance outside
my window towards the backyard, I saw a little kid betweent he age of 2-3
playing on my little newphews playskool basketball hoop. The little kid's
appearance was exactly as i was told, he was a little Lao kid (lao is a
type of asian people).</B>

<P><B>The House I grew up In</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:adavila@fcrc.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>There are several stories regarding my old residence.</B>
<BR><B>When my sisters and I were very young or Grandfather died in our
home of a heart attack. As we grew up there were a few unexplained happenings.
There was a voice calling our names (very clear), but this would only happen
when we each were alone. The chair my grandfather died in would rock as
if he was still sitting in it, etc.</B>
<BR><B>After I moved out of the house my sister inherited it. She and her
son lived there and there were voices, shadows that moved around the basement
and livingroom, but the most bizarre "ghost",&nbsp; of what appeared to
be a woman, very short/small about half the height of a doorway. (Note:
they were not the only people to see this woman or seem to notice a presence
in the house.) She would stay in front of the middle bedroom but was not
standing on the floor but suspending herself in between the upper part
of the doorway, with hands and legs holding herself in place. We had suspicions
on who or what this ways. My sister was friends with a woman who had brittle
bone disease she was very small and lived in a wheelchair. We suspect she
was the "ghost" because they were very close&nbsp; all through their lives
and up until the day the woman died. The ghost never really bothered them
but was a bit intimidating at times.</B>
<BR><B>Now the house is sold to new owners we do not know if there have
been any sightings or experiences since.</B>

<BR><B>Hauntings in Woburn, MA</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CELEXLORI@wmconnect.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Back in the 70's-(1976) This was a private residence that my family
rented.</B>
<BR><B>The grass was so tall in the back yard, we needed a sickle to cut
it down.</B>
<BR><B>The house is directly beside a rail road track and across the street
from Friendly's Restaraunt. Today, the house is a Real Estate Company.</B>
<BR><B>Right from the start I knew this house was "different". Psychadelic
lights were installed in the living room ceiling, and my bedroom had pink
and lavender leopard wall paper. This was strange enough but things started
to get eerie right away.</B>
<BR><B>The back room was my parents bedroom. There was a blood stain on
the wall. Or a red stain that dripped partially and then stuck on the wall
paper. It was dried. Not brown, but the color of fresh blood. we couldn't
remove it. At night, out side my parents window a harmonica would play.
Or, what sounded like a harmonica, would play some whinning melody. My
father, a devout catholic who didn't believe anything he couldn't see,
would yell out the window. "For Christ, sake will somebody shut that guy
up?" And my mother would repeatedly tell him there was no one out there.</B>
<BR><B>Our english setter's hair would go on end and she would bark at
the couch when no one was sitting on it. this happened in the living room
outside my parents bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>Also, the rocking chair in the same room, rocked on it's own. My
father worked late as a security guard and since we only had the one car
my mother would pick him up. On one night, my sister and I decided to stay
behind and watch the only tv which was in their room. I don't remember
the show, I think it was Mission Impossible, but right in the middle of
the episode, the tv started to act funny and this hideous face appeared.
I can't even describe it but it wasn't normal looking. Or mortal looking.
This scared us so much we screamed until our parents came home.</B>
<BR><B>By then the show had resumed and the face was gone. I think it important
to tell you that I am not easily swayed to believe things, but ever since
that night I have researched and watched every episode of Mission Impossible
I could find and haven't yet seen that face. I was 14 at the time of the
experience.</B>
<BR><B>the house at 78 Washington St. started to "live on it's own" that's
the best way I can put it. My mother lost her lazy susan when we moved
in. A lazy susan is a plate on a revolving platform. She inherited it from
her mother. We couldn't find it but we all heard it spinning, and one day
my sister found it in the cellar on top of a box. Right out in the open.</B>
<BR><B>The cellar was extremely creepy. A place you'ld be afraid to go
into alone. The floor was only partially finished with concrete and the
rest the size of a plot was literally a mound of earth. Like something
was buried there. We (my brother and sister and I) wanted to dig it up
but our mother went crazy which scared us from doing so.</B>
<BR><B>The back room of the cellar had it's own door and my sister and
I used it for a play room but often were driven out by an over whelming
sensation of being watched by a menacing force.</B>
<BR><B>As a trio, my brother, sister and myself were pretty ingeniouse.
We thought the house was haunted and decided to leave a tape recorder running
in our parents room to catch the harmonica playing.</B>
<BR><B>What we heard when we played back the tape the next day was a lot
of distorted noise like wind, broken harmonica notes and a deep muffled
(male?) voice clearly saying "Help Me" in a drone. We were facinated and
played it for everyone, who of course thought either my brother (who was
15 and didn't have a mature enough voice) did it, or our father. (The devout
catholic). Well we knew the truth.</B>
<BR><B>The last act before we moved out of 78 Washington St. occured one
night while my sister and I were sleeping in our pink and purple leopard
room. She woke me asking in a terrified whisper if&nbsp; I had just put
my hand on her. I said no. She said something was holding her down. The
room was dark, but I saw nothing. No glowing light, no orb. Nothing that
is talked about as being a ghostly apparition. Regardless, she started
screaming "it won't let me up!" then I started screaming and finally a
cousin rescued us. (She liked to drop in late) and my sister was free.
But, when we retold the tale no one believed us. Today my brother denies
everything. My sister is a professional psychic and I am an empath. Our
next experience was in the house we moved to at 2 Valley Road, in Woburn.</B>
<BR><B>The attic of 2 Valley Road was a hole in the master bedroom closet.
Everytime the closet door was open the person holding the door knob would
be rushed with anxiouse whispering. Again there was an ominous feeling
about the place, but the most interesting experience occured the day we
moved out. We had moved early, before our lease was up and my mother felt
unsure of leaving the empty house alone so she made me stay with her in
the living room. Just the two of us with our blankets. We went around the
house shutting and locking all the windows and the back and front door.
Then just as we settled into our "bed" on the hard wood floor in the living
room, a door slammed shut up stairs. My mother decided right then the house
could take care of itself and we left never to return. I have always wondered
about this experience, as people have told me the wind blew the door shut.
But, where did the wind come from if all the windows were closed? All the
doors had a wide girth so they actually touched the wall. It seemed to
me the door would have to be pushed.</B>
<BR><B>I hope you have enjoyed my experiences. I firmly believe the whole
town of Woburn, MA is haunted. I have never passed through without feeling
an eerie presence no matter what part of the town I am in.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Good GHosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:wabbit@ntlworld.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've read most of the storys on this web site and only a few have
been nice. My exsperience comes from when my mother died. It was miday
in 1976, and i was casualy looking out of my window when i saw a figure
that looked like my mother, she was the same hight and same in every other
way. Just as i took this all into my head she tured around and smiled and
gave me a wave and then just carried on walking down the road untill the
end and then she turned the corner and that was the last i saw of her,
on the occasion. Now see here my dad beleved every last word i had to say
about the incident because he saw her many times aswell, the sight was
comferting. Now my dad works as a comunicator with the dead.he always talks
with ghosts, and often with my mother, only a few of the ghosts he has
talked with been bad, and the only reason they are bothering you is because
they are annoyed because they are traped on earth instead of going onto
the afterlife like they should do, so they are forced to wander the world
untill someone sets them free to go to the afterlife. They annoy you because
they think you can free them, and you can if you try.</B><B></B>

<P><B>TRYING TO BE SCEPTIC.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: amanda_sissons@yahoo.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've allways been interested in the paranormal but tried to be sceptic
about most things i've experienced.</B>
<BR><B>I'l try to desribe my experiences but find it hard writing it down
than just talking about them. We've lived in our house (me, my husband
&amp; 4 kids) for 8 years. things pretty much started off straight away
with the feeling of a cat rubbing itself against me while cleaning my kitchen
we didn't have any pets at the time. Not long after that me &amp; my husband
had been argueing one night i went up to bed he slept on the settee at
04:17 i woke up sensing someone at the foot of my bed, thinkin it was my
husband i told him to F**** off but looking over at the door it hadn't
opened an inch, looking back at the figure realising it wasn't my husband
cause of the clothes it was wearing(trousers,shirt hanging out with a knitted
tank top over it) trying to figure out who it might be working my eyes
up its body i couldn't look above his chest something was stopping me from
looking at its face, i felt at ease that i just lied back down &amp; went
back to sleep didn't feel threatened at all. we later found out talking
to a neighbour that the previous owner had died in the kitchen of our house.
Things seem to happen when me &amp; my husband argue, in bed again on my
own thinking i was woken up, (cause i cant work out if i am awake or asleep)
with somthing lying on my back pinning me to the bed so i feel paralysed
i cant turn my head to see what it is. What worries me is when my kids
wake up in the night shouting for something to move &amp; leave them alone
but that doesn't happen often which i'm glad. A couple of years after moving
in we did get a dog a staffordshire bull terrier had a fantastic temprement
but on some days/nights would look in the kitchen going ballistic at something
that wasn't there then he would switch direction to the Hi-Fi unit &amp;
do the same. At the beginning of this year the stafford ran off. 6 months
ago we bought a chihauhau ven though he's a puppy he does exactly the same,
he sleeps on my pillow at night &amp; when we're asleep he'l sometimes
wake up barking at something that isn't there. To this day things go missing
then turn up in the most ridiculous places that you now they wernt there
when you looked for them.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Town House Ghost.</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Martiniquejc@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello I live in Norfolk, Va. I have a very interesting story to tell.
I've</B>
<BR><B>been living in this Town House for 4 years. The first experience
was when my</B>
<BR><B>then 3 year old saw a "man". We were all upstairs my fiancee,son,daughter</B>
<BR><B>and myself. My son asked where his sippi cup was? I said its downstairs
in</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen. So he proceeded downstairs to get it. Well not 30 seconds
later</B>
<BR><B>he came running upstairs screaming and crying. I have never, ever
seen my</B>
<BR><B>son this upset. I asked him what was wrong. He said that the man
was</B>
<BR><B>downstairs. My fianc&eacute;e asked what man and my son said the
mean man. Well my</B>
<BR><B>fianc&eacute;e picked him up and went downstairs with him and said
show me. He</B>
<BR><B>guided my fianc&eacute;e into the dining room area by the window.
To this day I do</B>
<BR><B>not know what my son saw. Well another incident happened when my
fianc&eacute;e's</B>
<BR><B>friend stayed two weeks with us. We woke up one morning and went
downstairs.</B>
<BR><B>His friend asked us why my little boy was downstairs standing by
the front</B>
<BR><B>door at 2:00 a.m? We told him this was impossible because my son
was still</B>
<BR><B>sleeping in his crib at this time. There was no way for him to get
out</B>
<BR><B>unless we got him out. Well I don't know who these ghost are? They
never</B>
<BR><B>seem to do any harm though. At times we will hear someone walking
around</B>
<BR><B>upstairs or hear doors slam. Well thank you for letting me share.</B>

<P><B>The Little Man</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rsturt@cox.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello My name is Alex B. I am from Virginia Beach, VA.&nbsp; I was
on your site</B>
<BR><B>and thought I would share my ghost story with you.</B>
<BR><B>My parents had recently gotton divorced and my mom and I&nbsp; were
living with</B>
<BR><B>my aunt and uncle in their small one story house.&nbsp; A lot of
problems were</B>
<BR><B>going on with the house and it just had a bad environment to it.&nbsp;
My aunt</B>
<BR><B>deceided to move to Norfolk, VA and we were to help clean and pack
the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; I was in the little laundry room getting clothes and
what not when I</B>
<BR><B>heard a man calling to me from the attic above the laundry room.
(the door</B>
<BR><B>was right on top, over the dryer).&nbsp; I looked up to find a short
man hunched</B>
<BR><B>down looking at me.&nbsp; He said "hey little girl, come here".&nbsp;
Of course I</B>
<BR><B>didn't go, but I did run away.&nbsp; I ran to my mom in the kitchen
and told her</B>
<BR><B>what had just happened.&nbsp; She told my aunt and they kind of
laughed at me not</B>
<BR><B>beliveing me, I was just a silly nine year old with a big imagination.
I</B>
<BR><B>begged them to go look and so they did.&nbsp; When they got to the
laudery room</B>
<BR><B>and looked up the attic the door was still wide open and the lights
in the</B>
<BR><B>attic were all turned on.(the only way to turn the lights on were
to actully</B>
<BR><B>go into the attic.)&nbsp; And I was way to short to open the attic
door even if I</B>
<BR><B>stood on the dryer.&nbsp; Needles to say we finished up the packing
that day and</B>
<BR><B>left the laundry room alone. We still talk about it to this day,
it's really</B>
<BR><B>creepy.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Devil Hunters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Frankie.Granillo@greenpoint.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I remember this like it was yesterday I'm not sure if you're going
to</B>
<BR><B>believe me, but when I was in</B>
<BR><B>the fourth grade me and my friend use to joke around about ghosts
and all</B>
<BR><B>that good stuff, being</B>
<BR><B>young I never really took that kind of stuff serious, (being 20
now it's</B>
<BR><B>pretty different) but me and</B>
<BR><B>my friend started this thing about called the Devil Hunters, little
school</B>
<BR><B>boy stuff you know, we just</B>
<BR><B>started investigating around the school yard, about 2 or 3 days
later I</B>
<BR><B>started having nightmares</B>
<BR><B>about demons and ghosts but that's nothing out of the ordinary,
but what</B>
<BR><B>really got me was one</B>
<BR><B>day I was sitting at my desk doing some work when out of no where
my pencil</B>
<BR><B>just fell to the floor</B>
<BR><B>so I picked it up and when I turned back there was a folded up piece
of</B>
<BR><B>paper so I opened it and</B>
<BR><B>the writing was so funky that I thought it was a joke by my friend
but then</B>
<BR><B>I realized my friend was</B>
<BR><B>out sick that day, and we told nobody about are little group that
we had,</B>
<BR><B>and that night I had a</B>
<BR><B>nightmare where I was sleeping in a big white bed and I wake up
look around</B>
<BR><B>then for some reason</B>
<BR><B>I look up to see an all white ghost with a skull like head just
flying</B>
<BR><B>around and around, the only</B>
<BR><B>reason I even woke up from the dream was because my mom woke me
and she was</B>
<BR><B>I was screaming</B>
<BR><B>so I told her about the dream I just had and she gave me a weird
look and</B>
<BR><B>she blessed me with</B>
<BR><B>Holy Water and that was the last time I had a dream but still til
this day I</B>

<P><B>The Dark Moon</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kfdragonfly12@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My name is Kailin, I'm only twelve years old, and I have a story
that will chill anyone's bones right down to the marrow.</B>
<BR><B>It was two days before I started school, Mom, and me were sitting
on the big corner couch. I was getting my stuff ready for Thursday, (my
first day of seventh grade), Mom was chewing on her nails, and my little
sister was running around the table pestering me.</B>
<BR><B>We all stopped what we were doing when we heard metal buckets rattle
in the back room and then fall (keep in mind, we are doing construction
on the house). I told Mom to go check it out, she decided to be a big chicken
and have us follow her. We walked over to the dresser so Mom could grab
a flashlight that had no batteries, she walked over to the bed and turned
on the night-light, as soon as she did that, the buckets fell harder into
the floor. This time we were all chickens, I grabbed my sister, Mom grabbed
her purse and we all ran across the street and pounded on Weizie's door.
Her fifteen year old daughter, Sammi, answered the door. Mom, and I were
both about three shades of white. Weiz came running down the hall in her
night gown and asked what happened. Mom told her and Sammi both, so then
Sammi wants to go check it out. Weiz handed my mom a flashlight, she grabbed
a knife, and Sammi grabbed her cel phone, my sister and I were left at
Weizie's. Mom told me what happened when they got back, " Before I even
stuck the key in the hole the hair on my arms stood up, so when we get
in there, Weiz went in your room and peeked into the basement through them
little holes in your floor. Sammi and me were standing over by air vent,
we could hear something heavy across the concrete floor down in the basement.
Weiz walked into the kitchen and started stomping on the floor, that made
whatever it was in the basement, mad. It started dragging it even faster
across the floor. So Weiz grabbed her knife and headed downstairs followed
by me and Sammi, we checked in every possible place you could think of.
When we finally got back up the stairs, Sammi sat on the couch, Weiz leaned
against the fridge and I stood over by the rocking chair. I was talking
to Sammi, then stopped because I heard light footsteps on the stairs,I
said 'well, whatever it is, its on the stairs!' we all ran out the door,
followed by the dog, and went to the front of the house. The thing in the
house started to pound on the front door, the rest is just too spooky.
I'll tell ya later." That night we didnt go back home, but the next day
we did, nothing ever has happened since that one night. We've had spooky
things happen before, but never like that. After all, it was the dark moon.</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: raingoddess_72@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I went to stay at my friend's house in East Wenatchee. She had just
moved into the house so she told me about the history of the land that
it was on. She said that it used to be an ancient Indian burial ground.
One night we were standing in the kitchen talking. I saw a weird shape
walk behind me. I got a little freaked so I asked my friend if she saw
something just a little taller than me walk behind me. She said that she
didn't want to say anything about because she thought that it was just
her imagination. Then, the next day, her mom had to run to the store so
my friend's sister went with her. I was watching TV and my friend was finishing
a painting. Then I heard the hair dryer in her mom's bathroom turn on.
I told my friend and she said that the electricity in there doesn't work.
I was getting kinda scared so I asked my friend if anything else weird
happened before I came over. She told me that sometimes when they want
to watch a movie the TV won't work if a certain spot on the couch is occupied.
The lights also have to be out. She's had other experiences like seeing
someone in her closet at night. Before she moved she also had ghost problems
that even some of her other friends could see.</B>

<P><B>Miscellaneous Ghost Questions</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. These are my ghost experiences up to now. I ve always been interested
with ghosts, always. My father had this one story, as a young man out of
college he rented a tiny apartment that was the second floor of a very
old 2-family house, it had one time been a single family farmhouse, but
it had since been converted to a 2-family place. So my father lived in
the second floor of the house with a roommate. My dad would often wake
up at night to someone tapping him on the shoulder, in a angry rage he
d run across to the hall to where his roommate slept and would wake him
and asking him why he was awakening him with these tappings...the roommate
knew nothing of this and would yell at my father from waking him up. Sometimes
it was vise-versa, my father would be awaken by his roomate demanding to
know why my dad had to wake him, of course my dad didn t know anything
of this. Then one night, my dad s roomate had eventually gotten married
and moved away, so my dad was all alone in this place, so one night my
dad s lying in bed attempting to sleep, when he feels pressure at the bottom
of his mattress, like someone was standing on it, he rememembers hearing
the creaking of the mattress as whatever it was walked across the bed,
then he could feel great pressure on his back as if someone was kneeling
on him, then a great whack over the back of the head followed by a woman
s voice yelling "LIE THERE AND CAKE!" it makes no sense, to this day my
dad doesn t know what it meant but he swears he was not dreaming because
he stayed wide awake the rest of the night until some sunlight came through
his room. That s my dad s story of ghosts. Perhaps that ghostly message
is some old-fashioned term for something? Is the whole ghost hearing and
seei thing genetic maybe? Anyway here s my little ghost experiences, though
not as extreme as my dads. We live in cape, it was built in 1954 and as
far as the history goes we know an old couple lived here before us. The
old woman died from taking care of her husband hand and foot, I ve heard
people say she died in the house, my parents said it wasn t true. When
my parents bought this house back in 1985 it was a wreck, it had been deserted
for a year, and on top of that the old couple didn t take good care of
the house at their old age. I heard tales of the old couple, they always
wanted children but couldn t have them for whatever reason, well my parents
bought this house as a starter home but they never left, they had 3 children
(myself included) and we ve expanded a lot to this house...and sometimes
I just get the feeling that the old woman is still here, and she s happy
children are finally living in her house. I don t know it s just that vibe
I get. So this one time I was about 11 years old I had my friend P.J was
sleeping over we slept in our living room. In the morning P.J told me that
he heard footsteps keep running up and down the stairs, the staircase ascends
from the living room, I didn t believe in him, but he swore it was the
truth. It was later on I learned that P.J s mom could talk to ghost s too,
she said T.J has had ghostly expereinces but he was embarrased of them
and didn t like talknig to them, thats when I remembered the stair incident!
Maybe P.J was seeing things about the house that I never could because
he had that&nbsp; gift . Anyway to make this thing short, I want to know
what people thing of my ghost tales, and if someone out there...might know
how to contact dead people, like somehow spark the gift of hearing them.
I would want to know so email me at blinkidDFP@msn.com. Thanks for reading
my story.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp; My family and i and our next door neighbours went to marrysville,
Australia. We stayed at a small bungalo hotel thing, there were more than
10 rooms with two bunks in each room. my family chose room number two and
our friends took room number one. Now there are six rooms in the fiirst
half of the bungalo seperated by two coridoors then there is a door and
the rest of the rooms and a male and female toilet block.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; When you walk in the main door way you look left and there
is room five and the door seperating the coridoors. As our familys took
only two rooms the rest of the bungalo was locked and he door was closed.
LAte that night my dad and his frind were having a barbeque along with
my sister, and our next door neighbours two kids. I wen't up to the bungalo
with my mum and her friend. We walked in the front door and for some strange
reason the lights weren't working,&nbsp; so i stayed close to the door,
( i have a fear of very dark places, and my belieif of ghosts also kicked
in) and when i finally mustered up enought courage i let go of t door handle
and walked in the complete darkness to fing my mum and her friend, i looked
left and the light under the door of room number five was on. I got really
scared at this poiing and waled faster and bumped into the back of my mum's
frind. She finaly found the light switch and turned it on. When i loked
back to see if i had really seen the light, it was off.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I didn't tell anyone untill the morning i didn't want to
scare my self anymore, after all i had to spend the night there. And did
i mention that room number five was locked? In the morning i walked down
to the toilets at the far end of the bungalo and had a weird feeling as
i passed that room, i felt preasure on my chest in that half of the coridoor,
so when i got back to my half i felt a lot better. I asked my sister and
her two young friends to come to room five with me and i took photos of
them in there, nothing came out , it was all black....</B>

<P><B>A Personal Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kokomolady@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>All my life I have lived in haunted houses and I am not scared of
the haunting just curious about why they are still there.</B>
<BR><B>I live in Kokomo Indiana and I first noticed this woman when I was
15.&nbsp; We lived in the silk stockings neighborhood on West Taylor Street
in a duplex.&nbsp; And that is when I first met the Lady.</B>
<BR><B>The Taylor Street House was an extremely haunted house.&nbsp; You
could have the fire place on in the dining room along with the heaters
and still see your breath and thing would go missing, only to be found
where you knew that they could not have been.&nbsp; That was at first then
Doors would slam and light would turn off. Then thing started to get more
personal.&nbsp; I was walking down the stairs and felt hands on my back
and I was pushed.&nbsp; I know that I would have went through the window
at the bottom if it had not been for the Lady.&nbsp; She was all of a sudden
between me and the window, and gone the next second.&nbsp; She wore a white
night gown and had long black hair and sad eyes. She was a younger woman
about 26-30 at the oldest.</B>
<BR><B>My best friend said that he heard a mans voice yelling at him to
get out.&nbsp; And the only men that lived at the house was my little brothers.&nbsp;
Then after the voice ordered him out he felt ice cold and ran home.&nbsp;
During the time we lived there my middle brother took on some character
traits that are not at all like him. He became extremely violent and wanted
to try to choke people when he was angry.&nbsp; After we moved he went
back to "normal" and is the best young man.</B>
<BR><B>Even after we moved though I have still seen the Lady.&nbsp; She
has been seen by a few people besides me but she does not do any thing.&nbsp;
A friend of mine said that she attached herself to me.</B>
<BR><B>But moved 2 years ago back to the same neighborhood one street over,
on West Mulberry Street, and the lady has been more active as of late.</B>
<BR><B>This house is not as bad as the other one, but there is a little
girl that walk around.&nbsp; She is between 5-9 years old, and has brown
hair and it is pulled up in an older style.. She will just walk around
and stare at you.&nbsp; She does not do anything, usually, when she is
up set she knocks things over.</B>
<BR><B>But now my sisters claim to have heard a man voice.&nbsp; And he
tried to get my one sister to come into a closet.&nbsp; And the Lady has
been active more than usual.</B>
<BR><B>I am not sure why the Lady has followed me all these years.&nbsp;
Any one who would have an idea I would love to hear it.</B>

<P><B>A Few Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jasminh88@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>hi my name is jasmin i live in Saint louis missouri. Once when i
was eight years old I was in my grandmas house and i was tryin to fall
asleep in the living room on the couch. I looked into the dining room and
i saw a white figure in the shape of a woman. the figure looked&nbsp; as
if it was trying to speak to me and while she was talkin she would move
her hands. i couldnt understand what she was saying. i went back because
i was scarred and i tried to go to sleep. I covered my face with the cover
and asked the woman politely if she could please go away. I fell asleep
while asking her. A couple of years later my grandma told me she had also
seen the woman various time and she told me that before she lived there
a crazy woman lived there and died there.</B>
<BR><B>Another time when i was in my home i was sitting in my sisters room
in the dark watching TV and i was home alone with my dad, Iooked into the
hall and i was a little man( maybe a boy ) Walk in to the bathroom. I only
told my brothers and sisters I didnt tell my parents. And a few years later
I overheard my mom talkin to someone and she said that everytime shes in
the bathroom she feels a presence and feels like she is being watched.
I feel the saome thing still even though that happened about two years
ago.</B>
<BR><B>About 9 months ago my mom had my aunt come bless the house because
my mom felt something evil in my home So my aunt came and as soon as she
walked in the door she felt a strong presence and she said she had to leave
and she would do it another time and she went running out the house and
didnt look back. Later that day my aunt said she left because she was soo
scarred she felt she had to run. She said she felt as if something was
going to attack her so she ran out the house and couldnt look back because
she felt she would see something she wouldnt want to see.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My grandfather's spirit</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: mariloubonilla2002@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This was the first time I've seen ghost or spirit and it was from
my grandfather's. The story I will tell you still gives me chill but I'm
trying not to think about it as much. I believe in superstitions and that's
the reason why my grandfather passed away.</B>
<BR><B>My mother received a phone call from her brother-in-law and reported
that my grandfather died during friday the 13th of January 1989. I was
eleven years old back then when I found out the tragedy. I believe on friday
the 13th, and my mother got into an accident during friday the 13th also.
Back to the story, we went back to our place where I grew up . There I
was standing and looking at my grandfather lying down on his coffin on
his way to heaven. There was a black out that night and the only light
they used during the funeral was the generator lights. I was pretty young
to be involved seeing ghosts. I was also a pretty brave girl during my
age. I wanted to get something upstairs in my father's room where we stayed
for awhile but then I didn't wanted to go there myself because there was
no lights at all. I asked my sister to go upstairs with me but she was
pretty scared going up there because there was no electricity. I told her,
"Fine, I'll just get it myself". I didn't thought about ghosts at all but
I knew it was dark up there. When I went upstairs with just a flashlight's
on but then it went out when I felt a cold air touched the back of my neck.
There was no lights at all, when I noticed the door was closed and seemed
like it's locked my itself. I tried to unlocked it but it seems like it
was sealed. Then all of a sudden there was this cold air again touched
my hair and I turned around and I couldn't believed my eyes of what I saw.
I saw a white surface kind of like a reflection. It was cold when it was
near me. I wanted to s eam so loud until someone spoke right infront of
me. I looked up and trying to see what it was, and there I saw my grandfather
standing there smiling at me. I couldn't recognize if it was really him
until I looked down and saw him holding a cane which he was using for him
to walk when he was alive. I had the mixed of tears and joy with fears
but that was the first time I ever saw a ghost in my life and this time
was from my beloved grandfather. When I saw his spirit that night, he told
me, "Don't be scared, I'm just looking out for you". I saw his half of
his body all the way up to his head but I didn't really see his legs or
anything. The only thing I remembered always be remembered was his smile
and his thoughts he said to me. That really touched my heart even today.
By the time he was buried, I will always remember his smile he gave me
that night. When i went back home where my grandfather's lived, I saw his
cane on the side of his rocking chair where he used to sit all the time.&nbsp;
From now on, when I think of him, I smile all the time. I know his hear
watching over me. I love him very much. Every year of his death anniversary,
we always celebrate it by going to church and pray for his soul. I love
you Grandpa.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Wet Little Girl</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: 2200754@smbstu.ballarat.edu.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had many supernatural experiences but this is a very intrigueing
one. I was living in an old house in Maryborough in Victoria, Australia.
one morning I awoke and from where my bed was I could see into the hall
to the kitchen. When I looked to the kitchen I saw a little girl in a white
nightie and she was dripping wet. I dont remember going back to sleep so
I think I might have fainted. When I got home that afternoon a friend was
over and when he sat on one of the Kitchen chairs it was soaking wet, all
the chairs were, if you put your hand on them water would come up out but
they were not leaking on to the floor( though that may just have been the
hard underside of the chairs) Their was no way water could have gotten
in through the windows and nothing else was wet, except for the chairs.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Time Warp?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: moondancers72@webtv.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>After reading many stories on your website, I've decided to share
an</B>
<BR><B>experience I had in 1974.&nbsp; I had been dating a great guy for
a few weeks</B>
<BR><B>when he invited me to spend a week-end camping with a large group
of</B>
<BR><B>friends.&nbsp; It was thrilling to sit out under the stars and talk.&nbsp;
Of</B>
<BR><B>course, the talk turned to ghost stories and each of us&nbsp; telling
of</B>
<BR><B>unusual events.&nbsp; On our way home, we took a wrong turn onto
the freeway</B>
<BR><B>and found we were heading from a campsite in WA state to the Oregon</B>
<BR><B>border.&nbsp;&nbsp; J and I&nbsp; decided to continue onward to
OR on an unscheduled</B>
<BR><B>drive down the coast highway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we drove south
the weather turned</B>
<BR><B>from sunny and warm to stormy, rainy and cold!&nbsp; After driving&nbsp;
on for</B>
<BR><B>several hours we chose to stop at a motel.&nbsp; The one we stopped
at looked</B>
<BR><B>a little worn around the edges but nice.&nbsp; When we got into
our room I</B>
<BR><B>remember thinking that nothing had changed much since the 1940's
or</B>
<BR><B>1950's, but at least it was warm and dry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We fell
into bed and went</B>
<BR><B>to sleep.&nbsp; Several hours later I woke up and through half sleepy
eyes</B>
<BR><B>had an UNUSUAL experience.&nbsp; It was if the view I was looking
at went</B>
<BR><B>wavy like a stone dropped in a pond.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I was
just tired but</B>
<BR><B>then I heard the MUSIC&nbsp; playing.&nbsp; I just lay there and
then it was like</B>
<BR><B>my rational mind took over.&nbsp;&nbsp; I started looking around
the room and the</B>
<BR><B>first thing I noticed was that the curtains had changed from a plain
to</B>
<BR><B>a checked pattern.&nbsp; MY mind told me that everything was okay
.&nbsp; Then I</B>
<BR><B>noticed the old radio on in the corner, glowing an amber light.&nbsp;
I kept</B>
<BR><B>looking around with my head still on the pillow, and saw some things</B>
<BR><B>that stopped my breathing for a moment.&nbsp; Drapped over the chair
was a</B>
<BR><B>man's white navy uniform and the hat was on the small dresser.&nbsp;
Also on</B>
<BR><B>the dresser was a big, flat 1940's type purse with a gardenia coursage</B>
<BR><B>on top.&nbsp; These things were NOT there when we went to bed nor
was there a</B>
<BR><B>radio playing.&nbsp; I looked over at J and he was asleep but his
t shirt had</B>
<BR><B>changed to like a tank type or BVD and he had Dog tags around his
neck.</B>
<BR><B>Also his moustache had changed to a neat trimmed one.&nbsp; I kept
looking</B>
<BR><B>and then I saw my left hand.&nbsp; There was a gold WEDDING BAND
on my hand</B>
<BR><B>that had definately NOT&nbsp; been there before.&nbsp; I kept looking
at J in his</B>
<BR><B>altered state and he just blissfully slept on.&nbsp; All I wanted
to do was</B>
<BR><B>close my eyes and so I did and then quickly opened them and everything</B>
<BR><B>was back to normal.&nbsp; I held my eyes shut for the next couple
of hours</B>
<BR><B>too weired out to sleep.&nbsp; The next morning, I noticed there
was no radio</B>
<BR><B>in the corner, etc.&nbsp; As we left the motel. J&nbsp; remarked
that he felt like</B>
<BR><B>he had been there BEFORE.&nbsp; I didn't tell him of my experience
but it</B>
<BR><B>haunted me for a long time.&nbsp; HAD he been there before in the
1940's</B>
<BR><B>before he was BORN???&nbsp; Me too?&nbsp; Sorry this is so long
but I've always</B>
<BR><B>felt this was very paranormal.&nbsp; Oh by the way, J had just gotten
out of</B>
<BR><B>the navy the year before...oh yeah</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Rushing Man</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Well I have had many experiences as a lot of people here... my is
kinds unnerving and helpful.. It all started about 3 years ago when my
husband and I first started dating... I stayed at his apartment and could
hear someone running back and fourth from the living room to the bathroom.
after about 10 min he then ran in the room and stopped right over me just
staring......after about a month I started to get use to it... well now
we are married and he is serving over in Iraq.. I had to pack up his apartment
and movie everything to storage....About a week after I started to hear
someone run from my bathroom to my room and it would get faster and faster
to the point where you could almost hear them breathing heavy... well one
night I thought it was my son getting up and down from bed because it started
out really slow moving to the side of my bed.. so without turning over
I would tell him to go back to bed it was late.. this happened about 3-4
times and stopped for awhile. well about 230am someone ran to the side
of my bed stopped and stared down at me. as I went to tell him to go back
to bed I felt a hand on my shoulder. now this was a large hand not the
hand of a 2 year old.. very very cold and a sense of extreme fear rushed
through my body..... now so you know my son's room is on the other side
of my bathroom and there is a door on both side to walk through.. I jumped
up out of bed and ran to check on my kids.. as I got to my 2 year old......the
closer I got to my son the more I felt scared.. when I had gotten to him
he began to have a seizure........there was another time I was home alone
with my kids my niece and nephew......it was about 10pm and I began to&nbsp;
hear knocking but down stairs on a window.. it got louder and louder. I
went to the top of the stairs to see if I could hear exactly where it was
coming from... now I had checked on all kids about 5 min prior and they
were all fast asleep... as I stood at the top I felt someone walk up behind
me and push. I caught my self but I slipped down about 2 steps.... I then
went to recheck my kids and my 2 year old had stop breathing..... after
that night it has calmed down all I know is that whom ever the rushing
man is has helped me but has terrified me at the same time..</B>

<BR><B>The Person Peeking</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: madd_killah419@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I used to live in the Philippines last 4 years ago. I live in a simple
and nice place. I was about 12 years old and I was taking a shower outside
our house. Well it was a pump where you have to pump just to get some water.
I&nbsp; was taking a shower and it was around 10 or 11 at night. The weather
is pretty much fair. Our house is close to the cemetery just few blocks
away however this didnt stop me taking a shower that night. When i was
taking a shower the water is pretty much cold. I notice someone is looking
or peaking at me when i was taking a shower in our house. I thought it
was my uncle because he always do this jokes just scare me. I called his
name out however there was silence and noyone answered. I just ignored
it for a while and i just look at it quickly when his head up to the wall.
I was shock because the figure of his face is different from us. He has
long hair and his eyes are like hot flames. His skin color looks like its
burnt. I just look at him without moving because i was to scared to move.
Then he slowly put his head back and then puffed his gone. All of my family
in the house saw this supernatural being.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Ghosts that follow Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LuVnMeLnRiChArD@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, let's see where do I begin. Ever since I was little I've always
had experiences with the dead.I used to live with my grandparents in a
doublewide trailer in california and everynight there would be four people
leaning over my bed, staring at me and talking to eachother, they were
a misty whitish blue. You could see through them and it began when my mother
bought me my own bed( that she had gotten at a yard sale). Every morning
I woul;d be in the living room watching t.v. and I would have this feeling
that something was watching me, so I looked to my left and there is this
very tall man, with long hair and a long beard, wearing overalls staring
at me. That would last about 10 to 15 sec. before he disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>There was also this one time I went into my parent room into the
big walkin closet( I used to play dress-up with their clothes). And the
door shut on me and in on section of the closet the clothes and hangars
started shaking. I was terrified. I tried to get out but the door wouldn't
budge, then I looked at the shaking clothes because I heard something growl,
And this big face jumped out from behind them at me! Just then, my grandpa
opened the door and everything stopped. He started looking around the closet
and told me to stop making so much noise. But, it wasn't me. I tried to
tell him but nobody ever believed me. It all stopped after that until just
recently. I went to work with my mother, (she works at a elementry shool)
I wa helping her so I went to clean the kindergarten bathrooms. As I was
cleaning the mirrors ( and this was around midnight ) I saw something run
across the room. I thought I was just tired. But I did feel as if I were
being watched. I quickly finished and started out the door. As I was walking
back I looked down and saw a shoe. I looked behind me and no one was there.
I started moving faster and something pushed on my shoulder I didn't dare
look back, I dropped my stuff and ran for my life! I told my mom about
it and she didn't believe me. About&nbsp; a week later. My mom came back
from work and told me she believed me now because she was&nbsp; cleaning
in the same bathroom when the lights shut off, she went over to the door
,stuck her key in the light switch and tried to turn the lights back on,
she couldn't so she headed out to clean&nbsp; somewhere else. That is when
she was also pushed. I don't know why they follow me. If anyone can answer
my question, feel free to e-mail me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Singing in the Hallway</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kstampfli@lionelsawyer.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>You know before I begin to tell you this story, I have had a lot
of</B>
<BR><B>experiences happen to me when I was growing up in my parents house
for a long</B>
<BR><B>time I was the only one who was seemed to be bothered and I could
tell you</B>
<BR><B>hours of stories but I chose just one because I am now able to finally
talk</B>
<BR><B>about it amoung all the past it has taken me a long time because
I never told</B>
<BR><B>a soul anything and with some things I still refuse to share but
here is one I</B>
<BR><B>will tell you.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;When I was about 8 or 9 years of age my grandfather was going
to take me to</B>
<BR><B>his cabin at the lake to spend some time with him we had some other
family</B>
<BR><B>members up there aswell but none in my family because I wanted the
time with</B>
<BR><B>my grandfather. After I had gotten all settled in up stairs in the
bedroom</B>
<BR><B>with the bunk beds which I was not to happy about to be up stairs
anyway</B>
<BR><B>because it was filled with energy that gave me a tummy ach and everytime
you</B>
<BR><B>would turn you back you would feel a brush of cold air or see people
going</B>
<BR><B>into the other bedrooms out of the corner of your eye. It was always
hard for</B>
<BR><B>me to sleep the first night of arrival at the cabin so I layed in
bed and</B>
<BR><B>waited and finally fell asleep but was woken up to hear a baby cry
in the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen and a man talking to him/her so I remembered that a couple
of our</B>
<BR><B>family friends were up there with there daughter Paige. I went into
there</B>
<BR><B>bedroom to see if they were awake and they were all in a deep sleep
including</B>
<BR><B>the baby and all the lights were off in the kitchen and down stairs
area, no</B>
<BR><B>one was there. So I crawled back into bed and fell asleep once more
and was</B>
<BR><B>woken up this time to see a group of children standing in a circle
in the hall</B>
<BR><B>way right infront of my bedroom but I could only see an outline
of them not</B>
<BR><B>the face or entire body they were singing "Ring Around The Rosey"
and I could</B>
<BR><B>not speak nor scream nor move I was frozen and all I could feel
myself do was</B>
<BR><B>go completley pail and when I felt my breath come back I screamed
and our</B>
<BR><B>family friend Karen came into my bedroom and I was shaking and histarical
and</B>
<BR><B>was not quit sure at what just happened so she stayed up with me
until my</B>
<BR><B>grandfather awoke in the morning and everyone thought I was crazy
and that I</B>
<BR><B>was dreaming. I will tell you something I am about 12 years older
now and I</B>
<BR><B>remember that night like it was yesterday my mom and dad beleived
me because</B>
<BR><B>they to have had things happen up at the cabin and to this day I
am truley the</B>
<BR><B>only one who still hears children, but my family is the only family
meaning my</B>
<BR><B>dad, mom, brother, and sister who pays attention to these encounters
in this</B>
<BR><B>house and my last visit up there was about a month ago it seemed
quiet but I</B>
<BR><B>can always feel the energy but I do not show fear anymore I realized
that all</B>
<BR><B>these children who choose to wake me up in the night come for a
reason and yes</B>
<BR><B>it is heart pumping and scary but they are lost. It took me a long
time to</B>
<BR><B>understand why these children would constantly visit me all the
time when I</B>
<BR><B>was sleeping until I went to a wonderful women who I have become
attached to</B>
<BR><B>who I sat down with and I did not share anything with her I let
her see it and</B>
<BR><B>she told me that In a passed life I owned a shelter for children
and I took</B>
<BR><B>care of them all and there were tons of children everywhere and
they are</B>
<BR><B>trying to find me. I could go on and on with you but I did want
to share just</B>
<BR><B>one story with you. Thank you!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Real Ghost Encounter</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Sentfrmabove02@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Once, my friend xavier and my boyfriend lalo and I went walking in
this old abandoned lot. The kind of lot where scary stories take place.
It was pitch black outside. It was a lil cold but not too bad. We were
talking, telling stories...some funny, some scary, and all stupid. Then
all the sudden, the night got darker outside, the wind blew harder, it
got colder, and the place just seemed to get over all scarier...We kept
walking when all the sudden the scariest thing happened...we saw a ghost...yea...it
was scary</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghostly Experiences</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi!&nbsp; I just wanted to say, that it the website is amazing! I
can't stop reading the stories!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I hope that you can use
my story on your website!</B>
<BR><B>Jill.</B>
<BR><B>The house that I grew up in, has for as long as I can remember,
scared me. It was just a regular, two storey house but I could never go
to bed on my own, or be upstairs alone. I heard pots and pans being moved
around,&nbsp; voices, the stove drawer being opened and closed...</B>
<BR><B>My Dad worked Monday to Friday from about 5am until 6pm. (He worked
out of town)&nbsp; So after school my sister, brother and I had to fend
for our selves.&nbsp; I was the&nbsp; youngest,&nbsp; and I “had” to watch
cartoons after school; while my brother and sister, being older, often
hung out with their friends.&nbsp; On one particular day, I got home, turned
on the TV, and waited for my cartoons to start.&nbsp; That was when I heard
footsteps up stairs.&nbsp; I thought that my sister or brother must have
gotten home before me, so I paid no atttention to it.&nbsp; Then I heard
it walk from my room, through the other room, to the stairs.&nbsp; I heard
the banister creak from the weight of someones grip and then the footsteps
coming down the&nbsp; stairs...&nbsp; I sat there, waiting to see who it
was. There was a wall so I couldn't tell who it was right away. I could
only see the last 2 or 3 steps, so I waited. The footsteps stopped at the
end of the stairs, and I could see no one.&nbsp; I sat there like I was
in a daze, then it was like my brain suddenly realized that I should have
seen SOMEONE! Or SOMETHING! So I jumped up and I ran out of the house.&nbsp;
I was so afraid.&nbsp; I stayed outside until my Dad came home.&nbsp; I
never told him, or anyone what happened that day.</B>
<BR><B>Another part of the house that always freaked me out was the bathroom.&nbsp;
I hated being in there night or day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this only happened
to me once and I am very glad.&nbsp; As I was sitting on the toilet doing
my business, I felt something drop on my right shoulder.&nbsp; I thought
right away that It was a spider or some kinda bug, and I quickly tried
to brushed it off my shoulder, but as I was doing that it suddenly turned
to a burning pain.&nbsp; I jumped off the toilet in a panic, thinking that
the house had to be on fire, and now so was I!&nbsp; I started to look
at my shoulder and the roof to see what it was that was burning me&nbsp;
but there was nothing.&nbsp; Then it just stopped.&nbsp; I had no marks,
but the pain felt very real.&nbsp; I didn't look into the history of my
house, but I know that there is definitely something there.&nbsp; For some
reason it made itself very known to me but not my sister or brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A couple of years ago, me and my sister inherited the house, and we both
decided to sell it.&nbsp; The&nbsp; new owner of the house, is a friend
of the family, and he said to me,&nbsp; after he lived in it for a while,
that&nbsp; there was some spirits here, but he wouldn't go into details....</B><B></B>

<P><B>Over my Shoulder</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: injaxiam@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, it seems that everyone has a story to tell.&nbsp; Whether scary
or good they all have one.&nbsp; I have one too, good or bad, I'm just
not too sure, I have that uneasy, uncertain feeling about it.&nbsp; You
see, I'm not one of those who have had these experiencing all their lives.&nbsp;
In fact I can't even remember most of my youth and am not certain why.&nbsp;
I was about 9 at the time and I had family visiting over for the holiday.&nbsp;
It was great, people I hadn't seen for years so I was excited.&nbsp; Can't
remember what I did that day, like I said, alot of my early past is a mystery,
but I do remember that night pretty well.&nbsp; I was feeling sick and
couldn't sleep at all, it was a sick feeling in my stomach and I had a
throbbing headache.&nbsp; I was set on the couch just watching the blank
TV because I didn't dare to turn it on and wake everyone up so I just sat
there.&nbsp; I'm not sure what time it was really because we didn't have
a clock in the room, but I guess it was around midnight because everyone
had gone to sleep.&nbsp; I was just sitting there, unable to sleep, when
I got an eerie feeling.&nbsp; I just froze there, I don't remember moving
or anything, and from the&nbsp; llway I saw a figure that was bright white
come into the room.&nbsp; It had seemed to have been shrouded in a cloak
or robe and had its hood up.&nbsp; It was walking across me when it just
stopped directly in the center of my sight.&nbsp; Thats when it pulled
its hood back, (I wasn't sure if I was scared or now.&nbsp; I didn't scream
or anything, like I said, I just had an unsettling feeling inside.) ..........I
have to dig hard for this image, its such a blur now.&nbsp; I vaguely remember
there not being a face where it should have been, but in place of the face
there was a skull shape instead with what I believe was dark long scraggly
hair hanging from it.&nbsp; I'm still not too sure what went through my
mind, but I broke into a cold sweat.&nbsp; I remember everything going
black, then my aunt came sleepily out of her room to go to the bathroom,
on her way back she saw me.&nbsp; She thought I was sweating and holding
my stomach so she sat there with me till I fell asleep, thinking I was
just feeling ill.</B>
<BR><B>I myself even believed that to be my imagination, I was always advanced
with my years so I didn't have much of an imagination.&nbsp; Then a couple
days later I was staying the night over a friends house.&nbsp; He seemed
a little unsettled all night so we just played video games.&nbsp; Just
before we went to sleep he asked me who was up so late over my house.&nbsp;
I asked him what he meant.&nbsp; He then told me that a couple days earlier
he saw someone in white standing in my front yard, walking slowly to the
front door.&nbsp; Even as I write this I get a cold chill all over, I get
a feeling as if someone is reading over my shoulder...........Well, that
passed.&nbsp; I still feel as if I have someone looking out for me, not
sure if they're still with me because its been a while since anything had
really happened, but I do remember that about 5 years back I was running
down the stairs of our house to watch my Sunday night lineup on the living
room TV when I felt my footing slip at the top step.&amp; sp; I was terrified,
it was a feeling of dread.&nbsp; I somehow had missed every step and ran
softly into the front door, I often seen a shape standing there at the
top of the steps whenever I watched TV after that.&nbsp; Well, thats all
of the experiences I've had as of yet...............that I can remember
anyway.&nbsp; I hope I didn't bore any of you and would love to hear of
some responses.</B>

<P><B>Northcote</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mcsarellis@bigpond.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>As a child, I lived in a run down Edwardian in the heart of Northcote.
I remember very clearly when I was the age of 3, I stood out the front
porch on a blistering hot Melbourne night in December &amp; I just knew
that all our spirits were recycled, that is, we are re-incarnated (though
I didn't know the word).</B>
<BR><B>When I was aged 7, I was getting ready to attend Greek school when
I had an out of body experience. I hovered over the top of my bed and I
could see myself (body) down below. Up near me were 2 women dressed in
black (I thought they were witches) and they were see-sawing over the top
of my wardrobe (a very old piece of furniture, purchased 2nd hand by my
father, it now graces the entrance of my house). I became very ill, it
took me nearly 2 weeks to recover. When I was 16 I went to visit relatives
in Greece. After landing in Athens, my mother and I made our way to my
Aunt's apartment. I told my mother the lay-out of the rooms before we entered.
Once inside the apartment I told my Aunt that I knew the layout of each
room. She sat stunned when I was able to pick out each room (all the doors
were closed) and her mouth fell open when I made my way into the room she
had set aside for us! Today at the age of 34 I wonder about these&nbsp;
experiences but am very grateful to believe in a power greater than all
- God.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>well we bought the house about 4 years ago......we bought it from
hud for really cheap. we just figured it's cause it was a fixer upper.well
a couple of months into living there we started noticing things. one night
i was the only one awake and was watching tv and there was a loud bang
like a gunshot.well i jumped up and woke my parents we went although the
house saw nothing we went out side still nothing...wellto back up a lil
bit when we were remodeling the house (it had shag carpeting can you blame
us) there were really dark reddish stains in the carpet padding and even
the wood underneath. we really didn't pay much attention to it at first.
but then as we were talking to the nieghbors they started asking us if
we had any problems with the hiouse when we asked they let us in on the
history. apparently the fisrt family that lived here the woman was named
karen was killed by her brother and buried under the closet in the master
bedroom the same closet once a year has a putrid smell coming from it that
lasts about a months long. her brother was found in gatlinburg dressed
like a woman and using his sisters credit cards. the second family that
lived here the womans husband was quite the ladies man and would cheat
on her often one day she got fed up with it and shot herself in the head
right infront of her 4 y/o son who ran outside screaming when that particular
neighbor who was telling us the story came to see what was happening the
kid was drenched in blood. well her name is also karen. the reason i mentioned
the name is because 1 we know their names cause we still recieve mail for
them and 2 my mothers name is also karen. the expierences i've had in the
house are kinda weird i'm not sure if the ghosts are mean or just kind
of playful but i've seen 2 apparitions of 2 different women the first time
i was walking out of the kitchen and noticed a woman looking through the
sliding glass door at me so i went to open the door and when i started
walking torwards her she walked off. when i went outside i didn'</B>
<BR><B>t see her so i started walking around we had lumber piled up from
the remodeling that had been there and not moved in 2 years and it tumbled
on top of me. the second time i saw something i was walking out of the
kitchen yet again and i saw a woman standing there and she kinda smiled
at me then went to turn around when i started to walk towards her all the
lights went out. the only other stuff that happens is we hear doors open
and shut stuff falls everyonce in awhile nothing else major has happened
though. i'd like to get a reply on what you think about my situation. and
i would also like to have it maybe posted on your webpage</B>

<P><B>Knock, Knock!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: STEFm444@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi, My name is Stefanie and I'm 17 living in southwest TX.</B>
<BR><B>When I was about 13 yrs of age my twin sister (Melanie) and I were
up late in her bed room watching some movies "no, not horror films" We
were up watching these movies around 12:00 or 1:00 am and we heard a thumping
noise on her wall. We turned the TV's sound to mute and listened. Her bed
is by a big window and the headboard was against the wall. We herd the
thump again and this time is sounded more like someone was knocking. The
funny thing about this was that there is nothing that could have knocked
on the wall because on the other side of that wall is outside and there
are no trees or twigs of any sort that could have hit the house and also
our house is brick and her bedroom is on the second floor (two story house).</B>
<BR><B>Well, we heard this noise again and decided to be curious and knock
back.</B>
<BR><B>Every time we knocked the wall would knock after us. We tried to
trick it with various patterns and it would copy them. We then got really
creeped out and decided to get my parents. My dad came in the room and
we knocked on the wall and nothing happened. He stayed in there for about
3 min and then left. the knocking started again and we then ran to get
my dad for the second time and then, like before it didn't knock while
he was in the room. Well, after about 5 min. passed he left and it started
again. Melanie and I were determined to figure this out. So, we knocked
back and it repeated softly then we knocked again and it got louder the
third time we knocked soft and it started banging on the wall as if it
was trying to get through it to attack us or as if it just went crazy!
we were so scarred and we both decided to stay in my room for the night
and haven't heard it ever sense. But we have had some pretty freaky things
happen such as waking up and not being able to move or speak as if forces
were holding us down and we hear sounds like beasts are growling or breathing
hard. that hasn't happened for about 2 years now and I hope it never happens
again. If anyone else has had this experience or anything similar to it
please email me</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hard Fact</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dkmccormick@cox.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello there,&nbsp; I'll first start off by saying that I am an open
minded individual and have never doubted the existence of ghosts and other
spirits.&nbsp; However, in the past few years a belief that was just blind
faith I suppose has turned into hard fact for me.&nbsp; I am 22 years old
now and was 18 when I started getting my proof.&nbsp; I had moved from
my home in Carbondale, Kansas, a small town about 15 minutes away from
Topeka, to my then fianc&eacute;e's house in Baton Rouge Louisiana.&nbsp;
It was December 31st 1999 we had left Kansas on my mom's birthday so that
I could start a new period of my life, in a new state, on the new year.&nbsp;
Kind of a sentimental thing but that's me.&nbsp; Anyway everything was
normal for the first couple of months and filled with me getting settled
in and learning how to find my way around a city that was 2 or 3 times
larger then the one I grew up in.&nbsp; Then weird things started happening
with my new step-daughter's toys.&nbsp; They would turn themselves on and
off,&nbsp; sometimes even when the switch was shut off they would come
on.&nbsp; In our bedroom there was always a chill in the air and I never
felt at ease in the hallway connecting our bedroom to the bathroom and
my step daughter's bedroom and often would refuse to walk down it with
the lights off.&nbsp; I was sure that there was a spirit in the house but
couldn't tell if it meant harm or was nice but I did know who it was.&nbsp;
You see my wife had been married once before and had kicked her husband
out shortly after we met, he wasn't happy about this and eventually ended
up killing himself in our bedroom just a month or so before I moved in.&nbsp;
Well we learned to live with the toys going off and on and even told my
stepson that he was just imagining things when he would see shadows and
hear things at night.&nbsp; Sometimes he'd even smell his dad's scent.&nbsp;
Life went on as normal and then in 2001 my father passed away.&nbsp; The
day he died my family was gathered around him at home and holding his hands
and talking to him,&nbsp; he had been in a coma for about 2 weeks and was
having seizures,&nbsp; the hospice nurse told us that the seizures were
due to his brain dying but when they started getting really bad before
he died he would open his eyes and try to speak.&nbsp; Finally during his
last seizure he opened his eyes looked around and told all of us that he
loved us then the seizure stopped and he lay still but he was still breathing.&nbsp;
Now during this period my stepdaughter had been very quiet which is highly
unusual for her and on occasion would ask to lay in bed with my father
and we'd let her and a couple times I swear that he smiled when she was
in bed with him.&nbsp; Anyway after his last seizure I went into the bathroom
because I had, had about all I could take and I looked up towards the ceiling
and told the lord and lady (I'm a Wicca so basically I was telling god)
to either take him now or to heal him.&nbsp; Right after saying that my
wife came into the bathroom and told me that my father's heart had stopped
and he had died.&nbsp; After that my daughter started perking up and became
her usual noisy self.&nbsp; My dog was also acting funny and when he died
she went and laid in front of the front door but didn't want to go outside
when we opened it for her.&nbsp; At the funeral I delivered his eulogy
(excuse the spelling) and then my family and I stayed for a few days and
went back home.&nbsp; We decided that we'd move back to Kansas to be with
my mom and got our house ready to sell then moved in with my mom.&nbsp;
My daughter would frequently speak to my dad and sometimes I would feel
his presence around me.&nbsp; Anyway to make a long story short we lived
with my mother for a few months and then moved into the house we're in
now.&nbsp; Shortly after moving in my daughter started complaining about
things coming down from the ceiling and hitting her, and also told us about
a little boy that she would play with who had died at some bridge presumably
near here.&nbsp; Well I found a psychic and she confirmed that our house
had numerous entities in it one had come to the house with us (my father)
and the others most of the entities were friendly but there were some that
we needed to tell to get out.&nbsp; So anyway we performed a banishing
ritual and have had no problems with anything hurting my daughter though
my father is still around and he likes to tickle her and just generally
harass her that's the kind of guy my father was and he's just having fun
with her,&nbsp; I haven't researched the history of the house we are in
much but I do know that it was built as part of a base housing unit for
an airforce base that is close to here but was closed down.&nbsp; Sometimes
we hear doors slamming, see things out of the corner of our eyes,&nbsp;
there are white lights that can sometimes be seeing flying around in my
wife and I's bedroom and the hallway is still home to something that doesn't
seem to want to bother us and doesn't us to bother it.&nbsp; It's just
something that we can feel.&nbsp; Once a year we do another cleansing and
put up more barriers around the house and have no problem letting the friendly
entities that also call our house home stay here the way I look at it is
that they were here first so I have no right to tell them to leave unless
they try to harm me or my family.&nbsp; Anyway these are the experiences
that we have learned to live and have also made me a firm believer in ghosts
and other spirits, while at first it would make me uneasy and sometimes
still does for the most part I have learned to live with them and sometimes
even enjoying hearing stories from my daughter/stepdaughter about my dad
meeting her on the school bus and most of all when things are real stressful
in my life I enjoying smelling my dad's deodorant letting me know that
he is with me and helping me along.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Old House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: michaelkennedy@sasktel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>well this all start when my mother and i moved into a new home well
not new but new to us.anyway it wasn't that old about 30 years old (this
was back in 1987). we moved in with not problem but i started to notice
things about this house.Things would go missing only to be found days or
months later in the same spot, i'd see darts of movment out of the corner
of my eye and when i was alone it felt like i wasn't. I spent alot of time
alone in the house which was fine until dark them the house would not feel
so warm and inviting as it was in the day but nothing ever came of it .Until
many years later when the foot steps started in the kitchen they would
come to livingroom carpet and stop.As the time wore on the came closer
to and closer until one night i was lying awake in bed like most children
do. They began to walk up my stairs to my room and i know it wasn't my
mom i could hear her snoing down stairs. Know don't say it was the house
settling becuse my stair made a very distinct squeek when some walk up
them.Anyway once they reach the top of the stair i peek, being curious
and all, to see a shadow standing at the door to my room.I froze and a
few seconds later it turned around and began it decent down the stairs.
This happend once in a while but only during stressful times in the house.The
shadow it self look like and average male with nothing really standing
out but when 'he' look at me it was a mixture of complete terror and a
strange comfort like he wasn't there to hurt or scare me.Like i said i
see him once in a while checking on me but eventally he became a part of
my life.The one that did scare me lived in the basement again it was a
man as far as i could tell .he was he was very angry and his feeling see
to fill the basment air.You could actually feel it as you walked into the
basement that was just the beginning of 'him'.Mostly he would just sit
in a corner and glare at you as you did whatever you had to do and he always
kept as far away from you as possible.Its weird becuse you would see him
move as you move which was at the time very scary.Even though i was a brave
child i rarly finished my choir&nbsp; there even in the day time.Evently
my mom refused to go down there anymore after she was tripped by something
fell and broke a couple of toes.As time went on the basement became less
and less used to the point were if you could not do it in the day time
it didn't get done even laundry.But after a while we forgot about the 'guest'down
stairs until one night when we heard a loud wooooosh we look a each other
in terror as we knew something was wrong in the basement and we would have
to see what it was.So we braved the basement to see a waterpipe had broken
which in it self wasn't weird but it was the fact that alot cherised family
photos and items that had previously on a shelf across the basement where
under this pipe that broke.My grandfather soon came over to help fix the
pipe and the clean up the six inches of water we currently had in the basement.Everything
was ruined the drywall,the shelves not mention all the pricless family
photos etc.when we finally cleaned out everything the last thing to go
was the afore mentioned shelf behind which we found draw in chalk a pentagram
and various other strange drawings and large wooden ouija board.Which again
was strange because my mom had never owned one in here life and i was to
young to even think about that stuff.Anyway fast forward 12 years to 2002.My
mom had met a great guy and had moved to another town to be with him and
i was moving out too so i could live on my own.I was just staying in the
house until my appartment was ready which was 2 weeks away and cleaning
the house for the next owners.Are other housemate had stopped making his
presents known many years ago&nbsp; except for the glaring he did in the
basment and he was the furthest thing from my mind and i was down to the
last 3 boxes of stuff in the basement .In the basement there was four lights
every time i came back for a box 1 light was burnt out as i went to get
the last box and i see i'm down to one last light and i know whats coming,but
i need that box! So i grabbed the box and stand up and look in horror to
see 'him' standing in the darkness in his favorite spot.Two things i noticed
this time he was huge standing around 6'4'' and some thing i never notice
before he had red eyes and it seemed like he had a nasty smile on his face
but i wasn't sure.I stared at him for what seemed like an eternity but
he did the strangest thing ever he waved to me but i didn't stick around
to say my goodbyes and somehow managed the strength to run yelling some
very colorful language as i stumbled out the door.I jumped in my car and
sped off and i look in the rear view mirror to see him standing in the
kitchen glaring out the window at me well needles to say i never went back.</B>
<BR><B>An interesting side note the previous owners had been avid ouija
board player and said that they knew of the entity i had spoke of he only
identified&nbsp; himself as "J" and never nwered questions about who he
was and what happend to him.They said he was fun to talk to until he moved
in.(thanks for telling us now!!!!!)</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: teacherolf@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>this happened about 4 years ago when i was 15. i was working at a
farm in connecticut at the time and it was habit for myself and my coworkers
to have night time b-b-q`s throughout teh summer. on this particular occasion,
we had killed 3 of the chickens we had and grilled them(nothing better
than fresh chicken) as the night was winding down&nbsp; and we were getting
ready to clean up, i noticed a very potent sweet smell. to note, we were
next to a sugar shack where maple syrup is made and this smell was much
stronger than the strongest syrup ive ever smelled. as i smelled it i noticed
my friend glance at me with a perplexed look on his face and suddenly a
very thick fog drifted in. he got up quickly an declared&nbsp; "we`re leaving
now". we of course left leaving everything to be cleaned up the next day.
we went to teh farm office and the fog was still there along with the smell.
it seemed to have followed us. i was a bit spooked an i knew my friend
was experiencing what i was but the woman with us had no idea why we started
acting strange and was a bit confused at the sudden rush to leave. as we
were leaving, it seemed as if teh fog ws thickening however when we reached
the chain link fence that is the border of the farm the fog stopped abruptly.&nbsp;
i looked out and saw that the fog followed the length of the fence which
was about 50 yards. we left an proceeded to the womans house and my friend
told her to walk in her house backwards(my friend comes from guyana in
south america and is very superstitious, his grandfather had been a voodoo
doctor of some sort, i heard numerous stories of him healing crazed peopel
who talked in odd languages) anyways apparently she did not walk in her
house backwards as we found out the next morning, however when he told
me to when he dropped me home i did so with no argument knowing that sometimes
you just dont ask why people tell you to do things. my friend picked me
up for work the next morning and i asked him why he had me walk in backwards.
he mentioned the smell an the fog and said if it was a supernatural presence
it would not follow you into your house if you faced it because it would
think you knew it wa sthere.&nbsp; we got to work and the girl was there
before us and she looked very disheveled and tired. she immediatly said
she barely slept because things in her house kept falling and waking her
up all night, she even said her door opened twice that night. she then
said how it was odd how she had smelled something sweet and seen the fog
and then strange things happened to her. my friend and i had not said anything
to her about the smell or the fog the previous night or yet that morning
so we both looked at each other in amazement, she noticed and told us to
tell her what happened to us but instead of telling her that we had the
same experience, my friend just asked her if she had walked in her house
backwards, she said no.&nbsp; we could only guess why the strange happening
went on in only her house an not ours.&nbsp;&nbsp; i have other stories
that happened to me&nbsp; feel free to e-mail&nbsp; teacherolf@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Ghost in our APartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SingingSheri2@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Sheri Lenz and I live in Loves Park, Illinois.&nbsp; Loves
Park is located right outside of Rockford.&nbsp; Well, about four months
ago I moved into an apartment with my boyfriend which is located off of
Perryville Rd.&nbsp; There are three of us who live here, Bill (my boyfriend),
Adrian (his son), and myself.&nbsp; All of us have had some odd encounters
with some kind of presence.&nbsp; Adrian is 15 years old and has called
us hysterical by things he has witnessed while he was home by himself.</B>
<BR><B>Adrian's experience:&nbsp; One day while home alone in the apartment,
Adrian was on the computer. He said that Bill and my bedroom door opened
and closed by itself. All windows and doors were closed at the time, so
there was not a draft moving through the rooms. About a week later, he
was home alone again there was a knock on the door, Adrian went to the
door and no one was there. He has also has seen gray blurs run from the
bedrooms to the laundry room. Noises have also come from the kitchen while
he was by himself.</B>
<BR><B>Bill and Adrian:&nbsp; In August of 2003, we had family over. While
sitting there Adrian and Bill were staring off toward the bedroom. All
of a sudden they both looked at each other and said,"Did you see that?".
They claimed they saw what looked like an old man or woman hunched over
running and looking towards them into the laundry room.</B>
<BR><B>My experiences:&nbsp; My experiences pretty much consisted of only
hearing noises like things in the kitchen opening and closing on there
own and blinds rustling with nobody around.&nbsp; That was until two nights
ago.........Two nights ago, my mom and younger brother came over to visit.&nbsp;
We played UNO and watched some TV.&nbsp; They left at around 12:30 a.m.&nbsp;
After they left, I got on-line and Adrian and Bill went outside and took
the go-kart and mini-bike for a ride over to Rock Cut State Park.&nbsp;
I was just sitting at the computer, looking at items on Ebay, when I started
to feel like I was being watched.&nbsp; I looked around and didn't see
anything, but I was uncomfortable so I went and got my cell phone out of
my purse.&nbsp; I walked back over to the computer and set the phone next
to me.&nbsp; I continued my search on Ebay, when I saw something out of
the corner of my eye.&nbsp; I immediately looked over towards the hallway,
and standing between the bedrooms and the laundry room I saw a grey-ish
figure of a man.&nbsp; A shiver of ultimate fear shot down the back of
my neck.&nbsp; I have never been that frightened in my entire life. He
stood there for about two seconds and then disappeared into the laundry
room.&nbsp; I grabbed my phone and bolted out the front door.&nbsp; I tryed
to call Bill on his phone but he didn't answer.&nbsp; I remained on the
front porch until he called me and said he was on his way home.&nbsp; When
they got home, I told him what happened and they said "Now do you believe
us?".</B>
<BR><B>I always believed, in a way, but now that I saw that I know that
it's real and it frightens me.&nbsp; The ghost however has not harmed us
in anyway.&nbsp; He is just sharing our residence.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Couple of Stories for you</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: craz_ygirl21@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure where exactly to start.&nbsp; All
of my life I've had feelings and happenings around me, some I remember
and some are still a bit hazy to me.&nbsp; I have a couple of true stories
that have happened to me that I would like to share with everyone.&nbsp;
I grew up in a small city in California called Pico Rivera, but moved in
92 to Colorado.&nbsp; Growing up in Cali I had my three sisters and my
mom and dad.&nbsp; The house we lived at was on Maris ave and from what
I was told it was originally the first church in Pico Rivera, but was torn
down to make a home for an elderly couple who, I believe the husband died
of old age.&nbsp; There house was then torn down and ours was built.&nbsp;
I was 8 I believe when I really started to understand what I was experiencing.&nbsp;
I remember that I would always see horrid faces on the wood paneling in
the house, by that I mean on the doors, and the kitchen cupboards.&nbsp;
I remember that only my older sister and I would be the ones who experienced
all of the happenings.&nbsp; Her and I would have recurring nightmares.&nbsp;
I would dream of trying to run away from what I believed to be the "devil"
chasing me, but the more I ran the closer he would get.&nbsp; My sister
would dream of a young girl in a checkered red and white dress trying to
kill her.&nbsp; Every night I would hear the same things, stomping on our
roof, or a stampede of running feet right above my head, and just as fast
as it would start, it would disappear.&nbsp; One day I was alone in the
house, my parents and sister had gone to the store, and my two other older
sisters where at work.&nbsp; I was peacefully watching TV and playing with
our cat midnight, when a feeling of being watched came over me.&nbsp; Thinking
absolutely nothing of it, I went on watching TV but noticed that idnight
had ran off somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; I though it odd that she had just ran
off, but I still didn't care, I just kept on watching my cartoons.&nbsp;
My mom has a habit of putting this plastic rug thing on our carpets to
keep the dirt off, and we had one, so if someone is walking on it you can
hear them.&nbsp; So what I started to hear was what I thought the cat running
back and forth, so I yelled out her name to get her kitty butt over to
me and stop making all that noise, when I heard her meow from behind the
sofa.&nbsp; I found this strange wondering how she did that so fast so
I went behind the sofa to take a look, sure enough she was huddled in the
corner hissing and meowing with her eyes wide open.&nbsp; I of course tried
to get her out, but she wouldn't let me get near her.&nbsp; I left her
alone and figured that she would come out when she's good and ready and
went back to my TV.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden I heard the noise in the
hall again, I put my TV on mute thinking that maybe it was the cartoon
I was watching and the noise stopped for a second, but then went right
back at it.&nbsp; I started to listen really carefully and what it sounded
like was foot steps, heavy footsteps.&nbsp; With this, I decided to do
the same my cat was doing so I hid in the little tiny opening that was
behind our sofa, and I listened very carefully.&nbsp; Then I noticed that
whatever it was making that noise, stopped, as if it new that I was aware
it was there.&nbsp; I could feel my heart beat in my throat and then it
started up again, but this time it was faster, and then the doors and windows
were opening and slamming shut.&nbsp; I really didn't know what to do,
I just remember that I was concentrating on how close the passes were,
and they were coming closer to me with every beat of my heart, until I
couldn't hear it on the plastic anymore, my cat took off from behind the
sofa so I took it as a sign and did the same thing and ran out my front
door screaming thinking that whatever it was would grab me from b ind.&nbsp;
I made it safely outside my house, and I sat on the sidewalk waiting for
someone to come home.&nbsp; I felt something burning a hole in the back
of my neck and when I turned back to my house the front door slammed shut!&nbsp;
Finally my parents came home and I was so happy to see them, my mom scolded
me for being outside alone, and so I proceeded to tell them what had happened.&nbsp;
My dad said that it was probably an aftershock or a small earthquake, but
none of the neighbors experienced anything.&nbsp; My mom on the other hand
said that I was being punished for being a naughty kid.&nbsp; A few days
later my older sister had came home from work to an empty house, and she
experienced the same thing.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our home out here in Colorado has a strange "feeling"
to it.&nbsp; I can't describe it, it's just something that's always been
there.&nbsp; I remember one night it was myself, our neighbor and my twin
sister were home alone, our parents' had gone up to the hill for some gambling,
so we decided to watch movies, and just be the normal teenage girls.&nbsp;
Well my sister had gone in the shower and my neighbor and I were just sitting
around gossiping, waiting for my sister to get out so we could watch a
movie when the phone rang.&nbsp; Of course I ran to pick it up and I said
hello, but the other side was dead.&nbsp; So I put it back down and went
back to our business, when it rang again.&nbsp; I got up, ran to the phone,
again no one on the other end.&nbsp; I hate prank calls, and two is enough
for me to get agitated with, so I unplugged all the phones in the house
and left it at that.&nbsp; About five minutes later there was a knock at
our door, now I wasn't a stupid girl, I looked out the peep hole and there
was no one there, so I looked out my window and there wasn't even any feet
print in the snow coming up to our door.&nbsp; Well we both found this
to be strange, and feeling a bite uncomfortable, we went around the house
making sure everything was locked and overed all our windows.&nbsp; We
stood looking out the front window making sure it wasn't one of our neighbors
trying to play games when my sister came out of the shower and had a confused
look on her face.&nbsp; We asked her what was wrong and she asked us if
we had gone into the bathroom during the time she was in the shower, I
told her no, there is no way for us to even get in if we wanted to because
there is no key for that lock.&nbsp; Again we asked her what was wrong
and she proceeded to tell us that before she got in the water, she took
off her rings and had placed them on top of the toilet seat cover so that
they wouldn't fall into the sink, but when she had gone out, they were
on top of the toilet and the seat cover was up as if someone had removed
them to use the restroom.&nbsp; At that same time both the phone rang and
there was another knock at the door.&nbsp; We looked out the peep hole
while my sister ran to get the phone, again there were no foot prints in
the fresh snow, and no one at the door.&nbsp; My sister came running and
said that it was for me, so I started walking to the phone when I remembered
that I had unplugged all the phones, so I told my sister to hang it up
she said that it sounded important, but I told her to hang it up, finally
she did.&nbsp; My neighbor and I both turned white and my sister asked
what was going on when I told her I had unplugged them so there is no way
they could've rang, let alone anyone talk on the other end.&nbsp; We still
talk about it to this day, and even in my own apartment, I wake up to hear
my toilet flush on it's own, or things vanish and I find them in my cupboards.&nbsp;
Crazy, crazy!</B>
