<p class="MsoNormal">My First Encounter</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Pookeybug2235@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">First off I want to say I love your site, and secondly I
have been a fan of this site for awhile but this is my first time posting.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am a true believer of ghosts, spirits and entities. I
myself have never really had an experience until Memorial day of this year. My
sister and I were going to get some friends from there house on Saturday night
to go out to a club in <st1:City><st1:place>Athens</st1:place></st1:City> by <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Univ.</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>GA.</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> Well they told us their
house was haunted before we left to go and get them but I thought nothing of it
until we were on the road and headed that way when I got this terrifing feeling
in the pit of my stomach. I told my sister I did not want to go but we had no
choice plans were made and I did not want to let them down. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Their house is a double wide mobile home and it was in some
little town going toward S.C., not sure of the name. Well anyway all the roads
to the house are very dark and creepy and that did not help my feeling at all,
but I was all excited to go out and have fun so I tried to look on the brighter
side...until I got to their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first thing that creeped me out was that they were two house away from a old
church and a cemetary (not something I wanted to see). When we get out of the
car my hair on my neck stood straight up. I heard what was chains rattling next
to me right away so we ran inside, while sitting their I kept getting this
feeling I was being watched and that was when they told me the seen the
aspirition of a man go from the master bedroom to the hall and he stopped and
looked straight at them and then walked into the hall way bathroom. I really
had to go to the bathroom when we got there and put all feelings aside I went
into that bathroom and did my business, when out of the corner of my eye I saw
him standign there, that was when I said time to go, I ran out of that house so
fast I made there heads spin. We go out and have a good time and then it was
time to go back to drop them off (now this is where it gets spooky) the oldest
girl told me the land lord knew nothing about the ghost and said it was
nonsence but he was being very shady the whole time, and she said it gave her
an eeirie feeling. They had lived there a few weeks and did the whole change of
address at the post office and everything but they have not received one piece
of mail lthe whole time it is like the place doesn't even exist (creepy huh?),
I know this is long but this is the last thing I promise. On the way back they
said if you look at the church you can see the same man standing in the
doorway, and sure enough thought I tried not to look because I was terrified to
the point of tears I was compelled to do so he was standing right there, in
this eirie glow. Thank you for reading my story I will post on my grandmothers
house next time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Family's Unsettling History With The Paranormal.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: hart2art@pacbell.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To begin with, I live in <st1:place><st1:City>Los Angeles</st1:City>
 <st1:State>California</st1:State></st1:place>, in the Valley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My house is a very unsettling place, ever
since I can remember, there have been unusual goings ons and oddities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The history of the house is this; the house
was built in the late fifties in the Hollywood Hills somewhere or other I am
not quite sure, but it was eventually moved for some reason to the Valley in
the early sixties at which point my grandfather bought the house at an
amazingly reasonable price for such a then luxurious and beautiful house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my family moved in and they have lived there
since.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now begins the second part of my
story, when my grandfather was nearing the end of his life, he began to see
things, namely my grandmother(whom he had divorced decades earlier and who had
died about three years earlier)and, a small girl who he would become agitated
at the sight of and wave away saying things like "Get away, you're
gone!" and the like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very
unsettling, as I said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He however was
not alone in his unusual experiences in the house as my aunt and father have
also experienced oddity here as well as any and nearly all of my friends who
have stayed the night and most significantly, me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt has heard voices here when she was
younger, and has seen a man out of the corner of her eye standing at the corner
of her bed watching her who has also she says caused her to have difficulty in
breathing on occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father is
another story all together, but I am unsure as to his reliability as he is
quite frankly, bi-polar/szkizophrenic but, several years ago after my
grandmother died in 1994 he went quite insane and said that a "thing"
in his room told him to kill himself. . .I would otherwise discount this as
part of his psychosis or mania, but after that happened, I came into possesion
of the house as part of my inheritance from my grandfather and when I first
moved in, as there was hardly any furniture and I was staying there, I had to
stay in his old room at the end of the hallway at the back of the house(there
are no windows and the only illumination is from a wall torchier precisely in
the middle of the hall which will play in later oddities).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I lay down in there with my dog to rest
a bit on the mattress which had previously been his, I felt decidedly
unpleasant as if I were being watched but was suddenly so tired that I
immediately fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up some
time later in a cold sweat and my dog was huddled in the corner whimpering and
watching the ceiling in the diagonally opposite corner of the room and seemed
very frightened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unpleasant feeling
of being watched had greatly increased and I quite the room as hastily as I
possibly could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I had first moved
in also, about a week after the oddness with my dog, and before I could move
over my bed from my previous residence, I had moved over my father's bed from
his old corner room and begun to sleep upon it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Things were fine for about a month or so until one night I awoke to see
the silhouette of a tallish man standing in the doorway to my bathroom(there is
a bathroom attached to my bedroom and a door leading out from the bathroom into
the entrance hall by the front-door)the man was standing with arms slightly
bowed and head lowered with shoulders tense and seemed angry for some reason,
Very angry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man pointed at me and I
blinked and he disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
even more disturbing about it was that the man appeared to be composed entirely
of shadow as if the brightest light possible were shining behind him while the
lighting behind him was just as it always is, as at that time I usually left
the entrance hall light on for anyone coming home late and, the light in my
bathroom was on which was directly flush with the man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even more disturbing was that while after I
blinked, the man was gone and when I looked to investigate, the door was once
more closed, but the door was un-locked which it Never was and, the light in
the bathroom was still on which it also Never was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made a thorough search of my room and it
was completely sealed and there was no possible way for what happened to have
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a day or two later, and
this is the weirdest most terrifying part and the most horrific, I was laying
in bed(the one my father had shot himself on after my grandmother died-although
he did not die of it)hands began to form out of the mattress and massage my
body at first I thought it was a dream as it was so absurd but did not feel bad
and was actually soothing, until the hands began to gouge and claw at me and
try to pull me into the bed at which I began to shriek and jumped out and off
of the bed and watched as the hands very sinuously melted almost back into the
mattress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My body hurt very much and I
went to observe myself in the full length mirror which my grandfather had hung
upon the door between my room and my bathroom(which had been his, he was a
short man though so I don't believe the shadow-man had anything to do with
him)and I noticed that my entire body from ankles to just below my neck was
covered in gouges as if I had been scratched all over and many were bleeding
although not profusely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran out of the
room and did not sleep the rest of the evening and in the morning, removed both
bed and frame and put them in the trash and on the curb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this, I began to have nightmares in
which a massive presence chased me through rooms of places in which I had
previously lived or, I would be in a normal-ish dream(I am presuming that they
were normal because I have never had a real dream, only nightmares)and then I
would sense something approaching, even through the walls of the buildings in
the dreams and then it would appear and rush at me and attack by grabbing me by
the neck and throttling me and though it did not speak or even make sound or
have form I could see it is as if it did and it had the form of a large
human-like thing and it would gloat over me and taunt me as if I could hear
it's thoughts it strangled me and lifted my feet off of the ground and
prevented me from calling out or even making sound and I would struggle until I
finally awoke and many of the times I would awaken to find large hand prints
upon my neck, larger even than my hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The worst of the strangulation dreams was one set in my back hallway
just to the side nearer the back of it just on the side of the lamp farther
from the entrance to the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
dream, I was held walking about the house and heard something frying in the
kitchen like eggs and when I went in there were eggs upon the stove and I felt
such an inexplicable horror and revulsion at it that I still cannot quite shake
the image from my mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I went
into the kitchen, I heard my dog whimpering in distress and ran to the sound
and found her in the back hallway and she was being held up by the throat and
throttled as I had been before and I ran over shouting at the shadow thing
which was also the incorporeal thing(which I knew somehow)and threw myself at
it to force it to release my dog and she was thrown back against the corner of
the side hall which leads to the other bathroom off the master bedroom and lay
unconscious at which it began to throttle me until I managed to shout out
"God!" and was dropped and awoke immediately to find my neck severely
sore and with bruising all over it and when I went to check on my dog, she was whimpering
and my mother could not figure out why as she had suddenly begun to whimper in
the middle of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shadow
things hunted me I believe for some time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was standing in the back-yard on evening very soon after and my older
brother who had asked if he could sleep in a tent in the backyard instead of in
the house had pitched a tent there in the back of the yard near a jacaranda
tree which is in the middle rear of the yard the way the tent was set up, one
would have to upon exiting the tent, walk round about a trestle picnic table
and the jacaranda(which lay perpendicular to the house)to come about to the
path to the house which lay about twenty or so feet away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That said, I was waiting out on the other
side of the tent one evening chivying him to hurry up so we could catch a show
when I thought I saw him exit the tent and start to come around(that meaning I
saw "him" push aside the tent flaps with the light in the tent behind
him bright and stride around the table and tree towards me)just as
"he" reached me, my brother exited the tent and said "Alright,
alright already, I'm coming, stop pestering me!" and this happened just as
the shadow thing rounded the tree at which it bolted directly past my face and
straight into the wall of the neighbor's garage which forms part of the
separating wall between our two yards and as the shadow man reached the wall it
ran directly into it at which it appeared to melt and splash almost into the
shadows which blanketed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother
also saw this although far more briefly as he only saw it bolt and
"blur" past his eyes between the tree and the corner of his tent as
his tent obscured the rest of his vision in the evening darkness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I say that the shadow men hunted me because
they followed me to my aunt's house and tried to attack me there as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attack at my aunt's house occurred not
long after the attacks and sightings at my own house and happened when I went
up there to San Louis Obispo County to Los Osos for her father in law's wake at
her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were a great many
family members at the house for the ceremony and I as a younger member of the
family and not directly related as such to the deceased, was given a less than
luxurious accommodation; the floor of my cousin's room with my mother sleeping
upon the bed itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to sleep
feeling in the far corner of the room far away from the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I awoke later in the evening, rather late,
for some reason stretched out straight with only my head pointing towards my
previous position and at an angle with my feet pointed towards the bed even
though I had previously been sleeping with my whole body curled up in the fetal
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up again later in the
evening farther towards the bed with my ankles underneath it which frightened
me even more-so at which I curled even farther into the corner after having
gone across the hall to the restroom to splash my face with cold water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again, later even in the evening, I
awoke to find myself under the bed, but this time I knew what it was as I was
experiencing the same sensation of having something stuffed into my mouth to
prevent my making any sound whatsoever and which barely allowed my even being
able to breath as if a gag had been shoved into my mouth, the same as when I
was attacked by the shadow man and the incorporeal thing which were the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was horribly aware of my being
pulled forcibly under the bed and what was even more aware of the fact(and this
is the Most terrifying and inexplicable of it to me, I am only about 5' 8"
or 5' 8-1/2" or so but the bed which I was being pulled under, was only a
single sized bed and I should only roughly have been able to be pulled under it
while laying perpendicular to it as I was, roughly to just above my knees)I was
up to my CHIN beneath the bed and being pulled farther as I tried to
scream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wall was on the other side
of the bed so that if I had been pulled that far, it would have been INTO the
WALL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally managed to get a yelp
out of my mouth and then the pulling and gagging stopped and my mother looked
down very perplexed as to why I was under the bed and so far at which I told
her what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We left within the
hour.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The oddness of my
house goes back into my youth as well, as I recall when I was younger and only
my grandfather was home with me, we would sit watching the television and
sometimes, I would hear what sounded like squelchy boots coming down the hall
at which I would look, and there would never be anything there and the carpets
were always dry and there were no pets then either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the day I left to go to my
grandfather's funeral, I was the last out the door and closing it behind me
when I heard a tea-pot whistle and I went in to investigate worried about
someone having left on a fire on the stove, but it was not on and the tea-kettles
were all cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandfather always
used to make tea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time, I
remember I was sitting in the living-room when I heard what sounded like a
horrible soul wrenching sorrowful wail almost on the edge of hearing, like a
weeping wail emanate from the fireplace in the corner of my living-room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the most sad sound I have ever heard in
my entire life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like a little
girl pleading, pleading so she didn't even speak, just wailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time, when standing in the entry hall
which looks directly into the kitchen door, my friend and I saw a man approach
the refrigerator from the direction of the hallway which leads to the backdoor
to the house and he was youngish middle-aged with light-brownish hair and
glasses and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a crew cut with a white
shirt and a tie on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He walked up to the
refrigerator and looked in it and then walked back to the backdoor's direction
from which he had come.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend and I
looked at one another and both said "Did you SEE THAT?!" we both
nodded and rushed to the back door and it was still locked with it's slide bolt
which can only be locked from the inside and there is no other way out of the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have since performed an
exorcision upon my house and most of the oddities have ceased although anyone
not sleeping in my bedroom which used to be my aunt's is prone to nightmares
and intense sluggishness no matter what they do and the back of the hallway is
still inexplicably Dark no matter what is done, even when a flash-light is
shined upon the back hallway, the light appears somehow dimmer, even when it is
pitch black outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The back hallway is
also the main element and subject of most of the nightmares which anyone who
sleeps in the living-room suffer from(I Never tell anyone about the dreams
because it usually frightens them off, my friends that is).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So far, five of my friends have had similar
nightmares concerning the back hallway namely the space directly at the back
and there being a doorway there, either black or made of flowing solid blood or
of a doorway with the door a crack open and something horrible beyond which my
friends cannot explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my brother
Kevin's dream(I count him as one of the friends)he dreamed that he saw a
doorway there and that his girlfriend who was sleeping next to him zipped to
the neck in a sleeping-bag attacked him in some daemoniac fury and when he
awoke, she was still zipped up, but his back was bleeding profusely with gouges
all across it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have had nightmares of
a doorway in the back hallway since I can remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a small room or something some sort
of space which is behind that area where the doorway lies in the dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found it one evening with a couple of
friends after they had spent the night and were unsettled and wanted to see
what there was to see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We looked and
there is no roof panel over the heater which is also set in that wall and you
can see over the back paneling and there is a small "space" back
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Couldn't make out anything
though, even with flash-lights, there was too much dust floating about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family in general has had problems of this
sort for years though, at my grandfather's old house there was comparable and
worse and while at another aunt's house, I have awoken to a black swirling
vortex over my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't think of
anything else I'd like to say, but I hope some of you who read this. . .I don't
know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just wanted to tell my
story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you for reading it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lights, camera, death!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Grzchef@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the year of 2004, I happened to be in the play, Aladdin,
whom of which I played Jasmine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
sixteen years old, and the play went well at rehearsals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at the best theater in town, The
Missoula Children's Theater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I remember driving my hot new car to the large building,
and, on the day of the live show, saw an accident on the side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, a large semi truck, had rushed
into a tiny car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car looked
familiar, but I just kept driving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I got to the theater, there was a very long line of people waiting to get
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This made me very excited, and I
couldn't wait to get changed into my costume, and put my stage make-up on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got there, my boyfriend, Jordan, (who
played Aladdin) said he didn't feel to good.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I asked him if he had stage-fright, he said no, it was something of
guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When the show started, everyone was sooo excited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
kissed me goodluck, and I did the same back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We got on-stage, and as the ropes lifted us higher on our "magic
carpet" I started singing, "A Whole New World".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the middle of the song, Aladdin was
supposed to say, "Don't you dare shut your eyes" instead he said,
"don-" he stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His poor
face turned white.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He straightened up,
and as one of the boards behind us fell down, so did he, fifteen feet down, off
of our cloth carpet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will never forget
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Apparently, the car crash I saw earlier that day, was his
mother, and she died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Poor <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
landed on his head, and broke his neck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thank God that he didn't die, but when he heard about his mom, that
was what almost killed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came to the
funeral and prayed for her the rest of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later that year, there was another play at the theater,
Romeo and Juliet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to audition
for Juliet, and with all the experiance from Aladdin, I thought I might have a
shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
if he wanted to, and said he should try out for Romeo, because we'd have
kissing scenes and stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me
no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he saw a white figure
of a man, and he threw a board that fell behind us when he broke his neck the
first time we were at the theater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was sooo embarrased, he wouldn't do it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I later heard of the story, and didn't try out for the part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No ghost will ever hurt my sweetie again. I
am now pregnant, and <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
will be very protective over the child, because of what had happened before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May God watch over all of you reading this,
and be careful of the superstitious...they are there waiting for you.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There is a log cabin in <st1:City><st1:place>newark</st1:place></st1:City>
<st1:State><st1:place>ohio</st1:place></st1:State> and it is said from previous
owners that there are many parinormal activities and images that go on during
all hours of the day and night. One family that owned the cabin between 1989
-1994 had many parinormal activities happen in the few years they owned the
cabin. They heard glass shattering, doors opening and closing, and felt the
presence of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>something strange within and
out arround the house. In one instance a younge mother woke up one night and
found herself to be thirsty. She went into the kitchen to make herself a cup of
tea to help relax her and put her to sleep she was then grabbed by the shoulder
and thrown into an old rocker they had in their living room where she was held
down and forced to stay there the remander of the night. The next morning when
her husband awoke he found her wide awake in the chair and asked her what had
happend. She asked him to check her shoulder where she was grabbed and he then
found nail prints in his wifes skin. Sence then they have moved out of the
cabin and a few couples have moved into the house but moved out leaving all
their belongings inside the house within a month time period. It is said that
if u go to the cabin and sit in the old pourch swing you with feel an presence
of something that doesnt want u there and on some occasions u will see a shadow
or<span style="">&nbsp; </span>outline of a person watching u
through the window.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Childhood Flashback</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: bill_lumberg03@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I want to share an experience i had when i was a child. I
grew up in <st1:City><st1:place>Newcastle</st1:place></st1:City> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
about 2 hours north of <st1:City><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:City>. As a
child i was very scared of anything supernatural, ghosts, monsters,
skeltons...anything !<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When i was 7 years old my bedroom was at the end of a long
hall, on the other end was the top of a staircase then led to the basement of
the house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night i was woken by strong winds outside, my bedrom
door was open. ( i always slept with the door closed). I looked down the end of
the hall and saw my mother dressed in her night gown holding a hurricance gas
lamp...she was walking down the stairs, her robe was white and her hair was up
and sort of a reddish colour. I though that the power had gone out and my
mother was going down stairs to get other lamps for us to use. Our house was
high on a hill and was often damaged by storms....often we would get up and
check the house for damage durning bad weather. As a child, this was quite
exciting, i quickley jumped out of my bed and went into my parents bedroom, to
my surprise, my father was still in bed and i woke him..i asked why my mother
was going to get the lamps? he looked at me like i was on drugs....told me to
go back to sleep....i then asked if he was going to help my mother...he
replied, "what are you talking about, your mother is in bed " i
noticed my mother in bed and was totally confused...i went back to my room, closed
the door and never thought of it again until 7 years later. I do not know why I
did not think of it again until i was 14. I thought back and realised that my
mother did not own a white gown, my mothers gown for purple velvet (it was in
the 70's)....and my mother had short black hair...not long red hair....I told
my mother about this and the woman i described was her mother...who had died
before i was born. It seems like she was checking up on us I guess.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I thought my experience was a unique event but after reading
these stories I realise that it's a common occurrence.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I started seeing a girl whom I worked with and it became a
fairly turbulent relationship. We used to clash a fair bit and argue but our
sex life was absolutely fantastic. She lived in an older house that was
converted into four apartments. The apartment she lived in was on the ground
floor. I have no exact idea of the age of the building but it is in a <st1:City><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:City>
suburb of Kirribilli very close to the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Sydney</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Harbour</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
It is one of <st1:City><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:City>'s oldest
suburbs and was frequented by convicts, English soldiers and working class
people during the early days but now it is one of <st1:City><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:City>'s
most high class suburbs.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, often I would walk into her into her room and it
often felt as though I was walking into someone or some heavy weight. There was
always a heavy energy or weight around the entrance to her room. It used to
freak me out having to get up and go to the bathroom at night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This went on for a few months. Our relationship was getting
worse and we argued more and more. One night we were lying in bed together,
both on our backs. We were not arguing but the conversation was intense and I
was upset with her. We settled down after a few minutes and things were fine.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly, I felt an intense urge to leave, get out of there
or run...I told her that I have to get out of here and go home (I lived over an
hour away). </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She was shocked and did not want me to leave, I then tried
to get up out of the bed but I then felt a very heavy pressure on my chest and
shoulders. My girl was still lying still next to me and not moving. I asked her
if she could feel the weight and she said yes. We were being held down in the
bed....it is a weird feeling like no one is touching you but can feel your body
weight pushing down in the bed. The room was dark but I could feel someone only
an inch from my face....I stared back hard and without fear....I asked
"What is it that you want". Then, I felt heat all over my face and
head, my body became very light and calm, it felt like I was on the ceiling
looking down.....by this time I was freaking out but still could not move my
body. My eyes closed hard and I realised I was being shown something. I could
see two men sitting in a basement around a furnace. They were cold and wet and
appeared to be dock workers...I could not see the face of the one standing up
but the other guy sitting down looked straight at me, he looked really pi**ed
off....not with me but I think he hated his life or time...he did not move his
lips but he did say to me " How dare you judge me, you have no idea what
my time was like and you know nothing of my circumstances, I had to work with
this guy, he is a trouble maker" I then looked down and that man had an
iron fire poker next to him, he had used it to thump some bloke to death...that
person that was killed is the person or spirit that held me down and made me
stay...he was only young when killed, 20 or so...he had difficulty with his
work mates and did not fit in....there seems to have been some collusion or
trouble with his work on the Sydney docks. By the appearance of their clothing,
it seems to be in the 1800's ....cannot specify a decade though. I then told
the murdered man that I did not want to get involved, he was getting
agitated...I felt bad about what I did next, but I had to do it...I cast his
presence out and unwelcomed him...I used prayer and holy strength to disconnect
from him....the weight instantly lifted and the whole thing separated from
me....it became like the room was cut in two...they were still there but I was
now on the living side... I feared that I had not cut them off completely and
called my brother on the phone. (my brother is a devout Christian and has had
experience dealing will the spirit world) , we both together cast the entity
out...it completely went away.......I went back to bed, my girl was not shocked
at all by this event which surprised me......After about half an hour I was
drifting asleep when I dared to check in on that spirit again without engaging
it....he was upset and cowering in a corner...I felt really sad for him but I
just could not get involved any further....the next day, my girl said that that
spirit had been there for a while, she didn't tell me because I might freak
out.. Her ex boyfriend (who was a complete sceptic) was terrorised by the same
spirit until he never went back to her house...they just broke up over it. We
soon broke up, she claims she is happy to live in the house and the spirit does
not harm her....personally, I think the spirit is a jealous bastard who acts
like a controlling child.......but hey, how can I judge someone that could be
200 years old?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My husband usually leaves his wallet on the dining room
table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes he carries it and
sometimes he doesn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day he went
looking for it and couldn't find it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
retraced his steps, he looked at the lost and found at work, we searched the
house, our cars, the couches, our daughter's toy box, etc...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in class one afternoon when I received
a call from him thanking me for finding his wallet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him I didn't find it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband is taking a few classes online
this semester and the wallet was left right next to the laptop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him that I was working on the laptop
before I left and it wasn't there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
wallet was gone for almost 2 weeks before it reappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now if only he'd give us back his cell
phone...<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also, my husband gave me a watch for a wedding present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took it off one day and couldn't find it
for eight months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I searched everywhere,
I finally got up the nerve to tell my husband I had lost it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was upset and I knew he would be upset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was going through some plastic storage
containers that I hadn't opened in years, and my watch was at the bottom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our ghost also likes to leave the faucets running in the
bathroom and kitchen sinks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A friend was
staying in our spare room while his apartment was being readied and someone had
gone through the drawers in his desk and left them open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought it was our 2 year old daughter,
but she was asleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We have videotape of our daughter dancing and there are orbs
surrounding her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all feel like we are
being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our daughter is young but
sometimes I feel like she may be talking to someone who isn't there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house is over a hundred years old, and we
did ask about signs of a haunting when we moved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think some of the occurences might be
happening due to my uncle who died when he was 12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a bit of a prankster and this July is
the 30th anniversary of his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also,
our phone rings once every night between</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:time minute="45" hour="22">10:45-10:47 pm</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We call it our <st1:time minute="45" hour="10">10:45</st1:time>

Berea College Pearson's Hall</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: fawnibecca@comcast.net</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In 1986 I was a sophmore at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Berea</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> in <st1:place><st1:City>Berea</st1:City>
 <st1:State>KY</st1:State></st1:place>, and lived in Pearson's female dormitory
on the first floor. The dorm room was small with a loft reached by a ladder;
underneath we had a love couch and a couple desks. My roommate was a long
haired Pentacostle Holiness church girl named Becky. Becky went to church every
Wednesday<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and Friday night as well as on
Sunday mornings. She had been raised to wear only dresses and skirts, and to
never cut her hair. A Vietnamese born man named Keyholee who was a foreign
student and photographer, went to her church. She would tell me stories of how
he'd stand up to witness in her church;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>about his childhood experiences and about how he was once a devil
worshiper. He would go on and on about how he wanted to be saved by Christ and
such. He had a very obsessive crush on Becky. She sort of was flattered at first,
but he began to follow her around campus with his camara and he'd tell her that
she was going to be his wife. He wouldn't take no for an answer. She began to
avoid him and eventually became frightened. This guy was stalking her big time!
I remember once running in to hi on campus and trying to reason with him. A few
minutes into the conversation I realized that he REALLY was disturbed and
crazy. There was not a rational way to tell him which he would understand; that
Becky didn't want him. She eventually told a school conuncelor, and the campus
security was alerted to this stalking problem. He wasn't allowed around our
dorm. She also avoided church for a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>while until she heard he'd stopped going.. Meanwhile, I began having
strange experiences in the dorm room. I often took an afternoon nap in the loft
and my dreams began to get creepy. I had a recurring dream that I'd discovered
a satanic cult under our dorm's front porch and the group noticed me looking at
them and began to chase me. One day during my nap, I dreamt I was in my own
dorm room and I stood looking at Becky who sat on the love seat. Around my neck
was a huge snake, like a boa, hanging down. I said, "Look Becky, at this
snake here on my neck!" Suddenly the snake broke up into 20 or so different
snakes, hissing and moving; and they all began to slither away from me and
around us in dorm the room. Becky disappeared and I noticed I was alone. Next,
the room began to swell inward around me and became alive with an evil
presence. I countered this by yelling at the room"I LOVE YOU",
thinking that since this was my dream I could change it around to lightness and
god. But the room responded, by swelling closer around me with hate; and
regurgitated my words straight back "I LOOOOVEE YOUUU!!" in both a deep
gutteral and hideous voice which vibrated in several low tones at once. I was
horrified, and ran out of the room, only to be chased once again by that
recurring group of satanic people from other nightmares.. A few days later I
was once again sleeping on my loft in broad daylight between classes. I began a
nigh are again, this time of being surrounded by negative energy shadows who
wanted to harm or steal my soul away from me somehow. Suddenly my loft was full
of stuffed animals all floating around my head. Just floating in the air alive
and looking at me. A lion floated before me smiling, right in front of my face.
He just smiled this horrible hateful ghastly grin, directly at me. I could feel
the daggers of his attention, it was eery! I raised my arm up and knocked this
thing away from me, off the loft toward the floor at the base of the ladder.. I
looked at the floor below and he was still there; his mangled head smiling up
at me, still<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with that evil grin. I jumped
down the ladder hard, knowing my feet would stomp him. I didn't look but<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ran away, out of my dorm room without looking
back!.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened my eyes, wide awake. The
sound of a blood curdling female scream rang loud in my ears, even with my eyes
open and thoughts focused on being awake. I mean, this scream continued LOUD
inside my head as I looked around me wide awake! Never before or since have I
ever experienced this phenomenon. About a week later, my roommate Becky sat
talking to me in the rocking chair. We were just gossiping about poeple, classes
and such, when suddenly she fell to to the floor in a fetal position. She was
in so much pain she couldn't move or talk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I rushed her to the hospital. After a foley catheter was placed,
numerous blood tests, an abdominal series, and examination from head to toe
with an over night stay, they found no reason for her pain. She had screamed
all the way to the hospital and through most of her ER visit. Nothing. We could
find no reason. The summer came and Becky and I split up as roommates. We both
went to different towns durring summer months and returned to school with
seperate roommates in different rmatories. This year is when something really
wild occurred. Keholee didn't know that Becky had moved from Pearson's Hall, so
when<span style="">&nbsp; </span>our school semester started again
he began to stalk our old room again. The new girls who lived there were in for
a big surprise when one day he wandered in to the locked female portion of
Pearson's dorm and entered their room. Luckily, both were in class and the room
was empty. He locked himself in that old room of ours and wouldn't open the
dead bolt for several hours. He began to flip out, cursing and calling out
satanic spells, cursing the room and calling out to Becky and just mumbling
evil spells. Security, police and all sorts of folks were called to the dorm
room. An interpreter came to get him out of there. He was actually taken away
in a straight jacket, expelled and sent back to his country. I have wondered if
all along, that year before, if all of his focused energy on our room, and on
Becky, had caused my nightmares and her sudden unknown pain. We were being
attacked by God knows what all that time. Thank God Becky (or I, or anyone)
were out of that room . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when he
finally came to collect!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My mother and I use to live in this old house. We always
heard dogs howling in the basement and we heard stuff moving around in this
room were this coupl(an old lady and her husband) were murdered in. A few
months after we moved<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in we found out
that the couples dogs were murdered too. We thought that nothing weird would
happen because we havent encountered that much weird stuff yet. My mother went
to work at <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30</st1:time> in the morning every
day. One day she was like am I that loud in the morning that I wake you up? I
did not know what she was talking about she never woke me up. She was
said,''Then why is it every morning you wake up to wave to me goodbye?''. I
said mom I dont know I never wake up in the morning. So the next day when she
got in her car she saw someone waving to her in the window so she pulled up to
the window so she could get a better look at the person. Then she saw and old
man with a long beard wearing overalls with a plad shirt under. She jumped out
of the car and ran as fast as she could(and she can run very fast she was in
track) to the kitchen ans she flew open th door but when she look at the
window...no one was there. She looked in my room and I was sound asleep!! I
have 2 more ierd experiences to tell you. We had this dog named Scooby-Lou. She
was a big dog so she panted alot. One day me and my mother were in my room
talking. Then my mother was said why is Scooby panting so loud? I said I dont
hear anything. So she looked behind her because she thought Scooby was right
behind her but she wasnt. So we look every were in the house but we could still
her panting. We couldnt find Scooby. Then I looked out side. Scooby was out in
the field about a half mile away. One night I was awaken by a weird noise. When
I open ny eyes I saw and old lady with white hair dressed in all white but the
weird this about her was he had fresh blood all over her. She had stab wounds
all over her. She told me not to go in the basement room. We never looked in
there because it was locked. Well the next day I was out side. I always looked
on the ground because you could find deer bones all over the yard. I saw a
skeleton key. So I called my friends Becca, Marijo, and Megan over to my house.
I told them we will have an adventure today. So I tried tht key on the basement
room door and I worked. When I opened the door....there was a horrible smell.
Then I shined my flashlight in the room and all of my friends screamed. There
was blood on all of the walls and there were scratch marks on the door. I can
see that the old lady and man were nice ghosts and the old lady was just
trieing to warn me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: Scared and Running</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in <st1:place><st1:City>Indianapolis</st1:City>, <st1:State>IN</st1:State></st1:place>
for over 9 years. We moved because we couldn't take the hauntings anymore.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The home belonged to Bob and Mary . They were my hubby's
great aunt and uncle. Mary died in the home, and a few months later, Bob died
in the hospital (both of old age). The only thing was, they NEVER actually left
the home.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We bought the home through the estate. The home was in
desperate need of renovating. For the first five years we lived there we did
all of the renovations. Needless to say, all hell broke loose.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the room where Mary died, it was always cold (freezing
cold). Though the room was small, it had two large windows, but never seemed to
let much light in. On the door, in the woodgrain, a face could be visibly seen
of a man screaming. Also, a skeleton's head could be seen at night on the door.
One night, my oldest son (who was 7 at the time) started screaming and running
out of that room. He told me he saw a shadow inside of his room walk past both
of the windows. He thought a burglar broke into his room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The TV and VCR would go off and on by themselves, even when
we unplugged them.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I watched my dish drainer in the kitchen go flying up into
the air and land on the floor, breaking some dishes.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I watched b-day cards that were set on top of an antique
china cabinet fall to the ground. The only strange about this was that only
every other one fell, not all of them.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our dog would constantly bark into the air for no reason.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our cat's hair would stand up and it would start hissing and
growling at nothing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our sons' remote controlled cars would play by themselves.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Things would go flying across the room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day, when Mary's sister died, at the time she died all
of our doors in our house slammed shut. No windows were open at that time, and
our relatives that were visiting witnessed this.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Things would always disappear, then reappear a few days
later.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We ALWAYS heard people call out our names, but no one would
ever be around to have called out to us.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night my youngest son and I heard a little girl crying
outside of the house. It was around <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2:00 am</st1:time>.
We looked out of our windows, but never saw the little girl, even tho we could
still hear her crying "mommy."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day my youngest son was looking out our huge picture
window in the living room when he saw a strange looking man coming around the
kitchen from the glare in the glass. When he turned around, he watched the man
walk past him and towards the hallway, then disappear.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Many of our friends and relatives had witnessed a lot of the
hauntings in this house. At one point, one of my friends went running from the
house and about broke her neck falling over the dog laying on the front porch.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When we moved from that home, we vowed to NEVER return. I'm
sure Bob and Mary are still haunting the place. They didn't like kids, because
they never had any, and they didn't get along well with any of the neighbors. I
can just see why they were trying to run us out.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello again, I this is an update on my house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved into this house in Nov 2004. As I
have recently stated in other stories my house is haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a little girl &amp; now I know there
is a ghost outside as well as another ghost inside so that makes a total of 3
now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband &amp; I seperated on
July 1 &amp; since he has left I have had a episode just about every
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first instance was July 4. I
had gone to bed &amp; left my son &amp; daughter with two of their friends
watching tv.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had earlier in the day
visited one of the houses I lived in that had an evil presence in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not go in b/c the area had grown up
with trees &amp; brush.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well that nite I
had a dream of being chased by something &amp; I was completly terrified in my
dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strange as it may seem I recall
feeling something sliding up the side of my bed above my covers while I was
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My hand was hanging off the bed
to my wrist and as I felt the movement on my bed it grabbed my hand &amp;
jerked it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I woke with a start b/c
of whatever was chasing me had me so scared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I later realized that it was one of my ghost that is inside waking me up
b/c they knew I was afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I was
awaken I was no longer afraid &amp; feel back to sleep. This was <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30</st1:time> in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next night my sons friend woke to use the
restroom &amp; "saw" me go from my room to the dining room. He told
my son about it the next morning &amp; my son asked him what time it was &amp;
the John said <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well my son knows me &amp; I am never up that
early.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when John told me about it
that evening I asked what "I" had on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said yellow pants &amp; a shirt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, I had to tell him that it was not me &amp; that I slept in grey
shorts &amp; a tshirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went white
&amp; said now that you say that I did think you were walking funny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gliding instead of walking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hope you enjoy this.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">hello! i love your site and frequently read it until my
contacts pop out of my eyes. ghosts are my greatest fear next to becoming a
ghost. that may lead you to believe that my mind plays tricks on me just to
indulge the fear--and it has several times--but my family and i recently moved
out of a house in which i encountered some kind of energy and the strange thing
is that it never scared me in the least.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the house is located in downtown Reading, Pennsylvania, a
very old and overpopulated city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we
moved in with a kung fu sifu/mystic who, after the first thing happened,
informed me that he and his former master had to cleanse the house of almost 70
spirits. they left two harmless spirits they said was a little boy and girl but
there was something that tormented these two that they could not remove without
pulling every trick in their book. with that info i will begin with the
experiences.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">on our first night there, my boyfriend and i were in our
room unpacking, our daughter, almost 2 years old, was playing on the bed. my
boyfriend went out to the bathroom and when he came back in and walked halfway
into the room we all heard three distinct taps on the door. my daughter called
out for whoever it was to come in as she did whenever she heard knocks on
doors. no one came in so my boyfriend opened the door but no one was there. he
immediately went downstairs to find our roommate who was just chillin on his
computer as usual. he came back upstairs and said, "you and your freakin
love of ghost stories! now you've got one!"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">before we moved in, we would often spend a lot of time there
because my boyfriend was taking kung fu classes there. there was an ugly art
deco clock on the bathroom wall that didn't work. it started working the night
we moved in. it stopped again when my boyfriend was made to move out (there was
alpha-male friction between him and our roommate).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i had a friend come over one night to do a tarot reading for
me. it was laughable and stupid but it affected her so much that she had to
stop it. she was really upset about something so she took me into the basement
and whispered to me that she thought the house was haunted. i told her i knew.
she said, "you know it's located right in front of the attic door?"
that, i didn't know. our bedroom door is adjacent to the attic door and the
wall in front of it happens to have the bathroom clock on the other side of it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i was going up the stairs to my room one day, leaving my
daughter downstairs with my roommate and i heard whistling just upstairs and
around the corner. it was a melody i can't recreate. i just giggled and
silently greeted the happy spirit and walked right through into my room. i
heard the whistling twice more on quiet evenings while i was in my room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">every so often i'd hear three taps on my door but never ever
EVER opened it. once my roommate tapped on the door and got pissed at me when i
didn't answer cuz he distinctly heard my daughter and i awake inside. it was
his fault for knocking that way.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">one night my boyfriend and i were watching a movie in the
basement with the baby monitor on because our daughter was sleeping upstairs.
we distinctly heard long sentences being whispered. our daughter only used one
word sentences at that time. we went upstairs to find her still fast asleep. we
noticed that a hand mirror that she was playing with earlier was laying face up
on the dresser which had a large mirror on the back of it. apparently mirrors
reflecting on eachother can open a portal for spirits.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">another night, my boyfriend and i and some friends from the
kung fu temple were hanging out in the living room sharing ghost stories. my
daughter was running from the living room to the kitchen happily. we weren't
watching her directly until we heard a huge bang and looked to see her stopped
dead in her tracks with the light bulb from above the sink on the floor rolling
in circles in front of her. she tore ass back to us. we all inspected it and
couldn't find why that happened or how it didn't go into the sink or break. it
just went straight for the floor. our door to our bedroom is directly above it
upstairs. my roommate later said that he thought the tormenting spirit had
returned.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the clock in the bathroom would be stopped on say eleven
o'clock. two hours later when i'd go back in it would be stopped at something
like four thirty. that cannot be explained.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my god this is getting long. anyway this all culminated in
seeing a spirit one night. i left my bedroom to go to the bathroom. the hallway
light was on so i wasn't backlit. i saw a shadow of a small head and shoulders
wavering in the far corner--it was about half my height. i watched it as i
walked sideways into the bathroom and it went down the stairs. i did my thing
and it wasn't till i went to walk back out that i realized there was something
i didn't want to see again out there. i called weakly for my boyfriend in the
bedroom but he couldn't hear me. i tore ass back in and just stood there not
breathing with tears streaming down my face. that was the last of it and two
weeks ago i moved out. thank you so much for bearing with me!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been a fan of your website for over two years
now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just wanted to tell you about
this house that I lived in in <st1:place><st1:City>Hanford</st1:City>, <st1:State>CA</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rented this house from a realty company and
quite quickly so I didn't have a chance to go in and look around too much
before signing the papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did make my
walk through and the only thing that I found in the house was a pick axe in the
garage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept it thinking whoever left
it might come back one day...boy was I ever right.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I lived in the house with my daughter,
boyfriend, invalid mother and my boyfriend's sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weird things started happening almost
immediately even though I never felt uncomfortable, everyone else did except my
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a picture of myself and
my boyfriend on the back of the commode in the hall bath and it kept getting
turned around towards the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just
thought it was my daughter or my boyfriend's sister doing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until one day I was at home alone and turned
it back correctly and came back to the restroom a few hours later and it was
turned around again facing the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
knew then it was something out of this world.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother could not have done it seeing she needed my help always to get
in and out of bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had doors that
would come open after they were shut and all that...but didn't think too much
of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That kind of stuff doesn't scare
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then one night we were having a
party at my house and I took a digital pic of my boyfriend and he was wearing a
black shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There appeared to be a man
holding a pick axe in front of him...very demonic looking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scared the pooh out of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ended up taking this picture t a medium to
see what she thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that the
spirit in the pic had attached itself to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was like..what???<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?? She
said that I looked just like his old girlfriend when he was alive and he
thought I was cheating on him with my boyfriend that is alive...that is why he
showed himself like that in the pic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well I didn't want to believe this so I went to the neighbors house, who
by the way had lived there for 20 years, and started asking questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who had lived there before?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had anyone died? etc, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was told immediately that they had thought
I was a girl named Linda when I came over to introduce myself for the first
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked who Linda was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They told me that Linda was the girlfriend of
a man that had lived in my house for over 15years and looked exactly like me
except that she had blonde hair and I have red hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was tragically killed in a motor accident
over 5 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This made my hair
stand on end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then had the medium come
to my house and try and get this "spirit" to go and find the
light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came in the house not knowing
all of the things that had gone on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
came in and began to tell me where and when the phenomenea(sp) had been
happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then made her way to the
garage and noticed the pick axe...told me it was his and I needed to get rid of
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then turned to my boyfriend and said very
calmly, "oh, he doesn't like you at all!!".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend didn't think anything of it
until she began to say that "Gerald" was not happy with her being
there and at that point the ashtray near my boyfriend, which had nothing in it
and was heavy glass exploded into 4 pieces.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all jumped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then cleansed
the house and we no longer felt unsafe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We moved shortly after that and haven't had an experience like that in a
long time...and hopefully will not anytime soon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LOL.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thanks for listening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I have seen encounters
of numerous ghosts a pair or younger girls around the age of 18 would follow
you into the house around midnight and walk up stairs with you. They would wait
untill you went into the room and closed the door to walk though the door and
dissappear. i witnessed watching the girls follow my brothers up the stairs,
and then dissappearing.Also once when we first moved in there i was sleeping
with my dog and he just started barking and i looked in the mirrow on the wall
and there was a figure of a man and when i closed my eyes and opened them he
was gone. thats my personal experence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghostly Experiences</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Snoopieracine@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hi, my name is
Ayme. It's been a few weeks since I've even been to your site. But I'm back and
I would like to share another experience ( I feel as if I'm among friends on
this site!). It's a short one, so I hope I don't disappoint anyone. Well,
around 10 years ago, when my daughter was 3, now 13, we moved into an old
building and a few odd things happened. You see, we moved to three different
apartments in the same building, but only had experiences in two. In the first
apartment we moved into, at first it was little things. Small things would
disappear, most specifically lighters. My husband and I both smoke and we both
keep lighters, which for some reason only one would disappear. At this point we
are both thinking; one of the kids took it, after all we had four small
children ages 3, 7, 9 and 10. So we would turn the apartment upside down and
inside out looking for the missing item, but could not locate it's hiding
place. Well of course we're thinking; they got us good, they found a new hiding
place! The very next day, the item would turn up in the same exact spot that it
was placed, in the exact position it was placed. Of course every one got
grounded since no one knew, or saw who took it. Also some times during the day
you could hear little kids running in the hallway, but when you go out to the
hall, the noise stops and no one is anywhere around. But one event sticks out
in my mind. On a very hot day, my husband and I were sitting in our room in
front of a fan talking, trying to stay cool. The fan was one of those desk top
fans that have four big buttons, Off, Hi, Med and Low, in that order at the
base. Well as we both glance in the direction of the fan, the Off button goes
down as if some one pressed it, and the fan shut down. My husband and I were
both shocked to say the least and we were silent for a few seconds. Then my
husband said " If you turned it off, you can turn it back on" to
which I said " Oh no, If that fan turns on by it's self, I'm out the
door!" I jumped up and turned it on myself. At the second apartment
nothing really happened, but things changed when we moved to the second
apartment. Some of the same things disappearing and reappearing in the same
place a day or two later. The boys, all three of them shared a big bedroom,
were afraid to go to bed at night. They claimed that nearly every night they
would see a floating hairy hand that sometimes had a knife appear in their
bedroom. I didn't believe them, even though a few times one of the boys would
scream, as if the devil were in there with him. I'd run in there and of course
there would be nothing there and I would scold them. But two more strange
things happened. 1. You would hear some one knock on the door, but when you
open the door no one is there. The weird thing is this, the building is old and
the stairs (wooden by the way) creek, so you would be able to hear anyone on
those stairs even if they tried to creep down. 2. A puppy we acquired would
start to cry in the middle of the night and would hide under our bed, this
happened for a few months and did not stop until we moved out. I have already
submitted a few stories of personal experiences and for some reason most of it
seems to happen around me ( except for my grandmother's story, that happened
when my mother, now 69, was a year old. I have submitted stories from two email
addresses. My first, aymeaponte@sbcglobal.net and my second,
snoopieracine@aol.com. Now I live in an <st1:address><st1:Street>apartment</st1:Street>
 3</st1:address> blocks away from that building and as it so happens, this
apartment is haunted by a male spirit. I have grown used to him, as has our
dog, Lady. From time to time he will let us know he's still around. He will
walk in, or knock on my bedroom door, or touch me. When I get fed up i say
"stop it, leave me alone" and it stops. So I figure he just wants
attention. I hope you enjoyed my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Ghost in the Bathroom</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: redkeff@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband and I moved in this apartment in august 04. At
first we had trouble sleeping, we would wake up early every morning for no
reason. After a while we decided to close our bedroom door thinking it would
stop some noises coming form the kitchen and help us sleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It actually helped so we though we solved the problem. Then
we adopted a dog and we put her in a closed space between our bedroom and the
bathroom when we would go out. For few days she was fine there. But then one
night we came back and she looked really stressed and when we would approach
her, she would crawl away and close her eyes like she expected us to hit her.
Which we never did, she is such a nice dog. It took us few minutes to calm her
that night. It scared us so much to see her acting that way that we installed a
camera to see how she was when we were gone. We did it and realized that she
would stay away as much as she could from the bathroom door.She was crying but
very quietly like she didn't want to get the attention of anyone who could be
on the other side of the bathroom door. At first we though that she was just
having the stress that some dogs have when they&#8217;re left home alone. But then we
tried to film her again, out of her closed space. She was incredibly quiet and
relaxed so we decided to never put her back in there. Then we though, she just
don&#8217;t like closed space.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then one day I was taking a shower when I saw the shadow of
someone walking through the bathroom, but I was home alone. I got really scared
and got out of the bath right away to check the apartment and see if all the
doors were locked. No one was there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Few days after, one morning my husband was in the shower and
he started to talk to me so I came in the bathroom and said &#8220;Who are you
talking to?&#8221; and he said &#8220;to you!, I heard you opening the door&#8221; but I was in
the kitchen the whole time. Now, the bathroom door is a sliding door that goes
in the wall to save space, it&#8217;s heavy and it makes a specific sound when you
open it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Few days later, we woke up, I got in the shower and my
husband went outside walking the dog. Few second later I heard the door opening
and though &#8220;wow he made it short, he&#8217;s probably tired&#8221;. But I didn&#8217;t check the
door. Then I got out of the shower and realized the door was closed even if I
never heard it closing back. I got out of the bathroom just in time to see my
husband getting it the apartment with the dog. He was out the whole time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then last week we were getting ready to go to bed and my
husband said, &#8220;it&#8217;s a weird night tonight, I don&#8217;t know why&#8221;. I felt the same
and I had trouble to fall asleep. But I finally felt asleep few seconds when I
heard steps in the room on my husband side of the bed. First I though it was
him but I realized he was still in bed with me. Plus those were very loud, like
the person was wearing boots. I look up and saw nothing but got so scared that
I yelled my husband name. He woke up and turned immediately towards the sounds
and said &#8220;what was that?!&#8221;. Since that day I&#8217;m keeping a journal of everything
that will happened to us.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also, I know it will sound weird but once I was in the
shower and suddenly I got this weird awake dream or vision of myself slipping
in the bath tube and drowning unconscious. It came like that and then it went
away and I never got scared of the bath again. I think maybe that&#8217;s what
happened there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunting</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Cbohar@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am submitting to you my story as to the updates regarding
the hauntings in my home in <st1:State><st1:place>Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>.
I submitted some of the happenings which you posted when I was 12 years old
although it is highly unlikely you remember as that was almost 8 years ago. I
am 20 now and still live here. I still remain in the dark as to what exactly
the beings are in my residence but over the years the activity has died down to
a greater extent. I will fill you in on the incidents starting from around 2001
up until the current time. I owned a dog named Mutley, a good dog whom had to
be put down due to old age in March of 2001. The incidents involving what I
believe to be the spirit of my dog occured around 3 or 4 months after we had
put her to sleep. In life Mutley would often sit outside the bedroom door on
the second floor and her tail had the habit of hitting the bottom of the door.
You would also hear her licking her paws. This activity she did virtually every
night during her life resumed in the months following her death. It was an
unnerving experience yet not in the least frightening. I would only ever hear
her and have yet to catch a glimpse. On several occasions late in the evening I
would occasionally hear footsteps going 4 or 5 steps down into the kitchen and
then it would reverse and come back upstairs and the licking sounds would
resume. I worked up the courage on more than a few occasions to open the door
yet nothing was there. It seemed also that the sounds of the dog licking her
paws were more prevelent than her tail hitting the door although I hear this
occasionally as well. My parents were nights, I work during the day so I am
usually along during the night. The recliner is right next to the arched
entrance leading to the kitchen so I can see right into it. Out of view but on
the right side of the kitchen are 3 steps, a small landing, and then another 10
steps leading to the second floor. While sitting in that recliner some nights I
would hear shuffling, scratching, and light footsteps overhead. Now we had a
problem with mice a few years back when a housing developemtn was put up a few
blocks from me where a field used to be but even with this explanation for the
scratching I could not debunk just what was causing the shuffling and walking
sounds. The walking sounds were not a dog's though they were human and sounded
like a man's footfalls, like he was wearing perhaps a boot or other kind of
heavy shoe.My parent's bedroom is overhead from the living room and the footsteps
never seemed to cross into mine except on rare occasions. The most frightening
incident involving these footsteps was about 2 years ago when I was studying
for my criminal justice course in the kitchen around 9 or 10 in the evening.
That was when I heard the footfalls, very heavy, walking down the steps which
are wooden and not covered by any carpeting so they were quite loud. It came
about 6 steps down or so. Needless to say caused me to leave the house for a
good hour or so and I sat on the porch contemplating what had happened. I was
the only person home, certainly nobody could have entered without me knowing.
When I get home from work (I work in a warehouse) I ususally take a nap for an
hour or so. I would lie upstairs awake and hear my name "CHRIS"
called, very close as if right beside me and loud enough that I would often ask
"what?" I would assume it was one of my parents but they would deny
having every called out to me. Things constantly disappear around my house, my
weight set, my wallet, etc. and they turn up in the strangest places where I
know they shouldn't be. On one occasion I found the wallet in the shed out back
which I havent been in for months. You can leave money or keys right behind you
and turn around a moment later and they are gone sometimes reappearing in the
other room. The basement itself has a frightening vibe to it. We have a
backroom in our basement, more like a narrow corridor which houses the furnace
and the water heater and such. My friend Steve is an avid ghost hunter and he
had set up his camcorder in there one evening and we left it down there a good
45 minutes. Upon reviewing the tape we saw orbs, and not clouds of dust
particles or the like but individual orbs that would move in strange patterns.
I have sighten the orbs throughout the house and even outside on many
occasions. They are solid white, appear brifly, and either vanish altogether or
move off eradicly as if they're startled. My ten year old cousin seen this when
she visited and when I asked her describe them she seen in the same manner as I
had. Some of my friends have also seen them. The hallway light also has a
strange tendancy to turn itself on and off when nobody is around. The most
frequent encounter I have had has unnerved me a bit. My bedroom is small, maybe
10 feet by 13 feet. The door is on the left my bed is centered at the back
wall. The door is right by the left hand corner. About a week ago I was
awakened about 4 in the morning to a extremely strong feeling of a presence. It
was a strong sensation of being watched. I looked and seen what looked to be a
man, more of a dark silouette. Very tall, maybe 6 foot 7 inches or so.I could
make out no features such as in the face or style of clothing but he seemed to
have one arm folded over his torso and one at his side. He stood a few inches
away from the closet door and right next to the bedroom door and watched me for
a good 10 minutes, he stepped back a few inches, then forward again and then
vanished. If it hadn't been for the strong presence that accompanied it I would
have written this one off as a visual hallucination, the product of too little
sleep or the like. I haven't encountered Mutley lately but the man who haunts
the upstairs I cannot identify, only that he had heavy footfalls and is very
tall. He would easily stand 8 inches taller than me. It is a strong yet very
empty presense as it seems unhappy. The house is 76 years old and I have only
rudimentary information about it's history. Deaths could have occured here but
in my mind whatever is here is harmless although occasionally frightening in
it's behaviors. Thank you for providing the medium for myself and so many
others to contribute their encounters!</p>

I've been here about a boy who died in the burn unit several years ago. The
burn unit is now shut down and changed in to a caridac floor, but the boy still
wanders from 4th floor to other floors. The story goes that this boy died in
the burn unit and is forever looking for hismother. He wanders around asking
patients where his mom is, and a bouncing ball is oten reported where ever he's
been. I heard this story for about two years before witnessing an event that
took place which involved him. it was in room 659 and that room was pretty wild
anyway. For one, patients in that room tended to hallucinate more than patients
in other rooms. There was an ongoing joke about that room being the 'haunted'
one.. I couldn't quite putmy finger on it, but there was an unusual energy in
there. Once night, a nurse I work with had that room and at about 3am the call
light went on . She went to answer it and came out looki white as a sheet.
Betty (this nurse) was very practical and narrow minded about the supernatural,
but she had to tell us all at the nurse station that her little old surgical
patient had just reported that at little boy was in her room and asking her
where is mommy is. The patient told Betty that the boy was bouncing a ball and
that she was surprised how well she could hear him speak and the ball bounce in
the room because she was very deaf and sleeping with no hearing aides. Of
course, we all felt goose bumps! We'd heard of the boy, this was our first
experience with him. Other floors had tales to tell as well. There was one
other room on that unit that had a all light that would go off by itself. Once
night it went off about three times with nobody in there. Pretty soon we didn't
want to go in there to turn in off! Once night a nurse I know saw a heavy
closet door open all by itselt, all the way. He couldn't explain to his own
satisfaction (to himself) how this occurred. He was so freaked he wouldn't go
to the bathroom on that unit for the rest of the night. He didn't want to be
alone. Another nurse I know, Michelle, she went to a storage room and began to
reach up to a high shelf. She was all alone in this small closet, light on and
the door closed behind her. Suddenly she felt hands on each side of her waist
grip her and lift her off the ground! I can't tell you how many dying people
have seen their loved ones and friends while lying on their death beds;. I
believe them and respect this when it happens. I've come to know the feeling of
when someone is dying and going to die very very soon. I know the feeling of
walking in to a room where someone has just passed over. The energy in their
room changes. It becomes heavy and light at the same time. You walk through
this vibrating energy and you can almost smell the waves. I believe this is
because death bed room fills with spirit, coming to welcome a person crossing
over. Myself and two other nurses went to the chapel in our spital and
prayed/guided the little boy with his ball . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to the Light. The new chapel is where we did
this work, because the old one was so haunted that we could hardly walk in the
door without feeling pressure of presence. It was so very intense it became a
dare at 3am on the midnight shift to see who could go in there and actually sit
down one minute at a time! I believe that maybe these placesare so thinck
because the rooms are often closed off with no windows; they haven't been
cleansed between patients, energy residue remains and becomes trapped. The
hospital chapel is full of pain and loss and despair. Imagine the emotion and
energy left at that alter!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Strange Happenings</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Molly17g@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I felt compelled to send in a few of my strange experiences
that I had at my grandparent's former house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One evening I was talking on the phone to a friend in the
master bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was nearly 2 in the
morning and the room was pitch black as I was going to get some sleep
directly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I chatted to my friend,
suddenly I saw what is best described as a black cloud about the shape, size,
and position of where a person's head should be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bobbed as if someone were walking by at
the foot of the bed for about 3 seconds and then it was gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was doing some homework at the kitchen table on evening
when out of the corner of my eye I again saw a black flash that looked to be
about the size of a small dog run across the hallway floor. When I commented on
this, my grandmother, who was in the living room at the time, claimed to
experience the same thing all the time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My grandparents house is set up so that you walk in the
front door and all the rooms are connected by a hallway that at one end leads
to the kitchen and dinning room, living room, master bedroom, staircase to the
second floor, bathroom, and back to the door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was summertime and my mother and I were arguing. I was standing at
the foot of the stairs and looking at her in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was making a fuss saying that I wanted to
sleep upstairs, which I had only recently conquered my fear of, and she was
telling me that it was too hot up there to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mid sentence I glanced up the staircase and
what I saw horrified me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Staring back
down at me from the top of the steps was the hazy, cloud-like figure of a
human, I believe it was a male.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
only the second time I was ever truly afraid.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was cleaning my new room on the second floor one day and
it was very hot being that it was summer and heat rises so I opened one of the
old weighted windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not an easy
task due to old paint which had practically glued it shut and it only budged
after I pried it with a screwdriver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried to pull it down to see if I needed to prop it and it wouldnt move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I carried on with my cleaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard
the window shut with a loud bang behind me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again I opened the window only this time I propped it open with a paint
stir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about 2 minutes, the window
again banged shut behind me, this time so hard that the glass broke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The paint stir was at least 8 ft. Across the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said "You win " and
ran down stairs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Completely Scare at One Time</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well, there was a time where I was so completely scared of
encounters that I thought that if I ever had one, I would never be the same.
About 6 years ago when I was 10, we were living in a really old house and I was
kind of not feeling well about not moving in. The first night that we had
stayed there, I was kind of comfortable but not really. The first full day was
okay. But that night, I had heard something in my room. I slowly got up and
made way to my room. I looked and the only light coming in was the light from
the moonlight. But as I stared harder. There was a huge flash of light that came
in on the top corner of the room. I got so scared!! I slowly walked into the
room and said "Um.. Is someone here?" Just then I heard someone
whispering to me and said "Don't leave!" I screamed and ran out of
the room, my mom was saying "Mijita, what is wrong?" I told her
everything and so my mom is scared of these kind of things. Right as soon as I
told her, we moved out and while we were moving the ghost said "please
don't leave!" I didn't care...I left anyways....ever since then I have had
no encounters with anything for 6 years.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm Diana and this thing happened to me when I was 10 yrs
old , Now I'm 18 and I still remember as if It happened yesterday. Believe me .
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 10 yrs old my parents and I rented in an
apartment , and the apartment had 4 floors. So in the 1st floor my mothers's
friend babysitted my little sister , in that time my sister karen had
5months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So one day I decided to go down
there and check up my sister , so then<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>my mom's friend and children were in the living room<span style="">&nbsp; </span>, and her other 2 children were in her room.
In the kitchen they<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had a washroom. Then
all of the sudden we heard screams<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of a
Little girl. So she tought<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was one of
her girls so she told one of her daughters to see if one of her little sister
was there. She came back and told us nobody was there. So she sat on the cauch.
Then again , he heard this huge scream saying " Mommy
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" but in spanish. And we all just stayed quiet and
serious. We couldnt believe what we were<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>hearing. Then ,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she told the
owner of the building and he told her that his daughter of 7 yra old<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had died there , because she had choken. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From since , everytime I tell this it gives me chills
because I still remember the screms of the little girl in my head so clearly. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then my moms friend change houses because she had boughten a
new house, and from then I seen people<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>move in and moving out , And I wonder if those people go , because<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they seen or heard the little girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that my parents and I moved weeks after

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friends and i were fooling around on the computer when i
remembered your website. It was late and i wanted to freak them out a little.
So i showed them the <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
part of the hauntings section. After reading some of the neighboring towns, i
read to them the <st1:City><st1:place>Pittsfield</st1:place></st1:City> one
(that is where we all live). Everyone said they had never heard of the
hauntings there, so we decided to go see if it was true or not. We were all
very skeptical about the whole thing, but we decided to go none the less. The 5
of us packed into the car and went on our way. We got there at about 12pm, and
drove into the field. We saw lots of hardwear and big metal containers. But
suddenly it stopped a little ways in. As if no one wanted to go that deep into
the wooded area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went in about 50
yards where we were completly surrounded by woods, except for the front of the
car, and behind is. We turned off the car and rolled the windows down a little
bit so we could hear if anything was out there. We sat there for about 5
minutes and were ready to leave when all of the sudden we heard footsteps. Not
those of an animal, but of a human. We thought it might be the cops, but we saw
no flashlights or anything. The footsteps continued for about 30 seconds, and
seemed to get closer. Then my boyfriend and his friend whisperd
"Look!", and pointed to the windshield. A shadowy dark figure seemed
to glide across the windshield. It scared us half to death. We also heard the
sounds of a train. The one final thing that happend (which made us leave) was a
light tapping on the windows of the car. First the drivers side, then the
passengers side. After that we just left because it was too creepy. But to whom
ever goes there, bring a camera and a tape recorder so you can see and hear all
of e weird and strange things that happen there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: LnVSmith@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We lived in the old plantation house when i was in high
school. We had several sightings including an old lady that stood over my
sisters bed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at least three times once
telling her of a car wreck that we had on the way to school.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The most interesting was when a friend of my sister came to
pick her up for school and never blew the horn so my sister looked out and she
was already there. When my sister got into the car she asked her if Calley (our
other sister) had not told her that she was there. Tiffany looked at her and
said I'm the only one here. Her friend said Calley came out on the porch just
twenty minutes ago and went back in. Tiffany really was there alone as far as
she knew.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The other thing that made this so scary was the following
story.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was working on a car in the drive and my sister Calley
walked by me going to barn and I said hey but she just kept going. Then I got
to thinking she was dressed funny in a long dress down to her ankles. I went to
ask my dad were she was going and she was sitting on the couch with him. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Both of these stories had to be told so I could share this.
When we moved out five years later we went into the cellar to check if we left
anything. We noticed a brick loose in the old foundation and pulled it out
there was a box inside with pictures in it. When we looked at them there was a
picture of a young girll that could have been Calleys twin. Our land lord said
it was her great-great aunt that had died of TB at the age of twelve in the
room my sister slept in. When our land lord saw Calley she almost fainted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Offutt Air Force Base</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: <st1:PersonName>flyboywhit2004@aol.com</st1:PersonName></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was stationed at Offutt Air force Base between 1999 and
early 2003.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During my time I had heard
many stories and had been witness to something I can&#8217;t explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of the incidents I heard concerned the
old <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Fort</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName>Crook</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
section of the base, including the base lodging office where I worked at and
Quarters 13, which was on Generals Row and was used as the Distinguished
Visitors Quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I encountered something I can&#8217;t explain at the Lodging
office one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me and the Sergeant I
was working with that night heard someone typing and moving around in the back
offices, which were locked about 6 hours earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both went in there and there was no one
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both doors were still
locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Niether of us could explain it
and both of us had heard it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another
night we heard the same thing and heard a radio turn on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both ran back there and once again
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We even looked at the clock
that had turned on by itself, thinking maybe the alarm was timed to go off at
that time, but the alarm was turned off and it was not even set up when we
pressed the button it still flashed <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it was about <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30</st1:time> in the morning, which didn&#8217;t make sense.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Quarters 13th, which was our responsibility since it was the
DV suites, was even more troublesome.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The people who stayed there were usually Colonels and above transiting
through the base.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very high ranking
people, people you normally wouldn&#8217;t expect to hear anything about weird
noises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night stands out quite a bit
in my mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A Colonel kept calling the
front desk complaining of people walking around in the attic and making a lot
of noise.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I went over there to check it
out, which is about a 5 minute walk from the lodging office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Colonel was waiting on the porch and we
both went up to the attic to check it out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The door was locked and after unlocking it, we both went inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was in there, just some boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got a very weird feeling while we were up
there that someone was watching me, but there was no one there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I explained to the Colonel that maybe it was
a rat or something in a box or something that made those noises.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He shrugged and went back to bed and I am
sure he was as unconvinced as I was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went back to the lodging office and talking to my co worker she told me about
the building and the stories about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Apparently whatever was in there had manifested itself to
the housekeeping staff, as several of them refused to go in the attic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would never say why, but they refused to
go up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And one of the rooms was
also supposedly haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard this in
the early part of 2000, and in late 2002 a One star General died of a heart
attack in that same room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know
whether to believe what I heard or not, but I heard from several people that
were there in the room that he had died with his eyes open and a horrified look
on his face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have remained skeptical
of hearing this, I figure even if this was true it may have just been from the
shock and realization he was dying&#8230;.but then again, who knows.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Other buildings on the base that I have heard that were
haunted were the base gym and the old <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Martin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Bomber</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Building</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
on the base, where B-29s were built during World War 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I worked at the gym for about two years while
at Offutt and I saw something odd one day with my supervisor when we were doing
our final checks of the building.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
gym is a old aircraft hangar and is nearly a quarter of a mile long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rode around in a golf cart for our
checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a &frac14; mile track inside
the gym, and all the state flags hang from the ceiling around the track.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we were doing our checks, the flags
began moving infront of us, like someone had been running by and jumped and hit
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except the flags hang nearly 40 feet
up in the air and there was no wind inside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither one of us could explain this.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But I do know that someone had died of a heart attack while jogging a
couple of years earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could it have
been him out for a run? I am curious if you have heard any other stories about
Offutt Air Force Base.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am working on
some research on the base and I am wondering if anyone else has experienced
something at Offutt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can be reached at
