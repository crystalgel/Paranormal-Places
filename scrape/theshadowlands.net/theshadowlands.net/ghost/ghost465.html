<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I slept in the same
room with
my mother, my brother Jeffrey had the room all by himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was the dead of winter in upper New
York.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had all went to bed, when all
of a sudden I woke up and screamed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Standing smiling at me was my brother Keith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was illuminated, just so lit up, wearing a
white t shirt, with one hand on his hip, a sleepy smile on his face,
one leg
crossed over the other, looking at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I screamed, my mother woke up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told her what I saw, she assumed that Keith was killed.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the only way that he could have
appeared to me that evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
was so upset she reached his commanding officer, and was told he was
alright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was alive and well.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I really believe in the astro plane and
believe to this day he came to me to say that he was alright.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Just to close up this happening, Keith was
still in the Navy off the coast of Viet Nam.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few weeks later he came to visit mom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I took a picture of him in this chair that we had in our bedroom.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He's sitting in the chair and wearing a white
t shirt as I saw on him when he appeared to me with his same sleepy
smile that
he always has when he's tired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still
have that picture to this day<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kay's goodbye<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This happened
several years
ago in Sacramento 1992. It was a little after 1 o'clock on a Wednesday
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't get any sleep.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was tossing and turning and hearing all of
these voices in my ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whisperings,
pssss, pssss, whispering, talking like a whole lot of whisperings
voices talking
to me all at once, in my ears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
sounded like a hundred little voices talking all at once. And when I
sleep I
usually slept in the nude and was uncovered because it was a summer
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden I felt something in
my
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked around in the dark and
felt a presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't touch it or
see it, but I felt it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I actually felt
my bed sag like it does when someone sits on the bed to talk with you.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I pulled the covers over me and felt the
hairs stand on the back of my neck and asked "who's there".<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to cover myself, it felt as if someone
was watching me. I couldn't stop the feeling that someone was beside me.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>After a while I fell asleep, but was kinda
scared to be in the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day I
couldn't shake the feeling of the last nights experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Anyway, two weeks
later my ex
called to tell me that our best friend Kay had died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Kay and I had become really goods friend when
my husband and I lived in Oklahoma City for a year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was like my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since my
mother lived in New York and I was
in my twenties, Kay kinda of took the now position of mother to me.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My ex had kept in touch with Kay,
because
when we divorced Kay was always under the assumption that I would
return to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">He told me that she
had died
in the early hours of a Wednesday morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of a sudden I knew that my friend had come to say goodbye to
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even now as I'm writing this
experience, I still feel like crying. It was Kay who was with me when
she
passed!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those voices were angels talking
to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew something to, but didn't
know why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked my ex if he had
received a letter from Kay. He said that he had and that the letter was
received on the afternoon of that Wednesday.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I also asked him if in that letter she had stated that she had
hoped
that we would get back together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said, yes, how did you know?.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said I
just knew, that's all, I just knew.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although at the time I did not know what the presence was, it
was just
this knowing that she had cared enough to say goodbye.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I cried for two weeks knowing I lost my best
friend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A few years ago my
best
friend and I were driving around in the local cemetary looking for a
relatives
gravestone. Mind you this was in broad daylight. Anyways as we are
driving
around my friend says to me "Look at those beautiful flowers, we should
steal them." She was just joking of course, but as we tried to leave
the
cemetary the car kept stalling and wouldn't go anywhere. We tried like
10 times
to leave but we couldn't. Finally I looked at her and said "You know
maybe
if you apoligized for that remark they might let us leave." I too was
actually joking , but she voiced an apology anyways. After apologizing
to the
"ghosts" we again tryed to leave the cemetary and low and behold the
car was fine again and we were able to drive off. I don't know for sure
what
happened that day, but it was really freaky.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi, I just wanted
to share
some personal experiences with you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
grew up about 7 miles from the Elizabeth Town hall and went in every
month,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instantly you get a creepy
feeling rather is from the stiff air or the smell who knows.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been in once, and could here men
talking up stairs when noone was up there. and everytime I pass by it
the
fartherest window on the left in the second row always seem to catch my
attention and you can see shadows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have also lived next to Fort Jackson for about 5 years visiting as
often as i
could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The moment you walk over the
bridge you begin to feel strange,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>story
goes two watch soldiers fought on the bridge, one feel over and drowned.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One halloween my boyscout group spent the
night with our parents, the next morning i woke up to use the restroom
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>behind me in the mirror was a soldier
starring at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sad to say I haven't
been back since the hurricanes but i cant wait to get back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In 1971 my wife and
I bought
an old brown-stone row house in Brooklyn. It was built in 1898. The
house had
been bought in 1929 by a family of unmarried brothers and sisters named
Walsh.
The three women were all school teachers, the two brothers were both
policemen.
None of them married nor had children. They were a devout Irish
Catholic
family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By 1971 the five of
them had
all passed away and the house was left to the local Catholic Church. We
bought
the house as an estate complete with the contents. There were crosses
and
portraits of Jesus and Mary all over the place. In the personal effects
that we
found in the dresser drawers were rosaries, mass cards, mementoes of
trips to
Ireland and the Vatican. There were even a couple of framed
certificates from
Pope Pius XII commemorating Papal audiences for a couple of the family
members.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Being Jewish
ourselves we
really didn't have use for this stuff. BUT, we felt it was sacred and
important
to these people and should be treated with respect. We donated a lot of
the
religious items to the church and set up a kind of shrine in one of the
unused
bedrooms. A large portrait of Jesus sat in the center of the room's
fireplace
mantle. We flanked it with statues of Mary and Saints Anthony, Francis
and
Christopher. We placed other smaller items on a lower shelf. It all
looked very
church-like. (We are kind of kooky that way being artists) Even as a
Jew, I got
a good feeling whenever I went in that room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We lived in that
house for
eleven years and I can't help but believe that the spirits of those
five
brothers and sisters looked after us for treating their sacred items
with
respect. Right there in the heart of Flatbush with soot from the nearby
building incinerators (they were still using them in those days) and
the noise
and hub-bub of Flatbush Avenue a block away, our little backyard was
like an
oasis. Everything we planted grew beautifully. We had hanging planters
right
outside the kitchen window and I often saw humming birds hovering
around the
flowers. We had all kinds of beautiful birds you would never expect to
see in a
Brooklyn backyard landing and feeding in our bird feeder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We had our first
child when
we lived there and we made life long friends amongst our neighbors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We moved in 1982
because
although the house and our block was great, the surrounding area was
not fit to
raise kids in. We moved to the suburbs. We've had a pretty good life
since
then. But, neither of the two houses we've lived in since that one in
Brooklyn
had the same calm and serene feeling. The friendly ghosts of the Walsh
family
really gave off good vibrations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Mary (as we will
call her)
and her son had moved to the US from Mexico to be with Mary's husband,
Jose (as
we will call him).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary and Jose were
elated at the approval of the work visa and even more excited when the
company
Jose worked for assisted in getting a permanent work visa and green
card for
Jose, thus allowing the family to stay in the US.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose's
job transferred him to Alabama.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since this
was a temporary position expected
to last two years, they opted to rent rather than purchase a home. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Since they knew no
one and
needed a place rather quickly, they signed a three-month lease
agreement on a
quaint trailer on an acre of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trailer was clean and in exceptional shape even though it was a few
years
old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their first night, her husband
awoke screaming and in a cold sweat from a horrible nightmare.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In a panic, he ran down the hallway towards
the room where their son slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose
would not tell Mary about the dream other than it was about their son.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>For the next three nights, Jose slept in the
living room directly adjacent to their sons room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">After their first
week, Mary
was getting breakfast ready when her son walked in to the kitchen and
said,
"Momma, there is a mean man in my room."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary,
thinking it was nothing more than her
three year old sons imagination, asked "How do you know he is
mean?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To which he replied "He
looks mean and stares at me with a mean face."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary,
trying to ease her son said, "Well,
the next time you see him, tell him that you aren't scared of him
because
you're a big boy and that he needs to go away and scare someone
else."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her son looked at the floor
and said, "But, momma, I already told him that he scared me and he
laughed."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary hugged her son
thinking it was his childish imaginations in a new home and told him to
try
what she was telling him and the mean man would go away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The next night,
Mary was
startled awake by her son standing silently by her bed, staring at her.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He only said, "Momma, the mean man came
back and told me that he wasn't going away."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary
put him in bed with her and went back to
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after that, her husband
again
awoke from a nightmare screaming and again he ran down the hallway.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary and their son followed close behind him
and stopped him in the living room of the trailer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Jose saw their son, he cradled his face
in his hands and said, "from now on, you sleep with Mommy and Daddy.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>You don't sleep in that room."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He looked at Mary and said, "Don't you
dare put him back in that room."<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">He never explained
it to her
even though she asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long after
that night, Jose began to have fitful dream.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would swing his arms around like he was fighting someone.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Once he blacked Mary's eye and busted her
nose flailing his arms around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
that, he gave them the bed and slept on the couch in the living room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary would wake to the sound of her husband
tossing and turning and arguing in his sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had began to sleep walk into the room where she and her son
slept.
She became fearful of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Her son was still
complaining
of seeing the mean man at various other places in the home and yard.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One morning, Mary awoke to her son
crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she asked him what was
wrong, he said "Daddy was playing with the mean man and the mean man
hurt
Daddy's hand."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later that day, Jose
came home from the doctor's office with his hand in a cast.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He had not gone to work, he had gone instead
to the emergency room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow, he had
broken his hand during the night but he couldn't remember how.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Mary was getting very scarred.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Mary called her
family back
in Mexico once a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had already
lived in the trailer for over a month but the last time she talked to
her
family things were fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now things
weren't fine and she wasn't sure if she should even tell them about the
odd
events and ask them for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since they
were back in Mexico and she didn't see how they could help, she decided
to keep
the odd events to herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, when her
grandmother began asking Mary about her son and her husband and hinted
that she
knew things were not well, Mary felt sick.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She tried to keep the appearance that things were fine but after
her
monthly call, she was even more concerned than ever.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Fearing that she
was going
through this all alone, she contacted the nearest catholic church
(which was 26
miles away).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She spoke to a priest who
focused in quickly on the mean man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
told her that it sounded like this may be a demon type of haunting.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He sent her a bottle of blessed oil and told
her to take the oil, pray a cleansing prayer in each room and anoint
the doors
and windows in each room with a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the oil
in the shape of a cross.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While her
husband and son slept, she did just as the priest commanded her.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was instant relief, so much so that they
signed a full one year lease when the three months were up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For the next year,
things
were wonderful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband stopped
having night terrors, he was no longer sleep walking or having the
violent
sleep experiences and he started sleeping with her again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her son stopped complaining about the mean
man and began sleeping in his own room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everything returned to normal; even her grandmother commented on
the
relief she heard in Mary's voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Then, Mary's
landlord came to
her and told her that they were going to be taking the trailer to
another lot
and placing a larger, nicer trailer on that lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
extended the offer to stay in the current
location at the same rent when the new trailer came or to move with the
old
trailer to another lot at the same rent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mary and Jose decided to stay at the current location with the
new
trailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new trailer was much larger
and nicer, they watched anxiously as the workers set it up.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>For Mary's then 4 year old son, it was
magical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">That first night in
the new
trailer, Mary had difficulty sleeping as did Jose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their son came running in to the room just at
3 AM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was crying and said,
"Mommy, the mean man is back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why
did you take the crosses down?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This floored Mary because she never told her son or husband
about
blessing the house and anointing the doors and windows with blessed oil
in the
shape of the cross.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Play With My
Dog<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My boyfriend and I
have a dog
in Brooklyn and while takes the dog for walks in the morning, I take
him out in
the evening. I only walk around the block, but at a certain
house/drive-way I
would get a feeling that someone was walking behind me. On one evening
the
feeling was so strong I turned around with a gasp. my dog is too
interested in
the next tree to notice anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On another occasion
when i
was feeling very sick with a cold during the winter, my dog paused at
the
driving to do his business. Our walk was nearly over so i wasn't in a
rush (my
dog had been pulling me most of the way). All of a sudden I hear a
clink. I
look over and I see that the other end of the leash is on the sidewalk.
My dog
and I look at each other for a second before he takes off down the
pitch black
driveway. He would have been impossible to catch for the next 20
minutes. The
entire time i am chasing him behind a row of houses I feel a presence
around
watching me. the presence was strongly male, but I couldn't tell if it
was an
adolescent or adult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">After that, I
wouldn't walk
on that side of the street. I wouldn't even look in the direction of
that
house. When my dog paused on the street across from that driveway, I
ignored
the feeling that someone was around. My dog and I started to walk away
and
something bangs loudly against the metal parking sign. I ignored it
however,
refusing to be antagonized. From then on, I chose a different route to
walk my
dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dorms) and have run into numerous unexplained events.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One event that sticks out deals with my
roommate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wears stud earrings in both
ears and never takes them out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
morning after we woke up for class he asked us if we knew where they
were
because the backs were still stuck to the back of his ear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To our shock both earrings are sitting in the
middle of the floor right next to each other as almost they have been
placed
that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We couldn't think of any
explanation because of the placement of both earrings and the backs
still being
stuck to the back of his ears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another
occurrence that we encountered twice is the shower turns on
unexpectedly in the
middle of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, we all sleep
in the same room so we would know if it was a roommate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Loud banging noises have also come from the
bathroom at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for reading my
email about our experiences because we found it really strange that we
saw
there was another haunting on the website also in Cobb.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We have owned our
home since
1981 in Ladson, SC. The first few years we did not feel the presence of
a
ghost. I saw the young man as I sat on my sofa and he was standing
within the
kitchen door frame. He just stood there and then vanished. The back
bedroom had
always been very cool either in summer or winter with air or heat on.
Over
years, children and grandchildren have lived in that room and witnessed
a
person or felt a person or were helped by this person. I have seen him
often
and perceive him to have red hair, a young teen with broad heavy(not
fat)
build. Sometimes he smiles, sometimes he just stands and stares.
Sometimes when
something comes up missing, (I named him Philip) I ask him to please
return it
and it reappears in an obvious place within minutes. I have seen him
ONCE
outside beside the house by our garbage fence. I called to him and he
disappeared. He is not really so mischievous nor is he malicious or
scary at
all...none of my family feel distress with him and we take him for
granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Well Shadow Lands,
since you
insist I type this I will do best to keep it short.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Some time pre-'94 I
was
travelling down Glenn Dale Road and had taken my eyes off of the road
momentarily to switch out and reload a CD. Not being familiar with the
road it
has swung to the right, however I continued straight because I was not
paying
attention!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When my CD started
to play I
then had turned my attention back to my driving and suddenly I had to
stomp my
brakes because I almost ran into the structure. I was truly disoriented
because
I had no idea where I was, how I got there, I had never been down this
road
before, and when I turned to back I could not indentify anything
remotely close
to allow my to figure my way out of where I had come to?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Suddenly I was
lost, not
scared, but disoriented because I could make out where I was and had no
idea
how I got here and it was maybe 10 seconds my eyes were off of the road
at
about 40 mph. Seconds later my car stereo completely shut down, puzzled
I then
opened my driver door to get out to marvel at this lovely structure, a
mammoth,
and it feels like a whole new world I have stumbled into... As I step
out of my
car, it cuts off on me, this too grabbed my attention and I did pay
both of
these strange happening mind, but caught up in the moment I just keep
staring
at the building in awe and amazement. What is this and where am I?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">SIDE-BAR: This was
before I could
afford a digital camera so I have no pictures of this, being an
explorer as a
youth myself and some close pals always were climbing through abandoned
building and homes and so I was not scared, I was excited, but still I
had no
ideal how I got there so this took me for a loop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On your website you
typed of
this thing called a radio, I have what you would call "a good radio"
as I walked around but remained close to me car, I could feel small
people not
around me, but in the windows looking at me, small people. I have never
detected a small person before. I can feel your size the size of your
manifested energy (I am so sorry if I am freaking you<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">out) but I can. I
can feel
everything, but these were small forms of energy, several small forms,
maybe 2
or 3 large were near, but in the windows were all small energy and they
were
looking at me. I could detect curiosity as if whom I was, none
questioned why I
came, just looking at me like a newcomer and wondering where I came
from
suddenly. I spoke, I spoke to all of those around verbally, I detected
no
upset, I apologized for my disrespectful entrance, I detected the
apology was
accepted and all was forgiven. I promised that if I ever returned
again, I
would not disturb them as I did before and I was not aware of their
being. I
went to then look over my car, I spoke aloud to all my new little
energies
quite happily and presented myself as a comfortable person and so no
upset with
my presence was detected I continued to speak aloud (not yelling) at a
normal
tone as I looked under my car, under my hood, I could find no reason
why my car
stalled, it was dealer maintained and this had never happened before?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">At the time I had a
competition car stereo built with all Alpine electronics, Ohio
Generator
alternator, Jacob's Accuvolt, Esoteric Audio/STREETWIRES, as well as
Audio
Control components and this car was fully prepped for IASCA events and
competed
under Circuit City's badge (at the time a local car stereo retailer)
this car
competed for 4 years. With all sponsors logos ON THE CAR this is why it
had to
stay garaged and when I did drive it and not for competing I could not
leave it
unattended for fear of theft of the entire car, this WAS a competition
car so
from that standpoint, THIS STEREO HAS NEVER SHUT DOWN AND TOTALLY
POWERED OFF
AND BLANKED OUT PERIOD, IT HAS NEVER DONE THIS I TRIED TO TURN IT BACK
ON BY
PRESSING THE KNOB TO CLICK, IT DID NOT POWER ON... Then I exited the
car and it
cut off too? It did not scare me, I just knew that I was playing with
something
strong or a heavily manifested power of many energies to do this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So I was correct!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">BACK-ON-TOPIC<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So after looking at
this HUGE
building and not having my 35mm, or my boys I said I would not enter
the
building. I did maintain constant 360 degree surveillance of my
position
because without my team, my cell phone, and my camera... Trust me,
where I was
and at that time this was the place where if somebody rushed up on you
and
killed you (like some dope addict, or sick person, NOBODY would ever
find you
once they dragged your body into the building and there was a few
garage-like
places where a person could raise a door and drive your or my small car
in
there and you could just disappear!!!! Like that! So I had to keep
constant
lookout on everything and stay close to my car and it was soooooo quiet
there.
A different kind of quiet, a flat-line quiet<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As I got back into
my car and
with my vocalism to all, I detected all were at peace with my presence.
I
actually desired to re-visit, but I was unable to. My car started up
just fine
and my radio turned back on like normal but it takes maybe 5 seconds to
go back
to the last volume level so I quickly turned it off to retain the
silence and
still kept my eyes moving and turned my car around and drove to reverse
the way
I got there and viola I was back on Glenn Dale Road! SWEET! Also this
happened
maybe between 2-3 pm in the afternoon on a weekday and on the side with
the big
smoke stack like brick chimney &amp; garage door next to it, I guess
this side
is called the crematory?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My only guess is
they did not
know whom I was, and why I came, but I did disturb them so they
accepted me but
did not care much for the extreme noise. I would love to re-visit, but
something happened and after that I just said forget it. If a group
ever plans
I could ask the authorities if this is possible to allow/permit people
to just
see the exterior maybe?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">when I first
stumbled on his
place I was new to the area. However it would be my normal route of
travel
because I lived and worked in the area called Greenbelt Maryland. Well
at some
point in the late nineties I was driving through there and had seen
SWAT, &amp;
DEA posted in the front lawn with guns, sharpshooters, and other posted
in
remote locations all around the one building that is closest to the
street but
on the same side as where I was but again the one small house-looking
like
building close to the street.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I heard rumored
about town
there were drug traffickers using this old building to store, process,
break
down, bag up drugs. Not sell it there, just using this place to store
and
process/prepare them and then at night move them out to distribute them
to
people to either sell or use?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">DEA got a tip, as
it was
rumored to me, SWAT got involved and so they planned a bust and it
happened.
From that point either government police or Maryland State Troopers set
up a
trailer like office on the opposing side of the street and have been
monitoring
ever since...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I cannot attest to
the truth
of that text above as I heard it through the vine regarding drug
dealers, but I
can attest to physically seeing the DEA, SWAT, sharpshooters, and other
government cars everybody in bullet proof vests w/helmets and vans all
around
that one building one day and actually they were there for maybe 8-10
hours
that day because I went through that portion of Glenn Dale Road several
times
transporting supplies back and forth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Like I typed before
I cannot
attest to the truth of drug activity in that small building because I
heard it
through the vine, but I did see SWAT &amp; DEA on the back of the
bullet proof
vests and they had that one building swarmed like bees and SWAT and DEA
will
not come out in those great of numbers to remove 5-6 hobos from a
abandoned
building so my guess is there is some truth to what I heard rumored?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">But from there and
after is
has and still does have a police trailer there with unmarked cars 1-3
at a time
there 24 hours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This did not happen
to me,
but to my mother-in-law and her cousin. To set this up for you, their
grandmother had just died a few months before, and my mother-in-law had
been
recently visiting her cousin in the country in southern Illinois. In
that area
of the country, some strange things had been happening. A hitchhiker
dressed in
dark clothes had been appearing, and after drivers picked him up, he
had been
disappearing from the car &#8211; things like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It all began with
the cousin,
Michelle, hearing strange noises in the house. She would hear noises
and see a
shadow figure outside. One night she came home from work and found a
pan with
onions in it on the stove. She had a cold, and she was startled to see
the pan
because her grandmother who had just died used to take the liquid from
cooked
onions as a home cold remedy. These kinds of things went on for awhile,
and she
contacted my mother-in-law, and asked her to come over to help her get
to the
bottom of things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The day my
mother-in-law
arrived was uneventful until the evening. They started hearing noises,
and were
going to leave. As they approached a window near the door, something
invisible
outside hurled itself at the window and scared them out of their wits.
They
stayed in the house, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my
mother-in-law said she knew in her mind that if she tried to get in her
car and
leave, it would have met her down the hill on the road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When my
mother-in-law went
home, she contacted a woman with contacts to the church about what
happened.
The lady came and gave her scriptures and prayers for her and her
cousin. She
confirmed it was not the spirit of her grandmother, but a non-human
spirit that
they had caught the attention of. She said once the entity is gone, do
not talk
about it, or it might come back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">on my dads birthday
my
grandmother gave him a statue of a knight on a black horse about 7"
tall
and it was made of cast iron my grand mother was in to witch craft and
Ouija
boards at the time. We lived in our house about 3yrs and everything was
fine
until that thing entered our house. my dad was proud of that statue and
put it
on his dresser. that night he woke up to see a 5ft black figure at the
foot of
his bed holding this statue, my dad was afraid and all he could do was
pray.
The figure put the statue down and walked out of the room. the next
night he
turned over in his bed to see this black figure standing next to his
side of
the bed and way to close to him so he kicked at it and it ran out of
the room.
(he never shared this info with us till later years). the next morning
he asked
me if I had been in his room, not knowing what he was talking about I
told him
no and he kind of looked at me strange and never said another word
about it. at
this time the statue was in the garage, i wondered why but never asked.
but
from there on weird things would happen our front door would swing wide
open
slamming against the wall for no reason no wind no matter what kind of
lock it
had on it, we went through several doors over the years. I would see
this dark
figure come in to my room at night and walk towards me as if it was
going to
harm me. it would bang on the walls and doors. We could here foot steps
run
through the hall and into my room. it wasn't until i moved out that my
dad
shared with me what he had seen and i told him my experiences my mom
hated to
talk about it. after i got married my wife and i ran into financial
trouble and
had to move in with my parents, i all ways spoke to my wife about the
weird
things that would happen in that house but i don't think she believed
me. one night
i was asleep on the love seat i had in my room while my wife and 1yr
old slept
on the bed when i got that feeling that i always got before something
crazy
would happen in that house, all i could think was I'm to old for this,
how can
this happen now my wife is here for crying out loud. Just then the door
flew
open and crashed into the wall and this black figure came into the room
stopped
and walked right out I stayed still looking down the hall way as it
exited I
stayed awake from 3am to 7am just watching the hallway hopping this
thing
wouldn't come back. at breakfast my wife asked me if my mom or somebody
came
into the room last night she had heard the door hit the wall and was to
scared
to look up. and i was so relieved that it wasn't just me who
experienced it. I
told her what it was and she was freaked out, needless to say we moved
out
within the month. I know she believes me now...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I must start this
(true)
story with a quick prequel: The house I grew up in the central valley
of
California was haunted. My mother, three out of six brothers, cousin,
and uncle
all experienced paranormal activity in the form of apiritions. The
house had
witnesses many<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">unfortunate
activities, all
of which my family was responsible for.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">To give you an
idea, there
was a time when alcoholism, drug addiction, abuse and basic moral
corruption
took place in the home. With that, my expirience occured when I was
17yrs old.
I was up at dawn getting ready for a cross country meet and my dad was
going to
take me. I was going to get some water and passed the bathroom where my
dad was
shaving his morning beard. As I passed my father and headed to the
kitchen,
something caught my attention in the living room. I turned to look and
saw this
massive dark figure sitting on the end of the sofa.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Because it was
dawn, the
living room was still cloaked in some darkness. The worst came when the
dark
figure called my name ( actually my nickname, what my family calls me).
I
suddently felt this horrible dread and fear engulf my whole body and
the hair
was standing straight up on my arms. I then ran back to my father to
see if he
was still in the bathroom, which he was. He and I were the only ones in
the
home ( by this time my mother divorced my dad and moved to a nearby
city). This
experience still haunts me because it was so frightening and
traumatizing. I
truly believe that when people behave immorally and destructively, they
are
capable of introducing evil spirits or negative energy in their home.
My father
still lives in this home, but he claims to never have experienced
anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Haunted Farmhouse
in Waseca,
MN<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This isn't the same
farmhouse
listed in your index; in fact, I don't even know for sure that anyone
realizes
it is (or was, I haven't been there in about twelve years) haunted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I don't remember
when we
moved to that farmhouse, but we lived there until I was about seven. It
was a
great place, for the most part. Our landlords lived right next door,
and they
loved us kids. They had cats and dogs and she grew gorgeous flowers. I
loved
it, and I had the coolest room with a huge closet and a set of shelves
on
either end of the closet the perfect size for a 5-7 year old and her
friends to
pretend were bunk beds and sleep on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">At first, the only
bad thing
about that house was the basement and the stair. The basement was where
the
laundry was, and it was the scariest basement I have ever been in. The
lights
were dim and liked to flicker, and no matter how much we cleaned it it
was
always dirty. I cried every time I went down there. It just had this
nasty
aura. Then there were the stairs. The stairs leading upstairs connected
to the
first floor living room, and were hidden by a door. They were narrow
stairs,
and at the top was a type of banister. My mom had a clown that she sat
there,
and to this day I won't look at it. While part of this is going to be a
little
girls imagination, I can promise that the evil feeling in that stairway
that me
and ALL my friends felt, was not. We always attributed it to that
clown, but
once we moved out of that house the clown lost it's evil feeling. It
was such a
feeling though that I won't touch that clown even now. While these were
daily
occurrences, nothing scared me as bad as two incidents: It was bedtime,
I was
about 6, and I was lying in my bed. My room was the first bedroom,
right next
to the stairs. As I was lying there, I noticed...something. There were
several
pink ballerina girls dancing on my dresser...but they weren't touching
it. They
were about the size of a figurine that you might have sitting on your
dresser,
but I didn't have anything like that on mine. I preferred cats and
horses over
ballerinas. Now, these girls didn't scare me so much, they seemed nice
enough.
But then a much bigger, life-sized on appeared in the air. She danced
and
twirled and wore blue. There was this aura of sadness around her,
terrible
sadness. And then it changed. It changed to fear and anger and evil,
and a
man-sized figure appeared, wearing a tux. He looked at me once, and
that was
all it took. I hid my head under the covers and prayed and cried. That
was the
only time I saw that man, but I saw the beautiful lady several more
times. I
never told anyone, because my parents didn't believe in ghosts and I
didn't
want my friends to stop coming over. One night, a friend was over, and
she had
to use the bathroom. The bathroom was across the hall, and she didn't
want to
go alone. It was always cold in there, we had a spaceheater in there
year-round. We opened the door and there was this huge, huge rat
sitting on the
tub, with mean little red eyes. We stared at it for a moment, and it
leaped at
us. We slammed the door and ran and told my mother. She came looking
for it,
but we never found it. The door was shut when we went to the bathroom,
and it
was shut when we left. There were no holes for a rat that size to get
into the
bathroom. From that night on, no matter how bad we had to pee, we
waited till
morning,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A few years ago I
was talking
to a friend of mine, and she mentioned that old farmhouse. We talked
about the
basement and the stairs and I told her the story of the rat (this was a
different friend) and she said, "I have something to tell you." She
told me the story of why she only spent one night at my house, and
never came
back. She recounted the story of the Ballerina Lady and her partner. It
was
exactly what had happened to me. The same feeling of sadness and fear
and
anger. She said that man made her think of the devil himself, and that
lady
made her want to cry. I'd never told this friend about what I'd seen
that
night, and she never told me until that day several years ago. None of
my
friends liked that house, and I am so glad we moved out soon after I
saw that
man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Description of
Haunting: The
English would describe this home as a semi-detached bungalow, Americans
would
call it a duplex. The neighbourhood is across the road from the
Wollaton Park
Golf Club. It is a quiet, established neighbourhood considered by some
to be a
better place to live in Nottingham. I lived there for two years in the
early
2000&#8217;s with my husband. Upon moving in, I soon felt spirits, especially
near
the front door and in the kitchen. I felt strongly that there was the
spirit of
an old man and his little dog that was usually in the foyer.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I often noticed him and his dog leaving for
walks. The living room had a clear view of the foyer. One night we had
guests,
six friends who had come over. We all sat around the dining table and
at one
point, everyone at the table who faced the view of the foyer noticed
someone
moving about there. We were asked, &#8216;Who was that in the foyer?&#8217; We&#8217;d
seen a man
with a little dog on a lead heading out of the front door. Our friends
were
convinced it was a living person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was afraid of
going into
the kitchen at night because there was the spirit of a man that seemed
to spend
a lot of time in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was dressed
in a long black coat and boots. There was a connection to an early
style
motorcycle; he may have ridden one in the military. He was of the World
War II
era. He was possessive about the kitchen, giving me the mental
impression that
the ground right there belonged to him. He did not try to intimidate
me, but he
had an air of strong masculinity about him. This spirit did not confine
himself
to the kitchen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once, as my husband
made a
repair to the floor at the front door, the spirit was there during the
whole
process, very curious as to what was being done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had a female guest who slept in the second
bedroom and reported having been awakened all through the night by a
man in
spirit; he wanted to make himself known. I spoke aloud after being told
about
the incident and asked that he please not disturb guests who sleep in
that
room. To my knowledge, after that incident, he did not make further
disturbances in there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The most memorable
incident I
had with that spirit happened late one night in my bedroom. My husband
and I
woke up and were in the midst of making love when at the same time we
turned
our heads toward the corner where the bedroom door was located. We were
certain
there was a man standing there watching us. We didn&#8217;t say much, but
realized no
one was actually there and continued our lovemaking. Within a few
minutes, we
felt a shocking, cold breeze pass between us, over our chests. We
looked at
each other, surprised by the sensation, but did not stop what we were
doing. I
instantly noticed my husband making love to me in a way different than
what I
knew, like it was not him. I felt I was having sex with another man, a
stranger. When we finished, my husband lay beside me quietly for a
little
while. I was still quite shocked by the sensation of a stranger. Out of
the
blue my husband said to me, &#8216;I know what you&#8217;re thinking, and it was
him.&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In 2002 my fiance'
shot
himself in the head in our townhouse. He had been severely depressed
and was
taking some medications which changed his personality and I knew there
was a
lot of controversy about these medications and did not like the thought
of him
ever taking them,but I didn't find out that he had been taking them
again(because he had stopped months earlier)until after he passed away.
I found
the almost empty bottle in the hall closet. He had told me months
earlier that
he hadn't needed them any longer because I made him so very happy and
he had
been since he had met me, he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was still living
in the
townhouse where he had shot himself. It took me awhile to get the nerve
to go
back,but I had to. I missed the place that we had gotten together and
the
memories we shared. I wanted to feel close to him again,so I returned
home. The
bloody mess had been cleaned up thoroughly except for a spurt of blood
on a box
near where he died,which was behind the couch near the front entrance.
When I
went back I felt this horrible deep ache in the pit of my stomach and
it felt
so dark,lonely and foreboding in the house now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was so very heart
broken
after his death and found it very hard to cope with. I basically shut
out the
outside world and became a shut-in for awhile while i grieved. I was so
grief
stricken. My kids who lived part time with their dad(full time while I
grieved)
came to see me sometimes,but I didn't want them to see me mouring so
much. I
wanted to wait until my mourning period was over. My family was very
worried
about me and I had been losing a lot of weight because I couldn't get
anything
past my gag reflex except water or juice or something,so my sister
would bring
me nutrition drinks by to make sure that I got some. One evening when
my kids
were over,I was laying on the end of the couch with my legs over the
end/arm of
it and my head kind of in the middle(i am pretty short) My daughter was
sitting
on the other end of the couch( it was a huge,long couch) and my son was
over on
the loveseat on the other side of the room. So we were watching tv
together and
I felt a hand brush across my forehead. I couldn't really see my
daughter
because my head wasn't really facing her,so I assumed she had reached
across
the couch and did it. I felt this several times and totally thought it
was her!
I said "Please don't touch my forehead anymore hon I am trying to watch
the show!" and she said "Mom I did not touch you on the
forehead!" I said "yeah right,please just stop!" and she started
crying and was very serious about having not touched me. I also looked
and she
would have had to reach way over to do it and she was way on the other
end and
I would have felt her move down by me to do it. I smelled cigarette
smoke all
of a sudden too and my fiance' smoked. I didn't allow smoking in the
house ever
at all. I kept getting these brushes across my forehead for months
after his
death and I figured it was an angel telling me that everything would be
ok
because I was so grief stricken and sick or that it was him letting me
know he
was still around and that he loved me and was checking on me to make
sure that
I was ok before he moved on maybe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One night nobody
was there
but me and I was drifting off to sleep in my bed upstairs and something
grabbed
my foot and tried to pull me down off of the bed toward the bottom! I
was
terrified!! I was stone sober and had not had any medication or
anything and
nobody was there but me! Later that week one night I was coming out of
the
bathroom upstairs into the dark hallway with just the downstairs light
and
outdoor lights lighting up the hallway and a dark figure floated
towards me and
would have ran into me had I not backed up into the bathroom doorway. I
didn't
feel that it was threatening to me though. I got this telepathic
message from
it letting me know that it was not there to harm me and was not there
for me
and it had gotten what it needed or something like that. It wouldn't
look right
at me and it was almost like it was afraid of me or afraid of my being
spiritual and believing in God. I knew that I had always felt protected
by God
all of my life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Months after I
moved out I
had about 120 pictures from various films developed at the local drug
store.
The pictures all turned out fine. Most of them were of the bay and
sunsets that
I had taken,but I took a few of our townhouse where my fiance' had
died. My
fiance' died right behind the couch near the front entrance. I took
pictures of
the house because I wanted them to look at later for memories sake. I
took
pictures of the bedrooms and kitchen and everywhere. I decided to take
pictures
of the front entrance also. I only took two of those. Out of every
picture in
that film only two(the ones that I took of the exact spot that my
fiance'
passed away)had flames shooting from the floor up into the air! It
looked like
the flames from hell I am serious! It looked like a portal to hell! I
still
have the pictures and get the heebie jeebies whenever I look at them!
Our
neighbors next door were devil worshipers and I was wondering if
maybe,just
maybe they conjured something up that got ahold of my fiance' that
night when
he took his life! I mean remember the dark figure I told you about also
and
something grabbing my foot in the bed?! I think something evil was
there in the
house. I felt that feeling of something dark when I went back that I
couldn't
put my finger on. I left about 2 months later,because I couldn't stand
it any
longer and just had to get out of there! It was a very opressing
feeling! It
made me have thoughts of suicide as well and that was not even like me
to do
that ever!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I don't know what
to make of
these things,but I know that they were real.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Months later my
sister passed
away and i almost perished from grief and weight loss. I always felt a
hand
patting me on the head for months after she passed. One day i felt that
I would
lie down and die I was so grief stricken,because she was my best friend
and we
were very close...In fact she helped me get through the grief from my
fiance's
death and she was there for me so much. I was so grateful to her for
that and
always will be. I got on my knees on the floor one night and felt the
life
almost leaving me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew I would lay
down and never wake up again! I begged God for strength and told him "I
can't do it anymore...I give up...I don't have the strength left to go
on!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">All of a sudden I
had the
strength of a thousand men it felt like!! I got up and I just knew it
was all
going to be ok. I didn't have any strength left in me so God gave me
his! I
know he did! I felt it in my body! I was on the verge of death I felt
it! I
felt him breath new life into me! He helped me cope after that and
things got
better and I got better. I miss my sister and fiance' dearly,but I know
they
are always watching over me. Once in awhile I feel a little brush
across my
forehead or on my head and I know. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">God wasn't ready to
take me
when I almost layed down to die. He made me get up and move on!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have seen a
couple of
ghosts in my life before that and since then. Once I saw a military man
in
uniform in my house years back and I also not long ago saw ghosts(white
mist-like forms) in my living room in an apartment where I lived that
used to
be a retirement home and tons of elderly people had died there. My
camcorder
was battery operated and would go on by itself and my burners would
turn on and
light bulbs would blow out for no reason and my tv and computer would
turn off
and on by themselves. After awhile it settled down because I am sure
that they
just wanted me to know that they were there,but they were not evil or
bad,but
good. I just felt it and knew it. So we lived together after that with
no
incidents after awhile. It is weird that I knew they meant me no
harm,just like
I knew that dark figure didn't. It's like they communicated
telepathically with
me to let me know. I wonder is that how everyone on the other side
communicates? That is what I have read about and have heard before. I
wonder if
it is true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I also have this
gift. I can
tell if someone has taken the life of another person. I just feel it. I
get
these horrible vibes off of someone who has. I know,because I got these
vibes
from a guy that I kept seeing and later got to talking to him. I always
felt
this overwhelming feeling that he had killed someone and found out
later that
he did. He was in prison for 6 years for involuntary manslaughter for
being in
a fight and hitting a man who was beating his wife. He hit the guy in
the
temple to hard and it killed him. He said he never meant to kill the
guy at
all. My mother said I have a "gift of discernment". I felt this
feeling only one other time about someone killing someone and I am sure
that
they did. It was that overwhelming! I get bad vibes off of people who
are very
evil as well and mean to harm others. It just gets very overwhelming to
where I
just know it to be true!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Thanks for reading
about my
experiences!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By :
st.brockwell@yahoo.com.au<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Although, I have
seen what
might have been a ghost, or felt something that might have been out of
the
normal. I never took any of this for real or even seriously, for that
matter
simply because if you think about it or even tell anyone what you saw,
they
would think you&#8217;re out of your mind or going nuts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">However, on one
particular
night all of my doubts were shattered, when I confronted something out
of the
normal, which brought me to realize that the paranormal does exists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It all started a
long time
ago, and we had just finished building are new house on a location I
don&#8217;t
really want to specify. Life was great I had a beautiful wife and a
daughter,
who I could be proud of just like any father would be. The years rolled
bye,
and soon we had another daughter, which was as to say full of woo.
However, not
long after that for some reason our marriage started to break down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Fights, arguments,
screaming
shouting you name it and it happened, until finally I left home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A
few months down the line, we both decided to
give it another go and I moved back into the house and it felt like
things were
all back to normal and we ended up having a son which completed our
family to
the full, until the arguments started all over again. I never suspected
that
this might have had anything to do with any kind of paranormal
influence, or
anything else for that matter until one Christmas we decided to hold
Christmas
dinner at our house. My sister asked me if she could bring her dog with
her for
the day. Well I loved that Labrador and said &#8220;yes why not&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">However, for some
reason the
dog that was normally quite a laid back animal, would not settle in our
house.
It kept on barking, running up and down the hall way and even
scratching at the
door, until my sister decided to take her dog back home. Even still
this never
brought anything to mind, I just thought that our marriage was on the
rocks
just like lots of marriages are; it seems that our house was just not a
happy
house full stop. Naturally our three children felt the tension within
our house
and I thought I would get them a cat, to go with the budgie and hamster
ECT.
Well as everyone knows kittens do bring some sort of happiness to the
children
and even to me. However, by this time our marriage had ended up in
court, but
we still remained living in the same house together until the final
judgment was
taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The months went by
and we
both did what we could to maintain<span style="">&nbsp; </span>some
sort of peace treaty between my wife and I, and even the children which
for
some reason always fought beteewn themselves. and as for the cat well
it grew
up to be like most cats, fat a lazy<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and
would sleep on my lap just to get warm. However, sometimes our cat
would be
asleep while we were watching television and for some reason would jump
up on
all fours and stare into the hallway. Her eyes would move as if they
were
following something but nothing was there. On several occasions she
would run
out of the room and dart down the hall way. I sometimes thought she saw
a mouse
and ran after it. Only there was nothing at all. This occurrence
started to
become more frequent, even though it never brought anything to mind,
that there
was something out there, which only our cat could sense or see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As the months went
by our
separation finally came through, and we put our house on the market and
found a
buyer just before the market started to crash, Which gave us a 6 months
period
before we had to all leave our beloved house and start a new life
apart,
something we were all looking forward to do however, that&#8217;s when things
started
to happen and showed me what was living with us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">November 2008,
winter was
approaching and a storm was brewing up. Late that night I woke up to
the sound
of a window banging down stairs in the bathroom. I decided to get out
of bed
just to close the window. I am not scared of the dark, and often walked
down
stairs without switching on the lights, like I did that night. As I
reached the
bottom stair, our cat came running across the hall way. She startled me
and I
said&#8221; shit&#8221; to myself. However, as I turned to face were she had run
from,
something caught the corner of my eye? A dark shadow moved into our
living
room! A cold chill went down my spine, at once I thought that an
intruder was
in our house and hit the light switch, only nothing was there. I search
all
down stairs only to find nothing or no one. I closed the window and
went back
to bed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The next day the
thought
dawned on me at what I was sure I had seen, but said nothing to no one.
A month
passed by and the arguments in the house got worse, however, when we
were out
of the house together, no one argued? A month had passed by since I had
seen
the shadow and I had almost forgotten about it, until one evening I
laid
restless in bed, tossing and turning. I glanced towards my bedside
clock and it
showed it was 3.30 in the middle of the night. I made one last attempt
to try
and sleep only it was pointless, and as I turned around in bed I saw an
oval
light lingering upon me. It looked like tinsel from a Christmas tree
twisting
and glowing, the whole thing was about 1 foot in diameter, within the
circle
was a shadow of a sunken face. I closed my eyes tightly just to make
sure I was
not dreaming, however, as I opened them the glowing circle with its
ugly face
was still there. I sat up in bed and rubbed my eyes, to no avail. This
thing
just stayed were it was, I was not afraid and gathered my strength and
shouted&#8221;
go away and leave us alone you do not belong here&#8221; and pushed my fist
through
the golden circle and almost at once it disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The next morning I
told my
now ex wife about the shadow and the thing on my bed, only see thought
I was
mad or seeing things. I later on phoned a friend of mine, a counselor
who works
within a religious pray group. For some reason he believed my story and
gave me
a phone number of a priest who deals with enteritis and demons? I could
not believe
what I was hearing here! the church knows about the paranormal and
ghost ECT.
What! This is crazy I said to myself. However, I never phoned anyone
because I
wanted to see more and I did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">From that night
onwards I
would wake up, in the middle off the night and walk around the house in
the
dark hoping to see something, only I saw nothing... Two weeks left
before we
left the house and by chance I woke up again late at night, and there
in the
corner of my room hovered the golden light. Only this time it was
twisted into
the figure of eight. I stared at it for a while as it just stayed there
as if
it was afraid to come closer. At the same time I glanced into the hall
way
since my bedroom door was open. To my surprise I saw the dark shadow
move
passed my bedroom door? What two ghost this could not be happening only
it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One week before we
moved for
good, and by this time the house stood nearly empty since we had move
most of
our furniture. The rooms sounded hollow, as we spoke and would echo
around the
house. One night my son only 11 years old came to my bedside and woke
me up
saying he had a bad dream. I told him to get into bed with me. Only
when he
looked up towards the ceiling he saw the round circle hovering there.
He
started screaming and I looked up and saw it as well. My ex came
running and
all of our house hold woke up wanting to see what was wrong. My son
told his
mother what he had seen. She looked at me and with her eyes she knew at
once
that what I had told her before was true. That night we slept in the
same
bedroom because by now everyone was scared except me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Two days left
before we moved
house, everyone was still afraid, to stay in the house and we did what
we could
to move out fast. Although, I knew there were at least two ghost or
spirits in
our house, none of them did anything to harm us so to me it was not a
big
problem. The next morning I woke up at around 5 o&#8217;clock in the morning
and went
into the kitchen and put the kettle on to make myself a cup of coffee.
I heard
the front door open, it was my eldest daughter 21 years old who had
just come
back from a late night out. She walked into the kitchen said good night
and
went off to bed. The kettle started to boil by this time and I tuned of
the
gas, stirred my coffee and tuned around to sit down and drink it. Only
when I
turned around I saw a young boy dressed in Carchi colored clothing sat
at the
table, holding his face in his hands. This young boy although did not
make a
sound but I could tell he was upset and crying. I stared at this
persons for
awhile then he vanished into nowhere. I felt sorry for this child for
now I
know why he was in our house; he must have lost his family years ago
and
adopted our family to be his own. Only we were living and he was not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
told my ex wife what I had seen, a tear came
across her eye, since she had lost her family at a young age and so had
I. we
both knew what this ghost child was feeling, why he was still here we
do not
know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">That day we moved
out of our
house which brought great sadness to us both. But it was time to move
on no
matter what. I often thought about what I had seen, and why this had
happened
to us. There was no way that this ghost child could have caused us to
argue and
break our marriage. Even so it was over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A week had pasted
since we had
left the house, the ghost child still taunting my mind. I am a family
man and
the thought of just leaving a child even though he was a ghost,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>made me feel guilty for some reason I do not
know. i still had the keys for our old house, since we still had some
boxes to
collect and the new owners were going to tear some of the house down to
do
renovations. So one night I decided to go back and face this child
ghost once
more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It
was around ten in the evening, when I
opened the door to our old house, it was silent and memories of our
children
playing and running up and down went through my mind. I walked into the
dark
corridor and stood there silently in the dark. Only I saw nothing. I
decided
that this was not going to work only before I left I shouted out&#8221; son
you do
not belong here. Its time you moved on and found your real family.&#8221;
Silence
prevailed. I walked back towards the front door and was just about to
close it,
but decided to take one more look into the hall way, hoping to surprise
something or someone. As I looked down the hallway a dark shadow moved
towards
the stair way. I walked back outside closed the door; I knew that this
was not
the child ghost, but some other spirit form, that I did not want to
confront.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Since
that day I never went back to the house
only during the day time. I have never seen anything else in my new
apartment
and nor has any of my family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to what
has become of the boy ghost I do not know. As for the dark shadow,
well! I
don&#8217;t want to know. My advice to anyone who has an experience similar
to mine
is, confront the spirit show it that you are not scared, it&#8217;s most
probably
more frightened then you are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

with long
brown blond hair looking through the window with the curtains blowing.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi it&#8217;s me again
Steven from
Malta. I hope I am not boring you with my stories? Well anyway the next
event
took place back in Malta when I was around 19 years old. We had been
living in
a big house, in a place called SAN Gwann. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It was during the
beginning
of summer, and we had only been living in this big house for just a few
months.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I shared a big room
with my
brother, and my bed was next to the window.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well living in a hot country naturedly I slept with the window
open to
allow fresh air into our bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One night I was
fast asleep
when out of now where I could hear something in my head telling me to
wake up
and to get out of bed fast. For some reason I woke up and rolled over
onto the
floor. At just that instant a big cockroach flew in from the window and
landed
onto my pillow? What woke me up?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A few weeks later,
again I
was lying in my bed late at night. I kept tossing and turning till
eventually I
decide to get up and go down stairs to make myself a cup of tea and
have a
cigarette. I was laying face down at the time. However, when I tried to
move I
could not. I mean I could not even move my arms or legs. It felt like
something
was holding me down I started calling to my brother who lay on a bed at
the
other side of the room... Although he was way out and did not wake up.
I used
all my strength to try and force myself out of bed only I just could
not move
an inch. I was scared like hell, and started to recite the, our father
and
prayed for him to help me. Suddenly I was free and jumped out of bed
and ended
up sleeping on the couch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I explained what
had happened
to my mother and the next few days a priest came to bless the house
with
incents. It so happened, the pre owners of the house had to boys and
the woman
had died in the house from cancer. After the blessing nothing else ever<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>happened again. Well not in that house
anyway???<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My name is Mark and
my family
had a ghost in our home when I was growing up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The home is located
in
Birmingham Al. My parents had the home built in 1965, about 15 acres of
wooded
area behind the house. Soon after moving in we noticed that the front
living
room windows would be open every morning, there were 3 of them. At
night I
would here a snap and apparently the window sash locks would unlock and
the
windows would spring open. My parents tried everything to keep them
shut but to
no avail. They even tried to put sofa cushions against the windows to
block the
air , only to find them back on the sofa the next morning and the
windows open
again. I was only 6 years old at the time and I didn't understand what
was
going on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Later when I was
about 9, a
terrible storm had scared me very late one night. My father and I were
in the
den waiting out the storm when a bolt of lightning lit the sky. I saw a
man in
the back yard walking to the left, but he was only ankles up. He had no
feet! I
yelled at my dad to turn on the lights but there was no man there. Dad
told me
not to worry about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">4 years later at
13, my first
real experience. My parents played cards with friends on<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>friday nights. Their daughter and I were
downstairs when behind her back, one of my toys moved from a shelf to
the left
in midair over to the right. The girl saw my face and asked what was
wrong with
me, I couldn't speak. She turned around to see the toy in midair and
screamed,
that is when it fell to the ground. We ran upstairs as fast as we could
to get
safe and tell our parents. Of course they thought we were nuts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My mom worked 1/2
days Monday
through Fridays. During summer breaks I was alone. One particular day I
had
gone to the basement and the door was locked when I came back up. I
went
outside to find an unlocked door but there was none. My neighbor had a
key so
she and I came back to the house to unlock the front door only to find
that the
front door was unlocked, I had just tried it! She really freaked out
and called
the police. They found that all of the exterior doors were unlocked in
the
house and there was no one inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Before my wife and
I married,
she would hate to be at my parents house alone. She heard noises and
felt cold
places and was always ill at ease. I always thought it was me but
apparently
not since she married me 24 years ago. She and I started talking about
the
weird stuff going on at that house and my daughters were listening to
it. My
parents moved out of state 13 years ago and for some reason my oldest
daughter
asked my Mom about the ghost. My Mom freaked out, to that point my
family just
knew there was something wrong but we at no time discussed it. Wow, I
only knew
of my experiences, the rest of my family knew of many more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One last thing. As
the
property was developed behind that house, they had to stop building a
road to
move a grave site. The land was a farm in the 1800's and was owned by
the
Jeffery Family. The last Jeffery that lived there was a sweet little 80
year
old lady that went to church with us. She lived in a truly old log
cabin with
an out house but with running water. I can only think that the ghost
was some
farm worker of that family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is as true as
I can
state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
