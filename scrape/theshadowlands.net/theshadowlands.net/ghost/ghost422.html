Son's Experience<br>
<br>
By: jmarin@lubbockheart.com<br>
<br>
My son is fourteen years old two years ago my husbands cousin committed
suicide shortly after, my son would see him at our house in our
bedroom.&nbsp; Actually it was our old bedroom we moved into a
different room in the house.&nbsp; I believe he was looking for my
husband.&nbsp; He and my husband were very close.&nbsp; They were
together everyday all the time they were inseparable.&nbsp; After his
death we noticed my son slept with his door closed and his television
on and with the volume up loud.&nbsp; When asked why, he told us one
night when coming out of his room into the hall he heard his dads
cousin calling to him my son turned and saw him in our old bedroom just
standing in a corner he would not come out into the hall.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My son saw him for several months, he would hear making noise but could
not make out what the cousin was trying to say.&nbsp;&nbsp; We told our
son not to be afraid because we knew that my husband&#8217;s cousin would not
try and hurt him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I, my son and my husband went into the
room that the cousin would appear in and my son explained to him that
he was scaring him with his presence and that if he had something he
wanted him to tell his dad to tell him in a dream.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has
been a year and my son has not seen or heard from the cousin.<br>

Buddy the Ghost<br>
<br>
By: oliviadf@cfl.rr.com<br>
<br>
Alrighty, first let's get this straight. I'm only 12, but I've had more
experiences with ghosts than a lot of adults have. I found your website
a while ago, and it inspired me to write my story. I'm writing this
with the help of my two cousins, who are 12 and 13. <br>
My house has either 4 or 3 ghosts. We're not sure. We think it may be a
family that lived here long ago, but we haven't confirmed it. <br>
First I'm going to start with my sister's room. It's the most
paranormal room in the house. My first experience happened when I was
brushing my teeth in the bathroom, which is located next to her room.
When I looked into the large mirror above the sink, I saw a little boy
staring back at me. I can't remember much of him, only that he was a
small boy about the age of 5. He wore old-fashion clothing and was
transparent, and he was staring at me with a blank face. Later, my
sister confessed that she had been seeing this same figure in different
spots in her room. I hadn't said anything to her about it, so there was
no way she could've said that just to freak me out. (which she would
have.) She told me and my mom that she sees this figure sitting on her
bed, leaning against her dresser, leaning against the wall, and leaning
against her buckets filled with toys from when she was younger. Lately,
my dog has been going into her room and will sit by the buckets of
toys, laying down, looking content as if someone is petting him. He
looks to be nearly asleep, almost in a trance. If I clap or stomp my
foot, he jumps and follows me out. <br>
Before I go on, I have to say that I'm writing bits and pieces of this
with my cousins at different times, about 10 minutes apart. This is
because we feel as if someone is following us from room to room, and at
times we feel an extreme presence so strong we run out of the room. We
have been feeling ungodly cold spots on the ground, next to us, as if
someone is sitting with us, ect., and we had one warm spot. I'm not
sure whether to think the warm spot is good or bad- comfort or the
devil.<br>
Back to the story. My sister's room has had many odd things happen to
it. Me and my other cousin, who's 10, once sat in there and asked if
there was anyone in there, and if so, please give us a sign. Sure
enough, seconds after I said that, we heard a faint tinkling, like a
windchime from behind the bed. Later, I went back in with my other
cousin, one who's helping me now, and the same thing happened.<br>
There used to be a decorative ball that was made of glass and was a bit
of a tye-dye with brown and red glass mixed in with the clear. It hung
from the ceiling. I went in one day(by myself- something you should
never do on a regular basis), and asked if anyone was in there.
Immediately, the orb (what I call the decorative ball) started spinning
wildly. Frightened, I said, "If there's anyone in here, please make the
ball stop spinning." Instantly, the orb stopped. I had a conversation
with the ghost, and figured out that it was the boy. He said he was
trapped in this house, and that there were other ghosts in my house
too. I couldn't ask who, though, because I was only able to ask yes or
no questions. I could fill up a whole page with things from that room.<br>
Next is my room. Nothing much has happened in there- only one major
thing. Me and my cousin were in there (yes, I have a lot of cousins)
and we were just kinda hanging out and talking. I was studying a poster
on my wall, (being my odd self) and suddenly felt something like a hand
shove me to the ground. My cousin was on the other side of the room,
and started laughing, assuming I had tripped or was just being weird.
When I sat up, I asked if anyone was in the room with me. A feeling of
overwhelming dread and darkness instantly hit me and, panicked, I ran
out of the room as fast as I could. My cousin told me she felt the same
exact feeling of evilness.<br>
My family room has had a few experiences. The first happened when my
sister and her friend went in there. They both said that they saw a
shadow out of the corner of their eyes and stopped. They looked around
the room, expecting to see me, trying to scare them. But nobody was
there. Then New Year's Eve, me and my cousin were sleeping in the
family room. When my cousin woke up the next morning, I was still
asleep (we had gone to sleep around 3 am seeing as it was New Year's).
She heard voices coming from the other room, where my sister and my
cousin her age were sleeping. She heard my sister's voice saying
anxiously, "Robyn...Robyn, come on, you have to wake up. It's time to
wake up." My cousin went into the room to talk with them since I was
still asleep, and found them both fast asleep. Then she went back in,
assuming it had been her imagination. Then as she sat there, she heard
them again, but couldn't make out what they were saying. She went back
in, and saw, again, that they were asleep. After that, when she sat
back down, she was gripped by a feeling of panic. Like a person was
standing over her about to kill her. She closed her eyes for a few
minutes, then it went away a bit. She looked back and there was nothing
there. Recently, the keyboard in there played a few notes by itself,
and the excercise ball we have was spinning with no one around.<br>
As I said before, I've had more encounters than a lot of adults. I
could fill up an entire book with all the odd voices and sounds I've
heard, but I'm condensing it. There's only one big experience with
voices- everyone I've had for a sleepover has said that they hear
voices by our pool, with like a bunch of adults were talking and
laughing. <br>
That's all I can say for now- maybe I'll send in another story soon. <br>

<br>
My father, sisters and niece lived in a house in Avon, MA. <br>
Before my sisters moved in, my father told me about one morning when he
was sitting at his computer and someone sneezed. He responded with the
typical "God bless you" and then realized no one was in the house; he
lived alone. (Odd.)<br>
My sister used to hear humming over the baby monitor all the time. At
first she thought maybe it was picking up reception from somewhere
else. But, then she'd notice that when my niece would cry, she would
hear kissing noises, and often times they would be followed by my niece
"cooing" in contentment. Sometimes she's hear the rocking chair
creaking, along with humming. She'd always go and see if my other
sister or father was in the room with my niece, and no one ever had
been.<br>
My niece was about 12-18 mos or so,&nbsp; when we were really thinking
she was having paranormal experiences. She'd constantly be looking away
from anything at all and say "Ooo, dee..." (But, it gets more
interesting...at least I think so)<br>
One afternoon while we were putting her down for a nap, we turned off
the ceiling fan, since it was chilly. When we went in to check on her,
the fan was on. We thought we were losing our mind. We turned it off
and went down stairs. Then my other sister went in to check on her and
the fan was on. She turned it off and came to ask us why we had it on,
it was chilly? We told her we turned it off twice. So, we took the
remote control which was the only way to operate the ceiling fan, and
be turned the fan off and brought it down stairs. Low and behold, 30
minutes later the fan was on. <br>
I don't care what you do with this story, or whether you believe it or
not. It's hard to explain it as good via email. The point is WE know
what has gone on...so I just thought I'd share.<br>
Again...just thought it was interesting!<br>
God bless and happy Independence Day!!!<br>

Harry the Ferret<br>
<br>
By: michael.j.norton@teradyne.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me start by saying I've had lot's of things happen over my 40 years that have left me scratching my head.<br>
My Grandmother was very sensitive to things and she definitely passed
that trait to my mom who then shared it with my sister and I.&nbsp; But
of all the things that have happened around me I can honestly say that
I've never seen a ghost,<br>
that is until Harry died.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry was a sable&nbsp; ferret, I picked him up as<br>
a kit from a guy who was breeding them<br>
illegally and had them all in a small cage in the back of his pet shop.<br>
To make a long story short&nbsp; at age 9 he got very sick and could no
longer stand on his hind legs, I carried him that way for weeks till
one day when his breathing became labored and I knew he was on his way
out.&nbsp; I bathed and dried him and put him in bed with my wife and I
wrapped in a towel.&nbsp; Sometime during the night I could feel him
jumping around on the bed ( ferrets do this crazy hop / dance when
they're happy ) and could also hear his soft kind of a happy chortle
like muffled bark.<br>
Back and forth from me to my wife he jumped till I remember yelling out
loud&nbsp; " Jo honey grab him he's gonna fall off the bed ".<br>
My wife never woke up and&nbsp; Harry was still between us wrapped in
his towel.&nbsp; I thought it was just a dream and went back<br>
to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I woke up in the morning the first thing I see when I open<br>
my eyes is my wife in bed with her back to me and<br>
laying over her shoulder and upper arm&nbsp; is Harry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; remember having a<br>
brief surprise and then I locked eyes with him for<br>
what seemed like a minute&nbsp; ( actually&nbsp; about 7 or 8 seconds ) .&nbsp;&nbsp; He was<br>
plump,&nbsp; healthy and solid looking, not filmy or a<br>
partial figure but very solid looking.&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled and after a couple of<br>
seconds he slowly faded out.&nbsp; It always makes me laugh that after
a lifetime of strange happenings the most concrete evidence I can point
to came in the form of a little ferret.<br>
But I'm still glad it happened.<br>

3 Short Stories<br>
<br>
<br>
By: DTotten@mariccollege.edu<br>
<br>
<br>
My father died on September 17th, 2001. Unfortunately, he and my mother
divorced when I was 5 and I was never very close to him (I am 37 now).
After he died, we had a very small impromptu ceremony for him,
scattering his ashes in the garden of the Veterans Cemetery in Westwood
California. I was covered with guilt; I should have been there more for
him, gotten to know him better, etc. A few weeks pass and I am asleep.
All of a sudden, I am pulled up to a seated position by a mystical
force and my arms are forced out (like I am going to hug someone).
There is my dad, appearing at the foot of my bed, smiling. I couldn&#8217;t
hear anything except what sounded like hurricane winds through my ears.
My dad said nothing but spoke to me in my head. He said, &#8220;It&#8217;s Ok.
Don&#8217;t feel bad. I love you. It&#8217;s Ok.&#8221; Then, he disappeared. I looked
around and everything was normal. It was 3:30 am. I was awake, not
dreaming. I was then flooded with warmth and good feelings for my dad.
I then thought if it was a dream, which I am 100% positive it wasn&#8217;t, I
even tried to &#8220;fall back asleep&#8221; to make it happen again. It didn&#8217;t and
I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I woke up my wife and told her what had happened. <br>
My daughter had a near-death experience. We found her face down
floating in the pool. We pulled her up and revived her. She was down
for about 60 seconds and is perfectly normal, thank God! Get a pool
fence people! Anyway, that happened when she was two and she is now
four. About three months ago, my wife was washing dishes and my
daughter says to her, &#8220;mommy, my angel is very pretty&#8221;. She then
describes her angel as having blue eyes and long blonde hair. My wife
asks how she knows this and my daughter says, &#8220;she was playing with me
will I was under the water!&#8221;<br>
My son is now six but one day when he was two he was laughing
hysterically. I asked him what was so funny. In between the laughing he
managed to say &#8220;the guy&#8221; and pointed to the corner of the room where
the wall meets the ceiling. I said, &#8220;what&#8217;s up there buddy?&#8221; shooting
my wife a look. He then calmed down and took us into his room and
pointed to a picture of my grandfather, who had died a week after my
father died, September 2001. <br>

My Grandmother's House<br>
<br>
By: nkh1995@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My grandmother's house had always suposidly been haunted.&nbsp; My father<br>
and his seven brothers and sisters lived there and had all experienced<br>
paranormal activity.&nbsp; There are many legends concerning the street where<br>
the house is.&nbsp; Suposidly there used to be a cemetary underneth the<br>
street, which is why so much has been going on there.&nbsp; My cousin had<br>
experinced a glowing orange light, moans, and whispering in my father's old<br>
bedroom.&nbsp; This story has been told countless times by both himself and<br>
my father.&nbsp; My aunt experienced something coming from up in the attic;<br>
footsteps and groans have been heard by everyone who has came to the<br>
house. In my father's bedroom, late one night he heard something<br>
scratching the side of his beed.&nbsp; At the time, he had a cat, and thought it was<br>
just him.&nbsp; He looked down to see that nothing was there and the cat was<br>
asleep in the living room.&nbsp; The whole house has a sense of forboding<br>
about it, and even as a young child when I visited, it didn't feel<br>
comfortable.&nbsp; When you went into the basement, you had a feeling of<br>
being watched.&nbsp; The house has since been renovated and bought out by my<br>
cousins, who have two small children.&nbsp; The new homeowners have reported<br>
their children pointing to things that arn't there, and all of the same<br>
things my aunts and uncles have reported seeing.&nbsp; I can't explain<br>
anything there and know that it is a haunting, because of all the<br>
unxplainable occurances.&nbsp; thank you. -<br>

Haunted School <br>
<br>
By: ghosthunter61288@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I have 5 experiences with ghosts in my life&nbsp; all of them taking
place at my middle school. My first experience was when I was in 6th
grade and about 12 years old. I was walking to lunch when my friend
said lets take the "haunted staircase" being an extreme skeptic a made
fun of him a little but agreed to go. We started to descend the
staircase and every thing appeared to be normal until I heard the
disembodied voice of a woman I was unable to make out the words but my
friend and I ran down the staircase as fast as we could and stopped
halfway down the hallway to catch our breath. I asked my friend if he
heard the voice and he said yes. <br>
About a month later I had my second experience it was in the school
cafeteria this time, that day there was a book fair in the cafeteria
and there were books placed on and on top of the book shelf. I was one
of the few browsing when a book on top of a bookshelf with no one near
it flew off and hit the ground. <br>
My third experience occurred at the same staircase as my first I was
walking up the staircase alone when a heard a loud bang it sounded
somewhat like a gunshot but I was sure that somebody else definitely
could have heard&nbsp; when I got up the stairs and asked on of my
friends who had a locker near the stairwell if he heard the loud bang
he replied no and I felt confused because I was sure he if anybody
could hear it considering the hallway was all most silent at the moment
I was also frightened because learning that my friend did not hear it
made me feel like the ghost was picking on me.&nbsp; This was my last
experience until two years later when I was in 8th grade my fist
experience that year may&nbsp; or may not have been a ghost but it
occurred in a classroom and the closet door opened by itself the reason
I'm not sure on this one is because my teacher had said earlier that
year that the closet door had a faulty hinge. <br>
My final and most frightening experience occurred later that year&nbsp;
in a classroom down he hallway from the one where I had an experience
earlier that year. In this classroom the desks where in rows and the
teacher's desk was at the front of the room. On the teacher's desk
there was a stack of papers a grade book and a small decorational glass
bird. At the time of this experience my class and I were busy doing
work and my teacher walked to the back of the room to call the office
because a student had just been thrown out of class I looked up from my
paper and a shining object caught my eye and I realized the glass bird
statue had levitated of the desk for&nbsp; a few seconds and then hit
the ground very hard and shattered as if it&nbsp; was thrown
intentionally the sound&nbsp; obviously startled my teacher and the
rest of the class. My teacher then asked if every one was alright and
if we knew how it happened no one knew except me and&nbsp; I knew no
one would believe me so I said nothing. The only person I later told
what happened was my friend that&nbsp; I mentioned in my first
experience. <br>
Over the course of years these events occurred I tried to find out why
my school was haunted and i found an article in the school newspaper
the article was about the construction of the school it&nbsp; mentioned
that the school was constructed on a piece of land the formerly was the
site of a hotel called the Mandeville Inn. It mentioned that when the
building was being converted into a school a construction worker had
found a human corpse in one of the rooms. My friend also asked a
teacher if he had heard any thing about the building being haunted and
the teacher said he heard rumors about a hauntings and he said the
ghost was nicknamed "The Mandeville Ghost"<br>
I am now a senior in high school&nbsp; and I have not had any
experiences with the supernatural after my last experience in eight
grade but I am eager to have more experiences in the future<br>

AFB Story<br>
<br>
By: anonymous<br>
<br>
I am in the Air Force and have been for a while.&nbsp; Most Air Force
bases, especially the old ones, are haunted.&nbsp; I haven't been to
one installation belonging to the Armed Forces that didn't have some
type of activity.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy reading these.<br>
At my home station, it is said that if you go out to the East side of
base you can see the ghost of a man that was killed.&nbsp; I have seen
him standing next to the perimeter fence on the outside looking for
something.&nbsp; He was driving down the road that is adjacent to the
fence when he lost control of his car and it started to do end over end
flips until the car landed on base on trails that we drive on to check
the fence.&nbsp; His body was ejected from the car on the outside and
he was discovered later on by an SF patrol, approximately 3 in the
morning.<br>
There is a hangar on the flightline that we believe to be haunted, so
most of us don't really like it very much.&nbsp; One summer night, my
partner and I&nbsp; were riding around decided to see what all the talk
was about.&nbsp; So we pulled up to the big doors on the front side of
the hangar, put the car windows down, and turned off the car and
waited.&nbsp; As we sat there, my partner started to get a little jumpy
so I looked in the rearview mirror and saw to dark figures at the back
of the car with their hands on the trunk lid.&nbsp; The ghosts gave me
the impression that they did not want us sitting there.&nbsp; It felt
to us like they were trying to push our vehicle into the hangar,
however we were not moving.&nbsp; As my partner started to hit my arm
and shout that we needed to leave, something whispered to me through
the open driver's side window "GO AWAY."&nbsp; It was stern and
terrifying.<br>
That flightline is terribly haunted at night.&nbsp; Headless bodies,
bodiless legs, and mists can be seen and a variety of noises can be
heard.&nbsp; Full body apperitions have been seen walking around, and
when patrols go to investigate, no one is there.&nbsp; There really is
no possible place to go.<br>
For some reason spirits are drawn to me, and most of the time I can see
them.&nbsp; There is a ghost on the flightline that only shows himself
to people that believe in ghosts and is usually pretty funny.&nbsp;
When we do silly things people that can see him often say that he is
laughing right along with us.&nbsp; He also likes to manipulate the
vehicle controls of the vehicle you are driving down there.&nbsp;
Nothing overly dangerous, he'll step on the brake or the gas, or he
might even turn the stering wheel.<br>
There are a ton more, but I will have to put those in another e-mail.<br>

Gary Black Oak<br>
<br>
By: raven1976@comcast.net<br>
<br>
I would just like to state that the house mentioned in the black
oak&nbsp; story was my fathers property.&nbsp; Still is although the
home was torn down in 1996.&nbsp; I wanted to point out several missing
parts in the story.&nbsp; I do not know who posted the original story
on your site perhaps someone who rented it from my father.<br>
Back in 1905 the house was built where now stands interstate
I-80/I-94.&nbsp; When the highway was expanded the home was relocated
500 feet&nbsp; back to where it stood until it was tore down by my
family.(For the record the home had a third story but it was
structurally damaged in the move.)<br>
In the 30&#8217;s the home was notorius for ladies of the night to bring
their gentlemen callers&#8230; it also contained a bar as well in the
basement along with what appears to me to be shower type rooms. Story
has it that one of the gentlemen callers got upset with a lady and
killer her&nbsp; in one of the upstairs rooms.&nbsp; Her screams
brought one of the bouncers up from the basement stairs when he opened
the door the now fleeing man slit his throat on sight and continued to
run off&#8230;its unknown if he was ever caught.<br>
In the 60&#8217;s a woman was murdered in the home by her husband and walled
up in the dinning room wall.&nbsp; Eventually police found her,,
unfortunately the man was gone.<br>
My family resided there most of the 70&#8217;s but like many others did not stay for long. <br>
In the 1980&#8217;s my father rented that home out to several people all of
whom only stayed at the most a few months before leaving the
home.&nbsp; One family in particular only stayed 2 months when my
father went to collect the rent they were gone but their possessions
still there except for small amounts of clothes and personal type
things.&nbsp; I remember having to clean all their things out.&nbsp;
One old woman actually went as far as to board the upstairs off saying
&#8220;there is bad things up there&#8221;.&nbsp; I believe my father kicked her
out for this because he did not believe in ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have
seen several things in the home including strange lights that would
appear out of nowhere and shadows dancing down the staircase
walls.&nbsp; My brother had one of the upstairs bedrooms and told me
stories of how a man would turn off and on his fan and open and close
the windows.&nbsp; My mother experienced being locked in her bedroom
after the door was slammed shut by seemingly no one.&nbsp; Numerous
people have been pushed down the stairs&#8230; all of which will say the same
thing.&nbsp; They would feel something between their shoulder blades as
soon as they stepped on the second stair.&nbsp; A little boy who lived
there was pushed as well and suffered a severe neck injury as a
result.&nbsp; I myself experienced this unfortunately on several
occasions.&nbsp; <br>
My father eventually changed his mind on the matter when one day he was
pulling up a rose bush&nbsp; from the front yard of the now 3 years
abandoned home.&nbsp; One minute he was digging next thing he&#8217;s in the
car saying we&#8217;re leaving.&nbsp; He stated that an old man came to the
living room window and told him to &#8220;get the hell away from that
bush&#8221;.&nbsp; A couple years later we tore down the home which had
become in major disrepair,&nbsp; it actually sounded as if it were
screaming as it came down.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t been back since but many
accidents occur on the interstate in front of the home showing that the
house doesn&#8217;t need to be there for the spirits to remain.&nbsp; I
believe this home just had so many bad things happen in it eventually
it just had a bad aura and a life of its own.&nbsp; You would literally
feel drained after leaving the house, several people who knew nothing
about the home would say how they felt like they were exhausted after
leaving the home.<br>
Anyways just thought I would share my version of the story, this coming
from the daughter of the man who owned the property for more than 35
years, and who still owns it.<br>

Dominican University Hauntings<br>
<br>
By: abovetherestdesign@mac.com <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My name is Craig and I am currently a student at Dominican University.
I was looking through the website when I saw that there is a little bit
on "Blue Boy" and I would like to tell of my experiences with him. I
myself have never seen wet footprints in the house, I have witnessed
doors opening and closing by themselves and even locking people out of
the rooms. Our bathroom doors are lockable on each side. So if I was in
the restroom I could keep my suite mates from walking in on me. Some
days, I would return to the room after class and my suite mate would be
pounding on the door to let him into the bathroom. We didn't lock him
out. My roommate and I didn't even use that bathroom that morning. We
had no explanation for why the doors simply locked themselves. A week
or so later, my roommate and I we just hanging out in the rooms when I
heard the door unlatch. I jumped a bit and told Liam to look at the
door. The handle turned and the door swung open really fast then
slammed shut. As soon as it closed it re-latched itself. We were so
freaked out that we left room 52 until later that night.<br>
Now all of that happened in room 52.&nbsp; That isn't even in the
haunted part of the house. This coming year (07-08) I will be living in
room<br>
45 which was originally Blue Boy's room. There I will be expecting more
and I will write you guys and send what ever findings I get. As for the
attic where Blue Boy was drowned, it is locked off. I have sat in the
supposed tub but they say that the attic is just too structurally
unsound. But a few years ago they had a priest stay up there and after
just one night, he refused to ever return to the house.<br>
Also, the library is supposedly haunted and Angelico Concert Hall is very haunted. I will let you in on more in the future.<br>

By: mancusor@cox.net<br>
<br>
I have had many ghost encounters but I want to write you about the most
recent. My grandpa died recently on Novemberr 12, 2006 at 3:33 P.M.
exactly.<br>
Every day at 3:33 P.M. my alarm goes off playing old, sad songs. One of
them was I Miss You. Thats not all though. In the middle of the night<br>
I feel a chill and and a slight touch against my face. When I wake up,
though, there's no one there and when I look at the clock its 3:33.<br>

Ghost of Best Friend<br>
<br>
By: manservantjoshua@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Just wanted to share one of my most profound encounters so far. My best
friend Daniel and I have known each other since we were about 7 years
old (I'm 29 now) and he was like another brother to me. In the winter
of 2000 he lost his mother to liver disease and had several serious
issues with his ex-wife that led him to commit suicide in January of
2001.<br>
To say the least it completely tore me up as I had spoken to him on the
night he did it and he said all was well, then the anger set in after
the shock of the news hit me. It was about 2 weeks after the funeral
and I was still having trouble sleeping, would wake up at random
intervals, toss and turn, etc.<br>
I had just gotten settled and about to go back to sleep when I "felt"
something in the room...I could see someone at the foot of my bed and
grabbed my glasses from the nightstand, thinking it was my mom dropping
in to check on me. As I was putting on my glasses I recall thinking
that it was awful early for anyone to be up (sun was just starting to
peek through the window) and when I got my eyes focused, there was
Daniel, standing there looking at me.<br>
Suprisingly, I didn't freak out, I just sat up and looked at him. I
remember the shirt he was wearing...it was bright orange, but I swear
the thing was made out of light, not fabric. At that point he just
smiled at me and pointed his finger towards the window. I turned to
look at what he was pointing at but when I looked back, he was gone.<br>
I have felt him around since then and seen him on one other occasion,
but that was the most vivid experience I have ever had, and there have
been a few paranormal experiences in my life.<br>
Thank you for letting me share and I hope you will post this on your
site. Feel free to include my e-mail address as I love to hear other
peoples' experience with ghosts and the paranormal.<br>

Ghost or Not<br>
<br>
By: graemii@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
While traveling in Maryland, Thursday June 21st in the evening maybe
about an hour before dusk, my friend and I saw "someone" who could
possibly be a ghost.&nbsp; We saw a black man in green pants with a
plain green ball cap on and what looked like a very light green (almost
white) buttoned down shirt on the side of the road standing with his
hands behind his back looking directly at us.&nbsp; We were driving at
a slow enough speed to see him look at us but at the time neither of us
commented on it.&nbsp; We continued driving a few miles down the road
looking for the Old Trinity Church in Church Creek, Maryland that was
built in 1690.&nbsp; We had to stop on a little side road to ask for
directions and when we turned around and headed back out to the main
road we saw the same black man in the same clothes!&nbsp; We both saw
him standing across the road from us with his hands behind his back and
he was looking directly at us!!&nbsp; We both felt chills and a really
strange, creepy feeling.&nbsp; We made our turn and drove off.&nbsp;
The reason we feel he might have been a ghost is that we can't figure
out how he got there before us when we had seen him miles back and plus
the fact that where he was standing there wasn't really anything around
so if he had hitch hiked or something why was he just standing there
looking at us?&nbsp; And why would he want to be "dropped off" in that
spot when there was no one else around at all.&nbsp; It was very, very
strange.&nbsp; Thankfully we didn't see him anymore.&nbsp; What was
really weird and coincidental was the fact that shortly before we had
seen him the first time, we had been talking about ghosts and I had
been saying that I wanted to see one!&nbsp; Maybe I got my wish.<br>

My Imaginary Friend<br>
<br>
By: roberta.kahl@us.army.mil<br>
<br>
When I was about 5 I developed an imaginary friend called david
mitchell. The only problem was he was mean. And when I say mean I mean
just that! He would push me down the stairs, I would end up with
handprints on my body and they were always little hands. Everything
would happen when we were upstairs playing in the bedroom on the west
side of the house. My mom thought I was hurting myself for attention. I
kept telling her it was David Mitchell. She would say "tell him to go
away and leave you alone" and I would respond with, "I can't he hurts
me even more when I say that." She was working one night and the nurse
she was working with lives a couple miles down the road from us, and
her family had been in the area for a really long time. My mom started
talking about how I was hurting myself for attention and blaming it on
my imaginary friend named David Mitchell and she was going to have to
take me to a child psychologist to see why. And Peg said, "Oh Joanie,
don&#8217;t you know there was a little boy out in that area that had died of
pneumonia when he was around 5 or 6." My mom believes in everything
supernatural but she just brushed it off and didn&#8217;t think it could be a
ghost. Well I eventually outgrew my imaginary friend and I don't really
have any kind of memory about when he left, I had honestly forgotten
about him until I did a research project my senior year for English. A
group of my friends and I went around to several haunted places in
Indiana, and did a report on them. There's an old cemetary across the
creek from my parents house. And just driving past it one night on our
way home from another haunted place, one of my friends wanted to stop
and take some pictures to see if we could catch anything on film.&nbsp;
I walked in the cemetary and was drawn to this one headstone for some
reason, I didn&#8217;t stop walking till I got to a head stone a couple of
rows into the cemetary. When I looked down and shone my flashlight on
it I could make out the name, David Mitchell. From the dates on the
headstone I could make out that the person burried there was 6 years
old. Needless to say as soon as I saw the name I instantly thought
about my imaginary friend who had been so mean. I couldn't believe it,
I had to get out of there. I sat in the car the whole time everyone
else took pictures. There's something in that bedroom at my parents
house, I had to move downstairs to another bed room when I was a
sophomore in high school because I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I would just sit up
in bed and look around because it sounded like there was someone
playing on the floor. Well my little brother stays in that room now.
(I'm 21 now so everything happened to me WAY before my brother was
born, we're 16 years apart) He's 5 and won't stay in his room by
himself. Won't play in it, Nothing. If one of our parents are upstairs
in their room he's ok but he will not go upstairs alone. The other day
my mom and him were cleaning his room and my mom decided to take a
break and have a cup of coffee, and told my little brother she would be
right back up. He told her he didn&#8217;t want her to go because he wanted
to play and if she went downstairs he would have to go too. When my mom
asked why he couldn't stay by himself he said he didn't want to, she
asked him why and he said he was scared of his room. She asked him why
again and he said because of the little boy ghost and the girl ghost.
Now my little brother is VERY sensitive, my mom won't even let him
watch casper because it scares him. And when she told me I asked if
they had watched something about ghost or something like that recently
and my mom said that all he's been watching is power rangers and
digimon because he just had his tonsil's taken out. So far he hasn't
said any names, just that a little boy ghost and a girl ghost come and
play with his toys. My mom is going to wait til he brings it back up to
talk to him about it, but I'm really really curious as to whether it's
David Mitchell or not. I have a bunch of other stories that I will
share later, but thank you for taking the time to read this one.<br>

Route 47 Lisbon IL<br>
<br>
By: khauge15@jjc.edu<br>
<br>
<br>
I saw driving home about two hours ago ,and it's hazy and hot here in
Illinois with a full moon tonite. Just as turned around a curve a
figure( I only saw legs) crossed the road and disappeared in the middle
of the road. At first I really did believe it,but after like a minute
or two, it really hit me. I got to my friends and he was telling me
that other people have seen the same thing. One saw a full figure
smiling as she drove up to it. Lisbon IL is a small farming and mining
town about 60 miles southwest of Chicago. Route 47 is a state highway
that is extremly busy during the day. I believe the ghost is the spirit
of a young man that was killed in a motorcycle accident about two years
ago. His cycle was hit by a semi truck.&nbsp; The accident took place
on the turn of Rt. 47 and WhiteWillow Rd. This is the first time I was
it and I plan on more trips late at nite on Rt 47.&nbsp; <br>

The Blue Light<br>
<br>
By: d.doucet@ns.sympatico.ca<br>
<br>
This is an experience I had which probably happened close to a year and
a half ago. My husband and I were home one evening watching tv in the
living room. All of a sudden, in the next room which is the dining
room, there was a HUGE flash of bright blue light that lit up the
entire dining room. A couple of seconds later it happened again, and
only lighting up the dining room. I got up and went to the entrance of
the dining room. At the time, we temporarily had a small tv in the
dining room where my stepson had been playing Xbox. This tv, which had
been turned off, was now turned on. The rest I will explain to the best
of my ability. Something then caught my attention. Close to 5 feet away
directly in front of me and up towards the ceiling, there was a "blue
ball of light" around the size of a football. (This whole incident
didn't even startle me as it was happening.) I stood there silently
staring at it as it hovered motionless. It did not move as it sat
there, yet I swear it had some sort of energy, it was almost pulsating.
After about 20 seconds of staring, it then "shot" down across the room
and into my kitchen. It moved VERY quickly, and didn't move in the same
shape of the ball. It was at that time more of a blue beam that shot
down and into my kitchen. It shot all the way across my kitchen, and
when it reached the floor it then started (for lack of a better way to
describe it)emenating. It was still blue, about 2 feet wide and 4 feet
high, and just started moving like a hazy smoke. At this time, I looked
away from it, went back to the living room and told my husband. We both
went to the kitchen right away, and there was nothing there. My husband
wasn't with me when this all took place, but he did see the 2 flashes
of bright blue light which took place first. I also find it strange
that as this was happening, it didn't strike me as anything weird as I
was watching it. My husband was just around the corner and I didn't say
anything right away. About 2 months later, I was upstairs in my house,
and I witnessed the bright blue flash of light upstairs. When this
happened, I went straight downstairs. I wasn't scared of it the first
time it happened, but I didn't want to see it again while I was alone
in the house. Other than this, the only other thing that happened was
during a sunny spring morning. My stepson and I were in another room in
the house, and the room went black for a couple of seconds. It turned
completely dark and black for a couple of seconds. I was going to
pretend it didn't happen, but immediately after it happened my stepson
asked me what it was. I told him the light bulb flickered, (even though
the light wasn't on, and the bright sunshine was coming through the
windows and lighting up the house.)<br>
If anyone has had a similar experience, or has any comments, please email me. Thank you. d.doucet@ns.sympatico.ca<br>

Western State Hospital<br>
<br>
By: plain_terri04@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I worked @ Western State Psychiatric Hospital in Fort Supply Oklahoma
for 6 months as a relief dispatcher. I worked 3 different shifts.&nbsp;
The office I worked from was located in the Berry Building.&nbsp; I
hated the night shift most of all....I heard stories about a ghost that
haunted Berry hall that they called George from the other
dispatchers.&nbsp; They said "just tell him to leave you alone and he
will." I really didn't take them seriously until things started to
happen shortly after I started.&nbsp; A phone rang in a hall across
from my office late at night, when no one was working that I did not
patch through, the administrative office was teaming with noises late
at night like knocks, old heavy wooden chairs being pulled across the
tile floor, and faint inaudible voices.&nbsp; I could hear keys being
jingled down the dark halls, even the head of security heard
that.&nbsp; I called security on more than one occasion to check out
noises that freaked me out, needless to say I kept them busy!&nbsp; I
was watching TV one night and the room got cold all of a sudden and
goosebumps came up all over me. I felt what seemed like a light cold
touch brush my neck, I looked around, nothing was there.&nbsp; The
security guard came over on his usual rounds and we went outside to
smoke a cigarette to calm my nerves.&nbsp; I was facing the building
with the door open so I could hear the phone. The window in front of me
was the same one that the phone rang unmercifully until the security
guard turned his key in the lock, then it quit.&nbsp; Out of the corner
of my eye, I caught something pulling down one of the louvers in the
mini blind to look at us!&nbsp; I screamed for the security guard to
look.&nbsp; He didn't see it.&nbsp; I went over to look at the blind
and the dust on the blind was disturbed and I saw what looked like
fingers imprinted on the dusty blind where I saw it being pulled
down.&nbsp; I was so glad that my temporary position ended shortly
after that.&nbsp; The dispatch office has been moved since then to
another building and that building was closed.&nbsp; I WONDER WHY?!<br>

The Rosary <br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
Saturday night I was at San Juan Mission for a concert under the stars
having a great time. My husband was unable to attended, due to his
obligation at Ft. Benning. I started to the bathroom and the band began
to play Proud to be America; I stopped in my tracks and became
extremely emotional. Usually I can control my emotion in a crowd, but
it has been a long difficult year for us and the majority of military
families. I walked back to my friend held her hand and listen to the
song, letting the tears flow for all that I mourn. Pulled myself
together, and started for the bathroom again. At the end of the
corridor was a well-dressed gentleman who said that songs bring tears
to my eyes. <br>
He then stated that the world is going to be safe and not to worry. I
laughed it off, saying. I hope! For all the military families around
the world, to have a positive closure to the war and know that what we
are doing is not in vain. He told me his name and started to tell me
about himself. He then started telling me that my life was in a flux
and I had lost my direction, and to be careful about decisions that I
was contemplating. I need to understand the importance of family and
that I was the influential force in mine. He then started to pray,
explaining that Jesus died for our sins and continues to die each day
for the sins of the world. He talked for about 20 minutes telling me
other things, but unfotunatuly I can night remember it all. He then
took a rosary from around his neck, and started to reach out to place
it on mine. I told him that I could not take his rosary, that
rosary&sup1;s were a personal item. He then stated his name again, told
me the rosary was of pearls that dated back 3 generations of Irish
decent and had been blessed by Pope John the? (I cannot remember the
number). <br>
I then allowed him to put the rosary around my neck and he held the
cross and said that we fixate on the back of the cross, because we do
not want to visualize the crucifix. He told me to pray for myself to
find my direction and to pray for him to have the wisdom to guide. He
then turned away and just seemed to vanish in the dark of the night. I
turned around and there was a janitor working, I asked him if he knew
the gentlemen, he stated that he had never seen him before. <br>
My girlfriend came to check on me and saw us talking, but did not come
over. I heard her call, but her voice seemed so far away. Her normal
personality would have sent her over asking what the heck was going on,
but she did not. When I asked her why she did not come over she stated,
I thought you were talking to a priest and the look on my face was very
serene. <br>
He stated that all of the priest at the mission knew him, yet all that
I ask had never seen the individual that I was describing. <br>
When I took the rosary off and looked at it I felt a chill, the rosary
is similarly to one my Grandmother gave me 27 years again, when she
told me I had lost my direction in life and needed to pray for
guidance. <br>

Craig<br>
<br>
By: lizzieebizziee@comcast.net<br>
<br>
A few years ago, both my mother and I had these unsettling
feelings.&nbsp; I had a feeling that something was wrong with someone
in my life and my mom had a similar feeling but more directed.&nbsp;
One of my best friend's parents were away and my mom felt that
something wasn't right at their house, so she decided to take the 5
minute drive down the street.&nbsp; She arrived to a small bit of
chaos.&nbsp; My friend Craig had died in his sleep and she just missed
the ambulance taking him away.&nbsp; His siblings were left at the
house, a mess.&nbsp; I came home that day and my mother told me what
happened.&nbsp; I was devastated.&nbsp; I can't recall if it was that
night, or the night after but I was trying to fall asleep late one
night when I heard these sneaker clad footsteps down my hall.&nbsp; I
knew for a fact that everyone else in my house was asleep, so I became
a bit frightened.&nbsp; The footsteps came closer to my door and then
my door opened and closed and I could feel a presence in my room.&nbsp;
I knew it was Craig.&nbsp; So I turned to him and said "Seriously
Craig, its two in the morning, I need my rest, please don't bother me
now."&nbsp; I felt this cool air around me, kinda like a hug, and then
he walked away.&nbsp; <br>

"I'm Real"<br>
<br>
By: rebeccatanakalee@gmail.com<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;One night when I fell asleep, I got up at approximately 2:00 am,
and not knowing what the cause was, I went back to sleep. I got up only
minutes later (I can tell because I have a clock right across from
me.), and found I couldn't move. Before I saw it, I felt a cold chill
around me. Suddenly, I realized that a liquid-looking black figure had
appeared by me, and I had to strain my eyes to try to see it. It
wrapped me up in my blanket and pulled me off of my bed. I was still
wrapped in my blanket, and I was lying on the floor. The only thing I
was thinking at that time was "Is this real? I'm dreaming...right?" The
black thing faced me, and said in a man's voice, "I am real, Becky."
(My nickname is Becky.) The two things that really freaked me out right
then and there was the fact that it was talking, and that it knew my
nickname. I was really scared, and I couldn't say or do anything, so in
my head I was screaming for it to get away. The thing that surprised me
was that it just vanished, and it hasn't come back yet. The second it
was gone, I could move again-and once I realized that I could move
again, I ran out of my bedroom and got my mom up. She asked me what
happened, and I told her. She got up, and walked into my bedroom.
"Nothing's in here, Becky. It was just a bad dream." Now, I know what I
saw, and I know what happened had happened. I did not hallucinate, and
I don't have an overactive imagination-but at that time, I went along
with my mom's advice. Only 1 day passed, and I got up at the same time
the next night. I could move, but at that time I didn't, because the
thing that I saw next was the weirdest thing I've ever seen so far in
my life. I saw a young woman, probably 19 years old, in a wedding gown
holding a bouquet. She was glowing with a white light. She looked up,
and I saw stairs. She walked up those stairs, and the moment she was at
the top, everything-the white glow, the stairs, even the girl-vanished.
I did not feel a cold chill like how I did with the black ghost. Now, I
think that she must have been in a wedding service and her
husband-to-be and herself must have been killed before or after they
got married, and her husband must have gone up already, but she had
stayed on earth. I will never forget any of the above.<br>

Grandmother's Farewell<br>
<br>
By: starwhisper@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
Just Recently on 6/19/07 my husbands Grandmother passed away. They were
really close. She practically raised him from the age of 8 until he was
15. It was about 6 pm (Central America) and 5pm here in the states when
she passed away. He was still at work and he had closed up the
warehouse doors for the day. He was the only one left in the building.
He says about this time he kept hearing someone yelling his name. He
automatically thought someone had come in from the office doors, he he
ran over to check who was there. He says the closer he got the louder
it was. When he reached the hallway to enter the Office area nobody was
there. he went outside to check if anybody was standing there but
nothing. The odd part about it was that the office door was already
locked so it was impossible for anybody to get in. I told him that
maybe it was his Grandmothers way of saying goodbye to him for the last
time.<br>

Haunted House in Perryville, Arkansas<br>
<br>
By: winnmill@windstream.net<br>
<br>
I don't know if anythinh happens anymore sinse I don't live there.
But.. in the early 1960s we renter a very very old two story house in
the middle of town for a short time. I always felt watched. At the top
of the stairs directly to the left is a bedroom that was our play-room.
My cousin and I always played there. Numerous occasions footsteps
(boots) maybe would walk from the front of the upstairs to the door
where we played. At first I thought it was my Dad, so one time at the
footsteps styopped at the door, I jerked it open and no one was there. <br>
That house has been restored and I don't know who owns it now, but
there are still old ruins behind where cattle (bulls) I think were
kept. The house cannot be missed as it is on the main highway (hwy 10)
right down the center of town. There are no other private residenses
there. Wish someone could investigate that place. I have often wanted
to stop but am afraid that little bit of news might be unwelcome. If
anyone checks this out I would love to know the house's history. We
were extremely uncomfortable living there and soon moved. <br>

Share an Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: BluesPuck2@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My wife and I just got back from a trip to St Augustine, Florida.<br>
While there we had a few experiences that freaked me out a little as I
know very little of paranormal activity other than what I watch on
Ghosthunters or Hauntings, etc.<br>
A few years ago I did capture an image of what I think was a ghost at
Shiloh NMP in Tennessee as well as hearing some old time music (this is
actually an experience that has been posted at Shadowlands under my
e-mail address.&nbsp; Other than that I am not big into the whole ghost
thing, but I am definitely not a skeptic.<br>
So here is the experiences from our trip to St Augustine -<br>
1.&nbsp; As we left the Spanish Military Hospital (a supposed haunted
site and a part of a ghost tour) we saw a huge owl alight atop the
spire of the building during daylight hours.&nbsp; Not necessarily
strange but a little disconcerting.&nbsp; Not sure why a huge owl would
be out during the daytime, but inside the building I had asked any
spirits to give me a sign....probably just coincidence though.<br>
2.&nbsp; Now, the first one was cheesy but the next one is a little
wierd.&nbsp; We went on to the old drugstore museum.&nbsp; While there
I noticed a cold spot inan area of about 4-5 inches at about should
height (I am 6 feet tall).&nbsp; I checked around and the cold spot was
just in that area.&nbsp; nothing above it, nothing below it.&nbsp; No
ventilation was focused on that area.&nbsp; I took a digital photo of
the area and there is what appears to be a rather large orb in that
area although I saw nothing with the naked eye.&nbsp; The odd thing is,
I have read literature about a supposed haunting of this drug store (it
really is just a small room that used to serve as a drugstore/mortuary)
but the haunting is supposedly on the other end of the room near a
makeshift headstone for an Indian who is supposedly buried near that
site.&nbsp; Anyway, the cold sensation and the orb were a little
strange.<br>
3.&nbsp; At the Huegenot Cemetery and another cemetery near old St
Augustine we have multiple pictures of multiple orbs.&nbsp; We took
them from varuious angles to make sure it wasn't a light trick and sure
enough we have various orbs in various positions from various
angles.&nbsp; Nothing we saw with the naked eye, just on the digital
images.&nbsp; No apparitions, thoguh...I was hoping for one but didn't
see anything.<br>
4.&nbsp; At the Old Jail we stayed back at the end of the tour and it
the cell area I had an overwhelming feeling of despair when in a
certain cell.&nbsp; My wife snapped a photo and sure enough there was
an orb in the cell.&nbsp; When we looked back at a photo taken earlier
in the day when my entire family was there we noticed an orb in a
different cell next to where my daughter was posing for a
picture.&nbsp; <br>
Outside the front of the Old Jail my wife took several photos and we
saw multiple orbs on the digital images as well as what appears to be
the image of a person in one of the windows on the second floor of the
building (no one was in the building at the time - we confirmed from
one of the guides).&nbsp; <br>
Finally on the backside of the building near the gallows, I was
standing near the gallows and my wife was taking a picture of me near
the gallows from the back entrance of the building.&nbsp; She felt a
hand press against her upper back and run down to her lower back.&nbsp;
She turned around and no one was there.&nbsp; She checked and no plant
or other material could have rubbed against her.&nbsp; She was very
spooked.&nbsp; I took a photo of the area where it occurred but saw
nothing in the image, not even an orb.<br>
5.&nbsp; This is a strange one.&nbsp; Inside the Old Jail, my wife took
a picture of me in one cell and then took a picture of me in another
cell.&nbsp; When we reviewed the pictures there was an unexplained
picture that showed up on the cmaera between those two photos.&nbsp; it
was simply a closeup picture of what appears to be a brass padlock on a
jail door. Neither of us took the picture and cannot explain how it got
there.&nbsp; I went backl to examine the cells and could not even find
a padlock like the one in the picture.&nbsp; Not sure what that means,
but it was a bit disconcerting.<br>
Oh well, not sure if any of this is helpful or means anything.&nbsp; Just thought I would share.<br>

My Childhood Indians<br>
<br>
By: shadydot@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
When I was six and a half we moved into a new ranch home in a new
subdivision in Reseda, CA. My aunt was visiting, so I was sleeping on
the couch on the west wall our "great room". (Our small home had a
U-shaped kitchen on the east side, an eating area in front of the patio
door on the south side, and living room area on the west...all one
large room.) The bathroom was located north of the patio door, with the
two bedrooms down the hall. I tell you this so that you will better
understand the setting.<br>
I awoke one night and needed to go to the bathroom. When I sat up, I
saw a tribe of Indians going around in a circle in the middle of the
room. I was afraid, but I really needed to go to the bathroom. I could
make out the bathroom door, as the moonlight coming thru the patio door
illuminated it. So, I stood up, angled my body towards the door, closed
my eyes, and walked quickly towards the bathroom, waving my arms in
front of me to shoo the ghosts away. When I got to the bathroom, I
turned on the light and turned around........no one was there. I
decided that I had been imagining things, went to the bathroom, came
out into the great room, and took one more look around. Still seeing
nothing, I turned off the light and started towards the
couch.......only to have my path blocked by the Indians going around in
a circle. It was pitch black by the couch, so I ran to the light of the
patio door, sat down, and cried. The Indians kept walking, but now they
would look at me curiously ...almost sympathetically... as they passed.
Somehow I realized that they did not want to hurt me, even tho I was
still frightened. I sat there for awhile, but I was very tired and
chilled and wanted to go back to sleep. The west wall was still dark,
so I decided I could crawl over to the couch with my eyes closed and
then I wouldn't see the Indians...after all, they had gotten out of my
way when I walked to the bathroom with my eyes closed. I got on my
knees....closed my eyes...and began to crawl. As I put out my right
hand, I set it down on something cold and hard....like a bone....and I
screamed. My father came running out of the bedroom. When he couldn't
convince me that the Indians were gone, he took me to bed between him
and my mother. They fell asleep while I watched the Indians walk around
the bed, step up over my mother, over me, over my dad, back on the
floor and around the bed again. When daylight came, the Indians
vanished. I went out to look for what I had touched...there was nothing
on the floor by the patio door!<br>
Shortly after that we moved away and I never saw the Indians again.<br>

My First Ghostly Experiences<br>
<br>
By: wolfwitch@fuse.net <br>
<br>
Over the years I've had many ghostly experiences, but I would like to
start with my earliest memories of the house that started them
all.&nbsp; I lived in this particular house until the age of six, the
house is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.<br>
During this time my folks and I lived with an apparently male spirit
that would visually and audibly manifest both day and night.&nbsp;
During the day he appeared as a "smokey" apparition in an overcoat, he
was fond of walking around on both floors of the house, slamming doors
and drawers, as well as, tripping visitors returning from the bathroom
located on the second floor.&nbsp; My Mom had to tell my grandmother
that it was noisy squirrels so that she would continue to baby-sit me.<br>
Nights were the most active, all my toys had to be shut away in my
closet, otherwise they moved around on their own -- I never slept with
any stuffed animals.&nbsp; The apparition became more sinister in
aspect during the night and repeated the same activity every night that
I can remember.&nbsp; Even if I was sound asleep I would immediately
wake up as soon as I heard the first footstep from the second floor, it
meant that his nightly journey was starting.&nbsp; He would start
walking across the upstairs floor towards the steps that lead
downstairs where we slept.&nbsp; His footsteps seemed to echo as he
approached the steps.&nbsp; Not wanting to get caught by myself it
became a race to see who would make it to my parents bedroom first.<br>
He always took the same path to my parent's bedroom, through the
kitchen, living room and then into their bedroom to stand over my
mother.&nbsp; I usually arrived just seconds before him in time to see
him enter and stand over the bed.&nbsp; He would start whispering my
mother's name, he would do it over and over again.&nbsp; If I told my
mom that he was there she would tell me to, "shut up and go to
sleep."&nbsp; You could see him in the mirror, illuminated by an
outside streetlight -- his reflection looked solid -- but he was just a
dark, featureless and shadowy form.<br>
My mom never answered him and I always wondered what he wanted.&nbsp;
He never tried to hurt me or my immediate family, but the dog would
never willingly enter the house.&nbsp; After we moved my mother stayed
in touch with a neighbor who often said that nobody ever stayed in the
house very long after that.&nbsp; I assume it was the man who died in
the house before we moved there, he lived alone and was found dead in
his bed -- his bedroom was the room my mom and dad slept in!&nbsp; I
haven't been back that way in years but I still often wonder what he
wanted my mom to do and if he still walks around the house.<br>
