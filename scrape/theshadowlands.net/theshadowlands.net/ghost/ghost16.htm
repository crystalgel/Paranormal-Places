</H3><P><B>by indy@ykt0.attnet.or.jp</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello I'm a thirteen year old boy whom my father is in the Air Force.
</B>
<P><B>Now don't let my age discourage your belief of the truth of my story
or</B>
<P><B>should I say experince.</B>
<P><B>	My dad was stationed at Hickam Air force Base and worked at a rather</B>
<P><B>large building that had been there even before the attack on Pearl</B>
<P><B>Harbor.  Now it is the Pacific Air Forces Headquartes building. </B>
<P><B>Although during the war it was a 3000 man dormitory.  The shape of
the</B>
<P><B>building from the air is like a Number sign, #.  </B>
<P><B>	Now in the military when an object or enemy is not known they are
given</B>
<P><B>the alias "charlie".  During the war the dorm was bombed and the bomb</B>
<P><B>went right through the roof of the mess hall.  This wing or area is</B>
<P><B>called the " L wing"  It looks like an L from the air or the top
right</B>
<P><B>corner of the number sign.</B>
<P><B>	It was said to be that at the time that the bomb fell through the
roof</B>
<P><B>and exploded a man unknown man infact was mopping the floor of the
mess</B>
<P><B>hall.  Of course he was killed.  For some unknown reason the ghost
of</B>
<P><B>this man is said to haunt the L wing on the third floor which is the
top</B>
<P><B>floor.  </B>
<P><B>	My friend and I got a hold of this information through our fathers
who</B>
<P><B>work there.  So we figured that it would be fun to spend halloween
night</B>
<P><B>in the building.</B>
<P><B>We had heard a couple of stories of other people encountering the</B>
<P><B>ghost.  The best story invovled the security police who reside in the
L</B>
<P><B>wing on the floor.  They were running a training drill where there
was a</B>
<P><B>criminal loose in the building so they had all the lights on and all
the</B>
<P><B>exits sealed off.  A young airman was running down a fully lit hall
when</B>
<P><B>he ran into what felt like a person.  He looked up to see nothing but
he</B>
<P><B>did hear heavy footsteps running in the opposite direction.</B>
<P><B>	This young airman who had his little experience told me this first
hand</B>
<P><B>as well as my dad.  He said that the security police are so scared
from</B>
<P><B>that incident that they no longer patrol the third floor of the L wing.
</B>
<P><B>He said what really scares him are the moans that he hears when he
is</B>
<P><B>patroling the second floor coming from the third floor.  He can also</B>
<P><B>hear footsteps through the paper thin ceilings.</B>
<P><B>	the night that my father, me, my friend, and his father decided to
stay</B>
<P><B>in the building we really wanted to come in contact with Charlie in
some</B>
<P><B>order.  As freaked out as we were we went up to the third floor and</B>
<P><B>walked around.  Our dads weren't quite as afraid as us so they teased
us</B>
<P><B>by tapping us and yelling out the ghost's name.  Shortly after we
heard</B>
<P><B>moaning and we stopped dead in our tracks.  the moans semmed to be</B>
<P><B>getting closer then the moans were soon accompanied by footsteps,</B>
<P><B>runnings footseps.  So as a natural reaction we sprinted to the
stairs</B>
<P><B>and ran all the way to the first floor where we were bunking.</B>
<P><B>	 We were quite shaken up and tried to forget it.  We then wnet up
to</B>
<P><B>the second floor stair landing ot listen for moans and footsteps.
 Sure</B>
<P><B>enough we did and ran back to the first floor.  We went to sleep and</B>
<P><B>tried to forget about it all but how can you forget somthing this
nerve</B>
<P><B>rattling?</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>	Anyway, I am a 19 year old music education major at Eastern Kentuck</B>
<P><B>University.  I consider myself a "normal" person.  Well since 1992</B>
<P><B>things have been happening to me.  For example, when I would walk
into</B>
<P><B>my room at home or at my dorm I get this sensation of being hugged
and</B>
<P><B>that whoever it is that is there is happy to see me.  Or, I was
really</B>
<P><B>tired and I said to myself, " I really have to get up at 9:00am."</B>
<P><B>I forgot to set my alarm.  Well at nine that next morning my phone</B>
<P><B>rings.  I answer it and a male voice says, "Time to get up."  Well
I</B>
<P><B>freaked.  I thought I was going insane until I moved into my dorm and
my</B>
<P><B>roomate saw and still sees a small, white, three-dimensional ball of</B>
<P><B>light float around our room.  It happens when one of us gets real</B>
<P><B>depressed.  Another occurance was when my roomate and I were sitting
in</B>
<P><B>the room and our phone cord just shot straight out of the phone jack
as</B>
<P><B>if someone had ripped it out.  We were not anywhere near it.  And</B>
<P><B>finally we were watching T.V. and the T.V. shuts off by itself and</B>
<P><B>ejects the video tape out of the V.C.R.  It does this only when we
are</B>
<P><B>watching The Crow and only when one certain scene comes up.  We tried</B>
<P><B>putting other tapes in and they play all of the way.  The Crow tape
will</B>
<P><B>play in every other V.C.R. but not ours.  We know that it is not
broken</B>
<P><B>because I had it checked last week.  </B>
<P><B>	I saw this page on the web and thought I have to tell someone who
has</B>
<P><B>had things like this happen to them before.  I just want some answers.
</B>
<P><B>It is not scaring me or my roomate.  It is like it won't let us be</B>
<P><B>scared.  It follows me.  It would bither me at home before I moved
and</B>
<P><B>now it is in my dorm room.  I know you won't believe me but I just
want</B>
<P><B>to know who it is and what it wants.  Can you help me?</B>

<H3><A NAME="the apartment">The Ghost in the Apartment</A>
</H3><P><B>by 105450.2011@compuserve.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was seven years old the year was 1985.  We had jut moved to these
</B>
<P><B>run down apartments in a very small suburbanized town, two years
before.</B>
<P><B>Before my encounter with the spirit, or soul my older sister use to</B>
<P><B>admit to hearing and feeling stange things in the apartment, but no
one</B>
<P><B>would believe her not even I.  I remember I use to play a lot around
the</B>
<P><B>apartment complixes and I use to see a lot of police cars and
ambulances</B>
<P><B>I had no idea why. I thought it was because someone prank called or
got</B>
<P><B>in trouble,  I use to hear stories that the apartment was haunted and
that</B>
<P><B>people were murdered. No one else in my family would here these
stories</B>
<P><B>not even my sister, so I knew the things that she was saying could
or might</B>
<P><B>be true.  And then it happened, I was lying in my bed with my mother
and</B>
<P><B>my sister was sleeping in another bed right next to ours.  I remember
</B>
<P><B>sitting up in the bed just looking towards the closet, my mother and
my sister</B>
<P><B>were fast asleep.  And there it was a figure of a small woman, I was
so </B>
<P><B>scared I literally couln't speak, so I began to hit my mom hoping she
would</B>
<P><B>awake I was hitting her as hard as I could and she still would not
awake.</B>
<P><B>I remember looking again at the figure and she put her finger up to
her face</B>
<P><B>like when you want someone to be quiet, and then she left.  And right
when</B>
<P><B>she left my mother and my sister had awaken.  I told them the
experience</B>
<P><B>and maybe they believed me, I'm pretty sure my sister did since before
it </B>
<P><B>happened she felt and heard strange noises. A year later we moved
into</B>
<P><B>the city.  So far nothing stange has occured but I know if it does
I won't</B>
<P><B>be as scared as I was when I was seven.</B>

</H3><P><B>by mcberger@ix.netcom.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My husband and I had recently moved to New Mexico.  My daughter was
in </B>
<P><B>college in Minnesota.  My husband was away on a business trip.  One
</B>
<P><B>Friday night I had a terrible, very realistic dream where my daughter
</B>
<P><B>had been riding her bicycle and had had an accident with an </B>
<P><B>automobile.  The dream was so realistic and so disturbing that I </B>
<P><B>called her in the morning to assure myself that she was, indeed, </B>
<P><B>unharmed.  I got her answering machine, which only increased my </B>
<P><B>feeling of concern, but left her a message to call me as soon as she
</B>
<P><B>got the message.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I decided to go for a short run, thinking that this would help relieve
</B>
<P><B>the stress, but was concerned that my daughter would call while I was
</B>
<P><B>out.  I very deliberately decided to leave the phone off the hook for
</B>
<P><B>the 20 minutes or so I was planning on being gone, so that if she </B>
<P><B>called she would get a busy signal and think that I was on the phone
</B>
<P><B>rather than have the phone go unanswered and have her assume I had
</B>
<P><B>left the house.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>So I left the house and indeed wasn't gone more than 20 minutes.  I
</B>
<P><B>hurried into the house planning on calling her and hoping that she
was </B>
<P><B>now home.  I walked to the phone and was very surprised and more than
</B>
<P><B>a little spooked that the phone was on the cradle.  I was standing
</B>
<P><B>there looking at it, puzzled at why the phone was that way when it
</B>
<P><B>rang.  It startled me, but I answered immediately only to have a dead
</B>
<P><B>connection.  Now I was really spooked.  I put the receiver back in
the </B>
<P><B>cradle and it immediately rang again.  I answered.  It was my </B>
<P><B>daughter! I was so relieved to hear from her and before she could say
</B>
<P><B>much I rushed to tell her that I had been very worried because of this
</B>
<P><B>dream I had had.  I asked her if she got my message on her answering
</B>
<P><B>machine. She said, "No, but Mom, let me tell you why I'm calling. 
I'm </B>
<P><B>in the hospital and I had an accident on my bicycle with a car last
</B>
<P><B>night."</B>
<P><B>I swear this is a true story!  It still makes the hair rise.</B>

<P>
<P><B>As someone who grew up in Hawaii,a land steeped in superstion and dark
</B>
<P><B>religion,I have seen many "ghosts".On Kauai it is not unusual for </B>
<P><B>children to make a day valley climbing , which is what my sister and
I  </B>
<P><B> decided to do . There was a part of the valley that had a small </B>
<P><B>waterfall and we wanted to go swimming. BLAH BLAH.After a few hours
of </B>
<P><B>swimming we got hungry, so we found some stones to knock the jabong
</B>
<P><B>from the tree.The stones we had chosen came from a neat pile about
</B>
<P><B>three feet tall. We kept throwing the stones into the fruit tree and
</B>
<P><B>they would not come back down. Having thrown about ten stones into
the </B>
<P><B>tree,neither fruit or stones would come down ,we gave up and headed
</B>
<P><B>home. As we were leaving we heard the tree shake and turned to look.</B>
<P><B>Out of the tree, at the exact time ,all ten stones came down broken
in </B>
<P><B>half before they hit the ground.This didn't bother us because we </B>
<P><B>thought the menehunes had done it.Trying to make long story short.</B>
<P><B>The next day as my father got up to go to work he heard the typewriter
</B>
<P><B>in my sisters room typing.My father says that when he looked in her
</B>
<P><B>room the typewriter was typing by itself,unplugged. It takes alot to
</B>
<P><B>frighten my father so he waited until it stopped.The paper in the </B>
<P><B>typwriter was covered with Hawaiian text non of which any of my family
</B>
<P><B>can read. My father decided the best thing to do was to wake up the
</B>
<P><B>family and head over to our kahuna. As he woke up each of us three
</B>
<P><B>children we all began to throw up violently. My mother also woke up
and </B>
<P><B>began to throw up.Any way we finally got out of the house and the </B>
<P><B>sickness left us all at the same time . We brought the typing to our
</B>
<P><B>kahuna and she said that the message said that the two children had
to </B>
<P><B>pay for violating a sacred grave,and that my parents should leave us
</B>
<P><B>alone in the house.Well the kahuna come over to our house and talked
to </B>
<P><B>the spirits and they told her what my sister and I had done .The stones
</B>
<P><B>we had used to retrieve friut came from a kahunas grave. She made peace
</B>
<P><B>with the spirits and we had to go the grave site and replace the </B>
<P><B>stones.After that she blessed the grave and us and the sickness </B>
<P><B>immediatly left us.This is one of many encounters that I have </B>
<P><B>experienced.I am only writing because unlike you spirits follow me
no </B>
<P><B>matter where I live. I dont live in Hawwaii any more but well any way
I </B>

<H3><A NAME=demon>Caressed by a Demon</A>
</H3><P><B>by MSO@limra.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ancient Chinese fable believes that dreaming is a person's soul </B>
<P><B>wandering into another space, and nighmare is a person is haunted by
</B>
<P><B>ghost.  When a person see a bruise mark on the limb or body but doesn't
</B>
<P><B>feel any pain, the bruise is probably caused by ghost's pinch during
</B>
<P><B>sleep.  When a person dies in sleep, he just simply can't come back
to </B>
<P><B>real life from dream.  When a person dreams about the deceased relatives
</B>
<P><B>or friends, they have something to tell him or want him to do some
favors </B>
<P><B>for them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	The reason I state this theory is because I have no idea what I </B>
<P><B>have experienced was just a bad dream or really haunted by a ghost,
yet </B>
<P><B>the feeling was so real...</B>
<P>
<P><B>	During the summer of my college junior year (about seven years </B>
<P><B>ago), I had this nightmare.  I was awaken that morning by feeling a
hand </B>
<P><B>was combing my hair for about three or four times.  Therefore, I tried
to </B>
<P><B>turn around to avoid it but I realized my body was frozen and couldn't
</B>
<P><B>open up my eyes nor speak.  I started to gain a little more conciousness
</B>
<P><B>in about two or three seconds while the combing was continued, and
I </B>
<P><B>learned where I was:  I was lying on my left side with my left arm
under </B>
<P><B>my body, and my right hand rested on my right thigh.  I felt the hand
was </B>
<P><B>touching my scalp in a tilting left position which my right hand couldn't
</B>
<P><B>do, and I felt the hand was quite big and warm when it touched my head.
 I </B>
<P><B>almost felt like it was petting my head, and the fingers ran through
my </B>
<P><B>long hair to the end.  This feeling was becoming more vivid, as that
hand </B>
<P><B>kept combing through my hair.  The more it touched me, the more I was
sure </B>
<P><B>that hand didn't belong to me, and I knew it couldn't be anybody else
as I </B>
<P><B>was sleeping alone.  I started to have this feeling that a big monster
</B>
<P><B>demon was lying on my right side behind my back caressing my hair,
yet I </B>
<P><B>knew he meant no harm to me because he wasn't choking me or hurting
me.  </B>
<P><B>Nonetheless, I was scared because I couldn't move to tell "him" to
stop, </B>
<P><B>yet my mind was so clear that I could feel every stroke of his fingers.
 </B>
<P><B>This lasted for about five minutes, and I felt it was an eternity.
 </B>
<P><B>Finally, I concentrated to open my eyes, and at the same time I could
move </B>
<P><B>and I screamed hysterically and got out of the bed.  I didn't dare
to look </B>
<P><B>back, because a little voice inside my head told me that the demon
wasn't </B>
<P><B>a pretty sight to look at.</B>
<P><B>	When I think back, I wondered if the demon was attracted by my </B>
<P><B>long and smooth hair (it was almost three inches away to my waist back
</B>
<P><B>then), and I never left my hair that long again but only kept to the
</B>
<P><B>shoulder length.</B>

<H3><A NAME="blue dress">Lady in the Blue Dress</A>
</H3><P><B>by samc@ozemail.com.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi, my name is Sam. I am 30 years of age married with a child and another
on </B>
<P><B>the way.  Let me tell you about a true ghost story that happened to
me. </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 19 years of age, I was sitting on my bed about 4  o'clock
in the morning </B>
<P><B>because I just had a bad dream and couldn't sleep any more.  I was
thinking about things </B>
<P><B>and was staring straight ahead of me in deep thought.  Suddenly, I
noticed a faint dim </B>
<P><B>shadow.  To assure myself,  I decided to bend forward and stretched
out my hands to </B>
<P><B>prove it was just the moonlight coming outside the window.  To my surprise,
that shadow </B>
<P><B>started to look like a blue dim light.  As soon as I got real close
to it, say four </B>
<P><B>centimetres, I got the shock of my life.  I saw a lady dressed in a
blue dress with a </B>
<P><B>blue matching band around her hair, bright blue.  I was in shock. 
I didn't know whether </B>
<P><B>to be scared or how to react.  All I did was stare in disbelief.  Telling
myself that </B>
<P><B>this is impossible and that it only happens in the movies.  I tried
blinking my eyes but </B>
<P><B>she wouldn't disappear.  I almost felt we were related.  She gave that
motherly look.  </B>
<P><B>And at the same time I thought she felt sorry for me.  I guess because
I've had a rotten </B>
<P><B>child hood.  Then suddenly she started to move close to me.  I think
I knew how to react </B>
<P><B>now.  My first reaction was to push her away with my hands, but my
hands kept moving </B>
<P><B>through her hitting the curtains on the window.  I started screaming,
calling for help. </B>
<P><B>I got to the point that I was cornered against the bed head.  It was
amazing the way she </B>
<P><B>moved.  In ghost movies, they float like as if they're on the moon
or walk like a living </B>
<P><B>human being.  Instead she glided swiftly in a straight line towards
me and then kissed </B>
<P><B>me on the left cheek.  Afterwards she disappeared like when water splatters
in a million </B>
<P><B>drops.  That's what it reminded me of.  Then after that, everyone was
screaming at me in </B>
<P><B>the house telling me to be quiet and go back to sleep. Trying to convince
me that I just </B>
<P><B>having a bad dream.  All I now is that you know when you are awake
and you know when you </B>
<P><B>were dreaming after you wake up.  I know I was awake, because I was
very alert and </B>
<P><B>analytical.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>About four years ago I was told by a guy who worked with my wife that
he experienced the </B>
<P><B>same thing.  He has actually seen the same ghost as me.  I call her
the `Lady In The </B>
<P><B>Blue'.  He told me about his story first.  I told him my afterwards.
 His description of </B>
<P><B>her was exactly the same as mine.  I was amazed.  I never used to believe
in ghosts </B>
<P><B>before, but know I do.  I have never seen any since then.  But I tell
you what.  Since </B>
<P><B>then I am still petrified to sleep in the dark by myself.  Thank god
I have a partner </B>
<P><B>that sleeps beside me.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Please give me some feedback.  Also, I would like to know if anyone
has seen her as </B>
<P><B>well?</B>

<H3><A NAME="my great">My Great Grandmother and my Grandfather</A>
</H3><P><B>by ldnavy@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>      I have two stories.  The first stroy was told to me one day by
my mother when I was asking about how I'd gotten my name Lisa Darlene.  She
said that Darlene was her best friend in high school and Lisa had been given
to me by my Great Grandma Turner.  I thought about it for a little while
and could not remember her.  My mom showed me a picture and said she died
before I got to meet her in person.  She had been very excited about my birth
because I was to be her first great grandchild, but for reasons unknown to
me (I didn't think them important) was not able to come see me in the hospital
after my birth and died before I was able to come home.  She had expressed
to my my parents that she would like my name to be Lisa (they never found
out why).  My first night home from the hospital and the day after Grandma
Turner died, my mom had gotten up in the middle of the night to check on
me because babies usually cry in the middle of the night and this night I
hadn't.  When she'd gotten to my bedroom door, which was open, she was shocked
by what she saw.  Standing over my crib was my Grandma Turner just looking
at me and smiling.    After a few seconds she noticed my mother, smiled at
her and faded away.  My dad never believed this story untill my Grandfather
(Daddy Bo) died when I was about 8.  My dad worked for Carolina Power and
Light and went up to check the furnaces that were located on several levels
of the smoke stacks.  It was summer but once he'd reached the top it had
turned terribly cold.  He checked the furnace and when he closed it he began
to smell the flowers from my Daddy Bo's funeral but much more intense than
they had actually been.  It had scared my father because he was so high up
and didn't know if Daddy Bo was coming to get him too or just saying Goodbye.
 I'm happy to say my dad made it back down to the office and the man that
worked with him that night inquired as to why he looked as if he'd just seen
a ghost.  When my dad told him what happened the man took over my dads rounds.
 Needless to say my dad believes my mothers story of Grandma Turner.  It
seems as if the people that die on my dads side of the family always come
back to say goodbye to the people they most loved at the time.  These are
only two experieces that I know for sure of but I somehow feel there will
be a third in my life.  Perhaps when my dad dies he'll come to say goodbye
to me since I'm the person he most loves.</B>

<H3><A NAME=maine>Stories Told in Maine</A>
</H3><P><B>by DDengar123@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Just off the coast of Freeport Maine is a small island who's name I
will keep anonomus (due to the fact that the island is a simple, peaceful
summer-getaway and I DO NOT want folks going there just because of the story
I am telling).  The island is small with only about 120 houses, many dating
back over 100 years (to the time of some old war...Revolutionary i think.....)
  There is NO electricity, everything is run on gass, and it is VERY dark
and quiet at night save for few animal sounds and noises of parties happening
at neighboring houses.  There are many forest arieas and beautiful
pathways...awesome ocean-front properties and scruffy, dirt roads.  </B>
<P><B>     There are several ghost stories that are told about the Island...here
is my favorite:   I believe it is  true..but it was told to me by a couple
of drunk kids who were sitting on a dock one night.  If it IS true, it makes
me into a true ghost believer.</B>
<P><B>       Many decades ago..there was a little girl who had pnemonia because
she fell in the ocean during cold weather.  Her pearents took care of her
in a shack across from the main mantionuntill she finaly gave up and passed
away. </B>
<P><B>       Currently, there are people living in the mantion of the family
who took care of the girl.  There is a small shack just across from the mantion
that was used by the family as a guest house.  It wasn't kept very well,
and the furnature was all dusty &amp; messy.  One night, somebody went in
to store something there..and the furnature was in its usual dismal state---boxes
on top of couches, chairs stacked on top of each other, ect.  The next day,
when the person whent back to the shack to get what she stored the furnature
was completly cleaned and rearagned.  The people who told me this story said
they tried messing up the place again to see if they weren't going insane..and
the next day it would be clean again.    Make a note that that was the VERY
same place in which the little girl died of pnemonia.</B>
<P><B>       Also, people have seen a white figure of a little girl walking
across the dirt road that the house is on. </B>

<H3><A NAME=resort>Weekend at a Wisconsin Resort</A>
</H3><P><B>by JBeyer3811@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> In April 1994, my wife and I spent what we thought would be a romantic
weekend at a Wisconsin resort. All was as we planned until the 2nd night
(Saturday) that we stayed there. At approximately 3:00 AM, we were awakened
by the sound of what we thought were shouts coming from the breezeway outside
our room.</B>
<P><B>   It was a moonless night yet there was a flickering light that seemed
to reflect under the outer door. I looked out the window to see what the
commotion was about and saw nothing to account for the light that now reflected
off of the walls.</B>
<P><B>   As I turned to look back at my wife, I saw that she was sitting
bolt-upright in bed with what appeared to be war paint crossing her face.
Assuming that it was the play of the light, I looked harder to reassure my
eyes. Her face took on the hard features of an angry male figure and she
glared at me with piercing eyes.</B>
<P><B>   Needless to say, I panicked and threw the light switch, thinking
maybe it was a dream.</B>
<P><B>   It wasn't.</B>
<P><B>   As soon as it started, it was over. My wife returned to her lovely
self, and we spent the next hour telling each other that what we thought
happened-- didn't happen.</B>
<P><B>   We later learned that the area that the resort was built on was
rumored to be a sacred American Indian healing spot.</B>
<P><B>   My wife, now, has occasional nightmares that wake her up in cold
sweats with no recollection of what the bad dreams were about.</B>

<H3><A NAME=crazy>Am I Crazy ?</A>
</H3><P><B>by JMCLP1@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been dying to share my experience with others who have had some
sort of "encounter" of their own, finally I can.  I have read through some
of the other stories and mine doesn't even come close to being nearly as
awesome as theirs do.But I really want to know if what I saw was really a
ghost.  Well here goes...</B>
<P><B>About four summers ago I went back up to New York to visit my family
and friends.  I do that every year and I love my grandparents big old house,
even though it tends to creak a lot.  One night my cousin, my friend, and
myself were all up late watching television.  We weren't supposed to be up
that late, so when we heard my grandfather walking around upstairs we quickly
shut off the lights and tried to be quiet so he would think we were already
asleep.  I was sitting in a chair to the left of my friend and cousin and
was the only one who could see into the front entryway  from where we were
seated.  I looked over toward the front door and then looked away before
realizing that there was something standing near the door.  Well I looked
again and sure enough there was a young boy who was very pale, had blonde
hair, was wearing white sneakers, black pants and a shirt that contained
black and some other color, I believe it was white.  The boy just stood there
and looked at me.  He didn't move at all.  Not even when I said to my friend
"Oh my God there's a ghost!"  I ran and sat in between my companions who
were giggling and acting like they were scared.  I couldn't see the ghost
from where I was sitting then.  I checked to see if it was still there and
sure enough it was.  My cousin turned on the light then and when I looked
again it was gone.  The next day my friend brought up a mutual friend of
ours named Andy who had died of Leukemia on New Years Eve when we were in
5th grade.  I was shocked to realize that the boy I had seen the night before
was indeed Andy.  He had been buried in his comfortable clothes: white sneakers,
black vision skate pants and we are unsure of what shirt.  Andy also had
blonde hair and was always very pale.  That same day I asked God to give
me a sign if I did in fact see Andy.  That night I was awake reading and
I looked at my clock (which was digital so it plugged in the wall) it read
11:36 and I thought "OK God times running out."  And just after that the
light in the hall and in my bedroom flashed twice.  I figured it was a power
surge but my clock wasn't flashing 12:00 like it would have had it been some
type of surge.  Ever since then when I have asked God for some type of sign
lights will flash or music will turn itself off.  I believe that I did see
Andy and I also believe that he is my guardian angel.  I hope you do not
think that I am lying, because I am not.  I also hope that you do not think
that I am crazy because I am not that either.  Thank you for listening.</B>

<H3><A NAME=hauntings>Hauntings</A>
</H3><P><B>by arhodes@broc.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>	I had been reading the other stories and never realized I had a
similar</B>
<P><B>experience to many of the other people until recently when I was</B>
<P><B>thinking back on the weird things that happened at the house I lived
in</B>
<P><B>before.</B>
<P><B>	I lived in a small two bedroom house in Smyrna, GA with my parents
for</B>
<P><B>about eight years beginning in 1987.  At first nothing really
noticeable</B>
<P><B>happened but then after we got settled in good I started seeing
things</B>
<P><B>out of the corner of my eyes like little black shadows that would
peep</B>
<P><B>around the door but would disappear when I looked directly at the
spot.</B>
<P><B>I never thought this was anything abnormal.  Then later on my mom
told</B>
<P><B>me she would have weird dreams when she was alone in the house.  She</B>
<P><B>said she would fall asleep in the chair and would dream about things</B>
<P><B>like being chased or playing with a dog and the dog would bite her
and</B>
<P><B>it hurt so bad it woke her up.  I never thought this was weird either</B>
<P><B>because I did things like that and I always thought that your</B>
<P><B>subconscious didn't know the difference between what is real or what
is</B>
<P><B>a dream but since we moved neither one of us has had these sort of</B>
<P><B>dreams anymore.  She also admitted to seeing things out of the corner
of</B>
<P><B>her eye like I did but she never mentioned anything other than that
and</B>
<P><B>her dreams.</B>
<P><B>	One time me and her were the only ones in the house and I was
sitting</B>
<P><B>in a chair that was backed up against the front door and directly on
the</B>
<P><B>other side of the door was a small sidewalk and then some bushes. 
I</B>
<P><B>heard some breathing like a dog panting fast like it was running but
it</B>
<P><B>stayed in one place long enough for me to notice then it sounded like
it</B>
<P><B>ran behind me and disappeared.  I only heard the breathing and not
the</B>
<P><B>actual sound of the feet hitting the ground.  I asked my mom if she</B>
<P><B>heard it and she didn't since she was in the kitchen right next to
the</B>
<P><B>living room but it could have been an actual dog running by the door.
 I</B>
<P><B>thought that couldn't have been possible because it was so loud and
I</B>
<P><B>didn't hear any feet hitting the ground.  </B>
<P><B>	Then one time I remember I was laying in my bed facing the wall and</B>
<P><B>just about drifted off to sleep when I distinctly heard someone
behind</B>
<P><B>me whisper my name real loud.  I jumped and turned over but no one
was</B>
<P><B>there.  Needless to say I didn't sleep very well that night.  My
bedroom</B>
<P><B>was also where I would notice the shadows out of the corner of my
eyes</B>
<P><B>the most.  </B>
<P><B>Sometimes I would also jerk awake for no reason.  I told my dad once</B>
<P><B>that I hit the bed so hard when I jerked awake that it was almost like
I</B>
<P><B>was floating above my bed while I was asleep and when I woke up I
would</B>
<P><B>fall back to the bed.</B>
<P><B>	One other time, and this was the part of the story I forgot until</B>
<P><B>recently, I was in the house alone.  My parents had went to church
or</B>
<P><B>somewhere and I had a lot of studying to do so I stayed home.  It was</B>
<P><B>during the summer so the kitchen window was open and the chairs had
been</B>
<P><B>moved and replaced by a couch in front of the front door.  I was
sitting</B>
<P><B>on the couch and it was nearly dusk.  I was sleepy so I put the two</B>
<P><B>pillows from the couch on my lap and  bent forward to rest my eyes
for a</B>
<P><B>minute.  I heard what I thought was my parents coming home.  Since
the</B>
<P><B>house is so small you can just about see in all the rooms from the</B>
<P><B>living room and the door from the driveway is not that far away.</B>
<P><B>Anyway, I heard "them" coming through the door and when I tried to
get</B>
<P><B>up to look I couldn't.  It was like I was held down in that position
and</B>
<P><B>all I could do was listen.  I started to panic and I was very awake
at</B>
<P><B>this time.  I heard footsteps going back and forth across the kitchen</B>
<P><B>and I thought it was my mom so I tried to call to her  because I
thought</B>
<P><B>something was wrong with me but I couldn't even talk.  All I could
do</B>
<P><B>was moan and still it didn't come out very loud.  I heard blinds bang</B>
<P><B>across the kitchen window like the wind was blowing and the footsteps</B>
<P><B>continued.  It sounded like they would walk up to the edge of the</B>
<P><B>kitchen where the carpet for the living room starts then turn around
and</B>
<P><B>go back.  All these sounds were going on at the same time and all I</B>
<P><B>could think of was I was drugged and someone was robbing the house
with</B>
<P><B>me laying right there.  After a while I drifted off again but it was</B>
<P><B>like a forced sleep, believe me I did not want to sleep but when I
woke</B>
<P><B>up a few minutes later I could move and talk just fine.  I looked in
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen and everything was in place and the curtains weren't moving.</B>
<P><B>What made it even weirder was there was no wind that day and our
kitchen</B>
<P><B>window doesn't even have blinds.</B>
<P><B>	I never really thought about all this stuff being attributed to
ghosts</B>
<P><B>or anything like that.  I never gave it much thought although I knew
it</B>
<P><B>was possible but if I had realized what was going on when it was</B>
<P><B>happening I probably would have been scared senseless.  Also, during
the</B>
<P><B>time most of this was going on I couldn't stop thinking about my</B>
<P><B>grandfather who has been dead since I was about 4 or 5.  One night
he</B>
<P><B>came to me in a dream and ever since the thoughts have left me.  And</B>
<P><B>very soon after we moved in my uncle, who was close to my dad, was</B>
<P><B>killed in a terrible way. Then I found out that an older woman had
died</B>
<P><B>in the house and before that it was rented out and the people had a
lot</B>
<P><B>of drug parties but I don't know if they were into anything occult.
 To</B>
<P><B>me it sounds like most of this stuff can be explained by something
being</B>
<P><B>wrong with me like my continuous thoughts could have caused the dream
to</B>
<P><B>happen or the other things could have been because I was extremely
tired</B>
<P><B>or overimaginitive but it just seems like too much stuff to be</B>
<P><B>coincidence.  However I was the only one who said anything about</B>
<P><B>anything weird going on.  My dad never said he saw or felt anything
and</B>
<P><B>my mom never said anything other than seeing shadows and her dreams.
 I</B>
<P><B>forgot all about being paralyzed on the couch until I read another
story</B>
<P><B>just like it and I knew something had to be out of the ordinary.  If</B>
<P><B>anyone can help me make sense of this please do.  I don't want to
deal</B>
<P><B>with anymore ghosts or conjure up new ones.  I a big enough chicken
as</B>
<P><B>it is.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=see>The Ghost You Can't See</A>
</H3><P><B>by Dan645@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>i was home alone with my sister and she was babysitting me.  she is
three and a half years older than me. i never did believe in that kind of
stuff.  but then one night for no reason at all the toilets started flushing
by themselves. i know what you are thinking, that was just the plumbing.
 But it wasn't. This only happened when i was being babysat.  then one night
for no reason our garage door opened then closed and this happened a numeber
of times. of course me and my sister were alone and i was to scared to look
outside and so was she so we called our neighbor, and told her to check to
see if anyone was outside or near our house.  we figured that this was the
most logicall thing because it was late at night and there was recently a
few burgalries in my neighborhod. my nighbor said there was nothing or noone
their. we didn't tell our parent because we believed that they wouldn't believe
us.</B>
<P><B>a little while later my sister and her friend were sitting in the living
room watching tv and driinking a lot of water because hey were on some health
kick.  my sister expained to me that they were sitting there and all of he
sudden a galss of water spilled on my sister. i had to believe this because
this experiance had just happened when we got home and my sister wasn't laghing
about it.  i got really scared, but put it all in the back of my mind for
about a year.</B>
<P><B>thn one beautiful summers day my mom decided to take a picture of the
deck from the inside of the house through the sliding glass door. well when
then picture developed you could hardley see the flower arangement on the
deck and their was this man about seven feet tall with white clothes on.
 i thought it was god because it had every feature of god that the bible
told of, but then i decided that it wasn't.</B>
<P><B>i lost the picture eventually but will always remember what it looked
like.  sometimes i hear strange noises that only my sister can hear. and
i get the chills for no aparent reason.  also another thing that has me convinced
is my dog sometimes stares into space and starts barknig.  scientifc studies
show that most dogs have a sixth sense and can see paranormal activites.
although i have not seen aany real ghosts in my house besides the picture
i still believe. all of this is true.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sailor>Ghost Sailor</A>
</H3><P><B>by rjs1@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Back when I was about 9 or 10 years old, my parents took my brother
and </B>
<P><B>I to the Baltimore Harbor to tour the 18th century warship </B>
<P><B>"Constellation". We walked throughout the ship (topside &amp; below
decks) </B>
<P><B>seeing everything there. It was near closing time for tours through
the </B>
<P><B>ship, when my brother and I heard my parents calling us to come back
</B>
<P><B>up-stairs. We were below decks checking out all the Cannons. We then
</B>
<P><B>went up-stairs to our parents, I asked them if my brother and I could
go </B>
<P><B>back down-stairs, one more time before we would leave? they said we
</B>
<P><B>could. while down-stairs, my brother was walking over by the left side
</B>
<P><B>of the ship and I was looking at a cannon over on the right side of
the </B>
<P><B>ship. I looked at the cannon farthest away from me (about 20 ft) when
I </B>
<P><B>noticed a young sailor,dressed in black pants, a white stripped </B>
<P><B>shirt,round black hat with a tassle at the back,standing beside the
</B>
<P><B>cannon holding a long,tall wooden pole. I called to my brother,to come
</B>
<P><B>over and see the sailor, which he did so. I remembered saying to the
</B>
<P><B>sailor, that "he sure had a nice ship here". As we stood there, looking
</B>
<P><B>at the sailor, he (the sailor) turned his gaze from the direction that
</B>
<P><B>the cannon was pointed, and looked right at us! I will never forget
the </B>
<P><B>look in his eyes as he stared at us, he did not speak at all, then
</B>
<P><B>turned his gaze back to looking out through the gun port-hole.</B>
<P><B>  We then went back up-stairs to tell our parents about the sailor
we </B>
<P><B>had seen below decks. While I was telling my parents about this, one
of </B>
<P><B>the people taking care of the ship came up to us and said, we would
have </B>
<P><B>to leave, the ship is closing now. I told that person that the sailor
</B>
<P><B>down-stairs really made the whole tour seem so real! He was surprised!
</B>
<P><B>and then told us that there was no-one else below decks and that they
</B>
<P><B>have nobody dressed in a sailor suit working on the ship!</B>
<P><B>  I recently went back to see this ship again, although I did not see
</B>
<P><B>the sailor on this visit, standing in the same spot and looking at
the </B>
<P><B>same cannon, I began to feel cold chills and the hair on the back of
my </B>
<P><B>neck tingling! You decide?</B>
