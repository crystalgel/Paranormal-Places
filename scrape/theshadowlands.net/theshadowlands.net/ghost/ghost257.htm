<P><B>Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I recently found your website while researching the technology of
ghost hunting for a university project, and noticed your email address
for real-life ghost accounts.</B>
<BR><B>This is a description of something that happened whilst I was at
college in London, England, and this is really the reason I became interested
in the supernatural. I’m afraid I don’t have any photographs or anything.</B>
<BR><B>I went to college to study theatre, stage management and technical
stuff like lighting and sound at a place called Mountview Conservatoire
for the Performing Arts in North London. It is a very old house, probably
mid to late Victorian, owned by an entrepreneur who turned it into a theatre
school back in the 1950s I believe. Originally it was only used for private
classes for two or three people, but over the years it has been built up,
with later parts of the building added onto the structure of the original
house. For example, the main theatre is called the Mountview and was ‘stuck’
directly onto the fa&ccedil;ade of the house, covering what was the front
garden, and a tree growing up through that garden still grows through the
Stage Left wing. They simply built the theatre around it.</B>
<BR><B>The other theatre, simply a black, box shaped room that could be
adapted to any sort of play or stage shape just by setting up decking,
was called the Judi Dench, named after the actress who was one of the sponsors.
There is a narrow corridor between the two, with the dressing rooms on
one side, (used by both theatres and with a door at each end) and the workshops
for props and model-making on the other. The building here is quite old
and rickety, complete with creaky floorboards.</B>
<BR><B>The incident I remember most (there were actually several weird
ones) was at the beginning of my second year, around late July. I was the
company stage manager for a production in the Judi Dench. We ran our own
shows in second year as though we were a professional company, and so as
CSM one of my jobs was to open up the theatre first thing in the morning
and get it ready for the actors and crew. I had to unlock the doors, starting
with the lighting box for the Judi Dench as unlocking this door also switched
off the silent motion-detector alarm inside the theatre.</B>
<BR><B>I was the only one from our company to be in that morning, arriving
just before 8 a.m. The duty member of staff opened the front door and went
to turn off the alarm in the Mountview while I went off to see to the Judi
Dench. I was going through the corridor from the Mountview and was heading
for the lighting box to turn off the alarm, when I heard someone walk across
the stage area. It was totally dark, as you have to get into the box to
turn the lights on as well, so I didn’t see who it was, but I heard them
go up the small flight of steps leading up to the dressing room corridor,
and the dressing room door slammed. It was very quiet with no one else
around yet and the sounds were quite clear.</B>
<BR><B>At first I thought one of the actors must have got in via the dressing
rooms, which could have been opened form the Mountview side, had gone onto
the stage and then realised that the alarm was still on, so had run to
get out. I opened the box and put on the lights, and then went to find
the staff member to tell them, in case the alarm had tripped and the police
were on their way. Before heading back to the Mountview side of the building
I went to check the dressing rooms first to make sure they were all unlocked.
When I got there they were all still locked, including the one I had heard
close, and when I later found the staff member I was told that no one had
been in the dressing rooms, and that there was in fact no one else in the
building.</B>
<BR><B>I know this sounds ridiculous, and to begin with I thought I must
just have been tired having worked to 11 p.m. the night before, but later
I was talking to one of the other students who was working on another production.
She told me that once, while working late in the props room, she had heard
someone pacing up and down in the corridor (the same one that runs by the
Judi Dench). She had been so annoyed by this disturbance that she had told
the duty staff member off for it when they were leaving at the end of the
night. There were only the two of them in the building that night, and
according to the lecturer he had been in his office at the opposite end
of the building all night, surfing the net.</B>
<BR><B>Another, older student later asked me (when we were talking about
our experiences) if there was an acoustic piano being played in the show
I was working on. When I said yes, she just nodded as though this explained
everything. Whether this is true or not I don’t know, but the older girl
said that this sort of thing often happened when there was a real piano
(as opposed to the electric Clavinova) being used for the show.</B>
<BR><B>Apparently the house was originally used at the turn of the century
as a private girl’s boarding school. One of the girls was allegedly found
dead on the front lawn as though she had fallen from the upstairs window,
but there was no explanation of how she ended up there. That window, a
bay window, is still visible incorporated into the brickwork in the Mountview
Theatre, in the Stage Right wing and above Prompt Corner where the Deputy
Stage Manager sits to cue the show. According to the older students, several
of them felt as though they were being ‘watched’ whilst they were cueing
a show. And the effect is always said to be heightened when there is piano
music – they say that the girl liked to play the piano.</B>
<BR><B>Again, I have to say that I have never seen anything substantial,
beyond a sort of greyish shadow once in one of the wings, and I’ve never
seen any actual reports of the girl’s death, like newspaper clippings etc.,
but there is definitely something odd about the whole building. One student
described it as ‘sick’. But after the boarding school moved out the building
was used as a hospital for shell-shock patients during and after World
War I, so there could be many explanations for the noises and feelings.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: carma@intergate.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I just found your web site and find it fascinating! I lived in the
same</B>
<BR><B>house for 44 years in New Paltz, New York. I am convinced there
are</B>
<BR><B>spirits in that house. Here are a few stories.</B>
<BR><B>I always had a very uncomfortable feeling about a particular room
in the</B>
<BR><B>house. I was less than 3 years old when my grandfather took an overdose</B>
<BR><B>of a diabetes medication, Diabinese. It had just come out. He took
about</B>
<BR><B>60 pills in an hour because he forgot he took them. My mother found
him</B>
<BR><B>unconscious in that room. He died a few days later because when
they</B>
<BR><B>pumped his stomach, an ulcer ruptured and he bled to death.</B>
<BR><B>My father was ill for 8 years with a neurological disease,</B>
<BR><B>Steele-Richardson Syndrome. The VA provided a hospital bed when
he was</B>
<BR><B>home. He was in that room. Several years later, my sister was ill
with</B>
<BR><B>cancer. She was in that room and died in that bed.</B>
<BR><B>A year later, my mother, who was also ill with cancer, was in that
room.</B>
<BR><B>She died in that bed.</B>
<BR><B>I kept hearing noises in the house. I would be downstairs and the
only</B>
<BR><B>one home. I could hear movement upstairs like someone else was there.</B>
<BR><B>My mother and I had a habit of watching the 11:00 news and then
going to</B>
<BR><B>be. One night, I was on one side of the living room and got up to
turn</B>
<BR><B>off the tv at 11:30. I saw a small circle of light at the bottom
of the</B>
<BR><B>tv stand. When I got to the tv, it was as if an invisible wall went
up.</B>
<BR><B>I was only about 2-3 inches from the tv knobs, but until that light
went</B>
<BR><B>away, I could not reach them. It must have been my mother. A few
days</B>
<BR><B>earlier, my friend and I were sitting in the living room across
from</B>
<BR><B>each other talking. All of sudden he got a strange look on his face.
He</B>
<BR><B>saw a small ball of light move just off&nbsp; the floor near the
fireplace</B>
<BR><B>and other side of the room, and then disappear.</B>
<BR><B>About 2 years before my sister died, she went on a Tres Dias weekend
and</B>
<BR><B>got a cross. It was on one of her dressers in my brother's room.
I had a</B>
<BR><B>tennant in my sister's room. He thought he heard someone come in</B>
<BR><B>earlier, but was not sure. The house was on the market and repairs
were</B>
<BR><B>being made. We went upstairs and I instinctively flipped the switch
to</B>
<BR><B>turn the light on in the room. The light went on, so we realized
it had</B>
<BR><B>been the repairman. My tenant noticed the cross and suggested we
bring</B>
<BR><B>it downstairs.</B>
<BR><B>I took his advise and hung it on the mirror on the opposite wall
of the</B>
<BR><B>death room. That cross moved for 4 hours non stop that night! Sometimes</B>
<BR><B>it would move up and down like on a heartbeat. Sometimes it would
move</B>
<BR><B>side to side, like a pendulum. That cross still moves to this day!
I</B>
<BR><B>took it with me when I moved to Colorado three and a half years
ago. It</B>
<BR><B>has nothing to do with any kind of draft, open window, etc. I firmly</B>
<BR><B>believe my sister is still with me.</B>
<BR><B>Also ghost related, is the story of my father. He died Februry 18,
1981.</B>
<BR><B>It rained the day of his funeral. It rained on the way to the Funeral</B>
<BR><B>Home. It stopped so we could go inside. It rained while we were
inside.</B>
<BR><B>It stopped so we could come out. It rained on the way to the Church.
It</B>
<BR><B>stopped so we could go inside. It poured like no tomarrow all through</B>
<BR><B>Mass. It stopped so we could come out. It rained on the way to the</B>
<BR><B>Cemetary. It stopped when we got there. It started again when we
left.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;From that day on, till I moved in 1999, if I went to the Cemetary
in</B>
<BR><B>the rain, it would rain on the way up, stop while I was there, and
start</B>
<BR><B>again when I left. My girlfriend witnessed this one night and it
freaked</B>
<BR><B>her out. She thought I was joking.</B>
<BR><B>Here is a story about my mother. She always promised me she would
come</B>
<BR><B>back and help me if she could after she died. Well, she died on
a</B>
<BR><B>Wednesday morning. I had to drive to Northern New Jersey Thursday
night</B>
<BR><B>to pick up my brother and sister- in -law for the funeral. I forgot
to</B>
<BR><B>gas up on the way out of New Jersey. I looked at my gas gauge after
I</B>
<BR><B>passed the rest stop between the Newburgh exit and the New Paltz
exit on</B>
<BR><B>the New York State Thruway. I had less than an eighth of a tank
of gas.</B>
<BR><B>I asked mom to get me home. I hit empty about 2-3 miles before the
exit.</B>
<BR><B>I pulled into the gas station across from the exit on fumes. To
this</B>
<BR><B>day, I have not run out of gas. I do not make it a habit of waiting
till</B>
<BR><B>I am empty to fill up. I believe she is still with me, and watching
over me.</B>
<BR><B>After the death of my sister and my mother, I was devistated. I
tried</B>
<BR><B>suicide. I took some pills and put a frozen solid piece of London
Broil</B>
<BR><B>and tomato suace. I checked it after an hour or so and found it
had not</B>
<BR><B>cooked much. I took some more pills and decided to turn it off in
an</B>
<BR><B>hour or so. I woke up 10 hours later to go to work. The gas was
off. It</B>
<BR><B>was charcoal when I lifted the lid. The next day, my supervisor
told me</B>
<BR><B>my mother had come to her and told her to tell me she came down
and</B>
<BR><B>turned off the gas so nothing would happen to me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ja22fleeger@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I have a story for you! It happened to me about a year ago.It
was summer</B>
<BR><B>and my sister and I were home by ourselves. And I was getting a
shower and</B>
<BR><B>I heard my name. So I turned off the water and listened to see if
I heard</B>
<BR><B>it again, but I didn’t so I continued doing what I was doing. When
I turned on the</B>
<BR><B>water I heard it again. At this point im starting to get a little
scared so I yelled</B>
<BR><B>for my sister to see if she was the one who called me, but she didn’t
answer me.</B>
<BR><B>So I immediately jumped out of the tub and ran into the living room.
And I saw my sister laying on the couch sleeping. At this point im really
freaked out, so I wake her up and asked her if she was yelling for me and
she said no. After this im really scared.I walk into my bedroom and there
are these strange markings no my walls, they were and orangish color. I
ran out of my bedroom screaming and I woke my sister back up. I told her
to come see the markings on the wall and when she went into my room to
see them, they were gone. After this incodent a series of strange things
have happened.Lights would go on and off, things would fall over for no
reason, and my sister and I would wake up with strange marks on us. FREAKY!!!</B>

<BR><B>Footsteps</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My son told me this story.&nbsp; Soon after his mother and I divorced
they moved to Lincoln (England).&nbsp; He was aged 14 at the time of this
incident.&nbsp; He was walking home from school (alone) along Shakespeare
Street when he heard a woman’s footsteps.&nbsp; He told me he could tell
they were a woman’s from the sound he was hearing.&nbsp; I think I know
what he means.&nbsp; The footsteps came right up to him,&nbsp; went past
him and continued along the street,&nbsp; fading into the distance.&nbsp;
There was no-one else in sight.</B>
<BR><B>I am unsure about the existence of ghosts,&nbsp; being a little
sceptical I think there is a rational explanation for everything – it’s
just that it hasn’t been found yet,&nbsp; but my son does believe in them
and apparently has the ability to see them.&nbsp; He tells me that there
is a ghost in the house that I now live in with my second wife,&nbsp; but
that I am not to worry as it is a friendly spirit.&nbsp; As we are the
first people to live in this house,&nbsp; built in the London Docklands
area,&nbsp; and no-one has died in it I cannot imagine where a ghost would
come from but I am prepared to take my son’s word that there is one.&nbsp;
I have often thought I have seen something out of the corner of my eye,
but then I have had several eye operations and when I am tired I could
easily be deceived,&nbsp; but our cat often reacts as if he is looking
at someone or something that I can’t see.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Family Don't seem to want to Leave</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: saltcup@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>before i explain what happened, it would probably make more sence
to decribe</B>
<BR><B>my situation. i am a 20 year old male living in a city on the north
western</B>
<BR><B>shore of lake superior called Thunder Bay. me and my 2 brothers
were not</B>
<BR><B>living with my parents , who were seperated at the time. instead,
my</B>
<BR><B>brothers (both of which were younger, one who was 15 and the other
was 17</B>
<BR><B>when i was 18)&nbsp; lived with my aunt as foster children, and
i lived on my</B>
<BR><B>own. we were just getting closer to my mom, and visited her every
weekend.</B>
<BR><B>one week she decided that she was going to go on a fishing trip.
my mom and</B>
<BR><B>her boyfreind invited me and my brothers, but i decided not to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;
a</B>
<BR><B>choice that may have saved my life&nbsp; or&nbsp; led half my family
into an early</B>
<BR><B>grave, because the only one to survive the trip was my youngest
brother.</B>
<BR><B>before the left&nbsp; my other uncle (who lives downstairs from
the aunt and</B>
<BR><B>uncle my brothers were living with) saw andrew and said he looked...&nbsp;
almost</B>
<BR><B>colourless, or grey and that somthing was very wrong. he didn't
mention it</B>
<BR><B>untill after it happened because it didn't make any sence to him
at the</B>
<BR><B>moment. during the trip, the went fishing and the boat they were
in flipped</B>
<BR><B>over. they all drown except my youngest who made it to shore by
hanging on</B>
<BR><B>to the boat. now that you know the history, this is where things
started</B>
<BR><B>getting weird.&nbsp; since i stayed at home during the trip, i had
no idea what</B>
<BR><B>happened. my aunt and uncle drove my brother home after the ordeal
that</B>
<BR><B>night, but i wasn't told about it untill the next morning.&nbsp;
but that same</B>
<BR><B>night when he went home, my alarm clock fell to the floor. now that
may not</B>
<BR><B>sound strange&nbsp; but it was not close to the edge&nbsp; and there
was no way that i</B>
<BR><B>could have pulled it down since the cord was leading away from the
bed.</B>
<BR><B>after the funeral my uncle (the one who lived downstairs from them)
started</B>
<BR><B>seeing the brother who died,&nbsp; standing in the door of his room
at the corner</B>
<BR><B>of his eye. he would turn that way but no one was there. my uncle
was not</B>
<BR><B>one who would lie about somthing like that&nbsp; or see things that
wasn't there</B>
<BR><B>so i believe him totally.&nbsp; about a month or two after his death
and my</B>
<BR><B>mothers death, i moved in with my fiance downstairs from her parents.
i</B>
<BR><B>needed to get surgury to fix my nose and take my tonsils out at
the same</B>
<BR><B>time. my fiance drove me to the hospital on the day of the surgury,
and i</B>
<BR><B>suddenly felt sad because i knew my mother wouldn't be able to be
there for</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; i went into the OR and obviously didn't stay awake for
it. my fiance,</B>
<BR><B>however sat outside the doors to the hall that led to the OR which
was</B>
<BR><B>pretty close to her. i was taking abnormally long to finish (which
my fiance</B>
<BR><B>should know since she is a nurse) and was getting worried when she
saw a</B>
<BR><B>lady in purple walk to the dorr of my room. my fiance does NOT make
up</B>
<BR><B>stories and is very reliable but she&nbsp; still swears that it
was my mother!</B>
<BR><B>before she entered my room, she turned and smiled at my fiance then
went in.</B>
<BR><B>a few minutes later i came out. but my mother wasn't seen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
when i</B>
<BR><B>came to, i was told by the doctor that they had trouble bringing
me back</B>
<BR><B>from the anastetic. maybe thats why my mom was there.&nbsp; more
things happen</B>
<BR><B>like a clear knocking on our door&nbsp;&nbsp; but no one is there&nbsp;
and other things</B>
<BR><B>simular.&nbsp; we aren't the only ones who experiance this,&nbsp;
my aunt had new</B>
<BR><B>foster kids after my surviving brother moved out. 2 girls and one
boy. the 2</B>
<BR><B>girls slept in my bro's old room and were so terrified that they
wanted</B>
<BR><B>there brother to sleep in there with them. the next morning after
he slept</B>
<BR><B>in that room he told my aunt that he couldn't sleep very well. when
asked</B>
<BR><B>why, he said that his sisters kept hearing things and waking him
up. he also</B>
<BR><B>told her that his sisters saw a boy. we think maybe it might be
my brother,</B>
<BR><B>but who knows. i&nbsp; haven't experianced much since, and my experianced
might</B>
<BR><B>seem insignificant to some, but mfor me&nbsp; its kinda creepy</B>
<BR><B>thats my story i hope it gets to you ok this time with out half

<BR><B>Dorm Room Ghost</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Calf98@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Name is Erika and I had an
experience once at a dorm I was staying</B>
<BR><B>in over the weekend I was 17 or 18 I'm not too sure now.&nbsp; I'm
from El Paso,</B>
<BR><B>TX. and I was staying at the University of Texas at El Paso.&nbsp;
Now, I had</B>
<BR><B>never really heard about anything strange going on at these dorms
we were</B>
<BR><B>staying at until my experience was shared.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was coming to the end of
a very long day.&nbsp; I had woken up early</B>
<BR><B>around 5 am. to get ready for the science fair.&nbsp; No, that isn't
the reason</B>
<BR><B>for going to the university but this is part of the story.&nbsp;
I went to my</B>
<BR><B>science fair and was there almost all day.&nbsp; It ended around
three in the</B>
<BR><B>afternoon.&nbsp; I was in a rush to finish because I was meeting
my friends at</B>
<BR><B>UTEP to begin another season of the Young Leaders Conference (YLC).&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>very excited to see all my friends but I was also very tired.&nbsp;
The conference</B>
<BR><B>went underway and it finished into the night as it always had every
year.&nbsp; By</B>
<BR><B>the time we did room check I was extremly exhausted.&nbsp; I was
a councelor at</B>
<BR><B>the time so we did room check and then all of us were going to hang
out that</B>
<BR><B>night on the floor above to eat pizza and see how everyone was.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was rooming with my best
friend name Veronica.&nbsp; She came in, let me</B>
<BR><B>know where everyone was going to meet and if I was interested in
pitching in</B>
<BR><B>for pizza.&nbsp; I told her that I was too exhausted to eat and
that I just</B>
<BR><B>thought it best to go straight to bed.&nbsp; I told her that she
should go without</B>
<BR><B>me and if she wouldn't mind being very quiet when she came in so
she would</B>
<BR><B>not wake me.&nbsp; She was fine with that and said she would see
me in the morning</B>
<BR><B>and asked me to wake her up when I got up the next day.&nbsp; I
agreed and went to</B>
<BR><B>sleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to explain to you the
way the dorm room looked.&nbsp; When you</B>
<BR><B>walked in the room the beds were against the wall on the same wall.&nbsp;
They</B>
<BR><B>were parallel to the wall and the only thing between them was a
sink.&nbsp; All</B>
<BR><B>the closests and cabinets were on the opposite side of the room.&nbsp;
When I</B>
<BR><B>slept, I put my head towards the door and my feet towards the window.&nbsp;
There</B>
<BR><B>was a window on the opposite side of the room from the door.&nbsp;
I liked</B>
<BR><B>sleeping in that bed every year because I liked looking out the
window.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>whole room was dark and I was getting pretty sleepy.&nbsp; I guess
I must have</B>
<BR><B>gotten to the point where I was finally asleep when things started
to happen.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember that I heard that
the cabinet door opened and slammed shut.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I really didnt think much of it because I just figured that
Veronica came in</B>
<BR><B>and the door of the cabinet must have slipped from her hands and
slammed</B>
<BR><B>shut. I started to get to sleep when I heard the closet door open
and shut</B>
<BR><B>again.&nbsp; I wasnt aggitated but I forgave her again for it.&nbsp;
Finallly, the sink</B>
<BR><B>light came on.&nbsp; I knew she had to turn it on to brush her teeth
so I was</B>
<BR><B>still okay with most of the noise.&nbsp; Then it got ugly.&nbsp;
I heard the water in</B>
<BR><B>the sink on and then her bed light came on.&nbsp; As soon as that
happend I heard</B>
<BR><B>the cabinet and closet doors opening and shutting quite fast.&nbsp;
Then that</B>
<BR><B>lights for the entire room came on.&nbsp; All this noise at once
was just enough</B>
<BR><B>to drive me crazy.&nbsp; I finally got so fed up with it that I
sat up and yelled</B>
<BR><B>towards the window, "Vero will you knock it off, I'm trying to get
to sleep</B>
<BR><B>and I thought I asked you to please be quiet when you came in".&nbsp;
At that</B>
<BR><B>moment all the lights went off and the sink water stopped running.&nbsp;
There was</B>
<BR><B>no way for all of those things to have turned off on their own all
at once</B>
<BR><B>unless there was more than one person in the room.&nbsp; But the
funny thing was,</B>
<BR><B>now that I realize it, there were no sounds of foot steps.&nbsp;
About half an</B>
<BR><B>hour later Veronica walked back in the room.&nbsp; I asked her if
she had been in</B>
<BR><B>the room just a while back and her and another friend confirmed
to me that</B>
<BR><B>they had just come back so they could go to bed.&nbsp; This other
friend was just</B>
<BR><B>walking her back.&nbsp; I never told Vero what happend that night,
I never really</B>
<BR><B>told anyone about it until I started hearing other people with their
own</B>
<BR><B>stories.&nbsp; I know for a fact now that someone died in those
dorms.&nbsp; I don't</B>
<BR><B>know why or how but I do know that they don't house students in
those dorms</B>
<BR><B>anymore. I still think about it to this day and wonder what that
lonely</B>
<BR><B>student wanted.&nbsp; Was I in their room? Or did they just feel
like causing some</B>
<BR><B>hell and annoying me? I guess I'll never know!</B><B></B>

<P><B>I never understood what a ghost or haunting was... Now that im older
i now</B>
<BR><B>know i had experienced it when i was a child...</B>
<BR><B>My family is from Mexico and when i was a child my grandmother would
always</B>
<BR><B>bring me toy dolls. Well she bought me this huge doll, it was bigger
than</B>
<BR><B>me. My two older brothers were so scared of that doll they would
never get</B>
<BR><B>near it. At night my mom would put it away in the closet because
my brothers</B>
<BR><B>were so afraid of it. One night while i was asleep i heard someone
giggling,</B>
<BR><B>i looked toward the closet and it was the doll. I could not move
or yell for</B>
<BR><B>my mom or anybody because i was so scared. Finally i got the courage
to get</B>
<BR><B>up, and i ran to my moms room, when i was getting up the doll just
stared at</B>
<BR><B>me as i left the room. I was so surprised of what i saw i told my
mom and</B>
<BR><B>she just said i was having a nightmare, she put me to bed and i
did not see</B>
<BR><B>or here the doll that night. That was the night that started it
all.. The</B>
<BR><B>next morning everyone in the house was yelling and running around,
i went to</B>
<BR><B>the dinning room where everyone was, and the doll was behind the
couch..&nbsp; No</B>
<BR><B>one would touch the doll to take it to my room. My mom thought my
brothers</B>
<BR><B>were just playing a prank, but the next few days the doll would
always be in</B>
<BR><B>a different place of the house, sometimes we would not even find
her... We</B>
<BR><B>asked my grandma where she got the doll from, a store or someone.
My</B>
<BR><B>grandmother is known as a Curandera, means she is a healer, (good
witch). We</B>
<BR><B>asked her if the doll was good or bad, to make sure it was not going
to do</B>
<BR><B>harm. She says that she had bought the doll from an old woman. We</B>
<BR><B>investigated the woman, her background everything about her, finds
out the</B>
<BR><B>old lady used to work in an old orphanage where the kids there would
get</B>
<BR><B>tortured. The woman was not a pleasant woman, very mean and very
scary</B>
<BR><B>looking. Finds out that old woman died eight years before my grandmother</B>
<BR><B>bought the doll... We were so freaked out at that point we did not
know what</B>
<BR><B>to do or say. My grandmother went to our house, went to the back
yard and</B>
<BR><B>started a fire in an old barrel, went inside and looked for the
doll when</B>
<BR><B>she found it the doll started to scream with an old lady's voice,
and was</B>
<BR><B>shaking.. At that point my mom, and brothers where just freaking
out, we</B>
<BR><B>could not believe our eyes, and ears.. My grandma was not even scared
or</B>
<BR><B>nothing she just picked up the doll and took it to the back yard...&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>grandma threw the doll into the fire, started praying in Spanish,
when she</B>
<BR><B>did the doll started to scream, and kick and the face started to
look like</B>
<BR><B>the old woman's face... The dolls name was Maria just like the old
woman's</B>
<BR><B>name, it was on a bracelet that came with the doll, I still have
the</B>
<BR><B>bracelet... I will never forget nor will my family forget that horrifying</B>
<BR><B>experience......</B>

<P><B>Ceiling Hole</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Sassytrent@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>once when i was spending the night with my boyfriend we heard a loud
noise and looked out his door into the laundryroom and the ceiling had
fallen down and there was a big hole. He thought it was weird, I did too
he said he would just have to fix it in the morning. We went back to sleep.
The next morning we got up to inspect the damage and there was none.</B>
<BR><B>Another time I was in my bed at my house and my guy was at his house
and I really wanted to see him bad. I just closed my eyes and concentrated
real hard and I swear my soul left my body. I could feel myself floating
through the streets and to his house. When I got there I knocked on his
bedroom window and he came out the back door and talked to me. We kissed
then I felt myself float back home into my body. When I woke up the next
morning I thought man that was a wierd dream. When I seen him later that
day he told me he was suprised to see me lastnight. I said I thought I
was dreaming that. He said no it really happened. I didn't even tell him
before he told me he was suprised.</B>

<P><B>Cape Cod House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: john.peirce@verizon.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Im very glad to see that someone has taken it upon themselves to
make a</B>
<BR><B>sight like this. I wanted to share my experience with you. It was
late</B>
<BR><B>august and my parents decided that they did not ant to deal with
me anymore</B>
<BR><B>(i wasnt the best of kids) so they sent me to live with my great
uncle jim,</B>
<BR><B>he lives in a nice cape cod house right on the water. his house
is ancient,</B>
<BR><B>and used to contain many rooms. My uncle decided that he wanted
to tare all</B>
<BR><B>the walls down and make the bottom flooer one large roo., in the
center of</B>
<BR><B>the room he created was this old very large winding stair case.
It always</B>
<BR><B>freaked me out because it creeked. Any way he went to the super
market for</B>
<BR><B>and hour or so and left his dog, skippy and i alone. i was watching
reruns</B>
<BR><B>of friends when skippy started to act very strange, though he was
laying</B>
<BR><B>next to me on the sofa he was admitting a low growl and eyeing the
stair</B>
<BR><B>case, when patted him, he groweld at me and got up. The dog circled
the</B>
<BR><B>stairs growling and looking up, then abruptly took off up the stairs
as if</B>
<BR><B>chasing something. I thought skippy was having a senile moment until
i heard</B>
<BR><B>an upstairs door slam, and then another, and then another. After
the</B>
<BR><B>slamming skippy came tearing down the stairs, stood at the bottom
nd started</B>
<BR><B>to bark. I was scared, but i was also 15 so i decided to be a brave
and go</B>
<BR><B>see what it was, as i neared the stairs skippy began to growl at
me and</B>
<BR><B>snap, almost as if he wanted to scare me away from the stair case
and</B>
<BR><B>whatever he was barking at. i looked at his eyes and saw them revolving</B>
<BR><B>around the stair case as if following someone o something down them.
as any</B>
<BR><B>teenage girl would i started to flip out and ran outside calling
skippy</B>
<BR><B>after me. from outside i gazed up at the windows and saw dark shadows
moving</B>
<BR><B>around inside, my immediate reaction was robber, so being as headstrong
as i</B>
<BR><B>was i plunged back inside and ran upstairs, nobody was there, and
all the</B>
<BR><B>doors where wide open.</B>

<P><B>Call the Ghosts.</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: BFarmerRT@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to live in a house in
El Segundo, CA, right outside of LA. My sister and I would always be home
during the weekends together while my mother and father worked and my grandmother
would take care of us. My sister and I would do everything together: play
video games, watch Tv, go outside. Sometimes we were not very well behaved
and my gramma would say to us, " You better behave or i ill call out the
ghosts." just to frighten us. So we devised a plan of what to say the next
time she recited this to us. I was 5 or 6 at the time and what we said
that one day was, "</B>
<BR><B>why don't you call them then." And she did she called the ghosts.
She said they were upstairs waiting. We went to investigate. At first we
saw nothing. We looked at the large outer closet mirror and laughed saying
that we got her this time! HA HA! And right at that very moment the closet
opened and out came a silver humanoid form, that looked very similar to
a knight in armor. My sister screamed, picked me up in her arms and ran
me down the stairs. We were so frightened as we told our gramma I even
think i might have peed my pants( I was 5). Even now that I am older every
time I walked into that room alone I never felt right. Gramma didn't really
say anything about the incident, but she never, EVER called the ghosts
again.</B>

<P><B>At Peace</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: k.goodlin@worldnet.att.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello,</B>
<BR><B>This occurence just happened to me and my husband. On the morning
of the sixth of March we were in our bed sleeping. The phone rings at four
thirty in the morning. It was his brother telling us that his father had
been rushed to the hospital .The call was then cut off.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;We laid back down to wait for another call</B>
<BR><B>to give us the details.We dozed off when all of a sudden</B>
<BR><B>there was this tremendous noise at the door. We both jumped out
of bed . Our two dogs were going crazy. We</B>
<BR><B>went to the front door and noone was there. In the bathroom</B>
<BR><B>the fishclock that had been up on the wall for years decided</B>
<BR><B>at that precise time to fall of the wall. Just as we put the clock
back and headed for the bedroom, the phone rang.</B>
<BR><B>Without answering&nbsp; the phone ,we knew that his father had just
passed away. W e feel because there was lack of communication between them
.It was Roger telling him in his own way that there was peace between them.After
this my husband was at peace with himself and his father's passing.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Taste of Suicide</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: captainzampino@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was still
a youngin' (ten or so) I was moved into a my first</B>
<BR><B>in a series of foster homes. My fosterparents were very stern, stoic
people,</B>
<BR><B>who didn't take crap from anyone, especially a little angst filled
brat like</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; They had just finished preparations for me, which included
a bit of</B>
<BR><B>remodeling of the basement, which is where I would make my new home.
The</B>
<BR><B>room they had decided to generously provide me was a walk in closet,
which</B>
<BR><B>used to be a storage room, and had one very small quarter privacy
window. My</B>
<BR><B>new humble abode had a water/gas pipe generous something running
from one</B>
<BR><B>end of the ceiling to the other, about two inches away from the
ceiling.</B>
<BR><B>>From the second I was escorted in, I felt an overpowering anger-
Just this</B>
<BR><B>blind, insane rage. For most ten yearolds, this would have been
something to</B>
<BR><B>toss a shrink a couple bills over; But my new family, and myself,
passed it</B>
<BR><B>off as stress.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first couple
night in that room were fine- A bit cold, but</B>
<BR><B>fine. However, about a week into my stay in my glorious room, I
began to be</B>
<BR><B>woken up by a very soft creaking noise- Bearly audible, but it woke
me up</B>
<BR><B>anyway.&nbsp; It was this sort of squeaking, grinding noise that
would last about</B>
<BR><B>two minutes, then stop- Starting fast, then slowing down to silence.</B>
<BR><B>Homicidally enraged, I'd sit up and cling to my little stuffed kitty,
and</B>
<BR><B>d*** the social system and child protection agencies for making
me live in a</B>
<BR><B>closet with crappy ventilation and leaky pipes.&nbsp; For some reason,</B>
<BR><B>underneath my blistering annoyance, I was doing my best to ignore
fear that</B>
<BR><B>seemed to consume any other thought. Although I'd never admit it
then, I can</B>
<BR><B>remember fighting&nbsp; back very rare tears. I'd tell my little
stuffed kitty</B>
<BR><B>"Oh, Christ! A pipe is making noise! it's satan himself, coming
to steal my</B>
<BR><B>soul and eat my ovaries!" and then laugh like a god*** maniac, trying
to</B>
<BR><B>provide any sort of pathetic, desperation comfort.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That wasn't really what
scared me though. What got me, was what</B>
<BR><B>accompanied the noises. A very slender, human shaped silhouette
would sway</B>
<BR><B>gently in the corner of the room, each movement in time with the
grinding.</B>
<BR><B>This wasn't a shadow from outside, since there were no lights and
the</B>
<BR><B>whatnot. Now I was a weeeeeeiiiiirrrd little kid- And I wasn't afraid
of</B>
<BR><B>anything- peein' my pants over a squeaky pipe and a shadow didn't
quite</B>
<BR><B>fit. I was back to my old, sulky self the second I left my room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a week later,&nbsp;
I was laying in my bed, sketching, when I</B>
<BR><B>heard a knock on the door. I yelled for whoever it was to come in-
But</B>
<BR><B>nobody answered. The knock came again, and being the impatient little
snot I</B>
<BR><B>was, I hissed "WHAT!?!" I got a response I really didn't want. A
woman's</B>
<BR><B>voice, drifted under the door, dripping with despair. "Please come
out...</B>
<BR><B>you've been in there so long..." "I'm so sorry dear, would you please</B>
<BR><B>just... open this door? Please?" "You have to eat. let me bring
you some</B>
<BR><B>food." "Please unlock the door, for just a little while?" ect. This
voice</B>
<BR><B>was completley unfamiliar, and was not possibly anyone in my house.
Arching</B>
<BR><B>a brow, I hopped dout of bed and skittered to the door, prepared
to give</B>
<BR><B>anyone behind it the beating of a lifetime with my sketchbook. And
as you</B>
<BR><B>guessed it, there was no one there. And after grabbing kitty, and
conducting</B>
<BR><B>a thorough search of my basement, I shrugged it off and went back
into my</B>
<BR><B>room. That night, as usual I woke up to the creaking and the swaying</B>
<BR><B>silhouette, but now it was joined by the knocking, and the voice-
And a very</B>
<BR><B>distinct smell of rotting meat, which gave me a heavy nose bleed.&nbsp;
Scared</B>
<BR><B>out of my god*** whits, I ran to my foster parents room all bloody
faced and</B>
<BR><B>cried like a b**** with a skinned knee. I explained that there was
something</B>
<BR><B>in my room, and the pipes, and the shadows, and all that crazy psycho</B>
<BR><B>babble.&nbsp; Being so rare to see me show any sort of emotion,
they listened</B>
<BR><B>instead of blowing me off, and offered to spend the next&nbsp; night
down there</B>
<BR><B>with me. They did, and too my surprise at their skeptical nature,
they saw,</B>
<BR><B>heard, and smelt everything that I had.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My neighbor boy
who was considerably older then me was taunting on</B>
<BR><B>Halloween, saying "i know something about your house that you don't"
and the</B>
<BR><B>like. I begged and begged for him to tell me, but he wouldn't, claiming
it</B>
<BR><B>would scare me too badly, and if I moved he'd tell me.&nbsp; When
I did move out,</B>
<BR><B>back into the land of courts and human recourses, I made a final
stop at his</B>
<BR><B>house to ask what was going on. He told me that a the fifteen year
old son</B>
<BR><B>of the previous owners had killed himself after a fight with his
mother, and</B>
<BR><B>it was almost a month before they found him. He had hung himself
from the</B>
<BR><B>pipe in my room, and locked the door.</B>
<BR><B>Since then, I've lost my sense of smell.</B>

<P><B>A Quick Trip to a Desert</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lavender66@bigpond.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>This is short and sweet. My sister and i who have shared a special
bond most of out lives were standing on the bridge near our home waiting
for a bus. It was a regular type winters day, overcast but not raining.
We were standing side by side and of course as usual the buses were few
and far between. All of a sudden we were both standing in the middle of
what can only be described as a desert. It was vast, hot and dry. There
were we for a split second staring at each other , speechless with astonishment.
Then in a blink we were back on the bridge. We both asked "did you see
that' almost at once. She described to me what she had experienced, it
was exactly what i had experienced. Weird thing is after that moment i
doubt we discussed it again, almost as if we made some unspoken agreement
not to talk about it. Its so hard to explain, i would love to delve into
it further but i feel mentally drained to think about it. If we had not
shared this experience, i would have thought i had dreamt it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Visit From My Dad</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bwelbers@frontiernet.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My father was a big man, over 6 feet tall, and the picture of health.&nbsp;
He was a farmer who worked long days and was as strong as an ox.&nbsp;
On December 21, 1991, he very quietly slipped away in his sleep of a massive
heart attack at the age of 56.&nbsp; We had planned a family homecomeing,
my sisters were coming home from out of state for Christmas that year,
and he looked forward to the reunion.&nbsp; Instead of a reunion, we had
a funeral.</B>
<BR><B>I think the part that hurt the worst was no one got to say goodbye
to our beloved dad.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; all so unexpected.&nbsp; About the
following November, (I remember it was near my anniversay) I woke one night
to see my dad standing at the foot of my bed.&nbsp; He was wearing brown
slacks, a button front shirt, and brown dress shoes.&nbsp; This was his
going to town attire, not the usual t shirt &amp; farmer jeans I saw him
in most frequently.&nbsp; Dad told me that he would be visiting all 7 of
us kids, and would I kindly take care of my mom for him?&nbsp;&nbsp; I
told him that I would, and we said goodbye.</B>
<BR><B>I was sitting bolt upright with my back against the headboard, and
my husband sleeping next to me.&nbsp; I really feel this was no dream,
but my dad's way of saying goodbyes that did not get said.&nbsp; None of
my other siblings have reoported a visitation, and are still waiting.&nbsp;
Dad was a very religious man, and if he was given only one chance to return
to make a point, I think&nbsp; he chose to visit me because I was closest
to my mom, and would look after her.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Try to Explain this Situation</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MamaSmirf1279@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was about 5 years of age, my parents divorced and my father living
with his mother till he found a place.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can recall all of
this like it was just yesterday.&nbsp; I was in my aunt's room and because
of my aunt being the baby of the 6, her room was the smallest and pink
all around!&nbsp; Anywho, my aunt was out for the night and I wanted to
sleep in her room.&nbsp; The bed was parallel to the door which it was
open (being a little kid like the doors be open just a crack, mines was
wide open)!&nbsp; I was really knocked out until I felt this feeling I
cannot describe but I had to open my eyes to know why am I having this
eerie feeling.&nbsp; As I open my eyes, there in front of me was these
two red eyes, mean looking.&nbsp; It was in a dog shape kinda form but
there's no form you can see only those red mean eyes.&nbsp; The thing of
it is that I thought it might be a reflection from the moon hitting something
inside my aunt's room to make that reflect.&nbsp; But something was weird
about it and I couldn't put my finger to it.&nbsp; I studied it, looked
hard at it trying to figure out what was so weird about this so-called-reflection
then it hit me.&nbsp; This so-called-of-a-reflection was not even on the
door.&nbsp; It was midair and then my eyes just popped out.&nbsp; I did
not move, I couldn't speak, I couldn't do anything that's how scared I
was.&nbsp; Finally, I had the courage to move and ran right through it
and screamed to my father on the top of my lungs!&nbsp; Till this day I
haven't seen those eyes anymore.&nbsp; But believe you me, that's one hell
of a scary story to tell people!</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Cupboard</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cute_stuff2319@msn.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>HI, I am 12 years old. This had happened about the time I was between
7-9 years of age. I was at my home with my 2 younger brothers and a couple
of my friends. It was broad daylight and we were home alone. We were coloring
when I heard a noise. I didn't think to much of it, but then my friend
heard a noise in my cupboard. Soon enough everyone heard it. We though
it might be a rat or mouse, but was very unlikely because we'd barley even
get spiders and how would a rat get in a high cupboard. So me, being the
oldest (and bravest), went over to the cupboard and right as I was about
to open it I smelt this horrible stench. It smelt like an extremely old
omelet or something with eggs. I thought maybe my brother cut the cheese,
so I ignored it. I opened the cupboard and a plate started to shake rapidly.
I got freaked out and I did not see any "rat". My friends screamed and
said "Justine look!" All of the sudden I saw a puff of something like smoke.
It was the "size" of a baby. It floated over to another cupboard and was
gone. The smoke surprised me because 1st it was a summer day no fog and
2nd no one smoked. We never experienced like that and never had after.
It was a lifetime experience for all of us.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>SPRINGVILLE INN HAUNTING</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sweetghostly1@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello,</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Tammy. I just read the story on your site about the Springville
Inn in Springville, California being haunted. I am pleased to see that
someone else has finally realised it . I have had a couple of encounters
with the spirits at the Inn. I am so excited that it is finally being recognized
as a genuine haunted place. I never told anyone of my experiences at the
Inn for fear they would think me insane and take me to the state hospital
in Porterville.</B>
<BR><B>On the first encounter with the spirits of the Inn, I was there
with a friend of mine having drinks after dinner. I was walking to the
ladies room when I felt something very cold brush my hand. It felt like
a child trying to hold my hand. The intense cold of the touch startled
me and I quickly jerked my hand away.</B>
<BR><B>The next encounter I had was on a night when my neice , a couple
of her friends and myself stopped at the Inn for drinks before heading
down to Porterville to the club there. I was standing in front of the bar
waiting for the bar tender when I felt an extremely cold breeze as though
someone had just brushed against me. And then again a few seconds later
the same cold feeling as though someone were touching my arm in apology
for bumping against me. I knew after the first encounter that the Inn was
haunted , but it was the second encounter that reinforced this belief.</B>
<BR><B>I am so excited about the Springville Inn finally being recognized
as a true haunted building. I hope to return to the Inn sometime in the
future. Perhaps this time I'll meet another spirit dwelling there. One
can only hope!</B>
<BR><B>I want to thank you for your wonderful true ghost story site. I
return there time after time. Thank you also for taking the time to read
this email .</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Satanic church</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MEL21775@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One night me, my boyfriend and two of our friends were driving around
a part of central Illinois know as the "Lost Forties".&nbsp; It's called
this becasue you can literally drive around an get lost in a forty mile
radius.&nbsp; If your lucky enough to get lost, you will drive by the same
house several times no matter which way you turn.&nbsp; You always end
up back at the same spot until somehow you manage to get out.&nbsp; Also,
it is rumored that somewhere in this area is a satanic church.&nbsp; I
have lived in this area for all of my life, but had never been there.&nbsp;
We were driving around and my friend said it would be scary if we found
the church.&nbsp; I told everyone not to worry, because I would let them
know if we got close to the church.&nbsp; I was only joking around with
her.&nbsp; I had no clue where the church was.&nbsp; Well, my friend had
to go to the bathroom, so my boyfriend stopped the car so she could go.&nbsp;
This is common practice if you in the middle of the country!&nbsp; We were
in a two door car and she was in the backseat of the passenger side, so
I had to open the door and get out of the car to let her out.&nbsp; All
of the sudden I had this overwelming urge to get out of there.&nbsp; I
looked at her and told her to get back in the car.&nbsp; We had no time
to waste.&nbsp; It was like our lives were depending on it.&nbsp; I got
back in the car and just told my boyfriend to go.&nbsp; I was screaming
at them to go.&nbsp; I scared him bad enough that he hit the gas and rocks
flew as we got out of there.&nbsp; Right ahead of us was a bend in the
road.&nbsp; As we&nbsp; rounded the bend, we saw the church!&nbsp; I was
crying and trying not to throw up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we got back
into town we stopped at a local store so I could calm down and explain
what had happend.&nbsp; They of course had figured it out after we had
seen the church.&nbsp; The worst part of all of this is that while we were
sitting in the parking lot of the store I started having visions.&nbsp;
I was seeing what had happend in that church.&nbsp; It was not pretty!&nbsp;
I belive that a young man had been sacraficed and he somehow managed to
warn me to get myself and my friends out of there.&nbsp; I don't know if
this counts as a ghost story, but I just wanted to share my experience!</B>

<P><B>Well one night I was at my Uncle's farm in Brakston County W.V..
I was</B>
<BR><B>laying in my cousins bed and all the sudden I heard a real strange</B>
<BR><B>noise. It was coming from underneath the steps. It was like a banging</B>
<BR><B>noise.Like someone had a hammer and was banging on the steps. The
weird</B>
<BR><B>thing was that that mornig there was 2 people sitting in a white
truck</B>
<BR><B>with a rifle poked ot the window. The same people did the same thing</B>
<BR><B>that night that the banging started. I looked out the window again
and</B>
<BR><B>the truck was still there but the people were gone. So I dicieded
to go</B>
<BR><B>to bed and forget about it. And I dozed off about the time that
the</B>
<BR><B>banging started. And so I quietley tiptoed down the stairs. And&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>opened the door to the staircase and there was no one there. So
I looked</B>
<BR><B>all around in there. But there was no one there. So I closed the

<P><B>My Haunted Childhood</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PrettyInPunk0912@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Mary Kate</B>
<BR><B>One day, while I was in 6th grade, I traced back my family line
and came to a startling discovery: A history of psychic's and mediums run
in my family. Up until that point, I had thought that everyone was able
to do as I could -- see and sense ghosts, and predict things before they
happen. I didn't know any better...My uncle has the ability, and things
like this were always discussed openly in my family.</B>
<BR><B>Currently I live in Delanco, New Jersey, in a 25-year-old house
haunted by a ghost dog. It's a friendly little thing; I think it may be
white and tan in color. However, ghost dogs are a walk in the park compared
to what I spent 16 years of my Life with.</B>
<BR><B>I grew up in a house in the neighborhood of Port Richmond, located
in Philadelphia, PA. My house was over 75 years old, and a source of paranormal
activity. For as long as I could remember, any time I slept in the upstairs
middle bedroom, I'd have horribly graphic dreams about our neighborhood
burning down, being caught in World War II, and, the most chilling dream
I'd ever had while living there: A reenactment of the death of the boy
who died in my house. Sometimes these dreams blended into one another.
For instance: One night I dreamt that we were caught in WW2. We went down
to the basement, seeking shelter, and were greeted by the image of a boy
dressed in soldier's clothing, hanging from a rope tied around the pipe
in the front of the basement.</B>
<BR><B>Of course, growing up, no one believed that I experienced these
things. Only my Mother and Father testify to the night terrors I experienced
from sleeping in that room -- these lasted from the time I was about 2
until I was around 7 or 8. The night terrors were always the same: The
closet door in the middle room would slowly push open, I'd jump out of
bed, and something sinister would be chasing me down the stairs. My Mom
would be at the bottom, but I could never get to her. There were more than
a few occasions where I woke up screaming.</B>
<BR><B>However, some of these "night terrors" were actual, wide-awake experiences.
I can distinctly remember one night being shaken awake by god-knows-what,
and then watching, scared to death, as the closet door inched open. I ran
screaming downstairs, and it is that night that my Mom remembers like this:</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She was screaming and crying,
I could hear her running out of the room. Then</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the scariest thing I'd
ever experienced in that house occurred. It was like some</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evil force or evil SOMETHING
had pushed her down the steps from behind,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but something good was
holding her from the front. It was like she was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suspended
in the air, practically flying down the stairs. I didn't have time to think</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about what had happened
until later. When I finally realized how she'd gotten&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from her bedroom to the living room, I had to sit down -- my knees went
weak."</B>
<BR><B>As the years went on, my Mom drilled into my head that what I saw
or sensed was just my imagination. Ever-creative, she told me that I was
living in a fantasy world and I needed to snap out of it. So a mental block
landed right smack in the middle of my open-mindedness. However, this didn't
stop whatever spirits occupied my house. As I got older, run-ins were everyday,
but not as obvious. For instance, it would sound like someone was walking
around upstairs while no one was home except for myself. Though we did,
in fact, live in a townhouse, our next door neighbors on that side were
elderly, and could not continuously go up and down the stairs. Also, there
were some nights when it would sound like someone would come slowly across
the hall, and then the bathroom door would close, the toilet would flush,
but no one would ever come out.</B>
<BR><B>It was later that I learned my Aunt Katie had died in my room, the
back room. She was a funny, carefree woman, and I'm almost certain it was
her who protected me from hurtling down the steps when I was a child. The
middle room, however, was a different story. That room had sinister vibes
EMANATING from it. Even those who were not sixth sense inclined could feel
the undercurrent. It was strange, actually, because any time that someone
would go from my room (the back room) to downstairs, they would never look
into the middle room. They always did, though, rush past it. No one ever
wanted to look in there. At the same time, as we were avoiding looking
into the middle room, it was like our eyes were riveted to the front room.
For some reason, no matter who it was, everyone always stared into the
front room while coming down the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>I also found out later that a boy had hanged himself in our basement.
He had been an angry boy, teased by his schoolmates. When I went down to
investigate, I found part of an old, frayed rope still wrapped around the
very pipe I'd dreamt about the young soldier hanging from. Afraid of what
would happen if I removed it, I left it there. I'm sure it's still there
today.</B>
<BR><B>I was not the only one, however, who experienced things in my house.
My older sister was in the bathroom one time when she saw a black gloved
hand reach into the shower. She screamed bloody murder and it disappeared.
My Mom and Dad were the only two home, and they were downstairs. After
a thorough search of the house, absolutely nothing turned up. The hand
couldn't be explained. Another time, my sister came home after school to
an empty house, and heard the chilling noise of someone running their fingers
up and down the blinds in the back room. I had also heard this, and so
had the rest of my family. My oldest sister said that once she'd been home
by herself when she heard what sounded like someone laughing and dancing
upstairs in the back room. Being the brave one she is, she went to investigate.
And of course, as expected, nothing turned up.</B>
<BR><B>There were other occasions when friends of mine came to stay over
and found themselves catching glimpses of people passing by them. Upon
one occasion, my friend Melissa was in my bathroom. She set her deodorant
down on the sink, the label facing towards her. As she turned to the bathtub
to run her water, she heard something. Turning back around, she noticed
that her deodorant's label was facing in the opposite direction. Another
instance was when my friend Patricia stayed over. She said she woke up
one night to find herself staring at a grey-ish mist hovering over by the
infamous closet in the middle room. When she went to wake me up, it disappeared
and she was left questioning her own sanity.</B>
<BR><B>There are a million other stories I could share with you, but since
I'm sure you're quite busy as it is, I will end this e-mail here. We have
been living in this new house for almost two years now, and I still miss
"my ghosts" terribly. I was considering revisiting my house, but as we
didn't tell the new owners their new house was haunted, I'm not sure how
well it would go over if I showed up and said, "Hi. My name is Mary Kate,
and I used to live here. I was just wondering if I could talk to you about
whether or not you've experienced any ghosts yet."</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tydustinsilva@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, My name is Ty Silva and I live in Orangeville, Utah. It is
a small town with several other small towns nearby. I used to live in the
town of Castle Dale, when I lived there we lived on ghost road, a road
that knind of connects Orangeville and Castle Dale. There is only one house
on it that's right by the road itself, and that's the one me and my mom
lived in. Now you have to know some backround, my aunt and uncle owned
this house and that's why we got to move in. My uncle's grandpa used to
live in the house and he would hide money all throughout the house. In
pipes, ventilating systems, and various other parts of the house. When
we moved in sidewalks were cracked and other parts of the house taken apart
because family knew that he would hide money all over. When we initially
moved in, we didn't really notice anything supernatural happening. However
through out the few years we lived there we would hear footsteps in the
hallways outside our rooms, things in the kitchen would fall off the shelves
and crash to the floor, we didn't think much of this because we owned a
family of cats and there were plenty of strays in the area, we simply assumed
that somehow one of them had gotten into the house and knocked things over,
but whenever we got up and checked there would be no cats in the house.
Another interesting thing that would happen is that the buzzer on our oven
(the little clock like one) would go off in the middle of the night every
once in a while, we would usually just have to get up and turn it off.
This was strange, because the kitchen was situated right above the cellar,
which comes into play later in my account. These sort of instances went
on for about 2 years. One week we had had a lot of water heater problems,
so naturally we called my Uncle, who lived just down the street to come
see if he could fix it, while he was working down in the cellar, where
the water heater was, he found a jar of very old money in one of the air
vents, this was of course hidden by the old man. Around a week later, me
and my mom both had problems sleeping so she came into my room and asked
if I wanted to go sit on the porch outside, we went out and down in a small
clearing by our house, I saw something I will never forget, standing about
30-40 feet from us was a glowing figure, it was not real descriptive, we
could only see a straight looking figure with shoulders and a head, at
first we tried to make a reflection out of it, but after several minutes,
we decided there was nothing for it to be reflecting from. When I think
back, the whole experience sends chills down my spine, but I distinctively
remember feeling calm and peaceful, we probably watched it for about 10-20
minutes, it never moved we just kept watching it. We lived in the house
for another 4 months or so, and never heard it, saw it or had anything
else supernatural happen. Nothing much really happened with it until my
9th grade year. We had this teacher named Mr. Durrant, he was the geography
teacher, but was more known for his story telling abilities, stories from
his army experiences, urban legends, and local stories, one of the happened
to be about the ghost road, he never got around to telling that one, but
one day after class I approached him about it and told him how I used to
live in that house, he showed me a picture that stopped me dead in my tracks,
a picture of the ghost. It looked identical to the one I had seen. His
story about the ghost differs greatly, there is an urban legend about the
road, and how there used to be a hanging tree, where people were hanged.
I asked my Grandma about this and she said she never heard anything about
it and she has lived in the area for around 85 years. So I think the hanging
story is false. There are also accounts of several car accidents on the
ghost road, this is likely since there is a dangerous turn right at the
end of the road. My Cousin and his wife now live in the house, which has
been remodled and fixed up for a few years now, and to my knowledge the
ghost has left and no longer resides there. Our theory is that he simply
wanted his money found and once the last of it was he was able to mve on.
I can attest that this story is true. I was around 8 or 9 when it happened
and I am now 16. I go to school in Castle Dale now and every once in a
while I drive by the lonely looking house and remember the peaceful entity
that lived there. The house now seems peaceful and at rest. That was the
most supernatural thing that has ever happened to me and probably the most
supernatural thing that ever will happen to me, but I will never forget
it</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Little People</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: fran.hill@sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>As a member of a First Nation here in Canada, I have an interest
with anything having to do with our way of life, past and present. I have
seen ghosts, people who change from dark forms into a person like you and
me, makes me wonder if I'm cursed or something. Strange things seem to
happen to me when I least expect it, such as the story I will share with
you. My brothers and I hunt every fall for Moose, the meat will go a long
way in feeding our families, we provide food for those that cannot hunt
due to old age. One such hunting trip things were going as usual, we really
enjoy the time we spend together seeing that we all have families now and
live far from each other. We arrived at one of our spots that produces
almost every time, and I let my brothers off at two different spots, miles
from each other so the chance of running into each other is eliminated.
I drove quite a long while to a spot where I have killed two bulls before
and as usual parked the truck and prepared for our hunt, as usual I had
to leave tobacco. We always leave tobacco on four sides of a tree north,
east, south, and then west this is our offering to the elders who have
gone on before us and for the creator, to bring us luck on the hunt. I
thought for once I will skip this tradition and see what happens but changed
my mind and left it just in case I would jinx this hunt. I walked along
a trail while it was still pitch black out, only my flashlight guiding
me around trees and stumps, we do this so that when it gets light out,
we are in heart of Moose country. It started to drizzle lightly I welcome
the rain because it softens the ground making it very easy to move around
without being heard. The drizzle turned into a light rain so I took shelter
under a huge pine tree, I leaned back against it and turned off my flashlight.
Sometime you can hear them moving around in the sloughs in the dark, this
always brings a smile to my face. I waited, finally it was getting light
out, the rain was coming down softly now. I checked my rifle, checked my
gear and slowly started making my way along a trail. After about 15 or
20 minutes I came to bend in the trail, it was now starting to get nice
and light out, I stopped and used my binoculars to glass a slough on my
right. It was clear, so I stood there listening for any kind of movement.
It was then that something ran around the corner and stopped dead in its
tracks when it saw me. I could not believe my eyes, it was a man about
as high as my knee, he was covered in what seemed to be a animal fur, kind
of like a cape to keep him warm. He stood there for at least four seconds,
at this point I was frozen with a feeling of fear as well as astonishment.
We stood there looking at each other, he then turned and ran off the same
way he came, I watched him run on two legs with incredible speed. I stood
there, in the rain wondering what just happened here.</B>
<BR><B>After about ten minutes I decided to go further down the trail and
see what happens, my curiosity got the better of me. I tried looking for
prints but could not find any, I then remembered my mom telling me that
the little people were magical and that if I should ever see one that I
should leave them alone. I followed the trail around the bend and I sat
down and watched the trail that went further down and turned about 75 yards
toward the north. I sat there in the rain and decided that this must be
something bad and that I should go back to the truck and call my brothers
on their radios. Just then a huge cow Moose came running around the bend,
it stopped and turned broad side and looked back, like something chased
it there. I took one shot and flattened it on the spot, right behind the
head so that its over quickly. I often think about that morning, did that
little person bring me that Moose? I don't know, so I just wrote it off
as another strange event in my life so far. Thanks for taking the time
to read this.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Huntington High School</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Berserker268@Aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Huntington High School in Huntington Beach i think is haunted.
i never believed in ghosts, but when i was told by castodians and ambassadors
that a student who went there, George, a few years back, hung himself during
a play. he strugled to try to break free but nobody bothered to help him.
everyone thought he was acting. with his yelling and screaming, he eventualy
stopped. and George had died. and now his ghost haunts the Huntington High
School stage. actors have to fill out a warrenty before they preform and
put it on george's rope where he was hung. If the rope is removed during
the play, than the play is ruined. sometimes objects from backstage would
launch out onto the stage and strike the actors. and usualy, they would
forget their lines and often trip say when walking off stage while the
lights would also be flickering. anyways, my friend and i went to go get
a good picture of george. when we got on campus, we tried to be as quiet
as we can. one of the football lights in the stadium turned on (just one
of them) that did'nt bother us though. so instead of going up to the light
we shined our flashlights through the window where you can see the stage.
i could have promised you i saw something move, and i did. right when i
shined my light into the window, i saw something or someone duck down behind
the window i was looking through. i gasped, and my friend and me ran away
to our get-away car, and drove away. in the car, we told my dad what we
saw and he thought i was being chicken because of us running. i thought
he was gona fade through the window and get us. in a year from now ill
be going to that school. and ill get plenty more where that came from</B>

<P><B>By: IReeneeRN@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My brother, sister, 2 aunts and I grew up in a house that we believe
was haunted.&nbsp; Several of our friends back then would back these accounts.&nbsp;
This house was built in 1949.&nbsp; My mom, dad, maternal grandfather,
sister and I moved in around 1971.&nbsp; We lived there until 1982.&nbsp;
The previous owners were family members.&nbsp; My maternal great grandmother
had died in that house, in what was evenutally my mom's room.&nbsp; Within
1 year of moving there, my little brother was born, Feb, 1972.&nbsp; My
dad and mom divorced soon after that.&nbsp; In 1974 my maternal grandmother
died bringing my two aunts to our home.&nbsp; These were my mother's 1/2
sister's.&nbsp; They were the same age as my sister and me.</B>
<BR><B>We soon started noticing some strange happenings around the house.&nbsp;
I remember ALWAYS being afraid of the back stairs that led to the basement.&nbsp;
This was unfortunate as our bedrooms (the kids') were in the basement.&nbsp;
To get there you had to go through the kitchen and through a door that
passed right by the large windowed back door.&nbsp; Then down the stairs
to our room.&nbsp; It was always very dark and cold, even with the light
on.&nbsp; Often times this little light would burn out while we would be
going up or down the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>On one occasion, it was the middle of the night, I had to go to
the bathroom, which was upstairs.&nbsp; I was headed up when I glanced
out the back door window and saw a pair of red glowing eyes staring at
me (I can feel the goosebumps on my arms even now).&nbsp; I ran so fast
up the stairs and to my mom's room where I stayed the rest of the night.&nbsp;
My younger aunt and my brother also saw glowing eyes at the back door and
in the basement laundry room window.&nbsp; When mom would go to check,
there would be nothing there.</B>
<BR><B>There was a coat closet that was another place where weird happenings
occurred.&nbsp; This just happened to be located in the hall down from
my mom's room right next to my brother's room.&nbsp; This closet also had
a door in the ceiling that led to the unfinished attic.&nbsp; It was not
made to be a room, just for insulation.&nbsp; Often times, when I would
get into that closet, the little door in the ceiling would move.&nbsp;
The door to the closet would also pop open or slam shut when no one was
near it.</B>
<BR><B>The most horrifying event that occurred happened in 1976.&nbsp;
I was 10, my sister was 8 and we had a friend, Angie, that was spending
the night.&nbsp; We happened to be all laying in the living room trying
to go to sleep.&nbsp; From the living room, we could see through the dining
room, into the kitchen.&nbsp; Angie and I were still awake when what we
thought was my grandpa came up from the basement into the kitchen.&nbsp;
He often did that in the middle of the night to get coffee or water.&nbsp;
No lights were turned on, but it appeared as though the "person" got some
coffee, then went back out the kitchen door.&nbsp; We then heard the outside
door open and shut.&nbsp; This made us sit up in wonder as my grandpa never
went outside in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Mind you , this was about
1 or 2 a.m.&nbsp; The next thing we knew, something fell from the ceiling
and crashed to the floor.&nbsp; Angie and I ran into the kitchen, turning
on ALL the lights on the way.&nbsp; When we got in there, there was an
empty coffee cup laying broken on the floor.&nbsp; From where it was, there
was no possible way it fell from any counter or cupboard.&nbsp; It was
as if it had fallen from the light fixture in the middle of the ceiling.&nbsp;
We then went screaming to my mom's room.&nbsp; She came out, cleaned up
the cup, went down to find my grandpa sleeping.&nbsp; Needless to say,
we spent the rest of the night in her room on the floor.</B>
<BR><B>My mom was aware of all the "weird" goings on in that house.&nbsp;
There were lots of times when you could hear someone walking across the
floor or up and down the stairs when no one was there.&nbsp; These happenings
continued on through the years, even when we moved (those are some other
stories to be written later).&nbsp;&nbsp; These are not even close to all
of the occurances in the house.&nbsp; These are just some of the most memorable
ones.&nbsp; There were many small incidents such as flickering lights,
cold areas, strange noises, and our pets watching things that weren't there.&nbsp;
We still wonder today if any of these things are still going on now.&nbsp;
Although we tend to believe most of it has followed our mother every time
she moves as she continues to experience quite a bit of unexplainable things
happen</B>

<P><B>i have been seeing them as long as i can remeber i am now 27yrs old
trust me i wish i couldnt its extremely unnerving when the hairs on the
back of your neck hell all over your body start standing up, your skin
starts crawling n u feel so cold u could freeze ice cream. its not&nbsp;
a gift i enjoy but theres no sign of it going away, its all started i am
told by my mum when i was around 2 she would find me babbling away to myself
and all i would say is that i was talking to fred it carried on through
many years we moved a total of about 8 times each time fred would come
with us i never new anything different to i thought it was normal its reached
a boiling point when others started to come by this time i was about 13
fred seemed to keep most of them away i realize now he was protecting me,
but i was discriping members of my grandmas and grandads family that had
been dead for over 20yrs the worse was great granma prissie, she would
hang round in my bedroom for days moving things but eventually even she
went away i grew up and moved away to skegness england, by this time they
werent even bothering me but my fred was there (as u can imagine i am quite
fond of him) i always thuoght he was looking out for me and he was he proved
that. the reason i will tell u i was staying at my friends place overnight
caz told me not to sleep in the little bedroom but i said nothing will
happen, the room was tiny about the size of a broom cupboard there was
only a bed and a hot air heater , as soon as i entered i knew there was
something evil in there my throat felt like it was being crushed n it was&nbsp;
very hard to breathe but i conviced myself it was just my asthma playing
up, i got into bed n tried to get some sleep but next thing i knew i was
pinned to the bed it went freezing cold and i mean freezing cold fred,
fred appeared i was let loose by what ever it was that had me n i ran out
of the bedroom, then this sound i cant describe it echoed round the house
by this time i was in the living room, left the house and never went back
but the strange thing is that 3hrs had passed in the time it only seemed
ike seconds, the next day caz asked why i left in a rush, i told her i
didnt want to talk about it but the funny thing is it took fred 6months
to turn back up again after and also caz sold the house less than 2 months
after but refused to tell me why, you r the first people i have told this
to i dont mind the visitors i get but that was pure evil i think i dont
what wouldve happened if fred hadnt turned up</B><B></B>

<P><B>Drake stagecoach motel</B>
<BR><B>Freedom township, Portage county, OH</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was 18, I rented a house from my uncle for a few months.&nbsp;
It was good</B>
<BR><B>for both of us, as he needed someone to keep an eye on the house,
and I</B>
<BR><B>needed a cheap place to live.&nbsp; It was an old farmhouse, he
had bought from</B>
<BR><B>my grandmother shortly after my grandfather had passed away.&nbsp;
The house was</B>
<BR><B>in the historical society, being built in the late 1830's as a stage
coach</B>
<BR><B>motel in the middle of freedom township in Portage county, Ohio.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>original builder was William Drake, who had owned most of freedom
township</B>
<BR><B>at the time.&nbsp; The house was very large, around 6000 square
feet, and It had</B>
<BR><B>grey, weathered wooden siding on it, and a slate roof.&nbsp; A large
barn, in the</B>
<BR><B>same condition as the house was on the 57 acres of land occupied
by the</B>
<BR><B>home.&nbsp; When I moved in I stayed on the side of the house that
was somewhat</B>
<BR><B>remodeled to make it liveable.&nbsp; I locked off half of the house
to conserve</B>
<BR><B>heat, since the house wasn’t insulated.&nbsp; I didn’t have much,
and brought all</B>
<BR><B>my belongings, which basically consisted a foldout couch, a chair,
a desk,</B>
<BR><B>television and my cat on the first day I could live there.&nbsp;
The first night</B>
<BR><B>went smooth, enjoying the peacefulness only having your own home
can</B>
<BR><B>provide.&nbsp; When I arrived home on the second night from my 2nd
shift job, I</B>
<BR><B>noticed that my cat had went to the bathroom under my desk.&nbsp;
I figured that</B>
<BR><B>it wasn’t used to its new surroundings, and left it at that.&nbsp;
Later just as</B>
<BR><B>I was about to fall asleep, I heard a loud SLAM!&nbsp; Not knowing
what I had</B>
<BR><B>heard, and probably being braver than I should have been, I grabbed
my</B>
<BR><B>aluminum bat, and my six cell maglight and went through the entire
house.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing.</B>
<BR><B>My cat was with me, so it couldn’t have knocked anything over, so
my only</B>
<BR><B>thought was my drunken uncle was messing with me.&nbsp; So, I went
to bed,</B>
<BR><B>pulling the covers over my head and rolling in them, to the point
I looked</B>
<BR><B>like a large pig in a blanket.&nbsp; I was terrified.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I never said anything,</B>
<BR><B>and started cleaning up the ten years of accumulation of old junk,</B>
<BR><B>newspapers, paint cans, and everything else you could imagine from
upstairs</B>
<BR><B>to finish building the walls in my to-be bedroom.&nbsp; After a
few days, all</B>
<BR><B>that was left upstairs was an old chair that belonged to my great</B>
<BR><B>grandfather, who had died in the house.&nbsp; I left it there because
it was very</B>
<BR><B>old, and my family wanted to keep it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; SLAM!&nbsp; I’m awakened again.&nbsp; I go through the house,
maglight in one hand,</B>
<BR><B>my bat in another.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; For about three weeks this
went on, meanwhile,</B>
<BR><B>I had noticed my cat has been acting weird.&nbsp; Its been under
my desk every</B>
<BR><B>time I came home, so I checked to see what’s under there.&nbsp;
I seen that it</B>
<BR><B>had been using the area under my desk as a litter box, so I put
the pan</B>
<BR><B>under the desk, along with its food and water.&nbsp; I asked my
parents what</B>
<BR><B>could be going on.&nbsp; My father said that since the house was
built so long</B>
<BR><B>ago, that maybe the dowel pins that hold the roof beams in place
are coming</B>
<BR><B>out, and I asked my mother to see if my uncle was messing with me,
but he</B>
<BR><B>wasn’t.&nbsp; I had my father check the pins, and they were all
good and in</B>
<BR><B>place.&nbsp; The next night was a Saturday, and I got out of work
at 5:00 PM.</B>
<BR><B>When I come home I sat down on the couch, and my cat came to me.&nbsp;
It was</B>
<BR><B>always affectionate when I came home, so when I pet the cat, I noticed
it</B>
<BR><B>had pissed itself, and had it all over is backside and belly.&nbsp;
SLAM!&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>time I was wide awake, and it sounded like the noise came from directly</B>
<BR><B>above the kitchen, which was in the spare room.&nbsp; The cat jumped
off my desk</B>
<BR><B>and ran into the kitchen.&nbsp; I grabbed my bat and maglight, and
went right</B>
<BR><B>upstairs, to finally confront this.&nbsp; When I got to the top
of the stairs I</B>
<BR><B>looked into the room, and all I seen was my great grandfathers chair.
The</B>
<BR><B>hair stood up on my neck, and I was terrified as I ran down the
stairs,</B>
<BR><B>locking the door behind me as I made it to the bottom.&nbsp; Where’s
my cat?&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>ran into the kitchen, which adjoined the living room, and my cat
was running</B>
<BR><B>in a circle looking up at the ceiling, hissing, and screaming; about
where</B>
<BR><B>the chair had sat.&nbsp; My heart was pounding in my chest, adrenaline
running</B>
<BR><B>through my veins.&nbsp; I ran out to may car and got in, not even
taking the time</B>
<BR><B>to close the door.&nbsp; I left my cat inside.&nbsp; I sat there
for about thirty</B>
<BR><B>seconds.&nbsp; What am I doing?&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran in, grabbed my
cat and ran out the door,</B>
<BR><B>slamming it as if something were going to come out and attack me.&nbsp;
I went</B>
<BR><B>back the next day, but I never brought my cat back.&nbsp; I got
rid of the chair,</B>
<BR><B>and never heard the sound again.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My uncle ended up selling the house, making the buyer sign
a paper that the</B>
<BR><B>house will be destroyed, and never assembled again.&nbsp; I’m curious
as to what</B>
<BR><B>happened to him.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Childhood Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:SDivido@nc.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've never sent a story before, but after having read
so many that sound so familiar I thought I would. Maybe I've found people
who won't laugh at me. My earliest 'experience' was of seeing two people
coming down the stairs of the farmhouse where I grew up. I was in our dining
room playing with my brother when I looked up and saw them. There was a
man and a woman.&nbsp; They looked like they were looking over the house
and I remember the woman looking pleased at what she saw. Then, she looked
up and 'noticed' me. She touched the man's arm to show him, and that's
when I went screaming for my mother. Of course by the time she arrived
they had vanished. My brother has no recollection of this (or so he says).
We had the usual disappearing belongings, most of which never turned up
again. Also, I always had the feeling of never being alone in the house.
I would say the most notable episodes were when I woke up in the middle
of the night needing to use the bathroom and heard an eerie groaning downstairs.
Needless to say I didn't go down. Other times I would go into my bedroom
and turn on the lights only to find they would'nt work or turn on to dim
out slowly. I would yell for my dad , but by the time he would get there
the lights would be normal again. Most memoable to is the time I woke up
in the morning, just lying there lazily like people do, when I noticed
something that looked like a knife blade suddenly appear beside my head
on the right side of my bed and ,with a sawing motion, 'cut' its way around
to the left side, disappearing again. I waited a few moments before I ran
downstairs to tell my dad, but of course, he did'nt believe me. Weird thing
is, I have now been disowned by my family. Was this a premonition of being
'cut out?'</B>

<P><B>By: vpolice@crsville.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello,</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Rodney and I have been a police officer in a small Ohio
village for over 18 years and have a story I would like to tell:</B>
<BR><B>In 1996 my wife and family and I lived in a small older model mobile
home in a three trailer court. My neighbor and I have been friends for
several years ( over 30 ) and he lived at that time in a similar style
mobile home. His mother passed on in 1988 suddenly and his father passed
four months later exactly to the day. Now as I stated, in 1996 we were
living in the adjacent mobile home. We started having severe electrical
problems finally culminating in the entire mobile home having to be re-wired.
It was early summer, which meant that it was starting to get hot and muggy
if you're familiar with Ohio summers. In the process of changing out the
wire in the trailer we had to replace several pieces of paneling. One hot
afternoon, my friend Kenny, also an officer with our department was working
a table saw cutting paneling while my other friend John, also an officer
with our department was doing some wiring inside the mobile home. Once
Kenny turned off the saw, he and I and my wife heard a loud " whoosh "
sound followed by a louder bang. Now mind you these mobile homes were separated
by about 10 to 12 feet lined up end to end. I said to Kenny what is that
and he advised that he did not know. It was at this time my wife Sheri
advised that it was in the back of our neighbors trailer. It was at this
time that Kenny and I looked and the curtains in the rear of the next mobile
home were just flying all over the place as though there were a fan on
them. We ( Kenny and I ) hollered for John and he came out as well. We
all three ran to the rear window of the mobile home ( which was the master
bedroom ) and looked up into the window to see the doorway entrance to
the bedroom from the hallway slamming back and forth causing the air movement
to make the curtains move. Now I knew that my friend was at work and so
was his new wife and their cars were both gone as well. It was at this
time we all decided that there must be someone in the residence and as
cops do, grabbed our guns and proceeded to surround the home. All the while
this door slamming was still going on. I headed for the front entrance
and Kenny went to the back entrance while John kept watch in the window
trying to see anyone that might be causing the incident to continue. I
tried to open the front door and it was locked. I yelled to Kenny advising
him the front door was secure and he advised me the same for the back door.
At this time John yelled " It Stopped " and we then ran back to the window
only to see curtains. the drapes now obscured the view enough that you
could no longer see in the room. The windows in these early seventies trailers
are three and four paneled and no one but a child could possibly fit through
them and a small one at that. They had cats, but we ruled them out and
also ruled out his central air as I had never seen it cause this type of
disturbance before. Needless to say we decided to quit work for the day
and closed down our operation.</B>
<BR><B>Later that day, around five or so my neighbors wife came home and
pulled into their driveway. I caught her and advised her that we thought
that someone had been in their trailer earlier at which point she cut me
off with a " WHY! " I then proceeded to tell her of the days events and
she then advised me that she was not going back into the trailer. I said
that it will be OK, just let me look around inside and check it out...She
handed me the keys and said " check it out, I'm not F------ staying here.
She then proceeded to run back to her vehicle and left me standing on the
porch. I said wait just a minute which she relented and did. I then opened
the door and their cats came barreling out of the door. I went to the living
room area and all appeared fine. I then worked my way down the hall and
went toward the master bedroom. the door was open, and to my surprise had
a wedge under the door to keep it open, and it was wedged tightly. By this
time I'm having internal arguments about what and why I saw what I saw.
Anyway, I spoke to my neighbors wife and told her it was all clear. She
advised me she did not care and was not staying there. She said that she
would contact her husband from her mothers house and then follow him home
when he got off work. She then backed out of their driveway and left me
in a cloud of dust, standing their with the house keys and an open house.
I then proceeded to lock their home and returned to my own residence.</B>
<BR><B>Around 12:30 that same evening my neighbors came to my home and
he asked me what had happened. I told him and then asked him why his wife
was so afraid to stay there as we are just next door. He then advised that
they had been having " problems " with the trailer for some time. I said
problems? and he then advised that they had been seeing things, hearing
things and that the cats had been acting crazy. He never said the magic
word " Ghosts " as he knew I would be skeptical and he even was somewhat
skeptical even though he experienced it himself. After this incident I
am less skeptical than I used to be. We can not explain what happened over
there that day and we were all experienced, well trained police officers
and all still are today. We don't know what happened, but we are more open
minded about this type of phenomenon and my neighbor related other stories
to me which made me " goosebumpy " and I have had at least one other minor
experience myself.</B>

<P><B>Hi my name is amber and i have had many ghostly encounters. I have
three that stand out.</B>
<BR><B>The house that i live in now(in Plano TX) in the small bedroom there
have been many happenings. It used to be my sisters room, but she wouldnt
sleep in there or even go into the room without the light on. I traded
rooms with her and found out why she didnt like it. the first night i woke
up to a little girls giggling. I hear scratching on the walls all the time
and if the lights go off the furniture gets moves and books and stuffed
animals stacked in weird ways. the first night i had my tv in there(unplugged)
the tv turned on and a little girl appeared, laughed and disappeared. the
closet door will never open, and when it does a cold rush of air blows
out. I havent had many problems since we turned on the light in the closet,
but i do occasionally wake up to her laughter and her playing with dolls
and stuffed animals.</B>
<BR><B>In oklahoma on lake murray, we stayed in a cabin where we had our
own dock to the water. one night about ten of us decided to go out on jet
skiis in the pitch dark. half way out i began to see ghosts float out and
hover above the water. i finally convinced my friends to go back to the
dock. once at the dock we all sat in camping chairs talking. half were
faced toward the water and half were faced away from the water. i had been
faced toward the water, and the ghosts continued to hover over the water.
we all continued talking when a boy floated up behind the person in front
of me. i told him to get up and walk toward me. he hesitated and the boy
lifted his arm. then i screamed at my friend to get up. as he did, the
boy knocked over his chair into the water. of course every one got up and
ran, but still anytime i visit lake murray at night, the ghosts sill hover
the water.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, the first house we moved into(plano again) was a few houses
away from the Bowman cemetary. The land had been a plantation, and it was
said that where the slaves fell they stayed...meaning they werent buried
unless they were important. within that house, mirrors broke, initials
showed up on the mirrors in the bathroom and many ghosts were seen. we
had a long hallway that branched off into our rooms, but the end of the
hallway was a short wall. anytime i would turn to walk down the hallway
i would see one of four ghosts. there was a chained slave, a woman with
a big fruit hat, and older man with a beard, and the one i saw the most
was thirteen year old timothy. he appeard many times at the end of the
hall, and i would wake up in the middle of the night and he would be standing
at the end of my bed staring at me. After showers in the foggy mirrors
there would be his initials above mine in a heart. i finally went to the
cemetary and looked at the tombstones. i found out that his name was timothy
and he was 13 when he died. i never found out what had happened to him,
but when i drive by there he is always outside waving at me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tyson63116@prodigy.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I grew up in the Ironton/Pilot Knob area and there are a lot of strange</B>
<BR><B>occurrences that happened to me and my family.&nbsp; As you know,
the</B>
<BR><B>Ironton/Pilot Knob area is famous for the Civil War Battle of Pilot
Knob at</B>
<BR><B>Fort Davidson.&nbsp; I grew up in Ironton about a half mile from
the battlefield</B>
<BR><B>as we know it.</B>
<BR><B>Our house was new but it did not take long for strange things to
start.</B>
<BR><B>While we were moving into the house, my older sister (who was alone
in the</B>
<BR><B>house) was in her room unpacking when she heard footsteps (on carpet
no</B>
<BR><B>less) and a misty gray figure walk down the hall and dissipate into
a wall.</B>
<BR><B>She was freaked out and left the house.</B>
<BR><B>My whole families first experience was an awakening for all.&nbsp;
My sister had</B>
<BR><B>come home from a date about 12:00.&nbsp; I was awake, reading in
my room, and</B>
<BR><B>heard the front door open, she went into her room then into the
bathroom (my</B>
<BR><B>room was next to the bathroom). After leaving the bathroom, she
went back to</B>
<BR><B>her room and closed the door.&nbsp; About two minutes later, we
All heard a crash</B>
<BR><B>in the front of the house.&nbsp; We all got up and walked into the
living and my</B>
<BR><B>mother noticed that her 2 foot tall Beer Stein was missing.&nbsp;
It sat on</B>
<BR><B>table, alone, in the corner next to the dinning wall.&nbsp; My Mom
walked around</B>
<BR><B>the corner and the stein was smashed on the dinning room floor.&nbsp;
It freaked</B>
<BR><B>us all out.</B>
<BR><B>My first experience, I was alone in the sister's room, stealing
her clothes</B>
<BR><B>while she was out of the house, when I saw the gray figure walk
down the</B>
<BR><B>hall and walk into the wall.</B>
<BR><B>After my sister got married and moved out, I moved into her room
because</B>
<BR><B>mine always cheeped me out.&nbsp; It was after a church service
and I had a</B>
<BR><B>friend over, we were listing to music and talking when we heard
HEAVY</B>
<BR><B>footsteps coming up the stairs.&nbsp; My Dad was do back soon, so
I stuck my head</B>
<BR><B>out and said "Dad, is that you?"&nbsp; No one answered but I thought
nothing of</B>
<BR><B>it because my dad is hard of hearing.&nbsp; A few minutes later,
we heard the</B>
<BR><B>garage door open, HEAVY footsteps on the steps and the TV turn on.&nbsp;
Dad was</B>
<BR><B>home.&nbsp; My friend was so shaken up buy what had happened, she
want to go home</B>
<BR><B>immediately and never came over again.</B>
<BR><B>A lot of stuff happened in that house and there is not enough time
in the</B>
<BR><B>day to explain everything but the freakiest thing that ever happened
to me</B>
<BR><B>was in an old Episcopal church that dates from the Civil War era.</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother lived across the street from the church and living
in a very</B>
<BR><B>small town the church was left open day and night.&nbsp; When my
sister and I</B>
<BR><B>were little spending the night a Granny's, we would here the church
bell</B>
<BR><B>ring in a strange sequence in the middle of the night.&nbsp; One
night it seemed</B>
<BR><B>to go on forever and even woke up Granny.&nbsp; So we all put to
out robes and</B>
<BR><B>went across the street to the church--their was no one there and
if there</B>
<BR><B>were, we would have seen them run away. Granny went to the pastor
of the</B>
<BR><B>church and told him about the bells, he dismissed it but other neighbors</B>
<BR><B>complained too.&nbsp; The pastor gave Granny a key and asked her
to lock up the</B>
<BR><B>church at 8:00 pm every evening.&nbsp; So she did, every night except
when she</B>
<BR><B>was out of town then the responsibility went to me since I was old
enough to</B>
<BR><B>drive.</B>
<BR><B>I was eighteen and my parents had taken Granny to my Aunt's house
in</B>
<BR><B>Arkansas, so I on my own.&nbsp; I had been at a party that night
but while I was</B>
<BR><B>driving home I realized that I had not locked up the church.&nbsp;
So I drove</B>
<BR><B>over there and was walking up to lock the doors when I heard noises
coming</B>
<BR><B>from inside.&nbsp; So, I walked in the Fourier and turned on the
lights, poked my</B>
<BR><B>head in and no one was there from what I could see.&nbsp; I walked
in and walking</B>
<BR><B>toward the alter it got very cold ( it was a hot summer night in
August).</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly a deep voice said "Get out of hear NOW!" and something
from the</B>
<BR><B>alter fell to the floor.&nbsp; I ran out so fast the I left the
lights on and</B>
<BR><B>didn't lock the door.&nbsp; I went back the next morning and all
seemed fine.</B>
<BR><B>When Granny was out of town from then on I locked the doors a 5:00
pm and</B>
<BR><B>never went there after dark.</B>
<BR><B>The whole area is haunted.&nbsp; My sister lives in a house that
they built,</B>
<BR><B>which is a stones throw from the battlefield and there is some weird
stuff</B>
<BR><B>that happens there too.</B>
<BR><B>If you want a good scare, the former convent school, Ursiline Academy
is now</B>
<BR><B>a bed-no-breakfast &amp; antiques mall.&nbsp; I went to nursery
school there.&nbsp; That</B>
<BR><B>place freaked me out then and last year when I was down there, my
friend and</B>
<BR><B>I went to antiques section and it still freaks me out.</B>

<P><B>My Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: eckogurl1989@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Hi my name is raven.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My ghost story takes place at my old house.
Remember this is real!</B>
<BR><B>It all started when i was getting readdy for school early one morning.</B>
<BR><B>I was putting my hair up and all of a sudden somethig started calling
my name, i have no</B>
<BR><B>brothers or sisters and my mom was at the gym. So then i started
to panic. So i looked out</B>
<BR><B>of the window and saw no one. So after that i thought nothing of
it. Well all of a sudden something</B>
<BR><B>grabbed me by my hair and pulled me back. I was freaked i paniced
once more and and looked around the room and found myself all alone. Later
that day it finally hit me that it was prbobly a</B>
<BR><B>ghost. this was not the only experience that i have had.!!!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second was at my grandma's house when we still
had the dog. Her name was Samantha</B>
<BR><B>and she was very old . We were watchingt.v. and my grandma and i
looked over and we both saw it.</B>
<BR><B>it was a dog that looked the very same as samantha. then my grandma
said Sam wants to go outside</B>
<BR><B>then i looked over in the other room and there was the real samantha
lying on the floor i looked back and the other dog was gone then she said
are you gonna let her out and i said grandma sam is laying in the dining
room we were both positive of what we saw and kind of scared. I have one
more encounter.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This encounter is at where i live now. The first summer
i moved here it was very creepy. esspscialy in my room it always felt as
if there was someone else in the room with me. The doors would rattle and
it would get very cold and weird. really quiet, to quiet. I have only lived
here for almost a year. And i am not sure if i am readdy for another creepy

<P><B>Vicki</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: davidandruby@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>In February of 1976 a friend of mine (Vicki) was murdered just 3
weeks before reaching her 21st birthday.&nbsp; I was 18 at the time and
this was the first time I had lost someone that I was especially fond of.&nbsp;
Her death had an amazing impact on me and for the remainder of 1976 I tried
to escape the grief through drugs and alchohol. Several times throughout
the year I would visit her unmarked grave for a few minutes to reminise
about old times.&nbsp; One day in February of 1977 ( a year had passed
since her death), a friend of mine had spent the day with me and we had
three different encounters of Vicki's family and friends. It seemed kinda
strage to run into all of these people when I had not seen them since the
funeral.&nbsp; Later that evening I asked my friend if he would go with
me the next day to the cemetery to see if Vicki's head stone had been placed.
I wanted to find out what day her birthday was on so I could bring her
some flowers.&nbsp; My friend said he would go with me. I dropped him off
at his house and told him I would pick him up the next morning.&nbsp; I
got home and got ready for bed. When I turned my light off in my room and
climbed into my bed, I lay there for about two minutes facing my bedroom
wall.&nbsp; I then turned over to face my bedroom door and that it when
I had this remarkable experience. Over in the corner of my bedroom, Vicki
appeared to me. She was not floor level, but her head was close to the
ceiling as if she was floating. She was all in white and there didn't seem
to be any feet, just a dissapating mist. On each side of her was a slanted
column (like you would see on the front of a southern style antebellum
home). She (and the columns) were glowing and she was smiling the most
radiant and joyous smile. I sat up in bed and called her name. This image
only lasted for about 20 or 30 seconds. I have never understood the significance
of the "columns". She never spoke to me. But the second that her image
vanished, all the grief I had carried for over a year vanished with her
and I was able to finally accept her death and know that she was extreemly
happy in her new life. The next morning I picked up my friend and went
to the cemetery. Her headstone was down and her birthday was the next day!
I ordered some flowers and went back the next morning and placed them on
her grave. Several times after this incident I would concentrate on her
and hope that she would re-appear to me, but she never has. I truly believe
that her only purpose to appear to me was to let me know she was o.k. and
that I should get on with life.</B>
<BR><B>I did not share this story with anyone for a long time because of
the obvious. I figured they would say I was seeing things. I know it was
real and that is all that matters. I have since worked in the funeral business
and have found out through some of the families that I have dealt with
that these things happen a lot more often than most people realize.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Old Man</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DwN2EaRtHChuLa@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I live in Michigan in a nice house. I'm not sure how old it is.
I don't think it's more than 60 or 70 years old though. Anyway, I'm 19
now. We moved into this house when I was 12. I've always been interested
in ghosts and things like that. I kind of like the scared feeling I guess.
I believe that there is a man in our house. He isn't mean or scary or anything
like that. Before we ever "saw" anything, we noticed things. At one point
we had a very large entertainment center, and everything was connected
behind it. The only way to unplug anything was to have 2 people move the
stand. One day my Mom and I were watching TV when it turned off by itself.
I grabbed the remote and tried to turn it back on, but I couldn't. I tried
turning on the radio, and the VCR. They wouldn't turn on either. My Mom
and I carefully moved the stand and when we looked behind it, we saw that
everything had been disconnected from the power strip. It kind of freaked
us out because we had just been watching TV. After that we started seeing
things. Our living room and dining room are connected, and there's a doorway
that leads to the kitchen from the dining room. We installed a door there,
but it's only half a door, so you can still see over the top of it. From
almost every spot in our living room you can see into the kitchen. When
we would see things it would be a hazy black shape moving from the basement/back
door area through the kitchen to the upstairs. Nobody ever denies what
they see when they come to our house. Too many people have seen him to
deny it. I used to be afraid, until one night I had a dream about an old
man. He was tall, pale and had white hair just above his shoulders. He
didn't talk to me or anything like that. He was just there. I had been
sleeping on the couch that night and in my dream it was as if I was awake
and seeing him there. Something told me not to be afraid of him. He seemed
more like he was watching out for us after we acknowledged him. When my
little brothers were 3 and a few months old we realized that he made himself
known to them too. My 3 year old brother came down stairs carrying the
baby. When we asked him what he was doing he said, " The baby was crying,
so the man upstairs got him out for me." Meaning out of the crib. There
was no way that my 3 year old brother could have gotten the baby out alone.
We always see him walking through the kitchen during the day. And when
he's around you can feel his presence. I used to have a room on the second
floor. Whenever I would leave I locked the door with a skeleton key. It
was always loud. One night my Mom's husband got out of bed and asked us
why we had came home and left again at such a late hour. We asked him what
he meant. He said an hour before he heard what he thought was me turn on
the light, run up the stairs, unlock my door and move around in my room.
Then he heard "me" go out, close the door, lock it again, go back down
the stairs, and turn off the light. It wasn't me though because I had just
gotten home. After that my mom's husband got scared and asked his sister
in Mexico to send some holy water. He sprayed it around the house and did
his thing. For a long time we didn't see the man. Then one day I felt him
again. I think this was around the time that I found out I was pregnant.
I think that's why he came back. I'm 8 1/2 months now. I'm not worried
that he'll hurt my baby, I believe he's here to watch out for her. He still
"watches over" my littlest brother. I find my brother talking to and playing
with his "friend" a lot. My brother says his friend is an old man, but
he's nice to him. Recently a few of my family members were here and we
started talking about ghosts. You could feel him in the room with us. My
Mom, my Grandpa, and I all gave the same description of him that day. None
of us had ever told anybody that we could describe him. To others he still
appears as the hazy black shape. I feel kind of special that he revealed
himself to me first in my dream. My Mom used to work with a man who knew
the original owners of the house. He said that something sad had happened
here a long time ago, but he wouldn't go into detail because he didn't
want us to worry. Then he told her not to worry because the man that lives
here with us was a good man in life. I wanted to ask him about it, but
by the time my Mom told us what he said, he had already died. Lately, I've
been seeing black circular things floating for a split second then they
disappear. I've also seen white things. I don't know what they are but
they are so bright they resemble white/silver glitter while light is shown
on it. They too also disappear after a second. It only occurs in the living
room. I'm not really sure why I seem to be the one who sees and feels most
of the things here. But it's like that where ever I go. Sometimes I get
such bad vibes and uneasy feelings from other people's houses that I cannot
go back anymore. When I tell people that they have a guest in their house
they think I'm joking, until they come to mine.</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I was sitting down in my living room watching
TV. I was getting ready to go up to my bed room so I could go to bed. I
turned around and saw a beautiful bride walking up the stairs holding the
bible. She was not harming me and I did not think much about it so I went
to sleep. A few months later I was going in the kitchen to make dinner
an d I saw a little boy looking up at me. All of a sudden he disappeared.
I have not had any more problems with these ghosts lately, but now every
Friday the thirteenth there are little black figures crawling on the floor!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Scary Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gixerman@odyssey.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dear Shadowlands,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used
to live in Groton, NY and wierd things happened a lot that me or my mother
couldnt explain. When we first moved in i was downstairs wathing tv and
my mom was in the upstairs hallway hanging up pictures. She didnt want
to tell me at the time because she didnt want to scare me. After we moved
out she told me that when she was hanging the pictures up the hall light
kept going off so she would go over and turn it back on and it would turn
off again. It wasnt just the power because my mom saw the light switch
move on and off. Another time we experienced this type of thing was when
i was in the bathroom getting into the shower i heard my gramma yell my
moms name...... at 6:00 in the morning! so i put a towel around me and
went downstairs and asked my mom if gramma was just here. my mom goes "You
heard it to?" and my gramma wasnt even at our house. Also when i lived
there i slept in my moms room and i always had a polar bear stuffed animal
on a chair next to my side of the bed. When me and my mom went up to bed
that night we couldnt find it. Then about 10 minutes later my mom found
it on the other side of the room shoved behind a box! I think thats pretty
scary!!!!!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>My House On Arlington St.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: glennlarocque@shaw.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>My house is hauted by a little boy, his mother and a friend.Well
it all started when one day I was looking for something in my closet and
something told me to look to my left and threre was a little boy sitting
there and he waved at me, another time was when me and my siblings we're
going to sleep in the basement and my dad sleeps on the couch but from
the basement you can hear when someone gets on or off of the couch and
no one got off the couch. Some one was walking from the hall and up to
the basement door and when they got there they would turn the lights on
and off very rapidly. In the basement again. I was sleeping down there
and it was only me and my dad there plus I was sleeping down there because
it was a hot night and all the lights were off and the windows were covered
with pillows because of a perverted next door neighbor. But anyways I saw
two people fighting then I saw a person getting stabbed and then I saw
orbs flying around and then something touched my leg.</B>
<BR><B>Well there's alot more stories but I can't tell all of them.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;My Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Maurice.Covington@lnd.amedd.army.mil</B><B></B>

<P><B>Before I get into my story, I really enjoy this website.&nbsp; This
is a great website to see and read others experiences in the supernatural.
I myself has been a fan of the supernatural.&nbsp; I had a couple of experiences
during my childhood that I would love to share.&nbsp; My first that I can
remember happened in Dec 89.&nbsp; It was the day we buried my grandmother.&nbsp;
I was really close to my granny.&nbsp; I didn't take the death real hard
but it was still a toll on me. Anyway, after the reception at the church;
my sister and I went back to my granny's house to get some rest.&nbsp;
We had a house full of people that were staying over.&nbsp; Now my granny
house is a 1 bedroom house.&nbsp; The very front of the house is the living
room with a old coal heater that use to heat up the house.&nbsp; Well this
is important that you understand the house dimensions.&nbsp; Now it was
about 9 ro 10pm and my sister got real stuffy in the living room for some
reason so I told her to go in the back room so she can breathe a little
better.&nbsp; So this left me in the Living room by myself.&nbsp; Being
bored and wide awake we had a kerosene heater in the middle of the floor
and I started making hand puppets with my shadow.&nbsp; Well I looked over
to the corner of my eye and I saw a shadow come from behind the old coal
heater.&nbsp; Usually if it gets real cold in the house, you can sit behind
the heater and warm up.&nbsp; It was nothing uncommon to see family members
get behind the old heater but this particular night the heater wasn't turned
on.&nbsp; Well being that I come from a comical family I started calling
out the names of all that was in the house.&nbsp; But when I waited for
a response no answered.&nbsp; I started to freak out by this point because
the shadow was still behind that heater.&nbsp; So I got enough courage
to look fully of the shadow and it was the split image of my grandmother.&nbsp;
I pulled the covers over my head and went to sleep.&nbsp; The next morning
I told everyone what happen and of course nobody believed me.&nbsp; The
next one was my Uncle Buddy.&nbsp; Uncle Buddy lived right next door to
my granny's house.&nbsp; He had a very big house and I always spent time
over the house just to get away from my parents and cousins.&nbsp; Uncle
Buddy always enjoyed my company and was a kind man.&nbsp; Well he had passed
in 85.&nbsp; Well I was in my granny kitchen one night fixing me a glass
of water, and I looked out the window across to Uncle Buddy's house.&nbsp;
Now the way the house is position there are 3 big windows.&nbsp; One on
the 3rd floor and 2 on the 2nd floor.&nbsp; At night, the light from the
street light would illuminate the windows.&nbsp; Well I was fixing my water
and I looked at Uncle Buddy's 3rd floor window and noticed something was
looking back at me.&nbsp; As I looked closer it was the face of my Uncle
Buddy.&nbsp; I ran out the kitchen and told my mom and dad what happened.&nbsp;
Of course they blow it off until a couple of years later after my granny's
death one of my Aunt's had seen his face in the window to.&nbsp; They boarded
up all the windows to this day and I haven't heard anything about more
sightings.&nbsp; I got more stories.&nbsp; I'll definitely have to write
some more.&nbsp; Thanks for reading</B><B></B>

to my side of the bed, he was dressed in a dark raincoat &amp; hat &amp;
i thought i must have been dreaming; so i closed my eyes, when i reopened
them, he was still there. i let out a blood curdling yell! my boyfriend
made fun of me the next day, but i was still scared. i have no idea who
or what it was, but i know i saw something. i do see fragments of people
&amp; things to this day, but never as clear as that.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LurvlyLady123@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Okay here goes......My house is situated on top of an old army base
and is right next to an old train station.We are the first people to live
in this house as it is quite new.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Often at night me and my sister (we share a bedroom) see
a middle aged man stood by our bedroom door, the first time we saw him
i thought he was my dad because all I could see was his siloutte, he was
quite a well built man. I called out to him and he walked right over to
me bed and stared at me,as I got a closer look I realised he wasn't my
dad and I screamed, the figure dissapeard at that point. I see him quite
a lot and since he has never threatened me I am no longer scared of him,
I even say hello to him when he arrives (usually at about 12:30 at night)</B>
<BR><B>I also have seen a young girl sat on my windowsill in my bedroom.
She was dressed in a flowery early 1900's style dress, she had dark hair
which was in ringletts. She was holding a doll which was dressed just as
she was. When I saw her she just sat and swung he legs from side to side
before fading away.</B>
<BR><B>As mentioned before I live near an old train station. In the early
1900's two trais collided and everyone onboard died (or so i've been told).
One night when I was four year old, I heard what sounded like screams followed
by a loud bang. Me and my sister looked out of the widow and what we saw
was the result of a horrific train crash. We called our parents who ran
to the window, My mother immediatly called 999, but soon after she put
the phone down the trains had gone and nothing was left. We weren't the
only family who had witnessed this.Many of our neighbours had too. The
same thing happened the next year and the next and has happened for the
past 10 years, we are expecting it will happen again this year on April
3, the same night as every other year.</B>
<BR><B>My great nan recently died and her ashes are behind one og the chairs
in our living room. I believe that my nan's spirit walks around the hallway
just outside of our living room. I believe this because everynight my dog
lies near the door and looks fairly allarmed. Her eyes then move from side
to side as if she is following someone or something with her eyes. At first
this freaked me out but now i'm used to it.</B>
<BR><B>My friend Louise lives in a big farmhouse which is ontop of farmland
which used to be owned by Lady Whyndam (there is an amazing story behind
who she is). Anyway I used to stay at her house quite often and would usually
see a ghost (there are about 4 ghosts me, Louise, her mum and her step
dad have all seen them)</B>
<BR><B>One day me and Louise were sat in the main living room which has
a huge window right opposite the sofa. Louise got up and went to the toilett
leaving me alone for some reason I started to stare out of the window when
an old man appeared, he looked about 70, He was wearing a short sleeved
red and white checkered shirt, and creamy coloured shorts, he was aslo
holding a spade. At first I thaught it was Louises granddad (grampy), so
I asked Louises mum(lynn) if they were expecting him and she said no. So
I thaught I must've been seing things and went back to sit down, but when
I got there I looked out of the window and the old man appeared again,
so I ran out into the kitchen where lynn was. I looked out of the kitchen
window and the man was there again.Lynn asked what was wrong but I continued
to stare at the old man, Lynn turned to look at what I was looking at and
she saw him too! She told me not to panick because ghosts can't hurt you.
Soon the man dissapeared again. I hardly saw him after that.</B>
<BR><B>There was another incident at Louises house which i'm going to tell
you about because I find it quite funny personally. Well I was staying
at Lou's and it was just me and her alone in her house in the middle of
knowhere. We had juet finnished our tea and we were washing up, (right
abouve the sink is the kitchen window). Lousie has (well had as they all
died recently ) four geese. As we were washing we heard the gesse running
around the garden, we looked up to see what was happening to see what looked
like a vicking chasing the gesse around the garden!</B>
<BR><B>Over the years (and i am only 15) I have seen a total of 7 ghosts,
and felt the presence of many more, I have become used to them and am no
longer scared of ghosts. It's not the dead that hurt you.....it's the living.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gh003e3179@blueyonder.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>One day, i was staying round my dads house while my house was having
an exstension on it. First off, the whole family was in the living room
and then my stepmum stood up, then a speaker came flying off the wall to
her head, luckily she was not hurt. There was no explenation why this had
happend- we just thought that there was a very angry sprit in the house
today. My father said next time it happens, he would call a preist in to
get it blessed. Later that night, the family sat down to wacth T.V, after
my programme had finished I decided to go to bed. I stood up and began
walking out, when two of theese lids, which was on the radiator, both flipped
off at the same time, I was so scared that night- I hardly got any sleep.
Antheor night there I was awake trying to get to sleep, when all the sudden
my door opend, I was excepting my dogs to come in, because thats what they
usally do at night- but they didnt, I got so scared that I jumped out of
bed ran downstairs, and sat on the sofa. And my two dogs were laying peacefully
on the floor. The next morning I told my dad about the incident. He called
the preist in to bless the house. Nothing happend since then. But 4 weeks
later my grandfather died. So I decided to stay round my dads to give him
comfort, and my nan, one night, the day before the funeral, my nan awoke
finding the sheets thrown on the floor from her bed, and the cover off
her wheelchair on the floor. My dad told me it was probaly my grandfather
trying to say his last goodbyes. My nan didnt know what happend- she was
just shocked. From then on I never have saw anything again, and my dad
hasnt had many incidents- But I still belive the Ghosts were my great grandparents,
and grandparents.</B><B></B>

<P><B>. Nampa Idaho</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: epic_dot_com@yahoo.com.</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>A large plot of land sprawls across several hundred acres in Nampa,
Idaho. Three houses and an entire working dairy comprise a small corner
of the land, while the remainder is dedicated to farmland. The main house
is large, three above-ground stories and an extremely large basement. It
is the typical early 20th century style: a tall box, an apex roof, white
with green shutters and trim. The subsequent houses are much smaller and
were originally used for dairy-hands to live in. My mother, a mental medium,
was adopted by her parents along with five other children when she was
very young. My grandfather had purchased the homes and land in the early
1930's, a mere twenty years after they were constructed and the ground
was settled. Around 1960, my grandparents adopted the children and brought
them into a very strict, devout Catholic household. Throughout their time
on the property, most living members of the family can recall events that
seem to go unexplained in their mind. My mother's is perhaps the most eer</B>
<BR><B>My late aunt claims to have seen brightly illuminated murials of
the Virgin Mary displayed across the attic walls. The woman was also the
most unstable of the children, mentally speaking. She claims these would
appear at the precise moment that she would bolt upright in bed from some
unknown reason. Keep in mind that this is also a woman who set fire to
the house in an attempt to commit suicide. Perhaps this weakened mental
state was the source of the phenomenon, or perhaps it was the edge that
the engergies desired to manifest themselves more completely.</B>
<BR><B>The majority of the energies seem to be concentrated in the main
house. It is large too, eight bedrooms and four bathrooms. The strongest
sensations can be felt in the basement and attic; particularly the entrance
to the room, which is a very narrow staircase that off-shoots one of the
upstairs bedrooms. Even non-sensitive individuals will feel a sense of
pressure or 'heaviness' as they ascend or descend the attic or basement
stairs. There are at least two entities that are strong enough to discern
themselves, to my mother and her siblings at least. A tall, adult man that
appears to be dressed in a early twentieth century American business suit
and hat seems to dominate the 2nd floor. And a young woman, I'm estimating
somewhere around 25 years old, wearing a white dress that is definitely
from a distant era in American fashion roams the 2nd floor and attic. Her
face is heavily powdered, and her hair is precisely arranged.</B>
<BR><B>I do have a possible explanation to the phenomenon if anyone is
interested in hearing it. I can be reached at epic_dot_com@yahoo.com. I
would also like to begin organizing paranormal studies in the general Idaho
area. Please utilize the above e-mail for a contact.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks and I'm happy to have found your site!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Forgive me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Christine.Breedt@investec.co.za</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've had so many experiences in my life but still sometimes doubt
what I've</B>
<BR><B>seen. I believe these "ghosts" are just souls wandering or watching
over us.</B>
<BR><B>If I had to write all my experiences it will take up many pages
therefore I</B>
<BR><B>will only tell of one.</B>
<BR><B>About 13 years ago I broke up with the great love of my life (Johan).
He</B>
<BR><B>loved drinking more than he loved me. My heart was broken into many
pieces</B>
<BR><B>but life goes on. About 18 months later I met and married my husband.
About</B>
<BR><B>5 years later I woke up one morning feeling very uncomfortable as
if</B>
<BR><B>something bad was about to happen. Later that morning a friend of
mine</B>
<BR><B>phoned and informed me that Johan and his brother-in-law (Pieter)
both died</B>
<BR><B>in a car accident the previous night. I phoned Johan's mother and
she</B>
<BR><B>confirmed it. She also told me that two days before the accident
Johan told</B>
<BR><B>her that he was a fool to let me out of his life and he really would
like to</B>
<BR><B>tell me but he did not know where to find me at that time. I did
not attend</B>
<BR><B>the funeral, so I did not know where he and his brother-in-law were
buried.</B>
<BR><B>Three years later my brother-in-law died and while visiting my in-laws
we</B>
<BR><B>decided to all go and visit his grave. We went there and because
it was so</B>
<BR><B>peaceful there, we started walking around and reading some of the</B>
<BR><B>inscriptions on some of the stones. I was walking next to my husband
(my</B>
<BR><B>in-laws and my 5 year old girl was about 300 metres away in front
of us)</B>
<BR><B>when I suddenly heard someone call out my name. I turned around
and did not</B>
<BR><B>see anyone and because it did not look as if my husband heard it,
I thought</B>
<BR><B>I imagined it and kept on strolling. Again I heard someone calling
my name.</B>
<BR><B>Only this time it sounded desperate. I stood still and at that moment
my</B>
<BR><B>daughter called my husband. He went on over to her while I turned
around to</B>
<BR><B>try and find out who (or what) was calling me. Again I did not see
anyone</B>
<BR><B>and as I was about to leave the same voice said: "Please Christine,
come</B>
<BR><B>here". I saw a headstone that looked like a huge wooden cross and
I went</B>
<BR><B>over there. I looked at it and thought to myself that it is a beautiful</B>
<BR><B>headstone but I did not read the inscription. Again I turned around
to walk</B>
<BR><B>away when I heard: "Please, just look at the inscription on the
headstone."</B>
<BR><B>I did and much to my surprise saw the name of Pieter engraved on
it. I felt</B>
<BR><B>dizzy from shock. Then the voice said: "Now look at the headstone
next to</B>
<BR><B>it." I did and saw Johan's name on there. I felt sick from shock
and wanted</B>
<BR><B>to run away but I was frozen stiff. Johan spoke again: "I waited
for you to</B>
<BR><B>come to me for so long, I must tell you something. I want you to
forgive me</B>
<BR><B>for the way I treated you, for all the times I used and abused you.
I need</B>
<BR><B>you to forgive me in order for me to go on my way. Please forgive
me." I was</B>
<BR><B>so shaken up but suddenly a sense of peace came over me and all
I could get</B>
<BR><B>out was: "I forgave you a long time ago." Then I heard my husband
coming up</B>
<BR><B>to me and he found me shaking. I told him I'm cold and wanted to
go home. As</B>
<BR><B>we walked back to the car he asked me who the man was that I was
talking to</B>
<BR><B>at the grave with the wooden cross. I did not see Johan, I only
heard his</B>
<BR><B>voice but my husband described him in so much detail that I do not
doubt who</B>
<BR><B>he saw and my husband never met Johan.</B>

uneasiest feeling of something evil.there has been rumors of devil worshipers
in the area.there is also supposed to be a trail from the cemetary to a
5 pointed star that is made of rocks. I have never looked but of couse
