<P><B>Strange Presence</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Gulewarrior@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>One night I was laying down in bed at about 1:19 I closed my eyes
and I felt</B>
<BR><B>a very strange presence in the room. Sudenly I couldn't move, breath,
or even</B>
<BR><B>open my eyes. I knew that I was still awake because I could hear
my brothers</B>
<BR><B>snoring in their beds. During that time I saw a girl (about 19 years
old)</B>
<BR><B>laying in the road surrounded with a pool of blood. I guess that
she was the</B>
<BR><B>victom of a hit and run accident. All through the night I found
myself being</B>
<BR><B>woken up to a strange presence and when I tryed to get back to sleep,
I</B>
<BR><B>wouldn't be able to move, breath, or open my eyes. Nothing like
that had ever</B>
<BR><B>happened before and hopefully it won't happen again.</B>

<P><B>Scary Event</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: EpKyLiE042@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Last christmas in december my parents went out to a christmas party,
and i</B>
<BR><B>had 2 of my girlfriends sleepover at my house. Around 10 at night
my one</B>
<BR><B>friend Emily and I were sitting in my basement typing away on the
computer</B>
<BR><B>when all of a sudden i hear a shaking, rattling noise. I look over
just 5</B>
<BR><B>feet to my left and the door to our guest bedroom was shaking violently.
The</B>
<BR><B>door was shut and it was as if someone was on the other side, like
they were</B>
<BR><B>trying to get out or something. I tapped Emily on the shoulder and
pointed to</B>
<BR><B>the door, and we both just stared for about 60 seconds and it just
stopped.</B>
<BR><B>So we both yell for my other friend Haley and we tell her what happened
and</B>
<BR><B>so we all ran into the living room on the main floor and crouched
down behind</B>
<BR><B>some plants in the corner of my living room. We were sitting beside
a vent to</B>
<BR><B>the basement and kept hearing eerie little noises... like movement.
So seeing</B>
<BR><B>as my parents weren't coming home soon Emily called her dad and
asked him to</B>
<BR><B>come pick us up and take us to her house. It would take him about
15 minutes</B>
<BR><B>to get here so we all grabbed our stuff and waited at my front door.
The</B>
<BR><B>house was quiet and then all of a sudden we hear this huge crash
from the</B>
<BR><B>basement! We all screamed and ran outside... luckily Emily's dad
was just</B>
<BR><B>pulling up. And so the next morning i called my mom and told her
what</B>
<BR><B>happened, and she said,</B>
<BR><B>"Thats funny because when i went downstairs last night to lock the
backdoor</B>
<BR><B>that guest bedroom door was open"</B>
<BR><B>Well thats my scary event, i swear to you it's true.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Lunch Time</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: delaire@tournet.com.ar</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It was lunch time on a warm day of&nbsp; October when my family and
I became witnesses to the</B>
<BR><B>existence of ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>I had just arrived from school and joined six members of my family&nbsp;
who were eagerly eating&nbsp; steak with salad while watching the news
on TV in the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our&nbsp; pleasant activity was suddenly
interrupted by a loud bang. All of us looked up just to catch a glimpse
of what many people would consider "a ghost". The noise had been produced
by the sudden opening and hitting of the yard's door against a wall at
90&deg;, a meter from the kitchen itself.</B>
<BR><B>The" white thing" didn't go "trough" the door -as many films show.
What's more, it avoided a huge TV set that was placed in the middle of
the kitchen, then opened a second door with the same violence, making it
shut with a slam after hitting another wall at 90&deg;. All of us were
panick-stricken and couldn't utter a word.&nbsp; Startled, we looked one
another as if trying to find an answer to the weary event. Then, without
saying a word, my aunt, who was sitting opposite me, stood up and&nbsp;
went to look for the strange visitor behind the second door, where the
bedrooms were. “‘Nothing’ or ‘nobody’ was there,”my aunt said. “Just a
dead silence.”</B>
<BR><B>I tossed and turned in bed before sleeping at night for many days
in a row.&nbsp; Sometimes I woke up with a jerk in the middle of the night,
as if I could feel the ghost wandering about in the house, rustling papers,
moving things... But I can’t assure that this really happened; it could
well have been nightmares.</B>
<BR><B>I think there are two odd things to bear in mind: the event ocurred
in broad daylight, and there was no wind at all that day.</B>
<BR><B>Since then, I've been trying to avoid going to the part of the house
where that "thing" vanished. I was 12 when I saw that thing, and still
after more than twenty years, it keeps bothering me. Sometimes I think
that perhaps it could have been my eagerness to have proves of God's existence
which made all that thing happen,for, when I was around 10 years old I
used to pray to God for a sign of his world; perhaps that was a way to
show me that he existed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know.</B>
<BR><B>Some other times I associate the experience with a dream I used
to have: I saw myslef hiding under the kitchen table because I could feel
it in my bones that a witch in black would soon come down the stairs from
the roof, cross the yard, and enter the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
the thing is that what I</B>
<BR><B>is that what I saw when I was 12 was not black.&nbsp; Anyway, I’ve
had premonitory dreams many times in my life, so it could’ve well been
one.&nbsp; The last one I had was so terrible that I found it really hard
to go on</B>
<BR><B>studying: this one was related to the attack on the Twin Towers.
When I saw the news on TV I got shocked, impotence overtook me. I felt
guilty, and stupid as well, for I had not paid attention to the message
I had received; I thouht it had been a simple nightmare. I wonder what
I would have done if I had understood my dream. Who would have listened?
Who can you trust in this wild world where every single person dealing
with the supernatural is only interested in making profit from it? Even
preachers look at you as if you were crazy or as if you were telling a
lie when you tell them you’ve seen a ghost, and however hard they try to
conceal their feelings, they never succeed. I know what is in their minds;
I feel it.</B>
<BR><B>The thing is that I have never done anything to develop this gift
of seeing things in my dreams to its highest extent – and I won’t, so I
can’t distinguish between a simple dream and a real message. And this gets
me crazy. I never ask for premonition, it just happens.</B>
<BR><B>It's really difficult to find a logical explanation to such things;
it is much more difficult to find professionals in the area who could account
seriously for the occurrence of supernatural things, though. Something
easy to find is people who laugh at your experience, but I don't really
care, for I know I'm telling sth that is true. I just look at them and
think "poor people, they don't know what they're laughing at."I know that&nbsp;
it is natural that people tend to refuse what they can't understand or
“control”; I myself used to do the same before my own experience. So I
understand them very well.</B>

<BR><B>My Guardian Cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DrmStrtAngel267@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had many experiences with the paranormal...now, I'm only 14,
and so you probably think that I'm just making this stuff up. But, it's
all very true, and very disturbing! This are my past experiences...</B>
<BR><B>It all started very small, like scary dreams, creaking floorboards,
mysterious footsteps...you know, the usual. Ever since I was little, I
could hear voices, and see things others can't. When I would go tell my
parents, they just said it was my imagination, then later they realized
it wasn't my imagination.</B>
<BR><B>One year ago I was brushing my teeth and getting ready for bed,
then I heard a meow from outside the bathroom door. I just stood there...frozen
solid. Our cat has been dead for 5 months. I quickly looked out the bathroom
door to find my cat laying down and eating his food. I screamed, and he
looked up at me and said..."It's coming...". When I blinked, he disappeared.
I was freaking out! I tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination,
and I was seeing things because I missed him so much. I calmed down about
and hour after that little incident, and I crawled into my soft, warm bed.
I went to sleep, then later woke up to someone whispering, "He's here...!".
I automatically opened my eyes and I saw a dark, shadowy, haze over my
bed. Then I heard another meow, and I felt someone punch my in my stomach!
I yelped, and started to cry bloody-murder! As I winced in pain, I looked
around, and there was no one there who could have done it. The haze was
still there. Looking at me with it's very distinct eyes. I was scared half-to-dealth,
who wouldn't be?! I yelled for my mom, and I heard her ran frantically
downstairs. She ran into my room, and she saw the haze above my bed, and
started screaming. And again, there was another meow, and both of us looked
down, and there was our beloved diseased cat laying on my floor with his
cutesy look in his eyes. Then all of a sudden, the black haze disappeared...and
so did my cat.</B>
<BR><B>After that, I have had multiple encounters with my little cat. Actually
he was a fat cat, but that doesn't matter... He has always warned me before
hand if something bad was going to happen. He is my guardian angel. I love
you Nickels. Rest In Peace my baby kitty!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;My Great Grandfather</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MKubrickGirl@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; Ive been reading your site and can't
believe the amount of</B>
<BR><B>testimonies given by people who have had such vivid accounts of
ghostly</B>
<BR><B>interaction.&nbsp; Ive been hooked really;-). Sneaking in readings
during work.</B>
<BR><B>Ive always believed in the "other side" as it were but never knew
so many</B>
<BR><B>were affected by it daily.&nbsp; Either way I figured I would share
my experiences</B>
<BR><B>as a child with you.</B>
<BR><B>In life I would have run ins every once and a while with a strange</B>
<BR><B>"knowing" feeling or hearing footsteps or hearing my name called...that
kind</B>
<BR><B>of thing.&nbsp; But the clencher for me was when I turned 13.&nbsp;
I was in New Mexico</B>
<BR><B>at the 4rth of July party my Great Grandmother was having at her
very old</B>
<BR><B>Adobe house in Las Lunas.&nbsp; The night before, my cousins and
I had caused a</B>
<BR><B>mess of fire crackers out in the front drive. We left it for clean
up the</B>
<BR><B>next day.&nbsp; My cousins all slept in the main living room while
I, being the</B>
<BR><B>only girl of the grandchildren, slept with my great grandmother
in a side</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; This side room was attached to a door which was left
open due to the</B>
<BR><B>heat of the night.&nbsp; It was about 5am the next morning when
I kept hearing a</B>
<BR><B>person going in and out of the sliding doors which were located
just right</B>
<BR><B>outside the open door to our room.&nbsp; The person kept whistling
and I heard a</B>
<BR><B>sweeping sound so I just lay there&nbsp; thinking it was my uncle
who clearly</B>
<BR><B>couldn't take the mess outside anymore.&nbsp; I have always been
very nearsighted,</B>
<BR><B>so what I saw as far as a figure was more of a blur of a person
going in and</B>
<BR><B>out of the sliding doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I decided&nbsp;
before i went back to sleep</B>
<BR><B>I would get a drink of water.&nbsp; as I stepped up to the sink
a huge spider</B>
<BR><B>stuck his neck up at me and as a result I almost jumped out of my
nightdress.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I completely woke up from this . Anyway...as I was trying
to skirt the Daddy</B>
<BR><B>Longlegs in the sink for some water, the whistling I had heard outside
was</B>
<BR><B>now coming from the back of the house.&nbsp; It took me by suprise
because it was</B>
<BR><B>so loud. I half expected to hear my cousins telling my uncle to
keep it down.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;But as I listened for any stirring, nothing happened.&nbsp;
Thats when the hairs</B>
<BR><B>on my neck stood up.&nbsp; I gained enough courage to walk to the
edge of the</B>
<BR><B>dining room to try and catch a glimpse of my uncle but I couldn't
bring</B>
<BR><B>myself to go any further.&nbsp; So instead I called his name two
or three times.</B>
<BR><B>Not hearing any response, not even the whistling stopping, I ran
into my</B>
<BR><B>grandmothers bed and spent the rest of the morning with her.&nbsp;
Later that day</B>
<BR><B>I asked my uncle what he was doing up so early and he said that
he wasn't (of</B>
<BR><B>course).&nbsp; I told him what had happened and he suggested I tell
my great</B>
<BR><B>grandmother.&nbsp; He didn't tell me why&nbsp; and I just put it
down to Uncle</B>
<BR><B>harassment.&nbsp; However when I did tell her she looked at at me
smiled very</B>
<BR><B>softly and said "oh, you heard him."&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again I just
didn't think about</B>
<BR><B>it much.&nbsp; Many years later in a car with my mother, I relayed
the story to</B>
<BR><B>her.&nbsp; She listened very intently.&nbsp; Then, after it was
over, gave me a very</B>
<BR><B>strange look.&nbsp; She then told me that my great grandfather,
her grandfather,</B>
<BR><B>had a distinctive habit.&nbsp; For the last 20 years of his life
he used to get up</B>
<BR><B>early in the morning, walk around the house, straighten the grounds,
sweeping</B>
<BR><B>and whatnot, and would always, always whistle.&nbsp; In fact it
used to drive them</B>
<BR><B>nuts.&nbsp; She told me that I had seen and heard my great grandfather.
And</B>
<BR><B>needless to say, several years later or not, It freaked me out.&nbsp;
So much so</B>
<BR><B>in fact I never liked going back to the house.&nbsp; It bothered
me that I seemed</B>
<BR><B>to have some connection to the other side and at any moment could
find my</B>
<BR><B>great grandfather at the end of my bed giving me boyfriend advise.&nbsp;
But</B>
<BR><B>something happened that helped me think it wasn't such a bad thing.</B>
<BR><B>The last time I was there at the old adobe house in Las Ulnas my
great</B>
<BR><B>grandmother had had a stroke.&nbsp; My mother and I were actually
staying with her</B>
<BR><B>aunt at the time in Alberqurque but were asked in a moment of desperation
to</B>
<BR><B>go to the adobe house to find some insurance papers that were needed
for my</B>
<BR><B>great grandmothers hospital admission.&nbsp; The only problem was
that due to my</B>
<BR><B>grandmothers stroke no one could understand her.&nbsp; So we didn't
know where</B>
<BR><B>they were or what they looked like.&nbsp; So basically Mom and I
were asked to</B>
<BR><B>hunt down whatever looked like important papers.</B>
<BR><B>As soon as we entered the house I didn't want to be there..staying
close to</B>
<BR><B>Mom as she wandered room to room looking through drawers and chests.&nbsp;
I also</B>
<BR><B>felt annoyed at the fact that we really didn't know what we were
looking for.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;After about a half an hour I found myself in the bathroom
alone.&nbsp; Once again</B>
<BR><B>I found some courage and actually talked to my grandfather.&nbsp;
I said</B>
<BR><B>"grandfather, as you know grandma is in the hospital and she needs
some</B>
<BR><B>insurance papers.&nbsp; But no one can understand her.&nbsp; Do
you know where they</B>
<BR><B>are?&nbsp; Just let me know and Ill get them to her."&nbsp; Then
Im sure I make some</B>
<BR><B>wisecrack about getting out of the house.&nbsp; But as I left the
bathroom I</B>
<BR><B>remember thinking I needed to be open and actually waited for some
sign.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>can't explain what I felt...it didn't really feel like anything
except</B>
<BR><B>feeling off balance.&nbsp; And I fell&nbsp; toward a corner closet
covered with a</B>
<BR><B>drape.&nbsp; Somehow this felt "right."&nbsp; I walked in and looked
to my left.&nbsp; There</B>
<BR><B>was a stack of boxes in the corner.&nbsp; The third one was a little
metal cash</B>
<BR><B>box.&nbsp; I remember feeling excited, like I had found it. But
didn't have any</B>
<BR><B>idea what I found.&nbsp; Immediately I took it to the dining room
table and opened</B>
<BR><B>it. There on top where Insurance papers of some sort.&nbsp; Again
I felt the</B>
<BR><B>"knowing" feeling.&nbsp; To me it feels like a hard resolve.&nbsp;
Like there is just</B>
<BR><B>nothing more to say because you just know.&nbsp; I gave the papers
to my mother</B>
<BR><B>who contested they were not the ones she needed.&nbsp; However I
knew better.</B>
<BR><B>She, finally having found no other option took them to the hospital.&nbsp;
Later</B>
<BR><B>that night we got a call from Mom.&nbsp; She asked me how I knew
where and what</B>
<BR><B>they were because they were exactly what the hospital was looking
for.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>didn't give her all the sorted details but thanked my great grandpa
for the</B>
<BR><B>help.&nbsp; And as a bonus, Ive never been back to the house&nbsp;
lol.&nbsp; Thanks for</B>
<BR><B>taking the time;-).</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: maximus184@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I believe that I have had a ghost or some presence with me
for some</B>
<BR><B>time now. It started when I lived in Fanwood New Jersey in 1980
I would say.</B>
<BR><B>Noises, things missing, and the sensation of someone touching me.
My firsr</B>
<BR><B>real experience happened when I came home from school one day. I
was in the</B>
<BR><B>living room when I heard the attic door open and close. I was the
only home</B>
<BR><B>at the time. I peeked around the corner to see what was going on.
There was</B>
<BR><B>no one there, but I could hear footsteps walking down the stairs.
They were</B>
<BR><B>wood, and squeaked when you walked down them. That was the biggest
incident</B>
<BR><B>while we lived there. Throught the years my family has moved across
the</B>
<BR><B>country. While we lived in VA I attended school in Manassas Va.
This is when</B>
<BR><B>I first saw an apperation. I belived it to be a Confederate soldier.
It only</B>
<BR><B>lasted a brief few seconds. Well now I am grown and have kids of
my own. I</B>
<BR><B>believe my oldest son who is 4 can aslo sense the presence. He tells
me that</B>
<BR><B>someone talks to him and plays with him. He calls him the "professor"
This</B>
<BR><B>strted a few years ago. He will wake up in the middle of the night
and&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>can hear him wispering to someone. I don't believe these presences
to be</B>
<BR><B>harmful. The last major insident happened around the time the Professor</B>
<BR><B>showed up. I was outside having a smoke while my family was inside
asleep.</B>
<BR><B>It was around 1 in the morning. When I tried to get back in the
house the</B>
<BR><B>top bolt was locked. Nobody was up besides myself. I banged on the
door for</B>
<BR><B>10 minutes before my wife woke up and opened it up. Well there are
many more</B>
<BR><B>stories I have, but I will not ramble on. If interested please let
me know.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you for your time.</B>

<P><B>My Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: HNICOLE445@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Wanna hear my story?? O well you are going to anyway. It started
about a year</B>
<BR><B>ago. My friends &amp; I discovered this abandoned house on the end
of town &amp;</B>
<BR><B>decided to look around in it. We went at night &amp; brought a video
camera with</B>
<BR><B>us. When we took it back to the house to watch it we saw a shadowy
figure at</B>
<BR><B>the top of the stairs. We later came to find out that what supposedly</B>
<BR><B>happened was this woman that used to live there had a kid &amp;
killed it &amp; then</B>
<BR><B>she threw herself down the stairs. We went back to the house &amp;
found these</B>
<BR><B>old letters. We started to read them &amp; this really heavy chandelier
started</B>
<BR><B>to violently swing &amp; this ... unexplainable force went through
all of us.</B>
<BR><B>That night we went back &amp; plugged in this light bulb so we could
see &amp; it was</B>
<BR><B>extremely hot in the house. We went upstairs for about 2 minutes
&amp; decided to</B>
<BR><B>go back downstairs. The second we hit the first stair we realized
that it was</B>
<BR><B>so cold that was could see our breath. Everyone started to freak
out so we</B>
<BR><B>decided to leave. I grabbed the light bulb off the floor &amp; was
like "We have</B>
<BR><B>to turn off the light," &amp; everyone started walking toward me.
Someone said</B>
<BR><B>"turn off the light" &amp; at that very instant the light bulb in
my hand</B>
<BR><B>exploded ... turned blue... &amp; faded away. The next time we went
a light bulb</B>
<BR><B>flew across the room for no reason. We went back &amp; the chandelier
was</B>
<BR><B>swinging again. Then next time we brought an Ouija board &amp; we
asked it if</B>
<BR><B>there was a ghost in the house &amp; right after we asked it we
heard what</B>
<BR><B>sounded like a person jumping upstairs but there wasn't anyone up
there. We</B>
<BR><B>brought an Ouija board the following time also &amp; I have NO clue
why but for</B>
<BR><B>some reason I felt the need to spin. So I was spinning around the
room &amp; my</B>
<BR><B>friends told me that I was hysterically laughing but I don't remember
doing</B>
<BR><B>it. What I do remember is while I was spinning in a corner of the
room I saw</B>
<BR><B>a woman ... probably in her 30's.. staring at me. After I saw her
I stopped</B>
<BR><B>spinning &amp; sat down to do the Ouija board with my friends. We
asked it what</B>
<BR><B>its name was &amp; it said Sara (which is the name of the woman
all the notes</B>
<BR><B>were to that we had found). Another time we went &amp; a door fell
for no reason &amp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;there were little kids finger prints on it. We still go to
this very</B>
<BR><B>day..... it's our entertainment in our little town. So there is
my story.</B>
<BR><B>Hope you liked it ... later!</B>

<P><B>My Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Worldclassbass@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>it all started when i came home one night and found that the cd player
on my</B>
<BR><B>stereo in my bedroomwas open. i thought that this was strange since
i never</B>
<BR><B>leave it open, but i thought nothing about it. i went into the bathroom
to</B>
<BR><B>get ready for bed and when i came out the tape player was open.
now this was</B>
<BR><B>strange, but i laughed about and called one of my friends and jokingly
said i</B>
<BR><B>had a ghost in my house. we laughed about it and then i went to
bed. the next</B>
<BR><B>night i noticed that my cat was acting strange. she just kept staring
into my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom from the hallway. i would pick her up and move her and she
would go</B>
<BR><B>right back to sitting in front of my bedroom and just stare. this
was really</B>
<BR><B>strange. a few nights later i woke in the middle of the night because
i felt</B>
<BR><B>someone shaking my bed as if they were trying to wake me. i was
alone!&nbsp; i</B>
<BR><B>couldn't understand what was going on but i figured i must have
been</B>
<BR><B>dreaming. i told some friends the next day and they just laughed,
but i</B>
<BR><B>couldn't stop thinking about it. the next night, i laid in bed reading
for</B>
<BR><B>about an hour before turning out the lights to go to sleep. as soon
as i</B>
<BR><B>turned the light out the bed-shaking started again. i jumped up
terrified and</B>
<BR><B>went outside for a cigarette. what was going on? after a few cigarettes,
i</B>
<BR><B>decided to sleep on the couch. my friends continued to ridicule
me. i felt</B>
<BR><B>embarassed because no one belived, but something was really going
on.&nbsp; the</B>
<BR><B>next night i went back to my bed and experienced the same thing!
i was really</B>
<BR><B>scared. i started sleeping on the couch, only going into the bedroom
when i</B>
<BR><B>needed to get clothes for the next day. soon i started to notice
a faint</B>
<BR><B>"cigarette smoke" smell every time an "occurence" would happen.
after a while</B>
<BR><B>i just got used to sharing my home with a ghost. as creepy as it
sounds, what</B>
<BR><B>can you do about it? after about a month of this, a friend's mother
told me</B>
<BR><B>she had a ghost and had some people come get rid of it and she would
tell</B>
<BR><B>them about me. i didn't believe her just as my friends didn't believe
me, but</B>
<BR><B>i let her bring the "ghost busters" over. when they arrived they
were much</B>
<BR><B>different than i expected. two men and a woman, all 3 in their late
60s. they</B>
<BR><B>walked around looking for the ghost. they finally found it in my
bathroom of</B>
<BR><B>all places. i didn't believe a word they said. i thought the whole
thing was</B>
<BR><B>set up to make me feel better. they said the ghost was a female
name</B>
<BR><B>"cassandra" and that she was about the same age as me. (i'm 25).
they all</B>
<BR><B>held hands and told the ghost that she was no longer welcome. (
i felt kinda</B>
<BR><B>bad for the ghost). finally they finished and said the ghost was
gone. i</B>
<BR><B>still didn't believe that anything they did was true, but i have
had no</B>
<BR><B>further ghost activity since.</B>

<P><B>i just wanted to add that the most shocking thing about the whole
experience</B>
<BR><B>is that my friends and family didn't believe me. i had no reason
whatsoever</B>
<BR><B>to make the story up. it has been 2 years since the "experience"
and people</B>
<BR><B>still joke with me about it.&nbsp; i left alot out of my story just
to condense</B>
<BR><B>it, but it is true. the people that got rid of it told me that the
ghost was</B>
<BR><B>a girl my age and she died in a motorcycle accident. they said that
she</B>
<BR><B>"connected" with me because we had similar personalities. they said
that 2</B>
<BR><B>spirits came and took her to where she needed to be. they said they
didn't</B>
<BR><B>know who the 2 spirits were, but they were either friends or family
of the</B>
<BR><B>girl. it is an experience that i'm glad i went through but never
want to go</B>
<BR><B>through again. it has confirmed my belief in the afterlife. i will
never</B>
<BR><B>forget "cassandra"</B>

<BR><B>Uncle John</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: snappin1@bellsouth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>First of all, I'd like to say that although my family has never been
dabbled in any paranormal practices, but we were always taught to have
respect for the dead and&nbsp; those on "the other side".&nbsp; When this
incident occurred, I was about 10 years old.</B>
<BR><B>It was close to midnight, and as usual, I had waited for my parents
to go to bed and turned my bedside lamp on and began reading a book.&nbsp;
There was motion in my peripheral vision and I looked up rather alarmed
and saw my Uncle John standing there.</B>
<BR><B>Immediately, I felt calm.&nbsp; I didn't question his being there
as it didn't seem strange.&nbsp; He talked to me briefly, telling me that
he loved me and to promise to be good.&nbsp; When he ended by saying that
he wouldn't be back to see me anymore, I began to cry and ask him why.&nbsp;
Right before my eyes, he began to become transparent.&nbsp; Fading slowly,
his smiling face began to split, spilling blood onto his plaid shirt. Just
as one side of his head seemed to drop to the floor, he disappeared completely.&nbsp;
My sense of calm was gone, and I realized what had just happened to me.&nbsp;
I jumped from my bed and ran down the stairs to my parents room.</B>
<BR><B>About half way down the stairs, the telephone began to ring.&nbsp;
I burst into my parents room, out of breath and crying, wanting too tell
them what had happened.&nbsp; Instead, when I opened my mouth, I heard
my own voice say, "Aunt Mary needs you on the phone!"</B>
<BR><B>The conversation was short and to the point.&nbsp; My mother was
crying, and Daddy was on the phone, trying to calm Aunt Mary.</B>
<BR><B>Later that morning, my mom asked me how did I know Aunt Mary had
been on the phone.&nbsp; I told her everything, and she backed away from
me as I spoke.</B>
<BR><B>Uncle John had been driving down the two lane highway to his farm
when his pick up truck was hit by an 18 wheeler.&nbsp; The service was
closed casket, his head had been damaged beyond repair. In fact, it had
been nearly cleaved in two.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Friends Grandma and ALSO a St.Augustine,FLA Store Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: floritaj@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello again....I wanted to share with you another story. I've had
a few experiences in the past.....my other story is posted on one of these
pages and I will try to post the other ones I have now as I've put it off
long enough! Sorry if this story is long...but it s a nice story. I only
wished I would have done something when it happened.</B>
<BR><B>First off, I am 39 yrs old and this first story happened in the
summer of 1984. I was living in Cincinnati, Ohio at the time and came back
here to Florida over the summer to visit family and friends. My one friend
I had known for many many years and I was 22 yrs old. in 1984, and my friend
Lee Anne was 19.</B>
<BR><B>This happened while I was staying at her parents house here in Jacksonville,
Florida. Her grandmother Vida Bell(O'Quinn) had died.. I want to say about
a year before I got down to Florida, I am not too sure. I always called
her Grandma, as I knew her a bit better then my own. She used to live in
Georgia and they moved her here to Florida to live with her son, Walter
and daughter-in-law, Carole at their new house, a huge 4 bedroom, 2 bath
home in the Holiday Hill area, as her health was not so good and I honestly
cannot recall what she died from, but she died inside the house. I knew
this of course before staying there... and I thought nothing of it.</B>
<BR><B>Well, I was to stay in the one bedroom, a good sized room and there
was a bed, dresser and a recliner. I said....to LeeAnnes Mom Carole (who
I used to call Mom), " Mom, why is that chair in here?" She laughed and
said," Oh that was grandmas... this was her room." I about hit the floor...."
Oh no, I can't stay in her room....she died in here". Mom says, "Yep, in
that very chair... dont worry, she is not here."</B>
<BR><B>I had always been sensative, as the house I grew up in was haunted
with a residual haunting and I KNOW when a place is hauned.. a certain
feeling or vibe comes over me and I knew Grandma was still there, but I
couldnt ever tell Carole or Walter about ghosts and things as they were
very very christian and I did not think they would ever believe me if I
said I had a FEELING she was there, as they'd think I was nuts.</B>
<BR><B>Well..&nbsp; I told LeeAnne, lets switch rooms for a night and she
refused and said, " No way.. grandma died in there", I said, "Oh come on
now LeeAnne, if grandma is here.. she is every where in here", She said.."
No Nita I think she stays in there where she died".</B>
<BR><B>Her parents room was on the south side of the house, and the other
3 bedrooms were on the north side of the house... and in the short hall,
to the left of the Family room...was the 3 bedrooms...to the left was LeeAnnes
room, then the bathroom straight in front of that hallway and to the east...the
other 2 bedrooms.</B>
<BR><B>LeeAnne said to me that she used to hear Grandma calling out to
her dad, not often, but a few times and she would run from the bedroom
into the living room about tearing down the wall to get to the family room
and you could see where she had bumped it a few times being scared and
running. I said, " No reason to be scared LeeAnne, she was your grandma!",
She said, " I know but I dont care to see the woman now, she is dead".
I said,"Physically she is... I sense she is here....we should NOT be scared
LeeAnne." Well.. I was really a bit freaked out, and I used to sense her
in the hallway alot and LeeAnne said that grandma used to get her walker
and walk thru the hall to the Family room real slow, as she was about 70
something and could not go that fast. LeeAnne even said they used to hear
the bell they gave her to ring when she needed them... but just ignored
it... I never heard the bell.</B>
<BR><B>After a few weeks of staying there, LeeAnnes parents were out at
their square dancing classes and LeeAnne and I were home. It was around
6:30pm or so and LeeAnne had come home from work, and we were in the kitchen
trying to think of what to make for dinner. In the center of the kitchen
was a work island and to the north was the familyroom area...and then the
kitchen and to the south of that was the dining room area, and her parents
room.</B>
<BR><B>She got out hot dogs to heat up in the microwave..and I got out
a box of macaroni and cheese... and a saucepan to start boiling the water
for the macaroni. We were talking in the kitchen... and you know how it
is.. staring at a pot of water wont make it boil any faster....a watched
pot wont make it boil I think is the saying. Well LeeAnne and I were chatting
and I was by the stove and she was at the cooking island with paper plates
, and mayonaise out and ketcup, mustard and I walked over to the island
and put some potato chips on my plate and we both heard..."Walter?" She
was on one side and I was on the other and we looked up at each other....like,
" OH MY GOD! GRANDMA!!" I said, " Did you hear that?" She said.." I told
you! Its her!" We heard her call out again, " Walter". I freeze and LeeAnne
said," Im getting the hell out of here Nita!" I said..." But LeeAnne!"
She turned the stove off and grabbed her purse and car keys off the bar
and I said as I grabbed my purse.." Grandma, Walter is out Square dancing
with Carole...Bye!!!"</B>
<BR><B>We high tailed it out of there and LeeAnne was just a shaking as
she started her car up.." I told you grandmas ghost was here!" We got down
the road and I dont recall where we went but about 45 minutes later we
came back home. And Carole and Walter were back. We went in thru the garage
and her parents asked, "Why did the two of you leave all this out on the
counter and on the stove?" We both said," We heard grandma calling out
Walter...Walter! So we left the house". Carole said, " She isnt going to
bite you!" " Well we got scared by it and left". So.. I walk towards the
bedrooms and I was so on edge....I said..."Grandma.. you can leave now..."&nbsp;
Needless to say I did not sleep in her old bedroom that night. And what
was real weird...I ended up gettig a part time job while there on my summer
visit, and I used to make my bed every day before leaving for work, and
when I came home after 5:00pm, you could see where it looked like some
one sat there... the bedspread was messed up a bit and it was a small imprint.....grandma
Bell was not that big a person and the indent would have matched hers if
she has been sitting there..... that used to freak me out.... I wished
I would have spoken to her if I could.... I would talk out loud in case
she WAS around and told her I was sleeping in her bed and I wont bother
any thing... and I always reminded her she knew me... just in case she
forgot who I was...and in her room....funny though.. I would feel her around,
and I never did hear her again while there, nor did LeeAnne....We told
her we'd rather not hear her talking now, but she was welcome to walk about
the house like in life... but hearing her was a bit scarey.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for letting me share this with all of you.Take care!</B>

<P><B>On September 22, 2001 I got married to the most wonderful man.&nbsp;
After getting back from our honeymoon in Florida we had gotten back most
of our proofs from the wedding.&nbsp; In a couple of pictures of just me
with no one else in the picture I new that my late father was with me all
day.&nbsp; In one picture taken at my mothers house there was a red aura
above my head and in another picture at the reception there was some orbs
around me.&nbsp; I felt alot more happy knowing that my Dad/best friend
was at the wedding.&nbsp; When seeing these pictures I was more calm, rather
then being scared.&nbsp; It was sad knowing that my father wasn't there
in person, but he was there in spirit, quite literally.&nbsp; Now I know
that all spirits are not scary.</B>

<BR><B>My Dad's Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: king_nikolai@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi! Before I start, I wanted to say that I am</B>
<BR><B>experienced with ghosts and the paranormal. I even</B>
<BR><B>hope to lead a ghost expedition soon. I am a big fan</B>
<BR><B>of your site and visit regularly, but I have decided</B>
<BR><B>to finally send in some true ghost stories I know.</B>
<BR><B>This one did not happen to me but my father, When he</B>
<BR><B>was 13 he and his family bought a very old house in</B>
<BR><B>Tullahoma, Tennessee. Nobody told them about it being</B>
<BR><B>haunted and when they moved in all was fine. My Dad's</B>
<BR><B>room was a normal size bedroom with a bathroom than</B>
<BR><B>connected to it. Well, after a while, strange things</B>
<BR><B>started to happen! They heard horrible fighting and</B>
<BR><B>yelling noises from his room and as my Great</B>
<BR><B>Grandfather walked by one day a gold plated lighter</B>
<BR><B>flew from the room and broke a picture on the wall!</B>
<BR><B>Every Wednesday night, the bathtub in the bathroom</B>
<BR><B>would run water and soap would pour in. My dad</B>
<BR><B>witnessed this several times....after a while the</B>
<BR><B>family found out that a man had fought with his</B>
<BR><B>wife(explains the noises), after she left he ran a</B>
<BR><B>tub(on a Wednesday night), and drowned himself. They</B>
<BR><B>found a picture of this man and what was he holding in</B>
<BR><B>it? A golden lighter. This freaked out the family and</B>
<BR><B>they had the bathroom torn out. The events never</B>
<BR><B>happened again. Please believe me. Oh, and I</B>
<BR><B>appreciate any e-mails back with questions or anything</B>
<BR><B>else.</B><B></B>

<P><B>HI my name is Sheena and I came across your site and I have decided
to share a story with you. My dad passed away very suddenly this past April
in a tragic accident. It was a couple days before his fueneral and we had
a few relatives on my mom's side of the family staying in campers in our
yard and my boyfriend was staying with us too. Other than him, my brother
was the only other male in the house that night. My boyfriend got up to
go to the washroom in the middle of the night. When he got to the bathroom
he realized that someone was in there. He went into the kitchen to wait
for his turn. When he thought he heard the toilet flush he went back to
the bathroom. He saw a male figure come out that looked like my dad. Not
knowing who was all staying with us, he just assumed it was my dad's older
brother. He didn't say anything to me because of it. About 3 weeks later
he told me about it. As I was listning to this, I realized that it couldn't
have been my uncle, because no one on my dad's side stayed with us. We
discussed all the possibilities of who it could have been at such a late
hour. And we came to the conclusion that it couldn't have been my brother
or anyone living. I truly believe it was my dad.</B>

<BR><B>Mother In Law</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: snottymcsnoot@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>All of my life I have been certain that ghosts' and</B>
<BR><B>such do indeed exist, but I have never personally</B>
<BR><B>experienced anything out of the ordinary. That is,</B>
<BR><B>untill my mother in law passed this year.(2001) She</B>
<BR><B>fought an incredibly difficult battle with cancer and</B>
<BR><B>eventually lost in April. We were all there with her</B>
<BR><B>as she slowly died in front of us. Later that evening</B>
<BR><B>all of us ( Meaning me, my husband, his 2 brothers,</B>
<BR><B>and their wives) were sitting in the basement of our</B>
<BR><B>home. We had been discussing funeral arrangments and</B>
<BR><B>things of that nature. ( As young as we all were, this</B>
<BR><B>responsability was left to us) I was sitting on the</B>
<BR><B>stairs, and everyone else was pretty much seated in a</B>
<BR><B>circly around the perimeter of the small room. My</B>
<BR><B>nephew was on the floor in the center of us all</B>
<BR><B>playing. ( He was almost 10 months old at this point)</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly he sat up and began laughing and playing as</B>
<BR><B>if someone was sitting right in front of him.(Keep in</B>
<BR><B>mind this was the first and only grandchild my mother</B>
<BR><B>in law had at the time. They had a strong connection)</B>
<BR><B>He began uttering the words "Nana", which was his name</B>
<BR><B>for her. The room grew incredibly cold, which all of</B>
<BR><B>us immediatly noticed Then i felt a gust of wind come</B>
<BR><B>up in front of me, over my head, then go up the</B>
<BR><B>stairs. At the point when "it" reached the top of the</B>
<BR><B>stairs, our two dogs began barking uncontrolably. Our</B>
<BR><B>front door slammed shut,(Yea I am sure i could chalk</B>
<BR><B>it up to the wind, but it was&nbsp; to much of a</B>
<BR><B>coinsidence) Shortly after the door slammed our sensor</B>
<BR><B>lights out in front of our house went on. No one was</B>
<BR><B>there! This all happened as if ity were a domino</B>
<BR><B>effect. One right after the other. Shortly after the</B>
<BR><B>experience (I would say 3 hours or so) The boys,</B>
<BR><B>including my husband, went out to pick up dinner for</B>
<BR><B>all of us. The two other wives went upstairs and began</B>
<BR><B>setting the table. I had a lot of laundry and things</B>
<BR><B>of that nature to get done.(We were in the hospital</B>
<BR><B>for almost two solid weeks before she passed) I began</B>
<BR><B>picking up my husbands laundry and carrying it into</B>
<BR><B>our laundry room. After it was in the washer, I</B>
<BR><B>quickly turned to the mirror, and pulled my hair back</B>
<BR><B>into a ponytail. At that moment, I felt my mother in</B>
<BR><B>laws arms around me. I knew it was her. I could even</B>
<BR><B>smell her. She was so short, that when she did hug me,</B>
<BR><B>her arms we pretty much around my waste, so I knew it</B>
<BR><B>was her. I wasn't scared, and it only lasted a few</B>
<BR><B>seconds. I think she saw me taking care of her son and</B>
<BR><B>it pleased her to know that I would always be there to</B>
<BR><B>take care of him. That was the only time that anything</B>
<BR><B>like that has ever happened to me.</B>

<BR><B>Moravian College Ghost Verification</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: higgsmax_2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I didn't think that my experience was significant</B>
<BR><B>enough to put on here, but after reading your index of</B>
<BR><B>haunted places I realize that I can verify some</B>
<BR><B>information for you. I was a student at Moravian</B>
<BR><B>College in Bethlehem, PA from 1992-1996, and I can</B>
<BR><B>tell you that yes, the old music building was used as</B>
<BR><B>a hospital for revolutionary war soldiers. I can also</B>
<BR><B>tell you that I used my student i.d. to "card" open a</B>
<BR><B>locked basement door (with my boyfriend, mom, and</B>
<BR><B>brother who were visiting) in that building to see if</B>
<BR><B>those legendary tunnels existed, and they do- and I've</B>
<BR><B>heard that they go all the way to a hotel up the</B>
<BR><B>street (I think it's the Sun Inn), but they're boarded</B>
<BR><B>up, and so creepy you wouldn't want to go in them</B>
<BR><B>anyway! The most fascinating thing I read on your</B>
<BR><B>website was that unexplained "lights" have been seen</B>
<BR><B>in the area of that building- I DEFINITELY saw</B>
<BR><B>something like that- My boyfriend and I were standing</B>
<BR><B>on the top floor of my dorm, "Main Hall," looking out</B>
<BR><B>the windows one night, and we saw what looked like a</B>
<BR><B>bright light move quickly from one window to the next</B>
<BR><B>on the building across from us, which is part of the</B>
<BR><B>old music building. We both immediately looked down at</B>
<BR><B>the yard, to see who had run by so quickly, and we</B>
<BR><B>were amazed to see that there was no one there. I</B>
<BR><B>would have thought I had imagined it if I had been</B>
<BR><B>alone when I saw this. A classmate of mine lived in</B>
<BR><B>Main Hall as well, and she said that whenever her</B>
<BR><B>roomate opened the door, the sound of their electric</B>
<BR><B>fan would change slightly because of the air pressure.</B>
<BR><B>So one day, she was sitting on her bed reading, and</B>
<BR><B>the fan sounded as though the door had been opened,</B>
<BR><B>although it hadn't, and the room got very cold for</B>
<BR><B>about 10 seconds. I'm not sure if that story is true</B>
<BR><B>or not, but there are many stories like that about Moravian.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I wanted to share my stories with someone and after reviewing your
site</B>
<BR><B>for many hours I felt more compelled to tell you my story.</B>
<BR><B>I'm 27 years old and have always had a strange sense about things
and</B>
<BR><B>people.&nbsp; As a child I was born and raised in Ft. Lauderdale,
FL and have</B>
<BR><B>experienced many unusual happenings.&nbsp; I grew up in this house
located</B>
<BR><B>at 1139 NW 17th Avenue and I never liked that place, I always had
the</B>
<BR><B>feeling that I was being watched in that house even when I was alone.</B>
<BR><B>I remember one instance when I was sleeping that I suddenly woke
to an</B>
<BR><B>uneasy feeling that someone was watching me when I opened my eyes
I saw</B>
<BR><B>a white hazy figure of a man in my doorway at first I thought it
was my</B>
<BR><B>father due to the fact that I was just waking his appearance did
not frighten</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; I got up to go to my parent's room to see if they were
a wake and</B>
<BR><B>found them sound a sleep.&nbsp; At first I didn't tell anyone in
the house</B>
<BR><B>but then my sister told me of one evening when she fell a sleep
on the</B>
<BR><B>couch and started to wake up to a white figured carrying her to
bed, she</B>
<BR><B>thought it was my mother but turned out it wasn't.</B>
<BR><B>Many of my sisters and brothers recall strange things going on in
that</B>
<BR><B>house and till this day we all still get a chill when we talk about
it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Not to mention that this house was right next door to what
at the time</B>
<BR><B>seemed like the creepiest place in the world.&nbsp; We use to call
it the old</B>
<BR><B>house and all are friends and us would play in there, we would scare
each</B>
<BR><B>other and just hang out.&nbsp; However, any time someone would move
in they</B>
<BR><B>would move out quickly, the last family and actually the only family
that</B>
<BR><B>I can recall living in that house moved out within three months.&nbsp;
They</B>
<BR><B>left an old abandoned car in the driveway, which didn't work or
even have</B>
<BR><B>a battery in it.&nbsp; I recall one day on my way to school hearing
music coming</B>
<BR><B>from the car and I was freaking out because I knew that car didn't
work.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;That night my sisters and brothers and I were in my parent's
room watching</B>
<BR><B>TV when I looked out the window to see the car engulfed in flames.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>father ran out the house to try and extinguish the fire, thank God
he</B>
<BR><B>was able too.</B>
<BR><B>We eventually moved out of that house and on to Massachusetts, but
something</B>
<BR><B>in that house still haunted me.&nbsp; For years after leaving that
house I</B>
<BR><B>would have nightmares about that place and it would be the same
dream</B>
<BR><B>"All my family moves back into the house, and its exactly the same
as</B>
<BR><B>it was when I was a child however, were all adults now and then
the dream</B>
<BR><B>changes and I'm alone looking around the house and I wander into
the kitchen</B>
<BR><B>an open the bottom cabinet and find a dead body of a young lady
in it."</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;You can imagine how terrifying these dreams must have been
for me.</B>
<BR><B>So in 1993 I took a trip back to Florida and I went back to that
house</B>
<BR><B>because this was the root to my dreams and the only way I was going
to</B>
<BR><B>get rid of these feelings were to confront whatever it was in that
house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;So I went there and took a picture of the house and titled
it my nightmare</B>
<BR><B>and confronted my past and till this day I have not had a dream
about</B>
<BR><B>that house again.</B>
<BR><B>I want to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to share my
story,</B>
<BR><B>believe me there is a lot more to it and one day if I have the time
and</B>
<BR><B>courage I will right it all down for you but till then I think this
will</B>
<BR><B>have to do.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghostly Fan</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: melanie.daniels@cmpco.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello again!&nbsp; My name is Melanie and I submitted a ghostly experience</B>
<BR><B>about a few months ago that I had outside of Reno NV in Virginia
City.</B>
<BR><B>An old saloon town.&nbsp; Anyways I thought I would share another
experience</B>
<BR><B>that I had more close to home.&nbsp; My mom's home.&nbsp; I was
visiting her one</B>
<BR><B>night and was spending the night there.&nbsp; It was about midnight
and my</B>
<BR><B>mom had fallen asleep on the couch.&nbsp; She sleeps sporatically
and wakes</B>
<BR><B>up automatically about every 2 hrs.&nbsp; So, she is asleep on the
couch and</B>
<BR><B>I am sitting in the recliner channel surfing as I am a wicked night</B>
<BR><B>owl.&nbsp; It was in the summertime so it was hot in the day but
more cool at</B>
<BR><B>night.&nbsp; Well right next to me on a chair we had one of those
double fans</B>
<BR><B>set up and before she fell asleep my mom shut the fan off and unplugged</B>
<BR><B>it.&nbsp; So here I am flicking, and out of the corner of my eye
I see the</B>
<BR><B>fans rotating.&nbsp; I just sort of looked over and watched these
fans</B>
<BR><B>rotating.&nbsp; I couldn't believe it.&nbsp; It sort of surprised
me but not</B>
<BR><B>really because my mom's apt. has a reputation for being haunted.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>have named the ghost Emily.&nbsp; I am not sure why, that is the
name that</B>
<BR><B>popped into my head one night.&nbsp; So I get up to make sure the
fan was off</B>
<BR><B>and unplugged and it was.&nbsp; My mom is still sleeping on the
couch.</B>
<BR><B>Periodically the fan does this throughout the night.&nbsp; I am
just sitting</B>
<BR><B>next to it just watching it.&nbsp; I said, Emily, I know you are
here what do</B>
<BR><B>you want?&nbsp; The fan goes on again. Apparently she was hot.&nbsp;
Then I hear</B>
<BR><B>my mom say who are you talking to as she had just woken up.&nbsp;
I was like</B>
<BR><B>oh just Emily, the fan has been going on and off all night and I
just</B>
<BR><B>thought I would try and communicate with her.&nbsp; My mom was like-it</B>
<BR><B>has?!!&nbsp; No sooner did she say that than the fan came on again.&nbsp;
I said -</B>
<BR><B>see Mom, look.&nbsp; We both turned and looked at it and started
laughing.</B>
<BR><B>This is one of many little episodes that happen.&nbsp; I should
mention we</B>
<BR><B>had no windows open or anything.&nbsp; Another thing that happened
one night,</B>
<BR><B>I was again crashing at my mom's as I lived in another state and
when I</B>
<BR><B>would come to Maine I would just stay at my mom's.&nbsp; So I was
in the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom getting ready to go out, my mom and I were gonna hit the
town</B>
<BR><B>of Portland and cause some chaos.&nbsp; We have fun.&nbsp; Anyways,
she just spent</B>
<BR><B>like forever in the bathroom getting ready and I was just freshening
up</B>
<BR><B>my hair touching up my lipstick and I hear this -MELANIE, MELANIE--HURRY</B>
<BR><B>UP!&nbsp; I come flying out of the bathroom saying - Mom you can
take forever</B>
<BR><B>to get ready and I just want to touch up and you're trying to rush
me!</B>
<BR><B>My mom just looked at me dumbfounded.&nbsp; I was like - why are
you looking</B>
<BR><B>at me funny and she said Melanie, I haven't said one word since
I've</B>
<BR><B>been out here.&nbsp; She was sitting on the couch watching t.v.&nbsp;
I was like</B>
<BR><B>you are joking right, you're teasing me.&nbsp; She sweared to God
that she</B>
<BR><B>wasn't and I told her what I had just heard and she was like -Oh
my</B>
<BR><B>God.&nbsp; That is weird.&nbsp; We chalked it up to Emily.&nbsp;
There are so many</B>
<BR><B>other strange things that happen in my mom's apt. Too many to write</B>
<BR><B>here, I have taken up enough of your time and space.&nbsp; I think
this</B>
<BR><B>website is the best one I have been on regarding paranormal activity.
I</B>
<BR><B>love it.&nbsp; Please keep up the good work!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Huge Black Thing!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lisa.folkard@allianceweb.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>My friend Helen and I had been in our local pub for most of the evening</B>
<BR><B>(we had been drinking Cola all night), but decided to walk down
to</B>
<BR><B>another one close by as there was a band we like playing there.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>town that we live in is quiet and "unassuming" so we though nothing
of</B>
<BR><B>walking through the cemetery that was on the way to the other pub</B>
<BR><B>(you're probably thinking "oh, here we go...another cemetery story!!!"),</B>
<BR><B>it was right in the middle of the two pubs so it was the usual,
quick</B>
<BR><B>walk.&nbsp; It was around 9:30pm on a Sunday night in October 1998,
so it was</B>
<BR><B>pretty dark.&nbsp; We chatted and walked down the path and into
the cemetery,</B>
<BR><B>not giving it a second though.....all of a sudden Helen grabbed
my arm</B>
<BR><B>and froze on the spot "what the f**k is that?" she gasped.&nbsp;
Thinking she</B>
<BR><B>was trying to scare me I just laughed and looked over to where she
was</B>
<BR><B>pointing.......I could feel her shaking as she held on to me.&nbsp;
To help</B>
<BR><B>you picture the scene, the path runs directly through the middle
of the</B>
<BR><B>cemetery with graves on both sides, the church to the left and a
row of</B>
<BR><B>cottages just the other side of the graves and a little hedge to
the</B>
<BR><B>right.</B>
<BR><B>To my horror, there was something very large, tall and black making
its</B>
<BR><B>way along the small road which runs along the side of the cottages.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>were only about 15 yards away, but there was absolute silence....no</B>
<BR><B>footsteps, breathing or noise of any kind.&nbsp; The "thing" was
sort of</B>
<BR><B>gliding along at a steady pace....as we couldn't see the bottom
of it</B>
<BR><B>because of the graves and a small hedge, we couldn't see any legs
or</B>
<BR><B>anything but the way it moved looked like it was on a bike!!&nbsp;
We both</B>
<BR><B>stood rooted to the spot and watched it for around 30 seconds.....it</B>
<BR><B>moved along the row of cottages and down a small alley that runs
along</B>
<BR><B>the side of the library.</B>
<BR><B>The odd thing was that it was huge, much taller than the downstairs</B>
<BR><B>windows of the cottages and it was a sort of square shape.&nbsp;
Its very</B>
<BR><B>hard to describe, but it was definitely not a person.&nbsp; It made</B>
<BR><B>absolutely no noise and moved very smoothly and slowly.</B>
<BR><B>We were terrified...when it had gone we just looked at each other
and</B>
<BR><B>ran back to the pub.&nbsp; We told a couple of our friends, but
they just</B>
<BR><B>laughed at us and said that we were seeing things, but we knew what
we'd</B>
<BR><B>seen and it really frightened us.&nbsp; We're not the kind of girls
that</B>
<BR><B>scare easily and are very level headed.</B>
<BR><B>On occasions we still mention it, we even went along there in daylight</B>
<BR><B>to try and find a sensible explanation...even trying to work out
how</B>
<BR><B>tall it must have been.&nbsp; But we never came up with anything..........</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Hope</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:k.rochon@shaw.ca</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in elementary school when a few of my friends
and I were into ouija boards, and the dark things that typical kids are
interested in at one point or another. I was always uncertain about it
because my friends of our family were always warning me about what could
happen, I never really believed in the supernatural. I came to find out
I was naive. It was grade 8 when 2 of my friends and I had made a ouija
board and I had been told that those are usually the worst kind because
of all the energies you put into them. My one friend was very spiritual
and did some kind of a spell or something on it to protect us, at this
point I still didn't believe in any of it. Anyway, I wouldn't play it because
of what my family friends had told me. The 2 girls started playing and
supposedly summoned up a spirit by the name of Hope. These girls weren't
always the most trusting people I had met so I thought they were just scaring
me. This "hope" girl said that she wanted to kill me. I honestly thought
that it was a joke, and then my mom came home and we stopped playing. It
wasn't until 1 year or so later that I had been sitting in class writing
notes just like any other day when I felt an unbearable pain in my left
arm. I happened to be sitting beside a Very catholic girl when I said "ow,
my arm really hurts" and she had turned to me looked at my arm and started
to gasp as both of us noticed that there were three welts appearing from
my knuckles to my elbow, then by my thumb what appeared to be an upside
down cross, and close to it was the word Hope. The girl then started praying
and I got up, terrified and ran to the main office and called my mother.
I had told her about what was happening and of course did not believe me
at all. She told me to stay calm and she would come to get me to go to
the doctors. It wasn't shortly after the call that she had arrived. We
went to my family physician and I had explained to her what happened with
a great deal of embarrassment as well as fear, knowing that no one would
believe me. She took a magnifying glass and used her fingers to run along
my skin to see if I had done myself, after the examination her face went
white, she called my mom in and said that she needed to talk to her, and
I asked if I could stay to hear, the doctor then told my mom that there
was absolutely no possible way that I could have done this to myself because
all the markings were under my skin. My mom then believed that this happened.
My doctor gave me a prayer to say at bedtime, I had put it in my moms purse
and when I got home to look at it it was gone. From that day, there were
many weird things that happened including hangers that were laying on our
bed that when we left and returned they were up in almost a triangle shape
on the bed standing up by themselves. I know this story is very unbelievable,
but it happened. I have no pictures to prove it but I will always have
the scar of Hope.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>Mr. Juliano,&nbsp; I felt that you are one of the few people that
would understand my story. I have a bit of psychic ability &amp; have had
a few experiences with channeling/ talking to or hearing spirits. But the
one I'm about to mention is&nbsp; the worst. Some friends &amp; I were
partying at a common friends home when we decided to go to the house next
door as this friend told us it was haunted &amp; being the thrill seakers
we were we decided to chaeck it out. When I first entered the house I felt
a voilent angry presence that I could not see. The hair on both my arms
was standing on end. But I was still OK being there. We walked into the
house &amp; up the stairs. According to my friend,&nbsp; the house used
to be an old boarding house in the early 20th century, but was bought by
a family when he was rel small&nbsp; that moved out 6 months later. As
we walked farther upstairs the feeling of the evil presence got stronger.
We went into the fisrt room where everything seemed pretty normal, we sat
down to talk &amp; the pictures in the room seemed to change. The facial
features / expressions went from happy to sad, the eyes seemed to watch
you/ move when you did &amp; the flowers seemed to die in another picture.
But that was the only unusual thing there.&nbsp; The next room we entered
was freezing cold &amp; this happened in mid August. If you know anything
about southern California you know it is atleast 95 degrees in August,
even at night.&nbsp; But nothing unusual happened in that room. The next
room was very strange. The floor had an unusual type of floor tile in it.
It appeared to have a Persian rug in it but that was the tile. When I first
entered I was extremely hot as if I was in an oven &amp; shortly after
I entered it felt as if someone reached inside&nbsp; me &amp; sqeezed my
guts, like pinched my stomache. It was almost an unbearable pain like an
ulcer attack or appenecitis. It hurt so bad I doubled over.Ihad to leave
the room for fear my insides would be ripped out. The next room was the
community bathroom. I sceamed when I walked in there because the whole
room was covered in blood.&amp; there was a body lying face down on the
floor. For some reason no one but me could see these things. When I walked
back to the hallway the preasence seemed to really be angry. One of my
friends started to chant a name "Millecent" over &amp; over again , first
loud then screaming. When one of us asked her who Millecent was she seemed
to fly into a rage &amp; severely beat up one of the guys who was with
us, who might I add in any other situation could have very easily overpowered
her. She then ripped the sole of his brand new tennis shoe off with&nbsp;
her bare hands. No matter how much we tried to calm her she would not be
calmed. She pushed me into the bathroom again&nbsp; &amp; this time it
was a spirit not a body that I saw in this blood drenched room. This spirit
was not the angry one, the angry one gave me a feeling it was a man. This
spirit was female. She was very sad looking &amp; very pretty. I asked
her what was wrong &amp; she said get your friends together &amp; get out
before he makes your friend kill you all. Who I asked, then she said the
man. What man I asked, then she said the man who died here first.&nbsp;
She then begged, "Please get her out of here!!! " With what appeared to
be tears running down her cheeks. With a strength I never knew I had, I
practically picked the fighting girl up by myself &amp; ran out of the
house screaming, "Let's get out of here!" Everyone followed behind me screaming
&amp; we went back to the friends house next door. As soon as we walked
out the door the screaming girl was her usual sweet self. She had no memory
of what happened after the first time we entered the bathroom &amp; when
we told her what happened she cried &amp; apologized deeply. We later found
out that a group of boarders&nbsp; were murdered by the owner, the angry
man, who was later held up by the sherriff &amp; killed himself in the
house. Which explained why he haunts the house &amp; tortured anyone who
moved in. We also found out Millecent was one of the murdered boarders.
I'm not one who is easy to scare but this experience still gives me nightmares
&amp; this happened 13 years ago. I found out several years ago this same
house was bought by a mental hospital &amp; was turned into a half way/outpatient
house. This only lasted a few months before they sold it &amp; the city
tore the house down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had many other experiences &amp;
will send them to you if you like. I also had a near death experience that
I can tell you about if you want to hear about it.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: menard6716@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, my Destiny and I am writing you about the story of mine and
my families story.&nbsp; In my house there are all kinds of noises and
once I even seen the fork for the woodburner in the air it&nbsp; was crazy
but not as crazy as my cousins story they were cleaning out this rentle
house for his grandma and every time they go over this house things get
wierder and wierder. Example... the heat in&nbsp; the house has a mind
of its own.&nbsp; The guy who used to live there would go to work and come
home and his cats would amost be dead because the ghost would turn the
heat up to its fullest capacity and try to kill the animals I guess. and
down in the bacment thier were words on the wall that say get out and it
looks like blood and every time my uncle paints over it it reapears when
he cleans the house .&nbsp; They told us that some hales angels used to
live there and they think that they murdered people in the bascment. If
you don't close the doors behind you also... they will close it themselves

<BR><B>Great Great Grandmother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Lilyrose4u@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here goes............</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was about 19 at the time (almost 30 years ago) and was invited
to a</B>
<BR><B>friend's home for dinner one evening.&nbsp; He and his wife and
I sat for some</B>
<BR><B>time talking when they told me how his grandmother had passed away
and they</B>
<BR><B>went to her home to collect some momentos.&nbsp; Among the things
they chose was a</B>
<BR><B>photo found face down in a closet of an unknown woman with a forlorn
look on</B>
<BR><B>her face.&nbsp;&nbsp; They liked the old frame so they brought the
photo home.&nbsp; After</B>
<BR><B>much research they found out it was his great-great grandmother's
picture.</B>
<BR><B>They were very glad to have the pic in their home.</B>
<BR><B>All evening long I could feel someone watching me and kept looking
over my</B>
<BR><B>shoulder, but of course, no one was there.&nbsp; Still the feeling
would not leave</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; When leaving their home I ran to my car feeling very spooked.&nbsp;
Once in</B>
<BR><B>the car I quickly locked the car, started the engine and booked.&nbsp;
Once out of</B>
<BR><B>the driveway though the feeling was gone.</B>
<BR><B>At bedtime that night after the lights went out, I felt a presence
in the</B>
<BR><B>dark.&nbsp; I immediately knew without a doubt that it was the great-great</B>
<BR><B>grandmother and I could tell exactly where she stood in the room.
Although I</B>
<BR><B>had been scared&nbsp; earlier in the evening at my friend's home,
here I felt at</B>
<BR><B>ease.&nbsp; I "spoke" to her with thoughts and told her how happy
I was that she</B>
<BR><B>was in a home with people who loved her and wanted her there with
them.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>next thing I remember it was morning.&nbsp; I never felt her again.&nbsp;
Make of this</B>
<BR><B>what you wish but in my mind I was visited by that spirit.</B>

<P><B>For the past few weeks I have had strange things happening in my
house. A</B>
<BR><B>few weeks ago I was on my computer typing up my coursework when
it felt as</B>
<BR><B>if someone was wathcing me do my work, so I thought nothing of it.
Then for</B>
<BR><B>the past few nights i have been sat in my bedroom writing poems
and i saw a</B>
<BR><B>shadow run past my bedroom door. I went downstairs thinking that
someone had</B>
<BR><B>broken into my house or something and I searched the house and there
wasnt</B>
<BR><B>anything there. I went upstairs and put my CD player on. I was listening
to</B>
<BR><B>my favourite CD when I heard the Cd skip. I looked up and saw a
girl sat at</B>
<BR><B>the bottom of my bed giggling. I felt tired and ignored it as my
mind</B>
<BR><B>playing tricks on me. i fell asleep on my bed that night and in
the middle</B>
<BR><B>of the nioght felt something sat on the edge of my bed stroking
my face. I</B>
<BR><B>looked up and there wasnt anything there. I paniced went downstairs
and</B>
<BR><B>thought it was because i was tired and just imagining things. Then
last</B>
<BR><B>night i was alone in my house when i heard someone say my name.
I asked if</B>
<BR><B>anyone was there, and nothing happened. I went and sat in the front
room and</B>
<BR><B>carried on watching the TV. I went up into the attic and felt something
on</B>
<BR><B>my shoulder and looked round. There want anything there, so i arried
on</B>
<BR><B>playing on the Playstation. Then i heard something banging up the
stairs, i</B>
<BR><B>paniked because my front door has an alarm on it so it beeps when
it opens</B>
<BR><B>and i hadnt heard the door beep, and i saw six nails fall out of
the wall.</B>
<BR><B>Then i looked round and saw a shadow of someone standing next to
me. i</B>
<BR><B>screamed (as you would) and sat downstairs. I went into the bathroom
and</B>
<BR><B>washed my face. i looked in the mirror and saw the shadow behind
me and then</B>
<BR><B>it disappeared. I fell asleep and kept feeling someone sat on my
bed. Then</B>
<BR><B>my dad told me the same happened to him when he was my age and his
mum told</B>
<BR><B>him was the ghost of his nanna looking after him because he was
her</B>
<BR><B>favourite randchild. Do you think my great great grandma could still
be</B>
<BR><B>looking down on me after about fifty years after her death?</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SAMIAMXOX12@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>a few years ago when me and my friends were sleeping outside, and
my friends</B>
<BR><B>went in the house to go to the bathroom and after they left I was
cleaning up</B>
<BR><B>the spilled soda and something walked all around the whole tent.
So after I</B>
<BR><B>saw that I walked around the tent to see if anyone was there and
no one was</B>
<BR><B>so I freaked and ran inside.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I also have ghosts in my room. I live in the attic and it
gets really hot</B>
<BR><B>and really cold. When its really hot there is something standing,
sitting, or</B>
<BR><B>laying next to me, the same thing when its really y cold out to
but it not</B>
<BR><B>cold it really warm.</B>

<P><B>Story Never Told</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: halvorson@skaminia.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've never told anyone about my ghost story except for family. Some
laugh at me some beleive.</B>
<BR><B>When I was younger and living at home I had cause a bad argrument
between my parents on whether we needed to buy a horse trailer to haul
my horse to shows. It was bad enough that my dad had threaten to leave
the house, or this cast a divorce. It was bad enough I was to blame for
the fight but for my dad to leave I didn't want&nbsp; to hear more so I
left the room.</B>
<BR><B>I went into my bedroom and went to bed. I had not been in there
very long when I could hear what sounded like someone walking in the attic,
from the head of my bed to the foot and back again. It happen several times,
back and forth. Each time it happen I felt better, that nothing bad was
going to happen with my parents fight.</B>
<BR><B>The only thing I could really decribe the sound of the steps was
that it sounded like my grandmother. She always worn a shoe that had a
slight heel. When I was small she always protected me from my mom when
I had gotten in trouble.</B>
<BR><B>The problem with it being her in the attic was our attic was only
a crawl space type. You could not stand in it. And my grandmother died
when I was 6 years old, I was 13 when the fight happened.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghostly Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wasmuth1@csuol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was spending the night at a friend's house and we got really bored.&nbsp;
We were sitting around trying to think of what to do when my friend's mother
walked in.&nbsp; She asked us if we wanted to hear a ghost story and we
all hurriedly agreed.&nbsp; She told us that a long time ago, she had been
riding around with her friends when they ran out of gas.&nbsp; The boys
started walking towards a farm they saw and the girls decided to explore
an old house they saw.&nbsp; They went and didn't find anything interesting
on the first floor so they decided to look at the second.&nbsp; They found
a room with the door closed and were wondering how it got closed because
it was obvious that noone had been in there for quite a while.&nbsp; They
stood there talking about it when the door swung open.&nbsp; They stared
at it for a minute then decided to go in.&nbsp; They knew they had nothing
to fear from the spirit world.&nbsp; So they went in and saw some pictures
on the wall.&nbsp; In the pictures was a little girl with long black hair
tied in a white ribbon.&nbsp; She looked sad.&nbsp; The creepy thing though
is there was blood splattered on the frames.&nbsp; They were kind of spooked
by that but still wanted to explore the rest of the room.&nbsp; There was
a big walk-in closet so they went in to it and kept the door propped open
with a shoe.&nbsp; They were looking at all the old clothes when something
fell off of the shelf.&nbsp; One of the girls picked it up and said she
thought it was a wig.&nbsp; She held it up.&nbsp; It was a scalp with long
dark hair tied with a white ribbon.&nbsp; Needless to say, they freaked.&nbsp;
They ran to open the door which had slammed closed but it wouldn't open.&nbsp;
They turned around to look for a window when they saw the little girl standing
there.&nbsp; She held out her hand to them and they saw blood on it.&nbsp;
The door suddenly opened and they bolted.&nbsp; They never went down that
road again.&nbsp; They got curious and searched the obituaries for a story
on the little girl.&nbsp; It turned out she was scalped by some Indians
back in the day.</B>

<P><B>Ghostly Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jason@OES.zzn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had a few ghostly encounters in the past</B>
<BR><B>two years.&nbsp; I created my own Urban Exploration</B>
<BR><B>society in August of 2000 (Ohio Exploration</B>
<BR><B>Society - OES).&nbsp; We go out to old abandoned</B>
<BR><B>buildings, cemeteries, towns, Indian Mounds, and</B>
<BR><B>anything else that is of historic nature in</B>
<BR><B>Ohio.&nbsp; When at these places we take photos,</B>
<BR><B>gather information, and take EMF readings for</B>
<BR><B>ghosts.&nbsp; Below are a few things that have</B>
<BR><B>happened while on some of our outings.</B>
<BR><B>Junction City Prison:</B>
<BR><B>Near Lancaster, Ohio there's an old abandoned</B>
<BR><B>prison. We decided to investigate it one night</B>
<BR><B>in August around 1:30am. Everything was fine for</B>
<BR><B>most of the trip, until we came down some stairs</B>
<BR><B>near the middle of the building. Upon exiting</B>
<BR><B>the stairwell, the air got very cold (we could</B>
<BR><B>almost see our breath). I pulled out the EMF</B>
<BR><B>reader and tried following this cold spot, but</B>
<BR><B>lost it. I thought it had went into a room</B>
<BR><B>across from us, so I went in. While walking</B>
<BR><B>through this small room, one of my friends in</B>
<BR><B>the hallway yelled, "It just went past me and</B>
<BR><B>followed you into the room!" When I turned, my</B>
<BR><B>right arm from my elbow to the tips of my</B>
<BR><B>fingers got very cold and numb. The reading on</B>
<BR><B>the EMF Meter jumped to 100 and stayed there. I</B>
<BR><B>ran back out into the hallway, the cold spot</B>
<BR><B>following me. As I turned, a female member of</B>
<BR><B>the OES froze in her place. She stayed like this</B>
<BR><B>for a few moments and then collapsed, crying.</B>
<BR><B>She said that she felt the cold go right through</B>
<BR><B>her body. She became VERY VERY cold and her</B>
<BR><B>whole body had that pins and needles feeling</B>
<BR><B>(like when your foot falls asleep). Needless to</B>
<BR><B>say we got the hell out of there. On a visit a</B>
<BR><B>few weeks later, a few of us went in to explore</B>
<BR><B>the first floor while two female members waited</B>
<BR><B>outside. We were the only people in the</B>
<BR><B>building, and only stayed on the first floor.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing unusual happened to us, but the ladies</B>
<BR><B>who waited for us in the car saw several people</B>
<BR><B>looking out the window at them and moving around</B>
<BR><B>on the third floor. Again, we were the ONLY</B>
<BR><B>people in the building and ONLY on the first</B>
<BR><B>floor.</B>
<BR><B>Elisabeth's Grave</B>
<BR><B>There is an old cemetery in the backroads of</B>
<BR><B>Chillicothe called Mt. Union - Pleasant Valley</B>
<BR><B>Cemetery and it's the site of Elisabeth's Grave.</B>
<BR><B>There's a couple versions of the story, but we</B>
<BR><B>believe that what really happened was a</B>
<BR><B>combination of the two. About 125 years ago,</B>
<BR><B>Elisabeth inherited the land of her late</B>
<BR><B>husband. This was prime farming land and many of</B>
<BR><B>the local men were upset that a female came into</B>
<BR><B>control of it. They hang her in an old tree near</B>
<BR><B>the rear of the cemetery mentioned above. She</B>
<BR><B>was then cut down, dragged across the cemetery,</B>
<BR><B>and beheaded in the opposite corner (near a tree</B>
<BR><B>that stands there today) and died. Anyway, she</B>
<BR><B>was buried in the front of the cemetery with her</B>
<BR><B>husband, but the tombstone always moves to the</B>
<BR><B>rear of the cemetery, near the place of her</B>
<BR><B>death. When we visited one night around 1:45am,</B>
<BR><B>we had VERY high EMF readings in the rear of the</B>
<BR><B>cemetery next to the place where she died, and</B>
<BR><B>the air temp dropped about 10 degrees. On the</B>
<BR><B>first visit we found some tombstones piled up in</B>
<BR><B>a circle formation with various bones scattered</B>
<BR><B>in the middle of them. As we were looking at</B>
<BR><B>this, we heard something coming through the</B>
<BR><B>woods toward us. We high-tailed it back to the</B>
<BR><B>car (about 100 yards away) and turned back to</B>
<BR><B>see what was there. We could see something</B>
<BR><B>moving where the tombstone circle was, but</B>
<BR><B>couldn't determining what it was...even after</B>
<BR><B>shining our 500,000 candle power spot light at</B>
<BR><B>it. On another visit we heard strange noises</B>
<BR><B>coming towards us through a field across from</B>
<BR><B>the cemetery. Again we shined our spot light</B>
<BR><B>into the field but saw nothing. This place</B>
<BR><B>definitely gives off an eriee vibe.</B>

<P><B>By: lrsmith@mergetel.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My dad died about six years ago and I was going to the</B>
<BR><B>cemetery to visit with him with my wife, Jane. No one knows how
he died. The Doctor Headmaster, Wayne Jefferson,thinks he probably had
a heart-attack....But that wasn't what I thought.We Drove up to the metal
gates, but</B>
<BR><B>for some reason, the gates were locked. "The gates are never locked."
said Jane. "I know." I answered. I got out</B>
<BR><B>of the car and tried to pry the lock off with a cro-bar- But it</B>
<BR><B>was no good. "Can we get the gravekeeper over here please!" I yelled.
There was a hut just across the street. Just then, a man walked out of
the hut. The mysterious man walked slowly across the street and when he
walked</B>
<BR><B>up to the gates, my wife yelled "Sweet mother of God!!!"</B>
<BR><B>Why did she say that? Because that strange mysterious</B>
<BR><B>man walked right through the gates! It was impossible! We both just
stood there rooted to the spot. As the man</B>
<BR><B>walked through the gates, he seemed to disappear. Just</B>
<BR><B>then, the lock fell off of the gates and the gates opened automatically.
My wife and I were to scared to go in that</B>
<BR><B>cemetery. We rushed in the car and zoomed off at a very</B>
<BR><B>high speed. We thought we were safe- But when we got</B>
<BR><B>back to our house, that same lock was on our front door.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Man</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is something my mother told me once, and I can't see why</B>
<BR><B>she'd make it up so I accept it as truth. I was(fortunately) too</B>
<BR><B>young to remember the incident so I can only take her word for it</B>
<BR><B>you know?</B>
<BR><B>One night, she said, when I was three years old, I woke up</B>
<BR><B>everyone in the house screaming. When she came into my bedroom,
I</B>
<BR><B>was crying and pointing to a corner of my room, screaming "The</B>
<BR><B>man! The man!" Apparently I had seen a completely black figure</B>
<BR><B>standing in the corner of my room near the closet staring at me.</B>
<BR><B>Well, the 'black figure' tale has been around longer than I have,</B>
<BR><B>so maybe it was an actual haunting from the 'other' kind of</B>
<BR><B>ghosts. Luckily I haven't had any more encounters with The Man.
It</B>
<BR><B>certainly could have been a figment of my overactive imagination</B>
<BR><B>(horror movies terrified me to no end and gave me plenty of</B>
<BR><B>nightmares), but I still wonder about it sometimes.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>"Ghost" in Gulfport Mississippi</B>

<P><B>By: Lyn1307@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>hi,</B>
<BR><B>my name is paula mason...</B>
<BR><B>i used to live in gulfport ms. in a little ranch style house on
Kathy st.&nbsp; my husband david (now ex) and i moved there from medford
n.j.&nbsp; both of us are from mississippi, and he had just been discharged
from the air force...the very first day that we went looking for our first
home we found the house on Kathy street.&nbsp; when we walked into the
house i could hear the word&nbsp; "home" in my head.&nbsp; almost like
someone actually spoke it to me... we bid on the house immediately and
soon moved in.&nbsp; we found out that the previous owner was an older
lady who had gotten ill and moved to Texas with her daughter... and she
later died.&nbsp; david and i had a small son Zachary he was about 24 months
old or so.&nbsp;&nbsp; i always felt&nbsp; so at peace in that home....
very comfortable... in fact when my mother came to see the house the first
thing she said to me was... Paula does this just have the warmest feeling
to you don't you feel like you are home?&nbsp; after that we all often
joked a WHen i asked him what lady, he replied "The old lady that comes
and watches over me when i sleep." (Zack was about 3 1/2 at the time)&nbsp;
Needless to say he slept with me that night!&nbsp; later after david and
i split up i talked to one of the neighbors that had known the lady.. i
described to her the image of the lady or shadow that i had seen and told
her about zacks visits with the lady.&nbsp; the neighbor told me that i
had described her to a T and that the lady had been known as the "grandma"
of the neighborhood&nbsp; because all of the children had loved her so
very much... my ex still lives at the house...</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghost Magnet</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Lexx7007@mail2sexy.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I baby-sit for these people all the time, and I love their kids.
They are so great! We always seem to have fun at their house, but yet I
am so scared to be alone there. I notice that the kids didn't like being
alone either. They were fine when they were in their rooms, but anywhere
else in the house they always wanted me to go with them. The first time
I stayed there was one weekend a few weeks ago. The parents were going
out of town on business, and they told me I could sleep in the extra bedroom
on the lower level. (Their house was three levels.) The kids had their
bedrooms on the upper level; the second was the main floor with the living
room, kitchen, dinning room, bathroom, and another bedroom. The basement
had the extra bedroom with open space for the kids to play. (Which they
never played down there unless an adult was around)</B>
<BR><B>The first night I slept there I had to sleep with the lights on
because I felt like someone was watching me, and it bothered me so much.
It took me a while to go to sleep, but soon I did. I remember waking up,
and going to open the door to go to the bathroom, but the bedroom door
was stuck. I tried hard to open the door, but it just wouldn't budge. I
sat on the bed, and thought for a while as to why it wouldn't open. Then
I remembered it locked from the outside. (Just to let you know this is
a very old house build in the late 1800's early 1900's some where around
there.) After about an hour and five more tries I heard the kids come down
stairs, and then I went for the door, and it opened. It was really weird.</B>
<BR><B>At nighttime I put the kids to sleep, and they wouldn't let me leave
them until they fell fast asleep. So I would read them stories, and sit
in silence until they dosed off. (Another important note, their stairs
to the house makes noise as you go up, and down them)</B>
<BR><B>I went to the main level, and cleaned up a little before going to
sleep. The basement door would be closed, and you can see it from the kitchen.
Because the house is so old it still has its old doors with the funny looking
knobs. This bothers me because some times I think someone is looking at
me through the key in to the basement door while I do the dishes.</B>
<BR><B>I went to bed down stairs in the basement, and this time I left
on all the lights, and left the door to the bedroom open. I recall it was
around 3am when I woke up to the sound of a door slamming shut. It took
me a while to realize that it was the bedroom door that shut. I jumped
out of bed, and tried to open the door. It was once again locked. I was
so scared that I started to cry, and I knew that no one could hear me because
the kids were three levels up, and the parents were out of town. After
what seemed like two hours the door opened, and I took all my stuff up
to the main level, and stayed there.</B>
<BR><B>That morning the kids had to be up and ready for church. They left
with their grandmother, and I was stuck at the house for several hours
alone. I was very tired because I was up since 3am, and couldn't get back
to sleep. I think somewhere around noon I had dosed off on the floor were
I was kinda in front of the stairway that lead up to the kids rooms. I
remember lying on my back, and I awoke to the sound of the stairs making
noise as though someone was coming down them. I remember seeing a glance
of a woman in white walking by me. I was stuck to the floor. It felt like
I had a several pounds of pressure on my body keeping me held down. What
was even scarier was that I couldn't move my head to see where the woman
had gone. My heart started to beat fast, and my eyes got really heavy.
All I remember after that was passing out cold. I woke up again, and my
heart was still racing. I jumped up, and looked around to find nothing.
I wish I could explain how my body felt, but all I know is that it was
really lite. I grabbed their phone, and went outside on the porch were
I called my mom, and told her everything. I knew she would believe me because
I have had other experiences with ghosts at my best friend's house. (But
that is another story) I started crying, and waited until the kids got
back. I didn't set foot into the house until then.</B>
<BR><B>My mom told me not to tell Norm, and Becky (the parents) because
she didn't want me to lose my baby-sitting job. Nothing happened again
after the weird lady coming down the stairs. I still baby-sit for them,
but I won't sleep in the basement anymore, and I sometimes have a hard
time sleeping on the main level as well.</B>
<BR><B>Some times I think I am just a ghost magnet waiting to get hit.
I seem to always experience paranormal phenomena, and psychic things, (which
is yet another story I should share) but I don’t know how to explain them,
and why they happen to me. Reading these stories from other people kinda
makes me feel a little better because I know I am not the only one. Thank
you so much for taking the time to read this.</B>
