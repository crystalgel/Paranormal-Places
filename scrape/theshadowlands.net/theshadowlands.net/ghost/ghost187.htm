<br><b>The Tall Rector</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: stressed_teacher@yahoo.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I discovered your website a few months ago whilst teaching my students
how to use the Internet.&nbsp; I am really impressed with it’s content
and the opportunity that it gives people across the world to share their
ghostly experiences.&nbsp; I live in England’s smallest county – Rutland.&nbsp;
Rutland is situated in the middle of the country, practically due north
of London by about 150/200 miles (300/400 kilometres).&nbsp; The ghostly
experiences that I am about to recount, occurred at my parents house in
a village called Knossington.&nbsp; Knossington is situated 4 miles outside
Oakham.&nbsp; Oakham is the county administrative town of Rutland.</b>
<br><b>Ghostly Experience #1: It was a bright and sunny April late afternoon/early
evening in 1990.&nbsp; I was 16 years old.&nbsp; My parents live in a large
5-Bedroom house towards the top of the village, opposite the public house.&nbsp;
The house was originally the village Rectory, belonging to the village
church (Church of England) – hence our theory for believing our resident
ghost is one of the previous village Rectors.&nbsp; My parents bought the
house in 1985, from the Church of England.&nbsp; My parents are in no way
employed by the church.&nbsp; Anyway, back to the story!</b>
<br><b>I was sitting in our Study, located towards the front of the house.&nbsp;
As I said before, it was a bright and sunny day.&nbsp; Very calm, blue
skies and a generally pleasant evening was forecast.&nbsp; It was about
6.30pm and I had just got in from school.&nbsp; My brother was staying
on at school that evening and my parents were both in the Kitchen (about
100 yards away from the Study), having just opened a bottle of wine.&nbsp;
I was listening to music on the stereo system in the Study, sitting in
a comfortable chair – with the music not too loud!&nbsp; Suddenly, I looked
over to the Study door (which is one of the old-style Victorian panel doors.&nbsp;
It doesn’t even close properly) and observed it slowly – about 2 or 3 inches
– open.&nbsp; It then stopped, the handle turned and rattled (although
I heard no sound).&nbsp; The door then proceeded to open a further 2 or
3 inches.&nbsp; I can remember this so clearly.&nbsp; It is still vivid
in my mind.</b>
<br><b>I wasn’t scared.&nbsp; I just thought it was my father playing a
trick on me (it is the sort of thing he would do!).&nbsp; I continued to
sit in the chair and look at the door – convinced that it was my father
playing tricks.&nbsp; It must have been only a couple of seconds at the
most when I decided to go outside the study and confront and that time
what I thought to be my father.&nbsp; Certainly, 2 seconds would not have
given him enough time to get away from the door.&nbsp; When I opened the
Study door and looked just outside the room, there was no body there.&nbsp;
This puzzled me and I went back into the Study.&nbsp; The music was still
playing as softly as before (I think it was a CD of music from the 1960’s).&nbsp;
I decided to go into the Kitchen and confront my father about what had
just happened – I was certain at this stage that it was him.</b>
<br><b>In the Kitchen, my mother and father were drinking wine and talking.&nbsp;
There had not been enough time for either one of them to rush back into
the kitchen – certainly without me hearing them.&nbsp; Anyway, I told them
both at this stage what had just happened.&nbsp; They were both astounded.&nbsp;
Now, if either one of them had had anything to do with this, they would
have made their knowledge of the situation known – either by a wry smile
or being over-enthusiastic about my story.&nbsp; I know my parents!&nbsp;
There was none of that.&nbsp; They were totally bewildered as to what had
happened to me and why I should automatically believe it was either of
them playing a trick.</b>
<br><b>Looking back, I really do not believe either my mother or my father
had anything to do with this experience.&nbsp; I do, however, believe that
the house is haunted by the ghost of a previous Rector – possibly from
the 19th Century.&nbsp; My Grandfather has actually seen the ghost (he
saw a figure in the garden of the house, dressed in old-fashioned clerical
dress and it was taller than average) – and he is certainly not one to
play tricks.</b>

<br><b>The Ghostly Clock</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ghostly Experience #2: My second ghostly experience, does not concern
The Tall Rector.&nbsp; However, it did occur in the same house about 3
years after my first experience.</b>
<br><b>My Great Aunt owns a clock, which currently stands on her mantelpiece
at her home and used to belong to a young girl in the early 1970’s who
was a brilliant, promising musician.&nbsp; The story, as my Great Aunt
tells it, goes that the young girl (no relation to our family) committed
suicide one day, through sheer unhappiness with a certain aspect of her
life.</b>
<br><b>A few years later, when the clock was in the possession of my Great
Aunt and Uncle (my Uncle passed away in 1977, when I was 3 years old),
they were both sitting at their home.&nbsp; Again, it was a bright and
sunny spring afternoon.&nbsp; My Great Aunt commented to her husband that
it looked to her as if there was water running down the face of the clock.&nbsp;
MY Great Uncle replied with, “Don’t be so stupid, you’re imagining it”!&nbsp;
However, on closer inspection, he too could see water running down the
face of the clock.&nbsp; My Great Aunt told me later that she took these
to be tears (due to the tragic nature of the previous owner’s – the young
girl – death).</b>
<br><b>The years passed and the clock had eventually stopped working.&nbsp;
As it is a beautiful antique, my mother commented that it was a shame not
to enjoy it fully and asked my Great Aunt if she could take it to a local
clockmakers in Oakham to have it repaired to it’s former glory.&nbsp; The
clock, by the way, stands only at 6” high.</b>
<br><b>In 1993, when I had this ghostly experience, the clock was in our
house in Knossington.&nbsp; Now, it was October and the time was approximately
8.45pm – so it was well and truly dark outside.&nbsp; I had just arrived
back home, after collecting my traditional British Fish and Chip supper.&nbsp;
The lighting in the room was soft, the television was only in standby mode.&nbsp;
All was quiet.&nbsp; My mother was working alone in the Study (where I
had my previous ghostly experience), with no radio or TV on – just working
in silence.</b>
<br><b>As I sat down, about to switch on the television in our living room
(which is a good way away from our Study, I heard music – similar to that
of a music box – coming from the corner of the room.&nbsp; It only played
for about 10 seconds, but I heard it as clear as anything – it was enough
time for me to consider the options as to it’s source.&nbsp; Was it coming
from outside?&nbsp; We live in a very quiet village – there was definitely
no noise coming from either outside or insider the house.&nbsp; No, this
music was coming from that corner of the room – inside the house.</b>
<br><b>A few days later, I recalled the story to my Great Aunt who picked
up on it straight away.&nbsp; She told me that it was because that clock
had been in the house at the time I heard the music and that the music
I heard related to the young girl’s love of music (the music I heard was
certainly not joyous – quite sad).</b>
<br><b>My Great Aunt always has told me, that if you ever think you heard
or saw something – don’t let anyone tell you that you imagined it.&nbsp;
You really did hear or see something and only you can ever know that.&nbsp;
She also told me, never be afraid of the dead.&nbsp; They can’t hurt you.&nbsp;
It’s the living that you should be afraid of!</b>
<br><b>These are the only 2 ghostly experiences I have ever had.&nbsp;
They didn’t frighten me at the time – and I am still not afraid to be alone
in my parents house.&nbsp; I find it an extremely peaceful house.&nbsp;
Someone is watching over the house and also our family.</b><b></b>

<br><b>GYPSIES CEMETERY</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: djs1@netnitco.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>gypsies cemetery is located off interstate 65 north of rout 2 in
indiana.</b>
<br><b>gypsies cemetery is located on a small wooded lot and has a history
that dates back to the 1800s. The name "gypsies cemetery" gets its name
from when a group of gypsies set camp in this wooded area when the black
pleague first came around and a large number of gypsies where burried there.&nbsp;
Now if you go out their at night and walk around the back end of the cemetery
for a while , most of the time you can get a sample of the paranormal .
Such as strange smells, warm spots/chills, whispering, traces of light,
glowing areas.&nbsp; Ive had good results using a 35mm flash camera with
taking pictures of different areas and getting results of human shadows,
traces of light, and objects that arent really their.&nbsp; like any hunts
for the paranormal remeber to use caution and hunt with only true believers.
some say that their are non-human ghosts also which can be dangerous.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Weird Stuff</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jamesadavine@sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>i will tell you about some strange experiences i have had in my past.</b>
<br><b>when i was 3 years old i lived in an old house in toronto canada,and
most nights i can remember from about the age of 3 to 5 ,i would run up
the stairs to my bedroom fearing this strange black cloudy looking shape.</b>
<br><b>this would happen once or twice a week at first,then later on ,a
few times a week.</b>
<br><b>it would follow me up the stairs and stop when it got to my bedroom
door.</b>
<br><b>no-one ever saw it except my little brother who at this time was
two years old.</b>
<br><b>he was sitting in our bedroom,playing with some army men when he
shouted at the top of his lungs at me,LOOK AT THAT!</b>
<br><b>i looked up and saw the same thing that usually would follow me,standing,or"
floating",in front of the door,then it disappeared into thin air ,like
it dissolved.</b>
<br><b>that was the last time i saw it,for years.</b>
<br><b>Well the year is 1996,and one night my girlfriend and i were sleeping
in our apartment,and i found myself wide awake at 4:00 am,my girlfriend
was sound asleep,and all of a sudden ,"all i can say is i felt electricity
running all through my body"like when you get a small shock and for a split
second you feel the charge.</b>
<br><b>but it was constant,not painful, but felt like i was vibrating at
a very high speed.</b>
<br><b>suddenly i saw the figure i had seen so many times as a child,floating
two or three feet away from us,and for the first time it's presence was
terrifyingly dark or evil feeling,and all of a sudden i felt like it wanted
to hurt my girlfriend.i'm not sure how i knew this, it was more like a
"sense" of harm towards her.</b>
<br><b>the next thing that happened is what really, freaks me out when
i think of it.</b>
<br><b>i jumped out of bed and grabbed one of the antique knives my mother
gave to me,off of the dresser,and lunged straight at this thing and started
to swing wildly at it,</b>
<br><b>the funny thing about it is,ifelt strangly calm about the whole
idea of charging this thing and trying to stab it ,almost as if it were
somebody else moving my body for me.</b>
<br><b>and it just "dissolved into thin air just like the last time i had
seen it years before.</b>
<br><b>i'm wondering what took a hold of me that night to so carelessly
jump into something i had no idea of ,what it would ,and could do to me.anyway
my girlfriend slept through the whole thing.</b>
<br><b>i went back to bed after about an hour,and at about 6:30 am,i woke
up to see it again,but it disappeared again almost as soon as i saw it,needless
to say,i didn't go back to sleep again that night,the only thing my girlfriend
noticed and informed me of ,is that the antique knife i had "stabbed" the
thing with was missing,it's been five years since this happened and i have
never recovered the knife.</b>
<br><b>also since then i have not had anymore strange things,happen to
me.</b>

<br><b>Sisters Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Koda67@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This story takes place back in 1982-1983
in our old house in Spring lake</b>
<br><b>Michigan.&nbsp; The house we grew up in was a fairly large house
located by a</b>
<br><b>small lake called Spring lake.&nbsp; This house was a white two-story,
surrounded</b>
<br><b>by several large oak trees, that would make shadows on the walls
inside the</b>
<br><b>bedrooms on windy moonlight nights.&nbsp; The "incident" that I
wanted to write</b>
<br><b>about happened around 2:00 am one night when I was not sleeping
very well.</b>
<br><b>The bedrooms are located upstairs along a hallway with two chandelier
lamps,</b>
<br><b>one at the beginning and end of the hall.&nbsp; My sister Jessisa's
bedroom was</b>
<br><b>located next to the stairs leading down to the kitchen, as mine
was located</b>
<br><b>near the opposite end next to my parents room.&nbsp; As I mentioned
earlier, I was</b>
<br><b>not sleeping very well that night and got up to use the bathroom.&nbsp;
The light</b>
<br><b>on my end of the hall was on, as the light on the other end was
not.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>walked out of my bedroom and noticed my sister standing on the landing</b>
<br><b>looking down into the darkness of the staircase.&nbsp; This was
obviously strange</b>
<br><b>for several reasons, but what really struck me was that she appeared
to not</b>
<br><b>even notice me as I came from my bedroom.&nbsp; She looked to be
searching for</b>
<br><b>something very intently down in the darkness.&nbsp; I said her name
a number of</b>
<br><b>times, and as I did, I would take a small step toward her.&nbsp;
After a few</b>
<br><b>moments, she finally looked up at me, and for some reason she looked
very</b>
<br><b>angry or bothered by the fact that I was distracting her.&nbsp;
I mentioned her</b>
<br><b>name again and asked her what she was doing, and I don't remember
really</b>
<br><b>hearing anything as she went running down the stairs into the dark.&nbsp;
I stood</b>
<br><b>there a moment in awe of this strange happening, but followed her
after a</b>
<br><b>moment.&nbsp; I went down into the kitchen that was still pitch
black, because she</b>
<br><b>still had not turned any lights on.&nbsp; I was pretty spooked by
this time and</b>
<br><b>began looking around for her.&nbsp; I looked in the family room,
living room,</b>
<br><b>kitchen, basement, and even outside on the back deck.&nbsp; I could
not find her</b>
<br><b>anywhere, and given the manner that I was searching, my sister would
have to</b>
<br><b>walk past me to get back to her room upstairs.&nbsp; I spent quite
awhile doing</b>
<br><b>this before I gave up.&nbsp; There was no other place to look and
I did not see or</b>
<br><b>hear anything.&nbsp; I decided that I better go back upstairs and
tell my folks</b>
<br><b>what had happened, and as I returned upstairs and walked past her
room, I</b>
<br><b>stopped and looked in.&nbsp; My body felt numb as I stared at my
sister fast</b>
<br><b>asleep in her bed.&nbsp; I don't know the person that I saw or spoke
with moments</b>
<br><b>ago in the hall, but it seems that it was not my sister.&nbsp; I
still get chills</b>
<br><b>thinking about it.&nbsp; To this day my sister does not know anything
about it,</b>
<br><b>and my father thinks that I dreamed the whole thing.&nbsp; Who knows,
maybe I did.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As time passes I wonder sometimes if I did dream everything
that happened</b>
<br><b>that night, but it all still seems very real to me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Childhood Fright</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: waterbugging@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Something that I can never forget.&nbsp; When I was a child I remember
once</b>
<br><b>visiting my grandmother that lives in a small village outside of
Saarbruken,</b>
<br><b>Germany.&nbsp; She has this old house that must be over one hundred
and fifty</b>
<br><b>years old, the kind of house with no central air and the walls are
about a</b>
<br><b>foot think of concrete always keeping the place chill and silent.&nbsp;
There is</b>
<br><b>a room in the three story house that is made up real nice, a second
type of</b>
<br><b>living room area with real nice furniture and old style stuff in
there.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>always kept the door closed (but never locked) because I guess she
didn’t</b>
<br><b>want the children in there breaking anything expensive.&nbsp; I
always thought</b>
<br><b>the room to be interesting because I was not allowed to play in
the room.</b>
<br><b>There use to be this little wooden kids chair in the room that I
always</b>
<br><b>thought was for me to sit in, but a little porcelain doll sat there
in the</b>
<br><b>chair instead.&nbsp; I never liked the doll (maybe because I was
jealous of it, I</b>
<br><b>don't know).&nbsp; It had this look to it as if it always was looking
at you and</b>
<br><b>seemed a little evil in a suddle way.&nbsp; Anyways, one evening
as my parents</b>
<br><b>and grandmother was sitting out on the back porch drinking coffee
and eating</b>
<br><b>their cake I was inside playing.&nbsp; I had walked by the living
room with the</b>
<br><b>closed door and heard some noise in there.&nbsp; As I recall it
was laughter and</b>
<br><b>then I heard a loud "Stop!"&nbsp; Thinking it was the family in
there talking to</b>
<br><b>me or something I grabbed for the door knob to enter the room.&nbsp;
The door was</b>
<br><b>locked and I heard laughter from in the room again.&nbsp; I don’t
think I said</b>
<br><b>anything by this point, but what I will never for get was...&nbsp;
The floor was</b>
<br><b>hard wood and there was a crack from the floor to the bottom of
the door, I</b>
<br><b>bent down to try and look into the room from the crack and see what
was</b>
<br><b>going on.&nbsp; As I looked I noticed myself looking dead in the
eyes of the doll</b>
<br><b>that sat in the room looking dead back at me an inch away from my
face, but</b>
<br><b>the door being in between.&nbsp; I screamed bloody murder, must
have scared my</b>
<br><b>family half to death.&nbsp; I remember them coming or me meeting
them half way in</b>
<br><b>the house asking me what's wrong.&nbsp; They seemed worried because
I must have</b>
<br><b>looked like a zombie and could hardly even talk.&nbsp; I finally
told them and my</b>
<br><b>grandmother had walked back to the living room and opened the door
just fine</b>
<br><b>and said nothing was wrong, as I looked behind her I saw the doll
just</b>
<br><b>sitting back in the chair, but remembered them glass blue eyes just
moments</b>
<br><b>before, not ever remembering the eyes color before.&nbsp; Anyways
it still creeps</b>
<br><b>me out thinking about this.</b><b></b>

<br><b>St. augustine Bascilica, Florida</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dianeb@asurams.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have visited St. Augustine Florida many times. We always stop by
the</b>
<br><b>large Bascilica in the historic district, pray, light a candle,
and just</b>
<br><b>enjoy the place. At the front of the church, to the left of the
main</b>
<br><b>alter area, is a small "chapel" area--I don't know the proper term
for</b>
<br><b>it since I am not Catholic. While in this small area, I had a very</b>
<br><b>strange experience.&nbsp; I was walking forward toward the actual
alter to</b>
<br><b>pray when I was STOPPED in my tracks at the third pew from the front.
No</b>
<br><b>matter how hard I tried, I could not go forward even though nothing
I</b>
<br><b>could see was holding me back. I also began to feel extremely sad.
For</b>
<br><b>no reason I started to cry. I immediately left the church. On other</b>
<br><b>visits, the feeling has returned and grown. I know that this feeling
of</b>
<br><b>absolute hopelessness is not coming from me--i have never felt that
way</b>
<br><b>myself.</b>
<br><b>During the last visit, I was standing there, crying, when I looked
down</b>
<br><b>and saw a lady on the floor beside me!&nbsp; She was wearing a very
rough</b>
<br><b>dress with no hem, like burlap. She had a pretty blue scarf around
her</b>
<br><b>head and neck--I don't think it belonged to her. Her feet were bare.
She</b>
<br><b>was on her knees with her head down on the floor. Her face was turned
to</b>
<br><b>me. It was dark-skinned and deeply lined. She was crying. She said
over</b>
<br><b>and over "please,please". I wanted to get down on the floor beside
her</b>
<br><b>but other people came in and it ended. I know I only saw her. Even
when</b>
<br><b>I look at a picture of the chapel, I get the most awful, sad feeling.
I</b>
<br><b>am dying to know who she is.</b>

<br><b>Strange Happening at Work</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gerbear902@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I work in a nursing home and this strange thing happened to me about</b>
<br><b>fifteen years ago. I am an R.N. and was the 3-11p,m, supervisor
at the</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; It was snowing outside and myself and a nurse aide were
in a</b>
<br><b>solarium, when we saw someone go by the window.&nbsp; We both thought
that</b>
<br><b>one of our residents had gone outside so we decided to go out and</b>
<br><b>check.&nbsp; When we went outside we saw footprints in the snow
and they</b>
<br><b>suddenly stopped and no one was there.&nbsp; I would have doubted
myself</b>
<br><b>except I had a witness who saw the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have
also experienced</b>
<br><b>lights going off in rooms without the residents ringing and also
our</b>
<br><b>residents describe a man in black being in their rooms.&nbsp; When
the man in</b>
<br><b>black appears we always have a death.&nbsp; There is one particular
wing in</b>
<br><b>the nursing home, where the bathroom doors continually open and

<br><b>the residents can get out of bed, but when we go and check and close
the</b>
<br><b>doors we are only down the hall a little way and we hear the doors</b>
<br><b>opening again and when we go back they are open.&nbsp; I am a believer

<br><b>Starting With Mary</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MERLIN4RAVEN@YAHOO.COM</b><b></b>
<p><b>this is really hard for me as i have had several happenings in my
life.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>first experience was with chicago's famed "RESURECTION MARY".&nbsp;
I was about</b>
<br><b>ten at the time. My dad and I where on our way to a Halloween store
to get</b>
<br><b>somethings mom needed.Dad decided that since we were in the area,
he wanted</b>
<br><b>to see if the story was true.&nbsp; Well, I'm here to tell you Mary
does happen!!</b>
<br><b>We were about a mile from Resurection Cemetary when we first saw
her.&nbsp; "Mary</b>
<br><b>was dressed in a very pretty old fashion gown. Her hair was wet
and in her</b>
<br><b>face.&nbsp; and yes, it just so happened that it was raining out.&nbsp;
What the news</b>
<br><b>called a freak rain storm.&nbsp; Well, dad being dad, stopped and
let her in the</b>
<br><b>car.&nbsp; He asked her where she was going to and "Mary" had said
,&nbsp; "i am to go</b>
<br><b>to The Johnston"s home and met my parents there for the ball.&nbsp;
Thank ye for</b>
<br><b>taking me there."&nbsp; Dad drove on and as we got closer to the
cemetary, we</b>
<br><b>started to smell this god awful smell!&nbsp; As we got to the gates,
she vanashed</b>
<br><b>in to thin air, leaving the car seat wet!&nbsp; For about two months
after that,</b>
<br><b>mom and dad tried to get the smell out of the car.&nbsp; Dad finally
had enough</b>
<br><b>and sold the car.&nbsp; The new owners said that they never smelled
anything in</b>
<br><b>the car be cleaning products!</b>
<br><b>My next encounter happened about five years later.&nbsp; I was in
Hutcheson,</b>
<br><b>Kansas- I was working the fair there-when i saw my Grandmother.&nbsp;
Mind you,</b>
<br><b>gram was suppost to be home in chicago at this time-beridden with
alzhimers.</b>
<br><b>I looked at her and started to cry.&nbsp; I asked her if she came
to say goodbye</b>
<br><b>and she said yes.&nbsp; There were about 8 people standing there
watching all of</b>
<br><b>this-me talking to her, her and i hugging then Gram just fading
and finally</b>
<br><b>disappearing-who where all very scared to death.&nbsp; One woman
actually had a</b>
<br><b>heartattack on the spot.</b>
<br><b>Next came my Grandfather about three years after that.&nbsp; My
husband and I were</b>
<br><b>living in Florida and He in chicago. On April 8th,1990&nbsp; Poppy
came and said</b>
<br><b>goodbye.&nbsp; He told me to give his great granddaughter lots of
lovings for him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Then he vanished.&nbsp; At the time, I wasn't pregnant.&nbsp;
In March of 1992, I</b>
<br><b>found out I was pregnant with a baby girl.</b>
<br><b>Now we're in to&nbsp; 1996.&nbsp; My daughter is three and we are
living in a house.</b>
<br><b>One night, she looks toward a doorway and starts to laugh.&nbsp;
My husband asked</b>
<br><b>her what was so funny and she said,"lady silly daddy!"&nbsp; I asked
her to show</b>
<br><b>me where this lady was and she pointed toward the door way to the
kitchen.</b>
<br><b>Just then, both My husband and I saw what looked to be a grandmother
type</b>
<br><b>woman with a very loving smile on her face.&nbsp; She motioned that
she was</b>
<br><b>watching over us and she loved us.&nbsp; To this day, on my little
girl's</b>
<br><b>birthday's&nbsp; she will show up and help my daughter blow out
the candles, touch</b>
<br><b>her face, then disappear for another year.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Numerous Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sha3@mikmaqmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had allot of dealings with ghosts. As long as I can remember!</b>
<br><b>When I was three my family lived in an old Victorian that had an
In-law apartment we rented to a wonderful elderly woman.</b>
<br><b>My room was on the top floor. On the other side of my wall was her
apartment.</b>
<br><b>I can remember so many mornings getting up and not being able to
open my door. The doorknob just wouldn't turn. There was no lock of any
kind on the door. I remember calmly knocking on the wall for Mrs. Smith
to come and let me out. A few times her comment was " locked you in again
did they? "</b>
<br><b>We later moved into a house that my father built and it started
all over again.</b>
<br><b>Lights would go on and off, footsteps from the basement, gray clouds
in the corner of my bedroom that my dog would jump in front of with every
hair in his back standing on end. Certain friends were afraid to stay in
my room alone. The list goes on and on…………………..</b>
<br><b>My son was born at 7pm I had a really hard labor and was having
a hard time staying conscious so was unable to care for him that night.
All was well the next morning and I was able to keep him with me for the
remainder of our stay. The hardest thing for us was trying to get some
sleep. Whenever he would drift off in his little bassinet I would fall
asleep facing him. We would both jump awake to the sound of a Loud male
voice VERY close to us. THERE WAS NEVER ANYONE IN THE ROOM. I being accustomed
to this didn't think much of it the first few times but, my protective
instinct kicked in and once I put him on my chest to sleep………………the voice
stopped.</b>
<br><b>My son sees and hears things as well. The two instances that come
to mind, 1. last year 3 days after my Great Uncle passed away (my son was
3 at the time) I was sitting at my kitchen when my son came walking in,
looked to the other end of the table then to me and asked me "who the guy
was sitting over there" I asked him what guy and he pointed to the spot
he was previously looking at and said "that one" When I asked him what
the looked like, he looked at me in the typical 3year old DERRRRR Mom fashion
and said " he looks like a dead guy " and walked back out of the room.</b>
<br><b>2. One day getting out of the car in our driveway my son looked
up and asked me if I could also see the white man in the sky!</b>
<br><b>I looked but saw nothing. My son looked very disappointed.</b>
<br><b>If you were interested in reading more about my son or myself I
would be glad to send you more information.</b><b></b>

<br><b>New Zealand Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: j0ey16@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello, my story happened to me when I was 14,and I was living in
New Zealand. I lived in a small town called christchurch.</b>
<br><b>My friend adele had stayed the night and we woke up early so I sugested
we go for&nbsp; a walk around horse shoe lake it was a treak which only
took half an hour&nbsp; to finish&nbsp; the fog was thick and we could
only see&nbsp; about 50 meters a head of us,&nbsp; we had only walked five
minutes into it ,when Adele noticed this huge entrance to what appeared
to be a tunnel it was a big gate covering the entrance and it had a padlock
on it an looked really old. But I had been here just yesterday and it wasn't
there,and also other things were there that had never been there before
there was purple flowers everywhere and dozen of horses, in Christchurch
all horses are privately owned but there was at least 100horses and green
grass. All of this had never been there before&nbsp; I knew this area like
the back of my hand but we seemed to have entered a diffeent dimension
and the fog just vanished&nbsp; and sun was pouring over me.</b>
<br><b>Adele and me just stared at each other not believing what we were
seeing and she started to pet one of the horses, and I felt this extrordionray
sense of peace. When all of a sudden I&nbsp; heard this gaspiing choking
noice I looked around and could see nothing and I could feel the pain this
person was going through, struggling&nbsp; to breath it got louder and
louder this gaspingit sounded like it was in my head. I screamed at Adele
that I could hear someone choking she looked around and could see nothing
either, so we started to run, we ran for a while and I couldn't hear the
gasping anymore, I told Adele and she smiled and said "Jo you can relax
now come on smile, your scaring me. You never last two minutes without
smiling. Come on!" I felt possesed but tryed to smile, and Adele screamed,
she had seen my face change I changed to this boy who's face and body was
rotting and I gave this scary smile , she tells me she still gets dreams
of the face she saw,</b>
<br><b>Four months ago I was thinking about what happened and as I am an
insomniac and now knew how to work the internet I decided to investigate
Horse Shoe Lake, i found old New Zealand newspaper and e mailed contacts
and spoke to libarians and finaly found out what I had seen, it turned
out fifty three years ago an eighteen year old boy had&nbsp; hanged himself
at the lake a week after his girlfriend had died there, I found out her
story and she had drowned by playing in the tunnel (the tunnel I saw)she
had falling and hit her head on the concrete wall as the bottom was covered
in water she drowned the article talked about how parents were complaining
that a padlock wasn't enouth, they needed to tear the storm drain tunnel
down, as there was no need for it anyway. the tunnel was pulled down that
year.&nbsp; I'm 18 now and I have never seen or heard from that ghost again,
but I am always curious if I go back to new zealand and back to horse shoe
lake&nbsp; if i will see my ghost's girlfriend.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Ghost Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lauren033082@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>It was Christmas Day 2000, and I just got done reading the Unexplained</b>
<br><b>mysteries of Florida, and there was this page about a woman named
Maggie</b>
<br><b>Bell.&nbsp; She lived in the town that my father grew up in;&nbsp;
Lake Monroe,</b>
<br><b>Florida.&nbsp; She claimed to be a psychic, and was well known for
her "powers" in</b>
<br><b>the area.&nbsp; She was really good friends with my Great Grandfathers
cousin.</b>
<br><b>Right before she passed in 1922, she promised that she would find
a way to</b>
<br><b>contact her friends and family through a spirit formation.&nbsp;
My father claims</b>
<br><b>that she was the town's crazy woman, and that she was a drunk.&nbsp;
However, her</b>
<br><b>night stand that she used during seances and readings, is claimed
to be</b>
<br><b>possessed by her spirit.&nbsp; After I got done reading the story,
I walked into</b>
<br><b>the kitchen and got a drink of water.&nbsp; I dropped a piece of
ice on the floor,</b>
<br><b>and when I leaned over to pick it up, there were 3 obvious muddy
footprints</b>
<br><b>on the floor.&nbsp; To make matters more interesting, they were
all right</b>
<br><b>footprints, and the shape of a woman's foot.&nbsp; Narrow and long.&nbsp;
Nobody in my</b>
<br><b>house was barefooted.&nbsp; We were all wearing shoes.&nbsp; No
one was even in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen before me, we were all talking about family issues like
we always do</b>
<br><b>on Christmas.&nbsp; I had just mopped the floor like 3 hours before
this happened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I can't explain how they got there, nor could anyone else.&nbsp;
I just find it</b>
<br><b>very intersting that I had just gotten done reading the story about
Maggie</b>
<br><b>Bell, when it happened.&nbsp; My dad claims that it was just somebody's
footprints</b>
<br><b>that had on wet socks.&nbsp; But no one in the house had only socks
on.&nbsp; We ALL</b>
<br><b>had our shoes on.&nbsp; My dad then wiped up the footprints with
a paper towel and</b>
<br><b>threw them away.&nbsp; When i got it out to investigate further,
there was no dirt</b>
<br><b>on the towel.&nbsp; "Someone must have been playing a joke"&nbsp;
my dad said, but i</b>
<br><b>know that Maggie Bell was present in my house.&nbsp; I have always
had "psychic"</b>
<br><b>abilities.&nbsp; I can sense presences all the time, and everyone
thinks that i am</b>
<br><b>looney.&nbsp; I know that this time I am right.&nbsp; Those footprints
and the story of</b>
<br><b>how Mrs. Bell was a close friend to my family are too real for me
to</b>
<br><b>overlook.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp; My First Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: moses.rivera@verizon.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Elliot Bonilla i am 19 years old,and i live in NEW
YORK CITY.. im bout to tell you of acouple of my experience`s with these
things i like to call creatures..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One cold winter night i was about 15 years old,
and i was with my uncle about to shovel snow that was placed there the
night before by a snow storm. Me and my uncle were joking around and laughing
you know just having a great time,when all of a sudden&nbsp; we heard some
noises coming from behind us ,they sounded like footsteps, i looked at
my uncle and in his eyes i saw FEAR..i mean i had never ever seen him like
that ever...my uncle had his eyes on whatever it was all i know is that
it was behind me, i was too scared to look back but i looked anyway...
thats when i saw it. I was looking directly at it. I was so scared that
my hairs on my arms stood up (no joke), anyway to describe what i saw..i
saw a small figure walking toward me it seemed to be alittle kid but i
really couldnt tell cause it looked&nbsp; transparent and misty. this figure
got closer and closer until it walked directly into the parrallel wall
next to me. at first i thought that i was dreaming but i looked down and
i saw small footsteps in the snow that lead to the wall....by now i had
gotten my composure and i turned around to look at my uncle but...(laugh)..he
was gone i mean that man just completely left me.&nbsp; Anyhow three days
later i was sitting in the room with my uncle again yes the same man that
left me, but anyway we decided to play with the OUJA board like we always
do.. but only this time we were calling out to the spirit we had seen in
the backyard that night..to our surprise we had contacted a spirit and
this spirit was trying to tell us something.. we asked it a number of questions
but all the spirit would spell out was ROOF &amp; his name which was Daniel.
Finally we asked Daniel what do you mean by roof and he replied Fell off..
i immediately looked at my uncle... he must have fallen off the roof and
fell into our yard where he now haunts... then the spirit decided to spell
out good bye and left us.</b>

<br><b>Screaming</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: babyjuve@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My story is not of a haunting. I remember it real
well and even my mom remembers when i came screaming into her bed room.
when i was about 5, i was watching my favorite tv show one night when the
screen went snowy, like the tv is when it is plugged in but not hooked
up to anything then this face with horns came up the screen. i might of
been young but i knew what i was seening and it didnt take long to figure
it out. i dont really know if satan really exist or why he showed him self
to me. I didnt care though i was scared. i never watched that show after.
since then i heard that one of my teachers cousin, over 1,000 miles, had&nbsp;
seen the same thing i did.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Experience with "Ghosts"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: M_Leal@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to share a small portion of my experience, specifically
regarding my grandmother's house in Gardena, Ca.</b>
<br><b>It was about&nbsp; 100yrs old, 2600 sq. feet, detached car garage,
12 rooms, huge walk-in closets and crawl spaces.&nbsp; You would never
guess the age of the house by looking at it. My grandparents took great
pride in their home and it was immaculate. As far as we know the house
was previously used as a doctor's office in Beverly Hills and was later
moved to the location it stands now. Considering the age of the house and
the era in which it was used, imagine the practices that may have been
endured or the deaths that may have occurred in the very rooms we played
Twister or ate dinner in.</b>
<br><b>My grandma owned the home for roughly thirty years of it's existence
and we had several generations of our family stay and grow up in that house.&nbsp;
All of which are privy to the paranormal activity.&nbsp; Most of us are
grown now, and to offer any clue as to how traumatic these experiences
were, as adults we do not mention much about the house (grown men included)
even though it was a monumental part of our childhood.</b>
<br><b>We had the classic typical lights turning off and on, doors not
letting people out of rooms, curtains moving without drafts, clothes being
hurled out of dressers,shadows, feelings of being watched, noises, whispering,
scalding hot water out of pipes, babies talking to people who were not
there, dogs and cats barking and hissing up at the air above them.&nbsp;
In addition to the above, we had baby dolls that would open and close their
eye lids, running noises coming from inside the closets, and too many numerous,
but not insignificant other happenings.&nbsp; Only one incident though
where someone actually was injured.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart of the activity was upstairs.&nbsp; It was
very cold all of the time. We are talking short wearing weather outside
and blankets inside (upstairs mostly). After a particular incident towards
the end, my aunt finally called a priest out to the house in the early
1990's.&nbsp; They walked throught the house, sprinkling holy water and
praying just as you would see on television.&nbsp; Of course this did not
work, and needless to say the two priests would not come back.&nbsp; They
said and I quote "there is too much evil".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, we stopped going upstairs (around this
time my grandfather passed away) and the house was sold.&nbsp; There are
no words to explain the feeling of knowing you are not alone, the shortness
of breath, the hair standing on end, the defiance towards whatever it is
you want out of your space and visa versa. Over the course of my life I
have shared space with many other spirits, energies, etc. neither of us
threatened by the other entity.&nbsp; However, my grandma's house was filled
with many unhappy and vengeful spirits not wanting to co-habitate with
the living world.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, I e-mailed regarding a photograph
taken in front of my grandma's house.&nbsp; It was a fair weathered day
and we were all going to Disneyland.&nbsp; Myself and two other family
members were standing on the porch when the photo was taken. I was 14 at
the time. The roll was developed and the pictures came out great, and we
placed them in an album.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years later when I was in my early twenties and
memories of my grandma's house were pushed to the back of my mind and long
gone, I had a dream of the photograph.&nbsp; I dreamt that in addition
to those of us standing on the porch there was something watching us in
the upstairs window.&nbsp; I was very disturbed about my dream, and I discussed
it with my mom.&nbsp; She advised me to dig out the old photo to set my
mind at ease.&nbsp; I rummaged for the picture, and to my horror there
was indeed a mass of dark shadow in the middle of the upstairs window.&nbsp;
No recognizable features other than two hollow eyes and two hands with
five fingers each pressed up against the window. Unmistakably, a once human
presence so dark and powerfully evil emanating from the heart of the home.&nbsp;
At the time, I feared it had channeled through to me during my dreamstate
as a way to remind me of it's presence.&nbsp; I find this theory terribly
unsettling, and I hope untrue.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, I no longer have the photograph.&nbsp;
My mom put it away (out of sight, out of mind), and has since misplaced
it.&nbsp; I regret that the picture cannot be found because that was my
own personal validation to all of the years of intimidation and fear.&nbsp;
I just know that I will stumble across it one day, maybe when moving, and
I will be caught off guard by a picture reminding me of a haunted past...</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Encounters</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Mistemptress67@excite.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I thought I would share with you experiences I have had.It feels
good to</b>
<br><b>know others have gone through similiar experiences.=)</b>
<br><b>I have had a few encounters in the house where I grew up.The house
isn't</b>
<br><b>very big, three bedrooms,two lower, and mine, was the upstairs.At
first I</b>
<br><b>thought maybe it was a longing for those that I loved, that had
passed</b>
<br><b>away,but found out later I wasn't the only one in the house that
had these</b>
<br><b>encounters.First encounter was from my grandmother.She had 11 children,my</b>
<br><b>mother,being the eldest.My mom was the one one who mainly did the
most for</b>
<br><b>grandma. She was the only grandparent I knew,as the rest had passed
before I</b>
<br><b>was adopted. Out of all the grandchildren,(and there were alot)my
brother</b>
<br><b>and I were her secret favorites.We would pick her up every Sunday
for</b>
<br><b>church,and afterwards, she would come over for dinner.In 1978,she
had gone</b>
<br><b>with us up north to visit some of her relatives.It turned out,that
the trip</b>
<br><b>would be her last.She was diagnosed with cancer that fall,and died
on</b>
<br><b>Christmas Eve around midnight,I remember the call that came, and
could hear</b>
<br><b>my mother burst into tears, from where I was,in my room upstairs.I
remember</b>
<br><b>it as if it was yesterday.Well,one night after my Grandmother had
been laid</b>
<br><b>to rest,my childhood friend had spent the night.We were up in my</b>
<br><b>room,chattering away and watching t.v.,while laying on my bed.I
remember the</b>
<br><b>door to my room being closed, so that we would not awaken my parents.As
my</b>
<br><b>friend and I were watching t.v.,she and I heard footsteps on the
stairs that</b>
<br><b>led up to my room.My dad had yelled out to me for us to quit goofing
around</b>
<br><b>and get back in bed, as it was around 1 A.M...We were allready in
bed!A few</b>
<br><b>minutes after that,a jewlery box that my Uncle had given me when
I was</b>
<br><b>younger,( I was 11ish at the time of this occurrence)began to play
it's</b>
<br><b>music again, wich it hadn't done for quite some time, as it was
broken.It</b>
<br><b>played as if it was in perfect condition,and the ballarina began
to move.My</b>
<br><b>friend and I started to get scared,because we could not explain
to one</b>
<br><b>another what was going on.After the jewlery box stopped,I saw my
Grandmother</b>
<br><b>standing near the side of my bed,in the beautiful nightgown we had
laid her</b>
<br><b>to rest in, a few feet away from me.I remember not being all that</b>
<br><b>frightened,but my friend was turning pale,very quickly.Grandma spoke
to me,</b>
<br><b>telling me it was ok,not to be sad anymore, that she was ok now,
and that</b>
<br><b>she was happy where she was,and that she loved me and always would.Then
she</b>
<br><b>was gone.We never mentioned it to anyone,till one day, quite a few
years</b>
<br><b>later,my brother's friend and I were sitting on the porch talking,while
he</b>
<br><b>waited for my brother,and I mentioned to him about the night that
I was</b>
<br><b>visited by my grandmother...He then told me, that my brother had
seen her,</b>
<br><b>the same night,and that she had said the same thing to him...I later
asked</b>
<br><b>my brother about it and he had stated that what his friend told
me was</b>
<br><b>true..Needless to say,my friend never spent the night again. That
was my</b>
<br><b>first encounter.&nbsp; My second encounter was my father..Mom and
dad, to me,had</b>
<br><b>the perfect marriage;never argued in front of my brother and I,and
loved one</b>
<br><b>another more than I had ever seen two people capable of.I remember
being in</b>
<br><b>the car with my mom when I was 13,and I had told her about a dream
I had</b>
<br><b>about my dad dieng.She had told me not to be rediculous,that he
was ok</b>
<br><b>now..See,my father had a heart attack a year after my grandmother
passed</b>
<br><b>away,so mom felt it was just my subconscious toying with me in my</b>
<br><b>sleep.Anyhow, he did die,May6,1982 at the age of 49.It was sudden,and
I</b>
<br><b>remember comming home from my babysitting job,and finding the dishes
not</b>
<br><b>cleared from dinner, and my mom and her car, gone.A few minutes
later,the</b>
<br><b>phone rang,it was the hospital telling me I should come there</b>
<br><b>immediately,that my father was sick.I finally found a ride, and
when I got</b>
<br><b>there, I saw our Pastor,with my mom and my dad's brother, and mom
was</b>
<br><b>signing the death papers.When we arrived home that night,mom's family,and</b>
<br><b>dad's family were at the house,consoling us.I remember the phone
ringing,and</b>
<br><b>when I said" Hello"I heard a voice say through alot of static,"I
will always</b>
<br><b>love you,Gloria",wich is my mom's name. With all the confusion going
on that</b>
<br><b>night,I had forgotten to mention the phone call to my mother.A year
later,in</b>
<br><b>September,I found out I was pregnant.I was due,May 24th,1982.Well,
on May</b>
<br><b>6th,1982,mom and I had went to dad's grave site to visit.I started
getting</b>
<br><b>alot of pain in my lower back,and started to feel sick.We left the</b>
<br><b>cemetary,and went home.Around 5 P.M. that night,the pain was more</b>
<br><b>frequent,and mom took me to the hospital.After a long,hard delivery,I
gave</b>
<br><b>birth&nbsp; to a baby boy at 12:01 A.M.I remember them wheeling
me from the</b>
<br><b>delivery room to another room, where I was alone,and I had&nbsp;
had a spinal,so</b>
<br><b>I had to lay still on my back for awhile before being transported
to my</b>
<br><b>room.I was really exhausted,and I was drifting off to sleep,when
I heard</b>
<br><b>someone say my name.I looked around and didn't see anyone,so Iattempted
to</b>
<br><b>go back to sleep, and then,once again, I heard my name.. this time
when I</b>
<br><b>looked, it was my father,at the end of my gurney,he was smiling
at me, and</b>
<br><b>said"Good job".Then he was gone..Four years later,I met a wonderful
man.We</b>
<br><b>decided,after a breif period,to rent a house and move in together.One</b>
<br><b>morning,after awaking,my boyfriend(who is now my hubby)said he had
an odd</b>
<br><b>dream the night before.He said that he don't normally remember dreams,as
he</b>
<br><b>is a deep sleeper,but this one stood fresh in his mind.He said that
there</b>
<br><b>was a man,about 5'10,dark,short,hair,wearing black framed glasses,and
that</b>
<br><b>the man clearly told him"You better be good to my daughter,and take
good</b>
<br><b>care of her"Now, he had never seen a picture of my father,and when
we went</b>
<br><b>to my mom's later that day,I showed him a picture of my dad, and
he got pale</b>
<br><b>and said that the picture I showed him was indeed the man that visited
him</b>
<br><b>in his dream.When mom heard him say that, she had confessed getting
visit</b>
<br><b>periodically from my father.She says that she see's him clearly,but

<p><b>Latest Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RYDELLSAN@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>We have a spirit in our home and here is a copy of an email I just
sent to my</b>
<br><b>kids about something that happened this evening.&nbsp; Just one
of many things</b>
<br><b>that occur on a fairly regular basis.</b>
<br><b>Wait till you hear this one.&nbsp; Last night, Debbie (my Deb) called
me and we</b>
<br><b>were talking for a while. When we hung up, I talked to John and
we decided to</b>
<br><b>invite her and Joe over to watch the game and for dinner.&nbsp;
Then I discovered</b>
<br><b>that I couldn't find her new phone no.&nbsp; So I emailed her, but
she never went</b>
<br><b>in and got it.&nbsp; Tonite, about an hour ago, she called me and
asked me if I</b>
<br><b>had called her about an hour before. I said no but that I was hoping
she</b>
<br><b>would call me back so I could get her new no.&nbsp; She said Yes
you did.&nbsp; I said</b>
<br><b>no I didn't why?&nbsp; She said the phone rang and she picked it
up and a voice,</b>
<br><b>kind of distant said "Debbie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debbie&nbsp; Oh that's
okay." And then hung up.</b>
<br><b>She said she swore it was my voice but obviously it wasn't because
I didn't</b>
<br><b>have her number.&nbsp; She said she just knew it was me. OOOOOWEEEEOOOO.&nbsp;
Guess</b>
<br><b>Mira wanted her to call me, because she knew I needed the number,
what do you</b>
<br><b>think?</b><b></b>

<br><b>It Went Through Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:gderango@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I used to live in a duplex that my parents owned.&nbsp; My father
grew-up in that house and his mother lived there till she passed away.
(Not in the house.)</b>
<br><b>The entire time that I lived there I had weird unexplainable things
happen to me.&nbsp; My roommates had a few experiences also, but not as
many as I had.</b>
<br><b>The incident that I want to share with you was the last one I had
there before I moved out.&nbsp; I was sleeping in my room and for no reason
woke in the middle of the night.&nbsp; When my eyes adjusted I realized
that there was a white mist/smoke in front of me.&nbsp; Light, though,
because I could see through it.&nbsp; Then, all of a sudden, it started
to come towards me and went right into/through me!&nbsp; I stopped breathing!&nbsp;
(I didn't stop breathing out of fear because it happened so fast I was
still trying to figure out what I was looking at.)&nbsp; It lasted long
enough for me to think..."Oh my god....I'm going to die."&nbsp; Then it
was gone.&nbsp; I remember being very calm about it...even though a second
ago I thought I was going to die.&nbsp; I just rolled over and went back
to sleep.&nbsp; That was the last event that happened in that house to
me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunting in My Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SLRnFamily@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My husband &amp; I purchased our house on December 17, 1997. We fell
in love with</b>
<br><b>the small old house, the previous owner passed away and the estate
sold the</b>
<br><b>house. It still had lots of belongings left in the house, a family
photo of a</b>
<br><b>Veteran soldier and his wife and two kids. (approximately a 1950's
- 60's</b>
<br><b>photo) furniture, health care items, the owner maybe an invalid.&nbsp;
We were</b>
<br><b>told the man died of a heart attack on the way to the hospital,
later we</b>
<br><b>learned they pronounced him dead on the way to the hospital but
most likely</b>
<br><b>died in the room. a few weeks after we moved in my son was born,
we had</b>
<br><b>experiences with his toys being moved, his toys without batteries
in them</b>
<br><b>would work!, his rocking chair would move and our dogs would always
stay out</b>
<br><b>of two rooms in the house or they would bark.</b>
<br><b>We passed these off as mere quirks and let them go. We had minor
situations</b>
<br><b>throughout the years. But this past summer my son was playing in
our back</b>
<br><b>yard and always talking to himself, not playing byt talking, carrying
on a</b>
<br><b>conversation. When we asked who he was talking to, he said his friend.
He</b>
<br><b>described this person, he actually described the gentleman Mr. Wing
who</b>
<br><b>previously owned the house and that we saw in the photo. Sometimes
when we</b>
<br><b>ask him what he says, he tells me not to ask him anymore or smiles
like he</b>
<br><b>knows something. He just turned 3 after Xmas and during Xmas he
was talking</b>
<br><b>more to him,saying that his friend is crying all the time, he is
sad he is</b>
<br><b>not with his family, etc. We don't want to be scared but really
want to help</b>
<br><b>this soul. My son can tell me things or repeat words that he hears
him say</b>
<br><b>that he doesn't even know about or ever heard,; military words.
It is strange.</b>
<br><b>We thought that since the holidays were over the ghost would just
stop like</b>
<br><b>he did before, (it seems that in december he is the most active,
the month he</b>
<br><b>died or the holidays?) Well last night my son said "the soldier
man" is in</b>
<br><b>our attic. He is just sitting there. We don't know what to do, but
we don't</b>
<br><b>want to say too much to my son. Sometimes when he sees me worried,
he says</b>
<br><b>that the soldier says it is alright and not to be scared. I am though.
I am</b>
<br><b>not afraid of him, just sad for him</b><b></b>

<br><b>Great Hurry</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jessiebeirau@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>About five years ago, on a particularly unspectacular night, I believe
it was a Wednesday, I encountered a real ghost.&nbsp; I always believed
in them, but I was never sure they existed.&nbsp; The moon was bright,
it was nearly full.&nbsp; My boyfriend and I were sitting on beneath the
largest tree in the yard of the Kendrick mansion.&nbsp; The mansion is
located in a small&nbsp; town of Sheridan, Wyoming.&nbsp; I can not recall
the history of the grounds or other ghostly stories, for which I was not
aware of at the time, but I do remember the man we saw?&nbsp; As I said
the moon was very bright. Jeremiah, my boyfriend said to me "Shhh. I think
we have company."&nbsp; I looked and saw nothing.&nbsp; Then at a second
glance I saw a man, I thought.&nbsp; He looked very strange.&nbsp; From
his position on the road, several yards away, he should have been a silhouette.&nbsp;
However, he seemed to glow, though not brightly.&nbsp; Then he was gone.&nbsp;
There were no trees or shrubs to obstruct our view.&nbsp; He simply had
vanished.&nbsp; Then a way up the road he appeared again.&nbsp; He was
closer now, and at even a glance it was easy to see that his knees did
not bend as he walked.&nbsp; We were both becoming very uneasy.&nbsp; Then
the spirit came to a juncture in the road. The juncture formed a triangle,
with grass in the middle.&nbsp; He completed the triangle three times and
began to head straight for us!&nbsp; We scrambled to break away.&nbsp;
Both of us were very cold, very frightened, this person was nearing and
we couldn't hardly move.&nbsp; I remember trying very hard to see through
the trees, the man a she approached but my sight became jumbled as I struggled
to get away.&nbsp; Finally we were up and running to my Bronco. When I
looked back there was no one there-of coarse.&nbsp; I went back a few times
but I never saw him again.&nbsp; I don't know who he was, only that he
seemed to be in a great hurry to go nowhere.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Grandpa in Connecticut</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: davemyers@post.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1994, I was in Woodstock Connecticut for a family reunion at my</b>
<br><b>grandmothers farm.&nbsp; My grandfather died when I was 6, and I
have very little</b>
<br><b>memory of him.&nbsp; My Aunt and Uncle live down a hill, past the
old farm house.</b>
<br><b>Where I was staying was 100 yards from the old farm house at the
top of the</b>
<br><b>hill.&nbsp; You can not walk to my Aunt and Uncle's place with out
passing by the</b>
<br><b>old farm house.&nbsp; I was 18 at the time.</b>
<br><b>On an afternoon when I was walking up the hill from my Aunt &amp;
Uncle's house,</b>
<br><b>I felt this strange sensation as if I was being watched.&nbsp; On
the fly I</b>
<br><b>intimately looked up to the old farm house to the second story window,
the</b>
<br><b>window to my Grandparents old bedroom.&nbsp; I saw something in
the window,</b>
<br><b>something fuzzy.&nbsp; Within a moment of looking at the window,
I felt a surge</b>
<br><b>in my chest.&nbsp; The best way to describe it would be to say if
felt as if</b>
<br><b>someone had thrown a rope around my heart and was pulling part of
me out.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>pounded my fist on my heart 2 times and ran back to where I was
staying.</b>
<br><b>After the incident I was completely exhausted.&nbsp; I went to bed
at about 8:00</b>
<br><b>that night, when normally I'd be up til midnight.&nbsp; I was trying
to sleeping</b>
<br><b>on the floor of the living room, while my Mom was on the couch reading
to</b>
<br><b>the light of a lamp.&nbsp; As I was starting to close my eyes, the
lamp my Mom</b>
<br><b>was reading by flickered.&nbsp; Mom immidiately said "just a power
surge.."&nbsp; in a</b>
<br><b>quick yet weary voice that let me know she was unwilling to accept
what may</b>
<br><b>have just happened. I closed my eyes tight and cranked the volume
on my disc</b>
<br><b>man.</b>
<br><b>Interestingly enough, I was listening to SEAL's first album.&nbsp;
As I was</b>
<br><b>falling asleep to the disc, a particular section of a song became
louder in</b>
<br><b>my ears.&nbsp; It went "there is no other love, no other love like
her's....There</b>
<br><b>is no Love.."&nbsp; It became obvious to me that my Grandfather
was waiting for</b>
<br><b>my Grandmother.</b>
<br><b>I was pretty spooked out in the morning.&nbsp; The next day I ran
down to my Aunt</b>
<br><b>and Uncle's house and mentioned what had transpired too my Aunt.&nbsp;
Her eyes</b>
<br><b>widened and we talked for about 2 hours about what happens at the
old farm</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Doors creek when they are all jammed open by bricks.&nbsp;
Visitors ask</b>
<br><b>who the old man is up in the window in the dark.&nbsp; A friend
of my Aunt has a</b>
<br><b>6 year old son that has conversations with "the nice old man" at
the</b>
<br><b>farmhouse.&nbsp; My Grandma hear's my Grandpa calling her name over
and over</b>
<br><b>again when ever she is in the house.&nbsp; I did not and have still
not shared my</b>
<br><b>experience with my Mom.&nbsp; She would be the type of person to
completely</b>
<br><b>disregard it.</b>
<br><b>Before I left the reunion, I went into the farm house with my Mom
to look</b>
<br><b>around.&nbsp; In the bedroom, there was a chair placed directly
in the spot where</b>
<br><b>I felt/saw the fuzzy entity.&nbsp; I felt no agression, but for
some reason I was</b>
<br><b>very frightened of the entire situation.&nbsp; Maybe because I look
EXACTLY like</b>
<br><b>my Grandpa did when he was my age.&nbsp; I haven't been back to
Connecticut</b>
<br><b>since.</b>
<br><b>Since that time, my Grandmother has passed on.&nbsp; I will go back
someday and</b>
<br><b>see if my Grandfather has found peace yet.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Trailor #1</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KDML7777@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Shortly after marrying my 1st husband we moved into a trailor park.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>rented trailor #1.&nbsp; We were young and at the time a trailor
was all we could</b>
<br><b>afford.&nbsp; He worked night shift at an industrial plant while
I was at home</b>
<br><b>alone most nights.&nbsp; One Sunday morning I awoke, went and ate
a bowl of</b>
<br><b>cereal, and layed back down in bed.&nbsp; From my bedroom I could
see straight</b>
<br><b>down the long skinny hall with the back door right outside of my
bedroom.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>noticed the door knob move a little on the back door(I have chills
right now</b>
<br><b>typing this - by the way this was 15 years ago).&nbsp; I got up
and stared at it</b>
<br><b>and it really took off shaking then the back door was being snatched
in and</b>
<br><b>out then the whole side panel wall of the entire trailor began to
suck in</b>
<br><b>toward the trailor and back out away from the trailor.&nbsp; Scared
the sh! it out</b>
<br><b>of me nearly.&nbsp; I went to hollering at it to stop,&nbsp; I thought
it was somebody</b>
<br><b>trying to break in then the trailor window began opening and closing
and I</b>
<br><b>pointed my unloaded shot gun out of the window and told them I would
blow</b>
<br><b>their brains out if they didnt stop,&nbsp; then it stopped.&nbsp;
I halled butt out of</b>
<br><b>the trailor running like crazy.&nbsp; The first car that came thru
I stopped and</b>
<br><b>told them somebody was trying to break into my home I could I catch
a ride</b>
<br><b>with them to their trailor to call the police.&nbsp; Well, I did
and called my</b>
<br><b>parents.&nbsp; My Dad drilled the windows shut on my&nbsp; bedroom.&nbsp;
Well that was all</b>
<br><b>just the begining.&nbsp; One night my husband then told me to turn
off the TV and</b>
<br><b>I did.&nbsp; I got back to the bedroom and the tv cut back on.&nbsp;
My husband was in</b>
<br><b>the BR with me.&nbsp; I went back into LR and it was back on,&nbsp;
I hit the off</b>
<br><b>switch again and it cut off and imm! ediately cut back on the I
pulled the plug</b>
<br><b>out of the wall and the TV continued to play.&nbsp; I thought I
would die!&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>turned around and saw my keys being thrown across the room and land
on the</b>
<br><b>floor(my husband was still in the BR).&nbsp; I told him and didnt
really believe</b>
<br><b>me because he didnt see it all.&nbsp; Finally one morning when he
was at home we</b>
<br><b>were eating breakfast and the "thing"&nbsp; began with the back
door knob again</b>
<br><b>and then the entire back panel wall of the trailor again.&nbsp;
After it showed</b>
<br><b>its affects to my husband our nights turned into pure hell!&nbsp;
We heard every</b>
<br><b>night and mans footsteps walk down the hall and if we left the BR
door open</b>
<br><b>it would walk around to the end of our bed and stand there.&nbsp;
If we kept the</b>
<br><b>door shut it would stop at the door and stand there and pace up
and down the</b>
<br><b>hall.&nbsp; Also at night you could hear noises down the hall in
the kitchen going</b>
<br><b>through silver ware dr! awers,&nbsp; dishes rattling, things moving.&nbsp;
It got so bad</b>
<br><b>until we had to finally guard the bathroom door when we took a shower
or the</b>
<br><b>door would get shooken and feet would pace - daytime too.&nbsp;
One morning I</b>
<br><b>drove over to his Grandparents house early to pick up something
and on the</b>
<br><b>way back home on 12/27/85 had a terrible almost tragic car accident.</b>
<br><b>Something ran me off the road(I froze and could not control the
truck) ran</b>
<br><b>into a field,&nbsp; jumped a stream, cut down a tree and hit a tree
airborn.</b>
<br><b>Broke both legs, left arm,&nbsp; almost broke my hip,&nbsp; broke
the key off into my</b>
<br><b>knee and my head went thru the windshield and back in.&nbsp; A tree
was sitting</b>
<br><b>inside the cab next to me where I could have easily decapitated
myself had I</b>
<br><b>leaned right a little.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; I was in the hospital
for about a week and</b>
<br><b>was released and confined to a wheelchair for about a month then
to crutches.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Wh! ile in the hospital one night,&nbsp; my husband stayed
at the trailor by</b>
<br><b>himself and came busting in my hospital room in the middle of the
night.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>was so scared - he said that the "thing" shook the entire trailor,&nbsp;
all the</b>
<br><b>windows were frantically opening and closing and everything in the
trailor</b>
<br><b>almost was moving and being shaken.&nbsp; Once I came home from
the hospital to</b>
<br><b>the trailor I was sitting in my wheelchair next to the front door
while</b>
<br><b>husband went to get a few things from the BR.&nbsp; Never before
had the front</b>
<br><b>door ever shook,&nbsp; and I be dog if the front door didnt start
shaking and</b>
<br><b>going off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout all of this we told family,&nbsp;
friends, and police and</b>
<br><b>nobody believed us.&nbsp; My parents thought we were on drugs, the
neighbors</b>
<br><b>thought we were crazy because we would both run out of the trailor
with the</b>
<br><b>shotgun looking around the trailor and under trailor trying to find
out who</b>
<br><b>wa! s doing all this.&nbsp; The police never found trace of any
foot prints(backyard</b>
<br><b>was dirt) and neither did we.&nbsp; I would look out the back bedroom
window where</b>
<br><b>I could see the back porch and while the door would shake there
was never</b>
<br><b>anyone visibly there.&nbsp; FOR 15 YEARS I HAVE CARRIED THIS AROUND
IN ME AND NOBODY REALLY BELIEVES ME .</b><b></b>

<br><b>Feel The Voice</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MELASARG@southernco.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have written one story of a friend of mine tonight but being that
I am</b>
<br><b>really bored and these stories are really jogging my memory about
paranormal</b>
<br><b>happenings I have heard from friends, I am going to write about
another one</b>
<br><b>I have heard.&nbsp; This story was first told to me from a very
good friend of</b>
<br><b>mine named Robbie.&nbsp; One night when we were sitting around at
a kind of</b>
<br><b>social gathering with friends Robbie started telling this story
that his</b>
<br><b>sister had told him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sister Sharon and her friend Jenny were going
shopping one day and</b>
<br><b>Jenny said that when she was younger she lived in the area and wanted
to go</b>
<br><b>see her old house.&nbsp; When they finally got there, they knocked
on the door</b>
<br><b>and the new owner said they could come in and take a look.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a footnote, supposedly Jenny's father had
killed her mother and</b>
<br><b>then himself when she was an infant in this house when she was a
toddler but</b>
<br><b>I have no idea if this is the truth or not due to me not knowing
her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, so they started to walk around the house
and when they got to</b>
<br><b>the garage Jenny noticed that there was a chalk board nailed to
ceiling with</b>
<br><b>her name scribbled on it.&nbsp; The current owner said that her
and her husband</b>
<br><b>never really thought of taking it down because it never occured
to them.</b>
<br><b>They ended up sitting in the living room and having a cold drink
with the</b>
<br><b>lady before they left.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current owner had an infant at the time and
had on the baby moniter</b>
<br><b>in the room where they were sitting.&nbsp; All of a sudden, they
started hearing</b>
<br><b>the voice of a woman saying, "It's okay Jenny, it's okay...".&nbsp;
At this time</b>
<br><b>Jenny started freaking out and was like, "Who the hell is saying
that?&nbsp; What</b>
<br><b>the hell!!! is going on?".&nbsp; The current owner and Jenny and
Sharon ran into</b>
<br><b>the babies room to see who was in there but there was no one.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is about where the story ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like I said, I had never even met</b>
<br><b>this girl, and wasn't present when it happened, but it still freaked
me out</b>
<br><b>when I heard it.&nbsp; According to Robbie's sister, the story is
true.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>asked her about it she said that it was a horrible experience and
that you</b>
<br><b>could not only hear the voice but FEEL the voice.&nbsp; Anywho,
thanks for</b>

<br><b>Button Present</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: brunet_honey@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>It was new years eve and i was sleeping round my friends boyfriends
house.</b>
<br><b>His house is 600 years old and in the war it was used as a hospital.
He said</b>
<br><b>it was haunted and that things go missing and turn up later. He
also said</b>
<br><b>that it once opened his bedroom door whilst he was about to go to
sleep.</b>
<br><b>This really freaked me out but I managed to sleep in the room anyway.
As i</b>
<br><b>was about to get into bed I noticed a big green button on the floor
but</b>
<br><b>jumped into bed anyway. I was laying in the bed with my boyfriend
who was</b>
<br><b>half asleep when I heard a rustling noise comeing from my bag. It
sounded as</b>
<br><b>though some one was going through my bag! However there was nothing
there so</b>
<br><b>i rolled over and went back to sleep. When I got back the next morning
I was</b>
<br><b>emptying my bag when I noticed the green button was in the bottom
of my bag</b>
<br><b>and under all my clothes! This freaked me out so i chucked it out
the</b>
<br><b>bathroom window with a powerful force. The following day i was speaking
to</b>
<br><b>my dad about what happened, and he said that I should never throw
away a</b>
<br><b>gift from a ghost! because it is trying to tell me something!! so
he thinks!</b>
<br><b>I then went outside to see if it was still on the road but it was
actually</b>
<br><b>on the window seal of my bathroom. However I throw this with some
force! I</b>
<br><b>still now have the button as I was told to keep it, but why did
this happen?</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Army Barracks</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jerridl@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a Sgt. in the Army and I have what I think is an interesting
story</b>
<br><b>about the barracks that I stayed in in Baumholder, Germany. The
Building # is</b>
<br><b>2303 and it used to belong to Aco. 4/12 Infantry. Ok here goes,
the barracks</b>
<br><b>was a 3 story building with a basement which use to house a German
horse</b>
<br><b>drawn artillery unit back in the days of that sort of warfare. The
hallways</b>
<br><b>were about 9 ft. wide and were pretty bare except for a coke machine
and a</b>
<br><b>desk for the CQ on duty. The floors were always kept at with a high
shine to</b>
<br><b>them for inspection purposes and if anybody walked on them after
they had</b>
<br><b>been buffed you would know from the scuffs lest fron the paste wax
that we</b>
<br><b>used. Well, after hours when everybody was winding down after the
daily</b>
<br><b>duties we would usually relax in our room during the week and that
is when</b>
<br><b>the knocking started. We would be in our rooms watching tv and a
knock would</b>
<br><b>come at our door. My roomate or I would get up to see who it was
and there</b>
<br><b>wouldn't be anybody there.As soon as we sat down the knock would
come again</b>
<br><b>and the whole game would start over with the getting up and such.
Well after</b>
<br><b>several weeks we were getting pretty tired of what we thought were
other</b>
<br><b>soldiers playing around so after some verbal threats and some vulgar
language</b>
<br><b>we thought that it would stop but it didn't. So we tried to set
a trap for</b>
<br><b>the pranking grunt who by our account was going to catch a beat
down as soon</b>
<br><b>as he was caught. My roomy and I would wait by the door ready to
pounce on</b>
<br><b>the knucklehead who wouldn't leave us alone. Well we waited and
then it</b>
<br><b>happened again so we opened the door ready to tear that guy a new
one if you</b>
<br><b>know what I mean and there was know one there. The closest door
was about</b>
<br><b>twenty ft. away and he couldn't have made it back to a room in that
amount of</b>
<br><b>time. It happened several more times that night and everytime we'd
spring the</b>
<br><b>door open and nothing. My roomy said that if anybody had been walking
that we</b>
<br><b>would have heard him because of the way that sound travels down
the open hall</b>
<br><b>and strangly there were no scuff marks on the floor. We thought
about the</b>
<br><b>person wearing socks and we tried to duplicate how a person could
do the</b>
<br><b>"knock and run" prank but we couldn't do it in the time that was
needed to</b>
<br><b>make it from our room to the closest door. Finally we started to
ask other</b>
<br><b>soldies if they had this sort of thing happen to them and they said
that it</b>
<br><b>had been going on for years and everybody was numb to it by now.
So we set up</b>
<br><b>a listening party to catch the person doing this and after a few
beers it</b>
<br><b>started to happen to a room down the hall. We never found out what
it was but</b>
<br><b>as far as I know it is still happening since I've been gone and
that was 1998.</b>
<br><b>Also, I cannot confirm this but my 3rd roomate woke us up one night
by</b>
<br><b>screaming at the top of his lungs about a floating girl looking
at him. He</b>
<br><b>said that a little girl wearing an old "little house on the praire"
dress,</b>
<br><b>and blond curly hair was standing beside his bed and just looking
at him. He</b>
<br><b>was really shaken up and that is a hard thing to do because we a
grunts and</b>
<br><b>we always act tough you know. A couple of night later a soldier
in the room</b>
<br><b>next to ours said that he saw the same thing and he moved out of
the barracks</b>
<br><b>the next night. Like I said I cannot confirm the "little girl" story
but I</b>
<br><b>can attest to the truth about the knocking at our door for the 3
yrs. that I</b>
<br><b>was there. I will say in closing that when the guys that lived in
the off</b>
<br><b>post housing came in with their dogs they didn't like being in there
and</b>
<br><b>always seemed aggrivated and unsettled until they were outside again.
I hope</b>
<br><b>that I didn't bore who ever reads this but it is true. Thank you</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;A ghost Dog?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: taken_leave_me_alone@email.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I just wanted to tell u a story (real life) and wanted ur opinion.
Well,</b>
<br><b>it was just another one of them regular summer days, and I was just</b>
<br><b>rollerblading down our street.&nbsp; One of our neighbor had a small
white dog,</b>
<br><b>think it's a Chiwawa or however u spell it, it's like a really small
dog,</b>
<br><b>bout 10 inches tall, maybe more, well, I was rollerblading and then
I saw</b>
<br><b>this dog, and it was all dirty, and well, I reconized it as the
nieghbor's</b>
<br><b>white dog, so then I called out to it and it looked at me and then
trotted</b>
<br><b>to the yard, so i followed and then around the corner I saw it slip
into the</b>
<br><b>yard through the yard gate, and the yard was a one way in and out
so I went</b>
<br><b>in and I couldn't find the dog so I asked the neighbor incase the
dog went</b>
<br><b>inside from the dog door, so when I ask, he told me to quit fooling
around</b>
<br><b>and that the dog had died after being hit by the car in the same
street I</b>
<br><b>first saw the dog that day, ever since then I never saw the dog
again...</b><b></b>

<br><b>Bottle Up / Bottle Down</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BruceIsLoose@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>When&nbsp; I was around 16 years old I had a very unusual experience
which</b>
<br><b>involved one of many small liquor bottles ( the type that you are
given</b>
<br><b>by the airlines) that I had arraigned in a pattern on the TV set
in my</b>
<br><b>bedroom.</b>
<br><b>One morning, as I climbed from bed,&nbsp; I noticed that the bottle
on the</b>
<br><b>far right hand side was standing upside down. I thought nothing
of it,</b>
<br><b>until the same thing happened time and time again.</b>
<br><b>My first thought was that my older sister was doing it just&nbsp;
to screw</b>
<br><b>with me...... then I thought that it must've been a friend. But,
after</b>
<br><b>much discussion with family&nbsp; and friends we&nbsp; came to realize
that there</b>
<br><b>was a spirit moving the bottle night after night.</b>
<br><b>Each night I would look at the upright bottle before falling asleep
and</b>
<br><b>each morning the bottle would be turned upside down. My family were
all</b>
<br><b>worried, trying to figure out why this was happening.&nbsp; We began
to</b>
<br><b>discuss other strange things that had happened in the past, things
that</b>
<br><b>we hadn't given notice to before. Things left in a certain spot,
not to</b>
<br><b>be found, then re-appearing there again later or in&nbsp; a totally
off the</b>
<br><b>wall place. I would check the bottle every morning, at night and
every</b>
<br><b>time I left the room. I really wasn't afraid of what was happening,
I</b>
<br><b>figured that it was all pretty harmless, but I guess that I just
wanted</b>
<br><b>to be sure of what was really going on..... that someone wasn't
just</b>
<br><b>screwing with me.</b>
<br><b>My proof came one evening after my parents had come into my bedroom
to</b>
<br><b>tell me and a couple of my friends that they were leaving for the</b>
<br><b>evening. Shortly after, my friends and I left. The last thing that
I did</b>
<br><b>when leaving my bedroom was to check the bottle........ it was right</b>
<br><b>side up.</b>
<br><b>My friends and I piled into the car and split. No more than a block
and</b>
<br><b>a half away I realized that I had left my wallet on my desk and
asked to</b>
<br><b>return home to retrieve it. I quickly ran into our house and grabbed
my</b>
<br><b>wallet, as I turned to leave I thought to look back to the bottle......</b>
<br><b>UPSIDE DOWN!!!!!</b>
<br><b>I finally had my proof!!!!</b>
<br><b>After that, the bottle never again turned upside down, I guess that
the</b>
<br><b>spirit had proven it's presence.</b><b></b>

<br><b>In the 70's</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dapollard@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a teenager back in the 70's, I was
up in my bedroom doing my history homework.&nbsp; For some unexplainable
reason the radio on my stereo just started to play some 30's or 40's music,
like Glen Miller music.&nbsp; This was very strange since the system was
turned off.&nbsp; So I got up from my bed where I was reading and turn
the radio off.&nbsp; No sooner than I get back on my bed the radio turns
back on and plays the same music.&nbsp; I got up again and unplugged the
system from the wall and went back to my studies.&nbsp; The radio turned
back on playing the same music even thought it was unplugged from the electric.&nbsp;
At this point I went running down the stairs screaming for my Dad.&nbsp;
Of course by the time my Dad went up to my bedroom to investigate the music
was no longer playing and the radio was off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That same night while I was sleeping, something
woke me up.&nbsp; It was a full moon that night, it was shining thought
my bedroom window.&nbsp; I always pull my shades down at night and it was
strange to wake up with the moon shining in my face.&nbsp; I sat up in
my bed and looked towards the window wondering why one shade was down and
the other not down.&nbsp; All of a sudden the shade on that one window
went up and down three times.&nbsp; Once again I went screaming down the
stairs for my Dad and once again when he came up to check out my window,
the shade was down.&nbsp; At this point I was convince that my older brother
was behind this!&nbsp; He loves playing tricks on everyone, I didn't know
how he did it but I was convinced that it was him!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next night I locked my bedroom door when
I went to sleep, there's no way my brother was able to get into my room.&nbsp;
Again something woke me up in the middle of the night and my shade was
up, the moon shining into my bedroom and a shadow bending over me this
time.&nbsp; I sat up and just looked at him and yelled to get the hell
away from me.&nbsp; He went away and never came back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know it was a ghost, it was a young man and
he respected me when I told him to go away.&nbsp; I don't know who it was
or what he wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've always regretted sending him away without
knowing what he wanted.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Lifetime of Seeing Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jet527@lynnet.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've been seeing ghosts for a very long time.</b>
<br><b>The first time was in a movie theater when I was a teen-ager. I
saw a young man walking down the aisle and he suddenly disappeared. In
retrospect, this was during WWII and maybe it was a local soldier that
had recently crossed over.</b>
<br><b>The second time, and most vivid experience, was when I was stationed
in Germany with the U.S. Army. While I was walking down the street of an
old city, I saw two men fighting atop a castle. One fell to the ground
below -about 150 ft.- and I rushed to the scene to be of assistance. But,
I was almost 900 years too late. What I saw was the fratercide committed
by Wyrich von Oberstein. He and his brother, Emich, both of them were knights,
were fighting over the affections of a young woman from a nearby castle,
Bertha von der Lichtenberg. The mysterious vision took place at 1:00 PM
on a bright sunny day in September and was just as clear as if I were watching
it when it happened in the eleventh century.</b>
<br><b>The third episode took place a few years ago. I am a part-time musician
and once while sitting in the backyard talking with a cousin, who is a
psychic, she asked me about my father, if he had been a musician? I said
no, then she told me what she was seeing and it was determined that the
person she saw was an ancestor who in fact had started the first brass
band in my hometown in Pa. in 1865.</b>
<br><b>One evening as I was softly playing my keyboard, a white translucent
hand appeared beside my right hand. I jokingly quipt, "I'll just play this
one alone, Harry", and the hand faded. I've always felt sorry for poor
old Harry since that evening, I guess he wanted to play a duet.</b>
<br><b>There have been other sightings of Native-Americans and crying women,
etc. when I've been awakened at night, but, the three most vivid to me
are the three I have mentioned above.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Our Happy Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jimeddie@prodigy.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've written before, and I always enjoy the reponses you've given.&nbsp;
Your stories and responses have made me realize my husband and I really
do not need to worry.</b>
<br><b>This is just a few things that have gone on since my last e-mail:</b>
<br><b>Last month we were visited by a little one.&nbsp; I think she was
around 5 or 6, although I only caught a glimpse of her a few times.&nbsp;
Her fun thing to do was to turn the lights off and on for my daughter and
son's pleasure.&nbsp; I had asked my daughter a few times why she didn't
turn off the light, and she informed me, quite emphatically that she had.&nbsp;
Then she asked me if we had a ghost????&nbsp; I shrugged that one time
off, but when it happened a few more times, I do admit I had to wonder.</b>
<br><b>Also, with Christmas and New Year's past us, these few last weeks
have been something else.&nbsp; The ornaments on our tree have re-arranged
themselves more than once.&nbsp; No big deal.&nbsp; But we have a small
ornament that looks like a wrapped up Christmas present.&nbsp; No matter
where this little ornament is placed in the tree, it is constantly played
with.&nbsp; Moves along to it's own jolly dance.&nbsp; Please keep in mind
that we have checked for breezes (from the window, as we live in a very
old structure) and other causes.&nbsp; We've just come to the conclusion
it's the same little one we've been visited by before.&nbsp; Perhaps she
likes it here.&nbsp; I know she's in love with my kids, and for some reason
even has seemed to take a liking to me.&nbsp; Kinda funny when you think
about it.</b>
<br><b>Either, things have been busy here in Mounds Park, but nothing scary
or even worth worrying about.&nbsp; To tell truth, I think this may be
the most lively home I've ever lived in in my 30-some years!</b>
<br><b>Thank you for this site, and for letting me tell my experiences!&nbsp;
If I've any more, I'll be sure to relate!</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to send this experience before but for
some reason it did'nt</b>
<br><b>go though.</b>
<br><b>First and foremost I have to let you know that out of any site I
have</b>
<br><b>seen on this subject no one covers every detail and offers assitance</b>
<br><b>like yours it's the best, and keep doing what your doing. I had
felt it</b>
<br><b>was just my imagination until I discovered your site. Well to the
point.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was about 12 or 13. I lived with my father
and stepmother a</b>
<br><b>stepbrother(who this story is about, who is always playing pranks)
a</b>
<br><b>stepsister well the rest of the people don't matter. It was like
the</b>
<br><b>brady bunch. Anyhow we lived in a 3 bedroom house where all the
rooms</b>
<br><b>were connected by a door. My parents room being in the middle they
had</b>
<br><b>hooks on the inside of their door to keep it locked from us kids</b>
<br><b>entering. Their room also held the laundry room. Which they had
a red</b>
<br><b>curtain over the window. The room was very dark and any thing in
this</b>
<br><b>room was just a shadow. Well this one day it was only myself and</b>
<br><b>stepbrother at home which I mentioned earlier he was a prankster.
I was</b>
<br><b>going to wash some clothes and walked into the room. I had just
taken a</b>
<br><b>couple of steps when I noticed a person in my laundry room looking
like</b>
<br><b>they were looking for something head bowed down. I thought it was
a</b>
<br><b>person my brother to be exact.Same head shape, height. Well it stopped</b>
<br><b>whatever it was doing and stared at me not saying anything. Like
I</b>
<br><b>mentioned before the red curtain only allowed me to see a siloutte
of</b>
<br><b>it.I didn't think anything of it, thought it was my brother and
asked</b>
<br><b>him what he was doing. It did not respond. I thought weird my brother</b>
<br><b>not saying anything. So I proceeded to keep walking toward&nbsp;
the laundry</b>
<br><b>room. This was a large room so having taken a couple more steps,&nbsp;
this</b>
<br><b>thing started coming toward me not walking, kind of glideing. Weird,
I</b>
<br><b>thought as I took a couple more steps and something stopped me and
said</b>
<br><b>don't go any closer, Run! Get the HELL out of there! I didn't question</b>
<br><b>this voice. This thing was still gliding toward me not saying a
thing.</b>
<br><b>It was still pitch black. I turned and ran, heart in my thoat. I
felt at</b>
<br><b>any moment I was going to be grabbed from behind! I know I said
this</b>
<br><b>thing was gliding but in my head I thought I heard footsteps running</b>
<br><b>behind me! I ran into the kicthen. And my stepbrothers room being
on the</b>
<br><b>other side. I laughed a nervous laugh to myself and said of course
thats</b>
<br><b>my brother playing. Went into his room where he was in his bed sound</b>
<br><b>asleep! Tried to rouse him to no avil.Okay so I'm freaked now. Thinking</b>
<br><b>still he's playing. I tried to open the door leading to my parents
room</b>
<br><b>on his side thinking when I ran out he came though the door and
hopped</b>
<br><b>in bed and was playing sleep. It would not have been anytime and
I would</b>
<br><b>have heard something. The door was locked on my parents side their
is no</b>
<br><b>way he could have gotten it opened and locked again. It was hooked
from</b>
<br><b>my parents side no way. To say the least I did not wash clothes
that</b>
<br><b>week.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another story same house. One night I was sleeping
in a room I</b>
<br><b>shared with my stepsister, our room door was open and the bathroom
lite</b>
<br><b>the hallway by moonlight. The position of our room the only thing
that</b>
<br><b>could be seen from our room was the hallway wall. Well anyway you
know</b>
<br><b>how you wake up in the middle of the night? I had my back to the
room</b>
<br><b>and turned over not questioning why I had awaken. But just as I
turned</b>
<br><b>over I seen a old lady about 5'3 once again gliding across the hallway</b>
<br><b>toward the bathroom. Like I mentioned no light just moonlight. I
made</b>
<br><b>out a bun in her hair. The weirdest thing was she was lifting her
dress</b>
<br><b>like in the old days. With the big butt. And I could see though
her. She</b>
<br><b>did not look at me. And she just glilded into the bathroom I thought</b>
<br><b>okay I'm dreamimg and went to sleep. These two experiences I never</b>
<br><b>questioned as paranormal. I thought they were just my imagination.
Until</b>
<br><b>I got older and really since I seen your site. The only thing that</b>
<br><b>frightened the daylights out of me was the laundry room thing. It's</b>
<br><b>creepy just writing it. Whatever it was I hope to never see it again.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for your time and I hope reading this freaks you out the
way it</b>
<br><b>did me, Any insight let me know. Thanks for listening.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello this is my second time trying to send in
a story. The first</b>
<br><b>one did not go though I will try that one again later. Well this
one</b>
<br><b>consists of my current residence. I'm not sure how to explain it.
I'll</b>
<br><b>do my best.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in a two bebroom townhouse, my son has
one room me the other.</b>
<br><b>On occasion a toy that I can't remember where it came from plays
music.</b>
<br><b>At night, when me and my 3 year old son are downstairs we can hear
the</b>
<br><b>toy just playing. I thought maybe it was in the toy box being pressed
by</b>
<br><b>the other toys but going in the room it will be very cold and the
toy</b>
<br><b>will be sitting alone on the floor. Also&nbsp; on Christmas eve
coming back</b>
<br><b>from a party I lat my son open one present we were in a very good
mood</b>
<br><b>and the toy was playing like crazy, I tried to ignore it but it
was</b>
<br><b>playing more than usual. I shouted up the stairs in Gods name please</b>
<br><b>stop. It immediatly stopped only to start a minute later playing
like</b>
<br><b>crazy more than before. I went to try to close th door and it seemed</b>
<br><b>like something was trying to block me from closing it. And when
I was</b>
<br><b>able to after trying and trying it sounds like something hits the
other</b>
<br><b>side . This happens everytime the room is cold the toy is playing.
Other</b>
<br><b>times the room is normal temp. And the door closes with no problem.
I</b>
<br><b>also&nbsp; hear creaking when we are downstairs, running from my
room to my</b>
<br><b>sons. I will go upstairs prepared to yell at my son to find him
sound</b>
<br><b>asleep. I started a agrument with my neighbors because I would hear</b>
<br><b>banging so loud I would think it was them, sounding like it is right</b>
<br><b>upstairs. Only to go over there to find them not knowing what I
am</b>
<br><b>talking about. I recently gave birth to a baby girl, and she will
look</b>
<br><b>into space and laugh for no reason. Then just as sudden start crying.</b>
<br><b>Then times she will be comfortable then for the slightest reason
does</b>
<br><b>not stop crying until&nbsp; we leave the area. My son says he hears
things,</b>
<br><b>but being 3..I don't know what to think of this. Well I've been
advised</b>
<br><b>to throw the toy away. But for the life of me I cannot remember
where it</b>
<br><b>came from. I've been letting my son sleep with me. With the door
to his</b>
<br><b>room shut. But when walking around upstairs the door will seem to
try to</b>
<br><b>open on it's own, but not quite doing it. The feelings of being
watched</b>
<br><b>as I walk by the door even when it's shut. When I'm at&nbsp; your
website the</b>
<br><b>feelings of something behind me. So strong I just know I'm going
to turn</b>
<br><b>around and see something. What do you make of all this? I welcome

<br><b>My Haunting</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jaden_faith@ntlworld.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to share with you, if i may, my experience i had with
ghosts at my old house a year ago today (3/1/01) some of this is quite
scarey and some is unbeleaveable but i promise yu it's all true.</b>
<br><b>After a hard night at work, i staggerd in my house and climbd the
stairs, it was very cold at the time, i remember clearly because i was
taking my shirt off, i got to the top of the stairs and walkd quickly into
my bedroom where soon afterwards i fell asleep but, during the early hours
of the morning i was awoke by a, what sounded like, a painful scream from
a young women, it was very loud, it sounded like it was coming from downstairs
but i lived on my own in this house, near to no friends, hardly anyone
i could trust with my front door key so i just dismissd it as a dream i
was having and put my head down to rest again.</b>
<br><b>When i woke up in the morning i was freezeing, even wrapd in my
double sized quilte, but i had to go to work, so i got out of bed and walkd
across the landing to the toilet but as i passd the top of the stairs i
noticed a vase of mine was smashed, i quickly run down the stairs to investigate
further and upon entering my living room i noticed it was completely trashed,
seats were over turnd, plates and crockry were smashd, the funny thing
about it was nothing had been stolen, no windows were broken infact all
my windows and doors were lockd from the inside, there was no possible
way anyone could have got into the house, i didnt really know what to think
as i started cleaning up the mess, i didnt want to call the police, they
would think im crazey and wasting there time i put furniture back where
it was supposed to go and all broken glass in the bin outside and set off
to work, an hour later for which i got a good telling off for!</b>
<br><b>When the day was finished and i started back on my way home i was
in 2 minds about the whole ordeal and i feard what i might see when i get
back if there was somthing to see that was, and surley enough when i got
back outside my house, i was stopd by the police who said "excuse me sir
your neighbours had reported a women screaming do you mind if we take a
look around?" i told them i lived on my own and agreed to show them around,
after a brisk look around my house and the basement the officer said, "do
you know any local people you may have crossd recently?" and i told him
i didnt really have time to make friends around here as im busy with work
a lot, i didnt tell him about the scream i heard last night thou, but it
was stuck in my mind while i was talking to him 10 minuites later he concluded
it was a childish prank and left leaveing me full of worry, i sat in the
living room and had a drink before i ventured upstairs again to my bed.</b>
<br><b>Around 4:30am i was awoken by a bitter coldness, it had to have
been below freezeing i could see my brethe as i sat up, then, i heard that
scream again, i jumpd sharply out of bed, ran down the stairs and turnd
on the light as i slowly popd my head around the door, i saw my sofa fall
on it's side, there was hardly any damage to the room as i inspected, and
the coldness was rapidly going away as i walkd around slowly.</b>
<br><b>That for me was the last straw, call me a scaredy cat but i just
left, stayd at my sisters house and sold my house soon afterward, but as
you will agree it was scarey.</b>

<p><b>State Hospital</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ERIC_T_HIGGINS@fleet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I stumbled upon your site and it reminded me of something that happened
to</b>
<br><b>me about 15 years ago.</b>
<br><b>I was working at a state hospital for the mentally retarded (built
in the</b>
<br><b>early 1900's)&nbsp; at the 'front desk', answering phones, dispatching
medical</b>
<br><b>staff, etc.&nbsp; The reception area (separated by a half wall and
Plexiglas from</b>
<br><b>the hallway as well as a doorway leading to the hall) was about
10ft by</b>
<br><b>12ft)&nbsp; and was at the very top of a ramp that began a long
hallway (about</b>
<br><b>400 feet) down to the lab area and eventually to the infirmary.</b>
<br><b>It was about 9:30 at night and I was in the back of the reception
area,</b>
<br><b>doing some filing and&nbsp; out of the corner of my eye,&nbsp; a
stooped figure rush</b>
<br><b>by the front of the reception area and down the ramp.&nbsp; At first,
I thought</b>
<br><b>it was one of the 'clients' at the hospital (some of whom had privileges
to</b>
<br><b>walk around 'on campus' and some of whom had physical infirmities
that would</b>
<br><b>cause them to stoop while walking).&nbsp; It struck me as odd that
a client would</b>
<br><b>be out and about at this time of night (they were usually in their
buildings</b>
<br><b>by 8:30).&nbsp; It didn't' alarm me at the time, but I thought I'd
take a look in</b>
<br><b>the hall.</b>
<br><b>I opened the door to the hallway and looked to see who was running
down the</b>
<br><b>hall, but there was no one there.&nbsp; There was another hallway
off the main</b>
<br><b>hall, but the second hallway was at least 250 feet down and whoever
(or</b>
<br><b>whatever) it was, couldn't have made it down to the 'turn' in the
few</b>
<br><b>seconds it took me to walk the 3 feet from the rear of the reception
area,</b>
<br><b>open the door and look down the hallway.&nbsp; Looking back on the
situation (and</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure if this thought came to me after the occurrence, but
I don't</b>
<br><b>recall hearing any footsteps as the figure went by).</b>
<br><b>I called the night supervisor (upstairs in the same building) and
she</b>
<br><b>reaffirmed my belief that none of the clients should be wandering
around at</b>
<br><b>this time of night.&nbsp; I did a quick 'census' (calling all buildings
and</b>
<br><b>making sure that everyone was 'present and accounted for'.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was assured</b>
<br><b>by staff&nbsp; that all the clients were in their buildings for
the night.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>came down and I related my story, she agreed that it would be nearly</b>
<br><b>impossible for someone to dash down the hall that quickly and 'hide'.</b>
<br><b>I related the story to the woman who worked the overnight shift
when she</b>
<br><b>came in at 11:00 PM.&nbsp; She said she has had strange experiences
while she had</b>
<br><b>worked there (strange lights or 'orbs' on the wall), and her brother,
who</b>
<br><b>was on the Housekeeping crew had odd experiences: running water
in an unused</b>
<br><b>building where the water had been shut off for years, flushing toilets
in</b>
<br><b>the same building).&nbsp; Though I thought it was strange that housekeeping
would</b>
<br><b>be in a building that wasn't in use, but I didn't think of that
at the time.</b>
<br><b>At the time, I would probably have categorized myself as a 'skeptical</b>
<br><b>believer', even now, I'm unsure about what I saw. It could very
well have</b>
<br><b>been a client who had sneaked out of his (and I'm sure it was a
him)</b>
<br><b>building, and made it back before I called his building.&nbsp; Who
knows !</b><b></b>

<p><b>Why Me ?!?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: VasquezE@DNB.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Over the years I had many encounters with ghosts and other strange
things.</b>
<br><b>It all started when I was very young. I can remember one night as
I was</b>
<br><b>laying in bed trying to fall asleep I started to hear these voices
that</b>
<br><b>sounded like they were coming from above me,almost as if there were
a circle</b>
<br><b>of angles calling me from the heavens.They kept saying</b>
<br><b>come....come....come,and they just kept getting louder. I ran to
my parents</b>
<br><b>room and told my dad who immediatly went outside to check but he
didn't see</b>
<br><b>anything.Another time in this same house I was taking a shower and
was</b>
<br><b>washing my face.When I washed the soap off my face and opened my
eyes I&nbsp; saw</b>
<br><b>an angel. She had hair down to her waist and was standing right</b>
<br><b>beside me.I jumped out of the tub scared to death .I still remember
the</b>
<br><b>image clearly .I know it was an angel because it had wings and was</b>
<br><b>beautiful.She was a solid beige color and almost looked like a statue
as she</b>
<br><b>stood beside me.The weird thing was that right before I had gotten
into the</b>
<br><b>shower I had gotten into an arguement with my mom and had started
crying as</b>
<br><b>I took my shower. I don't know if this angel was there to comfort
me or what</b>
<br><b>but it scared me more than anything.The scariest thing that I remember</b>
<br><b>happening to me was at another house. I must have been about 6 years
old. I</b>
<br><b>was laying in my bed trying to fall asleep. My bed was positioned
so that it</b>
<br><b>layed against my bedroom wall with a window across from it. I was
almost</b>
<br><b>falling asleep when I started feeling like it was getting really
hot in my</b>
<br><b>room .I tried to ignore the heat but it started to become unbearable.I
had</b>
<br><b>been laying on my side which faced the wall and decided to lay on
my other</b>
<br><b>side.As I turned around I saw a huge flame of fire just outside
of my</b>
<br><b>window. Not thinking I ran towards the window and the fire immediatly</b>
<br><b>dissapeared. I could have sworn I saw it get sucked into the ground.
Once</b>
<br><b>again I told my parents about it but they really didn't beleive
me this</b>
<br><b>time. I also told my grandmother who was still alive at that time
and she</b>
<br><b>told me that where you see fire there is gold buried. She encouraged
me to</b>
<br><b>dig but I was to scared. Till this day I pass by that old house
woundering</b>
<br><b>if there really is something buried there or if it was just the
Devil paying</b>
<br><b>me a visit that night. These are just a few things that have happened
to me</b>
<br><b>during my child hood years. I am 21 now and haven't had anything
thing</b>
<br><b>happen to me in a long time,until about a week ago .My husband and
I are</b>
<br><b>renting a house that belongs to his mother. My mother in law used
to live</b>
<br><b>there with my sister in law who is older than my husband. We sleep
in the</b>
<br><b>master bedroom where his sister used to sleep.I remember her always
telling</b>
<br><b>us that she would see and hear things in that room. Just the other
day I was</b>
<br><b>using the restroom when all of a sudden the lights went out.OK......maybe</b>
<br><b>the light bulb burned out I thought. So I finished up and noticed
that the</b>
<br><b>light switch had been turned off! I turned the switch and the light
came</b>
<br><b>back on,oh my God something or someone turned the light of in my</b>
<br><b>presence,now I'm just woundering if this is going to start happening
to me</b>
<br><b>all over again!</b>

<br><b>Unknown Ghosts And a Guardian Angel</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jacobo@uniserve.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I live in White Rock, British Columbia and have a had a few interesting</b>
<br><b>experiences in the 21 yrs of my life. I am what many term a Natural
Witch</b>
<br><b>and I consider myself Wiccan though I do not practice. But I am
very much a</b>
<br><b>critic when it comes to ghostly tales and am not easily frightened.
However,</b>
<br><b>when I was younger a number of odd things happened to me.</b>
<br><b>The first, which is not very frightening, revolves around a cat
I had as a</b>
<br><b>child. Her name was Fuzzball and I sadly only had her for a short
time. She</b>
<br><b>got out of our yard one day and was hit by a car. I was the one
who found</b>
<br><b>her and being only seven years old I was very upset. According to
my mother</b>
<br><b>I cried nearly all day but that night I stopped and by the next
morning,</b>
<br><b>though I was sad to have lost my friend, I was no longer mourning.
I kept</b>
<br><b>saying that she was still with me. And she was and is. I tend to
think of</b>
<br><b>Fuzzball as my guardian angel or spirit guide and I have seen her
or felt</b>
<br><b>her presence many times over the years. She has a hell of a sense
of humour</b>
<br><b>and has played a few tricks on me.</b>
<br><b>The real ghost stories begin when I was very young, around four
years old.</b>
<br><b>Our old house was two floors, though considered a rancher because
only one</b>
<br><b>floor was above ground on the street side. My bedroom was upstairs,
near the</b>
<br><b>front door. The door of my room faced out onto the landing/hallway
and the</b>
<br><b>stairs to the basement gaped out there. Now, children dislike dark
stairways</b>
<br><b>as a rule, I find and I was no different. If I awoke in the night
I would go</b>
<br><b>to my door, rip it open and dash along the hallway to the bathroom
where I</b>
<br><b>would flip on the light and shut the door. It was the same journey
on the</b>
<br><b>way back. I still vividly remember doing this until the day we moved
out</b>
<br><b>when I was eight. Thing was, the basement (which was well lit and
not what I</b>
<br><b>would call menacing) frightened me even during the day. I was loathe
to</b>
<br><b>venture down there even on the brightest summer days. It was always
kinda</b>
<br><b>cold and clammy and it felt "wrong". This was especially true of
the guest</b>
<br><b>room my aunt slept in when she was down from Kelowna. I would NOT
go in</b>
<br><b>there for any reason unless someone was with me. I remember once
I was very</b>
<br><b>sick and had a high temperature so my parents put me down there
for a nap,</b>
<br><b>since it was much cooler than my room. I awoke, covered in sweat
(my fever</b>
<br><b>had broken)and terrified. I nearly killed myself running up our
stairs and</b>
<br><b>never once did I look back.</b>
<br><b>When we moved out, the house we moved into was a rancher - one floor
and no</b>
<br><b>stairs except into the sunken living room. I felt much safer in
this house</b>
<br><b>(which had only had two previous owners) and was glad that the bathroom
was</b>
<br><b>only across a narrow hallway from my room. But things can occur
even in</b>
<br><b>small spaces. I was about 13yrs old and my best friend Melissa,
who is three</b>
<br><b>years younger, was sleeping over. We had turned my closet into a
fort and</b>
<br><b>were sleeping in it. Well, Melissa was, I was sleeping with my head
towards</b>
<br><b>her forming a letter "T". In the middle of the night I realized
I had to</b>
<br><b>pee. Not wanting to awaken my friend I decided not to turn on the
light in</b>
<br><b>my room. My eyes had adjusted to the dark and I had no problem finding
my</b>
<br><b>way across the hall. Now, before I go further I should explain the
set-up of</b>
<br><b>our hallway. I'll try and make a diagram:</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tv&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>TV Room&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I--&nbsp;&nbsp;
---+</b>
<br><b>------------+&nbsp; I Front&nbsp;&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hall&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My Room&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; I--------+</b>
<br><b>------------&nbsp;&nbsp; I&lt;-------------- Wall with Picture</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Guest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; I________</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Room&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; ________I
&lt;--Bathroom</b>
<br><b>------------+&nbsp; I</b><b></b>
<p><b>This may not be exact, but you get the idea. It was on the trip back
that</b>
<br><b>things got weird. Having turned on the light while in the bathroom
my eyes</b>
<br><b>were no longer adjusted to the dark. I was slowly making my way
back across</b>
<br><b>the darkened hallway when, just outside my door, I brushed past
someone. I</b>
<br><b>thought it was my friend, because it felt like her height. We had
been</b>
<br><b>friends since she was a baby and I knew what she felt like. I had
thought</b>
<br><b>she was asleep but figured she had awoken for the same reason I
had. I</b>
<br><b>turned to whisper to her, but in the semi-darkness saw there was
no one</b>
<br><b>there. Now, we have, as I have shown on the diagram, a picture on
the hall</b>
<br><b>wall. It is a large painting, framed with a glass front and it reflects</b>
<br><b>perfectly, just like a mirror. I had watched many things on the
TV when my</b>
<br><b>parents thought I was abed. And at night it reflected the clock
numbers from</b>
<br><b>the VCRs. As I turned to what I had thought was Melissa, these reflected</b>
<br><b>lights wavered, like things do when you look at them through heat
waves. The</b>
<br><b>hair on my neck came to attention, I made a strange choking-mewling
sound</b>
<br><b>and lept into my room, slamming the door behind me. This awoke my
friend,</b>
<br><b>who had been fast asleep and for the rest of the night we alway
turned the</b>
<br><b>light on and kept both the bathroom door and my door open when someone
was</b>
<br><b>doing their business.</b>
<br><b>This hallway seemed to be a focal centre for occurances. This one
also</b>
<br><b>involves my friend Melissa, though she was a few years younger at
the time.</b>
<br><b>When she slept over back then, we had to sleep in seperate rooms
so we</b>
<br><b>"would get a good sleep" as our mothers said. Who ever heard of
getting a</b>
<br><b>good sleep when someone slept over? Anyways, Missy would have to
sleep in</b>
<br><b>the guest room which she has since told me she hated, cause it made
her feel</b>
<br><b>odd. One night, she was lying there after my parents had gone to
bed. The</b>
<br><b>door to the hall was open and she saw someone walk by the door and
peer in.</b>
<br><b>Thinking it was me and that I wanted her to sneek into my room (not</b>
<br><b>difficult since they are next to each other) she got up. But when
she opened</b>
<br><b>my door I was fast asleep. I came into the story when I suddenly
felt a warm</b>
<br><b>body crawl into my bed and grab me in a very tight bear hug. I remember</b>
<br><b>turning on my light and seeing Missy's pale face huddled against
my shoulder</b>
<br><b>- she was totally terrified. From then on we insisted that we sleep
in the</b>
<br><b>same room when Melissa slept over and except for the one occurance
we've</b>
<br><b>never had another bad night.</b>
<br><b>Things have settled down over the years and I no longer fear going
to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom in the night. Though I still always have my light on when
I do so.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Watcher</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: avamp4u@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>this may not be an amazing story; it's a simple story, but it was
very real and scary at the time.</b>
<br><b>I was about 12 or 13 years old and my mother was still alive (but
she was dieing of cancer at this time).&nbsp; So, of course, my mother
was going through this "Lord is going to heal me if I believe" kinda thing.
Don't get me wrong, I do believe in God, but she was what you call a "Holy
Roller" at the time.&nbsp; Being at a difficult age with peers, I was having
a hard time dealing with her sickness and the huge change of what I could
and couldn't do. She was now telling me that I couldn't listen to rock
n' roll, have anything that was mystical or "new age"(for example, unicorns),
or have any posters of anyone in rock n' roll music; because this was all
considered evil.</b>
<br><b>(but please understand, I was not mad at her or will never will
be, I understand now what she was going through, and I will always love
her and I know she is better now that she is with our Lord and Savior,
God bless her soul.)</b>
<br><b>The reason why I'm telling you this is because I think that this
was part of the reason this occurance happened.&nbsp; I was young, confused,
and going through a difficult time in my life.</b>
<br><b>My mother and myself was at one of her friend's house, Cindy, who
also had a daughter my age that was my bestfriend.&nbsp; Anyways, there
were also other chuchgoing women there as well.&nbsp; I was the only child
there at the time though.&nbsp; We were all sitting around the table talking.&nbsp;
About nothing in paticular.&nbsp; Then Cindy stopped in mid-sentence and
said that she felt something weird, but thought that maybe it was her imagination,
so we ignored it.&nbsp; But about five minutes later, Cindy's mother felt
something also, something very stong this time.&nbsp; She said that she
felt somekind of presence there. At first, I didn't believe it, but when
we all held hands to pray, I then felt it.&nbsp; I had my eyes closed to
pray, and then there it was, in my mind.&nbsp; An evil enity, which I do
not believe it was ever human at any time.&nbsp; I felt it all around me
and through me.&nbsp; This enity was laughing and talking to me, telling
me that I was weak and that he will win this fight,(the fight over my soul
I believe).&nbsp; I was so scared at the time, and I was crying, telling
it no, that he was not going to win.&nbsp; Finally, I prayed unto the Lord
and asked Jesus to protect me and all that was around me, I commanded the
enity to leave me and the house, and to not ever return. I felt this emmense
strength from within and from above when I did this, and then he was gone,
and I knew he was gone for good. I never felt a such complete peace before
or since that moment in time. I then looked up at everyone and told them
that he was gone, and they all laughed with sheer happiness and relief.&nbsp;
My mother said that at that moment, there was a warm glow coming from within
me, and that they all saw that glow and knew that he really was gone.</b>
<br><b>I didn't relize until then that Julie was standing behind me with
her hands on my head praying over me. And I have never had an experience
with him since, though I have had others..... but I won't go into that
right now.</b>
<br><b>I don't know if this is what you would consider a ghost story, but
it is of the paranormal.&nbsp; This is something that I have never forgotten,
but haven't spoken of it much.&nbsp; I never felt that anyone would believe
me, and some of you out there may still not believe; I even still have
a hard time believing it myself sometimes.&nbsp; But it's true and with
my mother as a witness.</b>

<p><b>The House on Walnut Ave.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jippergee@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It all started five years ago when me and my family moved&nbsp; into
a 150</b>
<br><b>year old house. The house was located in one of oldest part of town,this</b>
<br><b>area was a swamp when the house was built.</b>
<br><b>The strange happenings started almost at once. My mother was the
first</b>
<br><b>to experience the ghosts. She was laying on a couch in the living</b>
<br><b>room,when she was awaken by the sound of russtling cloths,she was
alone</b>
<br><b>in the house at the time,so she thought this was very odd. When
she got</b>
<br><b>up to investigate, my mother discoverd that some vines that were
on top</b>
<br><b>of a cabinet were set down very neatly in front of the cabinet.
She</b>
<br><b>tried tilting and shaking the cabinet to make the vines fall like
she</b>
<br><b>found them, but her efforts were in vain.</b>
<br><b>The next thing happened about to weeks later and was probably the
most</b>
<br><b>astounding. My mother and I were laying in her bed, which faced
the</b>
<br><b>kitchen,there was no door so we got a pretty good view of the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>We were wide awake and talking when I heard a noise in the kitchen.
When</b>
<br><b>I looked I saw the shape of a human head floating over the island
that</b>
<br><b>was in the middle of the room. I was so afraid that I started to
cry,</b>
<br><b>then my mom saw it too. We watched in horror as the head floated
to the</b>
<br><b>living room.We both started screaming for my father and my little</b>
<br><b>brother, who were at the far end of the house .We did this for about</b>
<br><b>five minutes, with no answer. We finally got up enough courage to
go get</b>
<br><b>them. When we got to were they were sleeping and asked them why
they</b>
<br><b>would not answer, they said they could not hear us. It was like
what</b>
<br><b>ever it was, was trying to split us up. When we told my father what
had</b>
<br><b>happened, he thought that we had seen a burgler or something. We
all</b>
<br><b>went into the kitchen together, while dad was checking the back
door,</b>
<br><b>everyone of us heard the sound of a big heavy door being shut, there
was</b>
<br><b>no such door in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In each</b>
<br><b>room of the house ther were different feelings, like in the living
room</b>
<br><b>there was the feeling of sadness or depression. In my room there
was the</b>
<br><b>feeling of evil and feeling of being watched. My brothers room and
mine</b>
<br><b>were once a part of a wrap around porch. The library was once the</b>
<br><b>bedroom of two elderly sisters.</b>
<br><b>There were many different ghosts in that house. There was an old
woman</b>
<br><b>who was seen playing with the microwave,we actually heard the beeping</b>
<br><b>sounds. She was also seen in the library. There also was a child
,who</b>
<br><b>would call "mommy" , late at night. There was an evil ghost, it
would</b>
<br><b>jerk our cloths and pulled us backwards,we felt this ones presence
all</b>
<br><b>through the house. There was also a cat and a dog. We heard the
cat</b>
<br><b>quite often, we would watch as scratches apeared on our arms and
legs an</b>
<br><b>we could feel it,too. And then there was the black man. We all seen
him</b>
<br><b>at different times and in different rooms. He was very tall and
lanky</b>
<br><b>and he walked slumped over and swinging his arms. He was always
seen</b>
<br><b>wearing pants, and some times he had on a shirt and some times he</b>
<br><b>did'nt. He was first seen on the porch opening the door ,than he
was</b>
<br><b>seen in the kitchen, untill he made his way to the library where
there</b>
<br><b>was a big window. He pulled back the curtain and started looking
out. He</b>
<br><b>was never seen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have</b>
<br><b>moved and have had no more experiences. We drove by the old house
about</b>
<br><b>a week ago, It was like coming home to see old friends.As we were</b>
<br><b>driving away, we felt as if we were being watched.</b><b></b>

<br><b>presence fills me with wonder and indignation.Bless you for your
patience;the</b>
<br><b>out of body attacks differ from my dreams in their vivid 3d total
sensory</b>
<br><b>envelopement and the inherent visciousness in provoking angst, realistic
in</b>
<br><b>every way as compared to consciousness.The perspective is waking
to find i</b>
<br><b>am asleep wrapped in delusional thoughts and scenes, dreams&nbsp;
so aligned with</b>
<br><b>negative thoughts that the scenarios reveal that they are imposed,by
virtue</b>
<br><b>of their worst scenario plots and their vividness.They,whomever
these</b>
<br><b>discorporate negative thought entities are , are masters of delusions&nbsp;
and i</b>
<br><b>have&nbsp; recognized the raw power of the vividness as more than
my murky dream</b>
<br><b>scenarios could ever muster and am convinced&nbsp; we are dead wrong
about the</b>
<br><b>nature of dreaming,itself;At night ,your astral body travels to
realms from</b>
<br><b>angelic to demonic,a spirit world of myriad vibrational levels and
the</b>
<br><b>pictures you see on the backs of your eyelids,while you rem,are
not dreams</b>
<br><b>but visits,souvenirs of a greater reality.Like a goldfish who never
suspects</b>
<br><b>a greater world beyond the ponds surface,the limited awareness of
humankind</b>
<br><b>floats beneath the surface of a greater reality;groping,mouth agape

sadly,ive only met sharks,not the</b>
<br><b>porpoises,in the ocean currents of unconsciousness,between 2 and
6 am and</b>
<br><b>grounding is essential,but,how?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we struggle
into consciousness,each</b>
<br><b>morning,a self-erasing mechanism destroys memories of dreams;only
vague and</b>

of these</b>

description of haunting</b>
<br><b>at night a large black shapeless mass turns out the lights while
you are in</b>
<br><b>the labyrinth of mazes hallways enroute to storage rooms,in the
back,and</b>
<br><b>stands in your way laughing,evilly,there is a terror and a strong
wave of</b>
<br><b>hatred felt.Trying to retrace your way in the darkness,back towards
the</b>
<br><b>elevator,hugging the walls, brings air blown onto the back of your
neck,your</b>
<br><b>name whispered in your ear and your clothing clutched and plucked
at by</b>
<br><b>unseen hands.The presence is large and blacker than the darkness
surrounding</b>
<br><b>it;you feel a sense of being watched and sense waves of intense
hatred which</b>
<br><b>is undeniable.Flashlights fail and dim and blink out when one tries
to</b>
<br><b>outsmart its turning the lights out.The six floor apartment building
ajuts</b>
<br><b>the fort hamilton army base,a quarter mile away and is at the virtual
foot of</b>
<br><b>the brooklyn side of the verrazzano bridge.I have been the supt
of that</b>
<br><b>building between 1990 and 1999 and have encountered that entity
through my</b>
<br><b>denial to acceptance to raw fear of it.It has intruded into my</b>
<br><b>dreams;followed me into the elevator and into my bedroom to evoke
horrid</b>
<br><b>worst scenario nightmares which betray that it knows our minds better
that we</b>
<br><b>do;I avoided the basement,neglected my duties there and was subsequently</b>
<br><b>fired by the management office .This building stands at the intersection
of</b>
<br><b>92 street and fort hamilton pkwy,in brooklyn new york.The psychic
attacks</b>
<br><b>continue,nonetheless;i am drowsing over the bathroom sink;half asleep
and</b>
<br><b>yawning,supporting myself with my arms an both sides of the&nbsp;
sink,tired,</b>
<br><b>still half asleep naked, when something brushes my face and loins,both
just</b>
<br><b>below the sink and just above my face, above the sink.I open my
bleary eyes</b>
<br><b>and see an enormous conglomeration of festooned fishhooks surrounding</b>
<br><b>me,hanging from the ceiling across the sink;a&nbsp; filigree chandelier
of razor</b>
<br><b>sharp connected fishhooks that ive stumbled onto,stark naked , now,with</b>
<br><b>pinching sharp connections at my groin and lip and face that apprise</b>
<br><b>me,quickly panicking now,that ive been deeply hooked in myriad places;
intomy</b>
<br><b>genitals, pulling through my lip and my cheek and that to move backwards,in</b>
<br><b>shock or panic flight is to deeply gaff myself further,inextricably
and</b>
<br><b>beyond help.I am attached painfully and as i lift my right arm to
gently work</b>
<br><b>out the fishhook,razor thin,dozens of others fasten against and
bite into my</b>
<br><b>flesh scaring me further into desperation and deeping my angst as
i</b>
<br><b>awaken,quickly now,to a gathering sense of panic and helplessness
and the</b>
<br><b>hook in my cheek tears deeply into my mouth and the fishhhooks,unseen,beneath</b>
<br><b>the sink begin to bite deeper and more painfully into me,I am a
marionette</b>
<br><b>impaled&nbsp; from face to scrotum andhave wandered unknowing into
this macrome of</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;razorblade like fishhooks some madman must have concocted
over my sink in my</b>
<br><b>bathroom,The slightest movement brings sharp&nbsp; painful reminders
that i an</b>
<br><b>stuck fast and in&nbsp; a nightmarish predictament i cannot solve
as i am</b>
<br><b>screaming,muted for help from my wife asleep in the other room&lt;Opening
my</b>
<br><b>mouth&nbsp; to hollar i feel the deeper bite of the hook into the

trapped and</b>
<br><b>my fear level climbs to near hysteria as i awaken,suddenly,in bed.Again
i am</b>
<br><b>aware of the imposed horror for etherial feasting but dazzled at
the raw</b>
<br><b>power of the&nbsp; attack; the totality of sensory&nbsp; construction

attacks</b>
<br><b>delivered,on this night and represent a continued program of spiritual

Some time ago a friend of my wife's</b>
<br><b>and a group of friends made a trip to historical sites in the Middle
East.</b>
<br><b>During the tour she had a chance to visit a cave on one of the hills
around</b>
<br><b>the holy city of Makkah. Inside, she was attracted by -she swears
it was</b>
<br><b>nothing but- a bright light perched on the cave's wall, and took
a picture of</b>
<br><b>it. When she returned home the rolls of film she used during the
trip were</b>
<br><b>developed. And she was surprised to see a picture (attached) of
a creature</b>
<br><b>she never saw before in her life. She took the picture and showed
it to her</b>
<br><b>spiritual teacher. The ustadzah explained that it was satan in one
of its</b>
<br><b>forms, as was described by her teacher decades ago while she was
still in</b>
<br><b>school.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Oatman AZ.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mholes@lvcm.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>The wife and I spent the night at the old Oatman hotel in Oatman
Arizona.Although we did'nt hear of any hauntings by Clark Gable or a chambermaid,we
did hear of a ghost who resides within the hotel.The owner,manager and
employees refer to him as Oatie,a drunken Irish miner who died behind the
hotel in 1930,his body was not found for several days.His remains were
dumped in a shallow grave (actually a depression in the ground)as the story
goes and never properly buried.He lived in room #24 of the old hotel.We
chose this room for the night not because it was his room but because the
old creaky sign out front was so noisy in the heavy wind.We never actually
saw Oatie,than again both of us were pretty skeptical,the old hotel is
drafty and the wind whistles through holes in the metal roofing and old
windows so the night was very noisy and we had trouble sleeping.But throughout
the night,(niether of us slept but a few fitfull winks)there would be times
when it seemed all sound hushed in an instant.The sign swinging noisily
in front of the hotel would silence in mid-swing,no wind noise,no nothing.Like
someone dropped a thick blanket over the room.And in that silence you could
hear footsteps out in the hall,they did'nt creak on the old floors as ours
did no matter how careful we were(we tried).The footsteps would stop at
the other hotel room doors(never ours)and we could hear the lock cylinders
on the doors turn as if someone unlocked it,than relocked it.Never heard
the doors open though,this repeated all the way down the hall OVER and
OVER and OVER all night long.There was also the sound of someone tumbling
what sounded like those little wooden blocks kids play with down the hall.Now
I know you are probably saying"it may have been another guest or an employee,but
this is impossible as we were the only guests in the hotel(it was the 25th
of Dec.)and the only employee in the building was the manager who resides
in an apartment at the top of the stairs and we could hear her in her room
during the "block tossing " incidents.thought you might like to give Oatie
the credit for his haunting instead of Gable.</b><b></b>

<br><b>No Surprizes</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lil_bow_wow007@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I don't like surprises! When I came hme from school one day my mom
told me</b>
<br><b>there was going to be a surprise coming for me the following weekend!
So of</b>
<br><b>course i was excited. come to find out my sister was coming in from
LA,</b>
<br><b>California! I was so excited that i screamed in front of the whole
airport!</b>
<br><b>Well anyways she was only coming for the weekend so we had little
time to do</b>
<br><b>anything. Saturday we had lots of fun shopping, and doing the usual
girly</b>
<br><b>stuff. But come Sunday, we had the biggest surprise to come. She
had just</b>
<br><b>awokin me up to tell me to get dressed for the 2 hour drive to the
air-port.</b>
<br><b>So i got dressed, and had breakfast while she took a shower. When
she had</b>
<br><b>gotten out, and started drying off i heard a blood-curdiling SCREAM!!
And of</b>
<br><b>couurse i ran to see what happened. She said that she was facing
the other</b>
<br><b>way of the shower and she saw the shampoo in the mirror (in the
shower) and</b>
<br><b>went back to getting dressed. But when she turned around the shampoo
bottles</b>
<br><b>were on the counter. ( may i tell you that my mother had a sister
that died</b>
<br><b>when my sister was about 12, 13 and when i was 2,3 we had our dad
die the</b>
<br><b>following month or so later. We were very close to both of them
especially</b>
<br><b>My Father.)</b>
<br><b>So she was thinking that it was some considence. Because a few years
back</b>
<br><b>she was at work and the boss called her into his office and when
she got</b>
<br><b>back the paper in the computer printer was full of X's, just then
she had to</b>
<br><b>go to the wash room and when she got back she saw that the printer
was now</b>
<br><b>full O's. By this she got really freaked out but she just thought
of it as a</b>
<br><b>different way for the paranormal to say their feelings to their
loved ones :)</b><b></b>
