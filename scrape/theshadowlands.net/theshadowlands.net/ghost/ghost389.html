<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My family has never been the
type to stay in one place for long, so we have moved around quite a bit so far.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After moving around NJ (the
1st my parents lived in together was also "haunted" but I was to
little to remember and only know about it from what they've told me) to PA a
couple times we settled in a nice house over in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>. It was an older house and the
mayors family had lived there for some time with both of his parents dying in
the house. We moved in and it needed alot of work, so there wasnt any capret in
my room for a while and I ended up sleeping with my parents for a bit. When
there was carpet in the room I finally went and started sleeping in there. I
would wake up to my mother yelling at me because the TV was on full blast (I
didnt have the tv on when I went to sleep, and If I did I certanly would have
been more sneeky about watching it because I knew my parents would be mad if
they found out I was watching it). This would happen quite frequently. When i
was around 7 and 8, I would start to wake up in the middle of the night and
notice my closet door was open. (I ALWAYS closed the door before I went to
bed). I would get up, close it and go back to bed, just to wake up an hour or
so later with it open again. I figured the lock might have popped out since it
was an old house and decided to leave it, but I looked over and saw an older
woman coming out of my closet, she had a flower dress on and a white shall with
little dangles on the bottom of it. She would come out of the closet and I
would put the blanket over my head and start to hum to myself. After a while I
would get up enough courage to look back over, and she'd still be there.. It
seems as though she'd only move when I watched her. As I got older and more use
to these visits of hers I decided I would watch to see what she did one night.
I closed the closet door, and as always it was open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(The closet door would
always open itself but I'd only get a visit from her once a week, give or take)
She made her schedualed appearance and came out of the closet, looking as she
always did.. not fully solid but not completely transparent. I never actually
got a look at her feet because I was usually looking at her face.. She was
older, and her hair was white and bundled up. She seemed kind but sinister at
the same time. I watched as she made her way across my room and as she got to
the foot of my bed I went and put the blanket over my head and hoped she might
go away, or I'd fall asleep and wake up with her being gone as thats what
always happened. I finally decided to take the blanket off my head and she was
still there, but closer up on the side/ end of my bed where my calfs were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point I decided to make a break for
it and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>jumped off my bed to the bed on
the other side of the room (I had two twin beds in my room for when my older
sister came to visit or someone spent the night) jumped off the other twin and
ran to my parents room. We moved out not to long after that, probably 6 months.
But during the last month of living there along with the older lady came out a
younger gentle man and a younger lady. They were both very "handsome"
<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">looking almost like they'd
be going to a 1930's dance. I thought my room was getting a bit to crouded so I
slept in the guest room for the last couple weeks I lived there. The bed was
facing out to the window so I didnt have to look at any closets.. But right
outside the window was a graveyeard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this house we moved into my grandmothers
house down in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Carolina</st1:place></st1:State>
(My grandmother had just died and the other house we were moving into wasnt
fully built yet). The first night we were there my parents slept on the pullout
couch with my litle brother and I slept on my grandmothers water bed with my
little sister. (Just as a side note: She died on the same water bed less then a
month earlier) I woke up in the middle of the night and smelt a very strong
perfume smell. My grandmother was always fond of perfumes and there were still
lots of them on the dresser so I figured my sister must have been playing with
them but she and everyone else in the house were asleep. When I got back in the
bed from checking on everyone I realized the smell was gone. I went back to bed
and a couple minutes later smelt the perfume again. I also felt someone bending
over me and... it was like, they lightly put their hand on my shoulder and
kissed my forehead. I just always assumed it was my grandmother saying goodbye
to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the same house we had our
dog with us, he was a stray my father brought home after he wouldnt leave my
dad alone at work. We quickly became attached to the big dog and my father let
us keep him. (I felt bad for him becuase he had to enure the move from PA to NC
and he got very car sick) Down in NC there was a big pen my grandmother use to
keep her dog in. Since my aunt took the dog the cage was empty and we decided
tp put Ben (my dog) in it. He didnt like to be cooped up all day in the cage so
in the morning we'd let him out and he'd roam all day occasionally stopping
back home to say hello and them left again, but he was always back before it
got dark for dinner time and so he could be put in his cage till the next day.
One day he wasnt home for dinner and I started to get worried. My mother let me
stay up for a while longer and wait to see if he come home. It was around 9:30
-10:00pm ish when I looked out the sliding door and saw him waiting there for
me (he would always wait there for us if we were inside). I ran to tell my mom
Ben was home, went and got my shoes and went outside. When I got out there I
went to his pen thinking he might have went in it, but he wasnt there. I called
him and looked all around for him (He liked to have things his way but he was a
very obedient dog). He didnt come that night and I had the most horrible feeling
something happened. I didnt sleep and got on the bus the next day where my bus
driver told me she saw my dog. I got very excited and asked where, when she
told me he was on the side of the road dead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(This was very harsh considering I was only 10 years old, and the dog
never did anything to her becides try to come to school with me a couple times
on the bus). I didnt want to believe her and averted my eyes from looking out
the window. Earlier on in the morning<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
got called out of class and my mother was there and told me she found Ben and
that he was gone. She took me home and I cried the rest of the day. I was also
upset I didnt get to see him before she burried him, but his body was very
mangled and bloody. I went to school the next day, still extremely upset and a
girl in the grade ahead of me who lived up the road started telling me how
sorry she was. She said she was going to gymnastics around 6pm and they saw my
dog get hit by a truck but their dad wouldnt stop to help him because he said
the impact had probably killed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ben, and
the other truck didnt stop either. This made me even more distraught becuase I
KNEW I saw him that night at 10pm. I even went over to the door and tapped on
it where his nose was. Then I remembered my grandmother giving me a kiss
goodbye and I realized that was what my dog was doing. Saying goodbye to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">First, let me commend you on
a terrific website.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's the best on the
web when researching the paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, I am a believer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Always
have been, always will be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find the
paranormal field to be extremely interesting, especially as it pertains to
ghosts, or hauntings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I noticed on your list of
"Haunted Locations" in the state of <st1:State w:st="on">California</st1:State>,
you have listed a <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Brand</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Glendale</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">CA</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have an interesting story I'd like to share
with you regarding that park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Brand</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
is a nice family park with a couple of baseball fields, picnic grounds with an
adjacent children's playground, public restroom facilities, the Brand Park
Library as well as nature trails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
park used to be the residential estate of a Dr. Brand, thus the name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I coached my stepson's
little league baseball team there for two years, 1997 and 1998.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was during our first season that my wife experienced
something very strange in the company of her daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We had just completed a
Saturday afternoon game and I, as an assistant coach, was giving out practice
schedules to the parents and seeing my players off with their parents when my
step-daughter (who was 3 at the time) had to use the restroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My wife took her and I went with my step-son
to wait for them in our car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few
minutes, she and her daughter came hustling back to my car and in a very
frightened tone, she told me, "Hurry up, let's go home!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Her tone startled me and I
asked her what was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She related
the following to me:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She took her
daughter, Aimee, to the girl's restroom and had her sit in one of the stalls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stepped out of the stall and a bit to the
side of it so as to allow Aimee some privacy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As she did so, Aimee looked up towards a window, which was located a
foot or so short of the ceiling (and about 7-8 feet off of the ground) and
said, "Hello".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a short
pause she said, "Aimee", as though answering someone's question about
her name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She never took her glance away
from the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My wife asked her
daughter, who at this time was finishing up her business, who she was talking
to and Aimee replied, "The man, mommy."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The man in the window".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After saying that, Aimee returned her
attention to the window and said, "Oh, that's my mommy".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She spoke as though she was answering another
question from someone whom my wife couldn't see nor hear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, naturally, horrified my wife who
quickly looked up at the window, thinking some pervert was on the tree limb
which extended out over the restroom area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She saw no one, nor did she hear anyone shuffling about on the rooftop
of the restroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there was a
slight spring breeze, the leaves barely moved and all was still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was alone in the restroom with her
daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At this point, Aimee asked
her mom, "Mommy, don't you see him?", which made my wife even more
upset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without responding to her
daughter's question, she quickly had her daughter wash her hands and started to
lead her out of the restroom by the hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As they both approached the doorway out of the restroom, she and Aimee
glanced back toward that corner of the building with the window when Aimee
cheerfully said, "Bye!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
wife immediately looked over the tree as she left the restroom area and saw no
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were some people milling
around the area, but no one on the roof of the restroom building and no one in
the tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Definitely no one who was 7-8
feet tall was to be found anywhere in the park.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is when she quickly came to me and her son in our car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After hearing this, I
quickly became suspicious and drove by the restroom area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I parked my car and walked around the
restroom, thoroughly going over the grounds and examining the tree and
rooftop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no one around, except
children at this point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I returned
to the car, I asked Aimee who she was talking to in the restroom and she
replied, "The Man in the Window".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My wife was almost in tears at this point, so I decided to get us all
out of the park and headed home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">first off i thought i'd tell
you that i've had quite a few experiences through out my life but the one that
i remember the most is one that happened when i was around ten years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was visiting my dad at the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Ft.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mead</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Veterans</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType>
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Sturgis</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">S.D.</st1:State></st1:place>. I was with my mom and a close cousin
of mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went to see my dad on
the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>weekend and took him a picnic
lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after we arrived and found my dad
we went outside to find a spot to have our lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While my parents ate my cousin and I decided
to go play around the area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now the area
consists of buildings and old stables that were built back in the 1800's and
early 1900's .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is old barracks and
old stables, as well as newer buildings that make up the hospital itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any way while we were playing around one
building we kept hearing noises that sounded like people talking inside, but
after trying to look inside we found that the doors on all sides of the
building were locked with heavy steel locks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We tried reaching a window but they were all too tall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we gave up and decided to go eat bofore we
had to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way back to where my
parents were sitting we walked by another building and heard horses. I loved
horses and ran to my dad to tell him that they were there so he could take me
to see them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came with me back to the
building, he kept telling me that there was no horses there but i told him that
i heard them and so did my cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
still didn't believe him so he showed me by lifting me up to the window of the
building that i heard them in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Looking
inside I only saw boxes and boxes of stuff, no horses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He laughed at me and told me that there
hadn't been horses ther for a hundred years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After I got older I went back to the Veterans hospital I found a little
musuem and seen the buildings that i heard the people and horses and they were
last used in the late 1800's just like my dad told me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: kalinta2001@yahoo.ca <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello Shadowlands,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As a previous employee at
the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">banff</st1:place></st1:City>
springs hotel, I have seen many ghosts, and heard a lot about many stories from
the general manager, and other<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>coworkers..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As I do believe in ghosts..
they are out there. of course you know about Room 873.. the missing door.. and
the bride that fell and died on her wedding day, there were also some more..
that you don't know about..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was an older woman
that had cheated on her husband with an younger man, she had taken him to the
Banff Springs, and spent some time together when she was sleeping he had got in
her car, and drove off, never to been seen again, she woke up thinking he had
gone out for a bit, and when he never returned.. she knew that was the end..
she poured herself a cold bath.. and got in.. and killed herself.. she had been
rotting in the bathtub for a couple of days before the housekeeper came in..
she was pot bellied and her fingers and face were blue, and a reaking smell of
rotting flesh. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The housekeepers have seen
her once or twice..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the bathtub..
dead.. and then all of a sudden she opens her eyes.. and grabs you.. leaving
burn marks on your arms..as the coldness burns. this story was told around the
40's<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was a male student
that either was playing on his balcony, or drinking, he had fell to his
death<span style="">&nbsp; </span>about 6 floors up , and fell right
in front of the main doors.. he didn't survive. this was around the 50's<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The bellhop Sam, he is seen
every once in awhile.. he is very friendly.. and offers to take you up to your
desinated floor,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>though he had died<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in his elevator, what caused..the cable
snapped, he died instantly.. but he is still offering his services.. to the
hotel. say hello to sam..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he won't hurt
you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the president suite which is
on the top floors.. the largest of all the rooms. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is on the 9th floor, when the hotel was
held over by many managers and owners, during the 20's and 30's, the hotel had
mafia's in them. and they satyed in the president suite, which was named
something totally different than today.. I do not know the name back then, but
when the mafia's staed there. there was a lot of blood shed .. among and inside
the hotel one evening,.. a deal did not go good as expected.. and the men
upstairs in the suite were caught off guard, by other men with shot gun's
entering, there brains splattered everywhere, along the walls and the body
chopped up a bit more.. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There are many different
areas in the hotel used as jails, thats why you may seen rooms with blank white
doors, and a little window, and wired up..<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it use to be a jail. there are other rooms, that have been blocked off..
and you need to step up with a ladder to get into them. to know more please
email me back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The book the shining
fortells these stories which are very true and happened at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">banff</st1:place></st1:City> springs, even though it may not say
so.. the stories.. have fallen from ear to ear..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and passed on.. I find this amazing..
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>would love to go back to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">banff</st1:place></st1:City> springs at it's
finest..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to see, and hear.. and try to
picture what it was like.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Gaye and my story
is a good one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let me give you some
background first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a child, my family
and I would go up to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Morganton</st1:City>
 <st1:State w:st="on">NC</st1:State></st1:place> to visit my grandmother,
great-grandmother and great-grandfather.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all loved them very much and it was hard to see my great-grandfather
get sick and wither.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember when I
was vey young listening to Dixieland jazz with him. He died in 1972. When we
got the phone call, it seemed like I already new he was dead. I can't explain
why, but I just knew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
great-grandmother passed away many years later at the ripe old age of 100. We
all believe that papaw finally came and got her. ANyway, there is the
occasional time when I think that one of them comes to visit me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll be walking down the hall and pass a
pocket that has a distink smell to it. It is a smell I only associate with
their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I haven't experienced it in
awhile, maybe because we have moved again to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Florida</st1:place></st1:State>, but the smell has often followed me
and I think that they are just making sure I"m ok.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is my only story at this point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have always loved cars and
driving fast , for my last job I became a New York City Emergency Medical
Service Paramedic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What a job you get to
speed , run red lights and stop signs and use lights &amp; siren.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What's not to love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well I loved the job so much that when I got
hurt and my career ended I was devastated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I fell into a really bad depression.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One day driving to our
employee health service , out of the corner of my eye, I saw a 1940 Packard <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sedan</st1:place></st1:City> in a used car
lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hooked a u turn , never thinking
of missing my health service appointment, and stopped to see the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very badly worn and needed a lot of
work but just the way I felt got me thinking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told a friend I would start looking for a Packard and he told me his
Limousine Company could use an antique Cadillac.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Off we went in search of the holy grail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took almost a full year to find the
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went on a 24 hour road trip to
the western edge of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
to look at one car but it was the wrong series.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I found one near by that was the right
series and years but it needed a lot of work and it didn't feel right.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We continued to look when I
saw a tiny ad in an automotive hobby magazine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was just 2 or 3 lines and could easily be overlooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also in Con. , which is the next state
over and about an hour maybe an hour and a half away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt a strange calm on the way to look, not
sure if it was I was expecting to see the wrong series or year or what.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner or the garage gave me directions
and off I went.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room was full of
high buck restorations but this car just drew my eyes right to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a magnetic attraction despite the
$100,000 Pieerce Arrow next to her or the other high dollar cars near.&amp; sp;
I looked at the car and decided to road test it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All seemed in order but as I drove the area
of older , probably 1920s, houses I felt strangely at home almost deja vu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We went to transport the car
and that was a story of it's own but we finally got her home to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mount</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Pocono</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would stay at my friends while we rebuilt
her.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we finished the mechanical
restoration we would take trips out into the country side and his is where it
got strange.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On one trip, on a road I drove
many times, I felt a strange feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
wqas deja vu again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we traveled these
roads that look as roads looked in the early 1950s or so I felt I was back in
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cut off jeans and t shirt felt
like a suit and as I looked over at my friend , who was driving, I could have
sworn he was wearing a loose fitting suit and fedora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know he was wearing a ratty t shirt and old
jeans but I saw something different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was
somehow the car and we riders somehow tramsported back or was it my
imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A couple of months later I
was doing a Wedding and driving in the rain, at night not paying attention when
the car inb front of me stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
slammed the brakes on and I stopped as if I had a modern ABS braking system
despite the ancient technology.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the
former owner still watching over his car.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The former owner bought the car in 1949 and kept it till his death and
then the family gave it to a neighbor who for some strange reason sold it
relatively cheaply..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wonder if strange
things happened to him while he drove her the few miles he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I am behind the whel of the car I feel
totally relaxed almost too much so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wonder if the former owner is looking over me and maybe he likes me owning the
car he loved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It happened one night while
I was watching tv.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noah, my English
Springer Spaniel of 5 months old was happily chewing on his toys and jumping
around having fun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, he
made this strange noise so I turned around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had threw one of his bones into a corner in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was late at night, but everything was
lit up, and I didn't see anything in that corner so I was wondering what he was
making a big deal about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He backed up
towards me and made more strange noises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had never heard them before and I could tell he was really
scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like he was barking
through his nose, if that's possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
started howling and barking in earnest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's one thing if he's barking at the darkness
when we're outside taking a potty break, it's a whole other thing when he's
barking at a brightly lit corner in the tv room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to calm him down by showing him
nothing was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him to get his
bone but he wouldn't go near it so I reached over and grabbed it-nothing
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't feel any coldness or
anything out of place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My overactive
imagination thought my hand was going to be snatched up by some growling
monster but everything was fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I gave
the bone back to Noah and he seemed fine afterwards too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, what ever that was there was gone
because Noah didn't mind running around and into that corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning, I was telling my mom about
it and she said that many people believe dogs can see the dead and ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so freaked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everytime we go out at night for a potty
break before he goes to bed, I always look out into the darkness trying to see
something but nothing, and my heart usually goes into berserk mode when he
barks at the dark and runs towards the door with me usually running right
behind him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He he.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's my little story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not too scary but strange nonetheless.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well...I'm not sure that
these scattered experiences of mine even count as ghostly encounters or
not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some may have been sleep paralysis
or some other sleep disorder for all I know, but there are a few that I'm
unsure of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of these things occurred
in the home I grew up in, but not all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first and most vivid thing to happen was at that home, when I was
around 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was asleep and I woke up
abruptly for no apparent reason and immediately focus my eyes on what appeared
to be an elderly woman dusting my desk and a small table next to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She just moved about dusting away for a few
moments and eventually she slowly faded away and was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lay there dumbfounded by what I had just
seen and made sure that I was actually awake.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I realized that I was, you can imagine my shock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I screamed for my mother and she came in
shortly after and assured me that it was just a dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew the difference between a dream and
reality and that WAS no dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It really
wasn't too scary though, because the lady never seemed to even acknowledge my
being there, but it was a very disturbing thing for a 15 year old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had another experience not long after
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again I woke abruptly but this
time to the horror of a hand rubbing across my back and someone whispering
indiscernible gibberish into my ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
laid there frozen in fear wondering if this was actually happening as the hand
just slowly slid around on my back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
an instant I jumped up and looked around but there was nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No more whispering and no one in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also remember being totally filled with
dread during this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After these two
occurrences I h trouble sleeping for a while.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At times I would even end up in the floor of my mother's room because I
was so afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd also sometimes sleep
in my brother's room to have his company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After things seemed to calm dawn and I started to sleep in my own room
again with little fear I had another odd encounter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time I was sleeping on my back and again
I woke suddenly but this time I looked over to the floor and there in the floor
staring right back at me was a cat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was just sitting there kind of flopping it's tail around and just watching
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The thing is, we had no cat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't own any animals what so ever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just like with the elderly woman, the cat
slowly faded away until it was gone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This time I just laughed, because it seemed so silly after I thought
about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a few other experiences
but most of them I believe to have been a bout of sleep paralysis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They can be pretty creepy as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all I know all of these things could have
been just that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes when I think
about it.....I'm not so sure though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have a friend who lives in
an older home in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Fredericksburg</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">VA.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I visited her for one of our long chat
sessions and lunch at our favorite little place downtown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has no children, no cats and one dog
named Matilda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were getting ready
to head out for lunch she ran upstairs to get her shoes and I waited in the
entry way by myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Relaxed and in a
contented state of mind, I suddenly felt a distinct series of four taps on my
lower back just above my hip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I assumed
it was Matilda and turned to see what she was up to but there was no sweet
doggy face there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact there was no
thing and no one there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hollered
upstairs to my good friend, "Is Matilda up there with you?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She responded with a simple, "Yes,
why?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I said,"Has anyone
ever told you your house is haunted?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She squealed and said,"No. Why?" So I proceeded to tell her
about the taps on my back as she descended the steps with Matilda in tow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was pretty cool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have clairaudient, clairvoyant and other
psychic experiences on an irregular basis, usually when I am in a relaxed state
of mind however, this was the first time I've ever felt a physical contact of
any sort though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi! My name is Kimberly and
I live in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alabama</st1:place></st1:State>.
My family and I have always been very open to the idea of ghosts. We have had
more than our share of ghostly experiences and even have a few pictures too.
One of my stories was from years ago when I was about 9 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My older brother and I loved
each other but because of the 2 year age difference we used to fight all the
time. My grandaddy who was very dear to us and whom had died about a year
before this (but my brother was especially close to him) used to tell us all
the time that we should never go to bed angry at one another. That was one of
his rules that still sticks with me to this day. One night, we had a fight that
seemed huge at the time (it was probably over a toy or something ridiculous
like that) and my mom made us go to bed. I was lying in my bed and the only
light was the line under my door and the moonlight coming through my window. I
had been in the bed a short time and was still fuming from the fight. All of the
sudden I heard something say "hey!" in a real whispery voice. That
drew my at ntion to the foot of my bed and I saw a figure standing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldnt really make out any traits but I
knew it was a male figure. I started to panic. I couldnt move or speak all I
could do was pant. I was freaking out! Then I watched the figure move from the
end of my bed around to the side that I was laying on. It was then standing
over me. I swear I thought I was about to faint or something I was breathing so
hard. Then he rubbed my arm as if he were trying to comfort me. I cant really
explain how but it was then that I realized it was my grandaddy. I jumped up
and ran out the door crying. I told my mom and made her sleep with me for the
next week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: Weshott1@aol.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The only experience I ever
had was one I didn't realize I was having until I moved. Until I moved, I
thought what I was feeling was normal. When my father and step-mother married,
we moved into a house that had previously belonged to her brother. I was 7
years old at the time and all I knew about my step-mother's brother was that he
was dead, he had died of a "broken heart" at the age of 27. We
visited his grave when we visited my grandfather's grave every 6 months or so.
I never really gave him much thought. His old room was across from mine and I
avoided going in there. Sleep was something that never came easy for me,
either. My parents told me I used to have nightmares all the time. Before going
to sleep, I was constantly looking around for someone to pop out of the
shadows. Being alone in the house was always weird for me, it was like someone
was looking over my shoulder all the time, not in a menacing way, but more in a
curious way (looking back on it). Every Christmas my Grandmother and Uncle
would come stay with us and I would sleep in "his" room with my
Grandma and my uncle would sleep in my room, seeing as how my bed was a twin. I
never slept a wink in that room, once again, the feeling was one of "why
are you here?". One night, as I was drying my hair in my room, I was
thinking about "him" for some reason. All of a sudden, the lights
click off. I came rolling out of my room very quickly and "his" room
across the hall had lost power too. No other lights went out. Could be
explained away, I guess, it's just that it was strange because I never thought
about him. Well, we moved out when I was 15, and the new house was so strange
to me because I felt so comfortable there. No problems sleeping, no feelings of
being watched. My step-mother and I got to talking about him one day and she
told me the "real" way he had died: He commited suicide in the house
and laid there for 2 days before anyone had found him. He was in love with the
neighbor's daughter and she didn't like men (you know what I mean?) It was all
to much for him, he wanted so much to be with her and she didn't return his
affections in that way. (I'm not sure if he knew she was a lesbian or not). My
step-mother did tell me that when I was at my grand-parents house one weekend,
she and my dad were outside and she was walking my dog around the side of the
house. All of a sudden, Sassy, (my dog, sweetest black lab in the world)
stopped under one of the windows in "his" room. She got between my
step-mother and that window and growled and her hackled raised up and was
making the biggest fuss. My step-mother called to my dad and told him there
must be someone in the house because the way Sassy was carrying on (she never
barked or growled). Daddy went inside and looked around and said there was
nothing or no-one in the house. My step-mother went on to say that was the same
window " he " would stare out of for hours because it faced his
love's house and he could hope to catch a glimpse of her comings and goings. I
really hope that " he " has moved on to a better place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Second... Please publish my

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ghost or Entity ? <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well it&#8217;s not the first time
that I experience something supernatural, but this happened a couple of years
ago. It so happens that I used to be satanic and was in contact with evil
forces all the time. That week my older sister decided to play the wegee board
but we didn't have one so we made our own with a cardboard and a little round
mirror (now I'm talking about adults here) I was about 15 (I'm 21 now) my
sister was 26 with two kids and my brother 24, his wife 20... Anyway, we all
sat at the dinning table and my sis and I began to play first it would not move
at all and I said "well maybe it doesn't work" so I took my hands off
the mirror (I had drawn an arrow on it with black nail polish to point at the
letters); so my brother sits where I was and begins to play, so they ask the
board why I couldn't play and it says "NO", then they ask who was
talking and it said "Satan". By that time I could already sense a bad
smell in the house and a presence around us. I could see something like a
silhouette of a big person in a gas form (clear gas with gray and black tones)
that headed to the kitchen where my sis in law had gone with my niece (2 years
old, who I will call A) so I looked to the kitchen to see my in-law whit my
niece by the stove and the gas form all around them specially aroun A. I got up
from the chair and went to the kitchen, waved my hand through he gas form and
took A with me, telling my in-law S to be careful because<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there was something in the house trying to do
something to A in some way. I felt that A had a strange look in her eyes and I
knew there was part of the gas form in her or around us (today she is 8 and she
can see things and has dreams and stuff as I do). So back at the table my sis
and brother still playing ask the board why it does not want to talk to me and
it says " Luz " (that is my middle name, meaning light in English).
And they ask what?, so it says "She is the beginning of the end"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>freaking me out since my sis has always had
dreams about the end of the world (which freaks me out even more), soy I tell
them to ask if I will have kids and it answers "yes"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I don't want kids), so I say name the father
and it says "me" they ask who? And it replies "Satan" they
pushed the board towards my side of the table and we all started think about
the board, I never told my sis what I saw, only S knows. They started telling
me that I should go to church and quit Satanism (I did a couple of days after
when I had a "dream" in which I killed a couple in their room and
woke up to find my hands and clothes full of fresh blood {I was not in my days
of the month}) and continued a normal (atheist) life for the next three days...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will continue this story in the next few
days when I have more time and feel better for I have been a little sick these
last days. I can tell you that today I am a solitary practitioner of nocturnal
neo-paganism (dark-wicca) nothing evil at all. Thank you for reading my story
and I hope you read it all. Feel free to contact me (djinn0fire@hotmail.com
and/or darkpoet99@yahoo.com).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have another story about
the woods in which I grew up just down Highway T N/East of Newburg . I have
heard that it was know as Satans holler though i cannot find any historical
documentation. The name it is most commonly called is "Bakers Sluegh"
due to a long stretch of water cut off from the Little Piney by a stretch of
Fields. Our house is on the opposite side of the road from the
"Sluegh" and there are two small ponds and a larger lake . We own
some acres of the land and on the southern side we are bordered by <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mark</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Twain</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">National Forest</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. There
have been odd goings on for years here . Most witnessed by the locals who live
on this road. But it all seems centered around the old <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Bkers Place</st1:address></st1:Street> which is up a small hill
directly east and South of our property. There is also an unexplainable draft
of extremely cold air which blows down the lane which goes up to the house. The
lane is actually located in a small ravine , which opens up into a small valley
. Though this could explain some of the cooler air , the air that emmanates
from it is extremely cooler than most would think is <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Normal</st1:place></st1:City>. However , it isn't always so . But at
certain times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The road and woods itself
seem to also be haunted. Friends feel uneasy and fearful when getting out of
their cars at night. When we let the dogs out some nights, we feel a very eerie
and almost malevolent presence. My own mother said one night she saw red eyes
in the woods. These are only a few of the many experiences people have had .
These of course are personal or familial ones that i have re counted here. All
in All i would say that Newburg Mo. should also be included on your list of Haunted
Missouri.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>=)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My Dad and Mom made a trip
to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Charleston</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">SC</st1:State></st1:place> last year. My Mom is fascinated with old
cemeteries. While walking through one afternoon, a gloomy afternoon, my Dad
stopped in his tracks. He asked my Mom if she smelled the flowers, there were
NO FLOWERS anywhere, she could not smell anything. She asked my Dad if he was
ok, apparently he looked really dazed and confused, Dad replied that he just
had the strongest smell of carnations. It only lasted a few seconds. There had
been no recent funerals. He stopped and ask the tour guide about the smell, she
replied there had not been anyone funerals in the last 2 months. Freaking huh?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Also, I forgot to add that
my father's side of the family has the ability to see "things". One
of Grandmother's aunts had lost her baby at birth. One day was washing dishes
and had been grieving for the child she lost. She then begin to ask God to let
her see her baby one last time, she glanced up into the window above the kitchen
sink and there lay her baby that had died. She reached out to touch it and it
disappeared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A lot of other things has
happened. I do recall one that scared me half to death. I do believe in ghosts,
however I do not want to EVER see one or HEAR one. One morning I had spent the
night with my Grandma. My cousin &amp; I were to have a yard sale that morning.
I asked Granny to wake me between 5:00 &amp; 6:00. She woke up hearing me
talking, calling out her name, she got out of bed, walked to back bedroom were
I was sleeping, looked inside and I was fast asleep. When she woke me and asked
if I had been calling her, I told her no. Later that day the more she thought
about it, the more it sounded like my Great- Granny that had died in the early
80's. She always called her Mick. I NEVER CALL Granny Mick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To this day, I will not
sleep at her house. EVER!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I also will not sleep at my
Mom's house. It was built in 1901. She &amp; father have both been asleep and
awaken hearing voices and hearing picture frames falling and the glass
breaking. When they get up to inspect the picture frames, they are still on the
wall. Untouched!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">there are many hauntings
about this school you can basically talk to any one that goes there and they
can tell you stories. The janitors especially. One story that happened to me
and a freind we were walking past the cemetary in the middle of the campus and
we saw a man dressed in old cloths watching us we looked at eachother then
looked back at the man but when we turned back he wasnt there any more. A few
years ago two people were rehersing in our cafeteria and started to hear the
sound of some one cooking (this was late at night and nobody was there) all of
the sudden they heard noises of someone slaming pans and breaking plates all
over the floor then all at once they didnt smell the bacon and the sounds
stopped. almost right after the sounds stopped they heard the sound of someone
trying to get on the doors leading into the cafeteria the doors were locked. A
similar story happened to the cheerleaders who were there for camp they no
longer camp in the cafeteria. About 2 weeks ago we had a wrestling match well
the bus didnt get back till about 1 or 2 in the morning well the wrestling
coach was in his office and heard two people talking he went outside thinking
that some of his wrestler's rides had not shown up yet well when he walked
outside there was nobody there so he just walked back into his office. When he
got back he heard four voices which now sounded like they were fighting so he
ran outside and nobody was there. He then walked back inside ti gather his
things but as he was walkin to his car the voices started yelling for him to
come back talk alittle he turned around seeing nothing ran to his car and then
drove off. many people dont believe us and our stories but maybe you should
stop by and see for yourself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi. I just found your
website. I had a ghost in my house, not sure if it's still here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We moved in this house
almost 2 yrs ago. It's about 50 yrs old. No one died here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Last fall I started feeling
a presence, it was strongest in my bedroom and in a room in the basement. I saw
a whitish, what would I call it? apparition float across the livingroom one
day. I hear footsteps going across the floor. I was going to work at 5:15 one
morning. I went in the bedroom, kissed my husband, he said "see you
later". When I closed the bedroom door I heard someone mumble something. I
opened the door and asked my husband what he said, he said he didn't say
anything. I closed the door again and this time I heard a soft "I love
you" in my right ear. I freaked out, opened the bedroom door and told my
husband to quit doing that, he assured me he didn't do anything. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There's always noises in my
bedroom at night, little bumps and something that sounds like a tin can being
hit. My husband snores really bad so we don't sleep together. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One night the presence was
right in bed with me, it was pushing on me. I pushed back and said out loud
"what the hell is going on?" It stopped. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Last week the spirit came
right through my bedroom door and floating towards me. I closed me eyes, when I
opened them it was gone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A friend of ours deals with
spirits. He came here just last night. He found the ghost in the basement. He
said it is a very timid one, he tried to communicate with it and all he could
get out of it was that the ghost loves me, feels a bond with me and it waits
for me to come home from work. (?) He said it isn't an evil one, it's more
scared of us but it really likes me because I am intuitive and I see and feel
their presence. I've always been able to do this. My friend told it to leave,
that I am not available, etc. So I have to wait and see if it did leave. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I'm not really scared of it,
it's just kind of creepy at times when I feel a heavy presence, I know it's
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We had just bought this
house outside of rochell, Illinois in late june of 2005,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we have had strange things happen on and off
since that time we purchased the house,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the first thing that happened was my wife and a friend of her&#8217;s were
painting the living room and when they got done I was sitting on the couch looking
at the paint job when I told them they needed to come to the living room and
look at this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There where they had just
painted you could see the outline of a human body, we had many people cpme over
and see it and they all agreed it looked like a human figure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have also had a scoop used to clean cat
litter get thrown off things and moved from one side of the litter box to the
next.. The last thing that had happened was my wife and I were the only ones
here and we had our dog locked in his kennel in the front hallway, my wife nad
I both heard a loud knocking on the door going from the kitchen to the front
hallway, we figured that maybe someone had come in and we didn&#8217;t hear them so I
got up to check the door and there was no one there and the front door was
locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We live in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Belvidere</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">IL</st1:State></st1:place>.
Our bottom of our house was built in the 1920's, it was a old farm house. We
have 2 ghosts in our house, one is a girl ghost between 10-12. The 2nd ghost is
a man ghost who may or may not have a relationship to the girl. The little girl
ghost has long wavy, or curly brown hair down to her shoulders. The man ghost
is wearing a trench coat and hangs out mainly in the kitchen. The man ghost
once just lit a lighter in the middle of the kitchen, then blew it out. My son
has seen him a many of times, and is sensitive to them. The girl ghost seems to
like my son a lot, and protects him. We have had people in the house that have
seen her lying by him and covering him up with a blanket. We accept these
spirits in our house and they accept us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A short story for you Tina
about <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Garden Grove</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">CA</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My family lived in a house in GG in the late fifties/early sixties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Numerous folks in my family felt the house to
have spirits/ghosts of sorts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was too
young to really remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>about six years ago, my brother, living in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Riverside</st1:place></st1:City>, saw a TV show
on super natural things, and he says a house, looking just like our GG house,
was shown, and described to be haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, about 1999, I actually visited the house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Garden Grove</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">CA</st1:State></st1:place>
on a Sunday afternoon, just to see by chance what the current owners had to
say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt pretty stupid walking up to
their door, how do you start a conversation like that about ghosts to a
stranger. But, what the heck, I figured the worst thing that could happen was
they would call me crazy (asking about ghosts), and it would still be a good
story to relate to my family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The visit
was interesting though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had moved
from the property about 1962, but the man who met me at the door knew my last
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not seem pleased with my
visit, and stated there were no spirits in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did say this<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I have cleared houses before, and there is
nothing here&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seemed odd to me that a
self proclaimed ghost buster just happened to live in our old house ( I had
never met a ghost buster before).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">And here it is....<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Emily and I am
now currently 22. Here are the experiences that both me and my Mother have had
in our old townhome. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We moved to a townhome when
I was about 3 years old from an apartment. I don't recall anything spooky
happening back then but my Mother tells me that when I was at that age that I
would complain that someone was always touching the top of my head constantly.
Moving forward a few years. When I was about 14 or 15 my Mother had an
experience in one of our upstairs bedrooms. She told me she was lying in bed
one night very depressed because of money problems she was having when all of
the sudden she felt something wrapped around her like something was hugging her
and wouldnt let go. She told me that she said a few "our fathers" and
a few "hail Mary's" and whatever it was stopped. She said she wasnt scared
when it happened it just felt like whatever it was wanted to confort her. Also
we had weird things happen in our house. We would see dark things out of the
corners of our eyes, our stero would turn on and off when the remote was clear
across the room with no bateries in it. One day I remember coming home from
school and the t.v in my room was on. (My room was now my Mothers old room, due
to my Stepfather moving in with us.) I had not had the t.v on the night before
or in the morning when I woke up to get ready for school. Also back to my
mothers experience. She was speaking on the phone to one of her friends and
tried to tell them about what was happening in our house. The moment she
started to talk about it, the phone cut off competely. She called her friend
back and tried to explain it again thinking that it was just the batery on the
phone going dead. When she tried to tell her again for the 2nd time the phone
cut off again. My Mother said she left the house after the second time and
didnt come back till she knew when I would be home. I also had an experience
simular to my Mother's. I was lying in my bed at night in one of those half
asleep half awake states when I all of the sudden felt an extreme amount of
preasure on my back as if someone were laying ontop of me. By now I was
competely awake. I tried to get up and it pushed me back down smuthering me in
my pillow. I remember thinking in my head..."stop you're going to
sufficate me." I also remember my Mother saying she said the "our
father's" and "hail Mary's" and it went away. So I started to
say them also and it went away. I was so scared that I couldnt even call out to
my Mother or Stepfather so I started banging loudly on my headboard hoping that
one of them would wake up and hear me. My Stepfather came in my room and said
"What's going on in here" I immediately starting crying and told him
to get My Mom. My Mother came in my room and I made her sleep in my bed with
me. My bed is an antique from the 1920's. My Grandmother got it for my Mother
from a lady who had died in it. (I found this out as I was older and didn't own
it anymore...thank god!) To this day I believe it was that Woman trying to get
me to get out of her bed. She didnt like me but I assume she liked my Mother
since she gave her a hug.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My house has an Indian gohst
that migrates through the house every spring and fall. I see his legs amd
moccocins as he passes through. I have had many such ecperineces but I am not
frightend by them because I am open to them. Mostly I find comfort in the fact
that for some reason I am allowed to see thes things. When I lived in Pocatello
I had a woman spirit in my house who must have worn Lilac or lavender perfume
when she was a mortal because I could smell her scent daily at certian times
and I would usually wake up to her scent and the smell of toast cooking. She
was very active and the house is on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Benton
  street</st1:address></st1:Street>. Upon my own investigation I learned; A
lady died there who used to be a fortune teller and her name was Mrs.
Armstrong. I don't remember when she dired but I think it must have been in the
70's or late 60's. My Aunt Mary Lagos who lives down the alley and on S. Arthur
remembers her. Like I said I have been having experiences with spirits since I
was very little and still continue to have them and I love when it happens. I

a strong odor. the cologne my grandpa used to wear.noone in the house owned any
but i smelled it as if he were standing next to me. i turned around and nothing
was there.the smell had even left. i ran screaming to my mom but she didnt
believe me! well years later when the only signs of a presence were gusts of
cold wind in a heated room and that smell i had another experience.two friends
of mine and i were in my room and we heard a blood curdling scream we went to
investigate but nothing my brother was asleep and my dad was asleep.nothing.so
we brushed it off as our imagination but we heard it again! they went home
crying and havent slept over since.that was about maybe 5 years ago.a week
later i went to summer camp which lasted for a week.when i came home my arrival
of what was supposed to be relaxing and being with friends was abruptly thrown
away with the news of the death of 2 of my cousins, they were murdered in their
sleep.when i thought back on the screams from 2 weeks before they sounded like
a girl about my cousin's age.since then ive blamed her death on my own faulting
becuase i was going to try and invite her to camp with me but i put it off
until it became too late.well soon after their deaths i noticed more things
happening.things being missplaced.turning up as if never been moved.her parents
even told me the earrings she borrowed from her grandmother, were missing.they
had been put in a jewelry box but came up missing.soon after one was found in
her sisters room who was born 2 years after her and her brothers death.the
other on her grandmothers nightstand. we all marked it as a sign of her telling
us she was still here.well again tragedy marked our family and my other cousin
was taken under God's wing.he was in a car crash and died of cardiac arrest.
while my family was in the hospital i stayed home because i was very close to
him and i didnt want to see him in that shape.i didnt want to be alone so i let
my dog in.He's a german shepard full grown.he never was scared of anything but
as i sat in my chair with him at my feet staring at a wall, he began to
whimper.his hair stuck up on ends and he never took his eye off of whatever it
was in the room.he began to turn his head as if it were moving and he was
following it.that was one of my only signs that i believed to be of my
cousin.in this house.about 3 years after his death, he never liked this one
friend of mine, well he began to hang out with my older brother until they
werent allowed to hang out because they always found a way to get into
trouble.well he called me and said he was drunk and wanted a ciggarrette and
wasn't going home until he got one.i kept telling him to go home before he got
into a wreck but he refused so i told him to come over to the house.he did and
i gave him a cig.we were in the garage which is connected to my kitchen by a door.we
had the door open and 2 of my friends were sitting on the step between the
kitchen and garage.we heard something slam down on the counter like a smack but
instead of a smack noise a loud boom.well needless to say the boy left scared
out of his wits when my two friends told me noone has been in the kitchen the
whole time.they had been in the doorway so i know they didnt do it.well after
he left we were in the kitchen sittingon the counter becuase by then most of my
friends were well aware of stange occurences.we heard footsteps on the linoleum
in front of us!well we got out of there and went to my friends house.that
summer, i had a sleep over.me and my friend were laying on the couch and two
others on the floor.my friend on the couch told me the next morning said she
had seen a dark shadow standing by the fire place.the same area my grandfather
had died in.she said he was about 6 foot , husky and appeared to be wearing a
limp top hat.like a fisherman hat.the same discription i always remembered my
grandfather to be. so when i told her that where she had seen him was where my
grandfather had passed she hasnt slept over.she visits but doesnt stay the
night.but on her last time that she has ever come over, we had heard a rumor
that if you turn your tv off and take a picture of it if something shows up
then your house is more than likely haunted.as dumb as we were, we did it.i got
my digital camera out we turned the tv off (the screen was on the dvd screen
when no movie is in which is all blue blocks) we stood at an angle and took the
picture.the flash had taken up the whole screen.well we stood at a different
angle and took it and sure enough there was a face.a glaring face staring
straight foward.a face i had never seen.you could make out a beard nostrils his
eyes and eye brows.but just barely his lips.that was my last ghostly experience
in this house of mine.BUT at my grandmothers.which is a new house after my
cousin died(the last one) i believe about 3 years my nephew was born.he wasnt
old enough to crawl just yet but he'd lie there on his back on a blanket and
kick.he didnt kick tho unless he was excited.i was catching up on coffee when i
noticed alex staring at the couch.brushing it off i just stared at him because
he always amazes me. when i noticed he had gotten the biggest grin on his face
as if something was making him giggle.freaked out i kept watching as alex began
kicking his legs profusly!and then reached his arms out towards the couch like
he would if he wanted you to hold him. my cousin and i always used to joke
about how my brother would never settle down get married and have a child,
sadly my cousin never got to see the day that my brother would settle down and
sure enough have a kid. in my heart i do believe that was chris making alex
smile.making alex kick his legs like he was and reaching his arms out.those are
the most of my experiences with the paranormal.like i said, theyre not scary,
maybe even not that interesting but i just wanted to speak my mind on it
because so many other people have dealt with it and would may like to hear my
story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By:
bloodispouring_18@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Maybe it is nothing but here
are a few things I have seen or believed to have seen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first thing I remeber
happening is very small. It was when i was about 3 or 4. I was playing around
in my house, and I was going to climb up the stairs. From the bottom, I looked
up and I saw a cat at the top. I never had cats when i was little because my
sister was allergic. I knew it didn't belong there. Being little, it didn't
bother me that it normally wasn't in my house. My mother told me about a year
ago that she saw a black cat the day I was born. I'm not sure if she saw it in
our house or not, but it had upset her. It may be nothing though. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was one time, when I was 3 years old,
when my sister and her friend Paige were babysitting me. I had fallen asleep on
the couch downstairs, and they were upstairs in her room with the door closed.
There was a scratching on the door. Nothing unusual since our dog Molly does
that when she wants to come into a room. They opened the door, and she wasn't
there, so they closed it and kept doing whatever it was they were doing. A
while later, the scratching was there again they opened the door and she was
not there. They wondered how she could walk away that fast since they opened it
as she was scratching, and there were no open doors near by that she could have
entered. They searched the house for her and could not find her. They had not
let her out earlier but they checked outside anyways. no sign. They were scared
but went back to my sisters room. Soon, the scratching came again. They opened
the door and nothing again. They searched the house once more. Every single
room. even the ones we dont use. No sign. They got a knife out of the kitchen
for some reason because they were scared and went back to my isters room
frightened. They soon realized that I was downstairs and they came to get me
and brought me back up with them, but soon when the scratching came, Molly was
actually there when they opened the door. Where could she have been? Maybe the
story is nothing but it is odd to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We used to use a woodstove
to heat our house, and a lot of the time me and my sister had to start up the
fire in it to have heat. I was about five or six at the time. We went down into
the basement and tried to light the fire. No matter what we did, it wouldn't
light. I grew impatient and started to get whiney and bratty like kids do. My
sister got mad at me and called me a little demon. At that exact moment, the
fire flared into action. It freaked us out, so we closed the woodstove door and
ran up the basement stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The basement always did
scare me. We don't go down there anymore, but my mom used to work down there,
and i had to stay with her down there when I was really little so I wouldn't be
alone upstairs. Our house is really old and our basement walls are made out of
stone. and it's really dirty and old. Behind the woodstove is a wall, and there
is a little room behind it. In the back of it, there is a big gaping hole in
the wall. I never knew what it was, but it scared the hell out of me when i was
little. Well actually when I was little, I was scared of it, but i was also
interested by it. I would often stare at it unable to move. Now I don't dare go
down there. I dont even know what the hole is or what is in it. All you can see
in it is darkness. I'm glad we don't go down there anymore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The last thing I have to
tell about is probably nothing, but once a few months ago, i was sitting on my
bed writing, and my dog was at my feet sleeping. All of a sudden. she lifts her
head and her ears perk up. She jumps off my bed and starts barking loudly. She
was staring at my open closet and baring her teeth. She was so wild and I
didn't know what was going on. There was nothing in my oset that I could see,
but I was scared so i ran downstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first car I bought on my
own was a 1972 MG Midget.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wa working
as a mechanic and I loved the sports cars with convertible tops so I went out
looking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I bought a nice relatively low
mileage expample.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time this
happened it went in my mind as mere coincidence the second and third etc are
the ones that spooked me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was driving my cousin and
the day was my birthday party so the family was over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car felt fine and handled like on
rails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rolling Stones Song<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Sympathy For The Devil" came on
the radio and since I like it I sang along.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went to make a left trun and as soon as I finished the lower controll
arm broke sending me into a tight left turn.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I towed the car home and started the repair, it was a common problem
with these cars and parts were easy to get so no biggie.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I saw the brake hose showed rubbing so I
replaced it too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I finished the repair up and
used the car for a couple of months and then one day while driving that song
came on again, I sang along and then<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
saw the car in front of me stop , I hit the brakes and the new hose broke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a pinhole just snapped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I missed almost everything but clipped a
telephone pole [in front of me wewre iron pipes filled with cement so clipping
the pole would do the least damage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again I went home and fixed her not putting 2 and 2 together yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A week or so later I was
waiting for my team mates for the bowling league at the bowling alley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was parked in front with the top down and
listening to the music.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a cloud in
the sky but I started getting static.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Guess what song was on the radio ...Sympathy For The Devil.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next thing I knew the passenger
compartment filled with smoke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a
major electrical fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got the car
home and started to again work on the car, I worked on it about 1 hour for each
hour of use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While working on electrical
I always kept an open fire extinguisher near by, all I would have to do is
squeeze it to use.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was putting in the
last few screws and as I reached for a screwdriver I hit the extinguisher and
it went all over, white powder everywhere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yes Sympathy for the Devil was ont he radio.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I liked the song but this was getting too
much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I has many further examples of
this song and dis aster but only on or in my MG.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still go into a sweat when I hear that song
go on and yes I still love the song but to this day I wonder if it was the song
or coincidence.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All told I had about 10
major incidents from electrical fires to parts breaking to freak transmission
failures and they were all preluded by the sound of Mick Jagger and the Rolling
Stones song Sympathy For The Devil.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">it was almost a month after
i moved into the doublestory house when i started hearing and smelling strange
things. One night i was asleep in my bed when i was woken up by a small boy
tapping my shoulder. it took me a while to make out what he was saying as i was
half asleep and he was so small his words were limited. i rubbed my eyes and
heard him again this time there was no doubt about it. he was crying ''mummy!
mummy! hot! hot!'' I sat up and smelt smoke and burning wood and plaster. i jumped
out of bed and ran to the door to see what was happening. But as i looked out i
saw that my house was fine everything was in place. I turned around at the
sound of coughing but the little boy was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After doing some research on
the internet i found that the house in which i now lived was built on the sight
of a small cottage that burnt down more tahn twenty years ago. thinking back i
remembered reading about it in the newspaper. The memory was vague but i did
remember reading that a two year old boy and his mother had been sleeping in
the bedroom where the fire had started. They had been unable to escape and they
both perished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For the next few months
after reading this i waited up late at night hoping to see the little boy again
but i never did. i moved out two years later but i kept in contact with my old
neighbors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Roughly three years after i
got a call from the lady who used to live next door to me she told me that the
peple who had moved in to my old house had come to her asking if the person who
lived in it before them (me) had seen or heard anything strange. two days after
that call i returned to my old house and met the new family who now lived in
it. We talked about the strange happenings until almost midnight. Suddenly the
youngest girl in the family came running in she told us that the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>bedroom was on fire and a little boy was
crying in there and that she tried to get him out but he hand went straight
through him.''I think he's a ghost'' she whispered to me. We all ran into the
bedroom but there was no sign of the little boy or the fire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The last i heard of that
family they moved out (they deny that it was because of the hauntings but i
know different)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i plan to return to that
house soon but i haven't had time recently. i plan to write a book on hauntings
but haven't got round to that either. its hard when your chasing ghosts all the
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About a year ago i was
taking a nap in my bedroom, and had this terrifying nightmare.When i woke up, i
laid in my bed for about 2 minutes calming myself down from the dream (it was
that scary). I sat up after a bit and looked over into my closet (my closet was
right next to my bed) and saw a man standing there. He wasnt in full form but i
saw his perfect outline so clear. He wasnt scary but i could tell he was really
sad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Just recently my two year
old son was jumping on the bed while me and my husband were laying down talking
one morning. While he was jumping he looked over at the closet(we had our room
rearranged to where we can see the closet for accross the room) and stops and
lays down on me. I didnt think anything of it and i get up to get him a diaper
by the closet. As im bending over to get it my son says "Guy in the closet
Mommy." I quickly leave the room to go tell my husband<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I never seen him since that
one time almost a year ago, but apparently my son sees him every night ( he has
his bed in the room with us). Almost every morining my son points him out to
me, i never see him when he does, and every night he sleeps with the closet
door shut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am so glad to find a place
where I can share some of the things that have happened to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About five years ago, I was
living in a house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Newberrytown</st1:City>,<st1:State w:st="on">PA</st1:State></st1:place> I was taking my daughter back to our for
a nap. As I came through the door backwards, I did not sense anything. But as I
walked across the room to put her in the crib, I started to feel this cold
tingly energy in the air. So I looked over where my dresser was right next to
the window. Now the window has black tint on it no light in, no light out. So I
looked over to the dresser, and there was a short man standing there!! The room
was pitch black and I could see him. He was about 5' 7" and I could not
see a clear face, but you could see where everything should have been. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">So I stood there and looked
at him and he looked right at me and he stayed there until I
screamed,"Randy I just saw a f*ck*ng ghost!!" So he said,"I know
I saw him too."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just lay down he
will go away. We couldn't see him any more but we could feel him. Things always
disappeared too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Till this day, We have
a lunch box that vanished off of our counter was gone for six months, and
reappeared in the same spot it was when it disappeared, with no lid! Imagine
that. What the heck does he need a lid for? Don't know but he took it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We named him Henry and I would talk to him
every day. I think it helped keep him calm because after I started to talk to
him I only saw him two more times before I moved out of there and I still think
about that until this day. Ever since then I have seen and heard so many things
that I think I am more sensitive to them than other people. The house that I
live in now has an old man here. He shakes our bed, and when I am in the basement
he stands back in the same corner and he watches me . Sometimes I sense him so
strongly that he makes me cry. But I have yet to see him. I'm sure I will
before I move out of here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I want to tell you a story about
my sisters house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have yet to
experience what I am about to tell you.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My sister has told me about hearing whistling in her home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whistling usually is coming from upstairs
or in another room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She typically would
shrug it off as her husband or children doing the whistling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also says her TV in her room upstairs
would turn on by it's self.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>AT first she
figured she had not shut it off like she thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she started hearing people talking from
her bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, like most of us would
think she thought she left her TV on again but when she went upstairs to turn
it off, it wasn't on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After time she
realized that this was all kind of weird and she started making a point to pay
better attention and making note of when she turned her TV off. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Well, you guessed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It WAS turning on by it self. And she was
hearing people talking from upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, back to the whistling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
started hearing it when she was home alone or when her youngest daughter was in
the room with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She called me one day
to see if I could maybe hear it over the phone, but it stopped as soon as she
called me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(It's like it knows!)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My 5 year old daughter spends a lot of time
at my sisters so I asked her if she ever heard anyone whistling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said ''YES!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who is whistling all the time mom? I can't
figure it out because we are all together watching a movie.''<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On another occasion my sister was hearing
the whistling again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is used to it
at this point so she didn't think much of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then her 3 year old blurted out ''MOM!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stop whistling!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- My
sister was relieved because she knew she wasn't crazy and that her kids hear
the whistler also.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have yet to hear
the Whistler, but I can't wait!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just
hope I'm not there by my self! ;o)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

family and i allways get funny looks when we tell our story about the two
houses we lived in . it was about 19 to 20 years ago we movied into a house in
rusellville ohio.it was a old house not sure how old it was just startting to
turn cold . our first night there we was all sitting down stairs when we heard
a sound like someone was moving are beds around upstairs we go up stairs and
nothing was touched.this keep going on the whole time we was living there. then
when winter hit this house was the coldes house.nothing we did to heat it up
would work. so we brought a barn heater in still felt like as if we was
standing out side in the cold. then we could be getting ready to leave and have
every thing turned off . the smell of candle wax would fill the living room.
but like i said nothing was turned on. it was only in this room we could smell
it. affter that winter we moved out.into another house in the same town but on
the other side.it to was a old house . the store to this house was in the olden
days the kkk would hang people in this house in the stair way we wasnt told
this intill we moved in. we had a small family dog in the house.this dog we
named lady would go upstairs to my bedroom door way she wouldnt go in just sit
in the door way where she would brak and grawl all day and night.i was just a
little girl so seeing this i<span style="">&nbsp; </span>wouldnt
sleep in my room.when winter came my room was all was cold just like the house
before. but in this house you had to go threw my room to get to my brothers
room .their room would be nice and warm be what made this weird was this house
was heated by a wood stove the regaster to let the heat come upstairs was in my
room right above the woodstove.all the other rooms was warm but mine. the dog
lady would still sit out side my room do and bark and grawl.so one day my
brouthers picked up the dog and tossed her into my room that poor dog came out
running and crying when she was out she turned right around and started
grawling agin.needless to say once agin affter the winter was over we moved out
but the last day of moving out of that house .we was all standing in the
hallway just talking at the bottom of the stairway when we heard foot steps
coming down the steps we couldnt see nothing but when the footsteps reached us
we all felt a cool gust of air hit us and when that happend we all looked at
one another didnt say a word we knew it was time to leave and that was the last
time we was ever in that house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
