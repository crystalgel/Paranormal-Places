<b>Bad Luck House</b>
<p><b>By: charlihorse2@home.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This is about the house my family lived in for about 3 1/2 years.&nbsp;
We left that house in the summer of 1977, and good&nbsp; riddance.&nbsp;
The house had a feeling about it that made you not want to stay there if
you were alone, and from the start, our family had constant bad luck.&nbsp;
Job loss, constant arguments and fights between family members, accidents,
neighbors seeing people looking out of windows at a time when we were all
somewhere else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My brothers and sister had two dogs at
the time; a doberman and a cockerspaniel.&nbsp; Those dogs would go crazy
over nothing we could see. When my boyfriend, who was abusive,</b>
<br><b>and I, started having violent fights, I was given permission to
come back home, as I had two small children ( I was twenty years old at
the time and had my own apartment).&nbsp; All I know is that the atmosphere
in that house was oppressive and it affected everyone there in a very negative
way.&nbsp; Things began to escalate when my brother started hanging out
with new friends of his in the neighborhood who took anything from their
father's black bag (he was a doctor) they could find to get high.&nbsp;
My brother was always a practical joker, but he was never cruel.&nbsp;
That changed.&nbsp; This is the same brother, by the way,</b>
<br><b>from my previous story (now we know why my aunt looked at him with
sadness).&nbsp; Anyway, he began to blaspheme God during his arguments
with my mother and stepfather, and to this day I believe this is when things
began to get worse.&nbsp; My brother's</b>
<br><b>hobby is drawing, and he had made a lot of posters to hang on his
bedroom walls on the third floor.&nbsp; After a while, he became afraid
to stay in his room unless someone stayed up there with him, because he
said his pictures were talking to him. Naturally, we wanted to know what
he was smoking, and we laughed at him.&nbsp; One night, he was ranting
in his room as usual,&nbsp; when we heard someone else up there with him.&nbsp;
Many someones.&nbsp; We believed him after that.&nbsp; So many things happened
in that house that if I were an outsider looking in I would have thought
that we were just having extremely bad luck, but now, after having read
some of the experiences of Ed and Lorraine Warren, and the encounters of
the people who submitted stories on this site, (including your own story)
I am sure it was something much worse than that.&nbsp; We finally left
that house after my</b>
<br><b>family was almost torn apart.&nbsp; I felt like we were leaving
a war zone.&nbsp; It has been 24 years since then and although I live close
to that house I have never been there to ask any of the people who have
lived there if perhaps they experienced the same thing.&nbsp; I really
would like to know, so maybe I will one day.&nbsp; I would like to add
that although I have been to many sites such as this I have never seen
a lot of stories from the Pittsburgh area in Pennsylvania, where this house
is located. I have had many strange experiences, not only from places where
I lived while growing up, but a few I've lived in since then.</b>
<br><b>Again, thanks for listening.</b>

<br><b>GHOST</b>
<p><b>By: wiresan@pivot.net</b>
<p><b>I was staying overnight at my uncles house one night, I was getting
something out of the fridge and I close the door and I saw a figure of
woman walking away from me, my uncle was in the bathroom at the time. (His
wife died a long time ago.)</b>
<br><b>I never met her, but I sure did that night. My uncle's dog, Sheba
was walking next to the "GHOST": Theresa and it looked like Theresa was
petting her on the back.</b>
<br><b>Here's my other story: My sister died when she was only 8 mos. old,
she died in our old apartment and I was visiting a friend that lives there
now and she has a shog rug in the middle of the floor and her glass coffee
table is on it, well I going to sit down and I tripped on the rug and heading
for the glass table and all of a sudden I was thrown in a nearby chair
by an invisible force. my friends were shocked cause they the whole thing.
I would have been killed if I hit the table, I guess my sister thought
I should live because my parents would have been grief stricken if I died
because they already lost a daughter and they couldn't afford to lose another
daughter.</b>

<p><b>The House</b>
<p><b>A bunch of friends decide to get a small, inexpensive house to hang
out in.</b>
<br><b>They find a two story, good sized house for an unbelievably low
price. The</b>
<br><b>salesperson gives them a map of the house. They go in and take a
look around</b>
<br><b>and find a door that isn't on the map. They open it and</b>
<br><b>see..........nothing.</b>
<br><b>They think it just has no windows. They go down to tell the salesperson</b>
<br><b>about</b>
<br><b>the mysterious room. They go back up to find the door no longer
there. The</b>
<br><b>salesperson tells them what he didn't tell them before. A lady had
commited</b>
<br><b>suicide in the room. Her life had gone completely out of control.
She had</b>
<br><b>hung herself. The people trying to sell the house had the room removed
to</b>
<br><b>sell it, but it still appeared on it's own.</b>
<p><b>Death Angel?</b>
<p><b>A friend of my mom's was in the hospital for a tumor in her head.
She had it</b>
<br><b>removed and had to stay to recovered. When she was in the bed at
night,</b>
<br><b>trying to sleep, a figure in black, or rather, a black figure, came
to her.</b>
<br><b>It was tall, shaped like a man, and had a thing in it's hand. The
thing was</b>
<br><b>glinting, and it looked like metal. The figure came every night.
It also got</b>
<br><b>closer every night. She was scared of it.When it was right at the
end of her</b>
<br><b>bed, she told it to leave her alone. It did. After wards, she recovered</b>
<br><b>fully and thought it was the death angel coming for her.</b>

<br><b>Aunt at Peace</b>
<p><b>By: wpiii1@home.com ghost encounter</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I have been reading the stories on your sight for a while, and I
have finally decided to share one of my own.&nbsp; The very&nbsp; first
ghost I can remember seeing happened when I was a toddler. ( I am the one
in my family everyone uses for verification</b>
<br><b>of when something happened, as my memory goes back far)&nbsp; Anyway,
I am the oldest of seven children, but at this time there was just myself
and the brother after me ,and we are very close in age.&nbsp; This particular
night I was lying in my crib looking around , when I saw a woman come into
the bedroom.&nbsp; She was tall with long, wavy black hair and she was
very pretty.&nbsp; She came and stood by the crib for a moment and smiled
at me, then left.&nbsp; I don't remember anything after that so I must
have fallen asleep.&nbsp; It wasn't until years later (in my twenties)
when my family and I were talking about the various</b>
<br><b>experiences we had in some of the houses we lived in while growing
up.&nbsp; My sister had heard this story several times, but I had never
told my mother.&nbsp; As I told the story my mother gave me the strangest
look and when I was done, she shook her head.&nbsp; "You couldn't possibly
know that, you were just a baby!"&nbsp; I asked her what she meant and
this is what she told me:&nbsp; My father and his sister were the only
surviving children of my grandparents, as three of their children died
in infancy.&nbsp; They were very close and when my aunt died, at twenty-five,
in a fatal car accident my father was devastated.&nbsp; Every night, before
he went to bed, he would write a letter to his sister telling her how much
he missed her and how terrible it was for him that she was no longer alive.&nbsp;
He would put this letter in an envelope and place it on top of the television
and then go to bed.&nbsp; One night, my mother says, she was lying in bed
with my father and my then baby brother (who was very sick for most of
his childhood and had to have a colostomy at the age of two), trying to
go back to sleep as she had been up with my brother.&nbsp; She says she
was turned toward the door and was settling down when she saw a woman,
dressed in white come into the bedroom.&nbsp; The woman walked over to
the crib where I was, bent down and smiled at me.&nbsp; She then proceeded
to the side of the bed where my father slept.&nbsp; My mother says the
woman didn't pay any attention to her, but she looked at my brother with
the saddest expression she had ever seen, which made her afraid.&nbsp;
All this time she was trying to wake my father, but he just would not wake
up.&nbsp; The woman looked at</b>
<br><b>my father for a moment, and then she slapped him in the face.&nbsp;
It was then that my mother realized that the woman she was staring at was
her deceased sister-in-law.&nbsp; My father frowned in his sleep as my
aunt talked to him, but he still did not wake up.&nbsp; My mother says
that my aunt told him how sad it made her that he could not get over her
leaving.&nbsp; She did not want him to write any more letters to her and
she was fine, so he was not to grieve, as his sadness kept her from being
at peace.&nbsp; Then, she walked around the bed and went out the door.&nbsp;
It took my mother a while to get to sleep, but she finally did.&nbsp; She
waited all day for a way to tell my father what she had seen, but she was
afraid he would laugh at her, so she said nothing.&nbsp; At bedtime, though,
she noticed that the usual letter was not on the television and when she
asked him why, he told her that he dreamed he talked to his sister and
she asked him not to, and that she had slapped him.&nbsp; He said the dream
was so real, it was as if she was really there.&nbsp; It was then that
she told him what she saw.When I asked my mother why she never told me
she said that whenever we would see things the grandmothers thought it
best that they just shrug it off so as not to scare us.&nbsp; They had
already experienced many of the things that we had.I am sorry for the length
of this story, but I just had to tell it to someone besides family.&nbsp;
Thanks for listening.</b>

<br><b>Hallways (Bleh) heh</b>

<p><b>I just read your story of when you saw the "figures" in your house

you i had a bed that made made me sleep looking down the hallway. But first
let me give you a description of my</b>
<br><b>house (acctually a trailor). Ok its a normal trailor kitchen to
the left and the living room about in the middleof the trailor then on
the far right was the hallway youd walk about 4-5 feet and to the left
was my moms room then about 7-8 ft was the back door (Right) and bathroom
(left) and my bedrrom was straight ahead. well me and mt sister had bunk
beds and i always slept where i would peer down the hallway. Well when
i went to bed i always stared at the hall and saw these red little men
if you will and theyd jump around and jump in my mom and dads room and
then just peer out and stare at me but</b>
<br><b>they wouldnt come in my room except one. But it was different then
the others it was bigger kind of built and blue and it would come in my
room stare at me for a few minutes then pick up my things and throw them
and laugh like it was playing with</b>
<br><b>them and i was skared at that time and would hide under the covers
or yell for mom or dad and theyd dissapear. But there was this night when
my dad was sleeping with me becouse i was scared and i looked down the
hall and saw this huge black</b>
<br><b>thing it was like a cloke or something with a hood and had a big
Skythe (something u cut wheat with long wooden handle and a large slanted
blade) and it kind of resembled the Grim Reaper. But now weve moved then
my aunt lived there for awhile but</b>
<br><b>didnt see or suspect anything supernatural. My parents said it was
my eyes but i had recordings of when i got a talk boy (Home Alone 3 lost
in new york). and its of then like laughing and throwing things but i played
it alone and it was perfect</b>
<br><b>you could hear it plainly and everything but when i showed it to
anyone else all you heard was static then the tape dissapeared never could

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>When i wus young maybe for id say 6 to 9 we were renting a house
that my mom and me know wus i haunted but for some reason we were the only
ones that saw it. I was the first to see ne thing i was laying in bed unable
to sleep due</b>
<br><b>to a strange feeling. I always kept my closet door locked well it
was locked that night, but when i looked at it, it was open and i could
see eyes staring at me i figured it wus my sister trying to scare me so
i went and open the door. I saw nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After many of
these experiences I became curious so i forced my mom to tell me the history
of the house. I finally got her to tell me that long before we moved to
the house a family that</b>
<br><b>didnt beleive in doctors or medicine lived there. There son developed
a real bad ear infection and died in the same room i stayed in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I lived with the ghost and soon got used to him. the only things that happened
would be floating objects and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom couldnt
stand it and made the whole family move out. I miss that house soooo much

<br><b>The Dark Lady</b>
<p><b>By: noles@digitalexp.com</b>
<p><b>This is a story that my friends and I found to be almost unbelievable.&nbsp;
We live in Florida and we often&nbsp; have cook outs with our friends and
neighbors.&nbsp; During one of these cook outs my wife, older daughter,
friends and I were sitting around our kitchen table and the subject of
ghosts came up.&nbsp; I don't know how the conversation switched to this
subject, but the question was asked if anyone had ever seen a ghost.&nbsp;
My older daughter said that she had seen a lady walk across the floor at
my parents' house. As the lady walked across the carpet she would turn
her head towards my daughter.&nbsp; She explained that</b>
<br><b>the lady's facial features could not be seen, but she could see
that she had shoulder length hair.&nbsp; She added that she had seen the
lady three times and everytime she would turn her head towards her as if
the lady was looking at her.&nbsp; The part that really freaked us out
was that several minutes later one of our friends was telling us about
an experience that he and some other guys had in a house that he used to
live in.&nbsp; The conversation continued on about ghosts and several minutes
passed when my younger daughter came into the kitchen from her room in
the back of the house.&nbsp; She heard the subject of</b>
<br><b>ghosts being discussed and asked if we were talking about the lady
at Granny's house.&nbsp; We asked her what she said and she asked again,
" Are ya'll talking about the lady at Granny's house?"&nbsp; We couldn't
believe what we were hearing because we</b>
<br><b>were not talking about the lady at the time.&nbsp; My younger daughter
went on to say that she had seen the lady once.&nbsp; The area of my parents'
house that they have seen the lady is in the older, original part of the
house.&nbsp; The house has been remodeled and built on to like many others.&nbsp;
The girls say that the lady appears in the same area everytime and walks</b>
<br><b>towards the back of the house where the downstairs bedrooms are
and disappears. The house was built in 1957 and my parents, my brother
and I are only the second family to live in the house.&nbsp; A younger
couple lived in it before us.&nbsp; We moved into the house in 1966.&nbsp;
My grandmother died in the house about 18 years ago, but her hair was not
shoulder length like the lady my kids see.&nbsp; My grandmother was short
( 5' tall ) and the lady the girls have seen is short.</b>

<p><b>THE SUMMERVILLE LIGHT</b>
<p><b>By: JMcda14110@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;Hello, my name is Jenny and I have seen the LIGHT! The Summerville
light in</b>
<br><b>South Carolina that is. My sister was always talking about this
thing she and</b>
<br><b>her friends would do for kicks. She said that they would go driving
down this</b>
<br><b>road late at night in Summerville and a ghost light would chase
them. I</b>
<br><b>thought they were crazy and probably drunk and just saw something
that could</b>
<br><b>easily be explained. So, I told her that the next time they went
that I</b>
<br><b>wanted to go too. Well, one night when I got off of work she and
some friends</b>
<br><b>came and got me. We live in Charleston so it took us about 30 minutes
to get</b>
<br><b>to Summerville. We then turned down this long dark road and drove
nearly to</b>
<br><b>the end of it. It was pitch black outside the car and I kinda started
to get</b>
<br><b>a little nervous. They then told me that the ghost was a man searching
for</b>
<br><b>his lost son and that someone had to get out the car and knock three
times on</b>
<br><b>the door of this nearby church. Well, no one did and I can't blame
them it</b>
<br><b>was spooky even without a ghost. We then started driving very slowly
and</b>
<br><b>flashing our headlights on and off. This was supposed to be the
signal for</b>
<br><b>the ghost to appear.</b>
<br><b>IT DID! What I saw was a flash of red light in the shape of a headless
man</b>
<br><b>running toward us. It looked sort of flat,kind of one dimensional
and seemed</b>
<br><b>to spin once and then disappear. We saw this twice. Then after a
few seconds</b>
<br><b>we saw this bright spinning light in the distance. It looked like
a really</b>
<br><b>big fourth of July sparkler spinning in a counter clockwise motion.
It was</b>
<br><b>quickly joined by second light of the same nature. One came from
the right</b>
<br><b>and the other from the left. They joined and went off to the left.
After that</b>
<br><b>we left. Everyone agreed we'd seen enough for the night. I was really</b>
<br><b>supprised. I thought we'd have to have some sort of ritual or seance
before</b>
<br><b>seeing the ghost. Also, it all happened so quickly. I didn't have
enough time</b>
<br><b>to get really good and scared. My thoughts on it were that we were
seeing an</b>
<br><b>event being replayed over and over again. The strange thing is that
the ghost</b>
<br><b>also interacts with people. I've heard stories were it chases people.
One</b>
<br><b>story is that it actually went straight through a car and shorted
out the</b>
<br><b>electrical system and these kids were left stranded on the road.
Many of the</b>
<br><b>locals know about it and the police sometimes potrol the road to
keep kids</b>
<br><b>from distrubing the nearby residents. Maybe they don't like us to
harass</b>
<br><b>their ghost. The truth is that I really felt sorry for the ghost.
Obviously,</b>
<br><b>it is some sort of tramatic event being replayed. The next time
I go I'm</b>
<br><b>planning on taking pictures and video. Thanks for allowing me to
share my</b>
<br><b>experience.</b>

In Calgary, Alberta, Canada their is a historical park called Heritage

<br><b>so on. There has been many real sightings in these old buildings,

<br><b>What Happened at my friend's place?</b>
<p><b>By: lhauselt@softcom.net</b>
<p><b>&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp; I wrote about my experiences at the house I grew
up in about a year</b>
<br><b>ago.&nbsp; I've got another story about another place in the area
where I grew</b>
<br><b>up, the California gold country.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My friend J. lived in a double-wide mobile home on top of
a hill just</b>
<br><b>outside of our small town.&nbsp; It was fairly new at the time (I
think her</b>
<br><b>parents bought it around 1970).&nbsp; Anyways, one afternoon I was
talking to her</b>
<br><b>on the phone (we were around 13 yrs old at the time), and I&nbsp;
heard her older</b>
<br><b>sister, M., scream bloody murder in the background.&nbsp; J. excused
herself to</b>
<br><b>go see what was the matter.&nbsp; When she came back to the phone,
I asked her</b>
<br><b>what the problem was.&nbsp; She told me M. was in her room, turned
and looked at</b>
<br><b>her door and saw a shadowy figure of a man and that he didn't seem
to have</b>
<br><b>any feet and was sort of hovering there.&nbsp; I thought it was
a little odd,</b>
<br><b>because their place was so new, and M. always seemed to be the</b>
<br><b>"Got-it-together" older sister.&nbsp; We resumed our conversation
and that was</b>
<br><b>that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; About a year later J. invited me and another friend, S.,
to spend the</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; M. was also there.&nbsp; Their parents were not.&nbsp;
Late that night we were</b>
<br><b>all in M.'s room, telling scary stories.&nbsp; We were talking about
a mine shaft</b>
<br><b>that was a couple hundred yards away from their place across the
street and</b>
<br><b>in the woods.&nbsp; It was a hole that went straight down into the
ground.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>had long been abandoned, but wasn't covered up or fenced in.&nbsp;
We were</b>
<br><b>talking about how creepy it was (it always seemed to me that it
would be</b>
<br><b>pretty easy to fall into or get pushed into by someone who wasn't
very</b>
<br><b>nice).&nbsp; Just then there was a very loud thud that came from
J.'s room.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>all heard it.&nbsp; It sounded like something very heavy was dropped
(or fell) on</b>
<br><b>the floor.&nbsp; We went in to check it out.&nbsp; Nothing was out
of place.&nbsp; J.</b>
<br><b>checked inside her closet.&nbsp; Nothing out of the ordinary there.&nbsp;
We decided</b>
<br><b>that we wouldn't talk anymore, and just go to sleep.&nbsp; M. was
very scared and</b>
<br><b>didn't want to be alone in her room, so I stayed with her, and S.
stayed in</b>
<br><b>J.'s room with her.&nbsp; We all fell asleep, and the rest of the
night was</b>
<br><b>uneventful.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I wondered what happened there - was there a spirit hanging
around there</b>
<br><b>who might have fallen down, or was pushed down, that mine shaft?</b>

<p><b>What Was That</b>
<p><b>By: brandeec@nslp.org</b>
<p><b>Here I am again, it's time to recount another experience I had when
I was</b>
<br><b>young.&nbsp; My parents were very good friends with a couple that
lived on the</b>
<br><b>outskirts of Lincoln in a big old house built in the 1890's.&nbsp;
Well, that</b>
<br><b>house was haunted and let me tell you how I know this.&nbsp; Gordie
&amp; Lois (my</b>
<br><b>parents' friends) had&nbsp; a granddaughter named Sonny. I was good
friends with</b>
<br><b>Sonny while I was growing up as she was just a few years older than
I.</b>
<br><b>Now I need to tell you the background of the house (as was told
to me by</b>
<br><b>both Gordie &amp; Sonny) back in the 1880's the lot was an old brickyard
that</b>
<br><b>supplied the growing city of Lincoln with bricks.&nbsp; Across the
street there</b>
<br><b>was a farm ( the pond was still there in the early 1980's, but the
house was</b>
<br><b>long gone)&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, a little girl lived on this farm
and she is the ghost I</b>
<br><b>have seen in this house.&nbsp; She used to play in the brickyard
then one day in</b>
<br><b>the late fall the little girl disappeared, she was not found until
the</b>
<br><b>spring after all the snow melted.&nbsp; She had been playing in
the brickyard,</b>
<br><b>had fallen and hit her head on a brick.&nbsp; She died and the snow
had covered</b>
<br><b>her body.</b>
<br><b>Now, here is what happened to me.&nbsp; I had heard the stories
about the ghost</b>
<br><b>of the little girl but I never really believed them, although I
hated going</b>
<br><b>up the stairs because it always seemed to be someone following me
up them.</b>
<br><b>One afternoon we were visiting and I was in Sonny's room listening
to Rod</b>
<br><b>Stewart Records.&nbsp; Sonny had a door sized posted of Humphrey
Bogart on the</b>
<br><b>back of her door so that when it's closed you can see his whole
face.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was a normal fall afternoon, it was warm and sunny but we just felt
like</b>
<br><b>chillin in Sonny's room.&nbsp; We had gone into the bathroom for
some reason and</b>
<br><b>Sonny had stayed there while I went back into her room and closed
the door.</b>
<br><b>When I walked in I noticed something very strange, well, several
things</b>
<br><b>really...first, the record player was still going, but there was
no sound,</b>
<br><b>second, the curtains which were long and white were blowing out
into the</b>
<br><b>room but the windows were shut and the house did not have Central
Air,</b>
<br><b>third, Sonny had a doll that sat beside her bed in a little rocking
chair,</b>
<br><b>yeah, it was rocking by itself,&nbsp; I freaked, I turned around
to open the</b>
<br><b>door, and I saw her.&nbsp; She was barely 3 feet tall, and just
a blur really,</b>
<br><b>like the heat coming off the concrete in the dead of summer, but
I could see</b>
<br><b>her because she made Humphrey all distorted, then she walked through
the</b>
<br><b>door and everything stopped, the record playing started making music,
the</b>
<br><b>doll stopped rocking, the curtains went back to normal and the room
was</b>
<br><b>suddenly warm again.&nbsp; Not really sure about what had just happened
I opened</b>
<br><b>the door and looked down the hall towards the window at the end
of the hall</b>
<br><b>and she walked right through it!&nbsp; I went to the bathroom to
tell Sonny and</b>
<br><b>she met me in the hall.&nbsp; She said I looked really pale, I was
scared to</b>
<br><b>death!&nbsp; I never ever, went upstairs in that house again.&nbsp;
In fact, I think I</b>
<br><b>only went to visit with my parents a couple of times after that
and I</b>
<br><b>usually went up the street to the park or stayed in the living room
with my</b>
<br><b>folks.&nbsp; Occasionally, when I would go to the park as I was
coming back down</b>
<br><b>the dirt road I would look up to the sewing room window and catch
a glimpse</b>
<br><b>of something, the curtains moving or a small face peering out the
window.</b>
<br><b>Now that I am older I feel kind of sorry for the little girl, she
was</b>
<br><b>probably just as scared as I was!&nbsp; I don't know what happened
to her, Gordie</b>
<br><b>and Lois had the old house torn down and built a new ranch style
house on</b>
<br><b>the property.&nbsp; They have both since passed away and I don't
know if the</b>

<p><b>Whispering Room</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: nullah@bellsouth.net</b>
<p><b>This is my first submission to the Shadowlands ghost tales collection,
but I have been reading and enjoying the hundreds of others!&nbsp; Since
this is the first, I'll keep it short.</b>
<br><b>It would not be inaccurate to say that I have had numerous uncanny
experiences with the "other side" since my earliest childhood.&nbsp; But
this particular incident happened when I was a sophomore in high school
-- so, I was about 15 years old.&nbsp; At that time my mother (who is now
deceased) had a consuming interest in reincarnation, meditation, communicating
with the spirit world, etc. and in pursuit of this interest she would often
seek out psychics for readings.&nbsp; What she was ultimately searching
for I can't really say I knew, though it occurs to me that there were a
number of dead relatives with whom she had"issues" during their life. At
any rate, one such pursuit led us to the home of a spirit medium.&nbsp;
Picture, if you will, a fifteen year old in her Catholic school uniform
and her neat Italian mom met at the door by a serene, dark-haired lady
bearing a candle ... in 70's</b>
<br><b>suburbia.&nbsp; The medium welcomed us into her home, a beautiful
brick home furnished throughout with stunning antiques.&nbsp; The living
room was full of old paintings of nameless people, old books here and there,
old lamps, settees so old the fabric was</b>
<br><b>threadbare -- you get the picture.&nbsp; And the entire room dominated
by an enormous, oblong dining table, bare of decoration, where, the medium
said, her seances were held.</b>
<br><b>It is a fact that I have always been sensitive to atmospheres, and
I did not like the atmosphere inside that house one bit. It felt as if
upon entering we were immediately surrounded by a mass of intensely curious
and suffocating air, filled with</b>
<br><b>spirit vibration.&nbsp; Imagine my alarm, then, when the medium
placed me in a stuffy wing chair near the front door and told me that she
performed solitary readings -- meaning that I would have to remain in that
room, alone, for the duration.The medium and my mother retired to a room
in the rear of the house.&nbsp; The door was shut and this was followed
by a moment of intense silence -- heavy and brooding.&nbsp; A sudden BANG
sounded from somewhere in the rear of the house; it shook and rattled and
then was silent.&nbsp; But not for long.&nbsp; Instantly, the air around
me began to sizzle with an almost whirlwind of whisperingand voices.&nbsp;
There were sighings and snatches of words just beyond the edge of my hearing
and looking all around I suddenly had the horrifying realization that the
voices were emanating from every object in the room.&nbsp; From the books
to the bric a</b>
<br><b>brac there was a cacophony of sound; in retrospect I imagine the
spirits were pondering who or what I was.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; All I
knew then was that a pleated, Catholic school skirt does not cover your
legs and knees well when you're cowering in fear in a haunted room!&nbsp;
The whispering went on and on, it seemed an eternity, until I was literally
shaking with fear. Just as I was about to become really brave and sprint
for the room where I thought my mother was, I was jolted by a sudden banging
near my head.&nbsp; I let out a scream and jumped to my feet, turning round
just in time to see a pile of mail drop through the front door mail slot
and a puzzled looking, but smiling, mailman on the other side.&nbsp; I
had to laugh out loud then, although a little nervously, because the intrusion
of the mailman performing his simple duty had stopped the ghostly noises
in an instant!&nbsp; I was alone once again in a wing chair in what had
become simply a quiet room on a deep yellow Autumn afternoon with the sound
of traffic and even a school bell nearby.&nbsp; When the medium and my
mother emerged at last I said nothing of my experience, but it was obvious
to both I was anxious to get out of there.&nbsp; After some polite conversation
we left and once in the car my mother asked me if I had heard a banging
sound while she was with the medium.&nbsp; I said, yes, I had, and she
told me that as she and the medium had sat down together the lighted candle,
placed between them on a coffee table, was knocked over and blown out and
a colossal BANG had struck the window in that room.&nbsp; Looking out,
they saw nothing that could have caused the sound.&nbsp; I didn't tell
her about my own experience. As a footnote, to my knowledge my mom never
went back to see the medium, but I can tell you that all through my high
school "cruising" years my friends and I tried many times to locate that
house.&nbsp; Funny, it was on a main street near a huge local landmark,
with a distinctly landscaped lawn, and I never again could locate it.&nbsp;
What a relief. Thanks for listening.&nbsp; There'll be more later!</b>

<p><b>White House ghost</b>
<p><b>By: rissy0420@yahoo.com</b>
<p><b>Hi there! I was surprised reading your story on the White House that
you didn't include the "ghost cat" I took a tour of the&nbsp; White House
with my aunt about 2 years ago. She at the time was working in the building
so we got to go to places not usually seen by tourists. Anyway, we were
in the basement area and she showed me the room that they keep the coffin
stand in.&nbsp; Apparently, everytime a president dies and is laid in state
the same stand is used. In this room&nbsp; (which is all cement, walls,floors
ceiling) are 3 or 4 huge cat paw prints. My aunt said that back in the
day there were stables under and around&nbsp; the white house and cats
were kept handy to kill all the rodents. Legend around there says that
each time a president dies a large black cat appears and cries loudly in
that room until the stand is taken out and used. Look closely at the back
of a&nbsp; old $20. On top of the White House in the upper right corner
is a picture of a cat walking across the building. My aunt&nbsp; says that
the cat story was so well known.</b>

already left, and I was alone. Actually I was the only one on the floor.
This happened on 2nd Main in St. Charles. It was about 7 in the evening
and I was waiting for my friend. All of the sudden there there was a knock
on the door when someone whispered my name "Dave" it said.&nbsp; It wasn't
loud enough to be a regular voice, but not a whisper. I went to the door
and no one was there. I was startled,</b>
<br><b>I thought my friend was playing a joke so I went to his room. He

<br><b>and looked at me strange, he explained to me that he just got off

<br><b>Lady That Walks The River Road</b>

<p><b>I am 26 years old and I am from Benton Tennessee, this story I am</b>
<br><b>wanting to tell you about is not really that scary...but it is</b>
<br><b>pretty creepy to me.&nbsp; I have always heard this, and have even
heard</b>
<br><b>of people that have seen it, but as of right now I have not seen</b>
<br><b>her myself.&nbsp; I live in a rather large county in south east</b>
<br><b>Tennessee, we are mostly Cherokee National Forest.&nbsp; There</b>
<br><b>are 2 sides of the county that are divided up, and the way to</b>
<br><b>get from one side to the other is to go around the mountain,</b>
<br><b>which also takes you around the Ocoee River.&nbsp; It is said that</b>
<br><b>if you drive around this river road late at night or really</b>
<br><b>early in the morning that you can look in your back seat</b>
<br><b>and there will be a woman just setting there looking at you.</b>
<br><b>The best time I have heard is when it is misting the rain.</b>
<br><b>I have never known her to hurt anybody, but she will ride along</b>
<br><b>with you until she just decides to "get out" and she dissapears.</b>
<br><b>I have heard 2 different things for the reason she may be there,</b>
<br><b>(1) back in the late 1800's early 1900's this young girl got married</b>
<br><b>and her and her husband were going from one end of the county</b>
<br><b>to the other for their honeymoon and their wagon went into the</b>
<br><b>river and they both died on their wedding night and she forever
stays</b>
<br><b>there around the river.</b>
<br><b>(2) there was a young girl that was took up there by a bunch of
guys and</b>
<br><b>they had their way with her and then killed her and is said to</b>
<br><b>only get in the cars of young boys just so she can scare them</b>
<br><b>(maybe and hopefully this is why she hasn't visited me on any of</b>

<p><b>House Guest</b>
<p><b>By: Moabman76@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Hi.&nbsp; I have a lot of respect for your website and have decided
to add my true</b>
<br><b>experiences.</b>
<br><b>When I was around 5 years old, I lived in a small duplex.&nbsp;
I slept on the top</b>
<br><b>bunk of a bunk bed and my sister slept on the bottom.&nbsp; I was
always scared of</b>
<br><b>our room--- it was constantly cold, and while falling asleep, both
my sister</b>
<br><b>and I heard someone calling our names several times.&nbsp; It wasn't
a familiar</b>
<br><b>voice and once when I ventured out of my bed to my parents' room
to see what</b>
<br><b>they wanted, I was surprised to see that they were both soundly
asleep.</b>
<br><b>Anyways, one night it unexplainably got very warm in our usually
cold room,</b>
<br><b>so I pulled all of the covers off of myself except for my well-tucked-in</b>
<br><b>sheet.&nbsp; I awoke in the middle of the night to find the sheet
tied tightly</b>
<br><b>around my neck-- I was CHOKING!&nbsp; I couldn't hear myself scream,
because I was</b>
<br><b>too frightened, I suppose, but my parents came running down the
hall and</b>
<br><b>eventually told me that I had been screaming :"GET HIM OFF ME!"</b>
<br><b>Now I live in a three-level house where I have lived for around
13 years.</b>
<br><b>Ever since I moved here, I have had strange experiences.&nbsp; I
can't go under</b>
<br><b>the stairs because I get this terrible feeling I'm being watched
and I am not</b>
<br><b>welcome.&nbsp; When I come up the stairs late at night I usually
run like the</b>
<br><b>dickens.&nbsp; I still hear my name at night-- RIGHT INTO MY EAR.&nbsp;
I can feel the</b>
<br><b>little hairs in my ear move with the breath.&nbsp; I have also had
an incident</b>
<br><b>where I have had a scream right into my ear.&nbsp; I constantly
see a very tall</b>
<br><b>shadow of a man out of the corner of my eye, sometimes he will walk
down the</b>
<br><b>stairs and you can hear the stairs creak.&nbsp; Mostly this happens
at night, but</b>
<br><b>occasionally it will happen during the day.&nbsp; There are knocks
on my bedroom</b>
<br><b>walls that will respond if you knock back.&nbsp; Though my sister
who still shares</b>
<br><b>my room, has heard it also, it seems centered around me.&nbsp; It
always happens</b>
<br><b>near me and only when I am home.&nbsp; It also follows me-- while
sleeping at a</b>
<br><b>friend's house (no one else was home)&nbsp; we heard horrible sobbing
and screams</b>
<br><b>from her little brother's room.&nbsp; Of course we ran into the
room to see what</b>
<br><b>was wrong with him, but he wasn't there!&nbsp; Anyways, enough of
my stories, but</b>
<br><b>there are many more which I do not currently have time to share
with you.</b>

<br><b>Ghost in Mississippi</b>
<p><b>By: ashley@c-gate.net</b>
<p><b>I live in Mississippi. Well me and some of my friends decided to
go campin back in some woods at the new cabin we had just bought. The camp
is in Jones County (just in case ypu were wondering). Well we got there
at about 8:00 that night.Well we were all just having a good time. Well
it started gettin late and 11 o'clock finally rolled around. Well most
of us were still wide awake. We were all sttin there and all of the sudden
a cold draft just came over us. Well I thought this was really weird because
it was in the middle of July and this is Mississippi we are talking about.
Well we kinnda blew it off. Then,at about 12 o'clock we heard this sound
that was the strangest sound I had ever heard. Well by then we all ran
and got in my car. Well my car sometimes don't wanna start. Well this was
one of those times. The sound was still echoing through the woods. The
sound sounded like someone that was screaming and moaning at the same time.
It was so loud that it made my ears hurt. Well on of the braver guys jumped
out of the car and lifted to hood to take a look. Then he turned his head
to look down a 4-wheeler trail. He said that he saw somethin so he was
goin to check it out. we all begged him not to go but he did anyway. When
he came back about 5 minutes later, he looked as pale as a ghost. I asked
him what was wrong with him. He said that he had seen people that looked
like Indiansand dressed at Indians. He said that there were about 20 of
them and</b>
<br><b>that one of them yelled at him in a language that he didn't understand.
He said by then he was ruming. But he said that they had a certain glow
about them.Well right about then I started crying tears of fear and tears
of frustration. I kept trying to crank up the car. Finally after about
5 more trys it crank. I hauled out of that place at least at 80 mph. We
finally made it out of the camp ground and on to a main road. When we all
got back home I told my dad. He of course did not believe us. Their parents
didn't either. My dad agreeded to go to the camp by his self) and take
a look. When he came back, he came back with arrowheads. I looked at&nbsp;
him and said see! I told you! He just looked at me and smiled.He said these
are over 50 years old. There's no tellin how long they've been out there.
He said there is no way that there was anyone out there last night. He
still didn't believe me. But I now know that I will never go back out there.
I also know why the camp was so cheap.</b>

<br><b>Shave and A Haircut</b>
<p><b>By: bryantodd99@yahoo.com</b>
<p><b>When I was about 12 or 13, I was involved with a youth group, and
we happened to be having a "lock in" one weekend night in a church which
I happened to go to at the time. This was in suburban Chicago. The church
has since closed.&nbsp; The church was old, well, at least for the suburbs,
I would say it was from the 20s, but had been remodeled in a tacky 1950s
style. We were in the basement, in a big open room ringed by Sunday school
rooms, offices and bathrooms. That's were the ten of us boys were in our
sleeping bags, with our youth leader, a guy who</b>
<br><b>was probably in his early 30s. Someone decided it'd be fun to play
"ghost in the graveyard" late that night, and use the whole church building.
The leader, I think his name was Brad, joined us in the game.&nbsp; The
church upstairs was very dark, and only lit by a couple exit lights and
a sliver of light from under an emergency exit near the front right hand
side of the church.&nbsp; A buddy and me found a great place to hide, down
a staircase through a door off the altar, which led down to the area we
were sleeping downstairs after going through a dimly lit hallway. There
was a small door under the staircase, which had a small knob on it. We
knew this was our hiding place. It was basically a</b>
<br><b>small storage area, very dusty and musty inside, but&nbsp; empty
except for some cans of paint, some old rags in a corner, and what I think
was a toolbox. It was very tight, for the both of us, and we basically
had to crawl in a stay in a crouched position, with our heads brushing
the top of the room, which was the staircase.</b>
<br><b>We shut the door and in the distance, could hear the muffled sounds
of the rest of the group, from someplace in the building. We were quiet,
and sure of the fact no one would find us, when suddenly there was a knocking
on the wooden door, to the tune of "Shave and a Haircut", da-da-da-da-da...da-da.
Except the last two knocks didn't happen, and we figured that it was one
of the other guys joking around, and I completed the last two knocks, whereupon
the door flew open to reveal no one there.&nbsp; At first, me and the other
guy thought it was funny,</b>
<br><b>that a couple of the others were trying to freak us out, and hiding
on the stairs above us, but no one was there. It was just then that we
felt as if someone else was in that hallway with us, and it was very creepy.
Needless to say, we booked it out of there, up the stairs, and ran until
we found some of the guys, and told them what happened. They thought we
were just trying to play a trick on them, and laughed our story off, but
Brad saw that we were both visibly shaken, and I for one didn't want to
be anywhere near that area.&nbsp; Brad went and checked it out, on his
own, I think just to calm us down, and when he came back, probably 5 or
so minutes later, he told us very calmly and quietly that we would be moving
upstairs into the church, and we could each pick a pew and lie on them.
The other</b>
<br><b>guys were sort of freaking out now, as we were, because of Brad's
grimness and silence as to what happened.</b>
<br><b>We moved our stuff up to the church and after some nervous chatter
for another half an hour or so, fell asleep. I was very glad to be leaving
the next morning, and dreaded having to return the next Sunday, for fear
I may have to go through that hallway.&nbsp; I remember asking Brad later
what happened when he checked out the door, and he said that the minute
he got near that door, which was shut tight when he got there, after we
tore out of there with it wide open, he felt like someone was watching
him, though he saw no one around. He pulled the door open, and got on his</b>
<br><b>knees and waved his flashlight inside, peering in, all the time,
feeling not alone in that hall. He said he closed the door, and the minute
he shut it, it flung open, and he swore that he heard a deep, sinister
sounding chuckle. That was enough for him, and he ran out and returned
to us.&nbsp; I actually never returned to that area of the church</b>
<br><b>during the next couple of years we went there, and Brad never mentioned
the event again, nor did any of us guys.</b>
<br><b>That was so many years ago, I am 29 now, but writing it down, the
details are returning clear as it happened today, and I am getting goose
bumps remembering that night.</b>

<br><b>The Girl Without A Face</b>
<p><b>By: Jill.Owens@gte.net</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This story may be a bit long, it contains many events. My now ex-husband
and my three small boys moved into a house in Tampa,&nbsp; Florida about
4 years ago. It needed work and we agreed to do it if the owner took it
off the rent. ( times where a little hard ) Well, the house was very dirty
and needed a lot of cleaning so that was my job before we could even move
in. The repairs could be done while we were there. The first time I went
into the house I did like it. The lay out was cool and there&nbsp; was
a small apt on the side.&nbsp; Anyway for the first two weeks all was well,
but late one night I can not recall what time it&nbsp; was, I was up sewing.
( my hobby ) When out of the corner of my eye I saw a young girl walking
past my livingroom window. I looked out the door as she was rounding the
corner to my house. I followed her around the corner and she was gone.
No place she could have gone, that part of the house is where the apt.
entrance is and it is blocked off from the rest of the yard.&nbsp; She
was of normal hieght and she was wearing light blue shorts with a light
colored shirt and shoulder length brown hair.&nbsp; Well, I went back to
my sewing and forgot about it until later. Soon after this my brother moved
from Ct. and needed a place&nbsp; to stay, so he moved into the apt. At
first I didn't want to tell him about the girl. But after he looked at
the apt. he said that maybe we should have a talk. My brother is very sensitive
to the other realm. So am I, but he seems to pick right up on things. I
told him he did not have to stay in the apt. but he said that he wasn't
worried, it didn't seem to be</b>
<br><b>harmfull. Again about a week later I was sewing and she appeared
on
the arm of my couch watching me sew. When I looked up at&nbsp; her she
had no face. Something told me to feel very sorry for her. Instantly I
felt the worst kind of sorrow. I cried for her as she just sat there with
no face. She soon vanished slowly, like she was fading in and out and then
gone. I saw her many times in the few months I lived there, My ex husband
didn't see her he saw her shadow along with my brother he never saw her
he only felt her. My niece saw her several time along with my cousin. She
would only show herself to women not men. She loved to play tricks on the
men. She would turn my brothers AC on and off the tv would go on and off
and change channels&nbsp; she would also turn his fan around to where it
was facing the wall. One night when we were going to bed we had just layed
down when she turned the shower on in our master bath room, My ex got up
and turned it off, as soon as he layed down, it turned on again, he got
back up and turned it off again, He no sooner layed back down, it turned
on again. Well that was it for him. He yelled"thats it, it's going to stay
on, I don't give a shit" As he rolled over to go to sleep it turned off.
I laughed at him because he was pretty mad. She never bothered my little
boys and I was thankful to her for that. She did scare me one time. I was
in the master bath room one night and the light went out. When I turmed
aroun to hit the light switch she was standing right there, inches from
my face. I thought I was going to scream. She never scared me like that.
Well, needless to say I was hot footen it out of that room. She always
had my niece and cousin squeling out of a room. But she never hurt any
one. One day about a week before we moved out a woman came to my house
looking for her daughter. She said that about 6 months prior she had recieved
a letter from her daughter with that&nbsp; address as her home. She said
that her daughter was 22 years old and hadn't came home in two years. They
had a falling out and she wouldn't talk to her mother, but then she recieved
a letter from her daughter saying she missed her mom and she needed to
tell her something important. I was very sorry but I did not know who she
was speaking of so I couldn't help her. But then she showed me a picture
of a very cute young woman with brown hair. I thought to myself that maybe
this could be the same girl. But I didn't say that to her mom. I just shook
my head no and she left. Afterwards I got to thinking about all the cleaning
I had to do when we first moved in. Under the bathroom sink were many used
bandaids with cotton and spots of blood, Also in the kitchen cabinet there
were many empty medicaine bottels with the labels tore off. My brother
seems to think that the girl was very ill, and that</b>
<br><b>she probley died with out anyone knowing who she was, her family
never found out, thats why she doesn't have a face. And also the reason
why men can't see her is because it was a man who possibley made her ill.
I don't know, what do you think. After I moved from there I divorced my
husband and moved on with my life. But I have driven past that house and
hoped that she has found peace somehow. I did ask the owner who the prior
tenant was and he told me that it was a man that subleased the house to
different people and he doesn't know where the man is today.</b>

<p><b>Don't Move the Dresser</b>
<p><b>By: Hrsrdr64@aol.com</b>
<p><b>I am 36 years old and have had several strange encounters with ghosts
and</b>
<br><b>haunted places.&nbsp; When I was in high school I went with some
friends to an</b>
<br><b>outdoor party at a large farm in Maryland.&nbsp; I needed to use
the restrooms</b>
<br><b>which were port o johns, a girl whom I did not know but lived in
the old</b>
<br><b>farmhouse offered to take me up to the house to use a civilized
bathroom, I</b>
<br><b>was very grateful.&nbsp; We entered the old house and she led me
up a flight of</b>
<br><b>stairs, the bathroom was directly in front of us.&nbsp; She told
me to wait for</b>
<br><b>her when I was finished so she could walk me back outside.&nbsp;
When I exited the</b>
<br><b>bathroom she was in a room to my left, it was her bedroom.&nbsp;
She was putting</b>
<br><b>on a sweater and I happened to notice a large chest in her closest
that was</b>
<br><b>sitting on big cement blocks so that the top of the chest of drawers
was</b>
<br><b>jammed up to the ceiling.&nbsp; I asked her why it was set up like
that and she</b>
<br><b>informed me that the previous owners (35years prior) had told her
parents to</b>
<br><b>never remove it, so they hadnt.&nbsp; About two years later I was
out with some</b>
<br><b>friends driving around on a Saturday night with little to do and
one of the</b>
<br><b>boys that were with us asked if we wanted to go to a haunted house,
we all</b>
<br><b>agreed and before I knew it we were driving down the road to the
farm where I</b>
<br><b>had been at the party several years before.&nbsp; The house was
abanoned and parts</b>
<br><b>of it had been torn down,&nbsp; we enterd through the front door
and went up the</b>
<br><b>stairs.&nbsp; I had already said that I had been here before.&nbsp;
When we got to the</b>
<br><b>top of the stairs the temperature had dropped to about 20 degrees,
kind of</b>
<br><b>strange weather for the middle of July.&nbsp; I looked in the bedroom
and where</b>
<br><b>the closet should have been there was a huge gaping hole in the
ceiling,&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>grabbed my girlfriend and ran down the stairs and out of the house.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>waited in the car while a few of the boys finished their exploring.&nbsp;
Needless</b>
<br><b>to say I never went back to that house, but I did try to find the
family who</b>
<br><b>had once lived there, there was no trace of them to be found.</b>

<p><b>Mr. Wagner</b>

<p><b>My father told me a very interesting story recently.&nbsp; His longtime
friend,</b>
<br><b>Mr. Wagner, died at the age of 80.&nbsp; Mr. Wagner's wish for when
he passed is</b>
<br><b>that his ashes be spread at Lake George.&nbsp; Mr. Wagner had vacationed
at Lake</b>
<br><b>George at the same campground site for 62 years.&nbsp; My father
went to Lake</b>
<br><b>George (an eight hour drive for him) for the ceremony, which was
scheduled</b>
<br><b>for a Saturday.&nbsp; Because of rain the ceremony was rescheduled
for the</b>
<br><b>following day.&nbsp; When everyone showed up at the campground site
on Sunday, it</b>
<br><b>looked as though a typhoon had hit only his site.&nbsp; The entire
campground had</b>
<br><b>not been adversely effected by the previous night's light rain at
all, but</b>
<br><b>Mr. Wagner's was so damaged that it took an entire week for the
maintenance</b>
<br><b>crew at the campground to remove the several trees and branches
that had</b>
<br><b>fallen.</b>
<br><b>My father doesn't believe in ghosts or anything, but he called this

<br><b>Haunted Since 5</b>
<p><b>By: cinsation@pa.net</b>
<p><b>First let me say thank you for creating a site where those of us
who share supernatural/paranormal activities can share our stories. A little
background to let you know who I am and why I am writing. I am a 35 yr
old female, back in college, and living alone since my husband passed away
4yrs ago. I have a very active social life and many friends, so it's not
as if I have nothing to do but sit around and dream up stories. I will
try to keep the experiences I have had over the past 30yrs brief so as
not to be boring.&nbsp; My first experience with something unreal happened
when I was approximately 5yrs old. The house I grew up in was built by
a great uncle that I never met, tho I do know the great aunt he was married
to prior to his death(which was before I was born).</b>
<br><b>I knew my parents would come into the bedroom at night to make sure
that my brother and I were covered, so when I felt someone sit on my feet,
I woke up to tell them to get off my feet, but no one was there. I could
see an indention in the bed and feel the pressure on my feet but there
was nothing there to see! Needless to say, I screamed for my father. When
he reached the bedroom door the pressure lifted and I never experienced
it again. I can only guess that maybe it was my great uncle checking on
me. The only other experience in that particular home was the opening of
the door from the carport on Christmas morning. At the time it happened
I still believed in Santa Claus so I guess I thought it was him entering
the house since we didn't have a fireplace to provide a chimney for him
(haha). My next experience was 13yrs later when I moved into my own apartment.
It was an old house which had been turned into 3 apartments. I would often
find things in the strangest places, i.e. my hammer turned up in the oven
in my kitchen. But nothing ever scary. Whoever it was that haunted the
place had a habit of walking very heavily through the house in the wee
hours of the morning. I named him George (I noticed a number of ppl have
also named their ghost George as well). It was amusing really, I would
call out for him to be quiet and the footsteps would quieten considerably,
to like someone tip-toeing thru the house. The footsteps often came to
the bedroom door but would never come inside the room. Except once, when
my then b/f stayed the night. When we awoke the next morning, his clothes
were laid across the sofa in the living room instead of the end of the
bed where he had left them. He never stayed in that apartment with me again.
Two years later I was married and pregnant. My then husband was in the
Navy and out to sea for 30 days. I was staying at my parents townhouse
until he returned. I woke up one night to see the Grim Reaper(?) outside
my bedroom window. Now mind you, I was sleeping on the second floor so
it wasnt anyone playing a trick on me. I didn't think too much of it, putting
it off</b>
<br><b>to dreaming. Then it happened again within about half an hour. I
woke up from dreaming of my husband and I holding the baby in the kitchen
of a house and looking up to see the Grim Reaper again. When I woke up
the next morning and went to work I thought about what I thought were dreams
and realized they were warnings instead. Later that day I miscarried.Many
things have happened over the years. Feelings of pure evil causing me to
be unable to scream or move, the paralysis you speak of on the site. Sometimes
these episodes would be joined by the sensation of floating/flying through
the house (not always the same house).</b>
<br><b>I did live in Gettysburg, PA for a short time with a roommate and
her boyfriend. But I had to move because of the noises. The apartment building
had been an old sewing factory at one time that had been gutted and had
apartments built under the main roof. I often heard gunfire, hoofbeats
and screams of injured and dying men, along with cannon fire. It was never
frightening, just annoying as hell.&nbsp; Until after my husband passed
away I had never seen an aparition or ghost. The first time I saw him after
his death was about a month later. I was having one of the evil episodes
and he appeared, bringing a wonderful calm feeling with him. He told me
that I have to tell them that I believe in God. This was in response to
my question of how was the crossing. It took me a while to figure out he
was referring to the evil presence and not my question. The next time I
saw him I had just found out that my oldest step-son had a son. I was still
in the habit of talking to him most nights before bed as it had only been
a few months since his death. This time he was sitting beside the bed in
a chair (which was not there) and told me the angels were taking care of
him. That gave me a wonderful sense of relief, because I knew then that
he was indeed okay.I must say, when we bought the house I currently live
in, we both knew there were spirits here. We could hear bedsprings</b>
<br><b>squeaking upstairs where no bed was set up.&nbsp; There is a small
child (my late husband named her Madeline) that likes to sit on my lap
at times. I have come home late at night, I used to work second shift (3-11)
and come up through the basement/garage to hear voices.&nbsp; Of course
by the time I reached the top of the stairs, they would disappear. Other
than mischievious pranks such as moving things around, nothing scary so
far. She did lock a friend in the house once though. I have no fear of
the spirit world, but I do have a healthy respect for them. I can often
tell when one is nearby and with the exception of the evil episodes, I
haven't run across any truly evil spirits.Thanks for the opportunity to
present my story. I apologize for it being so long. And thanks again for
the forum in which toshare with others the activities of our ghost stories.</b>

<p><b>Strange Apartment Happening</b>
<p><b>By: Mistyystr@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This is a true story that happend to me , my son and also my brother
and his</b>
<br><b>girl friend. I lived in Granbury, Texas&nbsp; , which I would like
to
add...This</b>
<br><b>Town in very haunted! I am surprised that no one has any documentation
on</b>
<br><b>this town...It has a long history in the Civil War times..where
Col. Granbury</b>
<br><b>lived, and some I believe died in this area from the War. Plus,
there are</b>
<br><b>alot of Witch craft stuff going on in this town also. I dont live
in this</b>
<br><b>town anymore, it took 5 years to get out of it...And I am glad to
be free</b>
<br><b>from this town!&nbsp; It all started when I moved there to be close
to my Family.</b>
<br><b>I moved from Fort Worth , Tx, to Granbury, Tx in 1990.&nbsp; I stayed
with my</b>
<br><b>Parents for a couple of weeks , then I found a nice Apartment complex
called</b>
<br><b>the Shores Apartments located on Hwy 377 across from What-A- Burger.
The</b>
<br><b>Apartments sat close to Lake Granbury...the back of the Apartments
where just</b>
<br><b>50 yards from the Lake. It was a very nice view, the price was right,
and had</b>
<br><b>fast food places just walking distance from there. But, some very
strange</b>
<br><b>things were obvious though. First, I was the third person to live
there,</b>
<br><b>Second , on my side of the Complex, I was the only one...Third,
The building</b>
<br><b>went through 3 owners prior to me moving in....The previous owner
told me</b>
<br><b>that....He acted funny too! What I mean by funny is that when I
told him what</b>
<br><b>apartment I wanted, he tried to sway me to another one that was
on the other</b>
<br><b>side of the complex. I couldnt understand why because this apartment
I wanted</b>
<br><b>was the nicest. It had new carpet, new furnishing and was more modern
looking</b>
<br><b>than the other ones. He even told me that a Man died in the one
I wanted, but</b>
<br><b>I didnt think it bothered me that much.&nbsp; Well, that would soon
change....My</b>
<br><b>life would soon changed!&nbsp; I wanted that one, and told him that
and that was</b>
<br><b>that! He never told me the place was haunted...I wonder if he knew
anyway? At</b>
<br><b>this time..I wasnt even worried about Ghost because I didnt even
believe in</b>
<br><b>them at all....I was thinking about getting my life together....I
just got</b>
<br><b>divorced , had a 4 year old son to take care of, and was looking
for a job</b>
<br><b>close to me. I didnt have a car at the time, so my brother drove
me around</b>
<br><b>when I needed a ride. I got a manager position job at the What-a
Burger</b>
<br><b>across the street&nbsp; so I could just walk to work..It was great!&nbsp;
I worked the</b>
<br><b>Grave Yard shift there...it is a 24 hr. fast food place. I let my
brother</b>
<br><b>move in to take care of my son for me while I worked...He also had
help from</b>
<br><b>his girlfriend while I was working . It all seemed like things were
going</b>
<br><b>good for me until my brother started trying to tell me that things
were not</b>
<br><b>fine at the apartments when I was working.&nbsp; I just ignored
him most of the</b>
<br><b>time. I didnt believe in that kind of stuff, and I thought he was
just joking</b>
<br><b>most of the time...Even, his girlfriend Renee started saying things
but I</b>
<br><b>thought she was just going along with Frank, my brother. Then when
my four</b>
<br><b>year old&nbsp; son Daniel ,started telling me about dolls that talked
to him and</b>
<br><b>moved their heads...That was IT!!&nbsp; I got very angry with the
whole thing! My</b>
<br><b>brother claimed to of had a pillow pushed on his face while sleeping
, and</b>
<br><b>Renee his girlfriend tells me that something pulled out her hair,
she even</b>
<br><b>showed me her pulled out hair, but I thought she had cut it out
or something.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As this was going on ...I still didnt believe these stories
until I started</b>
<br><b>having others that live on the other side of the complex&nbsp; tell
me that when</b>
<br><b>all of us were out, they would see a figure of a man walking in
our living</b>
<br><b>room ....they see lights come on ...etc. I have even noticed things
missing</b>
<br><b>and later find them behind my hot water heater , like my favorite
coffee cup</b>
<br><b>that always comes up missing right after I put it down in my certain
spot I</b>
<br><b>always put it, and find it later behind the water heater of in the
bathtub.</b>
<br><b>Ok, I would natrually blame it on my son....but he always told me
that he</b>
<br><b>didnt do it. But, what made me a believer was what made me Leave
this Devil</b>
<br><b>infested place!!&nbsp; It all happend when I came home from work...about
3 A.M. I</b>
<br><b>got off work...Went by the convient store first, to get bread, milk,
and a</b>
<br><b>few things ....walked on home...It was about 3:30 A.M. and everyone
was still</b>
<br><b>sleeping. Daniel was in my bed, Frank and Renee was sleeping in
the Living</b>
<br><b>Room on pallets. I was to high strung to just go to sleep, so I
decided to go</b>
<br><b>ahead and take out the trash to the trash ben . As I bent over to
get the</b>
<br><b>trash that I kept under the sink, the cabinet above my head opened.
I looked</b>
<br><b>to see if the latch was broken because sometimes latches dont latch
good and</b>
<br><b>cabinets open due to faulty latches. But, I checked and the latch
was good,</b>
<br><b>so I shut it and gave a tug to make sure the cabinet door was firmly</b>
<br><b>attached. So, I proceeded to bend down again and the stupid door
swang open</b>
<br><b>again. Well, this made me very angry and I got so mad that I started
yelling</b>
<br><b>at the Ghost and cussed it out!&nbsp; This was the biggest mistake
I ever made!</b>
<br><b>The Ghost got made too!!!&nbsp; It took my sack of Groceries that
I just bought</b>
<br><b>and they went flying threw the living room about 10 feet from the
kitchen</b>
<br><b>table to the wall. Everyone ofcourse woke up seeing what was happening.
They</b>
<br><b>opened the back sliding glass door and took off out side. I was
attacked by</b>
<br><b>this thing. It started pulling my hair at the same time I went to
get my son</b>
<br><b>Daniel out of my Bed room. I finally made it and got Daniel and
myself out of</b>
<br><b>the apartment. Other strange things happend prior to this scene
that I forgot</b>
<br><b>to mention, and Is very important to this story. Me and my brother
decided to</b>
<br><b>go Bowling one day , we made sure the apartment was locked up ....our
back</b>
<br><b>sliding glass door was locked , and also we have a board that is
placed at</b>
<br><b>the bottom of the door was an extra safety lock so no one can break
in...The</b>
<br><b>front door has three bolted locks ...made of steel ...I am the only
one with</b>
<br><b>the keys and the door is locked on the outside while leaving. I
only use</b>
<br><b>these locks when I go somewhere. Well, we locked up, and began to
leave , and</b>
<br><b>as soon as we got down the street , I noticed that I didnt have
my wallet in</b>
<br><b>my purse, so we made a U turn back to the apartments. We were gone
about a</b>
<br><b>couple of minutes at most...But on returning, we discovered that
the front</b>
<br><b>door was wide open, but the locks were still locked. How can a door
open with</b>
<br><b>the locks in locking position? Even the back door was opened and
the block of</b>
<br><b>wood was found in the bathtub. At that time..I called the Police
because that</b>
<br><b>is when I didnt believe about the ghost...My brother told me it
was the</b>
<br><b>ghost, but I just told him to shut up and not say nothing to the
police</b>
<br><b>because they would think we were crazy and maybe lock us up in a
mental ward</b>
<br><b>. When the Police got there, we told them what happend and they
didnt believe</b>
<br><b>us...they said a burgler couldnt open a door this fast, plus there
was no</b>
<br><b>fingerprints but mine, and no evidence of forced entry....Even the
wood was</b>
<br><b>tested for prints and nothing but our own prints were found on it.
The Police</b>
<br><b>were just as puzzled as we were , especially how the locks were
still locked</b>
<br><b>. It takes the key to unlock these locks, without the key, you cant
even push</b>
<br><b>the locks in with you hand . That was a weird day for me and my
brother, and</b>
<br><b>It all followed up to that day when I made the ghost made and he
made himself</b>
<br><b>known to me. This experience made me a believer in ghost..I had
moved from</b>
<br><b>this Apartment into a mobile home in Acton , Tx...on the outskirt
of</b>
<br><b>Granbury, but the ghost followed me there . I was re-married at
the time....I</b>
<br><b>was pregnant with my second child Jessica. It was in 1991, one year
after all</b>
<br><b>this happened. I was sleeping and something grabed both of my ankles
and</b>
<br><b>pulled me off the foot of the bed...at the same time, I was trying
to grab a</b>
<br><b>hold of my husband, but couldnt get a hold of him, when all of a
sudden , I</b>
<br><b>felt a warm, strong hand grab my arm and pull me up, as soon as
I felt the</b>
<br><b>hand pull me up, what ever had my ankles let go. I also was awaken
with a</b>
<br><b>Loud deep voice that seemed the echo in my inner ear..." Get Up
Now" . It was</b>
<br><b>so loud and so real that it woke me up from a deep sleep..which
made me</b>
<br><b>literaly jump out of the bed. I had enough of these ghost and things
in</b>
<br><b>Granbury, Texas...I even had the mobil home cleanesed with Holy
Water....We</b>
<br><b>moved back to Fort Worth and I havent had anymore ghost problems
since.</b>

<p><b>The White Man Looked Like My Uncle Bobby</b>
<p><b>By: lggibson@wcl.on.ca</b>
<p><b>I have had an experience with a spirit and it scared the living crap
out of me. I was camping with a couple of my friends down by the river
just out behind my friend Adam's house and everything was great until it
got to the point when we were</b>
<br><b>just sitting by the camp fire and talking. Well, I heard footsteps
in the bushes,and it sounded like tiny branches cracking from being stepped
on. I looked over to my left and i saw a man standing beside a tree, he
was wearing baggy white pants,a tight white shirt and white shoes. This
man had no facial structures, his face was flat like a rag doll. I screamed
"OH MY GOD!" then the three people I was with asked me what I was screaming
about and I told them to look at the man standing up against the tree.
they asked me where so I pointed and they couldn't see anything. I started
balling because I was the only one who could see this man and I was so
serious about this that I scared everyone else so bad that we didn't even
stay down there to camp.We walked the opposite way out of the bush from
where we had gone down there. My friend turtle wouldn't leave the bush
without the shovel, so he carried it with him until we got back up to the
street where all the houses were. I was still hysterical and they thought
that I was just putting on a big show until we got to the baseball diamonds
where they</b>
<br><b>thought we could all sit and calm down. That didn't work, it just
made the whole thing worse.&nbsp; You know how a cat hunches it's back
when it's being pet? well everyone saw the cat hunch it's back and they
were like "Anne,look at the cat it looks like there is someone petting
it" I looked over and screamed at the top of my lungs cause I saw the "white
man" sitting beside my friend Cindy and he was petting the cat.&nbsp; I
took off running and I heard someone say "Anne wait for me don't######
leave me here with this thing!" I turned around to see who was calling
me and my friend Turtle was standing right</b>
<br><b>behind me, but behind him was the "white man" I just froze, I couldn't
move so Turtle hugged me and told me to close my eyes and calm down, I
did and when I opened my eyes back up the "white man" was gone. Well I
was petrified to go home that</b>
<br><b>night and be by myself so I stayed the night at my friend Jess'
she wasn't there but she lived across the road from the baseball diamonds
and heard me screaming. so we told her all about it and she said I could
stay with her. I didn't see it for the rest of the night until I went to
sleep. I saw the"white man" in my dream, except this time I wasn't afraid
of him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; He told me that he was someone I lnew well and that he was
here to help me because I was in trouble. I asked him what was going to
happen to me and he promised that nothing would happen as long as I did
what he said. He then told me to make sure that I walk home in the morning
instead of riding jess' bike. Then I woke up and was breathing really heavy
Jess asked me what was wrong so I told her what I dreamed about and she
said that I could still use her bike if I wanted but if I didn't feel safe
I could walk. I thought this dream I had was just a dream because I was
scared when I went to sleep that night I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;soon found out that it wasn't just a dream when I got around
the block from my house I was on Jess' bike and I turned the corner and
I was hit by a car. It knocked me ou tfor a couple of minutes and when
I woke up there was that"white man" he was the one that helped me up. He
picked me up under the arms like you would pick up a little kid that you
were going to hug. He didn't say a word just smiled and left he walked
away and faded into the front door of my neighbors house. I haven't seen
him since but my 14 year old sister claims that she has seen him. In my
opinion I think that this spirit was my uncle Bobby he was stabbed to death
about eight years ago now but it was only two years after his death that
I saw him. I think he was just looking out for me and I beleive he always
will be.</b>

<br><b>2 Different Kinds</b>
<p><b>By: Bebopsmom1@aol.com</b>

to the small</b>

comic book,</b>
<br><b>Coca Cola, candy bar, and a bag of chips.&nbsp; This was always
a prerequisite to</b>
<br><b>my favorite TV shows Sky King and Mighty Mouse.&nbsp; After I turned

Looking</b>
<br><b>straight from the couch into the bedroom where my grandmother died

<br><b>daughter was 15 months. My ex-husband and I were separates, but
he would come</b>
<br><b>ny to pick our daughter up for visitation. In July, he came by to
get the</b>
<br><b>baby for a visit. I waved good-bye and went back into the house.
Since moving</b>
<br><b>in I noticed that the left side of the house, it's a perfect rectangle,
had</b>
<br><b>an odd, uneasy feeling to it. The left side includes my daughter's
bedroom,</b>
<br><b>the dining room and my office with is open into the living room
(It's</b>
<br><b>actually all one big L shaped room x-cept for the bedroom) Anyway,
I walked</b>
<br><b>from the kitchen in the front of the house into the dining room.
Both sets of</b>
<br><b>windows were so thick with frost, you could have scratched your
name into it</b>
<br><b>with your fingernail. This scared me to death and I ran back out
of the</b>
<br><b>house. My ex was gone, and as I didn't know my neighbors at the
time and</b>
<br><b>didn't want them to think I was crazy, I went back inside. The frost
was gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the course of the years I did a lot
of construction on the</b>
<br><b>house, turning it from a one bedroom, one bath log cabin to a sided,</b>
<br><b>sheetrocked, two bedroom, with an apartment downstairs to help with
the</b>
<br><b>mortgage. The odd feeling continues through all of this, and sometimes
was so</b>
<br><b>oppressive, I had to go sit outside until it went away. Things would
move on</b>
<br><b>their own, lights would turn on &amp; off, the TV would turn on
when I walked</b>
<br><b>past it. The area that is my office was always the creepiest. As
I worked at</b>
<br><b>night then (was a bartender while in school) I had many baby-sitters.
Some of</b>
<br><b>them would never come back because of the feeling in the house.
One even said</b>
<br><b>she felt someone blow on the back of her neck while my daughter
was sleeping.</b>
<br><b>Finally, I found a great sitter who then became a great friend.
She is also a</b>
<br><b>clairvoyant and can feel &amp; see things when she allows herself
into a</b>
<br><b>trancelike state. She felt two presences, one male, one female.&nbsp;
I am the</b>
<br><b>second owner of the home, and the house was empty for three years
before I</b>
<br><b>purchased it. The woman "Anne" who owned it was a cranky old woman
who would</b>
<br><b>yell at you even if you walked past the front of the house. Apparently
she</b>
<br><b>died about a month after being removed to a nursing home. (This
is a new</b>
<br><b>update, I had thought she died here)&nbsp; While the house was empty
it was a</b>
<br><b>hangout for the kids to drink beer, etc. There were preparations
for a party</b>
<br><b>to be at the house. (the house had no electric turned on &amp; no
running water</b>
<br><b>while it was empty) Some boys came in, about 15 or 16 to do whatever
they had</b>
<br><b>to do before the party. One of them reached up to do something with
the smoke</b>
<br><b>alarm, and the 220 volt threw him across the room, hitting his head
on the</b>
<br><b>wall where my desk is, and was killed. No electricity? I guess the
odd</b>
<br><b>feeling was the boy, and from time to time he would get real jumpy.
My</b>
<br><b>brother &amp; I were both students of Wicca, and were rather amused
at having a</b>
<br><b>ghost.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1996 my brother passed away from cancer. He
was an illegitimate child</b>
<br><b>of my fathers, and I had met him&nbsp; by chance in 1993. We were
super close as</b>
<br><b>before this I was an only child. After he passed away, I had a new
tenant</b>
<br><b>move in who had lost his daughter in a car accident a few years
earlier. He</b>
<br><b>had some ghostly experiences in other apartments he had lived in
and truly</b>
<br><b>believed they were his daughter. Soon after my brother death, things
began to</b>
<br><b>happen that made me think he was here. When he was alive, he would
take my</b>
<br><b>shoes and put them on the dining room table, which drove me crazy
as I always</b>
<br><b>thought it was bad luck. After his death, I would get home from
work &amp; take</b>
<br><b>my shoes off by the kitchen door. In the morning, I would find them
on the</b>
<br><b>dining room table. Items would be rearranged, like my daughter's
boardgames.</b>
<br><b>I would have then stacked from largest on bottom to smallest on
top, but in</b>
<br><b>the morning I would find them just the opposite.&nbsp; Time passed
with this</b>
<br><b>happening &amp; I met my husband. He moved in very quickly after
we met &amp; I</b>
<br><b>informed him about our "friends". he was very skeptical. My brothers
antics</b>
<br><b>quieted down a little ater John's (my husband) arrival, but when
John wasn't</b>
<br><b>home he would come out in full force. As I don't like to sleep downstairs</b>
<br><b>alone, I'd fall asleep on the couch until he got home from pool-league.
I</b>
<br><b>have been woken up with my name being called in a very urgent manner.
this</b>
<br><b>would be accompanied by feeling very hot and goose-bumps. The light
would</b>
<br><b>turn on behind me. The channels would change on the TV.&nbsp; The
shoe game has</b>
<br><b>continued, and a few months ago, he started something new. I I buy
new</b>
<br><b>clothes and do not wear the right away, they will disappear or about
two</b>
<br><b>weeks, then reappear in a&nbsp; different place than I had put them.
He has done</b>
<br><b>this to me while my husband &amp; I are getting ready to go out,
the outfit I</b>
<br><b>laid out to wear will be gone. I have actually run around the house
yelling</b>
<br><b>"give me back my clothes." O course I wind up wearing something
else, but the</b>
<br><b>outfit will be laid out on the bed when we get home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My tenant, who has now been living here 4 years
has interesting</b>
<br><b>experiences all the time. He will smell that "old-lady" smell in
his</b>
<br><b>apartment, and has been woken up by high heels walking briskly towards
his</b>
<br><b>bedroom door @ 3:00 am. The sounds always stop right outside the
door. He has</b>
<br><b>seen shadows gliding across his walls several times, all the while
his cats</b>
<br><b>are going crazy. The picture of his daughter constantly falls down,
although</b>
<br><b>it's in a secure location. Things disappear the reappear later in
a different</b>
<br><b>spot. We think the smells and the footsteps are "Anne" and the other
is his</b>
<br><b>daughter.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most recently, I was standing in front of the
stereo, my girlfriend &amp; I</b>
<br><b>were listening to some traditional Irish tunes when suddenly I got
really hot</b>
<br><b>&amp; covered with goosebumps. I watched the volume dial (it had
one of those lit</b>
<br><b>up red lines on it) go from our to ten! I started yelling &amp;
my girlfriend</b>
<br><b>started yelling because she got all goosebumpy too. It felt like
something</b>
<br><b>passes through me to get to the stereo dial.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that week I was lying in bed with my husband
at 11:00pm. he was</b>
<br><b>sleeping, I was watching TV. The stairs leading to our room are
wood, and</b>
<br><b>very noisy when you walk down them. The door at the top o the stairs
was</b>
<br><b>closed. I heard someone walk down the stairs, then stop just before
you turn</b>
<br><b>the corner into out room. Again I was goosebumpy and hot (and scared)
and the</b>
<br><b>dog was growling with his hackles up, looking towards the doorway.
Later that</b>
<br><b>night at about 5:30am, I was woken up hearing a child calling me.
I thought</b>
<br><b>it was my stepdaughter (bonus child, I prefer) as she has recently
been</b>
<br><b>having a string of nightmares. I went upstairs to check, but both
girls were</b>
<br><b>sound asleep, my bonus child was snoring, and my daughter never
calls me by</b>
<br><b>my&nbsp; first name. When I got upstairs to check, the dog and the
three cats ran</b>
<br><b>to me i I was their savior or something.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it seems we have Anne, the boy, my brother
and my tenants daughter all</b>
<br><b>here from time to time. In a way I feel that my brother is watching
over me</b>
<br><b>when my husband isn't home. So far, all harmless stuff, and after
eight years</b>
<br><b>of it you get accustomed, and generally smile when something happens.&nbsp;
That's</b>
<br><b>it for now&nbsp; -</b>
<br><b>Thanks for listening!!&nbsp; :)</b>

<br><b>My Cousins Passing</b>
<p><b>By: morgansmithdesign@earthlink.net</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;I have a cousin who was murdered in the very late 30's or early
40's.&nbsp; He was killed in the local swimming hole.&nbsp; The killers
were never found. I never really realized what a horrible impact it has
had on my family until lately.&nbsp; In my late teens, I stopped at the
bridge to look down at the creek where he was killed.&nbsp; I really didn't
know much about his death then or even cared for that much.&nbsp; Suddenly
and unexpetently I was overcome with a horrible feeling of dread mixed
with evil.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I ran back to my car. Since that day I have had dreams about
the water, that it is evil. My cousins death slowly entered into my dreams.
In one dream there is a scrapbook that is fastly deteriorating, and a little
man comes to me and says hurry&nbsp; time is running out. I don't really
know what all this means.&nbsp; I have never had any kind of encounter
with my dead cousin...until today.&nbsp; I wrote an email to my dad trying
to get family info on the events of the day he died. There are two versions
of the story.&nbsp; My father wrote me back and told me to drop it, stay
out of it, I am heading in a direction I should not go&nbsp; in.&nbsp;
He said it all happened so long ago and all involved in it would be nearly
dead by now. I left my office and got into my car, I felt he was probably
right since I have so much to think about with my job, family etc. As I
sat down in the drivers seat of the car something touched me. It was ice
cold and wet.&nbsp; I jumped I thought I had turned over a coke in the
car. I looked around-there were no softdrinks or anything wet in the car.&nbsp;
I touched my skirt and it was not wet, just cold. My skin stayed cold for
a long time. My husband was home when I arrived home from the office and
he touched my skin and it was still cold! It was not like a spilled drink
it was like a touch a cold wet finger tip - I live in Louisiana and it
is so hot right now, anything cold stands out! There are more details about
his death. But I just wanted to run this by you.&nbsp; I think my dad is
right, that I should drop it. I am also an artist and I have had some psychic
experience. I have never</b>
<br><b>tried to attract anything like that. I believe in God and don't
look for the dead. Both me an my sister experience odd happenings since
we were children. We grew up in a house that I believe was haunted. It
was built in 1879.</b>

<br><b>Refuses to Leave</b>
<p><b>By: LacyatTc2003@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Hello my name is Lacy and I am 15 years old. You can call me a teenager
with</b>
<br><b>an overactive imagination if you want but my mother is a 38 year
old nurse</b>
<br><b>and she believes in ghost.&nbsp; I have heard ghost stories all
my life and I</b>
<br><b>never really believed them until a few months ago when I was staying
at my</b>
<br><b>aunt's house.&nbsp; Before I tell my story I would like to explain
a little bit</b>
<br><b>about my aunt's house.&nbsp; My aunt Dulcie lives in a house that
she is renting</b>
<br><b>from my aunt Doris.&nbsp; Before Dulcie moved in a very dear friend
of the family</b>
<br><b>lived in it until his death a few years ago.&nbsp; I believe his
ghost still stays</b>
<br><b>in the house because of the circumstances surrounding his death.&nbsp;
Although he</b>
<br><b>was dying of cancer we feel that his death was not completely natural.</b>
<br><b>During his last few days at home he was accompanied by his daughters
who</b>
<br><b>failed to care for him properly in my opinion and the opinion of
many nurses</b>
<br><b>in my family. A few days before he pasted away my aunt went to visit
him and</b>
<br><b>found his lips to be very parched and believed he was suffering
from</b>
<br><b>dehydration, when she suggested that he should be given some water
his</b>
<br><b>daughter said "Dad do you want some water?" being in a comatose
state he was</b>
<br><b>unable to respond so my family believes he died from starvation
or</b>
<br><b>dehydration.&nbsp; Now I will tell you my experience with the what
I believe to be</b>
<br><b>his ghost.&nbsp; I was spending the night in this house for the
first time since</b>
<br><b>my aunt had moved in and I had heard stories from several family
members</b>
<br><b>about hearing footsteps, running water, and the bedroom in which
he died in</b>
<br><b>remaining very cold even in the middle of the day during the summer
when it's</b>
<br><b>hard to cool the rest of the house.&nbsp; I didn't really believe
in ghost and</b>
<br><b>thought they were just joking around.&nbsp; The night that my experience
took</b>
<br><b>place my aunt that is living in the house was at work but my aunt
Hillary,</b>
<br><b>her baby, my cousin Adam and my sister Tarra was there.&nbsp; I
was asleep on the</b>
<br><b>couch and woke up around midnight to find everyone else in my cousin's
room</b>
<br><b>playing on the computer and the baby asleep in the my aunt's bedroom
(the one</b>
<br><b>that our friend, JB died in). After a few minutes my aunt went to
check on</b>
<br><b>the baby and came back to ask me if I had covered the baby up, I
told her no</b>
<br><b>I hadn't and my sister brought up "the ghost."&nbsp; Well, Tarra
and Hillary went</b>
<br><b>back to the other bedroom to talk and get the baby to go back to
sleep.</b>
<br><b>About ten minutes later Hillary and Tarra came back in Adam's room
looking</b>
<br><b>very scared and said they were talking about ghost and they felt
the bed</b>
<br><b>shake.&nbsp; Now I thought this was very funny because a 20yr old
with a kid was</b>
<br><b>scared and I didn't believe in ghost at the time anyway so I asked
them what</b>
<br><b>had happened.&nbsp; Hillary said that she was sitting on the bed
talking to Tarra,</b>
<br><b>who was sitting in the floor against the bed, and they were just
talking and</b>
<br><b>then she felt the bed shake and thought my sister was doing it until
Tarra</b>
<br><b>asked her if she felt it and they both got scared and left the room.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>started acting like I was a bad a** and started screaming obscenities
at "the</b>
<br><b>ghost" and telling it if it was really there to show itself.&nbsp;
This really</b>
<br><b>upset my sister and she was telling me not to make it mad and to
stop talking</b>
<br><b>to it like I was so I told her I would prove that there was no ghost.
So I</b>
<br><b>went in the "haunted bedroom," everyone else was standing at the
door because</b>
<br><b>they would no longer step foot in the room, I sat down on the bed
and said</b>
<br><b>"If there really is a ghost I want you to show yourself right now."
Nothing</b>
<br><b>happened so I laid down on the bed and told them "See there is no
ghost!" and</b>
<br><b>I started laughing and then I felt the bed shake, not the whole
bed just the</b>
<br><b>middle of the mattress where I was laying. I was so scared I started</b>
<br><b>screaming and jumped up, when I did this everyone ran into the living
room</b>
<br><b>but I didn't stop there I ran out the front door so everyone followed
me out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Just imagine how we must have looked, a twenty year old, three
teenagers and</b>
<br><b>a baby standing outside in the middle of the night.&nbsp; I was
hysterical, my</b>
<br><b>sister was saying "Did you feel it too? Did you feel it too?", my
cousin was</b>
<br><b>asking, " What happened?" and my aunt was telling us we had to calm
down and</b>
<br><b>go back inside before someone called the police.&nbsp; It took about
twenty</b>
<br><b>minutes to convince me, a former nonbeliever who had just been scared
half to</b>
<br><b>death to go back in that house.&nbsp; After we went back in the
house, because the</b>
<br><b>baby was hungry, Hillary set the baby down in a recliner to go fix
some</b>
<br><b>formula, the baby was probably around 16 months at the time and
could sit</b>
<br><b>alone, but for no apparent reason the baby stood up and fell over
the side of</b>
<br><b>the chair and busted her head on a coffee table.&nbsp; My sister
was standing</b>
<br><b>right infront of the chair and the baby was tired and not very active
at the</b>
<br><b>time so there was no real reason for her to be jumping around or
anything</b>
<br><b>like that, which might I add she was not doing, she just kind of
fell over</b>
<br><b>the side of the chair. I believe the ghost caused the baby to fall
and get</b>
<br><b>hurt even though he was one of the sweetest men in the whole world
when he</b>
<br><b>was alive I believe he left behind an angry ghost because of his
death and</b>
<br><b>the way his family neglected him.</b>

<br><b>WAS IT MARILYN?</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>by Dubricus</b>
<p><b>In the spring of 1996 I was working on a nationally syndicated talk
show,</b>
<br><b>which was made in Hollywood. At the time, in a last ditch effort
to save the</b>
<br><b>show, we frequently shot on location. We taped one show along Hollywood
Blvd.</b>
<br><b>Our headquarters was in several of the poolside rooms at the Hollywood</b>
<br><b>Roosevelt Hotel, where the first Academy Awards were held and the
Munchkins</b>
<br><b>were billeted during the making of the Wizard of Oz. Supposedly
Marilyn</b>
<br><b>Monroe's image can occasionally be seen in a mirror and Montgomery
Clift</b>
<br><b>plays his trumpet in the room and hallway where he stayed during
the filming</b>
<br><b>of Giant.</b>
<br><b>Naturally, our call was very early, we loaded in, got settled, had
our</b>
<br><b>breakfasts, and were joking around, as all crews do in the morning.
Recently,</b>
<br><b>I had been having some "spiritual" experiences involving my mother,
who had</b>
<br><b>passed away in 1994. With tongue in cheek, I said, "Well... if anyone
runs</b>
<br><b>into Marilyn, it will probably be me." Things got busy and that
was the last</b>
<br><b>thought given to it.</b>
<br><b>Late in the afternoon we were taping a swimsuit fashion show along
the north</b>
<br><b>side of the pool. I was standing in the shade of the tropical bar
located in</b>
<br><b>the northeast corner of the courtyard. The bar was closed... it
opened only</b>
<br><b>for special occasions. Directly to my left was Jane (not her real
name), the</b>
<br><b>make-up person, and to her left, but about two feet back was Carol
(also not</b>
<br><b>her name), the hair dresser.</b>
<br><b>We were watching the models strut their stuff, when suddenly a cold,
musty</b>
<br><b>breeze moved by us right to left (south to north). I won't say blew...
it did</b>
<br><b>not have that feeling. It lasted no more than a second or two, but
had a</b>
<br><b>definite beginning and end. Also, Jane and I felt it only on the
fronts of</b>
<br><b>our bodies. Carol felt nothing.</b>
<br><b>I was curious. I walked to the pool and held my hand over the water...
it was</b>
<br><b>not cold enough and had a chlorine odor. I looked through the bushes,
walked</b>
<br><b>around the entire courtyard and its balcony searching for a ventilation
duct.</b>
<br><b>I thought perhaps the air conditioning might have come on, but I
found</b>
<br><b>nothing, nor did I ever hear the sound of a motor, such as you might
have</b>
<br><b>from a fan or an engine. I gave up.</b>
<br><b>Upon leaving, I happened to overhear a hotel guest, a tourist, ask
the</b>
<br><b>concierge where the famous mirror was that sometimes showed Marilyn
Monroe's</b>
<br><b>image. If I recall, he replied that it was on the mezzanine. "However,"
he</b>
<br><b>said, "she also seems to like to hang out next to the poolside bar,
where she</b>
<br><b>spent a lot of time when she was alive."</b>
<br><b>You could have bowled me over with a feather.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Butter Knife</b>
<p><b>By: Rosie2619@aol.com</b>
<p><b>When I was about 15, I was living in Visalia, CA. We had a nice home.
I knew</b>
<br><b>from the moment i walked into the house on moving day that something
was</b>
<br><b>wrong though. I remember feeling watched, followed and even glared
at.</b>
<br><b>Something was telling me that whatever was there, was not happy.</b>
<br><b>Anyway. I was fixing the Television, because it had gone on the
blitz again</b>
<br><b>(it had been doing that more often than not lately) and spun it
around on</b>
<br><b>it's cart, so I was facing the back of the TV. I didn't have any
tools on me,</b>
<br><b>i was only adjusting a cable. So i'm bending over, to see what the
heck is</b>
<br><b>wrong with this cable, and i feel something nick my elbow. Thinking
its</b>
<br><b>probably my mom tossing a pillow at me, I spin around and look around.
She</b>
<br><b>wasn't there. No one was there. I look down, it was a butter knife.
One of</b>
<br><b>those oddly shaped ones, with a curve at the top. I look at it,
then look</b>
<br><b>back up, like "great, my mom is trying to kill me".</b>
<br><b>I walk into her rom, and she is lying on her bed watching her TV.
I hold up</b>
<br><b>the knife, and ask her what in gods name she thought she was doing.
she looks</b>
<br><b>at me, and then the knife, and says "what?" i told her what happened,
and she</b>
<br><b>said that she had put that knife away just a couple of minutes ago.
I knew</b>
<br><b>she was telling the truth, because when my mom is playing around,
you can</b>
<br><b>tell. She wasn't smiling. She had a look of shock and horror on
her face.</b>
<br><b>Well, Nothing ever happened other than that. I always had the feeling
of</b>
<br><b>being stared at when i was alone. Which was enough to make me get
up and</b>
<br><b>leave the house. But it or whatever threw the knife at me, never
bugged me</b>
<br><b>again. I guess it just wanted to let me know that it was there.

<br><b>Rather Pleasant</b>
<p><b>By::marie@MIT.EDU</b>
<p><b>I have been reading your website for years now, and I think it's
great work. I can sympathize with your personal story, as I have lived
through some similiar experiences myself. I, too, have had hauntings, only
to have them return later on. Except</b>
<br><b>in my case, it was via one of those damned Ouija boards. (I HATE
those things!) It was heinous, but that's another story for another day.
Like so many others who send in their stories, I was born sensitive. My
Grandmother was known to have "the</b>
<br><b>sight", and I've had experiences with that sort of stuff my whole
life. Some were good, some were bad. Some were just brutal.But today, if
I may, I would like to tell you a story that was not scary at all. Here
goes:I was young at the time, about 4 or 5. I am from Boston, and have
lived here my whole life. This particular one happened in</b>
<br><b>Everett, a suburb just outside of Boston. At any rate, I had this
little pal that I used to hang out with. Her name wasPatty. One day, me
and Patty were making "mud pies" in her backyard. Her mother came out and
told us to get inside to get cleaned up for lunch, so we went inside. Patty
was taken in to get cleaned up first, and I distinctly remember us both
being COVERED in mud. Head to toe! My mother was a cleaning nut when we
were kids, so I remember being real careful not to touch anything, so I'm
standing outside of the bathroom like some pint sized statue. :)I'll never
know what made me look, but the bathroom was located around the corner
from the kitchen, and you had to crane your neck to see into the kitchen,
so I did. And I seen a kindly elderly lady sitting at the kitchen table.
The first thing I noticed about her was that she seemed to be sitting directly
in the sunshine, because she just radiated this "light", and she looked
incredibly peaceful. "Serene" is probably the best word to use. She was
heavy set, with white hair and very blue eyes. She was wearing a yellow
sweater. I don't know why this sticks out so</b>
<br><b>much, but I've never forgotten that. Anyway, she smiled and waved
me over. I walked over and although I can't remember, specifically, what
was said, the "nice old lady" myself had a nice chat. But she did keep
on patting my shoulders and telling me to "be a good girl" and so forth.
The entire time, I was aware of a strong scent coming off of her. I mean
no disrespect at all, but she smelled of a mixture of "moth balls and denture
cream" or something! I remember that so well because it was a real task
to keep my nose from crinkling, which I could never have done. She was
so sweet, you wouldn't dare hurt her&nbsp; feelings.&nbsp; I don't think
we talked long, before she patted my shoulder ag ain and told me to run
along and be a good girl, or something to that effect. So I was called
in to get cleaned up and when we were finished, it was time to have lunch.
Patty, Patty's mother and myself went into the kitchen to eat and I noticed
the old lady was gone. It was a warm summer day, so I just assumed she
went for a walk or something and didn't think anything of it.&nbsp; I don't
remember how long it was till I was there next, it might have been a day
or two, but the next I was there, I asked my friend's mother where the
nice old lady was? My friend's mother had no idea what I was talking about
and dismissed it as saying it was in my imagination. I remember this because
I was getting very frustrated that she was dismissing me like thatwhen
I knew DARNED well I met and spoke to this woman. So I kept asking her,
and Patty's mother became aggravated with me and told me (again) that there
was nobody in the house that day but us. There couldn't have been an old
lady at the table, she would have known it. She did say that the old lady
I seen sounded alot like her mother (Patty's Grandmother), but that was
impossible as she lived very far away. I did shut up then because I could
see how upset she was getting, and well, I was</b>
<br><b>4! I backed off.Think it was a day or two after that when I asked
my mother if I could go over Patty's house to visit when my mother knelt
down in front of me and told me how Patty and her family had to fly very
far away because Patty's Grandmother went to Heaven!We found out after
the fact that her mother always wore a yellow sweater and she had very
blue eyes. There were no pictures of her on the walls, so I had no way
or knowing that. (By the way, alot of this was put together by my parents
and Patty's mother after the fact.) I just remember the peaceful, kindly
old lady. :) Patty's mother got so wigged out because her motherlived in
Toronto and having a little girl saying they seen and spoke to your mother
when she's "supposed" to be in Canada could unnerve anybody! Her mother's
spirit apparently came to say goodbye to her family and I just happened
to be in the right place at the right time to see her. I can't express
how peaceful she looked when I first seen her, though. I was a very shy
child, so approaching her so freely was in itself, remarkable. I did not
make a habit of approaching strangers! But there was "something" about
this woman that drew me. It was the sense of peace and serenity that clung
to her, I guess. So there you go. Believe it or not, sports fans. :) I
personally have no doubt that death really is just another state of&nbsp;
being and we absolutely go on, so coming into contact with a person who
has, isn't always so foul and scary.</b>

<p><b>Pre-Natal Haunting</b>
<p><b>By: salimova@baku.oilfield.slb.com</b>

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I want to tell the story about me and my friend, which happened this
year.</b>
<br><b>In the end of February I received a call from my best friend, and
she said</b>
<br><b>that she's pregnant.. Thought she didn't want the child, she tried
all the</b>
<br><b>methods to miscarry... When she had an ultra-sonic scan, to find
out that</b>
<br><b>she was on 11th week and the baby was developing properly. A week
later she</b>
<br><b>had a room booked in the hospital. Two day before the event she
had a</b>
<br><b>dream, that a 6 year old boy standing in the rain under a street
light,</b>
<br><b>crying and asking her not to do so.. She decided if in the morning
of that</b>
<br><b>day will be raining, she won't do it, but for some reason she was
forced do</b>
<br><b>it a day earlier.&nbsp; After the abortion, the doctor said it was
a boy. And</b>
<br><b>then, the day after the abortion was a heavy rain... Also, she started</b>
<br><b>painting really good between 6th and 12th weeks, but stopped after
.. She</b>
<br><b>was never good with it, and I was always doing her drawings in the
college.</b>
<br><b>At the same time I've discovered that I am pregnant, and was placed
for</b>
<br><b>three weeks in bed to avoid miscarriage... I kept hearing strange
music,</b>
<br><b>had dreams about druids and ancient celts, even started learning
Irish..</b>
<br><b>During a day I was amazed to find words I heard in my dreams&nbsp;
in a Irish</b>
<br><b>dictionary.. To be correct, I was born and lived in Azerbaijan,
far far</b>
<br><b>away from Ireland and celts.. Suddenly this whole thing of voices
and</b>
<br><b>learning Irish stopped on 8th week, and a month later I had a miscarriage,</b>
<br><b>as my baby died exactly on 8th week..</b>
<br><b>And as I was writing this email, out translator told me that hew
grand</b>
<br><b>daughter who is 3 years old now told her a week ago:</b>
<br><b>"When I was in my mom's belly, why did you keep her hungry.. I wanted
to</b>
<br><b>eat, but you didn't feed my mom.."</b>
<br><b>She said her daughter was eating so much on the first trimester,
that she</b>
<br><b>was afraid for her health, and halved her food after a medical advise..</b>

<p><b>Jakes Experience</b>
<p><b>By: Seaairtx@aol.com</b>
<p><b>This Haunting is at a Furniture Store at Cleburne, Tx.right behind
the Wright Place. My daughter Amber rents this old building. When she moved
in she started hearing things,she thought it might be a homeless person
so she called the local police and they could not find anything on the
2nd floor.But she keep hearing the back door shut and someone walking up
the stairs.So on this day we went to the store my other daughter Fawn and
her husband Jake went up on the 2nd floor to look around. They were looking
when Jake saw a man standing by this staircase. Jake ask him what he was
doing up there and the man just look at him,then the man turned and started
down the staircase. Jake stared after him and the man was gone. Now this
staircase goes nowhere. Jake couldn't believe what he had seen since Jake
doesn't believe in ghost. As we where all leaveing we look up at one of
the windows and there stood a man looking back at us. There were 5 people
who saw this. Jake went to sit on a bench and a old man came and sit beside
him. The old man told Jake he saw people walking in these building all
the time. Jake didn't thank much about this old man, when Jake look off
and turned around the old man was gone. We all could not believe what had
just went on and still can't. But it seems like in this area of these old
building people have seen and heard Ghost around there.</b>

<br><b>My dog Cora</b>
<p><b>By: discodave1969@email.msn.com</b>
<p><b>I had a Doberman, a few years back, her was Cora,he was a great friend,she
used to sleep in bed with me all the time, well she still does, even though,
she died, she died in my house, a few days after she died, I buried her
in my back yard, about 2 days later, a friend and I were watching t.v.and
we heard her crying at the back door, as if when she was alive, we looked
at each other, with bright eyes, then we walked to the back door, and it
stopped!, I then opened the backdoor, and saw nothing, we thought it was
a fluke. But now I know it wasn't some sort of fluke, because,when I go
to bed,I shut my door,and lay down, I can feel her step onto the bed,and
lay down between my legs, that's where she slept, when she was alive, and
where she sleeps now. She does nothing to me, or to other people who go
to sleep on that bed, you can feel it, when she gets on the bed, my girlfriend,
said to me, as long as she is here, I don't care. she was always a great
friend, and always will be.</b>

<br><b>My Haunted Apartment</b>
<p><b>By: crumsey1@hotmail.com</b>
<p><b>Just to let you know from the start I am a firm believer in the paranormal.</b>
<br><b>Anytime anyone tells me their "stories" I listen intently with out</b>
<br><b>judgement, each individuals experiences vary from person to person
and time</b>
<br><b>to time.&nbsp; I also believe that I am very sensitive to "our friends"
on the</b>
<br><b>other side, however I don't open up enough to receive the full experience.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I (newlyweds then) moved to the Jacksonville FL area
around 3</b>
<br><b>1/2 years ago.&nbsp; We lived about 2 miles from the Mayport Naval
Station
(my</b>
<br><b>husband was a USN sailor).&nbsp; We rented a small 1 bedroom apartment.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>husband was always gone on short, 3 day to a 1 week, periodic deployments.</b>
<br><b>So when I was alone in the apartment I thought it was my mind playing
tricks</b>
<br><b>on me.&nbsp; I would feel like someone was in the shower (like showering
with</b>
<br><b>me), I would not look at the bathroom mirror any longer than I had
to (it</b>
<br><b>was way creepy, like someone was looking back at me).&nbsp; This
was just the</b>
<br><b>beginning.&nbsp; At first I did not tell my husband about these
"feelings", but</b>
<br><b>when I would ask where misplaced items were or who ate missing candy,
he</b>
<br><b>would say "oh the ghost did it or ate it".&nbsp; This was our little
(or so I</b>
<br><b>thought) joke and I did not think anything of it.</b>
<br><b>My husband was getting ready for a 2 week deployment when he finally
told me</b>
<br><b>that he thought there was more than the 2 of us "living" there...He
went on</b>
<br><b>to tell me that things would be moved from the place he last sat
them; like</b>
<br><b>his day runner, TV remote, or keys...things that were personal items.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>said at first he thought it was me and then realized that I would
either be</b>
<br><b>asleep or not at home when these "occurrences" were happening.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>relived to hear I wasn't the only one.&nbsp; I then confessed about
my "feelings"</b>
<br><b>he said he didn't think I was crazy or a wacko!&nbsp; However that's
when things</b>
<br><b>started getting extremely spooky.</b>
<br><b>I started noticing the same things, personal items missing or</b>
<br><b>misplaced..especially my car keys.&nbsp; It got to the point that
each time I</b>
<br><b>would have an appointment or deadline my keys would come up missing.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>would find them in the oddest places...under my bed, under my couch,
in the</b>
<br><b>refrigerator, or in a drawer.&nbsp; It felt like whoever it was
did not want me</b>
<br><b>to leave.&nbsp; At first I thought it might be my great-grandfather
I always felt</b>
<br><b>like he was my guardian angel, but then it was too annoying and
constant to</b>
<br><b>be a protective measure.</b>
<br><b>We got a puppy, she would not go into the bathroom, if her toys
bounced into</b>
<br><b>the bathroom she would lay at the bathroom door and cry.&nbsp; Our
pictures on</b>
<br><b>the walls started looking like other people (with that comment I
mean they</b>
<br><b>did not look like familiar faces, they were distorted), and like
they were</b>
<br><b>watching me.&nbsp; There was also an almost perfect round spot on
the carpet in</b>
<br><b>front of the fireplace, it was there when we moved in, I thought
it might be</b>
<br><b>a burn from the fireplace.&nbsp; The spot seamed to get darker,
at first I</b>
<br><b>thought it was just wear and dirt but even after vacuuming an steam
cleaning</b>
<br><b>it would not get any lighter or go away.&nbsp; The dog did not like
that spot</b>
<br><b>either she would avoid it at all costs. Up until this point it was
just weird feeling and missing items however it soon started to be much
moore.&nbsp; One day my husband was going to take the dog for a walk and
I was asleep under a comforter (on the bed), he came into the room and
gave me a kiss and told me he would be back later.&nbsp; I was half</b>
<br><b>asleep and barely acknowledged him.&nbsp; For what seemed a very
long time I felt</b>
<br><b>(what I thought was my husbands hands) a strong warmth on my back,
like</b>
<br><b>someone was holding their hands on my back on top of the comforter.&nbsp;
I woke</b>
<br><b>suddenly saying "your making me hot!" and noticed there was no one
in the</b>
<br><b>room or in the apartment for that matter.&nbsp; This shook me pretty
bad, but</b>
<br><b>when I was finally fed up with this was a week later.&nbsp; My husband
had left</b>
<br><b>for 2 weeks and I was working the graveyard shift, so I slept in
the middle</b>
<br><b>of the day.&nbsp; I was had just gotten into a light sleep when
I started feeling</b>
<br><b>like I was levitating about 2 feet off the bed.&nbsp; I woke with
a start, the</b>
<br><b>apartment was silent (a deafening silence) for this to be 3pm in
the summer,</b>
<br><b>it was way too quiet, I could not even hear the refrigerators hum.&nbsp;
The air</b>
<br><b>conditioner wasn't even on and remember this is Florida in summer.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>drenched in sweat.&nbsp; To this day I can't tell you for sure if
this was a</b>
<br><b>dream or real, but either way it scared the hell out of me.</b>
<br><b>My husband was gone so much that I felt alone and these strange
things were</b>
<br><b>so personal.&nbsp; I finally told a trusted friend.&nbsp; She asked
had I spoke to</b>
<br><b>this intity, I said "hell no it might talk back".&nbsp; I got to
thinking about</b>
<br><b>what she said "talk to it".&nbsp; The next day I had a doctors appointment
with a</b>
<br><b>specialist (with military insurance this is a rare occurrence) My
keys and</b>
<br><b>my purse were missing, as usual, I was searching for 20 minuets,
when I was</b>
<br><b>fed up I started yelling and cursing about my keys and how important
that</b>
<br><b>this appointment was and I stood in the center of the room looked
around one</b>
<br><b>last time and on the arm of the couch were my keys and purse (where
I had</b>
<br><b>left them).&nbsp; It was then that I realized the power of speech.</b>
<br><b>The next day that I decided to come out and tell the spirit that
I did not</b>
<br><b>want it there and wanted it banished from my home.&nbsp; I was standing
in my</b>
<br><b>kitchen (the bathroom was where it was strongest but I was too freaked
out</b>
<br><b>by it), on the counter was one of the wine glasses from our wedding
day</b>
<br><b>(this was one of the only things I had from our wedding day..we
did not have</b>
<br><b>a "wedding" we were married at the court house).&nbsp; I told the
spirit "I want</b>
<br><b>you to leave this is my home now and you need to go" I felt a lot
of</b>
<br><b>pressure and stress like I was in a crowded elevator.&nbsp; Then
I got a little</b>
<br><b>more bold and angry saying curses and shouting, (I wanted "it" to
see how</b>
<br><b>angry I was).&nbsp; Well I must have made "it" angry because my
precious wine</b>
<br><b>glass slid across the counter and was slammed onto the floor.&nbsp;
I say slammed</b>
<br><b>because I had dropped many glass items and they would sometimes
not break or</b>
<br><b>if they did it was only into 2 maybe 3 pieces, however this wine
glass was</b>
<br><b>shattered beyond recognition.&nbsp; This scared me.&nbsp; It seamed
the spirit was</b>
<br><b>capable of violence.&nbsp; I left with my dog and went to my friends
house for</b>
<br><b>the next 2 nights.</b>
<br><b>My friend and I talked about the occurrences, she suggest some old
Italian</b>
<br><b>wives tale, I figured I had nothing to loose.&nbsp; So I went and
bought two</b>
<br><b>boxes of salt, a broom, white candles and a loaf of bread.&nbsp;
We went into the</b>
<br><b>apartment and said a poem that we had made up...something about
we want you</b>
<br><b>to leave and go to the otherside...I don't remember exactly its
been almost</b>
<br><b>3 years ago. We said our poem over and over while throwing salt
on every</b>
<br><b>last inch of the apartment (according to the wives tale the salt
would</b>
<br><b>banish the spirit, that the spirit could not stay where the salt</b>
<br><b>was..because the salt was pure).&nbsp; Then we took the old broom
out and brought</b>
<br><b>in the new one along with the bread (the broom and the bread symbolizing
the</b>
<br><b>new living tenants of the dwelling) and candles.&nbsp; We lit the
candles and</b>
<br><b>said our poem and prayed to God and the Virgin to bless my home
and protect</b>
<br><b>me from evil spirits.&nbsp; Then I asked my priest to come and bless
my</b>
<br><b>apartment. After this my pictures looked like the regular old pictures
that I always</b>
<br><b>new, I no longer had freaky dreams, we even caught the dog sleeping
in the</b>
<br><b>bathroom occasionally, I felt comfortably alone in the bathroom
and in the</b>
<br><b>shower, but the weirdest thing was that the circle spot in the carpet</b>
<br><b>completely disappeared.If you would like to e-mail me with comments
or questions I would love to hear from you crumsey1@hotmail.com</b>

<br><b>Our Experience's.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: galleys@iprimus.com.au</b>
<p><b>We live in Australia and have a three year old son. Soon after he
was born I went into the nursery to find the blankets hanging neatly over
the high cot side with my son asleep in his cot. He was too tiny to have
acheived this himself and my husband had not done this.On another occasion,
one of our dogs was furiously barking and wouldn't be quiet! I went outside
to investigate to find that she was in her side of the garden with the
gate locked behind her neither myself or my husband had done this. One
evening the dog sat staring at a picture painted by my great Uncle for
quite some time.&nbsp; Today we were looking through some old home video's
and noticed something odd on one of them. Jack(my son) then around 10 months
old was crawling through the sliding doors onto the patio. Just after this
a small object can be seen speeding through the air at a low level in a
completely straight line hitting the wall of the house. It didn't appear
to be aiming at anything in particular but the dog was nearby although
she didn't notice it. When we played the video frame by frame we saw that
the object was a thin stick as long as a house brick. We can hear a slight
noise before it comes into the picture and then as it hit's the wall.</b>
