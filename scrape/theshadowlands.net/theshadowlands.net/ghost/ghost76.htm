</H3><P>
<P><B>By: name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had quite a few experiences with ghosts, in each place I have</B>
<P><B>worked I have seen a ghost, and my house is haunted by a small boy,
my</B>
<P><B>great granddad and a monk (!), although it has been fairly quite
recently.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, this story happened to me when I was 17.  It was around 1991
and I</B>
<P><B>was a trainee stylist at a hair salon in Essex in the UK.  It may help
if I</B>
<P><B>just tell you the layout of the place first  -  the salon was a large</B>
<P><B>rectangle with a door leading to a hallway on the left, doors led off
of</B>
<P><B>this hallway on the right, it was kitchen, toilet, boss' office and
then</B>
<P><B>the hallway opened up into a huge square where all the hair chemicals
and</B>
<P><B>the washing machine, etc were kept.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Everything in the salon was 'normal' and the haunting started quite</B>
<P><B>suddenly.  I used to feel as if I was being watched by a man from the
hall</B>
<P><B>doorway, I didn't like to be alone in the kitchen and I was petrified
to go</B>
<P><B>to the toilet alone  -  it felt as if someone was outside waiting for
me.</B>
<P><B>The feeling of fear used to intensify right by my boss' office door
and I</B>
<P><B>found that not only did I start to run past that door, but several
other</B>
<P><B>girls who worked there also did.  One day I was alone in the back
room</B>
<P><B>mixing up a haircolour and I was humming to myself (scared), when all
of a</B>
<P><B>sudden a huge can of hairspray came shooting through the doorway and
just</B>
<P><B>missed me.  I ran out of the doorway to see who had through the product
but</B>
<P><B>everyone was busy  -  when I checked the make of the spray it was one
we</B>
<P><B>never used.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The 'feeling' went on for about two weeks and I noticed that if I
looked</B>
<P><B>down the hallway I could see a man in black biking leathers and crash</B>
<P><B>helmet standing by my boss' door  -  he was standing facing me and
blocking</B>
<P><B>the hallway.  He was kind of see through but not misty, but if you
looked</B>
<P><B>straight at him you couldn't see him.  One day I decided I had to find
out</B>
<P><B>if anyone else could see him, so I hesitantly asked one of the others
girls</B>
<P><B>if she'd seen anything 'odd' lately, she remarked 'only the man in
the</B>
<P><B>hallway' .  I asked where and she said exactly where I had seen him,
and by</B>
<P><B>both of us talking we realised that we were both describing the man</B>
<P><B>perfectly, by then another girl came over and she'd overheard and said
that</B>
<P><B>she'd seen him too.  It turns out that we'd all seen him and felt
petrified</B>
<P><B>by his presence, but we'd all felt that the other would laugh or think
us</B>
<P><B>stupid if we said anything.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day we were at work and my boss was standing at the front of the
salon</B>
<P><B>when an old woman came in.  She told him she was a 'medium' and my
boss</B>
<P><B>jumped.  When asked why he'd jumped, my boss said that it felt as if</B>
<P><B>someone was standing right next to him, the medium replied that
indeed</B>
<P><B>someone was standing right next to him and that it was his best
friend.</B>
<P><B>This particular friend got killed one night whilst out on his
MOTORBIKE!!</B>
<P><B>Apparently, the friend knew that my boss was going to be in trouble
and was</B>
<P><B>here to help / comfort him.  She told us that our fearful feelings
were</B>
<P><B>because the man died so suddenly and unexpectedly and he was
'projecting'</B>
<P><B>his feelings and we were picking them up.    </B>
<P>
<P><B>Literally the next day we no longer felt the man's presence, it was
as if</B>
<P><B>he was glad that his friend  knew he was around and he just disappeared
as</B>
<P><B>quickly as he arrived.  By the way, the ghost was right about my boss
being</B>
<P><B>in trouble -  about six months later he was taken to court for sexual</B>
<P><B>harassment and indecent exposure  -  maybe he should have paid heed
to his</B>
<P><B>friends warning!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Sorry this has been such a long story and it isn't particularly scary,
but</B>
<P><B>I was covered in goose pimples all the time I was typing (so at least
it</B>
<P><B>scared me!!)</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several Experiences</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  netbreed</B>
<P>
<P><B>My personal favorite didn't actually happen to me, but I got to see(and
 smell)the aftermath.I </B>
<P><B>am a manager in a McDonalds which is located in a mall. Most nights
I don't get out until after</B>
<P><B> 10:00pm and that means that I have to sit at the transit mall across
the street for and hour </B>
<P><B>and a half waiting for a bus home(they only run every two hours after
7pm). The buses usually </B>
<P><B>start showing up around 11:20 or so.</B>
<P><B>Well on the night in question, my bus comes pulling up around 11:10,
and the driver pops out of </B>
<P><B>that vehicle like his butt is afire. Now I have ridden this bus for
4 years with this same driver</B>
<P><B> most of that time, and he is a nice, average guy who isn't prone to
stories, and he won't even </B>
<P><B>talk about this now. He calls me over and asks me to get on the bus
and see if I can smell </B>
<P><B>something. I got on and sure enough, it don't smell too good in there.
A sweet-icky nasty smell,</B>
<P><B> but it is not real strong though. Just barely there.</B>
<P><B>When I told him that yes I could smell something, he told me a truely
strange tale.We live in a </B>
<P><B>long narrow river-valley in the heart of the appalachian mountains.
The bus services several </B>
<P><B>smallish cities and towns up and down both sides of the river. His
run takes him west down one</B>
<P><B> side of the river to the transit mall, then east up the other side
of the river. He had just </B>
<P><B>started his run west to the transit mall when he stopped to pick up
a few people, so he had a </B>
<P><B>few people on the bus with him when he stopped a few miles further
down to pick up this one guy. </B>
<P><B>As he put it, drivers pick up a "sense" for people after a few years.
Something that tells them </B>
<P><B>this one might be a problem. This guy was perfectly normal, but he
set off the drivers internal </B>
<P><B>bells for some reason, so the driver was keeping an eye on him.</B>
<P><B>They got another few miles down the road when the people in the back
of the bus started </B>
<P><B>complaining of a smell, and opening windows. It wasn't long before
all the passangers, and the </B>
<P><B>driver all had windows open because the smell was quite strong, and
as I said, quite nasty. He </B>
<P><B>even got out of his seat at one stop and looked for something that
might account for it, but </B>
<P><B>couldn't find anyplace where the smell was stronger and might indicate
a source.</B>
<P><B>Eventually he hit the outskirts of the city, and all his passengers,
including the one he got a </B>
<P><B>bad feeling about had gotten off. Again he looked through the bus trying
to find that smell, and </B>
<P><B>couldn't find anything. He decided that since it was late and he usually
didn't pick up anyone </B>
<P><B>until the transit mall which was still a good six miles on up the road
that he would just turn </B>
<P><B>off all the internal lights and cruise into downtown with some windows
open and hope the smell </B>
<P><B>went away.</B>
<P><B>He had made it about half-way, when the buzzer indicating that someone
wanted off the bus went </B>
<P><B>off. He said out of habit because his mind was on something else, he
stopped the bus, and opened</B>
<P><B> the doors. No one got off, because no one was on the bus! This unnerved
him a little, but he </B>
<P><B>rationalized it on the spot as a short in the wiring, shut the doors
and off he went. Then he </B>
<P><B>realize that the awful smell that had plagued the bus for almost 30
miles, dispite open windows,</B>
<P><B>was starting to fade.</B>
<P><B>Now he started putting 2 and 2 together and not liking the sum one
bit! That was why he spent the</B>
<P><B> whole way into the transit mall hoping for someone to get on the bus
to verify that this smell </B>
<P><B>existed. I was the only passenger he had on the final leg of his last
run that night, and he </B>
<P><B>asked me to ride all the way to the end of the run with him and let
him drop me off at my stop </B>
<P><B>on the way back, this was how unnerved he was. I was off the next day
so I didn't mind not </B>
<P><B>getting home until almost 1am, so I did.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Most people that I tell this story too agree that this hapless busdriver
gave a ride to more than</B>
<P><B>just his paying fares that night. What is anyones guess, but it is
interesting to note that </B>
<P><B>there were no graveyards near either stop, and to my knowledge, nothing
obivious that would </B>
<P><B>explain it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That is my first story.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Ghostly past of Mine </B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  erinaldi@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi there, there are many people that know me that also know my story,
but they are mainly close friends and also people who can attest to what
I'm writing. </B>
<P>
<P><B>My tale begins where I was a young girl, around two or three years
of age, and I was nearing the </B>
<P><B>time when I was almost ready to move from my cot (a big one, which
was why I was still in it at </B>
<P><B>that age) to a proper single bed. I don't remember this, but my mother
told me a few years ago </B>
<P><B>when the "ghost" topic came up, that she would often pass by my room
to hers and hear me talking.</B>
<P><B> Normal that a toddler be talking at that age, right? Nope. Apparently
this was not the usual </B>
<P><B>toddler babble. This was fully coherent, intelligent conversation.
I would be sitting up in bed,</B>
<P><B> clutching a teddy-bear my grandmother had bought me and talking to
something that was sitting </B>
<P><B>across from the cot at the other side of the room. My guess was that
this presence I was chatting </B>
<P><B>with was sitting on my toy-box, which was made to look like a little
seat. My mother claims it </B>
<P><B>frightened her at first, but I seemed happy and unhurt and so she let
me be. She never told me </B>
<P><B>what I was talking about during those times though, only that is was
"almost as if [I] was an </B>
<P><B>adult talking to another...". That presence was one I came to recognize
as I grew up as a </B>
<P><B>friendly spirit, one I actually said hello to as I entered my room
on occasion, the feeling I </B>
<P><B>would get after that was always one of pleasantness and peace. </B>
<P><B>I suppose that was the beginning of my ghostly experiences. I must
explain about the house I grew</B>
<P><B> up in. It was built well before W.W.I, in a new suburb of Melbourne,
Australia. My room was </B>
<P><B>actually the main room and would have been the lounge or sitting room
when it was first used, it</B>
<P><B> was the most ornate and had its own fireplace. Across the long hallway
that ran from the living</B>
<P><B> room to the front door, was my parent's room and my little sisters
room. Down the hall we ended</B>
<P><B> up coming into the main lounge room and the dining room. That was
the original structure of the</B>
<P><B> house. The kitchen, bathroom and sun room were all later extensions
added in the 50's. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Back to my tale...the next occurrence of a ghostly experience I can
remember was playing with a </B>
<P><B>home-made Ouija board with my best friend, and being silly little girls
of about 10, we asked </B>
<P><B>the deadly question "How do we know you're really here?". Well...as
it turns out, music from the</B>
<P><B> now bricked-in fireplace started playing - it was a single saxophone
playing soft, relaxing </B>
<P><B>tunes. Although the sound wasn't in itself scary, the fact that it
was actually playing after </B>
<P><B>we asked scared us both out of our minds. The sound actually continued
for a few days before it</B>
<P><B> eventually faded out. When I was older, Id researched the deeds to
the house and asked around,</B>
<P><B> apparently there was a musician who passed away in that room of the
house in 1923. </B>
<P><B>The next event I remember clearly happened when I was about 12. I had
yet another friend sleep </B>
<P><B>over for a night. Around 2am I woke up with a start, to find a figure
standing in my doorway. </B>
<P><B>Instantly, it hit me that this was indeed a BAD presence and I started
sweating. The presence </B>
<P><B>was tall and menacing in its appearance though I couldn't see any
distinguishing features, the</B>
<P><B> one thing I do remember as clear as day was that he had a very bright,
glowing red aura about</B>
<P><B> him. That's what scared me the most. He was leaning against the left
side of the door frame,</B>
<P><B> casually a if he were waiting for me to get out of bed to get a closer
look. Of course, there</B>
<P><B> was NO WAY I was going to do that, so I lay there watching him watching
me until gradually, </B>
<P><B>he began to fade, he actually backed away from the door as he vanished.
</B>
<P><B>Anyway, once the figure had vanish I leaned over my bookshelf that
was at the end of my bed and </B>
<P><B>asked my friend if she was awake... all she said was "Did you see him?".
We both burst into </B>
<P><B>tears and she crawled into my bed. We both fell asleep huddled up,
too afraid to go to my parents</B>
<P><B> room. We have never been able to talk about that night. </B>
<P><B>That was also when the trouble with my younger sisters room began...
</B>
<P><B>From that time, whenever Id walk into my sisters room, I would get
chills and just feel as if </B>
<P><B>someone was watching everything I was doing. There were several occasions
when I'd even see </B>
<P><B>shadows moving across the walls or objects moving out of the corner
of my eye. I could never </B>
<P><B>spend more than five minutes in that room by myself, and I could never
go in there at night, </B>
<P><B>not by myself anyway. At first I thought my sister wasn't affected
by the presence, but I was</B>
<P><B> soon to be proven wrong. She suddenly started rocking herself to sleep
at night, but she would </B>
<P><B>do it so violently that she would occasionally hit the wall that the
bed was pushed up against,</B>
<P><B> and she would be making a constant "aahh-AAHH-aahh-AHH" sound that
would almost be droning. </B>
<P><B>When she was a little older and STILL doing it, I asked her why she
did it, she said "so I don't</B>
<P><B> see the lights that come and so I cant hear the noises". I burst into
tears, my little sister </B>
<P><B>was being terrorized and there was no one around who would believe
me. There was many times </B>
<P><B>during our lives in that house that I woke up, seemingly at the same
time as my sister would </B>
<P><B>sit up in bed herself, though not awake and just have her eyes open,
staring into space towards</B>
<P><B> my room. The first time she did I this I talked to her to see if she
was all right but there </B>
<P><B>was no response. Whenever this happened again, I would wake her up
and put her in my room on </B>
<P><B>the spare bed, she would never know why I was waking her up, but what
was happening was scaring</B>
<P><B> me and I didn't want her in that room anymore. One night I woke to
find her clawing at the wall,</B>
<P><B> trying to either crawl up/along it or away from something that was
scaring her - even then she</B>
<P><B> was still asleep though she woke up and burst into tears and I ran
into her room and begged to</B>
<P><B> sleep with me. From that night, whenever she wanted to sleep with
me, I let her, school night </B>
<P><B>or not. </B>
<P><B>To test to see if we were crazy, I had several of my friends stand
in the room to see for </B>
<P><B>themselves - I did this in broad daylight, not at night, and even then,
they felt very </B>
<P><B>uncomfortable. We weren't crazy. </B>
<P><B>The next and probably last major event that occurred in that house
before we moved was when I </B>
<P><B>was about 15. I was sitting at my desk, trying to concentrate on some
homework. My family had </B>
<P><B>gone shopping about twenty minutes beforehand and had let me stay home
to do my studies. I was</B>
<P><B> sitting at my desk which was pushed against the same wall the door
was on, in fact, when the </B>
<P><B>door was opened it would hit against the side of my desk which meant
it only opened to 90 degrees</B>
<P><B>, so I had a clear view into part of the hallway. Anyway, I was busily
trying to concentrate on</B>
<P><B> my homework when I heard someone running up the hall. I looked up
thinking I'd just missed </B>
<P><B>seeing the person run past my door. I yelled out for Erica, thinking
that she might have stayed</B>
<P><B> back and was playing around as younger siblings do. But there was
no reply, so I put it down to</B>
<P><B> my imagination again. But the noise happened over and over again.
I got rather nervous but went</B>
<P><B> to investigate...finding nothing. I gave up eventually and headed
out to the kitchen to do the</B>
<P><B> dishes (as is my normal chore). As I was washing up, I distinctly
heard the sound of someone </B>
<P><B>walking the length of the kitchen, the sound of bare feet on lino,
just that soft padding sound,</B>
<P><B> but it still made me uncomfortable, I looked over my shoulder and
saw nothing, so I just </B>
<P><B>continued with the dishes. </B>
<P><B>The moment after Id turned around I felt someone blow a stream of cool
air across the back of my</B>
<P><B> neck, I spun round, sending water everywhere and stared - at nothing.
To my dismay there was </B>
<P><B>nothing in the room. I was so tense I was actually at the point where
I was wishing there was </B>
<P><B>something I could see so I could scream and run from the house. As
it was, I calmly walked </B>
<P><B>outside and sat in the backyard playing with the dog until my family
returned home. </B>
<P><B>There was no more major occurrences of anything happening after that,
except for the fact that </B>
<P><B>something was still getting at my sister. That stopped as soon as we
moved, though it did take </B>
<P><B>a long while before my sister could fully relax in her bed in her new
room and fall asleep </B>
<P><B>naturally. </B>
<P><B>So far there has only been two different occurrences int he new house,
which happened in late </B>
<P><B>1997. They both happened on the same night - My friend from university
was over at my place and</B>
<P><B> we were studying late into the night working on a combined essay.
It was around 2am and me </B>
<P><B>friend was sleeping on the couch in the next room while I was typing
my part of the essay. </B>
<P><B>Suddenly she rushed in and said that she woke up and there was a white
figure leaning over her</B>
<P><B> and looking at her. She could only make out the shape of the face
and determined it was male,</B>
<P><B> he then vanished after a few minutes and that's when she ran out to
the kitchen. The second </B>
<P><B>occurrence happened about an hour and a half later, when I was taking
my break and having a nap.</B>
<P><B>..I had my back to the room and was woken up buy footsteps behind me...once
again, there was no</B>
<P><B> one there. This time I didn't feel uncomfortable though, and so was
able to remain calm and </B>
<P><B>went back to sleep, only to be woken up a couple more times, I turned
around to see a white </B>
<P><B>figure vanish into the hallway, I haven't seen it again since. </B>
<P>
<P><B>So that's my story, all true and all has happened within the space
of 18 years. I'm now 20 years</B>
<P><B> old - and waiting for the next one. </B>

<P><B>Haunted</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Neil Richardson </B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Brandi . I hadn't ever experiecned a hunting till my father
remarried and I started </B>
<P><B>living with them . My step-mother has been living in her home in TEXAS
for several years and has</B>
<P><B> many photograhs with globes and vortex . But that was not so weird
. I slept in my step-sisters</B>
<P><B> room with her on the bottom bunk . One night when I was super tried
iwent to bed late in the </B>
<P><B>nite. I layed down and closed my eyes and was bout to go to sleep when
I heard what sounded like</B>
<P><B> a rubber ball being bounded on the wall at the head of our bed. Which
is our brouthers room. </B>
<P><B>And seeing as he is a pest very often I got upset and headed to his
room tell him off. I went in</B>
<P><B> to his room and was about to let lose but I saw that he was asleep
and he is a hard sleeper to</B>
<P><B> wake. He was differently asleep. That weirded me out I just said ok,
and went back to the room.</B>
<P><B> It countined most of the nite I finally fell asleep at some point.
I don't hear it too often </B>
<P><B>but it still does it sometimes. There are other things that are creepy
like the lights dimming </B>
<P><B>on there own I can see the light swith in the room so there is no chance
of it being some playing</B>
<P><B> a prank. Other have seen it too. Alot of pictures have strange things
especially in the dinning</B>
<P><B> room , and some in the back yard . In fact we just had some pictured
developed and we have three</B>
<P><B> in which a ghostly firgure is hanging over my husband , daughter ,
and my head. </B>

<P><B>Another Ghost Story</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  Netbreed</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother and I moved to Colorado when I was fifteen. We had all our
stuff sent ahead of us, so </B>
<P><B>we had no furniture to use for a few weeks while I finished the last
of school, and my mother </B>
<P><B>made all the final arrangements. A friend of my mother's told us that
we could stay at her house</B>
<P><B>until we left.</B>
<P><B>Now I was not too happy with this notion because for as long as I can
remember this house had </B>
<P><B>given me the willies just because it is one of these victorian jobs
with all kinds of windows, </B>
<P><B>but a long dark hallway with not a single one. Better still her mother
had recently died and </B>
<P><B>strange stuff had started happening in the house.</B>
<P><B>A few months earlier while we were all eating at the kitchen table,
a light that was hanging on </B>
<P><B>the wall over the table just switched itself off. I was sitting right
under it when it did it and</B>
<P><B> I quite audibly heard that switch!! And when I reached up to turn
it back on, it was cold. This</B>
<P><B> light had been on for several hours, and should have been hot!</B>
<P><B>Well I should have learned about this spirits thing for lights right
there, but things just got </B>
<P><B>better.</B>
<P><B>The morning after we decended on Jane's house, I got up at 5am so that
I could take a bath and </B>
<P><B>wash my hair before I had to catch a bus at 6:45. I was the only one
up at that nasty hour. Now</B>
<P><B> Jane's bathroom is HUGE and has this oldfashioned clawfooted tub in
it. There is an overhead </B>
<P><B>light with a switch by the door, a lighted panel all the way around
the mirror with a switch </B>
<P><B>next to the mirror, and as a nightlight Jane kept a set of those cheesy
christmas candle lights</B>
<P><B> set on the back of the toilet with the switch on the cord. Now every
one of these light sources</B>
<P><B> is at least 3 to 5 feet from each other.</B>
<P><B>So I'm in the tub, minding my business, when I find myself in total
darkness!! And I do mean </B>
<P><B>TOTAL! Jane's house is out from anything on about 7 acres that she
owns. Best yet I HEARD that</B>
<P><B> light switch flip off!! Now I don't know if any of you have ever tried
to get out of a deep </B>
<P><B>clawfooted tub in total darkness with shampoo in your hair that is
trying to run into your </B>
<P><B>already blinded eyes, with this panicy feeling that someone else is
in this dark with you, but</B>
<P><B> I don't recomend it. Once I had the overhead back on, I turned ALL
the lights on, including the</B>
<P><B> cheesy christmas candle lights!</B>
<P>
<P><B>A few mornings later, the same thing happened, only this time I had
all the lights on. After </B>
<P><B>about the count of 10 or so while I am still trying to absord into
my brain that it happened </B>
<P><B>again, the light around the mirror goes out! I serious people I could
hear those switches being </B>
<P><B>flipped! Well tell you what! I got my butt out of that tub and had
the overhead back on before</B>
<P><B> the cheesy christmas candle went out, and yessir it did go out!</B>
<P><B>This became a moring ritual at this house. Not every morning but at
least 4 times a week.</B>
<P><B>Another thing that happened to me during those two weeks was the cabinette
door under the sink.</B>
<P><B> The way her kitchen was set up, to get to the fridge or the backdoor
you had to walk right past</B>
<P><B> that sink, and she had those old fashioned metal cabinettes. Well
the door would swing open </B>
<P><B>with enough force to put a bruise on my shins. And I mean a deep muscle
bruise here. That only </B>
<P><B>happened maybe three times thankfully, but that was enough to have
me almost climbing over the </B>
<P><B>kitchen table to avoid that sink.</B>
<P><B>These things only happened to me. Here is one that we all would see.</B>
<P><B>There is this old fashioned lamp on Jane's TV. It doesn't give off
much light but enough so that</B>
<P><B> you can see where your going. This lamp would flicker. And before
anyone says anything about </B>
<P><B>wiring or a short, no. Jane had the lamp checked and the wiring to
the house checked because she</B>
<P><B> started worrying about a fire.( This of course was after we had already
moved to Colorado.) And</B>
<P><B> it would do it when everyone was sitting down so no one was moving
around to jar the lamp. Jane</B>
<P><B> got remarried a few years later and moved out of the house (She still
owns it but her tenets </B>
<P><B>haven't said anything to her about lights or anything) and now the
lamp acts just fine.</B>
<P><B>It might also help to know that 6 months pior to all this Jane's mother
died. She was over 90 </B>
<P><B>and had bad dementia when she died, but she still remembered Jane,
and would beg her everytime </B>
<P><B>Jane visited her at the nursing home to let her go home. Two days after
she died Jane was</B>
<P><B> cleaning out her mother's room, and not being in the greatest health
herself, she got tired</B>
<P><B> and decided to lay down on the bed and take a nap. In her dream, she
said that she could see </B>
<P><B>the door to that bedroom as if she was laying on the bed. Well in walks
her mother about 20 years</B>
<P><B> younger with two suitcases. She looks right at Jane and says "I'm
finally home and now I am </B>
<P><B>staying." That was when Jane woke up!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Questions</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  gboller@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm writing to ask your opinion about some strange events at my house
over the last few years. </B>
<P><B>About once a month or so, we (my wife and I) hear the sounds of someone
walking upstairs, or on</B>
<P><B> the stairs leading to our living room. The sounds aren't simple
creaking...rather, they sound </B>
<P><B>"heavy" and always fool my wife and I into thinking that one of our
children has jumped out of </B>
<P><B>bed and is standing on the staircase (my kids' bedrooms are downstairs).
That is, there is a </B>
<P><B>strong feeling that someone is standing...you know how you feel a presence
when someone is </B>
<P><B>nearby? </B>
<P><B>Last year, I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night -- thinking
that someone was in the </B>
<P><B>bedroom...again, the same feeling of presence. There was an overpowering
smell of vanilla in the</B>
<P><B> air -- as if I had a bottle of vanilla extract under my nose. The
smell disappeared in less </B>
<P><B>than a minute. Needless to say, I had difficulty going back to sleep.
</B>
<P><B>My wife and I thought hard about when we first started experiencing
the sounds. We've been in </B>
<P><B>this house now since 1993 (the house itself was constructed in 1987
and we're the second owner).</B>
<P><B> In 1995, we purchased an antique chifarobe (beautiful piece with the
original mirror and the </B>
<P><B>original trouser hanger). It dates to the late 1920s, and comes from
New Jersey (or so the </B>
<P><B>dealer says). We believe that we started hearing the sounds shortly
after purchasing the </B>
<P><B>chifarobe. </B>
<P><B>In your experiences, have you ever heard of spirits accompanying antique
furniture? Why would a </B>
<P><B>spirit do this? Also, have you ever heard of a "visit" accompanied
by the smell of vanilla? Do </B>
<P><B>particular smells signify anything? My wife and I think that if it
is a ghost paying us a visit</B>
<P><B> from time-to-time, it may be a woman. </B>
<P><B>I would really like to hear your opinion, and any advice you might
have on how we might find out</B>
<P><B> more about our visitor. </B>

<P><B>What They Saw</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  MKBALG@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> All of my family pretty much </B>
<P><B>lived in its own little neighborhood.  This neighborhood had the weirdest
</B>
<P><B>things happen to it for most of my family had some really strange
beliefs</B>
<P><B>and so on.  Well one night my dad, who is not too swayed by the idea
that things </B>
<P><B>can happen without explanation, and my uncle, who was deeply in to
the </B>
<P><B>beliefs of the "other world", was driving down the hill that circled</B>
<P><B>around a little drive that was in front of my grandmothers house. 
 What they saw</B>
<P><B>will always be some sort of mystery because my dad came back so white
faced that </B>
<P><B>to this day I cant wipe that image out of my head.  They looked toward
my </B>
<P><B>grandmothers house and right below where the skirting of the house
usually</B>
<P><B>is for mobile homes there was a little girl with no face and in a little
white </B>
<P><B>gown rocking back and forth in a little rocker shaking her head back
and </B>
<P><B>forth.  Again they said that she had no face but they couldnt turn
away from </B>
<P><B>her for she was drawing them to come closer and closer until finally
my dad </B>
<P><B>just decided to get out of there as fast as he could for whatever
reason</B>
<P><B>they were going to my grandmothers house for could wait until later.
 I could </B>
<P><B>never imagine why this happened but this is among the many things that
</B>
<P><B>happened in that area.  I'm not sure if it is because so many of my
relatives </B>
<P><B>were into the "unknown" or what.  But I guess they say that it does
open</B>
<P><B>your eyes to a whole new world when you are into the other things.
