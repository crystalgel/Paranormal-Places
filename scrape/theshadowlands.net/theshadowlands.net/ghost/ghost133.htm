<p><b>By: DeXtEr312@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>March 12th, 1994--My 16th Birthday.</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was just a regular old birthday...a few friends came to my house
for cake</b>
<br><b>and ice cream, along with myself, my sister, and my 15 year old
cousin.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>all had our cake and ice cream and decided to go to a movie.&nbsp;
Having had my</b>
<br><b>"restricted license" for a year at that point, I was of course ALL
FOR IT</b>
<br><b>lol...This would be my first time driving a car after dark without
an adult.</b>
<br><b>Well, anyway, we all head to the local movie theater which is about
20</b>
<br><b>minutes from my house.&nbsp; We go and watch our movie, then everyone
starts</b>
<br><b>heading home.&nbsp; My friend Melissa, and my best friend Kevin
and I all piled</b>
<br><b>into my mothers Crown Victoria and headed home.&nbsp; We're driving
along all</b>
<br><b>three of us in the front seat of the car, talking, laughing, and
cutting up</b>
<br><b>as most 16 year olds do.&nbsp; The road we were driving down is
called Pine Log</b>
<br><b>Road.&nbsp; It's a pretty long road as it runs from Clearwater,
SC through to</b>
<br><b>Aiken, SC.&nbsp; Probably about a 25 minute ride (if you are actually
abiding by</b>
<br><b>the posted speed limits ).&nbsp; Well anyway, We're riding along...laughing
and</b>
<br><b>cutting up...when I come to one portion of the road that is down
hill, and at</b>
<br><b>the bottom a fairly sharp curve.&nbsp; This is one of the few spots
on that road</b>
<br><b>that are fairly well lit that isnt in a populated area, due to the
fact that</b>
<br><b>just at the bottom of the hill and across the street is a concrete
plant or</b>
<br><b>something like that....anyway, its well lit.&nbsp; I was coming
to the bottom of</b>
<br><b>the hill and all of the sudden, Melissa belts out a Blood curdling
scream...I</b>
<br><b>look back to the road and see a man walking dead center of the lane
I am in.</b>
<br><b>He was wearing an old army type jacket, Camoflauge pants, and had
a green</b>
<br><b>hood pulled over his head.&nbsp; I of course swerve amongst Melissa,
kevin's and</b>
<br><b>my own screams, run off the road and screech to a halt.&nbsp; I
realized that I</b>
<br><b>had HIT&nbsp; the man, and my heart sank into my stomache.&nbsp;
I just KNEW I had hit</b>
<br><b>him.&nbsp; There was NO WAY he got out of the way in time....and
even though I</b>
<br><b>swerved...my car went skidding sideways towards him.&nbsp; There
was NO way I got</b>
<br><b>past him or him past me.&nbsp; Melissa, kevin and I get out of the
car and run</b>
<br><b>back to where the man had been to see if he was ok, or if I'd killed
him, or</b>
<br><b>what.&nbsp; When we got to the spot which was about 10 feet from
where the car had</b>
<br><b>stopped...he wasnt there...I felt relieved, but then my thoughts
went in</b>
<br><b>another direction...I KNEW I'd hit him...and besides that...Where
was he?&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>wasn't still walking up the road ...he wasnt IN the road....and
he wasnt on</b>
<br><b>the side of the road...I went back to the car and got my flashlight
and</b>
<br><b>started looking...The only place he could be was in the woods on
the side of</b>
<br><b>the road...</b><b></b>
<p><b>Melissa and Kevin and I went into the woods (I mean come on...I wasnt
ABOUT</b>
<br><b>to go in there alone...), and started looking...We got probably
about 20 feet</b>
<br><b>into the woods and then we all stopped where we were.&nbsp; Melissa
turns to me</b>
<br><b>and says "Maybe we all just imagined it..." and about the time she
finished</b>
<br><b>saying it...we heard a low moan...We all three took off in the direction
of</b>
<br><b>the moan hoping to find the man, because if I had hit him, he was
probably in</b>
<br><b>need of some help.&nbsp; We all three keep heading towards the moan....but
then we</b>
<br><b>were back at the side of the road...We all stood quietly hoping
to hear it</b>
<br><b>again as maybe we just went the wrong way...and we heard it again....but
this</b>
<br><b>time it was louder.&nbsp; And it was in the woods again.&nbsp; We
headed back in and</b>
<br><b>kept heading towards the sound.&nbsp; We were calling out for him
to keep talking</b>
<br><b>so that we might find him, but the moans were all we heard from
him.&nbsp; When we</b>
<br><b>got to where we had been after heading into the woods the first
time...the</b>
<br><b>moans stopped.&nbsp; At this point, we are all pretty freaked out,
and none of us</b>
<br><b>knew what to think.&nbsp; Melissa is getting really scared and is
not bothering</b>
<br><b>trying to hide it...and I must admit so am I...We all agreed to
go home and</b>
<br><b>call for help because there was no one we could find the man alone...and
as</b>
<br><b>we turned around to head back we saw the man standing at he edge
of the woods</b>
<br><b>beside the road.&nbsp; Of course we all jump about 30 feet into
the air, but when</b>
<br><b>I shine the light on him, he was gone.&nbsp; I believe it was at
that point that</b>
<br><b>we all three began running towards the car using several different
words that</b>
<br><b>our mothers wouldn't have approved of....got into the car and high
tailed it</b>
<br><b>to my house.&nbsp; I told my mother that night what had happened,
and she smiled</b>
<br><b>and said "You didnt hit him".&nbsp; I didnt understand her smile
or her saying</b>
<br><b>that...so I asked her.&nbsp; She told me that she had heard of a
couple of other</b>
<br><b>times that people claimed to have had similar experiences.&nbsp;
She then said</b>
<br><b>that it was probably some drunk wandering and that We had just thought
we saw</b>
<br><b>him standing at the edge of the woods....just caught up in the moment.&nbsp;
So I</b>
<br><b>just chalked it up to it being just that.&nbsp; An over active imagination.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>still believed it for a while after that...until I turned 19 and
went to the</b>
<br><b>local college.&nbsp; I met a girl there named Cayce.&nbsp; Her older
brother had a</b>
<br><b>REALLY bad car accident in that same spot when I was in middle school.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>claimed that some man was walking down the center of the road and
he swerved</b>
<br><b>to miss hitting him, and flipped his jeep.&nbsp; I never told Cayce
about it...and</b>
<br><b>when I met her brother I asked him about it.&nbsp; He described
the guy that I</b>
<br><b>thought I had hit...same clothes, same dissappearance.&nbsp; I dunno...Maybe
it</b>
<br><b>wasnt a "ghost", Maybe it was just an over-active imagination...maybe
someone</b>
<br><b>slipped something into my drink at the movies...but if it was...Why
wasnt I</b>
<br><b>the only one to have seen him as I have heard other stories since
then from</b>
<br><b>other people, not to mention the other two people that were WITH
me when I</b>
<br><b>saw him?&nbsp; Why was there NO MAN around when we went looking?&nbsp;
I mean the woods</b>
<br><b>we were in werent exceptionally deep or thick...</b><b></b>
<p><b>In my personal opinion...there's no way that it was a MAN I saw that</b>
<br><b>night...There was NO WAY he got out of the way fast enough....and
to this</b>
<br><b>day...I wont go down that road alone at night...and even during
the day I</b>
<br><b>feel as though someone has walked over my grave when I pass that
spot.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Maybe you have a personal take on my story, could offer some insight,
or</b>
<br><b>maybe just have some ideas on how I could find out more about what</b>
<br><b>happened...anything would be appreciated.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>The Lady in a Red Dress</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Colel94@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was 15 years old in 1978, my sister lived in this small house in
West</b>
<br><b>Warwick Rhode Island.&nbsp; One night she was going out and she
needed a baby</b>
<br><b>sitter for my niece, so I went over there and she was getting ready.
I asked</b>
<br><b>her where her T.V. guide was she said that it was up on the nightstand
in her</b>
<br><b>bedroom, so I walked to the stairs, now as you walk though the archway,
you</b>
<br><b>have the front door to your left and a wall in front of you, you
take a sharp</b>
<br><b>right and there were the stairs, so I started up the stairs and
had to take</b>
<br><b>one more sharp right. Before I took the last step I looked in my
sisters</b>
<br><b>bedroom and saw some lady laying on her bed, I could see her because
the lamp</b>
<br><b>was on in the bedroom.&nbsp; She was looking right at me with a
little smile on</b>
<br><b>her face, like she was waiting to see what my reaction would be.&nbsp;
She had one</b>
<br><b>of those bee-hive hair do's with strawberry blonde hair, she was
in her</b>
<br><b>thirties and had one of those old fashioned glittery red dresses
on.&nbsp; You</b>
<br><b>could tell her legs were crossed because of the way the impressions
were in</b>
<br><b>her dress.&nbsp; What was really wierd was that I could see she
had green eyes,</b>
<br><b>with such little light on.&nbsp; Then it was like I blinked and
she was gone, so,</b>
<br><b>thinking I was just seeing things, I walked over to the nightstand
and picked</b>
<br><b>up the T.V. Guide, went back down stairs and sat on the couch looking
in the</b>
<br><b>T.V. guide.&nbsp; My sister was sitting in the chair putting her
shoes on and I</b>
<br><b>said chuckling, "you know your house is haunted, I saw some lady
laying on</b>
<br><b>your bed". She stopped putting her&nbsp; shoes on and said "don't
say that" I</b>
<br><b>asked her why and then she said " because we hear people walking
around here</b>
<br><b>at night". I never heard anything more about it, but I do believe
there are</b>
<br><b>ghosts walking the earth waiting for Judgement Day.</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>The Man In Black</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sweetpea69_88@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night not too long ago a friend and I went to a</b>
<br><b>known haunted cemetary called the Gates of Hell in</b>
<br><b>Elizabethtown, Kentucky.&nbsp; I've always had a fear of</b>
<br><b>this place, not because of the rumours about it, but</b>
<br><b>because of the feeling I get whenever I am there (you</b>
<br><b>know, the feeling like someone or something is</b>
<br><b>watching you and is following you wherever you go).</b>
<br><b>I've always had a very strong sense when it comes to</b>
<br><b>ghosts and things, but tonight it was overwhelming.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>don't like getting out of the car here, same feeling</b>
<br><b>once again, but for some reason something seemed to be</b>
<br><b>pulling me from the car.&nbsp; I got out and ventured</b>
<br><b>toward the graves, thankfull I wasn't shaking this</b>
<br><b>time, and began to walk through the cemetary.&nbsp; All of</b>
<br><b>a sudden, I stopped dead in my tracks and started</b>
<br><b>shaking like a leaf.&nbsp; My friend asked what was wrong,</b>
<br><b>and seeing that I was completely unresponsive, reached</b>
<br><b>for my hand to try to jostle me from my trance.</b>
<br><b>Meanwhile, back to me, I was focusing on a certain</b>
<br><b>spot in the forest behind the cemetary, and watched in</b>
<br><b>frozen horror as a man, I think it was a man, emerged</b>
<br><b>from the shadowy woods.&nbsp; I don't know if it was a</b>
<br><b>human or a ghost, my thoughts are leaning toward</b>
<br><b>ghost, but whatever it was scared the hell out of me.</b>
<br><b>As my friends' hand touched mine, I woke out of my</b>
<br><b>trance, and seeing that figure was still there, and</b>
<br><b>moving closer at this point, turned on one heel and</b>
<br><b>sped towards the car so fast I could have won the Indy</b>
<br><b>500 with time to go around 10 more laps.&nbsp; As we sped</b>
<br><b>out of that place, the figure followed us and started</b>
<br><b>chasing us down the road.&nbsp; About 2 miles away from</b>
<br><b>there, our car suddenly broke down and we were forced</b>
<br><b>out of the car to find out what was wrong.&nbsp; At that</b>
<br><b>point, the clouds started bubbling up like they do in</b>
<br><b>horror films when something bad is about to happen,</b>
<br><b>and a horrible gust of wind blew us over into the</b>
<br><b>nearby brush.&nbsp; When it was all over, we found a piece</b>
<br><b>of a tombstone with the name, "Johnny" carved into it,</b>
<br><b>laying as lifeless as its owner on the passenger side</b>
<br><b>of the back seat.&nbsp; Since neither of us took the</b>
<br><b>tombstone, we were at a loss as to what to do with it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Unfortunately, we had to venture back there to return</b>
<br><b>it to its' rightful owner, at least I hope that was</b>
<br><b>its' rightful owner.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Basement Noises</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sweetpea69_88@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; When I was about five years old eight people</b>
<br><b>including myself lived in a home in Rineyville on a</b>
<br><b>farm. We had this big beautiful white house with a two</b>
<br><b>car garage. Anyway, in the basment/garage, was a big</b>
<br><b>section in the back that had a cloth covering it. When</b>
<br><b>my sister and I would ask my grandfather about it he</b>
<br><b>would always tell us not to go back there. Well a few</b>
<br><b>days after he told us that, my sister being the oldest</b>
<br><b>and the bully, started up with all kinds of things</b>
<br><b>like there was monsters back there who ate little</b>
<br><b>kids. Well, one day I was asked to go down there and</b>
<br><b>get my grandfather to tell him to come upstairs for</b>
<br><b>dinner. I opened the basment door and yelled down to</b>
<br><b>him. No one answered. As I started down the steps I</b>
<br><b>heard a noise, but the garage door was closed and</b>
<br><b>hadn't been opened. So I started to look around at</b>
<br><b>yell for him. Then all of a sudden I had this very</b>
<br><b>uncomfortable feeling in my stomach and chest. My</b>
<br><b>heart was pounding and the little hairs on the back of</b>
<br><b>my neck were standing up. If felt as though it was a</b>
<br><b>little hard to breath. As I rushed up the steps I felt</b>
<br><b>like someone was right behind me, so I got to the top</b>
<br><b>of the stairs and I couldn't get the door open. I</b>
<br><b>screamed and yelled begging for someone to open the</b>
<br><b>door. Finally someone did, I jumped up the stairs and</b>
<br><b>ran into the kitchen and there was my grandfather</b>
<br><b>eating dinner, and he had been eating it for a while</b>
<br><b>judging by the looks of his plate. I asked him if he</b>
<br><b>was ever down there and he said no. I told him that I</b>
<br><b>thought that I heard him in there and he said no that</b>
<br><b>he was not down there at all that day, he had gone out</b>
<br><b>most of the day. From that day on, I could not and</b>
<br><b>still can not go into a basement without getting that</b>
<br><b>feeling....the feeling that someone is there following</b>
<br><b>me around the house trying to tell me something or do</b>
<br><b>something to me, anything is possible. It's like I</b>
<br><b>always say, you can't be afraid of somehting if you</b>
<br><b>don't know it's there, but this time I know it was and</b>
<br><b>still is with me. I never lose that feeling.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>A Haunting in New Orleans</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: lovestocook@cox-internet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had many strange encounters with the "spirit world" in my
lifetime, but by far the worst experience was when I lived in New Orleans,
on the West Bank, in base housing.&nbsp; It has haunted me to this very
day. When I moved into the house, I noticed the linoleam floors were veryyellow
in places, which I attributed to a build-up of wax, but was never able
to quite get rid of.&nbsp; I was told later that there had been a fire
in the house, but was not given any details. From the moment my children
and I moved into that apartment, I realized it had been a very</b>
<br><b>bad mistake. I had been given a kitten as a present by my brother,
and the kitten (later, cat) turned out to be the cat from hell.&nbsp; He
would scratch my children at night while they were sleeping, and when I
had him declawed, he would bite them.&nbsp; He would look at the walls
and movehis head, like he was looking at something, and then yowl very
loudly.&nbsp; I finally had to give him away.&nbsp; After this, I got two
more kittens,who would also look at the walls, and stare at other things,
like there was something there, all the while moving their heads and eyes
to</b>
<br><b>follow whatever it was they were looking at.&nbsp; When I would
go to sleep at night, I would feel very distinctly that there were invisible
animals jumping on the end of my bed, and turning around like they were
curling up to go to sleep.&nbsp; Then, in the middle of the night, therewould
come a terrible scream in the night, like the scream of a banshee, directly
into my ear, making me jump out of my bed in fear.&nbsp; ne night the children
came running into my room.&nbsp; They had seen the light switch in the
hall moving up and down, and swore they saw two</b>
<br><b>children, a boy and a girl, playing in the hallway, kicking a ball
and laughing.By this time, I had had enough, and asked to move, which wasrefused.&nbsp;
I couldn't say why, for fear of looking foolish.&nbsp; I then consulted
a friend, who claimed to be a psychic.&nbsp; She told me about acertain
phrase to say, and some things to do, which I am not at liberty to divulge.&nbsp;
So when the strange things happened again in the middle of the night, I
did what I was advised to do, sitting up in bed.&nbsp; Suddenly, the whole
room seemed as if a hurricane ran through it, everything was knocked down
from the force of the wind.&nbsp; At that very moment, I felt a great relief
and a peace, and the hauntings did not happen again.&nbsp; I now keep a
cruisifix above my bedroom door, in the hopes that nothing</b>
<br><b>like that will ever happen again. By the way, I found out later
that a fire HAD been in my apartment; One Christmas eve, a Christmas tree
caught on fire, and two children had perished when their parents couldn't
save them...I'm still afraid of the dark...</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=+1>And yet another story</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: peas@nf.sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Pat and this story took place when I was a young girl.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't remember exactly when it started.&nbsp; I know I was a young
teen</b>
<br><b>about 12 or 13 the first time I felt a something in my Aunt's home.&nbsp;
In</b>
<br><b>one particular bedroom upstairs at the end of the hall you would
be in</b>
<br><b>bed alone and you could feel someone get into bed with you.&nbsp;
When you</b>
<br><b>looked at the other side of the bed no one was there.&nbsp; You
could see the</b>
<br><b>indent in the pillow as if someone was lying there.&nbsp; I felt
no fear</b>
<br><b>although being a child I was scared of&nbsp; something I couldn't
explain.</b>
<br><b>My cousin also would experience this as well.&nbsp; In the nights
you would</b>
<br><b>feel cold winds, and curtains would move&nbsp; but no windows would
be open.</b>
<br><b>The hallway upstairs ran the full width of the house.&nbsp; At different</b>
<br><b>times you would be setting downstairs in the livingroom and there
would</b>
<br><b>be no one upstairs and you could hear someone walking back and forth
but</b>
<br><b>yet could see no one or explain it.&nbsp; This continued on for
several</b>
<br><b>years.&nbsp; When I would ask about it the grownups would of course
deny ever</b>
<br><b>hearing or feeling anything.&nbsp; My cousin and I became very comfortable</b>
<br><b>with whatever it was and would speak to it.&nbsp; Sometimes it would
go and</b>
<br><b>way and some more times it would.</b>
<br><b>When I was about 18 my cousin and I was home alone.&nbsp; At about
midnight</b>
<br><b>we hear the footsteps upstairs again. You could tell they were walking</b>
<br><b>across the hall and stopping for a moment at the top of the stairs.</b>
<br><b>This went on for about and hour...I think one of the longest time
ever.</b>
<br><b>The way the living room is sat up my cousin was sitting in her chair
and</b>
<br><b>could not see the bottom of the stairs..I was sat on the chesterfield</b>
<br><b>and had a clear view.&nbsp; When it made its last trip across the
hallway I</b>
<br><b>heard it start down the stairs..all of a sudden I saw a white hand
on</b>
<br><b>the bannister..I said to my cousin look and then it was gone.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>didn't see it.&nbsp; I used to always refer to it as a she I don't
know why</b>
<br><b>but it seemed right.</b>
<br><b>After that night we never saw, heard or felt anything again.&nbsp;
That was</b>
<br><b>18 years ago.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for listening.</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: NCyclapdia@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live near to a school. I know that school is haunted. I even saw
the ghost.</b>
<br><b>It is big, dark, and has a big, ax, with three sharp blades on one
side, one</b>
<br><b>big blade on one side and a spike on top. His ax sometimes chases
people, but</b>
<br><b>if you get off the school block it will stop and vanish.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was killed by some person who pushed him onto
a stove. Those people</b>
<br><b>would make fun of him and call him Brutus. He sometimes hypnotizes
people,</b>
<br><b>but they are not usually him victims. He sometimes is seen in the
day time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day some of my friends were walking by the
school and we heard a loud</b>
<br><b>scream. One of my friends said "I'm getting out of here" and ran
away</b>
<br><b>screaming. We went up to the door and saw him. Then we saw a person
walk up</b>
<br><b>to the door knock three times and say :"Brutus Brutus Brutus" then
Brutus</b>
<br><b>came out and threw the ax ,but that person disappeared.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then next day we came did the knock and he came
and we ran. He threw his</b>
<br><b>glowing ax and the lights flashed out. I heard a loud screaming
noise and it</b>
<br><b>got foggy. I just ran and soon the fog disappeared. I noticed I
wasn't on the</b>

<br><b>had just moved out of&nbsp; my Mom's place, and she and I never
get along, and it</b>
<br><b>was just great to be able to come home to a peaceful, quiet, atmosphere.</b>
<br><b>Anyway......</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night&nbsp; I heard a constant knocking on my kitchen window.
I had not lived</b>
<br><b>there long, and sometimes people came by to look for the previous
tenants.</b>
<br><b>So, being a single female living alone, unless someone calls first,
I never</b>
<br><b>answer the door&nbsp; or the window : ) Unfortunately, a month or
so before my</b>
<br><b>brand new car had been broken into. When I heard the banging outside,
I did</b>
<br><b>not go and see what is was. And much to my chagrin, my car had been</b>
<br><b>vandalized. So on the night in question, when I heard the constant
banging, I</b>
<br><b>immediately got up ! I did not want a repeat of getting my car broken
into.</b>
<br><b>Bang Bang Bang...I was aroused from my peaceful sleep, I decided
to go to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom before looking out of the window. I was not too concerned,
because</b>
<br><b>at 3:30am, I knew it was NOT for me. When I was in the bathroom,
I heard my</b>
<br><b>microwave oven beep. I was not concerned, because it has never kept
time. If</b>
<br><b>you set the clock, several hours later it will beep beep beep and
lose the</b>
<br><b>time. I left the bathroom walked down the hall and into my dark
living room.</b>
<br><b>Just as I was about to turn the corner to go into the kitchen to
look out of</b>
<br><b>the window, I will swear to this day, I heard a young female voice
say, "Shhhh</b>
<br><b>hhhh, she will hear us". It was coming from my kitchen !&nbsp; I
live alone !&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>had a feeling there were 2 young females and a man in my kitchen.
It scared</b>
<br><b>me half to death. I knew instantly there was no one alive in my
kitchen. My</b>
<br><b>way of dealing with ghost is to ignore them. So, I pretended not
to be</b>
<br><b>startled and proceded into the kitchen, and looked out of the window.
Nothing</b>
<br><b>there of course. And of course, no one was in my kitchen.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I went back to bed, and just laid there until I fell asleep. For
several</b>
<br><b>nights after that, I would hear the banging on my kitchen window.
I never got</b>
<br><b>up to check. After about 3 nights of this, I realized the banging
was not on</b>
<br><b>my kitchen window. It wasn't even on this "dimensional plane". I
realized</b>
<br><b>that if someone was knocking on my kitchen window, it would be much
much</b>
<br><b>louder and more obvious.&nbsp; Maybe they were knocking on a window
that did not</b>
<br><b>exist anymore...I don't know. The scariest thing happened when one
night, I</b>
<br><b>was once again awakened by the constant banging. I tried to get
up only to</b>
<br><b>realize "Some THING" was holding me down. It was a man ( I could
not see him)</b>
<br><b>and with a husky voice said, " NO ! YOU WILL SCARE HER AWAY ! ".
I instantly</b>
<br><b>knew he did not want me to get up and go into the kitchen because
I would</b>
<br><b>scare the ghost of one of the girls away. He was protecting her.
Can you</b>
<br><b>believe that !!!!!!! I would scare her !!! She is the ghost !!!!!&nbsp;
Silly, as</b>
<br><b>it sounds, I immediately became annoyed, because I could not believe
that I</b>
<br><b>was being held down to my bed because I would scare away a ghost,
and not the</b>
<br><b>other way around. I don't know much after that, I must have gone
back to</b>
<br><b>sleep. One night after that, I got up to get something to drink
and&nbsp; when I</b>
<br><b>walked into my kitchen, it was like a walked into a much thicker
atmosphere</b>
<br><b>than any other part of the house. I immediately got a headache,
and had the</b>
<br><b>over-whelming feeling I was not welcomed in the kitchen. Once again,
I</b>
<br><b>pretended not to notice. Took a swig of milk out of the carton,
and returned</b>
<br><b>to bed. I lay there with the lights on until I fell asleep. It was
a long</b>
<br><b>time before I felt comfortable in my apartment again. I am finally
feeling</b>
<br><b>better here. This happened last April '99 and now April is coming
up again. I</b>
<br><b>don't want a repeat performance. I hope April comes and goes without</b>
<br><b>incident. I told you it would not scare you. But if you have any
comments</b>
<br><b>please email me</b>
<br><b>I would especially like to hear the comments of Wiccans. Blessed
Be.</b>

<p><b>ok, here goes, Iam 16 now, when I was 15 I slept in my brothers room
(mine</b>
<br><b>was still being built) I went to sleep around 3:00 as always (internet</b>
<br><b>games) I had just fallen asleep when I heard the noise of crkiling</b>
<br><b>magazine, like someone was steping on it, I had this chill and my
whole body couldnt</b>
<br><b>move, I felt as something was taking my energy, I wanted to swing
around</b>
<br><b>really fast and try to hit what ever it was but I couldnt move,
then I</b>
<br><b>felt my blanket being pulled off from behind, very slowly, I wanted
turn but I</b>
<br><b>couldnt move, I wanted to scream but I couldnt, I just felt cold
and</b>
<br><b>motionless. This has happened to me before, when I used to sleep
in a room</b>
<br><b>(that was later tore down) I was on my bed when I felt like I couldnt</b>
<br><b>move, my whole body felt weak, like I was being drawn down, like
I was dieing, I</b>
<br><b>tried to move, I strugled as hard as I could and I beat it, that
time, I</b>
<br><b>got up and I could feel myself come back to, I know It wasnt a dream
because I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;even thought about it not being a dream</b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Poltergeist</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Womanofscience@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened when I moved in with a room-mate in Huntington Beach,
CA. My</b>
<br><b>room-mate was an atheist. Not because of any intellectual or rational
reason,</b>
<br><b>but because she had a troubled childhood. I was living on my own
again and</b>
<br><b>was somewhat anxious to be so far away from anyone I knew. My nearest</b>
<br><b>relative or friend was 55 miles away in another county. Our newest
room-mate,</b>
<br><b>Michelle just moved in, and she had a troubled childhood and marriage.
Just</b>
<br><b>to give an idea of the pesonalities and troubles in what was our
personal</b>
<br><b>lives. I think all the worry, trouble, sadness, opened a door to
poltergeist</b>
<br><b>activities. I am now Wiccan, at the time I was a Christian, and
I was trying</b>
<br><b>to tell my room-mate, in the usual annoying Christian way, that
"Jesus was</b>
<br><b>the answer to everything".&nbsp; When she tired of my fundamentalist
rantings she</b>
<br><b>yelled, " F**K you and your Jesus ! "&nbsp; And no pun intended,
but "All Hell</b>
<br><b>Broke Loose".</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hell broke loose in our house the next day. It all started when I
had just</b>
<br><b>gotten home from work and went upstairs to change clothes. My room-mate
and I</b>
<br><b>were going to go to the mall. It was broad daylight. All of a sudden
my</b>
<br><b>room-mate is screaming my name from downstairs. I came downstairs
bewildered,</b>
<br><b>" Becky, what's wrong?" She swore that she heard me screaming upstairs.
She</b>
<br><b>looked totally frightened. She turned completely pale. I told her
to calm</b>
<br><b>down, and that I had not screamed. And it was probably some children
playing</b>
<br><b>outside. But she was VERY INSISTENT that it was ME that was screaming.
And</b>
<br><b>the screaming definitely came from upstairs. When we could not figure
it out,</b>
<br><b>I suggested we just go to the mall and laugh the entire incident
off. After</b>
<br><b>that the house became very strange. I dreaded being there alone,
when before,</b>
<br><b>I did not even care if I was there alone or not. I began to hate
our</b>
<br><b>townhouse. I could not sleep and Becky was always scared too. Then,
Michelle</b>
<br><b>moved in. One night Becky and Michelle were at the movies , I was
being an</b>
<br><b>anti-sosh, and stayed home to do laundry. We lived less than 2 miles
from the</b>
<br><b>beach and the fog would roll in in the strangest and spookiest way.
I was</b>
<br><b>home alone and had the door open (because I was scared) and I looked
out the</b>
<br><b>door, and saw fog roll in,and it was so evil looking. It was like
nothing I</b>
<br><b>had ever seen. Suddenly the VCR turned itself on and started to
rewind !&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was terribly spooked by now. The evil fog, the VCR taking on a life
of its</b>
<br><b>own....too much. Becky and Michelle finally got home and I told
them what</b>
<br><b>happened. They confessed to me that one day while Becky and I were
at work,</b>
<br><b>and Michelle was by herself, the stereo came on all by itself. Michelle
got</b>
<br><b>up to turn it off, thinking it was only a power surge, and found
it UNPLUGGED</b>
<br><b>! That was enough. We knew from all the horror movies of our childhood
that</b>
<br><b>"Things only get worse from here". Michelle went back to her "bad"
husband.</b>
<br><b>Becky and I both moved out. Something was definitely wrong in that
house. And</b>
<br><b>I will believe to this day, it was Becky flying off the handle about
"Jesus"</b>
<br><b>that did it. I believe it opened a door to this "ugliness". I have
one more</b>
<br><b>story to tell. It is about the house I grew up in....but I will
save it for</b>
<br><b>later.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>My Jailhouse haunting</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: OIdNo7@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I work the graveyard (pardon the pun)shift at
a county jail ( I will not</b>
<br><b>mention the name because i'm not sure how my command staff would
like it )</b>
<br><b>that appears to be very haunted. One night while on the 12th floor
I was</b>
<br><b>looking for some large trash bags to clean the 2 occupied cell blocks
on the</b>
<br><b>12th floor. I didn't have any, so I ventured down to the 10th floor.
The 10th</b>
<br><b>floor has 3 occupied cell blocks and one vacant (closed for maintenance
and</b>
<br><b>refurbishing) one. I entered the vacant control office in search
of trash</b>
<br><b>bags and other supplies. I was searching for these items when I
heard the</b>
<br><b>tone of the intercom box going off. I looked at the display and
it read that</b>
<br><b>the page was coming from cell # 47( this cell block was supposed
to be</b>
<br><b>vacant). I answered the call and received no response. I hung up
the receiver</b>
<br><b>and got another page from the same cell. I was starting to get really
freaked</b>
<br><b>out and the hair on the back of my neck was standing straight up.
I turned on</b>
<br><b>every light in the cell block and the paging from the intercom stopped.
I</b>
<br><b>looked through the control room window at cell # 47 and the light
in the room</b>
<br><b>seemed to only flicker. I got outta there and left everything on.
I got up to</b>
<br><b>my floor and called maintenance to see if there was anyone in that
cell</b>
<br><b>block, to which they replied negative. Later that shift while on
my lunch</b>
<br><b>break, I confided in some of my co-workers who had also witnessed
similar</b>
<br><b>incidents.I have only worked there 3 months, but these occurences
were well</b>
<br><b>known among my more seasoned co-workers. Even when the cell block
was</b>
<br><b>occupied, only the lower level was used. My senior co-workers said
that some</b>
<br><b>jailers have been so frightened that they will not return. I do
know that</b>
<br><b>there is something up there, and I will not return to that cell
block by</b>
<br><b>myself. Thanks and enjoy,&nbsp; -A.</b>
