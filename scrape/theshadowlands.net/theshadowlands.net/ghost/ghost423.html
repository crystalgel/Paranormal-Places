Pekin, In., Haunting <br>
<br>
By: mthr_gs@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Where to start.., As a teen I lived in a nice, newer home, on Voiles
Rd. in Pekin, In. My parents and I were the 2nd family to live in it.
When we went to just "view" the house to see if my parents wanted to
live there, I found myself afraid to go inside. I was only 12 yrs old
at that time and had no idea what I was afraid of. I had had encounters
with things I could't explain befor, but they never scared me like this
house did. My parents talked me in to going inside, I wasn't happy
(actually I cried), but went in anyway. It had 3 bedrooms, and a large
basement and yard. My Dad and Mom decided it was perfect for us and
started with the purchase plans. Inside the house the back bedroom,
which faced the woods behind and on the side of the house, truely was
the only part of the whole place that made me feel uneasy. I made Mom
promise that I would not be put in there to sleep and she agreed that I
would get the larger of the 2 bedrooms in the front end of the house.
The problems didn't start rite away, for me anyways. My parents took
the room that I refused, my Dad was away alot for work, so my Mom got
the first experiences! She kept them secret from me, till my last yr of
school. That yr we had gotten new bedroom suits and I was put in that
room! Not for long though, not many 17yr olds sleep with thier Moms,
but after waking to see a woman sitting on the side of my bed one night
and disappearing befor reaching the foot of my bed while walking away,
I slept with her every night afterwards! She was a dark figure with no
real features to see, but I could tell "it" was female. I had also seen
dark shadowy figures dancing in the basement, everyone heard the heavy
footsteps upstairs, while we were all downstairs, scratching in the
attic..We moved back to Ky when i graduated in '86, but even though the
house had its issues, it was the only place I had ever called home. I
went back and visited the next owners yrs later and they had had all
the same experiences we had. The only difference was a young couple had
tried to live there, when they had a new baby the "ghost" got a little
violent and knocked things from the walls, the young family moved for
fear the baby would be harmed. Behind the house, through the woods is a
cemetery, 11 or 12 graves, all dated from the 1500's to the 1800's. I
used to hang out there to sneak and smoke cigarettes. I cant help but
wonder if "it" was someone from there. I hope to someday get the time
to go visit whomever lives there now, 21 yrs later...<br>

Mudlick Hollow Kentucky<br>
<br>
By: RadioFlyerIL@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
There's a story on here about a house in Mud Lick Hollow in Hardy,
Kentucky (known to those who live there or remembered by those who
lived there as Sharondale. Ky).<br>
The story states that the 'white house' on the right is haunted.<br>
Correction:&nbsp; This house was owned by Gracie Deskins.&nbsp; She
lived in that house when I was a child and never once was there any
report of anything unusual.&nbsp; She and her sister lived there for
many years after she became quite old.&nbsp; These stories might have
happened since her death. <br>
Across from her home in the old 'stomping grounds' there were many
stories of&nbsp; ghosts of American Indians.&nbsp; It is reported that
glimpses of these 'Indians' can be seen even during the day. This was
known as an Indian burial ground.&nbsp; I can verify this because I was
one of the children who actually saw what appeared to be an
Indian.&nbsp; The Indian seen was wearing what appeared to be hides and
carrying a spear or something that might have been a spear.&nbsp; I was
not the only child who saw this the day it happened.&nbsp; There were
many of us there playing ball during recess from the grade school and
we all saw it.<br>
However, there are many other hauntings in this area and none of them
mentioned here.&nbsp; Such as the graveyard that was up on the mountain
across highway 119. This graveyard had been in disrepair even back in
the 1950's.&nbsp; I used to play in that area as a kid and know that
there have been 'unusual happenings' since even before that time.<br>
The train trestle that used to cross old highway 119 from the upper
part of Sharondale Coal Camp to the side where coal was loaded into the
train cars:&nbsp; That trestle was the place for dares as a
child.&nbsp; There were a few children who were injured there taking
those dares.&nbsp; To this day nobody knows what the real story is
about that old trestle. " The trestle is now gone but the stories
remain."&nbsp; <br>
There was also a house that was used for storage along those
tracks.&nbsp; Part of the house was used for storing things for repair
to the homes of coal miners in the upper and lower coal camp mining
homes.&nbsp; That particular house was rented to a couple with one
child.&nbsp; The mother often came across the road to another home,
frightened by things that happened in the house.&nbsp; She stated that
the light bulbs would burst and the windows shook even when there was
no reasonable means of explaining it.<br>
Many stories of hauntings in those homes still abound. Note:&nbsp; The
homes are now gone.&nbsp; Highway programs that took the area for a
larger highway.<br>
&nbsp;Miners whose lives were taken in coal mining accidents still roam
that area, a woman who was killed by a big cat up on the mountain whose
shrill screams can still be heard during both day and night.<br>
Different areas on the mountain where miners were killed, mines that were closed are also rumored to be haunted.<br>
The same area is known to have different stories of men who were killed by revenuers back in the early 1900's. <br>
Men killed by revenuers:&nbsp; Some whose bodies were found and others who just 'went missing'.<br>

The Ghost of My Grandpa<br>
<br>
<br>
By: fireoak@cfl.rr.com<br>
<br>
A few years ago i was in foster care and i was on the verge of getting
out. at during that time my grandfather died. after sometime i was
released into my mothers care and i started living with her. every once
in a while she would tell me that he was watching over me and
protecting me so i didnt have to worry about him every time i cried. so
one night my mom was in the kitchen and ou of the corner of her eye,
she saw a small light. about a week or so she saw it again. after that
she told me abou it. of course i didnt beleive her. about 3 nights
later my mom wasnt feeling good and she had gone to sleep early. since
it was in the middle of the summer i was staying up early to
watch&nbsp; movie so i had gone into the kitchen to get a soda. moms
door was wide open and i looked into her room and i saw the same exact
light she had. i was completely freaked but the started thinking about
what sh had told me a week or so before. i got a second look and it
didnt go away. it had been at the side of my moms be so i didnt know
what to think of wether it was good or bad. but it looked like it was
just sitting there. then after a minute or so it moved. then its
vannished. the next day my mom felt perfectly fine and i told her what
happened. she said then that we had an angel looking over us and i said
that i didnt think it was an angle but grandpa.&nbsp; after a while it
started coming later and later. and its been about 1 and a half years
since ive seen the orb/light but i really do think that it was my
grandpa that was the light we were seeing.<br>

The Old Clock and the Gym Basement<br>
<br>
<br>
By: david.wilson@greencastle.com<br>
<br>
Hi, I have an experience to share with you all; when my grandfather
died we went to my grandmother&#8217;s house to check on her. She had a clock
that when my great, great grandmother died it stopped ticking then.
When my grandpa died it started again it had not ticked for a long,
long time for about 100 years , my grandpa had always wanted to hear it
too maybe it was him that did it or a coincidence.<br>
My gym basement at my school, when I went to the bathroom in gym class
my friend came to; it used to be a locker room for a high school. We
were about half way down the stairs when the lights started flicking on
and off then the water at the sinks turned on and the stall doors
slammed then we turned to run up the stairs and in the corner we saw a
boy that you could like see through and he had a hunter green shirt
with black dress pants, we screamed and ran up stairs most of our class
was there no one believed us but we know what we saw.<br>
Another one&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; me and my other friend&nbsp; we went down there she had
to use the bathroom and was scared to go by herself so I went down to
we were standing at the bottom of the stairs noticing how freezing it
was so cold so she went over to the first stall then she started to
open it I screamed ( not loud )&nbsp; she said &#8216; what &#8220; I said turn
around she did what we both saw was a girl wearing a dress with bright
red eyes with a black back ground she had a&nbsp; possessed smile she
said leave no,no,no leave in an evil inpatient&nbsp;&nbsp; way she
looked straight at us and was right behind my friend we were about to
cry in fear we had not what to do so we turned and ran&nbsp; she
slowly&nbsp; followed&nbsp; us we told the teacher she knew about it
because she acted like she did even in tornado drills she hates going
down there. <br>
Here is another for you to admirer&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.One time I went with one of my
friends, Kenna, down to that basement and when we were there we saw
something strange and unwanted! We were standing at the very end of the
stair case and we were walking into the bathrooms! And at that very
moment we saw a strange looking girl just standing there and she was
staring at us&#8230;.keep in mind this used to be and old school at least
about 90-95 years old!&nbsp; So me and my friend stood there for a
moment and stared at her then we suddenly saw her eyes were plain
black! I t was so scary! So me and kenna slowly and I mean slowly
walked away but as we were going up the stairs we noticed she was
following us&#8230;..we looked back, I mean we wanted to see it but at the
same time we didn&#8217;t! And there she was!! It was freaky she was right
behind us&#8230; reaching for us and wanting to touch us!! So we ran &#8230;&#8230;. We
thought know one would believe this horrible frightening incident but
luckily quite a few people did!! And that&#8217;s y many people don&#8217;t like to
go into the basement/bathroom any more!!<br>

The Policeman <br>
<br>
By: Athenaskiva@aol.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One summer my three children my sister in law and I were traveling to
my hometown in South Carolina. We live in New York so it is a pretty
long way to go. It was foggy that morning and my car had been
experiencing trouble. We broke down near Pennsylvania on found
ourselves sitting on the side of the road maybe about eight hours from
home. <br>
A police officer pulled up behind my car, my youngest was 2 months old
he and was screaming very loudly but when he saw this policeman he
started smiling and laughing. Dressed in a older styled police uniform,
it looked to be a style from the 70's. He had the most beautiful face
and voice. He walked around my car and then he laid his hand on my car
my car started back up. Then he just disappeared. I can't explain it. I
looked up from the dash, seconds after I saw him standing in front of
the car and then he was gone! No policeman car, no police car. Nothing!
No One! We didn't see him leave. As a matter of fact we didn't even see
him pull up. I thank God for that angel in disguise. <br>
We made it home safely.<br>

Were they Dancing?<br>
<br>

<br>
When I was about 12 years old I was visiting my neighbor whose family
was in the process of building a new home. We were sitting on a dirt
mound that over looked a field behind their home. We were just hanging
out laughing when all of a sudden she tensed up and grabbed my arm. I
turned to look t what she was pointing at and out in the field there
was an apparition of a couple dancing in mid air. We got freaked out
and took off running. Later that night I told my mom what had happened
but she just blew it off as my imagination getting carried away. About
a week later my mom went down to see my friends dad. She decided to ask
him about what I saw. All she asked was if he had ever seen anything in
the field behind her house. He got quiet for minute and asked why. She
told him that I had seen two people out in the field. He looked right
at her and said were they dancing. Now she believes me....<br>

Visiting Owners<br>
<br>
By: sue_k_2001@webtv.net<br>
<br>
I grew up in a house that was always open to evryone and warm but it
did have its secrets. When I was very y oung and the house was empty,I
wouldhear my name being called and I would run fom room to
room,thinking someone was home.My brother said this also happened to
him on Saturday mornings when everyone was asleep and he watched
cartoons.&nbsp; One night as a 12 year old,I was sleeping in the
upstairs hall, while my room was being finished.&nbsp; I was sleepng
with my face to the wall.and softly my shoulder was being pushed.
Thinking it was someone in my family wanting something ,I turned around
to face the room.&nbsp; There in front of me was a small couple: a man
in a suit in a 1930's hat and a sweet looking woman with a pill box
like hat.&nbsp; I think they liked what they saw because they looked at
each other,smiled,and then turned around to go down the stairs.&nbsp; I
never saw them again but many years later in a conversation with my
mother,she told me the small huse with the low ceilings and low working
areas was bult for a small couple in 1939 and before the could move in
they died in a fatal car accident. I guess they were just checking up
on their home.<br>

USS Constellation<br>
<br>
<br>
By: kiddencat@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
Well my boyfriend is a non-believer, but he says he "wants to believe".
So, back before we were dating, we would find things to do where he
might see something and come around. I was VERY picky about these
places because I am a believer and, also, I scare easy. So I didn't
want to get myself into a situation that I would have a hard time with.
As a result, I chose places that I had been to many times and was
comfortable with. We had been to a few and I had "heard something" or
whatever, but generally I attributed this my imagination because I was
worked up. But one experience stands out.<br>
We were on the USS Constellation - known for hauntings but I had taken
him there more as a glimpse of my own past. As a native Baltimorean (Or
Baltimoron, as my father likes to say), and a lover of history, I
practically grew up on it. I was completely relaxed, as I usually am
there, and Rob and I were standing on the Orlop deck looking over the
rail. It's my favourite place on the ship (don't ask my why, my least
favourites are outside the Chaplain's quarters and in the infirmary -
given the history of the ship the Orlop really shouldn't be my fave,
but it is). So we had been standing there in silence for a few minutes,
just kinda taking it in. It was a cold day and we went there right
after work so there was hardly anyone else on the vessel. So after a
few moments of quiet I say, "Cut it out." <br>
"What?" he replies. Well he knew what he did. He put his hand around my
waist, cupping the curve of my hip. As we weren't dating at this time
(and infact I believe we were both seeing other people when this
happened) I thought this was pretty damn inappropriate). I turned to
tell him so. He was standing too far away from me to have done that. He
didn't move as I was standing directly next to him and would have
noticed. "What?" he said again, a little more forcefully, looking
rather concerned for my sanity. "Nothing," <br>
I said. I didn't want to think about it and ruin one of my favourite childhood retreats.<br>
After we were off the ship I told him what had happened. He still isn't
really convinced, since I'm the one who experienced something, not him,
but he did admit that "the ghost has good taste." That's sweet... I
think.<br>

Papa's Visit<br>
<br>
By: veggiebaby21@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I just want to say that I love your website and couldn&#8217;t help but share my story with you.<br>
A few years ago my great grandfather was very ill and in a nursing
home. We (my family and i) lived far away from him so we only made a
trip up to see him around Christmas and his birthday. <br>
One day when I was 15 and my brother was only about two we were sitting
in my living room watching T.V when all of a sudden my little brother
started crying. I asked him what was wrong and he said he wanted to go
see Papa. I thought it was weird because he had only met Papa a few
times. My mom came in the room and told him that Papa was very far away
but that we would go see him soon. My brother started crying harder and
was screaming &#8220;I want to see Papa now!&#8221; my mom healed him in her lap
and kept telling him not to worry that papa was fine and we would go
see him soon. When he started to calm down the phone rang. It was my
aunt. She told us that Papa just passed away. <br>
&nbsp;My whole family was creped out by the experience and none of us
have really talked about it since. My little brother does not even
remember it.<br>

Spooky in an Old Mansion and a Dead-End Road!!!!<br>
<br>
By: Meccarousel25@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello , this took place in 1993&nbsp; and I have two separate stories same place and year.<br>
when I was about 16 I was living with some friends in Cleveland,Texas I
was attending school there with my best friend Mary and living with her
and her family.We had a couple friends that we went to school with the
one girl was very strange shall we say. we will call her Claire and
there was the other friend named Barbie.<br>
We lived almost at the end of a long narrow dead end dirt road. There
was only about 6 houses on the road we were surrounded by woods. we
lived in the next to the last house on the street, Claire lived in the
house that marked the dead end road....her family rarely came out in
the daytime they were more (night creatures if you will) and they had
about 60 stray cats that just hung around there house. Mary and I
decided to stay the night with Claire one night, and in the night time
was when It all got very weird. Claire was talking about witches and
witchcraft and sorts and then she laid back and started floating in mid
air very strange . Then she made us float and a black cat came in and
hissed I was frightened as well as Mary and we bolted out of there
swore never to return to the witches house at the end of the dead end
road... <br>
STORY 2<br>
One night I decided to stay the night with a friend named Barbie she
lived in a Mansion at the front corner of our street Mary did not want
to stay so It was only Barbie and I and her mother of course her father
was gone out of town on business...they owned a Horse ranch. Well this
night it was very creepy out very calm and still... after watching
movies and talking a bunch...We decided to head up stairs to bed her
room was on the third floor (yes it was a three story Mansion) anyway
we went to bed it was around 2:am her mom was still down stairs in the
study doing book work. we climbed in to her Queen size bed I was
closest to the door and she was on the other side by the window. I
think we finally fell asleep around 3:am and I was woke up at 3:36am to
hear the horse outside was going crazy ... and my arm felt like it was
on FIRE!!! I screamed btu she did not move I could not sit up It was
like I was being held down by a very strong force! So I screamed again
and she woke up then I told her what was happening she felt my arm and
said it was scolding HOT so we decided on the count of three we would
both scream as loud as we could for her Mother. we did and her mother
came running as soon as she opened the door my arm was back to normal
and I could sit up. she thought we were just crazy but in the morning
when we got up there was thick burgundy colored hair all over the floor
by my side of the bed only and they have no indoor pets....can you
explain???<br>
Thanks for hearing my stories<br>

Noise In The Hallway<br>
<br>
By: erickaxx2002@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Our family had an experience several years back in our old house.&nbsp;
I tried to submit this story to your site a few years back but I don't
think it was ever posted.&nbsp; I am the last one to say I believe in
ghosts and normally when people tell me they saw a ghost I listen but
figure they are full of it.&nbsp; Well this time I am glad that my
entire family heard it.&nbsp; I don't care if nobody else believes
because at least we know it happened.&nbsp; It happened several years
ago maybe a good 28 years ago, I was around 7 if not younger.&nbsp; At
the time I was sleeping in my parents room w/my dad and my mom had went
to lay down w/my brother since he had the flu.&nbsp; The way our house
was is that we have 3 bedrooms and two doors that we kept closed that
closed off the back of the house to the living room and kitchen.&nbsp;
We had all just started to fall asleep when we were woke up by a really
lound thump then the sound of something heavy running and ripping up
the carpet, it reminded me of our old cat that use to run down the hall
and her claws would get stuck in the carpet but this was much much
louder.&nbsp; The noise came and went very fast, my dad had jumped up
and got his shot gun and went outside thinking it was someone running
on our roof of the house.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; He came back in and
asked us all if we heard it and we did.&nbsp; To this day we have no
idea what it was and it never happened again.&nbsp; My brother and I
talk about it to this day and we get chills thinking about it.&nbsp; I
am sure it is something that could be explained but what?&nbsp; It was
too loud for any house noise.&nbsp; Our plumbing we never had issues
with.&nbsp; Like I said I am glad our entire family heard it so that
way they know I am not making something up.&nbsp; I have never had
another experience like that since.&nbsp; I am interested in the idea
of hauntings but I normally am more on the factual than fantasy but
that has made me think that just maybe there is something to all this
super natural. <br>
One thing about my story I know it is real I have read other stories on
the site and think alot of them are fabricated and I am sure if reading
mine people will think I am making it up or my entire family is making
it up but we know it happened.&nbsp; <br>

My Story<br>
<br>
By: burgerman360@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
When I was about 2 my great aunt bought me a clock with elfs and
dwarves on it. The clock had no batteries in it and didn't work but at
night it would work when it was dark. I would wake up and cry. We also
used to see a ghost dog walk up and down the hallway. One night Mum and
Dad saw it as well when they went to check it out it was gone. It
turned out the house was built on an old dairy farm. My mum and Dad
told me about this.<br>

My Stories<br>
<br>
By: shellileigh@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
My stories were told to me.&nbsp; The 1st was told by my dad.&nbsp; My
dad was a 18 wheel truck driver.&nbsp; The stories he told seem
far-fetched but he&#8217;s does a head on his shoulders to know he telling
the truth.&nbsp; One night driving a long stretch of highway, he came
upon a beautiful dog.&nbsp; He braked but he knew he had hit the
dog.&nbsp; He got out of the cab of the truck, with his flashlight, to
give the dog a proper burial.&nbsp; He looked up and down the ravines
and what he found was not a dog but a family with the dog.&nbsp; They
had crashed down the ravine two hours earlier, the family survived but
the dog didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; <br>
The next story was told by brother and now sister in law (then
girlfriend) .&nbsp; In 95, my brother came to Texas from Georgia to be
with our dad was ill.&nbsp; My sister in law (then girlfriend) was in
Georgia.&nbsp; Our dad passed late at night, my brother decided to wait
til morning to call my s-i-l, because she had to be work early the next
morning.&nbsp; Well, my sister in law called instead, crying, scared,
shaking.&nbsp; She said that about 2 am she got up to get a drink in
the kitchen, walked in the living room saw dad sitting on the couch,
said hi to him, continue into the kitchen, and then realize he supposed
to be in Texas, not knowing he passed yet.&nbsp; She walked back into
the living room where he still sitting there, telling her he needs to
tell her something, she screamed NO, and runs back into the bedroom,
slams the door, lock it, and calls her best friend husband who is cop,
to come to the house and no one is there.&nbsp; When my brother tells
her our dad passed she freaks more.&nbsp; I just wished I knew what he
wanted to tell her.&nbsp; Oh well, thanks for listening.<br>

My Personal Experiences<br>
<br>
<br>
By: sara.rodbourne@gmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
These experiences are very personal since they involve my only sister
who died February 5, 2005 in a car accident. She died on impact and no
one had a chance to say goodbye. She was only 15 years old.<br>
Em started visiting me right after she died. It was exactly 24 hours
since I had found out she was gone and I woke up from a sound sleep
convinced she was standing right beside my bed alive and wanting to go
to Taco Bell. I rolled over and couldn't see her but could feel her.<br>
She was calm and peaceful and was telling me to be strong. My best
friend was sleeping on the floor next to my bed and she woke up a few
second later, also from a sound sleep and asked who was in the room. I
told her Em was here that I could feel her and felt very sick, from
grief not from her visit. My father also had a visit from Em in the
hours after she had died. We had just gotten back from the hospital
where we had to identify her body. My dad was alone in the family room,
my mom and I were in the living room. Dad was looking at a picture of
Em and myself hanging on the wall across from him when a bright light
hit if for a moment. The only window across from the picture was
covered with a piece of cardboard to prevent the sun from glaring on
the TV screen. Dad also felt a peaceful presence. Mom had her
experience several months later. She was visiting Em's grave and
tripped suddenly. The ground was even and she was wearing sturdy shoes.
She knows Em tripped her to show her presence and to make her laugh.<br>
I had another, odder, experience close to what would have been her 16th
birthday. I was taking a shower and was talking to her and crying. I
felt her presence in the bathroom with me and when I got out of the
shower and wiped the condensation off the mirror her face was there. It
was like a double exposure, her face super imposed over mine. We have
very different features and coloring which made the experience even
more odd.<br>
Regularly since Em's death at both my apartment and my parents house
other things have occur ed. Light bulbs will blow out in rapid
succession even the super long lasting ones. We had to replace so many
bulbs in the months immediately following her death my mom told her to
stop, that she was costing us a fortune in light bulbs. After mom's
reprimand the light bulbs stopped blowing.<br>
Emily has visited me in my new apartment. I have felt her presence,
smelled her perfume and she likes to move/take things. My first night
in my current apartment my remote control went missing. I left it
sitting on the futon went to bed and when I woke up it was gone. I
searched under, behind and around the futon. I eventually searched the
entire apartment with no sign of the remote. Before going to bed I told
Em that she was very funny and to return the darn remote. Sure enough
the next morning it was sitting on the futon like it had never
disappeared. Em has also shown her presence by stacking books and
magazines that were strewn around the night before and by putting
things on the cat condo. My cats have a condo that is a cylindrical hut
on the bottom with a post with a square platform on top. They also have
a toy that is a small square covered in carpet with a spring coming out
of the center with a puffball on top. I have found the spring toy
centered on the top of the cat condo. The squares were perfectly
centered and there was no way my cats would have done that.<br>
I don't believe Em haunts but merely visits. She makes her presence
known and her signs are most preavalent when I am sad or worried and
want her guidance. I miss her terribly but not as much as I would if
she didn't stop by to say hi and move my stuff.<br>

My House<br>
<br>

Hello, After reading some of the stories on this website I have decided
to share my own. About a month after my high school graduation, my
family bought a beautiful three level home on the lake. The real estate
agent told us the house was about fifty years old, but we later found
out it was about 65 years old. I wil tell you a brief layout of the
home. when coming in the front door you are in a sunk in living area
with a door srtaight ahead that is the master suite, to the right is
the kitchen, dining room living room, one laundry room, breakfast room,
a bathroom, and a den. Off the kitchen there is a flight of stairs
leading up and another leading down. upstiars having three bedrooms and
a bathroom; the downstaris having a bathroom, and bedroom, laundry
room, and large great room. Well two days after moving in me, my
mother, and my aunt were sitting in the kitchen talking about what
classes I was going to take when the fall semester started. Since we
had just moved in all we had was water and electricity, no cable or
phone lines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we were talking the phone at the top of
the stairs started ringing, we got enough nerve to answer it but no one
was there. We proceeded to take it out of the wall and put it in a
spare bedroom unplugged. but it still rang incessantly at really odd
times of the night, so we ended up throwing it away. Also when I am
home by myself, I can hear footsteps above me, and doors open and
close. I, my mother, and sister have also seen an elderly lady, always
upstiars, and at different times, in an old brown housecoat. She has
always walked into the bathroom and disappeared. We have not found out
if anyone has died in the house or not. One day after one of my classes
I came home to do a research project and had the house to myself, I was
sitting in my room and heard footsteps coming up the stairs and stop
right outside my bedroom door, I had looked at the window to see if it
was a friend or one of my parents, but there was no car in the
driveway, I then heard whatever it was coughing, I ran to the door and
opened it, but nobody was there. Also faucets in the house turn on by
themselves. At first I thought I was crazy, but with my family
experiencing it, and friends who know nothing about it tell me things
that they hear and feel in my house, I believe it is haunted<br>

My Experiences<br>
<br>

Hi, my name is Aline and I am 20 years old, and I would like to share with you some of my experiences.<br>
I have always been a believer, not just me my mom and sister also
believe. My dad tries to be racional, but sometimes... there are things
that are hard to explain.<br>
Well... first time it was my dad my sister and I in our back yard, we
were BBQing I must have been around 8 years old and my sister around 4.<br>
I was sitting around reading a comic book, my sister was playing with
her dolls on the floor and my father was working&nbsp; the BBQ. <br>
When out of nowhere my sister yells at the top of her lungs as if she
was answering someone that was calling her that was far away.
"WHAT???", my dad asked her "What was that all about?" and my sister
answered, "She keeps calling me", "who is calling you?", "I don't know,
a lady". <br>
My dad and I just looked at each other and said..."weird we didnt hear
anything, maybe it was mom. When all of the sudden. We hear this womens
voice, calling for my sister "Joyceeeee" .... now.. this was not any
regular voice... it was chilling, it imediately sent chills down my
spine and i could see my dad felt it too...but i was more scared for my
sister, i didn't want her to have any contact to whatever was calling
for her.<br>
Not long after that first experience...<br>
&nbsp;I shared my room with my sister. We were both afraid of the dark
so my mom always kept the bathroom light on for us every night. <br>
When one night i woke up and looked at the doorway to see a man
sitting&nbsp; on my sister's bed just staring at me. I froze...didn't
know what to do. I first thought of getting up turning on the
lights...but I was too scared of even blinking, I didn't want to lose
this guy out of my sight.<br>
&nbsp;I was scared of closing my eyes then opening them again and
having him face to face with me. So I did what any 8 year old would do
when dealing with this situation. <br>
I covered my head with my blanket and scream as loud as I could calling
my mother...as I was screaming I though I'm just going to get out from
under these covers when I see those lights coming on.<br>
&nbsp;Seconds later my mom ran into the room and turned on the lights
asking what was wrong. I told her what happened and she tried to
comfort me&nbsp; making me fall back asleep, thats when she felt my
head and saw that I was burning up with a really high fever. <br>
Next day still shoken up about the previous night my mom told me it was
probably someone that wanted to scare me so that I called my mom and
make her notice that I was sick.<br>
Nothing happened for a really long time......until maybe 3-4 years ago.<br>
And what happended was by far the best thing I've ever felt in my whole entire life.<br>
I was sleeping in my own room by this time. When I was in that half
awake half asleep state. When I opened my eyes and saw this orb it was
about the size of a bowling ball and it was really bright and it was
floating just above my face.<br>
I wasnt scared. i kept looking at it, but it was so bright i closed my
eyes. Then I FELT SOMEONE HOLDING MY HAND!!!! It was incredible. I felt
at peace. Then what seemed like a dream, but i just know it was an out
of body experience. I opened my eyes, and I was sitting on this bench
by the beach watching the waves crashing at the rocks, it was amazing.
I was still holding the hand of the person that visited my in my
bedroom. There was other people there, i know we all sat there having a
conversation. But i cant seem to remember anything that was said. just
what i saw.<br>
I woke up the next day i still had my hand in a fist, as if i was still holding <br>
on to someones hand. =]<br>
Okay, now this is the last one I promise.<br>
A couple of months ago. My friend bought a house and asked me if i
could stay over to wait for the cable guy while she was in class since
it was my free period.<br>
I said Okay, no problem. She gave me the keys and after class there i
was. i came in and felt that weird feeling... the I'm not alone
feeling. I tried to brush it off, blaming on my over active imagination.<br>
I sat at the living room and picked up a magazine. I was flipping
through the pages. And out of nowhere i felt this uncontrolable urge to
sleep. I couldnt fight it, i just felt my body slowly falling to my
side on the couch. I couldnt move, not a single muscle. Then again what
looked like a dream, but i know it was real. I sat up and looked behind
me. There was this girl about my age 19-20 she looked very much alike
my friend that asked me to wait for the cable guy. She was sitting at
the dining room table. Just looking at me. Then confused I called her
by my friends name and said " You're home, I fell asleep...why didnt
you wake me?" No response. She just kept looking at me. When she didnt
answer me I just turned back around and layed back on the couch. This
time I really didnt move, and couldnt get a single word out. I just
thought This is not my friend. Who is she????? Then she came up to the
couch and started running her fingers through my hair, and holding my
face, I felt really uneasy, i wanted to run out of there. Then she said
something that i couldnt understand and after that she said " Finally I
found You".<br>
I shut my eyes realll tight and when I opened she wasnt there... but it
took a while for me to start moving again. I felt really tired. Drained
out of my energies.<br>
That was an experience I have yet to understand.<br>
Thank you for sticking with me.<br>
Sorry If I bored you.<br>
Feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions or if you went through something alike!<br>

My Experiences with Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: kitty1981@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I have lived in haunted houses my whole life.&nbsp; As far back as I
can remember myself and other family members have had experienced with
spirits from the other side.<br>
&nbsp;The first experience I can remember clearly, I was about 7 or 8
years old and everyone else in my family was gone.&nbsp; The only
people in my house were myself and my babysitter.&nbsp; The house
consisted of three stories, the first, second, and attic.&nbsp; I later
found out that my sister's best friend's great grandfather had built
that house in the early 1900's.&nbsp; But we were up late watching
tv.&nbsp; My sister kept her room padlocked because, of course,
naturally, I was a nosey little sister.<br>
All of the bedrooms except for our parents' were upstairs.&nbsp; All of
a sudden, we heard footsteps walk from the opposite side of the bed
around the bed, heard my sister's bedroom door open and slam shut, the
footsteps walked to the top of the stairs, ran down the stairs, ran
back up the stairs, walked to the bedroom door, the door opened and
slammed shut again, and they walked back to the opposite side of the
room where they had originated from.&nbsp; We knew that there was no
way someone could have broke in because outside her window was the roof
of the first floor.&nbsp; We went upstairs to investigate to make sure
my sister didn't come home and us not know it.&nbsp; Upon reaching the
top of the stairs, we looked at her bedroom door, and it remained
locked, I even pulled on it to make sure.<br>
A couple of years later, we moved to another house, and my bedroom was
at the back of the house past the kitchen.&nbsp; At night I would hear
the cabinet doors opening and shutting.&nbsp; I found out after we
moved three years later that my sister awoke one night to find a figure
standing at the foot of her bed.<br>
We moved again when my parents bought a double wide mobile home.&nbsp;
We never saw anything, but there were times the back door would swing
open, and no one would be near it.&nbsp; <br>
When I met my husband and moved in with him, I was hoping that I would
finally be rid of the whole ghost thing, and it seemed that way for a
while.&nbsp; Then I started seeing shadows out of the corner of my eye.<br>
After my daughter was born, things seemed to calm down for a
while.&nbsp; When she was about 10 months old, she came down with the
croup (an infection of the lungs for those who don't know).&nbsp; It
got so bad that she wouldn't sleep for more than 20-30 minutes before
she would wake up coughing.&nbsp; I started putting her in the bed with
me so I could get a little bit of sleep too during her resting
periods.&nbsp; One night, about three days after she started sleeping
in my bed, my husband awoke to an older woman standing beside my bed
peering at the bed.&nbsp; <br>
We found out after we sold the house that an older woman had died there
and the woman's daughter was expecting a baby.&nbsp; I guess she just
improvised when my daughter was born, thinking that she was the baby
that her daughter was expecting. When we sold the house and moved, we
experienced the only violent outburst from her in the 5 years that I
had lived there.&nbsp; We were there moving the last few things out and
my husband, brother, and I stood in the doorway of the living room and
kitchen when the broom, which was four feet from my brother and he was
the closest one to it, flew across the room like someone had thrown
it.&nbsp; I guess she was mad that we were moving out.<br>
The house that we own now is haunted as well, however we have far less
experiences with it than we have had in the past.&nbsp; Not too long
after we moved in, we would hear a baby cry, and I would go to check on
my second daughter, and she would be sound asleep.&nbsp; At times, I
would wake up to find the locks on the attic and basement doors would
be unlocked.&nbsp; I have been in the tub late at night, when everyone
else is asleep, and I would hear one hard, loud knock on the bathroom
door, but upon investigation, no one is there and everyone is still
asleep.&nbsp; Every once in a while I will hear my name being called,
and while in the bathroom another time I heard a male voice coming from
the basement, although I was unable to comprehend what was being
said.&nbsp; There are no exterior entrances or exits from the basement.<br>
My husband has said that he has seen a little girl running around, and
she apparently likes him because she'll touch his legs while he's
laying down and when he looks up and sees no one there, he says all
right leave me alone and he will hear giggling followed by footsteps
with no one there to cause them.&nbsp; <br>
The occurances were very frequent when we first moved in, but after
four years, they have ceased in frequency.&nbsp; Now, once in a while
we will hear giggling, footsteps, or our names being called, but
nothing visual.&nbsp; I guess they know that they don't bother us or
scare us, and they just want us to know that they're still here so
that's why they make themselves known every once in a while.&nbsp; <br>
I have heard from different psychics about certain people being like
magnets for the spirit world, and I often wonder if I am one of those
magnets.&nbsp; However, I have no problem continuing to live with these
spirits from beyond as long as there is no violent behavior
shown.&nbsp; In a way, I see it as kind of cool, it makes my home
unique.<br>
