<p><b>Burned</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: grlintrupt@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story may get long so please bear with me here. I live in northeast
Indiana and have had several experiences while living here. Some I'm not
sure if it was my imagination or if it was actually ghosts. It all started
when I met my boyfriend back in 1997.Now please keep in mind that these
may not have happened in this exact order, just as I remember them. He
lives in a very large house that is located near railroad tracks. The house
used to be a hotel back in the early 1900's? I'm not positive on the date,
and across the street was the depot where the trains would drop people
off and they'd come stay at the hotel. Anyways the house was badly burnt
in areas when they bought it and have had to restore a lot of the house.
I remember I went to their house one night and was watching movies in the
living room with my boyfriend while his parents were out to dinner. As
I was sitting there I had this weird feeling and looked out towards the
kitchen. I saw a man standing there in a white short sleeved shirt, but
could only see the top half of his body. I couldn't see the face very well
either. I freaked out and told my boyfriend that someone was in the kitchen.
He got up and looked and found nobody out there. So I guess this was my
first experience in the house. I later just blew it off and figured I had
imagined it. But I had never felt the sensation before that I did in this
house. I can't explain it, just an eerie feeling. Well once I got older
I started staying the night there, around my senior year of high school.
For some reason I could not go downstairs by myslef if no one was down
there. I would always make my boyfriend go with me, even to the bathroom
as crazy as it sounds. Well needless to say he started to get fed up with
it and said he wouldn't go with me anymore. So if I had to go to the bathroom
I would run down as fast as I could and turn on every light and come flying
back up the stairs. That was the only way I'd go down. Well now to move
on with my story....on another night e were once again watching movies
and he had fallen asleep on me, and I swore I saw something small and black
go running across the living room out of the corner of my eye. I figured
it was nothing and continued watching the movie. A few minutes later I
seen about 3 or 4 black shadows about 1 foot high out of the corner of
my eye again go running around the corner and up the stairs. I was really
scared and I knew what I had just seen wasn't right. I never told anyone
and to this day still haven't. I don't know what they were and don't want
to know. Well I ended up moving in with him and his parents for about a
year and our room was located upstairs. My boyfriend worked in the evenings
so I'd be setting in there by myself all evening until 10 or 11 at night.
I hated it and always kept our bedroom door locked because of the hallway.
It was a really dark hall and I would always hear things. It would sound
like someone would open the bottom door, walk up the stairs, then down
the hall into a vacant room. I had looked out before and never saw anybody
there. Sometimes I'd forget to lock the door and it would open about 3
inches by itself at times, and I would slam it shut and then hear running
down the hall. I would be so scared that my heart would pound so fast and
I wouldn't move until my boyfriend got home. You'd hear the same sounds
of walking at night while laying in bed too, yet I was the only one to
hear them. Well now move forward to about 2001. In this year my boyfriends
father had finished building an apartment on the back half of the house,
they said we could live there for pretty cheap rent so we took it. It was
a huge relief because I didn't have that feeling anymore of being watched,
and no longer heard things. Well that didn't last long. My grandmother
died in August 2001 of cancer. After her death I started having things
coming up missing. Things that she had given me, like jewelry and what
not. My jewelry box that had a bracelet in it that she gave me would always
get opened up for no reason, and he braclet would be moved around inside
the box. I got tired of it and one day I told her that I knew she was there,
and that I loved her but that she was scaring me and for her to please
stop it. Well she did and it hasn't been moved since. But that isn't the
end of all this crap. My cat constantly stares at things that I can't see.
He'll move his head and eyes from side to side like he's following something.
My dog barks at the hallway door which has the furnace in it, but used
to be part of the hall leading over to his parents side of the house. So
maybe there's a connection there, I don't know. Sometimes that door opens
by itself as well. No breeze, or fans on either. I still feel like there's
something there, just not as strong of a presence. Yesterday when I was
in the shower I kneeled down because I had dropped my razor and I looked
over towards the shower curtain and saw a shadow go by. I hurried up and
looked out the side of the curtain and nobody was there. I don't bother
to mention these things to anybody because I know no one would believe
me anyways. I've tried that before only to get laughed at. Another thing
I might add is that ever since I've lived in this house I always have very
vivid dreams that seem so real. I have woken up crying and in weird positions
before. I also always wake up with bruises or scratches on my back, legs,
and arms without any knowledge of how they got there. I hung up a dreamcatcher
but it hasn't done any good. I have 2 bruises on my right arm now that
looks like someone grabbed me and squeezed real hard. Also ever since I've
lived in this house it's like I have premonitions of things. Not big things
though, just little things. I think about something then a few days later
it will happen, or I'll be thinking about something then someone will say
it. And it's things that these people couldn't possibly know I was thinking
about. Well I know this has gotten long now, and that it's nothing scary.
Just some strange things that have happened to me here in this house. Oh
an one last thing I have a photo of my cat standing by our entry door with
what looks like a cloud of smoke around him. I took the picture with a
Kodak disposable camera, no one else was home, and I was not smoking, nor
was there anything that could have been creating smoke. Was this a ghost?
Also could the fact that the house had been burned in many areas have anything
to do with this? Thank you for your time!</b>

<br><b>The Paranormal</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>We built our home and have lived here for 7 years.&nbsp; A few times
I would wake up in the middle of the night and the bedroom would look "cloudy"
or "hazy."&nbsp; My head would feel really heavy and I would think it is
just because I awoke from a deep sleep or something and I would get up
and turn on the light and the room would still look a little hazy to me.&nbsp;
Recently I am beginning to think that all along it was something paranormal
because just this past year other things have started to happen.&nbsp;
I have heard knocks on doors when no one was on the other side.&nbsp; Also
one afternoon when I was in the bath I heard my 6 year old saying "Mommy"
three times progressivley louder and I opened the door and came out and
absolutley startled him.&nbsp; He was pearing into my bedroom and said
he saw something all black and about my size walking slowly through my
room.&nbsp; He had thought somehow that it was me because he said it had
hair like mine.&nbsp; As I am typing this I hear something sliding back
and forth on the top of my computer cabinet though the only thing up there
is a plant!&nbsp; I see nothing up there at all and now the sound has stopped.&nbsp;
Any way, earlier today I was upstairs cleaning and the kids were downstairs
watching TV.&nbsp; As I came down the stairs I smelled something that smelled
like chemicals.&nbsp; It was very strong and not knowing what it was I
made the kids go outside while I threw open the windows and investigated.&nbsp;
Soon I traced it to our utility room where I heard a hissing sound.&nbsp;
I started moving cleaning supplies around and found a can of wasp and hornet
spray sitting there surrounded by these other bottles just spraying away
on its own!&nbsp;&nbsp; Very strange to say the least, and upseting since
I worried about my children breathing those vapors.&nbsp; Since my son
saw this dark thing in my room I have started leaving the hall light on
at night.&nbsp; The other night I flipped on the lights and all the bulbs
popped!&nbsp; There are 3 bulbs in each overhead light and they all blew
out and need to be replaced.&nbsp; Over the years I have experience a few
random paranormal things but not ever in my own home.&nbsp; This is making
me feel uneasy and I don't really know quite what to make of it.&nbsp;
My son also told me one evening he saw a blue light with a face in it go
into our fireplace, but this was last winter before he saw the thing in
my room.&nbsp; I told him his eyes must have been playing tricks on him
and blew the whole thing off because I do not want him being worried and
dwelling on anything like this.&nbsp; I have a friend who told me the more
you speak of things like this and the more interest you convey then the
more active ghosts or whatever they are will try to make you notice them.&nbsp;
I have not really noticed this though since my family is full of old ghost
stories that we have told many a time and it never seemed to make a difference
before.&nbsp; That's the end of my story and hopefully the end of all the
weird happenings also!</b>

<br><b>Little boy Blue</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Elsii121@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My brother and I have heard ghosts since we were young. He started
when he was about 5 same age as I was. Out of the many ghosts we've came
in contact with there is one that stands out the most because this young
ghost followed my brother to our new home. When my brother was younger
a ghost appeared to him in my room. The Ghost was a young boy the ages
of 4-6, dressed in clothes from the early 1900's but he had a blue aura
so the boy was blue and pale, he motioned for my brother to follow him,
my brother was scared and woke me up. He told me this and so he would not
be scared I told him he was dreaming. Though I knew he wasn't. Now years
later my brother is 16 the second summer we spent in our new home the little
ghost boy appeared to my brother once more by his window but the boy looked
a little bit older and my brother had the feeling the ghost was asking
him " Why did you leave me?"</b><b></b>

<br><b>Sweet Hollow Road</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KPER@uswebinc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am writing to comment on the scary place in Huntington, New York.
Sweet Hollow Road is one of the scariest places in Huntington. All of the
stories you have on this website are true and I would like to let you in
on some more. This stuff has never happened to me but one of my best friends.
She drove back and forth a couple of time on that road because it is said
that if you drive back and forth down the road whatever is in the woods
will become angry. After doing this one night a couple of time a car appeared
in front of her and when it got closer it swerved into her and the driver
was holding a shrunken head out the window at her. Another time my friends
saw a dove nailed to one of the poles with blood dripping down it. And
this is probably one of the scariest stories of them all. My friends were
all packed into a car and they were driving down the road. At one point
along the road they saw two men dressed in black with their backs to the
road staring down at a duffle bag. The duffle bag was long and wide. When
my friends saw this they instantly turned around to go past it again and
the two men have moved about a half mile down the road within that 10 second
turnaround. But they were still there. There is a rumor that cults live
in those woods on both sides of Sweet Hollow so if you drive up and down
the road enough flashing your lights and beeping your horn you’ll make
them angry and then they will do things to you. Either chase you off the
road or just appear out of nowhere and scare of the crap out of you. Now
the overpass on that road is legendary. I’ve gone underneath it a couple
of time and nothing has ever happened. And it’s not true that you have
to beep before you go under it or someone will jump out. The story is,
is that if you put your car in neutral and turn your car off and sit underneath
it your car will start to roll because spirits of the kids who were killed
there will push you. Now it looks like there is a hill underneath so none
of us believed it. So one day my friends decided to put flour on the trunk
of the car and see if it was really true.&nbsp; They did start rolling
and they thought nothing of it. But this time was different they were pushed
pretty far down the road. Further than usual. When they drove away into
a parking lot down the road they checked the flour and there were sets
of handprints on it. They say your not supposed to look behind while under
the overpass because nothing will happen. Both of friends that have done
it have looked behind them and both of them have seen shadows behind the
car or on the back window.</b>

<br><b>Ghost story from Illinois</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ~Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm absolutely sure that my two story home on my small street is
haunted and has been for some time. The house is at least a hundred years
old and probably more, and although I have checked the background of the
homely estate I have no idea why the spirits that haunt the place do so.
I have lived here going on five years around Christmas and was told by
my children and their friends that "Chelsea" a six year old little girl
haunted the place from almost the very start. I flat out didn't believe
them even though I acted as though I did. I figured it was my thirteen
year old daughter, Christine, and her two best friends telling the younger
kids stories and they had gotten a little over-imaginitive. I had to believe
this because how else could I explain it? For the last four years, at every
one of the kids slumber parties there had been frightened children that
claimed to have seen ghosts in my house. Especially on the big slumber
party that combined both the kids birthday parties every year. How else
could I explain eleven or twelve children all saying they had witnessed
seeing a ghost or two or three in my house every year? One year when it
was just Christine doing her birthday party/slumber party all of the thirteen
girls present had claimed that a green light had enveloped my house, flown
through the window, pushed a girl across my living room, and disappeared.
They claimed two of the girls had gotten possessed, one being my daughter
and another being a close friend of hers. Yeah right, I thought. I figured
it had been the stories and my daughter and her friend playing a mean prank.
They were jokesters through and through, I told myself, and both were excellent
actresses. My daughter had been taking acting classes for quite a while
now. With a few more exuberant stories from the children through the years,
I still managed to throw them all off. My daughter, it seemed, had become
used to acting possessed and blah, blah, blah. That kind of thing. My daughter
was an odd child when it came to the paranormal things. She was the one
who was always stubbornly insistent that our house was haunted, that fairies
and things were real. She'd say to me, "Mom, if you'd ever stay up as late
as us you'd have your proof, I swear." When she was little she used to
talk to people who weren't there and once claimed she'd had a premonition
of the church by our house catching fire, which it had the afternoon she
told me. And then there was the claiming that she got possessed constantly.
Nonsense! Lies! When she had stayed up alone sometimes she'd asked me if
I'd woken up about five times during the night and paced the hallway, which
seemed absurd and entirely untrue. Shed ask me, "You really didn't?" "No!"
I'd answer emphatically. Sometimes alone or not she'd claim something had
fallen down the steps during the night but upon inspection nothing, not
a thing had fallen down our steps. She'd claim she heard voices and people
calling her name. Doors and windows supposedly rattled during the night
and the lights flickered. Not even just one light sometimes but it seemed
anything and everything electronic in the house flickered. Pacing in the
upstairs hallway and dainty footsteps on the stairs made by "Chelsea" were
often told to me. Bloody Mary had supposedly truly shown up in our bathroom
mirror and was on a first name basis with my daughter and left a deep cut
in my son, Zachary's arm. One time we were at Borders the book store and
Christine was telling Zach and his friend stories about Chelsea who seemed
to be one of the most seen ghosts in me house. I asked her about Chelsea,
and immediately and without hesitation she replied, "Chelsea, who is real,
Mom, is a six year old girl from sometime in the 1700 or 1800s. She says
she was beaten to death by her mother who was a maniac or mentally disabled
or something but they didn't really know that then. Sometimes her eyes
get red or yellow and she goes really freaky and she's a hopscotch girl."
Upon further inspection a hopscotch girl was a young child's spirit who
had died a gruesome death and hummed a song while skipping as though there
was a hopscotch square etched beneath them. Supposedly if you saw them
or heard them someone was going to come close to death. If you saw them
and heard them and they said a loved ones name the person was going to
die. They told me about a lot of ghost: Andrew Giovanni, Diana the Goth
ghost, Allisay the child, but none seemed as interesting or as often seen
as Chelsea. I could write a book about all the spirits that inhabit my
home! I learned to believe my children when I made the mistake of saying
that there were no ghosts in my house late at night trying to convince
a frightened child not to call his mother to pick him up because our house
was full of ghosts. I saw my first sighting then. A girl wearing a very
old fashioned nightgown who looked about six and had very long, blonde
braided pigtails with piercing blue eyes stood blurrily and transparent
in my room. My daughter later announced that the little girl had been Chelsea.
I've been seeing ever since.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Rhode Island Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ilscumming@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi..I'll start by saying the usual things I'm sure you</b>
<br><b>have heard time and time again; it's nice to come</b>
<br><b>across a site that a person can tell these sorts of</b>
<br><b>stories and not be considered a nut case especially</b>
<br><b>since I have been able to see, hear and speak to</b>
<br><b>spirits for as long as I can remember.</b>
<br><b>I have moved around quite often in my lifetime. I have</b>
<br><b>always been of a transient nature and when I felt the</b>
<br><b>desire to explore another state I would pack up and</b>
<br><b>go.&nbsp; I had moved to Newport, Rhode Island and decided</b>
<br><b>to go back to college.&nbsp; I enrolled in the Theatre</b>
<br><b>Department at the University of Rhode Island and began</b>
<br><b>my sophomore year at the ripe old age of 26.</b>
<br><b>For anyone who has ever participated in theatre will</b>
<br><b>know that many theatres are supposedly "haunted".&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>disagree (to a point) simply because in order to put</b>
<br><b>on a show of any kind a great deal of energy is</b>
<br><b>expended.&nbsp; Most hauntings I have experienced within a</b>
<br><b>theatre has never been more then residual pictures</b>
<br><b>left behind.</b>
<br><b>I had previously stated 'to a point'.&nbsp; I was a</b>
<br><b>returning student studying for a B.F.A. in both Acting</b>
<br><b>and Directing and I was required to spend a lot of</b>
<br><b>late night hours in the theatre building as both an</b>
<br><b>actor and as a director (oh yeah...and as a student).</b>
<br><b>I had been cast in one of the Mainstage performances</b>
<br><b>and at the same time was directing a one-act play for</b>
<br><b>my directing class. My rehearsals for the mainstage</b>
<br><b>normally concluded around 11-11:30 pm and I had booked</b>
<br><b>the small theatre I was using for my one-act for</b>
<br><b>12:30am. This was to give the students already in the</b>
<br><b>space time to finish and clean up (plus time for me to</b>
<br><b>get a cup of heavenly, life saving coffee).</b>
<br><b>This small theatre space was named the ATS: the</b>
<br><b>Afternoon Theatre Space and sat no more than 35 seats.</b>
<br><b>It was a typical black box theatre with 2 entrances to</b>
<br><b>the stage and a decent sized back stage area. It was</b>
<br><b>situated on the 3rd floor above the scene shop and at</b>
<br><b>this time was used only for student productions.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>second floor had several showers no longer in use and</b>
<br><b>was used for prop storage.&nbsp; It was my understanding</b>
<br><b>that at one time the 2nd and 3rd floors had been a</b>
<br><b>kind of "crash pad" for the students who couldn't</b>
<br><b>afford housing sometime in the late 60's.</b>
<br><b>This was to be my 1st production in the ATS (though</b>
<br><b>not my last) and I was not aware of the history of</b>
<br><b>problems that students encountered during rehearsals</b>
<br><b>and shows. It was a rite of passage for all new</b>
<br><b>students so it was the best kept secret of the</b>
<br><b>department (lucky me right?) On the night of our 1st</b>
<br><b>rehearsal in the ATS I was standing backstage with my</b>
<br><b>stage manager discussing the nights agenda and my 2</b>
<br><b>actors were were standing in the doorway to the stage</b>
<br><b>listening and waiting for the rehearsal to officially</b>
<br><b>begin. All of a sudden I heard my name called out in a</b>
<br><b>loud sing-song voice. And without looking up I</b>
<br><b>answered "What?" in the same loud sing-song tone</b>
<br><b>thinking it was someone downstairs in the scene shop</b>
<br><b>trying to get my attention.&nbsp; No answer. I shrugged it</b>
<br><b>off thinking friends were messing about downstairs.</b>
<br><b>Then it happened a second time and this time when I</b>
<br><b>answered I walked to the railings to look down into</b>
<br><b>the scene shop. There wasn't anyone there so I turned</b>
<br><b>to the other 3 and asked if they had heard a voice</b>
<br><b>calling my name and they all said 'yes, they had'. I</b>
<br><b>decided at 12:30 in the morning I was not going to</b>
<br><b>waste any more time on games and asked for everyone to</b>
<br><b>enter the studio and get started. I closed the doors</b>
<br><b>to the backstage and settled in the 2nd row of seats</b>
<br><b>with my stage manager and started rehearsals.</b>
<br><b>Approximately 30 minutes into rehearsals I felt a</b>
<br><b>strong presence sitting behind me, so I turned and</b>
<br><b>looked into the seats and saw a dark male figure</b>
<br><b>seated in the last seat next to the wall in the last</b>
<br><b>row audience left. Since I wasn't nervous or uneasy</b>
<br><b>about this guy I didn't mention it to anyone. The 2</b>
<br><b>actors finally got a comic bit right and very softly,</b>
<br><b>but audibly we heard a laugh coming from that area.</b>
<br><b>The actors and my stage manager looked at me with a</b>
<br><b>"you're the boss and the oldest...what do we do?"</b>
<br><b>expression. I told them to keep going since they were</b>
<br><b>doing something right.</b>
<br><b>Rehearsals continued for about another 15-20 minutes</b>
<br><b>when I decided to call a break and grab a cigarette in</b>
<br><b>the backstage area.&nbsp; When we entered the male figure</b>
<br><b>audience left was gone but was replaced by a larger</b>
<br><b>and darker male figure pacing the back row but</b>
<br><b>audience right this time.&nbsp; This entity was by no means</b>
<br><b>easy going or appreciative of our being in his space.</b>
<br><b>I told them to ignore this one completely and just</b>
<br><b>play to me. Every time my actress would start to try</b>
<br><b>and say her lines a nasty voice would hiss from the</b>
<br><b>back row and call her names like slut or whore. This</b>
<br><b>happened twice and without turning around I told "it"</b>
<br><b>that he was not welcomed and we had the space and to</b>
<br><b>leave and leave now. He then hissed at me and said I</b>
<br><b>will leave before he did. That had never happened to</b>
<br><b>me before!! They were supposed to leave when not</b>
<br><b>invited so I turned to my stage manager and had</b>
<br><b>planned to tell her to start cleaning up but before I</b>
<br><b>had the chance my attention was caught on stage by the</b>
<br><b>image of a young girl bloodied and bruised being raped</b>
<br><b>while being held down by another student. I knew it</b>
<br><b>was just an image frozen in time but the thing behind</b>
<br><b>me started laughing like it knew what I had seen. I</b>
<br><b>told everyone to pack it in and leave. The other 3</b>
<br><b>were already frightened by the 2nd spirit so they</b>
<br><b>didn't hesitate to grab their things when the sound of</b>
<br><b>a young woman's scream began. We couldn't tell where</b>
<br><b>it was coming from since it sounded like it was in the</b>
<br><b>theatre and in the scene shop below. I told the others</b>
<br><b>to head downstairs and out and I would turn the lights</b>
<br><b>off.&nbsp; As they ran down the stairs the screaming</b>
<br><b>stopped and I heard the voice say to me "I told you</b>
<br><b>you would leave 1st" and laughed. I ran out and down</b>
<br><b>the stairs when I had remembered I didn't turn off the</b>
<br><b>lights.&nbsp; As I debated whether or not to go back up</b>
<br><b>when the lights turned off by themselves and a voice</b>
<br><b>floated down the stair well and said "See you</b>
<br><b>tomorrow".</b>
<br><b>The next day I went into the chair person's office and</b>
<br><b>asked if I could reschedule my rehearsals/performances</b>
<br><b>into a different space but without telling why, I</b>
<br><b>didn't want to appear crazy! I was told 'no' because</b>
<br><b>of so many student productions at that time there</b>
<br><b>wasn't available space.&nbsp; I was then told that whatever</b>
<br><b>I had experienced is normal and everyone has to deal</b>
<br><b>with it and since I was the older student it was up to</b>
<br><b>me to keep the younger ones calm.&nbsp; And I was told in</b>
<br><b>no uncertain terms that this is departmental and no</b>
<br><b>one outside the Theatre Dept. needs to know.&nbsp; End of</b>
<br><b>story as far as she was concerned.</b>
<br><b>I would like to note that my show, which was in a</b>
<br><b>line-up of 3 shows in a weekend, went off without a</b>
<br><b>hitch. The other 2 shows had electrical and sound</b>
<br><b>problems, cast members became ill on stage and such.</b>
<br><b>This is quite long as it is so I will not go into</b>
<br><b>other stories related to this theatre. However if</b>
<br><b>anyone is interested in hearing about them feel free</b>
<br><b>to contact me.</b>
<br><b>Good night and pleasant dreams!</b>

<p><b>Ghosts Houses</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: amber_johnson91@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>8-10-04 I use to live in a house in Michigan. It all started when
I was little. My parents said that when I was little I use to play with
a ghost. I remember it he was bruswed and had stab wounds in him. I would
never see his face though. We come to find out that a guy killed his son
then killed himself and his newborn. They never found the wife. Well when
I lived there everytime someone would get punished you would see things
fly around the house you would hear someone running from one side of the
house to the other when everyone was downstairs. And I am not the only
one who see's or hears it my family does to.Our most resent experience
was a couple of weeks ago. I was in the house by my self and I heared footsteps
and I turn around and no one was there. So I'm waiting some more and I
get the feeling that some one was staring at me. So I look agian no one
was there . So I run out and it was my sisters turn and the same thing
had happened to her.</b><b></b>
