<br><b>&nbsp;$50 Dollar Offer</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ROCKYTOPHOUND@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;This was a story told to me by my father of something that
happened to him years ago while he was a young man.</b>
<br><b>There was a house just outside the town of Maryville Tennessee that
had the reputation of being haunted. My father never was one of those people
who believed in ghosts and regularly made fun of people who did.</b>
<br><b>As I said, this happened a good many years ago when $50 00 was a
whole lot more than it is today.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The owner of this house, which was said to house hundreds
of slaves during the civil war, was so sure that he had a haunted house
that he advertised that he would give $50.00 to anyone that could spend
the night, from midnight to 6:00 AM, in the house. This piqued my fathers
interest because he was short of funds at the time and, being a nonbeliever,
he figured it would be an easy way to get him some money. He went to the
owner and made arrangements to spend the next night in the house but, before
he could do this, the Aluminum Company of America, where he worked, contacted
him and told him that they needed him to come in to work on that day.</b>
<br><b>He had a couple of buddies in the apartment with him when ALCOA
called him to work who were in the Marine Corps. He had been telling them
how he was going to make some easy money by spending the night in that
house, so, when he told them that he was going to have to cancel they told
him "Oh no you're not." "We are not afraid of ghosts and we can use the
money too so we will go in your place."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The arrangements were made with the owner and, promptly at
midnight, the two marines arrived at the old house. The owner told them
that the rules were fairly simple and all they had to do was stay in that
house, without coming out the door, until six O'clock, AM, he would give
them both $50.00.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The two marines went into the house at midnight right on the
nose and the owner was to wait out the night and pay the cash the next
morning. He settled down right outside the door as there was no other way
out of the house, his having sealed the other exits before he advertised.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;To make a long story short, at about 2:00 AM, both of the
marines came flying out of the front door and didn't even stop to tell
the owner what they had seen. They didn't even slow down and they never
did want to talk about their experience to anyone from that day forward.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; This greatly affected my Father as he knew both of them well
and he said that neither of them was afraid of anything. The owner of the
house kept his house advertised for a while after that but he had no takers
because that town is fairly small and almost everyone knew the marines
and no one wanted to experience whatever it was that scared them so badly.
My Father told me that maybe the best thing that could have happened did
when the company called him in to work that night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;He told me that he could have made further arrangements to
stay in the house but he never did. I think that maybe he was afraid of
having his opinion changed.</b>

<br><b>Vapor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: baxlee2@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1999 my brother David started telling me he felt like someone
was is his room.&nbsp; While he was sleeping he would feel someone sit
on the edge of the bed (water bed! no mistaking that!).&nbsp; As the weeks
passed this feeling became stronger, so he started waiting at night to
see if he could actually see something.&nbsp; He described it as a heat
vapor, like you would see on a blacktop road on a hot day.&nbsp; It would
come down the hall and into his room.&nbsp; Eventually this, whatever,
started becoming very, very friendly.&nbsp; Putting pressure on his body
in certian areas...&nbsp; We did take a picture of me sitting on his bed
and received some sort of shadow (white and black) behind me.&nbsp; He
moved out of our moms and swears the, whatever, followed him to his new
home.&nbsp; He dosen't feel frightened, just wonders what exactly it needs.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Stories from Guatemala</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: babie_devil788@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hey everyone..now this story didnt happen to me but to my dad...just
by hearing it gave me the creeps..it took awhile for me to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Ok well when my dad was a kid he lived in guatemala. he had a good
childhood but he wasnt an angel. one night he decided to tag along with
his to older borthers and friends of his brothers as well. So, it was dark&nbsp;
around 11 or 12 at night and they&nbsp; were up for trouble. They saw a
woman and two men together go into the cementary, and being who they all
were they chose to follow them. When they got into the cementary they had
lost the peopl they were following. But they weren't gonna let that stop
their fun..they decided to stay at the cementary for a while. When they
began to get bored they thought that maybe they should hed home. but when
they started to walk to the exit they felt something evil behind them and
when they turned around their worst fear was right there. They saw something
coming closer and closer very fast. My dad said it was shaped like a huge
bull. Their first instinct was to run ..but they couldnt their feet weighed
do much! As hard as they tried they could omly move a couplr of steps.
at that point they were crying and terrified as the thing got closer. Then
one of them started to pray and before they knew it they were running and
jumping over the fence. Thats where the cops found them and took them home.</b>
<br><b>second story:&nbsp; now this happened to my aunt i have to say it
sound like a terrifying night mare thta no one want to go through.</b>
<br><b>When my aunt was 8 she to lived in guatemala and she was the oldest
of the girls her mom told her to go help out her aunt at her house because
she had no one, she had a huge house and was alone most of the time. so
my aunt walked to her house but to get there she had to cross a small bridge
to get over a pond, so when she got their she help hey aunt out alot till
about 9 pm that was when her aunt told her to go home and get some rest.
So thats what she did....but as she was walking on the bridge she saw something
that haunts her today she saw the Llorona( for those who dont&nbsp; know
what that is, shes supposed to be a lady who let her children drown in
a lake and now after ealizing what she had done she roams the streets and
has an awful scream that no one wants to hear, anbd she is said to have
a face like a horse and long black hair that runs down to her feet.)She
was terrified...the llorona kept coming closer and closer. My aunt bent
her head and began to pray as hard as she could&nbsp; and when she looked
up she was gone. She ran home as fast as he feet could take her and when
she entered the home she turned on everylight in her path..the hallway..kitchen...living
room...staitcase all the way to her bedroom. She locked all the doors and
windows and when she got into her room she locked her door and turned all
the lights on. She jumped onto her bed and prayed for her der life as she
heard the screams of the llorona outside. Then when she looked at her door
she saw a shadow move across outside her room this scared her even more
becasue she knew no one was home and they wouldnt be home for hours. She
began to hear footsteps outside and saw more shadows..she prayed all night
until hey mom and sisters cam home. When they went to her door they were
tel ng her to open it but she wouldnt budge(it is said that the llorona
can become anyone and imitater their voice) she didnt know if she opened
the door she would see the llorona standing there but after a good hour
of begging her to open teh door my aunt managed to get up and unlock the
door where she saw her mom and sisters. They said when they saw her she
was the most pale person they had ever seen and she was crying hysterically.
She never forgot that day.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Maybe We have a Ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tialynn82@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>We live on a beautiful 40 acre ranch in the mountains of southern
New Mexico. We moved here a little over a year ago. The first night we
stayed here my husband felt someone pushing on his leg while laying in
bed. Our cats were still at our other house. The next night I thought I
saw someone walk into the kitchen. We saw a few other shadows move and
stuff but nothing really serious. Then one day I was sitting on the couch
waiting for the menu screen to come up on my sons movie. We have a glass
door on out entertainment center and it was facing the front window. Anyway
as I was sitting there I saw someone in a white baseball cap walk past
the window. I thought my husband was home but wondered when he got a white
baseball cap. I got up to see if it was him and it wasn't. My son and I
were the only people on the ranch. We have also seen someone walking through
the ostrich pens My son will laugh like someone is playing with him. I
will wake up in the middle of the night to him laughing so loud and hard
like someone is tickling him. He use to look between the refrigerator and
the wall and just laugh. That I think is the only thing that really weirds
us out. We moved into a different house on the ranch and things have been
strange here too. We will hear knocking on the side of the house, my brother
said he would hear footsteps on the deck at night, and the front door will
open and close by itself sometimes. Nothing has ever really scared us it
has just been strange. But the strangest thing we have seen happened last
fall. We were out late and driving along our road we always see the "black
dogs" run across the road. But we got to our driveway and I saw a big thing
walking down the road. Sorry I don't know what else to call it. LOL But
anyway I said "What is that???" My husband didn't see it until he was turning
the truck. It was a very bright outline. It wasn't a cow or horse or person
because we did not see definite legs, arms, nothing. It just kinda looked
like a blob walking down the road. I wanted to go back and see if maybe
it was a person and they just looked strange because of the headlights
but was to afraid. I had thought it was a horse at first because it was
so big. But I think we would have been able to see legs and a tail or head
if it was a horse. I know there is a grave on the other side of the road
on a friends property that is the grave of a woman that passed in the late
1800's. Maybe its her. We are not going to ask whoever it is to leave,
because maybe they had a home here first. It never bothers us just makes
us say "whoa" sometimes.</b>

<br><b>Hi I love your site.&nbsp; I have had many experiences happen to
me, but I had to share this one.&nbsp; About 20 years ago, we lived in
a suburb of Chicago.&nbsp; We had just moved to this house.&nbsp; I started
making friends with the Moms of the children that would come to play.&nbsp;
I made a friend that lived a block away.&nbsp; She told me this happened
to her.&nbsp; One night she and her husband were sleeping.&nbsp; She woke
up suddenly to find a little girl standing at the foot of her bed, and
she asked her "Are you my Mother?"</b>
<br><b>They had just bought the home.&nbsp; They asked their sales lady
if anyone had died in that house.&nbsp; They said before they moved there,
a swimming pool was in the back yard,( now covered up with dirt and grass).&nbsp;
And a little girl had drowned in that pool.</b>
<br><b>She must have been looking for her Mother.&nbsp; I still have chills

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all this happend many years ago. My</b>
<br><b>parents still live in the house that I believe was</b>
<br><b>haunted, as do many people people who have stayed</b>
<br><b>over.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first experience was when my parents were</b>
<br><b>fighting so my mother decided she would sleep on the</b>
<br><b>couch. She awoke to her dog growling and barking at</b>
<br><b>nothing she could see, then a chill went thru her and</b>
<br><b>something touched her neck. Ofcourse she went to bed</b>
<br><b>with no further thoughts about what happend.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My older sister had a knee surgery and was sleeping</b>
<br><b>in the living room fold out couch when the dog started</b>
<br><b>growling yet again at nothing. She took it as though</b>
<br><b>the drugs that were prescribed to her and she was</b>

<br><b>&nbsp; My Aunt stayed over probably a year later, we still</b>

<p><b>The Boy at camp</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: solidcrust@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I’m from Kuwait so don’t judge my English,</b>
<br><b>I’d like to share something before I begin my story, some people
believe that the devil “Satan” is the opposing force of God, and that he’s
got powers comparable to God’s, but let me inform you that there is no
power even close to god’s power, and “Satan” is just a demon and he’s God’s
slave like all beings, such as humans, animals, plants… etc, and the most
important thing you must know is that the strongest power Satan’s got over
you is to trick you into committing sins, nothing more, so don’t overestimate
who’s not worthy of such power, this has nothing to do with my story but
I felt responsible to tell you that, due to what’s written by some people.</b>
<br><b>Here’s my story: this happened about 4 years ago when I was in winter
camp (Kuwait is a very hot country so winter is the most appropriate season
to go camping), one night we were all just sitting in our tents waiting
for the lights to turn off (usually at 10:30 pm), the tents are very big
that there is room for 6 people to sleep, so we were 6 in this tent talking
about the usual spooky ghost stories, freaking each other out, I’m the
kind of guys who almost never gets scared so obviously I was the one who’s
doing all the scaring, after a while the lights went out and we got to
sleep, I woke up about 2 hours later (which is not strange at all) from
the light that’s coming from outside through the open tent door, then I
thought “who opened the door for the mosquitoes?” when I opened my eyes
and looked to the door, I saw a little boy about 10 years old, he was wearing
the usual winter gear, I remember him very pale, “what does he want at
this hour of the night” I thought, I didn’t say a word, I was just looking
at him without him noticing me, then he grabbed&nbsp; what seemed like
a small chest from the ground and lifting it up then disappearing in his
place!, I was shocked like hell, the next day I didn’t remember that event
until after breakfast, I started looking for that boy in the junior’s camp
(which is right next to our camp) to see if I was imagining the disappearing
part, but I didn’t find him. Thank you for your time.</b>

<p><b>Ghost in the Laundry Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rachelle.rogers@cox.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>For a long time I had experiences where I would write off as my imagination.&nbsp;
I always heard bunch of my family members talking about seeing the spirit
of someone close to us after they died.&nbsp; My first job was at a nursing
home and of course there was a lot of ghost stories about the place.&nbsp;
A bunch of times working the evening shift by myself, I'll always freak
myself out from a noise.&nbsp; One night my best friend and I was working
in the laundry in the evening time.&nbsp; Around that time of night the
resident were asleep, lights were out in the rooms, the hall were dim,
and the nurse shifts were like a skeleton crew.&nbsp; Sometimes you did
kind of feel alone in a loud isolated laundry room back of the building.&nbsp;
One night my friend and I was about ready to take a smoke break in the
middle of our shift.&nbsp; She had to pass out linens and other stuff around
the building.&nbsp; While I was waiting for her, I was watching the wash
machines spin clothes around it.&nbsp; Then it felt like someone was standing
behind me.&nbsp; I thought it was my friend trying to sneak up on me.&nbsp;
As I barley turned around, I saw a white smokey like human shape figure.&nbsp;
A split second I turned around and the figure disappear.&nbsp; A few seconds
later my friend walked seeing me standing there speechless.&nbsp; I asked
a weird question where I thought didn't make sense.&nbsp; "Did you come
in here right before you just came in here"? as I said to my friend walking
in the room.&nbsp; She gave me a weird look as she walked in.&nbsp; I told
what I thought I saw behind me a few second before she came.&nbsp; She
said one night when she was working by herself she said she walked in the
laundry and was looking at the wash machines and I a reflection of the
same thing I just saw.&nbsp; I needed a cigarette after that, so we started
walking down the halls.&nbsp; The hall lights where dim enough where we
can see are shadows on the walls.&nbsp; She looked at my shadow on the
wall and said " That ghost is the same height as you".&nbsp; I was really
stunned then because I never told her that, just what it looked like.&nbsp;
When I saw whatever I saw it was like my height about 5'3.&nbsp; When I
told everyone about the weird experiences said it was my own shadow I saw.&nbsp;
Then I ask about my seeing my shadow in mid air and disappearing when I
turned around, and my friend was just saying she saw it too.&nbsp; I would
write it off as my imagination, but I never told my friend about the ghost
being my height and when I was describing the figure to her she was talking
ahead about it like was really saw it with her own eyes.&nbsp; I no longer
work their anymore, I think it's been way over 5 years now.&nbsp; I quit
there to find a better paying job after high school and I was getting attach
to some of the residents that lived there.&nbsp; The emotions started getting
to me when a resident died that I was very fond of, somehow it felt like
losing a bunch of grandparents.&nbsp; However, when it's time to talk to
family and friends about ghost stories, this one is the one I can say and
believe that it wasn't my imagination.&nbsp; I wonder sometimes if it was
someone letting know in a way that they are alright now.</b>

<p><b>Different Place and Different Times</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kristasanford@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever since I was a small child funny things have happened around
me.&nbsp; My first memories are from my parents house in Northern California
when I was between 5 and 10 (I can't remember my exact age).&nbsp; I have
always had a hard time getting to sleep at night, one night I was lying
in bed awake trying to talk myself to sleep and I was overcome with a feeling
of fear, fear so crippling that I was afraid to move, scream, get up or
even close my eyes.&nbsp; When I looked up from my bed into a dark corner
where the walls and ceiling met, I saw a pair of red eyes staring at me,
projected out of a dark cloud in the corner.&nbsp; At times I would hear
footsteps in the hall even though I knew that everyone else was in bed
sound asleep, I would get up to check and of course everyone was asleep
in bed.&nbsp; The hall was just outside my door and had the squeakiest
floor known to man until my parents tiled it recently.&nbsp; The most frightening
experience of all was another time when I was around 10, was lying in bed
trying to get to sleep and I looked up at my dresser against the wall on
the other side of the room, and I saw what I can only describe and a little
demon with horns, it was maybe 8 inches tall, striding back and forth on
the top of my dresser and staring at me laughing, it then proceded to sit
down on the edge of the dresser, with its feet dangling down from the edge
and stared at me.&nbsp; I got the distinct impression that it was laughing
at me because I was afraid.&nbsp; It evetually disapeared much to my relief
but I don't think that I slept that night.&nbsp; Even when I got older,
if I was ever up late at night when there was no one else there, or everyone
was asleep, in certain rooms I would have the distint impression that something
unseen was watching me, and again that horrible paralyzing feeling of fear,
so intense that I couldn't make myself move, even to shut my eyes, or utter
a sound.&nbsp; I always had the intuition that I didn't want what I was
feeling there to do more than watch because it was very dark and very evil,
and I was afraid to move because I didn't want to give it any reason to
note my presence anymore than it already did.&nbsp; Whatever it is in my
parents house, it has lessend greatly, because I don't feel it anymore
when I go back home to visit.</b>
<br><b>The next time I would encounter something like this was after I
left college and moved in with a bunch of my friends into a house near
Seattle.&nbsp; A two story house with four bedrooms, I think it was built
in the 70's.&nbsp; Anyhow, many times when I was getting ready for work
in the bathroom (the mirror in the bathroom was placed along one wall such
that, if the door was open that you could look into the mirror and see
down the hall behind you and a little into the two bedrooms at the end
of the hall, one on each side), I would see a man reflected in the mirror,
behind me and down the hall, but only just out of the corner of my eye,
when I would turn to look he would be gone.&nbsp; I didn't get any feeling
that he was malevolent, and I didn't feel fear when I saw him, I just knew
that he was there in the house, living along with us.&nbsp; Sometimes I
would be downstairs watching TV, and I knew for certain that there was
no one else in the house and I would here foot steps on the second floor
just above me in the living room area.&nbsp; And one time I was just getting
up from bed after a good read in the morning, and again, no one else was
there, and my door had been open just a crack, and just as I was about
to get up the door opened itself, of course there was no one there, my
window was closed as were all the others in the house and it would not
have been possible for air currents to open the door since it drug against
the carpet enough that you had to push it open.&nbsp; When I brought it
up to one of my roomies, who I knew wouldn't laugh at me because she also
takes this stuff quite seriously, she said that she also had seen the ghost
haunting our house and heard the footsteps upstairs when the house was
empty and she was downstairs using the PC.&nbsp; In this house I never
felt the crippling fear like in my parents house though, perhaps a difference
in the nature of the ghost haunting this house.&nbsp; I never doubted what
I have een or heard since I saw the door open by itself, in a circumstance
where there are absolutely no other explanations for it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Regarding Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: unit0012000@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a couple more pointers to add regarding
ghosts. Every August, there is what the Japanese call Obon season when
the spirits of ones ancestory returns home... reports of family ghost has
been made during that time. i have a incident of such a case. it was about
11:00 on a monday night... I was watching X-files on TNT in the living
room. I was in the mood for a good scare or so i thought... where I was
sitting from i have clear line of sight of the kitchen and thats when the
sink light turned on its own!!! I was at a lost for word. my mother told
me that it happens all the time but than I asked my grandpa (a contractor)
and he said that the light tuning on its own never occurs unless the light
was already on due to the fact that sometimes the light turns on but its
real dim. That is not the case though because I can see when the light
is dim... we have white flooring in the kitchen and light reflects very
well on the flooring. besides....the only light on was the living room
lamp. I ask myself how the light turns on on its own.... than it hit me
that its august and its obon season. It could be my recently past great
grandmother saying hello.... :)</b><b></b>

<br><b>NE Kent County, Grand Rapids Area</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ChrstSchutt@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I grew up in Cannon Township, outside of Grand Rapids, MI, in an
area that had been abandonned as productive farmland much due to the sharpness
of its hills and sandy bitterness of the soil. Hardwood forest had reclaimed
much of the land though there remained fields tucked away in the woods.
There are legends of Indians and frontier lumber era trechery that took
place in the area but these are vague and largely unknown to those who
have recently made Cannon a bedroom community. It was the late 70's or
early 80's when I spent much time in our woods which lay between the unconnected
dead end of an East-West road and the North-South road it had always been
meant to meet. Well, my friend lived on that North-South road and I on
that East-West road and we travelled through woodland tractor trails between
eachother's homes and adjoining properties. One Summer, late afternoon
around dusk were headed from my house to his house. My father, a truck
driver, had not yet returned from work and I had chosen his tractor as
transportation. Coming through out of the woods into a small field, (the
"Little Field") I turned off the trail an flored the tractor through the
middle of the weed choked field. Several bumps and I had knocked something
loose. The tractor stalled and stopped. My friend and I, knowing that we
had to get the tractor back in the barn with no evidence of rowdy play,
tried to find the source of the problem to effect repairs.&nbsp; It was
now growing dark and very difficult to see. Closer to his home than mine,
we decided to climb the hill toward his house, get his father's tractor,
a tool kit, a flashlight, and return. This we accomplished. Now we were
back at the stalled tractor,&nbsp; his father's tractor's nose up to mine.
The dim lights of his tractor shining to create a halo around us. My friend
was working with some tubing while I held a flashlight when I percieved
a man at the edge of the light, maybe 15 feet off to my back left shoulder.
He wore bib overalls and a tractor cap, had his hands in his pockets and
was watching us. Thinking he was my father having come to scold us, (which
afterward made no sense since niether my father nor my friend's father
had this stature or wore bib overalls) I ignored him as teenagers sometimes
do when caught in the wrong by their parents. "Go away I've got it," I
thought. After perhaps a minute my friend said, "Give me that flashlight."
He took it and shined it out into an empty field. We were out in the middle,
far from the woods. Then he said something like, "Who was that guy? Did
you see that guy?" That anyone should be out there on my family's property
in the middle of the field at that time of night and observe us with no
greeting is highly unlikely. Then to dissappear in the middle of the field,
how? We both described this apparition in the same way,clothing, cap and
stature all matched up. Who was he? someone from the family that had farmed
this land way back in the 30's, '40's and '50's? By the way, we turned
the crank and the tractor started right up. We weren't quite clear if we
had really moved or repaired anything but there it was, ready to go. This
has long remained a mystery to me. I was seldom afraid of the woods. I
even often walked the nearly three quarter mile path back from my friend's
house and mine at night with no flashlight. There was no light pollution
in Cannon at that time and I navigated by the feeling of the sand beneath
my feet and silhouettes of large trees. Sometimes (not always) however,
for no reason, when feeling perfectly safe, a feeling of sudden dread would
come over me. I fealt as if someone had just joined me in my walk. Amidst
August night sounds of ciccadas and tree frogs I would think I heard the
nearby snort of a horse. The trail, coming into the woods from the Little
Field dipped into a cove. This cove always seemed to have a presence in
it. There have been many times in that spot, regardless of time or season,
that I have turned around, expecting to greet an approaching neighbor walking
dogs or out for a stroll and have found no one. I was by all visual evidence
alone.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Possibly still Skeptical</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ivory_tusk@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've lived in the same rental house for about a year, and just felt
like it</b>
<br><b>was like any other home I'd lived in before--somewhat old, with
its own</b>
<br><b>history, but nothing out of the ordinary.</b>
<br><b>I am a single mother with a two-year-old daughter.&nbsp; When she
was still</b>
<br><b>considerably young, about eight months old or so, her dad and I
began to</b>
<br><b>have some serious problems.&nbsp; Since we were not married and
he had no</b>
<br><b>interest in really being a part of her life, I left the house we
had all</b>
<br><b>occupied.&nbsp; That started a series of moves that finally landed
us in the</b>
<br><b>rental house I have already mentioned.</b>
<br><b>The house was originally built sometime in the '40s, and stands
in the NE</b>
<br><b>area of Albuquerque, New Mexico, but I'm still not very clear of
its own</b>
<br><b>past.&nbsp; The only thing I knew about it was that the landlord
had lived there</b>
<br><b>himself for quite a few years, and that various family members of
his had</b>
<br><b>lived there for quite some time as well...But the people who lived
there</b>
<br><b>right before me had some ties with a notorious bank robber in the</b>
<br><b>Albuquerque area.&nbsp; With them, however, the only thing the landlord
worried</b>
<br><b>about was drug dealings and other shady behavior going on.&nbsp;
They were</b>
<br><b>evicted, and seven months later, I moved in.&nbsp; And as I mentioned
before,</b>
<br><b>I've lived there for a year now, and am still quite happy there.</b>
<br><b>It wasn't until March of last year, that I had thought of anything
strange</b>
<br><b>going on there.&nbsp; I had a roommate move in at the time, who
was rather a</b>
<br><b>fanatic about going out to haunted places and looking for ghosts.&nbsp;
He told</b>
<br><b>me that he felt the presence of a young-ish boy in the house, but
that he</b>
<br><b>wasn't a bad spirit.&nbsp; I really just kind of laughed it off,
thinking the guy</b>
<br><b>was a nut job, but I still enjoyed his stories as cheap entertainment.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks after that, I was sitting in a chair in the living room,</b>
<br><b>watching television.&nbsp; My daughter was spending time with her
dad, and I was</b>
<br><b>tired from work.&nbsp; I had just begun to drift off, but I was
still hearing the</b>
<br><b>television.&nbsp; And although I had brushed off what happened later
as a dream,</b>
<br><b>now I'm not quite sure.&nbsp; I saw a sandy-blonde haired boy, maybe
about 11 or</b>
<br><b>twelve standing right in front of me, laughing.&nbsp; When I really
tried to look</b>
<br><b>at him, his smile became menacing and he raised his fist to punch
me.&nbsp; All I</b>
<br><b>remember is his fist coming toward my face and then I jolted straight
up in</b>
<br><b>the chair, my eyes wide open.&nbsp; There was no sign of a boy,
the room was</b>
<br><b>still quiet except for the drone of the television, and I was still
feeling</b>
<br><b>rather groggy...So I really did just decide that I had dreamed the
whole</b>
<br><b>thing and nothing was going on.</b>
<br><b>Then, there was one night in June when my boyfriend, my roommate,
and I were</b>
<br><b>up talking really late into the night, and we all distinctly heard
footsteps</b>
<br><b>in the hall.&nbsp; We didn't see anything, but we all heard the
floorboards creak</b>
<br><b>with the weight of someone's feet.&nbsp; This time I didn't laugh
it off so</b>
<br><b>easily...And although I know nothing about spirits and such, I did
what I</b>
<br><b>could to fill the space with positive energy and quietly asked,
although I</b>
<br><b>was feeling rather abnormal and freakish, that if anyone was there
that they</b>
<br><b>be at peace and leave the area.</b>
<br><b>My roommate left in July (financial difficulties kept him from paying
the</b>
<br><b>rent), and the house was entirely re-arranged so that my boyfriend
could</b>
<br><b>move his stuff in.&nbsp; No incidents of anything "out of the ordinary"
occurred</b>
<br><b>for quite a while.&nbsp; Then, about a week ago, I was exhausted
and had had a</b>
<br><b>difficult time with my ex, so I had gone to sleep considerably earlier
than</b>
<br><b>usual...Right after I had put my daughter to bed, so a little before
8:00.</b>
<br><b>At three o' clock in the morning or so, I was awakened by my boyfriend
who</b>
<br><b>was visibly shaken.</b>
<br><b>"I was playing video games," he said, "and I saw someone in the
hallway.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was a woman, so I thought it was you.&nbsp; I called to you, asking
if I was</b>
<br><b>being too loud, but there was no answer...I just saw what I thought
was you</b>
<br><b>walk from the bathroom to your study (right across the hall from
the</b>
<br><b>bathroom).&nbsp; But when I opened the study door, it was dark there,
and nobody</b>
<br><b>was in there."</b>
<br><b>As I said before, he was shaking, and he kept repeating that it
was a woman,</b>
<br><b>not much taller than me, dressed in pale blue clothing.&nbsp; She
was solid, she</b>
<br><b>made footsteps, and the floorboards creaked.&nbsp; He saw her walk
into my study</b>
<br><b>area.&nbsp; The dog apparently saw her, too, because he was growling
and pacing</b>
<br><b>like I've never seen him pace before.&nbsp; Before he had woken
me, my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>also went in to check on my daughter.&nbsp; She was lying in bed
with her covers</b>
<br><b>pulled tightly around her, her eyes wide open and looking around.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>went in to check on her, she was drifting once more into a comfortable</b>
<br><b>sleep...But her eyes would still jerk open and look around from
time to</b>
<br><b>time, until her eyelids got too heavy to hold sleep back.</b>
<br><b>Now, there was no doubt in my mind that something...Someone was
there who</b>
<br><b>really shouldn't be.&nbsp; Once again, I really didn't know what
to do...If this</b>
<br><b>really was an entity from another plane of existence, I really didn't
want</b>
<br><b>to tick it off...Heck, I've seen enough horror movies to know what
happens</b>
<br><b>when a spirit gets angry!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; So, I turned on some lights,
and walked all</b>
<br><b>through the house trying to create as peaceful an atmosphere as
possible.</b>
<br><b>Although I was also a little shaken, I didn't want to scare my boyfriend</b>
<br><b>anymore by also appearing frightened...So I asked in a calm voice
that</b>
<br><b>whoever was there to go in a good and peaceful way, to find rest
and</b>
<br><b>calmness, and to leave this space that can no longer hold it.&nbsp;
But at the</b>
<br><b>same time, when my alarm clock went off the next morning, I couldn't
help</b>
<br><b>but wonder if I had dreamed it all...</b>
<br><b>Since then, nothing out of the ordinary has happened here.&nbsp;
My former</b>
<br><b>roommate even dropped by at one point, just to say hi, and after
a few</b>
<br><b>hours, commented that the house felt lighter, that the ghosts had
apparently</b>
<br><b>decided to leave.&nbsp; I didn't say anything, just laughed the
way I used to</b>
<br><b>when I considered his comments cheap entertainment...But there was
more</b>
<br><b>significance now to what he said...And I hope that if there really
was</b>
<br><b>something there, that it was able to find some peace and understanding,
and</b>
<br><b>was able to leave with no regrets.</b>
<br><b>I really don't know what to believe, but I have a feeling that something</b>
<br><b>happened in that house that was considerably more serious than some
drug</b>
<br><b>dealings and some shady behavior of bank robbers...Whatever happened,
it was</b>
<br><b>a long time ago, and now I'm just trying to figure out the history
of the</b>
<br><b>place to see if there really honestly could have been something
more going</b>
<br><b>on than what I want to believe.&nbsp; Although in all honesty, sometimes
it still</b>
<br><b>feels like all of these occurrances are all due to a simple case
of an</b>
<br><b>overactive imagination.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Scratches in the Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lucky_duc@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm not sure if this qualifies as a ghost story but it sure freaked
me out.</b>
<br><b>About a year ago or two, I use to have scratches on my body when
i woke up.</b>
<br><b>People told me it's just me itching and not knowing i scratch myself.
As</b>
<br><b>time passed i began to believe it was a ghost who was doing that
to me.</b>
<br><b>Later on, maybe a couple of months, i had this incident where i
heard this</b>
<br><b>voice calling me. It was around maybe midnight. My brother was sitting
in</b>
<br><b>the liviing room watching tv and i was in the kitchen reading a
book. All of</b>
<br><b>a sudden i hear this voice calling my name. I freaked out but didnt
scream.</b>
<br><b>i just looked up to see if it was my bro playing a joke on me but
he was</b>
<br><b>just staring at the tv. I go back to reading and the voice calls
me again</b>
<br><b>the second after. I freeze still staring at the book trying to listen
to</b>
<br><b>where its coming from. It calls again. I look to my right. No one.
I look</b>
<br><b>back at my bro. Nothing. Then recently, very recently (last night,
August</b>
<br><b>8th 2004) i was alone downstairs using the laptop around 11:20 pm.
All of a</b>
<br><b>sudden i hear this clicking on the ceiling towards the wall to my
right. I</b>
<br><b>thought it was maybe a bird or something outside but i've heard
woodpeckers</b>
<br><b>before and they didnt click they thumped. This sound was clicking
maybe 4-5</b>
<br><b>times in sessions of maybe 4 or 5 times. Everytime i looked up,
it clicked</b>
<br><b>its 4th or 5th one then stopped so i went back to using the laptop
waiting</b>
<br><b>for it to click again. Bam. It happens. After maybe 4 times i get
freaked</b>
<br><b>out and decide to go to sleep, hoping i dont see a ghost as i take
a drink</b>
<br><b>of water before i go up to bed. That's my story. i didnt see anything
but</b>
<br><b>hey it freaked me out.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Steps</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: asmail2004@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hi this is Ash, and i have a place my friends and i like to check
out at</b>
<br><b>different times of day and night.&nbsp; everytime we go we get freaked
out.&nbsp; it</b>
<br><b>is called "the steps"&nbsp; well thats what we call it anyway.&nbsp;
it has been there</b>
<br><b>for along time.&nbsp; grandparents told us about it and they themselves
will not</b>
<br><b>drive by it and have not for 20 yrs or so.&nbsp; and it takes forever
to find it,</b>
<br><b>lol.&nbsp; down alot of country roads, small rock ones at that.&nbsp;
and off to the</b>
<br><b>side you will se two pillars and a set of steps inbetween them.&nbsp;
and kids</b>
<br><b>have spary painted alot of devil stuff on them.&nbsp; but that does
not take away</b>
<br><b>from the feeling you get.&nbsp; personally i have never gotten out
of the truck.</b>
<br><b>when i get close to this place i get this closed in feeling, and
when the</b>
<br><b>truck is stopped and whoever wants to go check it out gets out.&nbsp;
i get this</b>
<br><b>feeling that if i look at the steps something terrible will be there.&nbsp;
i</b>
<br><b>cant bring myself to look at them when my friends are up there.&nbsp;
there is a</b>
<br><b>foundation up farther into the woods that the "steps" lead to.&nbsp;
the house</b>
<br><b>was burnt down, story has it that the husband came home to find
his wife</b>
<br><b>with another man, and killed him there in the bed and chased his
wife down</b>
<br><b>into the cellar and killer her there.&nbsp; my friends say that
every time they</b>
<br><b>go up there to the foundation they can hear something fly thru the
trees and</b>
<br><b>every time they look up there is nothing there.&nbsp; but they say
it sounds</b>
<br><b>bigger than a bird alot bigger.&nbsp; and they can hear someone
talking to them a</b>
<br><b>mans voice and the first time they heard it they thought it was
the other</b>
<br><b>one talking to them.&nbsp; back at the truck they asked eachother
what they said</b>
<br><b>and no one spoke a word up there.&nbsp; but the celler is where
they get the</b>
<br><b>worst feeling. they said it was like someone was wanting to get
out and they</b>
<br><b>couldnt.&nbsp; they could feel whatever it was struggling.&nbsp;
i thought you would</b>
<br><b>like to hear about this place.&nbsp; also there is a church about
a 1/4 mile up</b>
<br><b>the road that is said to have unmarked graves next to it, my friend
said all</b>
<br><b>they want is to be noticed and remembered.&nbsp; email me back for
further</b>

<br><b>Wolfinger Cemetery - Toledo, Ohio</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RUaGhst2@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Wolfinger Cemetery</b>
<br><b>Central Ave.</b>
<br><b>Toledo, Ohio</b>
<br><b>Wolfinger Cemetery actually sits in the middle of Swan Creek Park.
Once in the park I found the side road that leads to the Cemetery. You
are welcomed in by a huge arched rod iron gate. It is a very old Cemetery
with Tombstones that date back to the late 1700s. It is a fairly small
Cemetery. I was driving through looking for the five graves sites of the
Family that had died within weeks of each other. It didn't take long to
find them. They are buried along the fence to the far right side of the
Cemetery. I got out of the car to read the names on the Tombstones (My
wife wouldn't leave the car ). They are the Ford Family. The Fathers name
was Wallace and the Mother Elizabeth. The Children's tombstones read Wallace,
Eliza &amp; Infant. They all passed away in the late 1800s. I couldn't
read the Tombstones because they are weather'd fairly bad but made out
the names. I didn't see anything Paranormal but felt an energy of some
sort while standing over the graves wondering what the true story of this
Family might be. I just had this strange feeling that they knew I was there
looking for them. I began to have a stronger feeling that they were waiting
for me. I said a short prayer for them and asked if any of them wanted
to communicate with me. Well, that's when I really got chills and felt
as though Eliza was with me. I tried to communicate with her but didn't
seem to get a visible response. After a few moments I went back to the
car where my Wife was waiting. She said she didn't like the Cemetery and
wouldn't want to be buried there herself. She was ready to leave. While
starting the car and we began to drive away, I felt as though Eliza didn't
want me to leave. I just felt her strong presence even in the car. Well,
that's when she made her presence known. My headlights began to turn on
and off by themselves. My wife asked me how in the world was I doing that
with the lights? I stopped the car and took my hands off the steering wheel
as my wife and I watched in amazement as the headlights and dashlights
continued to turn on and off more then a dozen times. I then backed the
car up to the Ford Family graves and thanked Eliza for the communication
and told her that she couldn't attach herself to me and that she had to
stay with her family. I also told her I would be back to visit again. My
wife and I then drove out of the Cemetery and drove about a mile down the
road when all of a sudden the car began it's light show again. Headlights
and Dashlights turning on and off repeatedly. I stopped the car in the
middle of the road and we watched again in amazement as the emergency flashers
began to blink as well. I told my wife that Eliza must still be with us.
My wife then said we had to go back to the Cemetery. Funny coming from
the same person that couldn't wait to get out of the Cemetery in the first
place. I turned the car around lights going off and on all the way back
to the Cemetery. I stopped at the Family graves again and then asked Eliza
this time to stay with her Family. By this time the Lights had stopped
performing there Paranormal light show. I drove away and back home without
another single incident with the headlights. It's been several days now
and I haven't had an electrical problem at all with the vehicle what's
so ever. Although my wife and I never saw Eliza in a human form, If you
stop by her graveside you'll definitely know she's there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Voices Down the Hall</b><b></b>

<p><b>When I was a very little girl I could never ever sleep with my door
closed</b>
<br><b>One night when my door was open as usual I woke up and heard my
name calling me</b>
<br><b>down the hall. So, I got up and looked down the hall to find every
light on in the kitchen,</b>
<br><b>it was just glowing. I decide to walk down the hall because I thought
it was my mom.</b>
<br><b>While I am walking down the hall I hear my name being called louder
and louder and</b>
<br><b>louder, it became so loud it started to hurt my ears. It also seemed
that the kitchen was</b>
<br><b>getting brighter and brighter. When I finally reach the kitchen
it turned pitch black, there</b>
<br><b>were absolutely no lights on at all and my name had stopped being
called. Since i was a</b>
<br><b>little girl I started to cry and my mom came out from her room to
comfort me. to this day</b>
<br><b>she still thinks I was sleepwalking.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Josephine’ House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:lepalmer@bellsouth.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>A friend of mine, Andrea, and her boyfriend, Dave, moved into a 1950’s</b>
<br><b>blockhouse in Saint Petersburg, Florida.&nbsp; I live in Jacksonville
and drove</b>
<br><b>down to see their new place.&nbsp; When I arrived I couldn't help
but notice that</b>
<br><b>they are directly across the street from an electrical switching
station.</b>
<br><b>Massive electrical equipment was constantly humming.&nbsp; There
were literally</b>
<br><b>hundreds of beautiful parrots that were lined up along the wires
making so</b>
<br><b>much noise it was almost unpleasant.&nbsp; Not long after I arrived
we were</b>
<br><b>sitting in the living room talking when I said “You know, ghostly
phenomena</b>
<br><b>is sometimes associated with electrical wires, maybe this house
is haunted.”</b>
<br><b>Andrea said something along the lines of possibly.&nbsp; We did
not discuss it</b>
<br><b>further, at least not that afternoon.</b>
<br><b>That night I was to sleep in the room at the end of a short hall.&nbsp;
There is</b>
<br><b>a bathroom door on the right, a bedroom door on the left and the
door at the</b>
<br><b>end of the hall led into the room I was staying in.&nbsp; I must
tell you that I</b>
<br><b>have to have my box fan on to sleep.&nbsp; I am a light sleeper
and without that</b>
<br><b>white noise, I have a heck of a time sleeping.&nbsp; So I set my
fan up on a</b>
<br><b>cardboard box.&nbsp; They still were in the process of unpacking
but this was the</b>
<br><b>only box in the bedroom.&nbsp; I turned in early and went straight
to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Around two in the morning, I woke up having to answer the call of
nature.</b>
<br><b>After I had finished I lay back on the bed and was almost asleep
when I</b>
<br><b>heard plain as day, the cardboard box sliding across the tile floors
(they</b>
<br><b>had NO carpet).&nbsp; I looked up expecting to see that one of their
dogs or</b>
<br><b>perhaps mine had followed me back into the room.&nbsp; I saw nothing,
the box was</b>
<br><b>still where I had set it and my fan was still running.&nbsp; So
I lay back again</b>
<br><b>and again, just when I was about to drift off, I heard the sound
of a box</b>
<br><b>sliding across the floor.&nbsp; A little quicker now, I looked up
and no, it was</b>
<br><b>still in the same position and nobody was in the room with me.&nbsp;
I lay back</b>
<br><b>again and low and behold, there it was again, the distinct sound
of a box</b>
<br><b>scooting across the tile floor.&nbsp; Now I was awake, I sat up
and smoked a</b>
<br><b>cigarette then went into the living room to just chill a little.&nbsp;
After</b>
<br><b>about an hour I decided to give sleep another try.&nbsp; So I get
back into bed</b>
<br><b>and just when I was about to fall asleep, I swear that I am telling
the</b>
<br><b>truth, “somebody” or “something” gave me a raspberry in my ear,
you know,</b>
<br><b>PPPPSSSSBBBBTTTT!!!&nbsp; I actually felt the warm air against my
ear.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>sounded wet and it scared the you know what out of me.&nbsp; I jumped
up and</b>
<br><b>yelled out to nothing:&nbsp; “STOP THAT, THAT’S NOT FUNNY!”&nbsp;
I knew I wasn’t</b>
<br><b>going to get much more sleep that night and went back to the living
room to</b>
<br><b>sit up and wait for somebody, anybody to get up so I wouldn’t be
alone.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>dogs, it had turned out, had gone into the bedroom with Andrea and
Dave so I</b>
<br><b>was on my own, no living thing to comfort me.&nbsp; When Andrea
finally woke up</b>
<br><b>around seven in the morning I was never so happy to see her in the
twenty</b>
<br><b>plus years I had known her.&nbsp; She said she had not heard me
yell out, which I</b>
<br><b>found hard to believe, but I proceeded to tell her about my night.</b>
<br><b>Then she told me their story.&nbsp; It turns out that the very first
night they</b>
<br><b>were in the house they had some experiences of their own.&nbsp;
In the course of</b>
<br><b>their unpacking boxes they were putting the empty boxes in a small
den</b>
<br><b>addition that looked like it used to be a one-car garage.&nbsp;
They just stacked</b>
<br><b>them up in there and intended to dispose of them later.&nbsp; Well,
they went to</b>
<br><b>bed that night and were woken up by the sound of dozens of boxes
falling</b>
<br><b>over in the den.&nbsp; They thought perhaps one of the dogs had
gotten in there.</b>
<br><b>When they investigated, the boxes were as they had left them, all
stacked</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; So they went back to bed perplexed.&nbsp; As soon as they
lay down, they</b>
<br><b>heard pounding on the outside of the house.&nbsp; It sounded like
it was going</b>
<br><b>around the house banging not on the sides of the house as they were
concrete</b>
<br><b>block, but it sounded like someone banging on the eave of the house.&nbsp;
Dave</b>
<br><b>grabbed his bat and went to investigate.&nbsp; As soon as he opened
the front</b>
<br><b>door, the banging stopped.&nbsp; He went around the house and saw
no one.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>soon as he lay back in bed it started again, bang, bang, bang going
around</b>
<br><b>the outside of the house.&nbsp; This time he stayed put.&nbsp; At
the same time Andrea</b>
<br><b>was looking at her cell phone that was on her dresser.&nbsp; It
was not turned on</b>
<br><b>and it was not in the charger but the face of it was glowing, bright
and</b>
<br><b>then dimming to black.&nbsp; She watched this for several minutes
before taking</b>
<br><b>it and putting it in a drawer so she wouldn’t have to witness this</b>
<br><b>particular phenomena.&nbsp; Needless to say it was a long night
for them.</b>
<br><b>Andrea spoke to the landlord and asked him if anyone had died in
the house.</b>
<br><b>He said no, of course not.&nbsp; But according to her new neighbor,
a woman,</b>
<br><b>named Josephine, had had a heart attack and died in the hall where
she was</b>
<br><b>found days later.&nbsp; Dave decided to cleanse the house and tell
the spirit</b>
<br><b>that they could both share the dwelling as long as she “behaved”.&nbsp;
After</b>
<br><b>that the banging didn’t happen anymore, but there have been more
incidents.</b>
<br><b>For instance, I was visiting for the 4th of July and we were sitting
in the</b>
<br><b>living room talking about Josephine.&nbsp; I have made a habit of
saying out loud</b>
<br><b>to Josephine that I am just visiting and for her to please let me
sleep.</b>
<br><b>While were talking, a table lamp proceeded to go on and off several
times.</b>
<br><b>Andrea tried to say that the bulb was loose so I went over to it
and it was</b>
<br><b>screwed in tight.&nbsp; It had one of those knobs that you have
to turn for it to</b>
<br><b>come one.&nbsp; It happened a couple more times before the lamp
stayed lit.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes I will hear what sounds like voices whispering, I can’t
make out</b>
<br><b>the words but it definitely sounds like whispers.&nbsp; Andrea has
a pet peeve,</b>
<br><b>she hates it when someone leaves the shower curtain pulled back.&nbsp;
Every</b>
<br><b>morning when she leaves for work the shower curtain is pull closed
and many</b>
<br><b>times, in the afternoon when she comes back, the shower curtain
is opened.</b>
<br><b>Also Andrea’s beloved black lab, Bubba, had to be put to sleep after
a long</b>
<br><b>illness.&nbsp; She swears that she hears him snoring at the foot
of her bed at</b>
<br><b>times since he died.&nbsp; She also had a cat, Ashley, who passed
while living</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; Dave’s uncle swears that he sees Ashley going from
the bathroom to</b>
<br><b>the bedroom clear as day.&nbsp; Once, while visiting, I was sitting
on the side</b>
<br><b>of the bed when it started shaking, not violently, just vibrating.&nbsp;
I said</b>
<br><b>loudly, “Don’t start that **** with me!” and it stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They still live</b>
<br><b>in this house and there are still strange things that happen at
times but</b>
<br><b>not very often.&nbsp; After my first visit there, it was a YEAR
before I would go</b>
<br><b>back.&nbsp; Now I go every couple of months and it seems that for
the most part</b>
<br><b>Josephine is content for Andrea and Dave to live there.</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Yesturday my boyfriend and I went on one of my usual "bored out of
your mind"&nbsp; ghost hunting days.&nbsp; We visited a fews places I have
been before like the Moonshine church, and then came home and visited your
website for more places.&nbsp; We noticed the listing of the old cemetary
in Middletown and it was very close to our home but neither of us have
been there before.&nbsp; Me being the brave one couldn't wait to walk around
the wall to see if the story was true.&nbsp; So my boyfriend, his cousin,
and I took off in search of our ghosts.&nbsp; When we arrived there it
was about 9:30 pm and very dark.&nbsp; When you approach the cemetary you
just get an uneasy feeling.&nbsp; After some coaxing I talked my boyfriend
to pulling into the little dirt road inside the cemetary.&nbsp; He didn't
get very far inside when a strange yellow/white light appeared deep into
the cemetary.&nbsp; He scares easily and immedately wanted to leave.&nbsp;
I on the other hand already had one foot out the door when something started
running around.&nbsp; We saw a little shadow moving around so fast amoungst
the headstones, and when I announced, "do you see that", it changed into
the same yellow/white light we saw earlier and disappeared.&nbsp; At this
point I'm being yelled at to get in the car, but still had my mind set
on walking the wall.&nbsp; I started to walk away from the car when a a
scream pierced right through me.&nbsp; I froze and my boyfriend was yelling
that he was going to leave me if I didn't get back in the car.&nbsp; It
was a woman's scream that turned into a laugh like I have never heard before.&nbsp;
Even with all my ambition to go inside I felt like I was being pushed towards
the car.&nbsp; The laugh continued as we started to pull away and could
even be heard as we got down the street.</b>
<br><b>Like I have mentioned before I don't scare easily.&nbsp; I have
been to Moonshine and had my engine stall and a cross break in my bare
hands.&nbsp; I have also been to Resurection Cemetary in allentown(not
listed on your site) and have seen apparitions, and what looked like real
people as you or I but the eyes were something black and lifeless like
not of this world.&nbsp; I could go on but out of all those experiances
I have never felt more scared of or more pressured to leave a place before.&nbsp;
I have every intention of going back during the day light and have a look
around, and then possibly after that returning at night time.&nbsp; This
place has such a force feild around it that I felt like I was going to
be push right through the earth.&nbsp; Then the womans scream as I approached
and the way she laughed as we were leaving.&nbsp; There is deffinatly something
going on in there other than to do with the wall(which I never even made
it too), and I thought you would like to know.</b>
<br><b>I enjoy your website and enjoy my ghost hunts as I have for years.&nbsp;
No scare could ever make me stop exploring.&nbsp; I hav intentions to visit
the house in duncannon you have listed next.&nbsp; Thank you for your website
and for taking time to read my e-mail.&nbsp; I hope to see more listings
soon.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Sweet Ghost Blood</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sezzacaruana@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am from Melbourne, Australia. You don’t hear much ghost stories
coming</b>
<br><b>from down here. Well I can tell you properly because they all come
and annoy</b>
<br><b>me. Since I was around 3 or 4 I have had a weird connection with</b>
<br><b>ghosts/spiritual side.&nbsp; Apparently at about 4 years old I told
my mum there</b>
<br><b>was a ghost on the wall? Anyway I’ll cut all my experiences short
into</b>
<br><b>sentences.</b>
<br><b>First when about 7, I was asleep in my room, I woke up to see my
tissue box</b>
<br><b>floating. It was quite dark. It took my eyes a while to adjust to
what it</b>
<br><b>was but I could see something bobbing up and down. At the same time
I was</b>
<br><b>experiencing the hold hag. So I couldn’t move, but I can tell you
I was</b>
<br><b>frightened to death.</b>
<br><b>Another time in my room I was putting on a jumper and had my back
facing the</b>
<br><b>door. As my face was covered by my jumped which was stuck as I was
trying to</b>
<br><b>pull it down, my dad(or what I thought was my dad) stood at my door
and goes</b>
<br><b>“Sarah!” which startled me enough to say “Dad you idiot you scared
me”. When</b>
<br><b>I turned around noone was there. I ran around the house trying to
find my</b>
<br><b>dad so I rang his mobile(cell) and he told me he was in St Kilda
(half an</b>
<br><b>hour away from the house)</b>
<br><b>My mum was at work and my brother was with my dad.</b>
<br><b>Then few years later I was getting out from the bathroom after having
a</b>
<br><b>shower. I remembered that I had left my mobile in the bathroom (
I was in</b>
<br><b>the lounge at the time) I said this to my self out loud, when what
I thought</b>
<br><b>was my brother in the halway go I’ll get it! Im like ah thanks.
I waited a</b>
<br><b>few mintues and when he didn’t come back I went up to go see what
he was</b>
<br><b>doing( I expected him to be looking through my sms msgs) there was
noone in</b>
<br><b>the bathroom. After looking around I walked down to his friends
place(few</b>
<br><b>doors down) were my brother was playing with his friend. I said
what the</b>
<br><b>hell was that about? You can’t get out of our house without going
through</b>
<br><b>the lounge where I was sitting. He swore he had been at his friends
for a</b>
<br><b>god half hour. I even asked their mother to be sure(my bro was only
8 at the</b>
<br><b>time, I believed him)</b>
<br><b>My unlces house is haunted across the road( the whole street knows
that) his</b>
<br><b>fianc&eacute; and roommate saw a grey man walk through the front
door into the</b>
<br><b>first room. They rang into that room. None there. It was a big thing
when it</b>
<br><b>happened. Whole suburb knew about it. Story of the month. On my
holiday, at</b>
<br><b>my grandparents holiday house huge 8 bedroom house. Upstairs we
heard(while</b>
<br><b>we were sleeping down stairs) someone walk in from the balcony into
the</b>
<br><b>house and then this bang. We were so convinced someone was up there
we</b>
<br><b>grapped baseball bat and a shoe(don’t ask) ran upstairs. The balcony
was</b>
<br><b>locked. There is no possible way of getting up stairs unless you
walk up</b>
<br><b>from downstairs. My friend still won’t mention it. Poor thing. Then
we have</b>
<br><b>a photo of our other cabin in the snow, my brother took of my mum,
where you</b>
<br><b>can see a dark figure in the room behind her, which I no is haunted
by</b>
<br><b>something. My brother rekons he saw a old man in the corner of the
his</b>
<br><b>bedroom at the cabin. My brother is a loser. He wouldn’t be smart
enough to</b>
<br><b>make something up they way he described him and I have never seen
someone so</b>
<br><b>convinced. What happened to me in the cabin was properly the most
recent to</b>
<br><b>happen to me. I was having a fiesta (it the summer it gets really
hot there)</b>
<br><b>I was staying there with my boyfriend and a few friends. I was laying
on the</b>
<br><b>side, back to the door. I had been asleep for a while when someone
started</b>
<br><b>to scratch and tickle my back. I thought it was my boyfriend, so
I said</b>
<br><b>scratch near the shoulder its itchy there. And I went to grab my
boyfriends</b>
<br><b>hand to show him where to scratch and there was nothing. I turned
around</b>
<br><b>startled and there was noone there. I thought my boyfriend had rolled
back</b>
<br><b>and was hiding on the side of the bed, but I could see everything
in the</b>
<br><b>mirror robes and there was noone. I screamed everyone ran in and
I told them</b>
<br><b>what happened and my boyfriend goes omg that happened to me the
other day I</b>
<br><b>thought you were breathing down my neck and I turned around and
noone was</b>
<br><b>there. Then later that night we were resting again, when the others
went to</b>
<br><b>the gaming room down the track(about 5 mins away). After about 10
mintues,</b>
<br><b>we heard then come&nbsp; back (the main bedroom is located so the
window that we</b>
<br><b>sleep facing is where the verander ends, so basicacally, who sits
out on the</b>
<br><b>table ouside we can see and hear them directly) and as it’s a small
cabin,</b>
<br><b>you can hear the footsteps of who walks in, it can get really loud.
Like</b>
<br><b>this time for instance. Then we heard them all sit down, the chairs
make so</b>
<br><b>much noise. We could hear all this moving and laughing. We decided
to go out</b>
<br><b>and join then. (it takes us about 5 seconds to walk outside to them
from</b>
<br><b>were we were) we walk out to see noone is there at all! Not a chair
has been</b>
<br><b>moved. We rang one on their mobile to see if they had left or something.</b>
<br><b>Nope still at the games room. We freaked. Well my boyfriend did
he doesn’t</b>
<br><b>believe in this stuff at all. Well no he had no choice. I could
write a book</b>
<br><b>on everything that has happened. I think my fridge is haunted. Every
house I</b>
<br><b>go to something always follows. You can just tell it is there. I
have been</b>
<br><b>told ghosts like fear. So when I am having and old hag moment or
I now there</b>
<br><b>is something there I have been told not to show them I am scared.
It can be</b>
<br><b>a nbit hard but I like the excitement. I am not sure what got me
this in my</b>
<br><b>head but for some reason Ihave been told they can haunt you and
stay with</b>
<br><b>you if you let them Evil ones. I would like to find out who they
are but I</b>
<br><b>don’t want to be involved with the wrong ones. My mum is a very
spiritual</b>
<br><b>person. I carry crystals around with me and I have saged sticked
my house</b>
<br><b>away. But yeah.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Horror on Elm Street</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: scjr03@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>So to give some background information, i go to University of North
Texas and i just recently moved into a house off of Elm Street. (yeah go
figure it's haunted) The house is VERY old and is all wood,walls floors
and ceilings. Anyway, when me and my roomates moved in we didn't really
notice anything. We were creeped out by the house a little but that was
just because it was old and it was a new place. It didn't take long for
things to start happening throughout the house. One morning my roomate,
lets call her Ashley, came to me and said she had had horrible nightmares.
She then went on to tell me how she had woken up and saw a mans face very
close to hers watching her. she closed her eyes and opened them and he
was gone. She refused to get up and eventually went back to sleep. later
in the night she woke to find him standing by her fireplace watching her.
this scared her even more because the first time she thought it was just
a dream. she forced herself to go back to sleep and hasn't seen him since.
She later described him as a young man with no hair dressed in modern clothes.
after her sighting we started having things being moved. bottles were thrown
from our fridge and cds were pushed off of the tops of cd players. we couldn't
figure out what was going on so we had our friends mom come. (she can 'sense'
things) she told us that in the room attached to our kitchen there was
a little boy residing. she told us he liked to play and didn't mean any
harm. of course we were all skeptics until we went in the room and found
child handprints high on the windows. too high for any child that size
to reach.She then told us that the man Ashley saw liked her room and loved
watching us and looking at our pictures.A couple weeks later i was in bed
and had woken up because i felt someone was watching me. i rolled over
and it felt as if omeone had place their hand over my ear and whispered
'hey'.of course i freaked because it was pitch black in my room.i woke
my boyfriend up and made him check the room and he eventually got me calmed
down. that next day he had just walked out the door and i was walking up
the stairs when i heard a little boys voice say 'hey Lauren'. i responded
thinking it was my roomate home early from work and when no one answered
back i ran out after my boyfriend and left with him. i told my roomates
about it that following week and the girl whos bedroom is upstairs with
mine said she has reoccuring dreams of a man standing over her and choking
her. She hasn't had them before. Ashley has also heard them talk to her.
she was in the upstairs hallway and heard a man say 'hi' to her, when she
turned around no one was there. Besides those direct episodes we have only
heard random banging and we often hear someone walking up the stairs. doors
will sometimes be open when they shouldn't and every once in awhile things
will get misplaced. We are used to them now, they are like a part of our
everyday life.they haven't harmed us and we like them around, they kinda
make us feel like we are being protected. we are now currently trying to
find out the history of our house and we aren't having any luck at all.
thanks for reading this and sorry it was so long. :)</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Family Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nycedarworks@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi! first of all I want to say that I love your website, &amp; second
of all I'm</b>
<br><b>not sure how to do this, so I'm just going to send you this e-mail.</b>
<br><b>I have never seen a ghost. But I love a good ghost story, so that's
why I</b>
<br><b>love this website so much. These are my stories-</b>
<br><b>This one happened to my aunt.&nbsp; She was working late, and the
janiter had</b>
<br><b>given her the keys to lock up when she was done, since he was going
home for</b>
<br><b>the night. So my anut was in her offilce working, when her phone
(with 3 or</b>
<br><b>4 lines) started to flash, (now remember, no one else was in the
building.)</b>
<br><b>so she was like "whats going on?" So she picked up the phone to
see who was</b>
<br><b>talking. Nothing. So she was freaked out and locked up every thing
as fast</b>
<br><b>as she could &amp; got out of there!&nbsp; She found out later the
old building had</b>
<br><b>been used as a jail in colonial times and people had been killed
there.</b>
<br><b>This story happened to my grandmother. She was playing cards with
her</b>
<br><b>firends at this pretty old building &amp; she had to go to the bathroom,
so she</b>
<br><b>got one of her friends to come down with her to the basement, (were
the</b>
<br><b>bathroom is) &amp; she found the light on. "Thats weird." she thought,
but did</b>
<br><b>not think much about it. Well she went to the bathroom &amp; all
of the sudden</b>
<br><b>the lights went out! so she turned the light on and dryed her hands.&nbsp;
Then</b>
<br><b>her firend had to go so she went in. When she came out she asked
my grandma</b>
<br><b>if she had left the light on. (I don't know why she did) But of
course my</b>
<br><b>grandma said "No. Why?" And her friend said "Because they were on!"
(now</b>
<br><b>this is an old building, you have to turn a swich) My grandma looked
at her.</b>
<br><b>They started up stairs &amp; my granmas firend asked her if the
lights had gone</b>
<br><b>on &amp; off with her. They looked at each other, then ran up the
stairs as fast</b>
<br><b>as they could!</b>
<br><b>My next story is weird, it happened to my firend; She was in her
room at</b>
<br><b>night,doing her home work, when she glanced at her lamp next to
her. She saw</b>
<br><b>her big sister (when she was little) in the lamp! It's weird!</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Man in My Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: electriceyesly@cox.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>How do I start? My name is Sly, and&nbsp; here's my story.</b>
<br><b>My brother had just recently purchace a home with a granny flat
and asked me if I wanted to it rent from him. I gladly accepted the offer,
and soon me and my three year old daughter moved in.&nbsp; The first six
months or so were very nice. Things were peaceful, but soon little things
began to happen. Doors began opening and slamming by themselves for no
apparent reason. Then as time went by, lights would start flickering and
going off at times. I had an electrician friend of mine come out and fix
it, bringing the ampage up to code. It started all over again and never
got better. Then as time went by, pictures that I hung in the home and
were properly secured, began falling off the walls by themselves.</b>
<br><b>I had experienced things like this my whole life, so when things
got worse, I knew something was up. One afternoon, I was home sick, my
daughter was in school and I lay down for a nap. I was not asleep yet,
when I heard someone call my name. I knew the house was locked and I was
alone. The voice came from inside the house, it was male and he was whispering,
but very loud. I thought it was coming from my music room but it was as
loud as someone sitting next to me. I sat up and answered, but got no reply.</b>
<br><b>I lay back down and blamed it on my flu. As I was starting to drift
off, I heard the back door open and slam with such force, my house shook.
I sat up in bed. I heard distinct footfall on the hallway carpet. It sounded
like wooden floors though. It was heading for my room and I sensed a presence,
but could not see anyone. I sat up and began to pray out loud, it soon
went away and I lay back down. Later that hour as I slept, I was awaken
by someone pulling on me, I woke up and felt someone actually yanking me
off the bed. I screamed for it to stop and it did.</b>
<br><b>Later that weekend, it happened again, only this time, it managed
to pull me off the bed, I fell off and slammed into the wall. Luckily,
I didn't get hurt, but I was pretty tired of this thing bothering me.</b>
<br><b>Things had been building up for a while by now, and finally one
very cold winter night in 1995, my daughter was with her father and I was
alone. An old boyfriend of mine dropped by very drunk, and we got into
a terrible argument, so bad that he refused to leave the property. My brother
came over and told him to go to sleep in his travel trailer until the booze
wore off. When he left, I felt a little guilty because I knew the trailter
was freezing cold, so stupid me went out to the trailer and told my old
boyfriend he could sleep in the livingroom so long as he left me alone,
then he could leave in the morning. Well he was sound asleep as soon as
his head hit the pillow.</b>
<br><b>I went to my room and closed the door. I was very angry and couldn't
sleep. It must have been fifteen minutes later that my doorknob began turning.
I sat up as the door swung open. I saw what I believed was my old boyfriend
standing in the doorway. The night light shone around his body. He was
a big man with long hair, but I couldn' t see his face because it was dark.
Anyway, I proceeded to yell at him and told him to leave me alone. He simply
ignored me and started to move around the other side of my bed. Then without
warning, just fell on the floor and out of my sight. I was so mad that
I switched on the light and got out of bed. I walked over to shake him
and get him out of my room and was quite stunned to find the floor empty.
I looked under the bed, then ran out to the livingroom to see if my old
boyfriend was there. He was very much passed out still.</b>
<br><b>That's when I had my first visual encounter with this ghost. I told
my family about it later and they sort of rolled their eyes politely. My
old boyfriend was freaked out and decided to leave me alone after that.&nbsp;
Well, atleast this ghost did me a favor. As time went by, things continued
to happen. Like when I was working on my computer, my hair would be stroked
from behind, or my shoulder touched as if a hand were laid on it. When
this would happen, I simply asked him to stop it, that I was busy, and
he would. I can only assume it was the same guy.</b>
<br><b>Well about a year before I moved, my next door neighbor was talking
to my brother and told him a story about the property and mainly, my little
flat. Come to find out, the last person who lived there had built the granny
flat and put up a huge wall around it because he was so paranoid. He turned
the flat into a Meth lab and was selling to scores of people. There was
one particular biker who had come up on several occasions to buy. Then
one day, an argument was heard from both neighbor's closest to my home.
Several shots were fired and then it was very quiet after that. The neighbors
came by to see if he was ok, he was, but chased everyone off the property.
Then a few nights later, he rented a backhoe and was digging up the whole
property late into the night. The police were summoned later that week
after the neighbors got tired of the noise, but soon left with only warnings.
The guy was soon busted and his lab shut down.</b>
<br><b>The interesting part to the story is that many people remember the
biker going up, but never leaving the property that day. There was no way
to prove a thing so it was soon forgotten. All in all, the neighbor tried
to get my brother to tear up the grounds on the property, because he had
a bad feeling that his body was buried near or under my home. My brother
refused to do this because he didn't believe the story, and he wasn't about
to take on a task like that without solid proof. He claims this person
is probably good fertalizer anyway. I just wish I could find out if he's
buried there, I'm sure his loved ones would like to have some closure.
Or maybe, nobody is buried, only God knows for sure.</b>
<br><b>Anyhow, I was finally glad to be out of there. I heard my sister-in-law
got a bad spooking while doing her laundry about the time I was leaving.
She didn't see anything, but felt someone watching her. Then all the wind
chimes went crazy at once, only there was no wind outside. She screamed
and ran out. Finally someone believed me.</b>
<br><b>When I think back, I believe this person, ghost, whatever he is,
was trying to tell me something. Oh, I also found out that the shooting
took place in my room, where several shotgun holes were found, exactly
where my bed had been positioned. It was repaired before my brother bought
the property. Well, that's it, I hope I didn't bore you too much.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A NIGHT I WILL NEVER FORGET</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kathryn.brown15@btinternet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was 11 years old when this happened, i am a twin and shared a bunkbed
with my twin sister who slept on the top bunk.&nbsp; It was early hours
in the morning when i suddenly awoke to hear the voice of a lady.&nbsp;
I didnt understand what was going on but i knew this was something paranormal.&nbsp;
I&nbsp; squeezed my eyes shut, and covered my ears so tightly to drown
the noise&nbsp; but could just hear her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She said there would
be 3 men in my life and to make sure i made the right decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This seemed to be going on for ever and i was absolutely petrified, i was
kicking my sister's bed so hard to try and wake her up but she didnt .&nbsp;
Then&nbsp; there was a thump on my pillow and she told me to listen.&nbsp;
I still kept my fingers plugged in my ears even though they were really
aching at this point and could hear what sounded like an audience clapping
and then it just seemed to fade.</b>
<br><b>I have had a few strange experiences once i was sat watching television
with my elder sister and she asked me to shut the door to the living room
as there was a draft,&nbsp; i got up to shut it&nbsp; and saw half of a
white hand on one of the glass panels and the door closed on its own.&nbsp;
My sister said thanks as i sat back down, i just stared at the door shocked
and didnt say a word, i thought i was seeing things.&nbsp; I have never
said anything to this day.</b>

we had to put her down. for over 2 years her spirit we believed stay with
us though i have seen her but Taffy left when she gave us her gift of moving

<br><b>PLEASE FEEL FREE TO POST THIS ON YOUR GHOST EXPERIENCE PAGE!</b>
<br><b>Taffy use to lie by our front door. that was her spot, taffy's spot.
Taffy would lie on a vent and her big collar would get stuck in the vent

up with the vent caught on her collar. this was at 1 a.m. when all was
dark. it vanished less than 5 seconds.</b>
<br><b>* At times i could smell her doggy shampoo and the smell would become
overly strong then fade.</b>
<br><b>Like, i said her spirit left our family and gave us her gift. heres
the story... my mom always said she didn't want another dog unless if she
could have another clone of Taffy. my mom had to go to petsmart to get
a fish tank light bulb and my little brother matt went with and they went
over to look at the dogs up for adoption. matt screamed mom its taffy!
and to my mom's surprised there was a clone of Taffy... the same breed,
the same gender (female)... Taffy sent us her gift. we adopted her and
named her Halley. my mom was crying saying that taffy brought halley to
us and that halley is a clone of taffy and its true she is. now that we
have Halley in our lives the spirit of taffy is no longer in our home but
now living in our hearts,mind, and soul.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Central High School</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Light1angel@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>People say that Central High School is not haunted but I know it
is. One day in my freshman year I was sitting in my Alg. 1 class doing
my work when all of a sudden the class room door opend slowly. My teach
thought that it was a drought so she closed the door. A few minutes later
the door opend again real slow all the way and hit the lockers and then
without any warning the door slamed shut. It slamed so hard that the windows
on the door rattled and the windows are at least 2 1/2-3" thick. My teacher
thought that it was student playing a joke on us but then when she looked
out into the hallway no one was there. People tried to say that there was
a drought in the hall but our class room was at the end of the hall. There
was no way there could have been a drought that strong.-- When you are
walking in the hallways alone you get the feeling that someone is behind
you. You can even see someone out of the cornor of your eye if you pay
attention but then when you turn around no one is there. Sometimes during
the winter time when you are walking in the warm hallways you would walk
through a cold spot in a certain part of the hall. Some people say that
that is why the janitors do not stay past dark all by themselves.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Cold Pockets</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: spotlight@iw.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story has to do with two ghosts. Many years ago a lady died
in our house ( my parents told me ), One night&nbsp; I came down the stares
to see an orb the shape of a person and its ora ( I&nbsp; can see oras
),</b>
<br><b>Also when I was sitting in my house I felt a cold pocket which is
not normal because I don't really ever get cold, when I left the room it
was gone, I told my friend and she said she had the same thing happened
to her once in that room. Every now and then I see an orb, and I will know
it's really because my cat will turn her head to see.</b>
<br><b>The other story is about my grandpa who had past away. My grandpa
was a really nice man who was to think he would not watch over us. The
night he died was at the Heart hospital because his aorta exploded, Right
after the funeral, my sister, her friend, and her boyfriend brought me
home. They were outside and I heard footsteps in th house I turned and
looked and saw nothing, Also the other night I had a dream that he was
walking down the sidewalk after his death. My mother and I went up to him.
I looked him in the face and tried to talk to him he looked at me but could
not speak.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Rug</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>Not sure what you would title this, but this was one of the craziest
things we</b>
<br><b>have ever experienced.</b>
<br><b>We moved into a two story house built in the early 1800s on Metcalf
street in</b>
<br><b>New Bern, NC in 1980 when I was 18.&nbsp; We spent an entire day
getting everything</b>
<br><b>moved in, and all of the boxes and furniture sorted into the appropriate</b>
<br><b>living areas.&nbsp; On the first floor of the house, as you walk
in the front door,</b>
<br><b>there are stairs about 10 feet from the door on the right, and the
hallway</b>
<br><b>continued parallel to the stairs which led into the dining room.&nbsp;
On the left</b>
<br><b>of the hallway on the first floor was a small parlor which we used
as a music</b>
<br><b>room.</b>
<br><b>The dining room was one of the first rooms we set up because it
was an artery</b>
<br><b>of the house, basically the central part of the house which had
to be entered</b>
<br><b>to change rooms.&nbsp; The kitchen and den was on one side, the
rest of the house</b>
<br><b>was on the other.</b>
<br><b>We got the dining room set up on the first day.&nbsp; We put the
oriental rug down,</b>
<br><b>put the dining room table on top, and placed the chairs in position.&nbsp;
We had a</b>
<br><b>leisurely evening that night, and went to bed.</b>
<br><b>The next morning I awoke to my parents freaking out downstairs.&nbsp;
They were</b>
<br><b>yelling and running around checking locks on windows and doors.&nbsp;
I went</b>
<br><b>downstairs, and the dining room was exactly as we left it, except
the oriental</b>
<br><b>rug was rolled up neatly beside the table.&nbsp; The dining room
table and chairs</b>
<br><b>were exactly as we had set them up the night before.&nbsp; Talk
about freaked</b>
<br><b>out!!!&nbsp; My parents thought it was me just messing with them,
but I assured</b>
<br><b>them it was not me.&nbsp; After talking about the possibilities
of what or who</b>
<br><b>could have rolled up the rug, we moved the dining room table, rolled
out the</b>
<br><b>rug again, and put the dining room table back on top.</b>
<br><b>That night, we went to bed again after checking all of the windows,
making</b>
<br><b>sure they were all locked, and double locking all of the doors.&nbsp;
The next</b>
<br><b>morning, I got up as my parents walked down the upstairs hallway
past my</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; We all walked down together and saw the exact same
thing we saw the</b>
<br><b>previous morning.&nbsp; The carpet was rolled up but the dining
room table and</b>
<br><b>chairs were in the exact same spots as we had left them.&nbsp; My
parents were</b>
<br><b>furious, and really went off on me asking me why I was doing this
to them.</b>
<br><b>They told the neighbors what we had experienced, and asked them
if the people</b>
<br><b>who lived here before us had ever said anything out of the ordinary
occurring</b>
<br><b>in the house, but they were unaware of anything like this happening
to the</b>
<br><b>previous owners.</b>
<br><b>That night, my dad nailed the rug to the hardwood floor with 8 nails,
and</b>
<br><b>placed the dining room furniture back on top of the rug.&nbsp; He
was thinking that</b>
<br><b>if it was me, he would hear me pulling the nails out of the floor
with the</b>
<br><b>hammer.</b>
<br><b>We all went to bed at the exact same time that night in my parents
room, with</b>
<br><b>the door shut and locked.&nbsp; None of us really slept that night,
but we woke up</b>
<br><b>together.&nbsp; We walked downstairs, and were dumbfounded.&nbsp;
The rug was rolled up</b>
<br><b>beside the diningroom table and chairs, which were in the exact
same locations</b>
<br><b>that we had placed them.&nbsp; The nails were still in the floor,
and the rug had</b>
<br><b>not been ripped in the places where it had been nailed.&nbsp; It
was like someone</b>
<br><b>had pulled the nails out, and hammered them back in the floor.</b>
<br><b>We gave up that morning, and did not try to put the rug back in
it's</b>
<br><b>position.&nbsp; We arranged the dining room furniture the way we
wanted it, and</b>
<br><b>decided to put the rug in a different room.</b>
<br><b>Since then, we have heard a few wierd noises, had several items
go missing,</b>
<br><b>only to show up in random places days or weeks later, but nothing
that has</b>
<br><b>been a true nuisance.</b>
<br><b>My parents have never tried to put another rug in the dining room.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Something in the House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ryslas2@mail.sdsu.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was one evening in the early part of Fall in 1998 that my girlfriend</b>
<br><b>(now my wife), her son, and I were seated at the dinner table.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>during the meal that I noticed a light dancing on the ceiling of
the dining</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; I studied it for a while and tried to figure out where
the light</b>
<br><b>source was coming from.&nbsp; I checked for reflections off the</b>
<br><b>utensils...nothing; looked out the kitchen window...nothing; looked
out the</b>
<br><b>family room windows...nothing.&nbsp; It was then that I realized
that we had</b>
<br><b>a"visitor."&nbsp; It seemed quite friendly as it would dance along
the ceiling</b>
<br><b>of the dinning room for about 15 minutes...and I didn't get any
sense of</b>
<br><b>ill will. Just as suddenly as it appeared, it was gone.&nbsp; I
decided not to</b>
<br><b>spook the rest of the family while they were enjoying dinner; but
I did</b>
<br><b>tell them about it after we moved from the house.</b>
<br><b>On a somewhat related story...I know there was something in the
house</b>
<br><b>because every time I entered the garage, I would get this feeling
of dread</b>
<br><b>and chills.&nbsp; I can almost describe the feeling as being very
negative (I</b>
<br><b>still get chills thinking about it to this day!).&nbsp; The rest
of the house</b>
<br><b>was fine, except the garage.&nbsp; My wife tells me that when she
first moved</b>
<br><b>in, parts of the house had dark black drapes and red walls and she
felt a</b>
<br><b>weird vibe...who knows what was going on!&nbsp; I recently was talking
to my</b>
<br><b>wife's brother-in-law and he mentioned that he would get a similar
feeling</b>
<br><b>whenever he entered the garage.&nbsp; Interesting!</b>

<p><b>Duplex</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JENSEN968@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have had a lot of experiences in my life, but I will list just
one.&nbsp; I will be cutting out a lot of things that happened, but the
story covers a very exciting two years and I don't want to take up too
much of your time.</b>
<br><b>In 2000, my husband and I moved into an old house that had been
made into a duplex.&nbsp; Our friends (Emily and Sam) lived upstairs and
we lived in the basement.&nbsp; Soon after moving in Emily's 2 yr. old,
Cierra, started talking to an imaginary friend she called Demby.&nbsp;
We thought nothing of it until she started describing things about Demby
that she was too young to understand or make up.&nbsp; She told us what
street she used to live on and that Demby was upset because she couldn't
be with Jesus.&nbsp; Now none of us are religious so I don't even know
if Cierra had the slightest clue who Jesus is.</b>
<br><b>We still did not let this upset us until strange things began to
happen.&nbsp; Pans would fly across the kitchen, doors would open of their
own accord, our friends would hear footsteps walking around their bed and
thumping on the wall.&nbsp; We called in a ghost hunter because we were
curious.&nbsp; He caught hundreds of orbs on his video camera.&nbsp; We
decided to go down into my bedroom where Emily's little boy was sleeping.&nbsp;
As the ghost hunter put his hand to the door, it flew out of his hand.&nbsp;
He caught that on tape so we looked it over to make sure he wasn't pulling
our leg.&nbsp; When he video taped over the bed there were several orbs
circling over Gavin.</b>
<br><b>My husband and I got a cat right after we moved in and we thought
there was something wrong with him because he was always chasing nothing.&nbsp;
When the ghost hunter was filming, our cat started moving his head around
in a circle, watching something we couldn't see until we played the tape
back.&nbsp; It was an orb!</b>
<br><b>The craziest thing that happened was when Emily and Sam were throwing
a party one of their friends went in to use the restroom and when he came
out he was pale and spooked.&nbsp; He said he saw a girl in her early teens
standing in the kitchen.&nbsp; She was wearing a white sweater with a white
skirt.&nbsp; She had brown eyes and brown hair.&nbsp; Nobody really thought
too much about it because he had been drinking.</b>
<br><b>A few hours later, my husband came home from work and went up to
the party.&nbsp; He used their bathroom and when he came out he asked who
the girl in white was.&nbsp; Everyone was spooked then, especially because
Cierra always described Demby as a girl with brown hair and eyes, wearing
a white dress.</b>
<br><b>We decided to do a little researching and experimenting of our own
and we discovered that the house had been moved from 2nd St. to that property
after a nursing home burnt down to the ground.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we
never found out what date it was so we couldn't investigate it further.</b>

<br><b>More Ghost Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Evildragonx4@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've had some more experiences that aren't really about ghosts or
might be.</b>
<br><b>The other night I was working on my computer, trying to get caught
up on things. My computer and its desk are on the left side of the kitchen
door, and to the right of the door and down the hall is the bathroom. I'd
got up to go to the bathroom and when I passed the kitchen, I thought I
saw a little child look at me. I thought "What the...?" and turned back
to it. Whatever I must of saw was gone. Another experience I've had it
seeing a person sitting behind me when I'm on the computer.</b>
<br><b>My other experinces are hearing and seeing things that are scary.</b>
<br><b>I was on the computer around 5 pm. It was getting ready to storn
like hell so I'd thought I'd wrap up. I heard someone call my name and
as I turned to look I saw a&nbsp; man in 50's cloths vanish. I got shocked
and acted like I never saw it.</b>
<br><b>All my other happenings are voices and bad feelings. Unseen people
would carry on a convo and I would get the felling someone was watching
me when I was trying to sleep. I get bad vibes from this so I would sleep
on the couch. Other things include hearing my name being called and the
screaming of a cat.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Encounters</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ghola@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I found this website the other day and it really piqued my interest.
I think this may be the only outlet (aside from my wife) that I have for
this story. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe in ghosts, but my mother
did and she seemed to think I had some sort of ability. She said I do very
good job of blocking it out though (which is a good thing for me if it's
true.) Be that as it may, here are the only two paranormal "encounters"
I believe I have ever had.</b>
<br><b>The first encounter is a little vague as I was extremely young,
maybe 4 or 5. I had a wooden toy box that sat against a wall and I remember
sometimes seeing pictures, like a movie, as if they were projected from
somewhere onto this toy box. I don't really remember what the pictures
were, perhaps because I was so young? I can only remember this happening
a few times.</b>
<br><b>The second encounter I remember in detail. (unfortunately.) I was
12 or 13 and had switched bedrooms with my younger brother. I went to sleep
one night and just woke up for no apparent reason. I remember feeling as
if someone's hands were on top of my feet and ankles. I looked toward the
foot of my bed and saw what I can only describe as something with a small
child's body, but with a head the size of a basketball. It was crawling
toward me. The thing was hairless, pale white, and had veins all over it's
head and sharp looking teeth in it's mouth. For a moment, I was so terrified
I couldn't move. When that passed, I did the only I could think to do.
I told myself that this was a dream and I laid down and closed my eyes
very tightly. When I got the courage to look again it was gone. That was
almost twenty years ago. I tell myself that it was only a dream and nothing
has happened since.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Different Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ginther3@tmcranes.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had a few different experiences with ghosts.</b>
<br><b>The first one was when I was little. I used to go to a friends house
in Ada, MI and visit.&nbsp; Well I guess there was a little girl that lived
there many years before my moms friend did and this little girl died in
the closet in the attic.&nbsp; The ppl that lived in this house would see
this little girl but only in that room in the attic.&nbsp; She would never
come out of that room.&nbsp; The guest room was the other room in the attic
where me and my mother slept when we came to visit.&nbsp; I was always
scared to sleep up there for some reason.&nbsp; Well I finally learned
why.&nbsp; One day my friend that lived there was up in that room in the
attic and I could hear her talking.&nbsp; I went up there and she was sitting
there talking to a white apparition that looked like a little girl with
blonde hair.&nbsp; She was talking and playing with her.&nbsp; When I came
in the room the little girl got very very mad and disappeared.&nbsp; She
didnt like it when I came to visit because my friend would play with me
and not her.&nbsp; Whenever my friends' parents would leave and go on vacation
or go out to dinner...when they got home all the lights would be on, or
the garbage knocked over, or there would be bats flying in the livingroom.&nbsp;
It was very creepy, but the little girl didnt want them to leave or leave
her home by herself.&nbsp; The ppl that moved into that house after them
had the same problems.&nbsp; I dont know if anyone ever reported it or
if anything was ever done about it but it was something that I will never
forget.</b>
<br><b>The next experience was by my daughter.</b>
<br><b>She told me that she seen a blonde haired boy walking up and down
the staircase in a house that we rented for 4 years.&nbsp; She never told
me until we moved out. She said he never did anything to her or even looked
at her but she seen him.&nbsp; She said that he had blue pants, blue dress
jacket, white shirt, and shoes with buckles on them carrying books up and
down the stairs.&nbsp; That is all she told me.&nbsp; We used to hear the
stairs creaking but never got up to look and see.</b>
<br><b>The last experience is the house I am in now seems to have lots
of noises.&nbsp; I will hear thumping and thunking on my ceiling in the
livingroom but when I go upstairs my kids arent anywhere in the area and
are sound asleep.&nbsp; I have found my attic door standing wide open.&nbsp;
I have put my cigarettes down on the coffee table and then they disappeared
and when I start to look for them and come back they are there.&nbsp; This
has happened with my shoes, purse, keys, and cigarettes.&nbsp; I hear noise
all the time and it is very definate sound and not something that can be
explained by anything else happening.&nbsp; I know that the guy that owned
the house before me had a daughter that died and her shoe prints are in
the cement in the basement.&nbsp; All i can think of is it is her and she
just died before her time.&nbsp; We call her sally....we have not seen
her yet....but we hear her all the time.</b>

<br><b>Very Strange</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cheekymonkey_136@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi this story may seem very strange as i still seem to remember it
like it happend yesterday. I am now 13 and i have had quite a few expiriences
with spirits. My ever first expirience, so i have been told was when i
was about two years old. My dad would be woken up between 2-3 in the morning
by me screming. When he got to my bedroom he would ask what the matter
was and i would point to the window and then to myself. Thease happenings
stopped after a couple of months and wasen't bothered again until i was
about 3.</b>
<br><b>Before i was born my dad went to a fortune teller for a bit of fun
whilst he was out with his mates and she told him what i would do one night.
And that is exactly what i did. I went downstairs whilst my dad was watching
telly and i through my favoroute teddy in the bin and i shouted "i don't
like that teddy anymore dad!" Then i walked over to the conservetry in
the back and the glass door suddenly opend by itself. It was then i screamed
and fell to the floor. I can remember my dad running over to me and as
i looked back into the conservetry i saw somebody or somthin smiling at
me then it just dissapeared.</b>
<br><b>The last expirience is quite spooky. My gran moved into a new house
that a man had died in a couple of months before. He had a dog that died
shortly after him. I read my grandmas take a break magazines somtimes that
she keeps in her bedroom. I was on my way out of a bed room and out the
corner of my eye i saw i little dog run round the corner and dissapear
as it went into the front room. I'm sure people have expirienced simelar
things and i have enjoyed reading your stories so please keep sending them
in lv me!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Cemetery</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NightPanther7867@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I wanted to tell my true story. It all started when a me and a friend
were talking about a Haunted Cematry. We were told that a young girl was
buried&nbsp; in a glass coffin. Well we decided to go and take a look.
The cematry is a road called Crooked Mile Rd. We got there at Midnight,
and we waited at least 6 minutes before we got out. We got out and stood
in front of Cematry for about 2 minutes then we walked in about 15 steps,
Then I aked her if she felt someone watching us. She repiled yes, then
we heard footsteps walk up beside her. Then she told me to look at the
tree on the right about 50 yards from us. So I looked and there we both
saw a shadow of a man standing next the tree. Well she got scared and said
she wanted to leave. I replied to her are you cold? She said no, then I
said I'm frozen. As I looked she was running out of the cematry. She Then
turnned around and said come on lets go, I told her that could not move.
Something was holding me back, and I was to frozen to move. It felt like
something had jumped into my body. I finally was able to get out. As soon
as I did I was not frozen anymore and the migrain that I had was gone.(It
was very bizzar). We stood there for about 10 minutes andthen went to the
car. We sat there for another 15 minutes just watching and listening. She
told me to turn the car around so that the cematry was on my side not her's.
So I did that. We sat there for another 15 minutes, and we heard people
walking around and a man moaning. Then it got quite, all of the suddenwe
heard a baby crying. That really got to us but we stayed fro another 5
minutes.The a hissing sound came up out of the ground and I thought it
was a sprinkler system. The listening closely it was not a sprinkler system,
because there was never one there. So we moved away then went back to the
entrance and waited again for somrthing else to happen. Well something
else happened. We also was told about a woman in a white gown floating
around. Well towards the back of the cematry she was floating around a
grave. The this woman was waving us in. We said no way. Where out of here.
When we left my friend noticed something and she asked me what time was
the clock saying and I said 12:30am why. She said we lost at least an hours
time it should be 1:00am. The as I thinking about she was right, we had
lost 1hrs time. Where did it go?</b>
<br><b>Before my friend moved away we went back there. It wasn't all the
same, the trees wern't moving, and I was frozen again but not as bad. Then
we left and haven't been back.</b>
<br><b>I would go back if I could find someone to with me. One other thing,
every grave is back in that late 1800's</b>

<br><b>Too Many WHat Ifs</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: soberhammerhead@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello! My name is Maranda. I have had a couple of stories that have
happened to me as well as these other people. I used to live in Martinsburg,
W.V. and I remember hearing all kinds of weird things as I grew up in this
house. One day, my mother asked to get me some tea for her. So I went downstairs
to get it for her. I am a reasonable person, but what happened... I just
don't get it and I know I'm not supposed to GET it, but... Well, there
was a cup she liked using because it was big, but it was hollow on the
inside so it had a detachable bottom. I filled it up with water and micro
waved it I took it over to the counter next to the refrigerator and put
some sugar in it just for the simple fact that when you do, it sizzles.
I stirred it, stopped the spoon, and went in the fridge to get some milk
Then I heard the spoon stirring. I remember shutting the door and looking
at the cup and seeing the spoon spinning faster than I had stirred it before.
I shrugged that off. I have heard many weird things in this house, mind
you. So I poured the milk and went on the other side of the kitchen to
get the tea bag. Then I heard a dragging noise. I turned and saw the cup
moving across the counter! I quickly ran over to it and picked it up, thinking
it was something under it. Nothing but the detachable bottom. So then I
thought it was water in the inside of the cup... maybe the pressure of
the heat and water on the inside was...pushing it? But when I took the
bottom off, it was bone dry. So I put it back on the counter. To my surprise,
it continued to move. It was like it was being dragged and the thing that
was pulling it was too weak. Real jerky movements. I watched as the cup
move on the counter. The counter itself is shaped in a "L". It moved up
one side and turned down the other. It completely changed direction. At
that point, I ran to my mother and told her to never have me make her tea
again and asked her if the house was blessed. She said yes. I had a ghost
board thing (like the exorcist) when I was little. I remember playing with
it all the time too. My friends and I always ended up talking to a little
boy. He said he had died from falling down the stairs in my house. There
is a lot more to these stories but I am cutting them short. Anyway, I burned
the board after that encounter and never had another problem again. My
mother and I were talking about ghost stories with some family friends
I started to tell this one. When I got to the part where my mother told
me the house was blessed, her face looked different. I looked at her and
ask "what?" and her reply was that the house was never blessed and a little
boy really did die in the house. Every time I think about this, it puts
shivers down my body. So many things this boy told us and we thought it
was a joke. Why move a cup? He was definitely speaking to me through the
board. This is one of the stories you can't make anything out of it. He
acted like he wanted a friend. ALWAYS hiding things and moving things.
Only I noticed. I think it was because&nbsp; I was kind of young as well.
There were too many "what if's". Thank you for reading this. Love, Me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>SKOOKUM CANYON</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Shylock1041@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>THIS CONCERNS A CANYON THAT EXISTS IN KLICKITAT COUNTY IN THE STATE
OF WASHINGTON. BEFORE I BEGIN THE STORY, LET ME SAY THAT THE WORD"SKOOKUM"
IS CHINOOK INDIAN JARGON FOR EVIL SPIRIT.</b>
<br><b>MY FATHER USED TO DO A LOT OF HIS DEER HUNTING IN KLICKITAT COUNTY
ALONG WITH A GOODLY PORTION OF ALL THE HUNTERS IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THE
HUNTING WAS USUALLY PRETTY GOOD. THIS TRIP THAT I AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE
REALLY HAPPENED AS TOLD TO ME BY MY FATHER.</b>
<br><b>MY FATHER AND TWO OF HIS FRIENDS FROM WORK DECIDED TO HUNT IN KLICKITAT
DURING THEIR NEXT DAYS OFF AND, DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS PRETTY NEW
TO THIS AREA, HE ALLOWED ONE OF HIS FRIENDS TO PICK THE AREA WHICH TURNED
OUT TO BE SKOOKUM CANYON. SKOOKUM CANYON IS WILD, RUGGED AND NOT VERY ACCESSIBLE
BUT THEY DO GET A FAIR AMOUNT OF DEER OUT OF THERE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BRAVE
ENOUGH TO HUNT THERE. THEY ARRIVED AT THE CANYON AND SET UP TENTS ON THE
RIM; MY FATHER, HIS TWO FRIENDS AND THEIR WIVES. MY MOTHER DID NOT WANT
TO GO AND STAYED HOME. CAMP WAS SET UP, DINNER WAS COOKED ON THE CAMPFIRE
AND, SINCE IT WAS STILL TOO EARLY TO GO TO BED, THEY SAT AROUND THE FIRE
TALKING FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME.</b>
<br><b>IT WAS JUST ABOUT BED TIME WHEN A WEIRD CRY CAME UP OUT OF THE CANYON
UNLIKE ANYTHING ANY OF THEM HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE. THEY ALL FROZE AND LISTENED
INTENTLY TO SEE IF IT WOULD COME AGAIN AND IT DID IN A FEW MINUTES. MY
FATHER TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD RAISE THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK AND
HE COULD NOT RECOGNIZE WHAT IT WAS EVEN THOUGH HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED HUNTER
AND KNEW THE WOODS VERY WELL. HIS TWO FRIENDS, HAVING HAD A COUPLE OF BEERS,
DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS AND DECIDED THAT THEY WERE
GOING TO TAKE THEIR RIFLES AND DROP INTO THE CANYON RIGHT THEN, AFTER DARK,
AND FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS. THEIR WIVES, BY THIS TIME THEY WERE THOROUGHLY
SPOOKED, DECIDED THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING ANYWHERE WITHOUT THEM SO ALL OF
THEM DROPPED INTO THE CANYON. THEY COULD STILL HEAR THIS WEIRD CRY EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE AND THEY KEPT ANGLING TOWARD IT. ONE OF THE WIVES STARTLED
AN OWL AND IT FLEW FROM REAL CLOSE TO HER HEAD AND SHE ALMOST HAD A HEART
ATTACK, ACCORDING TO HER.</b>
<br><b>BY THIS TIME, THEY HAD DESCENDED QUITE A WAY INTO THE CANYON AND
WERE TAKING A FEW STEPS, STOPPING AND LISTENING A LOT. THE WEIRD CRY, WHICH
HAD BEEN MOVING AWAY FROM THEM, ALL AT ONCE SEEMED TO STOP. THEY STOPPED
TOO, LISTENED, AND THE NEXT TIME THEY HEARD IT, IT SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE
CLOSER. THEY WERE STARTING TO GET JITTERY BY THIS TIME BUT THAT WAS NOTHING
COMPARED TO WHAT HAPPENED THE NEXT TIME THE CRY HAPPENED AS IT WAS REAL
CLOSE AND THEY COULD TELL THAT WHATEVER IT WAS HAD STOPPED RUNNING AND
WAS MOVING TOWARDS THEM. THE TWO WOMEN WERE GETTING FRANTIC BY THIS TIME
AND THE MEN WEREN'T MUCH BETTER SO THEY THOUGHT BETTER OF THE SITUATION
AND STARTED CLIMBING OUT OF THERE AS FAST AS THEY COULD. THEY WERE ALMOST
TO THE TOP OF THE RIM BEFORE WHAT EVER IT WAS TURNED BACK AND HEADED BACK
DOWN THE CANYON. THAT NIGHT, THE WOMEN REFUSED TO SLEEP IN THE TENT AND
THEY BOTH STAYED IN THE CAR. MY FATHER SLEPT IN THE TENT BUT HE SAID THAT
HE KEPT HIS RIFLE LOADED RIGHT BESIDE HIM AND A HUNTING KNIFE STUCK IN
A LOG RIGHT BESIDE HIS SLEEPING BAG.</b>
<br><b>THE REST OF THE TRIP WAS UNEVENTFUL AND THEY NEVER HEARD THE CRY
AGAIN. I DID TAKE A TRIP UP THERE TO SEE WHAT THE CANYON LOOKED LIKE A
FEW YEARS LATER AND STOPPED AT AN ANCIENT COUNTRY STORE FAIRLY CLOSE TO
THE CANYON. THERE WAS AN ELDERLY FELLOW SITTING ON THE FRONT PORCH AND
I STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION WITH HIM. I ASKED HIM IF THERE WAS ANYTHING
UNUSUAL ABOUT SKOOKUM CANYON. "YOUNG FELLER" HE REPLIED," THERE ARE THINGS
IN THAT CANYON THAT ARE BETTER LEFT UNDISCOVERED" AND THAT IS ALL THAT
I COULD GET OUT OF HIM. I HUNTED ELSEWHERE AFTER THAT.</b>

<p><b>Something In The Mirror</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LegendSalforand@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am 15 and moved into my house three years ago or so. Well anyway
I get scared easily when it comes to horror films and what not but I am
sure I saw something one night. It was 2 am or so and I had to go to the
bathroom. Well our bathroom in our ranch was currently out of service.
My mom told me if I absolutely had to go before it was fixed to either
use the sink if you need to go 1 or go outside. So at 2 am I wasn't that
nuts about going outside in the pitch black since we live on the outskirts
of town. So I went into the bathroom and starting going in my sink and
then when I was finished I looked up and if you look into the mirror. Well
with my mirror if the door is open you can see the hallway behind you.
So I look up and see this face that should've been in the hallway. I didn't
get a good view it looked tore up or something. Well a backed up into the
door and a high pitched soudn not a scream really but like a screech filled
my ears. I clutched them hard and sunk down shaking in fear. I sat there
for several minutes until I turned on all the lights in the house and since
then I always turn on the kitchen light at least to fill some light within
the house and the hallway. I always keep the door shut when I go to the
bathroom also and if I had the chance again I would go outside!</b>

<p><b>Taunton State Hospital (Howland Detention Center)</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DrunkardDaZe@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>As a juvenile I sent 6 months at the Howland Detention center. The
first night I was there someone woke up in the middle of the night screaming
and in cold sweats saying he saw a girl in the room. The next night they
put someone else in his room and moved him. The same thing happend!! The
kid said he saw a girl in the room. Over my six months there I witnessed
many unexplainable things, like how in August at 80+ degrees with no ac
certain places would be freezing cold. And almost like moaning sounds coming
from the vents in every room. Inside the detention center it doesnt look
like much has changed from the days of it being a mental hospital. It is
by far the scariest place I have ever been to. Oh yeah and as far as tunnels
underneath the entire complex, they are there! Ever since i've stayed there
ive been very interested in getting more info on the old asylum if you
have anything on this place please send it to me!!</b>

<br><b>The Mountains</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GreyDaemonKnight@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have recently stumbled upon you site and read some interesting
stories. Well I have one to share with you. Im 14 years old and have a
few experiences outside of my house. One was earlier this year when I went
to visit my moms friend in the Appalachin Mountains. We got there after
about a 5-6hour trip and I was tired, so i took a quick snooze on their
couch where I had dream about this guy wanting to hurt me, so I awoke and
felt my head and it was sweaty, so i just shook my head and went to the
kitchen. I learned we were all going to the farm a couple miles away, so
we got their and it was HUGE about 70+acres with trails for Quadding (ATV's).
So my friend Shane and I went up around 7 at night, and I reached the top
of the mountain and looked down where I saw this shadowy figure come charging
at me from about 150yards out. I quickly continued down the trail to where
it U-Turned and went back to the main trail, I went down the side of the
mountain at about 40-50mph when I noticed this figure was standing about
30yards away from us. I tried the brake but it wouldnt work and the next
thing I knew a force collided with my face and I flew off the quad and
landed in a patch of dirt where this thing was leaning over me, after about
a minute it vanished as Shane brought the quad back up and asked if I was
ok, i felt my face and it was severly bloody, I knew whatever it was it
didnt want me to stay.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Big Black Figure and the Brick House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Light1angel@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had a lot of experiacnces with the supernatural. All I know
is that I am psycic but I do not know what type I am. I can see and feel
the presence of ghost and/or spirits. I have been able to see them my whole
life and I am sixteen years old now. I am not going to say all of my experiances
cause that is to much to type right now but I will tell you about three.
One of them still happens now at my mothers house. There is a spirit there
and I have no idea what it is. He only comes out at night when I least
expect it and when I am all alone. I am the only one that can see or sense
him but I am not the only psycic in the house. The spirit shows up in the
form of a tall black man and is sorta transparent. He is at least a little
over six feet tall. When he shows up he only stays in the hallway. He appears
at the cornor by the living room and when you sense him or see him he disappears
and reappears right in front of my bedroom door. He has never harmed me
but I get a bad feeling from him. I have not figured out what he wants
from me yet or why he is coming to me in the first place and I am afraid
to talk to him or try and get rid of him..</b>
<br><b>I use to live in a brick house and the grounds that the house is
on is part of the area where the civil war was held. So naturally the house
is haunted by civil war ghost. You can hear the ghost walking up and down
the hallway at night. You can also hear them turn on the faucet in the
master bedroom. My dad would walk in there turn it off and tell them that
we are trying to sleep and they would stop for that night anyway. My closet
door in my bedroom would open and shut all by itself and so would my bedroom
door like someone is coming in.</b>
<br><b>One time my dads ex-girlfriend was cookin dinner and she seen a
cowboy walk from my brothers room to my sisters room. She could not describe
what he looked like. She saw him only one time after that.</b>
<br><b>I have had a lot more experiances since then and even though I have
been able to sense the all of my life they still scare me half to death
and I still run and get under the covers. My sister and I use to share
a room in the house that we are living in now and i use to see a teenage
girl about my age laying in the bed with me. I would turn to my left side
and she would be laying right there staring straight at me. All I could
see was her face but I can tell that she was some where around sixteen.
I could also see the imprint of her body laying in my bed. She use to come
almost every night then I prayed to God and told her leave that I am blessed
and so is this house. Ever since that night I have not seen her but I can
still feel her presence even though I have my own room now and my sister
got our old bedroom. To this day I fall asleep laying on my left side.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Legend</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cerberus_989@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened in the winter of last year. I can't remember the exact
date. Before I tell my story I need to tell the legend. I live in a rural
area with a lot of woodland and a few Indian burial grounds. The legend
goes that on a Friday full moon night if you call out to the wolf spirits
they will come to you. I've always wanted to try legends like these but
this was the first time I actually had a chance to do so. Near my Grandpa's
farm is one of these burial grounds and to say the least there has alway
been strange events. It was a cool night and was walking slowly to the
place. I was thirteen at the time and had to wait until about midnight
for my grandparents to go to sleep. As I got closer I started saying things
like "Come and show yourself spirits!" or I'd howl. I got there and waited.
After a few minutes nothing happened and I lost my temper I started yelling
things to them and when I was done I let out one long, deep howl. Everything
went silent, even the crickets stopped shirping, and from the other side
I heard two howls and the air rapidly grew cold. I saw two wolves. One
was white, the other was black. They came closer and I couldn't move. They
were close enough for me to tell the color of their eyes. The white wolf
had a l ht blue and the black had a dark yellow. They stopped about a foot
away from me. I was scared but I didn't feel threatened. I reached out
to touch one of them and it made no attempt to hurt me. I sat down and
they came closer and sat down beside me and I petted them. After a few
minutes I got up and left. They followed me until I got home then the just
stayed at the edge of the woods. A cloud covered the moon light and their
eyes glowed in the dark. But when the cloud left and the moon light shined
down again they were gone. Not to this day have I seen them again. Though
sometimes I hear a howl or two come from that burial ground and on those
nights I see them in my dreams. In those dreams I'm a wolf like them and
the dreams are always in my point of view. The scary part about all this
is that sometimes since then I've woken up with a little bit of black or
white fur on me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>about 12 or 1am... I woke up to the sensation of someone gently
squeezing my foot. By the time I opened my eyes, and could focus, my attention
was drawn to the bedroom door that leads to the hall.</b>
<br><b>I saw someone who looked almost exactly like my wife -- except for
being almost a head taller, and her hair flipped up at the ends. She was
wearing a dress that reminded me of a nautical style, with a bold stripe
on the collar.</b>
<br><b>The apparition then turned to look directly at me, and smiled at
me. My mind was filled with a happiness. amd a sense that everything was
OK.</b>
<br><b>Thinking it was my wife. I turned over, expecting her side of the
bed to be empty, and there she was -- sound asleep. I wgispered hello to
the spirit, wished her peace on her journey, rolled over, and went back
to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Maybe it sounds strange; but I wasn't at all daunted by this experience.

<p><b>Families Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ylimenna@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't even know for sure if I believe in ghosts, but I have always
been senstive to the feelings and impressions of houses, and I can tell
just by looking at a house that it is "haunted".&nbsp; I have several ghostly
stories that all happened in the metro Detroit area.&nbsp; These don't
represent the sum total of all the paranormal happenings in my family,
that would take much too long to write down, but suffice it to say that
no one in our family disbelieves in the paranormal world, we know just
enough to say we don't want to mess with it.&nbsp; The first happened when
I was about 10, and I was sulking in my bedroom because I had gotten in
a fight with my brother and sister.&nbsp; It was the 1980's and our house
in Detroit was at least 80 years old, a quirky old farmhouse that was built
by the farmer that had originally owned the surrounding properties.&nbsp;
My bedroom was upstairs at the front of the house, and my bedroom door
was in the center of the back bedroom wall and overlooked the short hallway
and the landing that led to the stairs.&nbsp; I could hear my family talking
and laughing downstairs as I sulked, and I sat up in my bed and saw, on
the landing, what I at first thought was my father, since it was a tall
man.&nbsp; I soon realized that it wasn't a man, but an older teenaged
boy, maybe 18,dressed entirely in light brown clothes, with sandy colored
hair and freckles.&nbsp; He looked as real as anyone in my own family.&nbsp;
I don't remember feeling scared or upset, but I closed my eyes and when
I opened them the boy was gone and my entire family was rushing into my
room.&nbsp; Apparently, unbeknownst to me, I had let out a bloodcurlding
scream. (I'm told I have a good set of screaming pipes)&nbsp; When they
got upstairs and saw that I was okay, they refused to listen to my story,
thinking that I had done it for attention because I felt left out, or that
I was just working myself up into hysterics and imagined the boy I saw.&nbsp;
The truth of the matter was that I was more upset that no one believed
me than I was that I had seen him, in fact I never really thought of it
as a ghost until my family said it, only telling them that I saw a boy.&nbsp;
My father was the only one who really listened to me, but I could tell
even he was skeptical.&nbsp; It wasn't until years later while studying
WWI in high school that I was a photo of a young man in Army uniform, very
different from the uniforms of today, and a little tickle went right up
my spine.&nbsp; It was what my young friend had been wearing on the landing
that day.&nbsp; I told my father and showed him the uniform in my textbook
and he recalled how I had described the boy's clothes and agreed it matched
my description that day.&nbsp;&nbsp; He suggested that the old farmer may
have had a young relative, son or nephew, who fought and died in WWI and
that is who I saw.&nbsp; The next strange circumstance was when I was sixteen
and we moved across town to a new house, this time a lower flat that had
an extremely large basement that had four cellar rooms that branched off
the main basement.&nbsp; We called it "Freddy's Basement" after Nightmare
on Elm Street, because anyone who went into that basement felt a menacing
force when they were down there.&nbsp; Everyone ran, not walked, up the
staircase, and we made sure we went down there as infrequently as possible.&nbsp;
One night my sister and I were upstairs, heating a can of nacho cheese
soup for chip dip and preparing to watch TV together.&nbsp; I had just
opened the lid with the can opener, and placed it on the counter cheesey
side up while I poured the cheese into a bowl and put it in the microwave.&nbsp;
Before I could throw the can and it's lid away, my sister called me into
the next room to see something that was happening on our television program.&nbsp;
I was gone for maybe two minutes, and we returned together into the kitchen
to find that the soup can lid was flipped over and smeared up and down
over the kitchen counter in large zig zags that could only have been done
deliberately.&nbsp; My sister and I were the only ones home when that happened.&nbsp;
We were very relieved when our mother and brothers finally came home.&nbsp;
Another time in the same house,&nbsp; a bowl of sherbet was on the counter
and left for a couple of seconds, only to find the bowl clear across the
room in the center of the kitchen table as if it had always been there.&nbsp;
As with most of the odd things that have happened to me, I was more confused,
curious and intrigued than scared by the experience.&nbsp; We did follow
the advice of an uncle who had ghosts of his own once, and proclaimed out
loud to the house that we were protected by Jesus Christ's love, and that
we did not want any more contact with any spirits, that it was our house
and they should not scare us anymore.&nbsp; We had no further experiences
in that house, but the basement was still ooky.&nbsp; I've been told by
a psychic that I'm a medium and that spirits will continue to seek me out,
that I could choose to develop my psychic abilities if I cared to, but
I believe that world should be left alone as much as possible.</b><b></b>

<br><b>I hear Ya Knocking</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jjmmaa6@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a story that is not mine.&nbsp; It actually happened to my
boyfriend, Nic</b>
<br><b>many years ago.</b>
<br><b>The only reason that I truly believe that this happened to him,
is that as he told me the story, he had this look of terror on his face
and I could see it in his eyes that he wasn't lying.&nbsp; Coming from
a tough 6'1, 250 lb. former football player, it had to be believed.</b>
<br><b>This is the story as it was relayed to me.......</b>
<br><b>Nic's parent's house is situated in a small community in Southwestern
Ontario,</b>
<br><b>smack beside one of the communities graveyards. Rather fitting for
a ghost story, wouldn't you say?</b>
<br><b>By all accounts, the graveyard is kept up beautifully and is not
creepy at all.&nbsp; I remember thinking when he first told me that his
parent's lived beside a graveyard, that I wouldn't be too keen about visiting,
but when I did, I didn't get any negative feelings at all.</b>
<br><b>At one time the house was thought to have been either a church,
school house, and/or even a barn.&nbsp; The house is so old, that no one
quite knows exactly what it was built as.&nbsp; After extensive renovations,
the house became quite livable, and comfortable.</b>
<br><b>The first floor has been renovated to take on an open concept.&nbsp;
This renovation is still in progress, and soon to be finished.&nbsp; Off
to the side of what is to be part of the living area, are the very steep
stairs heading up to the 3 bedrooms.&nbsp; The stairway going up is very
narrow and dark from the oak wood paneling that was installed 10 years
ago.&nbsp; The rest of the upstairs is decorated in the same fashion, making
it dark and very hard to see.</b>
<br><b>As you step up on the landing, directly in front is his bedroom,
to the left are the other two bedrooms and a very small bathroom.&nbsp;
The way that his bed would have been set at that time, is that the headboard
would have been located on the other side of the wall that faces the landing,
then there's the doorway.&nbsp; This is important to note as part of story.</b>
<br><b>This one particular night when the rest of his family was out, Nic
was laying in bed waiting to fall asleep.&nbsp; He told me that the time
was around 1:00.&nbsp; Pretty normal time for a 16 yr. old to be up.&nbsp;
All was quiet for a long time, when he heard a noise that sounded like
a knock at the bottom of the stairs.&nbsp; He really didn't think much
about it, house settling, animal perhaps, the knock was very faint anyway.
So he forgets it and is waiting for sleep to come.</b>
<br><b>A few minutes later the same noise is heard. and it is definitely
a knock.&nbsp; This time it's a bit louder.&nbsp; Once again, he brushes
it off, thinking that there was some logical explanation for this to happen.&nbsp;
Then again, a bit later, the knock is heard coming from the stair wall....it
sounds as if this knocking is continuing up the stairway...this time it's
even louder than the previous two times.</b>
<br><b>Now Nic is scared, thinking that someone has broken into the house
and is slowly making their way up the stairs.&nbsp; After a bit, all is
quiet, and there are no more knocks or noises.&nbsp; Nic relaxes, thinks
how silly he is for being afraid and is trying yet again to fall asleep.&nbsp;
Just as he's almost asleep, he hears the knock again...and this time he
figures it's about at the top of the stairway.&nbsp; By now, he's fully
expecting to see someone pop their head into his room...maybe one of his
crazy friends that likes to pull pranks...anything that he can think rationally.&nbsp;
Once again there is silence...this time it holds out longer.</b>
<br><b>Nic still doesn't know what to think about all that's going on.&nbsp;
All he knows is that he's not going to be leaving his bed for anything!&nbsp;
Just then. as things have calmed down yet again he hears the knock again,
but this time it's directly above his head on his wooden headboard!&nbsp;
He knows it was his headboard because he could feel the vibrations from
the headboard.&nbsp; All he could do at this time was to look to see if
someone was around the bed...playing a joke, but no such luck.&nbsp; There
was no one there.........</b>
<br><b>That was the last he heard of the knocking that night, and for the
rest of the time he spent living there.&nbsp; I do know that he was scared
to sleep in that house for many months after the incident. When he told
me that story, I was almost in tears I was so creeped out.</b>
<br><b>I hope you enjoyed my story</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Cogdell Light</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CMoosiejc@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have been to Cogdell Georgia, and I have seen the "light" there
many times.&nbsp;&nbsp; One night while we were there waiting to see the
light, we saw what we thought to be the Cogdell Light, but as we watched
it we soon realized we were looking at car lights coming toward us , so
we backed up to the cross road behind us to let the approaching car pass.&nbsp;
We were sitting there waiting for the car to&nbsp; pass us ,when all at
once there was a "light" over the car&nbsp; we were watching, and the "light"
was staying right over the car no matter how fast it went.&nbsp; The car
finally got down to where we were and as they turned to the left onto another
road, the light went out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That light was so bright that
you could see the color of the car and it was&nbsp; a very dark night.&nbsp;
My uncle use to work for the State of Georgia, and he told&nbsp; us that
one day the crew that he worked with had to go to Cogdell, and work on
that road that the light appears on.&nbsp; There was three bridges on that
dirt road, and from time to time they would have to go out there and do
some work on the road or one of the bridges there.&nbsp; He said that one
day (on over toward three or four oclock the crew was down there working
on cutting a big stump from under one of the bridges (apparently the stump
was stopping the water from flowing under the bridge ,and had to be removed),
they realized that they needed a piece of equipment that they hadn't brought
with them, so my uncle said he would stay down there and wait for the guys
to go get the equipment , because they had removed some of the boards from
the bridge, and someone needed to stay there to "warn people" that the
bridge was out.&nbsp; He said thet he sat there on that bridge until dark,
and he said he never saw anything but some tail lights once in&nbsp; a
while, and ever so often he'd see some car lights.&nbsp; We told him that
he was seeing the Cogdell light , but he never believed it was there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That light&nbsp; got over our car one night, and you could have picked
up a needle off the floor of the car, that's how bright it was inside the
car.&nbsp; As soon as we turned off that road, the light went out like
you'd turned off a switch.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no sound from it at all,
just this big, bright light over us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were told that years
ago there had been a train wreck there.&nbsp; The train was used back then
to haul logs out of that area, and that the train wreck was caused by some
dogs being on the tracks, and a couple of people were killed .&nbsp; I
don't know if that is true or not, but I do know that the "light" is there</b>
