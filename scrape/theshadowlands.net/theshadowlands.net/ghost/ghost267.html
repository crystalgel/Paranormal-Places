<P><B>Ghost Seen</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: paranormalman2003@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When i was younger i dont remember my age i was looking out the window
with my brother and sister and then saw something that changed my life.
I saw a green figure running through the woods. From then on i just wanted
to find out as much as possible about ghosts. That figure just freaked
me out, and i dont know why he was there, but i know i was seeing clearly.
It was very exiting, and i always wanted to tell everyone that ghost are
real. Then i found this ghost site and i was very glad so i thought i would
just tell you my fisrt [and only so far] specter sighting.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: crybaby1117@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>The first time I had a "supernatural" expierience, I was asleep in
my room</B>
<BR><B>at my parents house. Now, I knew this house was haunted because
in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the night I would hear something banging on my walls or
my doors,</B>
<BR><B>and our dog, who slept inside would bark on and off during one night,
and</B>
<BR><B>the next night be completely quiet. But on this particular night,
I saw an</B>
<BR><B>angel. I am afraid of the dark (yes, I know, a 20 year old who is
afraid of</B>
<BR><B>the dark), but I had lived with my fiancee for so long I got used
to</B>
<BR><B>sleeping with the lights off. As I was asleep, I was awaken by someone</B>
<BR><B>opening and closing my bed room door to check on me. About 30 seconds
after</B>
<BR><B>they closed the door, I looked up and I saw a woman standing at
the foot of</B>
<BR><B>my bed. She was transparent, and she was a gold/orange color. She
smiled at</B>
<BR><B>me, and rose up into the ceiling and disappeared, and another one
just like</B>
<BR><B>her followed. I could tell they were angels because I had noticed
that I</B>
<BR><B>wasn't afraid of them. And since then I had seen the first one often,
and</B>
<BR><B>every time I feel conforted and love.</B>
<BR><B>Just this September (2002) my fiancee and I bought a condo, and
moved in. I</B>
<BR><B>could feel something evil in the house, but I usually felt the presence</B>
<BR><B>everywhere I went, so it was no big deal. By now I was used to seeing
ghosts</B>
<BR><B>and angels. I later found out that there is an old refrigerator
under our</B>
<BR><B>house. Ask me why and I couldn't tell you. Anyways, about a month
after we</B>
<BR><B>moved in we bought a 6 week old Shih-Tzu puppy. About 2 days after
we bought</B>
<BR><B>her, my fiancee and I were sleeping when he woke me up and told
me the dog</B>
<BR><B>was on the bed. This, of course, was impossible since she was only
6 weeks</B>
<BR><B>old, had short legs, and our bed was tall with nothing around it
for her to</B>
<BR><B>jump up on. When we woke up in the morning he told me that he had
felt</B>
<BR><B>something tugging at the covers around his neck and growling, and
when he</B>
<BR><B>rolled over it ran and jumped off the bed. I just passed it off
as him</B>
<BR><B>dreaming. But about a week later while he was at work (he works
night shift)</B>
<BR><B>I was asleep and I woke up because it felt like something was running
from</B>
<BR><B>one end of the bed to the other, and back and forth. When I rolled
over it</B>
<BR><B>stopped. That kind of freaked me out. Then about 3 months later
I woke up</B>
<BR><B>and saw a hand coming out of our closet door with what seemed to
be a letter</B>
<BR><B>or a piece of paper in it's fingers. The hand was small and caucasian.
When</B>
<BR><B>I gasped it disappeared. Then, about a week after that the bed would</B>
<BR><B>periodically shake while I was asleep. I later asked my fiancee
if he ever</B>
<BR><B>felt the bed shake and he told me he did, and when he described
how it felt</B>
<BR><B>I knew we were both feeling the same thing. It's a subtle shaking
as if it</B>
<BR><B>were an earthquake except we live in Virginia where we don't have</B>
<BR><B>earthquakes, at least not the kind you can feel. It was almost as
if there</B>
<BR><B>was a big dog on the bed scratching furiously at a flea. And he
also</B>
<BR><B>discribed it the way that I would have which is when you wake up,
your first</B>
<BR><B>thought is "Man, is my heart beating THAT hard?!" And then you realize
that</B>
<BR><B>it isn't your heart at all. And just last week I saw a young woman
with</B>
<BR><B>brown curly hair and brown eyes peering at me from a crack in the
closet</B>
<BR><B>door, and last night the downstairs bathroom door slammed by itself
and the</B>
<BR><B>bed shook with BOTH of us on it. Usually it only shakes with one
of us on</B>
<BR><B>it. Anywho, that's my story. If you have any insight please give
it to me,</B>
<BR><B>and you can put the stories on your site.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have seen people that have passed away ever since i was 8 yrs old.
I do not see Andy, the one i was engaged to, that drowned, but, he has
talked to me and tried to get me to come where he is.&nbsp; I told him
right after he drowned, i wouldnt leave my mom and dad. That was in 1964,
that he drowned, and that happened, i was just 16 yrs old. He is still
around, he says, he is protecting me, because someone is going to try to
kill me.&nbsp; My mother and dad even heard him talking from the ceiling
,from the top of my room.&nbsp; I could tell you alot of things that has
happened ,from people who have passed.the day he drowned, i was painting
the living room, and i cleaned off a picture of christ, it started bleeding

<BR><B>Antiques</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: diane@navisfilms.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been on your website many times reading alot of the stories
that have</B>
<BR><B>come from other&nbsp; people.&nbsp; Anyway, my family and I have
been living in a</B>
<BR><B>haunting for several years now.&nbsp; Let me explain.</B>
<BR><B>I grew up in a haunted house, moved in with my boyfriend (now husband)and</B>
<BR><B>his house was haunted and when we moved to Des Plaines to our new
house, we</B>
<BR><B>had a priest come bless the house just in case.&nbsp; We moved in
October 2001</B>
<BR><B>and things were quite.&nbsp; Because we only had one set of living
room furniture</B>
<BR><B>and the basement was finished, we decided to put it down there and
buy new</B>
<BR><B>furniture for the living room area.&nbsp; The basement was always
extra cold,</B>
<BR><B>where even with a space heater, blankets and extra sweaters you
could never</B>
<BR><B>quite warm up.&nbsp; Plus, it always felt like someone was constantly
watching</B>
<BR><B>you to the point I would turn around expecting to see someone or
something.</B>
<BR><B>As time went on many things started to happen.&nbsp; My youngest
son had fallen</B>
<BR><B>asleep in our bedroom and my husband was not home from work yet.&nbsp;
It was</B>
<BR><B>around 11:00 pm on a Sunday night and something woke me up and as
I looked</B>
<BR><B>at my son, it was as if something was standing at the bottom end
of the bed</B>
<BR><B>and had both his ankles and was pulling him off of the bed.&nbsp;
My son was</B>
<BR><B>actually moving down the bed and he was sound asleep!&nbsp; I quickly
woke him up</B>
<BR><B>and sent him to his room scared to death because I did not understand
what</B>
<BR><B>was happening.&nbsp; As time has gone on things have gotton worse.&nbsp;
We have</B>
<BR><B>experienced scratching in the wall in the bedroom where the crucifix
hangs.</B>
<BR><B>I have seen things out of the corner of my eye, only to look and
nothings</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; The cats stare at things and then get agitated and
run away.</B>
<BR><B>In December of last year we purchase antique furniture; a big chest,
a china</B>
<BR><B>cabinet and a chiffarobe.&nbsp; That was when things started to
heat up!&nbsp; We have</B>
<BR><B>had things fly across the room, knocking on the walls, twice I have
been</B>
<BR><B>doing laundry in the basement and heard my name called only there
was no one</B>
<BR><B>in the house but me.&nbsp; The lights in the basement have shut&nbsp;
off by</B>
<BR><B>themselves on both my husband and myself.&nbsp; Let me state that
in December we</B>
<BR><B>had also moved the furniture from the basement upstairs.&nbsp; I
have always felt</B>
<BR><B>extremely uncomfortable and freaked out in the basement especially
when the</B>
<BR><B>lights are off.&nbsp; It seems like something is standing there
waiting.&nbsp; Well it</B>
<BR><B>had gotton so bad that we had a physic and a group of ghost investigators</B>
<BR><B>come to the house.&nbsp; Immediately they started taking photos
of different</B>
<BR><B>rooms, and there were orbs all over the place, especially in the
basement.</B>
<BR><B>The physic stated that the spirits upstairs were different than
the one</B>
<BR><B>spirit downstairs.&nbsp; The one downstairs was pure evil with a
bad intent to do</B>
<BR><B>harm.&nbsp; Plus this particular spirit liked to follow me around.&nbsp;
Jamie even</B>
<BR><B>tried staying in the basement overnight to get more information
and he woke</B>
<BR><B>up at 3:00 am and took off.&nbsp; The reason was that it was extremely
cold and</B>
<BR><B>he could not get comfortable, and there was this popping noise by
the</B>
<BR><B>furnace area but the furnace was not on. Plus it constantly felt
like</B>
<BR><B>someone was watching him.&nbsp; When he finally did fall asleep
he was woken up</B>
<BR><B>to someone spooning with him but he was alone.&nbsp; That was the
last straw and</B>
<BR><B>he left.</B>
<BR><B>We have since had another priest come to bless the house again,
but it has</B>
<BR><B>only seemed to drain the energy but not gotton rid of it all together.</B>
<BR><B>Things had quited down but have started&nbsp; up again, so I believe
what ever it</B>
<BR><B>is does not want to leave and will continue to remain until who
knows when.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ancestral Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: langwela@tcd.ie</B><B></B>

<P><B>Just found this site and thought I'd tell you about my experience
with what</B>
<BR><B>I think was a ghost. This is true, yet it's almost as if it wasn't
happening</B>
<BR><B>to</B>
<BR><B>me. It was... surreal, paranormal even! lol!</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I'm from Dublin, Ireland, and when I was a boy (I forget
how old I</B>
<BR><B>was, maybe about 14 or 15) I was staying with my parents with my
old</B>
<BR><B>Aunt at my family's ancestral home in Co. Roscommon. There is a
very</B>
<BR><B>old church just up the road from the house - it's so close that
you can take</B>
<BR><B>a short-cut across just one field and you're there. It used to be
part of an</B>
<BR><B>old Franciscan Monastery. Anyway, I was in that church on my own
one</B>
<BR><B>summer's afternoon. It was a hot day, and though the church was</B>
<BR><B>naturally cooler, it was only a degree or so cooler. I remember
feeling a</B>
<BR><B>little uneasy all of a sudden, the hackles on my neck rose. I thought
my</B>
<BR><B>little sister had followed me in but then the temperature literally
nose-</B>
<BR><B>dived from somewhere in the high 90s to the mid 40s in a matter
of</B>
<BR><B>seconds. I sensed that someone, or something, was watching me from</B>
<BR><B>the choir-balcony above and behind me. Something told me that it
sure as</B>
<BR><B>hell wasn't human; I don't know how but I knew. I slowly turned
and looked</B>
<BR><B>up... Three seconds later I was tearing down the road as fast as
my legs</B>
<BR><B>could carry me.</B>
<BR><B>What I saw was the semi-transparent, cowled figure of a Franciscan</B>
<BR><B>monk regarding me from the balcony. He was barely there, yet details,
the</B>
<BR><B>folds of his robe, the heavy cross about his neck and the shaded
outline</B>
<BR><B>of a face was visible, yet weirdly see-through. I'm now 20 and still
refuse</B>
<BR><B>to enter that church alone. I have since asked the Parish priest
about it, he</B>
<BR><B>explained that he had seen the apparition a couple of times when
he was</B>
<BR><B>alone in the church, but refused to comment or speculate further.</B>
<BR><B>If you have any comments or explanations or what the hell it wanted
I'd</B>
<BR><B>welcome e-mails. I rarely think of it, it's almost as if it happened
to</B>
<BR><B>someone else, maybe because i've almost convinced myself I was</B>
<BR><B>seeing things - but what about the sudden temperature drop?</B><B></B>

<P><B>An Old Barn and Scary Experiences...............</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Moozerjames@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My Grandmother told me a story about her granomother when she was
a little girl....It all started when her granomother used to live in an
old farm house with her 2 brothers on the third floor. Her grandmother
also had her new born child....</B>
<BR><B>One day as her grandmother was walking down the hall she noticed
that the candle in the hallway looked strange.She went a little closer
and saw that something was going over the candle..She wasn't sure what
it was and wasn't really concerned at the time...I guess a few weeks or
days went by and she was walking down the hall holding her new born baby..All
of the sudden she felt something pulling the baby away from her.....She
couldn't see anything infront of her..So she got a little scared and started
to worry...Another day she heard somebody sneaze on the third floor.When
her brother came down the steps she had asked if he was sick because she
heard him sneaze upstairs. He then replied that he didn't&nbsp; sneaze
and he never was on the third floor.</B>
<BR><B>A few years later she moved out and never went back..Strange happenings
happened in that farm house.And till this day no one knows what it was....</B>

<BR><B>Adobe House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jamesey24@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I stumbled on to your website and was absolutely</B>
<BR><B>fascinated!&nbsp; It's my turn to tell you my story.</B>
<BR><B>I grew up in a small town in northeastern Arizona.</B>
<BR><B>When I was 8 my mom, older sister and I moved into an</B>
<BR><B>old adobe house in one of the older neighborhoods.</B>
<BR><B>>From what we were told, the house was over 100 years</B>
<BR><B>old.&nbsp; It was a large 3 bedroom house with large rooms,</B>
<BR><B>and long narrow hallways.&nbsp; I hated it.&nbsp; From the</B>
<BR><B>moment we moved in I hated it.&nbsp; My mom's room was on</B>
<BR><B>the front of the house, just off of the dining room.</B>
<BR><B>There was a covered porch, the living room with a</B>
<BR><B>large picture window.&nbsp; The dining room also had a</B>
<BR><B>large picture window.&nbsp; The kitchen faced the side of</B>
<BR><B>the house, then a back porch.&nbsp; The hallway off of the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen led to the bathroom and my sister's room, then</B>
<BR><B>there was a random hallway leading to nowhere in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the house.&nbsp; It was just there.&nbsp; Parallel to</B>
<BR><B>that was the hallway where my room was which joined</B>
<BR><B>the hall where the bathroom was.&nbsp; Confused yet?</B>
<BR><B>Sorry.&nbsp; Just giving you some background.</B>
<BR><B>In the winter my mom's room was roasting hot.&nbsp; Even</B>
<BR><B>when the rest of the house was cold.&nbsp; In the Summer</B>
<BR><B>her room was FREEZING cold.&nbsp; She had to have tons of</B>
<BR><B>blankets on her bed while we were sleeping with just</B>
<BR><B>sheets.&nbsp; It started with my mom.&nbsp; In the middle of</B>
<BR><B>night she and my older sister came and woke me up adn</B>
<BR><B>took me into the living room.&nbsp; There was a large</B>
<BR><B>arched doorway that seperated the living room from the</B>
<BR><B>dining room.&nbsp; We were huddled on the couch and my mom</B>
<BR><B>said that she was lying in bed, and her room was</B>
<BR><B>freezing.&nbsp; Then she heard a sound in the attic, like a</B>
<BR><B>brick being drug across the floor up there.&nbsp; Then it</B>
<BR><B>moved down into the wall (remember this is a SOLID</B>
<BR><B>adobe structure) and then under the house.&nbsp; That was</B>
<BR><B>followed quickly by the sound of rushing water in the</B>
<BR><B>attic, in the wall, under the house.&nbsp; Then the</B>
<BR><B>curtains started moving (the windows were shut by the</B>
<BR><B>way.)&nbsp; She freaked and woke my sister up, who was 16</B>
<BR><B>at the time.&nbsp; My sister went in there and she heard it</B>
<BR><B>too, and then the lights went out.&nbsp; From then on my</B>
<BR><B>mom would not sleep in her room.&nbsp; She slept on the</B>
<BR><B>hida bed in the living room.</B>
<BR><B>We called my uncle to come over and check things out.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing in the attic.&nbsp; Empty.&nbsp; Nothing under the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; This aunt and uncle had lived in the house</B>
<BR><B>several years before and my aunt told my mom that she</B>
<BR><B>used to hear babies crying in the night.&nbsp; And it</B>
<BR><B>wasn't her kids that were crying!&nbsp; They were sound</B>
<BR><B>asleep.&nbsp; Well then all kinds of weird stuff started</B>
<BR><B>happening.&nbsp; I'd be in my room and my mom would be in</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen.&nbsp; I'd hear her call me and tell me to come</B>
<BR><B>to the kitchen quick.&nbsp; I'd go running and she'd tell</B>
<BR><B>me that she never called me.&nbsp; Every night for a year</B>
<BR><B>when we sat down to dinner in the dining room, someone</B>
<BR><B>would knock on the front door.&nbsp; Every single night.</B>
<BR><B>At first we'd go and check but no one would be there.</B>
<BR><B>Then when we sat down they'd knock again.&nbsp; Finally we</B>
<BR><B>just gave up and they'd stay there and knock on the</B>
<BR><B>door while we ate dinner.</B>
<BR><B>We often heard doors shut where there were no doors,</B>
<BR><B>catch glimpses of someone passing down the hall and</B>
<BR><B>into my sister's bedroom.&nbsp; I hated being there alone</B>
<BR><B>after school (latch key kid).&nbsp; So I'd sit on the front</B>
<BR><B>porch by the front door until my mom came home.&nbsp; Often</B>
<BR><B>times we'd catch someone peeking in our windows from</B>
<BR><B>outside, only to run to the window or outside and find</B>
<BR><B>no one there.</B>
<BR><B>At night when I tried to sleep I'd hear someone pacing</B>
<BR><B>the hall, every night up and down the hall in front of</B>
<BR><B>my bedroom.&nbsp; Pacing pacing pacing.&nbsp; Appliances would</B>
<BR><B>turn back on after my mom would turn them off.&nbsp; Voices</B>
<BR><B>whispering all the time.&nbsp; Crashing noises, banging</B>
<BR><B>noises.&nbsp; All kinds of stuff.&nbsp; One day I came home from</B>
<BR><B>school and could hear someone breathing.</B>
<BR><B>Things got worse and more intense as time wore on.</B>
<BR><B>One day I wrecked my bike and screwed my leg up pretty</B>
<BR><B>bad.&nbsp; That night I slept on the hidabed in the living</B>
<BR><B>room with my mom.&nbsp; She got up at 5:30 to take a shower</B>
<BR><B>and get ready for work.&nbsp; I turned the tv on.&nbsp; I saw</B>
<BR><B>something out of the corner of my eye in the dining</B>
<BR><B>room so I turned to look - there was a very tall man</B>
<BR><B>standing in the arched doorway leading to the dining</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; Just standing there.&nbsp; All I saw was from the</B>
<BR><B>chest down.&nbsp; He was wearing a red tee shirt and jeans.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Just standing there.&nbsp; I didn't see a head or</B>
<BR><B>anything.&nbsp; Of course I absolutely flipped out</B>
<BR><B>screaming and he disappeared.&nbsp; That was the last</B>
<BR><B>straw.&nbsp; We moved out.&nbsp; It was empty for years after</B>
<BR><B>that.&nbsp; After about 8 years someone else moved in and</B>
<BR><B>they have lived there for about 7 years.&nbsp; I wonder if</B>
<BR><B>they hear things too, or if they just got accustomed</B>
<BR><B>to it.&nbsp; I still dream about that house at least once</B>
<BR><B>or twice a month.&nbsp; Very weird.&nbsp; Thanks.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>A Little Girl and a Blue Flash</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mellow_yellow@msmeow.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Lisa Wilson and i am 15 years old and live in</B>
<BR><B>a house that is only 14 years old .I have always</B>
<BR><B>believed in ghosts.There have been times when i might</B>
<BR><B>have seen one, lots of times, but i can't be sure. These</B>
<BR><B>are two of those times. The first one was about two</B>
<BR><B>years ago in the summer time. My friend and I were</B>
<BR><B>walking through the small field across from my house and</B>
<BR><B>when we looked back towards the park beside my house a</B>
<BR><B>little brown haired girl with jeans and a pink sweater</B>
<BR><B>ran out of the bushes towards us. For some reason we</B>
<BR><B>were scared and so we ran. When we got to the roas out</B>
<BR><B>of the field and looked back she wasn't anyhwhere. That</B>
<BR><B>was on a Friday. The very next Friday at around the same</B>
<BR><B>time we were walking through another field, this one had</B>
<BR><B>a little path with really long grass all around. All of</B>
<BR><B>a sudden my friend screamed and ran, I thought she saw a</B>
<BR><B>snake so I ran too. After we got out of the field we</B>
<BR><B>stopped running and i asked her what it was. She said</B>
<BR><B>that it was the little girl, she was sitting on top of</B>
<BR><B>the long grass, which of course couldn't happen because</B>
<BR><B>the grass would have sunk down. The next Friday we went</B>
<BR><B>out hoping to see her again and maybe this time talk to</B>
<BR><B>her but she didn't show up and we haven't seen her</B>
<BR><B>since. The second time was in my house about a year and</B>
<BR><B>a half ago. I was sleeping and I know I was dreaming</B>
<BR><B>about something scary because when i woke up I felt</B>
<BR><B>startled. All of a sudden there was a huge flash of blue</B>
<BR><B>light and two people, a man and a woman, banged against</B>
<BR><B>my wall, they were holding on to each other like a hug</B>
<BR><B>and hit my wall sideways. It made a huge bang. I thought</B>
<BR><B>I must have dreamt it so I just got up and got a glass</B>
<BR><B>of water. The next morning my brother told me that he</B>
<BR><B>heard me. I thought he meant when I was getting the</B>
<BR><B>water but when I asked he said "no, that huge bang." I</B>
<BR><B>couldn't have hit the wall myself because it would have</B>
<BR><B>hurt a lot, so I couldn't have been dreaming. I hope</B>
<BR><B>that these were real ghost experiences because I've</B>
<BR><B>always been extremely interested them but if not then I</B>
<BR><B>don't know what they would be. I just thought I'd share</B>
<BR><B>that and i hope you enjoyed reading it.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Friends House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: doug.cotton@ns.sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Amanda and I am 24. I have been interested in ghosts
since I can remember. I met my friend about two years ago. Her boyfriend
was in jail at the time and she hated to stay in her apartment by herself
because she said it was haunted.One of my cousins lived with her but she
was never their and my friend has two daughters. Her boyfriend told about
a guy that he said used to live there. He died a couple years before they
moved in, no one really knows what happened to him they just know he died.
Anyway she got me to stay with her one night she got me to stay with her.
Her and her oldest daughter(she was 2 at the time) slept on an air mattress
on the floor, I had her bed and her baby was in her crib (This was all
in the same room). We went to bed around 11:00 or 12:00. She only had two
pillows so I took my cousins pillow from her room. I have a hard time sleeping
some where other than my own bed so I kept waking up all night. I think
I woke up around three and I heard the two front doors open and someone
came up the stairs and went into my cousins room. So I figured she would
come and get her pillow. I must have dozed off just after that because
it was starting to get light out so I figured it was around 5:00 or 6:00,
that's when I heard someone downstairs getting a glass and carrying keys
because I heard them jingle, then the front door closed. Well when my friend
woke up around 7:00 I told her I thought I heard my cousin. She told me
I couldn't have because she locked the doors and mt cousin lost her keys
weeks before. I told her if I had know that I would have jump up and out
of there. She told me I better have awakened her up and taken her and her
kids too. A few weeks later she got some Holy water and put crosses all
over the house and she says she hasn't heard anything since but her boyfriend
says someone opened their bedroom closet (which is noisy to open) and it
wasn't him. Another story is from her neighbour. She came home one night
to get something and she says it felt like someone was in the house and
she went downstairs to leave and her CDs went flying out of the rack. She
has since moved. I know it was long but thank you for listening. If anyone
has any stories the want to share email me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Grandmother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rob@railbuff.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My grandmother and I have always had a fascination for trains.&nbsp;
My grandmother's father was a yard foreman on the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad
in Boston Massachusetts, so my grandmother always kind of had the interest
that was shared by her father, and that kind of followed into me.&nbsp;
She would always tell me stories about riding the trains when she was a
kid, going on long trips, etc. Anyway, a few months ago, she was diagnosed
with a terminal illness and got very sick for a while.&nbsp; Then, one
day my mother and aunt, (Both daughters of my grandmother) were in my grandmother's
apartment with her when they heared a really long and loud train whistle,
when they went to see if my grandmother had heared it, she had just passed.&nbsp;
My mother said that she looked out the window to the tracks across the
street, and there wasn't a train on the tracks.&nbsp; Also another aunt
of mine was at her house a few miles away and said she heard the whistle,
and that in the past 30 years of living in that house had never heard a
whistle blast that long or loud.&nbsp; Now, I don't know if maybe a short
train with a really loud horn went by quick enough for them to hear the
whistle but not see it, but for this to happen at the moment of death of
a person that loves trains seems a little creapy to me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Who's There?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LORRAINENINDY@wmconnect.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i still feel funny talking about this because the only people that
seem to believe me are the children around here.&nbsp; you describe some
of the things that have happened in your # 2 list of types of ghost so
maybe i'm not crazy.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;we moved to this 120 year old farmhouse about 4 years ago.&nbsp;
when we first moved here my youngest son was 3.&nbsp; he would ride his
tricycle back and forth from the living room to the kitchen which at the
end was the basement door.&nbsp; i was doing the dishes when he turned
to me and ask me to stop laughing at him.&nbsp; i told him i didn't say
anything so he proceeded to go back to the living room and back again.&nbsp;
when he reached the basement door he turned to me and said "can you hear
them mommy, their laughing at me".&nbsp; i left it alone but i never forgot
it.&nbsp; as time went on little things would happened that really got
my attention like the smell of perspiration when nobody was around.&nbsp;
it would only last a minute or two and it would only be in one spot of
the room.&nbsp; i would go to other parts of the room but could smell nothing
until i went back to the original spot and it would still be there.&nbsp;
i would also smell it as if it were just passing by in front of me and
then be gone.&nbsp; this continued for the next year and then one day i
laid down with my son for a nap.&nbsp; it was about 1:00 in the afternoon.&nbsp;
i would wait until he fell asleep and then i would get up but before i
could move our bed started shaking for no reason.&nbsp; it only lasted
a couple of minutes.</B>
<BR><B>after that things happened a lot.&nbsp; my eight year old started
to get smacked on the leg when he was asleep.&nbsp; he would always come
downstairs afraid after it would happen.&nbsp; i started getting knudged
on my leg at night like someone was trying to wake me up.&nbsp; i am a
very light sleeper so i would wake up immediately and look all around my
bed and my room but nobody was there.&nbsp; one night when i was sleeping
i felt something lay across my legs.&nbsp; i try to move but it was heavy
so i started kick real hard and crazy and it went away. again nothing was
there.&nbsp; my son was five when he asked me if i could see the mans work
boots standing in my dining room.&nbsp; he would see black things floating
by and ask if i saw them.&nbsp; he would describe them like shadows.&nbsp;
but the clincher was when we were all sleeping at 4:00 in the morning and
my dresser started shaking so hard i thought it was going to fall over.&nbsp;
i spoke to my pastors wife about it and she said they say a prayer every
night that asks the lord to protect them from any harm or evil.&nbsp; my
children and i started including that in our prayers but we added spirits
also and we have never had another problem since, except i do still smell
him from time to time and i do still here footsteps across the ceiling
when nobody is upstairs.&nbsp; but that's no problem i don't mind.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;thanks for giving me a place to tell my story and not feel
like i'm crazy.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;Toby</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: GeckoKd@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>(This was not a scary experience for me but rather a relieving experience.)
I met my friend&nbsp; Toby when i was in 4th grade. he was 2 years older
than me and i had the biggest crush on him. we continued to be friends
and in 7th grade i was put in a 9th grade study hall so i got to talk to
him more. i used to draw pictures of him and give them to him and every
time he thanked me with a big hug.</B>
<BR><B>then in 8th grade i didn't see him much. i guess he and his girlfriend
were having a hard time or something because he was ignoring her and everyone
else aswell. the next&nbsp; day i was in gym and the principal came the
PA system and said he had something important to tell us. He said "i have
sad news.....one of your fellow students has past away late last night.....Tobias."he
had committed suicide.</B>
<BR><B>with this news i burst out in tears and all of my friends came and
surrounded me and tried to comfort me.&nbsp; i was so depressed i cried
for months, i didnt eat much, and was doing very bad in all of my classes.
one night i just couldnt sleep and i was talking to the wall, asking what
would make my friend do this to himself, and i kept saying (hoping that
he could hear me) "i miss you , i love you, i will always love you!" when
i finally started to dose off, i felt somebody hugging me! and i new it
was Toby! I didnt see anything or hear anything but i felt as if he was
telling me that he was ok and that he missed me, and would watch over me.</B>
<BR><B>after that everthing got better my grades, my whole life! and the
best thing is that i know i will always have a guardian angel watch ing
over me.</B>

<BR><B>The special guest that time has forgotten.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Aries32473@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; It had started out like any other day, My friends and i were
out on a sunday drive as we call them, when we came across this road that
seemed to head to no where, we all decided to take it, when we did it was
like any other road, dirty old tracks, with a few ran down house's on either
side of the road. We all were listening to the radio really not paying
much attention the house that was to the left of us, I had decided to pull
over and take a look and snap a few pictures of the house, this house seemed
odd to me at the time, so my friend and i went inside the house to look
around a bit ( this was a ran down house that no one lived in ), so upon
entering the house, i had turned to my friend and said to her that this
was a really odd but strange house, although she had looked alittle faint
at first when i had told her that, she had asked me why, and i could not
explain it....but it was weird. So we both started to walk inside this
room where we beileve this was the dinning room, or maybe a living room,
you could see the old paint on the wall, and there was a few little marks
on the wall, Then out of no where came a strnage feeling...a feeling that
i could not explain, it was like something was trying to tell me something,
something was pulling me closer to this house, but what, at that time i
told my friend that we had to go, So we all left, and went back home. That
night my dog and were sitting in my bedroom looking at those picture that
i had snaped of the house, ( i was using a digi cam ) the picture's turned
out smoky, and faint, all but one picture, this picture i was looking at,
had a face in it, somehow i knew that person in the photo, but that couldnt
be i was thinking to myself, so i had put it off for the night, but was
still troubled by that present of that house, well that night i had a vister.....my
spacial guest as i call him, he was an older man, i would say to be about
in his 70's, and what he did next was a step i never thought i would go
into, I awoke that night by mydog barking, a low bark, and yet he seemed
to be freighten by something, then i seen him......that man standing by
my doorway, somehow i didnt get scared or was afraid of him, it was calm
feeling that swept over me, he just looked at me and i looked at him, then
he was some how floating towards me, he sit down and had touched the top
of my head, and i could see everything he did, I saw that house that was
haunting my mind, I saw a man and women in the yard enjoying the day as
i would have tooking it, and there was a little girl and and a little boy,
the little boy was him!!! Then he had left as he had came in, but over
the next few days of this, he had came and did the same thing, he was letting
me know little clues about this house that had plauge me, but on the last
day of his vist, and the same thing his hand over my head, and i saw that
same man, as days before.....but only older, he was telling me that he
was my great great grandfather, and that house that i had visted, was a
house that i indeed had visted, only years before, when i too was child,
my grandfather took me to this house, I guess he was showing me where his
father and his father before him grew up at, although i dont remember anything
of this house, but i do go up this house every once in awhile to vist my
special friend.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Kettle</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Y2JxxFoley@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My friends sister in law has had alot of weird experiences in her
house, and so have other people who have been there. Im not going to go
into detail about them but Im just going to list a few, before she got
her second dog, Harvey, the first one she had always used to run into the
computer room in the middle of the night and just stand there barking,
and when she got her other dog Max he also did the same but instead it
was in the kitchen. My friends mum was helping clean up there one day and
he heard someone scream in her ear, but when she went downstairs her nephew
was the only one there and he hadnt heard anything. Also my friends sister
in law saw the shadow of a man out of the corner of her eye, and sometimes
the kettle turns itself on and off. One time I slept there for two nights
and I never noticed anything, I was even walking round the house in the
pitch black dark to find the dog and still I never noticed anything. But
recently she put the house up for sale because of all the goings on and
me, my friend and her sister in law were going into town that morning but
first there was a man coming to value the house so we went and sat there
for fifteen minutes. The man was just talking to her about the house etc
when we heard this sort of dragging sound and it sounded like the kettle
boiling also, but we didnt say anything, just looked at eachother and waited
to see if the man would notice but he either didnt or didnt want to say
anything. When he had gone we were just heading out the door and we looked
into the kitchen to see that the kettle had been dragged right forward
to the edge of the counter, whether it had boiled or not I dont know because
none of us dared go into the kitchen to see!</B>

<BR><B>The House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ProutyS452@Cobleskill.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>My mother, brother, sister and I moved into an old farm house in
Cambridge, NY in 1995 with the intentions of refinishing parts of the house
to make it more modern, to give you an idea of the house it was built in
1884, had four floors which consisted of a basement, first floor, second
floor and a full attic, above the attic their was a widows peek and access
was through the attic by a flight of stairs. Strange things started happening
that everyone just brushed off the first week. Every night at 7:00 pm on
the dot the house would fill with the smell of cigar smoke (no body in
the house smoked cigars), we could hear voices of adults up stairs and
people running around, when we went up no one was their, we heard knocking
on the walls all hours of the day and night, people were heard whispering,
it would get intensely cold in the kitchen, and appliances would randomly
turn on and off. My sister was coming down the stairs when she looked to
be pushed from behind and luckily my mother was at the bottom and saw the
whole thing. My mother was never bothered at all, it seemed to target only
the children which were my sister 11, my brother 13 and I was 15. She did
hear things and she also felt things but never scared out of her mind.
One day my mother came to me and said she had to show me something, she
took me to the basement door and said watch, she opened the door and turned
the light switch off. Then she shut the door waited for a few seconds then
opened the door and the light was back on and the switch was up. We then
preceded to do this over and over again and the same thing occurred so
we duct taped the switch off. We left that night to visit family friends
and when we returned every light in the house was on even the basement
where it looked like someone tore the duct tape from the wall. We left
the light on from then on. Everyone in the house had scene shadows and
felt presence but my brother was the one who saw and felt the most. One
day he was home alone and said he saw three men in the back yard digging
by the garden. He watched them for a few moments, when one of them looked
up at him and all three of them disappeared. He said the men looked as
real as he did, he woke up one morning with three scratch marks down the
front of his chest and he said he didn't feel it nor did he wake up during
the night. My closet doors in my bed room one night rattled uncontrollable
while I was trying to sleep, this creeped me out so bad I refused to sleep
or even go into the room. The room became an un used office and me and
my sister opted to share a room. My sister said she felt something watch
her whenever she was in the bathroom and on one occasion she said the shower
curtain whipped open, I do believe her because she ran out of the shower
screaming and straight onto the front porch.&nbsp; We found out that the
house was part of the underground railroad when we herd a man to do some
remodeling and found that the size of the basement did not fit the size
of the house. A wall in the basement was torn down to find a small room.
When research was done on the house it was found that it was also an underground
bar during prohabition. Many, many people lived in that house and also
passed away in the house. A women by the name of Anne Douglas hung herself
in what was my bedroom. And we also know that their was a shooting outside
of the house around where my brother saw the three men. Their were so many
incidences but to long to tell all of them. We lived in that house for
five months before selling it and moving out. We have heard people scene
have only stayed a very short time before moving out, the house is currently
vacant... I wonder why?</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Chase</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kobokahn@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I have been an affluent reader of your web site since it's
infancy</B>
<BR><B>and have followed it through to today. Even though I have followed
this web</B>
<BR><B>site and literally read all the stories you have to offer I never
had the</B>
<BR><B>courage to submit one of my own; until now. I have been around the
world of</B>
<BR><B>the supernatural since I was a child so for me seeing or hearing
things out</B>
<BR><B>of the ordinary are common place. I have experienced hauntings,
poltergeists</B>
<BR><B>and even seen and spoken to spirits. Many people out in our world
are non</B>
<BR><B>believers, because they do not want to believe that anything can
exist</B>
<BR><B>outside of their conception of what they believe to be reality.
But what if</B>
<BR><B>it does exist?, what if there is a world of supernatural entities
that</B>
<BR><B>co-exist in our world and interact between the two realms from time
to time?</B>
<BR><B>Will you be a believer then? My story is an account that was given
to us</B>
<BR><B>from our brother, who this horrifying experience happened to, it
took place</B>
<BR><B>in a city suburbs in NJ where my parents lived at the time.It was
the summer</B>
<BR><B>of 1978 and my brother who was 16 at the time had gone out to visit
his</B>
<BR><B>girlfriend who lived nearby. I will try to give you a mental picture
because</B>
<BR><B>it is very important for you to understand and follow the events
that took</B>
<BR><B>place. Picture a city street with houses on both sides, our house
was</B>
<BR><B>located towards the middle of the block. Now picture walking to
the corner</B>
<BR><B>turning right and seeing a long stretch of city blocks, some with
few houses</B>
<BR><B>and some with empty lots. My brother had to walk six blocks up and
three</B>
<BR><B>blocks right passing an elementary school to reach her house which
was</B>
<BR><B>across the street from the school. He left our house around five,
it was</B>
<BR><B>summer time so he told my mother that he was going to be in late.
My mother</B>
<BR><B>told him not to be in too late and with that he left. He told us
that he</B>
<BR><B>left his girlfriend's house a little after midnight and was heading
straight</B>
<BR><B>home before he got in more trouble for being out so late. He said
that as he</B>
<BR><B>was passing the school yard of the school the temperature seemed
to drop to</B>
<BR><B>below freezing. He thought it was odd for the temperature to drop
this cold</B>
<BR><B>on a summer night even at that hour. He then said he saw what appeared
to be</B>
<BR><B>a man in a long trench coat with a hat that resembled the hats used
by the</B>
<BR><B>old private detective movies walking towards him. He said that he
would of</B>
<BR><B>though nothing of it since he was on a city suburb block and people
are out</B>
<BR><B>at this hour, but there were a couple of things that were wrong.
The</B>
<BR><B>temperature had dropped drastically, there were no cars driving
by anywhere,</B>
<BR><B>and no one but my brother and the man in the trench coat were in
out in the</B>
<BR><B>street. He said as the man in the trench coat got nearer he noticed</B>
<BR><B>something very wrong, the man in the trench coat was a least seven
feet</B>
<BR><B>tall! he also noticed that the trench coat and hat completely covered
any</B>
<BR><B>visible features of his body and he seemed to be floating instead
of walking</B>
<BR><B>because he didn't see any movement that we do when we walk. My brothers</B>
<BR><B>heart started to pound furiously as his adrenalin was shifted into</B>
<BR><B>overdrive. As he passed the trench coat man he nodded to him as
to say</B>
<BR><B>"what's up" to show that he was "cool" and not afraid of him but
deep inside</B>
<BR><B>he knew that he was terrified. He said that the trench coat man
slowly</B>
<BR><B>nodded back at him as he passed by. My brother said that as he passed
him he</B>
<BR><B>could smell something burnt or like sulfur. He then started to walk
very</B>
<BR><B>fast and the only thing on his mind was to get home fast. As he
was quickly</B>
<BR><B>walking down the street he turned his head back to see where the
man in the</B>
<BR><B>trench coat was and to his horror the man in the trench coat was
following</B>
<BR><B>him! My brother started to walk even faster and was horrified beyond
belief</B>
<BR><B>by this point. He again turned to see where the man was and he was
getting</B>
<BR><B>closer at a very fast rate. So then my brother out of desperation
went out</B>
<BR><B>to the middle of the street turned around threw his arms out and
yelled at</B>
<BR><B>the man "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT? WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? at
this the</B>
<BR><B>man stopped he was about half a block away from my brother then
the most</B>
<BR><B>terrifying thing happened. All the street lights on the block went
out! So</B>
<BR><B>my brother is standing in the middle of a pitch black street with
a seven</B>
<BR><B>foot tall man in a trench coat in the middle of the night. He said
his heart</B>
<BR><B>almost stopped as the man in the trench coat lifted his head to
reveal two</B>
<BR><B>of the most evil glowing red eyes my brother ever had seen, at this
point</B>
<BR><B>the man lunged in a furious sprint towards my brother. My brother
seeing</B>
<BR><B>this took of like a bat out of hell. He was two blocks away from
our house</B>
<BR><B>and he said as he got near to any street light it would go out leaving
him</B>
<BR><B>enveloped in darkness. He said that as he was running he could hear
heavy</B>
<BR><B>footsteps hitting the concrete and the sound of something very big
panting</B>
<BR><B>and growling heavily. He turned his head briefly to see where that
thing</B>
<BR><B>that was chasing him was at and he saw that it was very near the
only thing</B>
<BR><B>that he could see clearly was it's evil glowing red eyes. my brother
rounded</B>
<BR><B>the corner and was at a full sprint to our house. He leapt on to
the porch</B>
<BR><B>and started banging on the door and screaming for my mother to open
the</B>
<BR><B>door. luckily for him that my mother was waiting up for him watching
tv in</B>
<BR><B>the living in the living room waiting for my brother to walk in
so she could</B>
<BR><B>scold him for coming in do late. He then said the man in the trench
coat was</B>
<BR><B>slowly gliding towards him down the block and was now only two house
lengths</B>
<BR><B>away from him. My brother continued to pound furiously and scream
for my</B>
<BR><B>mother to open the door. he looked back again and this time the
man in the</B>
<BR><B>trench coat was at the foot of the steps to the porch of our house
only a</B>
<BR><B>few feet away from my brother. My brother froze and thought "Oh
my God this</B>
<BR><B>is it he's going to get me" when the door flung open and my mother
was</B>
<BR><B>yelling to my brother "what the hell is wrong with you making such
a ruckus</B>
<BR><B>at this hour" my brother pushed her in and slammed the door shut.
My mother</B>
<BR><B>seeing that he was terrified beyond belief forgot about the scolding
and</B>
<BR><B>frantically asked him what was wrong was he o.k. he told my mother
that</B>
<BR><B>something was chasing him for many blocks and that it wasn't a man,
that it</B>
<BR><B>wasn't human at all and that it almost got him and now was standing
at the</B>
<BR><B>foot of the steps. My mother said "what are you talking about and
went to</B>
<BR><B>one of our living room windows which faced the front of the house
with my</B>
<BR><B>brother and opened the curtain, there in front of them standing
at the foot</B>
<BR><B>of the steps were my brother had seen him last was the man in the
trench</B>
<BR><B>coat staring back at them with it's evil glowing eyes. My mother
was</B>
<BR><B>frightened but being very religious started to say a very old but
powerful</B>
<BR><B>prayer. With that the Man stood there for a few seconds fixed his
hat to</B>
<BR><B>conceal his face again turned back and floated back from were he
came from</B>
<BR><B>never to be seen by my brother or mother again. My brother never
even dared</B>
<BR><B>to be outside at night for a very long time after that. This is
the account</B>
<BR><B>as it's said by my brother and I believe it to be true not only
from my</B>
<BR><B>brother having scratch marks which went through his T-shirt and
scratched</B>
<BR><B>his back like it was reaching to try to get him but was missing
him, but</B>

<BR><B>The Bird</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Joannshimola@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I leave for work early each morning while is still dark.&nbsp; Although
now with summer coming, it is somewhat lighter as the sun is starting to
rise.&nbsp; I travel a short distance to work and go down a small hill
which passes a golf course,&nbsp; This particular morning a large black
bird came from off the golf course in front of my car.&nbsp; It did not
fly as a normal bird.&nbsp; Its wings did not flap but seemed to remain
outstretched behind its body.&nbsp; It did not gain altitude and I had
to break as I feared I would hit it.&nbsp; It led with its head and feet
outstretched.&nbsp; It flew slowly past the front of my car heading to
a tree on the other side of the road.&nbsp; It did not seem natural at
all as it reached out toward the trunk of the tree with its talons instead
of roosting in a branch.&nbsp; I felt fear as I watched this strange bird.&nbsp;
Later that day at my work, there was a murder/suicide.&nbsp; The first
thing that crossed my mind was the strange flight of that scary large black
bird.&nbsp; It was like it foretold of a horrible disaster that was to
unfold that day.</B>

<BR><B>Tennessee Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MelodyMRH@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>December 26, 1999, I had just moved to Tennessee, 24 days later the
house I moved into burned to the ground with everything I had in my life,
but that's another story.&nbsp; My new husband and I rented a house for
six months in Clarksville, TN. It was fairly new subdivision the houses
sat on about 3/4 acre lots in a very hilly wooded area. After moving in
with what little we had, we were sitting in the kitchen talking and I heard
two thumps, we didn't really think about it until the thumps became more
than just two.&nbsp; It was coming from the attic. Now this was a fairly
new house (5 years old). We went up to the Attic and it was as clean as
if it were brand new, so we just thought well maybe a squirrel. It got
worse, it was like someone in the attic was just making this noise, like
the sound of walking and stomping. I even had my husband nail the entrance
to the attic shut, and slept with the bedroom door locked, like that would
help, it did help a little because I wasn't getting any sleep. One day
when my husband was at work, I was sitting on the couch and it was in the
middle of the day, the sunlight was coming through the windows, I remember
I had them open and we had such a nice breeze blowing through for July
and it was rather quiet, but all of a sudden I got this perfect visual
(I have had warnings with visuals in my lifetime but not like this).&nbsp;
It was a girl with short dark hair, dressed in seventies style clothes,
I don't know why I think seventies that's just want came to me at the time,
lying on the floor with one arm above her head the other acrossed her chest
and her neck was bloody, like her neck had been slashed, the feeling I
had, I knew she was dead.&nbsp; The stomping got worse after that and would
follow you wherever you would go in the house and always coming from the
attic.&nbsp; It was frightening. We had planned on driving to Eastern Kentucky
on a Friday.&nbsp; I came home around noon from my husband's office to
pack so we could leave early afternoon.&nbsp; While I was at the house
I packed as fast as I could, because by now I hated being in the house
alone.&nbsp; As I had packed the last of whatever I was taking, I walked
from the bedroom across the living room to the front door and as I did
the stomping went right with me right to the front door as if it was furious
with me, it was very loud. I couldn't wait to get out of there.&nbsp; While
we were in Eastern Kentucky, my husband, at that time, was and is a Chaplain
and knew some folks in Korea.&nbsp; He called someone on prayer mountain
and they told us what to do and said that they would have prayers for this
house.&nbsp; Prior to going back to the house we had stopped first and
purchased as many crosses as we could and hung them in every room and laid
hands on the walls and prayed for this house. After that there was no noise,
no stomping, it was like it had just gone away. We moved out shortly after
that.</B>
<BR><B>After we had moved out of that house I wanted so bad to talk to
the Realtor (Cherokee Properties) who had rented the house to us to ask
if anyone had a problem there before, but I was hesitant and didn't. I
had often thought of going to the police to check out if anything had every
happened out in that area, but I didn't' want to draw any attention.</B>
<BR><B>I have since moved back to Florida and I still wonder about this.&nbsp;
I thought at one time that maybe someone had died on that property before
the house was built, or while the house was being built and this spirit
was calling out to me for help. But then why would it be so mean in the
stomping to scare us.&nbsp; The address of this house is 356 Deepwood Trail,
I'll never forget that address or Clarksville, TN for that matter.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for reading, I have always wanted to tell someone about this,
now I have.</B>

<BR><B>Room 207</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:PatnConnie99@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I work at the Days Inn by the airport in Colorado Springs,
Co. I am almost positive we have a ghost occupying one of our rooms. I
was taking a picture of the hotel for our website and brochure and had
downloaded the images to the computer behind the front desk. The hotel
facade has a few flaws (cracks here and there) so I thought I'd mask them
with a photoshop type program. To get a better idea where the flaws were
I made a negative copy of the picture to see what needed to be fixed. I
zoomed in on a small crack in the stucco on the second floor one room over
from the lobby area. I zoomed back out to see how large this was and happened
to look at the glass in the window of room 207. There appeared to be an
elderly genleman looking out at me. I showed this picture to a few co-workers
and most of them agreed that there was someone looking out at me. Unfortunately
now housekeeping won't even clean that room if for some reason it gets
rented. I have a few pictures from inside that room that I will be sending
as soon as I can remember where I put the disks. One pic is taken from
directly outside the door and has an orb, the next is inside the room and
has what I can only describe as a floating worm light.&nbsp; I suspect
"Henry" (well, he's got to have a name) just likes it up there because
it's peaceful. A few guests have complained about chills or a bumping noise
but nothing more than that. Still, it would really be nice to find out
for certain just what is going on up there. What I find funny is that I
had to have one of my friends (and co-workers) go uo there with me just
so I could take the pictures. I'm a 6'2 240 lb male and she's 6'0 and weighs
about 115. What kind of a chicken am I? Oh well, better to be safe than
sorry. If any pro ghost hunters happen to be in the area and want to check
it out drop me a line, I'll give you a good rate. I just remembered something
that happened to one of the girls that works here. Shortly after I showed
her the pictures of 207 she went up there (by herself) looked around and
then sat on the bed, The smoke detector was directly above her and fell
giving her a small lump and a BIG scare. I guess he doesn't like her too
much. Ah, one other thing, just this morning I heard some tapping upstairs.
There is no one on the second floor right now. I only have 5 people in
house and they are all at the end of the hallway on the first floor. Maybe
Henry doesn't like getting publicity.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Apartment Spirit</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: diana@loadedimage.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I stumbled upon your site a few months back and have read most of
the stories posted here.</B>
<BR><B>I'm not sure how to classify mine, i suppose it is a haunting only
the spirit does not scare me, merely makes me a little nervous as the feeling
of being watched by unknown eyes can do that to a person.</B>
<BR><B>I have lived in my present apartment for almost 4 years and from
the beginning i suspected that i was not living alone.&nbsp; It was little
things at first.&nbsp; I have hanging glass beads which separate my living
room from my entrance hallway, i keep them tied open as they are heavy
and make allot of noise when you walked through them and would swing for
several minutes before slowly coming to a stop, so in order to keep them
safe from falling from the ceiling they stay tied open.</B>
<BR><B>I would leave the house for work in the morning only to return that
evening to find them untied, i would tie them and again united when i returned,
this went on for only a brief period at which point, i shouted in my apartment
to no one in particular to please stop untying them, and they have stayed
open since.</B>
<BR><B>After 2 years in the apartment i got a dog, a cute Jack Russell,
friendly with people and dogs alike.&nbsp; The following has happened randomly
over the last 2 years only at night.&nbsp; When i go to bed she comes to
bed with me, she isn't a dog that is restless and not wanting to sleep
when it is time.&nbsp; On several occasions (no pattern other than night
time) she has woken me from a dead sleep whining and pacing my apartment
in and out of my bedroom sometimes circling my bed, it has taken up to
30 minutes to calm her down. All the fur has been standing up on her back
and she paces like she is tracking something or following it throughout
my apartment, this behavior is what i find frightening because there is
nothing visible to my eyes nor any sounds the are audible to my ears..so
what is she seeing or hearing?</B>
<BR><B>Up until recently i have only felt the presence of someone else
in my apartment, and i have always know it was a male presence, not sure
why i just know it is male.&nbsp; I find myself watching television with
my back to the living room entrance and feel eyes on me, i turn and nothing
the dog will actually look when i do as well, I've been in the shower and
felt a breeze run through the bathroom even though the door is shut and
there are no vents for air to flow through.</B>
<BR><B>Within the last month i believe i have seen the entity.&nbsp; My
first experience i was in bed with my boyfriend, I looked up at the ceiling
at one point and saw a man looking at me from above my bed, i felt like
i made actual eye contact with him, he had a curious expression on his
face as to say "what are you doing"?.&nbsp; I was definitely startled by
this and shook my head and closed my eyes for a brief second, he was gone
when i opened my eyes again.&nbsp; The next time i saw him, was about a
week to 10 days later, i was in the bathroom getting ready to go out for
the evening.&nbsp; I was applying makeup in the mirror, the mirror is in
three sections and behind each section are shelves, so the mirrors are
doors and can be moved open and closed, i angle the 2 outside mirrors in
slightly to apply make-up.&nbsp; As i was doing so, i saw out of the corner
of my eye a man standing in my hallway half way behind a wall and half
way in the door way..just watching me, when i turned he was gone.&nbsp;
The was almost 2 weeks ago and nothing since, but i am moving out at the
months end, to the suite next door to me...maybe he will follow...</B><B></B>

<P><B>Phantom Hitchhiker</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Hogroddy@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>my name is Harvey, i grew up in a small western Okla. town, in the
sixties. normal enough in soppose.but after i was grown and living there
on my own for a while i was headed out of town going north on state hiway
183 when i see this guy hitching, now i usually don't pick up hitchhikers
but this guy looked clean cut and all so i pulled over. he ran up to the
car, got in. i asked him where he was headed. he told me that it was important
that he get to his wife on further down the road a ways. i say OK just
tell me where to stop. so we take off. i try to be sociable and have a
conversation with him. we talked about life in general and he always seemed
to steer the conversation back to the same thing and that is that death
is not permanent and that the grave is a cold lonely place. well i agreed
in general, cause i was thinking that this guy had some inner issues that
i didn't want to have come out in a bad way right? so i humored him along,
when he saw we were approaching a local cemetary,he wanted me to pull over,
i was thinking ''yeah this guy wants my car and guess what the cemetery
will be my last stop, but i pulled over just the same, i wanted to get
rid of this guy ASAP anyway.but he just sat there for a minute not saying
anything then he said''my wife wandered off one day and i just have to
check with friends to see if they had seen her'' OK, no problem, but why
here, well he said that him and his wife ''lived'' close by. then he didn't
say anything, but got out of the car, walked off into the cemetery, i was
watching him go from row to row, then he would stop, look down at the headstone
i thought,acting like he was listening, kind of shake his head then move
on, well i got bored, looked off to check the scenery in the distance,
looked back and he was gone. i got out of the car and looked out across
the cemetary,he was no where in sight, but i did see the caretakers preparing
a grave site on down a ways. i went and asked them if they had seen this
guy, and they told me what guy that they had thought i was having car trouble
or something, because i had pulled over by my self.and just sat there,that
they were about ready to come and ask if i needed assistance, when i got
out of my car and walked their way.the guy in charge says''well mister,this
sort of thing has happened before out here so i guess there must be something
to it'' i described the guy, and the chief caretaker or whoever said ''yep,
its the same guy we hear about from others too, he was looking for his
wife or something like that, right?'' well, that just blew me away, i mean
what could i say? i just said yeah, well see ya later and left. now, what
do you think about that?</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Haunted Room</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: johnbecphoebe@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a teenager I had some unexplained occurrences
in my room.&nbsp; On one occasion I was writing on my bed when the window
shade lifted itself up and slammed against the window. The windows were
not open.&nbsp; I even tried lifting the shade up and pushing on it but
it would waft down, not slam. Another time I was on the phone when I felt
a cold breeze. I told my friend on the phone the dog must have opened up
the backdoor downstairs and that I'd be right back after I'd closed it.&nbsp;
Downstairs, the dog was sound asleep.&nbsp; Another time I was listening
to my tape player when it shut off by itself. The counter on the player
read '666'.&nbsp; The most disturbing thing happened twice in two separate
years.&nbsp; I awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of breathing.&nbsp;
I turned on the light thinking it was my cat.&nbsp; Well the cat was absolutely
terrified by whatever it was and slipped and slid trying to get out of
the room.&nbsp; My mother told me to go back to sleep.&nbsp; So I did!&nbsp;
A about a year later I woke up in the middle of the night and heard the
deep breathing.&nbsp; This time I made my mother get up and come in.&nbsp;
She heard it too!&nbsp; We looked all over the room for the source- a cat,
the wind, a person hiding-but found nothing. The breathing seemed to be
coming from everywhere and nowhere.&nbsp; Then it took a big long sigh
and stopped for a few seconds.&nbsp; When it resumed again my mom asked
in a scared voice "Do you want to sleep in my room?"&nbsp; I said no, because
it hadn't hurt me before.&nbsp; I have no idea what was causing those strange
occurrences, and have not lived there for many years.&nbsp; Sometimes I
think I will knock on the door to my old house and ask the current owner
"Do you hear breathing?" but I figure they might think I'm wacko so I never
have.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Have I got a Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Greebochik@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My house is haunted by somthing, someone, it's never really bothered
me. It's nothing big, doors opening, radio turning on and off by itself,
footsteps, floorboards quake, noises in the attic but as i said it never
really bothered me until about 4months ago.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I always wake up in the middle of the night but One night
i woke up around 2.30am to a tight feeling in my chest, it wasnt so much
tight as it was heavy, like a weight or somthing, but it wasn't all that.
After a while i couldnt get back to sleep so i tried to turned to put my
t.v on only to find i couldn't move. When i tried to sit up from a glass
of water the weight on my chest got heavier, it was like someone was sitting
on me, like a child, not moving just a weight. i tried to arch my back
and the weight got heavier and i couldn't breath, i really started to panic
and sweat. i was really scared to i started to cry a little because i didnt
know what to do. then all of a sudden i felt a slight pinching on my right
elbow and thats the last i can remember, i woke up the next morning feeling
fine, just as i did the day before, although i had a red mark where i felt
the pinch.</B>
<BR><B>i dont under why on earth the ghost in my house would be sitting
on me.Nothing has happened since besides the normal and a extra thing has
started. in the bathroom we have a pully light switch and a hanging moblie
and when your in the shower the light switch will start to swing followed
by the moblie when there it no breeze whats so ever. i know it sounds stupid
but i swear it really happened.</B>

<BR><B>Happening House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shaneekababy@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is Shayla and I have an experience that happened to me
when I was about 11 or 12 years old.</B>
<BR><B>I lived in a house in Springfield, Oregon</B>
<BR><B>and even though I never had any proof (well atleast at that time),
I could never prove that my theory that it was haunted was true.</B>
<BR><B>One night around 11:00-12:00 aclock at night I woke up...just out
of the blue, there was no reasoning for it but I just woke up and I looked
over at my open door and standing in the hallway was a black silouhette
of a woman.. Even though I could not see any features except for her curves
and the outline of her hair I could tell that she was staring straight
at me and the feeling I had was extremely "bad". Immediately without screaming
or doing anything I buried my head in my pillow and squeezed my eyes shut.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning I had questioned my mom and everyone else that
was in the house that night asking them if they had been standing outside
my door that night and they all confirmed that they had not. I told my
mom about what had happened also and she acceptingly believed me but still
needed to see it with her own eyes.</B>
<BR><B>Things after that started happening more rapidly and frequently.</B>
<BR><B>One of the things that quickly followed that happening was a couple
of nights later I woke up in the middle of the night again and heard "stirring"
in the kitchen like someone clinking a spoon against a teacup in a "stirring"
fashion. I thought my mom was up for tea due to lack of sleep or something
like that but as I got closer to the kitchen the stirring would cease.
I got close enough to the point where all I had to do was turn the corner
to actually "be" in the kitchen, but at that point the stirring stopped
so I went back to bed confused and feeling eerie.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning I again questioned everyone asking them if they
had been in the kitchen at all the night before and again very seriously
they replied that they had not. I then proceeded to enter the kitchen and
to my surprise there was a tea cup and spoon on the counter. The spoon
was wet with something but there was nothing whatsoever in the cup.</B>
<BR><B>About a week after that there was an incident where I was in the
"guest room" which is a seperate room built on the opposite side of the
garage and my friend and I were sitting and joking on a mattress that was
casually thrown on the floor. We paused in conversation for a second, right
then there was gradual pressure on the mattress as if someone was slowly
sitting down. Both of us were scared out of our minds so we quickly left
and didnt go back in for a few weeks.</B>
<BR><B>However, later that week my mom was leaving the guest room (you
must enter the garage in order to do so) and as she shut the door of the
guest room there was a huge bang as if someone was pounding on the door
feverishly. She went back in the room to see if someone was in there or
hiding in there but no one was. Scaring my mom half to death she called
me out to the garage to open and shut the door several times and I even
slammed it a few times but nothing happened. She then told me about the
happening and we both stayed away for a while.</B>
<BR><B>In addition to all that there were footsteps, random footsteps and
the feeling like you were constantly being watched.</B>
<BR><B>Well, that's my experience I hope you "enjoyed" it!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Casper the Friendly Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kaygran@comcast.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had some stange things happen to me over the years. The first
one was when I was about 6 years old. We lived in West Tennessee. My parents,my
2 brothers and me where out looking a houses to rent. We went into this
one house and in th eback bedroom you could hear a baby cry and see it
in a crib in the corner of the room.We left that house and never went back.
We later found out that a baby had died in that room of "crib death"</B>
<BR><B>A another thing that happened was in 1986. My youngest brother was
murdered by a young punk. About a month after the funeral I was at home
and feel asleep on the couch. I woke up with the feeling that someone was
watching me.I looked over at the chair and there set my brother. He was
in the clothes that we had buried him in. He told me to take care of our
mother and that he would always be with us and that he loved us very much.</B>
<BR><B>The next thing happened about thirteen years ago. I met my husband
and moved into his house. I found out that his father died in the living
room 6 years early. I would hear noises at night but would dismiss them
because the house is a old house. My husband said that it was Casper the
friendly ghost.I thought yeah right. Well one day everybody had left home
to do different things. It was in January and we had the termastat set
on 72 degrees. We came home and the house was so hot. someone had turned
the heat up as high as it would go and unplugged the phone. I found out
that my husbands father had bad circulation in his legs and was always
cold and that he hated a telephone. So I guess that would explain alot.I
would hear noises in the attic late at night and I got to the point where
I would say ok that is enough&nbsp; it is time to go to bed and the noise
would stop. I have went into the attic and moved things around where I
would know where everything was and that night there would be alot of noise
in the attic and the next day everything would be moved back like it was.
I guess my father -in-law did not like the way I changed things.I finally
realized that we really do have Casper the Friendly Ghost.</B><B></B>

<P><B>2 True Experiences</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Aabel4@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I had many paranormal experiences when I was young.&nbsp; As I grew
older I</B>
<BR><B>dismissed them as the fantasy of the young mind.&nbsp; As I grew
older they became less.</B>
<BR><B>But 2 (as an adult) stand out in my mind..one happened when I was
Germany and</B>
<BR><B>the other didn't happen to me.</B>
<BR><B>The first was when I was in Mitgenfeld, GE, I was about 23 years
old.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>new to the country (military) and looking for a place to rent.&nbsp;
We (my ex {and</B>
<BR><B>athiest} and I) found one. Our apartment was on the 2nd floor the
landlord</B>
<BR><B>lived on the first and there was an attic.&nbsp; The first night
we stayed there I</B>
<BR><B>had a dream about a person named Caleb.&nbsp; I could not see his
face, all I could</B>
<BR><B>see was a shadow behind curtains.&nbsp; He was asking my ex to come
with him and I</B>
<BR><B>kept saying no.&nbsp; I had the dream several nights but I never
told my ex my</B>
<BR><B>dream.&nbsp; About 1 month after we moved in I started experiencing
phenomena.&nbsp; We had a</B>
<BR><B>bathroom with a skylight, I had this unnerving feeling someone was
looking at</B>
<BR><B>me while I bathed (keep in mind that this was an old German house
and showers</B>
<BR><B>are hard to come by).&nbsp; I also had the feeling of being watched
when I went</B>
<BR><B>into the kitchen.&nbsp; Several months passed by and winter came.&nbsp;
We had alot of</B>
<BR><B>snow and it was piling up.&nbsp; One day I was in the living room,
when I heard this</B>
<BR><B>sound in the attic like someone was dragging something across the
attic.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>dismissed it as snow piling up on the roof and falling.&nbsp; The
only problem was the</B>
<BR><B>snow really was falling north to south (roof pitch) and the sound
I was</B>
<BR><B>hearing was from east to west!&nbsp; I ignored it for about 2 weeks
and the sound got so</B>
<BR><B>loud that I had to leave.&nbsp; My ex found me sitting on the landing
one day and</B>
<BR><B>asked me what the problem was.&nbsp; I told him what I was hearing
and he laughed</B>
<BR><B>and told me it was the snow falling off the roof. I told myself
(giggling)</B>
<BR><B>"your losing it".&nbsp; Several days went by and I kept hearing
this sound, I did</B>
<BR><B>ignore it, but one day I tried to lay down on the couch when I heard
this loud</B>
<BR><B>**SIGH** next to me.&nbsp; I left the apartment again.&nbsp; But
one night we had a party</B>
<BR><B>and my ex told people that I was hearing things.&nbsp; They laughed
and I was</B>
<BR><B>embarrassed but I told them open the attic door (which was between
the bathroom and</B>
<BR><B>kitchen) and see what was up there.&nbsp; They did and everyone
stopped laughing.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>didn't really want to see what was up there but then again I did.&nbsp;
My ex told</B>
<BR><B>me there was nothing up there but old "rags".&nbsp; He tried to
persuade me from</B>
<BR><B>looking but I wanted to see for myself so I climbed up the stairs
and looked in</B>
<BR><B>the attic.&nbsp; What I saw took my breath away.&nbsp; There was
old black German baby</B>
<BR><B>buggy sitting up there.&nbsp; It was full of cobwebs and someone
pushed it and I</B>
<BR><B>knew what that dragging sound was.&nbsp; It made a distinct sound
that could be heard</B>
<BR><B>by everyone.&nbsp; I actually felt sick to my stomach.&nbsp; We
stayed there for about</B>
<BR><B>another month and nothing happened.&nbsp; Then one night we laid
down to go to</B>
<BR><B>sleep when I heard this knocking on the wall above us.&nbsp; Three
knocks.&nbsp; I asked my</B>
<BR><B>ex if he had heard that and this is what he said "I'm going to tell
you I</B>
<BR><B>didn't but I did".&nbsp; Well it was about 2 weeks after that when
my ex told me we</B>
<BR><B>were moving.&nbsp; I didn't know it but he was looking for another
place.&nbsp; No</B>
<BR><B>explanations we were just moving.&nbsp; As we were moving I asked
him why and all he said</B>
<BR><B>was "lets leave this place".&nbsp; I asked him why and he got really
mad and told me</B>
<BR><B>we were just moving.&nbsp; Well we moved and about 6 months later
I asked him why</B>
<BR><B>we moved and he told me that he looked up to the kitchen window
and there was</B>
<BR><B>a man looking down at us. I know there was nobody left in there
because I was</B>
<BR><B>the last person to leave.&nbsp; He also told me he was experiencing
the same things</B>
<BR><B>I was but wouldn't tell me because he was afraid to scare me. Keep
in mind my</B>
<BR><B>ex was an athiest.&nbsp; I felt chills go down my body...</B>
<BR><B>The next one didn't happen to me it happened to my husband.&nbsp;
Keep in mind</B>
<BR><B>that he is a Gulf War Vet with over 20 years active duty military.&nbsp;
Brooke Army</B>
<BR><B>Medical Hospital, San Antonio Tx.&nbsp; Where it stands now is not
where it used to</B>
<BR><B>be.&nbsp; You actually have to go on post to see the real hospital.&nbsp;
It was</B>
<BR><B>abandoned many years ago.&nbsp; It is barricaded off but I would
like to hear more about</B>
<BR><B>this building.&nbsp; My husband went for training last year (he's
a reservist now).</B>
<BR><B>He stayed in a hotel across from the abandoned building.&nbsp; After
a few days he</B>
<BR><B>was there he called me and told me he couldn't sleep in this haunted
hotel.</B>
<BR><B>He stated he woke up several times to find his "stuff" from his
closet strown</B>
<BR><B>across the floor.&nbsp; He also said his closet was extremely cold.&nbsp;
He also told</B>
<BR><B>me that were roaches as big as tanks!!! (laughing).&nbsp; I laughed
most of it off</B>
<BR><B>until I went there.&nbsp; He told me that several soldiers complained
about the</B>
<BR><B>"things" happening to them but no one believes them.</B>
<BR><B>Well I didn't believe him until he drove me by the old hospital
and it looked</B>
<BR><B>like an abandoned building.&nbsp; Barbed wire and chains with locks.&nbsp;
After a few</B>
<BR><B>passes by the hospital, he told me I had to see the hotel.&nbsp;
He got me into the</B>
<BR><B>hotel pretending I was a soldier (I felt more like a prostitute
the way the</B>
<BR><B>CQ looked at me).&nbsp; I will tell you this place looks as if you
stepped into the</B>
<BR><B>30's.&nbsp; I swear they haven't changed the wallpaper since then.&nbsp;
He kept telling</B>
<BR><B>me that when he looked out his window the hospital would have lights
on and</B>
<BR><B>windows open (keep in mind this is an abandoned building).&nbsp;
He took me to the</B>
<BR><B>room he stayed in and yes the whole room was cold.&nbsp; I could
see the hospital</B>
<BR><B>from the window and no lights.&nbsp; When we left I looked up at
the hospital and I</B>
<BR><B>saw a room with lights on and a window open.&nbsp; I got the "creeps".&nbsp;
As we were</B>
<BR><B>leaving he drove closer to it and there is no way anyone could have
gotten in</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; Has any soldier every stayed in the hotel across from
the old Brooke</B>
<BR><B>Army Medical Hospital?&nbsp; What experiences did you have?</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Cat Before</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: baf4baf@charter.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When my husband and I moved into our&nbsp; house, We didn't yet ahve
a bed,</B>
<BR><B>so we slept in the Living Room on a hide a bed. Well , for the first</B>
<BR><B>week we were in this house, we would wake up every morning and the</B>
<BR><B>burners on my kitchen stove would be full-blown lit!&nbsp; So I
had the stove</B>
<BR><B>itself checked out by a professional appliance repair man. Needless
to</B>
<BR><B>say, he , of course, could find nothing wrong!&nbsp; Then I JUST
HAPPENED to</B>
<BR><B>meet the people who lived here before we did.She told me about a
cat she</B>
<BR><B>had who had died in the house, and how it always used to jump up
on the</B>
<BR><B>stove, and how it would hit the burner switches when it would get
down,</B>
<BR><B>thereby igniting the burners. So, being a Native American, I decided
to</B>
<BR><B>do a cleansing ceremony, burn some sage, sweet grass, and yarrow,
while</B>
<BR><B>telling the spirit that while it was welcome here, I would appreciate
it</B>
<BR><B>very much if it would cease the dangerous activity, as I really
would</B>
<BR><B>prefer to not die in my bed from a fire. It never happened again!!!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, from time to time ,</B>
<BR><B>I&nbsp; will feel a cat rubbing against mylegs or a cat jumps up
on&nbsp; our bed.</B>
<BR><B>or I'll hear a scratching noise in the litter box, ( I have 3 cats</B>
<BR><B>myself) But when I go to look, My cats are asleep in another part
of the</B>
<BR><B>house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There hve also been instances</B>
<BR><B>where I have felt a hand touch my face in a loving caress , or a
hand</B>
<BR><B>shake my shoulder as though there were someone trying to wake me
from a</B>
<BR><B>sound sleep. I have been working late at night at my desk, studying
for</B>
<BR><B>my final exams or working on my genealogy and family history. Well,</B>
<BR><B>there was this one instance that I had just gotten off the phone
with an</B>
<BR><B>aunt I hadn't talked to in a long time, she had just told me that
she</B>
<BR><B>had some Paperwork she would send me to help me, I had hung up the</B>
<BR><B>phone, put my head down on my desk and started to cry. That's when
the</B>
<BR><B>lights flickered and went out, and I felt someone standing beside
me,</B>
<BR><B>leanover, put two arms around me and hug me very hard. Then the
lights</B>
<BR><B>flickered again, and came back on. The hair on the back of my neck
stood</B>
<BR><B>straight up,and it felt like the temperature in my room dropped
about</B>
<BR><B>twenty degrees!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For some reason, these</B>
<BR><B>encounters don't scare me, because I KNOW it's my Daddy who passed
in</B>
<BR><B>1980. come to encourage me in my efforts to trace our family.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There have also been</B>
<BR><B>instances where my cats will follow something across the room with
their</B>
<BR><B>eyes when there is plainly nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; (?) there. Or they'll&nbsp;
come up out</B>
<BR><B>of a deep sleep, go into a spitting, snarling fury, with every hair
on</B>
<BR><B>their body standing straight up , then they'll take off on a mad
dash</B>
<BR><B>through the house as if there's something or someone chasing them.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There've been other</B>
<BR><B>little things , not only in this house, but things that have happened
to</B>
<BR><B>me all my life. Like I said , I am Native American, My Grandfather
was a</B>
<BR><B>full-blood Cherokee medicine man. My Daddy used to tell me that
I was an</B>
<BR><B>awful lot like him. I guess I'm&nbsp; a lot more like him than I&nbsp;
or my Daddy</B>
<BR><B>ever realized!!!!!</B>

<P><B>My New House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Accumulated_smart_guy@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When i first moved into this house i felt kinda odd. My and my brothers
girlfriend where the first to witness this odd happenings.</B>
<BR><B>Me and my brothers girfriend were watchin a movie cuz my brother
whent to get some McDonalds for us so we were left home alone.</B>
<BR><B>i heard her name get called from the basement first so i wasnt sure
if i heard it or not but then it said it again and i said to her hey listen</B>
<BR><B>can u hear that soemone is callin ur name. it called her name again
this time with a little more louder voice. by this time we were both scared
to even go next to the basement stairs. it started to get closer and louder
with an angryer tone of voice so we got really frightend. as every time
it said her name louder and louder it got scaryer. the last time it yelled
her name my brother pulled into the driveway and it stoped. me and my bros
girfriend told my brother everything that happend as soon as he walked
into the door he didnt belive us though. i told my mom about it a week
later and that night as i was going to bed i looked at the head of my bed
and a person was standing there i couldnt tell who it was cuz the figure
was all black. i tried to lay down and not say anything cuz i wasnt really
sure if i was really seeing that. i started to daze off and have one of
them realalistic dreams as if someone was grabing my arm and lifting it
up in the air. i cam back to my self and my arm was straight up in the
air and fell to my bed as if someone one was holding it and let go.</B>
<BR><B>a couple months later i had one of my friends stay the night and
i told him about my ghost(spirit) and he didnt belive me he always laughed
at me untill that night. we were going to bed and he kept seeing someone
move infront of my doorway and he was telling me to get to bed (dan) my
friend was telling me and i was liek dude i am in bed. i could tell by
the sound of his voice that he was gettin frightend of what ever it was.
so i got outta my bed and turned on the ligjt. i was like dude lets go
get a drink or somthin. so we whent down stairs (when we left my closet
was closed and the door was opend) i got my drink and started to walk back
up the stairs with him behind me cuz he was scaired tehe the door close
slowly and we both looked at eachother as we both had goose bumps on eachother.</B>
<BR><B>i walked upstairs and opend my door and look at my closet and it
was open. about a week later my mom had a cd moved from behind a huge tv
stand. about a year has past now and nothin has happend since but a few
really small things. one morning my mom got up for work and there was a
messege on the answer machine. but she didnt bother gettting it so she
whent to&nbsp; the bathroom and when she came out she notice the messege
was erased. my moms ride was there by now and my mom left to get in the
car when she opend the door my moms friend was tappin the steering wheel
as if she seen somthin my mom asked her what was the matter and she said
she just saw somthin run into our wood (a black figure) and disapear. we
decided to play the ouija bored to talk to frank are ghost. i got to talk
to him and when i asked him to move a candle flame i felt somthin else

<BR><B>My Brother</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Latinaluvv@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Back in the summer of 1990 or 1991, I witnessed my first "ghost"
or "spirit" experience. My cousin and I was sitting outside with our backs
facing towards the front door. My Dad told us that he was leaving to go
wash clothes. I never turned around, I just told him "Bye." About 15 minutes
later, I had went inside to get my cousin and I something to drink. As
I walked into the kitchen, my brother was sitting at the table. I spoke
to him as of knowing nothing at that time. As I walked around in the kitchen,
I notice that my brother was just following my every move, my every step.
Yet, his eyes were the only thing moving. They were so big and wide eye,
like an owl. His head stayed in only one position. He reminded me of one
of those creepy pictures to where it looks like their eyes are following
you.</B>
<BR><B>I paid no attention, at first. I just kept on fixing our drinks.
Suddenly, my hairs on the back of my neck stood up and chills came over
me. I turned around and there sitting on the same chair, same way - he
sits. I came closer to ask what was wrong with him. Why, was he so quiet.
Why, was he so still. He did not breath a word. He did not make the slightest
movement. He did not even blink. So, at this point, I was starting to get
mad. I came even closer. Now, I stood about a foot away from his face.
I was just getting ready to grab him at his shoulders and shake him up
a bit. Just to mess with me. Than, the moment I reached my hands out to
drop them on his shoulders was how fast they dropped to my side. It was
like some force or urge came over me not to touch him. Still, at this time,
I really paid no mind to anything. So, I just grabbed our drinks, walked
out the kitchen and headed back outside.</B>
<BR><B>The moment the door closed behind me. I heard this loud bang came
from inside. I ran into the kitchen and the chair where my brother sat,
it was now knocked over. Yet, the bang was so loud that it had sounded
like someone had picked up the chair and threw it down as hard as they
could. There layed the chair in one piece not even a scratch.</B>
<BR><B>I started yelling for my brother. No reply. I searched every room,
closet, under beds, behind furniture, everywhere and nothing. I continued
to call my brother and even asked my cousin if, by chance, my brother came
outside. She said no. She asked me what was that loud bang. Now, at this
time I thought I was going crazy. I know, for a fact, that I was just talking
to my brother about 10 minutes ago. Our house was a very small house with
hardly any place to hide besides the ones I already searched. I told my
cousin about how my brother was just looking at me with his eyes. How I
try to touch him but all of sudden I didn't. I knew I was not seeing things.
Or was I? All sort of questions were flowing through my mind. So, we decided
to just chill outside and wait for my Dad to return. I was still thinking
that my brother was hiding and playing some hugh joke on me.</B>
<BR><B>About 1 1/2 to 2 hours later, my Dad comes back. Sure enough, my
brother was following right behind him. Come to find out, that my brother
was with him the whole time.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Henry Part 3</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: PatnConnie99@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello again. I've written a few times now about
"Henry" the ghost in room 207 here at the Days Inn-Airport in Colorado
Springs. Well, we were sold out a few days ago which is (sadly) a rare
occurance in the middle of the week, and we were forced to sell Henry's
room. It seems he was not terribly happy about this as the guest reported
to me the next morning that all night her window rattled and lightbulbs
were blowing out left and right. I work the night audit shift which is
11 pm to 7 am so by the time I got here they had already given up trying
to do anything with the lights before I got here. I do however know of
a few things that he did while I was running my reports that night. The
clock that hangs above the door to the breakfast room fell off the wall
(It is screwed in to the drywall) and the PBX console started going nuts.
All the lights on the panel lit up and the ringer let out a screech that
lasted a good 30 -40 seconds. Then he went after the coffee maker...that,
I was not happy about. nothing like cleaning up several gallons of really
hot water to get me in a grumpy mood. I've set up 207 in the computer to
be unavailable for a few weeks to sort out any possible electrical problems
and I've also had the window checked for any possible loose spots. So far
all the people I've sent in haven't seen anything unusual as far as power
surges or loose glass. One person however did have the distinct feeling
of getting "whacked" on the back of the head. Personally, I like Henry,
he's got a pretty good sense of humor...But I'll be damned if I'm gonna
be the one to sell his room. (without his permission heh heh)</B>

<P><B>By: dave.w@ntlworld.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was with a friend of mine at his girlfriends house. She has a money
box in her bedroom, which plays a tune everytime you put money in it.</B>
<BR><B>The three of us were sat in her living room, and i began to experience
an extremely odd feeling, the one you get when you think that someone os
wathcing you. I informed Louise (my mates girl friend) about this feeling
and she confirmed that she was experiencing the same feeling, as was Shawn.
It went on like that for a few minutes, neither of us knowing what to do,
but then we listenined and i watched Louise's face go pale as we all heard
the money box start up, and start playing. Then we heard a series of banging
coming from her bed room, and she sent Shawn to go and take a look.</B>
<BR><B>Shawn came back down a few minutes later, and told us that there
was nobody up there, but the room was extremely cold, and there was no
window open. That scared me enough to go straight home.</B>
<BR><B>Since then, Louise has told me of a history of odd goings on that
have happened in her home, before and after we experineced that night.
She has seen 'ghostly apparitions' of people whilst she was in her room.
She has noticed sudden temerature changes, and what seem like shadows on
her landing.</B>
<BR><B>I have never been back to her house, and do not intend on going
back.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi I was at my firends house and I was sitting on the couch watching
her do something then something on the stairs caught my eye.&nbsp; A tall
white figure that was a women's body skinny and beautiful.&nbsp; It happened
again but in a different way i was sleeping on the couch i was sitting
on.&nbsp; I opened one eye cause i couldn't find the glasses that where
in my hand and&nbsp; the figure was standing over me staring at me. I shut
my eye as fast as I could.&nbsp; Then I heared a noise.&nbsp; Foot , foot
steps, where coming closer to me.&nbsp; I opened both my eyes and the figure
ws walking tword me!&nbsp; My friend was asleep and she had some expiriences
with the ghost.&nbsp; The cat was so funny batting at the air and when
she saw me looking at her she vanished.&nbsp; My friend laughed when i
told her about the ghost staring at me when i opened only one eye she said,"
She was probably wondering who you where!" I was a little shakey the whole
day.&nbsp; I kept&nbsp; felling that a spirit wwas by me the whole time.&nbsp;
I felt her not by her coldness just i had a feeling in my gut, the feeling
i have in my stomache when i go to a grave yard.&nbsp; But it was really
strong by the stairs and her mother's room.&nbsp; I don't want you going
and checking out the house it really is ok.&nbsp; But when i feel that
feeling it feels like there are 2 spirits.&nbsp; My friend thinks it is
her great grandmother and her grandfather.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Spooky Things</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: thebravelittletoaster87@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I am a 15 year old female, even though I am still young I have seen
a good amount of "spooky" things.</B>
<BR><B>The first one being when I was in seventh grade. I was sitting home
one night by myself while my mom and her boyfriend were picking up my younger
brother (Who has seen things as well as my mother) on our old computer.
We used to keep the computer in our basement which by the way was very
oddly built when we moved in it looked like a maze and there were old coal
shoots in there, most of them were knocked out after a few years of living
there.. Well on this particular night I had the music turned up loud and
was talking to people only and I notice something out of the corner of
my eye, when I turned to look what it was my brothers tricycle moved two
feet slowly across the floor and came to a stop. I was scared pretty badly
I ripped the cord to the computer out of the wall and run up stairs out
the front door and down a couple houses to a friends. Now about a year
or so before hand my younger brother being 2 at the time went down into
the basement and came up screaming and crying about a mean old man in the
basement. When investigated no one or nothing was found. Nothing happened
for about a year than one night it happened again. At this time we had
gotten a dog who was very fond of me (I saved her from the pound) Everyone
was sleeping and I was on the phone and watching TV. Every other tv in
the house was on and so were many lights. My dog started barking at this
one corner in my room and after awhile she made a pouting noise and her
ears went down as though she had down something bad. So my tv shut off,
just mine and stayed off not really thinking anything of it at the time
I went back to my conversation. As I was getting ready to get off the phone
I heard someone singing, it was very quiet barely enough to hear but it
was like a humming of a women. I yelled for my mom and no one answered,
the humming stopped shortly after. These scared me plus many other odd
little things, like seeing a young child by my brother and once being upset
because a necklace my mother gave me had disappeared which reappeared the
next morning next to my bed. Just a bunch of little things. Now I was Diagnosed
with Crohns Disease when I was ten, but really didnt start bothering me
until I entered high school, because of emotion stressed and trying to
commit suicide I think I triggered something. Whenever I am extremely depressed
or feel like I did before that time period I close my eyes and when I open
them I see a very pretty blue shimmering looking thing, it will be present
for a bit and then "shimmer" away for some reason it makes me feel very
calm. Like I have someone close by. I know an older couple lived in this
house but I dont know much more about it, my mother has seen and heard
some strange things as well. The only one that truly terrifies me is the
one in the basement when I'm down there I feel as though my life is in
danger, I have had friends sit down there both in daylight and darkness
and had them run up the stairs swearing</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The thunder woke me up at about 2:00 am and I had to go to the bathroom
and so I roll over in the bed and all of a sudden the guest bedroom door
began opening and I thought it was my grandfather, because sometimes he
stays up late reading or if he can't sleep, and I called "Grandpa is that
you?" and I got no answer so I wait for a few moments and then all of a
sudden this tall, transparent woman in all white was floating in the enterance
to the room, and had a long night gown on; she was completely shinning
white as well as the nightie.&nbsp; She looked to be about 6 feet tall.&nbsp;
My dad was sleeping beside me and I pulled the covers over my head and
I looked again and she was staring at me and then disappeared into the
wall!</B>
<BR><B>I slept restlessly the rest of the night!! I was completely frightened
by this!!!</B>
<BR><B>I told my parents, but they don't believe me.&nbsp; My mom I think
may believe though.</B>

<P><B>Was It A Dream or Not?</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: DarkHeav3n19@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Well this happened to me one night in the beginning of April of this
year. I slept over my dad's house. Me and my half sister slept out in the
living room on the two couches out there. They were side by side. I slept
on the right one, which is by the sliding door leading to the backdoor
while she slept on the left one, next to the hall way leading to the bedrooms.
Anyway, I fell asleep around 12 AM or so, but I suddenly woke up around
2:40 AM (I checked my watch). I decided to call my friend kuz I haven't
talked to him that night and we usually talked everynight. I called him
and he answered, half alseep. We talked for a min or two then I let him
go back to sleep. I fell asleep right away again. I dont know how much
longer it was but I woke up again later that night for no particular reason
(I have a habit of doing that). I was laying on my right side facing the
wall but I had the urge to turn around. And when I did, at the foot of
the couch I was sleeping on stood a girl who looked to be in her teens,
around my age. I knew she should not be there because my family is Asian
and she was Caucasian. She had short blond hair and was wearing dark denim
jeans and jacket. She was facing me but pointing at my sister. When she
pointed to my sister the only thing she said to me was either, "Ahmi" or
"Omi". And I have no idea what that word means. It sounds like Japanese
or somethin. After she said that, I turned back around like it was nothing
and went back to sleep. I guess I was too tired and didn't want to deal
with whatever it was. Usually I would be scared, but I wasn't this time.
The weird thing was that she had white light surounding her, that is why
I could see what she was wearing and her hair color. She sorta looked like
a rocker type girl. I still don't understand why the girl appeared...and
if it was real or a dream. And sometimes dreams can be real. If anyone
knows what that word mean or if the word even exists at all...email me
and let me know. Thanks for reading.</B>

<P><B>Tooth Fairy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Vickie.Moldenhauer@offutt.af.mil</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 3 or 4 years old I lived with my father and his wife in
a little, white&nbsp; house in the small town of DeSoto.</B>
<BR><B>I was at the age when you first start to lose your baby teeth and
the "tooth fairy"(who at the time I believed existed) came and gave you
goodies as you slept at night.</B>
<BR><B>Well, being the BAD child I was, I decided I was going to scam the
tooth fairy out of some extra goodies.</B>
<BR><B>I had lost a tooth a couple weeks back and I kept it. (My tooth
fairy never took the teeth from under my pillow.)&nbsp; And for every day
that week, I told my father I had lost another tooth and I would show him
the old tooth.</B>
<BR><B>SOOOO...every night for like four days I got goodies for the same
tooth.&nbsp; The perfect crime.</B>
<BR><B>On the fifth night I awoke in my bed and got up to see what the
tooth fairy had brought me (the tooth fairy left stuff for me on my dresser).&nbsp;
The tooth fairy had brought me a box of chocolates...but for some reason
EVERY SINGLE CHOCOLATE IN BOX HAD A BITE OUT OF IT!!!!!!.</B>
<BR><B>So being angry and confused I turned around to crawl back in my
bed.&nbsp; But when I turned around I saw a beautiful, white, glowing woman.&nbsp;
As I watched her, it looked like she was trying to turn the doorknob of
my bedroom door.&nbsp; She couldn't though, her hand just kept going through
the door knob.&nbsp; Then she just faded away and I was all alone in my
dark bedroom.&nbsp; The thing about this encounter was that I was not startled
by what had just happened or scared of the woman, I thought that she was
the TOOTH FAIRY!!</B>
<BR><B>The next morning my father asked my what the tooth fairy had brought
me and I showed him the box of chocolates with a bite taken out of every
chocolate.&nbsp; He persisted (with a huge smile on his face) to tell me
that the tooth fairy knew I had been scamming her with the old tooth and
must be pretty mad at me to do something like that.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways, I didn't really think much about my encounter until I was
much older and no longer believed in the tooth fairy.&nbsp; Now when I
remember that night it kind of gives me the creeps.&nbsp; Thank god I was
still young enough to believe in the tooth fairy.&nbsp; If something happened
to me like that now, I think I would LOSE MY MIND!!!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Ghosts that Scare Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DjVega2121@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hi my name is Natalie and When I was 5 (now I am 16) my family moved
to an apartment ( a big one) it wasn't even old to tell you the truth,
it looked new. Well my dad who was probably in his 30 was quiet a religious
man. He grew out his beard and everything, he prayed every day! Well the
apartment we had was two stories. Me and my twin sister Tina would never
like going down stairs at night because we felt that there was bad vibes
coming from there. To tell you the truth I selpt with my light green Ghetto
shoes a couple of nights, don't ask why, but I just did. Well there was
bad ghosts there it would terriorize us all the time. My family was quiet
religious even at worse of&nbsp; times.</B>
<BR><B>We moved out of the apartment to an older looking home in the same
city. But this time under my window on the outside is this concrete with
a hand print of a young kid, 1783-17 something I don't want to go and look!&nbsp;
my brother John and I put our hands there at different times in our life
and both fit. Anyway my bed use to face the door&nbsp; so when&nbsp; I
selpt I could see into the hall way. What a wrong place to sleep let me&nbsp;
tell you. Well I use to see everynight a man about 6'9 or 7 feet tall walk
through out the house especially my room. Once I saw him walk toward me
Man was I scared at this point. His face was an inch from mine I closed
my eyes and tried to sleep. I can feel this ghost touching me all the time
and it scares the sh*t out of me.</B>
<BR><B>Now I moved my bed and sleep next to the mirror which yet another
bad place to sleep, but its better than the door!&nbsp; In my room you
could hear all kinds of noise, but it mostly happens on my side of the
room. He never bothers my sister I guess because she didn't put her hand
on the stone! But noises ususally happen in my brothers room where it's
the worst.</B>
<BR><B>My father and mother were gardening in the backyard one day when
my dad jokingly said, "Get out of here ghost we don't want you here anymore."
( there is a broken jacuesy in the backyard and my brother use to hit it
with a hammer to release anger) Well the noise of a hammer was hitting
it and no one there to hit it. My mom ran to my dad and my dad said, "Oh
no ghost we want you here I was just kidding." I think the ghost in my
house is good, but I think there are several ghosts here in my home that
come and go. One night my sister and I were sleeping (we are deep sleepers)!
my dad hured a choking noise and he ran to my room (his room is across
the hall) and nothing was there. He thought one of us was being choked,
I don't know maybe one of us were and my dad saved us. My dad blessed my
room the very next day! Now nothing really happens here, but I still get
scared at night I don't like to be alone. Nothing really happens in my
room except for noise once in a blue moon which I could handle now. please
watch out people because God is the only one who can save you. Say Gods
name if a ghost attacks or when your're afraid trust me it works because
they're scared of him, say it even if you do not believe in him. Thank
you for reading my stories there are more to tell,&nbsp; but I rather not
for I really do not wish to recall the memory. I have experiencing ghosts
throughout my life I don''t know why, but I do. Thank you once again and
be safe out there!</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Creepy Two Story House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mneal@sutv.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi. When i was 8 almost 9 my father got laid off from a power plant
in Oklahoma. A couple of months later he found a job opening in Kansas
doing the same things that he used to do at the other powere plant. He
had 3 months to find a house and get us all moved up there but he had already
started his job. We went up to Kansas (which was only about 40 miles from
where we lived) and we found a 2 bed-room house that was for rent and we
took it we got all moved in a week after my 9th b-day. i along with my
12 year old brother slept up stairs my room was not capeted so you could
hear every noise. when we lived in there about 2 months is when i could
hear noises i heard people talk when everyone was asleep and it wasn't
my mom's voice or my dad's. Some times i could even hear footsteps on the
stairs and i would go and look and noone would be there and i would hear
voices i could never make out what they were saying.Then one day when i
was still nine i had a friend from church come over and we were playing
barbies when we went down stairs to get a drink and my brother was talking
to one of his friends out side and my friend and i went back up stairs
and we found the barbies under the bed,we were really scared and went down
stairs and told my mom and she said it probably was just in our heads and
i also told my mom about the talking and the foot steps and she said that
i probably just imained it but when i wuz 11 we moved and i never found
out why right now i am 14 in july i will be 15.</B>

a slate roof on it with real shudders on the windows and fountains out
in the yard still filled with water,well,in the attic,there was a huge
pile of leatherneck magazines dated from the1950's durring the korean war.as
i nosed around up there alone(the rest of them decided to leave me alone)i
all od a sudden saw the magazine flip thru the pages alone and stop at
pictures in the battle campaigns of world war two and korea,i was so scared,i
could not get out of that mansion fast enough,it had been for sale for
more than ten years and nobody ever showed interests on this huge corner
estate,later on in the late 1960's,it was involved in a huge fire and it

<P><B>Lost Soul</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CBoshell@nemours.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been told by many observers that I am a sensitive. The only
thing it</B>
<BR><B>has meant to me is that&nbsp; sometimes a place will make me very
uncomfortable.</B>
<BR><B>Of course my doctor says it is anxiety attacks, but the attacks
only happen</B>
<BR><B>in certain places. They do not seem to be tied to stress in my life,
I have</B>
<BR><B>had plenty stress and always weather that well.</B>
<BR><B>My husband and I purchased a fairly new house last year in Jacksonville,
FL.</B>
<BR><B>After moving in I could not go outside the master bedroom at night
without</B>
<BR><B>an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and dread, every night at exactly
1:30am</B>
<BR><B>I awoke feeling those same feelings even though I did not leave
my bed. And</B>
<BR><B>I could not look down the hallway towards the attached garage with
out</B>
<BR><B>feeling extremely sad, day or night. Once again my doctor put me
on anxiety</B>
<BR><B>medicine and though the feelings quieted down they did not go away.&nbsp;
I could</B>
<BR><B>now go into the kitchen at night but if I stood at the kitchen counter
I</B>
<BR><B>would feel a cold breeze on my legs and kept wanting to look over
my</B>
<BR><B>shoulder as if someone was right behind me. Needless to say I drove
my</B>
<BR><B>husband crazy.</B>
<BR><B>The house had only had 2 owners before we bought the house. The
first owners</B>
<BR><B>built the house in 1995 and lived there until selling it in August
2000 to</B>
<BR><B>the second owners. We bought the house in Feb. 2001. We were told
the</B>
<BR><B>husband died in a car wreck going to pick up a car from their old
home and</B>
<BR><B>that is why it was being sold so soon since last purchase.</B>
<BR><B>I could not let go of the feeling that this was not the truth. Finally
a</B>
<BR><B>neighbor who was moving decided we should know more. Even though
we got mail</B>
<BR><B>for the previous tenants the real estate agent would not get us
a forwarding</B>
<BR><B>address and at the time of closing she had no contact with us having
all</B>
<BR><B>paperwork handled through the realtor. The neighbor told us that
no he did</B>
<BR><B>not die in a car wreck but committed suicide in his car down town.
The car</B>
<BR><B>had been returned to the survivor and parked in the garage.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Hillhead halls of residence, Old Aberdeen</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: renizzanze@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Firstly, i guess i am what you call a "sensitive".&nbsp; I regularly
see things,</B>
<BR><B>hear things, and feel things that others don't.&nbsp; I'm usually
the first to</B>
<BR><B>point out when sometihng "doesn't feel right" and i have been like
this all</B>
<BR><B>my life.</B>
<BR><B>During my first year at university i stayed at hillhead halls and
i had the</B>
<BR><B>strangest experiences.</B>
<BR><B>For about the first month of being there, it was fine.&nbsp; One
day i was</B>
<BR><B>walking by the kitchen i felt a huge blast of cold and loud whispering,</B>
<BR><B>which really really frightened me.&nbsp; Seeing strange things doesn't
usually</B>
<BR><B>bother me because it happens quite regularly, but this really bothered
me</B>
<BR><B>because it felt so so bad.&nbsp; I asked my flat mate if she had
heard anything</B>
<BR><B>but she said that she hadn't.</B>
<BR><B>Just after the xmas holiday, i came back to worse time of my life.&nbsp;
Firstly,</B>
<BR><B>there was a man walking around my flat.&nbsp; He was very tall,
wearing all black</B>
<BR><B>- including a black hat or hood and you could not see his face.&nbsp;
I saw him</B>
<BR><B>out doors and inside the flat.&nbsp; He frequently had a black dog
with him,</B>
<BR><B>which often walked by my bedroom door.&nbsp; My flat mate got really
scared of</B>
<BR><B>being alone in her room as she felt that there was someone watching
her from</B>
<BR><B>her door.&nbsp; It was about a week after first seeing this man
that electrical</B>
<BR><B>appliances in my room started to go wrong.&nbsp; My electrical alarm
clock, for</B>
<BR><B>example, would just start to beep - much louder than anything it
had ever</B>
<BR><B>done - and did not stop even when i pulled the plug out (it has
no battery</B>
<BR><B>backup).&nbsp; My printer would just print out random rubbish, even
if it was not</B>
<BR><B>switched on and light bulbs would blow if you looked at them for
a long</B>
<BR><B>time.&nbsp; The electrical stuff would only happen in my room.&nbsp;
Objects would</B>
<BR><B>disapear from my room, reappearing elswhere in the flat.&nbsp; An
example of this</B>
<BR><B>that we lost the bread knife out the kitchen.&nbsp; Bearing in mind
that i don't</B>
<BR><B>eat bread much - especially not in my bedroom - we found it on top
of my</B>
<BR><B>wardrobe at the back about 3 or 4 months after it got 'lost'.</B>
<BR><B>At night was the worse.&nbsp; Me and my flat mate would drag her
mattress through</B>
<BR><B>to my room and sleep there because we were to frightened to sleep
in</B>
<BR><B>seperate rooms.&nbsp; I would have the most horrendous nightmares,
which i never</B>
<BR><B>got before and have never got since.&nbsp; At night, there would
be constant</B>
<BR><B>bangings, tappings and scrapings which sounded like they were coming
from</B>
<BR><B>the space between the walls.</B>
<BR><B>I think about the worse thing that I experiencd whilst living there
was</B>
<BR><B>getting up one morning and walking to the window at the end of the
landing</B>
<BR><B>and looking out at the trees that are above the river Don.&nbsp;
On the larger</B>
<BR><B>branches, there were hanged people (as in dead with a rope around
their</B>
<BR><B>neck) swinging in the wind.&nbsp; They were not dressed in modern
clothing.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>wanted to run away and stop seeing it, but maybe i was too frightened,</B>
<BR><B>because my feet wouldn't move and i found it really difficult to
breath.</B>
<BR><B>After this, my flatmate found staying in her room, which overlooked
the</B>
<BR><B>river Don, unbearable and moved in to the room next to mine.&nbsp;
As soon as</B>
<BR><B>that room was locked everythng was fine, until it came to the end
of the</B>
<BR><B>year and she moved out.&nbsp; She moved out about a fortnight earlier
than me,</B>
<BR><B>but i was spending most my time in the flat above mine.</B>
<BR><B>After her moving out, I came down from upstairs to find her door
open and</B>
<BR><B>light shining through on to the landing carpet.&nbsp; Very bravely
(stupidly??) I</B>
<BR><B>went to shut her door and switch the lights off, but just as i got
there the</B>
<BR><B>door slammed in my face and locked and i heard the lights switch
off.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>phoned my flat mate to make sure she was home, which she was.&nbsp;
I then phoned</B>
<BR><B>the people from upstairs and asked them to come down, and when they
got down</B>
<BR><B>to my flat, the room was unlocked again but was totally empty and
freezing</B>
<BR><B>cold.&nbsp; It was the summer, but you could see your breath was
white.</B>
<BR><B>The next day, when i got out the shower i found that the bathroom
door was</B>
<BR><B>wide open despite the fact that i had locked the door and there
is no way</B>
<BR><B>that the lock could open itself.&nbsp; Also, the bathroom door was
very creaky</B>
<BR><B>and i hadn't heard a creak.&nbsp; I went to my room and got dressed
as quickly as</B>
<BR><B>possible, but i could not find the key to my room so i could lock
up and</B>
<BR><B>leave.&nbsp; i had left the key in the lock on the outside of the
door but it was</B>
<BR><B>gone.&nbsp; I found it in the bathroom sink.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, one night I gave my key to one of the people living upstairs
to go</B>
<BR><B>and get me a sweater from my flat as i was too frightened to go
down.&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>person, who WAS a complete sceptic, came back upstairs completly
pale,</B>
<BR><B>sweating cold sweat, shaking and totally out of breath.&nbsp; I
don't know what</B>
<BR><B>happened because this person will not talk about it and has made
us all</B>
<BR><B>promise never to bring it up in conversation.</B>
<BR><B>These all sound like really wierd events, but i don't smoke, drink
or do any</B>
<BR><B>kind of drugs, and i didn't then, but I swear they are all true.&nbsp;
i don't</B>
<BR><B>want to experience anything like that again as long as i live.&nbsp;

<P><B>I used to live in a very small town in utah. I lived a small house
that my Grandmother had spent her last years in.After she had passed I
had noticed some very strange things, I would see her reflection in her
bedroom mirror.I thought i was just going crazy till I would hear her singing
in her bedroom. I kept her pearl necklace in a box by my bed but it would
always end up on her bed stand no matter how many time i would place it
back into the box, it would always be back in her room. finally after 3
months of this I started to really freak out when I was in ben one late
june night, I woke up to a warm breath on my neck I rolled over and my
grandmother was there, I could no longer take this I ran out of the bed
room and to the nearest houst where the neighbor tommy could see that I
was histaricol he came back to the house and said that he saw nothing but
my grandmothers music box was open and playing. the next day I went back
to get some of my things and the pearl necklace had broken but the pearls
were in my grandmothers bedroom.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Cemetary in Alabama Backwoods</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sag1876@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was reading your site, which I really find interesting and I recalled
something that happened to my friend and I about 10 years ago.&nbsp; Haven't
thought about it in a long time, so I will try to be as precise as I can.&nbsp;
My friend and I went to Alabama during our senior year in high school to
visit my grandparents.&nbsp; Now, my grandparents lived in the middle of
nowhere, little town, you blink you miss it.&nbsp; Anyways, there wasn't
much to do so one day we went exploring.&nbsp; Down about a half mile from
my grandparents house at the end of their road was a huge pasture, it hadn't
been inhabitated or cared for years.&nbsp; There was a large gate with
a "No Trespassing" sign, this made us curious to see what was hiding back
there in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; We crawled under the gate and started
walking, there was a gravel path and nothing else but trees, grass and
insects.&nbsp; We kept going for about a mile until we were in a fully
wooded area, this is where the strangeness happened, first off we stumbled
across an old graveyard with only about 3 graves in it, looked like a family,
the tombstones were dated back in the early 1800's.&nbsp; I took photos,&nbsp;
that I can send at a later date if you like. Across from the graves was
a waterfall, we decided to sit and take in the site, while sitting there
we heard horse hooves galloping, closely, we turned and saw nothing.&nbsp;
A little while later we heard what sounded like something being swung through
the air near our heads, nothing visible though.&nbsp; It spooked us and
we decided then that we should probably head back to the house.&nbsp; On
our way back we heard the horse hooves again, this time we ran!&nbsp; Got
back to my grandparents house and relayed our story to my grandfather,
this is were it got spooky, he said that a while back he stumbled across
the waterfall too and decided to sit and fish at the bank, he heard the
horse too and heard the swinging, which he described as an hatchet or something
similar.&nbsp; Only he said that he turned he saw a man on a white horse
carrying a machete and appeared to be clearing the fields, but it wasn't
really there, like he and the horse were transparent, he said that's when
he took off running too.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of, it that at
one time someone lived on that land, which is why they were buried there.&nbsp;
I can tell you one thing, it spooked me then, but now I just realize that
those people just stayed where their home was.&nbsp; I haven't had any
opportunities to get back to that area, but if I do, I may go visit them.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I moved to Indiana in 1986.&nbsp; I befriended a woman who sold real
estate and said she knew of this huge house that was for rent in a small
town called Lamb, Indiana.&nbsp; It sits directly across the river from
Carrollton, Kentucky and is half-way between Vevay and Madison, Indiana.</B>
<BR><B>The house was absolutely fabulous!&nbsp; Made of stone, and built
circa 1800.&nbsp; It is told that the Indians taught a white man how to
build the house.&nbsp; It became part of the underground railroad during
the Civil War.&nbsp; There was a tunnel built from the Ohio River up to
the basement wall, where they had knocked a hole in the wall for slaves
to enter.</B>
<BR><B>My story starts in the fall of 1987, when my mother, my dog, and
I were on the first floor in the living room, watching television.&nbsp;
My little dog ran upstairs and was running around in circles.&nbsp; I could
hear her little toenails on the wooden planks.&nbsp; I felt a cold chill,
like a burst of cold air, and became puzzled by it.&nbsp; There were no
doors or windows open in the house.&nbsp; It was cold out and we had built
a fire in the wood stove.</B>
<BR><B>I went up to check on my little dog (to see what she was doing),
and there it was.</B>
<BR><B>My room had a door that led out to nothing.&nbsp; I assume there
was a balcony at one time, but at this time, there was no evidence of one
so the door stayed shut and locked.</B>
<BR><B>When&nbsp; I had gone upstairs, I noticed the air was more frigid
and it seemed windy.&nbsp; I went to my room and the door was standing
open and it looked as though a small child had breathed on the window of
the door and wrote "Amy's room" on the window.</B>
<BR><B>About a year or so later, we had some family staying with us for
the weekend and my cousin decided to set up a tape recorder in the basement
to see if there were any noises.&nbsp; My little nieces and there three
friend bedded down in the living room by the wood stove to stay warm and
we all went to bed.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning, one of the little girls thanked my dad for stoking
the fire that night because it was getting kind of chilly.&nbsp; My dad
hadn't been down stairs all night!</B>
<BR><B>My cousin went down to the basement to get the tape recorder (reel-to-reel,
by the way), brought it back upstairs and played it back to us.&nbsp; You
could vividly hear a little girl say "Mommy".</B>
<BR><B>My family lived in that house for almost fifteen years.&nbsp; There
were several occurrences, none of them bad or violent.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>I had not done any big movements and the window was shut</B>
<BR><B>so there was no wind.</B>
<BR><B>I looked at my clock to see that i only had about ten minuits</B>
<BR><B>before my scool started.</B>

<BR><B>Disneyland</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: n.mehmet@ntlworld.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Not just long a go i went on a school trip to disneyland for 3 days.
There were 6 of us in a family room. In my half of the room there was Me,
Sam and Laim and in the second side of the room was Joe, Sam C and Danny.
When we first went</B>
<BR><B>in the room we started to unpack our clothes then we started to
hear knocking at the front door but no one could of done it because the
teachers were outside our room helping some one into there room. So we
did not take any notice.</B>
<BR><B>Then after lights out we started to hear these weird noises.</B>
<BR><B>Then the scary part about it was as we were going to go into the
other half of the room. To Danny and the other lot we saw this dark figure
that had a bright light. Then we fought it was our imagination but it kept
on going to 3:30am. then we saw this little cloud thing floating around
sam's head. As soon as that happened we went to look for a teacher we got</B>
<BR><B>one he slept in a room but he had socks thrown at him but in the
morning we all had socks on.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>hi, i just remembered something that happend to me years ago. i was
about 12</B>
<BR><B>so this was ten years ago. it was not long after my great-grandma
died. her</B>
<BR><B>house was just a short walk from my grandparents house in a rural
area. i</B>
<BR><B>was there all the time riding four wheelers and "hunting" with my
bb gun,</B>
<BR><B>lol. anyway, i was outside my great-grandma's old house standing
quietly</B>
<BR><B>shooting at birds when i could have sworn i heard a gentle voice
whisper my</B>
<BR><B>name in my ear then tell me to stop that. maybe it was her telling
me not to</B>
<BR><B>shoot the sparrows out there as she had done many times in life,
or maybe it</B>
<BR><B>was just my imagination, whichever it was, i was standing in my
grandparents</B>
<BR><B>house just seconds later all freaked out, but i never mentioned
it to</B>
<BR><B>anyone. didn't think it was such a big deal.</B>
<BR><B>thanks for listening, i'll let you be now.</B>

<P><B>Why Five?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mandie@cableone.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a lot of experiences I would like to share with you all -
all of which are true.</B>
<BR><B>Every home I have lived in up until now has been "haunted" or otherwise
had some form</B>
<BR><B>of ghostly activity happening. I will start with one and if you
all like it I will share more. I feel</B>
<BR><B>lucky to have experienced so many ghosts!</B>
<BR><B>My mother can tell you that when I was just a little baby in Denver
we had a ghost that was quite interested in me, or at least my toys. I
had this little train that went around the edge of my crib - it was battery
operated and had to be switched on by a lever to run. Many late nights
my mom would come check on me, hearing me cooing because my little train
would be going round and round - when no one had turned it on - she would
check it and the lever would still be in the off position. since it was
keeping me awake, she removed it. After the train was removed, the TV would
start turning on around 2am each night. No one else was awake to have turned
it on. But it seemed that whatever this being was was there to serve a
purpose. My mom's family lived in Nebraska - and as I said we were in Denver.
This was the early 80's so&nbsp; instead of expensive long distance my
mom would often write letters back to my ain Nebraska. My mom started getting
these strange feelings -&nbsp; right around 5:00pm everyday the clock wouldn't
chime as it did on every other&nbsp; hour - and like it had before. She
said it was like somebody was telling her to watch the kids closely, she
could almost hear the voice. At first she didn't think much of it, since
my sister and I were always close by our mom. But it was happening every
single day - right at 5:00 - so she started telling my aunt about it in
her letters - since my aunt had 3 small children of her own. She would
say that she would get these strong urges to check on me and my sister
- and we would be just fine. She kept telling my aunt about it and my aunt
always said her kids were fine too. My mom was getting completely boggled
at this message to watch out for children - when all the kids were safe
and sound. Well my aunt's husband had a young boy from a previous marriage
that did not live&nbsp; with them.&nbsp; He would ride his bike home from
school everyday - and living in the country in Nebraska he did have to
ride his bike on the highway to get home - but there isn't much traffic
out there so it wasn't a concern at the time. One day on his ride home,
he was tragically hit by a semi and died on the highway - right about 5:00pm.
After his death my mom stopped getting the "messages" and the clock started
chiming at 5:00pm again, the tv stopped turning itself on and off, and
no other ghostly activity occured in the house after the boy's death.</B>

<P><B>Our Jennifer</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: susanday@dodo.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>Jennifer is our ghost and I just get the feeling she is only between
5 and 6 years old and wears a powder blue dress with black patient leather
shoes. She has made herself known to me on several occations which my husband
laughed off as 'just an old house'.</B>
<BR><B>He changed his mind one morning when he arrived home from night
shift. Me and our young boys were still in bed and it was still dark outside.</B>
<BR><B>I woke up to the sound of him fumbleing with his keys and trying
to unlock the front door. It seemed to take him forever and I was just
about to get out of bed to open the door for him when he finally got inside.</B>
<BR><B>He called out to me and said that it wasn't funny. I got out of
bed and said what wasn't funny and he seemed to get the shock of his life
when I came out of the bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>He swore he tried three times to unlock the door and everytime the
door relocked itself. He thought it was me playing a joke because when
he finally unlocked the door yet again he heard foot falls running up the
hallway.</B>
<BR><B>He became a believer that day. We still hear foot falls up the hallway
and my husband has thought it's one of our boys out of bed but, when we
check, they are both sound asleep.He doesn't put it down to 'just an old
house' anymore.</B>

<BR><B>My Cousin</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tak@bluemarble.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 4 or 5 years old my mom and I had to go over to
my aunt house to get something, but no one was home and my cousin had just
moved away. My mom went inside to get whatever she needed, and while she
was in there my cousin, that had just moved out came to the door and waved
at me, so i waved back. When my mom came back out I asked her if she saw
my cousin, and she said no, no one is home.</B>
