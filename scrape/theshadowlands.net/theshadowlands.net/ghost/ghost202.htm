<p><b>A Story to Tell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sheeky420@webinbox.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here is a story that my Mother likes to tell. I don't remember much
of what happened because I was only about 3 at the time (I am now 22).
When I was first born till about 4 years old I lived in a two family house
in Elma, NY. My Mother never really believed in these things but now she
insists that she is always being followed. She never experienced things
until she lived there. Well there was one other thing but I will get to
that.</b>
<br><b>It started one day when she was sitting in the living room. Our
bedroom was in the far corner of the house and me and my older sister were
sleeping in the room. The door was wide open for her to hear us. She heard
the door then slam shut and ran to the room. The door was locked and she
could not open it. She ran outside to the window and we were still sleeping.
The she ran back inside and the door was wide open. This happened quite
often.</b>
<br><b>Then one day she was standing in the kitchen when she saw a man
standing in our garden looking at the plants. She had no idea who he was
but she starting yelling and told him to go away. He never looked up. She
got my Dad and he was gone. A couple days later my sister went screaming
and crying from the bathroom. She was yelling he's in there with no shirt
on!! The same man that my Mother had saw came up through the bathroom vent
with overalls on. He smiled at my sister and disappeared. My Mother knew
it was him. She had problems with the electricity also. Many times her
power would just turn off. She would call the electric co. , the would
come to the door and the power would just turn on. As soon as they left
the power was off. They got to know here pretty well.</b>
<br><b>The scariest thing that ever happened to her happened before we
left. There was a picture in the doorway of a vase of flowers on a wooden
table. My Mother came home one day to find it upside down. The scary part
was it was no longer flowers, it was the picture of a lady and her son,
all in blue. My Mother freaked. She talked to a lady that is familiar with
these things. The lady told her that the picture meant there would be a
series of bad luck, not to her but to someone close to her. Not more than
a week later her best friends Mother died of a stroke. Then the same best
friend was stabbed by her boyfriend. Then she had 3 strokes and now walks
with a cane and talks like a child. My Mother always believed.</b>
<br><b>The last thing that happened to her had to do with her being a child.
Shw woke up one night to a lady standing over her bed. She said she was
beautiful and disappeared. My Mother started crying and called for my Grandmother.
She never thought anything of it until she miscarried a daughter when I
was about 16. My Mother already had a name for her. She worked as a Home
Health Aid, and one of her cases's sister was a psychic. She asked my Mother
about and apparition my Mother had seen when she was a child. The lady
knew nothing about my Mother or the woman, but she said she is her guardian
angel. She gave her the name Amanda and Amanda tried to reach her once
but was unsuccessful. She had died in her stomach. My Mother freaked because
he unborn daughter's name was Amanda. To this day she believes that Amanda
is there, watching and protecting her.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cschlessman@kvnews.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>We've known that a lady has died in our house for a while and since
I moved in strange</b>
<br><b>things have been happening.&nbsp; Lights turning on, radios without
power,</b>
<br><b>footsteps, faucets turning on right in front of our eyes,</b>
<br><b>but lately some scary things have been happening.&nbsp; For instance
I saw a vase suspend</b>
<br><b>in air and then drop and it wasn't even close to where the vase
was sitting</b>
<br><b>and nobody was in the house at the time, a friend and I saw it from
through a window.</b>
<br><b>But most recently, my roommate woke up in the morning and felt somebody
next</b>
<br><b>to her when she reached over to turn off her alarm clock and she
brushed a head and hair</b>
<br><b>when she did it and she thought it was me.&nbsp; So she got up and
didn't even turn on the</b>
<br><b>lights because she thought it would wake me, but then realized that
I wouldn't be in her bed and</b>
<br><b>she turned on her light and nobody was there, but she swears somebody
was in her bed.</b>
<br><b>It is getting creepy living there and we would rather not move out.</b>

<br><b>Weight on Shoulders</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: spoonta8@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My ghost story happened in Townsville, back in 1994, one night I
was staying</b>
<br><b>with my boyfriend, he was sharing the unit with a mate, and had
to get up in</b>
<br><b>the middle of the night and do my business in the toilet.&nbsp;
I came out and</b>
<br><b>looked into my boyfriends' mates room, he wasn't there at the time,
and then</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden I felt this heavy weight on my shoulders and there
was a</b>
<br><b>feel of an evil presence around me.&nbsp; I was very terrified!!&nbsp;
I walked as</b>
<br><b>quickly as I could to the door of my boyfriend's room, I opened
it and</b>
<br><b>closed it behind me, and as soon as I did that the evil presence
was gone,</b>
<br><b>the weight that was on my shoulders had gone and all I felt then
was a</b>
<br><b>goodness around me.&nbsp; I was so relieved that I stayed there
till morning.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>moved from the flat soon after this incident and have had nothing
like this</b>
<br><b>happen to me again.</b>

<br><b>1990</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mbrow47@bellsouth.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I don't quite know where to start. It was in the year 1990 my husband
to be had moved in with me and my 2 young daughters. Shortly after moving
in things began missing. A comb, ponytail just little items that could
be replaced. I thought my girls had taken them considering they where always
into everything. Then one evening after going to bed my boyfriend had stayed
up to watch TV. I had allot of trouble relaxing that night, felt like someone
was watching me but no one was there I thought it was my imagination until
my boyfriend came in the room and said something pushed him. He was really
scared and making me feel uneasy. The next morning everything was fine
until I mentioned the night before. He shrugged it off but I could tell
he was bothered by it. Two weeks went by and nothing happened. I had forgot
about things disappearing. One night I awoke to a child standing by my
bed, groggy as I was I thought it was my daughter and she needed a glass
of water. I got out of bed and she had gone. I got some water but she was
sleeping so I sat it by her bed incase she awoke again. Going back to my
room my TV came on in the living room. I went to turn it off but nothing
happened I went to unplug it but to my surprised it was already unplugged.
No sleeping that night I sat up trying to come up with explanations as
to what I saw. The child whom was a boy about 6 maybe 7 yrs old returned
to my bedside every for days. I became worried when my boyfriend didn't
want to sleep at all and my oldest daughter had made a new friend named
Seth. Our last night in our house was not intending to be our last but
we were somehow forced from our home. We were awakened to the awfulness
racket in the living room. Then to a child standing at the foot of our
bed a real as seeing a child crying please go fast run. Then the sound
of my daughter screaming a man was sitting on her bed. The noises where
sounds of terror screams, moanings, the house itself shaking. We grabbed
the kids ran like hell. When driving off in the window was the child and
a very large man standing over him. Family and friends moved all of our
stuff and I to this day don't even drive by the house. I do believe the
boy was warning me that the man was threatened by my boy-friend. I think
often of the little boy and what really happened in my house. My husband
now to this day doesn't speak of that night and doesn't want me to talk
about it. I wouldn't if I wasn't visited again by the same child now 11
years later. He has only came to me twice but now with a smile all I can
do is smile back. I would really like to have someone to talk to about
my encounters.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Father Came Back</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NLibra1062@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>It was the winter of 1978, a very cold and unusually snowy winter
in Baltimore County,&nbsp; Maryland.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was 16 years old and
living with my mother and stepfather in a two bedroom apartment. My&nbsp;
two older sisters and older brother had moved away from home.&nbsp; I had
the usual problems and dilemas as any teen ager would have.&nbsp; My father
had died suddenly the previous July of a heart attack. I never really knew
him because my mother and father had divorced when i was very young and
he lived in another state. I saw him a few times after the divorce, but
not alot, never talked to him on the phone and he would send me belated
birthday cards as i grew up. To say the least, it was not a very tight
father-daughter bond.&nbsp; He never made much effort,&nbsp; at least not
when he was alive.</b>
<br><b>That changed a little in the winter of 1978.&nbsp; My bedroom door
was always&nbsp; locked just in case my mother wanted to barge into my
room.&nbsp; I was smoking a cigarette and getting ready to go to sleep
about 11:00 pm, put out my cigarette and turned out the lamp on the nightstand
next to my bed.&nbsp; By the way-the lamp was working normally before i
turned it off.&nbsp; I had no trouble falling asleep that night but a few
hours later I was suddenly awakened.&nbsp; Someone was in bed next to me!&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was laying on my side on one side of the double bed and i was facing
out.&nbsp; Someone was laying behind me caressing my back,&nbsp; not in
a sexual way but&nbsp; in a very caring way.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so scared,&nbsp;
more scared then I have ever been.&nbsp; I froze for a moment to collect
my thoughts and knowing that i was not dreaming, i tried to ask, "Who is
there?"&nbsp; I was too scared because the words could not come out, no
sound could come out of my mouth.&nbsp; I finally got the courage to turn
around and see, but could not see what was behind me.&nbsp; I don't know
if I looked too quickly or what but i didn't see anyone.&nbsp; I reached
up&nbsp; to turn on my lamp, it would not go on.&nbsp; It did not come
on and blink out when a lightbulb burns out.&nbsp; The lamp&nbsp; just
would not come on.&nbsp; I bolted out of my bed without looking back and
ran out my bedroom door and woke up my mother.&nbsp; We sat at the dining
room table in the middle of the night while i calmed down and i told her
exactley what had happened.&nbsp; My mother told me that a month before
she was folding clothes in her bedroom when a whitish colored mist or cloud
came into the bedroom.&nbsp; She felt that it was my father and&nbsp; she
swung her arm out as it came closer,&nbsp; it dissapeared.&nbsp; I think
I slept on the sofa for the rest of the night.</b>
<br><b>The next day, my mother called and told my older sister what had
happened.&nbsp; She said&nbsp; the same thing happen to her a few night
earlier. However she thought it was a dream and she only woke up for a
minute. She was the only one of my siblings that had an encounter like
that, my other sister and brother were married and not sleeping alone.</b>
<br><b>As i thought about what had happened, after i calmed down, i knew
that it had to be my father coming back and trying to be there for me.&nbsp;
I even felt the weight going down on the bed next to me and even could
sense what he was wearing.&nbsp; He died in the middle of the night and
was wearing his pajams when he died. And why didn't the lamp come on after
it had worked a few hours later?&nbsp; I changed the light bulb the next
day and the lamp worked fine. I never had an encounter like that but had
felt i was being watched alot.&nbsp; Not really anything evil or mean but
just watched over.&nbsp; One night when i had that feeling, and couldn't
fall asleep, I spoke outloud.&nbsp; I said, " Dad, please leave me in&nbsp;
peace and go in peace, everything will be okay".&nbsp;&nbsp; After that
night I never had any feelings that I was not alone.&nbsp; I hope he did
know that I forgave him and I knew that he really did care when he was
alive,&nbsp; he just had his owm problems and could not let me know.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is not a story but something that really happened to me.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pkrob@ipa.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My life has been filled with so many experiences--too many to tell
here though I would love to. Reading other peoples stories have prompted
me to tell several of my own, in short form where possible.</b>
<br><b>When I was a small child I had a reoccuring dream (or so I thought)
of a boy with firey red hair and thick glasses crawling up the hill beside
our house and glaring at me while on all fours. I would always be outside
and would hide under my mothers car. One morning I awoke with grass stains
on my pajamas. I was raised in an immaculate household and was never allowed
outside in my p.j.s</b>
<br><b>Fast forward to 18 years old. My fiancee had just dropped me off,
he lived 3 miles from me. There was a dirt road that went straight from
his house to mine. About 5 minutes after he dropped me off I had a strange
sensation. I was talking to my grandmother and just lost all train of thought
and absentmindly went and sat by the phone. It rang it was my fiancees
mother. He had totalled the car and the police were at her home and were
taking her to the site. At this time we didnt know if my fiancee was hurt
badly or not. We knew he had made the call from a neighbors home to call
the police and that was all. We drove straight to this neighbors and he
was coming out of the house towards the car. I asked him if his side hurt
too badly. He looked at me and said how did you know I hurt my ribcage?
(he wasnt holding it or anything). Anyway a few days later we were watching
movies and he fell asleep with his head in my lap. He awoke,,startled and
said "Oh my God, it was you!!" It really freaked me out. He then told me
that when he wrecked the police said there was no way he exited that car
even more unbelievable that he walked away with hardly a scratch. He said
"It felt like someone put their arm around his side and pulled him out."
He had the sensation that they were someone he deeply cared about. In his
dream he finally saw the face of the person that pulled him out. " It was
you he said." Keep in mind that same moment was when I "lost train of thought"
and had a strange sensation.</b>
<br><b>We had a son.&nbsp; When he was 4 years old to 7 years old he would
cry hysterically telling us to "Make him stop touching me" This went on
for several years. He is an only child by the way and was alone in the
room when this occurred and always at my Mothers home.&nbsp; He described
the "boy" that had haunted me at the same age. I had NEVER repeat NEVER
told anyone, much less my small son that story.</b>
<br><b>We now live in a home that is aprox. 35 years old. We have a boy
ghost now. I dont know if it is the one and the same (I dont think so)
but he messes with electronics including making vaccum cleaners run without
being plugged in. He loves to "peek" at my husband. This is only in the
hallway and there is a closet at the end that gives me the willies. I never
knew why and never mentioned it.</b>
<br><b>I have also seen my dead grandfather standing in my sons doorway
looking at him. He was his 1st great grandchild and died when he was 2.
Only when my son is ill have I seen him. I havent seen him in 4 years now.</b>
<br><b>I have many premonitions. Always in the form of a dream.&nbsp; Luckily
they havent been too bad. But I am getting more confident now and tell
my hubby when I dream so I have some sort of "proof' that I am not crazy.</b>
<br><b>The most recent being my dearly beloved Memaw passed away this summer
and I miss her badly. In my dream one night she called me and said some
things only she would say. I had such a feeling of peace. I asked her a
question about my sisters new baby. I asked if she could see her, she said
yes she is a living doll. I asked why she hasnt come to me in a dream or
like Papaw(my grandfather) she said it takes time. That we have to get
to a place where we will accept that we have communicated so we can go
on and have peace. I have been at peace ever since.</b>
<br><b>There are so many more, but maybe another time.&nbsp; I really enjoyed
your site and have bookmarked it for future reference. It truly gives me
peace to know I am not alone. Thank you for your time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Prince Street Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: howey@ntl.sympatico.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is the most scariest moment of my life. I'm getting goose bumps</b>
<br><b>right now. I used to live on a small street named Prince street,
from</b>
<br><b>the time I was born until I was about 14 years old.&nbsp; My aunt
lived two</b>
<br><b>houses away from us, when she was little but has since moved away.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>night when I was a boy, my aunt and uncle and cousins, came down
for a</b>
<br><b>visit from the city.&nbsp; We had a big get-together at our house
and started</b>
<br><b>talking about ghosts for some strange reason around our kitchen
table.</b>
<br><b>She began to tell us about when she was younger and living two doors</b>
<br><b>down from us, she began waking up in the middle of the night, wide</b>
<br><b>awake.&nbsp; Suddenly a tall man would appear coming out of the
wall beside</b>
<br><b>the door. She described the man as having a wide brimed black hat,
with</b>
<br><b>black pants and a white shirt.&nbsp; He would walk towards her,
quickly and</b>
<br><b>she screamed and turned on the lights.&nbsp; This happened a few
times, the</b>
<br><b>same thing every time, she would wake up, and immediatley look towards</b>
<br><b>the wall, and sure enough, he'd come walking towards her, staring
right</b>
<br><b>into her eyes, and not looking to happy. She would hide under her</b>
<br><b>blankets and eventually peek out and see him.&nbsp; She said she
was to</b>
<br><b>scared to scream. She kept telling her parents and they told her
she was</b>
<br><b>having a nightmare.&nbsp; Well, her older sister,( who was a highschool</b>
<br><b>dropout, runaway, prostitute), made ammends with her parents and
decided</b>
<br><b>it would be best if she came back to live there.&nbsp; The very
first night</b>
<br><b>that she was there both of my aunt and her sister woke up and looked
at</b>
<br><b>each other, and sure enough, they saw the man come walking through
the</b>
<br><b>wall.&nbsp; They both screamed and there father came running into
the room,</b>
<br><b>he to saw it, and screamed.&nbsp; They turned on the lights and
the man was</b>
<br><b>gone.&nbsp; Their father told them that when they first bought the
house,</b>
<br><b>they filled in the old doorway and made a new one.&nbsp; The man,
being</b>
<br><b>stubborn,came walking through the doorway he built, way back in
the</b>
<br><b>early to mid 1900's.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as soon as my aunt finished telling this
story, our inside</b>
<br><b>porch door slammed open, leaving a small dent in the wall.&nbsp;
There is no</b>
<br><b>way anybody could have been in the porch and slammed the door because
we</b>
<br><b>would have seen them, we were in plain view.&nbsp; I ran into my
room</b>
<br><b>screaming and crying, quickly hiding under the covers, because i'm</b>
<br><b>pretty sure thats the only way to hide from a ghost.</b>

<br><b>My Friends Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pkrob@ipa.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now that I have told mine I want to tell what happened to a close
friend of mine, her husband and their 4 year old daughter (at that time)</b>
<br><b>The little girl starting waking them up every night at 2:45 a.m..&nbsp;
She would be laughing and talking in her sleep. Things like "That is silly
Donald" or "I cant go in there Donald" They immediately thought of Donald
Duck and thought how funny. They soon found out that this wasnt Donald
Duck and this was the complete opposite of funny.</b>
<br><b>One night she had a nightmare&nbsp; in place of the laughter. She
woke</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;them up screaming "DONALDS DEAD !!""over and over. She would
be sweating profusely and her eyes would be glazed over like half awake
and half asleep. They shook her awake until she looked like she could understand
them and said&nbsp; to her "Who is Donald? Where does he live?" She looked
them straight in the eye and said "Down the devil's road" and then fell
into a deep sleep.</b>
<br><b>That was the end, she had no more nightmares and noone mentioned
it again. But to this day it still gives me chills because I know these
people are God fearing folks that would never make something like this
up.</b>
<br><b>Ironically the apartment they lived in has recently been torn down.
It was a small town and a public interest story due to the age of the building.
It was very interesting to discover it had been a doctors office-hospital
in the late 1800s to early 1900's where people went for doctors visits
and even died. It was added onto later in the 1900s until it eventually
evolved into the makeshift apartments in the early 70's.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Feeling Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: msparks@kscable.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My son and I have both felt like there has been something else
in bed with us.You could feel the bed move like someone was getting in
bed. This has happened to me before--while sleeping on my stomach I could
feel something on my backside!!My dog wouldn't even get into bed with me.I've
lived in a house with my family and a "ghost".I saw a shadow of a little
boy on a wall where nothing could have caused&nbsp; it,radio changing stations,cold
spots in sons closet, finally I asked my son who he was talking to and
his response was the ghost!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>Wierd To Me</b>
<br><b>I used to "see appiritions I would like to think they were relatives.At
bedtime the room was full of "people I didn't know".That was fine because
they didn't "bother me"until one night I was poked in my side,and I told
them to leave and never come back.One was my fatherinlaw. At the age of16
I was asleep at my mom's when something furry grabbed my arm trying to
pull me out of bed,I dug my nails in and started clawing its arm to free
myself.I got away,scared out of my mind I woke my mom she told me to say
my prayers.I haven't stopped.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Feelings</b>
<br><b>These things really happened .You never know how people are going

<br><b>My Ghost Ben</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: valerieT@mhtc.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I have a ghost, and his name is Ben.&nbsp; He is 6 yrs. old,
and he likes Limp Bizkit, which is strange, but oh well..I live in a old
apartment building. The building was in a fire. We know that his name is
Ben because he wrote it on the wall with a black pen that my mom and I
can not get off. He also wrote it on a mirror in my living room.&nbsp;
I know I have had experiences with "Ben". My mom had her boyfriend over
one night, and he threw his jacket on our rocking chair. He said that the
chair was going as fast as a bike! My experience happend the same night
when the tem. in my room was 80 degrees. I woke up at about 5:40, and I
felt this coldness coming over me, like it was standing over my self.&nbsp;
It was very strange because it happened the same night! Any ways, thanks
for reading my story! I appreciate it....</b><b></b>

<br><b>Unexplained Incident!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: 196924@one.net.au</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In 1999 I was temporarily working as a maintenance person in an all
boys&nbsp; school in Sydney Australia. The place is the Saint Spiridon
Collage in the locality of Maroubra. It was winter (Summer in the US) at
the time and I started the shift at 5 AM.</b>
<br><b>The morning was very cold and wet from constant raining. I had just
finished picking up a large amount of office paper to be placed in the
large iron bin outside when just Four meters away from the bin the bottom
of the large plastic bag gives in and the whole load is spread across the
parking lot by the wind. To make things worse the sheets of papers stick
to the wet ground spreading to an area of 150 square meters.</b>
<br><b>I went back to the office (just 10 meters away) and when I got back,
to my surprise there was not a single peace of paper anywhere in the parking
lot. I yelled out ""HELLO", thinking it may be a teacher coming in earlier
than usual. There was no reply, just silence and myself in the darkness
wondering what had happened. To make things even more mysterious, the main
gate was open when it was my job to do that. I looked around but there
was nobody in the whole school.</b>
<br><b>The trip from the bin to the office and back again took no more
than Two minutes to make and there was no sounds heard at all throughout
the whole incident. There was no sound of any garbage truck coming in or
of the opening of the large gate. One thing for sure, what ever happened,&nbsp;
was a great help to me because I was running half an hour late than usual.
At the time I was thinking how unlucky I was but Its things like this that
makes one feels good to be accompanied even at the most isolated time of
all. Was it a ghost?, I think so.</b>
<br><b>Thank You Whoever It Was.....</b>
