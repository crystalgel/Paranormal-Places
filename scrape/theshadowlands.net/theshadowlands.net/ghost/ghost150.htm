<b>Wyth House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My girlfriend told me about your web site.&nbsp; I've been through
your site and seen some of the pictures.&nbsp; My story is a little different
and what I saw was a person, not a misting or a cloud.&nbsp; Anyway, I
would like to share my story with you.&nbsp; I actually have two, but one
sticks in my head over the other.</b>
<br><b>I was visiting Colonial Williamsburg in December of 1995.&nbsp;
I visited the Wyth house.&nbsp; It's hard to explain the house, but I'll
do my best.&nbsp; The house is a two story house.&nbsp; Our tour entered
through the back of the house.&nbsp; As we came in we faced the front door.&nbsp;
We toured all 4 rooms downstairs then headed up the stairs that started
by the front door and were located in the middle of the house.&nbsp; At
the top of the stairs, there was man standing there, positioned in front
of one of the rooms at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; He just stood there,
never giving any directions.&nbsp; He was just watching and looking around.&nbsp;
We visited two rooms to the right of the stairs and then visited the two
left rooms, which were connected.&nbsp; It was like one big living room.&nbsp;
As I looked down the length of the room, I saw a figure of a woman standing
near the corner, furthest from the other doorway (back of house) facing
the other entrance.&nbsp; I could see some of her shape, but what was most
amazing, I could see the color of her hair and it was red.&nbsp; It was
long, past her shoulder blades.&nbsp; She seemed to be conversing with
someone.&nbsp; I looked to see who she might be talking to.&nbsp; I couldn't
see anyone else in the room, so I stuck my head back out of the room and
looked down the hall toward the other entrance.&nbsp; There was the tour
guide (who stood at the top of the stairs with his back against the entrance
to that room).&nbsp; There were no words spoken, but I could they were
conversing.&nbsp; I think the ghost realized I saw her and the tour guy
looked back at me with a funny expression.&nbsp; I looked back into the
room,</b>
<br><b>where the woman had been standing, but she was gone.&nbsp; As I
left to go back down the stairs, the tour guide was no where to be found.</b>
<br><b>That afternoon I bought a book called ghosts of Williamsburg and
found there was a woman who had been staying at the Wyth house and killed
herself by throwing herself down the stairs.&nbsp; The woman had red hair!&nbsp;
I never felt strange or uncomfortable.&nbsp; I still question what I saw,
but the more I think about it, the more clear it is in my mind.</b>
<br><b>The second half of my story goes like this.&nbsp; After buying The
Ghosts of Williamsburg book the strangest things started happening, starting
with things dropping around me for no reason.&nbsp; Coming home on a plane
to Seattle, I pulled the book out to read.&nbsp; Strangely we started to
experience turbulence.&nbsp; I put the book away feeling sick and waited
about 10 minutes before reading again.&nbsp; Again, the turbulence hit,
and were stronger than the first.&nbsp; Feeling sick, I put the book away
and the turbulence went away.&nbsp; Then it hit me that something was amiss.&nbsp;
So I tested the universe.&nbsp; I opened the book again...turbulence.&nbsp;
Closed it, it stopped.&nbsp; I said to my sister, "Everytime I open this
ghost book, turbulence start."&nbsp; She said, "For God's sake, put it
away, I don't want to crash."</b>
<br><b>After back to Seattle things would drop all around me for weeks.&nbsp;
I realized something followed me from Williamsburg and it was very disconcerting.&nbsp;
Over a weekend, I went to a shopping area called Gilman Village in Issaquah,
WA. with my Mom and step Dad.&nbsp; This shopping area consists of old
houses that were brought in from all over Washington State and made into
quaint little stores. Anyway, being things were dropping around me I was
careful not to go into stores that displayed glass in them.&nbsp; However,
I did enter a store and as I walked into the front door and walked past
a hutch a huge glass plate dropped from behind me.&nbsp; Thankfully it
didn't break, but scared me and the staff person, who had been standing
by the hutch at the time.&nbsp; She glared at me, like I had purposely
fallen the object.&nbsp; I said, "This damn ghost is following me around
dropping things all around me, I wish it would just leave me alone."&nbsp;
For some odd reason, I left the ghost in the store that day.&nbsp; A year
later I went back into that store after attending Salmon Days Festival.&nbsp;
As I walked into the back of the store, I felt an overwhelming presence
of a ghost and turned around and literally RAN out of the store.&nbsp;
I'll never go back there again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>ESP</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hjay_mercedes@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've have many ESP's.</b>
<br><b>One was in college.I fancied this boy,but he did not fancy me.We
were</b>
<br><b>talking one day.I said was going to get a can of coke.He repeated
this in a</b>
<br><b>wondering thought.I thought why is he doing that.I saw a cloud coming
from</b>
<br><b>his head like you see in the cartoon in comics.Inside the cloud
a hand was</b>
<br><b>sprinkling some white powder into an open can of coke.I brushed
this thought</b>
<br><b>off.Brought the can of coke,and drunk it.On the bus on the way home
I felt</b>
<br><b>light headed.It got worse when I got home.Then I knew I was drugged.This</b>
<br><b>only could of happened in college,and only happened when I had the
can of</b>
<br><b>coke.The image was to warn me.</b>
<br><b>This ESP was the scariest one.I was talking to a group of people
I've just</b>
<br><b>meet through my ex boyfriend.We were talking about the worst accident
which</b>
<br><b>they had.I thought who is going to have the worst accident here.I
transfixed</b>
<br><b>onto this girl I felt,and saw blackness,and felt shocked.After this
feeling</b>
<br><b>went she looked startled looking at me?</b>
<br><b>A month later my ex boyfriend phoned me saying one of the girls
I meet died</b>
<br><b>in a car crash.I wasn't sure if it was the same girl I transfixed
on,but the</b>
<br><b>car crash my ex boyfriend told me about was on the news alias it
was.</b>
<br><b>The last ESP story is about my last boyfriend.We had an argument.I
got</b>
<br><b>upset.When he was asleep.It thought of putting something in his
dream.I</b>
<br><b>thought of being him thinking of this thought.Something that I was
scared of</b>
<br><b>too.To make the ESP link stronger.Suddenly he awoke as if he had
an</b>
<br><b>nightmare.I asked him what it was,he wouldn't say.</b>
<br><b>A few months later we were talking about dreams with his friend.He
started</b>
<br><b>talking about the dream that night.He said he dreamed about a train</b>
<br><b>crash,and out of nowhere this old lady came,and tapped him on his</b>
<br><b>shoulder,and said"Hello.".Which woke him up startled.</b>
<br><b>The old lady is who I thought of my Nan.I used to be scared of her
when I</b>
<br><b>was little.After she had died a few years later when I was a teenager
she</b>
<br><b>haunted me for six months.</b>
<br><b>I've many more ESP's, but less shocking.</b>

<p><b>English Ghosts</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: emma@evarney.greatxscape.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had so many ghostly experiences, that I could not possibly
fit them all into this e-mail, in fact I think I ought to write a book.
One I will relay started when I moved into a new house in Rugby, England.&nbsp;
My friend and I were up late one night when we smelt burnt toast in the
kitchen.&nbsp; We went in and my friend turned to me in the doorway.&nbsp;
As she did, she said, "someone is stood behind me".&nbsp; I felt her back
and it was stone cold, her front was warm.</b>
<br><b>I said "Hello, we will not hurt you, please feel free to stay".
Then all was 'normal' again.</b>
<br><b>Things happened from that point on, such as bottles disappearing
and turning up in places they shouldn't have been.&nbsp; My friend then
got a boyfriend, who visited the house.&nbsp; One morning he said to me,
"Sarah thinks you are fun, did she visit you last night?"I was fascinated
but asked him to tell me no more.&nbsp; All three of us went into my friends
room, and I suppose myself and her boyfriend went into some sort of trance.&nbsp;
As I looked at her room, it began to change, a door appeared in the wall
between our bedroom, and furniture appeared that was not there before.&nbsp;
Then I saw a little girl with brown shoulder length curly hair.&nbsp; Suddenly
she looked frightened, and I heard a crash and a clock tick, then I saw
a dark figure coming through the door, I went extremely hot, and was apparently
pushed up against the wall shouting, stop him, no don;t let him in.My friend
shook me and I came to.&nbsp; After that we kept seeing a dark clothed
figure in the house, wearing a cape and hat which were black, like waterproofs.&nbsp;
He followed my friend alot.&nbsp; She is Catholic, and one night she banished
him outside</b>
<br><b>by saying the hail Mary.&nbsp; There are no trees in the garden,
but there was banging and scratching at the window, and we couldsee the
dark figure outside.We then got in some spiritualists and told them only
that we thought the house was haunted.&nbsp; They said it took a while,
but the had sent a man dressed in black on his way, who was a bit of a
[pervert, and also the little girl with the brown curly hair says look
after her house and she went too.</b>
<br><b>They also told me that I was extremely open to spirits and taught
me how to close off - briefly - to imagine I am in a dark cloak that goes
all over my body, to stop the white light I emit attracting the spirits.&nbsp;
I have had many, many more experiences and have found your site fascinating
to read also.&nbsp; I least I know I am not alone!</b>

<p><b>Elm Street</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: janicer@Princeton.EDU</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was a little girl my family grew up in a house on Elm Street</b>
<br><b>(this was long before the movie).&nbsp; My brother and I are two
years apart</b>
<br><b>and would often be home alone on Friday and Saturday evenings when
my</b>
<br><b>parents would go out.&nbsp; We experienced some very strange things
in that</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Things that my dad would try to explain away with what
he</b>
<br><b>considered a rational explanation.&nbsp; I can remember willing
myself to</b>
<br><b>believe those explanations rather than believe my own eyes and ears</b>
<br><b>because those experiences were so frightening.&nbsp; The frightening
activity</b>
<br><b>was mostly in the basement and the attic.&nbsp; Typical I know but
it's</b>
<br><b>true.&nbsp; On several occasions my brother and I were home and
we could hear</b>
<br><b>very loud banging noises on the cellar door.&nbsp; These noises
sounded</b>
<br><b>exactly like someone trying to get out of the basement.&nbsp; It
was not only</b>
<br><b>the noise but we could actually see the door being pounded on from
the</b>
<br><b>other side.&nbsp; It would last about 45 seconds to a minute and
then stop as</b>
<br><b>suddenly as it began.&nbsp; Our dog Missy would respond in a very
frightened</b>
<br><b>way as well which made us realize that we weren't just imagining</b>
<br><b>things.&nbsp; Another thing that would happen was with the attic
door.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>too would sound as if someone was jiggling the latch on the other
side</b>
<br><b>in order to get out and would just pop open at random.&nbsp; We
would awake</b>
<br><b>to that sound at night or just go upstairs in the afternoon and
find the</b>
<br><b>door wide open.&nbsp; My father tried to tell us this was due to
air pressure</b>
<br><b>on the other side of the door but we knew better.&nbsp; Another
thing that</b>
<br><b>would happen was that my parents would come home at night and my
brother</b>
<br><b>and I would be in our rooms sleeping and they would come in and
yell at</b>
<br><b>us for having the heat turned up so high.&nbsp; All the time this
happened</b>
<br><b>yet my brother and I never touched it.&nbsp; The thermostat would
read 90</b>
<br><b>degrees when this would happen.&nbsp; I just wanted to share that
with you.</b>

<p><b>Childhood Experience</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Cmskobe@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had experiences off and on my whole life. I am
now in my forties.</b>
<br><b>They have'nt been as dramatic as some of the stories I have read
here....but,</b>
<br><b>here goes......</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was @ 8 or 9, I shared a bed w/my little sister,
a toddler at the</b>
<br><b>time. She woke me up one night late, by getting up out of bed. I
watched her</b>
<br><b>in a dream like state, walking down the hallway, from my bed. I
glanced</b>
<br><b>around the room, I was looking at our Santa Claus night light on
the dresser.</b>
<br><b>I had a canopy bed, I also looked at the fabric of the canopy, while
I</b>
<br><b>watched, it wrinkled up on the frame. I could then hear a woman,
or women,</b>
<br><b>laughing. Not a friendly laugh, but , more like a cackleing. Then
it felt as</b>
<br><b>though a giant hand held me firmly into the bed, covering my whole
body. I</b>
<br><b>was being pressed firmly into the mattress. Did'nt hurt, I could
still</b>
<br><b>breath. But, I was VERY scared. Then it felt like something had
stepped down</b>
<br><b>from the canopy, pushing down on the side of the bed, an impression
was being</b>
<br><b>left, like someone stepped onto it, then the floor. Suddenly the
pressure</b>
<br><b>from my body was released. I had been trying to scream all this
time, but</b>
<br><b>,nothing but air seemed to be coming into my mouth, no noise, no
air went</b>
<br><b>out. When I could move I got up and ran, into the hallway, not looking
back.</b>
<br><b>I ran into my parents room and woke up my mom, who told me to go
back to</b>
<br><b>bed..... NO WAY!!!!! I was told that was a dream, I don't think
so. I have</b>
<br><b>had many more experiences, I will share them later, if you accept
this</b>
<br><b>submission.</b><b></b>
