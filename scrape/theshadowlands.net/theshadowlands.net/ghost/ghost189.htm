<p><b>Haunted Playground</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: m.a.lytle@worldnet.att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Last november i was camping with my boyfriend and our friend in an
unlikely</b>
<br><b>spot in the town of buckly washington.</b>
<br><b>It was off in a restricted field out past where my friend lived,
near some</b>
<br><b>houses and ranches. not long after we setteled into our tent did
i begin</b>
<br><b>hearing constant, and very eery sounds of what seemed to be several</b>
<br><b>children, i guess playing, which of course was impossible. There
was nothing</b>
<br><b>out there, it was cold, the middle of the night, bare and deserted.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>quickly askedthem&nbsp; if they heard&nbsp; the same noises, and
they agreed. I was</b>
<br><b>relieved these two macho guys seemed a little unnerved, as to prove
i wasnt</b>
<br><b>imagining things. And i just thank god we were all together, if
i was alone</b>
<br><b>or with anyone else i probably would have gone mad. there is no
way to</b>
<br><b>describe the feeling when you witness something with no earthly</b>
<br><b>explaination, i guess you just have to discover it for yourself.
The sounds</b>
<br><b>continued all night until dawn. The next morning nothing seemed
unusual or</b>
<br><b>creepy, things were nice and peacefull.</b>
<br><b>A couple weeks later when i brought the subject up to the people
i was with</b>
<br><b>that night, they acted irritated when i kept asking them what they
thought</b>
<br><b>it could have been, when they finally told me, that my other friend,
the one</b>
<br><b>who lived on the ranch, had already told us we were camping right
near the</b>
<br><b>old haunted playground...well i missed that!</b>

<p><b>Haunted Daycare</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: daveva@intergate.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>I once worked at a daycare in a very old mansion and I experienced
some</b>
<br><b>incredible events that I will never forget. Once when I locked up
the whole</b>
<br><b>place on a dark autumn night&nbsp; I was putting the garbage in&nbsp;
a bin just</b>
<br><b>outside when I glanced up at the attic window. To my horror there
were</b>
<br><b>flames licking the window&nbsp; and the whole attic was glowing
bright orange. My</b>
<br><b>first instinct was to call&nbsp; 911 but I had a feeling that&nbsp;
I should</b>
<br><b>investigate further. I went back into the building and ran up the
long&nbsp; wood</b>
<br><b>carved staircase to the top floor of the house and as I opened the
door to</b>
<br><b>the attic I suddenly felt very afraid and unsure of my choice to
enter the</b>
<br><b>house alone. Nancy Drew I was not and what the hell was I doing?&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>found an empty dark attic I was a little relieved but somewhat unnerved
that</b>
<br><b>what I had seen was not from this plane of existence. To prove to
myself</b>
<br><b>that I wasn't losing my mind I went home to get my dad and my boyfriend.
As</b>
<br><b>skeptical as they are they both saw the flames and my dad even drove
around</b>
<br><b>the house to see if&nbsp; the light was reflecting from something
else, but there</b>
<br><b>wasn't any lights to be seen. My Dad informed me that about 10 years
ago</b>
<br><b>there had been a fire in the attic and only the attic had burned.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A friend
of mine who worked downstairs was opening up one day</b>
<br><b>when as soon as she stepped in the door all three taps in the children's</b>
<br><b>bathroom turned on full blast. A leaking tap is explainable, but
three at</b>
<br><b>once just as my friend walked in the door was very frightening.
After that</b>
<br><b>my friend seemed to be the target of many spiritual encounters.
I believe</b>
<br><b>some people are more open to this type of energy and therefore act
as a</b>
<br><b>doorway for communication. All the daycare staff had their name
called out</b>
<br><b>by this unseen prescence, but the most spine chilling&nbsp; experience
was when</b>
<br><b>the "lady of the house " finally showed herself. Once again my friend
was</b>
<br><b>the person of choice. She was in the upstairs bathroom which is
a rather</b>
<br><b>foreboding place at the best of times, washing her hands. As she
was</b>
<br><b>washing, she had that chilling feeling that she was no longer alone.
She</b>
<br><b>shut the tap off and as she looked up into the mirror above the
sink she not</b>
<br><b>only saw her own reflection, but the distorted one of what appeared
to be an</b>
<br><b>old woman standing right behind her. The woman"s features were unclear,
but</b>
<br><b>her size and prescence was umistakable.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few other
experiences involved objects flying down a hallway, a</b>
<br><b>missing knife that turned up on a door frame 10 ft off the ground
and once a</b>
<br><b>child was playing outside when suddenly pointed to an upstairs window
and</b>
<br><b>said, "Why is that old lady looking at me?"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often
people have asked us how we worked there, but we never felt</b>
<br><b>threatened and the "lady of the house " seemed to care about the
children.</b><b></b>

<br><b>BAD GHOST</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CERVETJ41@aol.com</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>hi i am 17 and i live in a small town in texas.&nbsp; i have a disturbing
story to</b>
<br><b>tell.&nbsp; well it was disturbing to me since i am the one it happened
too.</b>
<br><b>anyway - one night my freshman year,&nbsp; i was about to fall asleep
when</b>
<br><b>something or somebody woke my up.&nbsp; i was really tired and thought
that maybe</b>
<br><b>i was just seeing things but what i saw was really strange and i
don't know</b>
<br><b>why i would just think something like that up.&nbsp; it was a person,
but i</b>
<br><b>couldn't see it like i could see a living person.&nbsp; it was more
like a mist, a</b>
<br><b>tall mist and i knew it was staring at me. i don't know if it was
a girl or a</b>
<br><b>boy and at the moment when i first saw it i didn't know if it was
bad or</b>
<br><b>good.&nbsp; THEN it appeared over me.&nbsp; it was laying over me,
not on me but it was</b>
<br><b>looking down into my face and i could feel that it wanted something
from me.</b>
<br><b>then i realised that i couldnt' more or breathe so i started to!
panic and get</b>
<br><b>really scared.&nbsp; what happened next was too much.&nbsp; it was
like it was sucking</b>
<br><b>my air out of me.&nbsp; i could actually feel my breath being taken
away then all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden right before i thought&nbsp; i was going to die, it
dissappeared.&nbsp; i</b>
<br><b>jumped from my bed to my door. i ran to my brother's room to make
sure he was</b>
<br><b>ok and everything in his room was fine.&nbsp; then i just sat in
the bathroom for</b>
<br><b>about an hour.&nbsp; then finally i was too tired to stay awake
so i decided that</b>
<br><b>whatever it was was probably gone by now, so i went back to my room
and</b>
<br><b>turned on the light and said out loud that what it did was not funny
and that</b>
<br><b>i knew God was protecting me.&nbsp; then i went back to sleep and
guess what</b>
<br><b>happened next</b>
<br><b>yes you're right it came back.&nbsp; this time it was standing at
the foot of my</b>
<br><b>bed.&nbsp; then it appeared next to my bed. then it started leaning
over me and</b>
<br><b>again i couldnt move or breathe or talk or anything and then i started
saying</b>
<br><b>oh god oh god oh god over and over in my head and then it dissappeared
again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;i jumped across my room again and checked on my brother again
and everything</b>
<br><b>was fine.&nbsp; i stayed in the restroom for another hour and i
know it was really</b>
<br><b>stupid but i actually went back to my room again that night.&nbsp;
nothing</b>
<br><b>happened again.&nbsp; it never came back.&nbsp; but one other experience
i had in that</b>
<br><b>room was a good one.&nbsp; i know it's kindof silly but i asked
if i had an angel</b>
<br><b>in my room and i asked if i did what did he/she want me to call
him/her.&nbsp; and</b>
<br><b>since i wasn't hearing any voice answer me i said ok i am going
to drop this</b>
<br><b>mardi gras neclace on the floor and youare going to make! a picture
with it</b>
<br><b>that shows what you want me to call you.&nbsp; and so i dropped
it and i kept</b>
<br><b>looking at it from different angles and i didn't see anything and
then i saw</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; it was a picture of an angel&nbsp; i was so excited i
took a picture and i</b>
<br><b>have it downloaded on my computer. i will send it to your site later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
one</b>
<br><b>more experience that i have had was in my ex boyfriend's house.&nbsp;
himand i</b>
<br><b>were the only people there and we were in his room just sitting
around and</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden we heard someone run from his living room to his
kitchen.&nbsp; i</b>
<br><b>asked him who it was and he said he had ghosts in his house like
it was no</b>
<br><b>big deal.&nbsp; he's crazy.&nbsp; ok that's all i have experienced

<br><b>Family Tree</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:PDimino@exchange.ML.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a strange tale to tell, It is completely from the memory
of my mother, though it happened to me.</b>
<br><b>Some background first.&nbsp; The house my parents lived in and still
live in is over 100 years old.&nbsp; It originated as a bungalow not far
from the beach in Staten Island, NY.&nbsp; Once the area was a tourist
attraction and a vacation spot.&nbsp; My father great grandfather built
this bungalow and lived there with his wife until they died, the house
then got passed on to my father's grandfather who lived there with his
wife for as long as they lived.&nbsp; My father's father moved out when
he got married and lived about 100 yards away in his own house.&nbsp; My
Grandfather had a gambling problem and when his father and mother past
away their children sold the house and for the money.&nbsp; The people
across the street bought the house, the lower level of the house was a
store and they kept up the store, while living across the street and raising
there our children.&nbsp; The upper portion of the house was converted
in to a pool hall, kind of club house for the neighborhood kids, so long
as they kept out of troub!</b>
<br><b>le.&nbsp; My father used to play pool there with his friends, when
he was about 15 or so.&nbsp; He ended up marring the new owners daughter
some 8 years later and as a wedding gift were given the house by her parents
(my grandparents, my mother was the owners daughter).&nbsp; The house was
fixed up by friends while my father was in Viet Nam and my parents moved
in once he was out of the army.&nbsp; Things were quite in the house, that
is until my sister and I were born.</b>
<br><b>There were a lot of sudden things that happened in the house, things
disappearing and reappearing some time later.&nbsp; The sound of what my
parents referred to&nbsp; as my sister and I walking in our feet pajamas.&nbsp;
They would hear this shuffling sound and open the door from the livingroom
to the kitchen and&nbsp; expect to see us sneaking around while we should
have been asleep, but they would find nothing and the noise would stop.&nbsp;
This was about the extent of the sightings until I was 2 years old.&nbsp;
My other was sick with the flu and my father was at work.&nbsp; My sister
was watching TV in the livingroom with my mother and I snuck off to my
room. The layout is the Livingroom opens to the Kitchen which opens to
me and my sisters bedroom (three rooms in a row).&nbsp; The windows were
the old style that were big enough to be door ways and they one in my room
had been open to let the fresh air in so we wouldn't be breathing in the
germs all night caused by my mothers flu.&nbsp; Next to the window was
a chi!</b>
<br><b>ld's size table and chair set, that I gather I climbed on.&nbsp;
I must have wanted to see what was out the window and so crawled to look
out it.</b>
<br><b>>From what my mother has determined from the babble of a hysterical
two year old;&nbsp; I fell out the window or almost and was picked out
of the air and set back on the floor by nothing visible.</b>
<br><b>When my mother found me I was standing next to the table and chair
set, screaming bloody murder and crying so hysterically their were no tears
and I couldn't move.&nbsp; The only words my mother could get out of me
for a long while was "DO THIS" and gabbing my arm.&nbsp; After hours of
trying to calm me down I managed to get out the story as best as a two
year could.&nbsp; I was out the window and someone gabbed my arm and put
me back on the floor.&nbsp; There was however proof.&nbsp; I three marks
on my arm the size of finger pointy middle and thumb.&nbsp; I was afraid
to go into my room for days and would sleep only with my parents in there
room.&nbsp; I was two and for those of you who have children do you thing
they could act that good and make-up something that incredible.&nbsp; I
was not the storytelling type of child and I didn't scare easy either.&nbsp;
I remember other things happening in the house as a child, but nothing
deep as that.&nbsp; My sister and I had bunk beds and I was on the top
bunk, several nights my p!</b>
<br><b>arents would come in to me crying and find me on the floor having
fell out of the bed, always asleep and never hurt.&nbsp; Things would only
happen now and again and never for any reason.&nbsp; I did however start
to feel as if someone was protecting me from serious harm when ever it
my occur and my room became my place of comfort.&nbsp; I learned when I
was 10 that my great great grandparents bedroom was my room. The house
was original only they three rooms I have mentioned.&nbsp; There in my
room my grandmother took her last breathe.&nbsp; Though I believe she loved
us so much she came back to protect us, especially me, why to this day
I am unsure.&nbsp; The haunting stopped when I was 14 years old.&nbsp;
My parents renovated the house and expanded upwards, removing most of the
old attic with there new bedroom.&nbsp; The day that my father sealed up
the remainder of the old attic all the binds in the house fell at the same
moments five rooms, six blinds all together.</b>
<br><b>Things have been quite, my sister has since moved out and has two
children (one who is 4 and have been know to see things that we cannot,
since he was a baby).&nbsp; I am now 25 years old and recently moved out
and became engaged, my mother say that now that she and my father are alone
in the house they hear footsteps in the old livingroom and my old bedroom,
when they know that no one is in the house with them.&nbsp; They are not
old people, but my mother has been diagnosed with beast cancer and though
now she is in remission, I believe my Great Great Grandmother feels the
need to be present and watch over them.</b>
<br><b>This is not the only ghost I have had encounters with, it seems
there are a lot of people in my family that will not leave us even in death.&nbsp;
My mothers parents too have visited us, also my fathers brother, who died
when my father was still a teenager, from cancer.</b>

<p><b>Odd occurences near a cemetery</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: gwdarby@mindspring.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I live in what I believe is a haunted house.&nbsp;&nbsp; One cemetery
is right beside the house; and another one is ten minutes walking distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We get the so called normal pranks and tricks,&nbsp; like the lights turning
on and off,&nbsp; doors opening,&nbsp; sticking,&nbsp;&nbsp; or closing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But we've had several unconventional things to happen as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One morning when I left the house for work,&nbsp; there was a perfect circle
of cat food cans in the front yard,&nbsp; in about a six foot diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On another occasion there are sounds of something very big and heavy hitting
the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe once,&nbsp; or twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another time,&nbsp; I could swear that I saw the back of an old car as
it backed&nbsp; towards me in&nbsp; my woods.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no
space for a car to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone have similar experiences
?</b>

<br><b>Ghost in Wedding Gown</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: christyana1@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was little we stay at this big , high ceiling old house in
Jakarta Indonesia. since it was so big ,we rent rooms for people. We never
really knew about our house being haunted( I felt strangely scared sometimes
), until some of the people that rent the rooms told us so. some said it
was a giant guy shaking his bed and asked who is his queen , it dissapeared
when he said a prayer, my maid said it was on the stair when she saw this
woman ,&nbsp; some said someone played the guitar he had on his room while
he was sleeping. But we never really feel their presence until we moved
to this house. Nothing special, but my sister said the owner never said
why they moved out.</b>
<br><b>I always get scared when I passed the kitchen area where the stair
for the empty small room for maid was. I can not explain why. One time
I have to get something from that room , since my sister didn't want to
accompanied me I have to go there bymyself. It was bright day, But I was
just so...so scared, I couldn't breath. One night my sister spend the night
at her friend's house so I have to sleep by myself. I put a loud song until
I went to sleep, light was on. Suddenly about 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning,
my maid bursted in to my room and with pale face, Couldn't barely speak,
she said there was a ghost in my sister's wedding gown. the gown look so
big and full withthis ghost in it and she could see her black hair. My
maid was sleeping while my sisters,and her watching TV. My sister left
her wedding gown on the sofa and thought she won't woke the maid. I didn't
know if I should believe her or not , i mean she probably just surprised
that the gown was there when she was awake.But I asked her to grab my rosary
near the door and pray. I let her be there. I fell asleep , apparently
she didn't sleep at all, she woke me up again and told me there was this
shadow moving around just under the door and like someone making noise
with their long nail . and It sounds like this ghost was waiting for us
to come out. We were really,..I mean really scared. I thought I could just
turn on the tape , high volume , so my sisters woke up and save us. But
the tape was just beside the door. So we just wait and wait until the sun
shine. And told my sisters the whole story. She said actually our mom also
seen someone passing her when she knew no body was there, but didn't really
sure, and my 5 months old nephew was just crying one time without any reason.
Not long after that , we moved out.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Stormy Night</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: UnDeLA416@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Outside of the small city of Owensboro, Kentucky is a community
called Utica.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The house where this takes place is now owned my the wealthy
Mike Wilson</b>
<br><b>family.&nbsp; The 4th child John has told of numerous sightings
in this house.</b>
<br><b>The story goes like this:</b>
<br><b>It was a stormy night in November around 1932.&nbsp; The family
who currently</b>
<br><b>owned it had just lost all of their money during the depression.&nbsp;
They were</b>
<br><b>lucky to have enough money to buy their food.&nbsp; The daughter
was about 14 and</b>
<br><b>was known around town as the rich popular girl.&nbsp; Without money
for fancy</b>
<br><b>clothes or maids she was considered a poor girl.&nbsp; She was so
mad and</b>
<br><b>humiliated she decided to hang herself.&nbsp; As she started the
precedure it</b>
<br><b>started to strom.&nbsp; She realized what she was doing and begin
to climb down.</b>
<br><b>As she was loosening the noose a limb swung down, broke through
the window</b>
<br><b>and hit the ladder the girl was standing on.&nbsp; She fell with
the noose around</b>
<br><b>her neck and struggled to her death.&nbsp; On stormy nights in November
in this</b>
<br><b>house, the girl can be heard and seen struggling grabbing at her
neck in the</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; As soon as it stops raining the girl disapears without
a trace.</b>

<br><b>Old Lady</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SlvrPrincess0648@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This story wasn't experienced by me, as I wasn't
even born yet, but by my</b>
<br><b>father who was a young boy at the time.&nbsp; When he was about
9 years old, he</b>
<br><b>lived in a little old house, I believe in Portland, OR.&nbsp; He
told me of many</b>
<br><b>experiences in this house, mainly concerning little things that
always seemed</b>
<br><b>not quite right.&nbsp; If you placed a glass on the kitchen counter,
and turned</b>
<br><b>around to the fridge, when you turned back around, the glass would
be moved</b>
<br><b>to the other side of the counter, or even possibly on the table.&nbsp;
The dryer</b>
<br><b>would myseriously start without any clothes in it, and no one in
that room to</b>
<br><b>turn it on in the first place.&nbsp; Through a little research,
my dad found the</b>
<br><b>house had once been owned by a little old lady, who had died before
they</b>
<br><b>bought it. (not sure if she died in the house or not)&nbsp; The
activity mostly</b>
<br><b>centered around the room my dad's brother had, though he won't tell
me</b>
<br><b>anything about it.&nbsp; The ghost seemed to be a basically friendly
one, without</b>
<br><b>any malicious intents, but one day it took anothe turn, I was told.&nbsp;
My dad's</b>
<br><b>younger sister was standing at the top of the stairs about to go
down when</b>
<br><b>she still swears to this day that somebody pushed her and she came
tumbling</b>
<br><b>down the stairs.&nbsp; None of her siblings stood behind her, and
after that the</b>
<br><b>whole family chose to move.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a smaller note, I live in a house now where
my grandmother came to</b>
<br><b>live with us when she was dying of lou gehrigs disease.&nbsp; She
died downstairs,</b>
<br><b>which some people find very creepy and I have often wondered if
she's stayed</b>
<br><b>behind.&nbsp; My mother has these gold colored wall decorations
that always move</b>
<br><b>position about every month or so, though I would guess that is the
biggest</b>
<br><b>thing to ever happen.&nbsp; Things disappear every now and then
and show up in odd</b>
<br><b>places, and the downstairs closet is ALWAYS partially open when
i get home,</b>
<br><b>even though there's been nobody home to get into it, but nothing
very big.</b>
<br><b>The ony thing that I don't quite get is one day there was a huge
bang from</b>
<br><b>downstairs that I checked out(after I ran out of the house in utter
fear) and</b>
<br><b>didn't come from anything natural.&nbsp; I distinctly don't like
my</b>
<br><b>room(especially my closet) and my brother's room, though that could
be just</b>
<br><b>my own imagination.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that's all I've really got to say...it's
not much and not near as</b>
<br><b>interesting as some others, but it's my own little story :-)</b>

<p><b>Ok, it took me awhile... but with the encouragement of my mother,
I have decided to ignore my husband's extreme skepticism and tell you my
story.</b>
<br><b>When I was approximately 16 (1984), my mother and step-father rented
a house located roughly 15 miles outside of Battle Creek, Michigan.&nbsp;
It was on a somewhat remote highway in between the towns of Olivet and
Battle Creek.&nbsp; It was not an "older" home, per se.&nbsp; If I had
to venture a guess, I would say it was built no earlier than the late 60's
early 70's.</b>
<br><b>First things first.&nbsp; When I was 16, such a fun age for parents,
I had my room decorated with all these "ballet" posters/pictures/art -
each of which I treasured.&nbsp; So, rather than deal with my obsessiveness
re: the safe transportation of my "art", when we were preparing to move
into this new house, my mother decided to let me transfer this stuff first.&nbsp;
The house was completely empty.&nbsp; Not one box had been moved into it
yet.&nbsp; No cleaning materials.&nbsp; No paint.&nbsp; Not even curtains
or blinds on the windows.&nbsp; EMPTY!&nbsp; (believe it or not, this fact
is important).&nbsp; Having explained this, I will now start with the first
"event" and follow it up with everything else.</b>
<br><b>My mother and I came to the EMPTY house with all my posters.&nbsp;
The idea was to put them up on the walls before all the stuff was moved
in.&nbsp; We walked into the house carrying rolled up posters, and a box
of thumbtacks.&nbsp; We went up the stairs to what was to be my bedroom.&nbsp;
We entered and she stood in the doorway as I immediately walked over the
far wall.&nbsp; I turned to ask how a particular poster would look.&nbsp;
Our eyes met briefly and we both looked at the floor in the center of the
room.&nbsp; There, lying in the middle of the floor - which was previously
barren of anything but carpeting - was a 5x7 black and white photograph.&nbsp;
It was a head shot of a smiling - pleasant looking gentleman who appeared
to be about in his middle 50's.&nbsp; The photo looked like it should be
on the back of some hard cover novel with an excerpt "about the author".&nbsp;
We both walked over to the picture and mom picked it up.&nbsp; We commented
on how weird it was - that it definitely had NOT been there when we entered
the room.&nbsp; We turned the picture over and found a name in very neat
handwriting.&nbsp; I do not recall the first name - but the last name was
"ENOCH".&nbsp; This I know because to this day - we refer to our "experience"
as "Mr. Enoch".&nbsp; We laid the picture on the floor until we were finished
with hanging my treasures.&nbsp; Before we left, mom put the picture on
the kitchen counter, downstairs.</b>
<br><b>The picture was still there when we began moving in.&nbsp; For reasons
my mother could not explain, the picture "bothered" her - or "gave her
the creeps" as she put it, so she threw it away.&nbsp; Several days later
- the picture was back on the kitchen counter.&nbsp; My mother didn't think
much of it at the time.&nbsp; She though that maybe my step-father had
pulled it out of the trash - thinking we might have accidentally thrown
out a picture of a relative or something.&nbsp; However, she still didn't
"like" the picture, so she threw it away again and mentioned to her husband
that it was something "left" in the house and not actually ours.&nbsp;
The next day, the picture was back on the counter.&nbsp; Slightly freaked,
but still trying to be rational about an explanation, my mother threw it
away again.&nbsp; However, this time she put it on the very bottom of the
trash bag and put the rest of the trash over it.&nbsp; The picture was
back on the counter the very next day.&nbsp; This freaked her out and she
burned it.&nbsp; End of picture.</b>
<br><b>Other events were beginning to take place that no one ever really
talked about.&nbsp; I did not like being alone in the house.&nbsp; I always
had a weird feeling.&nbsp; I wouldn't describe it as "scared" - but just
the feeling that I was not alone.... actually more like I was being watched.&nbsp;
Especially upstairs.&nbsp; It gave me the strangest "nervous" feeling.</b>
<br><b>My step-father (who only told my mother this under strict confidence
YEARS later) - he never felt comfortable in the house.&nbsp; He won't describe
it any way other than that - other than to say it was not like being "watched"
- but more like he was in danger.&nbsp; When alone at home - he spent any
time he could out of the house - tinkering in the garage - going for walks
on the property - and this was in the dead of winter!</b>
<br><b>Other things happened that we just kind of "ignored" or blamed on
drafts/dreams/forgetfulness/whatever.... Doors would be closed when you
returned to a room that you KNOW you had left open when you exited - or
open when you had closed them.&nbsp; My mother would hear music from a
music box at night when the only music box she owned was locked up at a
rented storage unit.&nbsp; Empty glasses that you left on the end table
in the living room after you went to bed would be 1/2 full of water when
you came into the room in the a.m.</b>
<br><b>And no one was "comfortable" alone in the house.</b>
<br><b>My mother and I are very close - so she can be a little over bearing.&nbsp;
There were more than a few nights when she would come in and cover me up
before she went to bed.&nbsp; I would hear her enter the room and feel
her cover me - or some nights she would just come to the door and watch
me for a while before she would leave.&nbsp; I would just hear her there
in the dark.&nbsp; I never looked at her or spoke to her.&nbsp; I just
assumed it was her, of course.&nbsp; So one morning - being the "cool -
independent" 16 year old that I was, I told her at the breakfast table,
"Mother, I am 16 years old.&nbsp; You do not have to come to my room to
check on me every night.&nbsp; And if I am uncovered, it means I am hot
- so please don't cover me back up".</b>
<br><b>When I returned from school that night, my mother was packing.&nbsp;
We moved within a week.&nbsp; After we moved my mother informed me that
she had never once "checked on me" nor had she ever "covered me up".</b>
<br><b>This was 16 years ago and we tell some people about it but very
few believe us (aka, my husband).&nbsp; I believe and I am comfortable
with it.&nbsp; "Mr. Enoch" obviously took a liking to me - however did
not like my step-father very much.&nbsp; Which is actually quite interesting
within itself... .... details of which I would not mind discussing with
you further but don't want put out for the general public to read.</b>
<br><b>Let me know your thoughts prior to putting this out for everyone
to read.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for your "ear".</b>
<br><b>Your website is wonderful and very captivating.</b>

<br><b>They Follow Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Eric and Jenna [Ericandjenna@home.com]</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child I always thought there was a ghost
in our house. I blamed it on an over active imagination but in the past
6 years I have been rethinking it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved into another house I 1996 when I got
married. From there it was all down hill.&nbsp; I myself never believed
in such a thing but one day "he" walked right down the hall.He didn't even
seem to notice me. it was almost as if he lived there or had somewhere
to be/something to do. He either disappeared in to the linen closet, maybe
the attic opening in the ceiling or maybe into thin air? At any rate, he
was just like in the movies: very much there with features you could see
but still you could se through him as well. Amazingly enough, I was not
freaked out like I thought I should. There was no fear attached with this
encounter at all.Other that the fear my husband had about my sanity.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next encounter was more direct. I was laying
in bed reading a book and I looked up to see him in the hallway. he was
looking right at me. it was brief and he was gone again. There was probably
a good month between the encounters.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he was not very threatening, the thought
of him in the house was scary so we started researching the house and the
area and everything. nothing I saw was terribly interesting but I have
no idea what to look for. We asked the church to have bible study and to
bless the house in general while the were there. they just said a brief
prayer but it was to an exorcism but any means nor did the go in each room
or anything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't get over the thought of him popping
up gain so for safe measures I asked my neighbor to come over and do something.
she is into astrology and what not.&nbsp; WELL....</b>
<br><b>about 3 nights later I was laying in bed and I woke up for some
unknown reason, and our bedroom is in the basement which has a door on
the top of it. I walked up the stairs and on the top step I could se his
shoes. the door was shut but the gap in the bottom is probably and inch
or 2 so there is good light from the upstairs hall. The feeling I had then
as we stood together on the steps was terrifying. I felt totally different
from the first 2 encounters. Next thing I knew I was pushed (by him) down
the stairs with incredible force. And after that I woke up: IN BED!!!!
Did I dream it? surely it didn't actually happen I thought to myself. I
eventually fall back asleep. The next morning I was covered in bruises
and I then knew that whether I actually got out of bed and still including
the fact that I never got back in bed but yet I was in it. I have no doubt
that it through me down my own stairs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it angry about our silly attempts to get
it out? or what?</b>
<br><b>LASTLY: I moved out of that house 2 days later for obvious reasons
but now the same types of weird things are happening here at our new house.
This time it is more electrical and actually things that get misplaces.
Thank Goodness I have not actually seen anything here. But I believe that
once it happens to you once or twice you just know that feeling when one
is near. We are building a new house now and my question is......... Do
you think this thing has been following me my entire life or do they (please
lie to me) usually stay with a house or where ever they are when you fine
them. This is not a subject you can just blurt out to anyone and until
the bruises and the stairs incident my own husband thought I was crazy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His good friend house sat for us once and he
too saw it (we had never discussed this with anyone at that point) and
as silly as this sounds he was up late to pee and there it was in the hallway.
we never told him we had seen it too But at least I know it wasn't just
me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Virgin Mary</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: llyon@earthlink.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>ok i know im a little young for this but oh well,</b>
<br><b>in summer of 1998 my brother, my mom, uncle and aunt went to Canada
for a 2 week vacation. we left on a saturday morning at like 5 for the
flight there. later that day (at my grandmothers house) there was a knock
which my grandma answered. it was a lady who asked if she could place a
statue of the virgin mary in her house to bless it for a week. being all
good and all my grandmother said sure. after a week went by, the lady came
back to take the statue away. when she saw her, (the statue) the lady said,"she
looks so happy there. do you mind keeping her for another week?"</b>
<br><b>and again my grandma said yes.when i got back to her house that
saturday i saw her. i didnt mind too much that she was there but, i asked
and my grandfather told me. when i got up to hug him when (i entered the
room the statue was looking forward so to me it was staring with its face
to my right. i was to its right also) i looked at her, she turned her head
and just smiled at me. after i screamed i ran down the street my grandma
lives on. my uncle had to carry me back to the house. i was still screaming
that the statue looked at mebut my family didnt believe me. my grandfather
called me so i went back to that room and as i was talking to him (he was
sitting right next to it) i saw her again and her hands that were in a
praying state, started to vibrate. i screamed and ran away again. once
more i had to go in that room for another reason. and her whole body started
to shake so instead of screaming, i ran to the kitchen where everyone was
and started yelling, 'its moving its moving!' finally my grandfather took
me to that room and told me: if mary was only moving for me, she must be
blessing me or seeing something special in me. I know this seems far-fetched,
but its whats really happened to me. even now im still too terrified to
even look at a statue that resembles her. and mind you, this stuaue was
made of wood.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Psychic Abilities</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NickGuru@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a child I had some psychic abilities.
My parents would</b>
<br><b>constantly make me show them off for their friends and our relatives.
This</b>
<br><b>usually consisted of telling them what a playing card was before
they turned</b>
<br><b>it over. I had many premonitions that came true.&nbsp; However,
the only part of</b>
<br><b>the whole thing that I liked was the ability to project my thoughts
to my</b>
<br><b>parents. I found that if they had an idea that they thought was
theirs, they</b>
<br><b>would invariably follow through on it. We got to pull over for ice
cream or</b>
<br><b>drinks a lot when I was a kid. They never knew and still don't.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in life, as this ability began to fade,
I began to experience odd</b>
<br><b>happenings. I've always wondered if there was a correlation. I would
see</b>
<br><b>shadowy figures, hear footsteps when I was the only one in the house,
feel</b>
<br><b>someone set down on the bed when nobody was there and all those
kinds of</b>
<br><b>things.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day I was in the living room talking with
my father when the</b>
<br><b>television came on full blast by itself. The controls wouldn't turn
it off or</b>
<br><b>down. When I unplugged it, it stayed on in that condition for several
more</b>
<br><b>minutes then went off as suddenly as it came on. They still have
that TV and</b>
<br><b>haven't had any trouble with it since that time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst experience I've ever had was when I
was about 28 years old. I</b>
<br><b>had just got home to my ground floor apartment from work. I was
sitting on my</b>
<br><b>bed taking off my work boots. I heard a car pull up in the small
parking lot</b>
<br><b>so I rolled over onto my stomach so I could see out the window.
I was</b>
<br><b>watching my neighbors get out of their car when I felt something
grab my arm</b>
<br><b>hard. I turned to distinctly see a very ugly demonic looking creature
with</b>
<br><b>dark leathery skin. He was trying to pull me down a 3 foot wide
hole in my</b>
<br><b>floor and in the earth that hadn't been there 2 minutes earlier.
I was</b>
<br><b>terrified but, when I began to struggle, he and the hole disappeared.
The</b>
<br><b>hand print remained on my arm for several hours. I never spent the
night in</b>
<br><b>that apartment again and I moved out ASAP. I've left out many details
because</b>
<br><b>it's giving me the willies to think about it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't had another experience like that since
that time and that's</b>
<br><b>been about 14 years. I still have the occasional oddity but, nothing
that</b>
<br><b>really scares me.</b>

<br><b>The Footsteps</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CrystalAbts@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story happened just some weeks ago and I would like to share
it</b>
<br><b>with you.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents wanted to go to my Uncles house(my
dads brother) to spend</b>
<br><b>the night and visit.&nbsp; Well anyway, I was bored so I wanted
to go down to</b>
<br><b>the docks for fresh air and goof around like I usally do.&nbsp;
Its not even</b>
<br><b>half a mile to the docks so I walked.&nbsp; It was beatiful outside.&nbsp;
The sun</b>
<br><b>was going down,&nbsp; it was quiet and peaceful and I was enjoying
myself.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>walked on the docks and looked around and played in the snow.&nbsp;
Then I</b>
<br><b>went on the ice, since it was frozen, and was sliding on that.&nbsp;
After</b>
<br><b>that I decided to sit in the snow for a little bit and wach the
sun set.</b>
<br><b>I wasnt sitting really close to the ice, but close around 3 feet
away</b>
<br><b>because there was a patch of water by the shore that wasnt frozen.&nbsp;
So I</b>
<br><b>sat and wached looking around.&nbsp; Then I heard something.&nbsp;
It was coming</b>
<br><b>from the water.&nbsp; As I stared at the patch of water there was
something</b>
<br><b>flapping around in it.&nbsp; It would stop then flap stop, then
flap and so</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; I thought it was a snake so I started to leave, but before
I could</b>
<br><b>I heard something else, way across the ice in the woods.&nbsp; It
sounded</b>
<br><b>like someone was walking on the frozen ground in the small patch
of</b>
<br><b>woods.&nbsp; It isnt that thick so you could see easily in the woos,
but I</b>
<br><b>coudnt see where the sound was coming from and there was no one
there</b>
<br><b>either.&nbsp; So I started walking back to the house getting a little
freaked</b>
<br><b>when I heard footsteps behind me.&nbsp; I turned around, but no
one was</b>
<br><b>there!&nbsp; I started walking faster, but it stayed right with
me.&nbsp; I didnt</b>
<br><b>know what was going on!&nbsp; There was no one there at all!&nbsp;
Finally I made</b>
<br><b>it to the house and was safe.&nbsp; I never knew what was following
me that</b>
<br><b>day, but it hasnt happend to me again.&nbsp; Yet.&nbsp; As for the
water. . . . .</b>
<br><b>I never knew what was in there either.</b>

<p><b>Just Trying to Sleep</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: BudAbbott@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Alex I am now 21 years old and here
is are some experiences</b>
<br><b>I've had. We'll my earliest memory would be laying in my bed at
the age of 8</b>
<br><b>and looking to to foot of my bed to see 3 images of what appeared
to be ghost</b>
<br><b>standing at the foot of my bed. Way to afraid to step foot on the
same floor</b>
<br><b>they are occuping, I had no choice but to lay there and eventually
pulling</b>
<br><b>the covers over my head. My little version of protection at the
time I</b>
<br><b>suppose. As the years went on I would at times hear footsteps make
there way</b>
<br><b>completely across my attic. And to top it off, in my room was the
door to the</b>
<br><b>attic (that was not cool). I'd be at guitar lessons recording my
teachers</b>
<br><b>lessons, to study them later at home. And on the tape while we were
both</b>
<br><b>sitting in the 4x9 room you could hear a screaming of agony. And
these same</b>
<br><b>sounds were recorded at my job. Both tapes are nowhwere to be found.
My most</b>
<br><b>horrifing experiences was the famous night. I went to bad as usuall,
my</b>
<br><b>sister was sleeping over and my mom and sister sleep on one bed
with the 2</b>
<br><b>year pld baby in the middle so she wont roll off the bed. My door
is closed,</b>
<br><b>I wake up at 3:30am to a fairly loud single smack noise to my mattres
right</b>
<br><b>next to my face. I jump up only to have the foot of my bed callapse
5-7</b>
<br><b>inches lower than it was levataing from some force. After the dropping
of the</b>
<br><b>bed my door had swung open 2 feet or so. I hurried and put my light
on</b>
<br><b>thinking it was some joke. I went in my moms bed room to see if
anyone was up</b>
<br><b>all 3 of them were fast asleep. So I sleep on the floor, in my moms
room (yes</b>
<br><b>at the age of 20, I was curled up on the floor in mommys room).
While laying</b>
<br><b>there with my eyes closed I felt so cold suddenly and threw my eyelids
a</b>
<br><b>darker than black color was all I could see. I would not make a
move and I</b>
<br><b>guess I just fell asleep. Thank You for reading my litttle passage</b>
<br><b>unfortunately it was all true.</b>

<p><b>Myrtles Plantation</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PETPIG00@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My Husband and i were touring the Myrtles Plantation in St. Francisville,</b>
<br><b>Louisiana.</b>
<br><b>my husband and I went on the tour of the house with three other
ladies, Whom</b>
<br><b>we did'nt know and as soon as we entered the house it felt sad and
eerie.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was a pretty windy day and a bit on the rainy side.</b>
<br><b>The tour guide wasn't allowed to tell us any Ghost stories or other
"deaths"</b>
<br><b>and strange happenings in the house , only the documented deaths.</b>
<br><b>When we entered the parlour of the house , the double doors banged
open, the</b>
<br><b>tour guide quickly closed them, again they banged open, she then
locked them</b>
<br><b>, with a door frame latch. needless to say they didn't stay closed
for long.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The tour guide just faced the door and said " so we are gonna
do this all</b>
<br><b>day!" matter of factly!! how creepy is that. Well we went on the
tour and we</b>
<br><b>sat down in the sitting room and she told us about one of the documented</b>
<br><b>deaths in the house.</b>
<br><b>Nothing was happening other than that , until I entered the game
room.</b>
<br><b>The very second that I passed through the doorway, I was ILL.</b>
<br><b>I felt hot all over, and it was as it something was holding my chest
so i</b>
<br><b>couldn't breath. I had a tightness in my throat and i was slightly
nauseated.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; All that i could do was move over away from the doorway.&nbsp;
I asked the tour</b>
<br><b>guide , " Is it hot in here or is it just me?"&nbsp; She just gave
me this look</b>
<br><b>like she knew something and then she changed the subject and started
talking</b>
<br><b>about her daughter...&nbsp;&nbsp; No one else felt strange but me!&nbsp;
After exiting the</b>
<br><b>house the tour guide told me&nbsp; the Game room was the Childrens
dining room and</b>
<br><b>that is where some members of the family were&nbsp; poisened (sp?)&nbsp;
Later I talked</b>
<br><b>to one of my friends Tam and she had a similar experience in the
same room,</b>
<br><b>and her tour guide told her that mothers with young children usually
do feel</b>
<br><b>ill in that room.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least i could wait out the tour.
Tam couldn't, she</b>
<br><b>almost passed out!&nbsp; How freaky , Now we want to go back together,
but i don't</b>
<br><b>know if i would go in that room again!</b>
<br><b>Let me know if someone else had this experience at the Myrtles.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for reading , sorry so long.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: glittabug2001@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a true story, so try to believe it, no matter how strange
it may seem. Once when i was only 9 years old, my friend came into my room
and we were playing psychics. I had gotten my mom's tarot cards out and
was laying them out as I had seen my mom do it for fun. I could see that
my friend Jenny was very excited. I picked up one card and said to Jenny,
"You will die young." When she asked me when and how old would she be I
told her that she would be exactly nine years old. I had turned nine two
weeks ago, and Jenny's birthday was three weeks after mine. She shrugged
and asked me how she would die. So I looked at another card and said "You
will be killed by a drunk driver in a car accident while going to you birthday
party." She, you see, was going to her cousins the night before her party.
Jenny shrugged and then laughed. She told me that she didn't believe me.
So we played something different.</b>
<br><b>A week later, on Friday 13th, Jenny l was getting in the car with
her aunt and uncle. She was cheerful and laughing as she sat down in the
backseat. In the middle. She was so busy laughing and joking with her relatives
that she forgot to put her safety belt on. As her Uncle Dave pulled onto
the highway, a yellow car came right towards them. Uncle Dave tried to
brake and was succesful, but Jenny, who wasn't wearing her safety belt
was thrown right through the front window of the car. Uncle Dave and Aunt
Gloria survived, but Jenny didn't.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When the news reached my mom, and she told me all I said was
"I know. I knew this was going to happen before anyone else." My mom didn't
believe me, but asked "Why?" I told her all about the tarot card incident.
By now my mom was terrified. She forbid me to use the tarot cards and burned
them in the fireplace.</b>
<br><b>A year later when I turned ten, I made a new best friend whose name
was Fiona. I suddenely had a feeling that something bad was going to happen.
I quickly ran to a witchcraft store and bought a pack of tarot cards with
my pocket money. I invited Fiona home, and asked if she had ever had her
future told. She shook her head and said that she would like to though.
I lay the cards out in front of me in the Victorian Style bedroom, (my
room was then getting painted, so I had moved into the guest room.) Fiona
sat down on the bed. I picked up a card and told her that she would die
tommorow at school. She would have a bad asthma attack and wouldn't survive.
Fiona just laughed. The next day Fiona started coughing at school. She
got out her asthma inhaler and breathed in deeply. But that didn't help.
She coughed more and more until I ran to get the teacher. Ms. Woodville
came running quickly and called the ambulance. Fiona was rushed to hospital.
A week later, she was fine</b>
<br><b>We remained friends, and still played psychics. This time I picked
up a card )this was back in my old room) and told Fiona that her older
sister Rochelle would die tommorow. Fiona became scared, and quickly ran
home to warn her older sister who was 16. The next day, Fiona had a phone
call from her mom. She went out of the classroom and when she came back,
she was crying. My teacher, Ms. Woodville came to her side and asked what
was wrong. Fiona muttered "My sister's died." grabbed her bag, and ran
outside.</b>
<br><b>At Rochelle's funeral, I met Stacy, Fiona's older cousin who was
interested in witchcraft. She came to my house the next day, and I showed
her my tarot cards. Stacy glanced uncertainly at me and said "This room
is weird. It feels so cold." By that time I had started noticing that something
was wrong too. But I pretended that I didn't hear her. I lay out my cards
and picking one up said "You shall die while walking out of my room." Stacy
screamed, and turned to the door, then stopping. She said that I was a
horrible, sick person. That I had killed two people and wanted to kill
more. I protested and told her that if she went out that door she wouldn't
be normal anymore. She'd be dead. Stacy sat down in a corner and started
crying. She didn't want to die, she had her whole life ahead of her. But
after half an hour she dcided to go out of the room. It was too freaky
in here. So as she walked out of my room, she tripped on my little brothers
toy car, and fell to the floor</b>

<br><b>weeks will share a number of my adventures with you, but the following</b>
<br><b>account is the best of the bunch.</b>
<br><b>I am a massage therapist by profession, but about two years ago,
I took a</b>
<br><b>second job. My position was rehab assistant at a rehab facility
for the</b>
<br><b>blind here in midtown. The residents hall had at one time been the
home for</b>
<br><b>medical students while they attended studies at a nearby medical
facility.</b>
<br><b>The residents hall is made of terra cotta brick. It is six stories
tall and</b>
<br><b>square in shape. There are four apartments on each floor. As you
enter the</b>
<br><b>building, the first two apartments are directly across from each
other. Next</b>
<br><b>to the apartment on the right is a door that opens onto the fire
stairs.</b>
<br><b>At the end of this tower like structure, is the other two apartment
with</b>
<br><b>another fire exit directly at the end of the building. Thus, my
apartment</b>
<br><b>was nestled right next to this exit There was an elevator in mid
hallway. It</b>
<br><b>ran from the basement to the sixth floor.</b>
<br><b>I didn't see a lot of my clients until the morning hours, unless
of course</b>
<br><b>there was an emergency. My night consisted of ruining my kidneys
with ten or</b>
<br><b>fifteen cups of coffee. Desecrating my lungs with fine tobacco,
doing office</b>
<br><b>work, along with other odd jobs and catching a forbidden nap on
the couch.</b>
<br><b>I had been working there for a couple of weeks when I began to notice
odd</b>
<br><b>occurrences. The other apartments&nbsp; in this building were occupied
by staff</b>
<br><b>members of this company. They came and went all through the evening,
but it</b>
<br><b>got pretty quiet around two in the morning.</b>
<br><b>One evening, I was sitting in the living room, transcribing some
material</b>
<br><b>for a student. It was around two thirty A.M. I heard the whine and
clank of</b>
<br><b>the elevator as it made its laborious way from an upper floor to
the ground</b>
<br><b>floor. The door opened and shut without any one exiting the car.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This happened several times a night. There&nbsp; were times
when I would go out</b>
<br><b>to have a smoke and actually hear the elevator button be punched.
The car</b>
<br><b>would arrive and no one would enter or exit. Needless to say, my
smoking</b>
<br><b>increased on nights that this happened.</b>
<br><b>Many times I would nap on the couch and would go in to a strange
state. My</b>
<br><b>hearing would be heightened immensely. I would hear the mumble of
many</b>
<br><b>voices. The words were unintelligible. I felt a sense of unease
and the</b>
<br><b>building seemed to drain my energy.</b>
<br><b>Some times the computer which is modified with speech compatible
software,</b>
<br><b>for the blind, would start to talk even though the room was empty.
I knew</b>
<br><b>that there were spirits in the building and tried to communicate
with them</b>
<br><b>to no avale until one night.</b>
<br><b>Often when on the couch in a state of paralysis, I would feel the
building</b>
<br><b>literally shake as in the aftermath of an explosion. The elevator
would come</b>
<br><b>to demonic life running its idiot course from floor to floor. I
would hear a</b>
<br><b>door open on an upper floor and hear and feel the vibration of running
foot</b>
<br><b>steps. They would run the length of the building, entering the fire
stairs</b>
<br><b>at the front of the building on roughly the fourth floor. They would
run</b>
<br><b>down the stairs to my floor, crashing open the door, running the
length of</b>
<br><b>the building and back on to the other set of fire stairs near my
apartment.</b>
<br><b>They would run back upstairs to the fourth or fifth floor, go through
the</b>
<br><b>stairs, run about half way down the hall, and then just stop. You
wouldn't</b>
<br><b>hear an apartment door open or close.</b>
<br><b>This went on for a few weeks and I was greatly intreagued by these</b>
<br><b>happenings. This usually occurred around three to four in the morning.
It</b>
<br><b>seemed to occur on evenings when it was overcast or quite humid.</b>
<br><b>One evening, I transcribed a cook book for a client and around three
in the</b>
<br><b>morning I went out for coffee and a smoke. I went out the fire door
by my</b>
<br><b>apartment and down the stairs where there is a landing. I opened
the door</b>
<br><b>that leads out side and seated my self on a radiator adjacent to
the door.</b>
<br><b>It was quiet, the hum of the florescent light seemed loud in the
stair well.</b>
<br><b>The far off sounds of a train and other industrial sounds, along
with an</b>
<br><b>occasional car passing were all rather common place but some how
reassuring.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly I felt the vibration of running foot steps far above me.
I thought</b>
<br><b>with a sense of mingled dread and expectation, now, I finally get
a chance</b>
<br><b>to meet this deranged nocturnal individual. I wasn't to be disapointed.
It</b>
<br><b>came racing down the stairs and must have been thrown off by my
unexpected</b>
<br><b>presence.</b>
<br><b>Instead of going through the fire door and then down the hall to
the other</b>
<br><b>end of the building, it ran down the stairs and right past me. Its
momentum</b>
<br><b>carried it about six feet out the door. A&nbsp; freezing blast of
air was in its</b>
<br><b>wake. I sat rivoted to the radiator wondering if I was going to
have to do</b>
<br><b>hand to hand combat.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Briefly, I entertained the idea of kicking the door shut,
but there was a</b>
<br><b>heart felt feeling, that this could be a very bad idea. It pivoted
and came</b>
<br><b>dog trotting back in to the building. As it passed me by only inches,
to</b>
<br><b>spare, I felt that frigid blast of air again. At the top of the
stairs, it</b>
<br><b>turned and regarded, with an almost palpable molevolence, radiating
from it.</b>
<br><b>I could hear no breathing.</b>
<br><b>I said in my best Eastwood immitation, Hi, my name is Brian, I work
with the</b>
<br><b>visually impaired people in the building, what's your name. There
was a</b>
<br><b>pause of about three seconds, then his erie reply, floated across
the</b>
<br><b>distance between us. My name is Alan.&nbsp; What apartment do do
you live in,</b>
<br><b>said I.</b>
<br><b>I just stay with some people in the building, was the vague reply.
There was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;about the whole area, such an out pouring of negative and
confused energy</b>
<br><b>that I found it quite disorienting. It almost didn't seem real.
I was</b>
<br><b>getting ready to fire off another berauge of questions but it turned
away</b>
<br><b>and mounted the stairs in that relentless ground covering dog trot.</b>
<br><b>Around the fourth or fifth floor it entered the main part of the
building. I</b>
<br><b>waited to hear an apartment door open or close. Silence reigned
supreme.</b>
<br><b>I made my way in an almost trance like state back to my apartment.
I am</b>
<br><b>usually able to keep feelings for the need of my vision at bay,
but I would</b>
<br><b>have given damned near any thing to know what I confronted that
night. One</b>
<br><b>thing I am sure of, is that it wasn't from this world. Furthermore,
it</b>
<br><b>didn't dig having its routine jacked with.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have talked with many people in the building who have heard the
elevators</b>
<br><b>running, with no passengers aboard. They have also heard the running
foot</b>
<br><b>steps and slamming doors. One of my co workers was a little woman
from</b>
<br><b>Honduras, she says the building is purely evil and that many people
have</b>
<br><b>died there.</b>
<br><b>As yet, I haven't researched this location. I will up date this
story when I</b>
<br><b>do. If there are any brave soles out there who want to investigate
this</b>
<br><b>building with me, I can be contacted at my e-mail address. I love
your web</b>
<br><b>site and know that it provides comfort and reassurance to a lot
of people</b>
<br><b>who need their experiences clarifyed and or validated. Thanks for
your time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Jim River Adventure</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bnash@kc.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I sent you a story a few days ago, and as the snow falls here in
Kansas</b>
<br><b>City, I am taking the opportunity to send you another one. My name
is Brian</b>
<br><b>and I have been blind since birth. I have had a number of paranormal</b>
<br><b>experiences of which this is one of the best.</b>
<br><b>My mother's family are natives of South Dakota.&nbsp;&nbsp; We bought
the dairy farm</b>
<br><b>from my grandma, after my grandfather's death in the late nineteen
sixties.</b>
<br><b>For many years we rented the farm out to a family who were in the
dairy</b>
<br><b>business, and we share cropped the land on which was raised corn,
alfalfa,</b>
<br><b>along with other types of grain an hay. The wife of the dairy farmer
died a</b>
<br><b>few years ago. From then on the dairy operation was closed down
and we</b>
<br><b>continued to share crop the land to other farmers.</b>
<br><b>My mom and dad would go up to the farm in the summer and spent many
a happy</b>
<br><b>year there. The farm is beautiful with a lot of rolling hills that
gradually</b>
<br><b>slope down to the James river which runs through the border of our
property.</b>
<br><b>I know my way around certain areas of the farm, but it is easy to
get lost</b>
<br><b>since it spans four hundred acres of ground. In nineteen ninety
two, we</b>
<br><b>decided to spend some time with my parents on the farm. My two sisters,</b>
<br><b>their boy friends and my self, packed our bags and hit the road.</b>
<br><b>For the first couple of days we visited with the folks a lot. We
ate grand</b>
<br><b>meals of fried chicken and fresh produce. We took long walks on
the property</b>
<br><b>and gravel roads around the farm. In the evenings we would sit on
a large</b>
<br><b>hill named by my grandfather years ago. He called it Hine's peak
after one</b>
<br><b>of his favorite work horses who liked to stand up there after working
in the</b>
<br><b>fields all day. A wonderfully cool breeze was always present on
the</b>
<br><b>magnificent hill. I was told the view was incredible. You could
see the</b>
<br><b>lights from Mitchell which was some fifteen miles away. There was
also a</b>
<br><b>great view of the river.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;After a couple of days of R and R, I decided it was high time
to do some</b>
<br><b>fishing in the James river. We called it the big Jim. We packed
up our</b>
<br><b>fishing gear and arrived at the Jim around six in the evening. The
next</b>
<br><b>couple of hours were spent catching catfish, white bass&nbsp; and
carp. I was</b>
<br><b>busy helping my sisters bait hooks and casting their lines into
prime spots.</b>
<br><b>As darkness fell on the river, several frogs began a happy summer
serinade.</b>
<br><b>A couple of big owls started talking to each other, in the trees
along the</b>
<br><b>river bank. I casted my line in close to the bank , knowing the
juicy night</b>
<br><b>crawler would probably attract a catfish.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, my rod was almost torn from my hand, and I set the hook
with</b>
<br><b>lightning speed.&nbsp; The drag began to whine as the fish engaged
in a fight for</b>
<br><b>his life.</b>
<br><b>In a few minutes I had him close to the bank. I could tell from
the</b>
<br><b>splashing that he would weigh in at fifteen or twenty pounds. My
sister's</b>
<br><b>boy friend raced to the lip of the riverbank and grabbed the line</b>
<br><b>enthusiastically. This proved to be a winning situation for the
fish. It ran</b>
<br><b>toward deep water and snapped the line like a twig, as the use of
the drag</b>
<br><b>was ineffective. Any of you fisherman out there, know the sting
of defeat</b>
<br><b>when such a thing happens.</b>
<br><b>Not long afterwards, a humming cloud of mosquitoes ascended on us.
We packed</b>
<br><b>up our gear and grabbed a healthy stringer of fish from the river
and headed</b>
<br><b>home. After cleaning and freezing the fish, we retired to the house
for some</b>
<br><b>dessert.</b>
<br><b>Earlier that day,we had gone to what we call the colony. Years ago,
a great</b>
<br><b>number of people immigrated from Russia to our country. Many of
them settled</b>
<br><b>in south Dakota and set up colonies of hundreds of people, living
together</b>
<br><b>and working for the common good of the colony. They own thousands
of acres</b>
<br><b>near our farm and are wondrful farmers. The produce they grow is
incredible.</b>
<br><b>They grow the best sweet corn in the world.</b>
<br><b>They have in the middle of their compound a little store where the
locals</b>
<br><b>can buy whatever is in season at the time. One of the purchases
of the day</b>
<br><b>was an apple pie of such monumental porportions it was mind boggling.
This</b>
<br><b>pie must have weighed a good ten pounds. We sat around the table
chattering</b>
<br><b>about the fun time at the river and me razzing Mike about the catfish
we</b>
<br><b>lost. Mom was busy dishing up apple pie and ice cream. We were served
and</b>
<br><b>all fell quiet as we began to eat.</b>
<br><b>The pie fell sadly short of my expectations. The crust was heavy
and doughy.</b>
<br><b>The apples and filling were tart and who ever made the pie went
light on the</b>
<br><b>sugar. It hit your stomach with the weight of a wrecking ball striking
a</b>
<br><b>building for demolition. None of us were impressed and I think we
were all</b>
<br><b>secretly glad when the ordeal was finished.</b>
<br><b>Not long after, we made our respective beds and fell in to them
happy and</b>
<br><b>exhausted. I had a hard time falling to sleep, the pie was riding
me like a</b>
<br><b>cowboy on a bucking horse. My mind was filled with thoughts of the
catfish I</b>
<br><b>had lost some hours earlier. Soon I drifted in to restless sleep.</b>
<br><b>Then the dream began. I was on the river bank and replayed the experience
of</b>
<br><b>catching the mighty catfish yet again. But this time when the line
broke, it</b>
<br><b>wrapped around my neck in a lethal fashion and started to strangle
me. I</b>
<br><b>couldn't move. My arms weighed a ton and I knew that death was near.
I</b>
<br><b>fought my way back to consciousness and realized that I couldn't
swallow. I</b>
<br><b>leaped to my feet my heart racing like a trip hammer. I struggled
to the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, and desperately poured a glass of water. As I drank it,
life came</b>
<br><b>flooding back to me..</b>
<br><b>Contemplations of going back to bed were banished from my thoughts
as the</b>
<br><b>spector of the apple pie loomed ominously on my mental horizon.
I grabbed a</b>
<br><b>pack of smokes from the side bar and padded quietly out side, easing
the</b>
<br><b>screen door shut behind me. The night was glorious. It was still
quite warm,</b>
<br><b>probably in the upper eighties which is rather unusual being so
far up</b>
<br><b>north.</b>
<br><b>My thoughts turned inexorably to the fish I had lost earlier and
I knew I</b>
<br><b>must redeem my self.</b>
<br><b>I went to the house dressing quickly and grabbing my favorite pair
of boots.</b>
<br><b>I then, went to the garage and got my favorite fishing pole and
a bucket of</b>
<br><b>night crawlers. A couple of cold beers completed my list of essentials.
I</b>
<br><b>walked quietly down the driveway and soon gingerly picked my way
across a</b>
<br><b>cattle guard. The wind softly sighed in the tall grass bordering
the road.</b>
<br><b>The far off call of an owl was followed by the yipping of a pack
of coyotes.</b>
<br><b>I smiled in satisfaction, knowing that when the animals are so active
that</b>
<br><b>the fish would be biting well.</b>
<br><b>I walked on the left side of the road, tapping the ground lightly
with my</b>
<br><b>fishing rod every ten or fifteen feet, so as to find the trail leading
down</b>
<br><b>to the river. After about a quarter mile, I was rewarded when I
tapped a</b>
<br><b>wide smooth spot.</b>
<br><b>I turned left atnd started striding confidently down the trail.
My</b>
<br><b>confidence evaporated when I heard the soft but constant sounds
of grazing</b>
<br><b>cattle. It was a large herd of holstein cattle and the herd was
made</b>
<br><b>complete by a large and aggresive bull. Undaunted I continued down
the</b>
<br><b>trail, walking so quietly I could hardly hear my own foot steps.
Soon I was</b>
<br><b>among the cattle. They continued to graze as if I weren't there.
I prayed I</b>
<br><b>wouldn't run into one of them. I fought off catastrophic thoughts
of having</b>
<br><b>to run from them. If I wasn't careful, I would fall in the river
as the</b>
<br><b>river bank is at the end of the trail.</b>
<br><b>Soon I was passed the cattle and I slowed with caution. Soon the
fruits of</b>
<br><b>my labor were rewarded, as I came to the end of the trail. The edge
of the</b>
<br><b>river bank was over grown with weeds just a little taller but denser
than</b>
<br><b>the grass.</b>
<br><b>I quickly baited my hook and cast my line about ten feet out from
the shore.</b>
<br><b>Catfish come in to the shallow water to feed at night.</b>
<br><b>I opened a beer and was congratulating my self on the way things
were going,</b>
<br><b>thus far. As I sat quiet, I felt the air temperature begin to drop.
Then I</b>
<br><b>heard the rumble of not so far off thunder. My attention snapped
back to my</b>
<br><b>fishing as something tried to tear the pole from my hand. It was
so big it</b>
<br><b>almost pulled me from the edge, as I sat with my feet dangling over
the lip</b>
<br><b>of the bank.</b>
<br><b>I fought the fish with all the skill of thirty years of experience.
Soon I</b>
<br><b>had it close to the bank, I scrambled down the treacherous bank
and stood at</b>
<br><b>the edge of the river. I brought the fish closer, I grabbed it through
the</b>
<br><b>gills. In supreme disgust, I realized the fish was the biggest carp
I had</b>
<br><b>ever caught. It was over three feet long, it weighed about twenty
pounds. I</b>
<br><b>put it on a stringer and after securing it to a log, returned to
my former</b>
<br><b>spot and rebaited. my hook.</b>
<br><b>A few fat cold rain drops began to fall. I soon had another bite
and was</b>
<br><b>fighting another fish as it began to rain harder. This time when
I went over</b>
<br><b>the bank to land the fish, I could feel the river rising, the current
was</b>
<br><b>picking up.&nbsp; I landed a fifteen pound catfish and added him
to his companion</b>
<br><b>on the stringer.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I almost fell in the river as I tried to make my way up the bank.
I was</b>
<br><b>soaked with water and my teeth began to chatter uncontrollably.
But fishing</b>
<br><b>was so good I couldn't bear&nbsp; to leave. I recast my line and
waited in</b>
<br><b>huddled misery as the rain fell in buckets. A tremendous clap of
thunder</b>
<br><b>shook the ground and the smell of ozone filled the air. There was
a mighty</b>
<br><b>crash followed by a tremendous splash, about fifty feet to my left.
I knew</b>
<br><b>that lightning had struck one of the big cottonwoods on the bank.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Lightning is nothing to play games with. I have been struck&nbsp;
but that is</b>
<br><b>another story. I laid my fishing pole on the ground as not to attract
any</b>
<br><b>unwanted electrical activity. I snatched it back as something tried
to drag</b>
<br><b>it toward the river with a vengence. I landed another carp about
three</b>
<br><b>minutes later. It weighed about ten pounds.</b>
<br><b>The rain started to slack off. As it subsided, a swarm of deer flies
came</b>
<br><b>out and I thought this strange as it was probably four or five in
the</b>
<br><b>morning. I eased carefully down the bank and grabbed the stringer
of fish,</b>
<br><b>in preparation to leave. I tied the stringer of fish to my belt
and pulled</b>
<br><b>it behind me as it was to heavy to carry along with all my other
equipment.</b>
<br><b>The thick rich dirt of the river bottoms of the Dakota's become
like gumbo</b>
<br><b>after the rain had subsided. Soon the return trail played out, I
realized to</b>
<br><b>my horror I was lost. I walked on hoping for a miracle. I heard
a rooster</b>
<br><b>crow in the distance and knew morning was fast approaching. I wanted
to make</b>
<br><b>it home on my own steam so to speak. If the family got up and found
me</b>
<br><b>absent they would</b>
<br><b>come looking for me which would be humiliating.</b>
<br><b>Soon I began to trek through thick grass, and tree limbs began to
claw at</b>
<br><b>me. I slowed and reached out in front of me to find a barbed wire
fence. I</b>
<br><b>followed it for about a half a mile. Now I was becoming really disoriented</b>
<br><b>and the fish I was pulling behind me seemed to weigh a ton. MY ego
was</b>
<br><b>suffering from the rancor of being lost on my own farm.</b>
<br><b>I came to a hedge row made up of small but wickedly thorny trees.
I ran into</b>
<br><b>one and scratched my face and forehead. I stood ,shoulders slumped
forward,</b>
<br><b>a perfect study of dejection.</b>
<br><b>Then I heard a voice. It came on the breeze clear as a bell. "Brian",&nbsp;
was</b>
<br><b>the only word that was uttered. It came from a location approximately
a</b>
<br><b>hundred feet off to my left.</b>
<br><b>My grandpa died when I was only five and my memories of him have
dimmed with</b>
<br><b>time. However, I know it was him that spoke to me. I continued on
in the</b>
<br><b>direction the voice had come from and soon to my amazement was standing
on</b>
<br><b>the trail leading back to the road. Luckily, the cattle had gone
to graze</b>
<br><b>else where. The rest of my homeward journey was blessedly uneventful.
I</b>
<br><b>walked in to the farm yard around seven thirty by my braille pocket
watch.</b>
<br><b>By this time I was carrying the stringer of fish triumphantly. I
walked to</b>
<br><b>the back door. I wrapped smartly on it with a wet and muddy hand.
My mom</b>
<br><b>soon opened the door. She regarded me in stunned silence.</b>
<br><b>Then she said that she had gotten up a few minutes before not to
find me on</b>
<br><b>the couch. Knowing me all to well, she figured that I had gone to
the river</b>
<br><b>to fish. I dropped the fish on the grass made soft by the rain.
I was so</b>
<br><b>muddy and bedraggled I left my clothes outside and came in clad
only in my</b>
<br><b>underwear. Then to my embarrassment pictures were being taken of
me.</b>
<br><b>Imagine this, my family is so into photography, even I like to take
pictures</b>
<br><b>of people and places. I am probably the only blind photographer
if the</b>
<br><b>world. I told my story to the family, seated at the table, drinking
one cup</b>
<br><b>of hot coffee after another.</b>
<br><b>I omitted the time when I heard grandpa calling my name, I didn't
think they</b>
<br><b>would believe me. But when I look down through the years at this
momentous</b>
<br><b>night, it is time my dear grandpa is given full credit for getting
me home</b>
<br><b>that morning.</b>
<br><b>Since this event, my dear mom has passed to the other side and we
don't get</b>
<br><b>up to the farm much any more. I have a picture of the fish I caught,
and</b>
<br><b>will send it along if I can find it. When ever I hear distant thunder,
it</b>
<br><b>always puts me in mind of a mystical night when my grandpa came
back from</b>
<br><b>another land to get me home safely.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for your time and keep up the great work.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Punk Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:sandwitch_1999@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When I was 19, I used to frequent a sort of</b>
<br><b>"underground" club in Amarillo, Texas, where punk</b>
<br><b>bands from all over the country would come and play.</b>
<br><b>It was a place for "the freaks", where you could watch</b>
<br><b>a band or see an art exhibit by local artists.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>night while I was watching a band, I met a kid named</b>
<br><b>Brian.&nbsp; He looked pretty normal at the time, except, I</b>
<br><b>guess, for the safety pin in his cheek!&nbsp; He was really</b>
<br><b>nice and only about 15 years old.&nbsp; I would see him at</b>
<br><b>all these shows and he was always so friendly and</b>
<br><b>would give me a hug.&nbsp; Eventually, the club shut down</b>
<br><b>and I rarely saw Brian, but over the next few years</b>
<br><b>his look became more extreme.&nbsp; One time, he had a red</b>
<br><b>and black mohawk and wore a leather jacket with studs</b>
<br><b>and a studded dog collar around his neck.&nbsp; A Dead</b>
<br><b>Kennedys shirt and combat boots would complete the</b>
<br><b>look.&nbsp; This look intimidates alot of people (I</b>
<br><b>personally always thought it looked COOL and only</b>
<br><b>wished I had the nerve to look that way myself!), but</b>
<br><b>Brian was always so friendly that you just couldn't be</b>
<br><b>freaked out by him.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, to make a long story a little shorter, I saw</b>
<br><b>him last in 1997 and he was all grown up (19 years</b>
<br><b>old) and had a bright green mohawk and was as sweet as</b>
<br><b>ever.&nbsp; A couple of weeks later, he was run over in a</b>
<br><b>parking lot after a fight between "the punks" and "the</b>
<br><b>jocks" broke out.&nbsp; He died (horribly, from all</b>
<br><b>reports) in his brother's arms.&nbsp; I was at a friend's</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; She had been with me last time I saw him and</b>
<br><b>was so glad to meet him because I always talked about</b>
<br><b>him.&nbsp; Her stepfather was watching the news and we</b>
<br><b>heard Brian's name, so we ran in there to see what</b>
<br><b>they were saying.&nbsp; I just couldn't accept what they</b>
<br><b>were saying, that he was dead.&nbsp; We were numb the rest</b>
<br><b>of the night.</b>
<br><b>When my friend took me home that night, I was walking</b>
<br><b>up to my door and I thought to myself, " Brian,</b>
<br><b>wherever you are, I just hope that you're okay."&nbsp; All</b>
<br><b>of a sudden, there was a shooting star, just as I</b>
<br><b>finished my thought!&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; Maybe it is, but I</b>
<br><b>took it as a "sign".&nbsp; That night, I was laying in bed</b>
<br><b>thinking about him and wishing I had seen more of him</b>
<br><b>recently and wishing I knew more about him.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>slept, I had another of my vivid dead-people dreams,</b>
<br><b>which I talk about in the story titled "Aunt Theresa",</b>
<br><b>also on this site.&nbsp; I didn't talk to him, but a</b>
<br><b>biography had ben written about him and it told all of</b>
<br><b>these things about him.&nbsp; In the next few weeks, I</b>
<br><b>found out that some of these things were actually</b>
<br><b>true.</b>
<br><b>I have dreamed about him off and on since that time.</b>
<br><b>In August of 1999, the guy who murdered him went on</b>
<br><b>trial.&nbsp; He was a "jock", and I guess his family had</b>
<br><b>connections or something.&nbsp; They basically put Brian on</b>
<br><b>trial, rather than the guy who ran over him on</b>
<br><b>purpose!&nbsp; The guy got off with a manslaughter</b>
<br><b>conviction and 10 years probation.&nbsp; I had</b>
<br><b>half-expected it, but was still beside myslf with</b>
<br><b>grief and rage.&nbsp; When I slept that night, I saw Brian</b>
<br><b>and he held me in his arms for a long time and I just</b>
<br><b>got the feeling that he was saying "It's alright".</b>
<br><b>When I woke up I felt more at peace with the whole</b>
<br><b>situation.</b>
<br><b>I guess it is ridiculous that I think I communicate</b>
<br><b>with this guy that I wasn't very close to, but my</b>
<br><b>dreams of him always leave me feeling happy and</b>
<br><b>peaceful.&nbsp; I am SURE that there is more to it.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, as far as another experience with a closer</b>
<br><b>friend....This story was relayed to me by someone</b>
<br><b>else, so I don't know the details or how much of it is</b>
<br><b>hearsay.&nbsp; There is a couple from the "freak" scene</b>
<br><b>that are married and one of their friends told me</b>
<br><b>this.&nbsp; The woman was pregnant when Brian was killed</b>
<br><b>and gave birth sometime shortly after.&nbsp; She and her</b>
<br><b>husband lived in, I think, an upstairs apartment, and</b>
<br><b>Brian's brother lived in the downstairs.&nbsp; All I</b>
<br><b>remember being told is that the woman was feeding her</b>
<br><b>son or putting him to bed one day and she felt a hand</b>
<br><b>on her shoulder, like when a person comforts you.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>there was nobody there!&nbsp; The person who relayed this</b>
<br><b>story to me said that they thought that it was Brian,</b>
<br><b>checking on his friends and their new baby, and his</b>
<br><b>brother who lived downstairs.</b>

<br><b>My Personal Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ShellyBHarper@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I feel knida silly about writing this, but why not.</b>
<br><b>As long as I can remember I've always "known" things, just like
my father.</b>
<br><b>When a terrible tragedy happens I tend to have "a feeling" just
before it</b>
<br><b>happens (like with the Oklahoma bombing and the shooting in the
Colorado high</b>
<br><b>school).&nbsp; The same wierd things have happened to both my father
and I in the</b>
<br><b>house I grew up in (my mother and younger brother are a bit more
skeptical).</b>
<br><b>We have often seen things coming out of the master bedroom from
the corner of</b>
<br><b>our eyes.&nbsp; At one time both of us saw the same thing by the
back door from</b>
<br><b>different rooms.&nbsp; Once I swear that I saw my mother come from
her room and</b>
<br><b>disapper behind a wall only to see her come out of her room again
just two</b>
<br><b>minutes later.&nbsp; My father often sees things in the kitchen,
like a black mass</b>
<br><b>floating about.&nbsp; The only encounter that I have had in there
was one night</b>
<br><b>when I was washing my hair in the kitchen sink and I felt my dog
put her</b>
<br><b>cold, wet nose to my leg.&nbsp; Turning around to push her away
I found that I was</b>
<br><b>alone.&nbsp; Quickly I grabbed the towl and left.&nbsp; Another
time my family and all</b>
<br><b>pets were outside hanging out together enjoying the warm weather
right about</b>
<br><b>sunset.&nbsp; I went inside to get something from my room and while
I saw in there</b>
<br><b>something happened.&nbsp; The room was mostly dark and the light
from the living</b>
<br><b>room cast a shadow along the bedroom door.&nbsp; While standing
in the bedroom,</b>
<br><b>out of the corner of my eye I saw a shadow (shaped like a bent arm,
elbow</b>
<br><b>first) come out of the larger shadow along my door.&nbsp; I turned
my head and</b>
<br><b>looked straight at it.&nbsp; Still there!!&nbsp; All alone, I knew
that to get out of</b>
<br><b>the house I'd have to run in the direction of where it came from.&nbsp;
Well, I</b>
<br><b>made it out alright.&nbsp; The biggest thing that happened to me
was in June of</b>
<br><b>'91.&nbsp; I was sleeping in my room one Saturday morning and my
brother came to</b>
<br><b>wake me up.&nbsp; We were to go looking for a kitten to adopt.&nbsp;
I didn't like the</b>
<br><b>idea of him waking me up on a Saturday morning and after exchanging
a few</b>
<br><b>words with each other he left and I tried to go back to sleep.&nbsp;
About two</b>
<br><b>minutes later I "felt" someone come into my room.&nbsp; Thinking
it was my brother</b>
<br><b>I told him to leave me alone.&nbsp; The presence kept getting closer
and closer to</b>
<br><b>my backside to the point that it leaned on my bed causing me to
roll</b>
<br><b>backwards.&nbsp; I tried to hit whatever it was with my arm but
kept missing it.</b>
<br><b>I turned around only to find no one was there, or in my room for
that matter.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Everything stopped.&nbsp; Whatever it was had left.&nbsp;
I never felt threatened by</b>
<br><b>any of this until after I moved out.&nbsp; I was visiting one weekend
and my</b>
<br><b>brother and I were hanging out in the living room.&nbsp; I started
to drift off to</b>
<br><b>sleep ( to the point that I couldn't open my eyes but was still
aware of</b>
<br><b>everything around me) when I felt like something was standing over
the sofa</b>
<br><b>watching me.&nbsp; Whatever it was it was mean, angry and dangerous.&nbsp;
I felt</b>
<br><b>terribly wrong and very frightened!!!&nbsp; Too scared to open my
eyes ( but now</b>
<br><b>very much awake) I asked my brother if someone was standing by the
sofa.</b>
<br><b>Thinking I was completly nuts he said no.&nbsp; I didn't believe
him!!!&nbsp; Asking</b>
<br><b>again, and looking even more stupid, I got the same response.&nbsp;
What now?!!!</b>
<br><b>I was so scared.&nbsp; I thought, ok, I'll just open my eyes and
if something</b>
<br><b>happens I can always scream and my dad will rescue me (my brother
was a lost</b>
<br><b>cause).&nbsp; When I did open my eyes everything stopped.&nbsp;
It was gone.&nbsp; My father</b>
<br><b>on the other hand has seen a ghost face to face in the house.&nbsp;
He said that</b>
<br><b>it was a "Green Lady," very ugly staring at him as he slept.&nbsp;
Like any other</b>
<br><b>person he closed his eyes and prayed for it to go away.&nbsp; There
are SO many</b>
<br><b>more things to share but this should be enough for now.&nbsp; Enjoy!</b>
<br><b>For all of you out there who have experienced these things, don't

<p><b>New Mexico Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lilithfairian@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;In October of '77, my grandparents decided to move from Cincinnati,
OH to</b>
<br><b>Deming, NM. They were going to buy a house once they got there.
They chose a</b>
<br><b>very nice-looking white adobe two story home with a balcony running
along the</b>
<br><b>front of the home. Not long after they moved in, they noticed some
unusual</b>
<br><b>occurrences. Doors opening and closing by themselves. Things missing,
then</b>
<br><b>reappearing in some strange location later. The house had somewhat
of an</b>
<br><b>unusual design in that there was a fake fireplace in the living
room and a</b>
<br><b>large bedroom sized area upstairs that served as a hallway between
the two</b>
<br><b>bedrooms. It also contained the door that led to the balcony with
stairs that</b>
<br><b>led down to the backyard.. Frequently, a cheap, metal dining room
chair left</b>
<br><b>in the guest bedroom would be relocated into the large "hallway."
It hadn't</b>
<br><b>been moved by either of my grandparents. Strange noises could be
heard in the</b>
<br><b>home when the person was alone. When my Grandfather decided to give
the fake</b>
<br><b>fireplace a new surface, he discovered an old black and white photo
of</b>
<br><b>himself and my Grandmother in front of the home. The year looked
to be about</b>
<br><b>1950. They didn't see this home prior to the year they moved to
New Mexico,</b>
<br><b>1977. They had never posed for it. After living in the home for
about a year,</b>
<br><b>they decided to move to Arizona. When they announced this at the
dinner table</b>
<br><b>to my Mom, sister and myself, the kitchen door slammed shut SO hard,
the</b>
<br><b>glass window shattered. A short time later, I was left alone in
the house to</b>
<br><b>do some cleaning and packing in preparation for the move. I could
hear noises</b>
<br><b>upstairs and they had a definite "person/people" caused sound to
them,</b>
<br><b>something solid. Knowing the balcony had stairs that led down to
the yard, I</b>
<br><b>was afraid someone had snuck into the home. Being only 9 yrs. old,
I was</b>
<br><b>getting frightened. I went upstairs and found nothing amiss. I returned
to my</b>
<br><b>chores downstairs but the noises continued. Knowing for certain
I was Not</b>
<br><b>alone, I told whatever "it" was that I would leave it alone if it
would leave</b>
<br><b>me alone. Nothing more happened, but I didn't want to stay there
alone</b>
<br><b>anymore so I called my Mom to come get me. When the neighbors found
out my</b>
<br><b>grandparents were moving, they said that they weren't surprised.
"No one ever</b>
<br><b>stays too long because of the ghost." This was 1977-78. Since then,
I have</b>
<br><b>talked to two other people, one in 1984, the other in 1988, that
know of this</b>
<br><b>home. My husband has also come across one man, in 1991, that had
spent a week</b>
<br><b>in the home around 1985 and could describe it's unusual layout,
complete with</b>
<br><b>faux fireplace. These other people brought up the house first as
it was</b>
<br><b>around Halloween and we were telling each other ghost stories.</b>

<p><b>I Hear Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JuneBabe0601@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 3 years old I had one of those matel play phones, and
I would play</b>
<br><b>with it a lot. Well for a couple nights, my mom said I would be
having a</b>
<br><b>conversation with someone. And everytime I would get off the phone
I would</b>
<br><b>say I love you to that person. My parents started to get worried.
On the last</b>
<br><b>night I talked to that person, the last thing I said was I will,
and I love</b>
<br><b>you. I got off the phone, and I told my mother that Grandpa says
hi and that</b>
<br><b>he loves us all and he's watching over all of us. Everytime I think
of that</b>
<br><b>day, I cry my eyes out, cause all I want to do is actually talk
to him again,</b>
<br><b>cause I never met him and I love him so much.</b>
<br><b>Okay...it all started when I was about 10 or 11. We had just moved
to</b>
<br><b>Evansville Indiana when I was 7. Well, one day my dad was home alone
and was</b>
<br><b>watching t.v. on the couch when he felt a cold hand touch his shoulder.
The</b>
<br><b>next thing that hapened was when all of our cats and dogs just stared
down</b>
<br><b>the hallway. When we would put our hands in front of their faces,
they would</b>
<br><b>just move their heads so they could see whatever they were seeing.
One day I</b>
<br><b>was sitting in my room watching t.v. I used to have this tall cabinet
in my</b>
<br><b>room. It was wide open, cause I was listening to the radio earlier
in the</b>
<br><b>day. Well, as I was watching t.v. I turned to look at the doorway
cause I</b>
<br><b>suddenly felt cold. I looked around and didn't see anything that
would make</b>
<br><b>the room suddenly cold.</b>
<br><b>As I was coming around to put my attention back to the t.v., that
cabinet</b>
<br><b>door slammed shut. Now no windows were open so there was no way
it could have</b>
<br><b>been blown shut. Something or someone had shut it. When I was 12,
more things</b>
<br><b>started to happen. My mom was alone one night, and she was in the
kitchen I</b>
<br><b>guess working on the bills, when she heard old time music coming
from the</b>
<br><b>fireplace. No one else was home, so it didn't come from either me
or my dad.</b>
<br><b>Things really only happen when someone is alone in the house.</b>
<br><b>Not long after, my father and I were in the living room, watching
t.v. when</b>
<br><b>the channels just started changing. Well, at first me and my dad
thought the</b>
<br><b>t.v. was just screwing up. So we turned it off for a little bit,
and we</b>
<br><b>turned it back on. It started again. We just ignored it and it finally</b>
<br><b>stopped. When I turned 14, which was last year (99), when either
my dad was</b>
<br><b>home alone, or when I was home alone, the front door, would just
burst open.</b>
<br><b>Now we know we shut and locked the door, it just bursts open, and
it still</b>
<br><b>does it. Nothing really hasn't happened since then, but when I'm
alone at</b>
<br><b>home I still feel like I'm being watched. I'm 15 now almost 16,
and I still</b>
<br><b>have no clue who is haunting this house. But I do have an idea of
who it</b>
<br><b>could be. Back in February of '78, my grandfather died of lung cancer.</b>
<br><b>Whenever I stay at my grandmothers house I hear things in the middle
of the</b>
<br><b>night.</b>
<br><b>In the t.v. room in the very back of the house, there is a fireplace
in</b>
<br><b>there. Well, my grandma will have it on during the night cause me
and my</b>
<br><b>cousins Nathan (18) and Zach (14), sleep back there. Well during
the middle</b>
<br><b>of the night it will get really cold back there. Before my parents
and I</b>
<br><b>moved into the house we're currently living in now, we moved in
with my</b>
<br><b>grandma and my step grandpa.</b>
<br><b>Late at night I would wake up and see someone walking down the hallway.
I</b>
<br><b>would get really scared so I had my dad go check it out. He never
did find</b>
<br><b>anything. When we finally moved into our house we found out from
our</b>
<br><b>neighbors, that the family that lived here before us, moved out
because the</b>
<br><b>husband had died. Now I don't know if it's him or my grandfather.</b>

<p><b>Mama's Haunted house?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: blue_chick24@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story begins with my grandparents house.You see,i</b>
<br><b>believe their house was haunted.They lived there for</b>
<br><b>about 20 years,and it was 35 years old.</b>
<br><b>Now,whenever i went over to spend the night,i heared</b>
<br><b>things at night.I honestly heared someone walking</b>
<br><b>around upstairs.Their house was a twostory house,and</b>
<br><b>my</b>
<br><b>bedroom was located near the entry beside to slideing</b>
<br><b>doors which lead to the front door and the stairs were</b>
<br><b>directly in front of the door when you walked in.</b>
<br><b>One night,i had watched a movie,and was ready for bed,</b>
<br><b>and had headed to my room.Now,i'm used to sleeping in</b>
<br><b>the dark,so i turned the light off.But soon,i heared</b>
<br><b>something walking.Then i heared creaking of a door and</b>
<br><b>it scared me,so i jumped up and fliped the light</b>
<br><b>on.Nothing.</b>
<br><b>Later on,the next morning,while my grandpa was</b>
<br><b>there,my grandma told me i was hulusinating.But after</b>
<br><b>he left,later in the afternoon,i pressed my grandma</b>
<br><b>on,and she told me two amazing stories.</b>
<br><b>The first was that she and my mother,had been home</b>
<br><b>alone once,and no pets,and they had heared a spoon</b>
<br><b>clank into the sink.But,when they went and</b>
<br><b>looked,there was no spoon to be found.</b>
<br><b>The second story was about my grandma.When one of my</b>
<br><b>grandma's rellatives passed away,they werent able to</b>
<br><b>tell the person good bye.And so that night,my grandma</b>
<br><b>woke up,and saw a dark figure standing beside her</b>
<br><b>bed.She said she wasnt able to see it clearly but was</b>
<br><b>sure it was him,the relative.Now i said why didnt you</b>
<br><b>tell grandpa,and she said she did,she screamed,because</b>
<br><b>well,when you wake up from dead asleep(dead like</b>
<br><b>deeply) then you can be surprised easly,and he woke up</b>
<br><b>fast,but it had already gone.She thought it could have</b>
<br><b>been a burglar untill he turned the light and she said</b>
<br><b>thats when she figured it was him.Now,i want to know,</b>
<br><b>when they bought that house,it wasnt very old.They</b>
<br><b>bought in in 1979.It was about 35 years old,and they</b>
<br><b>had it for 20years.</b><b></b>

<br><b>I Grew Up In A Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: janice.d.lewis@gte.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I am a 30 year old mother of three. And I probably wouldn't believe
in ghosts if I hadn't lived in a house with at least two ghosts or spirits
for 16 years. We moved in the house when I was 4, and right away things
began to happen. Nothing really major at first. Things would be moved or
just disappear completely. I could say out loud "OK put it back I need
it " leave the room then come back and it would be on the corner of my
dresser or on my pillow. I didn't say anything to my parents about this
until I heard my mom doing the same thing one day. I guess I was about
7 when I started to feel like I was being watched, almost all the time.
When I was in my teen years , 14 or 15, I was afraid to take a shower because
I never felt like I was alone. I could never see anything but I would get
glimpse in my peripheral vision. The room my brother and I shared when
we were children used to be the dining room and the wall to the back of
the house ,after the add on, was always cold and I was always afraid something
was in the wall like another dimension or something. Then when I was in
my teens my grandmother told me she had been to a funeral in that house
when she was younger and the body was on a "death table" at the same wall.
I know it must seem like I am just rambling on and on , but so many things
happened in that house its hard to tell everything. I would hear voices
when I was the only one in the house. And when I would come home from middle
school ,I was the first one home everyday, I would feel like I was interrupting
something. and the doors would be wide open. At the end of our stay there
things began to change from bad to worst. We turned the back porch into
a bed room for me ,the other side of the before mentioned wall, my&nbsp;
door would close on its on and at times I couldn't open it. The feeling
of being watched intensified. and I grew afraid to be in the house. Almost
every night I would hear someone talking and saying my name . I could make
out my name and sounded like the voice would say "Tammy, wake up you have
to leave" I kept hearing it until the day my Dad said we were moving that
night I didn't hear the voice but all of the electrical things in my room
kept going on and off and my clock/radio couldn't keep time. It would jump
back and forth between 12:15 am&nbsp; and 2:30 am and every where in between.
When we moved out I worried that I would follow me. There has been one
time when I was scared in this house we live in now . I pass our old house
everyday going to town and coming home. This one day I had to come home
from work on my lunch break And when I passed the old house I got a terrible
head ache, I got home done what I came home for and went back out to my
car. I noticed the second I got back in the car my head started to hurt
again. As I got close to the driveway of the old house, I slowed down and
started praying the Lords prayer out loud right in front of the house .I
mean in front of the front door my head stopped hurting and I was no longer
afraid. We move from the house when I was 20. And there isn't enough money
in the world to get me to go back in that house.</b>

<br><b>Sisters Story</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is something that happend to my sister a few years
back, she told me</b>
<br><b>that one night at around 3am she woke up to go get a glass of water,
our</b>
<br><b>hallway is very narrow and long, so anyways she opens the door of
her</b>
<br><b>bedroom and starts walking towards the stairs, she said her eyes
where shut</b>
<br><b>because she was half asleep, so about half way through the hallway
she</b>
<br><b>opened her eyes and saw a figure that looked like a little boy,
she closed</b>
<br><b>her eyes and froze, she thought it was my younger brother and called
out</b>
<br><b>"Peter" but when she opened her eyes noone was there, she went to
look into</b>
<br><b>my brothers room and he was sleeping. Ever since that incident happend,

<p><b>Haunted Baseball Field</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: PDL147852@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was in my early teens back in the eighties my friends and
I would</b>
<br><b>frequent this oasis of ours. Our small town is on the outskirts
of a large</b>
<br><b>city but we had this spot which was a thick woods with an open field
and</b>
<br><b>several baseball fields on the other side. These fields could be
accessed</b>
<br><b>from a long thin road coming in from the highway but it was easier,
and</b>
<br><b>cooler, to come in out of the woods. This area had a reputation
a mile long</b>
<br><b>things like people would disappear in the woods at night, rituals
would take</b>
<br><b>place here or that gangsters from the city would bury there murder
victims</b>
<br><b>back there in the 20s when this whole areas was nothing but woods.
I don't</b>
<br><b>know if any of that happened but finding several arrowheads back
there the</b>
<br><b>rumor that it was Indian land was prabrably true. The cops used
to patrol the</b>
<br><b>field on horseback during the day and sit back in a squad car in
the dirt</b>
<br><b>parking lot at night. I heard they don't do that anymore, wonder
why?Maybe</b>
<br><b>they saw what i saw, here's the tale. It was late summer early fall
and Iand</b>
<br><b>my usual friends were back there just doing what we normally do,
playing</b>
<br><b>catch with the football, throwing rocks etc. The sky was starting
to redden</b>
<br><b>it would be dark soon and if the cops caught you there after dark
it wouldn't</b>
<br><b>be pleasant. We started to head for the woods. I was at the back
of the pack</b>
<br><b>with the sun being behind us. All of a sudden the sky seemed to
darken by</b>
<br><b>several shades all at once. The boys turned in unison to look at
me then they</b>
<br><b>all together ran into the woods. I thought they were being funny
until I</b>
<br><b>turned around. About 40 ft. behind me and 10ft. off the ground back
in the</b>
<br><b>fields was this motionless siloutte of a black figure. I could distinguish
no</b>
<br><b>features but it looked like a mummy with a blowing cape and outlined
by the</b>
<br><b>setting sun. I opted to run to the left following the long road
to the</b>
<br><b>highway. I hadn't run that far that fast before or since, even when
I was</b>

<br><b>Grandma's Visit?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: msmith@in.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was about ten past three, and I had to pee. So, I fumbled in the
dark, pulling on my bathrobe to make the trek. Our downstairs bedroom&nbsp;
was located at the opposite end of the"L" of the house, and the bathroom
nearly at the other end. Pretty much bedroom, living area, make the bend
into the kitchen, hall to utility room at far end with bathroom off of
hallway.&nbsp; My cat, Max usually hangs out in or near the kitchen.&nbsp;
Nothing unusual up to that point.&nbsp; I was finishing up washing my hands
at the basin, when I just happened to glance up into the mirror. I should
tell you that the mirror is situated such that you can see around the corner
into the utility room, and "no," I didn't "close" the door-it's the middle
of the night!&nbsp; When I looked up, I saw a white, misty figure in the
utility room. "No way!" I thought, so I looked away, into the sink...I
stood there for a minute or two, confused, drying my hands, before I looked
back up. Well, I realized I wasn't "dreaming," when I saw it was still
there. I heard myself say "Wayyy..."&nbsp; This brought Max running in
to see what I was doing. I will never know if his "grouchy" meowing was
because of the image, or not, because he is naturally a growly kind of
cat.&nbsp; So, at this point, I can't very well spend the rest of the night
in the bathroom. I figured Max is a twenty pound Main Coon, and that should
count as some form of protection?&nbsp; I picked him up, and stepped into
the hall. So, I stood there for just a couple of seconds before I turned
to look into the utility room. Enough time for Max to growl, bury his head
into the crook of my elbow, and proceed to thrash me with his tail.&nbsp;
Well, it was STILL there!&nbsp; About eight feet away, in front of the
fuse box--I could just make out that it was a figure, around five feet
tall, seemed to have a suggestion of glasses, or else really big eyes...either
billowy due to a dress, or just because the body was so indistinct. No
reason, but impression that it was somehow feminine. Detected no "malice,"
but needless to say, I was still freaked out. I don't know how I had the
wits about me to say out loud, " Please go away, you're scaring me. I don't
want to see you."&nbsp; The figure, which had been vascillating between
transparent, and somewhat opaque, then slowly seemed to dissolve--the eye
glasses/eyes remained the longest. The whole episode couldn't have been
more than a couple of minutes, at most.&nbsp; Anyway, "Max-the-protector"
and I BACKED away through the house to the bedroom, where I didn't get
much sleep the rest of the night! For a couple of weeks afterwards, out
of the corner of my eye I would catch the eyelasses/eyes only moving around
in the utility room at the end of the hall at night. It seemed as soon
as it noticed me looking, it would quickly vanish.&nbsp; Of course my husband
was on utility room laundry duty for a few months afterwards...he thinks
I was "dreaming" anyway.&nbsp; After I got over the initial "freak out,"&nbsp;
I realized that all of this occurred within&nbsp; the month after my Grandmother
passed away (she wore glasses, too.)&nbsp; I have also come to believe
that the utility room, especially with the fuse box, would be the ideal
electrical environment for that sort of activity.&nbsp; All of this happened
over fifteen years ago, and since we've had no further "incidents," I prefer
to think of it as a visitation, not a true haunting.&nbsp; Maybe Grandma's
"goodbye"?&nbsp;&nbsp; P.S.-- Max is still my" kitchen vigil cat."&nbsp;
He is seventeen now, and I like to think he'll stick around after he's
passed on...</b><b></b>

My best friend andmy two brothers all said they seen someone too.&nbsp;
At night it was hard to get to sleep because every time I tryed to sleep
I would hera banging on my closet.&nbsp; Once a doll hand moved and pointed
to the closet and once when I was little I&nbsp; heard someone say don't
look toward the closet when I was sleeping.&nbsp; Every time I slept toward

<br><b>Childs Birthday Party</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: trishwhelan@roadrunner.nf.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had an experience at a childs birthday party with on ghost caught
on</b>
<br><b>video.&nbsp; I was fooling around with the camera and scanned past
a window and</b>
<br><b>kept taping, I later viewed the video and there appeared to be a
man looking</b>
<br><b>in through the window. He appeared to be wearing the clothes of
a fisherman</b>
<br><b>or someone who might have been at sea.&nbsp; He had a big coat on
with buttons</b>
<br><b>down the front and a sowwester (fishermans hat) on.&nbsp; It was
more like an</b>
<br><b>apparition than an actual person.&nbsp; I was not sure what I was
seeing so I had</b>
<br><b>three other people looking at it as well and they did see a heavy
set man</b>
<br><b>staring back at us. He was only there for a few seconds then he
appeared to</b>
<br><b>step out of the window. After that the tape somehow snapped the
next time we</b>
<br><b>tried to show someone. We thought it was my grandfather and my cousins</b>
<br><b>greatgrandfather because he died before he got to see them.&nbsp;
We said he came</b>
<br><b>back to visit them on their birthday.&nbsp; He was a fisherman and
he died at see</b>
<br><b>while fishing.&nbsp; So there you go, that's my story and I will
say it happened</b>
<br><b>until the day I die. I do believe there are other things out there
other</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I have had several experiences over the last 27 years.&nbsp; I believe
I submitted once to your ghost page.&nbsp; But you didnt put mine up.&nbsp;
So I thought I would give it another shot.</b>
<br><b>I will start way back to when I was 4yrs old.&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember
that I was sleeping pretty heavy and I was woken up as if my body was sliding
up inside of me.&nbsp; I dont know what to make of that.&nbsp; I guess
I always chaulked it up to an out of body experience.</b>
<br><b>On early NewYears Day morning in 84 I was sleeping over my brothers
gfriend and families home.&nbsp; My mother was sleeping.&nbsp; But she
had a few it being NewYears and was out like a light.&nbsp; I was laying
there in the dark awake still from all the excitement and I heard a man
say my name.&nbsp; I can tell you I never expected and that scared me quite
badly.&nbsp; I hardly dared to go turn the light on cause it was in the
general direction of the voice.&nbsp; Chills for an 11 yr old.</b>
<br><b>Only 3 yrs later we were living in a very old neighborhood in a
house some cabdriver called the haunted house.&nbsp; Everyone always thought
she was mentally ill.&nbsp; But she seemed quite scared.</b>
<br><b>Well one night around midnight I was sleeping and my grandmother
was sleeping in the next bed.&nbsp; I woke up and looked over the bed and
there was what looked to me a sheet so I reached to touch it.&nbsp; I dont
know why.&nbsp; So the minute I did it snapped back really quick.&nbsp;
When I looked back over the bed it was back.&nbsp; It took me some courage
to turn the lights on.&nbsp; A few hours later my grandmother woke up cause
the light was on and wanted to know why.&nbsp; She knew something happaned
she looked at me really wideeyed.&nbsp; And understood when I said I was
sleeping in the living room with the light on til my mother came home and
I crawled in with her.&nbsp; I searched the next morning for the cause
of it but to no avail it was no sheet that I could find.&nbsp; We have
our sheets tucked in hospital corners.&nbsp; So there was no way that was
it</b>
<br><b>I have so much more I probably should wait on them though and maybe
send them in later.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Freaky Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gorakja@meritorauto.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was in the early 1900's, so my mother
tells me, and her mothers</b>
<br><b>uncle or great uncle died, he was a small child and he tripped and
hit his</b>
<br><b>head on a iron stove.&nbsp; They thought he was dead, so they went
on with the</b>
<br><b>funeral arrangements.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All we know is that he was
a small child and back then they use to</b>
<br><b>have the coffin in the home to bee seen, also there was a small
glass</b>
<br><b>window in the front to see the persons face.&nbsp; She told me that
after</b>
<br><b>everyone left the house, a man would come and tidy up, make sure
is it</b>
<br><b>presentable for the next day, and this went on for four days before
he was</b>
<br><b>buried&nbsp; Anyway, the man who cleaned him up had to change his
diaper because</b>
<br><b>it was went and he would also have to clean the glass because it
had fog on</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; They buried him anyway, and now we think he was buried
alive.&nbsp; We</b>

<br><b>Creepy Feelings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My experiences range in intensity.&nbsp; I suppose I should start
by saying</b>
<br><b>that my Grandmother (so I've been told) used to hear and speak with</b>
<br><b>spirits all of the time.&nbsp; My sister claims to be able to do
this also.</b>
<br><b>I know that on occasion, my mother and brother have seen ghosts
in</b>
<br><b>places that we have lived at.&nbsp; I don't see them like they do,
but man do</b>
<br><b>I feel their energy! This could be long, so please bear with me.</b>
<br><b>My mom, brother and I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment.&nbsp; I hated
to be</b>
<br><b>alone in that apartment, because it just felt creepy.&nbsp; But
being a latch</b>
<br><b>key kid most of my life, I was forced to be there alone quite often.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>didn't understand it, but it felt like I was always being watched.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>didn't feel like I was in danger, but I didn't like that feeling
of</b>
<br><b>being stared at constantly either.</b>
<br><b>My mother and I had to share a room because my brother got the other</b>
<br><b>room to himself.&nbsp; One morning about 1:00 or 2:00 am, my mother
woke me</b>
<br><b>up with a scared tone in her voice.&nbsp; She said "who are you
and what do</b>
<br><b>you want" and then she let out this blood curdling scream that I'm
sure</b>
<br><b>scared the hell out of our surrounding neighbors in the apartments
next</b>
<br><b>door.&nbsp; I know that I was awake and staring at her while she
was talking,</b>
<br><b>but the minute she screamed, I threw the covers over my head (like
that</b>
<br><b>was going to save me) and laid there all freaked out, with my heart</b>
<br><b>pounding out of my chest. The next morning she told me that she
saw a</b>
<br><b>transparent lady standing in our doorway staring at her.</b>
<br><b>The next night my brother said that he was laying in bed when he</b>
<br><b>suddenly woke up to see a lady walk into his room (which was across
the</b>
<br><b>hall from our room) and then disappeared behind his door.&nbsp;
He told me</b>
<br><b>that he had seen her a few more times after that.&nbsp; We didn't
stay there</b>
<br><b>very long after that.</b>
<br><b>After we moved, I was one of those know it all (stupid) teenagers
that</b>
<br><b>no one could tell anything to.&nbsp; I had all of the answers.&nbsp;
I managed to</b>
<br><b>marry at 17 years old to an abusive man (22 years old).&nbsp; We
moved in</b>
<br><b>with his mother (that sucked) who was very religious.&nbsp; The
house was</b>
<br><b>owned by his brother who resided elsewhere.</b>
<br><b>This house was so creepy.&nbsp; You could open every window in that
house and</b>
<br><b>it was still dark and creepy.&nbsp; I hated going down the back
hall, past</b>
<br><b>the stairs to the basement and to the back wash room.&nbsp; The
hairs on the</b>
<br><b>back of my neck would stand up and I would be covered with goose
bumps.</b>
<br><b>I chalked it up to an overactive imagination until one night.</b>
<br><b>I was pregnant with my first child.&nbsp; My then husband and I
were asleep</b>
<br><b>in bed.&nbsp; I got that creepy feeling again of being watched as
I slept and</b>
<br><b>then I was sent into total consciousness by the feeling of someone</b>
<br><b>shaking me.&nbsp; I squinted my eyes really tight because I knew
it wasn't my</b>
<br><b>husband, because I moved my hand to feel if he was still next to
me (he</b>
<br><b>was).&nbsp; I felt like whatever was shaking me was also trying
to get my</b>
<br><b>eyes open and I kept resisting. There was no way I wanted to see</b>
<br><b>whatever it was. I was soon bouncing off of the bed from the shaking.
I</b>
<br><b>started praying and after a couple of seconds, it stopped shaking
me and</b>
<br><b>I grabbed my ex-husband's hand and I could feel him going through
what I</b>
<br><b>had.</b>
<br><b>He finally stopped the shaking and never once did he wake up.&nbsp;
I finally</b>
<br><b>managed to go back to sleep, terrified the whole time.&nbsp; The
next morning</b>
<br><b>I jumped out of bed and flew out of that room.&nbsp; When my ex
came in he</b>
<br><b>told me what had happened to him and told me that when he started
to</b>
<br><b>pray, it all had stopped.&nbsp; I asked didn't you feel it happening
to me</b>
<br><b>first?&nbsp; He told me that he was in a coma like sleep that he
couldn't</b>
<br><b>wake up from it.&nbsp; He had no idea.&nbsp; About that time, we
got a phone call</b>
<br><b>that his cousin was murdered in the early hours of that morning.</b>
<br><b>My ex-mother-in-law said that maybe it was the cousin trying to
make</b>
<br><b>contact with the brother that didn't live there anymore.&nbsp; The
cousins</b>
<br><b>were close and that used to be his room.</b>
<br><b>Weird stuff used to happen in that house all of the time.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>ex-mom-in-law was laying on the sofa watching t.v. one night after
we</b>
<br><b>had moved out.&nbsp; She wasn't asleep, so it wasn't a nightmare.&nbsp;
While</b>
<br><b>laying there, she described a dark shadowy thing that resembled
a pig</b>
<br><b>went up the wall, walked across the ceiling, stopped directly over
her</b>
<br><b>and then dropped between her and the back of the sofa, almost trying
to</b>
<br><b>push her off of it.&nbsp; She started praying and holding on for
dear life</b>
<br><b>and it went away.</b>
<br><b>I used to hate to go there for the family functions.&nbsp; There
were always</b>
<br><b>uncomfortable areas in that house.&nbsp; Things would always disappear
and</b>
<br><b>there was a lot of negative energy (for a lack of better words)
in that</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; I would walk over the threshold and it would hit me
like a ton</b>
<br><b>of bricks.</b>
<br><b>I would come to make a realization that the negative energy might
have</b>
<br><b>been comfortable with my ex.&nbsp; When we would take Polaroid pictures
in</b>
<br><b>that house, he would always have a red, wavy thing over him that
seemed</b>
<br><b>to come out of the top of his head, almost like flames, but not
really.</b>
<br><b>Mind you this didn't happen in all of the pictures, but any one
that it</b>
<br><b>did happen in, no one else was affected, just him.</b>
<br><b>Later on in my life, after the divorce and a lot of turmoil from
my ex,</b>
<br><b>I met and married a wonderful man.&nbsp; A couple of months after
we met, he</b>
<br><b>took me and my children to meet his family at their ranch on Christmas.</b>
<br><b>I was pretty nervous, but the family was so nice and his grandmother
was</b>
<br><b>a real kick in the pants.&nbsp; I could listen to her for hours.&nbsp;
She had so</b>
<br><b>many stories and she was just so full of life.&nbsp; It was a real
pleasure</b>
<br><b>just hanging out with her and playing scrabble.</b>
<br><b>When I first got there, I noticed a weird feeling down by the lower</b>
<br><b>cabin and I didn't know why.&nbsp; I sloughed it off as no big deal.&nbsp;
Then I</b>
<br><b>experienced the wash house.&nbsp; I knew that I didn't like that
place, and</b>
<br><b>didn't want to go in there for anything, but again I sloughed it
off.</b>
<br><b>Well, as it turns out there is a grave with a headstone out in back
of</b>
<br><b>the lower cabin of a man named "Howard" and someone died in the
wash</b>
<br><b>house.</b>
<br><b>Grandma has since passed on and the last few times that we have
been up</b>
<br><b>there, the energy has been incredible in certain areas.&nbsp; The
Grandpa,</b>
<br><b>Grandma, Howard and a baby of one of his cousin's is buried on this</b>
<br><b>property.&nbsp; I believe there is quite a bit of activity (feeling
wise)</b>
<br><b>there. Mind you, it's not negative, but it is really strong, almost</b>
<br><b>suffocating.</b>
<br><b>This place is in the middle of no where.&nbsp; It is surrounded
by 3 streams</b>
<br><b>that come together on the property and millions of trees.&nbsp;
We had to</b>
<br><b>stay in the bunk house over Thanksgiving.&nbsp; (I didn't find out
that</b>
<br><b>someone died in the wash house until Thanksgiving of this year).&nbsp;
It is</b>
<br><b>very dark in that area and I had to walk through the area that I
feel</b>
<br><b>the most energy from, to get to it.&nbsp; I was walking through
the trees</b>
<br><b>with the flash light with my son and daughter close behind (they
get</b>
<br><b>creeped out too).</b>
<br><b>As we walked past a tree, I caught what looked like a black cat
out of</b>
<br><b>the corner of my eye, which ran past me on the right and I jumped
back</b>
<br><b>and yelled to the kids who were on my heels "Watch out for that
cat" and</b>
<br><b>the kids say "What cat?"&nbsp; there was nothing there!&nbsp; I
freaked out and</b>
<br><b>ran to the bunkhouse!&nbsp; The whole time feeling eyes staring
at me from</b>
<br><b>the darkness.&nbsp; The kids felt it too and let me know it.&nbsp;
"Can we go</b>
<br><b>now?" is all I heard.&nbsp; They were intrigued, and yet scared
at the same</b>
<br><b>time. They don't like to be in the main house alone and at night
I have</b>
<br><b>to walk them up there and wait for them to go to bed. It's like
the big</b>
<br><b>chicken taking the little chickens to someplace scary and then counting</b>
<br><b>the seconds until I can leave.</b>
<br><b>At that point, I decided that I was going into town the next morning
to</b>
<br><b>buy a disposable camera with flash to see if taking pictures of
the</b>
<br><b>areas I felt uncomfortable in, might yield something.&nbsp; That
night my new</b>
<br><b>husband and I took the camera around to those areas and I took a
few</b>
<br><b>pictures of each spot.&nbsp; It was only an experiment, and I wasn't
prepared</b>
<br><b>to do a real study with more film. (I will be more prepared on</b>
<br><b>Christmas).&nbsp; When I finally develop the film this week, I will
see if</b>
<br><b>there is anything on there.&nbsp; If so, I will send you a copy.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, that night, after we took the pictures and stayed up playing</b>
<br><b>cribbage with my father-in-law, we headed back to the bunk house.&nbsp;
Again</b>
<br><b>around the same area, the black thing ran by me again and I again</b>
<br><b>jumped.&nbsp; my husband was in front of me with the flash light
and I caught</b>
<br><b>that thing again out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; While we were
laying in</b>
<br><b>bed, we heard heavy footstep around the bunk house, and it sounded
like</b>
<br><b>someone was scratching down the sides of the cabin with a tree branch.</b>
<br><b>We laid there motionless at first, my husband saying "Are you awake,
did</b>
<br><b>you hear that" at which point my eyes were open so big, I couldn't
have</b>
<br><b>closed them if I had tried.&nbsp; I of course said "yes" and he
hopped up and</b>
<br><b>grabbed his gun (he's in law enforcement).</b>
<br><b>We didn't know if it was his dad playing a trick on us or it was
a wild</b>
<br><b>animal.&nbsp; He placed the gun by the door and slowly opened the
door to</b>
<br><b>look.&nbsp; There was no one or nothing out there and no trees were
touching</b>
<br><b>the bunk house, nothing!&nbsp; He came back in and laid down and
said "that</b>
<br><b>was weird".&nbsp; He told me that I had started to get him freaked
out now.</b>
<br><b>One last thing before I end my long story.&nbsp; On our wedding
day, my new</b>
<br><b>mother-in-law took a picture of us after we were pronounced man
and</b>
<br><b>wife. There in the picture is a white mist (no one was smoking during</b>
<br><b>the wedding) that looks similar to the ones on your web site.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>location is supposed to be haunted by a murder victim.&nbsp; I'll
send a copy</b>
<br><b>of the picture to you if you're interested.</b>
<br><b>Well, that's it.&nbsp; I will keep you posted if anything develops
(no pun</b>
<br><b>intended) from the film of the ranch.&nbsp; I will also be taking
pictures of</b>
<br><b>Manzanar's cemetery at night.&nbsp; We have visited there at night
a few</b>
<br><b>times and it is supposedly haunted too.</b>
<br><b>I never ask anything of the spirits, I don't acknowledge them as
to ask</b>
<br><b>questions or make statements.&nbsp; But once in a while, I will
get that</b>
<br><b>staring at the back of my head feeling and I will say "Stop it!"
and I</b>
<br><b>feel the distance increase, once in a while, it goes away completely.</b>
<br><b>By the way, great web site! I feel better knowing that I can tell
you</b>
<br><b>what I have experienced without being thought of as a psycho.</b>
