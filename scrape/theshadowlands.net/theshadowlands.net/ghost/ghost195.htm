<p><b>After dropping off my kids at their high school early one dark morning,</b>
<br><b>I was just about to turn onto the highway near us and suddenly saw
a</b>
<br><b>white haze.&nbsp; I hit the breaks, wondering what it was.&nbsp;
Just as I stepped</b>
<br><b>on the breaks, a car on the highway ran the red light. The car would</b>
<br><b>have hit the side of my van, had I not paused for this apparition,
thus</b>
<br><b>injuring a small child seated on that side of the van!</b>

<br><b>Trinity Episcopal church haunting in San Francisco</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Paulroger2@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Trinity Episcopal Church was built in 1892 and sits on the corner
of Bush and</b>
<br><b>Gough Streets. In San Francisco.&nbsp; It is a large stone gothic
church that was</b>
<br><b>designed after the Durham castle in England.</b>
<br><b>I have been a sexton (caretaker) for the church for about the last
10 years.</b>
<br><b>Meals on wheels have started their program of feeding approximately
160</b>
<br><b>elderly folks around the neighborhood at our church.&nbsp; Monday
through Friday</b>
<br><b>between 11:30am and 1:30pm the dining room is full of elderly people
and it</b>
<br><b>is a good way to utilize the space.</b>
<br><b>However, two of the kitchen workers have quit shortly after starting.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>only lasted a few days when on two separate occasions they became
frightened.</b>
<br><b>One worker was going up the steps to the hallway when he suddenly
saw a</b>
<br><b>ghost, sort of like a grey entity or shadow of a figure coming out
of the</b>
<br><b>men's bathroom. and disappear through the wall on the other side
of the hall.</b>
<br><b>The other worker saw it again on another occasion near the entrance
to the</b>
<br><b>kitchen from the hallway.</b>
<br><b>We used to have a 7-day candle on the healing alter that burned
24 hours a</b>
<br><b>day.</b>
<br><b>When Paul, who is the other sexton, and I would come in to clean
on Monday</b>
<br><b>morning, the candle would always be out and I or Paul would always
have to</b>
<br><b>relight it.&nbsp; It never went out on any other day and their are
two other 7 day</b>
<br><b>candles in the church that burn 24 hours a day, but they never went
out like</b>
<br><b>this one did. every Monday it would be out.&nbsp; We thought it
must be a draft</b>
<br><b>somewhere,&nbsp; funny though the draft always happened between
Sunday afternoon</b>
<br><b>and Monday morning.</b>
<br><b>I saw it one evening in the church when I was vacuuming near the
chapel</b>
<br><b>alter. It looked like a 3 dimensional shadow of a human figure and
it came</b>
<br><b>down the steps and went right passed me.&nbsp; Startled by it, I
turned off the</b>
<br><b>vacuum and swiftly made my way down stairs calling out for Paul.&nbsp;
I made him</b>
<br><b>come back up with me to investigate my experience with the ghost.&nbsp;
We sat in</b>
<br><b>one of the front pews and waited silently for a while but nothing
else</b>
<br><b>happened that evening.</b>
<br><b>One time, it was late afternoon,&nbsp; I was straightening all of
the kneelers</b>
<br><b>pushing them all underneath the pews.&nbsp; When I walked down the
middle aisle I</b>
<br><b>was checking that all the kneelers were in straight rows.&nbsp;
About halfway down</b>
<br><b>the church in one of the rows, one of the kneelers was pushed out&nbsp;
from the</b>
<br><b>rest of the kneelers. This kneeler looks different from all the
rest and is</b>
<br><b>sort of an oddball kneeler and I distinctly remember pushing that
kneeler</b>
<br><b>under the pew.&nbsp; I was startled by what I saw, but I went over
and pushed it</b>
<br><b>back underneath the pew. no one else was in the Sanctuary with me
and Paul</b>
<br><b>was cleaning the rooms downstairs at the time.</b>
<br><b>On still another occasion It was a Sunday Morning, people from the
8:00am</b>
<br><b>service had left and the Father Michael had gone into the Rector's
office to</b>
<br><b>chat with Father Cromey.&nbsp; I&nbsp; was again vacuuming the carpet
in the Sanctuary</b>
<br><b>of the Church when the hair on the back of my neck stood up and
I turned</b>
<br><b>around and saw a tall slender figure wearing an off-white linen
suit and he</b>
<br><b>was across the aisle in the other section of pews but he was standing
their</b>
<br><b>facing me, and as I started to focus on his face he vanished right
before my</b>
<br><b>eyes.&nbsp; I was not startled this time because I sensed the figure
was not</b>
<br><b>trying to frightened me. I turned off the vacuum and paused for
a few minutes</b>
<br><b>and looked all around the church, hoping to get a glimpse of the
ghost again,</b>
<br><b>but I didn't and I continued with my vacuuming.</b>
<br><b>One time, it was about 10 in the evening and I was mopping the bathrooms
in</b>
<br><b>the ambulatory, (a curved half-circle hallway where the church offices
are</b>
<br><b>located), and minutes before, I had come out of the room where the
cleaning</b>
<br><b>supplies are kept.&nbsp; As I began mopping one of the bathrooms
I heard like a</b>
<br><b>man's footsteps coming from that room.&nbsp; I stopped mopping and
the footsteps</b>
<br><b>went down the hallway passed the bathroom doorway and&nbsp; I could
see out into</b>
<br><b>the hallway and I saw nothing as the sounds of the footsteps walked
passed</b>
<br><b>and continued to the other end of the hall. I was frozen stiff and
couldn't</b>
<br><b>move.&nbsp; Again, the hair on my neck stood up and I flung the
mop aside and ran</b>
<br><b>downstairs yelling for Paul.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes when I am in the men's bathroom downstairs all alone.&nbsp;
I often feel</b>
<br><b>like someone is watching me.</b>
<br><b>This is where other people have observed a grey shadowed figure
standing in</b>
<br><b>the hall just outside of the men's restroom.</b>
<br><b>Other people have had similar experiences too within the walls of
this old</b>
<br><b>church built in 1892.</b>
<br><b>There is a crypt under the church where the founder, Rev. Flavel
Mines is</b>
<br><b>buried. and we also have the columbarium in the Sanctuary of the
church that</b>
<br><b>holds the remains of about twenty people.</b>
<br><b>Another time, about eight in the evening, our neighbor Andy went
out to</b>
<br><b>dinner with us, we took him to a little cafe located near the church.&nbsp;
So we</b>
<br><b>parked in the church parking lot.&nbsp; When we came back from the
cafe, I took</b>
<br><b>Andy into the church to show him around.&nbsp; We came down the
backstairs and</b>
<br><b>into the hall, when Andy suddenly said frantically, "what is that!"&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>looked down the hall I didn't see anything, but Andy described a
grey shadowy</b>
<br><b>looking figure near the Men's restoom door in the hall, it had vanished
by</b>
<br><b>the time I looked.&nbsp; I never told him about the ghost until
he saw it himself,</b>
<br><b>because lately, I have sort of forgotten about it.</b>
<br><b>But with this recent occurrence with the two kitchen workers,&nbsp;
it's reminded</b>
<br><b>me about my ghostly experiences here and I know that it is continuing.</b>
<br><b>I said out loud one time to the ghost, that I didn't want to be
startled by</b>
<br><b>it or to hear it anymore and for me it seemed to stop.&nbsp; but
who knows, one of</b>
<br><b>these days or nights, it's going to give me another startle when
I least</b>
<br><b>expect it.</b>
<br><b>I think it's fun because I know that the ghost is not mischievious
and is</b>
<br><b>just trying to get to another part of the church when people come
around.&nbsp; So</b>
<br><b>I guess it's a lonely ghost. probably a church member from long
ago. or</b>
<br><b>someone that used to attend one of the support groups that go on
every</b>
<br><b>evening in the dining room.&nbsp; I don't know.</b>
<br><b>But when I have had my experiences with the ghost or ghosts, at
the time, I</b>
<br><b>wasn't thinking about anything spooky&nbsp; when it happened.&nbsp;
so I know I didn''t</b>
<br><b>imagine it.&nbsp; I'm usually thinking about other things and not
anything to make</b>
<br><b>myself get spooked.</b>
<br><b>And the kichen workers didn't know anything about the ghost prior
to their</b>
<br><b>ghostly experiences there.</b>
<br><b>Anybody near by that would like to come out and shed any light on
who or what</b>
<br><b>it wants.</b>

<br><b>Fearful Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nugget207@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I want to start off by saying that this is a great site and I love
reading</b>
<br><b>about everyone’s ghostly experiences, even though I must admit I
have a hard</b>
<br><b>time believing them all.&nbsp; There’s some stories that you can
just tell that</b>
<br><b>that the person writing it is a kid with an overactive imagination.&nbsp;
I only</b>
<br><b>say this because even though I am a ‘believer’, I am a college educated</b>
<br><b>rational individual and I can also be the biggest skeptic you’ve
ever met,</b>
<br><b>which brings me to this incident that occurred while I was still
in college.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I just want to stress to everyone that’s as skeptic as I
am, that even</b>
<br><b>though this experience sounds extremely unbelievable, that this
is true and</b>
<br><b>really did happen.&nbsp; I know that this is long, but bear with
me, I want to</b>
<br><b>make sure I don’t leave anything out.</b>
<br><b>This incident happened one night in late October in 1994.&nbsp;
I was a junior in</b>
<br><b>college at the time, and had very little free time to do anything
because</b>
<br><b>besides class, I also worked part time and was very active in my
fraternity.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Every year we would have a big Halloween party at one of
our fraternity</b>
<br><b>brothers houses and just have a completely wild, chaotic night,
but nothing</b>
<br><b>can compare to what we all experienced that night.&nbsp; I got to
the party</b>
<br><b>shortly after it started, got a beer, and noticed people coming
out of the</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; I asked one of the people what was going on down
there and they</b>
<br><b>told me that my friend Jeff had brought his ouija board to the party
and was</b>
<br><b>down there ‘acting stupid’.&nbsp; Apparently these people didn’t
know Jeff very</b>
<br><b>well.&nbsp; He took the ouija very seriously, if anything he was
addicted to it,</b>
<br><b>he constantly used it and kept in close contact with a spirit named
Jack</b>
<br><b>that he’d contacted through the board.&nbsp; I’d come to learn that
Jack wasn’t</b>
<br><b>the most pleasant spirit and was a pretty mean individual who had
died in</b>
<br><b>prison, but for some reason, Jeff liked conversing with him.&nbsp;
I then</b>
<br><b>proceeded down the stairs to see what was going on.&nbsp; There
were about 10</b>
<br><b>people down in the basement (by the way, this was NOT a finished
basement,</b>
<br><b>this was the spooky concrete-floors-and-dust-everywhere basement).&nbsp;
Jeff and</b>
<br><b>a girl I knew named Lynn where using the board and talking to “Jack”.&nbsp;
Lynn</b>
<br><b>began to get tired of it, she was just trying to have a good time
and she</b>
<br><b>thought that Jeff was just taking the whole thing way too seriously.&nbsp;
Before</b>
<br><b>she could get up to go back upstairs, a girl we knew named Dana
came down</b>
<br><b>the stairs.&nbsp; As soon as Dana came down into the basement, the
board went</b>
<br><b>absolutely nuts, moving around at a frenzied pace.&nbsp; Jeff said
that this</b>
<br><b>wasn’t like Jack and asked the board what was wrong.&nbsp; The board
spelled out</b>
<br><b>that it wasn’t Jack, and it just kept spelling Dana’s name over
and over.</b>
<br><b>Jeff asked the board if the spirit knew Dana and it said YES.&nbsp;
At this</b>
<br><b>point, everyone’s kind of looking around confused and everything,
and Dana</b>
<br><b>was just looking at the board all weird.&nbsp; Jeff then asked the
board what</b>
<br><b>it’s name was at it spelled the name MICHAEL and that he was six
years old</b>
<br><b>when he died…..this is when Dana went ballistic, she just started
crying</b>
<br><b>uncontrollably and shouting, but we couldn’t understand her because
she was</b>
<br><b>crying so much.&nbsp; She then ran upstairs and out the backdoor.&nbsp;
A couple of us</b>
<br><b>followed her to try and find out what was going on and to try and
calm her</b>
<br><b>down.&nbsp; We went outside and saw Dana crying on another girls
shoulder, this</b>
<br><b>other girl looked both pissed off and scared to death at the same
time.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>asked her what was wrong and started yelling at us “How could you
pull such</b>
<br><b>a mean trick like that, you should feel awful for doing this to
her!!”&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>were clueless, we asked her what she was talking about and she then
told us</b>
<br><b>that Dana had a younger brother named Michael…that drowned when
he was six</b>
<br><b>years old.&nbsp; A chill immediately when down my spine.&nbsp; Once
Dana calmed down a</b>
<br><b>little bit, she told us that she’d been trying to contact Michael
over the</b>
<br><b>years, but was never able to.&nbsp; She then offered to buy Jeff’s
ouija board</b>
<br><b>from him so she could keep in touch with her brother.&nbsp; At this
time, “Jack”</b>
<br><b>came back and it was like he and Michael were “fighting” over control
of the</b>
<br><b>board.&nbsp; Jack then told Jeff that if he burned the board that
night before</b>
<br><b>midnight, that he soul would be set free and he would be at peace.&nbsp;
Jeff</b>
<br><b>immediately wanted to set the board on fire because he said he’d
developed</b>
<br><b>some sort of relationship with Jack and wanted his soul to be at
peace.</b>
<br><b>Let’s just say Dana didn’t like that idea a bit, so they both got
in a huge</b>
<br><b>argument and the party became totally chaotic.&nbsp; By this time,
everyone at</b>
<br><b>the party (only about 50 people) knew what was going on and everyone
started</b>
<br><b>fighting and yelling, split down the middle either on Jeff’s side
or Dana’s.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Eventually, Jeff snuck outside with a can of lighter fluid
and set the</b>
<br><b>board on fire with Dana standing over it crying her eyes out.&nbsp;
As you can</b>
<br><b>guess, no one was really in the mood to party after that and everyone
ended</b>
<br><b>up either staying at the house the party was at or left for home
to get</b>
<br><b>their head back together.&nbsp; After that night, not one person
I know that was</b>
<br><b>at this party ever talked about that night again, not even once!&nbsp;
I don’t</b>
<br><b>know how to explain what happened, but all I know is that there’s
no way</b>
<br><b>that this was some sort of ‘trick’ or joke that Jeff and Dana could
have</b>
<br><b>played on us.&nbsp; Being the skeptic that I am, to this day I’ve
tried to find</b>
<br><b>out how they could have pulled this over on us.&nbsp; Dana was just
a</b>
<br><b>friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend that not very many of us knew that
well, and</b>
<br><b>that night at the party, none of us knew that she had a brother.&nbsp;
Just that</b>
<br><b>one friend of hers at the party that yelled at us knew anything
about it.</b>
<br><b>And then there’s Jeff, he just takes the occult way to seriously
and would</b>
<br><b>never use it as a basis for a joke, and if it was a trick, he’s
not the type</b>
<br><b>to let it go, he’d make sure he threw it in our face about how much
he</b>
<br><b>scared us and what a great joke it was every chance he got, that’s
just how</b>
<br><b>he is.&nbsp;&nbsp; To this day, anytime I tell anyone about this,
when I get to the</b>
<br><b>part that the spirit was her brother, I get a chill all over my
body.&nbsp; Words</b>
<br><b>simply cannot describe what it was like being there that night and
what</b>
<br><b>happened, but I’ll never forget about it, I can remember it just
like I was</b>
<br><b>there yesterday.&nbsp; If anyone wants to write me about this or
anything, feel</b>

<br><b>Apartment Presence</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LTB2@go.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Tracey.&nbsp; I'd like to share my story with you and
the others.</b>
<br><b>When I was 18 years old, my best friend and I decided to rent an
apartment together.&nbsp; We found a tiny little house built over a garage
on an old estate.&nbsp; The estate included this little abode (which was
called the gardener's shack), the caretaker's cottage and the main house.
My friend and I chose to rent the gardener's shack.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after moving in, we would occasionally hear scratching noises
(at all hours of the day and night) which seemed to be coming from the
one closet which was located in the bathroom.&nbsp; Thinking it might be
mice or rats, we laid down some traps and rat poison.&nbsp; We never found
any dead rodents, nor did we ever find any droppings, but still the scratching
sounds continued.&nbsp; My friend was spooked by these noises, and hung
a crucifix above her bed to no avail.&nbsp; The sounds continued.</b>
<br><b>About a month later I was alone one afternoon and decided to vacuum.&nbsp;
I had the doors and windows open, as well as the stereo turned on loudly.&nbsp;
While I was busily vacuuming, I suddenly felt the hair on my arms and neck
stand up.&nbsp; I was also immediately filled with a sense of incredible
dread and great fear - and I sensed, rather than heard a voice saying "get
out, get out of the house right now".&nbsp; I hesitated for only a few
seconds, thinking "this is crazy", but the overwhelming feeling that I
had to get out that very second made me shut off the vacuum, grab my keys
and run out of the house, slamming the door behind me.</b>
<br><b>I drove over to my mom's house, shaking like a leaf, and told her
what happened.&nbsp; About five minutes later the phone rang.&nbsp; It
was my grandmother, and she asked to speak to me.&nbsp; After I said hello,
she relayed to me that everything was going to be fine, that I was no longer
in danger and that "it's gone now, and it won't come back."&nbsp; I asked
her how she knew to call me.&nbsp; She stated that she had been contacted
by a spiritual guide via automatic writing, who said he was my protector
and would guard over me.&nbsp; He (this spiritual guide) stated that his
name was Daniel and that it was imperative that my grandmother reassure
me that I had nothing to fear anymore.</b>
<br><b>I went home shortly thereafter and immediately felt a different
'sense' in the house.&nbsp; I felt safe and knew that 'it', whatever it
was, had been banished.&nbsp; Neither my friend nor myself ever heard any
noises again.</b>
<br><b>About a year later I was speaking to a man who was familiar with
my neighborhood and asked me where exactly I lived.&nbsp; I told him the
location and he asked if I lived in the gardener's shack.&nbsp; When I
replied that I did he said, "I used to live in that house also.&nbsp; Have
you heard the story about it?"&nbsp; I stated that I hadn't, and he went
on to tell me that in the early 1930's, the gardener living in that house
had murdered his wife there.</b>
<br><b>Was that what I sensed - her fear and the urge to run away as fast
as possible?&nbsp; Perhaps - but I am grateful that my spiritual guide
stepped in to protect me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Lonely Farm House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SBCY1979@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When it comes to the paranormal, I think what we don't see is much
more</b>
<br><b>chilling than that which visually presents itself to us. This was
definately</b>
<br><b>the case when my parents visited an old, run down farmhouse in Bedford,</b>
<br><b>Michigan, sometime around 1974 or 75. Here is the story I've been
told</b>
<br><b>numerous times.</b>
<br><b>My parents had just returned to Michigan from living in Iowa for
the past</b>
<br><b>couple of years. They enjoyed taking country drives on weekends
and were</b>
<br><b>currently looking for a "fixer-upper" house to buy, hopefully in
the country.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;On this particular occasion, they were driving along 2 Mile
Rd., just 1 or 2</b>
<br><b>miles to the west of the villiage of Bedford.&nbsp; When they passed
a house with</b>
<br><b>an old For Sale sign nailed to a tree in the front yard, my dad
stopped the</b>
<br><b>car and backed it up so they could view the house. Naturally it
didn't look</b>
<br><b>like much from the outside. A neglected farm house, probably 2 or
3 bedrooms,</b>
<br><b>some of the windows missing or broken, paint peeling off... other
than that,</b>
<br><b>perfectly livable with a little repair.</b>
<br><b>My mom took the phone number on the sign, and they drove into town
to their</b>
<br><b>apartment to call the owner.</b>
<br><b>They got her on the phone, and found her to be a very nice lady.
She invited</b>
<br><b>them to go back out to the house to look around by themselves and
she said</b>
<br><b>that the door was always left unlocked.&nbsp; (This was back when
people could be</b>
<br><b>trusted.)</b>
<br><b>They got back in their car and made the 15 minute drive back to
the house. It</b>
<br><b>was a bright sunny day (I have pics they took of the house) and
after they</b>
<br><b>finished exploring the overgrown yard and outside of the house,
they tried to</b>
<br><b>get in...&nbsp; but couldn't...&nbsp; the door was locked.&nbsp;
This irratated them a</b>
<br><b>little since they had made the drive out there for nothing. So they
got back</b>
<br><b>in their car and drove home to call the owner again. She apologized</b>
<br><b>repeatedly, but seemed completely baffled, as the lock on the front
door,</b>
<br><b>(the door which they used) could not be locked without the key,
and she had</b>
<br><b>the only one. She invited them to come to her office and get the
key if they</b>
<br><b>were still interested in the house. They did, and made a third trip
to the</b>
<br><b>house. This time they went straight to the door. Before trying the
key, my</b>
<br><b>dad tried opening the door again. The knob turned with ease, and
the door</b>
<br><b>swung open. Somehow, it had been unlocked in the past hour.</b>
<br><b>That alone was enough to make them weary of purchasing the house,
but they</b>
<br><b>proceeded to look around, taking pictures here and there. The first
room they</b>
<br><b>entered was the kitchen. A large kitchen. It appealed to my mom
as she loves</b>
<br><b>to cook and there were rows of cupboards lined up along the kitchen
wall. My</b>
<br><b>dad says there must have been 40 or more cupboards. Ample space
to store</b>
<br><b>cookware. They moved on to living room and then upstairs to the
bedrooms.</b>
<br><b>They spent about 20 minutes in the rest of the house poking around
and</b>
<br><b>imagining where furniture could go. Infact they nearly forgot about
the</b>
<br><b>incident with the door. And as they walked down stairs and into
the</b>
<br><b>livingroom were quite convinced this may be the house for them.
The middle of</b>
<br><b>the country, no people around, plenty of privacy, the quiet of the
woods all</b>
<br><b>around...</b>
<br><b>They passed through the living room and into the kitchen. When they
did, they</b>
<br><b>stopped dead in their tracks. To this day, my dad says both their
jaws nearly</b>
<br><b>hit the ground when they saw what had been done.&nbsp; No blood
on the floor, no</b>
<br><b>dead body, etc. That would have been more believable than what they
saw. Each</b>
<br><b>one of the cupboard doors had been opened to an exact 90 degree
angle, after</b>
<br><b>having all been closed 20 minutes earlier. In the time they had
been in the</b>
<br><b>house, they had not heard so much as a footstep come from the kitchen,
let</b>
<br><b>alone any type of noise indicating the movement of wooden cupboard
doors. In</b>
<br><b>a city, it would be a little more understandable. But out here,
they could</b>
<br><b>hear a bird singing a half a mile away. If anybody had had time
to open all</b>
<br><b>40 or 50 of them without making a sound, they would definately not
have been</b>
<br><b>able to do so in such a precise manner as this. After standing there
in awe</b>
<br><b>for a brief minute, they hurried through the kitchen and out the
door and to</b>
<br><b>the car. My dad started the car up, and they drove back to the owner
to give</b>
<br><b>her the key. They gave her their story, and declined from looking
any further</b>
<br><b>into purchasing the house.&nbsp; I don't recall being told how she
reacted but if</b>
<br><b>she had given them any history on the house that might have attributed
to it</b>
<br><b>being haunted, I'm sure I would know about it.</b>
<br><b>The house is no longer there. It collapsed a few years later. But

<br><b>by the foundation and seen the remains many times. I have never

<br><b>the rubble, since there is probably nothing there, and there are

<br><b>What happened in that house that day? Was this an unusual joke by
an</b>

<br><b>What a Doll</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: joet@delmarfair.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I moved to Sacramento, CA in the fall of 1980.&nbsp; I just turned
17 years old</b>
<br><b>and was in my senior year in high school.&nbsp; I shared a room
with my younger</b>
<br><b>brother.&nbsp; My sister had just moved in with us and she had her
own room.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>parents had their room and all the bedrooms were off one hallway.&nbsp;
About one</b>
<br><b>month after moving in, I started to differentiate the sounds I heard
at</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; It was cold, so we ran the heat during the night, but
I noticed</b>
<br><b>sporatic cracking and banging sounds throughout the house.&nbsp;
All the bedrooms</b>
<br><b>were at the north end of the house and there was a family room attached
to</b>
<br><b>the kitchen on the other side (south side).&nbsp; This is where
I would hear</b>
<br><b>distant bangs on the walls at night.&nbsp; Three months later my
older sister</b>
<br><b>moved in with us, so I moved into a room with my younger brother
who was 15</b>
<br><b>at the time.&nbsp; This bedroom was the first bedroom or the front
bedroom.</b>
<br><b>Immediately I started hearing footsteps coming from the family room.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>would wake up around 2 or 3 a.m. and hear someone walking around.&nbsp;
I kept</b>
<br><b>forgetting to tell my siblings as I had a busy schedule in school
and we</b>
<br><b>didn't hang out much together socially.&nbsp; Time went on, and
I eventually</b>
<br><b>mentioned the footsteps to my brother who said he heard them sometimes,
too.</b>
<br><b>The next time I woke up hearing them, I woke him up.&nbsp; They
always walked</b>
<br><b>around in a circle in the family room, but this time they started
walking</b>
<br><b>down the hallway where the bedrooms were.&nbsp; We heard the footsteps
stop at</b>
<br><b>our door, like someone was standing outside in the hallway.&nbsp;
We opened the</b>
<br><b>door and no one was there.&nbsp; I didn't notice any cold chills,
at all.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>didn't know about the coldness back then, but I don't remember a
temperature</b>
<br><b>change.&nbsp; This was winter time anyway, I would have thought
it was a draft if</b>
<br><b>there was a cold spot.&nbsp; Any hoo, this became a regular thing,
for months.</b>
<br><b>My brother would wake me up if he heard it, and vice versa.&nbsp;
Summer came and</b>
<br><b>I graduated from high school.&nbsp; A friend of mine had a pool
and my siblings</b>
<br><b>and I were hanging out there one day during the week.&nbsp; That
summer we had 40</b>
<br><b>days in row where it was 100 degrees or hotter.&nbsp; I remember
quite a few 110</b>
<br><b>degree days that summer of 1981.&nbsp; This particular day, I decided
to drive</b>
<br><b>back to the house to get some cassettes I had in my room.&nbsp;
(Devo, Pat</b>
<br><b>Benatar, Queen, Supertramp.&nbsp; You know the decade.)&nbsp; The
house was closed up</b>
<br><b>with the air conditioner on.&nbsp; All the blinds were closed to
keep the sun</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; I walked into the house, not thinking anything except
"get the music</b>
<br><b>and get back to the party."&nbsp; I went into my bedroom, found
the cassettes and</b>
<br><b>started for the door.&nbsp; As soon as I got into the door jam,
I heard a sound</b>
<br><b>behind me.&nbsp; It sounded like a doll.&nbsp; The kind of baby
doll that when you</b>
<br><b>pick it up, it makes this "mama" sound.&nbsp; I turned around thinking
"what the</b>
<br><b>heck was that."&nbsp; I looked and there was nothing there.&nbsp;
So, I turned towards</b>
<br><b>the door again and it did it again.&nbsp; "Mama".&nbsp; I turned
around and I knew I</b>
<br><b>heard something this time.&nbsp; I went to the window and lifted
the shade to see</b>
<br><b>if someone was outside.&nbsp; There was no one around.&nbsp; When
I put the shade</b>
<br><b>down, it did it again.&nbsp; "Mama."&nbsp; Real clear and it was
coming from the</b>
<br><b>direction of my closet, which was open.&nbsp; I could see everything
in there and</b>
<br><b>there was no doll.&nbsp; As I was staring at the closet, it did
it again.</b>
<br><b>"Mama".&nbsp; It was coming from behind a shelf, next to my closet.&nbsp;
I moved all</b>
<br><b>the stuff off and looked behind it.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; As my head
came out from</b>
<br><b>behind the shelf, it did it again.&nbsp; I was looking at the spot
where a doll</b>
<br><b>should have been, but nothing was there.&nbsp; I couldn't figure
it out.&nbsp; Then</b>
<br><b>the phone rang, and I about jumped through the ceiling.&nbsp; I
was suddenly</b>
<br><b>aware that I was there by myself.&nbsp; My mom was on the phone
and I told her</b>
<br><b>what just happened.&nbsp; She told me to leave and come back when
someone was</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; I drove back to the pool party and told my siblings
and friend what</b>
<br><b>just happened.&nbsp; My sister said she had been hearing footsteps
at night that</b>
<br><b>stop in the hallway, which she never mentioned before.&nbsp; My
brother and I</b>
<br><b>told her we had been hearing the footsteps too.&nbsp; We drove back
to the house.</b>
<br><b>I showed them where it was coming from, but nothing happened at
that time.</b>
<br><b>That particular sound never came around again.&nbsp; I lived there
for 4 more</b>
<br><b>years and had other things happen sporadically, but that was the
most</b>
<br><b>definite event that happened to me.&nbsp; I was visiting there last
October 2000</b>
<br><b>and I brought my dog with me.&nbsp; I sleep in that room when I
visit my parents.</b>
<br><b>I have no qualms about staying in there, but apparently my dog had
issues.</b>
<br><b>She sleeps through the night, normally, and when I would wake up
at night,</b>
<br><b>she would be sitting up in her dog bed looking around, wide awake.&nbsp;
Poor</b>
<br><b>thing, I thought.&nbsp; She's probably protecting me from something
(she thinks)</b>
<br><b>and can't go to sleep.&nbsp; Thanks for your time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Scariest Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JROBILLARD@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My entire life I have been intrigued by the paranormal. Psychics,
Ouija boards, Hauntings , ghosts everything. Drawn to it.&nbsp; In my early
teens I used the Ouija board. Which I now believe to be very dangerous.
I believe I attracted many spirits, invited them into my life this way.
I could tell story after story of things that have happened to me . Things
that I relate directly to my use of the Ouija board.</b>
<br><b>I want to share with you my scariest experience though.</b>
<br><b>At this time in my life ( I was about 16- 17 years old) I had been
dabbling in witchcraft with a girlfriend of mine. Candlelight spells etc....We
were complete novices in it. We would go to second hand stores, book stores
wherever and look for books on spells etc... AT this point we had been
using the Ouija board all the time. We would bring it to school with us
, everywhere... A spirit named Devin would always "talk " to us on the
board. Sometimes our fingers did not even have to be touching the triangle
for it to move. We began to realize that this spirit was not as it first
presented itself to us. It would get angry if we told it we had to go.
The triangle would 'fly' to NO. It would swear sometimes. When we got really
scared we&nbsp; put a small statue of Mary on the board and the triangle
pushed it right off the board and it broke. This is around the time when
we stopped using the board. However I think we brought some spirits into
my mom's house then. I would hear rapping on my walls. My dog would stand
at my closet door with his hackles raised and bark like crazy... People
saw spirits in the house.. A young man in a leather coat. A young boy in
the basement with blue overalls and a baseball hat on. An old lady, cats..
You name it. I began saying the Rosary every night. I kept two sets of
them hanging on my walls in my room.</b>
<br><b>Well, one night I had my girlfriend sleep over (the one I used to
do candle spells with) My room was on the second floor. We were in bed
and my window was open (screen down)Almost asleep and I heard pebbles hit
my window and someone call my name in almost a whisper. I said "Jessica
did you hear that?" She said "NO"</b>
<br><b>I told her to listen and sure enough we heard pebbles hit the window
and someone say , "Julie"</b>
<br><b>I was nervous.. Having been a trouble maker in my youth I used to
sneak out of&nbsp; my house all of the time. People used to come to my
window throw pebbles and I would sneak out. At this point in my life I
was trying to get back on the right track had been sober for about 4-5
months and to be quite frank, I did not want to see whomever it was that
could be calling for me.</b>
<br><b>I said "Jessica, go see who it is.."</b>
<br><b>she said , "No f#$%ing way, you go."</b>
<br><b>We heard the pebbles and someone call my name again.</b>
<br><b>I got up and went to my window. I looked out and at first I did
not see anyone. Then I got that feeling. You know , my hair stood on end.
Then I looked down and there sitting on the brick walkway that goes behind
my house was a white dog. Staring right up at me. I could&nbsp; see its&nbsp;
face clearly. It's eyes, nose, mouth(which looked like it had a slight
grin on it's face) head ears..... but it's body was like a blur...You could
make out the shape if it's body but it was almost see through.</b>
<br><b>At first I said to myself "hmm a dog... " and I looked for a person.
That is when I really realized that the dog was sitting there looking right
at me and I got a horrible feeling. Like it was really evil or something.
Then I began to doubt what I was seeing. So I said to it " Don't leave
but don't come in" I felt like an idiot saying it.. But I did not know
what else to do. I did not want to tell Jessica what I was seeing because
I wanted to see if she saw what I saw. I am yelling to Jessica to get the
hell over here. She finally came over I said to her, "What the hell do
you see?"</b>
<br><b>She said , "I see a DOOOOG!!"</b>
<br><b>We slammed the window shut . Locked it , grabbed the Rosary beads
off of the wall, pulled the blankets over our heads and said the Our Father
and Hail Mary about 100 times . We were scared to death.</b>
<br><b>The next morning we got up and went outside to look below the window,
to see if there was anything there. Of course there was not. I will tell
you that it has been 12 years ( I am 28 now) and I have never looked out
any of my windows at night.</b>
<br><b>Please, If you post this do not put this next part in...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have always felt that I am a bit psychic. If you can call
it that. I have premonitions and pick up on things. I sometimes know things
before people tell me etc. I have to say that after that experience I pretty
much shut that part of myself off. I stopped using the Ouija board, practicing
magic (I was a novice with the magic anyways) I used to be much more perceptive
. Until lately.. I&nbsp; met a man at the restaurant that I manage who
is in no doubt in my mind 100 % psychic. It is like we were drawn to eachother.
Meant to meet.&nbsp; Not in the romantic sense at all. I find myself to
be more intune with myself these days and pick up on things with ease these
days. Not in the I see spirits sense or that&nbsp; I know what card you
are holding in your hand stuff. Just knowing stuff. I don't know how to
explain it. I attribute this to my new friendship that I have developed
with Rob. He has renewed my interest in that part of myself again.</b>
<br><b>Why I felt the need to put that down I don't know. But there must
be&nbsp; a reason.....</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghosts on the Roof?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ErinKOC@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Okay, I know this is going to sound very strange but it's very true.
When I</b>
<br><b>was fairly young I lived in a 160 year old house. On occasions I
used to hear</b>
<br><b>a gunshot and someone walking around on the roof. Then this person
would</b>
<br><b>groan and a flash always fell by my window. I didn't know what this
was but I</b>
<br><b>never mentioned it to my parents. When a creepy face appeared in
my window I</b>
<br><b>told my mom. She said that someone had been killed on our roof.
About 50</b>
<br><b>years ago a man was reshingling our roof and watching the fireworks
on July</b>
<br><b>4th. The fireworks were held in a park about 1/4 a mile away, so
we could see</b>
<br><b>them from our house. Some kids were fooling around by our neighborhood
lake</b>
<br><b>with a rifle. They shot it into the air and threw it in the lake.
The stray</b>
<br><b>bullet hit the man in the head and he fell about three stories down.
A few</b>
<br><b>years later one of my second grade teachers was talking about a
man snooping</b>
<br><b>around in her backyard. When she asked the man what he was doing,
he told her</b>
<br><b>that a man was killed on her roof. I told her that it was actually
at my</b>
<br><b>house since the houses were so old. We moved out of the house in
97 but I'll</b>
<br><b>never forget the guy on the roof.</b>

<br><b>Young Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hotandspicy@imagewireless.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>When my mother was pregnant with me, our family moved out to a small</b>
<br><b>town just outside of Regina, Saskatchewan.&nbsp; When I was five,
I had a</b>
<br><b>bedroom at the end the hallway, right across from my parents.&nbsp;
One night</b>
<br><b>at about midnight I woke up and saw a girl, about the same age as
me</b>
<br><b>standing in the doorway.&nbsp; She was transparent, and reached
her hand out</b>
<br><b>towards me and mouthed what looked like Help! then disappeared.&nbsp;
Years</b>
<br><b>later I was talking to my sister about weird stories and she described</b>
<br><b>the same story.&nbsp; She had that room when she was five also.&nbsp;
Later we</b>
<br><b>found out that the couple my parents had bought the house from had
a</b>
<br><b>daughter who had passed away at the age of five.&nbsp; There was
other things</b>
<br><b>happening in the house like the telephone cord swining around for
no</b>
<br><b>reason ( it was in a corner no where near a window or doorway.)&nbsp;
Often I</b>
<br><b>heard footsteps when I home alone, walk up right behind me, and
when I</b>
<br><b>turned around, of course, no one was there.&nbsp; And most nights
at around</b>
<br><b>midnight I would hear footsteps coming up the stairs, throught the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, down the hallway, turn around and loop through the living
room</b>
<br><b>and dining room and back down the stairs to the basement.&nbsp;
I never</b>
<br><b>really feared any of this, it always felt like was being protected.&nbsp;
And</b>
<br><b>to this day, when I walk into a house, if there is a presence of
any</b>
<br><b>type, I can feel it right away.&nbsp; I don't know how to decribe
it, but it</b>

reason.</b>

<br><b>U.S.S. Wasp Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hillwig5@alltel.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had "Psycic" experiences of my own so I am not a disbeliever.
This didn't happen to me but I believe it still. While my husband was stationed
in Bremerton,WA on the tugboats part of the duties was to take smallboats
out in the harbor to make sure that no one was trying to get aboard the
decommissioned ships anchored there. The Wasp was the ship used to transport
dead men home from Viet Nam. Shipyard workers were to go onboard to make
sure that everything was a sit should be but no one would do it. Various
men have seen floating lights on the deck. On another occassion Navy personnell
had to go on board to get the mattresses that had been stored on the ship.
There was no light on it so they had to use flashlights and a system of
marking each hatch with a chalked "X" to find thier way back out. The men
left the doors open under the "X"'s. After they retrieved the mattresses
they started back only to find that all of the hatches had been closed
and "dogged" down from the other side and all of the chalk marks had been
erased. After getting off of the ship they tried to find out who was pulling
the prank then found out that the rest of the men they worked with had
been in a meeting with the Captain of the base. No one else had access
to the ship except those men. It has benn said that if you put your ear
to the hull of the Wasp you can hear the voices of all the dead men that
was brought back from the war. Believe it or not, I believe it. My husband
is a big skeptic and even he wouldn't go near the U.S.S. Wasp.</b><b></b>

We have had such things happen as razors being given tome while I was in
the bath tub. I once heard some one coming runnign down the stairs it sounded
almost as if some one had fallen. Not five seconds later me dog and my
cat at the time where standing on end hissing and barking like someone
had broken in the house. Then for no apparent reason they stopped and no
one was there. This was in my bed room. Then two nights later while haveing
a sleep oer with my friends. They awoke me in the middle of the night to
shw me a black figure dancing along the walls. I got up to make sure there
wasn't a light leak or anything and told them to go back to sleep. Shut

<br><b>Spider Gates Cemetary</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:FOXFYRE86@AOL.COM</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read the description
for Spider Gates Cemetary and would like to add something...first of all,
to my knowlege the place is called Spider Gates not because of eight gates,
but because of the awesome ironwork on the main gate which, when the gate
was closed became a monster spider.&nbsp; The Cemetary is not in "Worchester"
(correct spelling if anyone is interested is Worcester) it is actually
in the town of Leicester, Massachusetts, just across the road from, I think,
the west end of the Worcester Airport runways, and down a dirt road a little
ways through some very empty and desolate wooded area.&nbsp; As far as
the place being haunted, there is no doubt in my mind of that. I lived
for over 30 years in that area and know many individuals who visited the
cemetary on a dare or date and had something extremely strange happen that
frankly about scared them out of their Keds. The majority of them declined
to make a repeat visit.&nbsp; There are a lot of very old cemetaries in
that general area, another of which we used to pass through walking to
the unofficial swimming beach at the water skiing end of Long Pond.&nbsp;
Those gravestones were about the oldest I have seen, dating to the 1600's.&nbsp;
We had to walk through quite a chunk of pine forest and out in the middle
of nowhere, all of a sudden you come to a little overgrown glade surrounded
by ancient fieldstone walls and the head- and foot-stones which were almost
totally obscured by plant grass, vines and plant growth, forgotten for
who knows how long and seen only by those locals who knew about the shortcut
to the little beach.&nbsp; Another point of interest and which must most
certainly have its share of spooks would be the Rutland State Park, what
we townies have always referred to as the "Prison Camps" which was what
the area served as during the Civil War.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this is helpful
or at least interesting.&nbsp; I find this sort of thing fascinating.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You see, I grew up about 3 miles from the Spider Gates Cemetary, in Paxton
and spent much of my summers exploring the wilderness areas all around
there with my Dad hunting for good fishing, blueberries, hickory nuts,
pheasant and deer in season and just general exploring.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
is beautiful country and painfully beautiful when the leaves change in
the fall.</b>

<br><b>Hauntings of Rural Hall</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: GLIDESLOPE@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Payne road has a history slightly deeper than one man with a death
obsession...</b>
<br><b>Payne road is now part of, what was, Payne Plantation. Payne plantation
was one of the largest in the area. Although its founder placed the plantation
on a very unusual plot of land. This land was, essentially, a valley with
steep hills on all sides. The mansion was placed on the northern most hill
over-looking the entire plantation which was located in the valley and
on the surrounding hills. Slave shacks scattered the hill sides. Some shacks
are no bigger than a 8 by 8' closet.&nbsp; A small river ran through the
center of the valley suppling water to the plantation, mansion, and the
slaves.&nbsp; A small chapel was located 250yards and 45degrees to the
right of the masion and the main field located 300yards directly infront
of the mansion. The slave shacks were located 90-110 degrees to the right
of the mansion. 200 yards infront of the masion lay a small bridge...just
large enough for 1 carriage.</b>
<br><b>Now that you have the basic lay out allow me to give you the story.</b>
<br><b>Payne was an extremely racist man, much like many of the plantation
owners of the day. He fathered a family, 4 girls. The girls grew up isolated
from the outside world due to Payne's Over-protectiveness. They grew to
despise him and despise his cruelty to the slaves. Payne soon learned that
his oldest daughter was inpregnated....but....by whom?&nbsp; Seven months
later Payne's daughter confessed that it was a slave that inpregnated her.
Payne lost his mind. He cursed the lord and turned to devil worship.......brutally
sacrificing the slave to the evilness he held close to his heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Within a matter of months he learned that his youngest daughter (only 15
years of age) was also inpregnated by a slave. Payne brutally sacrificed
that slave and began to murder hundreds of slaves with everything from
a stick to a musket. He maliciously murdered his family and the slave children
(unborn and born). Shortly there-after he burned the entire plantation,
killing at least 10-20 more.</b>
<br><b>This is why the trees on payne road are soo young and the grave
stones are charred.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Blue, after having lived in this house for a year and a half, this
all</b>
<br><b>changed during November, 2000.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My couch divides my living room so that I can
have an entry (behind it)</b>
<br><b>where the door to the hallway and bedrooms can be found.&nbsp; Each
night I played</b>
<br><b>the same game with my nine month old puppy.&nbsp; I would sit in
front of the fire</b>
<br><b>place and throw a toy into the dining room or behind the couch.&nbsp;
Often it</b>
<br><b>would land in the hallway or even further into the guest room.&nbsp;
Always, she</b>
<br><b>would run after it and bring it back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, I threw the toy and it landed just
behind the couch, possibly</b>
<br><b>six feet away from me.&nbsp; The couch sits high off of the floor
about ten</b>
<br><b>inches, so I could clearly see my dog's head as she would come up
and then</b>
<br><b>back away from the toy.&nbsp; She would get within inches, and then
put her ears</b>
<br><b>back and back away.&nbsp; She was clearly excited about the game
and wanted to get</b>
<br><b>the toy, but she just could not seem to push herself that last four
inches to</b>
<br><b>grab it.&nbsp; I could not figure this, so I went around and tried
to encourage</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; Once I was there, she simply gave up.&nbsp; I got the
toy and brought it</b>
<br><b>around.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I threw it back and again, she would come close
to picking it up, but</b>
<br><b>then back off.&nbsp; I went around and looked at her and she was
looking up and</b>
<br><b>making the same facial expressions she makes when I am talking to
her.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was as if she was looking at someone who was talking to her.&nbsp;
I saw and felt</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; So, again I picked up the toy.&nbsp; The game was
over; she simply would</b>
<br><b>not play if I threw it behind the couch.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second night we began playing again, and
it started out well.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>would go behind the couch for a while, and then all of the sudden,
she</b>
<br><b>cowered down and ran to me.&nbsp; I went around and tried to call
her over, but</b>
<br><b>she was obviously not pleased and would not come.&nbsp; She did
not seem</b>
<br><b>terrified; she did not want to go behind the couch, though.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third night, all was going well again, but
this time went very badly,</b>
<br><b>quickly.&nbsp; Once again, she started out by going around the couch,
but then</b>
<br><b>stopped in mid skid looking up about the tenth time around.&nbsp;
She began to</b>
<br><b>growl...a sound I had never heard her make before, and she was backing
up.</b>
<br><b>Her face was that of a very frightened dog as she was looking up
at something</b>
<br><b>that I could not see.&nbsp; She backed right up until her hind end
touched the</b>
<br><b>front door when she panicked and began to wet all over.&nbsp; She
was house broken</b>
<br><b>for about four months at this time.&nbsp; She ran through the house
to the back</b>
<br><b>door wetting all over and begging to get out.&nbsp; Something had
scared her very</b>
<br><b>badly.&nbsp; She was acting as if she were going to die if she did
not get out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was angry after letting her out and went back
in to the living room.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>don't know what made me consider this, but I went back in and started
telling</b>
<br><b>whatever it was that this was my place and my time now.&nbsp; It
had had their</b>
<br><b>chance and it was not to come into my house and scare my dog or
me.&nbsp; It was</b>
<br><b>not welcome.&nbsp; It had to go, and go now! I was emphatic.&nbsp;
I guess it left</b>
<br><b>because the dog came back in later and all was well for a few more
days.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several nights later, I was playing with her
again in my bedroom.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>hall is a square with a door on each side.&nbsp; My bedroom door
is beside the</b>
<br><b>door to the living room and only about four feet away from where
my dog was</b>
<br><b>having her problem before.&nbsp; I was on my hands and knees with
my back to the</b>
<br><b>door; my dog was facing me and the door while we were playing.&nbsp;
Once again,</b>
<br><b>she began to back up, growling, and wetting everywhere.&nbsp; She
began to run</b>
<br><b>around the bed to find a way out.&nbsp; I felt so sorry for her
and I was angry.</b>
<br><b>She did not deserve this.&nbsp; I spun around and saw and felt nothing.&nbsp;
I just</b>
<br><b>yelled, "Get out of my house now."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dog was so freaked out, that I had to carry
her to the back door and</b>
<br><b>she when into a complete panic in my arms as we went through the
hallway.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>could hardly hang on to her.&nbsp; Whatever she saw was right there.&nbsp;
Once through</b>
<br><b>the hall, she calmed down again.&nbsp; For the next few days, I
could not get her</b>
<br><b>back in the house.&nbsp; It was not gone, although I could not tell
this.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>spent all of her time in the very back of the yard wanting me to
come out and</b>
<br><b>be with her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later, I had a reason to go out into
a detached garage that</b>
<br><b>has been converted into a family room.&nbsp; The room is not original
to the house</b>
<br><b>and I have spent many comfortable hours there.&nbsp; It was late
morning with the</b>
<br><b>sun up.&nbsp; As soon as I opened the door, I felt the presence
for the first</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; It was unlike any other that I had felt before.&nbsp;
I would not call it</b>
<br><b>evil, but I would call it angry and mean.&nbsp; My skin wanted to
crawl off my</b>
<br><b>bones and run out the door.&nbsp; I just stood there thinking that
I was not going</b>
<br><b>to be chased from my home.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the family room was a cage with two finches
in it.&nbsp; I checked them for</b>
<br><b>food and water and they were fine.&nbsp; Before I left, I said one
more time, "Get</b>
<br><b>out of my house; off of my property; I don't even want you in the
street in</b>
<br><b>front of my house.&nbsp; Get out, Now!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was
still feeling pretty creepy about</b>
<br><b>it and just shut the door and left.&nbsp; About a half hour later,
I decided to go</b>
<br><b>back out.&nbsp; I did not want this thing to rule me with fear,
and I was getting</b>
<br><b>pretty edgy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went in and the feeling was gone.&nbsp; I was
so grateful.&nbsp; But as I turned,</b>
<br><b>I noticed that both birds were dead.&nbsp; I could not believe my
eyes.&nbsp; It just</b>
<br><b>did not make since that these two birds that I hatched from eggs
about six</b>
<br><b>months before would both die at the same moment for no apparent
reason.&nbsp; This</b>
<br><b>thing went after animals.&nbsp; This scared me because I had never
had any type of</b>
<br><b>manifestation like this and I took it as a direct threat.&nbsp;
I felt so sorry</b>
<br><b>for the birds.&nbsp; I kept kicking myself for not taking them out
of the room</b>
<br><b>when I left.&nbsp; The poor things did not deserve whatever it was
that happened</b>
<br><b>to them.&nbsp; The feeling was now gone in the room, but it was
as thought it</b>
<br><b>wanted to show me a thing or two before it left.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my computer was in this room, several days
later, I went out to work</b>
<br><b>when I got to feeling that I was not alone.&nbsp; It was not the
creepy feeling I</b>
<br><b>had before, but clearly the feeling of a presence was with me.&nbsp;
A battery</b>
<br><b>operated clock that I have began to tick very loudly for no apparent
reason.</b>
<br><b>I looked up at it and noticed that I had not reset it with daylight
savings</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; I even glanced back at my computer to verify that it
was exactly one</b>
<br><b>hour ahead.&nbsp; Then I noticed that the second hand was caught
between the seven</b>
<br><b>and eight and could not move forward.&nbsp; This was causing the
loud ticking.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>have had these battery operated clocks do this very thing before,
so I</b>
<br><b>decided not to be concerned over it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to communicate with the being and said,
"If you want to</b>
<br><b>communicate, let the clock start back up again."&nbsp; I waited
and the clock</b>
<br><b>continued to malfunction.&nbsp; So I turned back to my work wanting
very much to</b>
<br><b>get it done and out of there even though I thought the clock was
just acting</b>
<br><b>up on its own.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For no reason I can think of, a thought went
through my mind that is</b>
<br><b>simply not something that I would think.&nbsp; I thought, those
birds died because</b>
<br><b>I did not give them water.&nbsp; I killed those birds!&nbsp; Intellectually,
I knew</b>
<br><b>better, but I had to look to make sure.&nbsp; I would never mistreat
an animal.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>turned my head to look over and at that moment, all the water began
to run</b>
<br><b>quickly out of the water bottle onto the floor of the cage.&nbsp;
I could hear it</b>
<br><b>glugging and see it spilling.&nbsp; That was enough for me.&nbsp;
Why did I think that</b>
<br><b>and why after a week did the water decide to just pour out right
then when I</b>
<br><b>got the urge to look at it? I went back in the main house.&nbsp;
It was the middle</b>
<br><b>of the day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, I went back out to lock up, and noticed
that the clock was now</b>
<br><b>working again.&nbsp; In fact, it was only forty-eight minutes ahead
instead of one</b>
<br><b>hour.&nbsp; Those twelve minutes were about how much longer I had
been in the room</b>
<br><b>after it malfunctioned.&nbsp; As soon as I left, it had gone back
to working</b>
<br><b>correctly.&nbsp; Two months later, it is still forty-eight minutes
fast...no more</b>
<br><b>malfunctions.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following night, a friend called to catch
up.&nbsp; She is a longtime,</b>
<br><b>very close friend, so I decided to confide in her.&nbsp; We had
meet when I was</b>
<br><b>serving as a new minister of the church she had been a member of
for some</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; As soon as I told her, I felt that I had done the wrong
thing.&nbsp; I told</b>
<br><b>her I did not want to say any more while in the house.&nbsp; Too
late, the cornice</b>
<br><b>that was hooked to the wall and ceiling for a year and one half
came down at</b>
<br><b>such a strange angle as to hit me.&nbsp; Six big chunks were taken
out of the wall</b>
<br><b>and ceiling as the screws that I used to put them up were long and
still</b>
<br><b>unbroken.&nbsp; She said, "What was that?" and I told her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked her to pray and I would too.&nbsp; A
few minutes later, it was gone</b>
<br><b>and has not returned.&nbsp; It was too much for me and I do not
want to experience</b>
<br><b>any of it again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally got up the courage to tell my next-door
neighbors about the</b>
<br><b>incident the other night while at their house for dinner.&nbsp;
They were the</b>
<br><b>first house in the division in 1948 and have been the only occupants
of their</b>
<br><b>house since then.&nbsp; They have known everyone who has lived in
my house over</b>
<br><b>the years.&nbsp; No one has ever died in the house.&nbsp; However,
there was a</b>
<br><b>mild-mannered woman who was a lot of fun as a neighbor, but for
some reason</b>
<br><b>she would periodically grab a knife and go after her husband with
all intent</b>
<br><b>to kill him.&nbsp; He had spent many nights next door waiting for
his wife's rage</b>
<br><b>to subside.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard this, a final piece of the puzzle
came together for me.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>is something I am ashamed of, but I have to tell the whole story
for you to</b>
<br><b>see the whole picture.&nbsp; A week before this all began, my puppy
had made me</b>
<br><b>chase her all over the neighborhood.&nbsp; I got her and I was frustrated,
but not</b>
<br><b>really angry.&nbsp; She was a puppy after all and there was no harm
done.&nbsp; I kept</b>
<br><b>thinking how do I train her to come to me when I call? I brought
her in after</b>
<br><b>carrying her about a block.&nbsp; As soon as I entered the door,
an instant rage</b>
<br><b>came up in me.&nbsp; I wanted to punish that dog severely and teacher
her a</b>
<br><b>lesson! I let go of her and gave her a slap that felt great, then
another.</b>
<br><b>She had never been hit and these were strong blows.&nbsp; I will
never forget the</b>
<br><b>look in her eyes.&nbsp; At that moment, she gently grabbed my hand
as if to say,</b>
<br><b>"enough."&nbsp; It was like I came to my senses and I was horrified
at what I had</b>
<br><b>just done.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I do not know why the following occurred...sent
me your remarks if</b>
<br><b>you have insights.&nbsp; I just started throwing up.&nbsp; By the
time I got to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom I had diarrhea, was sweating profusely, and was hyperventilating.</b>
<br><b>Whatever it was, it had controlled me that night.&nbsp; But this
was before</b>
<br><b>anything else had begun so I had no clue that it was anything but
me acting</b>
<br><b>in a way I had never acted before in my life.&nbsp; It was my dogs
eyes looking at</b>
<br><b>me and the gentle way she tried to stop me that brought me back
and I felt</b>
<br><b>guilt like I had never had before.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had never hyperventilated before and let me
tell you, that is a trip.</b>
<br><b>I knew that I needed to hold my breath, slow it down, or get my
head in a</b>
<br><b>paper bag, but my body kept saying deeper and quicker breaths with
fix it.</b>
<br><b>(Now I have an idea of what it is like for the woman in labor when
the doctor</b>
<br><b>says, "Don't push!") The sweats did not stop for almost an hour.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had my previous neighbor been controlled, too?</b>

<br><b>This House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: charlene.klaus.l434@statefarm.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I will start out with my experience.&nbsp; When my family and I first
moved into this house (I was about 3 at the time) our neighbors told my
parents a story about a man who lived there many years before that went
crazy and killed his family and buried them in the basement.&nbsp; Don't
know if it's true or not but it would explain alot.&nbsp; Anyway we had
alot of strange things happen there.&nbsp; My sister (who is two years
older) and I had a playroom that was a partially finnished attic.&nbsp;
The playroom had a small door which led to an unfinnished part of the attic.&nbsp;
Once in a while we could here a baby crying back there.&nbsp; Tears are
forming as I'm recalling this.&nbsp; We would also hear whispers through
out the entire house.&nbsp; When we went to bed we could here people running
up and down the stairs.&nbsp; Almost every night it would sound like someone
kicking a box down the hallway.&nbsp; Other strange things like faucets
turning on by themselves and strange knocking on the walls would happen
often.&nbsp; The one thing that happened to me when I was about 6 years
old I awoke to some of my toys floating above my head.&nbsp; I ran out
of my room, which was directly across from the playroom, and I heard our
record player playing.&nbsp; Just as I screamed for my mom everything stopped.&nbsp;
To this day my mom doesn't believe me.&nbsp; She believes that the house
was haunted from personal experiences that happened to her.&nbsp; Needless
to say we have moved from that house and now I live in a house where a
woman recently hung herself.&nbsp; Thank goodness she did not stay.</b>

<br><b>Supernatural Events</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: godsproperty24@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here are a few events that's happened to me and my brother in the
past few years.&nbsp; Maybe you can shed some light on these happenings.</b>
<br><b>First of all, our house is about 30 years old, and only one other
couple owned it before we moved in about 16 years ago.&nbsp; My parents
say that something is going on with our house.&nbsp; They said that a long
time ago, when I was about 2 or three, they heard a baby crying and they
went to see if it was me or my brother and we were both fast asleep.&nbsp;
I had never really had anything happen to me, up until last year, but my
brother has experienced one bone-chilling encounter that makes me shiver
just to write it. It was summer and we had stayed up really late talking.&nbsp;
It was about 2 or 3 in the morning and I had finally got him to get out
of my room.&nbsp; I had almost fallen asleep when he bursts into my room
shaking and breathing really hard.&nbsp; I was extremely angry at him for
scaring the heck out of me, because I thought he was playing a joke.&nbsp;
He panted out "I saw a black figure in the hallway on my way back from
the bathroom.&nbsp; I turned around and turned back and it waser I would
have heard him get up, because the floors are very creaky.&nbsp; I joked
that it was either a ghost or a burglar in the house, trying to lighten
the mood, even though I was scared to death.&nbsp; One of my friends asked
if I could lock my door.&nbsp; I said I could, but I didn't want to get
up.&nbsp; (I know, I'm a coward) After a year or two the noise finally
stopped and me and my friends went to sleep.&nbsp; We don't really talk
about that night.&nbsp; Those are the incidents that stick out in my mind
the most.&nbsp; Even though I wish they wouldn't.&nbsp; We also hear knocking,
all the time, everywhere in the house.&nbsp; I've gotten so use to it though
that when it happens I just smile.&nbsp; Also, when I was younger, I had
continuous nightmares.&nbsp; Not normal nightmares, but bloody, gory, horrifying
nightmares.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;It wasn't Santa Claus</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ibell386@fcg.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>A very good friend of mine told me of an incident that happened to
his brother, Tim, and his wife. I can honestly believe this story,as my
friend is not the type to ever make anything like this up, much less lie
to me. Besides, he still had a hard time even relating it to me.Anyway,
Tim and his wife were awaken in the night to see something climbing out
of their fireplace. When it "unfolded " itself and stood upright it was
around 6' tall and appeared somewhat birdlike with huge wings on its back.
The couple was paralyzed with fear and couldn't speak. The thing grabbed
Tim by the skin of his chest and dragged him across the room to the fireplace
where it attempted to pull him, then suddenly dropped him and disappeared
up the fireplace alone. The couple couldn't speak until the thing was gone.
Tim consulted his priest and his doctor, as he had laccerations on his
chest from the claws that grabbed him and floor burns on his knees from
being dragged. This happened about ten years ago in Streator, Il.</b>

<br><b>Ghost Related Problems</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: QuiltsFrmHom@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My home is only two years old. My husband and
I built it ourselves and it</b>
<br><b>sits on a hill in a small town. My daughter Courtney, who is fourteen
years</b>
<br><b>old, woke me up one night to tell me that her bathroom door was
locked. ((</b>
<br><b>Her bedroom has a joining bathroom that locks from the inside))&nbsp;
I assumed</b>
<br><b>she had turned the lock while she was in there earlier in the day
and then</b>
<br><b>walked out and shut the door behind her with it still locked by
accident.</b>
<br><b>Keep in mind this is not a dead-bolt. It is a simple turning lock
on the</b>
<br><b>handle.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I got up to investigate and sure enough
it was locked. She had to</b>
<br><b>use the bathroom in the main hall instead because I was not going
to try to</b>
<br><b>unlock it at 1:30 in the morning.&nbsp; The next morning I found
that I would have</b>
<br><b>to take the door off of its hinges. This didn't bother me so much,
I just</b>
<br><b>told her to be more careful.&nbsp; That night, she came into my
room again with</b>
<br><b>the same story. I told her to just go back to bed and I would have
her father</b>
<br><b>fix it in the morning. It seemed strange to me that it had happened
again,</b>
<br><b>but I knew it was just a simple mistake that anyone could make so
I didn't</b>
<br><b>get mad once again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day the door was took off the hinges
and unlocked once again.</b>
<br><b>Guess what happened that night? Yes, you're absolutely correct.&nbsp;
I was very</b>
<br><b>frustrated and began to think my daughter was either playing tricks
on me or</b>
<br><b>she was just very&nbsp; forgetful. I informed her that it had better
not, under</b>
<br><b>any circumstances, get locked again. I yelled and it upset her because
she</b>
<br><b>insisted it was not her forgetfulness. It stopped for three days.
I thought</b>
<br><b>it was my daughter and that her getting punished had made her stop
locking</b>
<br><b>the doors on purpose and I wouldn't have to bother with it anymore.
I was in</b>
<br><b>for a rude awakening....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday night I let Courtney stay at a friend's
house. None of the</b>
<br><b>doors became locked so I just knew it was her by this time. The
very next</b>
<br><b>morning my bathroom door was locked. I thought, "Well, maybe I did
lock it</b>
<br><b>myself by accident......that has to be it. Courtney couldn't have
locked it</b>
<br><b>to get me back, she hasn't got back from her friend's house yet."
I was very</b>
<br><b>confused but I still took it off its hinges.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the bathroom doors in our house still
become locked on their own.</b>
<br><b>I am getting very scared about this. I believe in ghosts, but I
never thought</b>
<br><b>I might have one in my home. It came as a shock to me when it actually</b>
<br><b>starting happening to me and it seems as if all my beliefs in spirits
are</b>
<br><b>being tested.</b>

<br><b>Hospital Haunts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cherrie@intertex.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story takes place this past Sunday, January 14,2001, I am a nurse
and I work at a small hospital.&nbsp; I and several of us at this hospital
have experienced different things with unknown beings.&nbsp; I have been
slapped in the back by something in one of my patients' room, the patient
didn't do it, she was lying in her bed and wasn't near her for her to do
it to me.&nbsp; Then there was a male patient who called the nurses station
to ask who slapped him and we didn't see anyone in his room nor come out
of his room.&nbsp; These are just a few things that have happend.&nbsp;
But what I am about to tell is this happened to me this past Sunday.&nbsp;
It was around 2030 pm I began passing medication to my patients.&nbsp;
I had parked my medication cart in front of this patient room and noticed
a slim, young man who was nicely dressed wearing a beige shirt, blue slacks
and a brown belt, standing next to her bed, looking down on her. I couldn't
see he face or his head.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was preparing the medication
I thought, I would give them a little more time to visit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;
I guess he saw me and decided to walk to the chair in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It&nbsp; was&nbsp; behind a curtain that gives privacy to patients when
the door is open.&nbsp; He sat down in it.&nbsp; I saw him walk but didn't
hear him make any noise, foot steps. The room was a little dark but had
light coming in&nbsp; from the hall.&nbsp; One of the nurses that was working
with me came to me and started talking and I told her not to talk to loud
due to a family member in the room.&nbsp; So I took the patient's meds
into the room, I knocked on the door and turned on the light.&nbsp; I looked
to the right of me to where this person should have been sitting in the
chair but the chair was empty.&nbsp; I looked around in this patients room
for the visitor and there was no one there.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no way
for this person to leave this room&nbsp; without me knowing it.&nbsp; I
wasn't scared.&nbsp; The patient began calling out to Timmy.&nbsp; She
has not done</b>
<br><b>this before.&nbsp; This patient has dementia and alzheimers disease.&nbsp;
So there was really no one to back me up to what I saw.&nbsp; But thats
ok, I know what I saw.............</b><b></b>

<br><b>Graveyard Stroll</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jgiddings@charter.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My friend and I were walking through the graveyard that is not even
a block away from my house. My friends and I used to go there allot just
to look around and sometimes bring flowers that we found on the path there.
Well my friend and I saw this hole near one of those graves. My friend
decided to put her hand down in the hole. I thought that she was totally
crazy. At that same time both of us heard someone yell at us.&nbsp; "Get
out of there and leave us alone."</b>
<br><b>My friend asked me if I heard that and I said yes. We both looked
at each other and we ran. We didn't even notice how stupid we must have
seemed thinking that we heard that voice and seen things that looked like
people. As we were running out we had to go through rusty old barbed wire.
My leg felt like it was being pulled back as I tried to get out. I yelled
to my friend that I was caught. She didn't believe me because my foot was
not caught on any barbed wire it was just kind floating is what she said.
When I yelled at her to help me the second time my foot fell and got scraped
by the spikes and the wire. We ran all the way home. She never came back
to the graveyard with me ever again. Every time I went back with someone
something would happen like we would hear voices or see things. When someone
new would come with me they never would came back. There was only one time
that a person came for a second time. That time nothing happened.&nbsp;
I don't know but&nbsp; I think that something try's to scare first timers
away and when someone comes a second time they can't scare that person.
This might sound unreal but we know what we heard and saw and it was more
than real.</b>

<br><b>Neighborhood Stories</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: MELASARG@southernco.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>A long time ago, well not too long ago, about 10 years ago, I lived
in an</b>
<br><b>old nieghborhood in Lithonia, GA.&nbsp; In this nieghborhood was
a very old</b>
<br><b>cemetary from around the 1700's or so.&nbsp; Now right about now,
your saying to</b>
<br><b>yourself, "Yeah right, a cemetary in your nieghborhood." but believe
me, if</b>
<br><b>you know the city, it's the only nieghborhood with a cemetary.&nbsp;
Anyway, I</b>
<br><b>had moved there back when I was around 5 or 6 years old, and life
was</b>
<br><b>ordinary for me as a child, or atleast I thought.&nbsp; A few days
ago, I</b>
<br><b>actually went to my therapist for a session.&nbsp; During this session
he wanted</b>
<br><b>to try some hypnosis on me so I said sure.&nbsp; As he had me under,
I started</b>
<br><b>seeing flashbacks of being a child in that old nieghborhood.&nbsp;
Once those</b>
<br><b>memories were awakened, I can remember seeing some strange things.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>was young, I was not a very popular kid and only had one friend
who just so</b>
<br><b>happened to live in the same nieghborhood as me.&nbsp; So on days
when he was</b>
<br><b>doing other things, I was kind of left on my own to find something
to do.</b>
<br><b>During that time, the area was still under alot of zoning for construction</b>
<br><b>so even though thier were alot of new houses being built, there
was also</b>
<br><b>alot of woodland.&nbsp; I used to hang out around my brother's friend
Shawns'</b>
<br><b>house and play G.I. Joe's on a huge granite rock.&nbsp; It just
so happens that</b>
<br><b>Shawns' house is right next to the cemetary.&nbsp; Many a time I
can recall</b>
<br><b>seeing figures out of the corner of my eye and hearing sounds only
to not</b>
<br><b>see anyone there.&nbsp; I am a very rational person, and even though
I believe in</b>
<br><b>ghosts I had never entertained the thought of hearing or seeing
one.&nbsp; I can</b>
<br><b>actually picture in my mind one day when I was playing at that granite
rock.</b>
<br><b>I had my G.I. Joe's out and was doing my thing when I heard my name.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>day was sunny and quiet and no one was outside in that part of the</b>
<br><b>nieghborhood.&nbsp; The strange part is I remember it was a woman's
voice and I</b>
<br><b>can actually still hear it saying my name in my head.&nbsp; I can
also remember</b>
<br><b>times when I would see tall men out of the corner of my eye, or
someone just</b>
<br><b>beyond the clarity of sight, like a figure running away quickly
with no</b>
<br><b>sound or disturbance to the objects around them.&nbsp; Maybe it's
an active</b>
<br><b>imagination coming back to haunt me, but if it isn't, I hope it
doesn't stay</b>
<br><b>because I'm a fradey cat.</b>

<p><b>Experiences with "Shadows"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: malkadoran@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I found your website and read a few of the stories...</b>
<br><b>About two months ago, something... interesting...</b>
<br><b>started to happen in my house.</b>
<br><b>This started about November of 2000. At least, that's</b>
<br><b>when I first noticed it. Boy, was it a wake-up call</b>
<br><b>(no pun intended).</b>
<br><b>I'm a light sleeper, and the slightest noise or change</b>
<br><b>in air temperature can wake me up. I also tend to get</b>
<br><b>up at about 3am or 4am and do some work. I'm a web</b>
<br><b>developer, so I can do some projects on my computer at</b>
<br><b>home. To do that, I've got my computer and network</b>
<br><b>equipment in my bedroom. I leave it on all the time,</b>
<br><b>so there is always a hum from the fans and the</b>
<br><b>blinking green, red, blue, etc. lights from the</b>
<br><b>various equipment.</b>
<br><b>Anyway... One night, I really needed to get up early</b>
<br><b>to work on a project. I turned on my MP3 player on my</b>
<br><b>computer, got the volume just loud enough to get me to</b>
<br><b>get up and turn it off, and then set the stereo to</b>
<br><b>3am. I know this, because I had set the alarm time for</b>
<br><b>6am a few days before, and I had to change it back</b>
<br><b>that night. The function was set, and I turned around</b>
<br><b>to get into bed. I was about 11:45 or so...</b>
<br><b>The bed and computer desk are on the opposite sides of</b>
<br><b>th room, with the bed on the southern wall, the</b>
<br><b>computer and door on the northern wall, the windows</b>
<br><b>(with large wooden blinds I keep shut all the time) on</b>
<br><b>the eastern wall, and my closet door and bathroom door</b>
<br><b>on the western wall. I sleep with my feet towards the</b>
<br><b>computer.</b>
<br><b>The first incident went like this: At 2:58, I wake up.</b>
<br><b>I rarely beat the clock this early. What woke me up</b>
<br><b>was the sound of keystrokes on my computer. About four</b>
<br><b>or five rather loud clicks. I opened my eyes and</b>
<br><b>looked down to see a black shadow blocking out the</b>
<br><b>lights from my equipment, and then just dissolving</b>
<br><b>away.</b>
<br><b>Funny things is, I wasn't scared, just very angry. I</b>
<br><b>am not a horror fan, I don't enjoy slasher movies, and</b>
<br><b>I can't stand roller coasters. I don't really like</b>
<br><b>ghost stories, and just the thought of seeing a ghost</b>
<br><b>give me goosebumps. This thing just annoys me, but I'm</b>
<br><b>not frightened of it... Don't really know why.</b>
<br><b>I did the usual - I asked of my parents or</b>
<br><b>grandparents had been in my room the night before. No</b>
<br><b>one else had been there but me and my "shadow."</b>
<br><b>I've seen it a few other times</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; - While getting a drink from the kitchen, I saw a</b>
<br><b>shadow dart out of my room and down a fully-lit short</b>
<br><b>hall to the garage. All I saw was a three-foot tall</b>
<br><b>shape, a torso and two legs, but that was enough</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; - While working on a project late at night, I've</b>
<br><b>felt something watching, turned around, and saw a</b>
<br><b>shadow on the wall dissolve before my eyes. The light</b>
<br><b>from a lamp was shining on just that spot on the wall.</b>
<br><b>My younger brother, while back from college during the</b>
<br><b>holiday break, had something wake him up at 4am and</b>
<br><b>"scan" him. He said he felt a tingling sensation start</b>
<br><b>on the left side of his body, move slowly to his right</b>
<br><b>side, and back again. He looked up, and saw a shadow</b>
<br><b>blocking the lights from across the street just before</b>
<br><b>it dissolved. I had not told him anything about what I</b>
<br><b>had seen. He came to me and told me about it, ending</b>
<br><b>with "What the hell was that?" I think it annoyed both</b>
<br><b>of us, but neither of us were frightened of it.</b>
<br><b>It has make a few more appearances over the past two</b>
<br><b>months. I borrowed a digital camera from the office</b>
<br><b>and I just tried to take photos... the camera doesn't</b>
<br><b>want to work. I just tested it on Friday, and had</b>
<br><b>taken a few test photos at the office. If this is the</b>
<br><b>shadow's sense of humor, I'm not laughing.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Down Under</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: san_dimas_lil@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My name's Liliana, I'm 23, I'm from Australia.</b>
<br><b>I was recently on your Shadowlands website, and I came across where
I could</b>
<br><b>submit my own ghost story. I admit it's not very scary, but it's
true, and</b>
<br><b>some people might find it interesting.</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years ago I moved into my own place, and while the first few
nights</b>
<br><b>weren't too bad - just the odd clanking, and smashing, what followed
just</b>
<br><b>got plain annoying!!</b>
<br><b>I have an old wooden cupboard, with removeable doors, and, I'd often
wake up</b>
<br><b>in the morning and find the doors removed, and my clothes on the
floor.</b>
<br><b>Also, the moving around of certain pieces of furniture was frequent,
and</b>
<br><b>allot of the time, I'd think I've lost something, then a few days
later find</b>
<br><b>it somewhere completely different to where I'd left it!</b>
<br><b>Anyways, I got my friends over one night, and we tried a Ouija Board
(yes</b>
<br><b>I'm aware of how dangerous they are, but I'm an experienced Ouija
Board user</b>
<br><b>so gimme a break, lol).</b>
<br><b>Anyways, we discovered that the ghost in my house had lived there
for a long</b>
<br><b>time, and was really quite friendly.</b>
<br><b>His name was Jonothan and he had lived in the house with his parents,
until</b>
<br><b>he died when he was 13 of Leukimia.</b>
<br><b>Jonothan explained that he didn't like the way I had redesigned
the house,</b>
<br><b>that's why he was moving the furniture. And the whole thing with
taking my</b>
<br><b>stuff and putting it in different places of the house, that was
just his way</b>
<br><b>of playing hide &amp; seek.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I told Jonothan that I didn't mind sharing the house with
him, as</b>
<br><b>long as he didn't keep hiding my things, and throwing my clothes
around, and</b>
<br><b>moving the furniture.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, we came to an agreement that we would share the house, and
anything</b>
<br><b>he didn't like, he'd try to live with it.</b>
<br><b>So, yeah, I haven't heard much out of him lately - just the occasional</b>
<br><b>flickering of lights, or moving of furniture OCCASIONALLY, just
to let me</b>
<br><b>know he's still there.</b>
<br><b>I've now learnt not to move the furniture back to where I had it
, after all</b>
<br><b>he's been living there allot longer than me.</b>
<br><b>Yeh, so that's my story. Thanks!</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Friend's Story...</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; charlene.klaus.l434@statefarm.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a story that a friend told me after I was in his house.&nbsp;
He told me that right after his parent's were married his dad was driving
home from work and for no reason turned down a street and stopped at a
house that he just had to buy.&nbsp; He went up to the door and ansked
if they were willing to sell their home.&nbsp; And hey said that they were
just talking about it.&nbsp; The house had been in the family for many
generations until then.&nbsp; Come to find out some of the family practiced
black magic.&nbsp; There is still a pentigon in the attic.&nbsp; Before
my friend's father bought the house he was the nicest person ever.&nbsp;
After moving into the home and having a few children his father started
getting abusive.&nbsp; He would always sit on the porch with a strange
look in his eye. Or in the basement polishing his gun collection&nbsp;
After most of his family grew up and moved out, his father left, and his
mother left to another state to take care of her dying mother. It was only
he and his older brother left in the four story house.&nbsp; So his brother
made the third level another apertment.&nbsp; Over the years many strange
things would happen to the people living in the apartment.&nbsp; One family
lived there and one of the brothers chased the other brother out with a
butcher knife.&nbsp; They moved very soon after that.&nbsp; A couple of
girls moved in and were so scared they left one day and never came back
not even for ther stuff.&nbsp; And my friends brother had made a bedroom
in the basement and if anyonr other than him would stay in that room they
would have a dream of a man without a face dragging them out of bed and
into the bathroom and they would wake up in the bathroom.&nbsp; Before
I was told all of this stuff I want to that house to help my friend move
out and his brother asked us to stay (This house is in Chicago, IL and
we lived in&nbsp; St. Paul, MN).&nbsp; Not knowing the houses history I
still know I did not like being there.&nbsp; I knew I did not want to be
left in the attic alone when we were getting boxes from there.&nbsp; I
just felt uneasy.&nbsp; After we got home he told me about the house and
the reason why he left (without most of his stuff) is one morning while
he was still sleeping his brother came crashing through his bedroom wall
with a sledge hammer saying over and over, "I have to change this house".&nbsp;
So we came to the conclusion that it may not be haunted but the house itself
me be evil.</b>

<br><b>Haunting in Old Aberdeen, Scotland.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: u32smm@abdn.ac.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a student at Aberdeen University, Scotland and had a few strange</b>
<br><b>episodes at the Hillhead Halls of Residence (student accomodation).
The</b>
<br><b>strangest occurrence was that of my friends and I being 'haunted'
by a</b>
<br><b>7-foot tall 'man' who was wearing a long black coat and a black
rimmed</b>
<br><b>hat with a dip in the middle (cannot remember what it is called!).
This</b>
<br><b>thing would appear to us in that we each could see it for a second
and</b>
<br><b>then it would disappear, even though we could still feel it. It
appeared</b>
<br><b>to me in a local night club...and I hadn't been drinking, so it
wasn't</b>
<br><b>that. It would also appear in my flat and my friends flats and even
one</b>
<br><b>time it appeared when I was in a laboratory class at uni. I ignored
it</b>
<br><b>and to make sure I recognised that it wasd there it moved the blackboard</b>
<br><b>rubber across the board (where the chalk is kept). No-one else saw
it</b>
<br><b>there. You probably think this is really crazy, but it drove my
friends</b>
<br><b>and I almost mad for 3/4 of a year. If you know of anyone else who
has</b>
<br><b>encountered this...as I have the feeling that this thing hadn't
actually</b>
<br><b>lived but was something quite different, I'd be very pleased to
hear</b>
<br><b>from them.</b>
<br><b>Another occurrence happened when I was on my way to the shop on
campus</b>
<br><b>and something made me look to my left as I walked along. To the
left</b>
<br><b>where there is a narrow single road and trees/bushes which slopes
away</b>
<br><b>down to a path and the River Don there was also something quite
beyond</b>
<br><b>the usual. I saw between 6 and 8 cloaked and hooded black figures
which</b>
<br><b>looked as if they were 'floating' towards me. I couldn't actually
see</b>
<br><b>their feet but they were moving through the bushes and grass. I
quickly</b>
<br><b>ran to the shop and then totally forgot that I had seen anything.
It was</b>
<br><b>sooo strange. I only remembered when I came back out of the shop
and</b>
<br><b>decided to walk the other way back to the flat. But then I decided
to</b>
<br><b>walk the same way and prove that I didn't have to look in that</b>
<br><b>direction. The problem was that I just couldn't not look to my right
and</b>
<br><b>when I did they were there again. I've never run so fast!</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I just thought that I'd let you know what strange things
have</b>
<br><b>happened in Aberdeen and that I'm sure there are more things that
have</b>
<br><b>happened here, but people just don't talk enough about it. Afterall,
we</b>
<br><b>are certainly not mad and there are too many othere people with
similar</b>
<br><b>experiences!!!</b>

<p><b>I was only a boy&nbsp;&nbsp; of 7years of age when we lived in a
haunted house in Beaconsfield w.a in Perth Australia you had a feeling
of someone watching you or all the time behind you in the hall that was
where my toy box was and I would never walk in there I would only run and
grab what ever toy was on top in my box as I flew past.</b>
<br><b>at 8 pm on the dot every night a door leading from that hall to
the lounge room which was very hard to open because of the carpet, would
open on its own and something would appear to go from there through the
lounge room to the dining room there was swinging saloon type doors on
the dining room and they would swing as it went through we got used to
it as it happened every night at the same time on the dot.</b>
<br><b>in the morning at the same time every morning 6am&nbsp; we would
hear foot steps on the wooden veranda out the front my brother and I asked
our mum who it was and she said it was the milk man my brother at the time
was only 6years old and mum did not want to scare us but the truth was
that we did not have our milk delivered,so one day my brother and I decided
that we wanted to see the milk man so we waited for him at 6 am sure enough
the footsteps started we could see the floor boards moving with them but
no one was there.</b>
<br><b>another time I was in bed asleep when something woke me up I looked
down to see a man sitting on the end of my bed so I threw the blankets
over me and waited I looked again after a few minutes he was gone so I
got up and went and told my mum she believed me but at the time told me
I was dreaming but she knew the truth.</b>
<br><b>one night my aunty stayed in the house alone with her little dog
at 8pm the lounge door opened and the dogs heckles went up he watched something
go from the lounge door to the dining room door growling at it as it went
then he settled down again after that we sold the house the people who
bought it from us stayed only a short time and it has been on the market

<br><b>Nici</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Kjr0920@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>my story.... My best friend died on 8/16/99&nbsp; from a motor vehicle
accident,</b>
<br><b>she had just turned 30.&nbsp; The reason I mention her birthday
was from the</b>
<br><b>moment she turned 29 to her 30th birthday she was very concerned
about</b>
<br><b>"getting old".&nbsp; Well two weeks after her 30th birthday she
was killed.&nbsp; Nici</b>
<br><b>left behind, a heart broken fiancee and&nbsp; four doberman pinchers&nbsp;
(her babies)</b>
<br><b>that needed to be taken care of.&nbsp; One evening about 2-3 weeks
after her</b>
<br><b>death, I was at her home, had let the dogs out, feed them and was
now</b>
<br><b>returning them to the basement, this was no easy task, they did
not want to</b>
<br><b>go down.&nbsp; While I was struggling with the dogs I heard Nici
calling me,</b>
<br><b>telling me that she wanted to tell me something.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't
even think about</b>
<br><b>my response, it just came out and I told her a little irritated
that I was</b>
<br><b>too busy getting the dogs down and to hold on.&nbsp; I had totally
forgotten that</b>
<br><b>she was no longer here, it wasn't until I closed the door and turned
that it</b>
<br><b>occurred to me that she was gone.&nbsp; I have to admit that I left
the house</b>
<br><b>very, very quickly.&nbsp; I also regret doing that since I have
wondered what she</b>
<br><b>had to say.</b>
<br><b>During that month I had some pictures developed that was taken at
the house</b>
<br><b>on 8/26/99 - this was due to a very close friend turning 30.&nbsp;
There was</b>
<br><b>supposed to have been a big party for Nici and this other friend.&nbsp;
We decided</b>
<br><b>to have a small gathering of&nbsp; the "gang" at Nici's home.&nbsp;
One of the pictures</b>
<br><b>was of her dog Blue and myself but there is a "mist" in the picture.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>mist is infront of Blue but it is very clear.&nbsp; I still have
the picture.</b>
<br><b>It's nice to know that Nici came to the party.</b>
<br><b>One other thing occurred.&nbsp; Since a young child I have categorized
homes, some</b>
<br><b>happy, some sad, most have no feeling.&nbsp; I don't know when this
started but I</b>
<br><b>have done this for many years.&nbsp; Prior to Nici's death the home
had no "feel"</b>
<br><b>to it.&nbsp; After Nici's death it was very, very sad feeling, when
you entered</b>
<br><b>the house it just pressed in on you.&nbsp; I do not believe that
this was Nici,</b>
<br><b>this may sound strange but I always thought that this was from Farris
her</b>
<br><b>fiancee, they had lived together for six years.</b>

at meeeeeeeeeee" and slapped me across the face, so I slapped her back.
I hadn't even slapped her that</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;t hard but I had burns across my hands. On my face where she
had slapped me, my face was also burnt. She had been sitting at the foot
of my bed cross legged and I guess I fainted because the next morning when
I woke up, my face hurt and I couldn't remember past the last above incident.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I use to be a total sceptic of ghosts and those sort of things until
I had my own experience with something that I still to this day cannot
understand. A few years ago I dated a man that lived in a house in the
older part of the town that I am from. I stayed at this man's home quite
a few nights and one night I decided to go to bed early. As I layed in
bed, not being able to get to sleep right away, I noticed that the light
in the other bedroom had come on and I heard the closet door open and the
sound of someone going up the steps to the attic and then the light went
off. I for some reason thought it was a little peculiar but brushed it
off as my date putting his guitar away because he stores it in the attic
in case someone breaks into his house; and a short while later finally
went to sleep. The next evening when I went back to my date's house I noticed
the guitar out and made a mention of hearing him putting it in the attic
the night before. My date went very pale and started shaking a little bit,
he then stated that he had left his guitar out last night and that he didn't
go into the other bedroom for anything. He said that he had had some similar
experiences happen to him and that he had had previous dates swear that
there was something or someone there with them while he was away. We went
over every possible explination and could find nothing to explain it but
I did realize that I didn't hear the light come (it is an old house with
the push button switches that are very loud) I just saw the light come
on and heard the very distinct sound of someone going into the attic that
is probably why I thought it was peculiar but didn't pay much attention.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Strange Things in Hyattsville</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Aaron@cua.edu</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have visited your web-site and read all of the articles. In reading</b>
<br><b>some of these articles and stories I was reminded of some strange
things</b>
<br><b>that have happened at my home. Before I go on I would like to state
that</b>
<br><b>I am a rational person, I live a normal life, 9-5 job, I am college</b>
<br><b>educated and I don't frighten very easily. I have ruled out all</b>
<br><b>reasonable natural explanations to these strange occurrences so
I</b>
<br><b>thought I would tell you my story and get your advice.</b>
<br><b>I guess I should start with some background information about the
house.</b>
<br><b>The house was built soon after WW2 c.1947. It has had only one owner,
my</b>
<br><b>grandparents, my grandfather died in 1990 and I still live there
with my</b>
<br><b>grandmother. There is no strange history about the house or the</b>
<br><b>surrounding area that I am aware of. The only person to have died
there</b>
<br><b>was my grandfather. It has been and still is a normal, happy home.
The</b>
<br><b>only event that I could describe as "violent" was when back about
30</b>
<br><b>years ago, someone hanged themselves in the woods that are below
the</b>
<br><b>house. All of the strange events have occurred in the basement of
the</b>
<br><b>house over the years. They are few and far between, but none the
less</b>
<br><b>memorable and easy to recall.</b>
<br><b>The basement is basically in two halves. As you go down the stairs
you</b>
<br><b>come into the rec room. This rec room is finished off, complete
with</b>
<br><b>wood paneled walls and tiled floor. Directly at the bottom of the
steps</b>
<br><b>to the right as your are coming down is a door that opens to a</b>
<br><b>storage/utility/workroom. This room is shaped like an upside-down
"L".</b>
<br><b>As you walk toward the back of the house there's my grandfather's</b>
<br><b>workbench, you hang a right and there's the washing machine and
at the</b>
<br><b>end of this "hallway" is a small bathroom.&nbsp; There is also a
second door</b>
<br><b>in the rec room that when opens right up to the washing machine.</b>
<br><b>Now I'll tell you about the events that have struck me as odd to
say the</b>
<br><b>least.</b>
<br><b>The first time I recall something strange happening is when I was
7(I'm</b>
<br><b>24 now). I was sent down to the basement to play in the rec room
so as</b>
<br><b>not to disturb my grandmother's Wheel of Fortune time. I remember</b>
<br><b>wandering into that utility room and walking around. But as I recall</b>
<br><b>though, when I turned the corner and started heading towards the
area</b>
<br><b>where the washing machine was I stopped and decided not to go back</b>
<br><b>there. Now as a child I was never afraid of the dark but when I
turned</b>
<br><b>the corner towards the washing machine and bathroom this awful fear
came</b>
<br><b>over me and I quickly turned back and got the hell out of the utility</b>
<br><b>room. Ever since that day and up until the time I was 12 I would
NEVER</b>
<br><b>go into the basement after dark without turning on every light and
then</b>
<br><b>turning them off and running upstairs as fast as I could when I
was</b>
<br><b>finished playing or what-not in the basement. Even to this day I
get an</b>
<br><b>uneasy feeling when I go down there. I even like to have doors that
lead</b>
<br><b>to the utility room locked when I'm down there watching TV or on
my</b>
<br><b>computer. The thing I think is really strange is, sometimes I have
these</b>
<br><b>feelings of dread and other times I don't.</b>
<br><b>Another one of the strange things that happens are objects that
seem to</b>
<br><b>disappear and then reappear a few days later in the same spot where
I</b>
<br><b>was looking for them. A good example would be my CDs. What I do
when I</b>
<br><b>listen to CDs is I keep my favorite ones handy i.e. on top of the
CD</b>
<br><b>player. One day I went down in the basement to get this one particular</b>
<br><b>CD and it was gone. I asked my grandmother if she had seen it or
had</b>
<br><b>moved it she said she hadn't. I knew my brother or my cousin hadn't
been</b>
<br><b>there, my brother likes to "borrow" things. I looked all through
my CD</b>
<br><b>collection, in my car, under furniture, at work and I couldn't find
it.</b>
<br><b>Some days later my girlfriend had asked me if I had certain CD she
could</b>
<br><b>borrow, I did but it was one of my older ones that I hadn't listened
to</b>
<br><b>in some time, and when I went to get it, sure enough there was the</b>
<br><b>"missing" CD near the bottom of a stack of my older CDs. I know
that</b>
<br><b>nobody could have moved it since I had just listened to that CD
the</b>
<br><b>night before and had gotten up that morning to put it in my bag
to take</b>
<br><b>to work and listen to. Similar things have happened with other objects</b>
<br><b>around the house, my wrist watch has on several occasions shown
up in</b>
<br><b>the basement next to my computer, after I knew I took it off and
left it</b>
<br><b>in my room, video tapes have had similar things happen to them.</b>
<br><b>Lastly are the strange sightings we have seen. My first sighting</b>
<br><b>occurred when I was about 11. I was sent to the good old basement
to get</b>
<br><b>some soda for dinner (we had an old refrigerator down in the rec
room at</b>
<br><b>the time). As I walked down I noticed the utility room's door at
the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the steps was ajar, I went to close it and I as I looked
in</b>
<br><b>there I swear I saw a small snake slithering over some boxes. I
slammed</b>
<br><b>the door and ran upstairs and told my grandfather about it, he</b>
<br><b>investigated but he couldn't find anything. I almost ruled this
sighting</b>
<br><b>out because snakes had gotten into the basement in the past, but
the</b>
<br><b>fact that it was springtime, and the boxes were pretty high up led
me to</b>
<br><b>think it could be something else. My second and last sighting happened
a</b>
<br><b>few days after my 18th birthday. I went down in the rec room to
listen</b>
<br><b>to my walkman and as I often did I would walk around, dance, or
fiddle</b>
<br><b>around with some of the old junk I had accumulated down there while
I</b>
<br><b>was listening to my music. I had some blue plastic crates stacked
up on</b>
<br><b>a book shelf. I caught something white out of the corner of my eye,
I</b>
<br><b>spun around to see what it was, and it was a black and white cat
sitting</b>
<br><b>on the crates, I blinked and it was gone. It startled me but, not
enough</b>
<br><b>to send me from the basement. The most interesting sighting happened
to</b>
<br><b>my grandmother about a year ago. She was doing laundry in that utility</b>
<br><b>room one afternoon, she had moved towards the storage area to hang
a few</b>
<br><b>clothes on the line, she said she got this feeling that she was
being</b>
<br><b>watched, when she turned around she saw the image of an old man.
She</b>
<br><b>blinked and he was gone. I asked her if it was my grandfather(he
died in</b>
<br><b>the house), she said it wasn't, and she didn't recognize who it
was. Now</b>
<br><b>my grandmother is a total skeptic but I figure she must have seen</b>
<br><b>something for her to mention it to me. The last encounter I had
happened</b>
<br><b>in the early fall. I was in the basement watching TV and I had drifted</b>
<br><b>off to sleep on a make-shift couch I had put down there. I was sound</b>
<br><b>asleep when I felt a sharp jab on both of my shoulders and the words</b>
<br><b>"wake up!". I sat right up looked around and saw I had been asleep
for</b>
<br><b>over an hour. I quickly shut off the TV and went to bed.</b>
<br><b>I had thought of getting some people involved that have the equipment
to</b>
<br><b>check this out but my grandmother would never go for it. I'm almost</b>
<br><b>certain there is something there. I don't feel physically threatened
but</b>
<br><b>I do get an uneasy feeling from time to time. I cannot explain the</b>
<br><b>sightings or the objects being "lost". With the information I have</b>
<br><b>provided, can you give me an educated guess as to if I have some
kind of</b>
<br><b>spirit in my home. And if you think I do is there anything else
I can do</b>
<br><b>to further determine if it is a ghost of some kind.</b>

<p><b>Home Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: [gordon.porritt@nem-co.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Im just writing to say how impressed I am at how you dealt with your
ghostly</b>
<br><b>experiences.</b>
<br><b>My family and myself were haunted when I was eight years old in
an old</b>
<br><b>bungalow at a Surrey estate in England,(UK)which bred horses. I
thankfully</b>
<br><b>only experienced the noises and smells, however my mother &amp;
father</b>
<br><b>experienced full spectral visuals and even spoke to them of which
my parents</b>
<br><b>didn't tell me about till much later in life(thank god!) my brother
saw,</b>
<br><b>heard, smelt nothing.</b>
<br><b>One of the daily experiences was for me to wake up at 03:00am in
the morning</b>
<br><b>everyday for a year, you can understand by the end of it I was in
a bit of a</b>
<br><b>mental mess and I am sure now that if I ever did see one I would
have</b>
<br><b>probably lost my mind.</b>
<br><b>However when I look back on the whole experience I feel it has effected
me</b>
<br><b>in a good way. I as a person never get low as I just have to remember
my</b>
<br><b>experiences to realise I am so better off now than then. Also it
only helps</b>
<br><b>me confirm the existence of god, the power of spirit and heaven
and hell</b>
<br><b>(The bible gave us respite from the haunting).</b>
<br><b>The only negative thing is I cannot sleep in a room in complete
darkness</b>
<br><b>ever again! and this does annoy my girlfriend little as I am nearly
thirty</b>
<br><b>now.</b>
