<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I grew up in a duplex home, on </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Bosler
  Avenue</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was 5 years old, until I was 15
years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a steep narrow staircase in the
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everytime you<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">would walk down the stairs it felt
like someone was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">right behind you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never turned around because I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">too scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a child I would always run down the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stairs because the feeling was so
intense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brother<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">did the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents would always scold us<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">for running down the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because they were so<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">steep, they were afraid we would
fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">time at night that we would hear
sounds in the attic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It sounded like crumpling
paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There was also one bedroom that
was extremely cold. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It was my room first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hated sleeping there. It<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">always felt cold, and on many
occasions the door would<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">slam shut, or items would fall or
appear in different<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">places. The door was cracked, so
it was difficult to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">close by hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It needed to be forcefully pushed shut<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">in order to close comlpetely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it slammed shut on<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">its own, it always closed
completely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I disliked the room so much, I
traded rooms with my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">younger brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He felt uncomfortable in the room<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So much so that my parents ended up using
that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They didn't have any problem with the room<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">other than the feeling of
coldness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On one occasion, my father came
upstairs and saw<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">someone standing in the bathroom
out of the corner of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">his eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He proceeded to his bedroom and called out<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">"Let me know when the
bathroom is available."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">didn't hear anything and after a
few minutes he looked<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">in the bathroom again and no one
was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">else had been upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We never really discussed the
feeling in the stairway<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">until we moved from the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember saying to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my family that I always felt like
there was someone<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">breathing down my neck when I came
down the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After we started discussing it, we
found that we all<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">had that feeling, but never talked
about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We asked<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">some of our family and friends if
they ever felt<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">uncomfortable in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone one we spoke<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">with mentioned the same feeling of
a presence behind<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">them when walking down the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Me and the Others<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Since I was little I've been
sensitive to ghosts. Same time I had dreams <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that would later turn out to be
true, could tell which song was next on the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">radio, knew who the phone call was
too etc. My experiences tends to happen <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">at times where I'm either feeling
low or just 'open' towards the other side. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My stories:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As a little girl I didn't like
being on my room after it got dark or darker <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">when it was summertime. I remember
feeling being watched and something <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">wasn't right. Same time I was very
afraid for the door leading to the back <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of our house and the stables. I
felt something was looking at me and wanted <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to hurt me. This was from I was
around 6 and stopped when I was 12.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sometimes they would show up only
once. Once I was on bed and was close to <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">falling asleep, I suddenly heard a
voice calling my name. I woke up <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">completely and looked into the
corner of my room and there was an old woman <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there. I couldn't see her clearly
because she was kinda blurry but she had a <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">friendly feeling about her. She
then disappeared and I never saw again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I was 17 my dog died and I
was devastated. A few weeks later I heard <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">him coming up to my room from the
kitchen and 'saw' him enter my room. He <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">then jumped up on my bed, walked
around three times before sighing and got <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">down. I could feel him on my bed
and against my leg. When I tried to touch <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">him he disappeared. It did however
make me feel a lot better after he came <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and visited me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My parents farm where most of the
events happened is old. It burnt down once <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and there seem to be quite a lot
of ghostly activity. In the barn my parents <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">got their car. Since I was little
I was afraid being there alone. I felt <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">something waas wrong and that
something was hanging in the dark. I always <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">felt uneasy there untill a few
years ago that my mum told me that someone <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">had hanged himself there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My worst experience I've had was
when I was around 15-17 years old. My room <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was connected to the kitchen by a
little hallway. From the kitchen you can <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">go directly to the two
livingrooms. The last one I've never felt easy in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Was always feeling unnaturally
cold and just weird.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I woke up
and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my room was ice cold. I heard
someone open the door from the hall to the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">kitchen. It was a man, I somehow
knew and he was going directly to the last <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of the livingrooms. Somehow I was
there when he went there. I saw him take <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">his rifle and shoot himself. It
was feelings more than actually seeing him <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">doing it. I then was back in my
body but heard him fall down on the floor, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">moved a bit and moaned before he
'died'. The second that happened the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">coldness disappeared and I could
breath again. I told my friend at that time <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">about it but I was too afraid to
ask my parents. One day I sort of jokingly <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">asked if anyone had shot himself
in that room. My dad turned around and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">looked at me with a strange look
"Yes. Your Godmother's father shot himself <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there'. They hadn't told me
because my godmother didn't like me to know. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">found his grave and it had
happened the exact day he had killed himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I've had nice experiences though.
A friend of my parents and their friends <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">killed herself. My friend was
really devastated about it and couldn't get <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">over it. One day we were in the
kitchen I saw a sort of fog that then turned <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">into a ghostly hand. It stroked
her head as to sooth her. After it <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">disapeared my friend looked at me
and said: "She was here". My friend then <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">told me that she had felt peace
and that the friend had told her that she <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was happy now. To both of us it
meant a lot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The latest year the 'happenings'
happens without any real pattern. Last year <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">when I was at my parents and sleeping
in my old rooms, I didn't get any <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sleep for the 4 days I was there.
There was a presence in the room and it <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was not a pleasant one. It just
radiated hatred and it was pointed at me for <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">some reason. The next time I got
home it wasn't in there but then I had to <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sleep in my mum's bedroom. I was
woken up by someone slamming their hands <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">into the bed very hard. I
looked<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at the end of the bed and I saw a
shadow <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">standing there but then
disappeared. Since then I haven't felt it. For some <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">reason I knew it was male but I
don't know why it felt so badly about me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I'm home at my parents now
there's a young girl there, something I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">can't feel what is and a man. None
of these are evil but just looking out <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">for me. I've seen the girl from
the corner of my eyes and seen her reflected <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">in the mirror. I think they are
protecting me and just looking out for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Sometimes I can enter a house and
know that there's more than just what the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">eye sees. I've felt the presence
of family or just passing-by'ers. I think <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that my parents house and me makes
a energy field where they can enter. Some <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stays. Some doesn't.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I got one in my room where I live
now. Just a little prankster really. Turns <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">on my computer or opens all the
cupboards. I did have an old man who loved <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to watch me shower. I told him
that it was rude and I didn't like it. Since <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">then he hasn't been here. I call
him my 'dirty old bastard'. Same time <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there's a girl running every night
on the upper floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My brother is sensitive too but
apparently never experienced the same as I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">have at my parents house. Seems
I'm the one that they get attracted to. Also <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My building was built in the early
1800's<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We have had experiences within
this build that are questionable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We call our presence
"Felix"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I first purchased this
building in 1985 we use to hear a rocking chair located on the second or top
floor of this building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I asked the
previous owner and showed her the location of where we were hearing this chair
rock, she stated that is where her father had his rocking chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The upstairs was completely emptied at the
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The upstairs had the latched
doors, yet I would find doors opened even after I knew I had shut them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lights go on for no apparent reason, the same
with blow driers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower or first
floor is a Barber shop, turns out so was Felix.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have found things moved, there are so many different thingsm I
thought I'd bring it to your attention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My building is in </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">West Warwick</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others would swear to the things I would tell
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its OK Felix has been here far
longer then we have, and we have no problem with having Felix around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Let me just start off with I have
always been sensitive to paranormal stuff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I guess it must be that I am willing to accept it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well anyhow about 6 or 7 months ago My Boyfriend
at the time (Mike), his friend (Rob), and my best friend (Anni) made a trip to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Tombstone</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole reason we went was because Mike had
been looking up everything he could on ghosts, he gets into little kicks and
you just gotta go with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we pack up
our digital camera expecting the most horrifying trip of our life (oh the
thrill).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By time we had gotten to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Tombstone</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> it was
all but shut down for the night being as it was early evening on a Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We walked around to all the places that were
still open and explored, taking picture through windows of the places that were
"empty".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well the evening went
fairly uneventful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We talked to a few
locals and heard some of the stories and we had some dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had parked in the parking lot of the old court
house, which has always been very creepy to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we were walking to the car I got a very strange feeling and I told
Mike that I wanted to leave right then and there, no more ghost hunting I
needed to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well we all get in the
car, it was probably </span><st1:time hour="20" minute="0"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">8pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> or so and
every light in the court house was out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the most part </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Tombstone</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> was empty
and everyone had left for the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tell Rob, who was driving that I just had a feeling we should take a picture of
the court house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stopped put the car
in reverse backed up and took the picture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In one of the first floor windows there was a light, not a light like
from a camera flash or a light on inside the courthouse it was a candle light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kind of candle you see in old movies, the
stick kind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clear as day you could see
what it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well the beauty of a
digital camera is you can see these kind of things right away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing the light we decided to take one more
and in the second picture there was nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No light, no reflection from the flash.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it was from the flash we had not moved at all and it would have made
the same light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don't worry my story is
just about over stay with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well Mike
being a tuff guy, generally does not show emotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Especially not in front of his friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well he gets real quiet and as we are driving
home just pulling out of town he says "I feel so sad, like my heart is
just sad".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then tells everyone
in the car that he has been feeling terrible sadness since we got in the car at
the court house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually as we get
farther from </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Tombstone</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> he says
he feels better and that it has passed, but still what an unnerving
thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it was someone who was
put to death unjustly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe someone
just didn't want to be found out, but what ever it was it is something I will
remember for the rest of my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh the
other pictures we took, about six of them had things I can not explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One is of a man dressed in a black hat and a
black jacket, he's a cowboy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of us
in the group thought the man just looked out of place even in this town of old
west cowboys and robbers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A picture was
taken of him just as he came to stop under a street light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't even look at that picture until we
got home that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of the man
standing under the street light all that is seen is what looks like blurred
rainbow of light crossing the street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ghost?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could write for days of all the things that
have happened to me through out my life, if you have any questions or you want
to know more please email me at <a href="mailto:almostpretty1982@yahoo.com">almostpretty1982@yahoo.com</a><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">By: j_wrobel_77@hotmail.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My story starts back in 1991 when
I first hooked up with my then boyfriend, now husband. My boyfriend lived on
the bottom floor of a house that his aunt owned. His aunt and her family lived
on the second floor. His cousin was my best friend and so I was always at the
house. We had a small, close nit group of friends and were over her house one
time playing, truth or dare. I remember it as being late at night and we were
sitting on Holly's bed playing this game, when one of the girls asked if her
house was haunted. Holly said that it was, and that it was her maternal
grandmother that haunted the house. She then went on to tell us certain things
that would happen, and most situations would take place right next to the
father's recliner chair. About 15 minutes after we finished playing the game, I
had to use her bathroom. Though I was so totally afraid to go alone, I didn't
want to seem chicken, so I went on my own to the bathroom. Just as I was
passing by the recliner, I noticed I suddenly got cold. It was a warm summer
night when this happened. Ok, I chalked it up to being my imagination, seeing
as we'd just been talking about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then, years later, I had this
woman I was working for and we got along really good. So, one day she had
invited me to her house. Well, as we were at her house, we were talking about
ghost stories and the like. She excitedly pulled out her digital camera and led
me upstairs to their master bedroom. We stood, just outside of the bedroom
doorway, and she told me to take the camera and just scan around the room,
starting in one corner and going to the next. "Just see if you see
anything she said". I took the camera, still not knowing if I was truly a
believer and scanned the room. Sunddenly, I moved back to the corner I had just
scanned over. She said, "You see something don't you". I did! I saw a
green-ish male figure standing in the corner looking out the window! I was scared
to death, but even when I scanned the corner again, the figure was there. We
returned to the first floor of the house, when started to tell me all about it.
They had bought the house just about a year prior. The first week they lived in
the house, their children (very young children) would awake in the middle of
the night screaming and crying. Finally one night, my bosses husband got so
furious, he yelled, "I don't care that you're here, I don't care if you
stay, just leave my children ALONE!" The children never woke up crying
again. Then about a week later was when my boss had noticed the image through
her camera. She'd been going through various parts of the house taking photos
to send to relatives that lived out of state. When she was scanning the master
bedroom looking for a good view of the room, and found the exact image I found.
She yelled for her husband who saw the same thing. But it can only be seen
through the screen on her digital camera. After I saw it, I was a believer!
There was no way I would have seen it if it weren't there. A couple days after
she first saw the image herself, she was cleaning in the basement when she
found a hidden room. She went into the hidden room and found a box with a bunch
of papers. They start investigating the roots of the house. She found out that
the old Police Chief of </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Rensselaer</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, the town
she lived in had built the house a very long time ago. The only thing she can
figure is that the green-ish male figure is the Police Chief looking out the
window and watching over his town. They still live in that same house, and they
still live with their Cheif, all of them living peacefullly together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have seen many paranormal things
during my life. Now I want to share these experiences with you guys here in
Shadowlands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">So here is my first quite shocking
meeting with the ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was seven years old then. I was
in my grandparents house with my mother. The house is about 80 years old. I was
in downstairs when the phone ringed in upstairs. My mother went to the upstairs
to answer the phone and I followed her. After I had climbed about halfway up in
the old staircase I felt that somebody or something was behind me. I quickly
turned my head and saw a middle aged lady climbing the stairs behind me. She
was wearing the bathrobe and her hair looked wet. I totally freaked out and
runned upstairs as quickly as I was able to. She surely was a ghost because she
wasn't a family member nor a friend. I had never seen her before and my mother
didn't even noticed her. And that wasn't the only ghost experience I had in
that house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was about ten years old when the
second meeting happened. And it happened in the same old staircase in my
grandparents house. It was late night and i was going to the upstairs to get
some sleep. But my route was blocked. At the end of the corridor where you turn
right to get to the staircase was standing a man. He was wearing a gasmask so I
wasn't able to see his face. He didn't spoke nor moved at all. He just standed
still and I was too afraid to go past him. So I get my grandmother and went
back to the corridor with her. The gasmasked man was still there but my
grandmother didn't saw him. We went past him to the staircase and I was too
afraid to sleep so my grandmother stayed the night with me. In the morning the
man wasn't in the corridor anymore. I'm pretty sure that my grandparents house
is haunted and my friend has witnessed that too as the next experience tells.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was eleven years old and my friend
was twelve when this happened. We were playing in the basement of my
grandparents house. That basement is a really scary place. We were in the big
room just under the staircase that leads to the middle floor. We were having
fun until both of us feeled a strange feeling that we were not alone in the
basement. We feeled that there were other beings also. That was impossible
because both of my grandparents were upstairs. The feeling also told us to
leave the basement. Suddenly that feeling growed up really fast. It feeled that
we were surrounded by invisible persons and that we really should leave the
basement immediately. In panic we runned back up fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In these days it is still
frightening for me to walk that staircase or in the basement. I often feel the
same feeling in these places as I feeled ten years ago. And my friend has
feeled it also. But I haven't met any ghosts anymore. One thing is still sure:
There is lot of paranormal activity going on in that house and I'm the person
to who the spirits of that house want to reveal themselves<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I've been doing some research
about black spirits/ghosts. I had an experience in January of 2000 when I lived
in an old house in Portland, Maine. It was late in the evening about 10:00pm or
so when I felt something pearing at me from a closet in my basement apartment.
I thought nothing of it but when I looked again a materialistic, 3-dimensinal
human shaped figure with no facial features darted from the closet and stood
behind me. It was suspended above the floor about a foot or so. Before I knew
it 2 more had come out of nowhere. It happened so fast and they moved so
quickly that I didn't know what to make of this incident. I was a skeptic at
the time and had been all my life on ghosts, supernatural, etc. I was 36 years
old at the time. I was thrown and thrashed about my apartment with atrifacts,
furniture and audio/visual equipment being knocked off the cabinets and falling
on the floor. I was physically being beat up. Instinct told me to grab the
phone and call 911. After I had dialed 911 without speaking, the cordless phone
was knocked out of my hand. The last I knew I was laying on the floor swing a
knife in hope to scare them away but it didn't. The knife went right through
them. I had a mild heart attack and slipped into a coma state or death. I was
suspended in dark space with nothing around me and wouldn't regain
consciousness. I felt nothing a saw nothing but darkness as I was traveling
through a dark vacuum. I had no more recollection after that. Luckily the 911
call was traced back to my physical address and the fire department, police and
medcu arrived having to kick two doors in to reach me. I heard voices but was
incoherrent. A difribulator was used and then I remember being carried away in
a stretcher by paramedics. I went to the hospital after they revived me and
spent 3 days in ICU and 4 days in a hospital room hooked-up to an iv to help
flush out the torn muscle tissue from my heart. I spent 7 days at Maine Medical
Center in Portland and at the end od my stay I was seen by 2 psychiatrists whom
I told what happened. They said that I was 'OK' and shortly I was discharged. I
moved out the following day. Since then my skeptism has gone and I now do
believe even though I had no more occurrences of that nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thanks for reading my experience and I wouldn't wish this to happen to
my worst enemy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">By: Shylock1041@cs.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">THIS WAS A DEER HUNTING TRIP THAT
MY FATHER WENT ON BY HIMSELF MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS SMALL BUT I CAN
REMEMBER, VERY VIVIDLY, HIS TELLING OF THE EXPERIENCE.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">HE ALWAYS LIKED TO START HIS TRIPS
ALONE VERY EARLY SO THAT HE COULD BE WHERE HE WANTED TO BE WHEN DAWN BROKE AND
THIS TRIP WAS NO EXCEPTION. HE WAS GOING TO A PLACE CALLED SHINGLE MOUNTAIN
THAT, AS IS USUAL FOR MOST PLACES IN WESTERN WASHINGTON STATE, IS EXCEEDINGLY
THICK AND BRUSHY. HE ARRIVED AND PARKED THE JEEP WELL BEFORE DAYLIGHT AND
STARTED THE LONG CLIMB TO THE SADDLE THAT HE WANTED TO GET TO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">WASHINGTON IN THE FALL OF THE YEAR
HAS A LOT OF FOGGY CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF THE RAINY WEATHER AND THIS MORNING
THERE WAS A GROUND FOG THAT STARTED ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FT. ABOVE THE GROUND BUT
HE COULD SEE THE TRAIL FAINTLY EVEN THOUGH HE CARRIED NO FLASHLIGHT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">HE WAS CLIMBING ALONG IN THE DARK
WHEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, SOMETHING IN FRONT OF HIM SCREAMED AT HIM! HE FROZE, AND
THEN STARTED TO PUT SHELLS IN HIS GUN AS FAST AS HE COULD. HE PEERED THROUGH
THE DARKNESS AS HARD AS HE COULD TRYING TO SEE WHAT HAD SCREAMED BUT COULD SEE
NOTHING WHEN IT SUDDENLY SCREAMED AGAIN, THIS TIME A LITTLE FARTHER TO THE
RIGHT. IT THEN CONTINUED TO CIRCLE HIM AND SCREAM AT INTERVALS. DAD SAID THAT
HE WOULD TRY TO ESTIMATE WHERE IT WAS BETWEEN SCREAMS SO HE WOULD HAVE A LITTLE
MORE TIME TO SHOOT BUT HE NEVER SAW IT. THE FOG, BY NOW, HAD STARTED TO RAISE A
BIT AND THE SKY WAS GETTING A LITTLE LIGHTER SO HE COULD SEE A LITTLE MORE. HE
THEN SPIED A LARGE STUMP OFF TO HIS LEFT AND HE DECIDED TO MOVE OVER TO IT AND
CLIMB TO THE TOP, THEREFORE GIVING HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE TIME TO SEE WHAT IT
WAS. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP AND STOOD
THERE WITH HIS GUN READY TO FIRE WHILE THE THING, WHATEVER IT WAS, CONTINUED TO
CIRCLE THE STUMP AND SCREAM INTERMITTENTLY. WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON, DAD SAID
THAT HE SAW ANOTHER SET OF HEADLIGHTS DOWN ON THE ROAD WHERE HE PARKED BUT HE
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO WORRY TO MUCH ABOUT THEM. IT WAS NOT QUITE LIGHT YET AND HE
WAS STILL ON HIGH ALERT WHEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE HEARD SOMETHING CLIMBING THE
STUMP BEHIND HIM. HE WHIRLED, IMMEDIATELY READY TO FIRE, AND STARED INTO THE
FACE OF ANOTHER HUNTER! THIS GUY WAS SCARED TO DEATH AND HAD SEEN DAD ON THE
STUMP AND WANTED THE COMPANY.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">DAD TOLD HIM" MAN, DO YOU
KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU CAME TO BEING SHOT"? " DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS
SCREAMING"? HE ASKED, OBVIOUSLY TO SCARED TO WORRY ABOUT BEING SHOT RIGHT
THEN.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">DAD TOLD HIM THEN THAT HE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT WAS CIRCLING THEM BUT THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL TO STAND BACK TO
BACK ON THE STUMP UNTIL DAYLIGHT SO THEY COULDN'T BE SURPRISED SO THAT IS WHAT
THEY DID.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">WHEN DAYLIGHT CAME, WHATEVER IT
WAS WENT AWAY WITHOUT THEM EVER SEEING IT AND IT NEVER ATTACKED THEM OR CAME
VERY CLOSE, SEEMING TO BE CONTENT TO CIRCLE AND LOOK.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One night me &amp; two guy friends
were driving into Howard City, Mi and we didn't really notice that one of the
guys was talking. My friends boyfriend and I were unable to say a word. We were
driving down the road on which each side has corn fields and we saw two girls,
one standing at the opposite side of the road and another walking directly into
your path. The girl walking into your path was wearing a gray sweatshirt blue
jeans had Blonde hair and white eyes. The girl that was standing on the other
side of the road was wearing a red sweatshirt had brown hair and wore blue
jeans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were<span style="">&nbsp; </span>driving tward them I tried as hard as I could
to tell my friends boyfriend to look out for her. But I couldn't, I couldn't
say a word I tried and nothing but air came out. After we got to the stop sign
I said to my friends boyfriend "did you see<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that?" He said yes and the other guy
that was in the truck with us asked me what so I told him and he said "We
have to go back!!" So we turned around and went back down the road and
found no sign of her<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I must preface with the fact that
I am deeply religious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So those of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">you who are not, don't be offended
by the ties I make to good and evil<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and my experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I am 28 years old, and am not one
of those people who can "sense" the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">other side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I simply don't have that capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So naturally, the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">number experiences I've had can be
counted on one hand without using<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">all your fingers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I've read stories on this site of
people who have experienced what I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">have or very close to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who have attributed what they<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">experience to "sleep
paralysis" and petit mal siezures will fall into<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my line of thinking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm a rational person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will the first to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">reach for a practical or
scientific explanation of something I don't<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, however, was not one of those
moments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll tell<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">you why afterwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was 20 years old at the time and
serving a full time mission in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">South Dakota for my church at my
expense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part of the duties when one<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">does this, is to try and keep
close to God and his teachings through<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">prayer and earnest study of the
scriptures, so as to recieve<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">inspiration about where to go and
who to visit, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's very much a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">situation where you have to trust
yourself and your instincts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Anyway, in this setting, I was
arranging to go to sleep for the night<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">around 9 pm and ready myself for
the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">roommate/mission companion that I
was always with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mission rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">shared a room, him on one side, I
on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd just shut off<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the lights and were settling in to
a night's sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was gripped by<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the "paralysis" I've
heard so many talk about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the moment
I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">gripped by it, I was WIDE
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Looking at my roommate on the
other<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">side of the room sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now when I say paralysis, I should<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was gripped with a sudden, powerful force
that immediately<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">startled me to a very concious
state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It WAS hard to breath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to force breaths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt a lot of weight on my chest, the room
had<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">darkened beyond normal parameters,
and I was gripped in the same<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">instant at the paralysis by an
intense fear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Now normally this would be enough
to burn it forever in the memory of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">most sane people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But upon being in this state for a few
minutes, I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">distinctly heard a voice speak to
me with malice and hate beyond<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">anything I've ever felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It said simply this: "This is a terrible<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">feeling, isn't it."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Spoken with a touch of mockery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a witness<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">at that moment, that the powers of
hell DO combine against those who<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">seek to carry out God's work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And by the same token, God is the only<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">one who can release us from such
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not speak to rebuke<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the spirit, so I simply prayed
with all the fervor I could muster that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">God would support me and come to
my aid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also commanded the spirit<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">in the name of Jesus Christ to
depart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which worked on the third try,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">as I was slowly released from
whatever it was that held me and kept me<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">from speaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That horrible feeling was still hanging thick
in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">room as I jumped out of bed and
shook my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>companion awake, and we both<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">prayed that the evil spirit might
be banished from that place and that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">God would watch over us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think sometimes God lets us experience<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">such things to prove that the
adversary to good is real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there are<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">so many who would wish not to
believe there is a devil, or a God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I know that the spirits of those
who have passed on, both good and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">evil, exist all around us, just
vieled from our sight by our own<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">mortality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know they have great interest in what we
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">warn those who would be foolish
enough to invite spirits at no more<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">than a whim or a curiosity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spirits you can contact and invite<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">through chants, ouiji, spells and
"open minds", are not the kind you'd<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">want to keep in touch with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be easy for you to make contact or<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">even invite a spirit to dwell with
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You may not have any idea how<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">difficult it can be to make a
spirit leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you wish to know what<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">has happened to your relatives,
friends, etc. that have passed on,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">please pray to God for a
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has the power to answer you,
to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">have your relatives visit
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know I'm coming off preachy, but<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">don't take my word for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you're serious, God will answer you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">PLEASE don't mess around with
those spirits that would do ANYTHING to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">obtain a body, even if for a short
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is our great possesion<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that they do not have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are the legions of angels who chose to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">follow Lucifer (Satan) and were
cast out of Heaven in the beginning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">They didn't recieve bodies as
punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would do anything to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">have one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please, again, if you must know the workings
of the spirit<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">world, inquire from the one who made
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Thanks for listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi, I have been a reader since
1998.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I love your website. Here is my
story. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I live in Brandon, Ms. Now, you
need to know a little about the history of where I live. In 1992, right before
Thanksgiving, there was a tornado that tore thru the neighborhood where I live
now. It killed a bunch of people. And, dismembered some of the lucky ones who
survived. And, I do believe that part of the Civil War was fought here. We are
about 45 minutes away from Vicksburg, MS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, on with my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right
after we moved here in the summer of 1998, my children and I would here strange
noises. My oldest son, at the time, was 5. He kept telling me that he saw a man
in the bathroom. My smoke alarm would go off in the middle of the night, and
their would be no reason for it to do so. It really started making me mad. This
went on for a few years. Then one night, it would go off, and I would rip the
batteries out, just to get some sleep. But sleep wasn't coming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would still go off. Right before I would
fall asleep again, it would go off. I finally yelled at it. I told IT, "I
am a single mom, trying to get some rest so I could get up and the morning, and
try to make a decent living for these kids. I can't do that if this damn thing
won't quit going off. SO, KNOCK IT OFF!!"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After that, the only time it<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>would go off, would be when it is supposed to. The lamp in the living
room would flicker every now and again. I would still here little unexplained
noises. My kids are now 13 and 11. And they still see a man or a shadow around,
but thank God, aren't afraid of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
try not to discourage my kids from telling me stuff like that. I am a true
believer in ghost. I also sent some pictures that I took with my new digital,
and saw some orbs. I sent those too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have some other experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was at a
friend's house, and she just gave birth to twins. Her husband was a truck
driver and was away. So, I agreed to go stay with her to keep her company and
to help out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a year earlier, her
great-grandmother had passed away in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friend and her husband moved in after she died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, the night I agreed to stay over, we
were getting ready for bed. We had the twins asleep and tucked in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend was in the bathroom and I in the
bed. I started to smell a flower scent, and I thought my friend had used some
perfume or some kind of lotion. When she came walking into the room, I asked
her if she used a lotion or something. She said, very calmly, 'nope, that is
the scent of my great-grandmother". I thought to myself, "okie
dokie!". Well, her bed was a king sized waterbed, that had the shelf
behind the bed. It had a lamp that you touched to turn it on and off, at each
end of the shelf. Brand new lamps that you had to touch, went off, without
anyone touching them. I reached up and touched it to turn it back on. I looked
at my friend, she just laughed. She was still standing by the foot of the bed.
I asked what just happened? She said, "it was probably my grandmother. She
doesn't know you."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I laid back
down, and touched the lamp to turn it off. A few seconds later, it turned back
on. I turned it back off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cut back
on. I finally said, Ok, I am Amy, Hope's friend, I am here<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to help her with the babies. I am not here to
harm anyone. Please leave the light off and let me go to bed." We sat
there for a minute, and the light turned off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friend crawled into the bed and we went to sleep. Every now and
again, something would happen, like lights flickering, or loud sounds coming
from the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, nothing scary. I
was surprised that I wasn't scared, even to be in her house alone. Well, thanks
for reading my story. If you want to know more, please feel free to email me at
alwradcliff33@aol.com. Thanks!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My name is Tavi, I live in
Romania, Europe. My story begins with a bit of history. The strigoii are the
romanian name for vampires, they are told that on the night of 23 November they
fight for a new leader.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Just in that night i was at my
grandparent`s for a small vacation. All was going well `till the stroke of
midnight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I went to bed with my cousin being
a bit tired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As the bed was next to the window
and being a full moon you could see pretty good outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was the last one to fall asleep
because i was just couldn`t get used to the bed when i heard what was the most
scary scream ever. I looked out the window but saw nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">about 10 minutes later i saw a
shadow that looked as a sort of huntch. Looking outside of the windo i could
see a dark hairy huntch right outside of my window moving back and forth. I
tried to wake up my cousin who`s about 4 years bigger than me to see what it is
but i couldn`t speak or move. I just started crying and the only thing i could
do is lay back on to the pillow and fell asleep because of the fear. The next
day i told what i saw to my cousin and to my grandparents but they saw that i
was seeing things. I don`t know what that was but i can tell you it wasn`t an
animal as the gate was closed. Since this day i can`t forget that incident and
evan now beeing 19 years old i sleep with my cousin. This was my story thanks
for reading it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi -- I've been reading all the
stories, trying to find something similar to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">what I experienced when I was
about 9-10 years old. I'm not sure what it was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that I saw, but I haven't been
able to explain it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Let me start by saying that when I
was a kid, I slept with an old baby<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">blanket that I'd had forever --
one night I went to sleep with the small<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">blanket spread out over the
comforter as usual. I remember waking up in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">middle of the night when everyone
else was asleep. My bedroom door was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">closed and the foot of my bed was
about 3 or 4 feet away from the door. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">laid awake, staring at the door
when two flat spots of light started<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">swirling on the door -- it sort of
looked like when the cable goes out on<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the tv -- that snowy effect.
Anyway, it sort of looked like that, but not as<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bright as an actual tv, and the
light was just spinning, swirling around in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a circle. I thought at first that
I was seeing things, and tried to tell<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">myself that it was car lights or
something, but it didn't look like that,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and there was no sound of passing
cars outside, everything was quiet<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">outside. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Suddenly, the two flat swirling
circles seemed to pop off the door and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">became two little men/creatures
standing near the end of the bed -- I don't<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">remember too well what they looked
like anymore, but I remember them being<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">about 2 feet tall, no necks, fat
little bodies, they seemed to have faces,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">but I couldn't tell you what they
looked like -- just sort of a suggestion<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of facial features -- and they
were made of this weird light. I sat up in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bed, frightened out of my mind and
clutched the blankets up to my chin. They<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">walked towards the bed, and
started climbing up the bed by holding onto the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">blankets -- I could feel them
tugging the blankets. When they got to the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">top, they began pulling on my
favorite blanket -- at first I tried to pull<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">it back away from them, but they
kept pulling and I seemed to go weak and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">just let it go. They climbed down
the end of the bed and back up onto the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">door, this time with my blanket
that they spread out behind them flat on the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">door -- it made me think of them
having a picnic on it. All the while I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">remember they made small sounds
like they were talking to each other, but<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">very faintly, I couldn't make out
any words. They became flat swirling<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">circles of light again and then
seemed to vanish through the door. I pulled<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the comforter over my head and
cowered there, shaking until I guess I just<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">eventually went back to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The next morning, I had breakfast
and was going to head out the door, when I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">suddenly remembered what happened,
and thought wow, what a weird dream. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">went upstairs to look for my blanket.
I looked everywhere in my room but<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">couldn't find it -- I even checked
between the sheets and under the mattress<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">but it wasn't there. I asked my
brothers if they'd taken it (as a joke) and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">they looked at me like I was crazy
and said why the hell would they take my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stupid blanket? I asked my mom if
she took it to wash or something. She said<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">no. I checked all over the house
and couldn't find it anywhere. The last<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">place I looked was the basement
(which I had always found creepy, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">whenever mom asked me to get her
anything down there, I beat it up the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stairs as quick as I could). I
found the blanket, hanging in the middle of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the ceiling of the basement -- it
was not hanging there with any kind of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">fastener, one edge was just stuck
flat on the side of one of the beams (the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">floor joists from the room above),
with the rest of it dangling down. It<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">looked like they'd put it there in
plain sight to be sure I'd see it. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">grabbed one corner, pulled it down
and ran up the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">That was the only time I've personally
experienced anything strange like<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that. I've heard many stories of
unexplainable things from different people<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that I know. I remember once my
roommate and her boyfriend were in our<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">basement apartment and both of
them heard what sounded like someone in heavy<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">boots come down the stairs, and
knock on the door sharply 3 times. They<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">thought it was the landlord -- he
lived upstairs and had the only other key<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to the outside door at the top of
the stairs, which was locked. They said<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">'just a minute' but got no answer,
and when they opened the apartment door,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">no one was there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When we first saw the house, I
loved it, but I was pregnant for our third child, and there was only two large
bedrooms and one small bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
an old farmhouse, and it was built in a "T" shape, much like most of
the houses built in the l800s ,because of the central fireplaces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we told the owner we needed something
with more rooms, she said we probably wouldn't want it anyway,because it was
haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went onto tell us , her
husband was away on a business trip and she was alone in the house except for
her little dog.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They were asleep one night
when the dog started to bark.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
opened her eyes and at the foot of her bed was a woman standing looking at
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she raised up, the woman
turned, and went out the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
incident frightened her so badly, she swore she would not stay in the house
alone again .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She eventually sold the
house and the new owners built a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>large
addition onto the back of the house,and did many<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"socalled improvements" on it.
After living there for several years, they went bankrupt .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house sat empty for several years. I
happened to drive by it one day and saw the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"for sale"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went to the bank and bought it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The neighbors told us it was haunted,
that<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>they saw people in the windows
,and heard things coming from the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had a little black lady that babysit for me fulltime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would not go upstairs alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she felt like someone was watching
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She never went in the basement even
if someone else was going. She heard people talking, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>saw two men in the parlor .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter had a rocking<span style="">&nbsp; </span>chair in her room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day she went in her room and it was
rocking all by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found out
later<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that a young woman had died during
childbirth in that same room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We guessed
she was rocking her baby. My grandson , at age 4 was sleeping in the small
bedroom and told us there was a lady in a long dress in his room during the
night. No one gets too upset from these sightings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We figure that they were here before we were,
and they feel comfortable with us too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They have apparently accepted us as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have a comment about the Guthrie
Center, Iowa, "Devil's Chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
one of my friends read your sight, I was talking on the phone with him and he
told me about the chair and what happened to that one man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Im not a big believe in ghosts, persay, but i
do believe in supernatural and spirits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So when i first heard it i laughed and told him that we were going over
there the next night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we ended up
heading over there, him, my friend, and i at about 8:45p, in the winter so it
was pitch dark already.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was told
where it was (turn left on the second dirt road and its on the right towards
the top of the hill) so we went over there and i saw it, momentarily i started
getting chills, not just because of the story but because of what it looked
like, [(all in cement-)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>its in the shape
of logs with a drape or something over the top of it(looked like jesus' robe
draped over the broken down cross), along the bottom it appears to be the shape
of ferns although at first it looked like aligator tails and an old
cusion-looking seat]... The second we got out of the car the wind 'seemed' to
have picked up becuase my hair was whiping around, just being around it was
creepy. but soon enough none of us would sit in it so we got back in my car,
and drove around to the fr t, to study it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After we sat there for a while we soon found out we were all to scared
to go sit in it so we headed back to Panora (7 miles east of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guthrie).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>*SCARY PART* That night my friend stayed at my house. *Above my bed is a
window and on either side are 2 - 1ft x 1ft mirrors and MANY sharp pieces of
broken mirrow inbetween (art) stuck on by mirror stickers(very stong ones!!- i
tryed to pull them off and they just rip through the middle(if they even come
off at all)) anways they have been on their for a few weeks.--We finally went
to bed around 12p and she fought(and won) the inside of the bed(near the window
and mirrors) we finally fell asleep about 12:30p and at sometime in the night
the top mirror (approx. 5-6 feet from my bed, fell down, hit the inside corner
of the bottom mirror(right above my friends head), but ended up, to the right
of the bed--weird huh? --anyways the alarm went off at about 6:45a and she woke
up and started getting ready, i fell back asleep and then wore up at like
7:30a, as i was laying there i heard a weird sound and looked up at my wall, to
find the top mirror off the wall (the stickers unlatched themselves, they didnt
rip) and all of these pieces of broken mirror were laying on my friends
pillow!!-- ironic, i think not!, those sickers were like promised to stay on
the wall!! luckily we didnt sit in the chair!!<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Just recently discovered your site
and I have to say I love it..WELL DONE its great! Love reading all the ghost stories
(even thought half of them scare the living daylights out of me!), so here are
some of my own....<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">KNOCK, KNOCK...NO-ONE THERE...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Well, my first experience of
ghosts was when I was about 12 years old and I had gone on a school trip to
Swanage in Dorset (Im from England). The B &amp; B we stayed in was a beautiful
old house with a giant sweeping staircase, high ceilings and so on. After we
had stayed there a few days, the whole class complained of someone knocking on
their doors. It was a really quick 'knock knock'. It happened to our room a few
times, and once we actually waited behind the door for this 'knock knock' to
occur, when it happened we instantly opened the door and to our surprise there
was no one there. There was no way you could hide anywhere either! Our room was
the first room as you stepped in from the front porch (of which the doors were
transparent)so there was no way anyone could get outside and hide quick enough.
Also our bedroom door opened out onto a huge empty reception area, there were
doors all around the edges with nothing in the middle of the room...there was
literally no where for anyone to hide that quickly! Thinking nothing of it, the
teachers took us out one evening to the beach to wear us out. When we got back
to the B &amp; B however, some of the girls returned to their room to find that
all their lights were on, with the covers thrown back from their beds and their
door wide open. Nothing wrong there you think..BUT...everytime we went out our
teachers made sure that all our rooms were spotless, beds made, clothes away,
all lights were turned off and so on. All the doors were also on spring hinges
so everytime you opened them and let go they would automatically spring back
shut...this door had been found wide open!And the owners insisted that no one
had been around either....<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">THE PORTUGUESE GHOST...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My second experience of ghostly
goings on happened to me a few years later, when I was about 15 whilst on
holiday in the Algarve in Portugal, in the villa in which we were staying. The
villa was huge as there was about 10 of family and friends. It had three
floors, the bottom floor was bedrooms, the middle floor was the kitchen, living
room, dining room and so on and the top floor was again bedrooms. Me and my
friend at the time had a room on the bottom floor of the house which had patio
doors that opened out onto the swimming pool. Lying in bed at nite and on more
than one occasion, we could hear the water breaking as though someone was
swimming in the pool. Rushing to the window we would always discover nobody
there. We would also hear the back gate squeak open and shut at night and
again...nobody was there. The bedside lamp would also spontaneously switch
itself on, but being young and naive we would obediently turn it off and think
nothing of it. On our final night in the house, my mum claimed that she woke up
during the night to hear someone wandering around upstairs (she was on the
bottom floor also) opening and closing cupboards, thinking that it was one of
the ten people in the house she dozed off back to sleep. In the morning when my
Mum spoke to friends on the top floor, they claimed that they also heard
cupboards opening and shutting and also assumed it was one of us. Only then did
they realise that it wasnt actually any of us at all...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Note to ShadowLands: Not sure if
the next story classes as an experience but Im gonna tell it anyway...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My next experience was the most
amazing and will stay with me forever...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">OUR DEREK ACORAH EXPERIENCE...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It was about 2 years ago (I was 19
then) that me and my mum went to see a medium (Derek Acorah for those of you in
the UK...not sure if he is known in the US?!Think of him as a UK equivalent of
Jonothan Edwards)who was performing on stage in Swindon, Wiltshire (South West
of England by the way). I had insisted to my mum that we go to see him as we
had avidly watched him on Living Tvs Most Haunted. So, my mum came not
expecting much whereas I secretly hoped that something would happen, as I think
everyone does who attends those kinds of things, and I was not to be
disappointed! Derek came on stage and introduced himself, and then he started
to contact spirits on the other side, and lo and behold, it was my mums great
grandmother (Nanny Wowo) who was first in the queue to talk! I wont bore you
and go into great detail with what Derek told us, but everything he mentioned
was so accurate it was just amazing. This man who I had only watched on TV was
now standing a few feet away from me and my mum in person, telling us personal
things that had gone on within the four walls of our home that only we knew. He
knew that my grandad, (Nanny Wowos son)was a bit down at that time and that he
was on medication, he knew that my dad had injured his knee and many other
things. He also predicted that my mum would get a promotion by Friday (we went
to see him on a Wednesday) and she did! Derek also made reference to a
conversation that my mum had had with my dad on the way up to see him just a
mere hour before (how weird is that?!). Just knowing that my mums great grandmother
(although I never knew her) is around and watching over our lives is a
comforting thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My granma lives on a farm near </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Chattanooga</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> and one
of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my great-granmas lived with her
(until she died). <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I used to spend my entire summers
up on the farm and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">great-granma and I would hang out
and have the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">greatest of times! One Wed
afternoon July when I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">11 great-granma looked out the
window and jumped out<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of her rocker as spryly as she
could at the age of 90<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and "ran" to the back
porch. There she yelled and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">yelled at my granma's husband to
get out of the way!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The Indians were racing across the
field and were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">going to run over him. He couldn't
hear because of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">tractor noise but he saw her
frantically waving her<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">arms and thought something
horrible had happened. He<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">jumped off the tractor and ran to
the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">As he came up on the porch she was
obviously upset<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">about the "Indians in the
field. See them out there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">They were going to run you right
over with their<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">horses! And what are they doing
here? This is our<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">farm!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Well, we thought great-granma had
had a stroke or<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">delusional break. But my granma
did a little<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">research... As it turns out the
farm is the exact<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Until
now I really never put any stock in the stories I've heard as a child. I moved
into a historical landmark.People mentioned things about the room I had moved
into. At first nothing.But on the third night,in the middle of the night I
heard a note, like from an old-fashioned pump organ(always just ome lond note.For
three nights I awoke to this.finally after that I mentioed it to someone,they
looked at me like I was cracked. then I mentioned that it souned like an old
fashioned organ.Someone ask if I knew ther was an organ in the parlor(which I
hadden;t.She played a note on it and it was the same sound. some still think
I'm nuts.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since then
I've been told that I will be sleeping in there for time being.I lite a blsck
candle, and a sage smudge.It still smells the same,and I feel pressure on me when
I'm in that roon.ai need to study to see if I can cange it, I'm a catholic and
do not believe in that,but I can'tmake it better. Hopefully I can meditate in
ther and become friendly with it. I do know the last person who died here.So
maybe it won't be too hard to work togather.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Other things have started too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hello - This is a true
story and my family members can<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">attest to all of it.
Background: Until I was 14 we<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">lived in a house my
grandparents bought in 1949 (newly<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">built). In the '60s my
great-grandmother came to live<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">them. My grandparents moved
to TN (another story<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there) in '72 and my
parents stayed in the house and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">eventually purchased it
from by grandparents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The following occurred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The front door was very
heavy and had a latch-lock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">While we lived there my dad
was a cop and would<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">occasionally come home
during supper when he worked<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the evening shift. At least
twice a week we would hear<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the front door open during
supper and my sisters and I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">would run to the door
expecting to see Dad! Rarely was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">he there, the door was
always closed, and my mom<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">always heard it as well. We
could only chalk it up to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the ghost. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There is a room in the
house that has a door on either<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">end. One night my dad got
up to get another beer and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">got half way thru the room
when the door leading to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the kitchen SLAMMED shut.
We all heard it. My father<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">went to bed having suddenly
become a believer (as a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Marine and a cop he DID not
believe in ghosts before<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">this incident). You see,
there were no drafts in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">house that could account
for a slammed door and my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">great-grandma was very set
against too much drinking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Also, I was a very restless
sleeper, pulling sheets<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">out from the mattress every
night. One night while I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was in a semi-sleep someone
came in and tucked the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sheets under the mattress
and it really ticked me off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I liked being able to toss
and turn! Being 13 I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">accused my parents doing
this and was very irritated<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that they would come into
my room in the middle of the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">night! They unequviocally
denied doing such and my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sisters were practically
still in the crib. I knew it<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was my great-grandma, who
always tucked the kids in at<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">night while she was living.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In addition we all felt a
presence in the living room,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">which is the room in which
my great-grandmother, as<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">well as a friend of the
family, passed away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I'm positively sure the
spirit of my great-grandma was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">in that house watching over
us, obviously in a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">benevolent way. After we
moved we all tried to get a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sense for her but she was
gone. She had done her duty,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I suppose and maybe it was
finally time for her to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">move on. Not all ghosts are
bad!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It was summer vacation and
I was with my two children, ages 3 years and 8 years at the time, when I got
the phone call. It was my husband calling me from work saying he forgot his
lunch, and if I and the children could take a ride to his work to give him
lunch money. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We didn't have any plans,
so of course I said we would be on our way. My husband works about 20-25
minutes from our house. I buckled up the children and myself in our Grand Am.
(Buckling up for safety had just become a mandatory law in our state.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I must have gotten a little
over a mile, when I noticed the car seemed to be veering off to the right. I
thought maybe my front tire needed a little more air or something, but I would
have my husband look at it when we got there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">You need to understand that
the road to his work is very winding and borders the local reservoir. My
youngest child was trying to tell me something and I turned back for one split
second. The car veered a liitle too much to the right and hit a tree trunk that
was sticking out. Right next to the tree was the beginning of an old stone
wall. We hit the tree, then the wall (which was like the beginning of a
ramp.).The car went up on two wheels for about 3 seconds, and then promptly
rolled onto the roof. We slid 40 feet on the roof before coming to a stop about
100 feet from the edge of the water, in the middle of the street. I quickly
unbuckled and jumped in the back seat to unbuckle my chidren to get them out. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My daughters and I were
sitting on the side of the road, I think in a little shock. There was no one in
sight coming from either side of the road, and of course I forgot my cell phone
that day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Out of nowhere an older
woman, with the blue eyes and blond hair, was by our side. I never saw her walk
up, but she went straight to my children and hugged them affectionately. She
said that she had called 911 from her car and that they were on the way. She
was still consoling the chidren when another woman drove over from the other
direction. She had a cell phone in her hand and wanted to know if I needed to
call someone. I was on her phone for less than a minute and when I turned back
to thank the first woman for consoling my children...she was gone!!! I asked my
oldest daughter if she saw her walk back to her car. She said "NO"
and that she only turned her head away from the woman for a second. I looked
down the road to try to see anything...but in my heart I already knew that this
was no regular woman...she was an ANGEL. OUR SPECIAL ANGEL. I asked the people
that were gathering at the scene if they saw where the woman had gone...and no
one but my children and I saw her!!!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I firmly believe in God and
how He sends His Angels when and where they are truley needed! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

(as i call it) i no for a fact that no one was in the chaple we<span style="">&nbsp; </span>slept in my parents room that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>another time was when my little sis woke up to
see a man standing in the coner of her room but when she sat up he vanished
into thin-air.my aunt who lived in the bone home when she was growing up said
that the man was our great-great-grandfather who died in the house when she was
living here. she said that he started showing up two months after he had died
and not to worry he was just watching over her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my brother whos bedroom is
in the basement also has heard the someone screaming in the chaple. he also
hears people walking in our basement in the middle of the night when no one
himself is in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">i have two closets in my
room both i shut every night and when im just starting to drift off
"BOB" as i call him throws them open and then slames them shut. hes
even done it with me talking on the phone to a friend. ive become so acustom to
it that if he dosent open amd shut then i start to miss him i guess its his
little way of telling me hes watching over me and its his home too.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the house that my aunt and
uncle lived in for years was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>but their ghost was friendly<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he
would sit on the edge of a bed and watch over you or just walk around the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the only time i feared him was when they were
moving out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a key to the house and
took my children there to change a diaper when we were in the neighborhood
right towards the end of the moving process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ghost was loud and scary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Making nosies and appearing to us while we were there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not want the family to move out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We grew up with this ghost and kind of miss
him now that they no longer live there<o:p></o:p></span></p>
