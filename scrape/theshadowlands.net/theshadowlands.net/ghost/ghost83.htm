<P><B>The Ghostly Old Lady</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 10 years old, I went to day camp.  And every month
we</B>
<P><B>would go camping. Well one time we went there was a little island in
the</B>
<P><B>middle of a river, and there was a bridge to get on it.</B>
<P><B>Well, me and 5 other kids decided to go on the island.  So we started
to</B>
<P><B>go across and I was in front with no flashlight.  And when we got
there</B>
<P><B>i saw a little burned down house.  And I was the only one to go there</B>
<P><B>besides a 9 years old kid.  When we got to the house everything in
sight</B>
<P><B>was burnt.  Then I saw a pair of old shoes.  I got closer, then I
heard</B>
<P><B>a rocking chair going back and forth. When I turned around I saw a
old</B>
<P><B>lady staring at me. I kind of stood there for a second then I started
to</B>
<P><B>walk away.  Then the old lady got up and followed me and my friend.
 We</B>
<P><B>started to run away.  When we got to the bridge we told everyone to
run</B>
<P><B>and they did, like little chickens that they were.  I turned around
and</B>
<P><B>the old lady was gone.  When we got to camp my friends asked what we
did</B>
<P><B>and we told them what we saw.  They didn't believe us until it
started</B>
<P><B>to smell like smoke.  Like a house was burning down.  All I saw that</B>
<P><B>night in my dreams was a house burning down and I heard a old lady</B>
<P><B>screaming.  My friend that was with me died of cancer three years
after</B>
<P><B>that happened.  I will never forget that camp out.</B>

<P><B>The Flicker-</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hello. I am 14 y.o., well balanced girl. I was sitting here at home,</B>
<P><B>talking to my mom, who was upstairs. As I got up to go take my
clothes</B>
<P><B>out of the washer, the lights started to flicker. It wasn't storming,
or</B>
<P><B>any signs of storming. I then opened up the fuse box, and flipped the</B>
<P><B>downstairs lights off...to my surprise, that one flickering light
stayed</B>
<P><B>on..I cursed and QUICKLY rain upstairs, w/my mom. About an hour later,
I</B>
<P><B>came back down, and flipped the switch back on...the flickering light</B>
<P><B>went off, and the light switch was flipped to the on
position....still.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nightwalk-</B>
<P>
<P><B>Sometimes before I get ready to go to bed, I'll go downstairs to get
a</B>
<P><B>snack. This particular time I was walking down, I thought I heard</B>
<P><B>something. I payed it no attention. (My mom works nights, so no one
was</B>
<P><B>here) As I was making my way back up the stairs, I felt an evil
presence</B>
<P><B>come over me, and I almost fell down the stairs. The stairs are made
of</B>
<P><B>hard, thick wood. There are about 17 stairs, and to meet the end is
a</B>
<P><B>hard, concrete floor. There's no doubt in my mind, if I wouldn't have</B>
<P><B>been holding onto the railing, I wouldn't be here today.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My Grandfather's Death Pulled our family together-</B>
<P><B>My grandfather died about 3 years ago, and I took it the hardest out
of</B>
<P><B>everyone. As I was almost asleep in my bedroom, I felt a golden
presence</B>
<P><B>over me, telling me everything is going to be o.k..it was telling me
to</B>
<P><B>be strong, b/c everyone needed me to be at that time. I told my mom
of</B>
<P><B>this, and she didn't believe me. I told my cousin, and she witnessed</B>
<P><B>that she hears his footsteps and feels his presence over her. His
death</B>
<P><B>pulled our family closer, but it's bad that it had to be that way.
I</B>
<P><B>live in a dangerous neighborhood, and I feel that he's ALWAYS
watching</B>
<P><B>over me...I feel it now..</B>

<P><B>The Ghost Who Liked Me</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: MustyMummy@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>One evening my boyfriend and I decided to take a stroll at a historical
site </B>
<P><B>near my apartment. It was about 10:15, really windy, and chilly out.
Usually </B>
<P><B>many people are out at the island, but that night was very quiet and
hardly </B>
<P><B>any people walking around.</B>
<P>
<P><B> We walked around for a bit and walked with our arms crossed, bearing
with </B>
<P><B>the cold wind gusting at us, since we were near the ocean. As we walked
near </B>
<P><B>the old fort on the island, which dates back to the Revolutionary period,
the </B>
<P><B>wind came on even stronger. I had my long hair out and it began to
fly above </B>
<P><B>my head. I laughed thinking I looked like a witch . Suddenly, the cold
wind </B>
<P><B>became WARM , the wind stopped abruptly, and my hair stood up still
in the </B>
<P><B>air for  about 5 seconds!!!!!!! Then my hair began to slowly come down
to my </B>
<P><B>back, but soon I started to feel a tingling feeling on my scalp and
hair, as </B>
<P><B>if someone was playing with it!!!! I was giggling telling my boyfriend
it </B>
<P><B>felt like someone was playing with my hair and that it was tickling
me. I </B>
<P><B>thought nothing of that incident until we walked further...</B>
<P>
<P><B>As we walked closer to the exit of the island, I  now strongly felt
the </B>
<P><B>presence of the male spirit next to me. My heart raced and I felt scared
now. </B>
<P><B>It gave me the impression that he was a young, Revolutionary soldier
who was </B>
<P><B>curious about me and was trying to get my attention (I think he was
</B>
<P><B>fascinated by my hair). My boyfriend was at my side and I told him"
There is </B>
<P><B>a spirit next to me". He said he could feel it also, but chose to ignore
it. </B>
<P><B>I could even start to hear the pitter patter of feet brushing through
the </B>
<P><B>grass at my side, while were were walking on the concrete. It seemed
to be </B>
<P><B>almost jogging as to keep up with us and almost act sort of playful.
Finally </B>
<P><B>I had enough and told my boyfriend "Let's switch sides!". We did and
 about </B>
<P><B>10 seconds later it came back to my side again!!! I got so scared I
ran and </B>
<P><B>my boyfriend caught up with me and grabbed my hand. My boyfriend, who
I </B>
<P><B>believe is psychic, said he told the spirit, telepathically, to leave
and let </B>
<P><B>us be. Amazingly, the presence was gone, and I felt relief. Later on
in bed I </B>
<P><B>thought about the whole thing.I got this terrible feeling that it was
sad </B>
<P><B>that it scared me and that it really meant no harm to me. I think if
I had </B>
<P><B>just relaxed instead of being scared, I would have been able to learn
more </B>
<P><B>about him.  I think he liked me and that maybe I had the "key" to helping
him </B>
<P><B>perhaps?? I have been up there several times since, and have not felt
the </B>
<P><B>soldier's presence since........</B>
<P>
<P><B>State Park</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: crshoultz@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Here is my story.  I have always been skeptical of the supernatural.
 I have </B>
<P><B>always had a difficult time believing in things I could not see, or
</B>
<P><B>comprehend.</B>
<P>
<P><B>   Last week I went camping with some friends at a state park.  This
is an </B>
<P><B>historic state park because it is located where one of the earliest
</B>
<P><B>settlements in my home state was built.  The night we were camping
a severe </B>
<P><B>thunderstorm came through the area and chased almost all of the other
</B>
<P><B>campers away, so it was a very secluded area.  The friends that I was
</B>
<P><B>camping with all went to bed at about 2:30, but I always have a hard
time </B>
<P><B>sleeping so I decided to stay up for a while and see if I could get
the fire </B>
<P><B>going again that the storm had put out.  I messed around for about
45 </B>
<P><B>minutes trying to get the wet wood to start and failed miserably. 
Degected </B>
<P><B>I sat back in my lawn chair and thought, "what am I supposed to do
now, I'm </B>
<P><B>bored out of my mind and not the least bit tired."  I had been sitting
there </B>
<P><B>for about 5 minutes when I heard a commotion behind me, a </B>
<P><B>clip-clop-clip-clop, the sound a horse makes when it is walking.  I
thought </B>
<P><B>to myself, "who is riding a horse at this time of day."  I turned around
and </B>
<P><B>about 25 yards from me was a figure, leading a horse down the road.
 I was </B>
<P><B>confused and bewildered and then about 5 seconds later it dissolved
into </B>
<P><B>nothingness.  I didn't feel scared, or threatened, I was just confused
and </B>
<P><B>impressed by what I had just seen.  The figure and the horse were both
solid </B>
<P><B>forms with a grey-ish white illumination to them.  They had no color,
the </B>
<P><B>way a person looks when illuminated by a full moon.  But because of
the </B>
<P><B>storm earlier in the night, there was no moon.  The sky was completely
</B>
<P><B>clouded over.  I don't feel that I saw a wondering spirit, I just feel
that </B>
<P><B>somehow I got the chance to see through a window to the past, or perhaps
</B>
<P><B>view energy that was left over from 150 years ago.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B> Was It a Ghost or My Imagination?</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: cbrown@transpeg.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well this happened to me a long time ago </B>
<P><B>although the situation goes through my mind allot,well when I was younger
my </B>
<P><B>relatives that would stay with us would start to tell these stories
about </B>
<P><B>seeing an old women by the fire place and the restroom. This women
would </B>
<P><B>just stare at them and then go away. My mom would say that it was our
old </B>
<P><B>neibors mother that use to own our home before we did, anyhow one day
I was </B>
<P><B>getting ready to go out somewhere and my sister was also getting ready
to go out </B>
<P><B>herself and she was trying on different types of outfits this was in
the 80's so </B>
<P><B>trench coats and black captain like hats were in and I had seen her
wear this </B>
<P><B>outfit before, anyway I wasgetting ready in the bathroom and our bathroom
</B>
<P><B>medicine cabinet use to face the dining room so here I am brushing
my teeth and I </B>
<P><B>look up in the mirror and I saw a person walk right through the living
room </B>
<P><B>into the dining area wearing a black hat and a black trench coat and
what I saw </B>
<P><B>walk very slowly I thought nothing of it because I thought it was my
sister and </B>
<P><B>I shouted out to her/it "your going to wear that again?" and I laughed
after I </B>
<P><B>was done doingwhat I was doing I walked up to my mom and said where's
</B>
<P><B>Sammy? My mom looked at me all surprised and said she left a long time
ago..I </B>
<P><B>was stunned!!!!Later that day I saw my sister and she was </B>
<P><B>wearing a total different outfit so it wasn't her. I still wonder what
that </B>
<P><B>was...The strange thing is years later I visited my dad and he and
I </B>
<P><B>started talking and somehow the conversation came up about my mom's
house he </B>
<P><B>said "Ya that house is something else" and he went on about one day
he was </B>
<P><B>watching football and something kicked the couch real hard, and about
the </B>
<P><B>house being a very old house and in the 1800's there use ou be a man
and his son </B>
<P><B>living there and one day they went fishing and somehow the boat tipped
over and </B>
<P><B>the man and son drowned.....So did I see him? or was it my </B>
<P><B>imagination?</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B> I am an identical twin, and often because of this, most people ask
us if we share experiences,</B>
<P><B>"You know,"they say, "like on television". My answer is always the
same: </B>
<P><B>sometimes. It's true that twins, on occasion, may share certain </B>
<P><B>emotions even though they may be miles apart. This is what my brother
and I have </B>
<P><B>known for years. But everything changed when my brother and his wife
and two </B>
<P><B>children moved into my late grandfather's home in Norristown, PA. The
history of the house is </B>
<P><B>nothing spectacular. The only event of any importance occurred when
my </B>
<P><B>grandfather, who had been diagnosed with colon cancer in 1987 decided
</B>
<P><B>to spend his final days at home before the cancer took him. He died
in a </B>
<P><B>hospital bed which had been set up in the living room of his house
later that </B>
<P><B>year. And from that point forward, various family members have lived
in the </B>
<P><B>house without any strange occurrences, or "bumps in the night". Until
my brother </B>
<P><B>Peter and his family moved in. The first week in their new </B>
<P><B>home, my brother was excited as ever about living in such a large house
</B>
<P><B>compared to the meager apartment he and his family had been sharing
for the past </B>
<P><B>two years. Given the history of the house (i.e.: my grandfather dying
there), </B>
<P><B>didn't bother him one bit, since he was the last person who believed
in such </B>
<P><B>tales. Then, about two months after moving in, he decided to clean
out the </B>
<P><B>basement to make room for his music equipment (he is a part time musician)
and a </B>
<P><B>new washer and dryer my father had bought them as a Christmas present.
While </B>
<P><B>digging through the accumulated junk of half a century, he happened
upon a small </B>
<P><B>Bible. Inside the front cover was an inscription denoting the bible
as a gift to </B>
<P><B>my grandfather from my great grandmother in 1906. He took it up stairs
and laid </B>
<P><B>it out on one of the coffee tables so that other family member visiting
could </B>
<P><B>see it when they visited. Remember that I had yet to hear of this find
since it </B>
<P><B>had only occurred that day, but that night, I had one of the most
terrifying </B>
<P><B>nightmares I could remember. I dreamt I was standing on the landing
overlooking </B>
<P><B>the living room of my brother's house in Norristown, PA, but something
was </B>
<P><B>wrong. Having visited the house many times in the past, I vividly remember
the </B>
<P><B>layout of how it used to look when I was a child. But in my dream,
I remember </B>
<P><B>seeing an end table which was never there before, on which a book was
placed. I </B>
<P><B>was drawn to it for some reason. I slowly descended the stairs, even
now </B>
<P><B>recalling how hollow my footsteps sounded on the hard wood floor as
I made my </B>
<P><B>way towards the end table. As I got there, I looked down and saw that
it was </B>
<P><B>(surprise!), small bible. Upon opening it, I saw there was an inscription
made </B>
<P><B>out to my brother from our father. This is where things got really
spooky. I </B>
<P><B>remember hearing my brother's voice behind me say: "This is mine which
dad gave </B>
<P><B>me. Please give it back." I was too terrified to turn around, because
even </B>
<P><B>though it sounded like my brother, there was something "otherworldly"
</B>
<P><B>about the whole thing. I finally succumbed to curiosity and turned
around. This </B>
<P><B>was (of course!) when I woke up screaming something, I don't remember
what. I </B>
<P><B>startled my wife who was then yelling at me to: "keep it down! The
neighbors </B>
<P><B>will think we're fighting or something!". Later that morning, I spoke
to </B>
<P><B>Peter to tell him the strange dream I had, and that's when he told
me about what </B>
<P><B>he had found, and who it really belonged too. I was startled beyond
words. I </B>
<P><B>told him I would be down in about an hour (I live in Perkasie, PA
approximately </B>
<P><B>an hour north of Norristown) to see the book. "Too late," he said.
"Why?" I </B>
<P><B>asked. "It's gone," he replied. The conversation went on from </B>
<P><B>there about how he had placed it on the end table, an end table he
they had just </B>
<P><B>picked up at a yard sale that day, but when he woke up, it was gone.
I asked if </B>
<P><B>his wife could have taken it, but he said that was impossible. They
had flown </B>
<P><B>back to Texas two days earlier to visit her folks and took the kids
with her for </B>
<P><B>the short vacation. After going round and round about what could have
happened </B>
<P><B>to it, as well as the strange dream I had and what the voice had said
to me, in </B>
<P><B>the end we just didn't know what to say. I guess it was one of those
things that </B>
<P><B>will never really be explained. Two weeks later, his wife and </B>
<P><B>two children arrived back home and were in the process of unpacking
when she </B>
<P><B>went down to the basement to see how the cleanup had gone. Thatwhen
she asked him </B>
<P><B>about the small bible. "What </B>
<P><B>bible?" he asked his wife. "Oh, the one in the basement near the keyboard
you </B>
<P><B>put there." Looking confused I'm sure, my brother ran down to the basement
and </B>
<P><B>sure enough, there it was on the floor, right where he had originally
found it. </B>
<P><B>Picking it up, he read the inside cover again. Only this time, there
was no </B>
<P><B>inscription at all. Did he imagine the writing to </B>
<P><B>begin with? Did my weird dream that night have anything to do with
it </B>
<P><B>"disappearing" again? I don't know. Neither does Peter. But one thing's
for </B>
<P><B>sure: my grandfather does.</B>

<P><B>The Last Goodbye</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: tigeriz@hawaii.rr.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>Although, I have not had alot of personal contact with my father's
side </B>
<P><B>of the family due to my parent's divorce, I always felt loved and accepted
by </B>
<P><B>them. I had only been out to see them in Kansas maybe three times since
1975 </B>
<P><B>because the trip between there and Hawaii is too expensive. In 1993,
I was going </B>
<P><B>to visit my father since I finally saved enough money to do so. Just
before I </B>
<P><B>walked out of the door of my apartment, my cousin called and said that
I should </B>
<P><B>pack something in black because they didn't think that my grandfather
would </B>
<P><B>survive much longer (he had been in and out of the hospital in the
last few </B>
<P><B>years of his life.). Surprised at the coincidence of the timing (me
visiting </B>
<P><B>just before he passes on)I said that I had and that I hoped that grandpa
would </B>
<P><B>hang on long enough for me to say goodbye. My cousin sounded doubtful
but hoped </B>
<P><B>the same. Then we hung up. When I got to my father's house (which was
actually </B>
<P><B>my grandparents home), it was late in the afternoon. Since everyone
either lived </B>
<P><B>in the same town or the one next to it, they had come over to greet
me and talk </B>
<P><B>a bit, then left. My father asked if I wanted to sleep in my grandparent's
room. </B>
<P><B>I told him that I didn't want to. It felt like they were still in there
even </B>
<P><B>though my grandmother had passed on a few years ago and grandpa was
in the </B>
<P><B>nursing home with her even before she passed on. My father accepted
my response </B>
<P><B>and so I slept on the living room couch. The next day, my cousins were
in and out </B>
<P><B>visiting me. At one point I noticed my aunt on the phone talking in
a low voice. </B>
<P><B>I looked at my dad and I asked him what was up. He told me that grandpa
died </B>
<P><B>yesterday. I asked him why didn't he tell me yesterday. He said that
I just got </B>
<P><B>there after 14 hours of plane rides, transfers and one delay and thought
that </B>
<P><B>since I was tired, he didn't want to stress me out. I was disappointed
because I </B>
<P><B>really wanted to give my goodbyes. I found out that he had passed on
at the same </B>
<P><B>time I had landed in Kansas. He asked me if I wanted to go view the
body and I </B>
<P><B>said that I did. When I got to see him, I didn't feel that was him
so I felt </B>
<P><B>that I didn't get in a proper good-bye. The next day was the funeral.
I spent </B>
<P><B>the rest of the day playing with younger cousins and catching up with
the older </B>
<P><B>ones. That evening at about 9:30pm, my father said he was tired and
was going to </B>
<P><B>bed. I told him that I was going to stay up and watch TV. So I watched
him get </B>
<P><B>up, go to the front door which was only 6 inches away from the foot
of the couch </B>
<P><B>that was I lying on, locked the screen door, then closed the main door,
lock the </B>
<P><B>door knob and latched the hook latch that was about eye level on the
door. We </B>
<P><B>said our good nights and he went to bed. I was lying on the couch watching
TV, </B>
<P><B>when I felt a cool breeze go past me, brushing my left ear. Then the
main door </B>
<P><B>that I had seen my father lock and latch, OPENED up, paused and closed
firmly. I </B>
<P><B>then said "Good-bye, Grandpa." I was so confident that that was grandpa
that I </B>
<P><B>didn't even feel the need to check the door. The next morning, I woke
up when I </B>
<P><B>heard my father walk into the living room. We said our good mornings
as I watched </B>
<P><B>him unlock then unlatch the hook to the main door as well as the screen
door and </B>
<P><B>go outside to get the morning paper. When he came back in he noticed
me still </B>
<P><B>staring at the door. He asked me what I was staring at and I told him
what </B>
<P><B>happened last night. He smiled and said that he's glad that we got
to say our </B>
<P><B>good byes. </B>

<P><B>I Have Seen Your " Imp "</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Melli-K@webtv.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I had an experience with an entity you described as an " imp."  It
was</B>
<P><B>at a local graveyard I was investigating with a few friends of mine.</B>
<P><B>The graveyard is a fairly small one with a stone wall all around and
a</B>
<P><B>small caretakers shed about 15 to 20 feet outside the fence.  I had
been</B>
<P><B>there before and had seen the entity.  It was the size of a medium
dog</B>
<P><B>and ran on all fours.  It is really hard to put a shape to it.  Sort
of</B>
<P><B>a cross between an o'possum and a person.  ( if that makes any sense!
)   </B>
<P><B>       When my friends and I got there, I didn't tell them what to
look</B>
<P><B>for or where to look.  About five minutes after we got there one
person</B>
<P><B>pointed it out to me.  I asked him what he thought it looked like.
 He</B>
<P><B>said, " I can't describe it. "  The funny thing is with this thing,
it</B>
<P><B>tries to jump the fence in to the graveyard.  It moves between the
shed</B>
<P><B>and the wall closest to the shed.  It makes a running start and jumps
as</B>
<P><B>if it is going to clear the fence.  It looks like it hits some kind
of</B>
<P><B>barrier and drops back on the ground.  It does not do the same thing
all</B>
<P><B>the time.  Most of the time it just moves back and forth between the</B>
<P><B>wall and the fence.</B>
<P><B>       I had observed this thing three times before this particular</B>
<P><B>outing.  The people that were with me were focusing on it and not the</B>
<P><B>grave yard which was putting an awesome light show that night.  I
said</B>
<P><B>to them,  " Don't pay any attention to that stupid thing.  It's
annoying</B>
<P><B>and it never does anything else."   Dave, this thing stopped and
looked</B>
<P><B>straight at us.  It then went behind the care takers shed.  Needless
to</B>
<P><B>say, the people that were with me were scared to death. Then, as I</B>
<P><B>turned to say something to them, this thing started to bang very
loudly</B>
<P><B>on the tin roof of the building.  I turned toward the building and
said,</B>
<P><B>" That is very impressive and it must take an awful lot of energy to
do.</B>
<P><B>If you'll stop, we will leave."  It immediatley stopped.  This was
too</B>
<P><B>much for me.  I started to walk toward the shed.  As I got to a place</B>
<P><B>where I could see behind the shed, I saw that it was standing
upright.</B>
<P><B>At that moment it hit me.  It was like a huge static shock all over
my</B>
<P><B>body and it knocked me back a few steps.  It also cracked loud enough</B>
<P><B>for the people behind me to hear it.   </B>
<P><B>      I guess I made it mad because I lied to it. Instead of leaving,
I</B>
<P><B>went closer.  I went back to the same graveyard several weeks later
with</B>
<P><B>my cousin and as soon as we got out of the car and approached the
wall,</B>
<P><B>it started banging on the roof again.  It clearly does not like me.</B>
<P><B>This is one of the wierdest things I have ever experienced.  This</B>
<P><B>critter holds a grudge.  I haven't been back for a while.  My
schedule</B>
<P><B>hasn't allowed it.  I really want to take someone else along because
I</B>
<P><B>want a witness if something else happens.  No one that went the first</B>
<P><B>time will go back with me.  </B>
<P><B>       I am very interested in hooking up with other people who are</B>
<P><B>interested in the same things.  I have been used by a friend to
'feel'</B>
<P><B>out places to take  pictures.  I seem to be very sensitive to this
sort</B>
<P><B>of thing.  I have been able to accurately tell people about objects
by</B>
<P><B>touching them.  The few times I did this, however, I scared myself
so</B>
<P><B>badly I never tried again.  I might be interested in exploring this,</B>
<P><B>too.  I would love to talk to someone who can do this and could help
me</B>
<P><B>sort out my feelings on it. </B>
<P><B>     You have a wonderful site!!   Hope to hear from you.  I live in</B>
<P><B>Pennsylvania, very close to the Maryland border.   I also know of
some</B>
<P><B>pretty active graveyards a few other places.  The first one I ever
went</B>
<P><B>to made me a believer forever.</B>

<P><B>My Daughter's Angel?</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: mccoy@netins.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> We have lived in this house but </B>
<P><B>just 2 years and have several occasions of unexplainable happenings.
On </B>
<P><B>two seperate occurances when she was alone she has heard or seen a
</B>
<P><B>presence. Here are the two seperate stories. It was summertime in the
early afternoon</B>
<P><B>I was at work, my husband was golfing and my son was at his grandparents
my </B>
<P><B>daughter (Dakota) was in the house with her aunt Vera. Vera was in
the spare bedroom </B>
<P><B>at the end of the hall writing a letter and Dakota was in her room
located next </B>
<P><B>to the spare bed Dakota was in the middle of cleaning out her desk
</B>
<P><B>when she was interupted by an unknown male voice.&amp;nbsp; The voice
was deep,clear </B>
<P><B>and loud. It said...Are you ok Koty? ( Koty is her </B>
<P><B>nickname) She turned around to and there was no one in the room with
her, the door was still </B>
<P><B>closed. Koty started to write small notes to Vera telling her of what
just </B>
<P><B>happened and sliding them under Vera's door. Vera came out and assured
</B>
<P><B>Dakota that there was no one at home but them and the t.v. was off,
the radio </B>
<P><B>was off and it would be ok. I still have the little notes she wrote
to </B>
<P><B>Vera,Vera told me all of this when Dakota was not around so she had
no idea I </B>
<P><B>already knew. Dakota is 8 years old and never had an active </B>
<P><B>imagination or pretend playmate It took Koty several weeks before </B>
<P><B>she could bring herself to talk about it and tell me. It was the 4th
of July, one month </B>
<P><B>after the bedroom voice ordeal when my daughter and I are riding back
to our home together </B>
<P><B>when she tells me this... Mom, do </B>
<P><B>you believe in angels, and can men be angels? I was </B>
<P><B>curious about the question and she told me what </B>
<P><B>happened. She said she was in the bathroom brushing her teeth when
a man </B>
<P><B>appeared behind her in the doorway watching over her he then turned
and moved down </B>
<P><B>the hallway and vanished.She had never seen him before and hasn't seen
</B>
<P><B>him since.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It Happens All the Time</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: leetiner@flash.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>When I was about four or five years old, something </B>
<P><B>happened to me that I still recall pretty clearly. I was at my </B>
<P><B>grandparents house to spend the night, and it was apparently getting
late </B>
<P><B>because I remember my granddaddy had already gone to bed.Grandma had
just finished</B>
<P><B> giving me some cornbread in buttermilk, and I got down on the floor
to play. I remember looking </B>
<P><B>toward the window that faces the road and the front yard and seeing
a figure </B>
<P><B>there in the window. To me, it was my idea of what a puppet of Jesus
</B>
<P><B>Christ would look like. It had brown hair, a beard, a long white "robe",
</B>
<P><B>and mitten hands. It was just sitting there looking in. I looked at
</B>
<P><B>Grandma, and she just said, "Don't worry, it happens all the time."</B>
<P><B>At first, I thought that maybe my granddaddy was </B>
<P><B>playing a trick, and so I ran into his room, and he was fast asleep.
When </B>
<P><B>I came back into the room, I don't remember looking at the window...I
was </B>
<P><B>probably too scared.Well, years went by, and I sometimes thought about
</B>
<P><B>it, but I thought my daddy thought I'd dreamt it. But one day, after
my </B>
<P><B>granddaddy had died, and my grandma was in a nursing home, my cousin
and I were </B>
<P><B>cleaning up the old house because we were thinking of moving in together.
</B>
<P><B>I had been cleaning the living room, and I mentioned to her that I
always </B>
<P><B>avoided looking out that front window at night unless there were headlights
</B>
<P><B>shining in. She looked at me kind of funny and her eyes got really
big, </B>
<P><B>and she told me, "I saw a face there, too." We decided to leave and
get </B>
<P><B>something to eat. Now a few years later, I asked her exactly what she
</B>
<P><B>thought she saw, but I did not tell her what I saw. She said that </B>
<P><B>she saw a face that she thought looked like Jesus to her. Then I told
</B>
<P><B>her what I had seen. That was the only time I remember seeing something,
</B>
<P><B>but I remember my daddy telling me that grandma was always seeing </B>
<P><B>"things." Maybe the things she saw were really there. You just had
</B>
<P><B>to be in the right frame of mind.</B>

<P><B>New Husband Haunting</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: robermom@prodigy.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I bought my first and probably only home when I was forty. (I'm</B>
<P><B>forty-six now.) I couldn't afford much, so I look at lots of  homes
that</B>
<P><B>were just not in good shape, or else were in terrible neighborhoods.</B>
<P><B>One day I had to pick my daughter up after a slumber party and</B>
<P><B>accidently showed up at the wrong address--a house with the identical</B>
<P><B>street address as the house I was trying to find! (It turned outTHREE</B>
<P><B>houses shared that address, though they were each about a mile
apart!)</B>
<P><B>Shortly after this incident, this same house went us for sale. I</B>
<P><B>askedthe realtor to show it to me. She said it was in a higher price</B>
<P><B>category, but remarkably, when she looked it up again, it was
affordable</B>
<P><B>to me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Grandma</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: leetiner@flash.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> I am 45 years old.When I was 14 my Grandma was in a nursing home.
She had become very frail </B>
<P><B>and sickly and of course I did not realize that she was on her way
</B>
<P><B>out. At this time my brother, who was six years older than myself was
working swing shift,</B>
<P><B> which meant that he did not get home fromwork until after midnight
We shared </B>
<P><B>the same bedroom. As for as that goes, we shared the same bed. Most
</B>
<P><B>of the time I would already be asleep when he arrived from work and
was hardly </B>
<P><B>aware he was even there until I awoke the next morning. One night </B>
<P><B>I awoke. Well, actually I was only partially awake and tried to open
</B>
<P><B>my eyes. There standing beside my bed was Jesus Christ wearing his
</B>
<P><B>white robe and looking very peaceful. I closed my eyes again and then
sort </B>
<P><B>of reopened them. I was still more asleep than I was awake. Then I
</B>
<P><B>saw my Grandma standing were Jesus had been only a moment before.An
</B>
<P><B>amazing thing about her was that she wasn't in bad health at all, but
looked </B>
<P><B>very fat and lively as I remembered her a few short years before. Before
</B>
<P><B>she had went to the rest home and was still living in her own house.
But </B>
<P><B>strangely she was wearing a pure white gown. She was not soiled or
</B>
<P><B>blemished in any way. She was a picture of health. I, still being in
</B>
<P><B>the twilight stage of sleep,  closed my eyes again. Then, Realizing
what I </B>
<P><B>had seen, I woke up with a start. It was only my brother standing there
</B>
<P><B>getting ready for bed. I went back to sleep </B>
<P><B>and began to dream. As far as I could tell, I must have dreamed all
</B>
<P><B>night about my Grandma. But I didn't dream of her as she was at that
</B>
<P><B>time,lying on the nursing home bed,skin and bones,  half dead, and
</B>
<P><B>senile,but as she had been when I was maybe five or six years old.
And all </B>
<P><B>the other characters in the dream, including myself were about eight
or </B>
<P><B>nine years younger also. I dreamed about how I used to stay with </B>
<P><B>my Grandma when my mom would go shopping, My Grandma was healthy and
happy </B>
<P><B>as before, and she would give me pie or cake or cookies. I dreamed
about </B>
<P><B>how the whole family and my aunts, uncles, and cousins would all get
together at </B>
<P><B>Grandma's house on Christmas and other occasions. The adults would
</B>
<P><B>all gather around the table for a large meal, and we kids would usually
have a </B>
<P><B>plate made for us and we would sit in a circle on the livingroom
floor.</B>
<P><B>Those were happy days. I remember when my Grandma </B>
<P><B>was still living in her own house that she had an ashtray made from
an antique </B>
<P><B>Mason Jar lid with soda pop tops stacked tightly together all the way
around </B>
<P><B>it. As a small child I had tried to pull the snuggly wired together
tops </B>
<P><B>from around the lid, but the builder of the ashtray had fitted them
so well that </B>
<P><B>they would not budge. I was told that my dad had built that for Grandma
</B>
<P><B>years before. Grandma didn't smoke, althoughcome to think of it she
</B>
<P><B>did dip a little snuff. But she liked to havean ashtray or two </B>
<P><B>around the house to oblige those who did smoke. My dad is dead now
and I </B>
<P><B>have since wished I'd have asked him how he fitted and wired those
caps so </B>
<P><B>well. As I remember there was a wire that ran through the center of
each </B>
<P><B>cap, but it was done so that even where the ends were tied together
the </B>
<P><B>wire was hardly visible. Anyway, I dreamed that I </B>
<P><B>was there while he was actually making that ashtray even though I
understand he </B>
<P><B>made it before I was born. I dreamed a lot of other things too, such
as </B>
<P><B>Grandma scolding my cousin and me for something naughty we did </B>
<P><B>andother small events too numerous for me to remember them all in </B>
<P><B>detail after this many years have passed. Yes, it was probably </B>
<P><B>the most pleasant dream I have experienced in my life. It was a dream
in </B>
<P><B>which I didn't want to awake from. I think I was still in the process
of </B>
<P><B>enjoying the dream when sometime around sunrise my sister's husband
came to my </B>
<P><B>bedside, gently nudged me awake and said in a quiet voice "Curtis,
wake </B>
<P><B>up. Youre Grandmother died last night."</B>
