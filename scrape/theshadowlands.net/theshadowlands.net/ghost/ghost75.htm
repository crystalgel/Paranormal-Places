<P>
<P>
<P><B>It all happened more than 20 years ago, at an old theatre on Staten
Island, </B>
<P><B>New York called The Ritz.  It had closed in the mid 60's as a movie

theatre, </B>
<P><B>but it had also been a vaudeville theatre with a rich history.  It
was a big </B>
<P><B>theatre for its time, holding over 2,000 people.  It was one of those
nice </B>
<P><B>old-fashioned ornate theatres, with a big stage, wings, and dressing
rooms.  </B>
<P><B>In the early 70's, a group of guys who worked for Con Edison bought
the </B>
<P><B>theatre. They decided to run rock concerts at The Ritz.  To get people
to </B>
<P><B>help out fixing up the theatre, they offered anyone who volunteered
that they </B>
<P><B>could work as a stagehand, or an usher.  That's where I come in.  I
was just </B>
<P><B>out of high school and had no job, so two friends and me volunteered.
 It </B>
<P><B>took us a while to mix with everyone, learn their names, and make </B>
<P><B>acquaintances.  We worked every afternoon Monday through Friday.  The

opening </B>
<P><B>night show was coming up fast and there was still a lot of work to
do.  We </B>
<P><B>came in one afternoon and someone yelled out that all the tools were

missing </B>
<P><B>on stage.  We mounted a search and found the tools at the top of the

balcony, </B>
<P><B>hidden behind the radiators.  We thought no more about it and got to
work.  </B>
<P><B>The next day, we came in and somebody wanted to know who had finished
the </B>
<P><B>exit lights?  When nobody came forth, one of the owners said "I left
about </B>
<P><B>half to be finished and now they're all done!"  What we didn't know
was that </B>
<P><B>for along time, before we had worked there, that things like this had

</B>
<P><B>happened every day.  Nobody thought much of it at the time, more like
a </B>
<P><B>practical joke.  But everybody wanted to find out who the trickster
was.  The </B>
<P><B>general consensus was that somebody was breaking in at night through
the </B>
<P><B>dressing rooms.  Slowly, a plan developed to find out what was going
on.  We </B>
<P><B>decided we would meet at the theatre at midnight, turn out the lights,
and </B>
<P><B>wait for whoever it was.  We all waited on the stage and a panel off
in the </B>
<P><B>wings controlled the lights. The plan was we would leave a few people
on </B>
<P><B>stage to turn on the lights the moment we started to hear any noises.
 We </B>
<P><B>waited until the small hours of the morning.  Just as we were ready
to call </B>
<P><B>it a night, strange noises like footsteps started.   We could hear
them above </B>
<P><B>the theatre on the cat walks in the dome.  At first we thought they
were </B>
<P><B>rats, but then we realized that they were too loud and too fast.  Quickly

we </B>
<P><B>turned on the lights.  One group climbed the ladders at the back of
the </B>
<P><B>stage, while another group climbed up into the dome from the projection

room, </B>
<P><B>at the top of the balcony.  By the time the two groups met in the dome,
the </B>
<P><B>noises had stopped.  No rats or people were found.  More than ever,
the </B>
<P><B>feeling was that someone was playing tricks on us and we were determined
to </B>
<P><B>catch them.  </B>
<P><B>	One afternoon, someone came up with the idea of searching the </B>
<P><B>catacombs underneath the theatre.  Brand new flashlights and batteries
had </B>
<P><B>been delivered for the ushers so we decided to borrow them and check
the </B>
<P><B>catacombs out.  We went in through the boiler room, we made sure we
left the </B>
<P><B>light in the boiler room on, and the door open.  Slowly, we crept through

the </B>
<P><B>tunnels.  One by one, all the flashlights went out.  We couldn't understand

</B>
<P><B>it and double-checked them to try to make them work.  But in a short
while, </B>
<P><B>ten guys were roaming the catacombs with a single lighter trying to
find our </B>
<P><B>way out.  Which wasn't easy because the boiler room door was shut and
the </B>
<P><B>light was turned out.  Since we were the only ones in the theatre,
we were </B>
<P><B>pretty confused.  Again we thought someone was playing tricks on us.
 So we </B>
<P><B>organized another midnight meeting.  This time, we would be ready.
 We set up </B>
<P><B>booby traps in the dressing room windows so that no one could climb
in.  The </B>
<P><B>windows were the easiest way to explain how people were getting in.
 Me and a </B>
<P><B>friend of mine, checked out the dressing rooms one afternoon.  A fire

escape </B>
<P><B>ran up the side of the building to the roof of the dressing rooms.
 It would </B>
<P><B>be easy for someone to climb up and be able to get in.  So my buddy
and me </B>
<P><B>headed up to the top floor of the dressing rooms, which were filled
by an old </B>
<P><B>air conditioning system.  Tons of garbage was on the floor, old papers,

</B>
<P><B>tickets, magazines, and some kind of journal filled with pages and
pages of </B>
<P><B>stuff that made no sense.  It was the first time I got a really creepy

</B>
<P><B>feeling about the place.  We left deciding that it would be pretty
hard for </B>
<P><B>anyone to get through this room without killing themselves.  While
we were </B>
<P><B>talking, we both agreed that someone was playing tricks on us, but
in the </B>
<P><B>back of our minds, we wondered if it were something else.</B>
<P><B>We all arrived at the theatre around midnight.  There must have been
about 30 </B>
<P><B>of us.  This time we split into groups with two groups in the back
of the </B>
<P><B>theatre to cover the stage, and two groups to cover the front of the

theatre, </B>
<P><B>the stairs, mezzanine, and balcony.  Many armed themselves with the
booms of </B>
<P><B>the microphone stands.  We were determined to find out what this thing
was.  </B>
<P><B>This time we didn't have to wait for long.  The noises began just like
that </B>
<P><B>had before except this time they were louder and sounded like popping

noises. </B>
<P><B> First from the dome, then the noises traveled down the stairs and
down the </B>
<P><B>ladders, and finally to underneath the theatre.  The noises went faster
and </B>
<P><B>faster, from the top to the bottom of theatre, around like circles.
 We </B>
<P><B>sprang into action, quickly climbing the stairs and ladders covering
the </B>
<P><B>entrances and dressing rooms, but the same as before, when we finally
all </B>
<P><B>met, inside the dome above the theatre, we had caught no one.  We were
all </B>
<P><B>baffled, tired, and ready to go home.  </B>
<P><B>Things quieted down for a while until my friend who was the stage manager

</B>
<P><B>asked me and my girlfriend (who is now my wife) to stay the night inside

the </B>
<P><B>theatre along with him and his girlfriend, and dog.  They were staying

there </B>
<P><B>at the time in one of the dressing rooms, but moved out because of
the </B>
<P><B>strange noises at night.  They had moved everything down onto the stage,

and </B>
<P><B>set it up nice and comfortable.  We met them there at midnight.  We
talked </B>
<P><B>the early morning hours away, mostly talking about what was happening
at the </B>
<P><B>theatre, and especially about the noises at night.  And although nobody

would </B>
<P><B>say it, we all felt the same way, we wondered if it was some kind of
spirit </B>
<P><B>or ghost.  My buddy was afraid that someone would get hurt during one
of the </B>
<P><B>shows, since there was so much noise in the theatre during the shows,
if </B>
<P><B>someone got into trouble, we would never know.  Just then, noises started

on </B>
<P><B>the mezzanine level in the front of the theatre.  A door slammed shut
and we </B>
<P><B>could hear the urinals being flushed in the men's bathroom.  As far
as we </B>
<P><B>knew, we were the only ones in the theatre, and all the doors were
locked.  </B>
<P><B>My friend and I decided to investigate.  We took his Great Dane, named

</B>
<P><B>dharma.  The dog looked really terrified and wouldn't come with us,
but </B>
<P><B>stayed with the two girls on stage, with his hands over his head. 
I said, </B>
<P><B>"great, we better get going, before I chicken out."  We climbed up
the stairs </B>
<P><B>to the bathroom, checked everything out but found nothing.  When we
got back </B>
<P><B>the girls told us they had seen something that disappeared to the left
of the </B>
<P><B>stage.  We both climbed the ladder, from where they said they saw it.

 Looked </B>
<P><B>around, and found nothing.  We moved up to one of the offices on the
second </B>
<P><B>floor, locked the door, and stayed there for the rest of the night.
 While up </B>
<P><B>in the room, we heard all kinds of weird things, but none of us was
willing </B>
<P><B>to go down and investigate.  We rather liked the door locked, and so
we </B>
<P><B>stayed until morning.  After that night, I didn't know what to think

anymore, </B>
<P><B>so I did the easiest thing, I just put it out of my mind, all together.

</B>
<P><B>Back then, I had a band; we practiced and stored our equipment in between

</B>
<P><B>shows on stage.  During one practice we all got the munchies, and decided

to </B>
<P><B>go to the store.  The lead guitar player said he would stay and watch
the </B>
<P><B>equipment while we were gone.  I said, "I don't think it's a good idea,
for </B>
<P><B>you to be here alone, strange things happen."  He just laughed and
we went to </B>
<P><B>the store.  When we got back, one look on his face told me something
had </B>
<P><B>happened.  His face was white as a ghost and he said " don't ever leave
me </B>
<P><B>alone in this theatre again!"  The sax player who sensed what we were

talking </B>
<P><B>about started playing this weird music on his flute.  He called it
voodoo </B>
<P><B>music.  I couldn't stop him, so he just went on.  When he stopped,
we all had </B>
<P><B>this creepy feeling we were not alone.  The theatre had come alive.
 It was </B>
<P><B>like the feeling of static electricity in the air, during a thunderstorm.

 </B>
<P><B>The feeling was so intense, we could hear the garbage underneath the
seats </B>
<P><B>crackle like electric was running through it.     We all had goosebumps

</B>
<P><B>running down our spine and we asked the sax player never to do that
again and </B>
<P><B>he didn't say a thing.  I can't remember if practiced or not after

that.</B>
<P><B>The next day in the afternoon, I went in to practice my drums.  There
had </B>
<P><B>been one light, mounted high on the left side on the balcony which

flickered </B>
<P><B>on and off.  No one had been able to fix it.  As I was practicing,
I noticed </B>
<P><B>that the light was going on and off to my beat.  Every time I hit the
drum, </B>
<P><B>the light would go on.  So I went into a drum solo.  The light was

following </B>
<P><B>my beat and soon after all the lights in the theatre were going on
and off to </B>
<P><B>my drumming.  I got up from my seat, walked to the door, and went home.
 By </B>
<P><B>this time I was thoroughly puzzled about the theatre.  I really didn't
know </B>
<P><B>what to make of all the strange things that were happening.  Soon after
me </B>
<P><B>and my buddy (stage manager) were talking one afternoon, and I told
him about </B>
<P><B>a friend of mine, who does the ouja board.  I told him I would bring
him down </B>
<P><B>to the theatre one night.  We showed up late on a Friday night while
a band </B>
<P><B>was rehearsing.  Lots of people were hanging out on stage, so we decided
to </B>
<P><B>set up the ouja board on the second floor in the mezzanine.  My friend
told </B>
<P><B>me he goes into a trance and told me how to ask questions to the board.
 At </B>
<P><B>first, the board spelled out things that didn't make any sense.  Then
after a </B>
<P><B>long time, it spelled out the name of a person.  His name was Ignace
Jan </B>
<P><B>Paderewski, and that he was here because he liked the music.  After
my friend </B>
<P><B>came out of his trance, we went back to my house and looked him up
in the </B>
<P><B>encyclopedia.  Sure enough, Ignace Jan Paderewski was a Polish national
and </B>
<P><B>pianist who had died in New York around 1940.  We never thought very
much of </B>
<P><B>this at the time, and forgot about it.  The theatre was becoming creepy
and </B>
<P><B>more and more people were having strange occurrences.  There are more

stories </B>
<P><B>about the theatre that I know about, but since I wasn't there, when
they took </B>
<P><B>place, I've decided not to talk about them.  </B>
<P><B>My girlfriend worked in the ticket booth along with the stage manager's

</B>
<P><B>girlfriend.  When shutting out the lights of the theatre, you had to
go first </B>
<P><B>up to the stage, shut out the house lights, then walk up the center
aisle to </B>
<P><B>the ticket booth to shut off the rest.  One day, I had left my 10-speed

bike, </B>
<P><B>behind the stage and went back to get it.  I was in the theatre by
myself; I </B>
<P><B>walked up to the stage, turned out the lights, grabbed my bike, and
was </B>
<P><B>walking up the center aisle.  I felt a creepy feeling in the back of
my neck. </B>
<P><B> I was hot and cold all at the same time.  I sensed that something
was behind </B>
<P><B>me, following me up the aisle.  When I turned around, directly in front
of </B>
<P><B>me, was a mist that was starting to form a person.  I could make out
what </B>
<P><B>seemed to me to be a head and a body.  I became so frightened I got
on my </B>
<P><B>bike and road out one of the side doors.  After that afternoon, I never

went </B>
<P><B>back to the theatre alone at night and never told anyone what I had
seen </B>
<P><B>except my girlfriend. Years later, we were visiting my buddy, the stage

</B>
<P><B>manager.  We both had married our girlfriends and had a lot to talk
about.  </B>
<P><B>Of course, we ended up talking about The Ritz.  I told them about my

bicycle </B>
<P><B>story, and our wives told us that night that we stayed together on
stage, </B>
<P><B>they had seen something also.  It was a round white light shaped as
an orb  </B>
<P><B>that came down the center aisle and disappeared to the left behind
the stage. </B>
<P><B> Was this indeed the spirit of Ignace Jan Paderewski?  Unfortunately
we will </B>
<P><B>never know.</B>
<P><B>Post Script- over the course of years The Ritz Theatre had been sold,
and </B>
<P><B>re-sold.  It's beautiful interior had been completely gutted and turned

into </B>
<P><B>a roller skating rink.  Then a tile store.  One afternoon looking for
tile, I </B>
<P><B>stopped in.  We went into the back, through the old stage doors, where
they </B>
<P><B>kept their tile.  I asked the guy, have you ever stayed here at night?
 He </B>
<P><B>just looked at me funny.  I said, "Do you ever hear strange noises
here?"  </B>
<P><B>And just looked up and said, "yes, how did you know?" </B>

<H3><A NAME=alone><B>Leave the Baby Alone</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: tammy@verinet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a story my husband told me about before we were </B>
<P><B>married. To this day, he will not watch a movie that has to do with
the Devil. </B>
<P><B>About 20 years ago, he was living with a woman who had a baby , in
Berry Creek </B>
<P><B>California. They rented a house there. It is a very small neighborhood

around a </B>
<P><B>small lake. Keep in maind that a lot of devil worshipping went on in
these hills </B>
<P><B>arond the Oroville area. He and this woman were leaving one rented
house on the </B>
<P><B>lake to move to another across the lake. While my now husband was vacuuming

the </B>
<P><B>place the were leaving, he felt a presence. When he turned around,
there was a 7 </B>
<P><B>foot figure in a dark hooded robe, staring at him. </B>
<P><B>They finally moved to another home on the lake. The first </B>
<P><B>bizarre thing to happen was that the baby of the woman he was living
with kept </B>
<P><B>choking for no reason. They would get in the car to rush the baby to
the </B>
<P><B>hospital, but as soon as they got away from the house, the baby was

fine.They </B>
<P><B>would find tacks, nails, and other things on the floor that the baby
could choke </B>
<P><B>on on the floor at times, even after thay had just vacuumed.</B>
<P><B>One night the baby started choking again and they called the </B>
<P><B>hospital. A high pitched scream was heard over the phone. They finally
took the </B>
<P><B>baby to Davis hospital, but nothing was found to cause the choking
fits. </B>
<P><B>One time they had soaked the baby's diapers in the sink with </B>
<P><B>bleach to find thd sink with the diapers filled with what looked like

blood. </B>
<P><B>They had a friend who came to visit them, but would not get out of
the car in </B>
<P><B>the drive way because of a bad feeling. </B>
<P><B>Then something happened that made them leave the house for </B>
<P><B>good. About 3:00 a.m. They heard what sounded like a two footed,

cloven-hoofed </B>
<P><B>something jump onto their second story deck. It made it to the end
of the deck </B>
<P><B>in about 6 steps, which meant it must have had long legs. Then they
heard it </B>
<P><B>jump off the high deck. The next day they moved without taking all
their stuff. </B>
<P><B>As they were leaving, two things happened. The ceiling door to that
attic </B>
<P><B>dropped open ( there was a pentigram and posters of the devil in there
they had </B>
<P><B>found when they first moved there) on it's own. And while my now husband's

</B>
<P><B>girlfriend was carrying the baby down the stairs outside to leave,
a hand </B>
<P><B>grabbed her and cause her to fall. Luckily, they were both okay. </B>
<P><B>My husband heard later that a prominate family had owned the </B>
<P><B>house before them and their baby died by falling off the top deck and

breaking </B>
<P><B>it's neck. </B>

</H3><P>b<B>y: DrkEmrylds@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>	As long as I can remember I've been fascinated with the Supernatural,

</B>
<P><B>probably because the female side of my family, my Grandmother's side,
the </B>
<P><B>Winchester clan, have the uncanny ability to sense things, if not see

things </B>
<P><B>outright. I'm going to retell a few of the stories I've grown up with
my </B>
<P><B>whole life, and then a story or two of my own.</B>
<P><B>	My great uncle S.C. was a trooper in France, and on the night of </B>
<P><B>V-Day she "dreamed" of him standing before her bed, and he told her
he had </B>
<P><B>died, and that he loved her, that he wanted her to be good for their
</B>
<P><B>parents... and that he was ok, he was goin' to be fine... and not to
worry </B>
<P><B>about him. The next day my grandmother wandered in the kitchen to find
her </B>
<P><B>mother sobbing... S.C. had been in a one way tunnel, and had been hit
by </B>
<P><B>another jeep cruising down the wrong passageway. </B>
<P><B>	That is the only paranormal experience my grandmother will claim </B>
<P><B>she's had... but I suspect there has been others.</B>
<P><B>	The next incident involves my Aunt Beth and my grandfather. My </B>
<P><B>grandfather was a Methodist minister and one night he took his youth
group to </B>
<P><B>an area known to be haunted. They stopped their cars in a line, turned
off </B>
<P><B>the lights, and waited. 45 minutes later balls of light began to form,

</B>
<P><B>hopping and dancing about the cars, hitting against them... almost
as if they </B>
<P><B>wanted inside... Needless to say my grandfather and my aunt hightailed
it </B>
<P><B>outta there.</B>
<P><B>	Now... fastforward to about 20 years ago. My great grandparents died

</B>
<P><B>within months of each other, and 4 months before I was born. One morning,

my </B>
<P><B>mom was checking up on me to see how well I was sleeping in my new
crib... </B>
<P><B>She opened the nursery door quietly, and was startled to see the solid

forms </B>
<P><B>of my deceased great-grandparents looking over my crib, my

great-grandmother </B>
<P><B>holding my little hand in hers.</B>
<P><B>	I never had any "visitations" besides the ones I believe all kids
</B>
<P><B>have - guardian angels and the like - until I was around 8... this
I know as </B>
<P><B>fact because it was my birthday.. Nov.27th.. when my first and only
TRULY </B>
<P><B>terrifying incident happened. We had had a bonfire, and I was feeling

really </B>
<P><B>witchy... I was LOVING it. Anyway, I was left alone outside when I
heard a </B>
<P><B>voice calling my name, which I ignored like I usually did when I wanted
to be </B>
<P><B>naughty. It got insistant, and louder, almost until it seemed like
the voice </B>
<P><B>was right beside me.. I remember sayin' "What !" and something slapping

</B>
<P><B>the back of my neck hard. I started walking towards the woods, for
reasons </B>
<P><B>I'll probably never know. Ok.... behind my house there was a patch
of dense </B>
<P><B>woods, then a DEEP lake full of fishes and snakes and all that yucky
stuff. I </B>
<P><B>walked until I got to that lake, took off my shoes, and waded in. I

remember </B>
<P><B>something grabbing my leg, and trying to pull me under... all of a
sudden I </B>
<P><B>was be jerked up and out of the water, by some unseen force..I hit
a tree </B>
<P><B>limb, and when I awoke I was inches from that fire, my mother trying
to wake </B>
<P><B>me up. I had a huge circular bruise from where something had latched
onto my </B>
<P><B>foot. I do not remember getting back to my house... and I don't care
to know </B>
<P><B>what was there... it was just evil...</B>
<P><B>	The last story I'm going to tell you is the one that happened about
a </B>
<P><B>year ago.. maybe 2 years. My mom, my mom's new fiance and me moved
in a house </B>
<P><B>that was built in 1912, and next to it was a graveyard. Classic haunting

</B>
<P><B>conditions, no? Yep... and there WERE ghosts there. My first sighting,
if you </B>
<P><B>will, was one morning in the dining room... if you can call it that.
I was </B>
<P><B>eating breakfast, facing the wall, when I just happened to look up..
into a </B>
<P><B>face in the wall. It was just staring at me, watching me eat. It didnt
seem </B>
<P><B>evil or anything.</B>
<P><B>	Nothing happened for a few weeks, no faces in walls or noises of </B>
<P><B>anysort, even though either me or my mom would sense something in the

house. </B>
<P><B>Then one night my dog, Wickit, was let outside where he promptly was
killed </B>
<P><B>by a truck.. brakes squeeling, ya know, trying not to hit Wickit..
but Wickit </B>
<P><B>died anyway. My mom ran outside, but didnt see a truck or anything...
no </B>
<P><B>rubber tire tracks.. no nothing except for the dog's corpse. Then,
a few </B>
<P><B>weeks later, my mom was alone in the house cooking dinner when she
heard the </B>
<P><B>door slam, and then footfalls. She assumed Billy was home, and called
out to </B>
<P><B>him. He didnt answer. She filed it away as the wind. Then, all of a
sudden, </B>
<P><B>she felt something brush her neck, like a caress- a man's hand. She
turned </B>
<P><B>around, praying Billy would be there. He wasn't.</B>
<P><B>	During this time a St.Benard puppy my step sister gave me died </B>
<P><B>mysteriously..</B>
<P><B>	Things started to hide themselves, computer files would become </B>
<P><B>deleted, or show up in the wrong file... simple things that could be

written </B>
<P><B>off as absentminedness.</B>
<P><B>	But not this. One night around midnight I turned off my computer and

</B>
<P><B>got into bed, and at promptly 2:56 am I awoke to feel my last surviving

dog, </B>
<P><B>Sandy, laying on my bed. Now, Sandy refused to come in my room. No
if ands or </B>
<P><B>buts, so that's why it was so odd for her to be there. I patted the
space </B>
<P><B>beside me, and my hand fell into an indention... like something invisible

to </B>
<P><B>human eyes laid there. I jumped out of bed, turned on the light, and
I could </B>
<P><B>SEE the indention!! It was DEFINITELY a man's body, solid, but not
very </B>
<P><B>tall... perhaps like it was an older man or a younger teenager.</B>
<P><B>	That was the last night I slept in that house. The last time I </B>
<P><B>stepped foot in that room was last summer.. to get a bathing suit I
had left </B>
<P><B>in my old room. I stopped by the bathroom, and heard my aunt come in
and walk </B>
<P><B>into the kitchen. When I met up with her, she held the packaged food
my </B>
<P><B>grandmother wanted, and she was staring towards that aforementioned
wall. " </B>
<P><B>Did you hear it?" she asked me. I hadn't. She claimed that before I
walked in </B>
<P><B>there had been 2 voices, a male and a female's, quietly arguing, and
when I </B>
<P><B>walked in, they faded away.</B>
<P><B>	The next day Sandy was found dead underneath a shed.</B>
<P><B>	I have more stories, if you'd like to hear them, just email me at
the </B>
<P><B>above address!!</B>

<P>
<P><B>My name is Nic and I was then a  16 year old boy, and I had some birds
that had a </B>
<P><B>baby bird well that baby bird got sick, and I tried to cure it by feeding

it. </B>
<P><B>I kept in a laundrey basket (with no top).  Then my parents, and I
went </B>
<P><B>somewhere, then we came back to find out that my dog toldly turned
it inside </B>
<P><B>out.  I figured it got well enough when I was gone, and flew out of
the </B>
<P><B>basket.  Then my dog got at it.  I cried and cried that day,  During
the night when </B>
<P><B>I was in bed trying to get to sleep I saw thin dark shadow (in the
shape of a </B>
<P><B>bird) fly from my door to down to the floor.  I had had my foot hanging
out </B>
<P><B>of my bed and as soon as I saw it my foot felt something touch it.
I recoiled </B>
<P><B>my foot.  I think it was my bird telling me it was ok. I finaly settled
my </B>
<P><B>self down enough to stick my foot out, and start falling asleep.  then
I </B>
<P><B>opened my eyes because I felt a presence.  I saw about a five foot
fuzzy </B>
<P><B>shadow of a man run from my door to my wall and run into the wall.
 When </B>
<P><B>that happened I heard a light rumbling sound.   From that night on
I would </B>
<P><B>hear some foot steps, and I would always felt uneasy during the night,
so I </B>
<P><B>would walk around the house with all the lights on, and keeping my
back to </B>
<P><B>the wall.  I always stay up to about 1 or 2 in the morning, too.  We
moved </B>

<H3><A NAME=house><B>Nora's House</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By:  tsaltase@comcorpinc.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>This is an account of what happened to my friend Nora and her husband

Max</B>
<P><B>about one year ago in their house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Nora lives in the house she grew up in with her husband Max, her mother

and</B>
<P><B>younger sister Gina.  Nora's father passed away 4 years ago.  There

have</B>
<P><B>been quite a few strange occurances in Nora's house since her father

passed</B>
<P><B>away, but this one scared me the most when she told me about it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night, Nora was at home alone with her husband.  Her mother and

sister</B>
<P><B>had tickets for a play downtown, and would be home quite late.  Since

it</B>
<P><B>was about 10:00 at night, and the middle of winter, Nora and Max decided

to</B>
<P><B>go to their room and watch some television in bed.  After being in
bed for</B>
<P><B>some time, there was a knock on their bedroom door.  "Come in", Nora

called</B>
<P><B>out, thinking it was odd that her mother and sister were home so early.

 No</B>
<P><B>one came in.  Nora started thinking she imagined the knocking, but
Max had</B>
<P><B>heard it too.  Just as she was about to dismiss the whole incident,

there</B>
<P><B>was another knock at the door.  Nora looked over at Max, hesitated
for a</B>
<P><B>minute, and then repeated, "Come in" louder this time.  Still no one</B>
<P><B>entered.  Since their bed faced the door, they both had a clear view</B>
<P><B>without any furniture or other obstructions.  After what seemed like

hours,</B>
<P><B>a cigarette rolled under the door and into the room.  No one in the

house</B>
<P><B>smoked, except Nora's father who had passed away years ago.  The house

had</B>
<P><B>been rid of all cigarettes by now.  It was bad enough that this

cigarette</B>
<P><B>appeared in the first place, but it was the same brand that Nora's

father</B>
<P><B>smoked.  Max and Nora sat frozen in bed.  Eventually the two got up

enough</B>
<P><B>nerve to open the door and examine the hallway and the rest of the

house.</B>
<P><B>As they suspected, Nora's mother and sister had not been home, and

indeed</B>
<P><B>did not make it home until about 1:00 a.m. (Nora and Max waited up

for</B>
<P><B>them).</B>
<P>
<P><B>Since then other things have happened in Nora's house (stereo coming
on by</B>
<P><B>itself, doors opening &amp; locking from the inside).  But they all
occur quite</B>
<P><B>sporadically.  It seems as though whatever entity is in the house

doesn't</B>
<P><B>want to harass them, but at the same time, doesn't want them to

forget</B>
<P><B>about it either.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I was only 4 years old, but I remember it like it was only yesterday.

The</B>
<P><B>first sign that I had was the room in the back of our house. The room

was</B>
<P><B>always cold, and if you tried to leve the door open, less than five

minutes</B>
<P><B>later the door would slam shut! I though that it was because there
was a</B>
<P><B>window open, but the window was closed! The first time the ghost talked

to</B>
<P><B>me I was petrified. It was late at night, and I was asleep in my

room,</B>
<P><B>which was right next to the room.  I heard a voice call my name, but

it</B>
<P><B>wasn't wavy like in the movies, it was solid, and it almost sounded
like my</B>
<P><B>dad. The voice called to me three times then I called to my mom and
said to</B>
<P><B>her "Mom tell dad to stop it" her answer was "Jenn, dad is at work."

I</B>
<P><B>thought that my mind was playing tricks on me, until the voice called
to me</B>
<P><B>again. I looked up, and there was nothing. After that night the

mysterious</B>
<P><B>"person" visited me daily. I would sit in my room and talk to him for</B>
<P><B>hours. He told me that his name was Allen, and that he had lived in

the</B>
<P><B>house before we moved in there. When I asked him where he was, he

would</B>
<P><B>tell me that he was right beside me! I'd look there, and would see

nothing.</B>
<P><B>One day I asked him how, and where he died he told me that he died
in the</B>
<P><B>room that was always cold, and that he died from a drug overdose. This

made</B>
<P><B>me cry, I asked him why, and this time he wouldn't tell me the answer.

He</B>
<P><B>said that he didn't know why. He told me to never try drugs or

anything</B>
<P><B>like that. That was the last time I talked to him. After I told my
mom all</B>
<P><B>of this she told me that before we had moved in the land lord told

them</B>
<P><B>that his son had died in the back room from a drug overdose!! </B>
<P><B>You can choose to belive this, or not, but I know what I heard. This

isn't</B>
<P><B>a fantasy that I made up while I was writing. This experience has made

me</B>
<P><B>look at life differently. I wish that I had more proof to make others</B>
<P><B>belive, but my words will have to do for now.   </B>

<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I never thought I would be telling this story to a GHOST  web sight
but I </B>
<P><B>feel  it should be told . About five years ago I was a full time nanny
for </B>
<P><B>two small children ages 3 yrs &amp;  5 months . </B>
<P><B>  One day early in the afternoon the  children's aunt called to tell
 her </B>
<P><B>sister their </B>
<P><B>father ( the children's grandfather ) had suddenly and quite unexpectedly

</B>
<P><B>passed away. I took the message and called my boss at work to tell
her the sad </B>
<P><B>news of her father's passing . She came home from work and  plans were
made </B>
<P><B>for the family to travel to Arizona  to attened the wake and funeral
. They </B>
<P><B>stayed for two weeks, when they returned and I went back to work they
asked me </B>
<P><B>not to speak of the death so as not to scare the little boy . I agreed
and </B>
<P><B>nothing was said of the death or of  the grandfather there after .</B>
<P><B>   About a week or so went by and nothing seemed abnormal , until the
rainy </B>
<P><B>stormy day that this  occourance happened . I had  both children in
the </B>
<P><B>kitchen eating lunch </B>
<P><B>the little boy  was sitting opposite me looking onto the back porch
 I had </B>
<P><B>opened the back doors to listen to the storm moving in . I was facing
him </B>
<P><B>holding the baby waiting for  her to finish her bottle and he to finish
his </B>
<P><B>lunch . It was raining pretty hard  and he was fasinated by the storm
. I </B>
<P><B>asked him to hurry and finish his lunch so he could  lay down for his
nap . </B>
<P><B>He looked at me and said " shhh , don't you see him ?"  I thought he
was </B>
<P><B>talking about the bunny we had seen  earlier in the yard </B>
<P><B>that day . I told him " no, I don't see the bunny ,  it's raining 
the bunny </B>
<P><B>is sleeping </B>
<P><B>now" . He looked at me again and said " no . I  mean grandpa  he's
standing </B>
<P><B>on the stairs . "  It chilled me to the bone when he said this , he
was </B>
<P><B>perfectly fine with the fact that grandpa was on the porch . He then
told me </B>
<P><B>that grandpa had been there </B>
<P><B>before to watch him when it was scary and stormy .                
           </B>
<P><B>                            </B>
<P><B>      I no longer work for the family but I believe  grandpa came back
to see </B>
<P><B>the little     </B>

<P>
<P><B>Greetings, First I just wish to say that </B>
<P><B>your site has to be the best that I have ever seen!!!!!!A friend of
mine and his son moved a </B>
<P><B>1770's log country Inn and attatched it to his home in Pittsburgh,
PA. I </B>
<P><B>stayed at the home a few night and had a few strange occurences. First,

</B>
<P><B>while sleeping on the 2nd floor and having turned off all of the lights,
an </B>
<P><B>upstairs light kept going on then going off. The stairs to the loft
are </B>
<P><B>open so you can see if the lights turn on.</B>
<P><B> In the early morning I took some </B>
<P><B>photographs as my friend is a military collector, artist and living

historian he </B>
<P><B>has life sized figures dressed in historical garb. When I deveoloped
the </B>
<P><B>photo's I saw what looked like an orb what you refer to as globule.
It had </B>
<P><B>the sensation of movement.In a second photo it was not as clear but
</B>
<P><B>present. Jokingly I sent the photo to my friend who called and told
me </B>
<P><B>that he had an almost matching photo taken in the modern part of his
home by I </B>
<P><B>believe his sister in law. My friend is highly artistic and </B>
<P><B>psychic. He has also had his share of sadness. His son died of </B>
<P><B>cancer and a son in law committed suicide...both not in the home. However

</B>
<P><B>his daughter and children now live with him. He consulted a psychic
and was told </B>
<P><B>that the orb in the photo was in fact an older German woman whom had
nursed her </B>
<P><B>dying husband in the house. She cleans and looks after his grandchildren

</B>
<P><B>and daughter. He was told that she/ the spirit was attracted to him
and </B>
<P><B>his grandson.</B>
<P><B> Friends from N.J. stayed in the </B>
<P><B>house and reported hearing labored breathing and heavy footsteps going
up and </B>
<P><B>down the nearrow staircase. Just also for the record....I am a </B>
<P><B>volunteer historic interpretor at Old Fort Niagara, one of the haunted

sites </B>
<P><B>that you mentioned. I have spent the night on several occassions but
have </B>
<P><B>not felt anything of yet...although never in the french castle. If
you </B>
<P><B>ever wish to have more info on the fort please let me know as I do
a lot of </B>

</H3><P><B>By: SK8er1209@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>	My three girlfriends and I decided to be roomys together and split
 </B>
<P><B>payment on and old house in Kansas. The house was very old and run
down(and </B>
<P><B>cheap) so we decided to  buy it and fix it up. about a few weeks after

</B>
<P><B>settling down one of my friends, Susan, reported hearing heavy footsteps(

</B>
<P><B>Like heavy boots)  above her room. To investigate, I traded rooms with
her </B>
<P><B>for a night. As she had told I heard the heavy footsteps pacing back
and </B>
<P><B>fourth above me. I explored the room above me witch was the attic and
found </B>
<P><B>no sign of any paranormal activity. But the pacing continued more </B>
<P><B>sporadically as time passed. Other things began to occur, such as both
the </B>
<P><B>front door and back door screens woud slam shut with the the solid
doors </B>
<P><B>closed. My other two room mates reported seeing a shadow of a man through

the </B>
<P><B>corner of their eyes.My bed would tremble and my windows would rattle.
My </B>
<P><B>other room mate Caire was the one who was mostly afraid of these strange

</B>
<P><B>activitys so she got a huge doberman. One day as the dog lay snoozing
on the </B>
<P><B>hard wood floor, I heard him yelp and saw him come flying across the
wood </B>
<P><B>floor!! Dana was none the least bit frightened of these happenings
and </B>
<P><B>believed the "ghost" was her dead sister.She told us that at night
the </B>
<P><B>rocking chair in her room would rock back and forth. We all had had
enough of </B>
<P><B>the huose and decided to move out. A week before we moved out we were

sitting </B>
<P><B>in the living room watching TV when we a loud clattering and clashing.
We all </B>
<P><B>turned to look in the hall and saw change falling from the ceiling.
We </B>
<P><B>decided to call a phsycic and see what was happening and why. she told
us </B>
<P><B>that this house was very dangerous and should not be lived in alone.
Dana did </B>
<P><B>not believe her and insisted on staying(because she believed the ghost
was </B>
<P><B>her dead sister). All of us high tailed it out of there while Dana
had to </B>
<P><B>have someone stay with her. That was the end of are rooming together
and I </B>
<P><B>moved to San Diego. I still have one more experience to tell you .
I had a </B>
<P><B>boyfriend and he lived in a very big house that was so big they had
turned it </B>
<P><B>into an apartment complex.  The </B>
<P><B>heaters would clank and rattling. I finally asked him what it was and
he told </B>
<P><B>me that it was his ghost. He said that the ghost appeared one night
in his </B>
<P><B>closet hanging by a rope. Apparently the ghost had hung himself. My

boyfriend </B>
<P><B>told me that if i were ever to come in contact with it that I should
not run </B>
<P><B>away but stare it down and show it that I am not scared of it.(As you
have </B>
<P><B>read you know I have had my experience with ghosts) One Day I was going
to his </B>
<P><B>apartment when on the wall a black figure started to appear. The figure

</B>
<P><B>turned into more of a short man but shadow like,about 4'11(AND NO IT
WAS NOT </B>
<P><B>MY SHADOW) I just held my ground and it slowly disapeared. I hope you
have </B>
<P><B>enjoyed tales as they are true and that my writing may not seem to
good for I </B>
<P><B>have written this in too much of a hurry.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: CloneDil49@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thirty years ago when I attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, I
lived in </B>
<P><B>off-campus housing....a turn-of-the-century duplex two blocks from
a large, </B>
<P><B>inter-city graveyard, which dated to the Revolutionary War.   I shared
my </B>
<P><B>bedroom with another female - she took the double bed in the middle
of the </B>
<P><B>room and I slept on single-wide</B>
<P><B>daybed located in front of makeshift closet by the wall.  We were on
the </B>
<P><B>second floor.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Not long after we moved in did she experience night-mares whereupon
she would </B>
<P><B>wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the closet.  I, on
the other </B>
<P><B>hand, experienced "cold spots" on my feet and which gradually spread
up my </B>
<P><B>torso as I lay down.  I was afraid to look at the closet.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several of my friends were "into the occult"; I invited one in particular

</B>
<P><B>over to help me solve the situation.  His name was Bill.  We spent
hours one </B>
<P><B>evening  in an attempt to  open my mind and accept the appartion, which
I </B>
<P><B>did.  My roommate was gone for the evening , so I reclined on the edge
of her </B>
<P><B>bed that was closest to the closet.; Bill reclined on my daybed.  We
waited </B>
<P><B>in the dark. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Not long after, the upper half  of a torso appeared "peeking" through
the  </B>
<P><B>closet. It appeared to be a male with a moustache and wearing a vest.
 The </B>
<P><B>apparition reclined on the daybed over Bill...Moments later, it seemed
to sit </B>
<P><B>up!  Then it reclined again.In an upright position it seemed to  float
back </B>
<P><B>into the closet, where it seemed to play "peek-a-boo" with me.  I closed
my </B>
<P><B>eyes, having accepted what I had seen.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next day Bill recounted that he had experienced the cold spots
and I told </B>
<P><B>him what I had seen.  Several evenings later when we were sitting in
the </B>
<P><B>bedroom-turned living room, Bill and I together saw our ghost.   Bill
said </B>
<P><B>that he was standing in the doorway of the room; actually the ghost
was </B>
<P><B>leaning on the doorway with his arms folded.   Bill  went over to the

doorway </B>
<P><B>and assumed the same position as the spirit;this confirmed that Bill
and I </B>
<P><B>saw the same being.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Years later, I had an unusual dream that I had astro-projected to Athens,

</B>
<P><B>Ohio.  My spirit guide, a unknown female,  warned me never to research
my </B>
<P><B>ghost.    And I haven't.</B>

another </B>
<P><B>ghost story to your site.  To some it may sound like a hoax,but if
you were </B>
<P><B>me and saw and heard what I did when I was younger...then you'd beleive

me.</B>
<P><B>     When I was about 8 or 9,I was in my room sleeping when I heard
the </B>
<P><B>microwaves' buttons being pushed. First thing I thought was that it
was my </B>
<P><B>mom getting a snack and warming it up so I thought nothing of it and
I went </B>
<P><B>back to sleep. well the next night I heard the same thing and I went
out to </B>
<P><B>the kitchen to check it out. When I got there I saw some kind of misty,

thick, </B>
<P><B>yet vaugely humanoid looking object. Well being about 8 or 9, I yelled
and </B>
<P><B>then ran into my younger brothers room (it being the closest room around)

and </B>
<P><B>hid under the covers. While hiding I felt something grab ahold of my
leg and </B>
<P><B>try to drag me out but I froze and it let go. The next morning, I told
my mom </B>

<P><B>Infact most the stories were hear say and I had only one friend that</B>
<P><B>swore up and down the he had seen on more then one occasion. So

another</B>
<P><B>friend and I decided that we would go and investagate. Since the park</B>
<P><B>closed at midnight we had to park my car across the street. I was

never</B>
<P><B>prepared for what we saw that night. we were in my car laughing and</B>
<P><B>making jokes about the whole situtation and really wondering why we</B>
<P><B>actually were in a parked car waiting to see a ghost that was supposed

to</B>
<P><B>roam the park at night. All the sudden I got this uncomforting

feeling</B>
<P><B>in my gut. I looked straight  ahead and saw what looked be a young</B>
<P><B>women. Walking around the park. she was wearing a long white dress

that</B>
<P><B>had some what of a train on it. she had long brown hair and a strange</B>
<P><B>glow that made every thing around her light up. I then  started to

cry.</B>
<P><B>I am not sure why I cried. I dont think it was out of fright. Because

to</B>
<P><B>be honest did not feel frightened. I just felt a feeling of sadness

come</B>
<P><B>over me. I wanted to look up the history of that park but I soon

moved</B>
<P><B>and never got the chance.</B>

<P><B> I just don`t understand this,but here go's.  One night I was</B>
<P><B>sleeping,and I woke like someone was watching me.  I turned over,and

this</B>
<P><B>black figure was coming toward me.  I put the covers over my head.and

I</B>
<P><B>was scared to death,yes I slept with the covers on my head all night.

 I</B>
<P><B>was afraid that I might see it again.  I was going to bed again,but
I was</B>
<P><B>watching tv,but I fell a sleep.  So I woke up,and turn the tv off,and

went</B>
<P><B>back to sleep,but I got this feeling someone was watching me.  I opened

my</B>
<P><B>eyes.  I felt scared,so I went back to sleep.  It took me a while to

get</B>
<P><B>back to sleep,but I did.Well the next morning I was laying in the</B>
<P><B>bed,and I felt someone lay beside me,I looked around and it was no

one</B>
<P><B>around,that is really scary,and it still bothering me,and it still

doing</B>
<P><B>it. Yes, I put my dog to sleep,and he always slept with me.Thanks for</B>
<P><B>listening to my story. </B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>This is something that happened to my mother one night a couple of</B>
<P><B>years ago.  First of all, my mother does not believe in ghosts.  She</B>
<P><B>has told me a couple of ghost stories that she has heard over the</B>
<P><B>years, but it was mainly for a laugh at the expense of the poor naive</B>
<P><B>soul (bad pun--sorry) who was the source of the stories.  Even though</B>
<P><B>my father passed away years ago, she had not had any supernatural</B>
<P><B>experiences (until that night), and neither have I for that matter.
</B>
<P><B>She has never been one to scare easily, her imagination does not run</B>
<P><B>away with her, and she looks for the logical explaination to</B>
<P><B>EVERYTHING.  This is partly why the following incident scared me so</B>
<P><B>much.  </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>A little background info on my mom and me and the night this incident</B>
<P><B>occurred, to maybe better set the scene:  One Saturday night, I was</B>
<P><B>getting ready to go out dancing with my friend Irene.  We love to go</B>
<P><B>dancing on the weekends, but being an only child and coming from a

VERY</B>
<P><B>strict Greek background, my overprotective mother hates the idea of

my</B>
<P><B>being out late at night (late to her is past 9 p.m).  Therefore,</B>
<P><B>everytime I go out in the evenings (or any time for that matter) she</B>
<P><B>always warns me (endlessly) to be careful of the muggers/drunk</B>
<P><B>drivers/theives/rapists etc. that are out there. (I'm 27 years old
by</B>
<P><B>the way, and at the time I was 25).  My response is usually silence

as</B>
<P><B>I try to ignore her and hurry up and get out of the house to escape

her</B>
<P><B>nagging.  </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>On this particular night, I was leaving the house fairly late, and
as I</B>
<P><B>was grabbing my coat &amp; keys, my mother warned me (for the 58th

time</B>
<P><B>that night) not to come home late.  She said, and I quote, "Try to

tear</B>
<P><B>those dancing feet away from the floor at a decent hour, will you?"

 To</B>
<P><B>which I replied somthing to the effect of "Yeah, sure".  </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Well, Irene and I had a great time that night.  We went to our

favorite</B>
<P><B>Italian restaurant and then went straight to the club for some

serious</B>
<P><B>dancing.  Later that night, I looked at my watch and it was 1:15 a.m.

</B>
<P><B>Irene saw me looking at my watch and asked if I wanted to get going.

 I</B>
<P><B>said no, and we ended up leaving at about 3:00 am.  When I got home,

it</B>
<P><B>was about 3:30 in the morning and my mother was waiting up for me.

 She</B>
<P><B>asked me if I had come home that night and gone out again.  I told

her</B>
<P><B>no.  She then proceeded to tell me what happened to her just a few</B>
<P><B>hours before I got home.  We live in a very small apartment, and in

the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night, the slightest noise is very audible.  As I said</B>
<P><B>before, my mother is quite overprotective and she is a light sleeper</B>
<P><B>and typically hears me come in at night and makes note of the time
I</B>
<P><B>come in so she can lecture me the next morning.  Well on that night,

my</B>
<P><B>mother heard the back door open and heard me walk through the house,</B>
<P><B>setting my keys and purse down, taking off my coat etc.  She looked

at</B>
<P><B>the digital clock next to her bed and it was 1:15 (the same time I</B>
<P><B>looked at my watch at the club).  She lay back down on her side,

facing</B>
<P><B>the wall when she heard me come into her bedroom.  Now this is

strange</B>
<P><B>in itself because I try to sneak in the house,</B>
<P><B>trying to make as little noise as possible so that she won't hear me</B>
<P><B>come in.  I would certainly NOT go to her room and make my presence</B>
<P><B>known.  Anyway, she said I came into the room, but she did not turn

on</B>
<P><B>the light or turn over to look at me (or whoever it was that came

into</B>
<P><B>her room).  She commented sarcastically that she was suprised I came</B>
<P><B>home so early.  And apparently the thing in her room answered her (in</B>
<P><B>my voice), "Well didn't you tell me to 'try and tear my dancing feet</B>
<P><B>away from the floor at a decent hour?'"  You'll notice that this is</B>
<P><B>exactly what she said to me before I left that night.  As if that</B>
<P><B>wasn't bad enough, whatever was in the room with her leaned over and</B>
<P><B>kissed her on the cheek and walked out of the room.  My mother still</B>
<P><B>did not think anything of this.  She thought I would go to the

bathroom</B>
<P><B>to take of my makeup and get ready for bed.  In a few minutes,

however,</B>
<P><B>the house was completely quiet.  She did not hear any footsteps or

any</B>
<P><B>water running (the bathroom is right next to her room).  After a

while</B>
<P><B>she got out of bed looking for me.  I wasn't anywhere in the house.
</B>
<P><B>Not a trace of me.  From that moment on, she sat up in bed reading,</B>
<P><B>waiting  for me to get home, which is how I found her when I finally</B>
<P><B>did get home.  When she told me this story I was afraid to go to

sleep</B>
<P><B>in my room -- or to stay in the house, for that matter (I admit it
--</B>
<P><B>I"m a chicken --  a rather  big chicken sometimes).  When I finally

did</B>
<P><B>got to bed, it was all I could do to keep from pulling the covers

over</B>
<P><B>my head, so that whatever kissed my mother wouldn't try to kiss me</B>
<P><B>(because I knew that if that had happened to me, I would have gone

into</B>
<P><B>cardiac arrest for sure).  So to this day, I still wonder what that</B>
<P><B>thing was that came into my mother's room, repeated in my voice part

of</B>
<P><B>a conversation we had had earlier that night (reminds me of the movie</B>
<P><B>"The Exorcist" when the devil is speaking to the young priest   in

his</B>
<P><B>mother's voice).  And it actually KISSED my mother.  What would she</B>
<P><B>have seen if she had turned around?  Why was it there in the first</B>
<P><B>place?  Was it a huge coincidence that I looked at my watch at the

same</B>
<P><B>time my mother looked at her clock?  Was it a doppelganger?  Do I</B>
<P><B>really want to know????</B>
