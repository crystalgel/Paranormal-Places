<p><b>The Ghost Who Called 911</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: scooter2156@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello. my name is marla rogge.I would like to share with you a true
expierience i had quite a few years ago. When my three children were around
the ages of 14,13,and 9,we lived in a old farm house in reno county. The
house actually was right on the rice county /reno county line. My boyfriend
glenn was an oilfield driller,so he was gone from the hours of 3p -11p.
Anyway one night as we were watching a video we had rented,there came a
knock at our front door.I got up and answered it. To my surprise there
stood in front of me 2 reno county cops. They ask me "What is your emergency"?
And i said excuse me but i have no emergency. The officers went on to explain
that they had received an emergency request from this address. I told the
officers we had not called 911. They said ok,we are sorry we bothered you,and
they then left. The kids and i continued&nbsp; the movie,low and behold
around 20 minutes later,there was another knock at the door. When i answered
the door,it was again the reno county cops. They said mam we received another
911 call from this address saying you had an emergency. I politely exained
to the officers that none of us had even left our chairs to go in the kitchen
and make a call. The one officer said mam are you sure no one made a call
from this house ? And i said no ,no one has left this here room to make
a call.&nbsp; So again they leave. we started our movie once more feeling
a little frustrated. No longer do we get comfortable&nbsp; and just start
to enjo our movie ,would you believe it ? Yes thats right another knock
at the door. Igot up and answered it and yes it was the reno county cops
again. They said that they had received yet anothr 911 call from this residence.
By now they are more than upset,they went on to tell me that to abuse the
911 systum is unexcusable and that if they had to come back again they
were going to take me to jail. I stood up and leaned on the wall that connects
to the dining room .I told the officers that none of my children or i had
even left the room to make any phone calls. As im leaning on the wall,an
officer ask . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me to move away from the wall so
i did. H thought that someone was holding mastig.exuse me i mean hostage.i
moved away so he could see that i was not being held hostage. by now these
here officers have had enough and so had i. as they are redy to leave they
again told me that if they received just 1 more phone call from 911 from
this sddress they were going to take me to jail. I was so scared i would
surely go to jail that night . But the officers left and it quit thank
god. Here just a few weeks ago a friend of mine was telling me about this
farmer whom lives there in that same house had the same thing happen to
him only it only called 911 once on him . but what is weird is he had no
phone ,he had just happened to have his mothers cell phone in his pocket.
he said he was up in his bedroom,when suddenly he hears a female voice
yelling to him to answer the phone in a very gruff voice .Well this guy
looks around like what did i just hear? He continued to look for the papers
he was looking for when the voice yelled really loud and said "answer the
phone i said!" he looks down at his shirt pocket and thought well it has
got to be coming from his mothess cell phone. So he picks it up and answerd
it . It was a gruff lady she said what is your emergency? He told the lady
that he had no emergency and he did not know what she was talking about.
She said well we received a 911 call from tyh residence saying that you
had an emergency. He kindly told her no he had no emergency. so that was
the only timehe had that happen ,but it is the same house we lived in when
it happened to us.i do not even know this guy other than a breif meeting
with him in my drive way. I would like to have some feedback from anyone
who has maybe had this type of expierience. please e-mail me and tell me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Park</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bryanbohru@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>The town I grew up in had a small park located just across the street
from railroad tracks, on a little triangle of green, surrounded by homes.
The park had a small sandbox area, monkey bars, a see-saw, and a swingset,
with a few trees and bushes along the side that bordered the street across
from the tracks, nothing very elaborate. There was a story all the kids
in the town knew about a boy of about 8 or so who was killed on the tracks
in the 70s cutting across them to go home after playing in the park. He
had waited for a freight train to pass but evidently didn't see a speeding
passenger train coming the other way. Unfortunately, the group of kids
who'd just been playing with the boy in the park witnessed the accident.
(Ever since I'd lived there, there had been tall chain link fences along
the tracks, along with big thorny shrubs planted in front of them). The
park was also rumored to be haunted by the dead boy's ghost, and therefore,
I remember my friends and I avoided the park when it was empty or getting
dark out. Even in high school, there were tales of the swings swinging
back and forth on windless days, of footprints appearing in the sand, and
of a little kid's giggling from the bushes behind the swingset when nobody
was around.</b>
<br><b>That being said, while I personally never had anything out of the
ordinary happen to me the couple of times I went to the park (never alone),
my former neighbor Brian told me about something that happened to him and
a couple of his buddies there while he was a freshman in high school one
night. Brian and his buddies were goofing around in the park, doing stupid
things like standing on the middle of the see-saw and making one end or
the other bang into the ground, or climbing to the top of the monkey bars
and jumping into the sand area. One of the guys was about to fling one
of the swings around the top bar of the swingset when all of a sudden he
shouted out a swear word, and began backing away from the swingset. Brian
and his friends said the swing next to the one the guy began to swing faster
and faster back and forth for a few seconds, then suddenly stop. Brian
said he also could've sworn he saw something white and glowing shoot through
the bushes behind the swingset and disappear as it neared the street. Brian
told me that they left the park very quickly after that.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;The Private School Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jerod_pack@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I went to the same private school for two of my middle school years
and then all four of my high school years, and there were stories here
and there that the campus was possibly haunted, but nothing really noteworthy.&nbsp;
Gossip never really blossomed into more than small talk about how late
night employees may have seen a little girl roaming some of the halls at
night, and me being me, I was hoping that I would see something of the
sort during my time attending the school.</b>
<br><b>The campus consists of several buildings: the lower (elementary),
middle, and upper (high) schools, the performing arts center, the mansion,
and various athletic gyms, among a few other miscellaneous buildings containing
classrooms or maintenence equipment.&nbsp; It was known by many of the
students that the schoolground used to be a plantation, and the mansion
was probably the sole building in existence at this time.&nbsp; It was
just like your average mansion....large with an abundance of windows and
a lot of open space on the inside.&nbsp; I remember the first floor would
creak with its wooden boards in some places when walked on, but after being
at the school for so long that sound would feel commonplace.</b>
<br><b>To the best of my knowledge, it seemed that&nbsp; the few times
she was "seen," the spirit of the little girl would stay around the upper
school and the mansion based on the few "shaky" accounts by employees,
so when I began working in the mansion I started to keep my eyes peeled
for anything suspicious...I wanted to see a ghost if there was one.&nbsp;
I worked on the first floor at the secre ry desk answering calls, right
at the bottom of the grand staircase that led to the upper landings.&nbsp;
After a certain time in the evening, I would be left alone in the mansion
as all the daytime workers went home, and sometimes this would be a nerve-racking
experience.&nbsp; Many nights I would nervously anticipate catching a glimpse
of some human-shaped vapor gliding down the stairway toward me or past
me and into some other portion of the mansion.&nbsp; This never happened.&nbsp;
I remember hearing from one or so employees that supposedly the attic was
the place to see a ghost if there even were any (I wish I could have spent
the night up there), but I never really got the chance to check it out.&nbsp;
I'd asked a couple of employees who worked in the mansion a good while
if they had ever seen anything weird, and they hadn't.&nbsp; Sometimes
I would hear noises, but I'm convinced that it was just the house creaking&nbsp;
and settling because they weren't too unusual. I heard some office supples
shuffle around on the second floor on one occasion, but again I'm convinced
that it was just gravity doing what it does.&nbsp; One thing I am unsure
about though is what sounded like footsteps in the uppermost portion of
the house one evening.&nbsp; Whatever the case, they were heavy footsteps
and had at least one second of silence in between them, and were certainly
not those of a young girl.&nbsp; There were only 4 or 5, and again this
sound could have been ANYTHING, because who knows what types of sounds
that old mansion is capable of making.</b>
<br><b>Although the previous accounts are inconclusive when it comes to
paranormal activity, what happened months later is an incident that I absolutely
CANNOT explain.&nbsp; My brother and I arrived to the upper school just
about the same time my good friend did, and it was about 7:30AM.&nbsp;
The three of us entered the school and made our way to the library, which
was where a lot of people hung out before homeroom because there were magazines
and computers.&nbsp; However this early, no one had made it to school yet
so we were alone in the library.&nbsp; My brother and my friend retired
to the far corner of the library to read some of the magazines, and I walked
over to the table where the computers were.&nbsp; There was a long office
window here, and a door to the right of it which permitted one to enter
the office.&nbsp; The office lights were out, and when I approached the
table I noticed that the dark office behind the glass and the sufficiently
lit library created a mirror effect, and I could see the rest of the library
behind me, which is only about 40 feet back.&nbsp; There were three study
desks with chairs on both sides up against the wall, and I could see the
alternate entrance/exit to the library and the bookcases to the side of
it.&nbsp; I could not see into the office.&nbsp; Bored and not wanting
to be at school, I stood at the table with my palms rested on it, staring
at slightly downward.&nbsp; After about five seconds, I noticed some movement
in the top of my vision where the office window was creating the window
effect and allowing me to see behind myself.&nbsp; Curious, I raised my
head and saw what I can't even begin to explain to myself today, some 5
years later.</b>
<br><b>What I saw was not a young girl, but a high school boy, clothed
in the dresscode that we had to abide by - khaki pants, button down shirt,
a tie, and formal footwea&nbsp;&nbsp; He was getting up from one of the
study desks on the far end of the library, and then continued to push in
his chair.&nbsp; At this point he turned to completely face me and looked
directly at me (which would have been like looking at my back from his
point of view, unless he was watching my face in the mirror), standing
in place.&nbsp; He then moved his hand to the knot in his tie and adjusted
it, moving it left and right in one smooth motion like you see James Bond
do in some of those movies.&nbsp; After this he turned and began heading
toward the exit of the library, and at this point I was so baffled that
I whipped around to try and see if he was actually there before he could
get to the door, but there was nothing.&nbsp; And even if he had reached
the door, he would have had to open it and walk around the corner which
would have taken at least another 2-3 seconds, and not to mention that
that was one of the loudest doors in the school, but no sound occurred
either way.&nbsp; I went and inspected that end of the library to see if
me, my brother and my friend had been unknowingly joined by someone else
who came in early, but after doing that and asking my friend if we were
alone all I got was a "yea," and a "what are you on?"&nbsp; My brother
and friend's views were blocked by bookshelves from that end of the library
so even if there was something visible, it was not to them.&nbsp; When
I was looking around, I was trying to feel if that end of the library felt
cooler than any other part, but I couldn't really tell any difference.&nbsp;
I wish I could see if taking pictures at that time turned up orbs or mist.&nbsp;
I think that was in 11th grade, and I haven't seen anything peculiar since
then.</b>
<br><b>Compared to other ghost accounts I've read this one isn't too eventful
or anything, but I ask myself WHY did HE want ME to see him? WHY did HE
look at ME?&nbsp; Another thing I wonder about is his interaction with
the environment.&nbsp; The fact that I saw him push in his chair makes
me wonder if the chair moved in reality behind me, or if it was just a
manipulation of this spirit's energy depicted in the simulated mirror??
I have a feeling that the chair didn't actually move in the library, and
was just depicted that way. Was the refracted light on the simulated mirror
of the office window enough for me to see the spirit in the reflection,
much like a camera does? And that's why I couldn't see him with the naked
eye?? These are questions that I'd like to get answered, but time may never
tell</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Ghost Story of my Grandpa</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: database@idm.net.lb</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Simone.&nbsp; I do have a ghost story but it is
not as freeky and spine tingling as you would expect to hear.&nbsp; However,
it is not from my own experience but rather from my mother's.&nbsp; The
story happened when I was just one and three months, my mother recalls
as she was explaining it to me one afternoon in the car when we were driving
to pick up some hamburgurs.</b>
<br><b>She says that my grampa (my dad's father) showed great love toward
me---me being his first grandchild.&nbsp; When my sister was born one year
after my birth, my grampa was sitting down in the family room watching
televion and my dad at work and my mom and gramma cooking in the kitchen.&nbsp;
All of a sudden, my grampa collapsed and started whining.&nbsp; My mom
went downstairs to see what had happened and it turns out he was having
a heart attack.&nbsp; To make a long story short, he died in her arms in
the emergency room.&nbsp; Even though he loved his only son very much,
my grampa had a special connection with my mom.</b>
<br><b>Moving on, one night around two a.m. in the morning, three months
after my grampa died, my mom and dad awoke to hear a burgerler alarm go
off in the house.&nbsp; They ran downstairs to see what was going on.&nbsp;
Now in the family room where my grampa had collapsed, there was a window
that would never open.&nbsp; It was always barred shut and no matter how
much my dad tried with his muscles, he could never get it open. Guess what?&nbsp;
Turns out that that window had been opened allll the way up causing the
alarm to go off.&nbsp; My mom closed it and they went back upatairs to
bed.&nbsp; The next night the alarm went off once more.&nbsp; This time
only my mom went down to close that window.&nbsp; It occured once more
the next night.&nbsp; My mom opened the conversation with my dad and gramma
about ghost hauntings of my grampa.&nbsp; my dad and gramma were skeptical
about the supernatural so they disagreed with my mom and closed the subject.&nbsp;
She decided to avoid it too becuase it was a sensitive subject because
he had only recently died. On the fourth night my mom woke up with the
alarm ONCE MORE. She went downstairs, closed the window, and turned off
the alarm.&nbsp; She walked to her room, but stopped.&nbsp; She had a gut
feeling she should check on me and my sister.&nbsp; So she walked in and
saw us sound asleep.&nbsp; She continued her check into my gramma's room
which overlooks the street.&nbsp; She saw her sleeping.&nbsp; However,
her window was open, so she went to close it.&nbsp; As she reached the
window, she got a glimse of my grampa.&nbsp; He was a solid-looking figure
(just like a normal person) wearing the clothes that he had died in.&nbsp;
She stared at him and he smiled and started crying.&nbsp; They stared into
each others eyes for about 10 full minutes.&nbsp; Then he turned around
and walked away down our street into a smoggy kind-of cloudy looking mist.</b>
<br><b>My mom tells me she believes he wanted to say good-bye to her and
that those clouds represent heaven---as if he had walked, in her eyesight,
right into heaven.&nbsp; I believe he's our gaurdian angel.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Me and My Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mjcullen@comcast.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start this off I moved into my house when i
was 6. not far from</b>
<br><b>my old one but about 30 min away. I live in basalt CO (near aspen).
My</b>
<br><b>story begins about&nbsp; a year after i moved in. I didn't totally
like the</b>
<br><b>house, I mean it was scary. It's not all that big, but scary. Anyways,</b>
<br><b>my first encounter with this ghost I couldn't tell (P.S I live near
a</b>
<br><b>graveyard, I mean I can see it out my window.)that&nbsp; It was
a ghost I</b>
<br><b>just thought it was weird. It happened in a dream. I dreamt it was
dawn</b>
<br><b>on this turn in a road in the middle of nowhere, me and my dad were
in</b>
<br><b>a car driving and I see something go across the road. Like a shadowy</b>
<br><b>figure. I woke up right after we turned. You might think man this
guy</b>
<br><b>is stupid , I mean this is stupid, it's just a dumb dream, but please</b>
<br><b>read the whole story. About a week later my dad took me on a road
trip.</b>
<br><b>about 2 days in at dawn my I saw this turn in the road, the same
on in</b>
<br><b>my dream, then I saw the shadowy figure. After the turn (when in
my</b>
<br><b>dream I woke up) I started FREAKING OUT I mean I was only like 8
years</b>
<br><b>old, and I didn't know about foresight or any thing like that. I
got</b>
<br><b>over it in like 5 min., and told my dad about the dream and he said</b>
<br><b>that he didn't see anything on the road, and it was all my imagination.</b>
<br><b>I forgot about it until about a year later, now i've been in my
little</b>
<br><b>brothers room for half a year. I have a new wooden bed&nbsp; and
2 plastic</b>
<br><b>containers next to it full of stuffed animals an some things on
top.</b>
<br><b>About 2:00 in the morning on a summer afternoon I woke up to a small</b>
<br><b>ball and a stuffed animal floating in midair obviously I was in
shock</b>
<br><b>they dropped in about 10 sec, but I was so scared I didn't move
for</b>
<br><b>about 3 min.. In the morning I was still freaked out from the night</b>
<br><b>before so I didn't feel like talking. I've only told about 2 people</b>
<br><b>about that incident. I also can kind of see who that was now, it
was my</b>
<br><b>dead little sister. she died in my mom and if she had lived I wouldn't</b>
<br><b>be living, but the connection from toys and my dead sister are kind
of</b>
<br><b>weird, and whenever I think of it I get this funny feeling. I got
over</b>
<br><b>it and decided it was all my mind, but about 1 month later me and
my</b>
<br><b>older brother couldn't find my dad ( around then my dad had been</b>
<br><b>working on our air conditioning in our really small attic, and just
to</b>
<br><b>keep us out of there my dad said if you go up there you will run
out of</b>
<br><b>air). So when I heard sounds up there me and my older brother went
to</b>
<br><b>go check. When I went up there no one was up there. We later found
out</b>
<br><b>that my dad was still sleeping. The incidents stopped until I was
11.</b>
<br><b>One night (now i am in my old room) I went inside my room and heard</b>
<br><b>this really scary ghost like moan. 1 second later I was out of my
room</b>
<br><b>running and freaking out. Now I'm 12 going on 13 and haven't&nbsp;
seen any</b>
<br><b>more things, but whenever a new friends spends the night in the
morning</b>
<br><b>they say what was that sound last night, and I know it's there but
I</b>
<br><b>guess I've just gotten useed to it.</b>

<p><b>My House...</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CuteD126@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>We were looking to rent a house and we came across a very very nice
one renting for a price that was right up our alley. So we applied and
got the house when we went to sign the lease we walked through the house
my son was terrified of the den and said that he did not like that room.
I just said OK and we left.&nbsp; The first night we moved there my boyfriend
had a dream about a little girl who was about 11 she told him that she
liked him and then after that he had sleep paraylsis (when you are awake
but cant move your body or speak at all) Every since that day i knew something
was not right.&nbsp; I work at night so he has told me that he has heard
footsteps and talking in the attic at night. He also says he hears noises
coming from the den. When me and my son are there alone i hear noises and
slams coming from the den and when i go look there's nothing there i got
so use to it that sometimes i didn't even bother to go look.&nbsp; I just
figured it would stop when it got ready. One day while watching TV my son
asked who is that and i said "who is who" and he said "Who is that in the
hall" when i looked up no one was there. Sometimes the&nbsp; AC is on when
neither one of us has turned it on and by the time we get there the house
is freezing. I have also seen a white mist float by one of the bedrooms
i just figured that i imagined it.&nbsp; Well, one night i came home my
son was sleep so i carried him to my room i proceeded to go out the door
and into his room and there was a tall black shadow of a person standing
face to face with me which vanished as soon as i saw&nbsp; him. I am terrified
of ghosts but for some reason i wasn't scared to enter the room after seeing
it. One night i went to the drive way to get something out the car my son
stood in the door and waited for me and as i turned to look back at the
house i saw a little black shadow no taller then my 3 year old run out
our front door and into the yard and vanish. My son didn't seem to notice
the shadow.&nbsp; When i told my boyfriend about it he cut me off mid sentence
and described the same black shadow i was seeing. He says he sees it all
the time standing in the hall or at our bedroom door. He didn't tell me
he was seeing it because he didn't want me to be scared. The scariest thing
that happen was when i came home and went to bed and then i had my own
sleep paralysis experience and when i tried to move my body i couldn't
but i heard footsteps coming down the hall towards my bedroom what ever
it was had a very STRONG presence and my back was facing the door.&nbsp;
At the same time i was seeing a little girl in front of me (could been
the same one my boyfriend saw) and she was trying to tell me something
about our front room but i was trying to scream but i couldn't move my
mouth the more i tried to scream, the angrier she got and her face turned
red and blue and she screamed too and then vanished. I finally woke up
but immediately fell back to sleep then when i tried to wake up and move
again i could feel someone standing on the side of the bed looking at me
I could feel it staring and its presence but i couldn't turn around and
see what it was. It looked at me for a while then i heard its footsteps
walk away when it left i could move again. No one was there but me and
my son and he still sleeps in his crib so it wasn't him cause he cant get
out!! Since that day i stay at my mom's house every single day until my
boyfriend gets home from work.&nbsp; I don't ever want to be alone in there
again eventhough the ghost or ghosts for the most part don't seem angry.</b>

Also my grandmother also told us that sometimes you can hear and see to
kids running and playing in the hall way.&nbsp; You can also see who we

<p><b>Ghosts around my Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: samimack60632@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Brittany and one day I was sitting in my back yard
talking to my boyfriend about ghosts and if we really have a soul. I looked
at a chair and saw someone sitting in it. Not even thinking I just kept
talking and I was looking at it for a minute. I looked back at my boyfriend
and my heart skipped a beat. I asked him if he saw what I saw he said yah.
We he said yes we ran out of my backyard so scared. Later on my sisters
power went out and she came to sleep over and I told her and her fiance.
Her fiance and I went outside and started taking pics. When the camera
flashed I saw a little girl hanging from the ceiling I was really scared
then I looked in the picture she was there and so was another guy walking
towards her. When I first heard of ghosts I was a little skeptical. After
that night I'll never be again.</b>

<br><b>Duendes at my In-laws House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AqaMKitty2@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Three years ago on January 2001.&nbsp; My husband and I, drove from
Houston, TX to Omaha, NE.&nbsp; To visit my in-laws.&nbsp; We arrived at
2 close to 3 in the morning.&nbsp; After a long drive I was tired, and
headed to bed.&nbsp; My husband and his parents headed on to the casino
at Council Bluffs, IA, a few minutes away on I-80.&nbsp; I stayed and went
to bed.&nbsp; I was 4 months pregnant at that time,&nbsp; as I drifted
off to sleep laughter of children awoke me.&nbsp; Not only laughter but
someone kept running around the bed and pressing on the mattress all this
happening at the same time.&nbsp; For a moment I thought it was my step
daughter, but I remembered that she was asleep with her aunt.&nbsp; I took
a look and it was little people called "Duendes," some are mischievous
and others are helpful.&nbsp; I got scared that night and started praying
they would go away, and they did.&nbsp; When my husband got home that same
morning, I told him and my in-laws what happened.&nbsp; They thought, I
was crazy.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second encounter with them was last year in
March 2003.&nbsp; My husband and in-laws went to the casino and I stayed
home with my step daughter.&nbsp; We fell asleep on the sofa in the living
room watching TV.&nbsp; Around 1 in the morning, I heard footsteps and
woke up only seeing a "Duende" quickly running to hide in the book shelf
by the sofa.&nbsp; When I looked at the book shelf and around the book
shelf, he wasn't there, nothing he was gone.&nbsp; I later called my mom
and told her about what was happening in the house.&nbsp; She told me to
go church and get holy water and spray it all over the house.&nbsp; A year
has passed and I haven't seen them since or heard them.&nbsp; As a child,
stories of "Duendes"(little people) were told to us by our parents to scare
us, so we kids could behave.&nbsp; Now, I really believe there are other
kinds of people who live with us without us knowing or being aware of it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Dad's Death</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My Dad died in unfortunate circumstances after a long illness. We
all went to see him in the intensive care unit before my stepmother pulled
the plug on his life support, because he was brain dead. As I sat in his
hospital room with several other people, I had what I can only describe
as a vision. The room disappeared and I could see Dad above me looking
down at me through what looked like, of all things, a dirty porthole. He
was moving around the 'porthole' and knocking on it like he was trying
to get my attention, then he smiled and told me "This is better." He said
something else which, I am sad to say, I don't recall exactly, except they
were comforting words, and repeated "This is better."</b>
<br><b>Suddenly I was back in the room with everybody. I was so surprised,
and quietly looked around at everybody to see if anyone else looked like
something surprising or profound had happened. No one did. I thought about
this for several months before mentioning it to my sister and she had not
seen or heard anything. My husband hadn't, either, but seemed to believe
me when I told him I had. I have wondered if I had a psychic experience
or if I conjured up a self comforting illusion because of the stressful
situation.</b>
<br><b>We were estranged from my stepmother after my father's death, and
had no contact with her whatsoever. A year and a half after my father died
my stepmother tried to commit suicide. She shot herself in the neck (yes,
the neck -- a psychologist friend of mine said she didn't want to damage
her pretty face) and lived as a quadriplegic for six months before she
died. She had insisted that we not be informed of what had happened or
of her condition until after her death.</b>
<br><b>A few really odd things happened around our house after her death,
but I don't know if the happenings are attributable to my stepmother or
have a totally mundane explanation. They have happened neither before nor
since.</b>
<br><b>Recently my husband had a dream about my stepmother. He told me
that, in his dream, he had climbed through a hole high up in a wall and
into a brightly lit room. My dead stepmother was sitting up in a bed of
white linens in a white nightgown and the room was bright and all white
(she had spent a good deal of time in bed and in night clothes in life).
She said hello to him and he woke up. I think he had the dream because
he is the one in the family most sympathetic to her. Anyway, he has had
no dreams about her since, so maybe she managed to end up in a happier
place than she found here.</b>

<br><b>Apartment Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aazari@ev1.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've lived in a few haunted places. I suppose it's because the SE
Texas area</b>
<br><b>is full of ghosts from various storms and such. The apartment I
currently</b>
<br><b>live in is haunted. The apartment complex is called Aston Brook
and it's</b>
<br><b>located on Walters Road, just off of 1960. We moved from one apartment
to</b>
<br><b>another inside the compex. The first apartment had no activity.
But from the</b>
<br><b>moment I stepped foot in the new apartment, I could feel there was
something</b>
<br><b>here. Since moving here, we've had items vanishing and reappearing,
objects</b>
<br><b>being thrown from shelves and that sort of activity. The cat is
often</b>
<br><b>restless at night, wandering the hall and yowling loudly. She has
only done</b>
<br><b>this in previous residences where there has been activity. Most
of the</b>
<br><b>activity seems to take place in what is my office and right outside
it in</b>
<br><b>the living area. There seems to be none in the bedroom as if they
are afraid</b>
<br><b>to go in there for some reason. The farthest they go into the bedroom
is the</b>
<br><b>doorway. Things hung on the over-door hanger will suddenly start
swaying. If</b>
<br><b>you stay "Stop playing with the clean clothes!" the movement will
stop. On</b>
<br><b>some photos of the pets we took we have found orbs. There seem to
be two</b>
<br><b>spirits here. They seem young... perhaps twin children as the orbs
we</b>
<br><b>spotted are linked together. They have even turned my computer on
a few</b>
<br><b>times when I was out of the room or not home. I've had them throw
things at</b>
<br><b>me from the shelves behind my desk. They seem pretty harmless for
the most</b>
<br><b>part and I'm rather accustomed to haunting phenomena since I've
lived in</b>
<br><b>four other haunted places and the home town where I grew up is full
of</b>
<br><b>wierdness. I guess after a while you get so used to it it's almost</b>
<br><b>entertaining to see what they'll do next to get your attention.
But there</b>
<br><b>were a couple of houses where the activity was pretty frightening.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Burn!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jettblac@iwon.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;This is from a friend I had when I was younger and she and
her mother were telling me ghost stories about a trailer they lived in
when my friend was 3 or 4 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; They moved into a trailer
in Dickinson, TX when my friend, Christie, was 3 or 4 years old. The only
thing that was in the trailer when they moved in was a red cape (looks
like Little Red Ridinghood's cape) hanging in Christie's closet. Well,
her mom thinking maybe Christie could fit it, left it there. So, they settled
in and Christie played in her room on the Hobby horse and her mom would
hear her talking but kids do jabber on. So she didn't think anything of
it. Well about 30 minutes later, she went to put Christie in the bath,
and there floating in mid-air was the red cape! Ok so they got rid of the
cape. About 2 days later, Christie's mom was taking her vitamins (she was
pregnant) in the kitchen and heard Psst, Psst, behind her and thinking
it was her husband yelled at him to cut it out. He told her he was in the
living room with Christie and what was she yelling at him for. She turned
around and there was the red cape again floating in the air. They burned
the cape, got a preist to come and bless the house, and (for some reason
I don't understand) put rice that was prayed over in the corners of the
house. Still the red</b>
<br><b>pe came back about 3 days later and kept floating, never tried to
hurt anyone but they had one baby and one on the way (who wouldn't be scared?).
So, they moved out of the house about 2 hours after the cape came back
with just enough clothes and toys to keep Christie occupied while they
looked for another home. About 3 hours after they left, the trailer burned.
No one (not the investigators, neighbors, anyone) could give them a clue
as to how it burned. While doing a background check on the property, Christie's
parents found that the trailer was on an indian burial ground. It started
at their trailer and went back for 10 acres. No one lived behind them only
about 2 acres in front. About 1 year later, someone else bought the property
and tried to build a house, everytime they got the outside framework done,
it would burn</b><b></b>

<p><b>Edward</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Minderoo@worldconnx.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had an entity that seemed to follow wherever we lived and it took
different forms through my life. When I was little it was a teenager when
I was a teenager it was a child. What scared me the most was that people
would describe him to me without me telling about his appearance.They would
see him I only seen him as a teenager but always felt his presence. My
t.v. would skip to selected channels. One night my friend and I seen my
brush being thrown with noone around it.&nbsp; My mother used to do practices
of a psychic since she was in high school and she had to print (still does).
Because a guide as she would call it would take over and write answers
to her or take over. Anyways he was called Edward. When I was older we
were joking w/ my friends in front of her saying the ghost was named Edward.
She acted as though a rock hit her in the face.&nbsp; Only one time she
showed me her writing in cusive My friend and I were asking questions.
The answers in the future turned out to be true. I called the little ghost
boy by a certain name and never really talked about it with my mom. It
turned out that was the guides name too.</b><b></b>

<br><b>First Apartment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: monikacouet@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story is real! In the summer of 2001 I moved from my parents
house and into my very first apartment. The place was really well kept
with absolutely nothing to spook anybody, even me! I felt really at ease
even though I lived there by myself. But about a month after I moved there,
I started hearing foot steps on the rug at night when everything was quiet.
At first I dind’t pay much attention to them but as the days passed they
became louder and louder, so much so that I couldn’t just say to myself
that they weren’t there! I started feeling a little uneasy in the apartment!
I spoke to my friends about it and they though I was nuts! So I decided
to have a couple of my girlfriends over for the night. We had a good time
watching T.V. and all but later in the evening, we had turned of everything
in the house and we were quietly chatting in the living room when all of
a sudden, the radio went of! Not just playing.. But playing really loud!
None of us were touching or even close to the radio! We started freaking
out but figured that it was probably just something explainable! Shortly
after that we went to bed. I let them have my bedroom because I knew that
was where I had heard the footsteps before!</b>
<br><b>I slept like a baby! For the first time in about a month I hadn’t
heard any noise at all while I slept! I got up the next morning and went
in my bedroom to see if my friends were up. They were alredy in the living
room. They had spent half the night there because they couldn’t sleep from
all the noises on the carpet, they told me they had also heard someone
or something going through the cubboards where I stored my food! Now this
I had never heard so it was becoming a little bit more scary and I am easily
scared! Even with everything that was going on, I still felt safe in the
apartment, so I wasn’t going anywhere! But neither was the ‘gost’!</b>
<br><b>A few weeks after the incident with my friends, I was slightly dozing
of in my bed when I heard something in my bedroom. I hopenned my eyes and
I saw a girl sitting on the floor right next to my bed. She was looking
at me, not saying anything. It was a though I couldn’t touch her or she
couldn’t touch me either. I just sat there and instead of feeling scared
out of my mind as I should probably have been, I felt calm and not scared
at all. I decide I should ask her what she was doing there and I did, she
smiled at me and then with a blink of an eye she had disapered! I never
knew who she was nor if she was real or just imagination. You’ll have to
decide! I moved out of the apartment not long after and a week and a half
after I moved out the whole building where I used to live burned down.
What a story eh? The best thing about is its true!</b>

<br><b>Florida Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: greatknowledge@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I just read your article on ghost stories that took place at Flagler
College in St. Augustine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended Flagler in the early l980's
and have several ghost stories to tell.</b>
<br><b>Once, I was alone in my dorm room (the former Ponce De Leon Hotel..now
the Flagler Dorm) and was laying in my bed.&nbsp; The room was dark and
I was just resting and not fully asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, my stereo
on the dresser bust on and played loudly.&nbsp; I know the stereo was completely
turned off and that I was totally alone when this incident happened.&nbsp;
Other students told me that footsteps could be heard in the ballroom of
the Ponce de Leon Hotel on the upper floor of the structure. At the time
the footsteps were heard,The ballroom had been closed for many years and
was being used for storage.&nbsp; A group of female students told me that
they were sitting in a dorm room one night, and suddenly there was a knocking
sound revolving around the room, going from wall to wall.&nbsp; It terrified
them and they started screaming.&nbsp; I believe the place is HAUNTED.&nbsp;
Rumors persist that Henry Flagler's second wife (who went insane) was sometimes
locked up on one of the upper floors of the hotel.&nbsp; But, I never heard
of any sightings of her.&nbsp; Let me know if any of my stories will be
included on your website.&nbsp; That would be great.&nbsp; Thanks your
great site.&nbsp; I will recommend it to others.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Spectral Guests</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: melpomene_blue@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>There are very few places I have lived that didn't</b>
<br><b>have what I've come to refer to as "spectral guests"</b>
<br><b>but no place has been so active as the old farmhouse</b>
<br><b>on Lakeside Drive in Liberty, Texas.&nbsp; Five members of</b>
<br><b>my family moved into the 1900's farmhouse several</b>
<br><b>years ago: my mother, aunt, nine-year-old cousin,</b>
<br><b>infant son and me.&nbsp; At first all was quiet but as time</b>
<br><b>progressed, we all began to experience things.&nbsp; Of</b>
<br><b>course, holding true to form, I was the first to</b>
<br><b>suspect anything.</b>
<br><b>We had converted the dining room into a den and I was</b>
<br><b>in the habit of rocking my son, who was about seven</b>
<br><b>months old at the time, to sleep while I watched</b>
<br><b>television in that room.&nbsp; Once he was asleep, I would</b>
<br><b>place him on an oversized floor pillow and turn off</b>
<br><b>the TV to read until he awoke.&nbsp; One day as I was</b>
<br><b>slowly rocking with him in my arms, I chanced to look</b>
<br><b>at an occasional table that was standing near the far</b>
<br><b>wall.&nbsp; Trystan, my son, had been munching on saltines</b>
<br><b>earlier that morning and the cracker package had been</b>
<br><b>left on that table.&nbsp; As I watched, the package of</b>
<br><b>crackers slowly turned clockwise so that it completed</b>
<br><b>a full circle while I watched.&nbsp; I looked out the</b>
<br><b>windows to see if it was windy outside, it wasn't, nor</b>
<br><b>were any doors or windows open.&nbsp; I laughed it off as</b>
<br><b>strange and lay my sleeping child down.</b>
<br><b>It was some time later that same day that I heard a</b>
<br><b>baby's laughter coming from the front living room.</b>
<br><b>Surprised that my son had somehow crawled past me</b>
<br><b>without my noticing it, I went to see what he had</b>
<br><b>found that was so funny.&nbsp; The living room was empty</b>
<br><b>and his toys were still littering the floor.&nbsp; I walked</b>
<br><b>on into my mother's room but it too was vacant, as was</b>
<br><b>the bathroom and my cousin's bedroom (the original</b>
<br><b>house had been added onto so that the rooms made a</b>
<br><b>complete circuit).&nbsp; When I exited through the second</b>
<br><b>door in my cousin's room, I saw my son still asleep on</b>
<br><b>his pillow.&nbsp; The laughter had clearly been that of a</b>
<br><b>baby, not a child or adult, and we had no young</b>
<br><b>neighbors to account for it.</b>
<br><b>It was after this initial experience that things</b>
<br><b>became increasingly active.&nbsp; My mother would be</b>
<br><b>awakened in the middle of the night by a woman</b>
<br><b>whispering her name insistently and would often wander</b>
<br><b>through to my own bedroom to ask me why I was calling</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; I denied ever doing it and she would shake her</b>
<br><b>head and go back to bed.&nbsp; It was when she</b>
<br><b>inadvertently fell asleep in my room that she</b>
<br><b>discovered who was calling her.&nbsp; My bedroom had one</b>
<br><b>door that led to the back porch and another that</b>
<br><b>opened into the kitchen.&nbsp; I rarely closed the kitchen</b>
<br><b>door since it was my only source of warmth in a very</b>
<br><b>drafty house.&nbsp; My mother had fallen asleep one</b>
<br><b>afternoon while laying on my bed and was again</b>
<br><b>awakened by an older woman calling her name softly.</b>
<br><b>Still half asleep, she raised her head toward the</b>
<br><b>voice and looked through the door and into the kitchen</b>
<br><b>where she saw an older woman sitting in a chair at a</b>
<br><b>table placed against the back wall.&nbsp; Later she asked</b>
<br><b>if I had been working in the kitchen, moving furniture</b>
<br><b>etc during her nap, but I had been busy in the front</b>
<br><b>living room.&nbsp; Our kitchen, while there was a table I</b>
<br><b>had set against the back wall, had not a single chair</b>
<br><b>in it.</b>
<br><b>A month or so after these incidents I managed to get</b>
<br><b>blood poisoning and was laid up in bed for the</b>
<br><b>evening.&nbsp; My son was especially fussy and my mother</b>
<br><b>and aunt were trying to soothe him, wondering if they</b>
<br><b>should take him to the ER due to his fever and a</b>
<br><b>strange sore they had discovered on his leg when a</b>
<br><b>very heavy beading loom that had been set flat on the</b>
<br><b>sideboard became airborne and landed on the floor at</b>
<br><b>my mother's feet.&nbsp; They decided to get the baby</b>
<br><b>medical attention as a result of our ghost's distress</b>
<br><b>and he was admitted to the hospital for pnemonia the</b>
<br><b>next morning.&nbsp; The house always had an uneasy feel to</b>
<br><b>it whenever my son was ill or cranky.</b>
<br><b>We also had a practical joker among our "spectral</b>
<br><b>guests" who liked to hide my mother's contacts.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>would search the house only to find them in exactly</b>
<br><b>the first place she had looked or not to find them at</b>
<br><b>all.&nbsp; On the days when they did no show up, I would</b>
<br><b>drive her to work and when we returned home that</b>
<br><b>afternoon, they would either be where she had left</b>
<br><b>them originally or they'd be in the icebox.</b>
<br><b>Later, after doing some research, we learned that the</b>
<br><b>landlady's daughter had comitted suicide in the barn</b>
<br><b>behind the house when she was just a teenager, we</b>
<br><b>believed her name to be Mary (which is also my</b>
<br><b>mother's name--the same name the older woman would</b>
<br><b>whisper in the night).&nbsp; We were never able to learn</b>
<br><b>anything about the baby or the older woman.&nbsp; The one</b>
<br><b>thing we knew was that, although the teen couldn't</b>
<br><b>handle my son's fussing and was at times inconsolable,</b>
<br><b>the other "spectral guests" were rather happy and none</b>
<br><b>of them ever made us feel unwanted.</b>
<br><b>Perhaps I will write of my other experiences in other</b>
<br><b>haunted houses later.&nbsp; My son and I only lived in the</b>
<br><b>farmhouse on Lakeside Drive for a year but it was long</b>
<br><b>enough to figure out at least some things about some</b>
<br><b>of the "spectral guests" we shared our home with.</b>

<p><b>ok, this is isn't gonna be professionally written, but, here it goes.
it's a story told 2 me by my grandmother, and she was there. I'm 14 now,
so this was about 12 years ago.</b>
<br><b>When i was 2, i was walking home with my grandmother. There was
a swimming pool, huge, near the house, and of course, i'm a swimmer, so
i let go of her and ran and jumped rite in it. It was cold outside, so
the pool had a cover. My grandmother can't swim, and the cover was pulling
me under, about 2 make me collapse within it and suffocate. A stranger,
a blonde blue-eyed boy, about 20 years old, appeared, and calmed my grandmother
down. He was armed with a net, which wasn't there before. He got me out,
and according 2 her, i was laughing the whole time. Thankful 2 have me
back, she turned 2 offer the boy some money. She turned and he was gone.
He of course, got wet because of my splashing, but there were no wet marks,
no wet footprints, just, nuttin', he was gone. To this day, we still don't
know who he is, but we thank him, especially me.</b><b></b>

and nothing</b>
<br><b>interesting was going on so i drove off and then i turned around

<p><b>My Best Friend came to tell Me it is OK</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MsMythofTroy@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Kira. I'm 20 years old and live in Pennsylvania. When
I was 17, I lost one of my best friends in the world. He was a nine-year-old
Boston Terrier named Midas. People think I'm crazy when I say that I still
can't talk about him because I'll turn into a ball of tears. He died in
my bedroom at 2:57 in the morning of a brain hemorrhage. He died instantly
but had seizures for almost an hour before he finally went still. I stayed
up all night with him until my parents made me put him down and get dressed
to go to school. That night, when I went to bed, I took his mate, Ineeda,
to bed with me since they always slept together with me. I cried myself
to sleep and woke, again, at around 2, the same time the night before that
Midas began his first seizure. I felt something moving under the covers
where he always used to sleep, right against my back. I rolled over and
put my hand on the spot. It felt cold, but not cool, like there was nothing
there, but cold. I began crying again when I felt what I can only describe
as a licking-type sensation on my hand. Midas would sit and lick me for
hours if I had let him. I know in my heart of hearts that he was trying
to tell me that he was ok now. He came back a lot over the next few months.
A little over a year later, we lost his mate, Ineeda. After he died, and
then she died, I swore I'd never have another dog. I have two now, probably
because my parents couldn't stand me crying all the time. They don't come
around as much as they used to but I still dream about them and I think
that's their way of saying that its ok to have my two dogs, Socks and Weeman.
They just won't ever let me forget them.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Brother Bobby</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: southernsweetie19822004@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Becky and i am 21 years old. I was looking at the
website and decided to share my experience with you. My oldest brother
Bobby died 2 years ago of cancer. It was a peaceful death but not for me
i still have moments that i sit and cry i miss him so bad. Anyway, not
long after his death i started seeing him around the house. He just more
or less smiles at me as if to say everything will be ok. Just so you know
he was a big practical joker especially on me. He would do anything for
a laugh. So even now still does play jokes on me. The&nbsp; one that sticks
out in my head the most is the time he turned my water on in the bathroom
in the middle of the night. I was asleep of course and when i heard the
water it scared me so bad that i sat straight up in bed. I looked into
the bathroom told him he made his point and i heard him laugh and then
of course he turned the water off. I'm not the only person in my family
who has these experiences. My mom also has them. It wasn't 2 weeks ago
that she saw him walking in her flower garden. The neighbor thought someone
was messing around one time while my parents were gone so of course he
told them what had happened. He described the man that he had seen walking
around, about 6ft 2in tall long blonde hair and beard that looked to be
maybe in his early 30s. He came close to the house to get a better look
and of course he was gone. My parents just laughed and siad that was our
son that passed away to cancer hes still here. The man just looked confused
and walked away. I can lay in bed at night and watch my son sleep and see
his hair move like someone is playing with his hair but of course it doesn't
sca me cause i know its just Bobby. My son can even see him at times when
i can't. He will be sitting in the floor playing and just start laughing
and saying Bobo which is what he called him cause at the time of his death
my son was only a year old and couldn't speak well yet. I have also noticed
that things i have lost and hunt for turn up in plain site a few days later
almost like he has found them for me and out them where i can find them.
He was also a smoker, and somenights i can smell the smoke and even see
it. I believe he is my guardian angel and he will always be with me. I
am glad i have found somewhere i can share my experiences with others like
me</b>

<p><b>My Odd Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hockeynuts@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hi! Ive always been facinated with ghosts and hauntings and I love
this site. Ive had experiences since I was a child and perhaps I will write
about those at a later date.&nbsp; Presently, my family(Husband and 2 teens)
and I live in one of the original farmhouses of the area in suburban Pittsburgh.
PA. When we first moved in about 3 years ago, I felt a bit uncomfortable
simply because it is old and many of our friends who visited felt that
something was present. I honestly never did but it was just the age of
the house and the feel of it, that made me think that it might be possible
that we have residents other than ourselves. After a while, I completely
dismissed any chance that we may have a ghost around. This house to us,
has a very warm presence. No cold spots. No bad vibes at all. Then it happened
for the first time. I was doing dishes at the sink when i felt little "fingers"
tapping me on the hip. Like a small child. It felt so real, that i looked
down fully expecting to see a child. Nothing was there. It didnt scare
me. I didnt get a cold chill or anything at all. I brushed it off and went
about&nbsp; my business. Since then, it happens occasionally. It really
doesnt bother me.&nbsp; I never heard footsteps in the house until we made
a small unused room into an office. no one of our computers is in there
and there is a very old fashioned cubby/closet type thing in there. before
the renovation, it still had the antique type smell to it. when you are
on the computer now, you can hear light childlike footsteps going up and
down the stairs. when you go to look, nothing is there and the steps cease.
when you sit back down at the desk, they start again. We are so used to
it now, that we dont even check. I work at night so i sleep during the
day while my children are at school. I like to fall asleep watching TV.
One morning, i was watching and the TV started glitching. making odd noises.
I checked the connections, all good. It didnt create the "squares" like
when the satellite signal is wavering. I finally gave up and just shut
it off and went to sleep. The next day, I was watching TV in bed again.
It was working fine for a while and it started again. I got this feeling
that it was our "ghost" and I said out loud and firmly "cut it out now!"
The TV went back to functioning properly and didnt give me another minutes
trouble. A few months later it happened again. i repeated what I did the
first time and again, the activity stopped. I have never heard voices or
seen anything but I get the distinct feeling that this may be the spirit
of a child.&nbsp; Who knows?</b><b></b>

<br><b>Church Trip to Italy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: skislope02@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I went to Italy four years ago for a pilgramige.&nbsp; We went to
Rome, florence, siena, assisi, naples, pompie, verona, and venice.&nbsp;
I have always been interested in the paranormal but i never expected anything
to happen to me in italy, but that was not the case.&nbsp; The hotel in
Rome we stayed at was considerably nice When we first got their we went
to our respective rooms.&nbsp; My roomate david and i decided to tak e
aa quick rest.&nbsp; we woke up maybe an hour later to someone knocking
on our door.&nbsp; When david opened the door there was no one there.&nbsp;
We were teenagers at the time, and thought someone in our group was having
a little fun so we just let it go.&nbsp; This happened two more times that
afternoon.&nbsp; That night we asked our group who did it. Of course, no
one fessed up.&nbsp; so, we let it go.&nbsp; That night we got back to
the room and stayed up for a while talking about teenage guys talk about
when there away from adults.&nbsp; Well not even an hour after we had started
our conversations camee this knock louder han the rest of he times.&nbsp;
We thought it was one of the adults that had come with us.&nbsp; I went
to the door and there was no one there.&nbsp; I was mad at this point and
i closed the door.&nbsp; I said my share of friendly words about who ever
was doing it.&nbsp; Not too long after that we decided to go to sleep.&nbsp;
At about 5 AM the next morning came another knock.&nbsp; I was very mad
at this time.&nbsp; So, i got up as fast as possible and went to the door
and was ready to kill somebody.&nbsp; i opened the door nothing.&nbsp;
So i decided to get dressed and check out the hotel.&nbsp; when i got downstairs
there were a few people who worked there getting breakfast prepared and
i walked around the lobby area.&nbsp; On the wall there was a cross.&nbsp;
It looked old, but i thought it was decorative.&nbsp; when our tour guide
came down i asked why it was there and her response was that the building
was originally a monestary, and they had just added parts on to it to make
a hotel.&nbsp; Apparently it was very very old.&nbsp; My roomate came down
not to long after the tour guide did.&nbsp; He asked me what i needed when
i came in to the room.&nbsp; I told him i had been downstairs since 5:15.
Our tour guide said that she has had other groups experience the same thing.&nbsp;
at least we werent the only ones though it had happened to.</b>

<br><b>Stepp Graveyard</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:joebaker@hpcisp.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was three summers ago, some of my friends and I thought it would
be fun to go too the spooky graveyard in Morgan State forest. Now Stepp
has a history that anyone can look up with a computer, lots of good stories
lurk around there, but this one is mine. To get to the graveyard you have
to walk about half a mile in the woods and it sounds like animals are running
wild all around you, plus it's pitch black.</b>
<br><b>When we got there it was so very cold and something kept pulling
me to one headstone, i shined my flashlight long enough to light the white
candles we had brought, and there on the marker, okay you know sometimes
they have pretty words on them, but this one said "Never At Rest" and when
ever my boyfriend read that out loud all of our candles went out and so
did our one flashlight.</b>
<br><b>We just kind of stood there and I swear to you that I felt something
kiss my neck, well that was enough for me and I started to cry then my
flashlight came back on and we started as fast as we could walking to the
car. We got back and I know that you are never suppose to look back but
of course we all did. And it looked like a black dog but bigger like a
horse. I want to go back but none of my friends do, and to be honest I'm
too scared to go alone.</b>
<br><b>Well that's my story I live in Bloomington Indiana Stepp is about
half an hour away from Morgan State Park.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Noisy Thirsty Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wonderbird@satx.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in central Texas in a small town, near San Antonio.&nbsp;
In March of 1998 I separated from my husband and moved out of our home
to a one-bedroom apartment across town.&nbsp; I moved into this apartment
with my two daughters.&nbsp; The apartment was in an 8-plex building and
was the front first-floor apartment closest to the small parking lot.&nbsp;
The apartment was small with a kitchen, dining area/living room combo,
and bedroom with a connected bath.&nbsp; The kitchen/dining/living room
combo was L-shaped so that when you were in the kitchen you could not see
into the living room and vice versa.</b>
<br><b>While moving into the apartment my husband would not allow me to
take much of our furniture, limiting me to only 1 pickup load.&nbsp; (At
the time of our separation we had been married for nine years - I can only
say he was a real peach of a guy--)&nbsp; So out of a houseful of funiture
I only took an entertainment center, TV, baby bed, sofa, and two dining
room chairs.&nbsp; I used an air mattress to sleep on for the first few
months.</b>
<br><b>Within the first couple of weeks there were strange occurences within
the apartment.&nbsp; I did not like to be alone in the house.&nbsp; I found
that when things were quiet, such as when the girls were asleep, I could
sense and hear these occurrences with more clarity.&nbsp; Most of the feelings
and sounds I dismissed as my imagination.&nbsp; The first unnerving event
was with my television.&nbsp; While watching a movie I would suddenly hear
a loud pop!&nbsp; It was like a combination of a bang and a popping sound
that would occur within or very close to the television.&nbsp; The television
was only about three years old - had perfect sound and picture except for
this VERY LOUD pop.&nbsp; Aside from the fact that I was worried I'd have
to buy a new TV, nothing else would happen, only the loud pop.&nbsp; So
I'd go back to watching the movie.&nbsp; This "popping" noise would increase
in frequency as the months went on, but my television remained normal.&nbsp;
It would occur when I was alone or with friends.&nbsp; And it would startle
you because it was so loud and sudden.&nbsp; Everyone who heard it would
comment that they had never heard such a thing.</b>
<br><b>The next event would happen many times during the six months that
I lived in the apartment.&nbsp; While watching TV or reading I would hear
- a distinctive series of sounds from the kitchen - someone would open
the cabinet, take out a big plastic cup, close the cabinet, and open the
refrigerator.&nbsp; That was it.&nbsp; I'd get up, cautiously, and look
around the corner into the small kitchen.&nbsp; Noone there, no cup on
the counter, fridge is closed.&nbsp; This would happen at least once or
twice a week and it did not matter if I was alone or not.&nbsp; The sounds
were very distinctive, even to the point that I *know* the cup was a big
plastic one.&nbsp; (The cabinet next to my refrigerator did not have cups
or glasses in it.&nbsp; It held cans and spices.)&nbsp; Late one night,
around 2am, I had two friends over watching a movie, we had just eaten
pancakes so the kitchen was a mess.&nbsp; We were quite engrossed in the
movie when the sound of the cabinet, cup, and refrigerator occurred in
the kitchen.&nbsp; It totally freaked out my two friends and they didn't
know what to think.&nbsp; One friend insisted that one of my kids had to
have gotten up and gone in there.&nbsp; He got up to check and was freaked
out to find that the kitchen was empty and the fridge was closed.&nbsp;
As time went on these sounds became more frequent and I would get more
afraid to check the kitchen, though I was still compelled to do so.&nbsp;
You could also hear these sounds from the bedroom.</b>
<br><b>One of my cousins worked the late shift in town but lived in another
city nearby.&nbsp; Occasionally when he had to work overtime and would
be too tired to drive he would come by and sleep on my couch until morning.&nbsp;
I had given him a key to my apartment for this purpose.&nbsp; One night,
not long after I had finally bought a real bed, he woke me up very upset.&nbsp;
He said that he had let himself in and been surprised to see me sitting
up on the couch waiting for him.&nbsp; He had turned on the lamp by the
door and very startled when he saw that I was not there.&nbsp; No one was
on the couch at all.&nbsp; He claimed he could see a person sitting there
perfectly because of the light from the streetlight coming through the
window.&nbsp; He could remember details such as that their hair was sticking
up, they had their hands folded in their lap, and that he thought they
were sitting cross-legged because he did not remember seeing their legs
below the knees or feet.&nbsp; He definately saw something that night because
he would not sleep on the couch and was too scared to drive.&nbsp; He slept
on the floor next to my bed until morning.&nbsp; Some weeks later a similar
event again took place with him and he refused to stay over anymore unless
I moved.&nbsp; Prior to my cousins experiences, I believe that I also had
encounters with this intruder, though I never saw it, I would get up during
the night to go to the bathroom, but often I would not go into the living
room because of a creepy and sinister feeling I would get.&nbsp; I would
hurry past my bedroom door and get quickly into bed.</b>
<br><b>I did finally move in October to a different place.&nbsp; A year
or so later we were having a party at a friend of mine when someone mentioned
that they had lived at that apartment building.&nbsp; He asked if I had
ever noticed anything odd.&nbsp; We compared notes about different strange
experiences that went on while we lived there.&nbsp; As a note, my children
never seemed to notice anything other than the noise the TV would make.&nbsp;
For the record, we still have that television, it never made that noise
again, and it still works wonderfully.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;The Mary Anne</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ECRANE@Goldfeinlaw.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>While vacationing on Cape Cod (September 1987) I was bike riding
just North of Orleans, on the ocean side of the Cape.&nbsp; As I came over
a small rise (too small to be called a hill) I instantly realized that
I had gone back in time.&nbsp; The two-lane macadam road I had been binkin
down had disappeared ... I found myself trying to follow an extremely narrow
footpath surrounded by a tangle of weeds, stickers and sweet peas.&nbsp;
The summer houses that had been on my left (the ocean was on my right)
had disappeared and been replaced by a farm complete with cows in a pasture,
sheep and an apple orchard!&nbsp; Everything looked very faded and old,
like an old tintype, and there was very little color.&nbsp; I wasn't afraid,
just puzzled that time had twisted somehow and thrown me back into the
past.&nbsp; I got off my bicycle and began walking it along this little
footpath (which disappeared from time to time into the weeds).&nbsp; Suddenly
I noticed a man up ahead of me standing in the weeds.&nbsp; He looked to
be about sixty years old, was partially bald and had a grizzled beard.&nbsp;
He was gazing towards the ocean and seemed to be wearing old-fashioned
clothing that included some kind of knee-breeches and a torn and rumpled
white shirt.&nbsp; And his clothing was very, very wet.&nbsp; When I got
close to him, he turned to me and said, "It's too bad about the Mary Anne."&nbsp;
"What's the Mary Anne?" I asked him.&nbsp; "She's a ship and she went down
right here and took everyone with her to the bottom of the ocean," was
his answer.&nbsp; He then began walking towards the ocean.&nbsp; Once he
reached the water, he kept on walking until he disappeared into the surf.&nbsp;
At this point I was somehow catapulted into the present time.&nbsp; The
farm was gone, the summer houses were back and I was standing by the two
lane macadam road.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, once I had access to the
Internet I looked up shipwrecks and found that in 1717 a ship called Mary
Anne was lost just off the ocean side of Cape Cod at about Orleans.&nbsp;
No one knows exactly where she went down ... except maybe that old man</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Shadow</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: brianclark3@cox.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Erica and I am 20 yrs. old.&nbsp; My family, especially
my mother's side, have had countless experiences with ghosts and other
apparitions.&nbsp; In one of what began as a series of experiences happened
in my own home as I was growing up.</b>
<br><b>It began in the summer of 1994 the night that O.J. Simpson was fleeing
from the police in the infamous "Bronco chase".&nbsp; My Mom, Dad, brother,
and I stayed up watching the news coverage of the story as it unfolded.&nbsp;
I was going into the 5th grade at the time.&nbsp; Later that night my mom
was awoken to someone shaking her.&nbsp; To her surprise she saw a black
figure of a man above her.&nbsp; She screamed and shook my dad to awaken
him.&nbsp; When she told him what happened he just told her, "You were
just having a nightmare from staying up watching that guy being chased
from the cops."</b>
<br><b>In October of that year we moved from that house to another in the
same city.&nbsp; In this house my mother continued to see this apparition.&nbsp;
She swore she was always wide awake when she saw it.&nbsp; I remember many
occasions hearing her scream at night, and myself being so terrified that
I would see it also, I would pull the blankets over my head to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Later that same year in December my mom had just picked my brother
and I up from school and arrived at the house.&nbsp; I remember that day
vividly.&nbsp; My mom was carrying a large roll of wrapping paper, since
it was Christmas time.&nbsp; I walked down the hall to my room which was
the last door on the right.&nbsp; I was carrying my backpack when I stopped
at my doorway.&nbsp; I saw a tall silouette of a man standing there.&nbsp;
I immediately dropped my backpack and ran down the hall crying hysterically.&nbsp;
"Mommy, there's a man in my room!"&nbsp; So my mom, carrying the roll of
wrapping paper, went to my room.&nbsp; Of course no one was there.&nbsp;
I knew what I saw, and my door was wide open.</b>
<br><b>Years later she told me that earlier that day before she took us
to school, she saw that shadow standing in the hallway.&nbsp; She paid
no attention to it since she was in a hurry and she was used to seeing
it anyway.&nbsp; My mom continues to see her ghost every once in a while.&nbsp;
It's a harmless ghost.&nbsp; My mom can't figure out who it is and why
it comes to her.&nbsp; She used to think it wanted to tell her something.&nbsp;
But maybe it's there to watch over her</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Phantom Rock at Mokuleia</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I'm from Honolulu, Hawai'i. First, I'd like to say that Hawai'i has
many ghosts. The people of the islands have great respect for them and
fear of them. The story I'm about to tell you happend when I was in the
sixth grade, but for years after I still refused to believe in ghosts,
though I'm a native of the islands and have had several "experiences" to
prove otherwise.</b>
<br><b>When I was in the sixth grade all the sixth graders of my school
went on a camping trip. We were to camp at a place called Mokuleia Beach-
a site that had cabins and we were to be there for a week (five days, actually).
It's on the northwestern/ western shores of Oahu. I didn't have much friends
but decided to go anyway. My twin brother went, too.</b>
<br><b>This place was rumored to be very haunted, and kids being the way
that kids are, they helped reinforce that fear by playing pratical jokes.
They scared the Hell out of me and I broke into tears, but after a while
I began to enjoy myself, a little. I was also reassured by our teacher,
and the guys who scared me, that there were no ghosts. But, I did see something-
after everyone went to sleep.</b>
<br><b>The cabins are near the beach, across this large, empty field from
the cafeteria, and the swimming pool. From this field you can see the two-lane
highway, in the daytime. At night you can't see it because there are no
street lights. Now outside the cabin doors are a few trees and the beach.
The room I had was on the side of the field. I couldn't sleep because of
the practical joke. The kid who was with me couldn't sleep because "we're
not home so why sleep?" I was looking across the field at the cafeteria
and everything else. There were no clouds in the sky, but no moonlight
either.</b>
<br><b>Right outside of my window I saw a rectangle of light, as if coming
from a window. In this rectangle of light there was the silhouette of a
man sitting on a large boulder, perhaps smoking a cigarette. His legs were
bent and drawn up toward his chest so he could rest his elbows on his knees.
The kid with me saw this, too, and we thought that maybe it was one of
the teachers. We didn't want to turn on our flash lights because we didn't
want to get caught.</b>
<br><b>Then, we realized that there was no boulder outside of our room
or next to the cabin. Our cabin was the first one that you could see from
the cafeteria. There is no boulder outside of that room! Then we also realized
that our window was the only window on this side of the cabin and our light
was off. Where was the light coming from? Even if it was a teacher smoking
a cigarette on the porch of the cabin, where was the large boulder he sat
on? And if it was the porch light, the trees should've been illuminated,
but they weren't. This rectangle of light came from a window, our window.
It was the only light on the field and we were sitting in complete darkness.</b>
<br><b>We didn't say anything to anyone about it for fear of being ridiculed.
But, we both saw something. To confirm our suspicions, the next morning
we looked out of our window and found no boulder there, just an empty field.</b>

<p><b>Ghost Walker on the Beach</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here's an incident that happend in Honolulu back in 1988. One night
me, my two brothers and their two friends went "cruising" around through
Waikiki and the Diamond Head area in a Monte Carlo SS. On the way to Waikiki
we stopped a place called Ala Moana Beach Park. We parked on the road next
to the beach and just hung out. The road is very well lit&nbsp; and you
can see the sand , down to the water, very clearly. It was about 10 p.m.
and back then, it was still okay to hang out there.</b>
<br><b>Ala Moana beach park is a very popular beach and is well visited
by many tourists. The smarter ones will go there instead of staying in
Waikiki, which is several blocks away. At night they have tractors that
go onto the beach at Ala Moana to "comb" the beach. These tractors have
a giant rake-like appendage behind it to do just that. The beach-comber
gets the sand nice and even for the beach-goers.</b>
<br><b>I saw the beach-comber heading our way and decided to follow behind
it as it went back the other direction. As I did this, the rest of the
guys decided to follow me, too, but they walked alongside of me, along
the wall next to the street, and a little behind. We were just walking
the beach. As I looked down at the newly combed sand I noticed that there
were footprints along side of mine, following the tractor, just as I was.
The problem was that it was on the side nearest the ocean and not the streetside
were my brothers and friends were. They were also a few feet behind me.</b>
<br><b>I stopped in my tracks. Over newly combed sand there should only
be the tracks of the giant rake, as the tire tracks get smoothed over when
the rake passes over them. I left footprints, and so did the others with
me. But, they should've been the only prints. They all saw me stop and
I said, "Hey, there's another set of prints beside mine." As they came
running up and they saw the other footprints&nbsp; and stopped a few feet
away from me.</b>
<br><b>Someone said, "Yeah, and there's enough light to see." I looked
ahead of me and saw no footprints from where I stopped just the lines created
by the beach-comber, which looked about the size of my thumb in the distance.
I was wearing shoes, the prints were "foot" prints. We followed the prints
back to when I first started following the tractor. It didn't frighten
us, but it did feel eerie. It puzzled us, too, because we heard of no hauntings
on this beach before. But, Hawai'i is an interesting place when it comes
to ghosts.</b>
<br><b>To this day we don't know who was out there walking beside me. My
twin still tells this story to people. My younger brother remembers it.
it's always mentioned whenever we talk about ghosts.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Back-up</b><b></b>

<p><b>this isnt that scary- just weird. me and a friend were staying up
late at my house when we heard a man shout into his walki-talkie "quick,
we need backup!!!" and the sound of screeching tires. it was exactly midnight.
we both got reall scared and ran upstairs to my room where we locked the
door. I got a baseball bat and she got pepper spray. the plan was, if someone
busted in, she would run up and spray their eyes, while I would charge
and club the&nbsp; dude. we stayed watch at the top of my stairs and finally
went to bed. a couple nights later, it was midnight and I heard the exact
same thing at the exact same time. I immediately freaked, our neighborhood
never had people doing stuff like that. seniors populate most of it. although
we laugh a lot about that first night, I've never told her that it happened

<p><b>Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LadyWhiteWolfe@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Hi my name is Sara I grew up in Fontana, CA and now live in San
Bernardino, CA. This might sound strange but I hope not. I don't have one
specific story to tell, but many. My entire life has been spent being haunted
my one ghost or another, no matter where I have lived there are ghost there.
I remember my mother telling me stories of her encounters with ghosts,
it seems most of her life was also spent being haunted, my sisters also
are haunted, some of us more than others. One paticular house does come
to mind as my sister and I have recently discovered we had been having
the same dream for many years about this house, I have not lived in the
house for 23 years. The house was full of shapes and shadows that we're
not explainable. There we're strange noises and strange smells. The cat
was always being thrown in the pool, we would here the water splash and
run out to the pool but there was no one there, except the cat in the pool.
We would see faces and shapes in the glass back door we had, and there
was always a feeling of forboding and unrest a presence of evil lay over
this house. I could go into great detail about this house and my experiences
there but I waon't at this time. The house is no longer there, after we
moved out the house was occupied by several other families, but no one
stayed very long and eventually the house was bulldozed. I have recently
taken my daughter and some of her friends there (to the property where
the house once stood) without telling them to mush about the house. While
we we're there a couple of them started getting sick and one ended up with
a few scratches on them, another had something push him and almost knock
him over, other things happened that I do not want to discuss right now.
I know to some this sounds like a made up story but it is not. There was
something there and it did not want us there. We have been back a couple
of more times with pretty much the same results. We don't know if we will
go back again, but for some reason I am drawn to this laand where I once
lived as a child, why I don't know but maybe one day I will find out. The
property is located on Alder Ave. Thank you for your time and for letting
me get this off my chest, I feel better finally getting to tell someone
(who understands) about some of my experiences. Again thank you.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Native</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Hwhitehall@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have heard about a ghost of a Native American living in a house
on the north east corner of Belt and Everett in Spokane, WA. My parents
lived in this house for 5 years back in the 1970's and always felt uneasy
while living there. My parents bought the house to start off their new
family just before my sister was born.&nbsp; It was a small but welcoming
to a young couple about ready to start a family. My mother was the first
to feel uneasy when she was resting with my sister on the sofa in the living
room. Our dog Taffy was in the hallway growling with her teeth showing
and all the hairs on the back of her neck were standing. My mother could
not figure out what Taffy was growling at and tried to call her near. Taffy
would not take her eyes off what ever was in the hallway. My mother got
up and walked toward Taffy, but as soon as she came near the puppy the
episode was over and Taffy went back to her favorite spot in the house
as if nothing had happened.</b>
<br><b>Another time my mother had a friend from out of town over to stay
house to see the new baby (My sister) and the new house, but as soon as
she walked in the house she noticed something strange right away. She told
my mother there is a presents in the house and it would be wise to have
my sister baptized or have the house blessed by a priest.&nbsp; My mother's
feeling was a little uneasy by this suggestion, didn't take the advise
and continued her everyday life at the house. The next account was after
my parents came home to a house with the main doors open and nothing out
of place. They knew they had locked the house before leaving and thought
someone may have broke into the house while they were out for the day.
They found no one and nothing was missing. They asked neighbors if they
had seen anything, but no one in the neighborhood knew what they were talking
about. This happened several times after and happened while they were out
for the day.</b>
<br><b>One evening my mother was laying in her bed while my father was
working graveyard. She felt very uneasy while he was working late hours
and she would refuse to sleep incase someone or something would harm her
and my sister. While sitting up in bed she saw a figure of a man in a raccoon
hat and buckskin (clothes like Davy Crockett) walking down the hallway.
This man never looked at her or even acknowledged my mother's presents.
He just walked right into a wall and disappeared into thin air. at this
point she thought she was going crazy or dreaming. When my father came
home she told him about the strange man in the house and what he looked
like. He didn't say anything about it and just calmed her thoughts and
told her to get some rest. Not long after my parents found a new house
to accommodate their growing family and moved. My family never saw him
again. Who ever the Native was he stayed behind and never bothered us again.
Years later while having a good time with old friends the ghost of the
native man came into a conversation. My mother was talking about the old
house and the story of the ghost when my father jumped in to mention that
he had in fact seen the ghost too. My mother was astounded and could not
believe my father had not confided in my mother and kept this from her
for so many years. My father had seen someone walking through the house
and had his own experience with Taffy. My father believed it was a ghost
of a Native American that lived in the area at one time. He knew the spirit
would never hurt anyone in the house and my family came to terms that he
was friendly and maybe looking for something or someone. He was peaceful
and respectful, despite leaving the front door open on occasions.</b>
<br><b>While I was in high school, I became friends with the grand daughter
of the current owners of the little house on Belt and Everett. She told
me about a house that her grandparents lived in and how strange things
happened there to her family. At first we had no idea that we were talking
about the same house until I drove passed it and pointed out the house
to my friends in the car. Kim spoke up and said "that is the house that
my grandparents live in!" We both looked at each other and realized our
stories had a lot in common. We talked about it and found the ghost was
the same Native American that my parents had seen. Who ever the ghost may
be I hope he finds what he was looking for and can finally rest in peace.</b>
<br><b>I like to believe he may be a part of the Spokanee Indian Tribe,
before the city of Spokane was born and he somehow died and lost his way
to the spirit world.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My House is Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Umabel232003@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, it all started about 6 years ago.&nbsp; My mother bought this
house exactly five years ago on November 26 1998.&nbsp; One or two weeks
before we moved in the house, my mother told me to come with her, so I
could see the house.&nbsp; I came with her, and then she asked me If I
liked the house.&nbsp; I told her that the house was pretty, but i was
getting a weird feeling, when I enter to the bedroom that she choose for
me. I told her that I didnt like it, that she had time to make up her mind
and buy another home, but she didnt listen to me.&nbsp; When we started
to move, our house almost got on fire.&nbsp; The fist night that I sleep
in my bedroom, I felt somebody stending next to me, I looked and I saw
a woman wearing a long white pijama.&nbsp; That night I couldnt sleep at
all, I was so scared and at the same time confused, cause I was asking
my self why she just stood there?.&nbsp; The next day I aske my sister
If she was in my room, she sayd no.&nbsp; I ask my mother and she sayd
no, the I told them that there Its a ghost in this house, and they didnt
belive me.&nbsp; They were saying that I was making up a scary story, but
its all true.&nbsp; Then, after 5 years that i saw that woman every day
in my room, for all of this years, I started seeing dark shadows.&nbsp;
The dark shadows that I see, are just standing between my bedroom door.&nbsp;
Til, one day I felt somebody touching me, I looked and cant see no one,
and I started feeling verry cold, and started to feel like somebody elses
hands touching me.&nbsp; About like 7 or 8 months ago, my mothers friend
came to my house, to refinance the house and my mother wes talking to her
about that I was telling her that I see a woman in my room, and that I
see a dar shadow too.&nbsp; So, that lady about a week later, she came
to my house again, but with her husband whom I never seen until that day
and her husband while my mother was talking to her, her husband went to
the basement to help my father to fix something in the basement, cause
his wife told him to help my father.&nbsp; When they finished, he was kind
of weird.&nbsp; The next day, his wife came to my house, and asked my mother:
whos the one that sees a woman here in your house?, my mother told her
it was me.&nbsp; My mother aske her why, and she sayd: Its that my husband
saw her last night.&nbsp; He says that you got to beleive your daughter,
cause my husband saw her too, and she was in the basement, wearing a long
white pijama.&nbsp; Then my father was telling that to my neighbor, and
my neighbor told my father that his wife, saw a strange woman coming out
of our house, and when she was looking to see who was that woman, she disappered.
(Excuse my English).&nbsp; Well, thats my story, and once again..&nbsp;
This its all true, no lies.&nbsp; I dont like to lie about something serious.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Something in the Bedroom</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: EvLsInnocence13@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 13 a lot of weird stuff began happening to me. I had always
felt that I was being watched, and when I was 13 my theories proved to
be true. One night I was sleeping in my parents room (I had accidentally
fallen asleep there) and I was suddenly awakened by this very loud wheezing.
It sounded like someone was standing over me and choking! I shut my eyes
really tightly and held my breath thinking that maybe it was somehow me
breathing. Well, instead the wheezing became louder and more desperate
and utterly horrible. I have never been so scared in my life! I was praying
for it to stop and finally, after what felt like forever it stopped. I
made up my mind that on the count of three I was going to sit up quickly
and look to see who or what it was. One, two three! I sat up but thankfully
there was no one there. (at least no one I could see) After that I think
I fell asleep because when I woke up it was morning. That same day, when
night fell, I went back into my parents room. The closet door was open
a little bit and I looked in. I wasn't really close to the closet door.
I was sitting on my parents bed and I kind of peered in from there. I'm
not totally sure what I saw but it appeared to be a face with eyes and
a nose and mouth. I only got a glimpse of it because I shut my eyes so
quickly. However when I reluctantly looked again what I had seen was gone.
To this day I am still very nervous about going into my parents room and
I only go up there in the day or at night if someone goes up with me. Other
"weird" things have also happened to me in that same room and in other
parts of my house.</b>

<br><b>The Sounds and Sights of Children</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: butterfly_kisses224@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello! I am currently working at the London Regional Children's Museum
in London, Ontario, and the staff and volunteers here could say that this
77 year old building is very much haunted. There are many different stories
that have been told over the years about unusual experiences that the staff
have had. First, I should start off by stating that before this building
was a Museum, it was an elementary school for grades JK-8. It was called
Riverview Public School and it was built in 1927.</b>
<br><b>On with the encounters: Either in the early morning (before opening)
or when we are closing and there are no visitors left in the museum, we
can distinctively hear the sounds of children laughing and giggling and
running through the hallway on the second floor. (we have three floors
in total). It continues to occur and it frightens the staff everytime it
happens. We also witness the elevator door opening and closing and going
from floor to floor on its own. We've ruled out that it is a technical
problem because we have notified the company who operates the elevator.&nbsp;
They have checked it several times and reported nothing to be wrong with
it. Sometimes, if I'm feeling brave, when the elevator door opens up when
I walk by, I'll peek into it. Nothing unusual happens ut I do get an eerie
feeling as I step inside! (*note*-The elevator does not contain any censors
that open when someone walks by)</b>
<br><b>The most recent and frightening story that I myself have witnessed,
still boggles my mind. It was the end of the day, and I was just cleaning
up some of the galleries to get ready to close up when I saw a little boy
running down the steps by himself. Nobody was around, and as museum policy,
we have to make sure that the child was not lost. I followed him down the
steps and I was about five steps away from him. He had a mushroom cut,
striped shirt, and shorts on. He had no shoes on though, which is bizarre
because none of the activities in the musuem need to have no shoes on.
Anyways, he ran right into a little space ship which is no bigger then
a chair. I did not take my eyes off the ship and I walked right up to it
to ask the little boy where his parents were. As I looked in, no one was
there. There are no other exits to this space ship. I&nbsp; took a double
take and could not believe what just happened! I then went to the front
exit to see if the little boy would come out with his parents (just in
case he did run out of the space ship, which was very unlikely I had my
eye on it!) but there was no boy that fit the profile of what I saw. All
the visitors left and no one was left in the museum. I never saw that boy
again.</b>
<br><b>I also see different figures out of the corner of my eye but when
I turn to see what is it, no one or nothing is there. One time, when I
was sitting at the front desk by myself, it was about 7:30 at night. No
one was in the museum except for myself and a girl that I work with(who
was upstairs at the time.) I was facing the front door, when I heard someone
whisper "Sara" (my name) right behind me. I turned around expecting to
see my co-worker, but again, no one was there. I called up to her asking
her if she had played a trick on me, but she told me that she was in the
washroom. That story still freaks me out!</b>
<br><b>Another occurence did not happen to me personally, but a co-worker
of mine. He told me that he was on the third floor in the staff room. It
was pitch black because we were closing. In our staff room the door has
a glass window in it. As he went to leave, he saw a distorted face staring
at him. He screamed and opened the door to find nothing there.</b>
<br><b>Over the years, many students that have attended the school (before
it became a museum) come to visit us. I've asked several of them if anything
strange or unusual had ever happened in this building. They just shrug
and say, "Let's not bring that up again.."</b>
