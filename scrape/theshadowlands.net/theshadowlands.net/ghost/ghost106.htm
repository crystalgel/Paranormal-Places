<b>A Broken Heart?</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: jackie@lavelle.com</b>
<p><b>My husband and I moved into this small upstairs 2 bedroom apartment
shortly after we were married.</b>
<br><b>It was a beautiful old Victorian house and the owner (a widow) lived
downstairs in the rest of</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; We only lived there for about 1 to 2 months.&nbsp;
A few weeks after we had moved in, I</b>
<br><b>awoke one night and was completely petrified.&nbsp; Absolutely Terrified!&nbsp;
My heart was in my throat,</b>
<br><b>pounding like it would jump out of my chest.... Of what?&nbsp; I
don't know, I can only describe it</b>
<br><b>as an over whelming feeling of evil.&nbsp; I saw nothing.&nbsp;
I woke up my husband and told him we had</b>
<br><b>to leave the house.&nbsp; Right Now!!&nbsp; He looked at me like
I was crazy of course, it was around 2 or</b>
<br><b>3 o'clock in the morning! He must have saw the urgency and seriousness
on my face, because I</b>
<br><b>wouldn't even talk about what I was feeling...I just held on to
him and insisted that we leave</b>
<br><b>and drive somewhere... anywhere before I said a thing.&nbsp; Which
we did.&nbsp; I then explained to him</b>
<br><b>what happened.&nbsp; He believed my feelings were sincere...but
I had no details...just an over</b>
<br><b>whelming feeling of EVIL!&nbsp; Well, we moved out shortly after
that. But I wasn't crazy....</b>
<br><b>Almost 3 to 4 years later, still living in the same town, a girl
came to work at the company that</b>
<br><b>I worked for.&nbsp; She was the daughter of the widow who lived
downstairs of that creepy apartment.</b>
<br><b>Oh, what a small world, etc, etc. We chatted along nicely.&nbsp;
Then I told her what happened that</b>
<br><b>night and jeez wasn't it goofy!&nbsp; She looked at me ... her face
went pale and she swallowed hard.</b>
<br><b>"What month did you say that happened?"&nbsp; she asked me.&nbsp;
"June... why?"&nbsp; She then proceeded to</b>
<br><b>tell me about her brother.&nbsp; Her brother had committed suicide
many years earlier, in the bedroom</b>
<br><b>that we had slept in.&nbsp; It was over a girl, he had shot himself
with a rifle... and it had been</b>
<br><b>a June night.&nbsp; It still gives me the creeps when I think about
it.</b>
<p><b>Have a Great Day!</b>

<br><b>Can't Get Rid of Them...</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: Marie-Claude.Peloquin@microcell.ca</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>It is with a lot of passion this morning that I went over everything
on your</b>
<br><b>web site. I finally did the move of searching the web for people
who had more</b>
<br><b>experiences then I do with ghost manifestation. I have to say I'm
mixed on</b>
<br><b>this matter, from one end it is fascinating and from the other it
is the</b>
<br><b>cause of great anxiety and frustration. let me give you a briefing
about my</b>
<br><b>experience, who's content is not just feeling and haze like you
find in</b>
<br><b>cemetery.</b>
<br><b>My room mate moved from one place to another and almost always had</b>
<br><b>experiences. The first place was build over a jew cemetery. The
second one,</b>
<br><b>where I was living also was haunted more because of some death that
occur a</b>
<br><b>while ago in the building. In this building. They was blood traces
appearing on</b>
<br><b>the floor and disappearing from time to time. A lot of ghost were
there women</b>
<br><b>and men which we saw clearly. My dog was waking us up at night making
tnis strange</b>
<br><b>noise almost human. So we moved tired and full of hope that our
next places were</b>
<br><b>to be calm and "ours" alone...</b>
<br><b>Everything went well for a couple of months. So we had a good rest.
But</b>
<br><b>lately. A new ghost arrived. I think he's now alone exept for the
dead grand</b>
<br><b>mother of our neighbor which is passing in the apartment on her
way to</b>
<br><b>relatives&nbsp; .The new gost is a young man he's probably just
trying to get</b>
<br><b>attention from us especially at night. I have a hard time sleeping
now, I'm</b>
<br><b>tired at work and angry. I just want to get rid of it. I think I
tried</b>
<br><b>everything from trying to talk with him to yell at him to praying.
( I didnt</b>
<br><b>do that for 15 years) ect...I dont talk about it to a lot of person
but</b>
<br><b>really no one couldn't help me giving me advise or else. I'm frighting</b>
<br><b>people. And so I am. I'm thinking about moving again, . What can
I do since</b>
<br><b>I dont understand what he wants, ca'nt have a conversation, no reason
no</b>
<br><b>meaning, yesterday all evening I har him simulating washing window,(sounds</b>
<br><b>like that) he also succeeded in saying Hello near my bed after but
I didnt see</b>
<br><b>him....I feel this one is there just to bother. Anyway, I will do
anything</b>
<br><b>to be in privacy again and to feel that my home belong to me&nbsp;
Can you help</b>
<br><b>me ? There must be a way to kick a ghost butt...</b>

<p><b>Landlords Wife???</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: One4me819@aol.com</b>
<p><b>I am only writing now that I have moved into a new house. I have
lived in 2</b>
<br><b>houses were I have had things happening. The first house I lived
things would</b>
<br><b>disappear, as soon as you put it down you would turn around and
it wouldn't</b>
<br><b>be there. I would be home late at night by myself and the phone
would keep</b>
<br><b>ringing, when I went to answer it no one would be there. After about
a half</b>
<br><b>an hour I would usually unplug the phone, well one time when I did
this it</b>
<br><b>still continued to ring all night long, only once did I have the
nerve to</b>
<br><b>pick it up...dead silence.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The other house I have lived in, the most recent I had a
lot of things</b>
<br><b>going on there. When I first moved in I was doing some stuff around
the house</b>
<br><b>and decided to put some shelves into a closest that is in a bedroom
in the</b>
<br><b>basement, will I was hammering I could hear someone/thing knocking
on the</b>
<br><b>wall. This wouldn't have been so bad if I know there could be someone
on the</b>
<br><b>other side, but being down in the basement I knew it was on foundation
and</b>
<br><b>after that a lot of dirt. It just keep going knock..knock..knock,
always in</b>
<br><b>threes. Needless to say I ran out of there, when I went back down
the next</b>
<br><b>day it had luckily stopped and never happened again. Most of the
things that</b>
<br><b>have happened in that house were usually in that room and I unfortunately
was</b>
<br><b>the only one who ever had any problems. I would go down into the
room, which</b>
<br><b>eventually became my bedroom, and would smell cigarette smoke, as
though</b>
<br><b>someone had just been in there smoking. No one in my house smokes,
I could</b>
<br><b>have put it off as one of the kids sneaking one, except it had happened
a few</b>
<br><b>times when I was home alone. I would get woken up in the middle
of the night</b>
<br><b>by "someone" shaking the bed or picking up a corner of the bed and
letting it</b>
<br><b>drop. One night it felt as though someone was under the mattress
and sticking</b>
<br><b>their finger up, pushing the bed up. The worst stuff though started
happening</b>
<br><b>when the landlord was considering moving back into the house. I
would wake up</b>
<br><b>and feel terrified, it is hard to describe just how scared I was,
but I have</b>
<br><b>never felt more scared in my entire life. I wouldn't be able to
move only my</b>
<br><b>eyes and I would never see anything around me, just the normal shapes
that</b>
<br><b>were around the room. The worst night though happened on the night
we were</b>
<br><b>supposed to have left, I woke up to a growling noise and what felt
like an</b>
<br><b>arm being pushed down across my neck. I have since found out that
the</b>
<br><b>landlord's wife passed away in the house, though I don't know what
the</b>
<br><b>basement room had to do with it, that was added on after she died.
I am lucky</b>
<br><b>enough to have gotten moved out without anymore things happening
and am</b>
<br><b>praying that the new house is "entity free". Thanks for listening..</b>

<p><b>Strange Event</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: DnEfick@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I hesitate calling this a 'Ghost' story because I don't know what
it was. It</b>
<br><b>could have happened by normal means, but they would have been odd</b>
<br><b>circumstances.</b>
<br><b>About four or five years ago I was walking down Harbor Boulevard
in Costa</b>
<br><b>Mesa, California. Harbor is long and is one of the streets that
borders</b>
<br><b>Disneyland, but the section I was walking along was almost exclusively</b>
<br><b>commercial. I passed a woman with a bruised face and a 'Universal
Studios'</b>
<br><b>baseball cap with the logo in shiny silver letters walking the other
way. A</b>
<br><b>few blocks later I passed her again, going the other way. I think
I may have</b>
<br><b>smiled at her this time. A few blocks later I passed her a third
time, still</b>
<br><b>walking the other way.</b>
<br><b>I should point out that I was just walking, I never stopped to look
into a</b>
<br><b>store or restaurant, I was maintaining a steady pace. While I am
no race</b>
<br><b>walker, I have about an average walking speed, I am not extraordinarily
slow.</b>
<br><b>After the third time I turned around. I don't want to exagerate,
I didn't</b>
<br><b>whirl around by any means, I probably kept walking about another
ten steps,</b>
<br><b>saying to myself, "This is kinda weird..." and maybe stopped for
a brief</b>
<br><b>moment to think about this. When I turned around she was gone. There
was a</b>
<br><b>Pollo Loco restaurant right there, I went in there and saw no sign
of her. I</b>
<br><b>went and looked down the nearest cross street, again, no sign of
her.</b>
<p><b>As I say, I don't claim this is a ghost story, I just claim this
is a weird</b>
<br><b>event that happened to me which is possible to explain through natural</b>
<br><b>causes, but would be an odd circumstance. Yes, she could have gotten
a ride</b>
<br><b>or driven, but in that case why would I have passed her on the sidewalk
each</b>
<br><b>time, wouldn't she have driven or gotten a ride exactly where she
was going</b>
<br><b>rather than a half a block farther?</b>
<p><b>If you have any light you could shed aupon this, I would appreciate
it.</b>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Family Experiences</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: jewelsb@bigfoot.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Over that past 50 years or so many members of my family have had
interesting</b>
<br><b>ghostly experiences. None of them have been particularly frightening
though.</b>
<br><b>Here are a couple of those experiences. (These take place in the
Vancouver,</b>
<br><b>BC area)</b>
<p><b>About 15 years ago my grandmother was chopping cabbage up for supper
one</b>
<br><b>evening and accidentally cut her finger with the knife. As she was
running</b>
<br><b>her finger under the cold water tap she distinctly heard a voice
saying</b>
<br><b>"I've told you to be careful with knives Kitty!" The voice was that
of her</b>
<br><b>Auntie Nell who had died 40 years previous. She was always scolding
my</b>
<br><b>grandmother for something or the other.</b>
<p><b>Another experience happened to my Aunt. 20 years ago she and her
family</b>
<br><b>moved into a gorgeous 4 bedroom house in a wonderful area. The house
itself</b>
<br><b>was about 2 years old. After a while she would find things missing.
She put</b>
<br><b>a brand new packet of knitting needles on the kitchen shelf and
when she'd</b>
<br><b>go to get them they'd be gone. But anything else on the shelf was
then on</b>
<br><b>the floor. Her daughter was at school and her infant son was way
too young</b>
<br><b>to climb up there. The knitting needles turned up in the bath of
all places.</b>
<br><b>It was then she thought there was a spirit in the house. She was
even more</b>
<br><b>convinced when she heard singing up in her daughters room. She went
up there</b>
<br><b>and found no one. That night my cousin refused to sleep in her room.
A</b>
<br><b>little while after that Auntie went upstairs to check on the baby
as she</b>
<br><b>looked in the cot where Andy was fast asleep she swore she saw a
woman's</b>
<br><b>hand gently stroking his cheek. She calmly told the ghost "He's
asleep.</b>
<br><b>Please don't wake him up". The ghost left. The ghost also likes
to "crash"</b>
<br><b>my Aunt's parties. If guest were over shed come downstairs and join
in. The</b>
<br><b>only people who knew she was there were my Aunt and my Grandmother.
I had</b>
<br><b>only one experience with the ghost. I was babysitting one evening
and was</b>
<br><b>watching TV in the family room. All of a sudden the dog perked up
and</b>
<br><b>started wagging his tail. I knew it was her. I said "come in and
sit down"</b>
<br><b>and continued to watch the TV. There were several other things that</b>
<br><b>happened, but fortunately this spirit was friendly and harmless.
When my</b>
<br><b>Aunt moved out she found out that the property where her house stood
was</b>
<br><b>once owned by the native Indians of the area and sold to the government
in</b>
<br><b>the early 1980's. My Aunt thought that her ghost had darkish skin.
Funny</b>
<br><b>thing is that my Uncle never saw or heard the ghost at all.</b>
<p><b>There are many more stories to tell..but they'll come later.</b>

<br><b>Ghost Maybe</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: ceppag@attitude.com</b>
<p><b>About 2 weeks ago we were in bed watching t.v. (it was around 9:30
- 10:00)</b>
<br><b>when we heard feet steps, kinda like our kids had gotten out of</b>
<br><b>bed......well, I got up and checked the kids, but they were still
in bed</b>
<br><b>sleeping.&nbsp; I went back to bed.&nbsp; About 5 minutes later,
it happened again,</b>
<br><b>this time it sounded like it was running down stairs.&nbsp; My husband
grabbed</b>
<br><b>his gun, I went in the kids room, and they were still sleeping.&nbsp;
Vince said</b>
<br><b>everything was locked up, so no one was in our house.&nbsp; We couldn't
explain</b>
<br><b>what had happened, so we went to sleep.&nbsp; 5:45 in the morning,
my daughter</b>
<br><b>who is 7, came in mummbling to me until I told her to calm down.....she
said</b>
<br><b>it felt like someone was at the end of her bed and pushed her mattress,
and</b>
<br><b>in doing so, she heard her springs go up like someone was on the
bed with</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; She was looking for our cat which was asleep in our room.</b>
<p><b>Now, we have been in our house almost 4 years now.&nbsp; Our house
is a brand new</b>
<br><b>home of about 5yrs old.&nbsp; I started thinking about somethings
that has</b>
<br><b>happened in our house that I mentioned to my husband.&nbsp; I told
him, remember</b>
<br><b>a couple of times we had been gone all day, and when we came home,
I smelled</b>
<br><b>a mans cologne,very strong in some places.&nbsp; I alsoo told him
it wasn't his</b>
<br><b>cologne.&nbsp; So here I was thinking that someone had been in our
house.</b>
<p><b>Yesturday, Sept. 22, 1999, I was home by myself watching t.v. downstairs,
it</b>
<br><b>was about 11:30 a.m., and I could of sworn my son, who is 6, was
home in his</b>
<br><b>room walking around, but he was at school.&nbsp; No one but myself
was home.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>went upstairs, nothing was there.&nbsp; Today, Sept. 23, 1999, I
got home around</b>
<br><b>10:30 a.m., went upstairs and there was a smell.....I'm sorry I
cant descibe</b>
<br><b>the smell, but all I can say is it dosen't smell good.&nbsp; Now,
this smell</b>
<br><b>tipped me off today, because we have had this smell prior from today.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>strange thing about it is it only happens once in awhile. And it
usually</b>
<br><b>smells strong in the hallway and my daughters room upstairs.&nbsp;
you would</b>
<br><b>think a pungent smell like that would smell up the other rooms,
but it never</b>
<br><b>does.&nbsp; Everytime I try to find were the smell comes from, there
is never a</b>
<br><b>pin-point spot.</b>
<p><b>Does anyone have any comments that they can help us with?&nbsp; How
can we</b>
<br><b>acctually tell if we have some kind of paranormal activity going
on in here.</b>
<br><b>What we have experienced right now seems strange and unnoormal.</b>

<p><b>Family Camp</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I would like to remain be anonymous.I'm going to be</b>
<br><b>telling my friends story .I believe her because she</b>
<br><b>told me about it then we found your website and it</b>
<br><b>matched alot of others peoples stories.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend was at her family camp in</b>
<br><b>Kokadjo,Maine.This camp was built about 100 years</b>
<br><b>ago.It is set was way back in the woods, in fact it</b>
<br><b>used to be ,the only way you could reach was by</b>
<br><b>boating across the lake.It has no electrcity either.My</b>
<br><b>friend was up later than ever one else and was</b>
<br><b>listening to her walkman by lantern light.She was</b>
<br><b>looking around at the time and noticed what looked to</b>
<br><b>be like steam coming between the cracks in the</b>
<br><b>wood.But the thing was it didn't move like steam,it</b>
<br><b>did not rise,it slide in and formed sort of a ball.The</b>
<br><b>ball rose and hovered near her sister's bedroom</b>
<br><b>door.She lost it for a second ,then found it again ,it</b>
<br><b>was near the skylight and it seemed to disappear out</b>
<br><b>the skylight.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend wasn't scared at this sight and neither</b>
<br><b>she or her family ever saw,heard,or felt anything</b>
<br><b>thing before.Another weird thing was that even when</b>
<br><b>she saw it she never felt anyhting,and it never</b>

<br><b>Ghosts or Angels?</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: PoetMstres@aol.com</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I actually have two stories and I'm not sure I would call them ghost
stories</b>
<br><b>or not.&nbsp; Perhaps they are angels, but nonetheless they happened
and are not</b>
<br><b>necessary related.</b>
<br><b>When I was in highschool I was madly in love with a guy two years
older than</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I was a senior and he was graduated and in the Air Force.&nbsp;
He was my</b>
<br><b>first love.&nbsp; Shortly before my high school graduation, I had
made tentative</b>
<br><b>plans to visit him at his base in Mississippi. I called him with
my plan. He</b>
<br><b>was less than thrilled.&nbsp; It was during this call that I found
out he was</b>
<br><b>seeing another girl and we broke up.&nbsp; I was utterly devastated.&nbsp;
I kept the</b>
<br><b>pain to myself mostly, nobody really knew how terribly it had effected
me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was beside myself with hurt.&nbsp; A couple of days after we broke
up I was in my</b>
<br><b>bedroom upstairs.&nbsp; I heard my mother call my name from the
bottom of the</b>
<br><b>steps and she sounded very strange.&nbsp; She said "Come down here.&nbsp;
You got some</b>
<br><b>flowers delivered to you."&nbsp; I went to the kitchen and my mother
looked</b>
<br><b>utterly baffled.&nbsp; I was convinced they were from Dan and he
wanted me back.</b>
<br><b>The bouquet was huge and beautiful with roses and exotic flowers
and greens.</b>
<br><b>It was obviously a very expensive arrangement.&nbsp; I opened the
card and it</b>
<br><b>said:&nbsp; "What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the
Master calls a</b>
<br><b>butterfly."&nbsp; Signed Anonymous.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked everyone
I knew if they sent the</b>
<br><b>flowers.&nbsp; Nobody owned up to it.&nbsp; Nobody.&nbsp; My mom
tried to call the florist,</b>
<br><b>but the florist said that they only thing they knew is that it came
in FTD,</b>
<br><b>which meant that it wasn't local.&nbsp;&nbsp; To this day, more
than 15 years later I</b>
<br><b>still don't know who sent those flowers, but I somehow like to believe
that</b>
<br><b>they were a gift from an angel.</b>
<p><b>The second story happened this past year.&nbsp; Both of my parents
died this past</b>
<br><b>year.&nbsp; Both unexpectedly and very young.&nbsp; My mom died
of a burst aneurysm in</b>
<br><b>her heart and my father died of complications of a heart by-pass
surgery.</b>
<br><b>She was 59, my father was 62.&nbsp;&nbsp; After my mom died strange
things began to</b>
<br><b>happen.&nbsp; The first thing was the night of the first funeral&nbsp;
home visitation.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was at that time at home writing a letter to my mother to
be placed in her</b>
<br><b>casket to be buried with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister and my father
were at my parent's</b>
<br><b>house getting dressed when my sister, who was ironing in the basement,
heard</b>
<br><b>an extremely loud crash come from upstairs in the kitchen.&nbsp;
It made her jump.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She said she had been thinking about my mom.&nbsp; My dad,
at the time of the</b>
<br><b>large crash, was standing in the bedroom trying to decide which
suit to wear.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;He said that he was thinking "no, I shouldn't wear that suit,
Yvonne (my</b>
<br><b>mom) wouldn't like that."&nbsp; My dad and my sister went into the
kitchen.&nbsp; Above</b>
<br><b>the kitchen sink was a window that my mom had filled with crystals
and</b>
<br><b>stained glass pretties that were suction cupped to the window.&nbsp;
My mom's</b>
<br><b>favorite was of&nbsp; a blue stained glass oval of an angel praying.&nbsp;
It was that</b>
<br><b>glass ornament that had fallen into the sink and made the crash.&nbsp;
Those</b>
<br><b>ornaments had been there for years and NEVER fell into the sink.&nbsp;
But they</b>
<br><b>did this day.</b>
<p><b>Two days later I had to attend a doctors appointment.&nbsp; My sisters
and dad</b>
<br><b>were leaving to meet the funeral director and I was leaving for
the doctor.</b>
<br><b>I stopped and said "shoot, I don't have money for the co-pay and
I'm running</b>
<br><b>late.&nbsp; I don't have time to stop at the bank."&nbsp; My sister
gave me the money</b>
<br><b>for it.&nbsp; On the way to the appointment, I realized that "shoot
I was meeting</b>
<br><b>a friend for lunch and I still don't have any money."&nbsp; I thought
to look in</b>
<br><b>the console of my car, but I knew there would be no money there.&nbsp;
I never</b>
<br><b>leave money in my car.&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But when I opened the lid, there</b>
<br><b>sat a $5 bill.&nbsp; Odd.&nbsp; But I was so glad to see it.&nbsp;
I didn't think too much</b>
<br><b>about it until later when I though hard about it.&nbsp; I didn't
leave that money</b>
<br><b>there!!</b>
<p><b>That same day, my sisters and nephews went to my uncle's pharmacy
and</b>
<br><b>Hallmark shop where my mom had worked also.&nbsp; My mom always
bought Beenie</b>
<br><b>Babies for my nephews from there.&nbsp; My nephew was looking for
a specific</b>
<br><b>beenie and had been unable to find it for months.&nbsp; That day
they found it at</b>
<br><b>the shop.&nbsp; My uncle didn't remember ever seeing that one before
and he took</b>
<br><b>care of the ordering!</b>
<p><b>A few days later I was sleeping.&nbsp; I was exhausted from the funeral
and was</b>
<br><b>taking time off from work.&nbsp; Nobody was home, the window was
open and I was</b>
<br><b>dozing peacefully when I heard quite clearly, "Carrie...Caaaarrrrrrie..."</b>
<br><b>I sat up and my heart was pounding.&nbsp; I heard my mother.&nbsp;
She was calling me</b>
<br><b>as if I wasn't supposed to be sleeping.&nbsp; Like she always used
to do if she</b>
<br><b>thought I were over sleeping.&nbsp; One of the things that my mom
always did when</b>
<br><b>she was alive that annoyed me, was to yell my name from the bottom
of the</b>
<br><b>steps. I heard it so vividly that morning.&nbsp; I want to say it
was in my head</b>
<br><b>but it woke me up and her voice was clear as day.</b>
<p><b>My bedroom was the entire length of the top floor of a cape cod house.&nbsp;
I had</b>
<br><b>my own smoke detector up there.&nbsp; From that day on, whenever
I would get</b>
<br><b>really upset about losing my mother that silly smoke detector would
beep.</b>
<br><b>Beep, beep, beep, beep.&nbsp; I changed the battery.&nbsp; Beep,
beep, beep, beep.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>happen only when I was upset or thinking of her.</b>
<p><b>The crystals on the window began to fall off regularly, where they
never did</b>
<br><b>before.&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone in the kitchen, which had a speaker
phone function would</b>
<br><b>click on of it's own volition when someone was on the telephone.&nbsp;
It happened</b>
<br><b>about five times.&nbsp; That too had never done that before.</b>
<p><b>Suddenly, everything just stopped.&nbsp; No more odd happenings.&nbsp;
Then my father</b>
<br><b>went into a coma.&nbsp; Several friends from out of town were staying
at the house</b>
<br><b>and keeping vigil with us at the hospital.&nbsp; One evening, everyone
was at the</b>
<br><b>hospital but a friend of the family named Jenny.&nbsp;&nbsp; She
had heard the stories</b>
<br><b>of my mom's "hauntings" and the smoke detector going off.&nbsp;
She was reading a</b>
<br><b>book, alone in the house, when the smoke detector in the downstairs
hallway</b>

looked up at it</b>
<br><b>and said "Ms. Harley, we aren't ready to let Don go yet.&nbsp; You
can't have him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Is that okay?"&nbsp; The minute she said that the smoke detector

out.</b>

<p><b>Grampa's Ghost</b>

<p><b>By: ddonovan@the-bridge.net</b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I am 51 years old now.When I was 6 years old,my grandfather
committed suicide. My grandparents lived just down a short path through
the woods from our house, situated on a high hill. I didn't</b>
<br><b>understand what had happened.just that a lot of grown ups were crying
and I couldn't find grampa</b>
<br><b>anywhere. I looked in his raspberry patch, I looked behind his little
house where he chopped wood, he was nowhere. That night,I had to sleep
on the couch out in the living room. Long after dark,I saw grampa walk
by the window which was along side the path,then he walked in the door,</b>
<br><b>sat on the edge of the couch,smiled at me and was gone.I never saw
his spirit again</b>

<br><b>Imp Experience?</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: OpaqueOphelia@aol.com</b>
<p><b>Last night I saw... something.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know exactly what
it</b>
<br><b>was, but the nearest I can guess it was an Imp of some sort.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>was out driving with my boy du jour, at around 3 am, on a</b>
<br><b>winding road near where I live.&nbsp; The whole are is full of trees,</b>
<br><b>bushes, all of it very green and lovely, but the area has a</b>
<br><b>reputation as a satanists frequent haunt, but I never really</b>
<br><b>gave it a lot of thought.&nbsp; I am someone who believes in faeries,</b>
<br><b>ghosts, and nearly every other type of paranormal entity, so</b>
<br><b>I've often gotten the feeling that the area is charged with a</b>
<br><b>sort of non-human energy.&nbsp; The feeling is neither completely</b>
<br><b>good nor completely bad (these things normally aren't that</b>
<br><b>polar), and my feelings on whatever I saw last night were of</b>
<br><b>much the same duality.&nbsp; I will include as much detail as</b>
<br><b>possible.&nbsp; Some of it may be completely superfluous, but in
the</b>
<br><b>interest of being thorough, I don't want to leave anything out.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The time, as mentioned above, was around 3 am.&nbsp;
We were</b>
<br><b>driving on this windy road in my car, which is a 1996 Pontiac</b>
<br><b>Grand Am.&nbsp; Last night the moon was full.&nbsp; I remember this</b>
<br><b>distinctly, because earlier that evening I had noticed it huge</b>
<br><b>and slightly yellow in the sky and had pointed it out to my</b>
<br><b>friend.&nbsp; I had pointed this out the evening prior as well,
and</b>
<br><b>he asked how the moon could be full two nights in a row, to</b>
<br><b>which I responded that the moon is actually considered full for</b>
<br><b>three consecutive days, but that tonight it seemed to be at its</b>
<br><b>apex.&nbsp; The street, called West Road, has very little in the
way</b>
<br><b>of lighting, most of it coming from motion sensor and garage</b>
<br><b>lights of the houses that line the street.&nbsp; We had the radio
on,</b>
<br><b>but not very loud at all, and were talking.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We came around a curve, and thats when I saw
it.&nbsp; At first</b>
<br><b>I attributed it to my imagination, but from past experiences</b>
<br><b>with apparitions and other paranormal happenings, I've learned</b>
<br><b>to trust myself more.&nbsp; I have never taken drugs of any kind.
For</b>
<br><b>3 am I was well rested, as I am a night person by nature.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>didn't feel tired until 7am that morning, which is when I</b>
<br><b>finally turned in.&nbsp; I know it was not my imagination, and the</b>
<br><b>probability of me hallucinating is slim, because there was no</b>
<br><b>cause for hallucination.&nbsp; I don't know of anyone who</b>
<br><b>hallucinates without a distinguishable cause.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It had a form vaguely reminiscent of a human body,
but it</b>
<br><b>looked to be approximately 2 1/2 feet tall and very slim.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>jetted across the street with an agility I have never seen,</b>
<br><b>human or animal.&nbsp; I am reluctant to use this comparison, but
it</b>
<br><b>vaguely reminded me of the little flame characters I have seen</b>
<br><b>in cartoons, the ones who sort of take on a vaguely human form.</b>
<br><b>Picture on of those animations, only solid black from head to</b>
<br><b>foot.&nbsp; It gave off no reflection from the headlights of my
car,</b>
<br><b>but it was both darker and more substantial than any shadow I</b>
<br><b>have ever seen.&nbsp; At the time, I noticed especially it's eyes,</b>
<br><b>but as I recall the situation now, it had no eyes to speak of,</b>
<br><b>just a solid black, featureless face.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I saw it, a noticeable chill ran up and
down my spine,</b>
<br><b>though I can't say I was terrified.&nbsp; I was both disturbed</b>
<br><b>(though I can't put my finger on why), and incredibly curious.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider myself a very rational person, so
my first</b>
<br><b>thought was to anylize the situation and try to find a rational</b>
<br><b>explaination.&nbsp; I eliminated the possibility of a hallucination</b>
<br><b>as previously stated.&nbsp; I know it was not an animal because
I am</b>
<br><b>familiar with the area.&nbsp; I have lived here for 19 years, and</b>
<br><b>have travelled that same road frequently for the duration of</b>
<br><b>those 19 years.&nbsp; I have seen squirells, skunks, opposums, birds,</b>
<br><b>deer, dogs, cats, and one lizard.&nbsp; Never have I seen anything</b>
<br><b>that even remotely resembles the thing I described above.&nbsp;
Never</b>
<br><b>have I seen anything that could match the swift agility in which</b>
<br><b>it ran across the road.&nbsp; And if my feelings on the subject
are</b>
<br><b>correct, it was running *from* something.&nbsp; I trust these</b>
<br><b>feelings, because I've never been wrong of the situations where</b>
<br><b>I've been able to confirm my gut instincts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't feel any particular menace or danger
from the</b>
<br><b>situation as a whole, but I have this nagging curiosity to know</b>
<br><b>what it was that I saw.&nbsp; If anyone has any information, or
cares</b>
<br><b>to relate any similar experiences, by all means please do so!</b>
<br><b>My email address is: OpaqueOphelia@aol.com ~ please put "Imp" in</b>
<br><b>the subject line so I know its not more spam.&nbsp; Thank you</b>

<p><b>Little Megan Just Wants to Play</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: Moore0531@aol.com</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friemd
Carl's house is haunted by many ghosts. I have seen alot</b>
<br><b>of them myself. The first one I ever had experiences with is a little
girl</b>
<br><b>who's name is Megan. One of the nights when I stayed the night at
his house,</b>
<br><b>I was sleeping in a room by myself and I started to feel a little
tap on my</b>
<br><b>leg. The next day I asked Carl if he was playing a prank on me that
night and</b>
<br><b>he said, "Megan wants to play with you".I was kind of confused because
he has</b>
<br><b>a little sister who's name is Megan too. After about 10 seconds
he told me</b>
<br><b>about a little girl ghost who's name is Megan. He told me that&nbsp;
about 50</b>
<br><b>years before they moved in, there was a fire in the house, so she
hid in a</b>
<br><b>closet and when the fire got into the closet, she was stuck in it
and died.</b>
<br><b>He said she was about 7 years old when it happened abd that she
has been</b>
<br><b>haunting the house eversince. Hopefully you believe this story because
it is</b>
<br><b>all true. Thanks for your time.</b>

<p><b>Mrs. Hamilton</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>By: debora.parker@wcom.com</b>
<p><b>I grew up in Washington D.C.&nbsp; We had so many abnormal happenings
in our</b>
<br><b>house, we actually named our ghost Mrs. Hamilton.&nbsp; One very
early morning,</b>
<br><b>just before dawn, my mother and two of my sisters were in the downstairs
bed</b>
<br><b>together.&nbsp; The room that was made into a bedroom was situated
where the head</b>
<br><b>of the bed was against a wall and the foot was toward the stairs.
It was</b>
<br><b>probably five feet between the foot of the bed and&nbsp; bottom
of the stairs.</b>
<br><b>The stairway was walled in whereas you couldn't see anybody going
up or down</b>
<br><b>unless they were on the very last steps.&nbsp; When you get to the
bottom of the</b>
<br><b>step, there was the walk way at the bottom that led past the bed
into the</b>
<br><b>living room.&nbsp; Anyway, my mom and sisters all woke up at the
same time to see</b>
<br><b>a light on in the stairwell.&nbsp; Neither knew that the other was
woke.&nbsp; They</b>
<br><b>assumed it was my aunt coming down. Then they noticed that the light
was</b>
<br><b>getting brighter.&nbsp; My mom said she thought my aunt had a candle
in her hand.</b>
<br><b>When it reached the bottom of the stairs, they all said they saw
a woman in</b>
<br><b>white.&nbsp; They never heard a footstep.&nbsp; When the woman came
around the foot of</b>
<br><b>the bed, they saw that she was around 6 inches of the floor.&nbsp;
She floated</b>
<br><b>into the living room. After much crying and hugging each other,
needless to</b>
<br><b>say, they stayed up until full daylight and checked the living room
and no</b>
<br><b>one was there.&nbsp; A few years later, my sister and I were in
the same room,</b>
<br><b>different bed, and woke to hear the dog barking towards the living
room.</b>
<br><b>The dog's hair was standing straight up on his back, and he was
growling and</b>
<br><b>running just to the door leading into the living room and back to
us.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>my sister calmed the dog, we heard a shuffling sound in the living
room as</b>
<br><b>if someone was walking in a circle without lifting their feet all
the way</b>
<br><b>off of the floor.&nbsp; We were terrified that a burglar was in
the house.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>heart was in my throat.&nbsp; My sister gave the dog the 'sic em'
command, but</b>
<br><b>the dog would not go into the room.&nbsp; We weren't sure that it
wasn't my</b>
<br><b>brother playing tricks, but our dog would not respond that way if
it was.</b>
<br><b>We finally cut on all of the lights downstairs and peeped into the
living</b>
<br><b>room and no one was there.&nbsp; The windows were locked and the
door was bolted</b>
<br><b>on the inside.</b>
<p><b>Eventually we moved into a larger house a few doors down.&nbsp; Our
ghost, Mrs.</b>
<br><b>Hamilton, moved with us.&nbsp; Once the same sister (strangely,
I have three</b>
<br><b>other sisters but weird stuff always happens with the oldest one)and
I was</b>
<br><b>upstairs in the bedroom with the door closed looking at TV.&nbsp;
The light in</b>
<br><b>the bedroom was off, but the light in the hallway was on.&nbsp;
The bathroom was</b>
<br><b>next to the bedroom.&nbsp; At the same time, we both looked toward
the bottom of</b>
<br><b>the door and saw the shadow of footsteps going into the bathroom.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>were six kids and two adults living in the house at the time, but
we</b>
<br><b>instantly knew it was not a living person.&nbsp; We waited a few
minutes to see</b>
<br><b>if anyone would leave the bathroom, but know one ever came out.&nbsp;
We both</b>
<br><b>looked around the bathroom and the other rooms and no one was there
but us.</b>
<br><b>Another time we heard glass break downstairs (same sister again).&nbsp;
Again, we</b>
<br><b>thought someone had broken into the house.&nbsp; We were so scared
we had</b>
<br><b>considered climbing out on the roof and jumping into the backyard.&nbsp;
When we</b>
<br><b>finally got up the nerve to go downstairs, we assumed the window
was broke.</b>
<br><b>There was no glass to be found downstairs, upstairs or anywhere.&nbsp;
There was</b>
<br><b>however, a substance on the floor that looked like it could have
been blood.</b>
<br><b>Again the doors and windows were locked.&nbsp; Sometimes when I
came down the</b>
<br><b>stairs in that house I always felt that someone was coming down
behind me.</b>
<br><b>I use to just RUN down the stairs. I wasn't scared a lot just being
upstairs</b>
<br><b>or just being downstairs, it was the coming down the steps that
had hair on</b>
<br><b>the back of my neck standing up.</b>
<p><b>Strange things always happens around this particular sister.&nbsp;
Even in our</b>
<br><b>grown up lives, (she is in her late forties) she still generates</b>
<br><b>supernatural phenomenas. Strange things happen when she is around.&nbsp;
Once she</b>
<br><b>walked past a can of beer and it flipped completely on it's top.&nbsp;
She can</b>
<br><b>walk past a picture and it will fall off of the wall.&nbsp; My other
two sisters</b>
<br><b>shared a house that they claimed was haunted.&nbsp; And it was,
particularly when</b>
<br><b>my oldest sister was there.&nbsp; I truly believe she has that certain
energy</b>
<br><b>that attracts the supernatural and/or disaster.&nbsp; When stuff
start falling</b>
<br><b>apart around her she just shrugs and says "stuff happens".</b>
<p><b>My family is full of ghost tales and I have many more to tell at
a later</b>
<br><b>time.</b>
