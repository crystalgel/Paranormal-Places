<P><B>		Well, it all started a few months after we moved in.  First </B>
<P><B>it started with the refrigerator spiting ice cubes at me only, and
no one </B>
<P><B>else.  From there my room windows would shake like a sonic boom, but
no one </B>
<P><B>else would have that same experience!  Then one night when I was sick
and </B>
<P><B>laying in my room with the door shut, the lamp shade started moving
violently </B>
<P><B>then suddenly came to a halt as if it never had even started.  Then
a few </B>
<P><B>minutes later (as if I wasn't freaked out enough)! My radio turns on
to some </B>
<P><B>weird opera station.  I hate opera!  Then one night I was trying to
sleep and </B>
<P><B>I heard foot steps and voices in the kitchen when everyone else was
asleep.  </B>
<P><B>Then another night I also was trying to sleep and kept getting the
feeling </B>
<P><B>someone was watching me!  Then I rolled over quickly and I saw a cloudy
</B>
<P><B>figure standing over me!  It appeared to be a women in some kind of
peach </B>
<P><B>80's looking dress.  She has appeared to me a few times getting further
and </B>
<P><B>further down the hall each time I looked up from typing on the computer
</B>
<P><B>getting that same feeling someone was watching me!  		</B>

<P><B>Hi I believe I have had an encounter, at least once, that I am </B>
<P><B>sure of.. My Sister had a friend who claimed to have a haunted house.
I </B>
<P><B>wanted so to believe in ghosts and had always wished for something
to </B>
<P><B>happen when I was there. The sounds of a skeptic. Anyway, I </B>
<P><B>was picking up my sister from her friends home and sat on the couch
for a moment </B>
<P><B>until they had finished up their television show that they were watching.
I had </B>
<P><B>never talked about the house being haunted with the woman who had lived
there </B>
<P><B>until later that night. As I sat on the couch facing forward I got
this </B>
<P><B>terrible stomach turning feeling that can be described like a big knot.
I with </B>
<P><B>all my being wanted to look to my right, but was terrified to. This
lasted maybe </B>
<P><B>2 to 3 minutes before I said something to the woman that lived there.
I </B>
<P><B>just straight out asked (without looking!!) What was to my right? (besides
the </B>
<P><B>hallway that lead into the kitchen) She asked me if I really wanted
to know, </B>
<P><B>then I should look. The feeling didn't go away in my stomach and the
woman </B>
<P><B>told me that someone was standing there (meaning a ghost) Terrified
I sat there </B>
<P><B>not looking to my right, only for about 30 seconds and then I told
me myself to </B>
<P><B>just look or go over there. I had asked if the woman living there with
me would </B>
<P><B>walk over there BUT ONLY IF SHE WAS IN FRONT OF ME AND MY SISTER IN
BACK OF ME. </B>
<P><B>They were more than willing to do this since they were both used to
this entity </B>
<P><B>and knew that it wouldn't cause any harm. We walked over and the woman
</B>
<P><B>living in the house told me to stop right where I was (the threshold
of the </B>
<P><B>kitchen) and smell. I did and I smelt nothing at all. She told me to
take on </B>
<P><B>step forward and smell again. All of a sudden my heart started pounding
the knot </B>
<P><B>in my stomach got tighter and my eyes began to water. What I smelled
was the </B>
<P><B>most beautiful smell. It was just like having every flower in the world
</B>
<P><B>right at my nose. Very overwhelming, but beautiful at the same time.
From the </B>
<P><B>sheer shock I held my breath and began to cry (I'm a big baby!) and
within 2 </B>
<P><B>seconds the smell was completely gone. If this had been just a cruel
joke the </B>
<P><B>smell would've lasted a bit longer than 2 seconds, an aerosol can or
candle just </B>
<P><B>wouldn't have smelled quite so clean. The woman that lived there said
</B>
<P><B>that it was a woman that used to live off the land where the house
now stands, a </B>
<P><B>quacker woman or something, but truly the oder was amazing. The Quaker
</B>
<P><B>lady had gone to the basement and wouldn't come back because she saw
how </B>
<P><B>frightened I was. I asked my sisters friend to bring her back, because
I </B>
<P><B>was alright, but the ghost just wouldn't. Believe me, I was alright
with it! My </B>
<P><B>sisters friend also had 2 other ghosts in the house at the same time,
I have </B>
<P><B>never seen or experienced anything with them but her son used to play
with his </B>
<P><B>power ranger friend. In fact this was a small boy, the other being
</B>
<P><B>an evil ghost living in the upstairs room, this one was just not </B>
<P><B>nice and noone wanted to be in the room. In fact, some kind of blue
light </B>
<P><B>was luminating out of the window (which you could see from the street
at times) </B>
<P><B>I was never able even to go up the first stair from fright. Needless
to </B>
<P><B>say I have never gone back to the house but since the woman living
there had the </B>
<P><B>home cleaned and moved out soon after. </B>

<P><B>At Peace on Christmas</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:Anonymous</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had a wierd experience when I was eight years old.</B>
<P><B> It was Christmas eve 1985, and my older brother and I were told to
go to</B>
<P><B>bed before Santa arrived.  We went to bed and later that night, I
started</B>
<P><B>to have nightmares, and began to sweat.  I soaked my pjs and my bed
with</B>
<P><B>sweat.  My grandma always told me to pray to Jesus (we were Catholic)when
I</B>
<P><B>was scared so he could send an Angel to protect me.. I started to pray
and</B>
<P><B>peeked over my sheets towards my closet.  When I looked, the closet
door</B>
<P><B>had opened all the way, the clothing on the hangers seperated to where
the</B>
<P><B>wall was visible from behind. And right smack in the middle of the
wall was</B>
<P><B>a green thing..it glowed bright green and was in the shape of a
crucifix.</B>
<P><B>When I saw that, I started crying and yelling for my brother to wake
up..I</B>
<P><B>screamed for my mom and dad, and yelled for someone to help me..I was</B>
<P><B>unable to move from my bed..it was like I was frozen.  Then all of
a</B>
<P><B>sudden, it glowed brighter, and I felt this calm, serene feeling..it</B>
<P><B>somehow put me at ease, and I went back to sleep.  The next morning,
I went</B>
<P><B>running to my parents room in tears asking why they didn't come to
me the</B>
<P><B>night before..to this day, my parents do not remember even hearing
me, nor</B>
<P><B>does my brother..I showed my parents my closet, and told them what</B>
<P><B>happened..they never believed me..I know what I saw, and to this day,
I am</B>
<P><B>convinced it was some sort of aparition. My brother and I were too
short to</B>
<P><B>even reach the clothing in the closet, much less have the ability to
push</B>
<P><B>the clothing to opposite sides of the closet..if you ask me, I
experienced</B>
<P><B>something that night..I have no idea what it was, and it has not
happened</B>
<P><B>since..</B>

<P><B>Basement Shadow</B>
<P>
<P><B>By;Anonymous</B>
<P><B>I've not experianced much.  I just wanted to give you this little story
that </B>
<P><B>happened about 7 years ago.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was 5 years old and I had just gotten home from kinderguarden school.
 I </B>
<P><B>went down to the basement, where I lived with my mother and my brother.
 No </B>
<P><B>one was down there but me.  The only light there was was the light
that </B>
<P><B>filtered in from the small windowed in the kitchen/living room (the
both </B>
<P><B>connected, or they were in the same room).  I looked up at the wall
near the </B>
<P><B>top of the reftigerator.  And there, stood an erie shadow in the shape
of a </B>
<P><B>miny troll.  "Wierd,"I thought.  I looked all over the room trying
to find </B>
<P><B>what was making this shadow but found nothing.  I only saw this for
a few </B>
<P><B>weeks but after that, it stoped.  I've never seen it again.</B>

<P>
<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<P>
<P><B>A couple of years ago I had my first and so far only experience with
the</B>
<P><B>supernatural.  First a little background, I live next to a canal and
at</B>
<P><B>night I get light from street lights reflected up through my window
in that</B>
<P><B>moving watery way.  I am also a fairly heavy sleeper and hardly ever
wake up</B>
<P><B>in the middle of the night.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>It was a Thursday night no different from any other I was in bed asleep
as</B>
<P><B>usual when....guess what... I woke up.  The way my bedroom was laid
out I</B>
<P><B>had a digital clock facing me so I know it was 2:36 am.  I'm sure you
know</B>
<P><B>that in this kind of situation you realise that its the middle of the
night</B>
<P><B>and take great pleasure in going back to sleep, I however felt odd.
 I can</B>
<P><B>not explain it any better then that I simply felt odd, I was laying
on my</B>
<P><B>left side facing away from my door.  As I laid there awake and a
little</B>
<P><B>confused as to what I was feeling for no real reason I looked over
my right</B>
<P><B>shoulder in the direction of the corner of my bed/doorway and there
standing</B>
<P><B>silently was what I can only describe as a monk.  He was wearing the
long</B>
<P><B>robes with the cowl covering his bowed head.  I was initially startled
as</B>
<P><B>you'd expect but then I felt.... safe.  I was not afraid, I had no
desire to</B>
<P><B>run because it did not feel at all threatening.  It was solid not misty
or</B>
<P><B>transparent and I could see the way the reflected light feel on the
contours</B>
<P><B>of his robes.  Then it was gone, no fading just there one second gone
the</B>
<P><B>next.  I rolled over a feel seemingly instantly back to sleep.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have always believed in the supernatural and spirit guides and as
I am not</B>
<P><B>religious the closest thing to praying I ever to speak to my spirit
guide if</B>
<P><B>I'm worried or stressed.  It sounds funny but speaking a problem out
loud</B>
<P><B>even to what might just be an empty room can be helpful in putting
it into</B>
<P><B>perspective.  Could it be this acceptance and acknowledgement of my
guide</B>
<P><B>that allowed me this glimpse at the being who is working to help me
in some</B>
<P><B>way??..</B>

<P><B>Papa's Love</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: chickie976@webtv.net (Tina)</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>     Hi.  My name is Tina.  My story has to do with my two year-old
son</B>
<P><B>and my father.  My father passed away May 27, 1999.  My son was close
to</B>
<P><B>him and loved him very much.  He couldn't wait to see his "Papa".
 About</B>
<P><B>a week after my father had passed away, my son started doing some</B>
<P><B>strange things.  First, My son was playing in his playroom, when I</B>
<P><B>looked in to check on him he was sitting on the floor facing a chair</B>
<P><B>just talking away to the chair.  He was paying very close attention
to</B>
<P><B>whatever he was hearing.  I didn't think much of it, though.  He is
only</B>
<P><B>two years old, and I figured this is normal.   But then, my son was</B>
<P><B>playing with a toy case when he came to me saying "Mama, Papa's in</B>
<P><B>here."  I said "Where's Papa?"  And again, he replied "Papa's in
here!"</B>
<P><B>And he closed the case and carried it around with him.  And finally,
the</B>
<P><B>strangest of all, was at night when I was putting his sisters to bed.</B>
<P><B>He was down stairs in the playroom looking out the front window,</B>
<P><B>talking.  He called for my boyfriend and my son told him to look out
the</B>
<P><B>window.  When my boyfriend asked him what it was, my son said "Papa's</B>
<P><B>out there", pointing out the window.  My boyfriend asked him "Where?"</B>
<P><B>And again, my son said "There.  Papa's out there!" pointing out the</B>
<P><B>window with a big smile on his face.  When I came down stairs, my</B>
<P><B>boyfriend told me what had happened. I asked my son to show me where</B>
<P><B>Papa was.  He brought me to the window and looked out.  He paused for
a</B>
<P><B>moment, held his hands up and said "Papa's gone."       I am not sure</B>
<P><B>what to think of this.  I would like to think that my father is
reaching</B>
<P><B>out to my son because of the love they shared.  Am I just imagining</B>
<P><B>things, or could something like this be real?      </B>
<P><B>     Thank you for listening. </B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 8 years old I had a sleepover with my best friend. We
slept</B>
<P><B>down in the guest room. My mom and dad's room was at the other end
of</B>
<P><B>the hall and my room was in the middle. I could'nt get to sleep, so
I</B>
<P><B>tiptoed down to my room and got a book. I walked down to the room
that</B>
<P><B>we were slepping in a I heard footsteps. I looked round the door and
saw</B>
<P><B>my dad. They about 2 seconds later I looked round the door and my dad</B>
<P><B>was gone. And our hall was about 35 feet long. I think that it was
a</B>
<P><B>poltergeist. How my dad got down the hall without making noise is
beyond</B>
<P><B>me.</B>

<P><B>My House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: simpson@ecentral.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi! This is is my story, if you wouldn't mind posting it! Anyway, if
you</B>
<P><B>post this on your website I will love you forever! Thank you so much
for</B>
<P><B>creating a website on ghosts and stuff that really believes it. I
have</B>
<P><B>been ridiculed for my belief in ghosts before, and it is wonderful
to</B>
<P><B>find someone that doesn't think they're hogwash! </B>
<P>
<P><B>I moved to Denver about three years ago, in the fall of 1996. Anyway,</B>
<P><B>the ghost in my house started to manifest itself in the winter of
1996.</B>
<P><B>I woke up in my bedroom (which is now the guest bedroom, by the way,</B>
<P><B>because I refuse to sleep in it anymore) about 1:00 am, and glanced
over</B>
<P><B>at my bedside. There was a black, Persian-looking cat there, with its</B>
<P><B>paws propped up against the bedside so that it was standing on its
hind</B>
<P><B>paws. I'll never forget the sight for as long as I live. It's body
was</B>
<P><B>only semi-solid, but it had completely solid yellow eyes. It was
staring</B>
<P><B>at me fixedly. I don't think that it was just a trick of the light,</B>
<P><B>because of three reasons; one, those eyes. Two, it moved slightly,</B>
<P><B>closing its eyes and shaking its head in a very catlike fashion.
Three,</B>
<P><B>I moved my head to look at it better, and it stayed the same. I
started</B>
<P><B>to scream, and my father came into the room after about five seconds
of</B>
<P><B>this. I looked up for a second when he came in. I looked back down,
and</B>
<P><B>it was gone. Me and my father conducted a very thorough search of the</B>
<P><B>house, and turned up no evidence of a cat either being there or
getting</B>
<P><B>in. </B>
<P><B>After that, odd things started to happen. Only when only I was there,
as</B>
<P><B>if it was selective. Things that have happened; my cat's dish was</B>
<P><B>mysteriously moved from the floor to the kitchen sink when no-one was</B>
<P><B>home; a gray scarf-like object quickly flashed in a deserted room;
a</B>
<P><B>white skirt-like movement accompanied by rustling, resembling a wide</B>
<P><B>skirt's; I heard footsteps in my parent's bedroom, slowly walking
around</B>
<P><B>their bed; my cat sometimes stares at a point in my bedroom late at</B>
<P><B>night when no-one is there, using a Look I know when she is watching
a</B>
<P><B>threat; one night when I was in bed I felt a hand quite distinctly
on my</B>
<P><B>head; I saw a white figure in a corner in a deserted room; slinking
gray</B>
<P><B>cat shape out of corner of my eye when I was at the computer; things</B>
<P><B>will disappear, and then when I check back in a place I've checked</B>
<P><B>before, they are there; and one night I heard something resembling</B>
<P><B>footsteps walking slowly down the bedroom hallway starting at the</B>
<P><B>haunted bedroom, and stopping at my door for several minutes before</B>
<P><B>moving on. </B>
<P><B>Thankfully, it has a happy ending. A few months ago, I was sitting
at</B>
<P><B>the computer reading a story I had picked off the internet. It was
about</B>
<P><B>ten at night and everyone else was asleep. Anyway, I felt a cold</B>
<P><B>presence and was really freaked out. By this time, I felt like a</B>
<P><B>prisoner in my own house whenever I was alone. Fear turned to anger.
I</B>
<P><B>got really mad and told the ghost to get out now, and to never come</B>
<P><B>back. Nothing actually happened that night, but after about a moment
of</B>
<P><B>dead silence my anger and courage left me and I ran upstairs to bed.
I</B>
<P><B>took my cat with me to bed. I fell asleep with the radio and lights
on</B>
<P><B>and the door shut. I had the most terrible time getting to sleep that</B>
<P><B>night, because I kept feeling presences. But whenever I felt anything
I</B>
<P><B>would just tell it to go away. The most horrifying episode was when
my</B>
<P><B>cat actually stared at a corner of my bed, and I had the most
horrible</B>
<P><B>feeling of something crouching there waiting to pounce. For about a</B>
<P><B>week, the ghost seemed to gain strength; more things happened in that</B>
<P><B>week than any other time. Then he just left. The last time I saw him
was</B>
<P><B>at about six in the morning. I had gotten up early to make myself
some</B>
<P><B>hot cocoa, and was sitting at the kitchen table sipping a mug. To</B>
<P><B>explain; my kitchen has two entrances. One to the bedroom hall on one</B>
<P><B>side of the room, and the other is to the dining room and living
room.</B>
<P><B>The living room connects the two, so you can walk from one door to
the</B>
<P><B>other through the living room without being seen from the kitchen.</B>
<P><B>However, this takes a good five seconds. Anyway, so I am just sitting</B>
<P><B>there. I watch the door to the bedroom hall for no particular reason,</B>
<P><B>and see a gray cat shape leap out really quickly and then leap out
of</B>
<P><B>sight. I smiled, thinking it was only my own grayish cat. But not
even</B>
<P><B>one second later, my own cat prances in through the other doorway.
There</B>
<P><B>was no possible way for him to get from one end to the other. I can
only</B>
<P><B>conclude that he was saying goodbye.</B>
<P><B>Something else I think is related; when I am going up this one
stairwell</B>
<P><B>in my house, I feel this horrible, heart-stopping sensation of fear.
It</B>
<P><B>feels as if someone is behind me Idon't know who they want to kill
me I have to get away</B>
<P><B>I have to get away I have to get awaay away away away away. The danger
feeling seems</B>
<P><B>to emanate from a door at the base of the stairs leading outside into</B>
<P><B>the garage. Sometimes when I run up the stairs from the fear, the</B>
<P><B>feeling pursues you until about three feet away from the head of the</B>
<P><B>stairs, where it stops immediately after a final burst. The fear is</B>
<P><B>absolutely blinding, as if you are running for your life. I've asked</B>
<P><B>other people in my house about that, and they all notice nothing.</B>
<P><B>And another one; except in the hottest part of summer, when it is</B>
<P><B>almost, but not quite, the same temperature as the rest of the house,</B>
<P><B>the room I saw the cat spirit in is deathly cold. There is no</B>
<P><B>explanation, because it has the same amount of heating as the rest
of</B>
<P><B>the house. There are three thermostats in the house; one for the</B>
<P><B>bedrooms, one for the living areas, and one for downstairs. Anyway,
the</B>
<P><B>living areas are always kept warmer in the house, then the
downstairs,</B>
<P><B>then the bedrooms are the coolest. But this room is frigid. </B>
<P><B>Another, not entirely explained phenomena was once, about October of</B>
<P><B>1998, when I was trying to dowse with a pendulum. I had it set to
search</B>
<P><B>for yellow, gold, or females, but once when I held it over a red
object</B>
<P><B>it started to circle for no reason at all. It was completely reliable</B>
<P><B>for everything else.</B>
<P><B>I don't know the story of the house, but the most recent house owners</B>
<P><B>were a young couple who remodeled it completely. Then there was a FBI</B>
<P><B>agent (if I'm not mistaken) and then there was an elderly couple who</B>
<P><B>lived in the house since it was built in the 50s, until they both
died</B>
<P><B>of old age.</B>
<P><B>I'm keeping a journal now on my computer of strange happenings. </B>
<P><B>Anyway, the ghost is out. I will also be moving out sometime this</B>
<P><B>summer. Everyone else in my family loves the house, and never wants
to</B>
<P><B>move out. But I hate this house, and can't wait to move. I still feel</B>
<P><B>like the ghost is there, waiting for me. I wonder about the next
owners</B>
<P><B>of the house, and what they will go through...</B>

<P>
<P><B>By: JKeplinger@hcfa.gov</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure if this could be considered a ghost story, but here goes.
 This</B>
<P><B>incident happened about three years ago when my son was about two.
 My parents</B>
<P><B>took my son to a fair along with another couple and their two children
ages</B>
<P><B>around 7 and 10.  This couple are my parents best friends and the children
would</B>
<P><B>play together often.   When they arrived they were all starving.  They
decided</B>
<P><B>to get some hot dogs and eat.  The seven year old, *David started choking
on his</B>
<P><B>hot dog.  Everything was done to try and save him but he was
pronounced</B>
<P><B>brain-dead at the hospital and died the next day.  My son saw the whole
thing. </B>
<P><B>One night about four months later I went through the normal nightly
ritual of</B>
<P><B>giving my son a bath, reading him a story, and putting him to bed with
a kiss</B>
<P><B>and a hug goodnight.  I went out to the living room and started to
watch T.V. </B>
<P><B>with my husband.  We lived in an apartment at the time.  Not 5 minutes
had past</B>
<P><B>when I heard my son laughing.  His laughter went from a small chuckle
to</B>
<P><B>hysterical laughter within about 30 seconds.  I looked at my husband
and said, "</B>
<P><B>If I go in there and see stuff flying around the room we're moving."
 I went</B>
<P><B>into his room and he was looking up at the ceiling laughing his head
off.  I</B>
<P><B>said,  " What's so funny in here?"  He didn't even acknowledge my presence
in</B>
<P><B>the room.  He just continued to laugh.  I got his attention and asked
him again.</B>
<P><B> He said, " *David and the angels are playing up there."  He didn't
really say</B>
<P><B>anything else other than they were playing.    The laughter lasted
about 10</B>
<P><B>minutes at the most.  He continued to see him on occasion only in his
bedroom of</B>
<P><B>the apartment.  He also said that he saw, (these are his exact words)
a black</B>
<P><B>god and an orange god.  He was afraid of the black god.  He said the
orange god</B>
<P><B>didn't scare him.  The black god would ultimately send him screaming
and running</B>
<P><B>into my bed where he would sleep for the rest of the night.   He said
the black</B>
<P><B>god was mean.  My husband and I never saw anything.  We have since
moved into a</B>
<P><B>house and he has not mentioned seeing anything.  He still mentions
David.  He</B>
<P><B>doesn't mention seeing him.  He only says that he was his friend and
that he</B>
<P><B>misses him.  My husband and I don't know what to make of the incidents
that</B>
<P><B>happened in the apartment.  I don't think he could have made it up
because we</B>
<P><B>never talked about ghosts or monsters in fear of scaring him.  Thanks
for</B>
<P><B>listening.</B>

<P>
<P><B>When I was around 5 or 6 years old, I remember seeing a figure of a</B>
<P><B>woman standing outside of my room. The living room was the next room</B>
<P><B>from mine. I  always thought it was just light coming from outside
the</B>
<P><B>windows in the living room, but when I went up to the light figure
and</B>
<P><B>tried blocking the light with my hand, nothing would happen. The
light</B>
<P><B>would still be there. I wasn't scared, because I wasn't aware of
ghosts</B>
<P><B>when I was around that age. But as I got older, maybe around 9 or 10,
I</B>
<P><B>sometimes would sleep in the living room, on the couch, because my
room</B>
<P><B>would get really hot in the summer. Well as I would lie on the couch</B>
<P><B>getting ready to fall asleep, I would hear things in the kitchen,
like</B>
<P><B>the sound of someone placing a glass on the table. I would sometimes
go</B>
<P><B>see if anyone was there, but nothing would be there. I still hear the</B>
<P><B>sounds in the kitchen sometimes. And when I would be home alone, I
would</B>
<P><B>sometimes go into the basement and watch tv or exercise. As I would
work</B>
<P><B>out or watch tv I would sometimes here footsteps above me seeing how
the</B>
<P><B>tv was right below my room. But what happened to me 2 months ago</B>
<P><B>terrified me. I'm 17 years old now and It was raining harshly in the</B>
<P><B>middle of April, and I was working on an art project in the dining
room</B>
<P><B>which was the room after the living room. I was home alone at that
time.</B>
<P><B>My mother was picking up my sister from work, and my father was
working.</B>
<P><B>As I was working on my art project on the table, the lights went out,</B>
<P><B>and as soon as they went out, in front of me I saw a woman sitting</B>
<P><B>across from me. I couldn't see her clearly, but she seemed to be</B>
<P><B>smiling. About a second later the lights turned back on. I was so</B>
<P><B>scared, I ran into the kitchen and stayed there until my mother and</B>
<P><B>sister came back. When they finally returned I told them about what
I</B>
<P><B>saw, and my sister kind of freaked out, because she hates hearing
about</B>
<P><B>things like ghosts and other things related to that. My mother told
me</B>
<P><B>it was probably just my nerves and that I've been working too hard
on my</B>
<P><B>project. I believe what I saw, was real. I don't know what this ghost</B>
<P><B>lady is doing in my house, but she seems to bring attention to me only.

<P><B>By: ARIANE414@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>This is just one account from over 40 experiences I have recorded in
my </B>
<P><B>"ghost" journal.  It was a very unusual day in Chicago, Only 4 days
in to the </B>
<P><B>New Year and in the middle of winter, it was 63 degrees. Yet the skies
were </B>
<P><B>dark, eerie, gray black but there were tons of  fluffy clouds!  My
friend </B>
<P><B>Christine and I  decided to enjoy this rare day, and go walking around
the </B>
<P><B>park.We watched as the clouds seemed to speed  across the sky and realized
a </B>
<P><B>storm was near.  Somehow, the conversation switched to cemetaries.
 She told </B>
<P><B>me of an OLD German cemetary that was near the park that she had gone
to.  </B>
<P><B>They have a section of infant graves from the late 1800's to early
1900's.  </B>
<P><B>She noticed the babies died in groups, around the same times.  After
hearing </B>
<P><B>this, I wanted to go see for myself..  She told me where to go, and</B>
<P><B>as I  drove into the cemetary, I pointed to a corner and asked her
if that is </B>
<P><B>where they were.  She said yes.  I'd NEVER BEEN  THERE BEFORE!  I don't
know </B>
<P><B>how I knew.</B>
<P><B>We parked on the road, got out and looked around. Some of the graves
were so </B>
<P><B>old and worn, the names and dates hardly visible. The baby section
was so sad </B>
<P><B>to see, and we figured there must have been a plague of some sort in
the </B>
<P><B>area.  It was beginning to get dark ,  even though it was about 4pm
in the </B>
<P><B>afternoon.  The cemetary closed at 5, so we wanted to hurry and see
</B>
<P><B>everything before they closed and before the storm came.   We were
walking </B>
<P><B>thru the cemetary when it felt like the temperature had dropped 20
degrees in </B>
<P><B>a few minutes.  I stopped in my tracks and noticed a familiar smell.
 the </B>
<P><B>scent became stronger and I realized it was roses.  I asked my friend
if she </B>
<P><B>smelled anything.  She said yes.  I asked her what did she smell? 
And she </B>
<P><B>said ROSES!  I was bending down to smell the flowers on a grave, (which
were </B>
<P><B>not roses) I wanted to figure out WHERE the smell suddenly came from.</B>
<P><B>Christine asked me why was I sniffing FAKE flowers, real flowers are
not </B>
<P><B>permitted in Winter in the Cemetary.  i realized something strange
was </B>
<P><B>happening.  I walked away from the area of the smell, and it got fainter.
 I </B>
<P><B>walked toward a certain grave, and it got stronger. I began to get
a perfume </B>
<P><B>headache.  I touched all the flowers to</B>
<P><B>see if just one, ONE of them, could have been a real flower.  All were
fake.  </B>
<P><B>We got spooked as the winds picked up and it started to rain.  And
the rain </B>
<P><B>did not dilute the scent of roses.  It was a wierdly beautiful experience.
 I </B>
<P><B>stood mesmerized in the rain,  as my friend asked me what it all meant.
I </B>
<P><B>said, either a child's spirit,  an encounter with an  angel, or somebody
just </B>
<P><B>died........</B>
<P><B>I got proof of an answer 11 months later....ARIANE @AOL.COM</B>

<P><B>Church Lady Ghost</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: sugarek@cbc.cc.tx.us</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>This happened to my fiance about 37 years ago in Karnes City, Texas.
He was about 5 years old </B>
<P><B>and was attending a church function with his grandparents at the St.
Paul's Lutheran Church </B>
<P><B>there. He was running around with two of his slightly younger cousins,
having a good time. This </B>
<P><B>function was taking place out of doors. Now there were actually two
church buildings there. A </B>
<P><B>new church had been built and the older wooden structure was still
standing close by and being </B>
<P><B>used exclusively for storage. The church had been collecting clothing
and had put it in the </B>
<P><B>older building. </B>
<P><B>Anyway, my fiance and his cousins had been told to </B>
<P><B>stay out of the churches, but being little kids and the adults having
their </B>
<P><B>attention taken up with visiting, the boys decided to "explore" the
old church. </B>
<P><B>They went into the older building and looked into the large room where
the </B>
<P><B>clothing was piled on 3 tables. My fiance said the first thing he noticed
was </B>
<P><B>the clothing on one of the tables agitating violently. And he could
see a lady, </B>
<P><B>who just happened to be transparent, sorting through the clothes that
were </B>
<P><B>shaking! All that he remembers of her appearance is that she was a
motherly- or </B>
<P><B>grandmotherly-looking figure with a high-necked dress and her hair
pulled back </B>
<P><B>in a bun. She paid no attention to the 3 little boys but they ran out
of their </B>
<P><B>as fast as their feet would carry them! He says he may have been the
only one to </B>
<P><B>see the lady. He thinks the other 2 boys just saw the clothes shaking
on the </B>
<P><B>table.</B>
<P><B>My fiance says that he believes that the only </B>
<P><B>reason the clothes were shaking was because of the ghost. The windows
were all </B>
<P><B>closed, there were no fans, and of course no central cooling system
in this old </B>
<P><B>building. And remember that the clothes on the other tables were laying
</B>
<P><B>still.They went to tell their grandmother about the </B>
<P><B>situation. Naturally they got chewed out for being where they weren't
supposed </B>
<P><B>to be. And were told that no one was in that building. But they remember
it </B>
<P><B>well!</B>

<P><B>Haunted House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: DialRp0013@cs.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story is one that may or may not be scary to you. It's more of
a mystery </B>
<P><B>to me and my friends. When I was young me and my cousin were always
together </B>
<P><B>and trying to scare each other. It just so happens that there was an
old </B>
<P><B>house which my grandfather had built in the early 1900's which we thought
may </B>
<P><B>be haunted. It should be mentioned that I am from a small town in Virginia
</B>
<P><B>and in the early 1900's was pretty isolated from the rest of the state.
My </B>
<P><B>grandfather was a Pastor of the local church, being that the church
was very </B>
<P><B>big and my grandfather's house was he would have wakes or funerals
in his </B>
<P><B>den. The house was very big and there was plenty of room for people
to attend </B>
<P><B>these funerals. Anyway my cousin and I used to see things through the
windows </B>
<P><B>which we could not explain. The house had not been lived in in many
years </B>
<P><B>when we would see these unexplainable lights. They were blue in color
and </B>
<P><B>seemed to go from window to window when we were looking at them. We
finally </B>
<P><B>got the nerve to sneak into the house, which probably wasn't too smart.
</B>
<P><B>Anyway we had to enter through the basement in order for my father
to not see </B>
<P><B>us trying to get inside.  This was very scary because there was no
</B>
<P><B>electricity and we had to try and make it through the dark and up the
stairs </B>
<P><B>to the entry of the den.  We did this several times and on some occasions
we </B>
<P><B>heard and seen strange things and sometimes we didn't. On one occasion
we </B>
<P><B>were in the house and we heard a tapping on the ceiling upstairs as
if </B>
<P><B>someone was hitting it with a cane. This was very odd because my father
had </B>
<P><B>lived in the house as a child and said his uncle lived with them and
he had a </B>
<P><B>cane. When he needed something he would tap it on the floor for someone
to </B>
<P><B>come and help him.  This scared the living daylights out of us, but
my cousin </B>
<P><B>was a little more courageous than I was and he persuaded me to go up
the </B>
<P><B>stairs. When we got there he asked whatever it was that we were seeing
and </B>
<P><B>hearing to leave us alone in the name of the lord Jesus Christ. The
sounds </B>
<P><B>stopped and we left the house.  My father was a little skeptical about
the </B>
<P><B>whole thing but he felt there may be some truth in it. He himself saw
a </B>
<P><B>ghostly apparition which he can't explain. This is coming from a man
who is </B>
<P><B>himself now a preacher and I don't think he doubts seeing this at all.
I </B>
<P><B>really feel there is some connection to the noises and sightings with
the </B>
<P><B>funerals that were held in that house. There are other occurrences
which have </B>
<P><B>happened but would take a while to tell them all.  I have read in other
</B>
<P><B>experiences about blue lights being represented with the supernatural.
This </B>
<P><B>story may not be that scary to some of you, but to me and my cousin
we know </B>
<P><B>that there is something paranormal about that house.</B>
