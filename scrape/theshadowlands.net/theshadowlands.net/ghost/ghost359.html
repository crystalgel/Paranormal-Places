<p class="MsoNormal">I am new to the site and I have read many of the stories
posted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to share my
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the past five years
myself, my son who is turning 6 and my daughter who will be 2 this fall have
lived in a small cottage style house with a full basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first weekend that I moved in, I of course
had a party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son stayed with my
parents for the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also had a
roommate for the first two months that I moved in to the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had a cordless phone in the basement and
I had a regular phone upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
our guests left for the evening I took the cordless phone upstairs to make some
calls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I went to bed I left the
phone on the floor in my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
morning I heard someone walking up the basement stairs, my bed was on the other
side of the wall that lead to the basement. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I heard the footsteps walk through the
kitchen, small dining room and into the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had my bedroom door shut and I tried to
call out to my roommate to tell her to come in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thought that she was looking for the phone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then that I realized that I couldn't
open my eyes, move or speak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard the
footsteps pass thru my doorway, the door never opened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I noticed that the closer they got to my bed
that the floor appeared to be shaking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence the shaking ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
auditory comparison I can give is it sounded like when my dad would do laundry
and try to cram 20 pairs of jeans in a washer that held 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole machine would shake and you could
hear it all over the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bathroom
floor would even vibrate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is what
this felt like to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realized that
whatever it was, was standing over me and soon I felt a hand resting on my
hip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just a gentle pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think that "he" was trying to see
who was in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that moment, I
was extremely terrified and still couldn't move, speak or open my eyes, there
was a banging on my window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The noise
stopped and whatever had touched me let go.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I jumped out of bed and there was nothing in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently my dad had been standing outside
for 10 minutes banging on the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never heard him pull into the driveway, which is right outside my window, or
knock on the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said that he
had tried to call us and I had never heard the phone ring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never had this happen again until just the
two nights ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter and I share
a room and around two in the morning she woke up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could hear her cry out Mama and I tried to
get up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was paralyzed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't move anything but to lift my head
off the pillow briefly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realized that
the floor was shaking again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to
open my eyes to look at it and I couldn't.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I believe that it was looking into the crib at my daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't feel anything evil but I don't think
it wanted me to see it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about five
minutes the shaking stopped and my daughter was back asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It all seemed so strange that I even
considered that I was maybe dreaming it all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I checked the crib, my daughter seemed fine and nothing was out of
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Some other just normal haunting things I have experienced
are footsteps and cabinets opened when I know that I left them closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost seems to like my kids and likes to
check up on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I smoke so during the
winter when it is cold I go down into the basement and smoke by the back cellar
steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have often heard footsteps go
from one bed room to another, but they never go back out of the last room they
entered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also when my daughter was in
her baby swing, anytime I went downstairs I would hear footsteps walk over to
the swing and stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are always too
heavy and slow to be my son's. Also when ever I hear them and go back upstairs,
he is soundly asleep in his room so I know that it was never my son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There have been a few times though that I
felt that I was unwelcome in the basement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I feel like I am being watched in there and that something doesn't like
me to be there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have also felt that
feeling walking past my kitchen at night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It's like someone is standing there watching me and this thing seems
very cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never been harmed or
felt completely threatened by anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My son has complained of being scared but if he has seen or heard
anything he doesn't tell me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just
wanted to share our story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are moving
in a month so it will be interesting to see if the people that end up renting
my house have any experiences too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It Wanted In</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ActsofAngels10@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'd like to start by saying that I don't know much about the
supernatural but I know something's been going on that I can't explain since I
was a little kid stuff like this has been going on, so I'm going to pound out a
few lines . Let me start by saying I have nothing to gain for telling you this
other than to just get it off my chest,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was the early part of the 70's yeah I'm that old !.
Anyway's I think I was about 6 my mom and dad went away for the weekend and
left my brother ( Eddie) and his new wife to watch over me my 10 year old
sister (Anna) and 13 year old brother (Frankie).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Frank was out for the night with his friends and me and Anna
got to stay up late because my brother Eddie got drunk with his wife and took
some pill's I think they use to call them red's back then ( It was the 70's) I
would have never let them run a day care? And if my parents knew they would
have never let them watch us kids?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now it's about 2 A.M. and me and Anna are watching TV Eddie
and his wife are passed out on the couch when we both heard something at our
back door like trying to open it, I have to tell you something about our back
yard it was great during the day real big with a high 6 foot fence around it
must have been a good 40 yards long and 20 wide with a really big tree in the
back corner and a small raised hill in the center we lived on the coast so at
night during the winter the fog would come in and what seemed like a great
place to play during the day would become creeper than a graveyard at night,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When me and Anna heard the noise we just stop watching TV
and looked at each other for a second than we both looked back at the couch
where Eddie and his wife were asleep</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we didn't want to wake them up because we knew Eddie would
get mad and make us go to bed being that it was way past are bed time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">just than the noise seem to stop but me and my sister were
already frighten by what we heard so we got up I think she got a knife or
something like that and I got this ashtray that was also a sword when pulled
out of it's holder and we walked to the kitchen where our back door was . The
noise had stop just when we reached the doorway into the kitchen , It was all
dark in there we couldn't see much other than the moon light coming in from the
window,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we just kind of stood there not wanting to go all the way in
I guess we felt if we left the light of the dinning room we would get hurt or
something . Than all of a sudden the door knob started moving like someone was
trying to get in real bad.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">well needless to say I think me and Anna left are shadows
behind us as we ran to my brother Eddie who was still asleep on the couch after
a minute he woke up (all pissed off) and told us what the hell were we still
doing up at this time I think it took him a little to realize what we where
saying me and Anna must of seemed frantic at this point you could tell he
didn't want to go at first but he didn't want to look like a sissy in front of
his wife so he walked to the kitchen door way the whole time balling me and my
sister out For being up so late when he got there the door knob stop turning so
me and her started getting balled out for filing a false report than the door
knob really shook hard like who ever it was on the other side was getting
pissed Eddie hit the light switch and the door knob just stop turning the
second the light went on and all was still </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Eddie walked over to the back door kind of slowly,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>although he was married he was only 16? ( he
ran away to marry his wife and wouldn't come home until my parents agreed to
let him do so ) but being that he was taking on big boy reasonability's like a wife
my parents must of thought he would be a great baby sitter ( little did they
know? ). He put his hand on the door knob and the other on the back yard light
switch he was going to time the opening of the door with the light.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He swung the door open ( the whole time the knob was
spinning ) and turned on the light</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we had a flood light in the back so when it was on the whole
back yard would light up like daylight there was nothing there nothing at all
just the still of the night and the fog that covered the ground there was a
kind of mist in the air .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">well after that me and Anna had to get to bed Eddie wasn't
to happy because we woke him up and he didn't have any more pill's ( still a
big time dope fiend ) So we went to bed not thinking anything else of what had
happen I think that's when we let it in.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Something in the corner </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next night passed without much happening my brothers
wife brought over her brother Michel we called him fat Michel ( because he was
fat ) to spend the night with us he was about the same age as my brother Frank.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didn't want to go to sleep or couldn't as I had slept late
being that I had been up all night the night before?.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Me and my brother had are own room it faced the front of the
house and we had bunk beds I slept on top because I didn't want Fat Michel
falling on me?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It must have been real late I guess around <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1 A.M.</st1:time> I was facing the wall when some one or
something opened our bedroom door and it sounded like they stood in the corner
after closing the door never turning on the light and it sounded like they had
been running for a long time really out of breath we had a dog but he couldn't
open the door and he wouldn't of been nice enough to close it behind him ether
and it didn't sound like a dog it sounded much more like a human this was going
on for a few minutes I was to afraid to turn around and see who was standing
there when from my bedroom window I could see the head lights of a car pulling
into our drive way it was my mom and dad coming home from there trip.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">from my bed I could hear the front door open and my brother
Eddie say something like how was your trip home and my mom saying how nice it
was and what a great time they had my dad was talking about the traffic and
what a drag it was coming home </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I could her them coming closer to the house the whole time
this thing in the corner was breathing really hard.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">than my mom started talking about us kids and asking if we
had been good while they were gone my moms voice getting closer to my bedroom I
new she would open the door to look in on us kids she had a thing about
blankets she would put so many on us at night would we couldn't move and we
would wake up all stiff the next morning?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>just as she open the door and turned on the light I turned away from the
wall and sat up and looked at the corner of the room where I thought I heard
the heavy breathing there was no one there but my mom at the door and she
wasn't to happy seeing me awake she told me to get to sleep right away or else
! needless to say it was hard to get to sleep that night ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The spoon box</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next night we all went to bed on time my dad was in the
air force and although he had been out of the service for some time he still
went to bed really early and we had to go to bed when he did all at the same
time, it's hard to think of how we where back then because my mom also had a
thing about going to bed before she would turn off the last light everything
had to be clean and put away before the night day that meant every last dish in
the house had to be dry and stacked .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">just as everyone got settled down for the night and I was
trying to move under a hundred blankets? someone pulled open the spoon box in
the kitchen really fast and hard everyone could hear all the silver wear slide
to the front of the box then the draw slam shut really hard it sounded like
some one was really pissed ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I could hear my dad get up saying something like what the
#@!*#! is going on here who the #@!*# was in the kitchen ( no one was aloud in
the kitchen after bed time ) I could hear him get out of bed and walk across
the hard wood floor and pass our bedroom, I didn't know who was up in the
kitchen but I knew they where going to get it from my dad ? </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I heard him go to the kitchen than a few minutes later he
went back to bed I heard my mom ask him who was in the kitchen he replied in a
low voice but I heard her say what do you mean no one was in there ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the next night the same and then again and again but then it
seem to slow down and would stop for a day or two then start right back up for
three or four nights it did that until the day we moved out ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Who turned on the light ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night we had some friends come and sleep over the house
I think we might have thought there was safety in numbers or something any way
if we thought or self's good friends we would have done the right thing and told
them to stay away, even to this day were all still good friends and they still
wont forget that house or the things that went on in it ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">that night our friends witch were Billy Bobby and there two
sisters along with there mom and dad stayed the night so I got pushed into my
sisters room along with all the other kids so it was I Billy Bobby his two
sisters and my sister Anna there mom and dad took over my room for the night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">well the lights went out I felt better knowing that there
where so many of us in the house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That feeling was soon to go ? </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I lay there in the dark everyone drifted off to sleep and
soon my eye's had become use to The dark I could see everything from the
smallest things on the floor to stuff on the night stand? </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was on a roll away bed right by the bed room door . The
bath room door was right there by her door if you were to walk out of my
sisters bed room and make a right you would end up in the bathroom</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Everyone must have went to sleep I'm looking right out into
the hall way I can see the bathroom door is open I can see the mirror on the
wall in the bathroom when all the sudden the light goes on ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But there's no one there ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">No one walked by if they did they would have to have passed
right in front of me ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And I would have heard them on the old wooden floors ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But there I was looking right at the bathroom light but no
one was there ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didn't know what to do at first ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So I called out to my mother who was already in bed for at
least an hour ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I could hear her saying something to my dad and her walking
across the floor just as she was going to open the door the bathroom light went
out right in front of my eyes ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">she walks down the hall to where I am and asked what was the
matter ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I told her about the bathroom light ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So she turns to her left and checks to see if anyone's in
the bathroom ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">she turn's on the light and kind of pokes her head around
before turning off the light she informs me that there is nobody there and to
get to sleep !</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I can hear her going back to her bedroom closing the door
and telling my dad it was nothing just me seeing things again ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I think less than a minute goes by when the light goes right
back on this time I'm looking right at it ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Still there's nobody there ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didn't want to but I called out for my mom again this time
I can tell in her voice she's really getting ticked ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">same thing happens just as she was going to open here
bedroom door the light goes back out ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I mean I was looking right at the damn thing ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This time my mom didn't bother turning on the light or
looking around she just let me know that if I got her out of bed one more time
I was going to get my lights turned off !</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She goes back to bed again this time I hear the same thing
my dad not sounding to happy when he asked what the hell I wanted this time ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Again less then a minute goes by I'm looking right at the
light now not wanting to even blink and again the light goes on right in front
of me with no one standing there or walking passed ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This time I keep my mouth shut and just look at the light for
about minutes or so then it just turned off and stayed off .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't remember ever having any sleep problems up until
then but until this day I still cant get any rest at night I'm up all night
long ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't stay up thinking about the boogie man or anything I
just can't get any sleep I take sleeping pills but I'm up to 6 a night and I'm
still waking up at 5 A.M. I take a sleep aid called ambient after a week or two
of no sleep my body catches up with me and I get one good nights rest .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Someone standing there</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night I was in bed looking out my window my bed was
pushed up against the wall, and the window was right there, There was a thick
fog in the air and I couldn't make out much except the street light .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then I felt something ? something I think we all feel at one
time or another ? I felt someone behind me just looking at me it was so strong
the hair stood up on the back of my neck and my eyes open wide with fear ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then I felt something in me I hadn't felt since this all
started I think it was courage ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And I told my self to turn around as fast as I could to see
if I could catch anyone standing there ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It took me a few seconds before I was able to do this but
when I was ready I turned my head as fast as I could .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My bedroom door had been left open because if I had to run
out I didn't want anything slowing me down and taking time to open a door would
have slowed me down ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway I seen a figure of a tall man standing in the doorway
, It was just the shadow of a person standing there ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And as fast as I turned around it was gone ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next day when I woke up the window screen I had been
looking out of the night before had been slashed with what looked like
something that had three fingers or claws ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I wondered if any of the other screens where like this so I
went around the house checking and sure enough they all had the same claw marks
or slashes ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know what did it or who did it I just know it was
done, I was young back then and you might say that,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>could account for some of the things you have read but as I have grown
older since and there has been a lot more stuff that has happen ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know if anyone will ever read this , I'm hoping that
someone does ?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">there was a lot more strange things that happen there but I
can see this page is getting longer,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and
I don't think a lot of you will stay to the end so I will stop here for now and
I hope to see that someone did take the time to share</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Experiences with the after-life</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: JoshuaAlbritton@dotd.louisiana.gov</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've had experiences with the after-life for most of my
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I seem to have a sense when it
comes to knowing when they are around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My first recollection is when I was a child at my parent's previous
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed, every so often, I
would be lying in bed either just about to go to sleep or when I woke during
the night when I'd see a white ghost-like/humanistic form in the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents would write it off as my eyes just
adjusting to the darkness, but why would I still see it after I'd been sleeping
for a while?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I haven't had that
experience since leaving that house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another experience was at a 100+ year old church in <st1:place><st1:City>Donaldsonville</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>LA.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was working with an architecture firm and was asked to go to the
church to take some pictures for an upcoming remodel of the church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was on a Monday morning and they had
just had church services the Sunday before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A co-worker and I walked in the fellowship hall area and noticed a
terrible smell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It smelled like
something died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After some
investigating, we found the kitchen sink was backed up or plugged up and was
filled with brownish, foamy water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the water was about 10-15 dead cockroaches.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We decided to take a picture of it (which I will send at a later
date).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After being grossed out for a
bit, we proceeded to take the necessary pictures of the rest of the fellowship
hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We came to a hallway which had a
restroom, an office and a storage closet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We both stopped dead in our tracks and looked at eachother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd both felt a chill run down our spine and
the hair stood at the back of our necks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We quickly took a picture from each side of the hallway and a few of the
bathroom and got out of there as quickly as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We noticed a small graveyard just outside the
back door of the fellowship hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
getting the pictures developed, the two pictures from the hallway contained a
human-like white form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could not
make out a face, but it definitely was not something wrong with the film or any
type of reflection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other picture in
the roll contained these images.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a
friend of mine, who is a photographer, examine the photos and he said there's
no way this type of image could have gotten onto the film. (I have these photos
as well) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The latest experience I've had was at a friend of
sister-in-law's house where my sister-in-law was staying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house had been the friends grandparent's
house before, but they had recently passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of her friends would come over and would
have various things happen to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night, one of the friends decided to taunt the spirits and said, "If
you're really here, prove it!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just
then, the TV remote, which was sitting on the coffee table, started shaking
and, then, flew across the room and slammed against the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I came to help my sister-in-law move
out, I was walking around the house just to see if I felt anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I walked into the den, I got that same
feeling as I usually did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something
moving caught my eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the corner was
a rocking chair which had started rocking back and forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got the girl who was living there and told
her what I'd seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that was her
grandfather's favorite chair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd sit
in it all the time and just rock the time away. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've had other feelings upon entering rooms and
buildings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I said, I guess I have a
sense for those type of things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm sure
we all do in one shape or form.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now I am familiar with the stories and myths of the Old Hag,
and of sleep paralysis, and of demons and Ouiji and spirits, in fact you might
consider me an expert on them (at least with personal experiences.) I think I
could probably write a book the size of the Bible of my experiences, but the
stories I am going to relate to you are only the ones that took place over the
span of about 6 months in a house I rented in <st1:place><st1:City>Andover</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Massachusetts</st1:State></st1:place>. As you probably know, <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State>
has a rich ghostly history, with wars fought on it&#8217;s soil and Indians
innocently slaughtered, and young girls burned at the stake for supposed
witchcraft. Boy am I lucky to live here.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well I
guess this story has a beginning, and it was <st1:date year="2003" day="8" month="6">June 8th, 2003</st1:date>, at about approximately <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4am</st1:time>. The odd thing about this is that is was the same time
and date my boyfriend was in a very serious accident, thrown 60 feet from a
vehicle and obviously went into a coma. I do not know what the actual link
between this and the haunting is, but at <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4am</st1:time>
that very morning of the accident I was sitting on the couch in my family room
with a friend, and we heard dishes being moved around in the sink, the water
running, normal kitchen sounds. I asked my friend whom I was sitting with if he
heard it too, and he said yes and we went into the kitchen to see who had
arrived (our door never locked so it was entirely possible someone had arrived
late night). No one was there and the kitchen was still enveloped in darkness,
as it should be at <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4am</st1:time>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From that
day on, we constantly heard sounds in the kitchen, dishes being washed and
stacked and put away, footsteps with no one attached to them. And all the time
there was never anyone there (anyone living anyway). In fact, there were at
least 20 times (no exaggeration whatsoever) we had friends over and they would
hear it, and say &#8220;who is here?&#8221; and I would casually answer &#8220;nobody&#8221;, and they
would get up off the couch and go into the kitchen to say hi&#8230;.and walk slowly
back to the family room and say &#8220;you&#8217;re right&#8221; </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">(usually a few shades paler than just moments before). I
would come home from work at about <st1:time minute="15" hour="18">6:15</st1:time>
every night and open the door and say &#8220;hello&#8221; </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">because I could hear people in the kitchen. There was never
anyone to greet me back. I stopped saying hello after a few weeks of that. But
the noise and disturbances did not stop there. There was at least 5 times that
the TV and radio came on out of nowhere, and they belonged to different
roommates so it could not have been the machines themselves. And always very
loud and causing everyone to jump up and shut it off, because it was so late at
night. My roommates chose to ignore the disturbances, and would poke fun at me
and say &#8220;well the ghosts aren&#8217;t hurting anyone, are they?&#8221; My roommate&#8217;s
boyfriend told me (in confidence of course, God forbid people actually believe
in this stuff) that he saw a completely black shadow/person walking around in
his girlfriends room one night while they were in bed. It just disappeared
after it walked around the room for a little while. Also, when there were no
open windows, a door slammed shut behind him once, and that really rattled him
because he tried desperately to find a reason for that occurrence, searching
for a draft for peace of mind, but never finding any.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">People who would sleep downstairs (where the kitchen was)
would hear things all night, 2 pairs of blinds fell down from the windows in
the same night (while people were sleeping, no one was touching them),
footsteps with no one ever entering the rooms, weird swooshing sounds would be
heard as well. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In fact, I know this all sounds fake and like I am crazy,
but I swear to you for those months I COULD NOT EVEN GO TO THE BATHROOM BY
MYSELF. Someone had to come in with me or stand outside (their choice). In the
loft on the third floor (where my bedroom was) one of my friends was held down
in broad daylight and whispered to by a person that was not there. Her eyes
remained open the whole time. She sensed it was a man. The time of that was
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 am</st1:time> and with sunlight streaming
into the windows. There was a few nights that we heard what I call &#8220;booming
footsteps&#8221; which would come in the door in the kitchen and walk all through the
downstairs, up the stairs to the second floor and stop. I would be in the loft
praying with all my might that it would not come up to the loft. Lucky for it,
it never did because I do not know what I would have done. My boyfriend, who
heard all of this because he lived there too (after he recovered from the
accident anyway) would have no explanation. I would say, &#8220;can you hear that!!&#8221;
and he would say &#8220;yes&#8221;. And I would say, &#8220;Then what the hell is it&#8221; and he
would say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;. No one could ever tell me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I asked the
investigators MAGIC (Massachusetts Area Ghost Investigators</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Coalition) if they would kindly come and investigate, and
they were wonderful, friendly, down to earth, normal people who came out and
offered their help (nothing like the movie Ghostbusters, even though my sister
kept humming the song while they were there!) They researched the area and
found that the house was about 100 years old, and used to be housing for the
mill, which was behind our house (which was converted into elderly housing).
Also, the area in <st1:City><st1:place>Andover</st1:place></st1:City> was seedy
(right next to <st1:City><st1:place>Lawrence</st1:place></st1:City>, which I
think has once of the highest murder rates in the whole country) so I am sure
that did not help! There was also a tragic flood in the 50&#8217;s, which people
probably died in too, and it was Indian inhabited land as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(P.S. I would recommend MAGIC to anyone who
needs help, I had no idea there would be people who would help me (for free as
I had no money at all!) and be so serious about it. I was and still am thankful
for their help. Thanks MAGIC!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now I have dealt with sleep paralysis for years (at least 11
years that I can remember) and thank God it actually never happened in that
house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Probably because I used to sleep 4 nights a week at my
parents house, or pull all-nighters out of intense fear of it happening. And
the worst part of the house was the terrible atmosphere. I am not usually a
mean person, but I had my ugliest moments in that house, and so did the people
I lived with. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now they were mean horrible lying stealing people to begin
with, but the house intensified it to the point that I could not live out the
lease, and I left. After I left, I felt like a tremendous weight had been
lifted, and have not experienced terror like I did in that house since then,
and hope never to, and would not wish it upon my worst enemy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">hi just wanted to say that yes i believe every house has a
ghost. Some people except the fact some dont i could sit here and tell many
stories its unreal. I will share one. its all true but compucated.i dont spell
reall good some times my brain thinks faster than my fingers type. i had a old
ex girlfriend who got pregnant and she couldnt have the baby witch was a boy.
so she had a option of having it and she could die or give up the baby and she
would live.well she gave the baby up. it was a boy. so years down the road i
got married andalot of wierd things happend to give a example i and my ex wife
would wake up all the nobs off of every thing would be layed in the living room
floor example... sterio stove toaster tv you name it .just weird stuff no
biggie.i yous to have poasters tacked to the wall and i worked constuction at
early morning to late night i woul shower go to bed a n the ex woul tap me on
the back and say hun you need to see this rolling over the tacks would pop out
of the wall and the posters would curll up the wall . any way back to mte point
years down the rod we moved in a small town and small apartment had two
children and one day i was shaving and my son was sleeping on my ex wifes lap
in the living room my girl was in her crib . i went to walk out of the bathroom
to go to the livingroom when i seen a little boy standing in my hall way and he
said hi daddy. then ran to the kitchen. i thought it was my son sleeping with
his mother who i thuoght got up and was running around i went to the kitchen to
scold him to go to bed. i serched the kitchen no one was there. i went in the
living room and there layed my son asleep on my ex wifes lapp she said whats
wrong i said well i thought he was running in the kitchen. she said no he has
been here the whole time that you have been in the bathroom. so i stopped and
sat down to think this over and what i came up with was that was my sons
birthday that never had a chance to live he onley came by to say hi thats the
last iv seen him in 10 years. this is true not a hoax.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our Event</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: SDaughtery@unumprovident.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Angel and I befriended each other in early elementary
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were polar opposites but
somehow became the best of friends.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Growing up, she had a very vivid imagination and always swore that there
were evil spirits and ghosts after her soul. [Yeah, that's what I said
too.]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I use to kid her about being a
horror author when she grew up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over
time, our differences began to separate us and we lost touch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we were 22 we ran into one another again
and for a while, things were back to the way they use to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were again inseparable and spent hours
talking about our adventures, relationships, screw-ups and dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few weeks of playing catch-up, we
somehow managed to get on the topic of ghosts and haunted places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was all fired-up to go to several places
in the community and spook hunt but I was not so willing; mainly because I
thought it foolish and Childs play.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Somehow, she talked me into going to this old, abandoned house by the
elementary school we'd both attended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is a very old farmhouse and it was recently purchased
and restored but shortly after the restorations were complete, the new owner
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some thought he ran off
with another woman, some thought he had ran off with a man and some thought
that his wife shot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was, the
house was about to go up for auction as the bank was going to foreclose on it
and Angel and I knew it was our best chance to check it out; me for the sheer
beauty of the house and her for the possibility of spooks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Using a trick I'd learned from an
ex-boyfriend in college, I got us in to the house undetected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With flashlights in hand, we start browsing
through this immaculate house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now I won't go into all of the specifics, but Angel's
overactive imagination was out in full force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For every little creak, crack and shuffle she heard, I could come up
with a logical explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
while, we'd made our way upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
one of the rooms, there was a bookshelf and oddly enough, there were two,
solitary books on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked closer
and there was no writing on either of them, so I went to pick one up and that's
how we discovered a secret room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
really small and I figured it was supposed to be a safe place to put
valuables.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once inside, we found a
small, bright orange ball.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
probably the size of a baseball and made out of very bouncy materials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few moments, we left that secret room
and closed the entrance back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angel was
holding the ball so I told her to put it on the book shelf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went through a few other rooms before
heading back downstairs. <span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the main entrance at the foot of the stairs we were
getting ready to leave when we heard this thud-thud-thud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figured it was air in the water pipes with
this being such an old house and all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Angel, frustrated by my lack of belief shouted "Okay, Shelly
doesn't believe in you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Give us a sign
and make her believe your real and you're here."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I rolled my eyes and was about to move when we heard the
thud-thud-thud again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like it
was coming down the landing towards the top of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both shined our lights in that direction
and saw that bouncy ball sitting at the top of the stairwell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was pretty freaky and I was trying to
come up with an explanation when all at once, the ball began moving slowly;
back and forth then suddenly started bouncing down the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must have looked like two of the three
stooges trying to get through that front door at the same time. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When we were back in my car I noticed that we'd left the
front door opened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mentioned it to
Angel who refused to go close it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gathering up my courage, I crept up towards the door hoping that I
wouldn't disturb anything any more than I already had when SLAM the door flew
all the way opened and then SLAM shut with such force that the windows
rattled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked like an Olympic
sprinter getting back to my car<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and we
peeled out of that driveway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the end
of the driveway, I stopped before pulling into the main road when I noticed in
my rearview mirror that the porch-light had come on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then got brighter and brighter, before
slowly dimming and going out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked
Angel if she'd seen it and she was literally crying.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Try as I might, I could not come up with a logical
explanation for the ball 1) making it from the shelf, taking a sharp right turn
to get out the door, then making it's way down the hall to the top of the
stairs and 2) stopping completely, then rocking back and forth before bouncing
slowly down the stairs towards us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor
could I come up with a logical explanation for the front door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was 88 degrees and with 98% humidity that
night and there wasn't any breeze and no power turned on in the house to make
the central heat and air come on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
lastly, there was nothing in my mind that could logically explain the porch
light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that event, Angel and I lost
touch again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She ended her pursuit into
the realm of ghost and ghastly happenings and ironically, I started my
own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you for reading this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I hope that it made the hairs on your neck standup the way it does mine
every time I think about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bye the
way, they never did find that missing owner and no one has purchased the house
in the 8 years since that event. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Mayberrish Southern Town</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: speedy9747@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in a typical, Mayberry-ish, small southern town in
<st1:place><st1:City>SE</st1:City> <st1:State>TN.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our home was less than 80 feet from a <st1:City><st1:place>Norfolk</st1:place></st1:City>
Southern railroad line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tracks were
on a rise in the hill and from the second story window of our home, you would
be parallel with the tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The town I
grew up in was once a coal mining camp and then grew to be a coal mining
town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Point of fact, the town's name
came from the original proprietor of the first train depot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was called Daisy after his only daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From my house, the original train depot was
situated just about a mile north and the area of the train tracks in between
was often referred to as "black track" because there were several
curves in the railway and coal was often spilled in these curves; leaving the
soil covered in the black, chalky coal residue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is purportedly haunted and there are several ghastly and ghostly
tales attributed to that area of track. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From what I've been able to gather, one story is that a
female slave was once accused of leading other slaves to freedom via the train
tracks and when her treachery was discovered by her owner, she was tied to the
tracks until a train came through chopping both of her feet off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once this was done, she was carried to the
slave quarters as an example of what would happen to all others who attempted
escape or assisted others in escaping.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Slowly, she bled to death despite the other slaves best efforts. I know
several people who would lay their hand on the Bible today and testify to
seeing her feet less body in the area. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another story is about a train wreck that happened about 15
yards from the back door of my old home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In southern TN, we do not get much snow, but we can get quite a bit of
rain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently in the late 30's a
weather front came through bringing a lot of rain and flash flooding to the
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night after the rain had
slowed to a drizzle a fully-loaded train was slowing to stop at the depot not
knowing that the ground below was giving way under its weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a flash, a large section of track sank
some 15 feet causing a massive wreck that threw debris and coal as far as 50
yards away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the initial wreck,
several railroad workers and ho-bo's were trapped in the rubble; many of them
dying before being rescued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of the
rescuers were local farmers and residents who perished as the mud shifted under
the weight of the debris and ultimately a large land and debris slide halted
all rescue efforts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As many as 50 people
perished and the old timers would say that they could hear people moaning and
screaming for help for days after the wreck and how help never came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some people swear that they can hear the
sorrowful screams and moans of the trapped on bright, still nights. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Lastly, another story about that area of tracks has to do
with teenage hormones and stupidity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Along the section of track an old half-paved road weaves back and forth
across the tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the 50's and 60's
this area of road was used by teenagers to prove the muscle in their machines
and the guts in the drivers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than
one person has perished in their efforts to outrun the train.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many people ay that those untimely deaths are
the culprits of strange flashes of light that are often seen in that area. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was in Oct.2000, my Civil War Re enacting unit was down
in <st1:place><st1:City>Moshien</st1:City> <st1:State>Tenn.</st1:State></st1:place>
doing the reenactment of the battle of <st1:City><st1:place>Blue Springs</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The original battle was in Oct. of 1864.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We were fortunate in having the event on the original
battlefield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This battle was special for
us because the unit we portray, the 8th <st1:State><st1:place>Mich</st1:place></st1:State>,
was in the original battle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was Sat night and the spectators all had gone.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was around <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9
 PM</st1:time> we were all sitting around our campfire swapping stories,
telling lies and sharing our bottles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the sponsors stopped at our fire and informed us that there had
been reports of some teenage boys breaking into vehicles in the re enactors
parking area. Several of us decided to walk down to the parking area and check
our vehicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The area assigned to us was at a bottom of a hill just below
an old pre Civil War church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The church
had an old cemetery right next to it. It was about &frac12; mile from our camping
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had to walk down a big hill to
get there, which meant we had to walk up the hill to get back to our camp. We
got there and check on our vehicles and went back to camp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the time we got up the hill I was ready to
hit the hay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my pards good night
and tried to get to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The longer I
lay there the more I was thinking that I had not locked my truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally got up and told my pards I was
going down to check if I locked my truck, and I wasn&#8217;t going to climb that hill
again until the next day and that I had decided to sleep in the back of my
S-10. It&#8217;s a good thing I did go down because I had failed to lock it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I put my sleeping pad and blankets in the back of the truck,
and was soon fast asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a mild
evening so I left the window up on the tailgate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up when someone reached in and grabbed
my hat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dropped my tailgate and
grabbed a metal bar I had back there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
I jumped to the ground I dropped the bar, and was confronted by three, laughing
teenage boys. I remember thinking, as I backed up to my truck that these guys
were going to mess me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they were
about to grab me I woke up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only
a dream. It was so real that I was shaking. Getting back to sleep now would be
difficult, so I decided to have me a smoke.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Setting there I noticed there was a ground mist that was about ten
inches deep.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I happened to look to my
left and a chill went down my spine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
saw what appeared to be a woman all in civil war era clothing floating on the
mist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she got closer I could see she
was walking so slow she wasn&#8217;t even making a ripple in the fog. As she got
closer I could she here hands clasped in front of her like she was in
prayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her head was slightly down and
what I saw was a face that seem to be sad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was plain looking but not unattractive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was wearing a light cotton day dress and
her hair was in a bun covered by a hair net that was crocheted. As she got up
to me I said &#8220;good evening, I see I&#8217;m not the only who can&#8217;t sleep tonight.&#8221;
She stopped and turned my way and said &#8220; sir, I haven&#8217;t been able to sleep in a
long time.&#8221; I stood up and offered my hand and introduced myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She took my hand and told me her name was
Bobbie Mae. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Her hand was as cold as a piece of ice. She had a very
different accent, so I asked her where she was from. She told me she was born
in <st1:State><st1:place>New Hampshire</st1:place></st1:State>, but she went to
<st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State> when she was younger to
get married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband was in the
Army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had two sons from him and when
they became men she moved to <st1:State><st1:place>Tenn.</st1:place></st1:State>
Her sons stayed with the father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
told me she worked with people, who were dying, and she had just lost a man who
was in his 80s and she was quite sad. She talked about some of the other people
she had been with when they died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She appeared cold so I reached in the back of my truck and
pick up one of my blankets to place on her shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As my hands were lowering the blanket I could
feel the cold coming from her body right through the blanket.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I asked her if she was a nurse for Hospice. She looked at me
in a strange way and said, &#8220;What is that.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I explained it to her and she told me she had never heard of it. I
thought this was a little strange but I didn&#8217;t dwell on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We talked a little while longer, I looked at my watch and it
was <st1:time minute="30" hour="3">3:30 AM</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told Bobbie I had to try to get some sleep
because I had a big day Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked
her where she was camped?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pointed to
an old pickup truck with a piece of canvas draped over the box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suggested she sleep in the cab, because the
canvas would keep the rain off but would not keep her warm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she had a blanket and she was all
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a gentleman I invited her,
if she got cold, to share the back of my truck where we could spoon and both
stay warm, my truck was completely covered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She thanked me and said she would, but her friend who was sleeping in
the cab, would worry if she wasn&#8217;t there when he woke. We said good by and she
went to her truck and I curled up in my blankets and was soon asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Something woke me up at <st1:time minute="0" hour="5">5:00AM</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got out of my truck and looked down to
where Bobbie was staying, and to my surprise there was nothing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grass was wet with dew and there was no
tire tracks anywhere to be seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
walked down to where her truck was parked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A chill went down my spine when I got there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There wasn&#8217;t enough room to put a snowmobile
let along a full size pickup.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is all true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
be the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was I dreaming, was I
drunk, or did I really see something that is out of the norm.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Strange Things</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: lindseyk312@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My name is Lindsey I
have lived with my family in this house for 4 years now and every since we have
lived here we have experienced some strange things. It seems though most things
have happened in my bedroom and i often thought my parents did not believe the
things i had told them about. The first month of living in this house my mother
awoke in the morning to find a painting of a women swimming this painting was laying
on the floor in her closet it had appeared over night she had questioned all of
us in the house and no one had seen it before. The music boxes would play
randomly in the middle of the night. Door knobs turning seconds before turning
them yourself. My bedroom door always sounded like it was opening by it's self
when it was really shut. It wasn't for a while when i actually started to see
people or should i say ghosts in my room while sleeping. I have seen a black
women wearing brown rags several times. The first i had ever seen her she was
standing at the end of my bed with her mouth wide open as if she was screaming
but i never heard a sound it felt as thought my heart had stoped. I was frozen
with fear i had rolled over and told myself it wasn't really there i was seeing
things. Then about a month later the same lady sat in a chair in m room just
watching me i had then covered my face with my pillow and went back to sleep.
In the morning i had told my mother about both times of this lady being in my room
she just kind of laughed and joked about it. she had told me that the first
time when the lady was there she was trying to tell me her teeth hurt because
i'm planing on becomming a dentist after schooling. I didn't think my mom
believed me at all. Some time after that a tall man stood next to the head of
my bed once again just staring at me, when i awoke i starting screaming and my
mother came running into my room she told me it was just a dream and to go back
to bed, but i knew it wasn't she was just saying what anyother parent would say
just to make me feel better. It was strange how my room was the only room i
ever see them in my family would make fun of me and would make stupid jokes
about the ghosts in my room. One night after my 16th birthday my sisters and i
were playing a board game in our dining room when the room filled up with a
blinding flash, we just figured my mother was right outside the window taking a
picture of something. Later that night my sister was across the hall from me
sleeping up stairs when the same flash lit up the room at 1 in the morning she
was 20 years old then she ran into my room and slept next to me she was not
sure that it was a flash from a camera anymore since we were upstairs and
everyone was sleeping. We never figured out what the flash was. When my mother
was away on vacation and i was the only one home i was sleeping and when i
awoke in the middle of the night i found myself eye to eye to a young girl who
had to have been at least 10. She had a wound in her head where her eye had
been there was a hole through her head, it was the right eye that had been
gone. This was the most frightening thing i had ever seen. I once again
couldn't do anything i was the only one home so i layed there and went back to
sleep. Once again i see the black lady except this time i find myself fighting
her in my drea the wierd thing was a mobile that was hanging above me on my
ceiling had fallen and hit me in the stomach while i sleeping. The mobile hit
me in the same spot the lady hit me at the same exact time. I still found that
my parents didn't believe me untill one night my dad traveled down stairs for a
drink at 1 in the morning and he heard some girl humming a song he thought it
was me untill he realized that he and my mom were the only ones home that
night. Later the same night at 3 in the morning my mother awoke and had to use
the rest room. while she was walking down the hall she heard a lady talking. My
parents told me about this when i arrived home the next morning and now they
believe me. We don't know who these ghosts are but we are trying to find some
histoy about our house as it was built in 1890. Maybe the history will reveal
who these ghosts are and why there here.</p>

the living room we turned in about 1.30 after about 5mins. he came to my room
and asked me to come out to the living room when i did he was looking
underneath the mattress i asked what was wrong and he said he could feel things
moving around with him when he laid down, now my brotherinlaw is a big skeptic
about anythink pertaining to ghosts ,i told him it was proberbly just the
mattress sticking to the floor and popping he said oh no something was pushing
me off it,well it was about 1.45 am by now he was dressed and on his way home
by 2am swearing hed never sleep here again.this past week<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on the 25 of june i had my son and girlfriend

<p class="MsoNormal">Before the cemetary was publicized, sectioned off, and given
a sign on the side of the road for recognition, about 30 years ago, my father
and his best friend came across the cemetary at night. They heard children
laughing, but upon looking around, found nobody. They started to leave when
they found the gravestones of two small children. Then they saw a green ball of
light floating around the cemetary. It floated toward a cattle fence, and the
two boys watched, intrigued, as the ball floated through the fence, following
the path, like a person would, instead of floating over it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">THE HAUNTED CAMP</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>my name is
Robbie<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hoffman and I was 11 years old
when my experience happened. I was going on a field trip to a place called
environmental camp and I already believed in the paranormal. when I was on the
school bus I brought my book about places where ghosts were sighted in the U.S.
A. and when I was just flipping through the pages I saw the camp I was going
to. So I told my friend beside me and he was shocked then he passed it to his
father,but he didn't say anything. About an hour later a woman passed out some
pieces of paper that had the house we were staying in when the woman gave me
the paper I thought I was going to pass out because the house<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that was haunted was the place that I was
sleeping. I then asked my friend what house he sleeping in and he got the same
house to. A few minutes later we got to the camp so the people there got us all
settled in and I was pretty comfortable until night came. The room I was
staying in was also where three other people were staying and one of them was
my friend. I couldn't sleep because I felt someone else in the room other then
the rest of my friends. so I looked around to who was there and when I was
looking I saw a shadow crossing the door and after five minutes it didn't cross
the door again because our room was at the end of the building. In the early
morning I was still awake and when I wanted to go to sleep someone said hello
right in my ear, so I looked around and my friends were still sleeping so I
didn't sleep for the rest of the day. that was my only ghost experience I had
and the house i slept was called the Quillen house in <st1:place><st1:City>Ferry
  Beach</st1:City>,<st1:State>Maine</st1:State></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I just wanted to inform you, after reading your splerb about
the <st1:City><st1:place>Anoka</st1:place></st1:City> state hospital. I am an
employee here and I have experienced the wonderful tunnel system once after
that one time I refuse to go in the tunnels again. I had my experience in
January of 2004 when I was in training one of the security officers took me on
a tour and there is a section of the tunnels that T's off and then the tunnels
go around in a circle. Well right and that point where it T's off you can feel
a major temperature change it goes from hot and muggy to really cold. Anyways
the staff members that have worked out here many years claim that there is a
lady in red the story goes that their was this young lady was a patient here
way back in the day and that she had hung herself on a pipe while wearing a red
night gown so the joke is whenever you go into the tunnels that you need to
watch out for the lady in red. So we made our way through the tunnels on my
tour and on our way back we were at that point where it T's off and this is
where you make your way down a long hall and that's where the door is to get
out and at that point my hair on my arms began to stand up and I informed the
officer that I didn't feel right and we needed to get out of their. All of a
sudden it sounded like someone was banging on the pipes, the officer informed
me it was ok and that it was just water or something going through them. Well
it started getting closer and I could tell that he was starting to get scared
to when the hair on his arms started to stand up that's when it was ok for us
to run out of the tunnels. He couldn't get the key's in the door fast enough
needless to say he nor I will ever go into the tunnels again past the entry
door. One of the other security officers had an odd experience as well I'll try
to get him to submit his story because he actually got voices on tape and him
and 2 other males got chased out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Motherly Encounter.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: xunfabulous@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been reading stories from your site for years. They
are all amazing. I have had a few encounters of my own. Mainly with places that
I had lived being haunted, or seeing things as I was driving in the darkness of
the night, or just that simple 'hair was standing up on the back of my neck'
experience. This is not one of those. This is one of those stories that gave me
some comfort, and gave me a warm feeling inside.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am 19 years old. I lived in <st1:place><st1:City>Jacksonville</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>North Carolina</st1:State></st1:place> for the longest time. I
recently got married, and moved to <st1:place><st1:City>Fayetteville</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>North Carolina</st1:State></st1:place>. My mother passed away in
March of 2004. She was only 50 years old. So very young. I never even got to
say goodbye to her, or even tell her that I loved her. I'm sure she knows that
though.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband and I were on our way to <st1:State><st1:place>Tennessee</st1:place></st1:State>.
He is from there, and it was going to be my first time meeting my in-laws. I
decided to drive the whole way, because I like driving. My husband had fallen
asleep. I had the radio on to keep me awake. I was driving at a decent pace..
seeking through radio stations to find a good song. All of a sudden, my radio
sort of just ended up on a station with static in it. I didn't think of
anything of it.. then out of the static, a song came on. It was the song
"One Sweet Day" by Mariah Carey f/BoyzIIMen. That happened to be one
of my mothers favorite songs. Just then, I started to feel all funny, like warm
inside. I looked over to Glen, to see if he was still asleep. Glen wasn't
there. My mother was sitting there. She was wearing her peach colored shirt,
her black pants, and her flip flops that she always wore. She just sort of
looked at me and smiled. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"All grown up, I see" She said to me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I sort of looked around the car, in awe.. and surprised at
the same time, cause my dead mother was talking to me, and it looked as if she
was waiting for an answer.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"I guess, I was kind of forced to." I said back to
her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"You weren't forced, Cortney. I knew you would. You
have a good head on your shoulders." She said to me, with a grin.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'm sure you are all thinking.. so your dead mothers ghost
is talking to you? YEAH RIGHT! If I was lying, I wouldn't be in tears, like I
always am, everytime I think about this.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mother just kind of sat there, looking around. I was
still driving, and I noticed that I was going about 120MPH. I decided to slow
down, so I wouldn't get pulled over.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"Have you seen Uncle <st1:PersonName>John</st1:PersonName>nie?
He isn't doing so good." I said to her, wondering if she knew, or if she
had been watching over him too.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"I know all about that. He won't be around for very
much longer." She said. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She went on to tell me that she is happy where she is, and
how everyone here is the same as they were when they were alive. She told me
that she has no worries, no pain, no hurt. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"I miss you, and your Dad." She said to me, with
tears in her eyes.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I looked over at her and just started crying. I told her how
much I missed her and loved her, and how I just wished that things were back to
the way they used to be. I had never thought of how my life would be without
her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"Pneumonia dear, it was pneumonia." She said, with
a very serious look on her face.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I kind of shrugged that comment off, cause it kind of
confused me. It was very random. I later learned that the cause of her death
was Pneumonia, with acute respiratory failure and severe sepsis to prior
wounds.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"We all love you, Toots. Take care of yourself. I am
always here, always watching, always waiting" She said. She reached over
and touched my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hand.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was the weirdest thing, but she got up, and just walked
off.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"I LOVE YOU!!" I screamed. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She disappeared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By that time, I was driving through the Gorge. I was going
about 100 through these dangerous curves, because I was still in shock from the
experience. Just then. my staticy radio station began to play the song again. I
put a CD in, with my favorite song, "Holes in the Floor of Heaven" By
Mark Willis. It was pretty much me saying telling her thank you for talking to
me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I told Glen to wake up, cause I was going through the Gorge.
I was crying, and he wanted to know why. I explained all of the things she said
to me, and everything. I'm sure he must have thought I was crazy. I know that
I'm not though.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To this day, everytime I drive to <st1:State><st1:place>Tennessee</st1:place></st1:State>,
I pray that she will come and talk to me. I haven't heard from her. I sure hope
I do, someday, soon.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I'm here to tell you about the strange occurrences that
happened to my mother at the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Lawrence</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Family</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Mansion</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
on Teddington Park Avenue in <st1:City><st1:place>Toronto</st1:place></st1:City>.
The first thing you need to know is that my mom is a down to earth, no-nonsense
type and she believes that the house was, as ALL its tenants have believed in
the past, that it is haunted.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mom lived in an apartment (Dirt cheap because it WAS
haunted) at the top of the mansion. It was, she says, extremely beautiful; High
vaulted sealings, many rooms, and spacious, too. In the kitchen there was a
mirror people called the "Talking Mirror." This was because any body
who stayed in the kitchen long enough started randomely talking to themselves
in the mirror. My mother says no matter who passed it, they started to babble.
My mom even talked to herself without realizing it until something brought her
attention back to where she was and what she was doing, making her realize she
had been talking to herself. The people never talked about anything
imperticular, anything that came to mind they would talk about.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the bottom floor a German man named Hans (I don't know
how to spell it, it is pronounced Ha-nse) who was the most serious man my mom
had ever known. My mom visited him sometimes, and often she would go into this
bathroom that was there and just study the clw footed tub that dated back to
the1930's. She got the most creepy feeling looking at it, like she could almost
see a body lying in it. She compared it to the portrait "Murder of
Marat" which is a painting of a man with his throat and wrists slit. She
told the man and he said that he heard noises comeing from it at night, and
that he KNEW it must be haunted, because he said you could almost see the
outline of a body in it. They looked into the history of the house and, sure
enough, somebody had commited suicide in the tub around the 1950's. Another
thing near the bathroom was a hall, where people would say they felt a deep
desire to run to get down it, and that before going down it you had to stop and
brace yourself, getting up your courage, like there was a wall there stoping
you from going that you had to get through.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another place in the house was a great living room. It was
in the apartment of a police man, and his girlfriend. They always argued,
mostly in that room, and one night the girlfriend took the mans gun and held it
to his head as they argued. People also reported that happy couples would go
into that room and just start fighting, over absolutely anything.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Cold spots were numerous in the house, and many suicides had
taken place there. I could tell you many other stories about various spots, but
I have to get going.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also, my mom says the house has now sold for 5 million
dollars, and that she suspects that someone tore the house down to get rid of
the hauntings and built a replica.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Hi, It's Ayme and I
would like to share another story with you. This story was told to my sisters,
my brother and I, by our grandmother when we were kids. I am now 36 years old
and the youngest of five kids. At the time we were told this story, I was about
9 years old. One day, while sitting around with nothing better to do, our
grandmother decided to entertain us and told us various ghost stories. The one
that really stuck with me happened in 1936, when my mother was only a year old.
The story that was told to us goes like this. When my mother was only a year
old her parents ( my grandparents, of course) were looking for a place to live
and found this little house near to where my grandfather worked which was
affordable. It was a small two bedroom, small living room and kitchen with an
outhouse. When they moved in they were happy to find the little house and never
expected what was about to take place. As it happens, my grandfather worked
nights ( never asked what exactly he did for a living) and was away from home
during crucial moments. Things were fine until about three nights after they
had moved in. Since my grandfather worked nights, my grandmother would allow
the baby to sleep with her. After the baby was put to bed, my grand mother
decided to go to bed too and crawled into bed next to my mom. No sooner had she
laid down, when she heard this humongous crash coming from the kitchen. She
described it as if some one had taken the dish rack full of dishes and thrown
it on the floor, so that every dish was shattered. Well, of course she went to
the kitchen to see what was going on and discovered nothing broken, or out of
place, everything was exactly where it should be. She went back to bed and
tried to put it out of her head. A few nights latter the same thing happened,
only this time there was more. After checking and finding no broken dishes
again, she went back to bed, but once she was in bed the mattress lifted into
the air about a foot and dropped back into place with unbelievable force. This
frightened my grandmother so that she grabbed my mother off the bed and left
the room quickly. She spent the rest of the night with my mother in her arms on
a rocking chair in the living room. This went on for a few nights, until one
night something else happened. Back in those days in <st1:place>Puerto Rico</st1:place>
they used padlocks on their doors, you could lock your door from the outside or
the inside with the padlock. Well, one night after checking for the
non-existent broken dishes and going back to bed, she heard the sound of a
horse galloping around the house. Again she retreated to the rocking chair in
the living room. The chair faced the door and as she watched the padlock
unlocked itself, twisted out of the loop, fell to the ground and the door
slowly opened. By this point my grandmother is so freaked out that she is
clutching my mother to her. The door opens to reveal a man, dressed in white,
leather belt and all, standing on the porch. As my grandmother looked at him,
he used his thumb in a manner to motion as if to say " get out". My
grandmother was frightened and could nothing, but sit there and stare at him.
The next morning my grand mother informed my grandfather of all these strange
things and my grandfather, believing someone was trying to scare them, decided
to hire some one dependable to guard the house. Well, the next night my
grandmother went to bed as usual and again the dishes crashing, the mattress
incident, the horse galloping and the padlock and the man on the porch. My
grandmother tried to wake up the guard, whom had fallen asleep on the couch to
no avail. The man slept like the dead. So, again my grandmother told my
grandfather and informed him that his guard had fallen asleep and would not
wake up. My grand father then decided he would stay home and find out who was
the SOB that was frightening his wife. The house had been built on a hill so
that the back of the house was on land and the front of the house was on beams
and you could walk upright under the house to a certain point. The night some
of the same things happened and my grandfather hearing the galloping horse,
grabbed his shot gun and went outside. While standing on the porch, holding the
gun at the ready said; if you're a man come out and face me. At that moment a
man and horse came out from under the house and rode right through the barbed
wire that was used as fencing around the house. My grandfather thought that
what ever rode through that fence was not human. The next morning he went under
the house and soon found a grave. After talking to the neighbors he was told
that the house had been built by a man, whom specified to his wife, the house
was for her and his kids. The man knew that he was dying and built the house
before he died. Soon after the husband died ( according to the neighbors) the
wife went insane and took off leaving her children and the house abandoned.
This is the story we were told all those years ago. When I was in my teens I
was told that due to the fact that no one could live there, the house was
eventually torn down. I hope you enjoyed this story and it doesn't give you
nightmares like it did me when I heard it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: mandaclaire@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I think that I've written you before so if I repeat myself
in anything I say here then please excuse me. I wrote your Website before
talking about my House that I felt was haunted even though everybody else
thought that I was crazy well mainly my Mom who continues to insist it isn't
haunted but a lot of thing's have been happening lately that convince me
otherwise. Normally, thing's happen once in a while but not a lot but I read
one time on your Website that Ghost's feed on emotion's of people or react to
their emotion's I'm not sure if this is true or not.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, I've always thought my house was Haunted since I moved
in when I was 9 thing's happened once in a while but not that often. I've been
with my Boyfriend a year and he recently found out he's deploying to Iraq in
the Fall for a second tour and well needless to say since I found out this
hasn't exactly been the greatest time for me emotion wise. This is going to
sound completely crazy but my emotion's are up and down everyday with this news
and I notice that more thing's are happening since I've been well more
emotional. For instance I was at work the other day and I swear I heard someone
call my name this was of course when I was downstairs by myself it was like a
whisper and the same thing happened at home.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I tend to be a skeptic so I just tried to ignore it then the
other night I was in the bathroom everyone was in bed and I heard footstep's
and a knocking noise I of course was really scared I hate thing's like that.
Then on Saturday I was home alone and heard knocking and then a door slammed of
course I was terrified I try to shut it out but something like that is pretty
hard to shut out. I refuse to go to bed till the Sun come's up my parent's
think I just like to stay up late that isn't it and I feel incredibly uneasy
when I try to sleep. My boyfriend is stationed overseas right now so I will
call him and make him stay on the phone with me for hour's since I feel that
uneasy. I know this sound's all very very crazy and of course I don't consider
myself to be the least bit psychic but I've been convinced my house was haunted
for year's but no one ever ever see's anything but me. In the hallway
downstairs there are read stain's on the ceiling that look like blood stain's
my mom insist's it's paint and that I'm crazy but the foyer isn't even painted
red!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, I'm sorry for taking your time and I realize I sound
completely crazy I guess I'm just looking for some kind of rational explanation
because right now I'm beginning to think I'm crazy. I also don't understand why
everyone is obivious to this but me so I don't really talk about it. The only
person who really know's exactly how I feel is my best friend she stayed here
one night and she was here 1 or 2 hour's, and she wokeup insisted on leaving
and refused to spend the night. This same girl 2 hour's earlier had been drunk
we were drinking at home and passed out ten minute's later she wokeup
completely sober got her stuff and left. She wouldn't say what she saw but
insisted on leaving she told me later and since then has refused to sleep at my
house. Anyway, sorry for taking your time hope I don't sound completely crazy
thank's for your help.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghost Dreams</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: MesesMom@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Although, our family does have some semi-psychic tendencies,
its rather unusual for us to actually SEE anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dreams, however, are another story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My grandmother throughout her life had a recurring dream of
standing outside her home at night and seeing a figure carrying a lantern and
walking the top rail of a picket fence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Always when she had the dream, within a few days, she would hear of a
death in the family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she grew older,
the dreams continued, until one day when she was in her 80's, she made the
comment that, "I know the next time I have that dream, they'll be coming
for me."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lived to 91 and never
said specifically, but I always wondered whether she saw that figure again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Personally, for me there are no recurring dreams, but I have
experienced losses of loved ones several times in the last ten years and almost
every time, I have had dreams where the lost one comes back to show/tell me
that they are all right.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first time occurred in 1994 when my Siamese died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had owned me for over 18 years and we were
very attached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had been ill for some
time and finally got to a point where he had both kidney issues and cancer;
euthanizing him was a mercy at that point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A week or two after he passed, I was lying in bed in the morning, in
that grey area between sleeping and waking, when I felt him lying in the crook
of my arm, his usual sleeping spot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because I knew he'd be gone when I opened my eyes, I put it off as long
as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I did, of course he
was gone, but the spot on the bed where he had been was warm and I could still
feel where his fur had been warm against my arm.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In 1996, my mother passed away after a long period of
failing health.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been her caretaker
for years, so of course there was another huge void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, a dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the dream, Mom and I were sitting in a
sunny little kitchen nook, bright flowers at the window, sipping hot cups of tea
and just chatting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, after a
brief lull in the conversation, she looked over at me, put her hand on my
forearm and said, "You know, I really AM all right?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I woke up, I felt so peaceful and warm
and reassured that she WAS ok.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Fast forward to 1997 after my husband died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not long afterward, I found myself chatting
on an online widows/widowers chat and many of my fellow chatters talked about
having seen/felt their late spouses or having dreamed of them; I myself hoped
to have an experience of that nature, but in all of my dreams, it seemed I
found myself either looking for Joe but never finding him or telling someone or
other that he was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very last
dream I had, though, I found a place where he was although he wasn't
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fond myself looking at a
whitewashed adobe-type square building on a white sandy beach, complete with
palm trees, looking for all the world like a perfect Caribbean beach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were large openings on each side of the
building with beautifully colored drapes billowing out in the breeze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside, each room was stacked with huge, soft
pillows in ice cream colors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew
instinctively that this was where Joe was "staying" although he
wasn't there at the time and I felt better knowing that he was in such a lovely
place (and where he could go fishing--lol).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was the last dream I ever had of Joe.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Don't Do THat</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: batgal@msn.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To whom this may concern,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I live in <st1:place><st1:City>Signal Hill</st1:City>, <st1:State>California</st1:State></st1:place>,
at the Hillside Pines Condominiums.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This experience occurred early this morning, <st1:date year="2005" day="2" month="7">Saturday, July 2, 2005</st1:date>, between <st1:time minute="30" hour="1">1:30 a.m.</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2
 a.m.</st1:time> when I was about to go to bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I turned out all the lights and as soon as I laid my head on my pillow I
heard a woman's voice say,"Don't Do That".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was non-threatening, neither a high nor a
low pitch to the voice, just a simple "Don't Do That".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As soon as I heard her voice, I got up and looked around in
the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't believe what I had
just heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to think of
logical reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be the
neighbors next door, but the voice was right inside my bedroom, right in my
ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't scared, just surprised,
with some disbelief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dismissed the
voice and laid my head back down on my pillow, all the while thinking of that
woman's voice repeating,"Don't Do That".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About a minute went by when I heard my cat, Sassy, knock
over the glass lid of my candy jar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was a loud noise and I knew she had jumped up on the kitchen counter, an area
that is forbidden to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up and
turned on the lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The glass lid was
knocked off and I was missing a silver chain wrapped around the lid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew Sassy had swallowed it because it
wasn't the first time she had swallowed inanimate objects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Last time it was a rubber band, which she
coughed up a couple days later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hopefully she'll cough up the silver chain.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Before this experience, I sometimes feel my bed move as if
someone sat next to me or sat on the edge of my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I assumed it was one of my two cats jumping
onto my bed, but when I look up to see which cat it was, there was nothing on
the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has been going on for over
a year and I never told anyone until now.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My family and friends suggest that I check with the
neighbors who have lived in the condos from the day it was built in 1985 and
check with the police department of any homicides or deaths that may have
occurred in the city of <st1:City><st1:place>Signal</st1:place></st1:City>
Hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple friends even suggest
playing a tape recorder to record any noises at night, a suggestion I plan to
do this evening before going to bed.</p>
