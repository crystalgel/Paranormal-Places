<P><B>Yum Yum</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: laundy@chariot.net.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dear Shadow lands, I love all my animals and losing them is devastating.</B>
<BR><B>In 1996 my dear little pet piglet</B>
<BR><B>Yum Yum (from Madame Butterfly) became ill at just eleven weeks
old. She</B>
<BR><B>had been hand raised and was so tame and playful, her illness seemed</B>
<BR><B>minor at first, but over 4 days escalated into something very serious</B>
<BR><B>indeed, even though our vets tried everything to save her, we lost
her.</B>
<BR><B>The night she died in our little back room on her special bed, my</B>
<BR><B>husband and I did our best to try and deal with losing her, and
then</B>
<BR><B>late that night we quietly buried her under a favourite tree and
said</B>
<BR><B>our goodbyes. Later the next day, my husband said to me, I want
to tell</B>
<BR><B>you something about Yum Yum, do you want to hear it or will it upset</B>
<BR><B>you. I told him it was okay. He said that the night Yum died he
had</B>
<BR><B>walked through her little room late that night to get a drink, and
he</B>
<BR><B>very clearly felt her brush against his legs, bristles and all,
just</B>
<BR><B>like she loved to do. I found that a great comfort, that her soul
and</B>
<BR><B>her spirit had not left us. She was a special little pig.</B>
<BR><B>I now have Enya, my beloved pig who's been with me 6 years, but
we will</B>
<BR><B>never forget little Yum Yum.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Best wishes</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Where I Grew Up</B>
<BR><B>By: wendy.fulginiti@adelphia.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Let me begin by saying that I don't know what a ghost is. There's
obviously a phenomena occurring for which there is no explanation, but
is it spirits? Residual energy? I don't know and I refuse to limit the
possibilities either scientifically or spiritually until there is a concrete
reason for their elimination.I also try to eliminate every possible reasonable
and logical explanation for an occurence before I will classify it as unknown
or supernatural in nature.&nbsp; Myself and my family have definitely experienced
whatever the phenonema may be. This might get a little long because a lot
of the things happened to us as our period of residence in this place spanned
20 years.</B>
<BR><B>I grew up in a row home in Lancaster City in Southeastern Pennsylvania,
a little slice of urbania in the middle of PA Dutch Country about 1 1/2
hrs outside of Philadelphia. It was pretty ordinary from the outside but
many extraordinary things occurred within.</B>
<BR><B>The first thing I distinctly remember occurred in my brother's room
in the back of the house. We were kids and I had seen a mouse in my room,
so for some reason, I felt safer sleeping on a cot in my brother's room-
guess I figured the mouse couldn't get me there.It was bedtime and my brother
was laying on his bed and I was on the cot with the lights out.We were
talking when all of a sudden, the entire corner of the room lit up blue
and there was an electrical sound, like static. We both jumped up and ran
downstairs to get my parents. They came up to investigate and came up with
some lame excuse like it was static electricity. The corner of the room
where it happened was totally empty and it was not storming or anything
outside. Today my parents acknowledge that they have no idea what it was-
they were just trying to come up with an explanattion to make us feel better.</B>
<BR><B>Another occurrence was witnessed on separate occasions by myself
and also my two sisters and one of their friends. On the third floor of
the house, there were two rooms. The front one we used as storage and the
back one was used by each of us as a bedroom at different times. There
was a door between the two rooms that was closed with a hook and eye latch-
the kind that has the metal piece that slides underneath to secure it.
While it was my bedroom, on several separate occasions, the door would
start pulling violently from the other side as if someone were tugging
on it, but there was no one over there. My mom said it was the wind, but
the windows were shut and the storm windows were down as it was winter,
and it was being pulled way more violently than any wind could have done.
My sisters had the same experience later when it was their room, only the
lock came unlatched by itself and the door swung open right in front of
their eyes. A friend of my youngest sister was there once when it happened
and alos witnessed it.</B>
<BR><B>When I was a senior in high school, I was kind of going through
a very rebellious phase and cut school a lot. I would be the only person
in the house. I would go down to the bathroom and the water would be running.
I would shut it off and go back to my room. Next time I went to the bathroom,
the water would be running again. The happened repeatedly.</B>
<BR><B>My dad and my youngest sister are the only ones who really saw any
apparitions. My dad used to wake up during the night and see the dark figure
of a man standing at the end of his bed or sometimes by the window. He
woke my mom up a few times, but she could never see the man.He said he
even crawled to the end of the bed&nbsp; a few times and was trying to
touch the figure to see if it was real but his hand passed right through
it. My dad also said the figure beckoned to him on several occasions and
then turned around and walked out of the room. He also would every so often
awaken and see an orb of light up in the corner of his bedroom. He said
it would come rushing at him and veer off a the last minute and he could
feel a breeze on his face as it passed. My sister, while occupying the
aforementioned third floor bedroom, said she awoke one night to see a dark
figure standing at the top of the stairs (the stairs opened right into
the room). She said she was afraid someone had broken in and she tried
to get up but she couldn't. Eventually, the figure faded away and she was
able to move.I don't know if this was sleep paralysis, a supernatural experience
or maybe a little of both.</B>
<BR><B>My other sister, despite the third floor door experience she had
had, was a skeptic. Until one day her and my brother were alone in the
house. My brother was sleeping with his door shut and a fan on and she
was in the bathroom getting ready for work when all of the sudden she heard
moaning coming from the bottom of the stairs. She peeked out because she
thought maybe it was the dog, but there was nobody there and the moaning
stopped. As soon as she went back in the bathroom, it started again. She
said she locked the bathroom door and was scared to death. She investigated
but couldn't find any explanation for the moaning.</B>
<BR><B>I used to have experiences with things disappearing. I dropped a
piece of paper once and went to pick it up. It was gone. I never found
it even though I searched and searched for it. I would sit things down,
and turn around a minute or two later to get them, and they would be gone.
After awhile, this got on my nerves and I started demanding my stuff back.
Usually, I got it within a few minutes- many times, exactly where it had
been previously.</B>
<BR><B>I also woke up one morning with scratches all over the left half
of my body. I always sleep on my right side, so the left was up from the
bed. At the time, I was playing bass guitar in jazz band at school. so
I had no fingernails whatsoever. I tried really hard to duplicate the scratched
because I figured maybe I had just had a dream and done it to myself in
my sleep, but I couldn't duplicate them. That was very freaky. (This also
occurred in the third floor. I also heard in that room what sounded like
one end of a telephone conversation. It was right in the room with me and
it was the voice of an adult male, but it was winter and all the windows
were shut and, at the time, we had no phone upstairs.)</B>
<BR><B>The most interesting things happened when my nephew came along.
He and my sister live with my mom in this house (my parents had divorced
and my dad had moved out by this time). My sister and he shared my brothers
old bedroom. One night, he had just gotten his bath and was sitting on
the bed. My sister was trying to dress him, but he was looking straight
past her and giggling. Then he started counting. My sister asked him what
he was counting and he said "Fingers." There was nobody else home at the
time.</B>
<BR><B>He also saw my dead grandmother, who had died before he was born
and whom he had never met or seen pictures of. We called her Nanny. My
sister and he were in the living room and all of the sudden he said " You
can go to bed now, Nanny." My sister asked him where Nanny was and he pointed
to the video shelf and said "She's right there", kind of in a manner that
he couldn't understand why my sister couldn't see her. My sister asked
him if it was Nana (our other grandmother) or Grammy(what he calls our
mom) and he said no, it was Nanny.</B>
<BR><B>The last incident I will relate is something that happened to my
mom. She was home alone and in the kitchen there was a big bunch of helium
balloons that my nephew had gotten when he was sick. My mom went upstairs
to her bedroom. When she went to go back downstairs, the balloons were
in the back bedroom upstairs (which was my brothers room and was now my
sister and nephews). The balloons would have had to, in a very short time(
maybe 5 minutes according to my mom), travelled all the way through the
living room,ducked to get through the doorway and made what amounts to
a u-turn&nbsp; to go around the wall separating the living room and hallway,
gone up the stairs, then ducked down to get through the doorway to the
bedroom as the ceiling in the hallway was much higher. My mom was always
a little skeptical of the happenings at the house as well, but she admitted
that that was very strange.</B>
<BR><B>The funny thing is, a lot of this stuff only came to surface after
we moved out and were talking about the past. We were all having these
experiences and we didn't know it until much later on.So it really wasn't
like a mass hallucination or like the suggestion of a haunting was out
there and our minds were just producing these things.. I don't know what
it was going on in that house, but there was something. Sometimes I wonder
if was something like a mass generated poltergeist phenomenon because there
was a great deal of tension in that house while we all lived there (we
were pretty bad off financially and my parents didn't get along at all)
or if maybe we triggered the emergence of something spiritual or residual,
I don't know. I've had experiences at other locales in my life but the
series of events at this home was the most enduring and most blatant I've
encountered thusfar.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;West Brunswick Cemetary</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pinkie_thebrain@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I grew up near the West Brunswick Cemetary in Brunswick, OH. It was
a</B>
<BR><B>well-kept, beautiful, and old cemetary. It was peaceful, except
for a few</B>
<BR><B>places. One was a tiny chapel near the center of the cemetary. The
place has</B>
<BR><B>not been opened since the 1800s, and if you peer in through one
of the</B>
<BR><B>barred windows, you can see a shovel, an old pail, and, if you're
looking at</B>
<BR><B>the right time, a man. I don't know who the man is, I know only
that my</B>
<BR><B>friends and I got a bad shock when we looked in and saw him sitting
there.</B>
<BR><B>We, naturally, screamed, and some other friends came over and looked
in.</B>
<BR><B>They found nothing. Another spot is the "Baby Garden". The Baby
Garden is a</B>
<BR><B>large part of the cemetary in which infants were buried. It's a
very sad and</B>
<BR><B>depressing place, as most of the, er, occupants were less than a
year old</B>
<BR><B>when they passed on. But the most disturbing aspect of this place
is that</B>
<BR><B>you can hear the crying of infants at various times of the day and
night.</B>
<BR><B>After much pondering, my friends and I have concluded that the moment
they</B>
<BR><B>cry, that was when they were born. There is a crypt, near the chapel,
from</B>
<BR><B>which comes breathing noises. This may be just some superstitious
rural</B>
<BR><B>folks imagination, but it is still very unnerving when a wind arises
around</B>
<BR><B>the grave, but no leaves move no matter how intense the wind. Feel
free to</B>
<BR><B>e-mail me. I love to swap stories.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Watching Over Us</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Tnvols4me@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am originally from Tennessee, but grew up in Sarasota Florida after
my family had to move due to financial reasons.&nbsp; We ended up with
a house on Cass Circle in the Siesta Heights Neighborhood.&nbsp; I never
really thought anything was strange about growing up there at the time,
even though Mom said I spent entirely too much time talking to a Guy named
Chester in their Closet.&nbsp; The routine was pretty simple - I was the
youngest and had an early bedtime. My sister shared the room with me and
had to join before long. The house only had two bedrooms and you could
see the door to our parents room and see the livingroom from our vantage
points in our beds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every night I would see what I thought
was Dad leave the bedroom with a lit cigarette, walk around the livingroom,
then stand in our doorway staring at us.&nbsp; He would then turn and go
back into the bedroom and we would not sThis went on all the way up through
my teen years and had become such a normal part of life that I never really
gave it much thought.&nbsp; Then one day it hit me like a BRICK.............</B>
<BR><B>Dad was deathly afraid of falling asleep and setting something on
fire when smoking.&nbsp; Mom was the same way.&nbsp; For this reason they
never kept cigarettes, lighters or ashtray's in their bedroom.&nbsp; But
this shadow I saw come out of the room every night, had what looked like
a lit cigarette and would eventually walk back into the room with it and
not come out.&nbsp; There were no ashtray's, no garbage cans, no place
to put the ashes or butt.&nbsp; This that I had seen all this time, COULD
NOT BE DAD.............</B>
<BR><B>I spoke to my sister about this when I hit my twenties, and she
went "WOW" - You remember seeing that too.&nbsp; She went, you know that
couldnt have been Dad cause he wouldn't smoke in the bedroom or at night.&nbsp;
I said I know, that is why I asked you to see if I was crazy.</B>
<BR><B>I would have given anything to have still been living there when
I discovered all this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to know if this sort of
thing still goes on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wonder if Chester in my parents
closet, was the one watching over us each night.............</B>

<P><B>Von Minden Hotel in Schulenburg, Tx</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: crisostimo2@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Wanting to do something different than just dressing up for Halloween,
my girlfriend and I headed to the haunted Von Minden Hotel in Schulenburg
Tx.</B>
<BR><B>We had intented to stay the night but decided, en route, not to
after all. The town is not much to look at but the hotel definitely stands
out. It's a slightly run down (yet beautiful) hotel that houses both a
quaint theater and pizza parlour on the bottom floor. We decided to start
off with pizza then convince one of the owners to give us a quick tour.
Upon entering the pizza parlour, we were greeted by a handful of young
tricker-treaters and a very friendly guy named Garrett (who turns out is
the owner). I introduced myself and asked if they sold beer. He stated
that they didn't but I could grab a six pack and bring it in, which we
did.</B>
<BR><B>After finishing our meal, Garrett was more than happy to give us
a tour of the Hotel. Upon entering the lobby you feel as if you have gone
back in time. Everything is exactly as it was in the 1920's. The hair on
the back of my neck stood up at this point. There were definitely ghosts
in that Hotel. He took us to the second floor to a room where a man had
hung himself with a wire. The wire cut into his neck, severing his jugular
veins and causing blood to squirt all over the room. Needless to say, it's
the only room with wallpaper.</B>
<BR><B>In the hall Garrett proceeded to tell us the story of the WWII veteran
who had sent a telegram to his love stating that if she did indeed love
him, to meet him at the Hotel. He never heard back from her so decided
to take his life by jumping out of the window of room 36. His love arrived
a day later only to find him dead. While Garrett was telling me this story,
I caught an orb moving from the left side of the hall to the right and
dissappearing into the wall. I've never seen an orb before and never really
believed in them until then. I didn't say a word for fear of that he would
think I was making it up to patronize him. He then took us to the third
floor where his room was. I aksed him "so, do you ever see them...the ghosts
I mean?". He replied with "oh yea, all the time." He explained that many
people explain having a woman ask them directions to room 36. They think
nothing of it and proceed to give her directions when they suddenly realize
they're talking to themselves. He also stated that they always</B>
<BR><B>We thanked Garrett and headed on our way. I'm always looking for
haunted places to visit, but this one was definitely the most haunted.
I definitely recommend the Von Minden to any ghost seekers. It's a genuine
experience and not a tourist trap.</B>

<P><B>Up-Dated Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bratj_99@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just wanted to update my ghost story, since it's coming up to the
Holidays again, our house is getting more "noisy" as our ghost here seems
to become more active around the Holidays starting with Thanksgiving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My husband and I have heard numerous noises, such as doors closing, foot
steps and floors creaking where there is NO ONE THERE!&nbsp; This doesn't
usually freak us out too badly, but about a few weeks ago, my husband and
I have had a very scary experience, but at seperate times...I and our son
were at Karate class one night, and my husband thought I had already come
home and was in bed, because he said when he rolled over he saw what looked
to be a head on my pillow and he chills!</B>
<BR><B>On top of all this activity lately, I have taken pictures a while
back of certain areas of our house, and for the most part, none of them
turned out, they were all blurry, except for a few that turned out crystal
clear, but the weird thing is, is that the form we have on our dinningroom
floor, didn't turn up in the pictures at all, you just see the floor, when
I know there was &amp; is a form there and was looking at it through the
view lense of the camera!&nbsp; Also there are two pictures of me in the
house that the left side of the pictures turned out clear, but the right
side of one of the pictures there is a bright red line, and in the other
picture on the right side, it is blurry.&nbsp; Very freaky.&nbsp; So we
are going to try again to take pictures of the inside of our house at different
times of the day to see what does or doesn't turn up.</B>
<BR><B>In addition to all this weird stuff going on in our house lately,
I have seen what I thought was our cat running out from underneath one
of our plant stands, towards my legs, and have felt something small, like
a cat or small dog running past my legs and brushing up against them at
the same time, but our cat was never around, she is usually in on top of
her stand looking out the window or in her bed sleeping when all this has
happened.&nbsp; I don't know yet still who or what this new animal ghost
is, and still haven't found out who our ghost is either.&nbsp; I still
have a hard time being in our basement late at night when everyone has
already gone to bed.</B>
<BR><B>Well that's my up-date, Thank You for letting me tell it.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Unforgettable</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: samification@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was eight years old, my mother and I lived in a little trailer
in Southern Ohio.&nbsp; Periodically, I would be awakened to my dog barking
like a maniac at the foot of my bed.&nbsp; I would sit up to witness a
silhouette on my bedroom door of a man grabbing a woman by the throat and
stabbing her repeatedly.&nbsp; The first time I saw this I was in terror,
thinking someone was murdering my mother.&nbsp; When it stopped, I got
up and ran into the living room to find it dark, which is strange, as this
apparition seemed to be a shadow.&nbsp; I do remember it always happened
at 12:15 a.m. on the dot.&nbsp; It seemed to run a specific cycle.</B>
<BR><B>Also, there is a little cemetery near where I now live in Olmsted
Falls, OH called Chestnut Grove Cemetery.&nbsp; Locals refer to it simply
as the "Witch's" Grave.&nbsp; One day, my friend had cut school with another
friend, so they went there to kill some time.&nbsp; There was about a foot
of snow on the ground, and it was not snowing at the time.&nbsp; They went&nbsp;
to the grave that is supposedly the witch's, hung out for maybe ten minutes,
and when they turned around to go to the car, their footprints had disappeared!</B>
<BR><B>Another friend and I have also sworn we've heard something in the
far left corner of the cemetery call our names.&nbsp; This on different
occasions when we were alone.&nbsp; I've decided against going there alone,
anymore.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My parents old house use to be a hotel in the late 1800's to early
1900's.</B>
<BR><B>Not sure of the details but the owner passed away inside of the
house due to</B>
<BR><B>a heart attack.&nbsp; Anyhow, there is a certain part of the house
where my mother</B>
<BR><B>had an extra bed.&nbsp; My mother use to sleep there until strange
things started</B>
<BR><B>happening.&nbsp; She would wake up in the middle of the night and
her blankets</B>
<BR><B>would be sliding off of her bed and it would begin to shake.&nbsp;
She tried to</B>
<BR><B>ignore this until something actually jumped on her chest but she
could not</B>
<BR><B>see anything there.&nbsp; Needless to say after this incident she
did not sleep in</B>
<BR><B>that same room.&nbsp; Also, my boyfriend now husband spent the night
with us once</B>
<BR><B>and slept in this particular room and experienced the same thing
except</B>
<BR><B>nothing jumped on him but quickly ran out of the room white as a
ghost.&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>would not just happen at certain times but instead randomly.&nbsp;
We are not sure</B>
<BR><B>if this is maybe the owner that passed away or what but this is
very creepy.</B>
<BR><B>One other thing, the basement of the house use to be a saloon and
when you go</B>
<BR><B>down there it feels as though someone is behind you at all times.</B>

<P><B>1990 Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JGomez@youthville.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My experience with the supernatural started in 1990 soon after
my mother</B>
<BR><B>passed away. My name is Juli and I was 17 at the time this all began.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Within a couple of weeks of my mother's passing I was home
alone. As I</B>
<BR><B>walked through our dinning room I looked into a mirror. What I saw
scared</B>
<BR><B>the hell out of me. There in the mirror was a reflection of a spirit
all in</B>
<BR><B>black. The same kind of image as the grim reaper. I turned around
to look</B>
<BR><B>directly at this thing. What I saw was a black cloak with a hood
covering</B>
<BR><B>what should have been a face. There was no face inside the hood.
The spirit</B>
<BR><B>sort of nodded it's head at me and left my house through the wall
next to</B>
<BR><B>the front door. I proceeded to dive into a corner of the dinning
room and</B>
<BR><B>cried. I knew that whatever sickness had inflicted itself on my
mother had</B>
<BR><B>now left our home.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; A few years later I was again home alone while my fianc&eacute;
was working</B>
<BR><B>second shift.&nbsp; It was pretty late and I was asleep in bed.
Our 80 pound</B>
<BR><B>rottwieler was in her room, when I was awaken to her crying as if
someone</B>
<BR><B>was really hurting her. I ran to her room where she was lying on
her doggy</B>
<BR><B>bed with her eyes very wide open. She was sort of cowering and crying</B>
<BR><B>terribly. I started howlering at her and could not get her attention.
I</B>
<BR><B>suddenly dawned on me that she was looking at Something behind me.
I got</B>
<BR><B>goosebumps all over my body. I hit the door to her room with my
hand to make</B>
<BR><B>a very loud noise. It worked, she shook her head, blinked and came
running</B>
<BR><B>over to me. Whatever had been in my house was apparently gone. Beth,
my dog,</B>
<BR><B>then got to sleep in bed with me for the rest of night. I never
did see</B>
<BR><B>whatever it was my dog saw. But to make an 80 pound dog cry out
in fear like</B>
<BR><B>that can't be good!!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime after that experience my fiance' and I went
to Virginia to visit</B>
<BR><B>my dad and his new wife. They worked together in Fredricksburg at
a small</B>
<BR><B>shop called Varga Trophy. The building this shop is in was build
during the</B>
<BR><B>Civil War. I do not know all of the history but it was used to hide</B>
<BR><B>soldiers. On the third floor there is door to a room in the floor
that the</B>
<BR><B>soldiers and whoever else hid in. My dad and stepmom had been telling
me of</B>
<BR><B>a ghost that occupies the second and third floor of this building.
My dad</B>
<BR><B>has many storied of his own in regards to this ghost. One night
he was</B>
<BR><B>working late and alone. He called his wife to tell her it was still
going to</B>
<BR><B>be awhile before he left for home. As he was on the phone a baseball
came</B>
<BR><B>off of a shelf and hung in the air for second, dropped to the ground
and</B>
<BR><B>rolled right at him. He decided it was time to go home right then.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; There stories really excited me. I couldn't wait to
go to this very old</B>
<BR><B>building to see what I could find. My stepmom took me up to the
third floor</B>
<BR><B>and started to talk to the ghost that for some reason they called
"George".</B>
<BR><B>As she and I stood there, there were heavy footsteps going across
the wooden</B>
<BR><B>floor on the other side of the room. Val, my stepmom, went back
down stairs.</B>
<BR><B>I stayed up there and took pictures. I didn't get anything on film.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that afternoon, I took my fiance' up there. I
started asking if</B>
<BR><B>anyone was there with us. We heard a very low moaning noise. I asked
again</B>
<BR><B>if there was anyone else there. Again, only louder we heard a very
low</B>
<BR><B>moaing. My fiance' took off!! I was left standing there taking pictures.</B>
<BR><B>When I felt a cold breeze blow in the back of my neck I decided
it was time</B>
<BR><B>for me to go too. As I reached the stairs a metal bracket flew by&nbsp;
and hit</B>
<BR><B>the floor next to me. Scared the crap out of me!! I ran down stairs
with a</B>
<BR><B>scream. I told my dad what happened and made him go up to see the
bracket</B>
<BR><B>thing. Sure enough, there it was lying on the floor. My dad told
the ghost</B>
<BR><B>to be nice and not to mess with his girl. As dad and I got back
to the</B>
<BR><B>second floor and off of the steps a big uility broom that had been
leaning</B>
<BR><B>against the wall, hit the floor with a very loud crash. I'm not
sure if I</B>
<BR><B>pissed the ghost off or if he just wanted to make sure I knew he
was</B>
<BR><B>definately there. Without a doubt - he is there!!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; The only person who has actually seen this ghost is Mike,
the owner of the</B>
<BR><B>store. He was working alone one night and kept hearing someone walk
back and</B>
<BR><B>forth. Knowing he was the only person in the building he went to
check it</B>
<BR><B>out. As he reached the top of the steps he saw a Confederate Soldier
in full</B>
<BR><B>uniform pacing back and forth. As Mike watched him walk, he stopped
and</B>
<BR><B>looked right at Mike. It was then that Mike left the building.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Troubles</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Sciaccay@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>would you be interested in some real stories that happened to my
family? I would like to know what you make of them and if there is any
that can be explained.</B>
<BR><B>I grew up in a new home that from day one my brother hated the basement
even as much as to say he wouldn't stay down there. I was 3 when i started
telling my mom and dad about the lady. My brother when he was 13, gave
me a cross for protection and he being an non believer in religion started
sleeping with a bible, cross and a knife in his bed at&nbsp; age 17. My
mom saw a half skull and half human faced thing sitting on the end of her
bed. We always heard noises just loud enough to think it was a radio on
low not quite on the station. The thing appeared to my mother as a man
one night. My brother could sense when the linen closet in our bathroom
was open even if he was sleeping. My dad had an&nbsp; experience where
he was on midnights and he was bedding down in the morning. The room was
dark and he always kept a small fan running. The static or whatever :he
heard it travel up the hallway and enter the room and hover above the bed.
my dad has always and I do to sleep with blankets over our head with just
enougthreats and hanging up decided to get nasty. My mother said leave
us alone and go back to where ever lunatic place you escaped from. From
what I understand the woman just groaned and the phone went dead. Now here
is the kicker> In engalnd my dad"s brother David was married to a Christine
and they were having major relationship problems. two weeks after the last
call they divorced. Any way there are more stories and I am glad i found
your site. This is what i love</B>

<P><B>To Dream or not to Dream</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: womanofscorn@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well I've been looking at your website for a long time, and I finally</B>
<BR><B>decided to send you my experience.</B>
<BR><B>I grew up in Perth Amboy, NJ and lived in the same house for 19
yrs.&nbsp; I've</B>
<BR><B>always considered myself a little "sensitive" as I've always felt
and seen</B>
<BR><B>things.&nbsp; My mother never believed me until somethings happened
to her.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways....this is one of my experiences.</B>
<BR><B>Back in 1996 when I was about 16, I had a friend of mine sleep over
my house</B>
<BR><B>one night.&nbsp; At about 12am I just opened my eyes and saw a face.&nbsp;
But it</B>
<BR><B>seemed as soon as I opened my eyes it left and I felt a rush of
air.&nbsp; I was</B>
<BR><B>in one of those half-asleep states, so it didn't phase me much at
the time.</B>
<BR><B>I sat up and at the end of my bed I saw an Indian sitting there.&nbsp;
He looked</B>
<BR><B>as though he was meditating.&nbsp; I just sat there, looking at
him and my friend</B>
<BR><B>in the next bed called my name.&nbsp; When I turned to look at her,
I told her it</B>
<BR><B>looked like there was a man standing next to her bed.&nbsp; Then
I told her it</B>
<BR><B>looked like he just got into the bed with her.&nbsp; I just shrugged
and went to</B>
<BR><B>sleep thinking I was dreaming.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning I wasn't sure what happened lastnight.&nbsp; I
didn't mention it</B>
<BR><B>to my friend until she brought it up.&nbsp; She asked me if I had
seen the man</B>
<BR><B>sitting at the end of my bed.&nbsp; Right then I knew I wasn't dreaming,
as I</B>
<BR><B>hadn't mentioned that figure to her lastnight.&nbsp; I told my mom
about it and</B>
<BR><B>she gave me the "I believe you believe it" speech.&nbsp; Her tune
changed about</B>
<BR><B>two years later when she had her own experience....</B>

<P><B>Three Ghostly Tales</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: skipmcf@gladstone.uoregon.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, after reading several stories on the site, I decided to add
3 of</B>
<BR><B>mine to the list of odd experiences. One is a story I've shared
before</B>
<BR><B>(even to the point of drawing a 1 page comic strip on it) but this
seems</B>
<BR><B>like a good place to share them. Sorry if this gets a bit long.</B>
<BR><B>I've had a variety of odd things happen in my life ... whether ghostly,</B>
<BR><B>states of mind or coincidence. For example, like others have mentioned,</B>
<BR><B>I too have awakened in the middle of the night with a strong feeling</B>
<BR><B>that someone was in the house, just out of my site, yet unable to
move</B>
<BR><B>let alone barely breathe. The incidence I most remember of this
happened</B>
<BR><B>while living in a ground floor apartment in Livermore California
across</B>
<BR><B>the street from the hospital where the ambulances would pull in,
sirens</B>
<BR><B>blazing (though that did not happen this time to wake me up). That
night</B>
<BR><B>I was the only one home, my first wife gone on a visit with an old</B>
<BR><B>friend. But here are what I consider to be my three ghost stories:</B>
<BR><B>The House I Never Saw.</B>
<BR><B>I've had memories of a house that I recalled parts from a very young</B>
<BR><B>age. I would have dreams of this house, and sometimes, for no apparent</B>
<BR><B>reason, it would just pop into my mind when thinking about my</B>
<BR><B>grandparents. When I was around 10-12, and my grandmother was spinning</B>
<BR><B>yarns about our family past, I mentioned this house. Both her and
my</B>
<BR><B>mother said it was (If I recall correctly now some 20+ years later)
an</B>
<BR><B>accurate description of my great grandmothers house ... a house
I had</B>
<BR><B>never seen as I was born after she and my great grandfather had
died,</B>
<BR><B>and the house had passed from the family. Perhaps I just pieced
it</B>
<BR><B>together from those old tales of my grandmother, except, she rarely</B>
<BR><B>described the houses, focusing more on the people.</B>
<BR><B>My Ghostly Playmate</B>
<BR><B>Again, when I was about 10 years old, living in Pleasant Hill</B>
<BR><B>California, I had an argument with my mom and was sent to my room
for</B>
<BR><B>the day. Now I have to admit I was a rotten kid and have since done
the</B>
<BR><B>best I could to change that, but then I deserved the day of grounding.
I</B>
<BR><B>went to my room and started playing with my MEGO dolls (anyone remember</B>
<BR><B>those from the 70s?). Now in my room, my bed was on say the South
wall,</B>
<BR><B>and on the North was a dresser, on the East a closet that was about
half</B>
<BR><B>of the wall, the door to the room being in the other half. As I
played</B>
<BR><B>with my MEGOs ... I made lots of "POWS" and "CRASHES" as the heroes
and</B>
<BR><B>villains fought. At some point, I made my Superman and Batman (why
two</B>
<BR><B>heroes I don't know) fly at and crash into each other in mid air.
As</B>
<BR><B>they collided, I said something along the lines of "CRASH". At the
same</B>
<BR><B>time a "Thump", came from behind me. As I sat staring at the figures
now</B>
<BR><B>lying on the bed, another "Thump" came, followed by another, picking
up</B>
<BR><B>speed and getting closer. As I turned around, behind me, between
the</B>
<BR><B>dresser and closet was a chalk board that was moving by itself,
side to</B>
<BR><B>side crashing into the dresser, then the closet. As I watched, it
slowed</B>
<BR><B>and stopped. I immediately jumped up and started screaming to come
out,</B>
<BR><B>but mom refused (again, I was really rotten and she thought I was
just</B>
<BR><B>pulling a trick to get out). I climbed on the bed, grabbed my MEGOs
and</B>
<BR><B>sat watching that chalk board, crying until I fell asleep. I don't
know</B>
<BR><B>if it was a ghostly reminder that being grounded to one's room didn't</B>
<BR><B>mean "playtime", or if it was someone/thing that simply got caught
up in</B>
<BR><B>my play. Perahps, just perhaps I simply imagined it.</B>
<BR><B>My Uncles grave.</B>
<BR><B>My uncle died back in the 80's, a self inflicted gunshot in front
of my</B>
<BR><B>grandparents. This was my mom's brother, and both she and my grandmother</B>
<BR><B>felt we looked a lot a like, and shared some similar personality
traits.</B>
<BR><B>In fact, my aunt always said that if she and my uncle had had a
son,</B>
<BR><B>he'd look like me. As my grandparents didn't have much money, and
didn't</B>
<BR><B>want to tell any family members of this, he was buried in the part
of</B>
<BR><B>the cemetery where no grave stones are allowed, and where people
with no</B>
<BR><B>or little money can still have a burial. All he has is a small marker</B>
<BR><B>about 3" x 2" with a number in it.</B>
<BR><B>The first time my parents went to find his grave, they had a dickens
of</B>
<BR><B>a time finding it. So they made photos, and notations on how many</B>
<BR><B>footsteps from which graves with what object in line of site would
lead</B>
<BR><B>to the marker.</B>
<BR><B>The first time I went with my parents, they started digging out
all</B>
<BR><B>their photos and notes to figure out where, from a general starting</B>
<BR><B>point this marker was. While they were doing this, I simply walked
out</B>
<BR><B>about how many steps it was, knelt down and moved a bit of grass
to find</B>
<BR><B>it. Not too odd, probably just coincidence.</B>
<BR><B>A few years later, I took one of my cousins to see her dad's grave
site.</B>
<BR><B>I started to count out the location. Went to what should have been
the</B>
<BR><B>right spot, and started looking with no luck. This went on for several</B>
<BR><B>tries/minutes. The next thing I knew, my cousin simply walked out,
knelt</B>
<BR><B>down and found his marker.</B>
<BR><B>OK, now for the really weird part. My uncle liked to play tricks
on</B>
<BR><B>people. For what would have been his 50th birthday, I and my parents</B>
<BR><B>went to the cemetery to have a birthday party for him, complete
with a</B>
<BR><B>bottle of wine and his favorites, Hostess cakes (those wonderful
round</B>
<BR><B>ones with the chocolate frosting and creamy filling). We literally
spent</B>
<BR><B>hours looking for his marker, tearing up small tufts of grass that
had</B>
<BR><B>grown over before finally giving up and finding a grounds keeper
to help</B>
<BR><B>us. He found it, about 2 inches away from the 2 foot by 3 foot area
we</B>
<BR><B>had been looking in. After the grounds keeper left, we broke out
the</B>
<BR><B>wine, all taking a sip and poring some out for him. Then we lit
a candle</B>
<BR><B>in the Hostess for him. But it wouldn't light. The wind kept blowing
it</B>
<BR><B>out (you can see the wind blowing constantly on a pinwheel we brought</B>
<BR><B>for him). Somehow we got it lit after being ready to give up on
lighting</B>
<BR><B>it and quickly decided to sing "Happy Birthday" as we knew the wind</B>
<BR><B>would blow the candle out. The odd thing, it stayed lit for the
whole</B>
<BR><B>song ... meanwhile, the video shows the pinwheel still twirling
in the</B>
<BR><B>wind. Right after we finished the song, a gust of wind slightly
stronger</B>
<BR><B>then the rest (which weren't that weak) came and blew out his candle,</B>
<BR><B>just as if he was there.</B>
<BR><B>We decided he must have been there, playing with us all day and
turning</B>
<BR><B>our 30 minute visit into a daylong visit with practical tricks,
letting</B>
<BR><B>us have his party just before we really needed to leave for the
cemetery</B>
<BR><B>to close. He wasn't always the nicest man, having drug and alcohol</B>
<BR><B>problems, but underneath, he was a very loving and caring uncle.
I think</B>
<BR><B>his spirit is at rest, but still likes to play those practical jokes</B>
<BR><B>once in a while.</B>

<P><B>Jersey Motel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: guyjolicoeur@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>It was during the late seventies and my family along with myself
were on our way down to Florida to visit my older sister.&nbsp; We stopped
into a motel for the night all five of us shared a room of two double beds,
all night I kept waking up hearing cowboy boots walking back and forth
at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; In the morning I was a misserable camper
and I look over at my brother and say, ``you look like I feel!``He replies,
``shhh, don`t talk about it!``&nbsp; I blurt out, ``what, did you see him
too? He was wearing a black leather jacket, blue jeans with cowboy boots
that I heard and he had sandy blond hair. My brother said f...., at first
I thought I was dreaming. Our father being a cleptomaniac was always stealing
junk which we would always take turns scolding him.&nbsp; My brother and
I made sure that he did not bring any momentos with him that day!</B>

<P><B>By: samuelt@alltel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>We lived in our house for 3 1/2 years.&nbsp; The prior occupant lived
in the house from the age of 15 until she died at 98.&nbsp; My husband
has seen her on many occasions.&nbsp; I feel her presence.&nbsp; A few
days after moving in my husband awoke to what he thought was me standing
in the bedroom doorway.&nbsp; He asked me "what I was doing, why wasn't
I in bed? " that woke me up and he realized I was in bed.&nbsp; She was
gone then, and he was up all night!!!</B>
<BR><B>Ms. Kathleen also likes to pat bed covers and blink the lights.&nbsp;
I'm wondering if she is signaling "bedtime" for everything always happens
in late evening.</B>
<BR><B>She has also been seen on the stairs and in the doorway to the back
bedroom. This was her bedroom.Why do we think she is upstairs or headed
upstairs? She had three daughters who all slept on the 2nd floor.&nbsp;
We think she is checking on them.&nbsp; Why is she here?&nbsp; We think
because she spent many wonderful years here and passed in the house.&nbsp;
After being here, and having her as part of the history.&nbsp; We would
never move or ask her to leave!! She has become part of our family.</B>

<P><B>Life In A Haunted House</B><B></B>

DIFFERENT GHOSTS. ONE WHICH SEEMED HARMLESS AND THE OTHER TWO WE WEREN'T

SHE NEARLY HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN LIVING THERE. MY DAD WORKED THE THIRD
SHIFT AND SHE WAS HOME ALONE WITH JUST US BABIES. SHE SAID SHE WOULD BE
TRYING TO GET US TO SLEEP IN HER ROOM AND SHE WOULD HEAR HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
IN ANOTHER ROOM. SHE SAID WHEN SHE CHECKED IT OUT, NO ONE WAS IN THE ROOM

<P><B>Dead Squirrels</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: catscantcookham@ripnet.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is a story that does not involve ghosts but it is supernatural.&nbsp;
I moved into a house with my family when I was around 16 I shared a bedroom
with one of my brothers.&nbsp; My father and I have generaly been good
at sensing spiritual things we are dedicated christians and belive it was
the gift of dicernment.&nbsp; The walls of my bedroom where plastered with
heavy metal bands covered with pentagrams and 666 we also belived a ouijie
board was used in the room as well as other things.&nbsp; one night while
I was dreaming my dream turned very frightning I still don't feel comfterable
telling it in full but it involved dead children.&nbsp; my brother woke
up from the frightened sounds I was making in my sleep.&nbsp; I woke in
the middle of his prayer and I saw floating above my bed a transparent
creature that was pinning me to my bed I could not move or speak.&nbsp;
I said a little prayer in my head and then the only things my lips would
let me say is the name of jesus and the demon let me go.&nbsp; the room
still had a very evil presence so I woke up my father who came and threw
prayer removed it from my room.&nbsp; it kept trying to hide in different
rooms and my dad kept kicking in out.&nbsp; finally when it had now where
else to go, it spoke to my dad and asked if it could possess the near by
squirrels (this is the part that if it wasn't true I'ld be embarressed
to say) we could feel the evil presence leave the house we said a prayer
and had a good nights rest.&nbsp; the next day my youngest brother not
knowing what had happened came home from school and said "hey what's with
the dead squirrels in front of the door" sure enough right at the bottom
of the stairs there were three dead squirrels</B>
<BR><B>I don't tell to many people this story mainly cause people don't
belive it</B><B></B>

<P><B>Creepy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: beelzabubba@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have never seen a ghost or been abducted or anything crazy like
that but I</B>
<BR><B>do have a couple of creepy experiences that I would like to share
with you.</B>
<BR><B>In 1990 I was attending unviversity in Edmonton Canada and sharing
the third</B>
<BR><B>floor of an old downtown house that had been divided into three
apartments.</B>
<BR><B>The house was about 80 years old. I was a sophmore at the time and
had two</B>
<BR><B>roommates and we were young and partying alot. We would have friends
over</B>
<BR><B>frequently to have some drinks before going to the clubs. On many
occasions</B>
<BR><B>while we were listening to the stereo the volume would begin going
up and</B>
<BR><B>down on its own. Also the TV would go on and off all the time. Sometimes</B>
<BR><B>when I was home alone I would get out of the shower and the TV and
stereo</B>
<BR><B>would be on but none of my roommates were home. There also seemed
to be alot</B>
<BR><B>of electricity in the apartment. Whenever anyone touched anything
they would</B>
<BR><B>get one of those little static shocks. It was all a little strange
but it</B>
<BR><B>was never scary and most of us brushed it off as remote control
waves</B>
<BR><B>bouncing around. One day I went to the first floor to pay the rent
and</B>
<BR><B>mentioned my experiences to the landlord who told me that a young
obviously</B>
<BR><B>depressed man had hung himself in our living room in the 60's. The
other</B>
<BR><B>story I want to tell was told to me by my boss's father about 10
years ago.</B>
<BR><B>He told me that when he was a young&nbsp; man he had joined the
army to stop the</B>
<BR><B>Nazis and had been mobilized for D-Day and Canada's assault on Juneau
beach.</B>
<BR><B>He told me he met a man in his unit and they became best friends.
They</B>
<BR><B>miracously survived the war and remained close friends in Canada.
He told me</B>
<BR><B>that one night he awoke to find his friend standing at the foot
of his bed.</B>
<BR><B>His friend told him he loved him and then he dissappeared. The next
morning</B>
<BR><B>he received a phone call from his friend's wife who told him that
his friend</B>
<BR><B>had died in his sleep the previous night. The strange thing is that
his</B>
<BR><B>friend lived in Victoria, British Columbia which is about 1200km
from</B>
<BR><B>Edmonton where my boss's father lived.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>College Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: giddyappin@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've read several of these stories and I want to share</B>
<BR><B>mine.&nbsp; This happened eleven years ago while I was</B>
<BR><B>visiting my younger sister at her college in the</B>
<BR><B>South.&nbsp; She attended a very old school that had old</B>
<BR><B>brick buildings with columns and ivy.&nbsp; One building in</B>
<BR><B>particular - Theateratre - was well known for being</B>
<BR><B>haunted by a ghost named AJ who at one time was a</B>
<BR><B>President of the college.</B>
<BR><B>After a night of partying and having a blast, my</B>
<BR><B>sister and I ended up in theateratre building with a</B>
<BR><B>very good friend of hers at the time.&nbsp; He was heavily</B>
<BR><B>itheateratre and made arrangements with the school to</B>
<BR><B>live there.&nbsp; It was about 3:00 in the morning when we</B>
<BR><B>started asking him about the strange things that</B>
<BR><B>happened to him.&nbsp; He told us about the horses</B>
<BR><B>galloping in the radiators, and how late at night he</B>
<BR><B>would be in theateratre working on technical things</B>
<BR><B>and a chair in the very last row would be the only one</B>
<BR><B>in a seated position.&nbsp; He also told us how he would be</B>
<BR><B>checking sound and suddenly it would go on the fritz.</B>
<BR><B>He said he was comfortable around AJ, and would ask</B>
<BR><B>out loudloud to stop messing around because he had to</B>
<BR><B>get his work done.&nbsp; Evidently, this was a very</B>
<BR><B>cooperative playful ghost and would leave our friend</B>
<BR><B>to his work.</B>
<BR><B>Around 4:00 a.m., my sister and I decided it was time</B>
<BR><B>to leave to get some sleep.&nbsp; We stood up, stretched</B>
<BR><B>and put our coats on.&nbsp; I went to grab the door and it</B>
<BR><B>was locked.&nbsp; So I asked my sister to try the door and</B>
<BR><B>she couldn't open it either.&nbsp; Our friend finally told</B>
<BR><B>AJ to stop playing with us because we were all tired -</B>
<BR><B>and the door opened!&nbsp; What was so bizarre is that the</B>
<BR><B>door had no lock on it.</B>
<BR><B>When we stepped out into the hallway, I remember</B>
<BR><B>thinking how cold it was and goose bumpsosebumps and</B>
<BR><B>all the hairs on the back of my neck and arm standing</B>
<BR><B>straight up.&nbsp; I definitely felt a</B>
<BR><B>presemischeviouschevious one at that!&nbsp; I'll never</B>
<BR><B>forget it.&nbsp; My sister thinks we were just tired and</B>
<BR><B>that our friend was playing a joke on us.&nbsp; But I think</B>
<BR><B>she tells herself that to make herself feel better</B>
<BR><B>about the experience.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was a policeman and at the time, I was in charge of Accident Investigation.
I was driving home, after work,&nbsp; one afternoon when I began to wonder
about a fellow who I had not seen for some time. He was not a friend of
mine,just someone I had&nbsp; seen in the hallway of the police station.
He&nbsp; sometimes came in to pay traffic fines.</B>
<BR><B>When I arrived home,the phone rang and it was the police dispatcher,telling
me that I was to respond to a fatal accident scene.</B>
<BR><B>Upon my arrival, the investigating officer told me that a man had
been repeatedly run over with a car,driven by his girl friend. She had
already been taken into custody. We then preceeded to the spot where the
victim was lying on the ground. The victim was the man I had been wondering
about!!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Civil War Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Greytraveller@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>The last time I visited Gettysburg battlefield was summer 1992. This
was just a few days after Ted Turner's movie studio finished filming the
movie "Gettysburg' starring Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger and Jeff Daniels.
Anyway I took a driving tour of the battlefield stopping occasionally to
get out at locations of special interest.</B>
<BR><B>One such location of special interest was near Devil's Den and Little
Round Top. I parked my car on a side road out in fairly open ground, got
out and began walking toward Little Round Top. Battlefield markers and
monuments nearby indicated that this area was known as the Wheat Field
and the Peach Orchard. The actual Wheatfield and Orchard had been cut down
many years ago but back during the battle, on July 2, 1863 (Second Day)
Hood's division</B>
<BR><B>had attacked across that ground pushing the Union defenders back
toward Little Round Top.</B>
<BR><B>As I crossed the open ground Little Round Top was clearly visible
to the right front and Devil's Den could be seen off to the far right.
There was a line of trees that marked a small wood midway across that open
field. As I approached that line of trees (which was about halfway from
the start of the Wheatfield to Little Round Top) I felt an indescribable
sensation of emotion, fear, exultation, expectation, pain, rage, raw energy
and other</B>
<BR><B>emotions that I have never felt before or since. This was a palpable
presence or energy. I became very disoriented and retraced my path back
about 50 yards.</B>
<BR><B>Again I walked towards Little Round Top and again I&nbsp; "hit"
that terrific wall of emotion and energy at the same exact place. This
time I continued walking forward and soon the energy faded and disappeared.
I went back over that area two or three more times and on each occasion
I was hit by a vortex of energy. Soon I became emotionally and mentally
tired so did not return again to that area.</B>
<BR><B>I have been to nearly all the major Civil War battlefields, many
two or three times. I have never encountered anything remotely like that
before or since.</B>
<BR><B>If you go to Gettysburg I suggest that you see for yourself if there
is anything to this. My experience was ten years ago yet theories about
energy hauntings at battlefields holds that such energies can lasts for
dozens and even hundreds of years.</B>

<BR><B>Christmas Ghost</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: robert.bennett@verizon.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I had a very strange experience in a house that I was renting in
Rocky</B>
<BR><B>Point, New York on Christmas Eve 1995. It was well after midnight
and I</B>
<BR><B>was in the living room wrapping the last of the Christmas presents
for</B>
<BR><B>my daughters. My wife was in the kitchen, the next room cleaning
up. I</B>
<BR><B>sat on the couch wrapping the gifts the song silent night was playing
on</B>
<BR><B>the stereo.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always think of my Grandmother when I hear
that song at Christmas</B>
<BR><B>time. We were very close. She died in 1990, one month before my
first</B>
<BR><B>daughter was born. As I continued wrapping and thinking about my</B>
<BR><B>Grandmother, I looked over to my left and noticed that the rocking
chair</B>
<BR><B>was rocking.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing that touched the chair, no draft,
and the house had</B>
<BR><B>baseboard heating, so there was nothing that could have moved the
chair.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called my wife into the room and said outloud
"Alright Grandma,</B>
<BR><B>knock it off." Just as I said that, a ceramic hat was thrown off
of a</B>
<BR><B>ceramic snow man which was on top of the television about ten feet
from</B>
<BR><B>the chair. The hat landed on the floor about 5 feet from the television.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife got into the room just as the hat hit
the floor. We were</B>
<BR><B>both quite spooked by the events. I immediately called my mother
to see</B>
<BR><B>if she was alright, which she was. I never felt threatened and nothing</B>
<BR><B>has happened since then, but makes for an interesting Christmas
story.</B>

<P><B>Hi I'm 19 years old and I've always lived in really old houses. We've
moved from Canada to Florida about 11 yers ago. And now we live in this
beautiful house onthe water. I know its old but nt sure how ols exactly.
I've always had these feelings of someone watching me in my room ever since
we moved in, though I never saw anything.</B>
<BR><B>But thinking someone else is in the room and geting those weird
chills really bothered me , one night they got really bad. I was trying
to get to sleep, so I just ignored them about 5 minutes later I just couldn't
ignore it anymore so I sat up and looked around as I looked over at my
other pillow I noticed smoke coming from it. I put my hand on it but it
wasn't hot it was ice cold.</B>
<BR><B>When I turn to switch my light on I saw a shadow fly quickly under
my door and down the hall at that point I was Freaked! So I screamed for
my parents of course they never believed me , but I still get those chills
to this day.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>I DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED CUS' BACK THEN IT COULD HAVE
BEEN FLU, INDIANS, CIVIL WAR, FIRE, ETC... BUT FOR ONE THING NOW AND THEN
YOU CAN HERE BUT NOT SEE PEBBLES BEING THROWN.&nbsp; ONE PARTICULAR NITE
I WAS OUT WITH MY SON</B>
<BR><B>ON THE PORCH AND WE HEARD THEM AND WE WERE A LITTLE WORRIED THAT
THE MAN ACROSS THE STREET WOULD THINK IT WAS US THROWING PEBBLES AT HIS
VETTE.&nbsp; A WHILE LATER WHEN WE WENT IN THE HOUSE A TALL HUTCH DOOR
OF MINE POPPED OPEN IN MY BEDROOM.&nbsp; I HAVE OFTEN GONE HOME AND ITS
OPEN.&nbsp; I DON'T KEEP ANYTHING</B>
<BR><B>IN IT SO THERE'S NO REASON FOR US TO GO IN IT AND THE DOOR IS HARD
TO OPEN&nbsp; AND IT ALMOST THROWS YOU BACK ONCE IT DOES OPEN WITH A LOT
OF NOISE.&nbsp; TO HANDLE THIS SPOOKY SITUATION I ALWAYS SAY OUT LOUD WHEN
I LEAVE HOME,</B>
<BR><B>"EVERYONE, PLEASE LEAVE EVERYTHING ALONE".</B>
<BR><B>MY SON HAS ALSO SEEN A LITTLE GIRL IN WHITE SKIPPING ALONG AND DISAPPEAR.
HIS ONLY REACTION WAS TO BURST INTO TEARS WITH A FEELING OF GREAT SADNESS.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;MY DAD WAS 77 AND SICK AND HIS BODY WAS BASICALLY WORN OUT
WHEN HE DIED.&nbsp; I SEEN HIM DYING FOR MANY YEARS AND WHEN THE TIME CAME
AND EVERYONE WENT TO SAY THEIR LAST GOOD-BYES, I COULDN'T.&nbsp; I REGRETTED
IT UNTIL HE CAME TO SAY</B>
<BR><B>GOODBYE , ALMOST A YEAR AFTER HE DIED, I THINK HE CAME TO VISIT
AND I DONT THINK IT WAS A DREAM.&nbsp; FIRST OFF, I HAVE MY ALARM SET FOR
6:30 AM EVERY MORNING TO GET UP AND GO TO WORK AND GET THE KID UP FOR SCHOOL.&nbsp;
THIS PARTICULAR MORNING IT WENT OFF AT 5:30 AND I GOT UP AND WOKE UP MY
SON WHO NOTED TO ME</B>
<BR><B>THAT IT WAS STILL TO DARK OUT TO BE 6:30, SO WE TURNED ON THE TV
TO CONFIRM THE TIME AND IT WAS INDEED 5:30.&nbsp; I WENT BACK TO BED AND
DID NOT REALIZE IF FELL ASLEEP ( WHICH I DON'T THINK I WAS REALLY "ASLEEP").&nbsp;
SO ANY HOW THERE</B>
<BR><B>I WAS AND SUDDENLY FELT VERY AFRAID AND THEN RELIEVED AS I LOOK
AT THE FOOT OF MY BED AND IT WAS JUST MY FATHER.&nbsp; (OK, HE'S DEAD),.&nbsp;
I LOOKED AT HIM AND STARTED CRYING MY EYES OUT!, HE SAYS, "WHAT IS THE
MATTER WITH YOU?", I SAID, "IM WORRIED ABOUT YOU".&nbsp; HE SAYS "WHAT
THE HELL ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT</B>
<BR><B>ME FOR, IM BETTER THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN!!!!!&nbsp; I THEN ASKED
HIM IF HE HAD GONE TO SEE MY MOM CUS THEY HAVE HAD SPOOKY THINGS HAPPENING
AND ALL HE SAID TO THAT WAS "IN THE FALL".&nbsp; OK, NOW I DON'T THINK
I WAS DREAMING BECAUSE SOMEHOW I KNEW THAT MY SON WAS COMING IN TO WAKE
ME UP AND TELL ME HE WAS</B>
<BR><B>GOING AND WHEN I WAS TALKING TO MY DAD I REMEMBER HEARING THE SHOWER
GOING. I TOLD MY DAD THAT HE SHOULD HIDE CUS' I DID NOT WANT DEWEY FREAKING
OUT. AND BEFORE I COULD HARDLY FINISH THE SENTENCE MY SON WAS SHAKING ME.&nbsp;
ALSO I WANT TO NOTE THAT MY DAD LOOKED LIKE THE PICTURE OF HEALTH HE DID
WHEN I WAS</B>
<BR><B>IN HIGH SCHOOL SOME 15 YEARS AGO.</B>
<BR><B>ONE MORE INCIDENT I AM GOING TO ADD IS THAT MY MOM LIVES IN ILION,
WHICH FOR YOU HUNTING AND GUN BUFFS IS THE HOME OF THE REMINGTON ARMS CO.&nbsp;
AGAIN A TOWN LOADED WITH HISTORY.&nbsp; SHE WAS WALKING HER DOG AT A LOCAL
PARK, UP THE</B>

<BR><B>Creepy Drawings and the Cold</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bzdiazg67@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My family live in the capital of the state of San Luis Potosi, Mexico.
We all had experienced some strange events over the years. My sister, now
28, was the first. At that time we lived in a small town 7 hours from the
capital that was very small, with an old-fashioned lifestyle.&nbsp; My
dad&nbsp; was sent there to work, so the whole family moved when I was
6 and she was 3 years old, and she had this friend she used to call&nbsp;
my cousin Hen. (yes, the name sounds like the chickens mom)&nbsp; She
started to show this weird behavior: she was talking with someone&nbsp;
that no one else can see or hear but her. Sometimes the conversations lasted
hours and she also took food for him or asked for it.&nbsp; We never could
find where the extra food went to and never saw her eating it. She didnt
allowed us to sit in certain places because he was sat there. All of this
shouldnt be too strange except for one thing:&nbsp; One day, my mother,
a little bit tired of what she thought was my sisters imaginary friend
game, told her that was getting bored of hearing about him.&nbsp; My sister
answer was:&nbsp; Oh, dont worry, he wont come back, he was covered
with blood last time I saw him. I think hes dead.&nbsp; My mom was horrified
cause her daughter was too young for saying such a thing.&nbsp; Were
talking about the 70s early years, in a small town far away from everything,
with only two TV channels you could see on the tube&nbsp; and we never
saw it before without our parents watching too, so it wasnt something
she could have seen&nbsp; on TV (my parents were really careful and even
over-protected us). Anyway, we all thought she was making it up.&nbsp;
One or two days later, she took my crayons and started to draw really creepy
stuff:&nbsp; a tall man shooting a little blonde boy dressed in white shirt
and blue pants, with a large riffle; the boy covered with blood all over
himself; the boy in her own little rocking chair; the boy stuck in a hole,
is one Ill never forget. I asked her to stop it because I was really scared
of it, but said that the cousin Hen wanted her to draw for him. I told
my mom, of course, she freaked out and tore the drawings into pieces, only
to find out later that she was doing it again and again.&nbsp; She took
away from us the crayons, colors, pencils, pens and things like that, but
the little artist always found a way to continue them.&nbsp; My mom told
Brenda that she was sick of it and ordered Hen to get the hell out.&nbsp;
It was the first time she speaks to him directly and she got an answer:&nbsp;
the room got colder, and I mean real cold. It was 10 or 11 in the morning
in a jungle weather&nbsp; with temperature over 38 &deg; C&nbsp; and we
could see our breath in the toys room.&nbsp; The door (that was half open)
was opened and closed with violence&nbsp; as the temperature rose to normal.
Her behavior stopped and she never mentioned another visit after that morning.
Further on, some investigations with the neighbors brought this story:&nbsp;
In the late 50 s, a man from Germany came to this town with his 9-10 years-old
only son (we never knew the boys name, but Hen doesnt sound like a latin
name, believe me).&nbsp; Nobody knew if he was divorced or a widower, but
there was no wife with him. The man bought some lands to the indigenous
and was famous for his cruelty and racism. He lived in a hill with his
boy and some workers.&nbsp; After a year or two the boy disappeared and
the father said that was sent back to Germany, but nobody saw him left
or heard of somebody traveling with the boy,&nbsp; and the man was out
only for a couple of days. Nobody saw the boy again and the man died in
a hunt accident almost 20 years later and never said another word about
his son during that time or received a visit from him. Nobody reclaimed
the property, so the government took it. They never lived in our house
or even nearby, so I dont know why he choose my sister to draw his story
and I wonder if that man killed his son and he told it to her.&nbsp; We
left the town 3 years later to live in the capital of the state and my
sister has no memory of this at all.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Castle in France</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cjandura58@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have a story to tell about a three hundred year old castle around
the south of France. The name of the castle is&nbsp; The Chateau d Ecutigny
, it is currently owned by a wonderful couple Francois and Patrick. We
were passing through the area the summer before last and arranged to stay
one night. The castle is beautiful, the rooms very big and the people wonderfully
friendly. We were asked if we wanted to stay in one of the tower rooms
and we said yeas. The room was huge with a full size sleigh bed about four
feet off the floor for our daughter and a king size bed for me and my husband,
the floor was a stone tile. After settling in Francois told us to meet
in the garden for drinks before dinner and she would give us a tour of
the castle. As we toured Francois told us the story of a family of three,
mother daughter ad husband who lived on the property ll right to sleep
and slept peacefully until morning. I did not mention the story to Francois
until she came into the breakfast room and cheerfully asked&nbsp; did you
see any ghosts last night?&nbsp; I quickly turned and said&nbsp; I felt
the presence and the ghost is a woman, am I right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Francois
just smiled, walked away quickly and would not talk about it again. As
I was leaving that day I felt the presence again and she revealed to me
that she looks after all children who stay over at the castle.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Cape May New Jersey</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MrNipperss@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>One night my friend and I were walking on the beach on Beach Avenue
in Cape May, New Jersey.&nbsp; I'm not sure what the beach is called though.&nbsp;
Well, it was 9:30 and my friend and I were the only ones on the beach.&nbsp;
We started walking up the beach going to our hotel when we saw something
appear a few yards ahead of us.&nbsp; It looked like a horse and it was
galloping from the water to the boardwalk and back to the water.&nbsp;
It was going to fast for a person.&nbsp; We decided to turn around and
run, but once we started to run, something made me turn back around to
look.&nbsp; When I turned around, the thing wasn't there anymore.&nbsp;
We tried telling ourselves that it was only a beach kart( those things
that can ride on the beach) or a car.&nbsp; As we started walking back
to the hotel again, I saw two people walking on the beach towards the water,
but they were dressed in clothes that pirates would wear.&amp;n and she
told us that it was haunted by a black horse that two pirates use to tie
a lantern to to confuse ships to make them believe it is the lighthouse.&nbsp;
The beach is also haunted by two pirates that killed a man by burrying
him in the sand up to his neck.&nbsp; The black thing we saw Friday night
happened to be that person.&nbsp; He was killed by high tide.</B>

<P><B>Bungalow Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ptridish@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was some time ago that i lived in a haunted
house, perhaps, three years now. I was a kid then, and we(my family and
i) lived in a little bungalow, population, 5, myself, my sibling and my
parents. o, and the ghost. It walked back and forth in the hallway, sounding
as if it sometimes tripped and tumbled down towards my parents bedroom.
It was a haunting that began and ended early, long before my parents came
to bed. Occasionally, it would walk straight into my room, and stand at
the side of my bed. I could not take this, and each night, therefore, placed
the covers over my head. When my parents came up, they removed it so that
I wouldn't suffocate. Over time, the haunting went away, and has remained
away for the remainder of the time we lived there.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Brief Hauntings</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: heeree9@juno.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>These are a few different incidents that happened in two houses that
I</B>
<BR><B>lived in.&nbsp; The first occurred in the townhouse I grew up in.&nbsp;
I was 3</B>
<BR><B>years old, and my parents were separated.&nbsp; My mom slept in
my room with</B>
<BR><B>me, and she would sometimes wake up out of a deep sleep because
someone</B>
<BR><B>was lying on top of her.&nbsp; She said it felt just like a human
body; not a</B>
<BR><B>friendly one at that.&nbsp; Also, she would hear a tapping in the
middle of</B>
<BR><B>the night, coming from the wall behind the bed.&nbsp; As she is
deaf in her</B>
<BR><B>right ear, she thought it was the front door.&nbsp; No one was ever
there.</B>
<BR><B>After my parents got back together, this stopped, except for one
isolated</B>
<BR><B>incident.&nbsp; I was about 7 or 8, and I was in bed with the lights
still on.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The bed was in the same position it had been in when my mom
felt the</B>
<BR><B>ghost or whatever lying on her and heard the tapping.&nbsp; She
hadn't told me</B>
<BR><B>about those experiences at this point.&nbsp; I froze as I heard
a tap, tap,</B>
<BR><B>tap.&nbsp; Tap, tap... It was coming from inside the wall, right
behind my</B>
<BR><B>head.&nbsp; As far as I know, there were no mice in that house.&nbsp;
There was no</B>
<BR><B>wind, and no tree branches close enough to tap the windows or walls
on</B>
<BR><B>that side of the house.&nbsp; I called for my mom, but she blew
the noise off</B>
<BR><B>as imagination.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; When I was 13, my parents divorced, yadah, yadah, and my
mom and I were</B>
<BR><B>living in a different house by that point.&nbsp; A couple years
later, I</B>
<BR><B>brought up the tapping story, and she finally told me what happened
to</B>
<BR><B>her.&nbsp; So, earlier this year (2002), after i had moved out,
my mom told me</B>
<BR><B>about some things that were happening recently.&nbsp; One day she
was giving</B>
<BR><B>my little brother a bath, and the only other person in the house
was my</B>
<BR><B>stepdad.&nbsp; She suddenly heard someone in the house calling "Mom?&nbsp;
Mom?!!!"</B>
<BR><B>in a feminine voice.&nbsp; My stepdad does not sound like a girl.&nbsp;
One night</B>
<BR><B>my little brother pointed to my parents' bed and told them to "get
those</B>
<BR><B>people out of here, because they're scaring me."&nbsp;&nbsp; My
stepdad gets up</B>
<BR><B>very early to go to work, and on a couple mornings he could hear
someone</B>
<BR><B>walking around upstairs.&nbsp; He went up to investigate, and everyone
was</B>
<BR><B>still in their rooms asleep.&nbsp; Also early in the mornings, he
would go to</B>
<BR><B>take a shower and find that everything on the towel rod in the shower</B>
<BR><B>(shampoo bottles, mainly) had been placed on the bottom of the tub.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>little brother was only 4 at the time, and my stepbrother would
not have</B>
<BR><B>thought of doing stuff like this.&nbsp; One morning, in the same
bathroom, all</B>
<BR><B>the doors to the cabinet under the sink were standing wide open.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>cabinet smells like mildew due to water damage, so no one in the
family</B>
<BR><B>ever leaves them open.&nbsp; The last thing is the TV in my parents'
room.</B>
<BR><B>They used to leave it on all night, but they had recently started
turning</B>
<BR><B>it off.&nbsp; On a few different nights, my mom was jerked out of
a deep sleep</B>
<BR><B>as if someone had shaken her awake.&nbsp; She then would turn on
the TV until</B>
<BR><B>she fell asleep again.&nbsp; It seemed like their ghost just liked
to watch</B>
<BR><B>TV.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; After about 2 or 3 weeks, everything stopped.&nbsp; They
haven't had any</B>
<BR><B>problems since, so I guess we're luckier than some.</B>

<P><B>Breif Encounters</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: darksquall@ffdreamer.fsnet.co.uk</B><B></B>

<P><B>Im nineteen years old and throughout my life have had brief encounters
with the paranormal or spirit realm.</B>
<BR><B>The first one I can remember took place when I was about 6 years
old. I live in the West Midlands in the centre of England, which has some
fine and beautiful old castles.</B>
<BR><B>My class was undertaking a field trip to one of these castles in
Tamworth, to get work towards our class project at the time. There is a
room off a stone staircase there that has display cases. Its been a long
time so I find it hard to remember a lot of the details. I was looking
at a display next to a heater when I suddenly felt almost overcome with
grief. I was shaking so much my friend asked what was the matter. I couldnt

<BR><B>The sound of footsteps echoed up from the stone stairs and stopped
suddenly, leaving me feeling very cold, despite standing right next to
the heater.</B>
<BR><B>The next one came from my own home. For the first eleven years of
my life, I had a Yorkshire terrier cross called Suzy, who had to be put
down due to cancerous lumps. The night after this, I felt a weight on my
legs, exactly how she used to lie. I felt her again before my nan and two
great uncles died.</B>
<BR><B>My Nan died on the day after her birthday, leaving me very upset
and almost inconsolable. Shed looked after me every time I was ill for
the whole of my life. A week afterwards, I awoke in the middle of the night
to find her kneeling beside my bed as though praying (She had always been
a very religious woman) and mumbling inaudibly. I threw the covers over
my head and hid, when I found the courage to look again she had gone.</B>
<BR><B>She also told me before her death that she often heard footsteps
walk around her bed every Sunday night, and smelt a fried tea, (sausages,
bacon, eggs mushrooms bread tomatoes etc). She maintained that this was
Her Joey my grandfather who had died some twenty six years before.</B>
<BR><B>My great uncle, her brother was very ill last year, but insisted
on staying at home. I went around to see him for a couple of hours one
Sunday after I got out of work at my part time job. When I returned home,
the first words I said without thinking were If he lasts the month itll
be a miracle. I was surprised at myself as it was rapidly nearing the
end of September, and have always felt that they were not my words. Gordon
was dead the next morning.</B>
<BR><B>These are the most prominent experiences Ive had. I have also been
fortunate or misfortunate enough (depending on your views) to have had
a near death experience during one particularly bad asthma attack.</B>
<BR><B>Thankyou for listening, I hope theres room on your site for some
of my story.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Box Dream</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hele@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; By the way, I've been addicted to this page</B>
<BR><B>since 1 wk ago., and I would read them at work and would get scared
going to</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom unless I really have to.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, my story isn't really a ghost story i don't think, it's
more&nbsp; of a</B>
<BR><B>dream which my friends call it the "BOX DREAM".&nbsp; I'm sure most
of you have</B>
<BR><B>experienced it, but that is the only abnormal thing I've ever experienced.</B>
<BR><B>Let me explain what my "box dream" was.&nbsp; I would be sleeping
and it would</B>
<BR><B>almost feel as though I'm just half asleep.&nbsp; It happens to
me a few times</B>
<BR><B>before where when I'm falling into this deep sleep, I would see
all green,</B>
<BR><B>just the color green but I was scared, i couldn't get myself to
wake up or</B>
<BR><B>talk or move.&nbsp; But the worse one was when one night, the same
thing</B>
<BR><B>happened, except no greens.&nbsp; I tried to wake myself, becuz
I was scared, and</B>
<BR><B>I tried to scream and move.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden, I'm on the
floor crawling</B>
<BR><B>right beside my bed towards the door (which happens to be open in
the</B>
<BR><B>"dream"), and as i'm crawling and crying on the floor, i see myself
on the</B>
<BR><B>bed, sleeping.&nbsp; No movement, just sleeping.&nbsp; This is only
weird, cuz it</B>
<BR><B>seems so real, there was no noise, I couldn't hear myself moving
or crying.</B>
<BR><B>I feel it when i'm sleeping, and the whole time when i was sleeping,
i was</B>
<BR><B>thinking to myself, "what is going on?"&nbsp; I finally struggled
and got my self</B>
<BR><B>to move and scream.&nbsp; But no one in the house heard me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What I was told</B>
<BR><B>was that, when you go to sleep at night, your spirit actually arises,
but</B>
<BR><B>not completely out of your body though, but in my case, it sounds
as though</B>
<BR><B>it did.&nbsp; If anyone had these before or understand why that
is, please let me</B>
<BR><B>know.</B>

<P><B>I live in Houston and have been to this place. There is a cemetary
off this road. The first time I went with some friends the trees within
the cemetary were moveing but there was no wind. There were no insects
making sounds nothing and it was at least 10 degrees colder than out of
the cemetary. The next time I went there were torches moving but no one
holding them. We were chased down the road by a figure in black that kept
up with the car that was going 30 mph. When we left and went to get gas
I happen to walk around the back of my car and there were a lot of hand
prints on it even on the tires. My friend recently went out there and took
pictures there and there are some really strange things in these pictures.
I have never in my life felt so in danger being there.</B>

<P><B>By: HBPinkFruitcake@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am 12 years old and my best friend and I decided to play Bloody
Mary one night. We went into the bathroom and did all the rituals, lights
off, etc. My friend got scared half way through so we decided to stop.
I tried to turn on the light and flipped the switch probably 10 times.
It didn't go on. We were so freaked out and I tried to open the door but
it was locked, even though the door didn't have a lock. We started screaming
and my mom heard us and came running. My mom couldn't open the door. I
remember her pounding on it. Thinking quickly, we decided to recite bible
verses. It must have worked because a few seconds later, the lights flicked
on and the door swung open. 'Till this day, I won't go in that bathroom
alone!</B>

<BR><B>Black Shadow from Kentucky</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rhoskins77@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was back in year of 98 me and my husband
Russ (than boyfriend) decided to take our yearly visit from Michigan to
Kentucky. We go down there every year around Thanksgiving to visit his
family. We were already down there for about 3 days aready. One night we
decided to take a trip back into the mountains with his brotherTony,than
girlfriend Jenny and his cousin JimBob.We took our fourwheelers. We were
riding around for about 2 hours and decided to head back to the house.
When all of a sudden I had noticed a strange figure ahead sitting there.
It looked like a big black shadow just sitting there for me. As we passed
it, it had jumped out and kind of lashed out at me. But all of a sudden
it just disappeared. We had all stopped and looked around and there was
nothing there.We were freaked out. Well last year we went down there for
our yearly visit. We were talking to Russ's cousin John and he had said
that he had the same experience and I had 2 years ago. He was in the same
area and was riding his four wheeler through the mountains. A big black
shadow as he described it, had jumped on him and tour his jacket open.
He says he has no idea what it was. He had never seen it again. Of what
stories his family has told me there is so many strange things that had
happened in the city of Middlesboro. That is unexplained.</B>

<BR><B>Best Friend</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: myangelchild2002_taylor@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My best friend killed herself last Christmas Eve at the age of 16.
Even after she died, I always had this feeling that she was still around-
like she was in the room with me. Then a few nights ago, when I was laying
in bed, I felt a presence there with me in the room. I didn't think anything
of it at first I thought it was just my imagination but when I looked
over, I saw my friend standing there in the doorway. I could have sworn
that I had closed the door, but there she was standing there with the door
wide open. At first I couldn't believe my eyes I thought I was dreaming
or something, so I pinched rubbed my eyes but she was still there. I knew
then that she was really there. she just stood there for the longest time
with a smile on her face. she looked so much like she did before she died,
it was like she wasn't even a ghost. after a little while, she opened her
mouth and moved her lips as if saying 'I love you' I rubbed my eyes again,
still not able to believe it. when I opened them again, she was gone. but
I know that she was there, and I know that her spirit is still with me.
I haven't seen her again since then but I feel certain that I will soon.
this really happened, though I couldn't even believe it at first but the
truth is, ghosts do exsist. I know because my friend is one.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Another Story for You</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bulletwithbutterflywings16@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'd just like to start off saying I wrote you one story, on page
11, on 237 called "A Story for You".&nbsp; Since then, I thought I'd send
a little ghostly update.</B>
<BR><B>I just recently moved again, this time to an apartment in Deleware.&nbsp;
Nothing strange has happened here (to me, anyway...my sister says otherwise,
such as a monster in the bathroom).&nbsp; In Brooklyn, though, I had two
ghosts.&nbsp; Two prominent ghosts that lived in one particular room, I
should say.&nbsp; My room.&nbsp; I named them Jack and Jill, because I
didn't know who they were or where they came from, But I decided they'd
probably much rather have a name then be unidentified.&nbsp; They've awoken
me by violently shaking my bedroom door, and jumping on my bed.&nbsp; I've
never feared them much.&nbsp; In fact, they gave me a warm feeling, sometimes,
and in one corner of the house that led to my bedroom and my parents bedroom,
we'd constantly see black shadows moving across the hall, from one room
to another.&nbsp; I'd have to tell friends not to be frieghtened of these
visitors, because on more than one occasion people have fled down the hall,
stuttering they've gotten the oddest chery night that happened, I could
feel it from the same spot.&nbsp; Like a tall man in a black coat holding
something, looking lonely and melancholy, even though I didn't see him,
I felt what he looked like.&nbsp; I may sound crazy, but I was just absoluetly
terrified when that happened, and I'd often feel no other presence, no
Jack and Jill around either.&nbsp; That was very frightening for me, even
through all my "ghostly" expiriences (if that's what you'd call them).&nbsp;
Here in Delaware I haven't had much trouble, but every time I move it always
starts out harmless (I move pretty often, as many know realize).&nbsp;
If there is anything strange, I'll definately send something your way.</B>

<P><B>I Saw A Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sherry@journeyhousetravel.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was about 6 years old. My mother was very ill so the four of us
kids were farmed out to relatives while she was in the hospital. I went
to my Grandmothers house in Osawatomie, KS. It was about 1962. I was&nbsp;
sleeping and I woke up since it started to storm. There was no curtain
in the window at the foot of the bed. I could see the lightning and rain.
The bed was right off the kitchen. I turned towards the kitchen and I heard
the door open outside. There was a big porch with a door from the outside
and another door&nbsp; that led in to the kitchen. The kitchen door opened
slowly. I saw a ghost walking towards me. It was no ordinary ghost. It
was a wolf ghost. It was walking on its two hind legs though. It was transparent.
It could definitely see through it. I was stunned. I could not scream.
It walked to the fridge and it looked like it took some thing off of the
top of it. It turned and walked back out of the door.</B>
<BR><B>Then I let out a big scream. Every one was up. I kept saying I
saw a ghost! I saw a ghost! and my Grandmother was trying to comfort
me. However, the two doors that led to the kitchen were both unlocked now,
and one was open. They all remembered locking them up before bedtime. The
only thing that looked like it was missing was a flashlight from the top
of the fridge. The best part of the story came when I was about 20 yrs
old. I went to their house for their 60th wedding anniversary party. The
cars were all lined up and down the driveway and road. I was talking to
people inside and I heard someone mention the legend of the ghost that
walks the woods! Wow. That was the same ghost that I had seen as a child.
I had put it on the back burner all of those years. Now I realized that
I was not the only person to ever see that ghost.</B>

<BR><B>Dreams</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>In 1997, a good friend of mine, whose name was Bobby, passed away
from a massive heart attack.&nbsp; He was 39 years old.&nbsp; We had met
when we were both in our early 20's by a mutual friend, and we became real
good friends. Our mutual love for the Grateful Dead had us attend a lot
of their shows together, and we just hung out together the way good friends
do.&nbsp; When Bobby was about 28, he developed mental illness.&nbsp; He
suffered from delusions.&nbsp; Often we would talk and he would upset me
because the things he would say didn't make sense.&nbsp; I found him very
difficult to deal with, and having a girlfriend who took up much of my
time, I found less time to visit him.&nbsp; He was on some very strong
drugs for his mental illness,&nbsp; and often he couldn't even be understood
when he spoke.&nbsp; He basically spent the last ten years of his life
living in his mother's basement, playing records and chain smoking cigarettes.&nbsp;
When he passed away, I hoped that he had found the peace he didn't have
for his last ten years.</B>
<BR><B>In November of 2000, I found myself utterly exhausted one night
and had a dream.&nbsp; In it I was going to a bar to meet a couple of women
who worked with me.&nbsp; I walked into the bar and standing right by the
door was Bobby!&nbsp; I knew in the dream that he was dead, but I wasn't
frightened of this.&nbsp; I asked him how he was and he said he was well.&nbsp;
There wasn't any sign of the mental illness, it was Bobby as I remembered
him when he was well.&nbsp; He asked if he could join my friends and I,
and I told him, "Sure."&nbsp; Then he requested that I not tell my friends
about him.&nbsp; I took this to mean not to tell them that he was dead,
and again I told him "Sure."&nbsp; He sat down with us for a short time,
then he got up and left the bar.&nbsp; One of the women sitting with us
asked me to go and check on my friend.&nbsp; I got up from the table only
to humor her, because I knew Bobby was dead.&nbsp; I walked out of the
bar and I saw him standing on the other side of the street.&nbsp; He looked
like he was waiting for a bus.&nbsp; The road went down a medium grade
hill, and he was standing where the road flattened out.&nbsp; That was
where my dream ended.&nbsp; I awoke at that point, and I felt my body trembling
as I came out of the dream.&nbsp; I looked at my clock and it was 1:30
in the morning.&nbsp; I couldn't sleep anymore that night.&nbsp; I felt
that the dream meant something, that Bobby was trying to tell me something,
but I couldn't figure out what it was.&nbsp; For the next few days, I couldn't
get the dream out of my mind.</B>
<BR><B>Two days later, I received a bill in the mail for a tombstone my
family and I had ordered for my mother, who had passed away that summer.&nbsp;
I called the caretaker of the cemetery to find out if the stone had been
delivered, and he told me that it had arrived two days earlier, and had
been installed the previous day.&nbsp; I decided that I wanted to see the
tombstone before I paid the balance of the bill, because I wanted to make
sure it was just as had been ordered.&nbsp; I went to the cemetery that
afternoon, and it was just as we had asked for, no complaints.&nbsp; It
was very emotional to see it, it upset me quite a bit.&nbsp; I said a prayer
for her, and got into my car to leave.&nbsp; My mother is buried on a hillside,
and as I drove down the hill, the road flattened out.&nbsp; For some reason,
I glanced to my left, and there, right by the side of the road, was Bobby's
grave.&nbsp; I can't tell you how fast my heart started beating!&nbsp;
Then I realized that his grave was exactly the distance from my mother's
grave, and on the other side of the street, just as I saw him in my dream.&nbsp;
I didn't attend Bobby's funeral, so I had no idea that he was buried in
that spot, although I did know he was in the same cemetery.&nbsp; I thought
about it for a while, and then I figured it out.&nbsp; The dream I had
happened the night my mother's tombstone arrived, and I feel that the dream
was Bobby's way of saying that when you come to visit your mother, don't
forget to stop and visit me, too!.</B>
<BR><B>Now, whenever I visit my mother, I always stop to visit Bobby, too.&nbsp;
I think that they both like that.&nbsp; I like it, too.</B>

<P><B>The Girl in the White Uniform</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This story happened to me when I was in Primary Four (equivalent
to American Grade 4). Our school is among the top ten in Singapore. During
that time the school was located in a neighbourhood district. The school
building had been there since the 1960s.</B>
<BR><B>During one Arts class, my friend Jess and myself had gotten my hands
dirty from handling crayons. The teacher gave us permission to go to the
girls' toilet on our floor (3rd floor). We were very close friends and
did everything together. That aside, when we got there, I started washing
my hands while Jess went into one of the cubicles. When we got there there
are nobody there and all the cubicle doors were opened.</B>
<BR><B>When I finished washing my hands, I cried to Jess to "hurry up or
the teacher will be angry". Just then, a beautiful girl, whom I estimated
to be at least 12 years old, walked past me out of the main toilet door.
She was wearing a white uniform (that was similar to another famous school
in Singapore) and she had nice long hair. She smiled a bit as I was looking
at her and then she was gone.</B>
<BR><B>When Jess got out, I told her about the girl in white uniform. It
was then that we both realised we had been the ONLY ONES in the toilet.
Besides our school uniform was blue, and school rules forbid girls to keep
long hair. We thought it might be another student in our school on an educational
visit but then, it was only the first week of January, the first week of
school. Programs aren't usually planned this way.</B>
<BR><B>Later we learnt that twenty years before our time, the school building
used to be that of another famous school with a history as long as ours.
The girl was wearing that school's uniform. Apparently, she was a sick
child and had died of asthma, at the door of our toilet. Poor thing.</B>

<BR><B>Alaska Calling</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lingling@gci.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I found your website and thought I would dash off my story.&nbsp;
It really</B>
<BR><B>kind of creeps me out.&nbsp; I would be interested in hearing what
you think</B>
<BR><B>as I have never had this kind of experience before.&nbsp; (Some
folks would</B>
<BR><B>be jealous...I know!)&nbsp; I tried to keep it short, but it doesn't
appear</B>
<BR><B>it is!&nbsp; Apologies.</B>
<BR><B>I work for a helicopter company up here in Juneau, Alaska.&nbsp;
We are a</B>
<BR><B>seasonal operation here in Juneau, with me being the only full-time,</B>
<BR><B>year round employee.&nbsp; That was a decision made just this past
summer.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Usually there are two people in the office in the winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On our work</B>
<BR><B>property we have the "old" hangar, which was here way back in the
50's I</B>
<BR><B>believe.&nbsp; Back then it was owned by a gentleman by the last
name</B>
<BR><B>Livingston.&nbsp; He ran his helicopter operation out of that one
hangar</B>
<BR><B>until he was bought by my company in the mid-70's.&nbsp; Then they
built what</B>
<BR><B>we call the "new" hangar.&nbsp; History has it that the company's
offices</B>
<BR><B>were on the second floor of the "new" hangar during Mr.Livingston's</B>
<BR><B>lifetime.&nbsp; Since then the second floor has also been a dormitory
for</B>
<BR><B>pilots and mechanics.&nbsp; Over the last handful of years however
it has</B>
<BR><B>gone back into being offices and pilots' breakroom/kitchen area.</B>
<BR><B>Since it was decided that I would be the only employee at the base
this</B>
<BR><B>winter people started telling me about the Livingston Ghost.&nbsp;
It is told</B>
<BR><B>that he walks the upper floor to check on things.&nbsp; I have been
there two</B>
<BR><B>winters and never heard anything....Two of our mechanics who are
still</B>
<BR><B>employed with us both told me stories about the ghost.&nbsp; One
mechanic</B>
<BR><B>used to live upstairs and his bedroom was my huge storage closet...right</B>
<BR><B>at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; He said a number of times he would
hear foot</B>
<BR><B>steps in the middle of the night coming up the stairs.&nbsp; He
would race</B>
<BR><B>out into the hall and there would be nobody.&nbsp; Quite a few other
people</B>
<BR><B>have heard the same thing.&nbsp; Our base manager this summer, who
had never</B>
<BR><B>heard anything about the ghost, heard them not long after she arrived
in</B>
<BR><B>Juneau.&nbsp; She got up to see who was there...nobody.&nbsp; People
have yelled</B>
<BR><B>out, "hello" thinking someone has come into the building, nobody
there.</B>
<BR><B>The other story they've told me from when they lived upstairs was
if</B>
<BR><B>they left the back window open, it would be closed in the morning.&nbsp;
Time</B>
<BR><B>and time again this happened.</B>
<BR><B>Luckily I am working mostly from home this winter but I have had
a</B>
<BR><B>couple strange things occur over the past month.&nbsp; First let
me say I had</B>
<BR><B>all the locks changed on both of the hanagars at the start of October.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The only people who have a key are myself and our two mechanics,
who</B>
<BR><B>are both currently out of town working at other bases.&nbsp; Second,
I am the</B>
<BR><B>only one who comes into the "new" hangar at all, I don't even get</B>
<BR><B>visited by the FedEx person!&nbsp; Thirdly I lock the front door
while I am</B>
<BR><B>there so nobody can come in without me knowing.</B>
<BR><B>Since my alone time, which started early October, I haven't heard
or</B>
<BR><B>seen much of anything.&nbsp; And believe me, I have been well aware.&nbsp;
However</B>
<BR><B>on October 30th I went into work to clear things up before I left
on</B>
<BR><B>vacation.&nbsp; As I was getting ready to leave I went to drop off
some</B>
<BR><B>magazine or something on the Lead Pilot's desk.&nbsp; As I walked
into his</B>
<BR><B>office I noticed the outside door to the main hangar was open. This
is</B>
<BR><B>not the main entrance and hadn't been opened since the end of September.</B>
<BR><B>This is just a regular people door, not the big door they open for
the</B>
<BR><B>helicopters.&nbsp; It is however a part of the big hangar door.&nbsp;
I called the</B>
<BR><B>police as the door knob was still in the locked position.&nbsp;
They couldn't</B>
<BR><B>find anything.&nbsp; I know the door was locked before I left on
my previous</B>
<BR><B>visit to work because I always go around the building and check
all the</B>
<BR><B>doors, just to give me peace of mind.&nbsp; This door in particular
I always</B>
<BR><B>double check that&nbsp; it is secured.&nbsp; Later that night I
had to go back to</B>
<BR><B>work to pick something up on the fax machine.&nbsp; I brought my
husband with</B>
<BR><B>me and we drove down on to the helicopter ramp and sure enough that
door</B>
<BR><B>was open AGAIN.&nbsp; We tied the door shut and it hasn't opened
since.</B>
<BR><B>Now, most people and in my own mind I think it could have been the
wind.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Being that this door is part of the big hangar door, perhaps
with the</B>
<BR><B>wind, the big door moved a bit and caused this regular door to pop
open.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;That is what I tell myself.&nbsp; However after this past
Thursday at work,</B>
<BR><B>I am not too sure.</B>
<BR><B>The base manager's office is across the hallway from mine.&nbsp;
It is always</B>
<BR><B>locked before I leave.&nbsp; Most days I open it when I come into
work as it</B>
<BR><B>is also the only way to get to the supply closet.&nbsp; Thursday
I didn't</B>
<BR><B>open it until after I had been there a bit and was getting close
to</B>
<BR><B>leaving.&nbsp; I needed to get an envelope out of the closet so
I put my key</B>
<BR><B>in the door and walked into the room.</B>
<BR><B>Now let's see if I can describe the layout.&nbsp; You walk into
the room and</B>
<BR><B>on your right is a big conference table.&nbsp; On your left, along
the same</B>
<BR><B>wall as the doorway is the closet door (closest to the doorway)
and then</B>
<BR><B>3-4 small file cabinets followed by a huge palm tree-ish kind of
plant.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The plant is in the corner.&nbsp; Now from that corner to
halfway down the</B>
<BR><B>next wall is a window that looks out to the hangar.&nbsp; I would
say it is</B>
<BR><B>about 4 feet long and about 2 feet high.&nbsp; Under the window,
in the</B>
<BR><B>center is a small two shelf bookcase.&nbsp; Next to the bookcase
in the other</B>
<BR><B>corner is a&nbsp; table.&nbsp; The desk sits infront of this table.&nbsp;
This is all</B>
<BR><B>on the left side of the room.&nbsp; Make sense?&nbsp; Hope so.&nbsp;
When you walk into</B>
<BR><B>the room there are exterior windows to your right and along the
front wall.</B>
<BR><B>Okay.&nbsp; On the window sill, which isn't even 2 inches wide,&nbsp;
of the</B>
<BR><B>window that looks out into the hangar, there are two small 4x6 matted</B>
<BR><B>pictures without frames and a plastic twinkie cowboy.&nbsp; The
base manager</B>
<BR><B>thought the twinkie cowboy was kind of funny and bought him this
summer.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;It is for a kid's lunch, you pop his cap up and put a twinkie
inside.</B>
<BR><B>He probably stands about 6 inches high.&nbsp; The two pictures are
on the</B>
<BR><B>right side of the little window sill with the twinkie cowboy all
the way</B>
<BR><B>in the right corner.</B>
<BR><B>When I walked into the room on Thursday, the twinkie cowboy was
laying</B>
<BR><B>face down on top of the bookcase under the window and his hat was
popped</B>
<BR><B>open.&nbsp; Winds?&nbsp; Earthquake?&nbsp; First off, the small
pictures should have</B>
<BR><B>fallen over too.&nbsp; Second, twinkie cowboy didn't fall straight
off the</B>
<BR><B>window sill....he fell at a diagonal to HIS right, my left.</B>
<BR><B>It werided me out and I picked him up and put him back where he
should</B>
<BR><B>be.&nbsp; I got my envelop and left the room.&nbsp; Immediately
after leaving the</B>
<BR><B>room I had to make a phone call.&nbsp; As I was leaving the voice
mail</B>
<BR><B>message I heard an unusual thump coming from the stairs.&nbsp; I
even said on</B>
<BR><B>the phone it was getting a little creepy and I was going home.&nbsp;
I left.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Later that day I had to come back, this was about 2.5 hours
later, to</B>
<BR><B>let a pilot into the building.&nbsp; Because I wasn't about to hang
out all</B>
<BR><B>weekend letting him in and out of the building I told him I would
get</B>
<BR><B>him a key he could borrow.&nbsp; The key box is in that darn supply
closet up</B>
<BR><B>in the base managers office.</B>
<BR><B>Fine.&nbsp; I go upstairs and unlock the door.&nbsp; Mr. Twinkie
Cowboy is now</B>
<BR><B>laying out in the middle of the floor face up.&nbsp; He is all way
out by the</B>
<BR><B>first file cabinet, closest to the door.&nbsp; There is no possible
way for</B>
<BR><B>him to have fallen that distance.&nbsp; I picked him and and put
him back.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>haven't had a reason to go back to work since.&nbsp; Although I
did buy a</B>
<BR><B>package of twinkies today thinking Mr. Livingston might be a bit
upset</B>
<BR><B>there isn't one in the twinkie cowboy.</B>
<BR><B>I immediately sent word to the mechanic about this twinkie cowboy
thing</B>
<BR><B>and he thinks without a doubt it is Mr. Livingston.&nbsp; I called
the base</B>
<BR><B>manager who was there this summer she said it was probably rodents.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>rodent should have knocked the photos down as well. What do you
think?</B>
<BR><B>I don't mind Mr. Livingston coming by to check up on the place if
it is</B>
<BR><B>him, it just weirds me out.&nbsp; I am the only one that is in the
building.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Strange isn't it.</B>

<BR><B>A Voice from the Grave</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: emmet212001@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I only told a few people about my scary experience of my dead father.
A few weeks after my father died, we moved to another place in the same
city. My mother was still working to support the family. She wasn't usually
at home everyday. We lived in a very tight room with one bed and some furnitures.
We had some plastic chairs beside our bed. When I was left alone one day,
I heard a scratching sound but I had no idea what it was. I thought that
it was just our dog Happy who was scratching the wall. I was lying on the
bed that afternoon. I was waiting for my younger sister to come home from
school. After a few minutes, I heard the sound again but this time it was
louder. I got up and looked around but Happy was not there. I saw the plastic
chair in front of me but I just ignored it having no idea that it was moving.
A brief silent passed by. Then I heard the sound ag ain and this time I
really saw the chair moving slowly as if someone was going to move and
lift to me. When I told my mother about it, she didn'</B>
<BR><B>A few days had passed after that incident but I never mentioned
it again to my family. But this time it wasn't me who witnessed it. My
mother and sister actually saw the plastic chair moved. My mother concluded
that the house we lived in was haunted but I refused to believe it. One
night, I was watching my favorite latenight show when I heard a voice of
a man. It was deep. It was a baritone voice just like my father. I turned
off the television set and listened. All I could hear within that period
of silence was the sound of nocturnal insects. But suddenly I heard the
voice again. I couldn't make out what it was saying but I knew that it
was for me.The hair at the back of my head was standing. But then I muster
enough courage and listened attentively to the voice. This time I could
really hear my name being called out by that voice. I knew it was my father.
I tried to locate where that voice came from. I walked around the house
hoping I could convinc myself that It was just my imagination. But the
voice ca</B>
<BR><B>That morning I told my family about it and they were all silent.
When I asked what could be the reason why he came back, my mother told
me that maybe&nbsp; I was still harboring resentments ...maybe because
I was still angry at him. Then I realized that it was true. My mothers
words convinced me that my father was trying to communicate with me to
ask forgiveness.</B>
<BR><B>That voice came back to me for several ocassions. It lasted for
about a month and it usually happened at night when everybody was asleep.
Now I could hear the voice no more. Years rolled by since that voice called
me and now my nights are peaceful. I learned many lessons from that experience
and so it is with my family.</B>

<BR><B>Gettysburg</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: K_Sentz@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This is slightly interesting, although it happened a while ago.</B>
<BR><B>When I was younger I lived in a row house in Gettysburg, on a side
note, my father had lived in that same house for a few years when he was
a child. I have 3 younger sisters and a younger brother so hearing noises
wasn't something unheard of. I can no longer remember the year but the
events began when the youngest was no younger than 2 years of age, I would
have been around 12 yrs old or so.</B>
<BR><B>First, the vacuum begin to turn itself on and off at random. Granted
it was old so we chalked it up to short circuits. The little kids would
go to a sitter, and I would be alone in the afternoon after school. I began
to hear people walking, moving around upstairs. I didn't chalk it up to
neighbors because, amazingly, that was the only house I lived in whose
walls were not paper thin. Apparently, I wasn't the only one who heard
this. One day my father pulled me aside and asked me if I had skipped school.
I hadn't, and this disturbed him greatly because he had heard people walking
upstairs. My father doesn't excite easily.</B>
<BR><B>So we heard occasional movings and such. Their were only three times
I was ever truely freaked out. Once when I was 14 I was talking on the
telephone about some of the funny noises when suddenly I found myself lying
on the ground, wet. Was I sitting in a folding chair, yes. Did I have a
glass of water near me, yes. However, the chair only folded one way and
could hold up to 300 lbs without breaking. It had folded the wrong way,
backwards. I wasn't leaning back in the chair, either. The glass of water
was at least 6 inches from either side of the desk, I noticed that it hadn't
tipped over when I got back up, it was in the same spot, almost empty.</B>
<BR><B>If that wasn't enough to scare the daylights out of me, around the
same time period I was listening to a cd, getting ready to go to bed. I
said aloud," as soon as this songs over I'll go to sleep." I wasn't anywhere
near the cd player when the song repeated itself. Thankfully, it repeated
itself only once. Still in that same time period, I was searching my room
for a blue colored pencil. I talk to myself quite often and made the comment,
"Where the heck is that stupid blue pencil." I heard a light thud. I turned
went to sound where a book a had put on top of my desk, again, not near
the edges, nor ontop of something, It had fallen open with the cover up
towards me. I picked up the paper back, and having done so, saw my blue
colored pencil.</B>
<BR><B>We moved when I was 15 almost 16. Small goings on happened now and
then, nothing too freaky. Although my brother claimed to actually see a
ghost when he was 5. Stated he saw it come through the wall into his room
then up through the ceiling. Stated that it was "glowy" with no eyes/ black
holes. That was all I could get out of him.</B>
<BR><B>Since we moved, not much has happened.</B>
<BR><B>I recently moved away from Gettysburg and haven't had anything major
happen.</B>
<BR><B>If you are interested, there is my story. It seemed not necessarily
scary when it happened, just kind of There.</B>

<P><B>A Paranormal Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lysgm@pivot.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a story to tell but I don't think it actually falls into the
"ghost</B>
<BR><B>story" category...&nbsp; Really, it is a story my father told me
one evening</B>
<BR><B>while we were at a family member's funeral.&nbsp; First, some background:&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>moved from Maine to California in 1984 to be with my (then) young
husband.</B>
<BR><B>I was only 19 at the time, hardly old enough to even be married!&nbsp;
My husband</B>
<BR><B>had gone to find a place to live, etc, and I followed a month or
so later.</B>
<BR><B>My last month in Maine, I lived with my parents.&nbsp; Now, my dad
and I had</B>
<BR><B>never enjoyed a close relationship; in fact, we were estranged by
the time I</B>
<BR><B>stepped onto that plane for LA.&nbsp; My mother and brother drove
me to the</B>
<BR><B>airport; I did not even say good-bye to my father.</B>
<BR><B>I stayed in California for 2 years. I went to college and had an
interesting</B>
<BR><B>job at a dental clinic.&nbsp; However, as I mentioned previously,
I was much too</B>
<BR><B>young to have married and soon found myself in the midst of a very
volatile</B>
<BR><B>relationship with my husband.&nbsp; In the summer of 1985, I discovered
I was</B>
<BR><B>pregnant.&nbsp; I was very worried because by that time, I realized
I had made a</B>
<BR><B>mistake by getting married.&nbsp; The thought of a baby was almost
overwhelming</B>
<BR><B>to me.&nbsp; I became depressed and withdrawn.&nbsp; I actually
lost weight at the</B>
<BR><B>beginning of my pregnancy.</B>
<BR><B>Around this time, I began receiving occasional packages and letters
from my</B>
<BR><B>dad.&nbsp; The notes he would send would always be encouraging and
loving.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>almost fell out of my chair when I read the first letter from him.
The</B>
<BR><B>packages were usually something pretty for the house, or maybe a
pair of</B>
<BR><B>earrings. What had come over my father?&nbsp; This just wasn't like
him.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>answered his letters enthusiastically.&nbsp; Maybe my dad and I
would have a real</B>
<BR><B>father-daughter relationship after all.</B>
<BR><B>Time passed.&nbsp; It was September,1989.&nbsp; I had had my daughter
(and what a</B>
<BR><B>beauty she is!) and divorced my husband.&nbsp; I had remarried a
great guy, and</B>
<BR><B>was living back in Maine.&nbsp; My parents had also divorced.&nbsp;
My siblings and I</B>
<BR><B>were all at a wake and were sitting in a back room talking about
life after</B>
<BR><B>death, spiritual experiences and the like.&nbsp; My dad was a life
long atheist,</B>
<BR><B>and I half expected him to make a smart-ass comment about our topic
of</B>
<BR><B>conversation, but instead he told me this:&nbsp; 3 years earlier,
while I was</B>
<BR><B>still in California, he awakened in the middle of the night with
a start.</B>
<BR><B>It was almost as though he had been shaken awake.&nbsp; He sat up
in bed and</B>
<BR><B>looked near the corner of his room.&nbsp; There I was.&nbsp; I was
standing in his</B>
<BR><B>room as clear as day with what he perceived to be a distraught look
upon my</B>
<BR><B>face.&nbsp; He made a point of picking his watch up from the nightstand
to check</B>
<BR><B>the time and to make sure he was fully awake.&nbsp; He also pinched
himself.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>was wide awake.&nbsp; I was there in his room.&nbsp; I did not speak.&nbsp;
I was just</B>
<BR><B>there, looking at him with a pained expression.</B>
<BR><B>I don't remember if he told me if I just disappeared, or how I left
the</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; I cannot ask him now, as he passed away in 1993 from
cancer.&nbsp; This</B>
<BR><B>story really freaked me out.&nbsp; A "living ghost"?&nbsp; how can
it be?&nbsp; I wondered</B>
<BR><B>about this story for years, especially after his death.&nbsp; I
still have no</B>
<BR><B>idea what happened or how this could happen.&nbsp; Whatever the
reason, I believe</B>
<BR><B>it served to bring my father and I closer.&nbsp; Perhaps that experience
helped</B>
<BR><B>my father see how much a girl needs her father.&nbsp; It's probably
no</B>
<BR><B>coincidence that this occurred during the most difficult time in
my young</B>
<BR><B>life.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A New Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SMHoewing@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A while ago I had written a story about a cemetary I had visited.&nbsp;
Since then I have gone to several "haunted places" and I had a terrible
experience.&nbsp; Since this experience I have not purposefully looked
for ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>My two best friends and I decided to play the Ouija board one night,
event though we knew the risks.&nbsp; But we were bored and slightly intoxicated
when we pulled out the board.&nbsp; I got out some candles that had been
blessed by a Wiccan friend of mine.&nbsp; Each of us had our own candle
to ourselves, along with candles lit about the room.&nbsp; We got out some
Pepsi to drink and some crackers to eat.</B>
<BR><B>I lit the candles and we began to play.&nbsp; I asked for only non
evil spirits to come through and that they would be welcomed, whereas if
any evil spirits came, we would drive them out.&nbsp; At first nothing
happened, but then a cold chill ran down my spine and my candle blew out.&nbsp;
The oracle started moving around in a frantic manner, so frantic that my
fingers and my friends' fingers weren't even touching it.&nbsp; It jumped
and my candle lit by itself.&nbsp; By then I had started crying like a
baby (I do that when I get very frightened) and my friends were starting
to get hysterical.&nbsp; My boyfriend came in the house and it seemed to
go back to normal.</B>
<BR><B>We started to play again and we contacted a spirit.&nbsp; It seemed
friendly so we asked if it wanted tot alk to any of us.&nbsp; It said it
did and started moving around.&nbsp; We asked it who they wanted to talk
to, but it didn't answer.&nbsp; So we asked what it wanted to talk about.&nbsp;
It told us that it wanted to talk about a death.&nbsp; I became frightened
b/c I knew where it was going.</B>
<BR><B>I told my friends that we needed to stop and banish the spirit b/c
it was a bad spirit.&nbsp; At that moment I heard deep male chuckling and
my candle went out again.&nbsp; I tried to light it again, but it wouldn't
stay lit.&nbsp; The oracle started jumping again and it fell to the floor.</B>
<BR><B>My black cat, Thor, started to hiss and spit at a corner of the
room.&nbsp; He began to back up and his hair was sticking up.&nbsp; He
swatted out a paw, and then his hissing stopped and strangled meows began.&nbsp;
I ran over to him and picked him up.&nbsp; He scratched me and hid in my
arm.</B>
<BR><B>During this whole time, none of my cats left me.&nbsp; They all
stayed right next to me and they seemed to be protecting me.&nbsp; Thor
seemed to have tried to hurt it and ended up getting hurt himself.&nbsp;
My mother came and blessed my home and told me that my cats are my protecters.&nbsp;
She told me that fate had played its hand when I found the kittens and
took them in b/c they were sent to protect me from an evil that would later
try to enter my home.&nbsp; I had 7 cats and now only have 5.&nbsp; They
weren't killed by the ghost.&nbsp; 2 were given to the animal shelter,
where one later died.&nbsp; I have regretted that decision to this day
and wish that I had kept them.</B>
<BR><B>Thor sits next to me from time to time (he keeps to himslef mostly)
when there is a presence.&nbsp; He always seems to place himself in front
of me.&nbsp; I know now that my decision to play the Ouija Board has caused
my house to be open to evil spirits and now I have no choice but to move.&nbsp;
But be sure that my babies will be going with me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: keko@rcn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was 5 years old my grandmother had a big family reunion picnic
at her house; this would have been in August of 1955.&nbsp; The picnic
lasted far into the night, with the grown-ups sitting on the patio with
their iced tea and exchanging family stories and us children playing hide
and seek in dark.&nbsp; Since we lived in the country with no near neighbors,
and surrounded by corn fields, woods, a barn and big barn yard, it really
was quite dark.&nbsp; During the game, I decided to go into the house to
hide.&nbsp; I went into the living room and sat in an armchair in the far
corner of the room.&nbsp; As I sat back in the chair I felt cold all over,
the kind of cold that causes you to shiver, the hair on my arms stood up
and I felt as though someone was watching me.&nbsp; I turned my head and
at the opposite end of the living room I saw a man.&nbsp; He was tall and
thin and wore dark blue pants and a red and white check shirt.&nbsp; He
looked at me very sadly and then vanished into thin air.&nbsp; I wasn't
afraid, I didn't think he was a ghost because at the age of 5 I imagined
ghosts were white see-through creatures that shouted "BOO!" but I had no
idea who he was or where he went.&nbsp; I could hear the voices of the
grown-ups and cousins shouting as one by one they were found.&nbsp; Then
it happened again: the cold, the feeling someone was in the room with me.&nbsp;
Turning my head again, he was back.&nbsp; For about five seconds we stared
at each other.&nbsp; Me puzzled, him looking sadly at me.&nbsp; Then he
disappeared.&nbsp; About 20 years later I was helping my grandmother clean
her attic.&nbsp; While going through the drawer of an old bureau she said,
"Here's a picture of your grandfather that was taken just a few weeks before
he died."&nbsp; Although the photo was in black and white, you could tell
the man was tall and thin, was wearing dark pants and a check shirt of
some kind.&nbsp; I realized it was the man I had seen all those years ago.&nbsp;
"That's some shirt," I told my grandmother.&nbsp; "Oh, that was his favorite
shirt.&nbsp; It was red and white check and he always wore it with his
dark blue pants."&nbsp; Very interesting, isn't it?&nbsp; He had died in
August 1949, 11 months before I was born.</B>

<BR><B>A Haunted Caravan</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ebola9@iprimus.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I have been reading stories on your site now for well over
two years and have finally decided to submit one of mine. It happened a
long time ago and hopefully it won't be too long. Well here goes,,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; When I was around the ages of eight to nine, my mother and
stepfather lost their new home due to an inability to keep up with mortgage
repayments. My stepfather's parents owned a caravan at a holiday site which
also hosted permanent sites and we stayed there for a while until we could
find some accomodation. After around three months of staying at that caravan,
my family bought another van at that same caravan park. This new van was
quite cheap and came fully furnished which I did not find strange at the
time. After cleaning up the van and throwing out a lot of old furniture
our family moved in and that's where it all began.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Now I come from a line of first born daughters that have
all inherited fey abilities, although we can supress them if they become
too distressing. This wasn't my first experience with the supernatural
but it is the most memorable. Once we moved in my parents slept in the
annexe of the van whilst my younger brother and I slept in the caravan
proper. The large double bed we slept in came with the van and was a permanent
fixture. On the very first night we slept in that bed, we realised that
something strange was with us in that room. Every night around half an
hour after we had laid down in bed, the door to the room would slide open,
and then someone unseen would sit on the end of the bed. Sometimes they
sat down softly, but at other times they seemed to literally leap onto
the bed, and each time it was accompanied by the squeaking of the bedsprings.
As the bed dipped due to the weight of the unseen sitter, we could hear
the sound of someone removing their clothes, then the covers would pull
themselves back and someone would lie down next to us. Now we were virtually
cuddled up together as there wasn't much room left for us to lay down comfortably,
even though we couldn't see this thing, it felt very, very solid. After
a while the sound of snoring would start from the direction of the entity
and slowly it's presence would fade away, leaving us free to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; After a few weeks of this happening each night, we decided
to tell our mother what was going on. Of course she didn't believe it and
we got the old "It's only your imagination" speech, but time would soon
prove otherwise. My mother and stepfather were a very argumentative couple
and very soon there came a night where my mother chose not to sleep in
the same bed as my stepfather. Whilst we slept on an air bed in the lounge
room, she took over our bed in the van bedroom. Now she has never told
us what happened when she slept there, but within a week or so that bed
was ripped out and two new single ones installed. Now to get that bed out
of that van you would have had to literally rip it out of the floor, so
I gather that the experience warranted the trouble they went to to get
it out of there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; That wasn't the end of the spirit though. I first saw him
one day when my brother and I were alone in the caravan. We were watching
a kiddies show on the television in the lounge area of the annexe. It was
around four pm and our parents were out doing the weekly shop. For some
reason I looked to my right where the doorway leading to my parents bedroom
was and I saw a man dressed in black tracksuit standing there watching
us. Now, that man looked as real as anyone i've ever laid eyes on, nothing
ghostly about him whatsoever upon first observation. Well, I immediately
thought that this was an intruder and we were done for. I started to elbow
my brother urgently as this man continued to stare at me. My brother looked
over at what I was pointing at and he also saw the man. By now we were
both frightened quite badly, but the man still stood there watching us
without changing his expressin which was set into a scowl. In the next
few seconds however, he simply disappeared, i mean he just wasn't there
anymore and we could hear the door in my parents bedroom which led to the
back room containing the laundry and storage room of the van open and slam
shut. Now we never saw him turn and run nor did we see a slow vanishing,
just one second there the next not. Now my brother and I looked at each
other and started to whisper about what we both saw. We decided after around
two minutes that we better see where he went as we still thought he was
an intruder. So we went through our parents room to the door to the laundry
room. The door was stilled locked which was strange as you cant lock it
from the outside. We opened the door and looked through the Laundry and
storage areas and could not find anyone at all. There is no way to get
out of that room and certainly no way for that man to get out of that caravan
except by going past the lounge room which we just left to search for him.
No trace was ever found of him and we never had that experience again in
that van.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; The only other thing that used to happen was that each night
I would get woken up by my bedroom door opening and seeing the silhouette
of a man standing there just watching me. I was never afraid of him and
would just go back to sleep, all I could feel was his curiosity. A few
years ago my mother and stepfather moved out of that place and when I talked
to my mother about the goings on that happened there she started to tell
me about her seeing a black clothed man in the van as well. She had never
told us because she felt that we were coping well by believing we were
imagining it and there was no way we could move out to anywhere else with
their financial situation. Apparently the caravan was put up for sale after
the man who had owned it died. It was his holiday van and he loved the
place very much, so much that when he was dying he wanted to pass his last
days there. He would always wear a black tracksuit around the van and this
is what he was found in when he died in his bed, the same one we slept
