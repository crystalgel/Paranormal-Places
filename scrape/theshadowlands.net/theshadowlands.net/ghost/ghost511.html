<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Years
ago, I was an apprentice at the Berkshire
Theatre Festival for a summer. The residence hall and outlying property
had
many interesting occurrences, but the most spectacular was a late-night
visit a
friend and I took to the Stockbridge Cemetery. We had heard that in the
middle
of the cemetery, a long-ago group of Puritans had themselves buried in
a circle
so that when the Rapture came, they would rise from their death sleep
to greet
one another face-to-face. It was also reported that one of the
residence of the
circle buried had her dog beside her. Also of note, the cemetery boasts
the
final resting place of Norman Rockwell. It was a pleasant evening in
late July,
and as is usual in the Berkshires, the evening was cool. My friend and
I left
the Red Lion Inn and walked to the gates of the cemetery. The paths in
the
cemetery were not paved, but consisting of gravel. There was plenty of
ambient
light from the streetlights, nearby houses, and a faint moon as we
easily
strolled, chatting about this and that. Both of us soon realized we
weren&#8217;t
alone in the cemetery as we heard rustling of a person or an animal or
two<span style="">&nbsp; </span>were moving about among the
gravestones.
Every once and a while, a shadow<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of
movement
in our peripheral vision would catch our attention. My friend and I had
a good
chuckle about what we assumed were kids, out late on a summer night
having a
little fun. I even recall when I turned my focus to one of the shadow
figures
that I caught in the corner of my eye, the &#8216;kid&#8217; seemed to slink behind
a
tombstone. At the end of our path, there was a little grove of trees,
and
beyond lay the circle of gravestones. There was enough light that we
could read
the names and dates on the stones. As we marveled at this piece of
history , we
continued our pleasant chatter, not really feeling spooked or anything
unusual
until we both noticed what sounded like four legs padding across spongy
earth.
There was also the panting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I commented
that there was a dog nearby, and my friend agreed, he calling out to
it. That
is when I realized that the &#8216;dog&#8217; sounded and felt<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>as though it should have been standing
between us, yet there was nothing there. It was at that time my friend
commented that it made him uncomfortable to be walking over someone&#8217;s
grave in
the daylight, and doubly uncomfortable to be doing it in the middle of
the
night. I agreed and we both commented how inconsiderate we were being
and
headed back to the gravel path. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shaking
off our little scare, it was obviously much brighter and open on the
path. We
relaxed immediately <span style="">&nbsp;</span>and resumed our
small talk,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>wondering if the kids grew
tired of their game and had gone home. As we walked, we both became
aware, at
pretty much the same time, of a feeling of unease. In addition to our
shoes
crunching the gravel, there was a third crunch of steps behind us,
kicking
little pebbles at our heels. We both stopped at the same instant, and
whatever
was walking behind us took a few extra steps before it stopped. Slowly,
we both
turned around, with me, hoping against hope to see some cheeky 13 year
old. The
path stretched back to the grove of trees, empty. We looked at one
another and
silently agreed just to calmly continue down the path. Unfortunately, I
am not
adept at judging distances, but upon the point of realizing we weren&#8217;t
alone
and however many feet to the gate wouldn&#8217;t have been considered a great
distance,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but having my back to an
invisible companion kicking stones at my heels really can make a short
distance
feel like miles. In silence except for the gravely crunch of three sets
of
footsteps, we finally made it to the gate. We stepped onto the sidewalk
and
apologized to our companion for being disrespectful, assuring it that
we meant
it no harm and we would go. Terribly relieved, my friend and I headed
back to
the Red Lion, giggling nervously about what had just happened until the
it
became apparent that in addition to our own footsteps on the cement,
there was
still, a third. Repeating the incident in the cemetery, we both stopped
and our
companion took a few extra steps. We turned, once again, to an empty
path. My
initial instinct was to bolt, but my friend grabbed my arm and warned
me to be
calm, it would be all right, we should just quietly and certainly head
back to
the Red Lion and our invisible companion would lose interest, or
possibly even
stop at the intersection ahead of us as the cemetery didn&#8217;t cross over
to the
next block.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite my friend&#8217;s
reassuring hand on my elbow<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as we
walked, the feeling in the air was gradually becoming more and more
oppressive.
It was all I could do to focus ahead me. Not far from the curb, I shook
my
friends hand off and bolted across the street to the other sidewalk.
Once
safely on the other side, I turned to see my friend trying to keep his
casual
pace, face pale and hands shaking. He wasn&#8217;t happy with me when he
finally set
foot on the other side. But our companion stopped and as we stood
looking at
the opposite side, the feeling was almost palpable. It felt as though a
physical presence, a real mass were standing there, watching us.
Heading back to
the Red Lion, we agreed that whatever it was that followed us wasn&#8217;t
malicious,
but wasn&#8217;t happy with us being there. We had trespassed, and like an
afterlife
bouncer, it had escorted us off its property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

through my dad's old airplane school photos and in one photo two things
caught
my eye. In the window above the rows of students there was a bluish
sparkling
thing but it wasn't any reflection. The window was open and what seemed
to be
the head of the figure was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span

was that there was this man called Freddy Jackson who was an air
mechanic well

had died

after

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Hello,
First Off I Must Tell You, I Feel The Need To
Explain Every Detail Of This Story, So It&#8217;ll Be Somewhat Long.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>First Off, Some Background.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My Name Is Casey, And The First Time I Had
An Encounter With This Entity I Was 17, I Was With My Father, His
Girlfriend
(We Will Call Them Robert &amp; Lorie), And My Half Brothers From My
Father
Previous Marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, We Were Bored
At Home, It Was Roughly 12 AM, And Since I Live In BFE, We Decided To
Head Out
To Our Local &#8220;Haunted Attraction&#8221; Which Is Bragg Road (It&#8217;s An 8 Mile
Stretch
Of STRAIGHT Dirt Road Nestled In The Woods Between FM 787 &amp; FM 1293
In
Thicket, Texas). We Arrived At Bragg At About 12:30 Or So, And Our
Visit To The
Road Was Quite Typical, It Was Cold, Quiet, And We Saw Nothing. Tonight
However,
We Were Armed With Some New Information, I Had Been Asking Around And
Looking
For The Haunted Cemetery. The Cemetery (Known As Sutton),<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, I FINALLY Figured Out Where
The Road Was, I Was Excited, As Was Everyone Else. Once We Had Gotten
Off Of
Bragg Rd And Arrived At The Cemetery The Mood Of The Group Totally
Changed, As
Well As The Outside Temperature Of The Truck. We Actually Thought
Little Of
This, Since The Cemetery Was Way Off In The Boonies (As In Surrounded
By Woods)
I Just Figured The Wind Couldn&#8217;t Reach The Area, And Therefore Stayed
Colder
Since The Air Wasn&#8217;t Being Changed As Rapidly As The Surrounding Areas.
Dad
&amp; Lorie Were Immediately Reluctant To Leave The Truck, As Were My
Step-Brothers. I, On The Other Hand, Was Out Of The Truck With Camera
In Hand
Almost Before We Came To A Stop. As I Walked Through The Opening Where
The Gate
Was, I Instantaneously Was Attracted To The Rear Center Of The
Cemetery, So Of
Course, I Started Walking To That Area. My Dad &amp; The Rest Of The
Group Were
Just Now Making Their Way Out Of The Truck, I Was About 60 Feet From
Them.
Walking To The Back Of The Cemetery I Felt A Weird Tingling Sensation,
Almost
Like Static Electricity; I Again Played This Off As The Temperature
&amp; Lack
Of Humidity. Once I Got To The Back, And Saw What I Wanted To See (Just
A
Single, Lonely Headstone, Which Frightening Enough To Me, Displayed My
Last
Name) I Began Walking Back To The Front To Meet-Up With My Family. I
Had Gone
About 40 Feet From The Gravestone, And Was Making My Way Through A
Small
Gathering Of Trees To Get Back Out To The Front (Looking Back I Could
Have Gone
Around The Gathering Of Trees &amp; Shrubs, But For Some Reason Didn&#8217;t)
When I
Heard What Sounded Like My Footsteps Echoing! I Felt This Was EXTREMELY
Strange,
And Could Not Find A Way To Easily Explain It, So I Stopped Walking
&amp; Held
My Position&#8230; The &#8220;Echoing&#8221; Stopped. Satisfied That It Was An Echo, I
Began
Walking Again, This Time The &#8220;Echo&#8221; Was Louder, So Once Again I Froze
In Place.
Once Again The &#8220;Echo&#8221; Stopped, I Was Almost Ready To Start Walking
Again; When
Suddenly (Now What I Call Footsteps) Began Again, And I WASN&#8217;T WALKING!
I
Darted Out Of The Grouping Of Trees &amp; Headed Back To My Family.
They,
Promptly I Might Add, Noticed I Was Shaken, And Asked What Was Wrong, I
Told
Them Nothing. We Lingered Around For A Few More Minutes, Then Headed
Back To
The House. Once We Got Back It Was About 3:00 AM, We Sat On The Porch,
And That
Was When I Relayed My Encounter. My Dad, Immediately Afterwards Stated
That He
Had, Indeed, Seen Something Following Me. He Described It As Being
About 8 Feet
Tall, Since I Am 6&#8217; 1&#8217;&#8217; The 2 Feet The Figure Had On Me Was Easily
Noticed. He
Went On To Describe That The Figure Was All Black, With No Discernable
Features, Clothes, Or Eyes, And That It Had It&#8217;s Hands On The Small Of
My Back
/ Waist Area. I Did Forget To Mention That It Was A Full Moon Out, So
It Was
Highly Unlikely That He Was Seeing Things. I Told Him That He Was
Completelty
Insane, And Went Inside To Get Ready For Bed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Flash Forward 1 &amp; &frac12; Years. I Had Just Turned 18,I Had
Recently Moved
To La Porte (Texas),<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Was Taking GED
Classes At Lee College Of Baytown (Located On Texas Avenue). It Was
About 1
Month Into My Second Semester, And Class Had Just Finished, It Was
About 9:15
PM. I Had Stayed Outside At The Picnic Table To Talk To My Friend (Who
We Will
Call Kayla), And To Have A Cigarette Since Class Had Been 3 Hours Long.
Well,
We Chatted For A Few Minutes When We Said Bye And Parted Ways. I Had
Parked My
Car Right At The Front, But Kayla Pared Across The Parking Lot. The
Parking Lot
Was Empty Except For Me, Kayla, And One Or Two Other Cars. I Got In My
Car, The
Door Was Still Open, And My Left Leg Was Still Outside On The Pavement.
I Put
The Key In The Ignition, Set My Bag In The Passenger Seat, And Was
About To
Close The Door When The Rear-View Mirror Caught My Eye. Please Keep In
Mind
That The Dome Light Was Still On In The Cabin. There, In The Back Seat,
Sitting
Right In The Middle, Was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE FIGURE, The
One I Now Presume Was What I Encountered In The Cemetery Nearly 2 Years
Before,
The Way It Was Sitting In The Back Seat Made It Look Damn-Near
Impossible For
It To Be There, It Was SO TALL. The Head Was Cocked To The Left, And It
Was
Looking Right At Me! Now Once Again The Figure Had No Eyes, Face,
Clothes,
Smell, Or Discernible Features, But It Was THE BLACKEST THING I HAVE
EVER SEEN.
I BOLTED From My Car, And Damn-Near Killed Myself Tripping Over The
Median.
When I Got Up, I Continued Running Until I Reached My Friend Kayla&#8217;s
Truck&#8230; She
Was About To Pull-Out, But Stopped When She Saw Me Running. I Told Her
The
Whole Encounter Through My Hyperventilating And Tears, After Which She
Calmed
Me Down, Drove Me Back To My Car, Prayed With Me, And Then Said &#8220;Get
In, I&#8217;ll
Follow You Home&#8221;. I Had No Problem With This, Since She Lived In La
Porte As
Well. Kayla Followed Me Home, And Said Goodnight. I Went Inside, Now
Completely
Unsure If I Had Really Seen What I Just Saw. This Was To Be My Last
Encounter
With The &#8220;Thing&#8221; For Another Year. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Flashing
Forward Once Again. I Had Moved Back To Saratoga, And Was Having A
Quiet Night
At Home. My Friend (Who We Will Call Alyssa) Called Me And Wanted Me To
Come
Visit, She Lives In Anahuac Which Is About 45 Minutes From Me In
Saratoga. I
Got Up,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fixed My Hair, Changed My
Clothes, And Got In The Car At About 9:00 PM. I Drove The 30 Some-Odd
Mile
Distance To Anahuac, Where I Visited With My Friend For About 3 &amp;
&frac12; Hours.
When It Was Time For Me To Go, My Other Friend (We&#8217;ll Call Him Shane,
Who Is Alyssa&#8217;s
Father) Walked With Me Outside While I Started My Car To Let It Warm
Up. It Was
About 1:00 AM. I Stared My Car, Then Me &amp; Shane Sat On The Porch
Smoking
For Roughly 10 Minutes Until I Felt The Car Had Warmed Sufficiently For
Me To
Drive (This Was 2 Months Ago, October 2011). I Bid My Goodbyes And Got
Into The
Car. I Had Driven About 10 Miles, Down FM 563 &amp; Made My Right Turn
Onto FM
770 Which Runs Between FM 563 &amp; Hwy 90 (I&#8217;m Not Sure Why, But That
Detail
Seems Important). About 2.5 Miles Down FM 770 I Had To Pee, Figuring
That There
Was No-One Around To See Me, I Stopped The Car On The Side Of The Road,
Did My
Business, And Returned To The Car. I Started Driving Again, And Had
Proceeded
Down The Road About 1 Mile When I Started Noticing Darting Shadows To
The Right
Side Of The Road; I Passed This Off As Wisps Of Fog, Since It Was Cold&#8230;
I
Continued Seeing The Darting Shadows For The Next 5-10 Minutes Until I
Was
About One Half Mile From Highway 90, On Which I Would Turn Right.
That&#8217;s When
It Happened, Behind Me I Noticed That Their Were 3 Street Lights That I
Could
See Out Of The Side Mirrors, Yet Only 1 Was Visible In The Rear-View
Mirror. I
Found This Strange, But Passed It Off Since The Auto-Dimming Rear-View
Mirror
Was Doing It Job, And Was Dimmed. I Was Just Humming Along, Okay,
Actually I
Was Singing At The Top Of My Lungs, The Song That Was Playing On The
Radio
(Fancy, By Reba McEntire). Now Here&#8217;s Some More Of My Annoyingly Placed
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Background
Information! The Car I Was In Was A 2000
Chevrolet Lumina, It Didn&#8217;t Have An Auxiliary Input For My MP3 Player,
So I Had
The Zune Connected To One Of Those Cigarette Lighter FM Modulators That
Broadcasted The Song To The Radio. The Zune Was Sitting In The
Passenger Seat,
As I Was Alone In The Car (Or So I Thought), I Had The Doors Locked, As
Well As
The Windows (Don&#8217;t Ask Why, It Just Made Me Feel Safer). I Was Just
About To
The Intersection, And Right After The Part<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Part Of The Song (If Anyone Of Y&#8217;all Knows Reba) Where She
Says
&#8220;Wadn&#8217;t Long After A Malevolent Man Took Me In Off The Streets, One
Week Later
I Was Pouring His Tea In A 5-Room Hotel Suite&#8221; The Zune Froze Solid,
The Song
Stuck In The Position &#8220;Ye&#8221; From The Part Of The Song That The Backup
Singers
Said &#8220;Yes She Was&#8221;. I Reached Over To Investigate The Problem As I Had
NEVER
Had An Issue With The Zune Locking Up (Nor Have I Since), Couldn&#8217;t
Figure Out
What The Issue Was, And Started Holding The Power Button To Reset It. I
Was In
The Process Of Saying &#8220;OMG, Stupid F****ng Microsoft Product&#8221; But The
Sentence
Was Never Completed, As I Was Talking To Both Myself &amp; The
Inanimate
Object,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something Caught My Eye&#8230; It Was
Once Again This Figure! In All It&#8217;s Incredibly Creepy, DARK DARK DARK,
FRIGHTENING Glory. It Once Again Was Looking Right At Me! It Also Had
No Face,
Eyes, Clothes, Or Discernable Features&#8230; Just Like Every-Time Before! I
Am Still
Not Certain To This Day How The Car Came To A Stop In The Parking Lot
Of That
Abandoned Valero On The Corner Of 770 &amp; 90, Or How The Door Became
Unlocked, Or How I Managed To Have My Phone In My Pocket (The Doors
Have To Be
Either Unlocked Manually, Or By Pressing The Unlock Button For The
Power Locks,
And I ALWAYS Placed My Phone In This Small Cubby-Hole To The Left Of
The
Steering Wheel). All I Know Is That I Was Kneeling In The Middle Of 770
To The
Left Of The Car When My Memory Returns To Me. I Frantically Tried To
Find My
Phone, And As Luck Would Have It, I Was Successful. I Called My Friend
Shane,
Spastic, Crying, Hyperventilating&#8230; The WHOLE 9 Yards, I Mean I Had
Officially
Lost It! He Was Attempting To Understand What I Was Saying, With Little
Success, Until He Finally Managed To Calm Me Down Enough That I Could
Speak
Somewhat Normally. I Told Him What I Saw, And That I Knew This Was
Something
BAD, That Something Bad Was Going To Happen (The Last Time I Saw The
Figure, My
Best Friend Alyssa Was Beaten By Her Ex-Husband The Next Day, And Three
Days
Later I Was In A Minor Traffic Accident That Caused $5,000 Damage To My
Aunts
Nissan Sentra, While Driving Home From School). He Calmed Me Down And
Finally
After About 15 Minutes Convinced Me To Get Into The Car, He Said If I
Wasn&#8217;t
Careful I Would Attract The Police (And I Really Didn&#8217;t Want An Officer
Trying
To Call Me Drunk), I Got Into The Car, Turned On The Dome Light, And
While He
Remained On The Phone With Me I Started Driving Again. I Was About 6
Miles From
Where The Incident Took Place When My Phone Started Dropping Calls Left
And
Right, And I Was In A Really Good AT&amp;T Service Area (3-4 Bars At
All Times).
I Tried Rebooting The Phone Via Battery Removal, But No Dice. Shane
Could Call
Me (He Got Through Every 4&#8217;th Or 5&#8217;Th Try), But I Could Not Reach Him,
Or
Anyone Else, PERIOD. Keep In Mind I Constantly Had Edge Service. Once
Shane Got
Ahold Of Me And Kept Me For A Lengthy Amount Of Time I Had Passed The
School On
Hwy 105 &amp; Was Now Into The Saratoga Oil Fields Portion Of Highway
770 (Yes
There are About 4 Hwy 770&#8217;s In My Area) When I Heard An Incredible Loud
&amp;
Pronounced POP; It Seemed To Come From Outside The Car Right Below The
Passenger Door. My Friend Shane Also Herd It&#8230; Now I Had Calmed Down
Considerably Since My Incident 20 inutes Ago, But I Was Soon Back To A
Hysterical, Crying Mess. I Stopped The Car On The Shoulder Of The Road,
Got
Out, And Once Again I Was Kneeling In The Middle Of The Road! Shane
Told Me
That Kneeling There Was Probably A Really Bad Idea, And I Agreed. I Was
Leery
To Get Back Into The Car, So Shane Had Me Pop The Trunk&#8230; Now I Had To
Open The
Driver Door To Push The Trunk Release On The Dash, And Did So As
Quickly As
Possible. Once I Had The Button Pressed, I Closed The Door And Began
Walking
Towards The Trunk&#8230; The Lid Still Hadn&#8217;t Opened, And Apparently Decided
To Do So
Once I Got To The Back Of The Car, Giving Me Yet Another Mini
Heart-Attack! I
Checked The Trunk, Their Was Noting To Be Seen, Shane Then Had Me Look
Under
The Car, While Kneeling Back On The Road &amp; Away From The Car I Did
Look
Under It, And Saw Nothing! He Asked Me If I Was Sure I Hadn&#8217;t Run-Over
Anything
Like A Soda Bottle, Or A Rock&#8230; I Was CERTAIN I Had Not. The Road Was
Completely
Clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At This Point I Was Terrified Of
That Car, And Didn&#8217;t Want To Be In It, But After My Wild Imagination
Reminding
Me Of Horror Stories &amp; Movies I Had Seen Before About Psychos
Murdering People
On The Side Of The Road, Cars Driving Themselves, And The Like, I Was
Petrified
That Car Might Try Running Me Over! So I Got Back In, And Started
Driving Once
Again, That&#8217;s When The Radio Let Out A Belch Of Static, I Of Course
Being
Shaken Up Turned Off The Radio Out Of Fear The Ghost, Or Whatever It
Was Might
Try Speaking To Me Over The Car&#8217;s Head-Unit! I Was Only About 5 Miles
From Home
Now, And My Phone Sill Would Not Cooperate With Me, That&#8217;s When I
Screamed,
Quite Literally SCREAMED Out &#8220;In The Name Of Jesus Christ, Allah,
Horus,
Athena, Or Whoever, Leave Me Alone And Let Me Make A Phone-Call&#8230; It Was
Like
Flipping A Switch! The Phone Immediately Worked! I Called Shane Back,
As He
Really Was The Only Person Awake That I Could Talk To, And He Stated
That When
I Heard The Pop I Either Left The Spirit There, Or <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Picked
It Back Up; I Told Him I Didn&#8217;t Care Either
Way, That I Was Home Now, And Whatever It Was Could Drive The Car To
Hell If It
Wanted To, But It Was Not Under Any Circumstances Allowed In My Home! I
Parked,
And Jumped Out Of The Car, Leaving My Things And All, And Ran From It.
I Was
Still On The Phone With Shane, Still Quite Shaken, When I Noticed That
The
Lights Were Still On In The Car, 1 Minute Later&#8230; I Asked Him If That
Was
Normal, And He Reminded Me That I Had Turned The Switch To The ON
Position, And
Must Have Forgotten To Turn Them Off. I Checked The Car, And Indeed I
Did Leave
Them On&#8230; I Grabbed My Things, Turned Off The Lights, And Ran Into My
House&#8230; The
Whole Time Yelling You Are NOT ALLOWED IN MY HOME! Shane Let Me Go, And
As I
Was Sitting On My Couch, Reflecting On The Events Of The Night I Could
Swear I
Saw The Figure Looking At Me Through My Kitchen Window. I Blew It Off,
And Went
To Bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1 Week Later, My Friend Shane
Lost His Job Of 20 Years &amp; My Cousin&#8217;s Best Friend (We&#8217;ll Call Her
Michelle) Michelle Was Involved In A Wreck That Nearly Ended Her &amp;
Her
Sisters Lives. Last part Guys I Swear!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It Was About 3 Weeks Later, When Me &amp; Shane Went To Bragg Rd
At
About 1:00 AM, We Did The Usual Drive Through &amp; Visited The
Cemetery. But
Once We Left, Instead Of Talking 1293 To 787, We Went Back Down Bragg
Rd&#8230; Near
The Last 2 Miles Between Us And The Highway The Brakes Got Spongy (As
In The
Pedal Went To The Floor With NO Response From The Hydraulics) On The
2000
Lumina&#8230; Near The End Of Bragg Rd The Brakes Came Back Completely! I
Snapped A
Picture Out The Window, Pointing Towards The Rear Of The Vehicle, The
Image
Upon Later Viewing At My House Showed A Rather Mean Looking Figure
Appearing Out
Of Some Kind Of Fog/Vapor! I Will Attach This Image For You&#8217;re Viewing,
And For
You To Judge For Yourself. I Have Not Since Gone Back To Bragg Rd, Not
Have I
Yet To Have Another Encounter With The Entity. But It Leaves Me
Wondering&#8230; What
Is It? What Does It Want? Why Does It Just Look At Me? Why Does It Only
Seem To
Appear Occasionally When I&#8217;m Alone In A Car? Why Me? And Where The Hell
Did It
Come From!? Sorry That The Beginning Of Every Word Id Capitalized, It&#8217;s
A
Strange Obsession I Picked Up A Few Years Ago Out Of Nowhere. Thank You
For
Your Time, In Reading My Story, And Again, I Apologize For It&#8217;s Length!

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">reading
all these stories, made me remember the time
I saw the girl and the boy. I had almost forgotten this incident since
I was
about 6 or 7. when I was little, my family lived in an apartment
building. our
apartment was small but the kitchen was the biggest part. I remember <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">when
you walk in, you could see the big kitchen
window. it was quite big for a small apartment. anyhow I use to sleep
in the
living room with my brother. about four occasions I saw a little girl
holding
the hand of a smaller boy. I always saw them in the exact location. one
night I
was laying down and I remember I stood up to wake up my brother. he
asked me
what was wrong and I remember pointing towards the kitchen window. I
told him
they are right there. when he turned on the lights they would
disappear. they
would be standing still looking at me right below the kitchen window. I
use to
sleep right across that window. I remember they had really old fashion
clothes
like in the beginning of the 1900s the little girl had a long dress and
the boy
had a sailor like hat. my parents and brothers didn't believe me they
said I was
dreaming and saw too much television. that apartment was right in front
of a
large orange grove, if you looked out the window, you saw lines and
lines of
orange trees, they are no, longer there, they built a large hotel and
got rid
of the orange grove. there are times when you just swear you weren't
asleep, I
know I was not dreaming and it wasn't just one time I saw them. perhaps
back in
the day there was a house there or something near the orange grove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">since
I was a little kid, I have had strange
feelings and things that have happened to me while staying at our
vacation
house in Mexico. My father built a house about 27 years ago in a small
town in
Mexico. at the time, the house was the biggest one in the whole block.
It has
two floors <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">and
it is quite big, it is made out of brick and
cement and the floors are marble. several weird incidents have happened
while
staying at the house to me and my mom. One night I remember it (with
chills
still)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was asleep in my room, I had a
two piece pijama with collar. I remember having a really realistic
dream in
which I was being pulled by my collar pijama shirt in a way it was
chocking me.
I tried to scream but couldnt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember
trying to fight back and throwing my night table to the floor with an
arm. I
didn't see who was chocking me, but I felt how my throat was closing. I
immediately woke up sweating, but like I said it was a very realistic
dream
when I stood up to look at myself in the mirror, was neck was red by
the collar
of my shirt. I told my parents about it the next day, but they said it
was just
a dream. after that I couldnt sleep I tried to stay as much as I could
until I
would eventually fall asleep. another incident was another night I
could easily
hear someone flickering the light switch on and off. I definitely knew
I was
not asleep. my parents didn't really paid attention to what I told them
until
one day something happened to my mom. one night all of us had gone
upstairs to
sleep except my mom, she stayed downstairs cleaning the kitchen. as she
finished, she said she turned off the light, and started to walk
upstairs, when
she was halfway up she was stopped. she told us she felt a great weight
on top
of her that didn't let her, move or speak. she said she tried to scream
but
couldn't. when she finally screamed all of us went to see what happened
and she
was in shock crying. my brothers, and I were scared after that, except
my dad,
he doesn't believe in paranormal activity or anything ghostly. this
incident
happened about ten years ago. the last time I visited the house was
three years
ago and the last incident I saw was a hand print. there is a glass door
by the
dining room that leads in the back yard, so you can see outside while
being
inside the kitchen and dining area. that day I was alone with my mom
and I
glanced outside the backyard and saw a small child hand print on the
glass
door. this really freaked me and my mom out, since we didnt have
company with
small children and in our family everyone is an adult. that day my
mother told
my dad to have the house blessed, but my father said not to believe in
that. a
couple of years ago, I asked my dad if there was something previous in
the
house, he said there was another small house made out of adobe. it
belonged to
a old woman with her grandson and that my dad had offered her money for
her to
sell the property to him. she denied every time, until she died. she
actually
died in the house and her relatives sold the property soon after to my
father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I
am writing to you to describe an experience my
child and I had a Safehouse a few years ago. I am Christian and have
raised my
child in the Christian faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my
child was about 4 we ended up hiding in a Safehouse due to a domestic
violence
situation. I will try to be careful about disclosing too much about the
Safehouse since it is a place of refuge for women and their children
who are
trying to escape domestic violence and who are applying for legal
Protective
Orders. While at the Safehouse my child had developed a relationship
with what
I initially thought was an imaginary friend. She called the boy
"Flip" because as she said he moved from place to place very fast. I
had approached the Safehouse Manager to ask that my child receive
counseling
which they offered on site. The Safehouse Manager told me the house was
believed to be haunted and the staff wasn't allowed to talk about it.
Some of
the other Safehouse residents found out about my child's friend
"Flip" and started questioning her about it. One day while cleaning
our assigned bedroom my child started talking to the boy who she said
was
standing at the headboard of the bed which was against the wall. It was
as if
the boy was standing in the area of the mattress, not on it or on top
of it,
nor at the side of it. My child explained she could not see the boy,
but knew
where he was standing when he spoke to her. My child had asked the boy
various
questions like what was he doing there, how old he was, and how did he
die? In response,
the boy told him he lived there and would play tricks on the women in
the house
to frighten them. The boy told her he was thirteen years old and he
didn't
understand what she meant when asked how he died. My child also told me
we
needed to be careful about what we said because "Flip" could get mad.
"Flip" told her that kids would tease him about being fat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I let my child know that "Flip"
could listen to our nightly reading from her Children's Bible as long
as he
behaved. We began praying for the boy asking God to help him in the
Name of
Jesus Christ. My child stopped talking to or about the boy and when
asked what
happened to him my she said, "he went straight up into the sky." <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>I was told that my child had probably become
sensitive to the boy spirit after being traumatized due to the domestic
violence. My child wasn't afraid or surprised by the boy and at the
time just
acted like the experience was an every day occurrence. My child
eventually
forgot about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe God cares
about these child spirits who, for whatever reason, are earthbound and
it is
important to be gentle, as well as patient, with them. Through sincere
and
loving prayer God intervened to take "Flip" straight up to Heaven.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you for your time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
