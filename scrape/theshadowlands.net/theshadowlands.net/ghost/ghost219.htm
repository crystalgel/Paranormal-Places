<P><B>Beach Resort Hotel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Butch1e@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I used to work in a beach resort in the Philippines back in 1989.&nbsp;
Due</B>
<BR><B>to the nature of my job, I was given a room in the hotel where I</B>
<BR><B>actually lived.&nbsp;&nbsp; My assigned room was on the 2nd floor.&nbsp;
One night I</B>
<BR><B>was awakened by strange noises in the room.&nbsp; First, I heard
like a table</B>
<BR><B>tennis ball bouncing all over my room, then followed by a noise
above my</B>
<BR><B>room which seemed like someone was rearranging the furnitures like</B>
<BR><B>dragging the bed.&nbsp; After the dragging bed sound, next would
be what</B>
<BR><B>seemed like a person running around that room above me barefooted.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>checked the time, it was about 3am then I called front desk to inquire</B>
<BR><B>about a possible guest at the 3rd floor directly above my room.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>front desk agent told me that there was nobody checked-in in that
room</B>
<BR><B>nor were there guests on the 3rd floor at that time.&nbsp; I ignored
this at</B>
<BR><B>first, however, every night, at exactly 3a.m., I hear the same strange</B>
<BR><B>sounds all in succession.&nbsp; This experience has affected me
tremendously</B>
<BR><B>to the point that I can no longer keep with my schedule of a 9-5
work,</B>
<BR><B>instead I come to work at 11am or even 1pm because of sleepless,</B>
<BR><B>disturbing nights.</B>
<BR><B>Then the worst of the worst happened...one night I went to my room
late,</B>
<BR><B>feeling exxhausted from work.&nbsp; I left my table lamp on (as
I always did</B>
<BR><B>specially after hearing these strange sounds) and went to sleep.&nbsp;
As</B>
<BR><B>always, at 3am came the usual sounds but that time, as I desperately</B>
<BR><B>wanted to sleep, I sort of showed feelings of annoyance by shouting
and</B>
<BR><B>tried to put on my headphones then tried to go back to sleep.&nbsp;
A few</B>
<BR><B>seconds after this behavior, I heard an extremely loud banging on
the</B>
<BR><B>table lamp (like a steel bar that was stroke on the table).&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>immediately sat up on the bed with my blanket all over my body,
feeling</B>
<BR><B>cold, and again a few seconds as I was sitting on my bed, I heard</B>
<BR><B>laughter of several women that came like an echo behind my head.&nbsp;
Also</B>
<BR><B>at this time, I noticed the lamp light turned dim.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
hair felt like</B>
<BR><B>it was rising!&nbsp; The women's laughter that I have heard resembles
that of</B>
<BR><B>a witch.&nbsp; I froze for a few seconds and tried my best to reach
out for</B>
<BR><B>the phone just beside my bed to call a co-worker at the other room.</B>
<BR><B>When my co-worker finally came, I related the whole story.&nbsp;
He then</B>
<BR><B>suggested that I move to the room of another co-worker for that
night.</B>
<BR><B>When I agreed, he took the phone and tried to make a call to that</B>
<BR><B>co-worker whom I can move in for the night.&nbsp; Then came another
surprise,</B>
<BR><B>while he was holding the phone, he just started to freeze like a</B>
<BR><B>mannequin and tears were rolling down his face.&nbsp; I shook him
trying to</B>
<BR><B>find out what happened, he seemed shocked!&nbsp; I slapped him and
he came to</B>
<BR><B>consciousness.&nbsp; He told me that the phone rang for several
times then it</B>
<BR><B>suddenly stopped ringing without anyone answering the call,&nbsp;
instead he</B>
<BR><B>heard women's voices laughing, just exactly what I have heard myself</B>
<BR><B>earlier.&nbsp; We both rushed out of the room and went to to our
co-worker</B>
<BR><B>that we were trying to call earlier.&nbsp; Our co-worker opened
the door and</B>
<BR><B>told us that she never heard the phone ring at all!</B>
<BR><B>The natives of that town informed me that the area were that beach</B>
<BR><B>resort was built used to be a cemetery and a hospital during the</B>
<BR><B>Japanese period.</B>
<BR><B>Until the day I submitted my resignation upto the time I vacated
my</B>
<BR><B>room, I still heard those sounds!&nbsp; At present, I heard that
beach resort</B>
<BR><B>closed down.</B>

<BR><B>Spooky Tale</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dsmitty214@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>THis is really not a ghost story per say, I have never</B>
<BR><B>seen anything. But it is kind of spooky anyway. I have</B>
<BR><B>a 7 yr old daughter, her name is Kaitie. When she was</B>
<BR><B>4 my grandfather passed away very suddenly from a</B>
<BR><B>heart attack while trimming the bushes. We are all</B>
<BR><B>very close and the next day after all my aunts and</B>
<BR><B>uncles and my grandma had gone to the funeral home to</B>
<BR><B>make the arrangements, we were all sitting out on the</B>
<BR><B>porch talking about my grandfather and stories of his</B>
<BR><B>life, when out the blue Kaitie said "Shh--do you hear</B>
<BR><B>that?" everyone stopped talking and she said that she</B>
<BR><B>heard grandpa's breath. No one really thought anything</B>
<BR><B>more about it, well for weeks after his funeral she</B>
<BR><B>would wake up every morning telling me that her</B>
<BR><B>Crippen grandpa (her nickname for him) would talk to</B>
<BR><B>her in her dreams and tell her to be a good girl and</B>
<BR><B>to to watch over my grandma and to always be happy.</B>
<BR><B>She is now 7 and going to school and every once in a</B>
<BR><B>great while she will start to cry and tell me that she</B>
<BR><B>misses her Crippen grandpa and wishes that he would</B>
<BR><B>talk to her again and she also asks me if she has been</B>
<BR><B>a bad girl and if she has is that the reason that</B>
<BR><B>Crippen grandpa doesn't "talk" to her anymore. I feel</B>
<BR><B>that when children are little they are "free" and</B>
<BR><B>"open" and that spirits use this to speak to them.</B>
<BR><B>When the children get older they aren't as open and</B>
<BR><B>don't "believe" anymore. Is this true?</B><B></B>

<P><B>Thanks for taking the time to read this.</B>

<P><B>The Sick Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: john_aud [john_aud@msn.com]</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>In October of 1999, I took my two young children to Disney Land.&nbsp;
We stayed</B>
<BR><B>in a nice Inn across the street from the main gate.&nbsp; After
a long day of</B>
<BR><B>running like loons through the park, we settled in for the night.&nbsp;
In our</B>
<BR><B>room was two queen sized beds.&nbsp; My older sister and 7 year
old daughter</B>
<BR><B>shared one bed and myself and my 9 year old son shared the other.&nbsp;
Soon we</B>
<BR><B>were all sound alseep.&nbsp; Sometime in the wee hours of the morning
I was</B>
<BR><B>jolted awake by the sound of someone getting sick.&nbsp; Someone
was throwing up</B>
<BR><B>right next to me.&nbsp; Not to get to graphic but it was loud and
nasty!</B>
<BR><B>Instantly I jumped out of bed along with my sister who was awakened.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>flipped on the light, fully expecting to see one of my kids sitting
up with</B>
<BR><B>a mess on the floor. Both children were sleeping like the dead.&nbsp;
My sister</B>
<BR><B>and I spun around in circles looking for the vomit we both clearly
heard hit</B>
<BR><B>the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; We were confused.&nbsp;
We knew what we heard. It was so</B>
<BR><B>clear and loud. I made the comment that we had a sick ghost.&nbsp;
My sister said</B>
<BR><B>it was obviousely someone in the next room.&nbsp; Made sense to
me but I couldn't</B>
<BR><B>get over how close it sounded.&nbsp; Not muffled.&nbsp; The next
day as we left the</B>
<BR><B>room (very early) I noticed that the other room next to ours was
empty.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>asked the clerk at the desk if someone had rented the room lastnight
and she</B>
<BR><B>said no.</B>

<P><B>Good For Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: flowergal@gci.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I found your page and was interested in telling my story. It will
be</B>
<BR><B>good for me to tell it, for I have not as of yet..&nbsp; When I
was 20 years</B>
<BR><B>old I was living in Burian Washington,( just south of Seattle) in
a new</B>
<BR><B>apartment complex.&nbsp; I was very excited to be living in a big
city.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>had grown up in Alaska and had ventured out on my own, to start
my adult</B>
<BR><B>life.&nbsp; The complex was beautiful, had a big swimming pool and
a tanning</B>
<BR><B>salon right on the grounds of the complex.&nbsp; I shared the apartment
with</B>
<BR><B>a new friend who was out of town in Western Washington visiting
her</B>
<BR><B>parents. I will explain the room lay out so you can better understand</B>
<BR><B>what happened to me in our apartment.&nbsp; There was a dining room
formed</B>
<BR><B>out of two walls and the third was a split bar area with an open
counter</B>
<BR><B>connecting to the kitchen.&nbsp; You could sit at the bar and talk
to someone</B>
<BR><B>cooking or doing dishes. Between the bar and the Kitchen was a mounted</B>
<BR><B>phone with a short cord, lending its location to people to sit at
the</B>
<BR><B>bar and use the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the bar on the other side
of the kitchen</B>
<BR><B>was a large window looking out over the main street just out side
the</B>
<BR><B>complex.&nbsp; On the night I was attacked, I was sitting at the
bar, talking</B>
<BR><B>on the phone to a friend back home in Alaska. We were laughing and</B>
<BR><B>having a great visit. I felt fine, I was just talking on the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was night time and as I chatted I began glancing out of the dark
window</B>
<BR><B>( it only reflected my image as it was dark outside and the dining
room</B>
<BR><B>light behind me and&nbsp; the kitchen light in front of me was on--so
it was</B>
<BR><B>light inside. )&nbsp; I would glance now and then at my reflection.</B>
<BR><B>Everything was fine.&nbsp; The last thing I remember was glancing
at the</B>
<BR><B>potted plant on the dining room table right behind me using the</B>
<BR><B>reflection in the window. I was in mid conversation when something,
I</B>
<BR><B>don't to this day know, took hold of my hips and yanked me off the
bar</B>
<BR><B>stool and across the room. I hit the far side of the wall with the</B>
<BR><B>center of my back and slid down to rest on the floor with my butt
on the</B>
<BR><B>floor and my full back against the wall. The phone was ripped out
of my</B>
<BR><B>hand as I was "pulled" and flung back across the kitchen and cracked
the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen window, came back and hit the bar. I began to scream for
help,</B>
<BR><B>convinced that I was being attacked and or raped or what ever by</B>
<BR><B>someone, but know one was there.&nbsp; I just remember screaming,
not knowing</B>
<BR><B>what happened.&nbsp; My friend on the phone was frantic trying to
re-call me,</B>
<BR><B>but as the phone was in parts all over, I was all alone. I stood
up and</B>
<BR><B>started to rationalize what had just happened as I was alone. I
thought</B>
<BR><B>I must have fell of the chair...but I could not have spanned the
9 feet</B>
<BR><B>from the bar to the far dining room wall&nbsp; from a fall...As
I thought and</B>
<BR><B>thought to calm my self, I saw the indent in the apartment wall
where I</B>
<BR><B>hit, it was 5 feet up from the floor...... I did the only thing
I truly</B>
<BR><B>knew to do, I got on my knees and recited the lords prayer, as I
am</B>
<BR><B>doing at this very moment...... I told all evil to flee in the name
of</B>
<BR><B>Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; This I did all night.&nbsp; I moved out to a
new apartment in</B>
<BR><B>Federal Way and had no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm 33 years old now,
I'm a parent</B>
<BR><B>and I own my own business.&nbsp; Im not some nut.&nbsp; Im just
a person who was</B>
<BR><B>hurt, by something I don't understand.&nbsp; That's why I want to
thank you</B>
<BR><B>for having this web page, sure some people out there may be fooling</B>
<BR><B>around.&nbsp; But for those of us who are not, thank you for helping
me to</B>
<BR><B>see Im not alone.</B>
<BR><B>About two years later I returned to Alaska and planted roots,&nbsp;
One day I</B>
<BR><B>got a letter forwarded from my apartment in Burian, (good ol' mail</B>
<BR><B>system--found me at last)...And for the first time, I realized that
the</B>
<BR><B>apartments address was:&nbsp; XXXXX La Paloma, Des Moines Memorial
Drive.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>later found out on the web that there were 3 graveyards circling
the</B>
<BR><B>complex.&nbsp; This is true, look it up if you wish......Any one
out there</B>
<BR><B>living in the La Paloma complex in Burian Wa. ?&nbsp; Take a</B>
<BR><B>hint........MOVE!</B>
<BR><B>I have had the hair stand up on me in places and circumstances,
and I</B>
<BR><B>take this feeling as a warning and move away fast.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Plagued Since Birth</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lgonzales@randstadcommunications.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>my name is Lisa&nbsp; and I have some odd things that have happened
to me</B>
<BR><B>since birth. I do not have just one random story I am plagued with
spirits.</B>
<BR><B>I can't go into cemeteries I can't be left in certain rooms alone.
I do not</B>
<BR><B>know what really to do. Let me tell you about a few more recent
incidents</B>
<BR><B>that occur in my everyday life.</B>
<BR><B>Back in the early 1990's my family and I moved to an townhouse complex
in</B>
<BR><B>Hayward Ca. The first week we were moved in my mother had the townhouse</B>
<BR><B>blessed. Just so you know my mother's family has practiced the art
of</B>
<BR><B>witchcraft for centuries. My grandmother was the town witch doctor
and her</B>
<BR><B>mother before her was the same. Now I know you might think its crazy
but</B>
<BR><B>really its not. The craft my mother's side has practiced for years
is not in</B>
<BR><B>any book its just passed between daughters. At any rate I thought
I was safe</B>
<BR><B>at this new place but things started happening again. First off
when we</B>
<BR><B>first moved in I hated the garage. I would run in and out of it
when ever I</B>
<BR><B>had to get anything. Mind you it was small the only light was a
cord you</B>
<BR><B>pulled from the center of the room and my family used it for storage
which</B>
<BR><B>made it smaller. There were three doors one led to the backyard
one was the</B>
<BR><B>large door that opened to the street and the third was a door leading
to the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen. This kitchen door never stayed open it had hinges on it
that would</B>
<BR><B>make it swing closed by its self. My Process was to throw the door
open run</B>
<BR><B>in and run out before it closed. I was about 12 at the time so I
have my</B>
<BR><B>wits about me enough to know something was not right. I never see
the ghosts</B>
<BR><B>but I hear them all the time or if I don't hear them a mental image
so clear</B>
<BR><B>hits my brain that I know I did not make it up.</B>
<BR><B>Slowly things became worse. I would be home alone from school and
hear</B>
<BR><B>noises up stairs. The noise would be talking and walking around
in the back</B>
<BR><B>bedroom then it would come down the stairs and seemed to stop at
the bottom.</B>
<BR><B>My cat who seems to be able to see them would hiss at air and try
to claw at</B>
<BR><B>something passing then race upstairs. I would simply ignore it having
had</B>
<BR><B>things like this happen all my life. Then one day something terrifying</B>
<BR><B>happened something I wonder if any one out there has had this happen.
I was</B>
<BR><B>about 15 by this time and I was given the back bedroom as my own.
Just to</B>
<BR><B>explain the room had a large window on one wall the door was to
the left and</B>
<BR><B>the closet took up the entire length of the other wall. I had my
bed set so</B>
<BR><B>my feet faced the closet. I slept in a twin bed at the time and
lay on my</B>
<BR><B>side back facing the wall. As I was asleep one night I thought I
woke up but</B>
<BR><B>I realized after a moment I could not move. My blankets felt real
and a</B>
<BR><B>sense of panic overwhelmed me I tried to call for my parents across
the hall</B>
<BR><B>but could not make a solitary noise. Every move I made was a struggle
it</B>
<BR><B>seemed to take hours to move my hand. Something in the back of my
mind told</B>
<BR><B>me to look behind me seeing as I could not move managed to reach
behind me</B>
<BR><B>with a hand as I did so a hand touched mine it was not threatening
it felt</B>
<BR><B>like a child's really soft and not really cold but this alone forced
my body</B>
<BR><B>to move. I literally fell out of bed and looked around turning the
light on.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say this event sparked my in ability to sleep with out
something</B>
<BR><B>running like the TV or radio. The happened to me 6 more times but
in each of</B>
<BR><B>the new times I never turned around or felt behind me I just used
everything</B>
<BR><B>I had to get up and go downstairs to watch TV until it was 8am.</B>
<BR><B>We have moved from there since then and many other things still
happen to</B>
<BR><B>me. This was the most terrifying and if anyone has answers I would
like to</B>
<BR><B>know. I still have it happen but have learned to shake myself out
of it</B>
<BR><B>before it comes on fully.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Cousins Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rvisser@dieburger.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi ! First of all, you have to excuse my English, it's my second
language.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately, nothing VERY weird did happen to me (yet!). I'm going
to tell</B>
<BR><B>you what happened to one of my cousins.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after my cousins father passed away from cancer some weird
things</B>
<BR><B>started to happen. One night my cousin had a dream. She dreamt -
and she</B>
<BR><B>swears to this day it was her father's voice - that he told her
that he was</B>
<BR><B>not buried. She woke up, and thought it was strange, because there
was a</B>
<BR><B>funeral. Anyways, it turned out that their stepmother (they don't
like her),</B>
<BR><B>refused to bury him, because she doesn't want him to be buried next
to his</B>
<BR><B>first wife (who died when they were very young). His ashes was in
their</B>
<BR><B>study for a long time. Anyway, that's how I understood it.</B>
<BR><B>Not a long time after that, she woke up feeling really scared. She
saw a</B>
<BR><B>dark figure in the corner of her room. He had a dark coat on, with
a hat.</B>
<BR><B>She buried her face in the duvet and started to pray. Eventually
she fell</B>
<BR><B>asleep.&nbsp; Maybe it's all got to do with emotional stress?</B>

<BR><B>Stories from Malaysia</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: heartofaries@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am from Malaysia, a country in the region of South East Asia. I
have some</B>
<BR><B>stories to tell and hope you will find them interesting....</B>
<BR><B>In the heart of Kuala Lumpur, capital city of Malaysia, there used
to be a</B>
<BR><B>hospital called the Sentosa Hospital. Being in the middle of a bustling
city</B>
<BR><B>centre, it was one of the most accessible hospitals for&nbsp; city
folks, thus my</B>
<BR><B>grandmother who stayed nearby, was admitted there several times.</B>
<BR><B>There was one time fourteen years ago, my grandmother was admitted
for an</B>
<BR><B>old age illness. During this time, all of us family members would
take turns</B>
<BR><B>to visit her whenever we could. Most regular was her daughter (my
aunt who</B>
<BR><B>was in her 40s) who used to go almost everynight after work. Now,
to access</B>
<BR><B>to the upper patient's wards, all visitors would either use the
stairs or</B>
<BR><B>the general elevators. I always get the creeps when I step into
one of those</B>
<BR><B>elevators. Not just that they were dark and creepy, you get the
feeling that</B>
<BR><B>you're stepping into a morgue because the way the elevator housing
is</B>
<BR><B>designed, it's like shaped to carry a dead person or something.</B>
<BR><B>One night, this aunt of mine who was coming out of the ward after
a visit,</B>
<BR><B>as usual took a ride in one of these elevators. There were a few
people</B>
<BR><B>inside as well. Suddenly, she felt a big jolt inside her body as
if</B>
<BR><B>something just hopped into her. From then on, she would remember
nothing and</B>
<BR><B>the rest of this story would be recalled by other family members
who stayed</B>
<BR><B>with her...</B>
<BR><B>It seems that immediately after the ride in the elevator, she became
a</B>
<BR><B>totally new person. New in a very nasty way..For the next two weeks
or so,</B>
<BR><B>my aunt was speaking in new voices, babbling foreign languages (Tamil)
and</B>
<BR><B>acting like a very naughty kid. She would jump on the dining table
and eat</B>
<BR><B>greedily right there with her bare hands like she has never eaten
before!</B>
<BR><B>She would run around uncontrollably and at the same time speak as
if there</B>
<BR><B>were a few different people inside her. She was totally lost.</B>
<BR><B>Outright, we knew that she was possesd by evil spirits. In Malaysia,
we have</B>
<BR><B>heard about these things and they are not uncommon. Luckily for
us all,</B>
<BR><B>during then a travelling troupe of mediums to some Chinese deities
were</B>
<BR><B>coming to town to celebrate a 'festival of the gods.'During these
annual</B>
<BR><B>festivals, worshippers are invited to share their problems with
the medium</B>
<BR><B>to the deity and are offered divine help.</B>
<BR><B>On the night of the festival, my uncle and another aunt had to practically</B>
<BR><B>drag her there to get rid of the spirits. It was like 'they' knew
what was</B>
<BR><B>coming. In the cleansing process, after some prayers and chants,
my aunt had</B>
<BR><B>to be held down while she was being beaten with a whip made of snake
skin.</B>
<BR><B>It was painful to see her that way, but my uncle said that it took
a while</B>
<BR><B>(and many lashes) before the spirits were forced to leave her body
one by</B>
<BR><B>one. After that she collapsed.</B>
<BR><B>I remember when I went to visit her a few days later, she was still</B>
<BR><B>recovering from the trauma, pale and so weak, so unlike her normal
bubbly</B>
<BR><B>self. We were told by the medium that her body was possessed by
FIVE spirits</B>
<BR><B>of Indian children while on the elevator. We Chinese believe that
in certain</B>
<BR><B>times of our lives, our souls go through the 'low times.' It is
during these</B>
<BR><B>times that we are very vulnerable to the negative and evil forces
around us.</B>
<BR><B>My unlucky aunt was in that phase. Well, the latest update to that
hospital;</B>
<BR><B>it now has been turned into a 3-star hotel. Believe it or not! I
have been</B>
<BR><B>told that it took psychics/mediums of various religions (Malaysia
is a multi</B>
<BR><B>racial country) to cleanse the building before it was habitable.</B>
<BR><B>Talking about haunted places, you would be interested to know that
in</B>
<BR><B>Malaysia, we have a resort city in the hills called Genting Highlands
in the</B>
<BR><B>state of Pahang. It is very popular among locals and tourists as
it is</B>
<BR><B>located several thousand feet above the hills in the lush green
tropical</B>
<BR><B>forests, thus providing a cool retreat from the lowland's heat and
humidity.</B>
<BR><B>And very famous for being, you can say, the most haunted place in
Malaysia.</B>
<BR><B>Despite the busloads of tourists and entertainment and recreational</B>
<BR><B>activities they have, there never seem to be a shortage of ghosts!</B>
<BR><B>Most famous are the 20-over storey Ria Apartments and the Kayangan</B>
<BR><B>apartments. These apartments are available for rent to the public.
Although</B>
<BR><B>priced very affordably, we locals never want to stay there even
for a night</B>
<BR><B>as almost all who have been there complain of hauntings in their
apartment</B>
<BR><B>unit. I can say 80% who stay there come back with a story to tell!</B>
<BR><B>All sorts of the regular hauntings in large doses. It seems that
there is a</B>
<BR><B>Head Ghost in the hills who resides there and is so powerful he
refuses to</B>
<BR><B>leave and this leader also control all the other smaller ghosts
there. You</B>
<BR><B>see, this resort houses the only casino in Malaysia and many people
go there</B>
<BR><B>just to gamble their fortunes. Unfortunately, many have lost their
life</B>
<BR><B>savings to the casino and many too have taken their own lives by
jumping to</B>
<BR><B>their deaths. Their lost spirits are said to be roaming there. It
is a rule</B>
<BR><B>that when you are there, never turn around and answer someone's
call,</B>
<BR><B>especially at night and the voice is calling your name because if
you do,</B>
<BR><B>and your if soul is in the 'low phase' you just might be caught.
A slap in</B>
<BR><B>the face by the unknown is what usually happens and that could land
a</B>
<BR><B>person's soul in great danger.</B>
<BR><B>Even during peak season, you can see that as all the hotels are
fully</B>
<BR><B>booked, these two apartments remain relatively empty. I wouldn't
stay there</B>
<BR><B>even if it's free! Good news for all of you ghost hunters out there.
If you</B>
<BR><B>want to study a haunting, look no further. Satisfaction and results</B>
<BR><B>guaranteed (pun intended.) Just ask the reservation office for the
scariest</B>
<BR><B>apartment(s) available and they will be so glad to help! For those
faint at</B>
<BR><B>heart, the hotels are known to be quite safe and free from hauntings.</B>

<P><B>St. Francis Dam</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SSDaddyDog@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This past year one of my sons Jr. High school classes went on an
after school</B>
<BR><B>field trip.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was on the anniverary of one of USA history's
worst Man Made</B>
<BR><B>disaters, and anyone of the history classes' students were invited
to join in</B>
<BR><B>on going up to St. Francis Dam to recall a minute-by-minute leading
up to the</B>
<BR><B>Dam breaking.&nbsp; So I've always been interested in what really
happened when</B>
<BR><B>the Dam broke.&nbsp; At 10:30 p.m., March 26, 2000, everyone met
in the parking</B>
<BR><B>lot of the school.&nbsp; We all drove our own cars.&nbsp; I know
there are a lot</B>
<BR><B>spirits in the canyon inwhich the Dam was built and I knew I would
see one</B>
<BR><B>that night.</B>
<BR><B>We had to hike in the dark up the side of what was once the St.
Francis Dam.</B>
<BR><B>The Dam was built in 1928, by Mullenland.&nbsp; It held 12.5 Billion
gallons of</B>
<BR><B>water when filled and it had just been filled to the top two months
earlier</B>
<BR><B>before it broke.&nbsp; The day it broke it had been checked out
by Mullenland</B>
<BR><B>himself and another engineer and given the BIG OK nothing wrong
here sign,</B>
<BR><B>even though there was a good size crack in the Dam wall.&nbsp; the
Dam broke at</B>
<BR><B>11:58 p.m., when everyone in the Santa Clarita Valley was sleeping.&nbsp;
Remember</B>
<BR><B>everyone use to go to bed at 8:00 p.m.,&nbsp; No T.Vs to watch to
keep people up</B>
<BR><B>at night.&nbsp; When the Dam broke it was guessed the wall of water
was over 170</B>
<BR><B>feet high.</B>
<BR><B>Back to our Field Trip.&nbsp; So we all made it to top of what was
the Dam and my</B>
<BR><B>son's teacher is giving a minute-to-minute of what was happening
before the</B>
<BR><B>Dam broke.&nbsp; My son was sitting in front of the teacher and
I was sitting</B>
<BR><B>about 25 feet away from them.&nbsp; As the time came closer and
closer i kept</B>
<BR><B>seeing this shadow trying to get up the side of the mountain, the
side</B>
<BR><B>inwhich the water was stored.&nbsp; Just as the teacher said the
Dam has now broke</B>
<BR><B>the shadow tried harder and harder to get to the top, but the rocks
where he</B>
<BR><B>was trying to get his footing on kept slipping away faster and faster
than he</B>
<BR><B>was gone.&nbsp; I didn't say anything to anyone.&nbsp; As we were
driving home I asked</B>
<BR><B>my son what he thought of the field trip.&nbsp; He told me it was
interesting</B>
<BR><B>except for, and I interrupted him and said "Except for that guy
trying to get</B>
<BR><B>up the side of the hill!&nbsp; He said "Yea, you saw him too?"&nbsp;
You bit I did!</B>
<BR><B>Their were about 450 to 475 people killed that night.&nbsp; Only
three people who</B>
<BR><B>lived in that canyon lived.&nbsp; A woman and her baby cause her
husband pushed</B>
<BR><B>her out a window that faced a hill side and a man that does not
know why he</B>
<BR><B>was saved.&nbsp; His house was washed under but came back up with
him on the roof.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The water rushed all the way to the Pacific Ocean&nbsp; killing
all the way.</B>
<BR><B>Edison had workers setup in a camp ground 20 miles away but along
the waters</B>
<BR><B>path, only the men that had their tents zipped up lived.&nbsp; Their
tents floated</B>
<BR><B>to the top of what was still a 50 foot wall of water.&nbsp; If anyone
would like</B>
<BR><B>to see pictures of a before the Dam broke and after the Dam broke
go to:</B>
<BR><B>History of Santa Clarita Valley web site they have plenty of pictures
to show</B>
<BR><B>you.&nbsp; It will also give you an accounting of the Dam breaking.</B>

<P><B>St. Bernard Scare</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: godzilla00@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>this is Charlie and I live in Chicago. I've sent some of my cousin's
experiences to your website before and I keep on coming here. Now, I have
had an experience that I wish to share with you. I was at my Aunt Jackie's
friend's condo babysitting a St. Bernard puppy named Cara. The condo itself
is on Michigan Ave. in the South Loop of Chicago. The condo unit I stayed
in that night faces east towards the lake and Grant Park. My aunt has a
friend in the building named Mike, who owns Cara. I've been babysitting
her time to time ever since last November, but this is the first time anything
weird has ever happened.&nbsp; It happened Saturday night, August 18th
around 10 pm.&nbsp; Cara was in her little room sleeping on the floor.
Her room faces east by the way. I was in the washroom washing my face when
I heard her spring up from the floor and dash out of her room. She was
going all around looking for me and I came out of the bathroom to see her
about to go into another bedroom. She saw me right away and brushed up
against me like she was scared. This isn't like her to be scared because
she's a giant dog. She looked up at me with sad eyes, then she turned to
her room as if to say "Something's in there".&nbsp; Now, I was scared so
I grabbed an umbrella off of the coat rack and slowing walked towards her
room while she followed behind me. I entered and found nothing. Then I
started to think what could have freaked Cara out so much. Could a spirit
have been in her room, or could there have been something from the outside
that came up to her window and got her attention. I decided to take her
out for a late walk and when I was outside, I looked up to her window,
but nothing was there. When we got back to the unit, she did not go to
her room, which she always does when she gets back from her walk.&nbsp;
Instead, she went to her master's empty room, which was very dark, where
she laid on the floor. I decided to go into her room again and she followed
me in. When I got out, so did she. That night I slept on a chair in the
front room where I was able to see the whole room, so that nothing would
come up from behind me. And as for Cara, she slept on the couch for the
whole night, which she never does. Every night, she sleeps on the floor
in her room where it is nice and cool for her. When the sun came up, I
was very relieved and happy because whatever was there that night, was
now gone</B>

<P><B>to tina and Dave - here is my story.</B>
<BR><B>At my school there is a supposed ghost named Mr.fingers because
of the</B>
<BR><B>lengnth of his fingers. They're supposed to be 12 inches long! I
never</B>
<BR><B>believed in him until one night when i was asleep in my dorm ( i
have the</B>
<BR><B>bed nearest the door)i heard a scratching noise. I called to my
friend,</B>
<BR><B>sophie, but she was asleep, so i listened again.It was weird - a
sort of</B>
<BR><B>grating, thudding noise. My first mistake was to open the door where
the</B>
<BR><B>noise came from. This figure walked in,a man, about 30, wearing
a black</B>
<BR><B>cape.I swear i have never been so terrified in my entire life.it
was so</B>
<BR><B>scary!he strode passed me without even looking at me - then I screamed.Very</B>
<BR><B>loudly.lights went on,everyone had woken up. I looked for him -
but he'd</B>
<BR><B>gone. My friends insisted i had imagined it, but i knew i couldn't
have.Even</B>
<BR><B>so, i tried to forget it and went to sleep. but i couldn't because
i knew it</B>
<BR><B>was real.i will never forget it.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My parents bought a house and had it moved to their property. The
house had</B>
<BR><B>been unused for sometime and before that was a home for Catholic
Fathers. It</B>
<BR><B>was a very large house of two and a half stories, almost three.
An upstairs</B>
<BR><B>bedroom always seemed to have a cold spot in one corner. I slept
with my bed</B>
<BR><B>in that corncer until I saw a man standing there looking at me.
It was only a</B>
<BR><B>short vision time and then he faded. I moved my bed. My brother
also saw the</B>
<BR><B>same ghost when he stayed in same room. I moved across the hall.
Sometime</B>
<BR><B>after this I was in the room across the hall when I saw a spirit
orb drift</B>
<BR><B>through the wall from the haunted room through my new room and out
the</B>

<P><B>Hello. Thank you for a great page that allows people</B>
<BR><B>to share their experiences.&nbsp; I would like to share one</B>
<BR><B>of my recent experiences, though I have been</B>
<BR><B>experiencing such things for many years.&nbsp; I love to</B>
<BR><B>travel and whenever I do, I try to find places that</B>
<BR><B>are unusual to investigate while I am en route.&nbsp; A few</B>
<BR><B>months ago I was passing through Tennessee and Georgia</B>
<BR><B>and decided to do a quick drive through the</B>
<BR><B>Chattanooga/Chickamauga Battlefield.&nbsp; What an</B>
<BR><B>experience!&nbsp; The energy that is present in that place</B>
<BR><B>is enough to make the hairs on your arms stand at</B>
<BR><B>attention.&nbsp; When in such places I tend to listen to my</B>
<BR><B>senses and stop whenever I pick up something out of</B>
<BR><B>the ordinary.&nbsp; This particular day was no different</B>
<BR><B>and as I traveled the road through the battlefield, my</B>
<BR><B>senses went into overdrive when I reached an open</B>
<BR><B>field with a small log house sitting on it. If I</B>
<BR><B>remember correctly, it is called the Kelly House.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>need to gather more information about this place and I</B>
<BR><B>will now explain why I say this.&nbsp; I stopped my car, on</B>
<BR><B>the opposite side of the road, and stood staring at</B>
<BR><B>this small dwelling for several minutes.&nbsp; It was mid</B>
<BR><B>afternoon and I felt drawn to this house.&nbsp; I crossed</B>
<BR><B>the road and approached it, a bit nervously I must</B>
<BR><B>admit.&nbsp; I could see a hasp and padlock on the front</B>
<BR><B>door.&nbsp; Still I put my hand against the door and the</B>
<BR><B>anger I felt being emmited from that house almost</B>
<BR><B>knocked me to my knees.&nbsp; The sadness surrounding it</B>
<BR><B>was almost tangible and I could feel tears welling up</B>
<BR><B>in my eyes.&nbsp; But what truly sat me back on my heels</B>
<BR><B>was the sound of crying coming from within that</B>
<BR><B>building.&nbsp; It was a deep mournful, soul wrenching cry.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I walked around the building and there is a door at</B>
<BR><B>the back but it is padlocked as well.&nbsp; All the way</B>
<BR><B>around this building I could hear this wailing from</B>
<BR><B>inside.&nbsp; The sadness was so intense that I had to</B>
<BR><B>leave.&nbsp; One day I will return and find more</B>
<BR><B>information on this particular site.&nbsp; For now, I</B>
<BR><B>wonder why I heard that cry and no one else in the</B>
<BR><B>area heard it.&nbsp; There were at least 3, maybe 4 other</B>
<BR><B>people in the area and none heard it.&nbsp; Well, thanks</B>

<P><B>Something was there</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Greystoan@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>We moved into our home about 3 years ago and it has been very non-eventful</B>
<BR><B>with&nbsp; one exception that happened to me one evening after my
wife had gone to</B>
<BR><B>bed.</B>
<BR><B>We had purchased the home from an elderly woman who we knew to be
widowed</B>
<BR><B>but, to this day, know nothing of the circumstances of her husbands
death.</B>
<BR><B>I won't say I have been a particularly sensitive person to the spirit
world</B>
<BR><B>but, neither am I a skeptic, especially after the event.&nbsp; I
suppose it's just</B>
<BR><B>in my nature to believe that we are spiritual beings living in a
spiritual</B>
<BR><B>realm.&nbsp; Nevertheless, my incident didn't require any personal
rationlization</B>
<BR><B>as it all happened very fast and was all too real.</B>
<BR><B>I was sitting in front of the computer one evening after my wife
had gone to</B>
<BR><B>bed.&nbsp; I had actually been on-line for an hour or so and was
deeply engrossed</B>
<BR><B>in whatever it was I was surfing through on the internet at the
time.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly and totally without even having time to work myself up
to being</B>
<BR><B>scared, there was the sensation of my neck hairs standing straight
up and of</B>
<BR><B>what I can only describe as a feeling of a presence directly behind
me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>distinct feeling I had was that it was a 'large' or very 'tall'
presence that</B>
<BR><B>impressed me as towering over me from behind.&nbsp; It was so sudden
and intense</B>
<BR><B>that I whirled around in my computer chair and was actually somewhat</B>
<BR><B>breathless from the intensity.&nbsp; I had the impression, as silly
as it sounds,</B>
<BR><B>that I should go to bed immediately.&nbsp; Don't make anything out
of that... it</B>
<BR><B>was just the feeling I recall having.&nbsp; After a few minutes
of staring in the</B>
<BR><B>direction of the presence, the feeling diminished.</B>
<BR><B>Immediately after this experience as I sat in my chair, my mind
began to</B>
<BR><B>replay what had just happened and the thing that stuck out then,
as well as</B>
<BR><B>now, was the hair on my neck standing up.&nbsp; I can distinctly
recall that</B>
<BR><B>sensation BEFORE any other.&nbsp; It was as if my body was starting
to react to</B>
<BR><B>the presence before my mind had time to be aware that something
was there</B>
<BR><B>with me.&nbsp; This recollection has stuck with me to this day and,
somehow, helps</B>
<BR><B>me to understand that it was not my imagination.&nbsp; My imagination
had not had</B>
<BR><B>time to start working before my body felt a physical reaction.</B>
<BR><B>There has been no other experiences in this house to my knowlede.&nbsp;
I have</B>
<BR><B>never related the incident to my wife since, as 'spiritually' quiet
as the</B>
<BR><B>house seems to be, I see no reason for giving her any reason to
be</B>
<BR><B>frightened.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Some of My Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: angiebaby4974@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had a few experiences, not really memorable ones though.&nbsp;
I remember having them, but when I try to think about what they were, my
mind just kinda goes blank.&nbsp; I have ahd experinces most of my life.&nbsp;
My mom told me that when I was very young, maybe 3 or 4, I looked up at
her and asked her if she remembered playing with me when she was a little
girl.&nbsp; I have always seen "sparkles" for lack of a better word.&nbsp;
I just see little tiny (like the size of a pinhead) flashes of light dancing
around in front of me.&nbsp; One of my most memorable experinces happened
just 2 or 3 days after my great grandfather passed away.&nbsp; We were
always very close, and the entire week before he died I was at his bedside.&nbsp;
The day that he died, I just couldn't afford to miss another day of work,
so I stayed with him until I had to go to work.&nbsp; I was at work for
about 30 minutes when I got the call that he had died.&nbsp; He was in
so much pain, that the doctors had him on a self dosing morphine drip.&nbsp;
All week long, he was delirios from the medication.&nbsp; He did not remember
who anyone was, &amp; when he did recognize someone, it was like he was
acting out something that had happened years ago.&nbsp; The last words
he said were actually coherent.&nbsp; He asked for me, then took his last
breath.&nbsp; The day after we buried him, I was terribly depressed.&nbsp;
I felt so guilty for praying to God to take him out of his suffering.&nbsp;
That night I went to bed as usual.&nbsp; My husband was already deeply
sleeping, &amp; I could not get to sleep.&nbsp; All I could do was cry.&nbsp;
Then, for some reason I quit crying &amp; looked up.&nbsp; At the foot
of my bed was my grandpa.&nbsp; He told me that he was ok &amp; that I
needed to be strong for Granny.&nbsp; He told me that he loved me &amp;
would always be with me.</B>
<BR><B>The only other time I really remember being contacted was when I
was pregnant with my daughter.&nbsp; I was so afraid that I was going to
have another boy(already have 2) &amp; never experience the joys of raising
a little girl.&nbsp; Being tired all the time, I went to lay down.&nbsp;
My paternal grandmother came to me &amp; told me that everything was going
to be ok &amp; that we would soon have a beautiful baby girl.&nbsp; Two
weeks later, I had my first ultrasoud.&nbsp; It's a girl!!!&nbsp; Not really
a surprise to me.</B>
<BR><B>My grandparents have always been guiding forces in my life, and
I guess that even their passing cannot break that bond.</B>

<BR><B>I would like to Share Mine</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rosedb_2000@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>After reading several of the encounters on your web site, I decided
that I should share something that happened to me. We lived in a little
town called Rohnert Park in CA when I was growing up. My grandfather turned
an extra area off our garage into another bedroom so my parents gave me
the master bedroom as my place. I was about 7 or 8 at the time. One night
I woke up after hearing some kind of sound. (I still don't remember what
it was, just that it woke me up.) I looked down at the foot of my bed and
saw this white shape just floating there. I was terrified but couldn't
make a sound or move. It just hovered there and then started to move away
towards my door. Then it moved back towards me. I was able to move at this
point and pulled the sheets up over my head and prayed that it would go
away. I suddenly felt these hands on my legs, squeezing them and just started
screaming for my father. My mom is the one who came, but she told me that
the lights from the street outside must have made the shape (my curtains
were open) and closed the curtains and told me to go back to sleep. I still
doubt that the streetlights were the cause.</B>
<BR><B>Another encounter happened after my grandmother passed away. I was
12 at the time and Grandma had lived with us at the time she got sick.
One evening, we heard coughing coming from the room that my Grandma stayed
in and then we could hear footsteps coming from the room into the kitchen.
My dad yelled "Ma, go back to bed" and you could hear footsteps going back
to the room. We never heard it again but my uncle told us that the same
thing happened at his place. He could here footsteps coming from the room
that Grandma has stayed in when she lived with him and then down the hall.
He also yelled out "Ma go back to bed" and the steps stopped.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:sbcloud@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,Enjoy your website.Ghosts and Spirits are</B>
<BR><B>fasinating and I got to experience a few times myself.</B>
<BR><B>First time,i saw something I was about 10,maybe 11 yrs</B>
<BR><B>old, we lived in tyler tx and in the back yard was</B>
<BR><B>this old cotton wood and to the side an old garage.</B>
<BR><B>Well one night I had been listening to music and i</B>
<BR><B>looked out of the large window and it was a moon light</B>
<BR><B>night and on the garage wall was shadows..the tree</B>
<BR><B>shadow and something else.. it was a woman dressed</B>
<BR><B>like a southern bell,with the bellhoop dress ,she was</B>
<BR><B>sitting in a swing and beside her,was a gentleman with</B>
<BR><B>one of those long split tail coats.He was pushing</B>
<BR><B>her,not real hard but enough that you could see the</B>
<BR><B>swing move.I looked at the tree and back at the garage</B>
<BR><B>and i guess they stayed there for a good 3 or 4</B>
<BR><B>minutes and when i turned away to turn the stero off,</B>
<BR><B>and look back, they were gone..and all was seen was</B>
<BR><B>the cotton wood's shadow....it didn't scare me,i just</B>
<BR><B>thought how romantic it was.</B>
<BR><B>2nd time i saw something i was 19, my son was just</B>
<BR><B>under 6 months and we were visiting relatives in</B>
<BR><B>huntsville alabama, and my cousin wasn't much older</B>
<BR><B>than I was and her baby was maybe a month older than</B>
<BR><B>my son and we were sitting in her living room, she</B>
<BR><B>lived in the old part of huntsville - near an old</B>
<BR><B>cementry.My son was in a cradle that reminded me of an</B>
<BR><B>old one ,and her son was in his crib in the bedroom</B>
<BR><B>and we had been talking about ghosts and such and she</B>
<BR><B>had told me about the old woman that she's seen</B>
<BR><B>pulling a blanket over her baby on several occassions.</B>
<BR><B>We were sitting there, my son was asleep in the cradle</B>
<BR><B>between us and the cradle started rocking , and my son</B>
<BR><B>was not moving . it was a gentle rocking ,nothing</B>
<BR><B>harsh. I think it was the old woman we spoke of. Well</B>
<BR><B>my cousin went into the kitchen, and the front door</B>
<BR><B>opened and then closed by itself....needless to say i</B>
<BR><B>was scared ..and just sat there..I never saw any</B>
<BR><B>visible "spirits" but actions often spoke more.She</B>
<BR><B>later told me that this kind of thing was a daily</B>
<BR><B>occurance and ever since she kept the bathroom light</B>
<BR><B>on in their bedroom where their baby slept,she didn't</B>
<BR><B>see the woman again but she would make herself known.</B>
<BR><B>I think she was their gardian angel in a way ....now</B>
<BR><B>that i think about it.</B>
<BR><B>Ghosts,spirits to me are one in the same . Some good</B>
<BR><B>some not..but i think its all how its preseved..</B>
<BR><B>Children that die violently perhaps do walk the earth</B>
<BR><B>cause they don't know the way ..kind of hard to</B>
<BR><B>say.but i think there's a lesson tied into them... but</B>
<BR><B>then I'm native american and i look to find the</B>
<BR><B>answers that are often found..in the unknown..</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Seeing the Spirits</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:AliusG@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, my friends and I love ghosts and mystical things. I told my friends
(Ashleigh and Sarah) that my dad heard a story about a headless horse man
at the church in the Hamlet a mile and 1/2 away, so we went. We sat out
side it and thought, Sarah almost had a heart attack when she said she
saw a man with long ginger hair. Ashleigh decided to sneak into the church
yard. So we clambered to the back of the church yard and snuck in. We climbed
over a wall and Sarah saw another apparition, a child by some bare head
stones. But we still went further inwards. I noticed what looked like an
air raid shelter and walked round it until I was lined up with the door
way. I had a torch and looked inside. I looked round corner and jumped
back with fright. I saw the pale white face of a girl about my age (14)
Ashleigh and Sarah ran over to me and attempted to find the ghost. Nothing.
Ashleigh began to feel sickly and had to walk away from the shelter. We
grabbed our bikes and walked over to a bench.</B>
<BR><B>When Ashleigh felt better we went to my house and then I told them
that my brother had found an air raid shelter by the railway line. So we
left our bikes at my house and began to walk to the foot path that lead
to where my brother said the shelter was located.</B>
<BR><B>We eventually found it and went in after arguements who was going
in first.</B>
<BR><B>We were half way to my house when I told them about a garden that
was supposedly haunted ( Gracies Garden other wise known as), Ashleigh
and Sarah were frilled and we were standing at the opening oposite the
gate ( we weren't allowed in, but what the heck) I had been in thousands
of times when I used to live daown the street from the house it belonged
to, but I just couldn't go in. So Ashleigh and Sarah went in alone, I stood
for a while and then I noticed that my breath was misty. you might think
yeah and, but the thing was it was one of the hottest days of the year
( I live in Briton and it was 23 degree's C) I froze,I wanted to shut out
for Ashleigh but I couldn't speak. Ashleigh disappeared around the corner
of a bush. I could see Sarah and I could feel my throat loostening and
was just about to shout out for Sarah when I shouted for Ashleigh. Ashleigh
came running, and Sarah followed. Ashleigh turned to Sarah and asked why
was she shouting for her not to go into the corner. Sarah began to explain,
Sarah saw the out of a women who was screaming and Ashleigh was walking
directly over to it. Ashleigh turned to me and asked why I screamed on
her, I explained and Sarah began to write it down in her book of odd things.</B>

<P><B>The Ghost of Goose Hall</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: techne@nb.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>A friend of mine who had come from Russia was acting as a caretaker
for an older man with a breathing disability who lived alone in a large,
two story building in one of the run-down areas of our city. The building
had once been something like a VFW hall with the first floor being more
like a warehouse area, and the second floor being an empty dance hall complete
with stage and bar. There was also a basement and I believe possibly an
attic. The first floor had been partitioned into rooms by hanging large
sheets where no actual walls existed. It was a dark, cavernous place with
weird props like mannequins and paraphernalia from the WWII era strewn
about. There were twisting stairways and little, hidden passages here and
there. In short, it was a classic, spooky place to begin with but mostly
from neglect. I cannot remember exactly why we called it Goose Hall as
it had another name, but I think it was because there was a banner hung
on the front of the building at one time referring to it as "Goose Hall."
It was a good name for a strange place.</B>
<BR><B>My friend, whom I will call Sergei, had taken the position of caring
for this man, whom I will call Edward, as Sergei had little money and didn't
mind the weirdness of the place as it provided him with room and board.
Not many other people would have wanted this job.</B>
<BR><B>Not long after Sergei had moved in he began to notice odd things
like lights being turned on that had previously been off, and pictures
and clocks falling off walls by themselves even after he repeatedly secured
them. Since Edward was bedridden Sergei knew it wasn't him doing it but
he found it annoying and puzzling. Then one night, around 2am, he heard
footsteps walking around on the second floor overhead. He did nothing about
it at the time but told Edward the next day that he thought intruders,
kids most likely, had broken into the house and were walking around.</B>
<BR><B>"That's the ghost," said Edward, "Don't worry, he won't bother you."
Then Edward went on to explain that the ghost had always been there and
did odd things like move stuff around or turn lights on and off. He further
explained that the footsteps that Sergei had heard were also the ghost's
doing, and that sometimes the ghost also made sounds like boxes and cartons
being pushed over on the second floor even though the second floor was
empty. This usually happened around 2am in the morning. Sergei, being an
intelligent and educated man, believed none of this. He was convinced that
it was teenagers breaking in and hanging out for kicks. He was determined
to trap and confront them. Edward told him he was wasting his time and
not to worry about it.</B>
<BR><B>For my part I had visited Sergei and Edward in this building (which
was about a 30 minute drive from my house), and listened to this story
intently as I had witnessed phenomena before in my life and was hoping
to see something manifest. However in the times I visited, day or night,
nothing ever happened. Sergei however, as he was living there, frequently
witnessed or heard some odd thing which he was still convinced was someone
pulling a prank.</B>
<BR><B>Then one day I went to visit and found Sergei in an agitated state.
He wanted to tell me about what had happened to him a couple of days previously.</B>
<BR><B>"I was staying up late," he began, "quietly listening to some music.
About 2am I heard the footsteps walking overhead and I grabbed a flashlight
and ran to the stairwell determined to catch the kids who were breaking
in (there were no working lights on the second floor). I ran up the steps
and onto the dance floor where I could still hear the footsteps walking
and shone my flashlight in the direction of the sound. I was now directly
illuminating the spot where the footsteps were and I could still hear them,
but there was no one there."</B>
<BR><B>"Then the footsteps suddenly stopped, turned in direction and began
walking straight towards me. I kept the flashlight on the source of the
sound and followed it as it approached me but there was no one in the room
but me. About 5 to 10 feet from me the footsteps suddenly halted while
I continued to shine the light."</B>
<BR><B>"Were you scared," I asked.</B>
<BR><B>"YES!!" he replied. "But I tried to think about it rationally and
decided that I wasn't going to be physically hurt, and that I couldn't
let my emotions overwhelm me, so I decided that the only thing to do was
to turn around and to leave, which I did."</B>
<BR><B>Sergei now said that he was convinced that Edward was right and
that there was a ghost in the place, but that he would just ignore it from
now on like Edward did.</B>
<BR><B>As he was telling me this story a chill went up my spine as I don't
think I could have been quite that brave, especially in an eerie place
like this. But I still wanted to experience the phenomena for myself as
a story is just a story until something happens to you to give you your
own proof. It was several months later that I got my wish.</B>
<BR><B>I was visiting Sergei one summer evening and we talked late into
the night and he was playing some new CD's for me he had recently purchased.
It was about 2am and I was standing next to the stereo quietly listening
to the music when it happened. I would have missed it entirely except that
Sergei got my attention and said, "Listen! There's the ghost!"</B>
<BR><B>I want to give as thorough an explanation of what I experienced
as possible since it seems to me there are some peculiarities as to how
this type of phenomena is perceived. First off, the music that was being
played was not loud as Sergei did not want to disturb Edward who was in
the adjacent room; probably about the level of background music in a department
store. Secondly, I was in no way thinking about the ghost and we hadn't
even discussed it previously that evening.</B>
<BR><B>What I was hearing was the sound of boxes being pushed over and
shoved around on the floor above me. The entire manifestation lasted perhaps
10-15 seconds. What is hard to describe, and perhaps part of the reason
I almost missed this, is that the sound seemed to be coming in some way
from inside my head rather than externally through my ears, and yet Sergei
was hearing exactly the same thing as I was. It was like tuning in to a
different world, much the same way that you can "imagine" a conversation
you have had with someone in recollection and "hear" the words being spoken
inside your head, only in this case it was much more amplified and the
"recollection" was being controlled by someone else. The best way I can
put it is that the sounds were not located in the physical place where
I was standing, but were somehow layered on top of it. There was also kind
of an odd "purity" to the sounds I was hearing, as if they had been recorded
on tape, enhanced, and a little reverb added. But the sense of these sounds
being "inside" me made the possibility that someone was actually doing
that unlikely.</B>
<BR><B>I remember asking Sergei if he wanted to grab a flashlight and go
upstairs and look. He said, "no," but that I was welcome to go myself if
I wanted. I declined.</B>
<BR><B>And that was it. The rather dramatic postscript to this recounting
is that the phenomena continued off and on for the entire time that Sergei
lived there and he basically ignored it and lived with it. Then one evening
he heard a loud "BANG!" in the next room and went over to investigate only
to find that Edward had put a gun in his mouth and blown his brains out
against the wall leaving a note behind apologizing and saying that he just
couldn't take living in his condition anymore.</B>
<BR><B>The police, of course, immediately put Sergei through the ringer
for hours until they were convinced he had nothing to do with it, but they
could see (as he told me later), that he was freaked-out and shaken, and
Edward's daughter, who lived elsewhere and knew that Sergei was taking
care of her father, was contacted and apparently didn't feel that Sergei
had anything to do with it and felt that her father had indeed taken his
own life (plus the fact that he left notes in his own hand for everybody).</B>
<BR><B>Edward's daughter allowed Sergei to stay for a few more months in
the building until he finally moved out. After Edward's death all the manifestations
in the house ceased immediately. I'd like to think that Edward finally
evicted his noisy and pesky tenant once he was finally able to do it so
that Sergei wouldn't have to be haunted in a place that had already given
him enough bad memories.</B>
<BR><B>A final note on the story: I have had a little training in writing
so I have tried to make the re-telling here a bit more dynamic than a simple
narrative. However nothing has been fictionalized except the names, and
the conversations are reported as I recall them from memory. These incidents
are all true and dramatic as they are, this is the way it happened. They
took place in the Millvale section of Pittsburgh, PA in the early 1990's.</B>

<P><B>Another freaky thing that happened at sea view was that i saw ghost
lights.</B>
<BR><B>I clicked on the link on ur web page about ghost lights and they
match the</B>
<BR><B>description 100%.&nbsp; I'm guessing these are bad ghosts since
sea view became</B>

gonna bring a</B>
<BR><B>camera there and take pictures of the stuff i saw last time but
now I'm kinda</B>
<BR><B>scared of a ghost haunting me because i took pictures of its home
lol.&nbsp; I saw</B>
<BR><B>the room where the old mourgue was and the big thing they keep the
dead</B>
<BR><B>bodies in.&nbsp; Then right next to that room there was a desk and
when we opened</B>
<BR><B>the cabinet we found death documents and a bunch of toe tags that
they put on</B>
<BR><B>the dead peoples toes once they are in the mourgue.&nbsp; We also
walked through</B>
<BR><B>some of the trails and i think what i saw was an electrocution chamber.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>opened the door and i saw about 5 levers that looked liked the ones
you push</B>
<BR><B>down when u want somebody electrecuted and some people told me they
saw</B>
<BR><B>electric chairs on the other side of those levers one time because
there is a</B>
<BR><B>wall blocking them.&nbsp; I hope all of this was informative for
your website and</B>
<BR><B>once i find the map i will let u know more details even send you
pictures of</B>

<BR><B>The Brass is Melting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bud1315@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; We moved into our house about 7 years ago, and my</B>
<BR><B>parents would here a baby cry, I would see a little girl appear
and then</B>
<BR><B>vanish.&nbsp; My sister has had some pretty strange and scary experiences,
she</B>
<BR><B>would get swore at by some guy, and would hear the little girl.&nbsp;
The little</B>
<BR><B>girl would tell her stuff that we didn't understand, for example
the little</B>
<BR><B>girl said "The brass is melting" we have no idea what she means
by it.&nbsp; Then</B>
<BR><B>it just stopped after we got done remodeling the house. Then about
4 years</B>
<BR><B>later my sister was friends with this one guy.&nbsp; Then she started
hearing the</B>
<BR><B>guy swear again and tell her to go places.&nbsp; The guy told her
to go to the</B>
<BR><B>cemetary that is up our gravel road. She went with her friend Adam
and I</B>
<BR><B>followed behind them it was about 10:00 p.m. so it was pretty dark.&nbsp;
Then as</B>
<BR><B>we were walking up sarah said that i should go back though she never
told me</B>
<BR><B>why.&nbsp; Then as i was heading back i turned around and i thought
i saw a car.</B>
<BR><B>I think that is what Adam and sarah thought to&nbsp; because they
both went on</B>
<BR><B>opposite sides of the road.&nbsp; Then the lights that we saw spread
out on both</B>
<BR><B>sides of the road as if following my sister and Adam.&nbsp; Then
the lights went</B>
<BR><B>through them and my sister fainted but adam didn't so we carried
her to our</B>
<BR><B>porch and woke her up.&nbsp; We told eachother not to tell anyone
what we saw.</B>
<BR><B>Because they probably wouldn't beleive us anyway.&nbsp; Then once
sarah and Adam</B>
<BR><B>were walking down our stairs when adam fell down the stairs and
got a bloody</B>
<BR><B>nose.&nbsp; He said that it felt like somebody punched him. Now

<P><B>Purple With Rage</B><B></B>

<P><B>The incident that I am about to relate occurred many years ago, around</B>
<BR><B>1969 or so, in the presence of myself, a friend and several other
people</B>
<BR><B>who were on the street at the time.</B>
<BR><B>It was a hot, summer night in New York City, at about 9 PM or so.&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was hot enough out that even the elderly, Ukrainian women who live
on</B>
<BR><B>East 10th Street, were still outside by their stoops on their "lawn</B>
<BR><B>chairs", as it was still too hot to go indoors.</B>
<BR><B>My friend and I were passing by the old, Russian-Turkish bath house
on</B>
<BR><B>our way to my apartment after having had dinner in the Village.</B>
<BR><B>(Communal steam baths were a tradition back in turn-of-the-century</B>
<BR><B>Russia.&nbsp; Some of the old White Russians, who fled Russia after
the 1917</B>
<BR><B>Revolution, settled in the n. end of the Lower East Side and bought
the</B>
<BR><B>tradition of the steam baths with them.)&nbsp; Suddenly, as we were
walking</B>
<BR><B>by the long, high stoop of the bath house, we almost "ran into"
a</B>
<BR><B>screaming, black man at the foot of the stairs.&nbsp; He looked
real in every</B>
<BR><B>detail except for two things -&nbsp; he glowed purple and seemed
to be</B>
<BR><B>composed of pixels - as a television image would be.&nbsp; He was
screaming</B>
<BR><B>and cursing at someone at the top of the bath house stoop and kept</B>
<BR><B>looking back, while screaming, as he ran across the street, towards
the</B>
<BR><B>little group of elderly Ukrainian women, who also let out a scream</B>
<BR><B>themselves.&nbsp; He ran about 15 yards east down the block and
just as</B>
<BR><B>suddenly as he appeared, disappeared into thin air.</B>
<BR><B>My friend and I looked at each other and exclaimed in unison "that
guy</B>
<BR><B>was purple"!&nbsp; The Ukrainian women were laughing and chatting
nervously</B>
<BR><B>at this point and no body could figure where this guy could have
gone.</B>
<BR><B>About a year later, I was in an old Brentano's book store when a
small</B>
<BR><B>volume of prose and photographs caught my eye.&nbsp; The title of
the book</B>
<BR><B>was "Tenth Street", by Bill Binzen, published in 1968 by Grossman</B>
<BR><B>Publishers, Inc.&nbsp; On one of it's pages, the book describes
three old</B>
<BR><B>women, sitting in their chairs one summer evening, on Tenth Street</B>
<BR><B>between First Avenue and Avenue A.&nbsp; It goes on to say,&nbsp;
"one summer</B>
<BR><B>evening, there was a loud altercation directly across the street
in the</B>
<BR><B>doorway of the Russian-Turkish Baths.&nbsp; Suddenly, one man picked
up a</B>
<BR><B>chair and brought it down with tremendous force on the head of another</B>
<BR><B>man.&nbsp; The latter toppled and rolled down a dozen steps to the
foot of</B>
<BR><B>the stoop, where he lay dead on the sidewalk in a great puddle of
blood.</B>
<BR><B>The three old ladies observed all this with aplomb and very little</B>
<BR><B>dismay, and long before the corpse was lugged away, they had returned
to</B>
<BR><B>their evening chat."</B>
<BR><B>I lived on Tenth Street for many years after 1969 but never again
did I</B>
<BR><B>encounter this man, "purple with rage" on this street again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Entertaining!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kittykatt132@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Things happened when I was 6,7,8, and 9. I lived on an airbase, which
you</B>
<BR><B>would never think anything of a phenomonon would happen. It would
seem that</B>
<BR><B>each year, something would happen. I know that it was interaction
with the</B>
<BR><B>same ghost each year. I've never known the ghost, and I don't have
a</B>
<BR><B>connection of ansectors with it. Anyway, lets get to what happened.</B>
<BR><B>When I was six years old, my mom was in the kitchen, And I think
she was</B>
<BR><B>cooking. Well, about a minute after she left, something started
to pull on</B>
<BR><B>the doll I had in my arms. It was a doll that resembled an angel.
It was</B>
<BR><B>wierd, but I know that the ghost was friendly. I didn't see it then,
and now</B>
<BR><B>I think that my so called "psycic" abylity didn't kick in at that
age. It</B>
<BR><B>really scared me, and it tugged hard. I kept trying to pull the
doll back,</B>
<BR><B>but it wouldn't budge.Suddenly, the force let go, and I fell on
my butt, and</B>
<BR><B>got up and told my mom that my bottom hurt, cuz i fell on it. I
told her that</B>
<BR><B>something was trying to steal my doll, and she told me it was my</B>
<BR><B>imagination.</B>
<BR><B>(she didnt believe me)</B>
<BR><B>When I was 7, something really, really strange happened. It was
probably</B>
<BR><B>around midnight. I didn't usually wake up at that time of the night,
but</B>
<BR><B>something felt like it was TRYING to wake me up. I stood up in bed,</B>
<BR><B>thinking nothing would be there, but when I looked in the hallway,
a white figure</B>
<BR><B>was running through the hallway. I rubbed my eyes, and looked. It
was still</B>
<BR><B>running. I know it was there. So, I went to go take a peek to see
what it</B>
<BR><B>was. I went into the hallway, but it dissapeared into the left side
of the</B>
<BR><B>hallway. I didn't tell anyone that expierience (atleast none of
my family).</B>
<BR><B>When I was 8 1/2, another wierd thing happened. I was reading a
book.It</B>
<BR><B>wasn't a scary book, but it was one of those stupid books i had
to read for</B>
<BR><B>school, and write what it was about on a piece of paper.&nbsp; Well,
while I was</B>
<BR><B>reading it, I caught something on the side of my eye. I was in a
chair, and</B>
<BR><B>I turned around. What I saw scared me to death. It was the same
ghost I saw</B>
<BR><B>in the hallway when I was 7. It was a few feet from my face, and
it was</B>
<BR><B>hanging from the roof by a rope. It smiled at me, but I ran inside
screaming. My</B>
<BR><B>mom asked what was wrong, and if I got hurt,and I said no, and told
her that</B>
<BR><B>something was hanging from our roof by a rope. (she didn't believe
me about</B>
<BR><B>that either.....) I didn't go outside that day again.</B>
<BR><B>When I was 9, the most thing that was strange to me, was the dream.
That</B>
<BR><B>year, I had forgot about the ghost, and everything that happened.
I went to</B>
<BR><B>bed totaly relaxed. After I went to sleep, I had a dream. I was
on the side</B>
<BR><B>of my house, and the ghost came to me in its body. I wasn't scared,
and it</B>
<BR><B>told me that it was trying to contact me. I didn't say anything.
I noticed</B>
<BR><B>it was a white male, around the age of twelve. He had Brown clothes
on, but I</B>
<BR><B>dont know the matirial. He had blonde hair that</B>
<BR><B>was about shoulder length. Anyway, It told me it's name, but I don't
really</B>
<BR><B>remember, because it wasn't a name like&nbsp; "mike" or "gregory",
but it was a</B>
<BR><B>long name, that was very unusual. He told me that he has been trying
to</B>
<BR><B>protect me from something. I didn't know what he meant, but he kept
on</B>
<BR><B>talking. I don't remember what he said after that, but after that,
I woke</B>
<BR><B>up from the morning light. I didn't have any other experiences after
that (im</B>
<BR><B>11 1/2 now) and i have been trying to contact him, but it doesnt
seem to work.</B>
<BR><B>Maybe he already said what he had to. I'm glad something was watching&nbsp;
over</B>
<BR><B>me. I don't know if it was my gaurdien angel, or just a ghost trying
to</B>
<BR><B>protect me from a bad ghost that would haunt me in my dreams, and
in real</B>
<BR><B>life. All i know, is that it was an amazing expirience, and I dont
think it</B>
<BR><B>will ever be explained. (none have my family has believed me, but
some of</B>
<BR><B>my friends have believed it) Anyway, I hope this was entertaining,
just like</B>
<BR><B>it was to me when it happened. (this is a true story!)</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: softballplaya2010@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was around seven ,or eight, I lived in
a</B>
<BR><B>different house then I do now.My old house was around</B>
<BR><B>the color of a barn and had two stories.We had put</B>
<BR><B>this addition on after my younger brother was born,of</B>
<BR><B>course for lack of room.My room,as well as my</B>
<BR><B>brother's, were both upstairs toward the back end of</B>
<BR><B>the house and right above the bathroom.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never liked my room because it was right
next</B>
<BR><B>to the attic.Most nights I lay awake terrified because</B>
<BR><B>I heard footsteps and the rattling of chairs.After</B>
<BR><B>years of complaining to my parents they finally</B>
<BR><B>checked the attic and when they did,were stunned to</B>
<BR><B>find that several chairs lay in pieces in the corner</B>
<BR><B>of the attic.There was no way this could have</B>
<BR><B>happened.The window was never open and squirls have no</B>
<BR><B>where near enough power to lift and throw a chair.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said my room was upstairs and my bathroom</B>
<BR><B>was down stairs.Almost every night I would wake up and</B>
<BR><B>proceed down the stairs to the bathroom.I never really</B>
<BR><B>understood why but I would fall down the stairs every</B>
<BR><B>night.One night ,though, when I was awake enough to</B>
<BR><B>know what was happening,I stood at the top of the</B>
<BR><B>stairs and as Removed my foot to start descending ,I</B>
<BR><B>felt a powerful pair of hands push my back and I</B>
<BR><B>slipped and fell until I landed in a crumpled mass on</B>
<BR><B>the floor.It scred me beyond anything.</B>

<P><B>PARANORMAL TALE</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: RosieEAllen@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have twin brothers called Chris and Gareth. They have bunk beds
and chris</B>
<BR><B>sleeps on the top.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On some nights chris will suddenly wake up for
no reason and while he's</B>
<BR><B>awake he says he sees a body emerge from the ceiling. The body which
he can't</B>
<BR><B>see the whole of will float down and lie on top of him. He cant
make out</B>
<BR><B>facial features or any other features to the body it's like a slightly</B>
<BR><B>shining image, but he definitely can see. it. Then the image will
whisper to</B>
<BR><B>him but he can't hear it like if i spoke to him its like the floater
( that's</B>
<BR><B>what we call him ) is in him passing the message mentally like he
already</B>
<BR><B>knows this information. he cant work out what the floater says but
he can</B>
<BR><B>hear something.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time this happened chris was physically
sick, the bed starts</B>
<BR><B>to rock slightly and gets fiercer and fiercer. This wakes his brother
and</B>
<BR><B>Gareth wakes because of the moving bed, Gareth jumps out of bed
quite scared</B>
<BR><B>he stands back and sees chris lying there as stiff as a board staring
up at</B>
<BR><B>the ceiling. Gareth runs down stairs to drink some water, when he
comes back</B>
<BR><B>up Chris is asleep as if nothing had happened so Gareth does the
same.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day Gareth tells me what happened when
i come round to visit, I</B>
<BR><B>asked Chris and he doesn't remember much except the body the whisperings
and</B>
<BR><B>how he felt paralysed. Later when Gareth told Chris about he shaking
Chris</B>
<BR><B>did not believe him i think it was because he was scared and didn't
want it</B>
<BR><B>to be true. We tell our mother about this but she says it was just
a dream</B>
<BR><B>and doesn't seem worried.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After so many times this has happened i started
to get worried about my</B>
<BR><B>brothers, it hasn't affected neither of them seriously but it still
plays on</B>
<BR><B>my mind as i have done research and found out some information i
wish i never</B>
<BR><B>looked up!</B>

<P><B>Papa Resides Here</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: papa_roach_112@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Here's yet another story of a beloved deceased Papa. My Papa was
always sick and he hated it. But to cheer him up I would go under the reclining
part of his chair and sit and watch T.V when he would walk into the living
room and see my little feet he always said "WHO'S UNDER MY CHAIR?" and
I would always reply "Papa Grouch Papa Grouch" anyways, My papa died in
1990 and was only 58 years of age. My parents refused to let me go to the
funeral so I stayed with my other grand-parents. Ever since his passing
there has always been a feeling and I know it's him.My papa lives at his
old house (well still is) (I shall also mention that he was bron in that
house) If your alone you can hear his footsteps going through all three
bedrooms. As if he was checking to see if everything was still there. I've
heard the footsteps plenty of times. I and my grandma can hear his voice
calling out to her. and then I say grandma papa's calling you. She just
smiles and says I know. Well that's my story believe if you want to.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Our Residnet Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SClark@concordnet.org</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I have lived in my house almoste all my life, and for the first
16</B>
<BR><B>years or so I have belived there to have been a ghost in the house.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>bealive this ghost to have been the man who built my house because
I know no</B>
<BR><B>one has died in it, and my family are the second ocupants of the
house,</B>
<BR><B>including him and his family.&nbsp; Well I will tell you my experiences
starting</B>
<BR><B>from the beginning, and you can decide for yourself.</B>
<BR><B>My first experience was the moste terrifying.&nbsp; I was only about
5 years old</B>
<BR><B>and my sister and I shared a bedroom.&nbsp; We had bunk beds and
I was on the top</B>
<BR><B>bunk (I am the older one).&nbsp; Well it was late at night (I am
not sure of the</B>
<BR><B>time) and I awoke from sleep.&nbsp; My sister was still out like
a light.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>looked tward the doorway to my room and noticed that my bedroom
door was</B>
<BR><B>open, and it was never open.&nbsp; I always had my mom close it
when she tucked</B>
<BR><B>us in.&nbsp; Then a tall grey figure started to move into the doorway
from the</B>
<BR><B>hall.&nbsp; At first I thought it was my dad, because it was so
tall, but then I</B>
<BR><B>noticed it had no face and was all blurry.&nbsp; I can just remember
being</B>
<BR><B>compleetly paralized with fear.&nbsp; It started to turn and look
at me, thats</B>
<BR><B>when I through the blanket over my head and laid there compleetly
still and</B>
<BR><B>terrified untill I was able to fall back to sleep.&nbsp; I can still
remember</B>
<BR><B>telling my mom about it the next morning, and how mad she got at
me for</B>
<BR><B>making up a story like that........but if I can still remember it
15 years</B>
<BR><B>latter, it must have been more than an active imagination.</B>
<BR><B>I can remember other things occuring when I got older.&nbsp; Hearing
foot steps</B>
<BR><B>from upstairs while you where in the living room (and my room was
the room</B>
<BR><B>directly above the living room).&nbsp; Occationally hearing cabnet
doors opening</B>
<BR><B>and pots being being thrown on the kitchen floor.&nbsp; But when
you go in there</B>
<BR><B>there would be nothing there.&nbsp; My sister and I would see a
grey shadowy</B>
<BR><B>figure&nbsp; to the right out of the corner of our eyes while we
where sitting on</B>
<BR><B>the couch watching tv.&nbsp; But sure enough we would turn and look
and there</B>
<BR><B>would be nothing there.&nbsp; And if you where in the house alone
you would get</B>
<BR><B>the feeling you where being watched....especially in the down stairs
hallway</B>
<BR><B>which lead into the living room.</B>
<BR><B>I can remember being about 10 or 11 and doing home work with my
sister in</B>
<BR><B>the living room.&nbsp; I got up to turn on the thurmostat which
was on the right</B>
<BR><B>next to the couch (where my sister and I would see the figure out
of the</B>
<BR><B>corner of our eyes).&nbsp; And as I reached for it I herd a man
laughing in our</B>
<BR><B>kitchen.&nbsp; Once again I was paralized with fear.&nbsp; My sister
didn't hear a</B>
<BR><B>thing but knew something was wrong.&nbsp; She asked me why I wasn't
moving, and I</B>
<BR><B>told her to just be quiet and I thought there might be someone in
the house.</B>
<BR><B>She got up and went into the kitchen and said that there was no
one there.</B>
<BR><B>I just droped to the floor and started to cry.</B>
<BR><B>The last incident that I can remember happend about 4 years ago.&nbsp;
This time</B>
<BR><B>the whole family experienced this.&nbsp; We where watching tv in
the living room</B>
<BR><B>when one of my moms antique china tea saucers jumped off of it's
stand, off</B>
<BR><B>the shelf, and fell 4 feet to the floor.&nbsp; It then rolled around
on it's edge</B>
<BR><B>in a circle untill it finally came to a rest.&nbsp; We where all
in shock.</B>
<BR><B>Surley this fragile item would have broken, but there wasn't even
a chip or</B>
<BR><B>crack in it.&nbsp; My dad being the sceptic he is said the ratteling
from the air</B>
<BR><B>conditioner did it.&nbsp; Then my parents proceeded to fight about
how it should</B>
<BR><B>be placed on the stand so it wouldn't happen again.&nbsp; And in
the middle of it</B>
<BR><B>my dad droped the plate and it shatterd on the floor.&nbsp; At that
point I was</B>
<BR><B>freeked out so I decided to go to my room.&nbsp; As I went up the
stairs to my</B>
<BR><B>room the air got hotter and hotter (it was mid July).&nbsp; But
when I went into</B>
<BR><B>my room it was ice cold in there, and all the windows where closed
(I had</B>
<BR><B>left them open cause it was so bloody hot that day).&nbsp; Needless
to say I</B>
<BR><B>slept in the living room that night.</B>
<BR><B>Over the years I feal the ghost has deminnished.&nbsp; In fact I
don't even think</B>
<BR><B>he is there any more.&nbsp; I am pretty sure it has to do with the
fact that we</B>
<BR><B>got an addition put on the house, but I can't be to sure.&nbsp;
But I can't be to</B>
<BR><B>sure.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Late Night Meeting in The Wharton Forest</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: TaylorUSMC@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was camping at Geoffreys Bridge in the Wharton Forest, last July
4th</B>
<BR><B>with&nbsp; my Daughter, Son-in-law and grandson.&nbsp; We got there
on friday</B>
<BR><B>afternoon to get a nice spot by the Wading River and we were right
on</B>
<BR><B>the riverbank;&nbsp; there were no other campers anywhere close
by.</B>
<BR><B>Around 9 PM, a thunderstorm was starting to roll in and we secured</B>
<BR><B>things before the rain came.&nbsp; My grandson, Ryan and I bedded
down in the</B>
<BR><B>back of my Suburban and his parents retired to their tent.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunetly, I had to pee, really bad and since the outhouse was
quite</B>
<BR><B>a distance away,and there was no one around, I thought that I'd
just go</B>
<BR><B>a reasonable distance away (we were in the woods!)&nbsp; It was
pitch dark</B>
<BR><B>but the lightning was flashing pretty regularly and I'd scoot about
ten</B>
<BR><B>paces with each flash, until I fugured I was far enough.</B>
<BR><B>As I was in the process of releivin myself, the lightning flashed
again</B>
<BR><B>and to my great embarrassment, A women was walking across my front,
not</B>
<BR><B>12 feet away.&nbsp; Even though it was only an instant, I got a
strong image</B>
<BR><B>of this slender woman, dressed in a long dress with long sleeves
and</B>
<BR><B>some sort of bonnet or bandana. with her hair in a bun r plled back&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>was moving fast in the direction of the river!</B>
<BR><B>Then it was dark and being embarassed, I turned back towards the
lights</B>
<BR><B>of the truck and as I moved back , I started thinking, Where did
she</B>
<BR><B>come from?&nbsp; There was literally no one even remotely close.&nbsp;
Where was</B>
<BR><B>she going?&nbsp; In about 10 seconds, she'd be knee deep in the
river and How</B>
<BR><B>the hell was she moving so fast in the dark woods??&nbsp; By the
time that I</B>
<BR><B>got to the truck, I had decided that what I had seen was not of
this</B>
<BR><B>world.&nbsp; I locked my doors and fully expected to see a pale
face at the</B>
<BR><B>window with each flash.</B>
<BR><B>I should mention that I am a retired US Marine. Vietnam Veteran
and</B>
<BR><B>Drill Instructor.&nbsp; I am not quick to jump to rash conclusions</B>
<BR><B>I thought I'd share. Thanks</B><B></B>

<BR><B>One House, Two Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:jeffwalkerusa@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>The house was built around 1920 and I had no clue what I was about
to</B>
<BR><B>get myself into. From the day I set foot in my room, I felt utterly</B>
<BR><B>depressed.&nbsp; Maybe it was the heat. Maybe it was the fact that
nobody had</B>
<BR><B>slept or lived in that room before me, so it did not feel very welcoming</B>
<BR><B>or maybe it was my ghost. (there were two rooms to the upstairs,
mine</B>
<BR><B>and my best friend's, Keri).</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, the first three nights, while trying to fall asleep, I would</B>
<BR><B>feel as if someone was staring at me from one particular corner
of the</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; Of course, I kept looking over there, expecting to see</B>
<BR><B>SOMETHING...anything, but there was nothing.&nbsp; I questioned
my boyfriend</B>
<BR><B>if he felt someone staring at him and he said he did, but maybe
it was</B>
<BR><B>from outside.&nbsp; I knew it wasn't.&nbsp; This happened every
night.&nbsp; On the</B>
<BR><B>fourth day the house held their first meeting finaly disclosing
to the</B>
<BR><B>newcomers they thought the house was haunted.&nbsp; Believe it or
not, I was</B>
<BR><B>very relieved to hear this.&nbsp; Afterall, I thought I was losing
my mind.</B>
<BR><B>For the next three months I refused to sleep in my room.&nbsp; I
would sleep</B>
<BR><B>in Keri's room.&nbsp; She had a twin bed we both squeezed onto.&nbsp;
There was no</B>
<BR><B>A/C, it was North Carolina, but I still needed the "protection"
of a</B>
<BR><B>blanket.&nbsp; One night Keri moved which sort of woke me up.&nbsp;
Then I felt</B>
<BR><B>someone playing with my second toe (the one next to the big toe)!</B>
<BR><B>Someone was flicking my toe!&nbsp; I quickly grabbed the blanket
I</B>
<BR><B>unintentionaly kicked off and sweated out the rest of the night.</B>
<BR><B>My mom, who was capable of being a medium, like her mother, told
me to</B>
<BR><B>sleep in my bed, that she was harmless.&nbsp; She said the girl
stayed in the</B>
<BR><B>attic space (between Keri's and my bedroom) and the reason I felt
so</B>
<BR><B>depressed was because she was, but that she was not malicious.&nbsp;
Well,</B>
<BR><B>that was all well and good, but we had a man too.&nbsp; One night
while</B>
<BR><B>trying to sleep in my room (with all lights on and the TV going)
after</B>
<BR><B>three months, I sat on the edge of my bed, gathering my courage
to turn</B>
<BR><B>everything off and go to bed.&nbsp; All of the sudden, footsteps
plain as day</B>
<BR><B>walked across my room.&nbsp; I knew it was the male only trying
to freak me</B>
<BR><B>out, but I left and went into Keri's room anyway.</B>
<BR><B>Keri had the sighting of the girl, not me.&nbsp; Keri was in her
room getting</B>
<BR><B>ready for class.&nbsp; Everyone in the house was already gone.&nbsp;
She heard</B>
<BR><B>someone coming up the stairs, of course she thought it was me.&nbsp;
When she</B>
<BR><B>turned the corner to see expecting to see me, she saw a female standing</B>
<BR><B>in front of my door instead.&nbsp; Then she vanished.</B>
<BR><B>We had many experiences in that house.&nbsp; People walking around,
doors</B>
<BR><B>slamming, shadows moving.&nbsp; One of my good male friends saw
the man</B>
<BR><B>ghost.&nbsp; He was the only one who did. The male was a kidder.&nbsp;
He liked to</B>
<BR><B>tap you on the shoulder, walk across the rooms and down the hallways,
I</B>
<BR><B>even heard him talking to someone one day.&nbsp; I was up in my
room and he</B>
<BR><B>was downstairs.&nbsp; Noone else was home at the time.&nbsp; I eventually
just</B>
<BR><B>told him to go away and leave me alone and he did.</B>
<BR><B>One day my other roommate and I decided to research the house's
history.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; We came home and told the other roommates.&nbsp; That night
Keri had stayed</B>
<BR><B>at her boyfriend's house so I was the only upstairs (sleeping</B>
<BR><B>comfortably in my own bed by then, thank you ).&nbsp; I tried to
fall asleep,</B>
<BR><B>but heard knocking on the wall.&nbsp; I sat up thinking it was the
cats, the</B>
<BR><B>banging stopped.&nbsp; I layed back down, it continued.&nbsp; I
then heard a door</B>
<BR><B>slam. I got up to get the cats (who only stayed upstairs) and bring
them</B>
<BR><B>into my room.&nbsp; I searched the whole upstairs, calling out to
them, but</B>
<BR><B>they were nowhere.&nbsp; I decided to look downstairs...nowhere.&nbsp;
I had one</B>
<BR><B>roommate who was very allergic to cats, that is why we kept them</B>
<BR><B>upstairs.&nbsp; We kept her door closed just in case they got out.&nbsp;
For some</B>
<BR><B>reason, I decided to look in there for them and there they were.</B>
<BR><B>Somehow, the ghost opened the door and shut them in there.&nbsp;
I have no</B>
<BR><B>idea how!&nbsp; I brought them up to my room, shut them in there
and the</B>
<BR><B>knocking stopped.</B>
<BR><B>I have many stories while living there, one of which is too freaky
and I</B>
<BR><B>not many people I tell believe it.&nbsp; Keri's sister came to visit.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>decided we would perform this sort of cleansing to make the girl
ghost</B>
<BR><B>happy.&nbsp; We walked to the attic door.&nbsp; I placed my hand
on the door just</B>
<BR><B>to point out where we think the girl hides out and this energy just
shot</B>
<BR><B>up my arm and made me just sob.&nbsp; At first it was like I couldn't
take my</B>
<BR><B>hand off.&nbsp; All I could say was "she is so sad".&nbsp; Finally
I got my hand</B>
<BR><B>off and stopped crying at once. We gathered some candles and things
from</B>
<BR><B>family members which help sentinmental value to us and placed them
in</B>
<BR><B>from of the attic door.&nbsp; Then we sat down, with me in the middle,
held</B>
<BR><B>hands and closed our eyes.&nbsp; We concentrated on emitting love
and peace.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I opened my eyes at one point to see the flames of the candles</B>
<BR><B>reaching so high up.&nbsp; Once we completed the cleansing, the
flames were</B>
<BR><B>back to normal.&nbsp; During this cleansing, Keri said in her mind
she saw a</B>
<BR><B>girl, lying on a bed just crying, but we have no idea why.&nbsp;
Well, we</B>
<BR><B>tried to make her happy and I didn't feel as depressed after that,
but</B>
<BR><B>she became a little more active. I think we made a mistake and I
will</B>
<BR><B>never presume to do that again. I will call in the professionals
if I am</B>
<BR><B>ever in that situation!</B>
<BR><B>So, that is my story.&nbsp; Well, just a couple of them.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>"Not" normal</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DoUKnow298@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I have two different stories that happened to
me that were "not"</B>
<BR><B>normal and something my wife witnessed while i was asleep.&nbsp;
The first was</B>
<BR><B>back in 1992 when I was 16 years old.&nbsp; I had recently met this
girl that was</B>
<BR><B>very religious and wanted me to come to a service at her church.&nbsp;
I had a</B>
<BR><B>crush on this girl so I told her I would go.&nbsp; Well a couple
of nights before</B>
<BR><B>I went I was having this horrible dream.&nbsp; I was in a place
that looked like a</B>
<BR><B>junkyard, being chased by some sort of animal that was all black.&nbsp;
Whatever</B>
<BR><B>it was I was definetly scared of it.&nbsp; I kept running until
I saw something</B>
<BR><B>that looked like a little room with a light in it.&nbsp; But it
was extremely</B>
<BR><B>small, so small I had to crawl through it.&nbsp; By the time I got
in the creature</B>
<BR><B>was right at the opening, but to big to get in.&nbsp; It's paws
were black and</B>
<BR><B>huge.&nbsp; It would growl and snarl trying it's best to get me.&nbsp;
Now here's the</B>
<BR><B>weird part, at that same time as I'm having this nightmare I'm looking
at my</B>
<BR><B>ceiling.&nbsp; I'm all stiff and can't move.&nbsp; I've never experienced
this before.</B>
<BR><B>I'm trying to call my mother but I'm struggling to talk.&nbsp; It's
like I can't</B>
<BR><B>speak at all.&nbsp; While this is happening the nightmare that I'm
having is still</B>
<BR><B>going on in my head.&nbsp; Finally it's over and I'm fully awake.&nbsp;
To be awake and</B>
<BR><B>dreaming was something that I will never forget as it still sends
chills all</B>
<BR><B>through me.&nbsp; Few months later all my friends are talking about
shadows in</B>
<BR><B>rooms and other strange stories so of course I told them what happened
in my</B>
<BR><B>dream.&nbsp; They kind of looked spooked and said the devil was
trying to stop you</B>
<BR><B>so you wouldn't become a christian.&nbsp; Right now I am not a christian.&nbsp;
But I</B>
<BR><B>never had that experience happen again.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next story happens a few years after
that experience. One night me</B>
<BR><B>and my cousins are hanging and end up stopping at a convience store.&nbsp;
We all</B>
<BR><B>end up going in.&nbsp; Well when we come out the car is still running
and the</B>
<BR><B>doors are locked.&nbsp; Of course my bright cousin does not have
a spare key.</B>
<BR><B>Lucky he only lives close by this store.&nbsp; So since i'm skinny
and small I'm</B>
<BR><B>the fastest.&nbsp; I volunteer to go to his house and get the spare
key.&nbsp; So I'm</B>
<BR><B>off and make it there in 10 minutes.&nbsp; Takes me awhile to explain
to my aunt</B>
<BR><B>on what's going on.&nbsp; She helps me find the key and I'm off.&nbsp;
Well now I'm</B>
<BR><B>getting tired of running and I start to jog.&nbsp; Then all of a
sudden, at the</B>
<BR><B>corner of my eye, a dark figure is running at me from across the
street.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>jump back in a surpise to see what's coming at me.&nbsp; Nothing's
there.&nbsp; I could</B>
<BR><B>swear something was coming at me but it suddenly disappeared.&nbsp;
It could not</B>
<BR><B>have been my imagination but it seemed too real to be imaginary.&nbsp;
After I</B>
<BR><B>realized that nothing was there I ran as fast as I could back to
the store.</B>
<BR><B>After I tell them what happened they all laughed at me.&nbsp; So
I shooked it off</B>
<BR><B>and laughed about it too.&nbsp; But I feel that's as close as to
something "not"</B>
<BR><B>normal that I'll ever be invovled in.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But my wife's story is stange in a way.&nbsp;
One night while watching tv in</B>
<BR><B>the living room, she notices out of nowhere a ballon that she recieved
on</B>
<BR><B>mother's day is floating around from the hallway.&nbsp; It for some
reason goes</B>
<BR><B>directly to her.&nbsp; She's kind of spooked about it and pushes
it away.&nbsp; So she</B>
<BR><B>continues to watch tv and of course I'm sound asleep on the couch.&nbsp;
Once</B>
<BR><B>again here comes that ballon staight to her.&nbsp; Ok now she's
petrified and</B>
<BR><B>tries to wake me up but I'm totally knocked out.&nbsp; The only
thing she could</B>
<BR><B>think of was to pop the ballon with her cigarette.&nbsp; The next
morning she</B>
<BR><B>tells me of the story and that she tried to wake me up.&nbsp; I
recall her saying</B>
<BR><B>something to me but I can't wake up.&nbsp; The next night we are
going to bed I</B>
<BR><B>hear one of my daughter's toys making noise.&nbsp; It's one of those
toy phones</B>
<BR><B>that rings.&nbsp; I went by it to see if the battery is dying but
the toy is fine.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Ever since then I havne't heard it go off by itself, but I
once in a while I</B>
<BR><B>get goose bumps over my body and feel something else is not right.&nbsp;
Hopefully</B>
<BR><B>it's my imagination.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>No Big Deal</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MelonCake2001@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>No Big deal...</B>
<BR><B>I was walking from my boyfriend's remodeled basement to the upstairs
to use</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom.&nbsp; The downstairs was bright, the upstairs was
dimly lit.&nbsp; When I</B>
<BR><B>walked around the corner, I saw "his sister" peer at me.&nbsp; I
told her it was</B>
<BR><B>only me, and proceeded to the bathroom.&nbsp; After I finished,
I realized my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend and I were the only ones in the house.&nbsp; I turned
white and started</B>
<BR><B>to cry- I felt the presence, and it was confusing.&nbsp; My boyfriend
explained</B>
<BR><B>that his sister had also seen the same figure in a white nightgown
(same</B>
<BR><B>description) when she was younger.&nbsp; His father's first wife
had died at an</B>
<BR><B>early age in the house and we believe it to be her.&nbsp; I took
a random picture</B>
<BR><B>months later in the same spot by the bed room, and there is a clear
outline</B>
<BR><B>of a face which the Warren's confirmed (I would download it if I
had a</B>
<BR><B>scanner).&nbsp; Like I said, no big deal, but it was touching to
us.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Night Visits</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Rabecbrown@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I posted one story, but I thought I'd share another that is a sort
of</B>
<BR><B>follow-up to my other one.&nbsp; I grew up in a house that was haunted
by a kind</B>
<BR><B>and sort of quiet ghost, and the only person in our house that didn't
seem to</B>
<BR><B>know it was my dad.&nbsp; He looked at hauntings as some sort of
hooey, so we</B>
<BR><B>didn't discuss with him the occurances that our spirit was obviously
the</B>
<BR><B>culprit of.</B>
<BR><B>Anyhow, I digress.</B>
<BR><B>After a being diagnosed with Melanoma, my father passed away just
a few short</B>
<BR><B>weeks later.&nbsp; My mother, sister and I were devastated and shocked,
to say the</B>
<BR><B>very least. He was the mainstay in our family, so we sort of fell
apart. My</B>
<BR><B>mother and I got into a bad arguement shortly after his death, and
were not</B>
<BR><B>on speaking terms after the funeral. Several evenings during this
time, while</B>
<BR><B>I was asleep, I dreamt that the phone rang and I answered it.&nbsp;
The reception</B>
<BR><B>was rather bad, sort of static-filled and distant.&nbsp; I could
very faintly hear</B>
<BR><B>my father calling my name in a very annoyed tone.&nbsp; I knew immedietly
he was</B>
<BR><B>mad at me for not being there for my mother.&nbsp; Several times,
in the weeks</B>
<BR><B>that followed, I had the very same dream.&nbsp; When my mother and
I spoke again,</B>
<BR><B>the dreams stopped. I suppose people could say that it was my conscience,
but</B>
<BR><B>something else happended that made me feel otherwise. I told my
mom about my</B>
<BR><B>dream, and she said the night my dad died she had a dream that he
got into</B>
<BR><B>bed with her and rubbed his cheek against hers and gave her a squeeze.&nbsp;
She</B>
<BR><B>said she could even smell his cologne.&nbsp; She awoke with a start.
It was the</B>
<BR><B>hospice calling, telling her that my father had passed away just
half an hour</B>
<BR><B>earlier.&nbsp; My sister recently told me that just a few days after
my dad died</B>
<BR><B>she had a dream that my dad called HER on the phone and told her
to take care</B>
<BR><B>of my mother and to tell her that he loved her. Now, I have NO DOUBT
that we</B>
<BR><B>all did get a visit from him. I got yet another visit from him shortly
after</B>
<BR><B>my son was born.&nbsp; I dreamt I was in this auditorium, sitting
on a folding</B>
<BR><B>chair with my son in my lap.&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad walked up, took
the baby from me and</B>
<BR><B>held and played with him for a little while. He then gave him back
and walked</B>
<BR><B>out.&nbsp; I often get sad when I think about how my dad missed
out on seeing and</B>
<BR><B>spending time with his grandkids. I guess he's doing that now in
the only way</B>
<BR><B>he can.</B>
<BR><B>thanks for letting me share. I really enjoy your site.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Wacky Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jgenx@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My experiences started when I was a young girl around</B>
<BR><B>the age of nine when</B>
<BR><B>I moved into my grandparents house in late 90'. The</B>
<BR><B>house was built in the 50's typical track home that</B>
<BR><B>looked like a carbon copy of every other house on the</B>
<BR><B>block.&nbsp; My grandparents where in there late 50's and</B>
<BR><B>where the second owner, to my knowledge no one had</B>
<BR><B>ever passed on in the house. However I did find out</B>
<BR><B>later on that a neighbor had a dispute with his</B>
<BR><B>brother and he was shot on the porch next to our</B>
<BR><B>house, my grandmother was a nurse so she had tried to</B>
<BR><B>help him.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>died in her arms.&nbsp; At first the experience started as</B>
<BR><B>a feeling like a magnetic rush surging through my body</B>
<BR><B>and the little hairs on my neck creeping up.&nbsp; Then I</B>
<BR><B>began</B>
<BR><B>having dreams of a man who was talking to me, asking</B>
<BR><B>me to help him and let him in.&nbsp; I would always wake up</B>
<BR><B>in the morning feeling very tired , like I had stayed</B>
<BR><B>up all night.&nbsp; The dreams eventually</B>
<BR><B>turned into nightmares and I began sleep walking.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>grandfather heard me walking around one night and came</B>
<BR><B>to find me talking to the front door, telling Bryan he</B>
<BR><B>couldn't come in.&nbsp; When I awoke the next morning and</B>
<BR><B>they where questioning me , I didn't recall a thing.</B>
<BR><B>That's when they told me about Bryan... The man that</B>
<BR><B>was</B>
<BR><B>shot on my neighbors porch.</B>
<BR><B>After that the occurrences stopped until November of</B>
<BR><B>2000.</B>
<BR><B>I was 19 at the time and had moved into a brand new</B>
<BR><B>apartment complex with a roommate.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a couple</B>
<BR><B>days before Thanksgiving and I was in my room</B>
<BR><B>packing before I began a road trip up to see my mother</B>
<BR><B>for the Holiday.&nbsp; I was expecting my boyfriend to be</B>
<BR><B>there any minute , he had a key to my apartment so I</B>
<BR><B>thought nothing of it when I heard the front door open</B>
<BR><B>and someone walk towards my bedroom. ( My roommate had</B>
<BR><B>already left town to go to his family so he</B>
<BR><B>wasn't there and I had the door locked. )&nbsp; Anyhow I</B>
<BR><B>stopped what I was doing and spun around to greet my</B>
<BR><B>boyfriend and no one was there.&nbsp; I got a little scared</B>
<BR><B>and checked all the rooms to see if maybe he was</B>
<BR><B>playing a trick on me.&nbsp; He and no one else was</B>
<BR><B>anywhere in my apt. I checked my front door and It was</B>
<BR><B>still</B>
<BR><B>locked , I looked outside and no one was around ( the</B>
<BR><B>complex was very quiet and almost abandoned for the</B>
<BR><B>Holiday).&nbsp; I shrugged it off and figured I was just</B>
<BR><B>anxious to see him and go on our trip and imagined the</B>
<BR><B>sounds.. or I was hallucinating.. I don't do drugs and</B>
<BR><B>I don't have a drinking habit..</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Another incident like that happened about three month</B>
<BR><B>later only this time I was&nbsp; asleep and I heard people</B>
<BR><B>in my living room talking and moving the couch around.</B>
<BR><B>It was hitting my wall pretty hard so I got up to</B>
<BR><B>quiet them down&nbsp; ( occasionally my roommate would</B>
<BR><B>bring women he had met at a club home and they would</B>
<BR><B>be a</B>
<BR><B>little loud.)&nbsp; Well I got up and again no one was</B>
<BR><B>there, the TV wasn't on, no radios where on and my</B>
<BR><B>roommate was still out,&nbsp; it was well after&nbsp; 1 am so no</B>
<BR><B>one in the</B>
<BR><B>complex was up.&nbsp; My couch had been moved though</B>
<BR><B>instead of facing towards the TV it was now facing</B>
<BR><B>towards my wall,&nbsp;&nbsp; That freaked me out pretty good so</B>
<BR><B>I couldn't go back to sleep , instead I&nbsp; picked up my</B>
<BR><B>living room and&nbsp; fell asleep watching C-Span.</B>
<BR><B>After that it felt pretty spooky in my apt and I</B>
<BR><B>decided to speak with my roommate about it..</B>
<BR><B>Apparently he had experienced things like that before</B>
<BR><B>as well in our</B>
<BR><B>apt.&nbsp; Needless to say our lease ran up in April and we</B>
<BR><B>elected not to stay there.......&nbsp; Now I live in</B>
<BR><B>another complex , a little older but so far nothing</B>
<BR><B>creepy has</B>
<BR><B>happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how to explain my experiences</B>
<BR><B>and I don't think I have a spook following me around ,</B>
<BR><B>I cant see dead people.... not even sure if my</B>
<BR><B>experiences are actually paranormal experiences.. who</B>
<BR><B>knows maybe they make couches that can move them</B>
<BR><B>selves now...</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Uncle And My Sister</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JAKRGA@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In 1967 my Mom and Dad where living in Northwest Indiana not too
far from</B>
<BR><B>Chicago.&nbsp; My Mom's younger brother, Connie at the time was
living with my Mom</B>
<BR><B>and Dad during the week because he was working in the city.&nbsp;
He was actually</B>
<BR><B>from West Virginia (my Mom's home state) and would go back every
weekend to</B>
<BR><B>visit his fiance.&nbsp; The weekend prior before he came back to
Indiana, my Uncle</B>
<BR><B>took all of his possessions over to my Grandmother's home for her
to hold in</B>
<BR><B>case anything ever happened to him.&nbsp; The next Friday evening
as he was</B>
<BR><B>preparing for the treck back to West Virginia my Dad proceeded to
give Connie</B>
<BR><B>a hard time about all of his traveling.&nbsp; My Dad was trying
to stress to him</B>
<BR><B>that it wasn't safe to be traveling every weekend back home especially
after</B>
<BR><B>a long weeks worth of work.&nbsp; It just wasn't safe or wise.&nbsp;
Before Connie</B>
<BR><B>left, my Dad asked (jokingly, but still with a point), "Where do
you want me</B>
<BR><B>to send the flowers?"&nbsp; A little after an hour since his departure
my parents</B>
<BR><B>where called to identify my Uncle.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been hit head
on by a semi truck</B>
<BR><B>who was on the wrong side of the road.&nbsp; He was hit going around
a bend.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>police figured that my Uncle did not realize the truck was on the
wrong side</B>
<BR><B>because of the bend and because it was dark.&nbsp; About 2 weeks
later after my</B>
<BR><B>Uncle was laid to rest, my Mom woke up in the middle of the night
to see</B>
<BR><B>Connie standing beside her bed.&nbsp; She said that he had a real
concerned look</B>
<BR><B>on his face as he was pointing to my 6 month old sister's crib.&nbsp;
He was</B>
<BR><B>standing in-between the bed and the crib.&nbsp; She was not frightened
because she</B>
<BR><B>and her brother where very close.&nbsp; My Mom rubbed her eyes but
he was still</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; After a few moments, she blinked and he was gone.&nbsp;
She rolled over</B>
<BR><B>and woke up my Dad and told him what had just happened.&nbsp; My
Dad just told her</B>
<BR><B>that she was just dreaming because Connie was "heavy on her mind".&nbsp;
A few</B>
<BR><B>days after that my sister, Jennifer became ill.&nbsp; She could
not keep anything</B>
<BR><B>down.&nbsp; Twice my parents took her to the Doctor that day at
which the Doctor</B>
<BR><B>gave her medication and sent them home.&nbsp; She proceeded to get
worse that day.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;On the last and third trip to the Doctor, my Dad refused to
leave until they</B>
<BR><B>put Jennifer into the hospital, which they did.&nbsp; During her
brief stay, the</B>
<BR><B>Doctors where trying to figure out what was making her so sick.&nbsp;
My parents</B>
<BR><B>and Grandparents where all up at the hospital and at one point my
Dad took my</B>
<BR><B>Grandparents home.&nbsp; He told the Doctors that if anything should
happen while</B>
<BR><B>he was gone, to not say anything to my Mom until he got back.&nbsp;
During the</B>
<BR><B>brief time that he was gone, my sister did indeed pass away.&nbsp;
My Mom said</B>
<BR><B>that she was walking in the corridor when all of a sudden something
just "cut</B>
<BR><B>through her".&nbsp; She made note of the time and waited a short
while.&nbsp; Finally</B>
<BR><B>she went and approached the Doctor and said "she's gone isn't she?".&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>Doctor was amazed that she knew and wanted to know who told her
-&nbsp; at which</B>
<BR><B>she said the no one did.&nbsp; My sister ended up dying from a rare
case of</B>
<BR><B>pneumonia.&nbsp; I believe my Uncle tried to warn my Mom of my sister's
death.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, Back in late 1993, I moved into an old duplex apt. in Durham,
N.C; my home town. I worked 3rd shift and slept during the day. For a long
time, I thought I would see something moving really fast through the kitchen
in the corner of my eye. I saw it almost daily. It looked like a short,
black thin form, that had tiny light in it, similar to a T.V. station that
has signed off the air, blurry and always moving very fast from right to
left. It would come out of the bathroom, speed through the kitchen, and
through the outer kitchen wall. I lived alone and wrote it off as tired
eyes or imagination. I never told anyone because I didn't want to sound
silly. Then one night, in mid 1994, my girlfriend and I came in after a
late evening out, around 12:30 to 1:00 am. I was off work for the weekend.
I sat down in the bedroom in my rocking chair, my girlfriend ( now my wife
) walked by me and ask if I wanted anything to drink, as she was going
to the kitchen. I said "no" and as she stepped into the kitchen, she stopped,backed
up and looked at me with a puzzled, strange look. She said "Did you see
that"? I said "no", as I was looking away at the time. She described what
she saw, and it was identical to what I had been seeing. I was scared now.
I could no longer make myself believe it was just my eye's. Later, that
night when we finally went to bed, I couldn't sleep. I was wired. On top
of that, a picture fell off the wall, and there was a loud crash in the
walk- in closet. The clothes support pole snapped in half, all that night!
I got no sleep. I stayed with my mom for a few days after that. Also in
my apartment, I once saw a ball of light floating across the room, up high
near the ceiling. It moved slowly to a corner, then went back into the
kitchen. Also, I felt a touch on my backside and my back twice as I was
trying to go to sleep two different mornings after work. I was never harmed,
but I know there was something..... strange in that old house. NO JOKE!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank You,</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Upper Flat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jaguarlily@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My story happened aboUt ten years ago when a roommate and I rented
an upper flat..We moved in and from the very start I noticed a strange
type of dust(it was webby and very thick) I dusted every other day because
of the&nbsp; intense accumulation. About 2 weeks later I started hearing
an old gramophone playing music in my bedroom evenings and nights..My friend
and I worked at the same hotel, I would get home about 5:00 and Laurie
would get home about 10:00pm. One evening I went to the store, came back
and as I was walking past the bathroom, I noticed what appeared to be Laurie
taking a bath with her back towards the door(open door?) I asked her what
she was doing home so early, and got no reply, so I just went into my bedroom
and watched TV about 3 hours later the front door slammed, and I went to
see who it was..It was Laurie. I asked her where she had been and why she
didn't talk to me earlier.She then told me that she just got home from
work..I saw the same "girl! ' several times after that in the bathtub...we
had 2 puppies that refused to enter Lauries bedroom, one day we both came
home to find the puppies dead in the back corner of the room, both had
died of heart attacks..Lauries boyfriend started getting weird to the point
that he seemed possessed by something evil..once he threw me down the stairs
and in a strange voice(evil) told me to leave his house!! For two weeks
every night I would hear furniture being moved throughout the bottom flat,
heavy furniture..I would hear cats crying and sounds like muffled talking...I
never saw the people during the day these two weeks...Suddenly I saw them
and asked what was going on downstairs&nbsp; I couldn't sleep because of
all the racket..they informed me that they just came back from Florida
and they were gone for two weeks.I asked them what their apt. looked like
and if they had friends staying there ? They told me no friends were there,
and the place looked like they left it, and they did ! not own animals.
Two weeks after that they suddenly moved out and left a bunch of stuff
behind..I didn't notice them moving at all. The next tenet started moving
in, stayed there one night, and disappeared , never came back to get her
stuff.One day I walked up the long back sidewalk to the house and unlocked
the two locks. we had just had the locks changed) and started u the stairs
when I noticed an old man sitting half way up the flight of stairs.He was
wearing clothes not from this time and was very tired looking and had a
cane..I was surprised as to how he got into the place as no on was living
downstairs at the time...I asked him what He was doing, and he replied
that he was waiting for his daughter...I told him that no one lives here
that knew him....I took one step up and turned around to invite him up
for tea , and he was gone...He was as a regular person...something was
different though.Fires would start in the attic, basement under the steps....and
my boyfriend a! t the time would never enter the place from first sight(before
we knew anything) he said the house was evil. Lauries boyfriend became
so violent that she had him arrested for beating her up...We moved then.
The thing I remember the most is when we were first moving in, the little
boy next door&nbsp; told us that we are moving into the "ghost house"The
neighbors told me that years ago a family lived in the duplex.Parents down,
daughter and husband up...The husband threw the daughter down the flight
of stairs and killed her, he then shot himself, the father was so grief
stricken that he hung himself in the attic.....</B>

<BR><B>Dark Secret</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cmelo@fhmg.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Cindy and I recently found your websit and I just want
to start off by saying it is so good to know that we are not alone in our
experiences. About 2 years ago a very close friend of mine (Kelly) asked
be to sit with her 2 children while she attended a party I agreed and decided
to bring an old friend from school to keep me company. Well my friend lives
on a farm she had just bought the place and it was my first time seeing
the place. Kelly is a dog breeder and has the kennel set up behind her
back yard behind a bunch of trees and bushes; there is a walkway the leads
directly threw the back yard to the kennel. Well once Brenda (my friend)
and I arrived I was hit with a very uneasy feeling of being watched. I
just chalked it up to a new place. Kelly took us threw the house and then
we went up stairs and I thought I was having a heart attach. I broke out
in a cold sweat and I found it very difficult to breath Brenda my friend
had to help me down the stairs once I was on the main level I felt fine,
Kelly left us at about 8pm that night and that is when all hell broke lose,
the feeling of be watched intensified as well as noses coming from the
upstairs back room. I tried my best to ignore what I was feeling, (very
unwanted and had no business being there). The night wore and finally the
kids were ready for bed (Brenda put them down because I could not make
it up the stairs). I was cleaning up in the kitchen when I thought I saw
someone walk across the living room I called out assuming it was Brenda
to bring in the remainder of glasses so I could leave them soaking. When
I got no reply I turned around to see 3 glasses sitting on the table. I
called Brenda again to thank her then I finished up and left the glass
to dry in the dish rack. I found Brenda watching TV stretched out on the
sofa bed "Did you call me" she asked I told her what had happened in the
kitchen and all the colour drained from her face and at that moment I knew
that she did not bring me those glasses.</B>
<BR><B>Trying to take our minds off of what was going on we decided to
watch a movie we decided to was a Disney movie well about &frac12; hour
into the film the VCR kept shutting off or the film would be put on pause.
This went on for about 1 hour; finally we gave up on the movie and decided
to play cards. As we moved to the kitchen and settled down for a game of
crazy 8 we heard someone walking on the back porch (which ran half way
around the house. I got up and walked over and opened the door there was
no one there nothing out of place. We went back to our games the noises
from up stairs seemed to be getting louder I finally said "there has got
to be someone in this house" Scenes from "When a Stranger Calls" flashing
in my head I decided that I would go and get one of the dogs from the kennels
out back (I was hoping that Brenda would volunteer but no such luck) If
there was someone or something in the house the dog would smell it out.</B>
<BR><B>I made my way to the back door and flipped on the back floodlights.
Brenda stayed by the door crying asking me not to leave her. I took a deep
breath and ran all the while chanting in my head "Oh sweet Jesus" I grabbed
the first dog I saw and made my way back to the house. Once inside the
house with the dog I made my way to the front stairs just then we heard
a door slam. I had to go upstairs and get those kids. I found my self praying
we hit the 3rd step from the bottom and the dog began to growl and its
hunched came up I pulled on the leash but he would not move finally I picked
the dog up and carried it the rest of the way, when the dog realized what
I was doing it began to yelp and squirm in my arms by the time I made it
to the top level I had several bit and scratch marks on my arms and neck
from the dog (husky) once I let go of her she ran right back downstairs
and sat at the bottom growling deep in her throat .</B>
<BR><B>I have never moves so fast in my life I grabbed those kids right
out of their bed sheets and all and ran for the stairs all the doors slammed
at once. I came down the steps to find Brenda with her coat on ready to
go. I told her to relax that what ever was in the house was up stairs.
We got the kids on the sofa watching a movie while Brenda wrapped my arms
and neck (I still have the scars on my neck and arms) We were all in the
family room everyone was sleeping I was still watching TV when all of a
sudden the dog came into the room sat by me and began to growl at the entrance
of the room. My blood ran cold I heard a voice in my head saying GET OUT,
Again I picked up both Kids and screamed at Brenda we made our way to the
front door backing out of the door my eyes never leaving the family room
door way. I have never felt such hatred before in my entire life (27 yrs)
once outside the front door slammed.</B>
<BR><B>Needlessly to say I never went back there, I later found out from
my friend Kelly (owner of home) that the original owners of the house had
caught his wife sleeping with his farm foreman and hung himself in the
upstairs back room. Kelly and her family have since moved out of that house</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for listen it feels so good to share such a dark secret.</B><B></B>

<P><B>South Port</B>
<BR><B>By: ds_0422@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This is one of the first experiences I have had. I hope this site
is serious and it looks as though it is. I live in Kenosha, Wisconsin which
is on the shore of Lake Michigan. I can't remember how old I was probably
7-9 yrs. old. My Dad had taken me down to Southport which is a park by
the lake. I can still remember after all this time. I am now 34. IIt was
a stormy day out, not raining yet but very overcast and a little foggy.
My dad was standing nearby and I went down by the water. I looked out over
the lake and if I had not seen it I would not have believed it. There was
an old-day ship in the water. It was all wood and on the deck of the ship
I saw two men. One man was standing by a mast and the other man was hanging
over the edge of the ship on top of what appeared to me a net of sorts
only it was made of thick rope and the spaces inbetween the weaves was
to great to catch fish so I don't know what exactly it was. It was hanging
over the edge of the ship as well. The man that was hanging over the side
had what looked like a knife in his back. I know it sounds crazy. Let me
just say that as a child I was frightened by what I saw and ran back to
my dad. I told him what I saw and told him to look but he said he did not
see anything. I have tried to do some investigating on ghost ships of lake
michigan but cannot locate anything specific. I have even looked at the
schooner pictures I have found but truthfully I have to say that the ship
was older than that it was for lack of a better words a ship like you see
on the documentaries on tv regarding Christopher Columbus etc. ships of
that kind.It even had the sails up. I am not sure if ships like that made
it this far inland but that is what I saw.</B>
<BR><B>Another experience I had was one that affected me many times. I
was very close to the same age and my great grandmother whom I was close
to had died. Soon after (please I am not crazy) I began waking up at night
to a voice whispering my name. Not Dan or Danny but Daniel my full name.
Going into my parents room when scared was not an option so I would go
into our bathroom where the light was always kept on. Believe me I would
stay in there and fall asleep again. I dont think my parents ever asked
me why I did that and I never even to this day told them. This would happen
almost nightly. My parents went on vacation and left me with my grandparents
for the two weeks they were gone. They lived in kenosha as well. I was
relieved as I did not have to worry about the voice waking me(I never saw
an image or ghost etc. just the voice). I was wrong. I woke up one evening
to the voice again. I had never snuck into bed with my grandpa ever accept
this time I was really scared. I grabbed my blanket and went to my grandfathers
room. I opened then closed the door and layed down on the floor next to
his bed. He was a very no nonsense guy who would have let the sparks fly
if I woke him. After I closed the door I settled in to go to sleep figuring
the voice wouldn't follow me. I had just put my head down when the door
opened and I felt a "breeze" go down the length of the bed ruffling the
dust cover of the bed. I think after that I finally fell asleep as I would
absolutely not wake my grandfather.</B>
<BR><B>Another experience... My dad owned a very old 2 flat house. My wife,
children and I lived upstairs. I work third shift so at that time on the
weekends I was usually up late, very late. All the lights were turned off
which is how I liked it. All except for me were well asleep. There was
a food pantry adjacent to the kitchen. There was a certain way you had
to shut the door to the pantry or it would not close. I went into the kitchen
and sat at the kitchen table. I remember starting to think about how old
the house was and about the people who had lived there throughout the years.
I don't know why I thought of this I just did. I began thinking about ghosts
and how it has been reported that they can appear as they want. I kept
thinking to myself that if there were any ghosts in the house that if they
chose to show themselves it would be in human form and not some hideous
creature. As I was sitting at the table the pantry door slowly opened.
I did not see anything but I cannot explain how scared I was. I knew that
the door could not open by itself, it was impossible. Despite being scared
I stayed there, okay maybe to scared to move. I then had thoughts of the
people that used to live in the house. These are those thoughts... the
family that lived there(when I don't know) were excited about a fair that
was the big thing in Kenosha. Everyone and everybody would be there. One
girl from the family did not want to go, I think perhaps she was to rondevou
with her boyfriend although I am not quite sure. Anyway while her family
was at the fair someone broke into the house thinking everyone would be
at the fair. Unfortuneately they were not. The girl was raped then murdered.
Again I did not see anything like apparations but I just thought through
this. I did not want to see a ghost (especially after the door opened)
These are my stories and I hope this site is a serious site. There are
a few experiences that I have not wrote about but I will save them for
later, Thank you for listening.</B>

<P><B>Shortly after moving to Maryland, from Napa,</B>
<BR><B>Calafornia, My stepmom started hearing things in our</B>
<BR><B>ancient house. While I was at School, my Dad at work,</B>
<BR><B>she would sometimes go crying hysterically to the</B>
<BR><B>neighbours house, saying that a threatening voice</B>
<BR><B>seemed to follow her around, and that she felt that</B>
<BR><B>someone was looking at her so intensly that she</B>
<BR><B>thought they were looking inside her soul. Cheesy, I</B>
<BR><B>know, but my stepmom never did any of this before, and</B>
<BR><B>I had been living with her since I was five.</B>
<BR><B>One night, after my Dad and stepmom had a really</B>
<BR><B>horrible fight, I went and sat in my room to get away</B>
<BR><B>from it all. I stood in front of my mirror and looked</B>
<BR><B>at my reflection. The shouting suddenly stopped</B>
<BR><B>downstaires, and the room went so unbearably cold that</B>
<BR><B>I moaned out loud. A woman's face surfaced next to</B>
<BR><B>mine in the mirror. A flowing white, transparant dress</B>
<BR><B>hung in folds around her body. She opened her eyes,</B>
<BR><B>big insane holes which extended to the back of her</B>
<BR><B>head, colorless and swirling eyes that seemed to</B>
<BR><B>swallow everything in the room, but not me.</B>
<BR><B>I ran as fast as I could, to find my Dad and stepmom</B>
<BR><B>watching T.V, their fight apparantly over. I told</B>
<BR><B>them, and my stepmom said: Get in the car. We are</B>
<BR><B>going. I've seen her too.</B>
<BR><B>My stepmom had seen her reflection in the bath. She</B>
<BR><B>was out to get us.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Few Extra Houseguests</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lilmac2001@webtv.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My name is Jamie and I live in a house which some say is haunted
but we</B>
<BR><B>look at it as just a few extra house guests with a pass for permanent</B>
<BR><B>living arrangements.&nbsp; We purchased this house in November of
1991.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>was only in third grade at the time we moved.&nbsp; My parents and
the</B>
<BR><B>previous owners became friends.&nbsp; However, they did not tell
my parents</B>
<BR><B>of their theory of the house being haunted until the papers were
signed.</B>
<BR><B>>From the moment we set foot in this house we knew we weren't alone.</B>
<BR><B>There are no evil spirits or poltergeist&nbsp; here just friendly,</B>
<BR><B>mischievous little spirits who are trapped and have become part
of the</B>
<BR><B>family.&nbsp; Though as friendly as they are, they have caused me
to be</B>
<BR><B>frightened on a number of occasions.</B>
<BR><B>We have estimated around four separate spirits in the house.</B>
<BR><B>The first is a little girl around nine or ten years of age....she
first</B>
<BR><B>appeared to me soon after we moved in.&nbsp; My mom calls her Miranda,
and</B>
<BR><B>she don't seem to mind.</B>
<BR><B>The second spirit is Leo Anderson.....(please don't use his last
name if</B>
<BR><B>you use this story).&nbsp; I have a picture of him.&nbsp; He's 13
years old and is</B>
<BR><B>obsessed with me.&nbsp; He's around so much that if something turns
up</B>
<BR><B>missing my first reaction is " okay Leo, give it back."</B>
<BR><B>The third would be Annabelle ( a name I chose for her).&nbsp; She
would walk</B>
<BR><B>up the back porch to the kitchen door everyday at the same time...that</B>
<BR><B>only happened a couple ,months&nbsp; and&nbsp; I haven't heard it
since.</B>
<BR><B>The fourth spirit is Cane.&nbsp; The reason behind his or her name
is because</B>
<BR><B>the first time I encountered it, it was in the shape of a cane.&nbsp;
It is a</B>
<BR><B>very mischievious spirit who likes to appear in the form of various</B>
<BR><B>objects.&nbsp; To this day we do not know whether it is a female
of male.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately, I have no way of sending pictures to your site, I
hope</B>
<BR><B>you enjoyed the story and I don't mind if you use it in your site.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Haunting from a Beloved Pet</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bigred281@email.msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>About 7 years ago I moved into my own house with my husband and I
had to leave my cat Bustopher Jones behind at my parents house.&nbsp; He
was a stray that I had fed and cared for until he found his way into our
home. Well, I got a call from the vet at work one day and he said that
Jones would'nt make it he had to many intestinal problems from being a
stray for so long and if I would give the word to let him go.&nbsp; I did'nt
want to prolong suffering so I said if there is nothing to be done, let
him go.</B>
<BR><B>Soon after, I would be laying in bed in the morning and feel a cat
jump on the bed at my new house.&nbsp; It would only reach my feet and
then the sensation would leave.&nbsp; Eventually it got so that the sensation
would reach my legs, chest and face.&nbsp; After awhile I got used to it
and refered to the feeling as Jones.&nbsp; I told him that I was sorry
that I had to let him go, but I wanted him to be without pain and that
I loved him.</B>
<BR><B>Afew days later, I felt him jump on the bed and walk up to my face.&nbsp;
He rubbed his body which felt very real against my face and went into the
headboard.&nbsp; I never felt him again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Haunting?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:weretiger_ex@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I found a link to your site and read some of the stories there.&nbsp;
They say</B>
<BR><B>that we fear what we don't understand and I think whoever said that
is</B>
<BR><B>right.&nbsp; Your site's stories scared the hell out of me.&nbsp;
Worst of all, they</B>
<BR><B>reminded me of when I experienced some unsettling shit at the age
of 10 back</B>
<BR><B>in 1990.&nbsp; My father, his wife (not my legit mother), and myself
lived in a</B>
<BR><B>duplex in Green Bay, WI for around 7 years.&nbsp; Being young and
having an</B>
<BR><B>active imagination, I ALWAYS feared the basement.&nbsp; I hated
going down there</B>
<BR><B>alone.&nbsp; It was the only place in the house where I felt terrified.&nbsp;
The rest</B>
<BR><B>of the house never put me at ease either, but the basement was the
worst.</B>
<BR><B>It was almost seperate from the rest of the house too since you
had to go</B>
<BR><B>into the garage to get to the steps that lead into the basement.&nbsp;
Anyway,</B>
<BR><B>one day my friend Aaron and I were sitting in my garage on a couch
that was</B>
<BR><B>about to be thrown out.&nbsp; We were just sitting there in silence
for a bit</B>
<BR><B>when we heard footsteps coming up the stairs leading from the basement
to</B>
<BR><B>the garage.&nbsp; After about the 6th step, we bolted out of the
garage to the</B>
<BR><B>front yard, neither of us believing what we just heard.&nbsp; What
made this such</B>
<BR><B>a strange moment was the fact that nobody else was home, and we
never heard</B>
<BR><B>the door at the bottom of the steps actually open.&nbsp; We just
heard the</B>
<BR><B>footsteps.&nbsp; About 10 minutes later, I went back in my house
and found nobody</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; After that, I can recall countless nights when my television
in my</B>
<BR><B>room would turn on and off in a rapid fashion.&nbsp; It scared the
hell out of</B>
<BR><B>me, but my parents acted like it was no big deal.&nbsp; I knew it
wasn't normal</B>
<BR><B>though.&nbsp; I never thought about this until years and years after
we moved out</B>
<BR><B>and to a new town altogether for my dad's job, but the neighbors
on the</B>
<BR><B>other half of the duplex were always changing.&nbsp; Thinking back,
I'm sure that</B>
<BR><B>we never had the same neighbors for longer than a year or two.&nbsp;
I can't help</B>
<BR><B>but wonder if even stranger things were happening in the other half
of the</B>
<BR><B>house?&nbsp; Since then, I've never encountered anything similar
in my new home,</B>
<BR><B>but I'm convinced that the place in Green Bay has some kind of story
behind</B>
<BR><B>it.In the basement, I would occassionally find writings on the walls.&nbsp;
My father</B>
<BR><B>always accused me of putting them there, but I never did.&nbsp;
Sorry to have</B>
<BR><B>left that out before, but its been about 7 years since I lived there
and had</B>
<BR><B>blocked out most of those memories until your site brought them
back to the</B>
<BR><B>surface again.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>South Africa</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gareth@ico.ac</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name's Gareth Pike, and I'm 26. Living in Durban, South Africa.</B>
<BR><B>I'm actually interested in editing/publishing a collection of ghost
stories as told to me by family &amp; friends.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, MY story is...</B>
<BR><B>I was about 9 or 10, and living with my folks in the Hogsback, in
the Amatola Mountains of South Africa's Eastern Cape. This area is renowned
for its supernatural phenomena, and is rumored to have been inspirational
to Tolkein in his writing of "Lord of the Rings".</B>
<BR><B>One day I and my my mom and stepdad went for a picnic in the ancient
forest near where we lived.</B>
<BR><B>My folks decided to go for a hike after lunch, but I was tired,
so I just stayed behind, poking sleepily at the camp fire with a stick.</B>
<BR><B>This was Autumn, so there were stacks of dry leaves in the clearing
where I was.</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly I heard the tread of footsteps behind me -very loud on
the dry leaves. They were getting closer.</B>
<BR><B>As they grew louder, I naturally turned to see, thinking this was
my folks returning early from their hike.</B>
<BR><B>I was lying on the ground at the time, and as I turned, all I saw
was the silhouette of a man, leaning down above me, almost blocking out
the light. This was just a black figure, a shadow, and I could make out
no details of the person.</B>
<BR><B>I was too startled to be scared.</B>
<BR><B>This "man" reached out his hand and put it on my shoulder.</B>
<BR><B>I felt the hand ON ME - neither hot or cold.</B>
<BR><B>It seemed like this man wanted to tell me something, certainly I
didn't feel threatened in any way.</B>
<BR><B>Then, with the hand still on my shoulder, this shadow figure just
froze, and then quickly faded away to nothing.</B>
<BR><B>There was no one with me in the clearing.</B>
<BR><B>My folks returned half an hour later, to find a very somber little
boy, who didn't even tell anyone about this experience until over ten years
later.</B>
<BR><B>To this day, I wonder what that shadowy man had wanted to tell me.</B>
<BR><B>Anyone had a similar experience of such 'shadow figures'?</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am a strong believer in spirits, however my boyfriend was fairly</B>
<BR><B>skeptical. I' ve never actually seen them but I feel their presence</B>
<BR><B>everywhere I go, especially in my dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a story
and it goes</B>
<BR><B>like this;&nbsp; My boyfriend ( let's call him Pat) and I were driving
back</B>
<BR><B>from Montreal after a party at one of our friends house. We where</B>
<BR><B>driving behind, what looked like a van.&nbsp; It was about 2:00
a.m. and</B>
<BR><B>pitch black on this 2 lane highway in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp;
We were</B>
<BR><B>playing this game to stay awake, I'd say a letter and he'd have
to say a</B>
<BR><B>word that began with that letter, then he'd say a letter and we'd
have</B>
<BR><B>to repeat what the other said along with our word... so on and so</B>
<BR><B>forth........All of a sudden he stops and whispers "what the hell
is</B>
<BR><B>that ?"&nbsp; As I turned my head to look,&nbsp; I saw two old school
chairs lying</B>
<BR><B>on their backs placed perfectly in the center of both lanes.&nbsp;
By the</B>
<BR><B>time we came close enough to see what it actually was we drove straight</B>
<BR><B>through it, sending pieces of wood flying everywhere (luckly we
hit it</B>
<BR><B>with such impact that the car kept going straight.) We both went
totally</B>
<BR><B>silent.&nbsp; I turned to look at Pat and noticed he was shivering,&nbsp;
he said</B>
<BR><B>he was very cold,&nbsp; I simply felt a chill.&nbsp; We started
talking about what</B>
<BR><B>had just happened we kept asking ourselves why hadn't the van in
front</B>
<BR><B>of us swerved to prevent hitting the chairs?&nbsp; The chairs were
placed in</B>
<BR><B>such a way that it would have been&nbsp; impossible to avoid.&nbsp;
Till this day</B>
<BR><B>every time we speaks of that incident we get chills.&nbsp; since
then Pat has</B>
<BR><B>become more open towards the spiritual world.</B>
