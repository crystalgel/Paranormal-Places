I woke up to hear a knock at my bedroom door.&nbsp; I knew it could not
have been my mother or brother because they wouldn't knock, they would
just come in.&nbsp; So, confused, I went to answer it.&nbsp; I opened the
door and there was no one there, so I looked down the hallway, and (let
me also add that a few months before this my cat, whom I was very close
to had died) I saw a faintly greenish glowing outline of a little boy maybe
dressed in trousers, (I couldn't really tell) and he was walking down my
hallway towards the stairs, and beside him was the faint yellowish greenish
outline of my dead cat, and the little boy was walking along and petting
the cat.&nbsp; I looked at it for the longest time, and it seemed the</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When I was about ten,
I was laying on my bed one afternoon reading what my sisters and I had
written on the wall.&nbsp; All of the sudden, I felt an ice cold hand on
my shoulder.&nbsp; I whirled around and there was nothing there.&nbsp;
I jumped up from the bed and ran downstairs.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>A few times while in my
bedroom I would hear pebbles or something like that hitting my window.&nbsp;
There were no tree branches near the window or anything else that could
account for the noise.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>One night I woke up and
in my bedroom I noticed the figure of an old lady.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was as though she
was sitting and she had her hand on her knee and she was watching me.&nbsp;
I crawled under the covers and got closer to my sister.&nbsp; I peeked
again and she was still there.&nbsp; I asked my mom the next day if any
old lady's had lived in our house.&nbsp; She told me that 2 spinster sisters
who were old had lived in the house.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My father died when I
was 15.&nbsp; One day when he was still alive I was in his and mom's bedroom.&nbsp;
I was looking out there window into the yard and noticed my dad in the
yard.&nbsp; All of the sudden the scenery became black and I was seeing
a scene of my father in a coffin. At the time of my vision my father wasn't
sick.&nbsp; He did die 4 months later of an undetectable cancer and at
his funeral the coffin and flower arrangements were the same as my vision.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I once had a dream that
I was driving home and I ran over a black cat and the cat's body ended
up in the ditch across the road.&nbsp; The scary part was the next night
I was driving home and that exact same thing happened.&nbsp; I was so shocked
when I saw the cat and realized my dream was coming true.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Another thing that has
happened to me is that when a close family member would die I would have
and awful headache the night before and not be able to sleep.&nbsp; This
happened when my dad, grandma, grandpa, and uncle died.&nbsp; I was close
to all 4 or them.&nbsp; My dad was the first headache I had.&nbsp; I told
my mom about my headaches after my dad, grandpa, and uncle had died.&nbsp;
One night</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>There were many encounters
when I lived with my parents at their townhouse.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I will share 3 with you....</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>1) When I was a teenager,
I was laying on the couch, watching an awards show. It was summer, so my
parents were both at work. As I lay there, I closed my eyes briefly because
they felt heavy. When I went to open them again, I could not. I found that
I physically could not move one muscle. I knew that I was not sleeping,
because I could still hear the awards show going on in the background.
I heard them introducing different artists, etc.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I started to freak out
a bit, so I made sure to concentrate on the show, to clam my nerves. Soon,
I felt myself being turned over. I felt no hands moving me, just the feel
of my body rolling completely over. I felt my face turn against the cool
leather on the couch. When I had rolled completely over, I felt my body
slowly move down to the end of the couch (about 3 feet) and stop against
the arm of the couch. I felt warm tears roll down my cheeks. I don't think
I was crying, but my eyes always water when I am scared. I didn't move
for a few minutes and soon I heard a child's voice (could not tell if it
was a boy or a girl) say my name 3 times. I actually</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>FELT the whisper against
my ear! After that happened, I was able to move again...immediately. I
started crying like crazy and called my Mom at work to tell her. Luckily,
my mother had also had experiences, so she believed me.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>2) Again as a teenager,
I was laying in bed to go to sleep. I have always had a habit (before I
got married) of tucking myself in as tightly as possible once in bed. I
did not want to be able to move at all. This made me feel more secure for
some reason. Anyhow, I would tuck myself in until I could just barely fit
my arms back under the covers. This night was no different, I did the same
thing. I was moving out soon, so there were some boxes in my room with
various things in them. One, on the other side of my room, had all my books
in it. It was VERY heavy. I could not lift it, my Dad had to move it for
me after it was packed. Anyhow....I went to sleep with my door open and
the door to my parents room open as well. I woke up in the middle of the
night, and again had the problem with opening my eyes. This time, however,
I was able to open them after a few minutes. When I did, I realized that
I could not move my legs at all. I started to sit up, having to actually
un-tuck my covers in order to do so. When I sat up, I saw that the large
box filled with books (that I could not lift) was sitting right on top
of my legs on the bed. I panicked. I screamed as loud as I could for as
long as I could, to no reply. I noticed that my door was now shut. Finally,
after what seemed like forever, my parents came rushing through my bedroom
door. They calmed me down and my Dad took the box off my bed. They asked
what happened, and I told them. They both looked scared to death. They
asked why I had shut their bedroom door that night. I had not.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>3) This happened to my
parents after I left the house. They had experienced many things on and
off through the years. My Dad, who is a very stubborn Irish-Catholic, still
swore that he did not believe in ghosts. Even though he had "walked" off
of the loft on the 3rd floor (you get up to it by a ladder.. it is an open
room that takes up the third floor, no door to get in)in what seemed like
a trance, twice and obtained minor cuts and bruises while falling to the
2nd floor. He never remembered doing so, though my Mother and I saw him
do it both times. Anyhow, one night they were laying in bed. Nothing had
happened in a while, so my Mother said out loud, "Well, I guess we haven't
a ghost anymore!". Seconds after she said this, there was extremely loud
banging on the wall behind their bed. It lasted for a few minutes and shook
the whole room. My Dad thought it was the neighbors in the townhouse next
to them. The problem was, they were on vacation at the time.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>They did not even have
pets that could have made the noise.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>siedlce@hotmail.com</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My name is Kristie. Before
I moved out of my apartment I lived there for 10 1/2 yrs.&nbsp; There were
strange things that happened occasionally, but I usually disregarded them.&nbsp;
On September 17, 1998 my parents had gone to Long Island for a wedding.
I was at home in Pennsylvania with my younger brother, younger sister and
my boyfriend. I was studying for an English test (I was a 15 yr old junior
in high school) with my boyfriend for about an hour. When we finished,
we put our heads together and said a prayer to God, thanking him for allowing
us to be together.&nbsp; As we were about to finish the prayer, I felt
the strongest presence right beside me!!!&nbsp; I have never felt a spiritual
presence like this ever and&nbsp; I was so scared. I told my boyfriend
about it and we quickly left my room and went into the living room with
my siblings.&nbsp; I slept in the living room with my siblings that night
because I didn't want to sleep in the room after that. The next day, I
was doing my homework in my room and I heard something fall. It sounded
like someone threw something into my room. When I looked to see what it
was, it was a stuffed animal that fell from the shelf. Let me tell you,
this animal was a pink lion and the way it hit the floor it was as if somebody
hit it off the shelf with a lot of force, as if someone was angry. For
the next three weeks I was plagued by nightmares of being ambushed, but
I defeated the people trying to hurt me. At night we had a night light
in our room, for my sister because she was still afraid of the dark, and
I could see a shadow walking around the bunk beds and climb up my ladder
to my bed &amp; I could actually feel the energy of this ghost right next
to me in my bed!!! If I rolled over to where it was, I could feel its energy
clashing with mine.&nbsp; It was constantly all around me, as if it was
trying to consume me and I didn't know what to do. My parents pretty much
thought I was crazy because one night the ghost sort of appeared to me
and I screamed,&nbsp; "Get away from me!" I never experienced anything
like it before. The ghost was a woman because I could see the long hair
covered by a veil.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I felt three presences,
but hers was the strongest. Some nights I woke up in the middle of the
night so hot, I would through my sheet off me for a while and then put
it back on. Well one night I did that, but when I was going to put my sheet
back on, something happened. I got goose bumps and tried to get my sheet
back on, but I couldn't move!! Then I heard this wicked laugh right in
my ear and this male voice said " Ha Ha Ha Ha! I want you're pleasure!"
and after that was said I sprung out of my bed and said I don't think so!
I told my dad and he took all the stuffed animals down, including the pink
lion, and he put up all white animals on the shelves. After that, the female
ghost never bothered me again.&nbsp; I still can't figure out why she chose
to make herself known 8 yrs after I moved into the apartment with my family.&nbsp;
She never bothered anybody else in my family but me and I can't understand
it. One psychic told me it wasn't a woman, but a man who committed suicide
in the apartment&nbsp; and went to me because he thought I was beautiful
and knew I was psychic. Another psychic said it was a man and a woman who
died in their sleep. The man didn't do anything, but it was the wife. She
just wanted to cause mischief and have fun, plus she didn't know she was
dead. I still have no idea what to believe, but I'm sure glad my new home
isn't haunted!</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I live in Columbus, Ohio,
and I know my home is inhabited by someone or something besides my husband
and myself. Our home is a half double and when we were fixing it up to
move in you could sit in our basement an hear "something" walking across
our living floor, but when you would go up to see who it was there is none
there.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Then after we moved in
I had a 14"x19"mirror hanging on the wall over my fireplace mantle, now
my mantle has glass candles and pictures on it, we had went to dinner and
when we returned the mirror was on the floor. The mirror was on one side
of the fireplace and the frame was on the other. NOTHING on the mantle
was touched and the mirror was NOT broke, and the nails of the frame were
still tight in their place. I took the mirror down and put a picture of
me and my 4 year old up and the same thing happened. I have had my candles
turned upside down. I am not scared to be there. "It" has never hurt us
in anyway so why move? We also have a huge Halloween party every year and
I think "It" help with the haunted house...loll</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>At the corner of Forrest
and Adams street stands a rooming house. Compiled of three basic structures,
the 1st being below a small hill, the next part of the building went upwards
2 additional stories, and the 3rd addition into/on the hill in the back,
all rented to college students.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>One day my wife was at
class and I looked out from the 2nd floor to see many different agency
police cars and officers, guns drawn, racing up the front stairs. (Our
unit was apt #1). I went into the hall, and as the officers ran past they
asked "Who was yelling?" They all ran past me to the top floor of the house,
and as I turned to go back into the apartment, I almost crashed right into
a small women, her hands clutched to her mouth, a frightening look on her
face, and dressed in what appeared to be old-time or "peasant' clothing
down to the floor. I was so startled, I said "Excuse me!" and I turned
to my door, turned back, and she was not there. She was GONE!</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>She was no-one who lived
at house, and as the hallway dead-ended, the basement door was permanently
closed off at some earlier time, and my wife and I had full sight of any
and everyone who entered the house. There were 14 stairs to the front door,
and she was just GONE. She also had&nbsp; a"choppy" kind of haircut. like
when family members in the old days would cut each other's hair.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sometime I intend to
research the history of this house, as over the years, it obviously went
thru 3 renovations to make it as huge as it was. This corner house is surrounded
by Historical Homes from the 1840's, and the 1st part, the main house,
is at least that old. It is down the street and over 1 street from The
Ladies Library, also listed in your files as HAUNTED. This whole town has
many old strange houses, farms and cemeteries. After 15 years, we still
live in the immediate are.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hi! I just wanted to give
you a little bit more info about the Heritage museum in Brooksville, FL&nbsp;
I can also give you info on a few places in AZ as well.&nbsp; I donated
time at the museum before moving to Orlando and saw and heard a lot of
things.&nbsp; Also grew up in AZ.&nbsp; I think these things are just drawn
to me since anywhere I live or visit a lot seem to have things happen....lucky
me! hehe&nbsp; Oh well, it is at least VERY interesting at times.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The heritage museums
most known spirit is that a Jessy May.&nbsp; She was a little girl, 3 yrs
in age that died in the house in the late 1800's of influenza.&nbsp; (You
may have this info already but I just wanted to fill you in if you didn't.)&nbsp;
While donating time for a short while as a docent, I was warned of the
unusual things that tended to happen there.&nbsp; For one thing the attic
was at that time set up with old toys on display almost like a playroom.&nbsp;
These toys, such as blocks would over night end up in the downstairs parlor
and other things would often be moved around the house as well.&nbsp; In
the dining room the table is always set and silverware tends to move around
little Jessy May apparently seems to like tea parties!&nbsp; Keep in mind
that the house is locked up tight and an alarm is in place at night so
no human could do this.&nbsp; Also in the evening when we would lock up,
I would always check the upstairs and shut off lights.&nbsp; Often times
I would hear little footsteps behwn to it especially when I was younger.&nbsp;
Let me know. :)&nbsp; Take care, Kellie</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>A friend and I were both
downstairs in her live-in basement. Both her Mom and sister were out somewhere
so we were alone. We were talking when suddenly we heard the garage door
open. The garage was connected to the basement so there was no mistake
in what it was. Both of us assumed it was her Mom and sister and thought
nothing of it, so we went to go greet them at the door.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When we opened the door
we saw that the garage door was still closed and there was no sign of anyone.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;We both went back
to the basement and nothing happened for a while until we heard the garage
door open again. This time we were kind of hesitant to investigate. Just
as we thought, the garage door was still closed and there was no one there.
yet again we both went to the basement and this time saw heard the door
open and then slam shut. The door that leads to the garage has a spring
on it so the door would shut automatically after being opened. My friend
yelled, "Hey Mom!" but then discovered that there was still no one at home.
The swinging open of this door continued until the two of us ran up the
stairs to the living room where we watched the TV with the volume on high
blast.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When we told her sister
about what happened she told us about some things that had happened to
her. She said that at night a very tall man would stand in the doorway
of her room and just watch her with this evil smile in his face. She would
also see black shadows roaming her room. This had begun to scare her so
much she later moved in to her sister's room and only went into her own
room if necessary.</FONT></FONT></B>

keep it brief.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>A three bedroom house
with a spacious lot, no different from any of the other houses on the street.
I'm the oldest of four boys therefore I was the first to have my own room
in the house. The room I occupied was the same one used by my grandfather
prior to his death, a heart attack suffered in an apartment up the street.&nbsp;
He lived with us many years prior to getting his own place.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>There were many incidents
ranging from the drawers opening and closing in the kitchen (he enjoyed
snacking at night) to the floor creaking at night due to someone walking.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>These were excused as
someone going to the restroom even though no one admitted to it. The worse
incidents were to follow.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>On one occasion I was
sleeping in my room when I saw a man standing at the foot of my door, I
immediately jumped up to turn on the light. It was gone.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This happened many times.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I excused this as my grandfather.
Probably&nbsp; still lurking in the house. I became imune to it and just
the same I ignored it. It became tiresome. I guess what really bothered
me (because I really had no explanation to it) was one night while I lay
half asleep I saw a snake coiled from the ceiling fan trying to swing down
and reach over to bite me. Again I rationalized and excused this as a bad
dream. None-the-less I was pretty shaken by this so out of fear I opened
the door, turned on the bathroom light and headed back to my room.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Is this a bad sign??</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>A few seconds later one
of my brothers from the family room quietly&nbsp; called to my attention
asking "did you see the snake from the ceiling?" I asked "what!?" he had
seen the same thing! My room was closed shut when it happened. I asked
him for details but he refused to comment on anything else and said he
must&nbsp; of had a bad dream. He, unlike me refuses to accept that these
incidents were happening.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Soon after I moved out
it got worse. My other brother took over my old room (which I failed to
mention) was the only room that had access to the crawl space above the
house.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Numerous, numerous! times
my family would call me in a panick of the loud foot steps they would hear
above on the ceiling. This obviously would be impossible since it WAS a
crawl space. My father extremely skeptical was co-incidentally never around
when it happened until one day it did. He was furious that it was happening
and immediately went into the crawl space to see what it might be. He didn't
see anything. He dismissed it as rats. (funny, I've never heard of rats
able to make that type of sound) . It got to the point that our dogs would
go crazy ever time the ceiling steps would start. They actually would run
away from the house. Go figure.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Eventually it stopped.
The footsteps in the house still happen occasionally.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The remaining family
members just ignore it now. Again we became imune to it.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>One other note. Something
I thought you might be able to shed some light on.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>One of my brothers spends
alot of time with his wife and daughter at the house. My niece (who is
now 8)&nbsp; claims (while she was about 2 or 3) to see an elderly man
sitting on one of our lawn chairs near our fish pond&nbsp; in the backyard
(which he used to enjoy) calling her over. This would be during the day.
Are young children able to see spirits whan adults cannot? Why so and not
the adults? My niece never knew my grandfather. He died many years ago.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>One other thing. Now that
we are all moved out of the house the room has since then become a den/spare
room with a TV my father enjoys relaxing in. If anything ever happened
in there..."He'll NEVER TELL" but I noticed one day while I was in there
that you can see some of the old green walls that were painted. right through
the corners of the&nbsp; wall paneling of the room. The same colors while
my grandfather stayed there. A stupid question...but since we just decided
to "cover up" the old decor with paneling...would that have any bearing?
or am I just fishing for excuses?</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Thank you for your attention.
I'm sure you hear much worse scenarios but again if you have any feedback
please let me know.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hi everyone,</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My name is Julie and I'm
32, mother of a wonderful 4 year old son which I would give my life for...married
to a wonderful; incredible man. We live in Ottawa, Ontario... Canada.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When I was about 8 (I
believe), I had my first terrifying experience with the dead. My great
grandma had past away a few days earlier...although I can't really recall
the event all that well. One night, a few days after her death, I woke
up in the middle of the night needing to go to the bathroom. -the bathroom
was just in from of my bedroom separated by a long hallway that went basicly
across part of the first (and only) floor. Beside my bedroom, was my parent's
bedroom. My bedroom to the bathroom was only like 3 feet to walk across
the hallway. As I walked toward the bathroom, for some reason I looked
into my parent's bedroom. What I saw terrified me. Across my parent's bed,
I saw my great grandma lying on her side, holding her head with her left
arm looking at me with these black - see through eyes... I WILL NEVER FORGET.
Very young and innocent, I didn't really ever thought that ghost really
existed. That made me aware of another world that we were not taught about
in our upbringing.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When I got a little older,
we had bought a house in Hawkesbury, Ontario that we stayed into for I
would say 5 to 6 years. I was about 16 at the time. We had just purchased
the house and while my father was renovating the upstairs, the whole family
would be sleeping in the basement. One night, as we were spending a little
time together , we heard this funny noise upstairs. We thought someone,
for some reason, had entered our home so my father went up to see what
was going on. To all of our surprise, all 4 rings of our ceilling light
had just fallen on the floor. Not one at a time but all 4!!! We would hear
footsteps in the house and when I was alone, the front door nob would turn
and nobody was even there. I was so terrified. I did not know what to make
of these events. At night, I would hear someone open the fridge door and
close, open pantry doors and close loud. I would constantly feel a presence.
I would barely have any sleep in that house. Sometimes, I would go and
sleep with my bro</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is a terrible feeling
as a child to be afraid like this. It's not ok. I don't think in any way
that this is a funny thing. When you're a child, you get confused and don't
understand the logic of these things.... actually because "there is no
logic.... "</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When I got older in my
early 20s, my grandmother past away. God I adored her. She was my best
friend. And to this day, I miss her like crazy. Not long after she had
died...maybe a few nights after, she appeared to me while sitting on the
side of my bed late one night. She appeared right next to me. She had her
arm around my neck and she looked at me saying "Julie don't be sad, you
"know" that I'm not really gone". and she disapeared into thin air. I felt
such a relief that she felt my sadness and that she loved me enough to
come and comfort me. I will never forget that precious moment.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;I work as a Mortician.
My job is to clean and care for the dead, Many people ask me if it is scary,
and if the dead come alive and haunt me... well, to me I am not scared
I am more comfortable around the dead than the living, the dead seem to
need me and find what I have to say more interesting then thoes who live.
Now you wondere how exactly to I know they are listening? Well I know that
they are there because I like to listen to the radio lots. know the spirits
who are new to the morgue don't always play with the radio because they
are more afraid that they can see their lifless body before them. But thoes
who don't seem to care and like to play with me change the music I&nbsp;
listen to by switching the stations when ever I am draining a body of blood
and can't be botherd with minor things even if they are extreemly anoying
(loud static from the radio)&nbsp; Now I should make it clear that not
all morgues or funeral homes have ghosts in them but they will come across
one or two who decide to tag along side their body , But I always offer
them to sit with me while I eat lunch or read. And when I am dressing and
applying cosmetics to the dead I make sure that the lingering spirit sees
my loving touch I have to everybody ( Facials, Hair care, Nail care, Hair
shaving or plucking...)&nbsp; I want them to know that I love and care
for everyone of them who comes in. I guess What I want to say is that ghosts
are not to be feared but loved even if they are bothersome, thoes are just
needed to be talked to I would be angry and afraid to if I felt like I
was on the outside of a glass box, wouldn't you?</FONT></FONT></B>

freakin hanging on me! I live by a patch of woods thats fenced off. I was
walking my dogs with a friend and her dog down there on a HOT night. My
parents think I'm a 'animal in a human's body' because I can sense, hear,
see, and smell things no one else can except animals. Anyway, all the dogs
suddenly perked up and started to whimper. It got cold and I was frozen
in my tracks like in another world. My friend started screaming and I-along
with the dogs-snapped out of it and saw what she did. We both screamed
and ran inside, explaining to everybody what we saw. It was a</FONT></FONT></B>

was beautiful and the other half was pure bone. She was wearing a black

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hello my name is Ian and
I recently just spent two weeks in Italy.&nbsp; I live in LA and was told
of many must see locations in the area of Tuscany, but the one that most
appealed to me was the torture museum in the famous city of San Giominano
(I hoped I spelled it right).&nbsp; On the 9th and last day in Tuscany
before I took my long drive to Rome we decided to stop in San Giominano.&nbsp;
My father decided to leave me in the torture meseum a.k.a. the Kriminal
Museum while he went off with my sisters.&nbsp; The Kriminal museum was
originally a torture chamber built during the time of the Spanish and Italian
inquisition.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I bought my ticket at
around 5:30 p.m. and proceeded to the bottom part of the torture chamber.&nbsp;
As I entered the deepest part of the chamber I got really scared.&nbsp;
I was all alone except for a german man and his children.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The chamber was quite
odd and in some places it was really cold and I would go back to theat
place and it would not be cold anymore.&nbsp; Light gusts of wind would
come out of nowhere and there were no windows, doors, and it was underground.&nbsp;
I began proceeding through the chamber until i was stopped by a ghostly
figure standing right behind a Iron maiden.&nbsp; It was a shade of white
that I had never seen before. I could barely make it out but there were
depressions where the mouth, eyes, and nose were.&nbsp; I stood frozen
for what felt like 10 minutes.&nbsp; it then darted straight across the
room in the direction of the opposit wall.&nbsp; I could even hear it's
feet going across the floor.&nbsp; I ran like a bat out of hell and nearly
cleared 20 stairs, but fell and slid down ten other.&nbsp; I later spoke
to the man in the reception room.&nbsp; He asked me where i saw it, and
I said in the chamber.&nbsp; He told me that there are hundereds of ghosts
in there annd many seem to be insane.&nbsp; I will never forget what happened
to me in Italy, and I hope others will enjoy my story.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>To start my story, my
father and I had a pretty decent relationship most of my life.&nbsp; Of
course when I was a teenager I did the usual teenage crap and rebelled
and we grew apart.&nbsp; I had moved out, and ended up with an abusive
boyfriend.&nbsp; I ended up moving back home, and Dad and I renewed our
relationship.&nbsp; That nine months before my dad's death were great.&nbsp;
We actually got a chance to REALLY talk and I think my dad knew his time
was short.&nbsp; He kept telling me that I would find the right guy eventually
and I would make a good mom someday.&nbsp; On Feb. 11, 1997, Dad passed
away after a long illness that we would discover later was peritonitis.&nbsp;
Things didn't start happening right away.&nbsp; It started after I met
the man who would be my husband later and I became pregnant with our son.&nbsp;
About four months into my pregnancy, we started noticing little things
around the house.&nbsp; Mostly having to do with noises and objects that
had belonged to my father.&nbsp; After my son was born and he was about
a month old,&nbsp; my husband and I were watching television in the living
room and the baby was asleep.&nbsp; My mother's room ( we were staying
with her due to after Dad died she couldn't pay the bills on her own) was
right off the living room.&nbsp; She had went to bed, and after about half
an hour she said she had seen a white orb about the size of a softball
traveling between the bedroom door and her vanity mirror.&nbsp; No light
source caused it, her room was pitch black because she kept tin foil and
trash bags over her windows to keep the light out.&nbsp; Then when we were
getting things ready for the wedding, it seemed like all hell broke loose.&nbsp;
Objects being thrown, kitchen drawers opening and shutting by themselves,
strange noises, you name it we had it.&nbsp; Then the wedding day came.&nbsp;
I wasn't nervous cuz I knew Dad was there.&nbsp; I wore his turquoise ring
I gave him for a Father's Day present for something blue.&nbsp; Everyone
at the wedding and the reception said they could feel him.&nbsp; Even some
of the pictures taken at the reception were "questionable".&nbsp; A couple
have what appears to have a "mist" in them (my son is in most of those
photographs).&nbsp; Then we really didn't have anything happen for a while,
until my son started getting old enough to talk.&nbsp; Then in the evening
when only me and my son were at home watching TV most times, he would get
all excited as if someone had just come home.&nbsp; He would run up to
the babygate and wave and yell "Hi, Hi, Hi!"&nbsp; And I would go up to
the gate and look down the hall to see noone there and I would ask him,”
Who are you talking to?"&nbsp; And he would look up at me and smile and
say, "Granpa Momma."&nbsp; He never met my father.&nbsp; My son was born
on 2-1-00 and Dad died 2-11-97.&nbsp; After he did this for a couple of
weeks I invested in an EMF detector.&nbsp; After running a few test runs
to get readings from the hallway on basic electrical outlets and whatnot,
I waited for my son to say Hi to Dad again.&nbsp; Sure enough, about a
week later it happened again, this time I ran into the hallway to see if
I could get a reading.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; A perfect circle about two feet
in diameter smack dab in the middle of the hallway.&nbsp; I know it was
Dad.&nbsp; We have since moved but my son still says Hi on occasion to
Granpa, and my sister and I can still sense his presence.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I was just wanting to
comment to the stories of crazy man's. (The Roanoke Texas Area Myth) First
let me introduce myself. My name is Norissa and I have first hand information
on this tower and site. See, my father was the one that built the tower.
He was working for a man by the name of Glenn. The tower was one of the
first buildings built out in this area. It was said to be the center piece
of what was to be a up-scale neighborhood. The reason why the continuous
construction was stopped is because of reports of power supply lines like
the ones seen just behind the tower were a main cause of cancer. Also the
population boom for the area was not strong enough yet to withold this
kind of development. My mom has told me stories ever since I was younger
and now that my friends and I travel out to this place at least 3 times
a week we have grown used to the mysterious occurrences that happen out
there. My mother told me the story of when they first painted the tower,
it was on Mothers Day (1985 or 86?) and even though nothing ended up happening
she had the horrible feeling that something was wrong out there. It is
seen to us now that there is something out there that does not want you
to be there. Many times while heading down the long dirt road we have been
chased off by trucks, sounds and often times just bad gut feelings. Also
this bridge that everyone talks about. I am not sure of what happened but
many times before I tried the stop, honk 3 times and wait method. Only
once did I have anything happen. After we did the routine, with the windows
down of course, we heard footsteps. On one occasion though my best friend
had his trusty digital camera with him that night. He took pictures of
the sign entering the bridge from the front and the back. On the camera
you could see the figure of a male standing before the front of the sign.
It is apparent that his clothes are all torn and ripped. From the back
of the sign you can still see the figure and torn cloak or shirt next to
the sign. Now about the tower, the only thing that we really had happen
to us visually when we approached the tower is that on one occasion when
we took pictures of the tower we realized later on at home that there is
a bright small blue light that was in the grass blades right next to the
tower. When you magnify the picture the blue glow looks like a small hand
pointing towards the tower. Twice coming back to our cars from the tower
we have heard sounds in the distance that comes closer of metal poles hitting
one another. Also, my friends have reported that when they walk there with
only one accompany they hear whispering and footsteps on the walk to and
from the tower. What is even more messed up and unexplainable about this
area is that on October 1st 2002 at about 1:30 in the morning a few of
my friends went out to this area. On the way out there Derek, who never
is skeptical was obviously disturbed about being out there. The road to
the bridge coming from the west has about four&nbsp; 90 degree turns. on
about the third one Derek had told everyone else that he felt like there
was something out there and that he saw a shape in the road. After he said
this, he had convinced the driver to turn around. When they turned around
they noticed that where they had been driving only 20 seconds earlier in
the middle of the small dirt road was now a dirty, stained old mattress.
How it got there no one knows. The only thing that surrounds this road
is flat hay fields and old gathered trees that hang over the road. There
are also a few abandoned farms. Parked in the front of the lot of an abandoned
barn during the day you can see two bulldozers; but at night it is a different
story. When you drive by this vacant property the metal equipment that
is painted a bright yellow color is not visible, even with flashlights.
Between the bridge and the burnt down tower is a church.(a member of the
church once told us it was a non denominational church) This church is
kind of our meeting ground. This Church seems to tell the story of everything
out here. The bulldozers that are not visible at night can be heard off
in the distance when the sirens beep as the machines back up. The bridge
and its mysteries can be seen from the west side of the church. From the
back of the church you can see a mansion that sits in the way of viewing
the tower. This mansion is always occupied by what we believe is cult members
till the early morning hours. No matter how many times we sit out behind
this church with our cars off we can always hear trucks driving down the
dirt roads towards us. Only a few times have we actually seen someone approach
us. My reasoning for telling you my side of the story is not to prove you
wrong but from what my dad says is that Glenn Had two daughters one son
and a wife. His wife ended up dying from strokes. Glenn, well we're not
sure if he is still alive. His son, Bruce actually helped to build the
roads that are now barely together. We heard he has a family of his own
now and were not sure how the girls are doing. I know that the original
builders are not the ones to be possessing this land but I have no doubt
in my mind and heart that there is something out there that does have control
over this land. What ever it is, it lets you know as soon as you cross
over its territory.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I’m 19 now and most of
my experiences have happened recently, although I remember a few from when
I was a child. I’m a student at a Big Ten University and stayed in the
dorms my first year here. My roommate and I were soon to find out we had
another roommate. One night I was dreaming that I was lying in a bed across
from another bed and a girl was pacing in between. Well, my dream soon
faded to reality when I noticed myself blinking. We had lofts, so the floor
that was there in my dream was now gone, but the girl was still pacing,
about 5 ft in the air. I don’t know what came over me and I didn’t mean
to say anything, but I blurted out “What are you looking for?” The girl
stopped and looked at me, her eyes were just dark holes, and then faded
away. I wasn’t scared of her, I just went back to sleep. During other nights
I would be startled awake by what sounded like heavy books being thrown
to the floor and in the morning nothing would be out of place. Things would
go missing only to end up in the middle of the floor days later.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My first touching experience
took place there also. I was taking a nap on the futon with my boyfriend
when I felt what I thought was my boyfriends scruffy chin rub on my forehead.
It woke me, but I didn’t open my eyes. It happened again and so I thought
he was trying to get my attention, I looked up expecting to see his face
and there was nothing there, he was about 2 ft away from me with his back
towards me fast asleep.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My roommate however had
the creepiest experience. She rarely had any but hers I thank didn’t happen
to me. She came in the room from the shower down the hall and went to her
mirror when she noticed she had a drop of blood on the tip of her nose.
She wiped it off onto her finger expecting to see a popped zit or something
but her nose was clear. She showed me the blood on her finger and told
me what happened so we checked her legs arms, everywhere to see if she
had cut herself shaving. We checked her towel, robe, slippers, everything
and there was no blood anywhere else. We still do not know where it came
from.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Last night was my most
recent experience which made me want to read about stories on-line. It
was at my parents home, which we all think is haunted by some man. I was
ready to fall asleep when I was startled awake by a loud pop in front of
my face, minutes later I heard dripping water. That ghost mostly bothers

see a cloud/mist/veil/ whatever you want to call it, before the patient
dies. It's ominous and very real. I work in the ICU and have seen this
many times. Some people do not see it, but a few nights ago, I shared this
with a friend of mine (ICU nurse), she said she never paid attention to
it, turns out&nbsp; the next night she worked&nbsp; her patient codes and
dies. I asked her later-- did you see it? and she said, yes, and she had
to rub her eyes thinking it was her, well, it wasn't and the fog did not
go away, it hovered over the patient during CPR. When they called it, meaning
cessation of CPR, the fog lifted and the room was clear. Actually, this
happened again the other night. I saw it, cloudy as ever hovering over
the patient. Indeed the patient was still "with" us, but slowly slipping.
It hovered for hours.</FONT></FONT></B>

both my husband and I are Civil War reenactors. We spent our honeymoon
touring the major battlefields in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
We spent quite some time at the Chancellorsville battlefield outside of
Fredricksburg, Virginia. My husband's great-great-great uncle was Brigadier
General Amiel Weeks Whipple who was shot at Hazel Grove in Chacellorsville.
We arrived at the battlefield late in the day. It was overcast and very,
very quiet. While at Hazel Grove, my husband, Dennis, wandered off to read
some of the plaques placed next to the battery. I stood on the hill, just
listening. I began to walk in the direction where Dennis was, when I was
startled to hear a bugle blowing. I spun around, but it then faded and
then came back, almost as if it were borne on the wind. Except there was
no wind. Being a reenactor, I know bugle calls and this sounded like a
call to arms. I ran down the hill to join my</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I would like to share
my experiences with someone who won't think I'm crazy...lol.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;When I was 5 years
old my Mom, Dad and I moved to a house in Crownsville.&nbsp; It was about
70 years old, and had originally been built as a summer home only.&nbsp;
My Dad did a lot to the house over the years to renovate it.&nbsp; When
I was about 10 years old, he finished the new bedroom on the front of the
house and he and my mother moved in.&nbsp; I got their old bedroom, at
the back of the house.&nbsp; I am not sure if this bedroom was on the house
originally, because it was built on a concrete slab and the rest of the
house was over a basement.&nbsp; My mother claimed to see a ghost materialize
from the heating vent into the room.&nbsp; We all laughed it off.&nbsp;
Later on I didn't think it was so funny anymore.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; My parents were
very strict and didn’t leave me alone in the house until I was 13.&nbsp;
After they left, I was really creeped out by the feeling in the house.&nbsp;
I felt as though I was being watched.&nbsp; I wandered into the kitchen
and I heard a really weird sound.&nbsp; Then I noticed that the cupboard
doors were moving, it looked like they were vibrating.&nbsp; I recognized
the noise as the glasses in the cabinets all vibrating against one another.&nbsp;
I ran back to my room and stayed there til my parents got back.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; One time I got
this brilliant idea to bring a Ouija board into the house.&nbsp; My grandmother
had lots of junk in her back yard, and as I dug around I had found the
board wedged between two small buildings.&nbsp; If I'd been a bit older
and a bit smarter I would have left the thing there.&nbsp; I shoved it
into the back floorboard of my mother's car underneath my jacket.&nbsp;
Somehow I snuck it inside later on without being seen.&nbsp; It was just
the board and the planchette, the Parker Bros. kind.&nbsp; I put it in
my underwear drawer, all the way at the bottom, hoping to play with it
later.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; I had failed school
that year so I had to go to summer school.&nbsp; I knew I would have to
get up early, so I went to bed early.&nbsp; I was awakened some time later,
after my parents went to bed.&nbsp; I *thought* I had heard a rattling.&nbsp;
I listened for several minutes, heard nothing, and went back to sleep.&nbsp;
I woke up again a little while later.&nbsp; Again I thought I had heard
rattling, and this time I thought it had come from my dresser.&nbsp; I
was slightly freaked out, but I heard nothing after a few intense minutes
of listening, so I rolled over and went back to sleep.&nbsp; I woke up
a third time, this time I was angry.&nbsp; I still heard it when I woke
all the way up so I hurried and turned my light on.&nbsp; I SAW the dresser
drawer move for a few seconds.&nbsp; Then it stopped.&nbsp; There was no
more sleep for me to be had that night!&nbsp; The light stayed on and I
stayed sitting up in my bed til dawn.&nbsp; Then I got into the drawer,
snapped the board it pieces, and threw it out my back window.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; The last thing
that happened while I lived in that house occurred when my best friend
stayed the night.&nbsp; We were supposed to be sleeping in my bed, but
being kids we were up talking.&nbsp; We both shut up at once and looked
out my bedroom door (it was the kind of house where all the doors line
up.&nbsp; I could look out of my door and see clear to my parents' bedroom
door.&nbsp; In between were my old room, the kitchen and the living room.)
We both saw glowing orbs floating around in the living room.&nbsp; There
were about 5 of them, and they were way brighter than any of the lamps
we had.&nbsp; She and I stared in awe for a few minutes and then they faded
away.&nbsp; She and I are still friends, but we never have talked about
the glowing 'balls' floating around my living room.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Thanks for listening.&nbsp;
I never have been able to explain what happened the night of the Ouija
board rattlings, for all I know it could be the workings of an overactive
imagination, but it sure seemed real to me.&nbsp; The terror of that night
never has faded.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My ghostly experience
occurred a few years ago during a camping trip with me, my mom, and my
step dad. We left in the evening so it was getting dark and we were about
the only ones on the highway. I was admiring the country view and saw behind
us a pair of, what looked liked headlights, following us. I could not make
out an image of a vehicle, but I didn't think anything of it. After a few
minutes, our truck blew a tire and we turned off onto an old country road
to repair the damage. My step dad tried to turn the truck off but it wouldn't
shut off so he took the key out of the ignition and it still wouldn't shut
off. No matter what he did the truck still wouldn't shut off. We all got
out of the truck and he started to repair the tire anyway. As he was doing
so, I noticed the pair of headlights that were following us earlier slowly
coming our way (I still couldn't make out a vehicle) and then they just
disappeared. Vanished! There weren't any turn offs in that area where the
lights were or anything. Then, at that moment the truck shut off and my
step dad got the tire fixed. We continued our trip and arrived at a camping
spot near the playground. On the night after we got there, my mom and I
were heading to the bathrooms and we noticed that the swings started swinging
on there own. There was not a breath of wind that night and not a soul
had been around there. They just started up on there own and kept going(
it was just 2 swings next to each other out of 4). They were still going
on our way back from the bathrooms but finally they stopped at the same
time. It was really strange.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I've owned this large
3 story, late 1800's, building for the past 25 or so years.&nbsp; The first
floor is 2 storefronts and the 2nd and 3rd originally had 3 apartments
per&nbsp; floor.&nbsp; I converted 2 of the 2nd floor apartments into one
large apartment for myself.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When I first bought the
building I had a great deal of work to do on it.&nbsp; My mother would
occasionally visit and she would ask me who was in the back room of the

never thought much about this until later in&nbsp; life as she now sees
nonexistent people nearly everywhere.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sometime after gutting
the building and making it&nbsp; partly useable I was working on the first
floor and saw a young boy running through the store.&nbsp; Since the place
was locked up tight and there are 7 alarm systems and only one was off,
it was impossible for the child to hide from me.&nbsp; No child was to
be found.&nbsp; Over the years I and many others have seen a child running
through the store.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Many years ago my friend
Scott shared the apartment and had a rear bedroom of his own.&nbsp; One
evening he came out to see me when I got home and complained&nbsp; that
something had sexually assaulted him.&nbsp; He found the event very painful.&nbsp;
I somewhat dismissed this as folly on his part, but never forgot it.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>A few years later I rented
that same room to another fellow and he had a similar experience.&nbsp;
He moved out the next day.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I rented a room to a fellow
who is gay.&nbsp; He never had&nbsp; problems until his friend came over
to visit.&nbsp; They were alone in the building at the time.&nbsp; They
were in the bedroom when the bed lifted a few inches off the floor and
fell down. Then the bed moved a couple of feet from its location. Finally
the tenant had a set of barbells sitting on the floor. They were tossed
up in the air several times hitting the floor with a bang.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>After this happened I
began to read up on getting rid of spirits in a building.&nbsp; I placed
a pentagram with proper symbols in the room above the tenants room and
went through the ceremony.&nbsp; From that day forward nothing else happened
in the building.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>That is until the roof
leaked above that room and I brought up a tarp and buckets to catch the
leak.&nbsp; The tarp covered the pentagram.&nbsp; Since then people, including
myself, see things in the building.&nbsp; Mostly visions of people.&nbsp;
Some people leave the building immediately when this happens.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

People will listen to me, but they wont believe me. Anyway I will tell
you why I believe its haunted. I'm not sure who it is... I haven't had
any readings with any psychics. A couple of nights before all the strange
stuff started to happen, I had really weird dreams. One dream was about
my spirit guides. I was able to see dead people in my dream, although at
the time they didn't know they were dead and I didn't know they were dead,
until the end of the dream. I remember turning to my friend and saying
now that we can see them in my dream, what’s stopping me from seeing them
in real life? Anyway one night in my room I was sitting on my floor reading
a book, when I felt something cold blowing on my right ear. There wasn't
any windows open in the house, so I turned my head to the right to see
what was making that air. When I did that, the breeze turned to the left
ear, and woke up and I just couldn't sleep, it felt like my room was crowded
with all eyes on me!! So I turned on my desk light and radio, but that
didn't work, so I turned on my big light, and still no avail!! With that
I grabbed my duna and slept in the living room, I just couldn't go back
in my bedroom! And my house is only not very old, so I am not sure what

I have had that relate to the unknown:</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Grandma-</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When I was in grade school
my Grandmother Lucille was murdered by a guy named Danny Troyer who was
convicted of raping and murdering several older women in the Salt Lake
City area. I was devastated as I was very close to my gramma. My dad shared
something with me shortly after the services. He said that Grandma had
come to visit him (he was having an even harder time with the situation)
She comforted him and told him several things about his boys (me and my
twin brother.) He wouldn't explain the exact nature of their conversation
but there was definitely a visible change in his demeanor after his "visit".
My dad wouldn't lie to me especially at a most serious time as it was.
I also remember a strange incident about my grandma. We were in the car
on a trip to the store when grandma stopped at a green light. I thought
she was off her rocker or wasn't paying attention so I asked her why she
didn't go. She said "I don't know... I can't." I was wondering what she
meant when a speeding car blew threw the red light from the other direction
at the intersection and hit something down the street with a loud crash.
It all happened very fast; just a few seconds. I am sure we would have
been hit if not for the strange feeling grandma got or whatever held us
back.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Grandpa-</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;My grandfather
came to live with my dad, brother and I while I was in high school. My
friends all became familiar with his peculiar habits and he cracked us
up. One day I came home to find the ambulance pulling out of the driveway
and fire trucks up and down the street. My grandfather was having a heart
attack and was taken to the hospital. He was there for a couple of days
before he died. On the day he died I was playing video games with a friend
when the phone rang. I picked up the phone and said hello but there was
no response. I could hear a woman crying on the other end of the line.
I said hello several times but could get no one to respond so I hung up.
"That’s strange" I said to my friend and proceeded to describe what had
happened when the phone rang again. My dad from the hospital was on the
line, grandpa had just died. I asked him if he had just called a few minutes
earlier and he said no and wanted to know why. I told him about the woman
crying on the phone and the approximate time (just a few minutes earlier).
He said at that same time my grandpa passed away while he held my dad's
hand and the only sound in the room was my aunt Sherry crying.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>One morning months after
my grandpa had passed away I was alone in the house on a Saturday morning.
I got up to use the restroom and left the door wide open as I was alone.
I heard a noise that made my blood run cold. It was my grandfather's bed
squeaking in the next room. The floorboards creaked as if someone was getting
up and footsteps proceeded down the hall past the open doorway to the bathroom
where I was. I could see no one but had clearly heard them. I cautiously
looked out into the hallway and could hear a chair sliding back and the
rattle of silverware on a plate at the table in the kitchen. That was enough
for me I grabbed the phone and started dialing numbers. A friend was home
and I asked him to come over right away I then went downstairs to the landing
by the door to wait for him. He soon was there and I was so startled by
the experience that he noticed that I was "exposed" and my pants undone
from the restroom. I had managed to pee on the rug as well. I recognized
the sounds I had heard immediately because I had heard them a thousand
times before: it was my grandfather's morning routine to shuffle to the
kitchen table as soon as he heard anybody else up in the house.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Grandpa's presence began
to be felt around the house after that. Doors would slam (usually his)
with no apparent reason (the air conditioner was off and the windows closed)
and could not be made to slam themselves in experiments. The thermostat
was one of grandpa’s favorite things to play with while he was alive. He
liked the heat cranked way up; the guy was a lizard. It drove my dad nuts
so finally he installed a clear plastic locking box over the control. My
dad had the only key on his key ring he carried. Several times grandpa
tried to pick the lock or otherwise break open the box but failed or got
caught. He would wear his pilot jacket at the kitchen table and complain
loudly how cold it always was. Several times after grandpa was gone we
came home and the house was unbearably hot. The thermostat had been turned
to 90 degrees and the heater was blasting away even though the box was
still locked up after grandpa passed away. We had no rational explanation
for it as my dad has the only key and sets it to 70 degrees only. The strange
things began to dwindle down after a couple of months and eventually seemed
to stop. We took out grandpa’s things and just stored junk in his room
and at around the same time the weird feeling of his presence was gone.
I don't know if granddad was still "around" or if it was like some kind
of recording of when he actually lived there.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The entity-</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When my parents got divorced
I lived with my mom and would visit my dad on the weekends. I got up one
night while I was at his house and rounded the corner to the bathroom.
As I glanced down the hall on my way a figure walked from the kitchen across
the hall either going down the stairs or into the living room. I immediately
thought a burglar was in the house and flipped on the hall light and charged
towards where they were screaming loudly. When I came around the corner
there was nobody there. My dad came crashing out of his room and I told
him what had happened. My brother came with a ball bat and my dad went
to fetch his gun while he told us to watch the front and back doors which
were both visible from the hall. My dad phoned the police and hurried back
to us. We conducted a systematic search of the whole house with all the
lights on and checked every window and door. All of the window "sticks"
were still in the tracks and the three outside doors were dead-bolted.
Nobody was hiding anywhere in the house! The police arrived and we searched
the house from top to bottom again and found nothing. I knew I had seen
a person and from my description about built and height (it was dark I
didn't see a face) the officer thought it sounded like a female or young
male. I got really scared when we didn't find an explanation for what I
had seen. A few years earlier when my parents had split a person had overdosed
and died in the house before my dad came back to live there. He lived in
the house for many years by himself and said he often was awakened by what
he thought might have been someone trying to hold his hand.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My dad's house is (or
was) definitely haunted, but by whom? Was it a junkie who had passed away
there, Grandma visiting my dad after she had been murdered or was it grandpa
still going through his routine long after his death? I don't know.</FONT></FONT></B>

She is now 14 and one night she was typing on the computer and Amanda her
othe friend was with her. All at once her fingers froze above the keyboard
and she could not type she had lost all feeling from her elbows down. she
panicked as she stared at the screen and a Microsoft Word document opened
all by its self and the keys were being pressed down but not by her. the
letter began "Il mio Danielle di figlia bello" which in Italian means my
lovely daughter Danielle. then it went on and on about how much he loved
her and he is sorry he cant be there for her prom or when she begins driving
or when she gets married. she began to cry and called out "Il pap&agrave;"
and it ended L'amo, la mia copia esatta.&nbsp; which in italian means I
love you, my exact copy. Danielle is an exact copy of her father dark complexion
dark hair thin athletic humorous a real people person. then all at ones
her computer shut down.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This was told to me by
a friend, but I became a believer when I asked his mother about it and
she burst into tears.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Tim said he always remembered
strange things happening in their house when he was younger - doors closing
by themselves, sounds and footsteps, etc. But it wasn't until his parents
decided to move and throw a "we're moving out of our haunted house" party
that something really frightening happened.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The party was in full
swing; his parents had invited pretty much anyone and everyone they knew.
There was a man there that sat on the end of the couch throughout the entire
evening, not speaking to anyone. Tim's mom thought that his dad had invited
the man and vice versa. They later said that he was dressed in black with
dark hair in what they described as a Beatle's haircut. The party was wrapping
up and most of the guests had left, but the man continued to sit on the
couch. Tim's dad had to drive a couple of people home and asked his wife
if she would be okay if he left. She agreed, glanced at the man, and turned
into the kitchen to get started on the dishes. When she turned back around
a few seconds later, the man was sitting at the kitchen table. Later, she
said that she thought this to be strange, but she wasn't scared. Tim's
mother turned on the television to stimulate conversation with the silent
man. On the TV, there was a documentary or something about the Titanic.
Tim's mother remarked that it had been such a terrible tragedy. "I made
out pretty good on that one," is what the man replied. Tim's mother later
said that at that moment, she thought in her mind that this man reminded
her of the devil. To that, the man said, "How did you know who I am?" Tim's
mother told him that she thought it would be best if he left. The man hit
his fist on the table and commanded, "Don't tell me to leave my own house!"
At that, Tim's mother raced out of her house to find her husband pulling
into the driveway. After telling him what had happened, they searched the
house for the man, but found nothing. When talking to guests at the party,
no remembered seeing anyone that fit the man's description. One guest even
remarked that the party was so packed that so many people had no place
to sit. Yet she noticed that the spot on the end of the couch where Tim's
mother saw the man sitting was open all night and no one even attempted
to sit there.</FONT></FONT></B>

Jenny</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>MAPONTE@popcouncil.org</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>About the year 1973 i
got a job restoring the Chesepeak Bugeye Little Jenny in a boat yard near
the Long Island Sound in Suffolk County New York.The vessel was built about
1882/86 and was used recently as an excursion vessel for a long time back
then till it was laid up for repairs. Most of us who worked aboard her
were all very young in our early twenties. The vessel was being completely
overhauled at that time and was kept in and around a large shed during
the cold months. One day i went aboard her on a cold Sunday morning to
survey the work we had done during the past week. The vessel was put inside
the shed and the shed was completely deserted as well as the</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Jenny. I went into the
large cabin and sat down to ponder what vessel would look like when completed
and how excited i was to one day be a part of the crew. Then&nbsp; out
of know where a sound of footsteps running along the port and starboard
side of the vessel was heard. What ever it was it was running for dear
life back and forth back and forth on both sides. I finally yelled up on
deck and told whoever was aboard to stop running thinking some of the guys
came aboard without me hearing them come aboard. Know one answered back
so i went up on deck and not a soul was aboard. I felt a little uneasy
about this and then yelled to see if anyone was in the shed aboard some
of the other vessels. I proceeded to look at the other vessels and yelled
again but know one was in the shed or the Jenny. I was a little spooked
but went back down the cabin again when again the sound of footsteps running
in earnest came from the deck area. It would run from the stern then stop
for a moment on the bow and then run again to the stern. I stood spelled
bound at what i was hearing and felt frozen in my tracks cold but not the
cold from the outside weather. It was a cold that enveloped me. I yelled
again and asked the guys to stop playing and come down to the cabin. No
one said a word but this time the footsteps stopped in front of the companionway
leading to the cabin i was in. It stopped for a moment then proceeded to
come down the steps right in front of me but i did not see a thing and
the companionway door did not open / it just came down the steps and stopped
about ten feet in front of me. I was obviously a afraid but i finally walked
to the steps in front of the companionway but nothing absolutely nothing
could be seen. Finally i got the nerve to open the doorway and climbed
on deck looked around and climbed off the vessel. This happened twice while
I worked aboard her. I made some enquiries from our skipper and he told
me that men were washed overboard under strange circumstances in the 1880s/90s
and a rumor is that a man may have been killed gun running on the Jenny
just before the war with Spain in 1899.The vessel was also used for rum
running during prohibition. and again a man was killed aboard her. I paid
a visit to the Jenny many years later and asked the new skipper if he or
the crew ever had strange experiences aboard her. The skipper and crew
evaded my questions.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My son was only 3 years
old when his great grandmother (my husband's grandmother) passed away on
her birthday, April 20th 1987. She has met and held my son several times
when he was a baby. We didn't see her around much when she was alive. She
lived far from us. Anyways this is something I will never ever forget.
My son was only 5 at the time when it happened. One morning my son and
I sat down to breakfast before I sent him off on the school bus. He told
me that he met an old lady in his bedroom last night. He described that
the lady had a white hair and had on a blue dress and she looked pretty.
I asked him what she was doing in his bedroom. He said that she just stood
by the door smiling at him. He had awoken to go use the bathroom. She disappeared
after he went back to sleep. Out of curiosity, I called my sister in law
and asked her what color dress her grandmother wore when they buried her.
When she said it was grandmother's request that she be buried in her favorite
blue dress. I was dumbfounded and I told her why I asked her about it.
My husband&nbsp; had gone alone to be with his mother to attend his grandmother's
funeral.&nbsp; My son, at the time was only 3 years old, and I stayed home.
How would he know about the dress? It turned out that when she appeared
that night it was her birthday,&nbsp; and her anniversary of death. I get
goose bumps every time I think about this.</FONT></FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Back in the 1980s, my
husband, our 3 sons and myself lived in the country, in a village attached
to the hydro electricity station where my husband worked.&nbsp; One night
a friend of ours died of a massive heart attack and I spent weeks trying
to help his widow, Barbara.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Eventually she left the
village and went to live with her parents.&nbsp; About 18 months after
her husband, Frank, died, Barbara came to spend Christmas with us.&nbsp;
She seemed much happier and confided in me that she felt Frank was always
very near to her.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>She had bought herself
a color Polaroid camera and spent a lot of time wandering around the village,
taking photos.&nbsp; She wasn't very expert, and we used to joke about
her subject matter.&nbsp; There was one photo, which we teased her about
particularly.&nbsp; It was of our vegetable garden (which was totally bare,
as we hadn't got around to planting anything.&nbsp; One of our cats was
pictured, walking across the bare dirt, and the whole bottom right corner
was a whitish blur, as though sunlight had got into the film.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The night before Barbara
returned to her parent's home, we had a small party, inviting all the people
who had been her friends, and Frank's, when they lived in our village.&nbsp;
Barbara talked to some of the guests about her photographic attempts, then
brought out her wad of photos, to show.&nbsp; She was sorting through them,
and I wasn't taking much notice until she said my name.&nbsp; I looked
up and she said, "Look at this," and handed me one of her photos.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;I took the photo
and looked at it.&nbsp; It was the photo of our empty garden and Jasmine
the cat, with the 'sunspot' in the bottom right corner.&nbsp; However,
instead of just a blank spot, I saw a face, looking at me.&nbsp; I didn't
so much see the face, as know that it was there.&nbsp; It was more of an
impression than a distinct outline, but I knew that it was a man's bearded
face, and I knew that it was Barbara's husband, Frank.&nbsp; The most astounding
thing was that his eyes were alive and looking back at me.&nbsp; I knew
that just as I could see him, so could he see me.&nbsp; I let out a yell
and dropped the photo and I could feel the color drain from my face.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Other people at the party
looked at the photo but they couldn't see anything except a vague shape
that might have been something.&nbsp; Only Barbara and I clearly saw Frank,
and saw his living eyes looking back at us.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;I think, perhaps,
that I was able to see this because I had been so close to Barbara, and
spent so many hours with her after Frank died, when she was utterly consolable.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Barbara kept the photo,
but she never saw Frank's face in it again.&nbsp; A vague shadowy smudge
was all the remained.&nbsp; However, after that experience she was convinced
that Frank was alive and well wherever he had gone, and she was hugely
comforted by this and able to pick up the pieces of her life and move on.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; My family, especially
my oldest son, tend to have psychic experiences.&nbsp; Michael, my oldest
son, has had so many odd experiences that I think he could write a book
about them - and probably should.&nbsp; At present his home is haunted
by a cat, seen only as a shadow, but felt when it jumps up on his bed,
and curls up against his legs.&nbsp; However, that's Michael's story, not
mine, and perhaps he will write his experiences for you sometime.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I live in a small cottage
that was built in the early 1940's. When I first moved in, I was busy cleaning
and unpacking. My partner had lived in the house for five years. About
a week after I moved in, my partner went on vacation with his family and
left me alone in the house with my cat.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I noticed that first night
that the cat kept looking at something. It was like she was watching something
walk across the room. Later in the week, I began to notice a feeling like
someone was in the house with me. I chalked it up to new surroundings.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Then one night, I got
up off the sofa and walked into the living room and out of the corner of
my eye saw&nbsp; a lady standing in the dining room by the window. The
whole thing happened so fast. One minute she was there and the next she
wasn’t.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When my partner came home,
I mentioned this to him and he then told me that the house was haunted
by a woman in the 1940's era clothing. Said that about a year before I
moved in that he had a friend staying over and that he had walked around
a corner and right into her. My partner said that he has awoke several
times in the past from someone calling his name.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Not too long after that,
I started having the experience of a small animal jumping in bed and walking
up to the middle. I again mentioned this to my partner and was assured
that it was my imagination. This went on for several weeks. Then one night
my partner yelled down the steps wanting to know where our cat was. I told
him that she was asleep on my lap and had been for the past hour. He said
that he had just had something jump into bed with him and walk up to the
middle of it and lay down. He thought that it was the cat. We both started
noticing that the cat would sometimes bristle up and run from the upstairs
bedrooms. And at one point, I could swear I saw a little black furry dog
walking up the steps. We don’t have a dog.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Now that I have lived
in the house for a year, things have been the same. I have started calling
the lady Mary and talk to her about all the renovations that we are doing
to the house. We don’t see her as much as we first did but, the cat still
bristles up at things that are not there and she watches things cross the
room that we can not see. I figure that they are both harmless and enjoy
us being there.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I was at a friends house
on the new year of 1999, and she has a giant picture window in her dining
room. I was spending the night and we were the only ones awake. Her parents
were asleep in their room pretty much right next to us, and her brother
and sister were asleep on the floor in the living room. We went over to
the picture window to try and see the fireworks. We were trying to see
them when we heard a clatter right above us. We looked up at the ceiling
while hoping it was only rats. we ignored it and continued searching the
sky for fireworks. After about a minute, we heard heavy footsteps. They
were horrible. After that night she still comes to me with outrageous stories
from the night before. One of them was not to l0ng ago. She told me that
she heard a voice one night while she was having trouble sleeping. She
walked out of her room, looked down the stairs, and saw a dark figure standing
at the end of the stairs. She thought it was her mom and started saying
something to her, but it wasn't her mom, not at all. She looked down the
stairs closer, a then it opened its eyes. She says they were a bright glowing
green. When she told me this bolt of pure unspeakable terror shot down
my spine. She also says that after that she claims she was in her room,
and she looked out her window, and saw in her little sister's room a blood
red man Looking right at her. She always has terrifying stories and yet
she is never scared by them herself. I remember in the third grade I was
at her house every morning because I had seen strange figures in my hallway.
Every morning about 2:30 every morning my mom would take me in and I'd
lay on the couch. As I watched her headlights dance across the wall, and
disappear, the room would lower to an agonizing freezing cold. But I do
not wish to give her name, address, or phone number for her personal Reasons.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My Grandmother's (Granny's)
farm has been the center of many unexplainable occurrences over the years..
Me and my family now live on this farm, just not in the original farm house
built by my Granny and her husband (my Grandfather) around 65 years ago.&nbsp;
We have a mobile home located on the farm.&nbsp; I myself have experienced
waking to a small girl standing beside my bed who disappeared when I blink
my eyes to see better.&nbsp; I have awaken to other strange sights and
feelings, but, being the skeptic I am, I try to say that it is just something
that happens when you wake like that.... I don't know.&nbsp; Anyway, most
of the occurrences have been in the farm house itself.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>A little history may
help. My Grandfather, after many attempts, successfully committed suicide
in 1952 by ingesting a pesticide.&nbsp; He had a terrible childhood consisting
of regular beatings.&nbsp; This in the end led up to a alcohol abuse and
severe depression.&nbsp; The story is that he came into the house, laid
down upstairs and got up only to fall down the stairs where he called for
my Granny.&nbsp; Although there are discrepancies in the details of this
fatal moment, and we NEVER talk or ask Granny about this for obvious reasons,
I believe he passed away in the home.&nbsp; He left behind my 36year old
Granny and 5 children...four boys around the ages of 13, 10, 6, 2 and my
mother who was a mere 3months old.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My Granny, now 86, struggled
for many years as you can imagine.&nbsp; She raised all her children running
this farm.&nbsp; She still to this day lives alone in this house and never
says a bad word about my Grandfather.&nbsp; Not me.&nbsp; She's a tough
cookie.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>As for the hauntings,
one occurrence happened when my mother was a young girl, probably pre-teen.&nbsp;
She was in her mother's bedroom looking in a mirror brushing her hair.&nbsp;
She noticed a man dressed in a suit standing in the doorway behind her.
She said he was just smiling and looking at her.&nbsp; Startled, she looked
behind her and he was gone.&nbsp; She ran outside where everyone else was
working in the garden.&nbsp; My grandfather??&nbsp; Don't know.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Another occurrence happened
when my oldest uncle was visiting his mother (Granny) one Sunday morning.&nbsp;
My uncle and his wife were in the living room which is where the staircase
ends from upstairs.&nbsp; They were waiting the return of my Granny with
the other yougins from church.&nbsp; They began to hear sounds of footsteps
and laughter coming from upstairs.&nbsp; They assumed that some of the
youngsters had gotten themselves left home from church and were playing
a practical joke on them.&nbsp; They were yelling out to them, only to
hear laughter.&nbsp; They suddenly heard trampling coming down the stairs
and they watched the door which stays shut at the base of the stairs, waiting
to see the practical jokers, but before the door opened, it fell silent.&nbsp;
Soon, my Granny pulled up in the yard and my uncle and his wife witnessed
all four siblings getting out of the car.&nbsp; Never explained.&nbsp;
Another occurrence was when my mother and a friend were upstairs playing
on a rug.&nbsp; They kept feeling a tug on the rug.&nbsp; They continued
to say stop assumed a brother was the culprit, and it continued to happen.&nbsp;
They decided enough, and investigated out into the hallway, down the stairs
and outside, where all the boys had been playing the whole time.&nbsp;
My Granny has experienced instances, however, she refuses to elaborate.&nbsp;
She is a very religious God fearing woman.&nbsp; She is not afraid at all,
she just says it's Grandfather...watching over her.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The last occurrence I
will talk about is the time my 3 year old son and some others of us were
out in a field in front of "the house".&nbsp; We were standing and talking.&nbsp;
My son and his companions, the dogs, were at the edge of the field near
a wooded area.&nbsp; The dogs began to bark as they looked out into the
woods, but we didn't pay any mind.&nbsp; Thought it was just a varment.&nbsp;
My son starting babbling to who we thought was the dogs, and then suddenly
ran over to us announcing the "Granny lady is over there" while pointing
at where he had been standing.&nbsp; We had never heard of this Granny
lady before.&nbsp; We asked if she looked like Granny, he said yes... that
she had gray hair and was old.&nbsp; He continued to talk about her for
quite a while, but never talked about seeing her again.&nbsp; This farm
is located in a rural area, which is surrounded by woods.&nbsp; I know
there is lots of history here as well as many tales of deaths occurring
near.&nbsp; Not to mention, lots of Indian artifacts have been discovered
in this location as well.&nbsp; Guess we'll never know what's what.&nbsp;
Just wanted to share this true story shared by our family.&nbsp; These
are just a few of the incidences, but for lack of space, I narrowed down
to the more interesting.&nbsp; Just know that no one has ever been harmed
or even threatened by this "whatever".&nbsp; I remain an open-minded skeptic.&nbsp;
My oldest son, the one who saw and spoke to "Granny Lady" is now 7.&nbsp;
He still has a vague memory of this incident, but we try not to talk much
in order to not scare him as he now suffers from severe anxiety.</FONT></FONT></B>

died in the house.&nbsp; After his death the elderly lady locked all the
doors and only used the main bedroom lounge and kitchen.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My brother moved into
the largest bedroom in the house and after a few months wanted to change
rooms but never said much as to why.&nbsp; I moved into the bedroom, I
felt a little uncomfortable in this room at first but thought it was just
my imagination.&nbsp; We had 2 small dogs that used to sleep at the foot
of my bed at night.&nbsp; One night the dogs jumped with a fright and I
heard a deep sigh.&nbsp; I got up and checked the house but all were asleep,
needless to say I didnt sleep much that night.&nbsp; The next night the
same thing.&nbsp; I was a bit embarrassed to tell anyone so put up with
the sleepless nights.&nbsp; Sometimes the sighing was only like a whisper
so I would put my radio on and fall asleep.&nbsp; Many nights though, the
breathing was so loud that the dogs would not come into my room, they would
sleep in the hall across the doorway.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>We had a priest visit
us one day, and my brother told him about our visitor, he said he would
investigate, We watched him stand in the doorway of this room and his hair
on the back of his neck stood on end.&nbsp; He felt that someone had died
there recently, but went home, later he told us that this entity had travelled
home with him in the car and that he had prayed for it to leave us.&nbsp;
It was gone from the house for a few days only.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

at 10.15 pm I was checking on my daughter and I started crying uncontrollably,&nbsp;
I cried and cried and went to sleep exhausted.&nbsp; I had an extremely

bell rang.&nbsp; I answered it and it was my uncle, he said tell eveyone
that I am at peace and not in any more pain.&nbsp; He smiled, then I woke
up.&nbsp; The next morning I picked up my cousin to go shopping and she

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I don't regard my experiences
to be about ghosts, they are apparitions and visions, i am certain- as
much as i can be at least- that they are not beings of the external world.
however the question of what the space they occupy in this world is remains,
if they are figments of my sick imagination then the space they occupy
also is an imagined space, and if that is imagined then the rest of the
space, the one we call "external world" can very well be equally imagined.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>But that is another topic.&nbsp;
The experience i will mention here happened around February or March at
1999. I was in London, for my studies (i am from Greece) living in a nice
basement of a wonderful old building. Before that though i had to live
for almost two months in a horribly small hotel room. The house had a very
tall door, and above that door a small window. One night i was writing
things in my notebook for some time, then i looked up at the window and
saw myself.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was me, however i
looked different, this can be called a doppelganger, at the time I didn’t
know the term. I had longer hair that i had back then, and a malignant
smile. What horrified me the most however was the thought that that thing,
whose face was seen in the window, should have had a gigantic body to be
able to reach to that point, that thought was by far the scariest.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>my room is the only place
that you can see or feel a ghost in my house. when I was about seven I
woke up in the middle of the night during the summer. My throat was dry,
so I got a drink, and when I got back in bed I saw a women walk in my room.&nbsp;
She set her hand on my desk and just stood they’re staring at me. She was
older (looked about 50) short, and thin. She was warring a dirty white
nightgown. I screamed and she turned around and walked away. My parents
woke up and ran in, they just told me I was dreaming. When I got older,
and my friends started sleeping over she started opening and closing my
door. it would open a little, close, open a little more, close, open a
little more, until it was all the way open and then quickly shut. Then
a little earlier this year, during the end of the summer, I would be sitting
at my computer on the internet, and I would feel like someone was rubbing
my neck and shoulders. This happens often. Then I found out who the ghost
was. I was talking to my neighbor, she has been living here all her life,
and she told me that the couple who lived here a while before us was Harold
and Mildred Hyde. Harold died in a nursing home, but Mildred died of cancer,
and died in my room. She was a short and sorta husky woman, but when she
had cancer she got real thin. Both me and my neighbor thought this was
weird, because I was able to describe a person who I had never seen, and
died at least 5-10 tears before I was even born. She never went away, I
still get my shoulders rubbed, and many of my friends now believe in ghosts.
I don’t care if you believe in ghosts or not, but I know they're real.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Well, it all began when
I was little. I have always seen stuff that I didn't know how to explain
to anyone. At the house I was raised in till I was 14, I would always see
this foggy figure either peeking around the doorway or standing over me
while I slept. I felt like it was a man and it was just protecting me.
I had no problem with it but then again I never was scared of it. Sometimes
I would look out the window and see a man's face that scared me to death
and I would run into the bathroom, which had no windows, and lock the door.
Mom thought I was doing it for attention, I only wish that is what I was
doing. I was asleep once in my bro's room and looked out the window and
saw a dark figure walk across the yard. I never slept in that room again.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Later on we moved and
I didn't have none of these sightings. We moved into a brand new house
and I figure that is why I never saw anything.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Well, things changed
in my life and I ended up having to move in with my aunt. I was watching
tv one night and I saw a person. I thought it was my cousin because he
was the same height and i just assumed it was him. He kept staring at me
and I said, "do you want to watch tv or what?" He just stood there looking
at me. So I went to bed. When I awoke I went down stairs with my son and
I noticed that my cousin was asleep in the bed with my grandma. That day
when he went to school I asked my grandma how long he had been in there
and if he had gotten up. She said he was in there all night long. They
do have a 10 oclock bed time so I wasnt for sure if he got up without her
knowing. So, of course, I asked him about it. He looked at me and said,
"you saw him." His eyes were all big when he had said that. I asked him
who he was talking about and he said it was his stepdads grandpa. He went
on to tell me that he has seen it a million times and no one had believed
him.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The next time I saw anything
in that house was when I was downstairs talking on the phone to my b/f.
When I am on the phone I just stare straight off at nothing really. But
I was looking into my grandma's bedroom. I saw something foggy and rectangular
go across the room real fast. I told my b/f to just keep talking to me
because I wanted to put it out of my mind. Never the less I couldn't sleep
down there.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Now that was months ago
and I am married and living with my husband. I will be talking to my husband
before going to sleep and see someone in the doorway just looking at me.
I feel very umcomfortable and make my husband put on the closet and bathroom
light. I hate the hallway here. I have never seen anything but I feel someone
behind me all the time in the hallway. Last night I was trying to get my
son to sleep and I looked into the bathroom and there was a little girl
looking at me with no look on her face. I couldn't help but keep staring
at her. All of a sudden out of nowhere I yelled, "NO!" real loud. It woke
up my husband and he was like no what. I told him I had no clue why I had
said that. And I still don't. I felt like in a way she must have been telling
me something. Maybe telepathically or something but I have no clue why
I would have said no. None the less I have to go to sleep tonight and know
that there is something there. And, of course, my husband is going to l</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>If you are wondering,
yes I have done the whole telling them they are dead and to go away and
to tell them that I am their power source and all that stuff. I have found
nothing that makes them go away. So I just live my life trying to ignore
them. But how long can I do that?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My name is Lateah . I
live in Georiga. Folks around have talked for years about a place called
Devil's Kitchen and and old dirt road. I never believed any of these stories
about the lost souls of the children of the town....until I moved five
miles from the woods called Devil's Kitchen. But that Kitchen is not my
problem, unless I try to visit the woods. The problem is the old dirt road
behind my house. That road is said to hold the souls of two murrdered teenage
girls.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Okay my problem is at
night time (when the girls were supposed to be killed) in my house I see
shadows of what looks to female figures, in dresses. When I see them I
also hear voices of females. Sometimes they just talk other times they
are screaming as if they are affraid of something. So far the ghost haven't
been harmful, just annoying. Besides unlocking my front door, the only
other thing they do is take my daughter's things from her. ( My daughter
is only one and a half.) She often wakes up in sweats and screams then
ends up sleeping in my bed.&nbsp; The things they have took from her is
her cloths, blankets, and what ever stuffed animal she is sleeping with.
The one time they took her p.j.'s, the ones with the feet sewn in and have
the zipper from the chest down the leg, they were took off and placed neatly
folded in the middle of her bedroom floor.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This story is not really

kind of story!</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Back in May of 2002 we
lost an eight month old kitten named AJ. He died when he scooted outside
on us unsuspectidly and was hit by a car that was traveling rather quickly
down our quiet street. We rushed AJ to the vets but he had internal bleeding
and ended up succuming to his injuries.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I was heart broken and
it took me at least a month to get over AJ's death. In September of 2002,
four months after we had lost AJ, I awoke out of a peaceful sleep around
three in the morning to hear a cat scratching at my bedroom door. We have
other cats so I assume that it was one of them scratching to get in. Staggering
out of my bed and trying not to bump into things seeing that I was half
asleep, I opened the door to let in one of the cats. Now usually when one
of our cats scratches to get in, either they will jump up on the bed or
they will jump up onto the window, it is either one or the other. Well,
this didn't happen and I started to forget about it as I climbed back into
bed and tried to fall back asleep.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My eyes snapped open when
I heard the cat meow. From the position where the meow came from I could
tell whoever it was was sitting right beside the bed looking up at me.
I instantly recognized that meow and I knew that it belonged to AJ. He
had a very unique meow because apparently when he was born there was fluid
or something that got stuck in his throat and damaged his vocal cords.
So AJ always had a very soft meow, probably one of the sweetest sounds
you could ever hear. Seeing that I was half asleep, I guessed that I was
hearing things and that maybe it had been AJ's brother Bobby who was meowing
at me. (However, Bobby doesn't have a soft meow, infact, you can hear him
meowing from up the street sometimes!) I started to fall back asleep again
when I once again heard that distinctive, sweet meow and felt the cat jump
onto the bed and walk around to the other side of me to where I had my
back facing them. My heart began to beat faster when I heard the cat get
closer to me and I k</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Very slowly, I began to
turn so I could possibly see something. In a very soft voice I whispered
"AJ?" The cat meowed once more and then was gone. I could no longer feel
him sitting beside me and if it had been one of the other cats I would
have felt them walk around to the other side of the bed and I would have
heard them jump off of the bed. But none of that happened.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Of course when I mentioned
it to the others in our house the following day none of them believed me
and told me that I was probably dreaming. I know that I was wide awake
when this all happened and I know that it was AJ coming back to visit,
possibly a gift a from God to help me get over loosing our sweet little
AJ! I still miss AJ but it is nice to know that he is still alive and that
he still has his sweet little meow over on the other side!</FONT></FONT></B>

Hey guys,</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>For many people the question
is ''Are ghost's real?''. I can answer that. When I was 5 I was taking
a bath. It was an ordenary night with my mother susan and my younger brother
Walter. I started to wash my hair and I heard a noise. I sat up and heard
it again. The noise was someone calling my name. It wasn't like someone
I knew was, because it was a mans voice. Deep yet soft, It sounded like
it wanted something. Ignoring the voice I sat there thinking what was going
on. I kept staring at the nozel to turn the water on for no aparent reson.
Then I felt a rush of cold water on my feet and looked at the nozel which
was on the cold side of the wall. Scared I jumped up only to feel somthing
pulling my hair and acolden wind staing on my neck for 3 minutes. Panting
I heard the voice again saying ''Where's your mom?''. I jumped out of the
bath tub and ran to my mother. The scary part is My Grandfather had died
a week before.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the middle of October,
my friends and I were talking about different ghosts stories we've heard.&nbsp;
Some of them were good but most were boring.&nbsp; We decided to have a
little fun ourselves by making a movie about a phantom.&nbsp; As our setting
we decided to use Old State Road in Cayce, SC.&nbsp; So we got in some
costumes, rounded up the video camera, and loaded up into the truck on
our way to Old State Road.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; Old State Road
was the road that the confederate soldiers and union soldiers used during
the Civil Road.&nbsp; Somewhere along the road the two sides met.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; We decided to
film part of the movie in an old cemetery that is about 200 yards off the
main road.&nbsp; We got out of the truck and it took us only about 30 minutes
to film the scene.&nbsp; Nothing happened.&nbsp; We didn't hear any strange
noises or see any apparitions so we thought everything was just fine.&nbsp;
We decided to film another scene.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; We drove back
down the road and found a clearing that we could use.&nbsp; We got out
of the truck and filmed a great looking scene that took only a second to
shoot.&nbsp; We cut off the camera and started to walk back to the truck
when we heard this sinister laugh.&nbsp; The laugh was high pitched and
it reminded me of an evil clown laughing.&nbsp; I know that seems odd but
that’s what it sounded like.&nbsp; The laugh was coming from the bushes
just to the left of us.&nbsp; We looked in the direction of the laugh but
could not see anything.&nbsp; We heard it again, but this time it was louder
and you could tell it was getting closer.&nbsp; We all then proceeded to
run like little girls back to the truck.&nbsp; I could still hear the laugh
behind me.&nbsp; I could have swore that something or someone was chasing
us.&nbsp; I wanted to turn around and see what was, but I probably would
fell down.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; We reached the
truck and drove off down the road swearing we would never return.&nbsp;
We told all our friends of the laugh we heard that night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other
people have said that they have heard a similar sound.&nbsp; Some have
even heard faint cries of “help” coming from the woods.&nbsp; Whatever
it was that night, I for one do not want to hear it again.</FONT></FONT></B>

the most southern part on the west side of the Chesapeake Bay. There are
many historical things here, like St. Mary's City, the first city in maryland.
There are many ghost stories as well. The lighthouse in Piney Point is
haunted. But the best place is Point Lookout. Point Lookout is a park that
is the place of an old civial war fort called Fort Lincoln. It's still
standing, and anyone can walk down there from the picnic area. During Halloween,
a thing called a ghost walk is held, where people act out things that happened
there during the civial war. It's very spooky. The lighthouse there is
also only open on Halloween and it is haunted. Well, my aunt was at the
park one afternoon taking pictures. No one was at the picnic area. She
walked down to the fort and was taking pictures. That's when she heard
the voices of men. No one was there but her. The fort always spooks me.</FONT></FONT></B>

waking up and having my room be very cold, even in the middle of July.
Then one night when i was about nine i woke up because i had to use the
bathroom. I went in the bathroom and closed the door. When i opened it
there was a man standing in my room looking out my window. He looked back
at me for a second then back to the window. I went back in the bathroom
and shut the door and locked it and slept on teh floor all night. I slept

never had a reason to believe in ghosts,&nbsp; until now. My wife and I
were staying the night at her parents&nbsp; house. We had just went to
bed, and were arguing over something&nbsp; petty. Anyway, she got up and
grabbed a cigarette and walked into&nbsp; the living room. I stayed in
bed for about 10 more minutes, and&nbsp; decided I would go and ask her
to come back to bed. I got up,&nbsp; walked into the living room and couldn't
find her. The house was&nbsp; dark and it was about 3am. When I couldn't
find her in the living&nbsp; room, I walked into the kitchen, and called
her name a couple of&nbsp; times. Not there. I turned around and saw a
woman in a white&nbsp; nightgown walk from another spare bedroom, cross
the hall, and go&nbsp; into the laundry room. I thought it was my mother-in-law.
I went&nbsp; to the laundry room to see what she was doing up. No one there.
I&nbsp; walked down the hall and looked into their bedroom. Both parents&nbsp;
were asleep. My wife then walked in the front door, she had been&nbsp;
sitting on the front porch.&nbsp; WEIRD.&nbsp; I didn't tell anyone for
a&nbsp; couple of weeks, because I didn't want to scare anybody. I finally&nbsp;
asked my mother-in-law if she had ever seen anything strange, she&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Cushing Hall which you
listed on your site as being haunted seems down rite evil. The building
is officially condemned I think, but the school will not tear it down because
it is so old.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I have personally been
in the building, during the bright sunny part of the day I might add, and
it was atleast ten degrees colder, and while I was there exploring I heard
a noise coming from the second floor and got the heck out of there, I have
also heard that a girl on campus saw the ghost of the man who originally
built the biulding, I would not reccomend the non-adventerous to enter
the building though because one of the teachers here said that the roof
could fall in, lol.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>As for Lilly Hall, I used
to live there and my roomie swears that one night, I think it was the weekend,
I slept on the bottom bunk and she was on the top bunk, she swears she
heard someone breathing and moving on the bottom bunk and thought it was
me, but it wasn't. She also says that at night she heard all of the dorm
room doors close at once, when they were all securely shut. She blamed
all of these strange occurrences on a girl who lived in the dorm and was
murderd near campus in 1984. One of the boys dorms is named for her.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>A girl also reportidly
committed suicide in Lilly as well, A few of the teachers I have asked
have dismissed the claims. I believe it is true though because of the carpet.
The suicide was repotidly very bloody and the carpet taken up. Two of my
friends live in the only dorm room in Lilly with no carpet, so that could
be another explanation for the hauntings.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

They were the only people in the building, which makes this really creepy.

(terrors)...anyway the following night&nbsp; while asleep my wife awoke
me, we both heard very loud snoring, my mother-in-law...was unfortunetly
on holiday with us, so I guessed it was her snoring&nbsp; and I got&nbsp;
out of bed to try to tell her to keep it quiet, as I opened the bedroom
door the snoring stopped...the mother-in-law was asleep but she wasnt snoring?..I
looked in on my children, but yet again not a sound to be heard?........again
I dismissed&nbsp; it,&nbsp; I&nbsp; returned to bed and went back to sleep,&nbsp;
In the morning something even stranger happened...as I awoke I heard a
mans voice GROANING...and the sound came from near my wifes side of the
bed....this time I was scared, my wife nearly Jumped out of her skin!!&nbsp;
obviously nobody else was in the room with us, but the groan definetly
came from within our room....now we all realised something wierd was happening,</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>the rest of the holiday
past quietly except the last evening.....my wife and mother-in-law took
the children to see a kiddies entertainer, I decided to stay in and watch
some T.V.&nbsp; after an hour or so I felt the caravan sway in a motion
as though somebody was&nbsp; walking inside the caravan from my bedroom
to where I was watching T.V.....FORGET&nbsp; the british..(stiff upper
lip)&nbsp; I was out of the door before you could say BOO!.....I&nbsp;
know I can now look back and tell this story with some humour,&nbsp; but
at the time it wasnt so funny,</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>my view about the story
is that the man who originally owned the caravan had loved the place in
life, and had decided to keep a watchfull eye on&nbsp; the visitors, I
hope he approved of me? I&nbsp; certainly didnt at the time approve of
him!!</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When I was growing up
in Quincy, Massachusetts, there was an "unknown" in our house. But he wasn’t
scary. We (us 5 kids) named him Joe the ghost. He was a prankster, opening
locked doors and windows, or closing them when we wanted them open. We
were not afraid at all. I remember when I was 4 or 5,and I was sick. I
tried to call for my mom or my dad to pour me some juice because my cup
was empty. When I looked over, my cup, that I had just finished drinking
out of, was full. Joe liked to make us think we were nuts. My dad was a
neat freak. One week-end, we had to go out of town quickly, and didn`t
have time to clean up before we left. When we got home 3 days later, the
dishes were washed, dried, and put away, the laundry was washed, dried
,folded, and put away, the dogs had been fed, and not by the person that
was supposed to feed them. All of our beds had been made, military style,
you could’ve bounced a quarter on them! Or so we thought. I am 31 now,
and I still believe our house was haunted. It hurt me when they tore the
house down. There is a parking lot there now, and none of the guys that
work across the street that knew us will park in the driveway that is still
there, because it is said that if they park there, their car won’t start
back up until they push it out of "our" parking spot. I miss Joe.</FONT></FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>r.vries11@chello.nl</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I am 37, this happened
in my early twenties. I live in Amsterdam. My boyfriend and I visited a
befriended couple in their house in a neighborhood in Amsterdam called
Betondorp. I knew these people but had never been to their house before.
My boyfriend had been there more often and had tried several times, unsuccessfully,
to fix their gas heater. This wasn't interesting to me: he was forever
fixing peoples TV’s and whatever.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>So we were spending the
evening in their house. I was sitting next to the girl on their couch.
It got late, it was past twelve. I don't drink beer or wine or anything
alcoholic, I don't like it. Just to say I was sober. The girl and I sat
facing the kitchen and the balcony connected to the kitchen. Suddenly I
saw a tall white thing passing and disappearing on the balcony. To be precise,
I wouldn't call it a ghost, but just an unrecognizable thing. It was tall
and perpendicular and white and looked exactly like a human covered with
a white sheet, ridiculously similar to a ghost in a children's book. I
just saw it, quite matter-of-fact, and the girl next to me started simultaneously.
So it wasn't just me! I asked her: Did you see that? She said: Yes. She
was withdrawn, unsurprised and somber, so I didn't push it. Then I ran
to the kitchen and balcony for inspection but couldn't find any explanation
for the apparition. It had passed on, not outside in front of the balcony.
It had not been something blowing in the wind. My boyfriend told me to
hush and not be so excitedly curious, because this wasn't news to the couple
and they didn't feel comfortable in their house.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Indeed, they didn't act
surprised or question me, but tried to ignore it altogether.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Later on, at home, he
told me that the chimney slate (the horizontal slate above the heater,
don't know the English word, the ridge on which you put candles or knick-knacks)
was a gravestone cemented in. He had noticed once when he was lying on
the ground to fix the heater and then looked up at the underside of the
chimney slate. Of course I didn't believe him: he loved telling fantastic
stories. But the next time we visited them I looked and indeed: I saw written
'Hier rust' (Here lies) and the letter F. The rest was cemented into the
wall.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Whatever it was that
I saw, the apparition and the gravestone together make a classic ghost
story.</FONT></FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>With my former boyfriend
I went for a boating trip. We got on board and sat around as the other
people boarded and chatted, moved about the boat. The owner had a nice
little dog which was frolicking about with a similar dog. This wasn't especially
interesting to me, I just assumed it was it's sibling and the ship owner
had two dogs. Later, when we were sailing, I only saw one of the dogs,
so I assumed one of the company had left the ship before we started and
had taken the one dog with him. They had been cute and funny together and
I asked the ship owner where his other dog was. He was quite surprised;
there had never been another dog.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Nobody on board had ever

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Let me start by saying
that I absolutely love your site. My sister told me about it, and since
then, both her and I have been hooked.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My father passed away
in Dec of 99. My family had no idea he was ill until a couple of days before
he actually passed. The family flew to where him and my mother were, and
stayed with him. He became extremely ill, and was placed in ICU with about
48 hours to live. My mother never left his side for a second, except for
once. That once, I happened to be in there alone with him. He took off
his breathing mask, told me he loved me, and then looked towards the end
of his bed, and cringed. Almost as if he was seeing something that I couldn’t.
Not seconds later, he was gone. I went hysterical, and started running
towards the waiting room, where the rest of my family was…. A few minutes
later, I was sitting in the waiting room, with a&nbsp; counselor on my
left, and my parent’s pastor on my right. They were trying to comfort me,
and told me that if I needed to talk about what I had just seen, they were
there. It was at that moment, that I happened to look up from my lap (
where I had been staring for the past 20 minutes ), to see my dad standing
in the doorway looking at me…. He wasn’t transparent, he wasn’t floating,
it was him. He smiled, one of those strong, comforting smiles that only
a dad has, and then turned to walk away. I knew at that moment, that I
had been given a gift. I have had many experiences with the paranormal
in my life, going back as far as I can remember. But none so moving or
profound as when my father came to say one last goodbye to me. It was incredible.
Thank you for letting my share my experience. It was something that changed
my life forever, and I hope that everyone out there knows that there is
a reason for everything. Good or bad, there is a reason.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Every time I&nbsp; tell
this story, I experience goose bumps.&nbsp; I have never had an experience
with ghosts until I lived in Jacksonville, Florida. Up until then, I just
had an open mind and enjoyed others telling their experiences to me.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>We were a young newly
wed couple who were living with my husband's grandmother. My then husband
had been gifted the house and had added three rooms to the existing home.&nbsp;
At what point I was made aware that the home had been the scene of a murder-suicide
I am not certain.&nbsp; I recall seeing the old fashioned heavy window
with the bullet holes still there.&nbsp; Grandma had said it would be too
expensive to switch out as it was a unique size.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Instead the new addition
had a new wall that ended up covering the window. All I knew was that the
wife&nbsp; had been shot as she was coming inside the house through the
kitchen.&nbsp; (This is where the addition was built).&nbsp; After the
husband murdered his wife, he shot himself in the living room. My grandma
said they had bought that house because it was a low price perhaps due
to its history.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Everything was fine,
I was happy and I enjoyed my life there until our marriage started to go
bad.&nbsp; I think it was our sad marriage that started this very frightening
experience for us.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Our grandmother had gone
out of town for a few days.&nbsp; She was a very active elderly lady with
a wonderful laugh and healthy spring to her walk. Anyhow she was not due
back till&nbsp; Monday.&nbsp; I recall gradually waking up to noises in
the living room. ( I forgot to mention our bedroom was in the new addition,
as was our den.)&nbsp; The noises I heard were similar to heavy objects
being dragged around on the floor. Heavy movement, like furniture being
moved.&nbsp; It was about 4:30 or so in the morning.&nbsp; I remember thinking</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Grandma is home!" I
foolishly thought she was up and around rearranging furniture.&nbsp; She
was a very active woman and I thought she might be doing work as she always
was doing things.&nbsp; Now I realize how ridiculous my reasoning was.&nbsp;
I was desperate to explain the noises, what else could it be?&nbsp; I lay
in bed thinking it was Grandma and then it I started realizing it could
not be. It did not make sense.&nbsp; What happened next scared me the most.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>(Our bedroom door opened
the den, which had an aquarium with a bright lite.)</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The next thing that happened
was the doorknob to our bedroom started turning furiously. I closed my
eyes and really started panicking. I forced myself to look at the floor
where the light shone through. Perhaps I might see a shadow of the person
trying to come in. I had difficulty raising my voice enough to wake my
husband.&nbsp; He finally woke up and I stupidly whispered "I think Grandma
is home "&nbsp; He was hearing the furniture? Being moved to and fro on
a wooden floor but we had carpet in the house.&nbsp; He was as wide eyed
as I was.&nbsp; We lay there listening to the doorknob and the moving noises.&nbsp;
He started to reach for the samurai sword he kept beside the bed. As soon
as his feet touched the floor all the noises stopped! He asked that I stay
in the room until he checked the whole house and I said no way I was going
with him.&nbsp; We checked all windows and doors, all of them were locked.
He went up to the attic and no one was there.&nbsp; He went through each
closet and room checking everywhere one could possibly hide.&nbsp; It was
strange that the dog who barked at anything did not even wake up until
he touched her.&nbsp; I was so terrified and we had no explanation for
what we had gone through.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When grandma came home
later that day we told her our story. She said it was probably our bachelor
neighbor next door moving stuff around or perhaps an earthquake!&nbsp;
We discounted all her theories as impossible.&nbsp; She said she had never
experienced anything similar to what we&nbsp; had gone through and she
had lived alone for a long time before we moved in. I never experienced
anything in there and once we divorced I moved back to Texas.&nbsp; I don't
know who lives there now as it has been almost 10 years and I have no contact
with my "grandma".&nbsp; I wish I would have delved into it further. I
think the unhappy marriage stirred up the forces and caused that scary
episode.&nbsp; I have not had&nbsp; any other experience like that and
I hope I never do again.</FONT></FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>But here's my story:</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I've always been interested
in the paranormal. If I could spend the rest of my life-researching ghosts,
I'd be the happiest person alive. I was at first more interested because
I had never experienced anything "unusual" or paranormal except that nauseous
feeling I get whenever I visit the Alamo, or other places that I know are
haunted.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>About 2 years ago, my
family moved into a brand new house. After we lived there for about 6 months,
I started hearing voices in the middle of the night. It would be around
2 in the morning and I'd be awake watching a movie.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I would hear a man and
a woman having a conversation coming from the office(which is right next
to my room). This is about the time I'd get pretty scared and turn off
the movie and turn on the light by my bed. I would get out of bed and walk
around to see if anyone else was watching tv, or look outside to see if
the neighbors were yelling. Everything would be completely still. It was
pretty scary, the first few times, but after a few months of it happening
it didn't bother me anymore. There have been times I'm sitting at my desk,
and my door starts opening or closing all by itself, or I see a dark shadow
cross in the hallway outside my room. But the far-most scary time has been
the time I came home from a day at the beach and was all alone in the house.
It was only about 7 at night and I was getting undressed in the bathroom.
I heard a baby cry loud and clear. It seemed to be coming from the room
right next to mine. This scared the crap out of me. I ran out of the bathroom
to see what was going on and looked out the window to see if anyone by
chance had a baby outside (no one on my street has a baby). Everything
was quiet and still.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>So I've tried to look
for an answer to why this would happen and I can't find one. No one has
ever lived in the house before us. No one in our immediate family has died.
I can't possibly imagine what it is. Sometimes I just might think it's
just my imagination running frantically wild. No one else in my family
has heard or experienced anything, or at least they haven't ever brought
it up. I'm only 17 years old, but I know exactly what I've heard and seen.
My mother gets really freaked out when I tell her about these things, and
insists on getting a parapsychologist to come check everything out, but
I don't feel its necessary. Sometimes it makes me feel better knowing that
I'm not always alone.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Anyways, thanks for listening
to my story and please let me know if you have any ideas for the haunting,
whether I be crazy and insane or if there really is an explanation.</FONT></FONT></B>

a "ghost" before.&nbsp; I have heard peculiar noises at a supposed haunted
house of a friend, but that is it.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
few years ago I started seeing this guy.&nbsp; The first time I went into
his apartment, it was freezing cold and it felt kind of odd.&nbsp; Defiantly
not warm and cozy...defiantly very, very cold.&nbsp; I thought maybe the
heat was broken, but they said it was on...it just didn't work.&nbsp; I
was in the bathroom one night and started to feel like I was out of my
body.&nbsp; I heard some banging noises, threw open the door and all was
quite.&nbsp; I asked them what the hell that was and my boyfriends roommate
joked it was the ghost.&nbsp; I half thought he was kidding and half not.&nbsp;
Supposedly, his blinds would open and shut throughout the course of the
night and my boyfriend’s window would open by itself.&nbsp; So a month
had pass with no incident except the coldness and strange noise.&nbsp;
Until my friend who was dating my boyfriends roommate woke up one morning
and the Kermit the frog that was on top of the Christmas tree was now on
the t.v.&nbsp; Around that time...I was sleeping next to my boyfriend and
experienced the window opening.&nbsp; It must have been about 2 or 3am
and I heard a really loud bang....I jumped up and it was as if someone
had thrown the window open.&nbsp; My boyfriend says to me..."oh just relax,
it's only the window".&nbsp; Well, I felt as if I was out of my body again...so
I know it was more than that.&nbsp; I decided to no longer sleep there....</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However...we went to his apartment one afternoon to grab some clothes for
him.&nbsp; I was standing with my back against the wall and he was squating
down in the closet.&nbsp; Out of nowhere, I saw what looked like a white
baseball fly across the room and land in the closet.&nbsp; I thought he
was messing around with me and was about to say something when he looked
up and said..."stop playing like that!".&nbsp; So we looked for the ball
and it was not anywhere in the closet.&nbsp; That was my first and last
experience with anything that I would consider to be a ghost.&nbsp; We
are now broken up and he got evicted from the apartment.&nbsp; Hehe...</FONT></FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>This experience happened
to me when I was 10.&nbsp; We lived near a creek and it had some-what of
a forest next to it. Since I come from a Wicca family, I would have gatherings
in there. One night, before one of my gatherings, my mother told me to
be careful because she had been seeing hooded men in the so-called forest.
I had been seeing them too and they scared me to death. So I left. I was
the first one at the gathering site so I decided to wait and read a book
under a tree. As soon as I sat down I heard footsteps. They were going
in circles around me but I couldn't see anything. All of a sudden I see
one of the hooded men walking towards me. I asked what he wanted but he
didn’t answer and he just stopped in the middle of the gathering site.
He disappeared in a foggy mist right before me. That scared me so bad that
I climbed a tree and waited for the for the other people who were meeting
me there. The second experience happened in my room when I was 13(lucky
13).I was asleep and I felt something tickling my feet. So I turned around
and scratched my foot ignoring the tickling. Then I felt something pinching
my thighs. I opened my eyes and saw a small black figure ( I am an only
child so it couldn’t have been a sibling). I tried to scream but nothing
came out. The figure then sat at the foot of my bed and stared at me. It
disappeared ten minutes after that. The same figure showed up again in
my room. I woke up to someone pinching my thighs again. This time I told
it to stop and it never bothered me again....until now :P Well, I guess
when I can remember the rest of my experiences then I'll send them in.
good bye for now.</FONT></FONT></B>

About 16 years ago my great grand-mother passed away. She was in her mid-nineties
but still lived alone in a fastidious little tract house in St. Louis,
Mo. At the time, her daughter (my grandmother) was fighting a losing battle
with cancer and had arranged for someone to deliver her mother groceries
once a week. One day she fell, broke her hip, and not being able to move,
eventually died. When she was discovered, the medical examiner felt she
had passed several days before she was found by the person bringing her
groceries.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The family all lived out of town and all came in for her funeral. I, my
husband (now ex), and our very young daughter were given the keys to her
house and told we could stay there to avoid having to pay for a hotel room.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We arrived after dark, and since I felt a little creepy about being there,
we decided to pull a sofa in from the living room for my husband while
my daughter and I shared the small bed. As soon as the sofa was moved we
began hearing the sound of something brushing against a window, not loud
at first, but as we got settled in the noise grew. At first it seemed to
be coming from the kitchen, then as the sound grew steadily louder, it
also seemed to be moving from room to room. Then it came up from the basement,
as if something was banging around. We lasted about ten to 15 minutes from
the time it started! The noise was far to loud to allow sleep, not to mention
that we were both quite scared, so we went to share a hotel room with another
reletive.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next day we returned to see if we could figure more natural reasons
for the noise, but found nothing. No trees or bushes that could have been
brushing against the windows; nothing in the basement, cobwebs tight over
the little half windows down there. The gas was turned off, so no way for
the furnace to making any noise. We moved the sofa back and left.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As soon as it began, I knew it was my great-grandmother, and felt she was
upset that we moved her furniture. Her little home was her universe, everything
in it's place. And due particularly to the way she passed, I'm fairly sure
she didn't even realize she had died.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I've often wondered what happened with that house, whether other people
moved in and felt, or heard, her presence, but I live far and have never
had the opportunity to find out.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>On N 2nd W, our home in
Riverton, Wyoming was a beautiful place to grow up.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was directly across
the street from Ashgrove elementary school. We had&nbsp; wild strawberries
and rhubarb along with Mom's garden. An acre of apple trees,&nbsp; weeping
willows, wild roses, rolling lawn, natural hide-outs for myself and&nbsp;
my two sisters. A real wonderland.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The house itself sits
in the middle of the property and is obscured by the&nbsp; snowy boughs
in the winter and the lilacs in the summer all but the diamond&nbsp; window
of the attic. I hadn't heard the stories when I was a little girl and when
I was afraid, I thought it was all part of growing up. I could always reason
away my fears or at least bury them and move forward. I was always a little
ill at ease if I had to be alone in the house. The basement and the bedroom
I shared with my sister were avoided at great lengths during hide-and-seek,
or the occasions when I was home alone. Hell, if you hid in the basement,
you won by default- it was an unspoken rule.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Our bedroom was very
big - longer than it was wide with a large bay window at&nbsp; one end
that looked across the back lawn. The stairs to the basement were just
outside our bedroom door. We had an old fashioned furnace in the bedroom
with a blue flickering flame that sputtered on and off throughout the night.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I remember being very
sick once and looking down from my sick bed, through feverish eyes, I saw
my baby doll rocking itself in our small rocking chair.&nbsp; I don't even
recall if I told my mother because I handled it in the same fashion I always
did, I froze, choked, closed my eyes and waited for it to go&nbsp; away.
Afterward I chalked it up to the fever.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>But this one I could never
reason away. This one involves TWO little girls literally petrified by
what they witnessed. I am nearly forty years old and my older sister, the
other little witness is forty-two. To this day, telling the tale brings
tears to my eyes.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>For Christmas, my grandmother
hand made each of her granddaughters a stuffed monkey doll. My eldest sister
had a black monkey but the other two monkeys were identically green. They
resembled the organ grinder monkeys; bodies about a foot tall, long gangly
legs and arms, and a long curled tail. They wore little ornate vests.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My sister and I had bunk
beds with the foot of the bed at the big window so&nbsp; we could look
across the beautiful lawn as we drifted off to sleep.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was a crisp moonlit
night. I had been asleep on the top bunk when I was suddenly awake and
didn't know why. As I became fully conscious my attention was drawn to
the shadows on the wall. My skin began to prick and my mind raced to its
defensive mode of reasoning. The shadows were the trees in the moonlight
- no, it was definitely the monkeys. Hand in hand, their shadows danced
on the wall. Then it must be my sister (why am I awake, why am I seeing
this, if its her, where are her arms holding them up, this is crazy…).</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Jenny", I whispered.
In the middle of the night for no reason, my sister was apparently awake
as well - "Ruth", she whispered back. I could hear the choke in her throat
and I knew she was seeing what I was seeing, concluding what</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I'd concluded.&nbsp;
We lay in bed weeping, me up top, she down below.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>There are other incidents
related to this house that I would save for another day. I have since heard
stories about the house but never bothered to verify.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Our bedroom, in fact,
used to be the entire house; a log cabin built by one of the first homesteaders.
The rest of the house was built around this. But the story I heard was
that of a woman who had lived in this house, went crazy, and hanged herself
in what we called the "music room". I have no idea, probably nonsense…
there I go again.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Hello. My name is Justin
Garcia. I have some experiences that occurred this summer while I was a
camp counselor at Villanova University in Villanova, Pennsylvania. The
name of the building we were staying in was ALUMNI HALL. Alumni Hall was
a hospital during the Civil War, which is now a dorm. Anyways, one night
at 3:13 AM, I was lying on my bed watching TV when I heard a woman's voice
whisper my name (Justin). I thought it was a female counselor, so I answered
the voice and, as my bed was right beside my door, looked out the door
to see who was calling me. No one was there! My room was at the very end
of the hall and from my doorway, I had a clear view down the entire hall.
No one was there. I kept this story secret from the kids attending the
camp, as I would have been fired for scaring the kids if I told them about
this.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Yet, exactly one week
later, one of the kids in my group told me that around 3:30 AM he heard
a woman calling his name while in bed! In addition, two weeks after this
event occurred, the camp supervisor claimed that she heard a woman's voice
whisper her name at around 3:15 AM as she lay in bed. I told these stories
to the campus security guards, and one of them (also named Justin) swears
that after the semester ended last May and all the students had gone home,
he was in Alumni Hall on the 3rd floor doing his routine patrol tour of
the building when he heard a woman's voice call his name from the other
end of the hallway. The guard was the only person in the building at the
time, as the dorm was locked and he had used his keys to enter.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition,
the ruckus of furniture being violently moved&nbsp; upstairs was heard
by many counselors and students on the third floor. However, directly above
the third floor is the attic, and the attic remains locked at all times!
I have several more stories of things that occurred this summer, but to
save space I will send them some other time.</FONT></FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>DEVKAANN@aol.com</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>For the last 6 months,
I've worked in a stand alone, one floor office building in an area just
north of Atlanta.&nbsp; I've had isolated experiences at work before, but
a pattern seems to be developing here.&nbsp; My office faces a parking
lot.&nbsp; The outside wall is composed of large panes of glass so I can
see directly into the parking lot.&nbsp; As I am sitting at my desk working
on my computer, I am facing the glass wall.&nbsp; About 2 months ago, I
was at the computer with a co-worker standing by me.&nbsp; I looked up
and saw 4 or 5 people looking in from the glass pane.&nbsp; It was like
when you stand in front of a window and see your reflection.&nbsp; I could
make out a man and woman in the forefront, with 2 or 3 other people behind
them.&nbsp; The images caught me by surprise, and I gasped.&nbsp; My co-worker
asked me what was wrong.&nbsp; I turned to look him for a second and then
turned back to the window.&nbsp; The images had vanished in that split
second.&nbsp; I asked him if he saw that.&nbsp; He said "saw what?", so
I said never mind and dropped it.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The next experience was
last week.&nbsp; I walked out of my office to my assistant's cube.&nbsp;
I was gone for about 30 seconds.&nbsp; Her cube is situated where I can
see anyone entering or leaving my office.&nbsp; No one entered the office
while I was out of it.&nbsp; I walked back in the office to find my keyboard
stand and desk chair pulled out into the middle of the office floor.&nbsp;
I had left the stand and chair directly in front of the computer.&nbsp;
I asked our computer tech if he'd been in the office to make sure.&nbsp;
He replied that he had not.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The final experience,
thus far, was a few days afterward.&nbsp; My office door is locked during
the night.&nbsp; My assistant unlocks it in the morning and then closes
it.&nbsp; I came in the morning and opened the door to the office.&nbsp;
I have a large board handing on the wall.&nbsp; It's the kind that you
write on with markers.&nbsp; A man's face had been drawn on the board.&nbsp;
It looked rather bizarre to me.&nbsp; I called my assistant in and asked
if she had drawn the face.&nbsp; She got a disturbed look on her face.&nbsp;
She said that she had been in the office writing some things on the board
that morning.&nbsp; She had last been in there 5 minutes before I walked
in.&nbsp; No one had entered the office that morning other than her….and
the face had not been on the board when she was in there.&nbsp; She then
said the face was evil, and she'd never draw anything like that.&nbsp;
The best way to describe the face is that it looked like a really pissed
off guy.&nbsp; My assistant has been wearing a cross to work since then.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>One last bit of info about
this.&nbsp; I was telling another co-worker about the experiences this
week.&nbsp; She was actually receptive to it.&nbsp; I've seen, heard, and
felt so much in my life that I don't have any doubts about the existence
of the paranormal, so I've fairly open about it all.&nbsp; That plus the
fact that I don't much care if anyone else believes it or not.&nbsp; Anyway,
the next day, this co-worker told me that she and her son were in her car
that night.&nbsp; It suddenly became freezing cold, and she felt something
blowing on the back of her neck.&nbsp; I didn't experience it, so I can't
say if my tale got her worked up or it really happened.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The building if fairly
new.&nbsp; However, I suspect the land itself holds a lot of history.&nbsp;
There were a lot of plantations in the area at one time.&nbsp; It was also
a hotbed for Klan activity, so that may be where the happenings originate.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Ma, Dad, Robin, Lynda,
and I lived in a very old house in Burbank. Strange things happened there
all the time. First, there were strange noises coming from the bathroom
at night. Ma said "Mice". We didn't believe it because every time I would
pass the bathroom, a white "thing" would pop out at me. It got to the point
that I would hide my eyes from that doorway, or turn the light on before
I entered. I thought it was just me, but my sister and brother also saw
it. All kinds of weird things were happening. First, it always seemed like
someone was outside the windows looking in. It was a very strong sensation
of this. My brother's foot caught on fire, my thumb was crushed in the
cistern pump, there were marks on the floor and woodwork that wouldn't
come up or they would get cleaned up and come back, etc., etc.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>When my ma remarried,
we were going to move. The day we left, the fire department used the house
as a practice for new firemen. They tried to light this thing up about
five times. When they finally got it going, I looked up into the attic
window and saw that white "thing". My parents never acknowledged any of
this until 40 years later. My mother told me that a woman killed her husband
in that house. Yikes. Later on I was talking to a guy at work and it turned
out it was true because it was his aunt and uncle. I'm a believer.</FONT></FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>bryanoran@sbcglobal.net</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I experienced a first-hand
haunted house during 6 yrs. of my childhood in Harriman, Tn.&nbsp; My Father
moved my family (Mom, Me &amp; 2 brothers) into an old two-story house
(built in 1901) when I was six yrs. old. The house was in pretty sad shape
when we moved in and my Dad started remodeling immediately.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My entire family dealt
with Scary circumstances until (and after) my Dad's death in 1981.&nbsp;
Many occurrences were the usual stuff: Cold spots, strange noises, closing
doors, voices from the other room and upstairs when no one was home. During
the remodeling, a secret room was discovered behind the foyer wall opposite
the door- under the stairs- behind the formal living room (fake) mantel.&nbsp;
We found pennies, old newspapers, and some junk in this room, and later
converted it into a huge storage closet. That closet was the source of
a lot of noises and was always ice-cold.&nbsp; My brothers and I recall
hearing whispering right behind us going up the stairs as well as the stairs
creaking behind us as we ran up or walked up them. When we stopped on the
stairs the steps would creak behind you one at a time up to where you were
standing. The weird part is that they would creak on a different number
of steps in variation and go different directions each time. All members
of the family experienced "the Watcher" (as we called it). When lying in
bed (day or night) You could here the steps start creaking as if someone
was walking up, the door would creak open a little, you would here breathing
behind you, and feel the hair on your whole body stand up with cold chills
and "just know" someone was staring at you. This always happened in the
Master bedroom, which was traded between us after Dad died. My personal
experience was horrifying and kind of neat when I look back...</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>My Father was sick with
cancer when I was 12. My family kept this from me out of concern for my
age.&nbsp; He was terminal.&nbsp; One night, I was sleeping in bed with
my older brother, when I awoke and had wet the bed. I never did this previously
and was not ill.&nbsp; I heard sobbing coming from the dark hallway outside
my open bedroom door. I was changing my underwear and had put an old T-shirt
on the bed over my accident, as instructed by my 17 YR. old brother (he
had fallen back asleep).&nbsp; I was scared , but crept into the dark wooden
hallway to see if the woman's sob was my Mother's. I followed the sound
around the corner to my parent's bedroom door and peered inside. It was
freezing cold .&nbsp; By moonlight shining through 2 windows, I saw an
older woman in a long black dress, Tall collar, wearing a cameo broach,
looking at my father and crying. Her voice sounded distant and she was
not touching the floor, her dress faded into shadow.&nbsp; Her hair was
up in a bunn, and her hand was reaching for my sleeping Dad. I was frozen
with fear and started to whimper; too afraid to cry out. She turned her
head to look at me and had only black pupils in her sad eyes. She was fuzzy
like an old black-n-white film, but definitely there (standing no more
than ten feet from me).&nbsp; I turned and walked quickly ( I was telling
myself to run but for whatever reason, couldn't) I was terrified!! I woke
my brother and he told me to go back to bed. He was aggravated and told
me I was dreaming.&nbsp; A few days later, my Dad checked into Vanderbilt
Hospital(Knoxville), and shortly after died.&nbsp; I was allowed to go
to the hospital to see him one day and when I walked into the room, he
died right in front of me. The nurse didn't know that I was there and covered
his face with a sheet before my family realized I was standing there. A
couple of months later, my Mother was cleaning out my Dad's walk-in closet
when she pulled some old framed pictures out of the back corner. I had
never seen them because A) I wasn't allowed in Dad's closet and B) I was
scared to death of it.&nbsp; One old picture was of a man and woman from
the turn of the century (from their appearance).</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>I screamed and franticly
reminded my Mom of the occurrence I had experienced that night. (I had
told her before and she didn't say anything, and acted like she didn't
know what to think) The woman in the picture was the woman in her and Dad's
room that night! My Mom, with hands shaking, told me that&nbsp; this lady
was my Father's grandmother. She had many Grand-children, but favored him
above all the others. She spoiled him and gave him special treatment regularly
as she understood it.&nbsp; She then informed me that she lived in that
same house before the previous owner. The Master bedroom was hers, and
she died of cancer! My father never finished remodeling our house and we
moved out less than a year later. It is now fully restored by new owners
and several yrs. ago, I asked if I could look inside with my Mom. It looked
beautiful but as I walked around the old feeling were there. The new owners
didn't say anything, but I knew it was still there...watching.</FONT></FONT></B>
