<BR><B>Why Were They There?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CelticGoddess@cinci.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>In late December of 2000, my boyfriend, Ryan, and his best friend,
Don, moved into the house that Don had grown up in.&nbsp; Their apartment
was too cramped during their band practices, and Don's father was willing
to make the rent very reasonable.</B>
<BR><B>The house is down the street from a very large and very old cemetery
and directly across from an old canal.&nbsp; The neighborhood is peaceful
and charming, most of the time.</B>
<BR><B>Before they moved in, the had to fix the house up quite a bit, because
the last residents had trashed it so badly.&nbsp; They had ripped up the
carpet, splattered paint on the walls, and replaced all the blinds with
wrapping paper.&nbsp; Naturally, they enlisted my help.</B>
<BR><B>As I drove to their new home for the first time, I experienced very
unsettling feelings as I drove up and parked.&nbsp; The feelings pervaded
the entire time I was in the house.&nbsp; (I grew up in a haunted house,
and have had many other experiences with the supernatural, most of them
positive.&nbsp; I am not one to be easily scared by the supernatural, nor
do I think that because something frightens me that it is automatically
evil.)&nbsp; I decided to ignore the feelings, because no one else seemed
to be bothered.</B>
<BR><B>Ryan and Don settled comfortably into their house, and Don was glad
to be back in his childhood home.&nbsp; I became use to the strange sensations
I would experience all around the house.&nbsp; Even the overwhelming feeling
of being watched when I'd go to my car ceased to bother me.</B>
<BR><B>One night in February, I believe, I was leaving to go back to my
house at around 3:00 A.M.&nbsp; As I fumbled for my keys to unlock my car
door, I could feel someone behind me.&nbsp; Suddenly, I heard 3 loud, stomping
footsteps.&nbsp; Thinking that it was possibly some live person intending
to harm me I whirled around and screamed as loudly as I could.&nbsp; There
was no one there.&nbsp; Ryan, naturally, came running out of the house.&nbsp;
I ran onto the porch and into Ryan's arms.&nbsp; I told him what happened
and started sobbing uncontrollably.&nbsp; I was no longer frightened, but
I felt an overwhelming sense of sadness.</B>
<BR><B>"Whoever that is," I remember saying, "Is very confused.&nbsp; It's
a man, and he needs help.&nbsp; I don't know that he realizes that he is
dead."</B>
<BR><B>Ryan became very thoughtful for a moment, "You know, we are surrounded
by a cemetery.&nbsp; And people have drowned in the canal.&nbsp; Someone
did just a few years ago, but I don't know who it was."</B>
<BR><B>After that, Ryan and I both went back to my place to spend the night.&nbsp;
Don had been visiting his mother.</B>
<BR><B>The next day, we told Don what had happened.&nbsp; He confirmed
that someone had drowned in the canal a few years before, but it was a
young girl.&nbsp; I immediately ruled out the young girl.&nbsp; I knew
this presence was very masculine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don also remembered
that a very nice man who had lived next-door had died suddenly of a heart
attack when Don was a child.&nbsp; That seemed like a more plausible candidate,
but there was the long history of the canal to consider, and the near-by
cemetery.</B>
<BR><B>Don was dumbfounded by the entire situation.&nbsp; "I lived here
for the first 15 years of my life, and nothing out the ordinary happened,"&nbsp;
he reflected for a moment, "Well, there was one time when I had stayed
home from school, and felt someone looking at me, so I turned around and
there was my sister.&nbsp; I said 'Hey Bethany,' and then remembered that
she had gone to school that morning and wasn't going to be home for about
and hour.&nbsp; The apparition disappeared, and at the regular time, she
came home."</B>
<BR><B>"Well," said Ryan, "There was the Fonzie incident, too."&nbsp; Fonzie
is a very friendly, sweet-tempered cat that belonged to Don.&nbsp; Apparently,
when Don and Ryan were working on the house, before they had moved in,
i.e.., the cat was still at their apartment, they had both, on separate
occasions seen Fonzie walking around.</B>
<BR><B>I found both the accounts of these rather strange apparitions a
bit puzzling.&nbsp; I know that sometimes apparitions of the living are
seen, but it is usually when something pivotal is about to happen.&nbsp;
Nothing interesting happened before or after these odd apparitions.&nbsp;
I thought that perhaps some entity was somehow taking the forms of things
that were familiar and loved so as to let them know of its presence without
being threatening.&nbsp; Whatever it was, did not seem to me like it could
have been caused by the same melancholy presence I felt.</B>
<BR><B>Over the next few months, nothing much happened.&nbsp; I brought
two friends of mine, both of whom have had many experiences with the paranormal,
over to the house.&nbsp; One of them didn't get any negative or sad feelings
from the area at all.&nbsp; Another, whom I had not told about the strange
occurrences, was so put off the depressed feeling she got that she wanted
to leave almost as soon as we arrived.</B>
<BR><B>One thing, beyond sensing a spirit, worth mentioning did occur in
those several months.&nbsp; I was asleep on the couch in the living room
while Ryan and Don's band practiced.&nbsp; All of the sudden, Kenny, the
bass player, came running up the stairs.&nbsp; He woke me up.</B>
<BR><B>"Hey, are you alright?" he asked.</B>
<BR><B>"Yeah, why?" I replied sleepily.</B>
<BR><B>"Because we were sure we heard someone come in the front door."</B>
<BR><B>I told him I hadn't heard anything.&nbsp; He proceeded to check
all around the house for the suspected intruder and never found anyone
or anything.</B>
<BR><B>During the summer months, a few torrential down-pours caused Ryan
and Don's basement to flood, nearly destroying a significant portion of
their band equipment.&nbsp; After that incident, they decided to move,
yet again.</B>
<BR><B>One night, while they were in the process of moving out, Ryan found
himself at home alone, again.&nbsp; I was staying at my own place, and
Don was visiting his mother again.&nbsp; In the middle of the night, Ryan
called me in a panic.</B>
<BR><B>"I just had the strangest experience," he told me, "I was asleep
on the couch, when I was wakened by a baby crying.&nbsp; I sat up, and
realized that the noise was coming from Don's room.&nbsp; I looked up and
stared down the hall.&nbsp; All of the sudden, this white, somewhat blurred
figure of a woman came walking out of my room and went into Don's room.&nbsp;
Then I heard a woman shushing the baby."</B>
<BR><B>Ryan was frightened, but he realized that this strange event was
not threatening in any way.&nbsp; We talked about it, and agreed that it
was most likely some sort of residual haunting.&nbsp; Later, Ryan told
Don about the experience, and found at that Don had witnessed the same
event.</B>
<BR><B>Ryan and Don have not lived in that house for a few months now.&nbsp;
We never figured out exactly who the man outside the house was, or who
the woman and the baby were, or what caused the strange apparitions of
Bethany and Fonzie.&nbsp; I only wonder if these things still go on in
the house, and if the current residents have the powers of observation
to notice them.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>What Lies in the Darkness</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Smirk451@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This happened in February 2000 during my junior year of high school.</B>
<BR><B>I was in my bed one night, just staring at the ceiling, waiting
to fall asleep.&nbsp; That night, for some odd reason, I was lying on the
opposite end of the bed.&nbsp; Anyway, I remember seeing the yellow digital
numbers on my TV say 12:40 AM - I remember this detail, because I know
for sure that I was not sleeping.&nbsp; I was fully awake and conscious.&nbsp;
Suddenly, I felt this eerie chill just start to permeate the room... so
cold, so freezing, a wind that was coming from seemingly nowhere because
my window was closed tight as was my door.&nbsp; I had about three layers
of blankets and sheets on me but the cold just seemed to be going right
under them.&nbsp; Immediately, just every hair on the back of my neck was
on standing on end... people use the term "chills going down their spine"
figuratively, but the real thing is not the most pleasant sensation in
the world.&nbsp; Then, I heard this male voice, very sinister in tone,
start laughing, it just echoed and surrounded me... I was terror stricken
at this point.&nbsp; I could feel my heart beating, I closed my eyes, praying
to God frantically that whatever it was would leave.&nbsp; When the voice
subsided, the room returned to normal temperature.&nbsp; I just bolted
out of my room.</B>
<BR><B>I have no idea what it was that visited me that night, but several
times after that, when I was in bed, I had this feeling that someone/something
intangible was watching me.&nbsp; Since then, I have had several psychic
and numerology readings which indicate that I am sensitive to the psyhic
and supernatural... I have had dreams throughout my life which served as
a precursor of good tidings in the future, including my acceptance into
the school I am attending today.&nbsp; As a college freshmen, when I visit
home, I refuse to sleep without the hall light on - call me chicken, but
I don't think I'm quite ready to encounter what lies in the darkness AGAIN.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Way of Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Amy</B><B></B>

<P><B>for these purposes let's just say my name is Amy.</B>
<BR><B>where i come from ghost and the supernatural is kind of the way
of life for my people. we welcome ghost who are family members who have
passes away with open arms, knowing they are here to watch over us. That's
the mentality I've had all my life but when the reality of it is faced
its a different story. I have two unbelievable experiences to tell anyone
who is interested enough to listen. bear in mind this is the first time
I've told strangers about this.</B>
<BR><B>I should say my first ghost experience was when i lost my mom when
i was 16. my mom was the center of my universe and when she did unexceptedly
during child birth it was a shock to me for years to come. (I'm now 23).
two days after her death i was sleeping in her bedroom lying on her side
of the bed. i had been crying myself to sleep and i had this dream. at
least i thought it was a dream because the way it happened its as real
as it could be. in my dream or self conscious state of mind i was lying
in the same position in which i had fallen asleep when i saw mom came in
the room and just stood there watching&nbsp; me sleep. i opened my eyes
in the dream and she very gently kissed me on the cheek and told me not
to cry. i tried to hold on to her so she won't go but she left with me
crying bitterly in my sleep. i woke up immediately after ,smelling her
perform very strongly on the room. i then knew without a doubt my mom visited
me to say goodbye. i wasn't afraid just very sad because she's gone.</B>
<BR><B>my second and very terrifying ghost experience happened a couple
of years later when my grandfather became violently ill with severe heart
problems.i was never close with my grandfather. i loved him but he was
very strict and unable to show any emotions to anyone not even my grandma,
but we all know he loves us in his own way. the hospital that he was admitted
in was a little distance away from the house so we could actually take
food over to him. we all visited him several times a day but he was so
sick he couldn't even talk to us anymore. about a week or so later after
he's been admitted, the whole family went to the hospital to see him but
i remember staying home alone that day. we have a couch in the living room
that sits across from the front door. i ws napping on and off when i heard
someone opening the front door. since it was locked i thought it had to
be one of my family&nbsp; coming home.imagine my surprise when i looked
up and saw my grandfather walked in carring his bag that we used to put
his clothes in when we took him to the hospital. i said hi to him but he
didn't answer just went straight to his room and closed the door. i didn't
know what to think at this point but i remember expecting my family to
burst through the door any second telling me they've brought him home because
he was feeling better. after about 3mins i could hear him moving about
in his room so i went to knock on the door to ask him if he need help with
something but no answer even though i could hear things moving. that didn't
surprise me because he never could talk much. about 15mins later my aunt
burst in the house screaming at the top of her voice that we've lost grandpa.
i thought she meant they lost him when there were coming home so i told
her he's already here and he's in his room. she looked at me as if i was
crazy and told me that grandpa died right around the time he walked into
the house a while ago. i fainted when she said that and up to this day
i can't believe that happened to me. i don't know what to make of it but
it sure scared me for a long long long time.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Walking into a Mass</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: regmath@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Back in the mid 1980's&nbsp; while walking the Erie Canal in central
New York one spring morning I had a unusual experience. As I walked along
I walked into something I could feel but couldnt see. I can only describe
it as walking into a blanket hanging on a clothes line. When I first walked
into the mass.I instinctively threw up arms, waving and kicked my feet
in front of me. When I realized I could&nbsp; step in and out of the mass,
I began to use may hands to trace the shape and height of the mass. My
assesment of the mass was it was a draft horse standing there</B><B></B>

<P><B>Visions</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LokiHL@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>A couple months ago I was with several of my friends in my basement
and we were having fun watching movies and stuff like that. At just about
midnight I stepped outside. I have no clue why I did this. I kinda got
the feeling something was drawing me there. I walked outside and looked
around into my dark backyard. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary except
for a very cold and dark presence I felt. I shuttered and walked back inside.
I told others about my experience but none of them seemed to believe it
was anything out of the ordinary. A couple days after the even I was sitting
at my desk in physics class. I was listening to the teacher when I suddenly
got extremely tired. (yes, I know it is common to get tired in school but
this was a very severe case of sleepiness). Anyway, I started to fall asleep.
I knew I wasnt really dreaming because I could tell I wasn't asleep. I
started to see something. I was suddenly at a it. It was a woman who was
in a flowing white dress. It looked like some kind of wedding dress but
it was not held up by anything...as if there was nothing there but a thin
sheet of cloth. It didn't seem to notice me, but kept walking towards the
spot all of the wind was flowing to in the middle of the ocean. I stopped
and looked at it. Then it made a perfect transition from when it was walking
to looking at me. (almost like it dint stop walking but was not walking
when it looked at me). And then it looked directly into my eyes and said
something I will never forget: "The evil is rising". The word rising was
spoken very loudly. I immediately jumped up back into my physics class.
I was unsure what to make of it and I told my friends about this experience
and still none of them seemed to believe me. I told one of my really good
friends who sits next to me in Latin and she believed me and told me to
try and search this experience. Truly a good friend. Over the past couple
of months I have had half dreams like tha of cars at night. I always think
I see someone or something in the darkened car. The worst vision I see
is of the car across the street in which I see and crumpled figure of a
woman across the steering wheel. She looks as if she has been in a serious
accident and has been killed. She constantly looks at me as if trying to
send into fear in me. It often times works. I still don't know about the
feelings and appearances of evil or sprits but I am still in the learning
stage and investigating to find the answer to my troubles. I will keep
you updated on what I find.</B>

<P><B>Two Small Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Blublublublu1129@cs.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My first ghost experience</B>
<BR><B>We had just gotten done playing video games and decided to go to
bed.&nbsp; Myself and three others, one girl who would be my future Goddaughter,
her aunt, and their younger friend had had enough electronic entertainment
for one night.&nbsp; The younger girl had decided to sleep on the couch,
leaving the rest of us to sleep on the floor (since there wasn't enough
beds in the bedroom to go around).&nbsp; Most everyone was just laying
there, staring at something in the dark or randomly saying something here
and there, getting ready to fall asleep.&nbsp; I stared straight at a digital
clock.&nbsp; Suddnely, a figure had obstructed my view of the clock for
a brief moment.&nbsp; It was then that I said, "Hey guys.&nbsp; Did you
see that?"&nbsp; Soon after, I heard my Goddaught let out a loud scream.&nbsp;
They both claimed to have seen a figure heading toward the kitchen and
we heard a loud clatter of pans hitting the ground.&nbsp; The thing disappeared
and we didn't see it again all night.&nbsp; My Goddaught</B>
<BR><B>The second story</B>
<BR><B>The week I started college, I noticed a change in my dog.&nbsp;
He was acting quite a bit funny, almost sick.&nbsp; Within that week, it
was found that he had slipped a disk in his back and was later put to sleep.&nbsp;
I was emotionally torn for a while as I was, and still am, very much attached
to that dog.&nbsp; After a few months, I decided that even though I really
loved my previous dog, I still did want a companion around and got the
dog I currently have.&nbsp; The morning after we had brought her home,
I felt a weight on my chest.&nbsp; It felt like the size of a dog, about
the same size of the one I had before.&nbsp; I thought it was the new dog,
so I told her to get down.&nbsp; I heard her jump from my chest to the
floor.&nbsp; It was then that I realized it wasn't the new dog, because
my room's door was shut and there was no way she could have gotten in there.&nbsp;
That and the fact that she wasn't anywhere around.&nbsp; At first, I was
a bit spooked, but then I thought, "He's still here."</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Woman</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MessiahOfMetal13@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This first story is rather short and didn't happen to me, I was telling
my</B>
<BR><B>Grandmother about your site and we got on the subject of ghosts
after that</B>
<BR><B>and she told me this story. One day when she was about 10 years
old her and</B>
<BR><B>her family were returning from church, after they came in thorugh
the door</B>
<BR><B>the realized that the light in her brothers bedroom was on, now
her father</B>
<BR><B>was real energy conservative and hated it when lights were left
on. So my</B>
<BR><B>Grandmother went upstairs to go turn the light off, now these were
the old</B>
<BR><B>time lights that had the chain hanging from the fixture, she was
small and</B>
<BR><B>had to climb on the bed to reach it, well she turned the light off
and as</B>
<BR><B>soon as she did she saw a face of a woman with black hair and it
looked as if</B>
<BR><B>half of the woman's face was rotted. She ran down to tell her parents
but</B>
<BR><B>they acted as if they didn't believe her and that she was just seeing
things,</B>
<BR><B>well about 2 years later they moved from the house and one morning
her father</B>
<BR><B>asked her if she remembered the face that she saw, she said yes,
the he told</B>
<BR><B>her that she had described in detail the woman that lived there
before she</B>
<BR><B>had died in that room and was found for around 3 days.</B>

<BR><B>The Watcher</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: blasphemy@angeldustrial.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>the summer i turned 18 and headed off to college, my family moved
to</B>
<BR><B>martinsville, nj...they built a brand new home on land that was
once part of</B>
<BR><B>what my grandfather called, "indian country"...</B>
<BR><B>whenever i would go home for break i never slept very well in that
house...i</B>
<BR><B>always had butterflies in my stomach and couldn't pass out until
the wee</B>
<BR><B>hours of the night, when my eyes just wouldn't stay open anymore....</B>
<BR><B>one day i was sitting in the family room watching t.v....above the
t.v.</B>
<BR><B>there was a 7x8 foot opening into the hallway upstairs....i caught
someone</B>
<BR><B>out of the corner of my eye walking by that opening and into my
sister's</B>
<BR><B>bedroom...immediately i thought it odd....the only other people
who were in</B>
<BR><B>the house were my mother and grandmother, both of whom were to the
left of</B>
<BR><B>me in the kitchen....</B>
<BR><B>when i told them what happened, they just stood there, looking at</B>
<BR><B>eachother...finally my grandmother spoke up....apparantly both her
and my</B>
<BR><B>mother had seen a figure walk by doorways in the house on a number
of</B>
<BR><B>occasions....according to my grandmother the lights flickered every
once in</B>
<BR><B>a while too....she was under the impression the house was haunted...</B>
<BR><B>that night i was lying in bed, reading a book...it was about 4am
and i was</B>
<BR><B>the only one up....i decided to brush my teeth before trying to
get some</B>
<BR><B>sleep...i opened the door to my bedroom and was about to turn left
to go to</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom, when i felt the need to look down the hallway towards
my</B>
<BR><B>mother's room....my mom usually kept her door closed, but that night
the</B>
<BR><B>door was open and there was a man standing in the opening!...he
was tall and</B>
<BR><B>skinny...the only man that was in the house was my stepfather and
he's short</B>
<BR><B>and plump...the figure was just standing there..looking at me...no,
watching</B>
<BR><B>me....i immediately ran into the bathroom, my heart pounding....about
ten</B>
<BR><B>minutes later i got the nerve to run back to my room and hide under
the</B>
<BR><B>covers...needless to say i didn't sleep a wink....</B>
<BR><B>from that night on, i knew that the butterflies in my stomach were
because i</B>
<BR><B>felt someone watching me...although he frightened me like i've never
been</B>
<BR><B>frightened before, and even though i still get the shivers thinking
about</B>
<BR><B>that night, i have always known this ghost was just a watcher...i
didn't</B>
<BR><B>feel any evil or ill will from him...but i have no idea who he was...like
i</B>
<BR><B>said earlier, the land was considered "indian country" ie - it was
wooded</B>
<BR><B>until they cleared it for the new development...so it's possible
the ghost</B>
<BR><B>was an american indian, but for some reason i feel that isn't right..that</B>
<BR><B>this man i saw was in fact white, and possibly a farmer from the
early</B>
<BR><B>1900's...</B>
<BR><B>either way the shadows and flickering of the lights continued until
my</B>
<BR><B>family moved three years later....it's possible they even continue
today,</B>
<BR><B>but i don't think anyone ever saw the man as clearly as i did that
night...</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Roar</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: j_nicoles@yahoo.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>I've been reading through your website and found it</B>
<BR><B>very interesting, but I never thought that I had a</B>
<BR><B>story to relay until I read a story that sounded</B>
<BR><B>extremely like something that happened to me a few</B>
<BR><B>years ago.&nbsp; I live in Toronto Canada and in 1991 my</B>
<BR><B>third child was just a baby and would wake up nightly</B>
<BR><B>around 2:00am for a feeding.&nbsp; At the time we lived in</B>
<BR><B>a condo which we had lived in since 1988.&nbsp; We had some</B>
<BR><B>minor incidents like things moving around and shadows</B>
<BR><B>seen out of the corner of ones eye but nothing to</B>
<BR><B>speak of really, just things that could be chaulked up</B>
<BR><B>to imagination.&nbsp; On one particular night my son having</B>
<BR><B>waken for his feeding, I sat in my rocking chair in</B>
<BR><B>the babys room feeding him.&nbsp; The night light was on</B>
<BR><B>and I was wide awake when all of a sudden I heard what</B>
<BR><B>sounded like a lion or tiger roar, loud and clear.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>jumped up turned on all the lights and convinced that</B>
<BR><B>a tiger was in the closet woke up my husband and had</B>
<BR><B>him search through the entire appartment including the</B>
<BR><B>balcony which was six stories up.&nbsp; Of course it would</B>
<BR><B>have been impossible for an animal to have gotten into</B>
<BR><B>the apartment but the roar had sounded so real I had</B>
<BR><B>to be sure.&nbsp; After that I tried to convince myself</B>
<BR><B>that it was my imagination but I never forgot about</B>
<BR><B>it.&nbsp; I wonder if you know what this could be and if</B>
<BR><B>there is any explanation for it.</B>

<BR><B>THe Little Girl and Grandmother</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have had loads of experiences in my life, almost every day. And
I am only</B>
<BR><B>12 so I do believe in ghosts, and I used to believe in faeries,
but now</B>
<BR><B>they're just...stupid...Anyway, I have experiences just about every
day, and</B>
<BR><B>here are a few of them, some from me, some from my sister Crystal,
some from</B>
<BR><B>my sister Gina.</B>
<BR><B>The first thing that happened to me was recent. You have to understand
how my</B>
<BR><B>room is set up to understand my story. The door is by my bed. When
you walk</B>
<BR><B>in my door you look straight and see the front part of my bed, where
I lay my</B>
<BR><B>head. I know thats still confusing but oh well. I was laying in
bed and I</B>
<BR><B>heard a stomping in the hallway. I figured it was my father, because
he is</B>
<BR><B>always going to the bathroom at night. So as I laid there, the stomping
came</B>
<BR><B>closer to my room, and closer and closer. It finally came into my
doorway,</B>
<BR><B>stopped at the foot of my bed. By now I knew it wasn't my parents
because</B>
<BR><B>they never check on me at night. So after a moment, it started again,
it</B>
<BR><B>stomped through my room over to my TV (which I just recently got
in my room)</B>
<BR><B>and hit it, very very loudly. It almost knocked the TV off of the
stand. I</B>
<BR><B>don't know what it was, I know it was a ghost, but I have quite
a few in my</B>
<BR><B>house. I have a little girl that hides by my closet because she
is afraid,</B>
<BR><B>and I have a grandmother who used to check on my sister Crystal
at night,</B>
<BR><B>when Crystal was my age. I think this was the grandma, but I'm not
sure</B>
<BR><B>because why would she go over and hit my TV?</B>
<BR><B>Another experience is daily. More than daily, it happens every time
you walk</B>
<BR><B>up or down my steps. There is someone or something that stands at
the top of</B>
<BR><B>my stairs, and you can feel them staring at you. I know this, and
it's</B>
<BR><B>happened to my sister. Every time you walk down the stairs you just
want to</B>
<BR><B>run. When my best friend comes over she always pushes me out of
the way and</B>
<BR><B>runs down the steps.</B>
<BR><B>More experiences are that lately I invited faeries into my house.
That was</B>
<BR><B>when I believed in faeries. Now I constantly see flashes of light.</B>
<BR><B>Everywhere, just like a ball of light that flies around. I don't
think it's</B>
<BR><B>faeries, I think it's ghost, like when I invited the faeries the
ghosts came</B>
<BR><B>instead.</B>
<BR><B>Another experience is that there used to be something very evil
in my house,</B>
<BR><B>but we prayed it out. This happened to my sister when she had the
room that</B>
<BR><B>is now mine:</B>
<BR><B>She was lying in bed and heard the closet door open, which happens
to me</B>
<BR><B>often too, I have actually sat there and watch it swing open. But
she covered</B>
<BR><B>her head and prayed. As soon as it stopped, she reached up the wall
and</B>
<BR><B>turned on the light. She walked over to my closet and on it were
claw marks!</B>
<BR><B>Four of them so we knew it couldn't be from my cat, besides Crystal
kept her</B>
<BR><B>door shut so the cat couldn't get in. And my parents have heard
breathing</B>
<BR><B>along with Crystal. Gina, my other sister was holding me when I
was a baby,</B>
<BR><B>and she was crying because I wouldn't stop crying. She was home
alone and</B>
<BR><B>suddenly she heard somebody coming down the steps.</B>
<BR><B>A few years ago I heard giggling in the den which is the room where
we have</B>
<BR><B>our first floor TV and our computer. I constantly feel that somebody
is</B>
<BR><B>staring at me from the living room and from the corner where I heard
the</B>
<BR><B>giggling. I have lots more stories, e-mail me to get them. =)</B>

<BR><B>creeped me out i always felt like somebody was</B>
<BR><B>watching me from the upstairs windows... and as a kid</B>
<BR><B>i never knew what to make of it.. but are neighbor</B>
<BR><B>would always go on vacation in the winter.. and eather</B>
<BR><B>my brother or i who ever he asked first ...would get</B>
<BR><B>payed a dollor a day ...for watering and feeding the</B>
<BR><B>horses... we always kept a key of his over at are</B>
<BR><B>house.. so we could get in.. if the pipes frose in the</B>
<BR><B>winter time...we could run a hose from the basment to</B>
<BR><B>the water troff</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; well one night.... i must have been 11 or 12 years</B>
<BR><B>old... my brother and my cousin brett (who passed away</B>
<BR><B>in a car accident when i was a freshman) but thats</B>
<BR><B>another story, and I were standing in the living room</B>
<BR><B>of the neighbors house..playing pool and listing to</B>
<BR><B>the raideo when all of a sudden the raideo went up</B>
<BR><B>full blast the windows shook violently and then the</B>
<BR><B>raideo shut it self off the three of us kids threw are</B>
<BR><B>sticks on the table and ran as fast as we could</B>
<BR><B>home... witch wasnt far thankgawd. That was the first</B>
<BR><B>in counter.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; the second incounter was when i was in hight</B>
<BR><B>school... nothing really scarry like the first</B>
<BR><B>incounter... i was taking care of the horses... and</B>
<BR><B>every night after practis i would go over there .. and</B>
<BR><B>the all the lights would be on in the house ..upstairs</B>

<BR><B>would go and trun them off.. and go back home... it</B>
<BR><B>happend again the next night... same thing ... same</B>
<BR><B>time so i brought it up to my parents... they told me</B>
<BR><B>that he must have a timer on&nbsp; his lights... so the</B>
<BR><B>next night when i went over there all the lights were</B>
<BR><B>on... and i looked all over for a timer on the</B>
<BR><B>lights.. nothing i didnt find any timer .</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; well that next week he came home.. so i asked him</B>
<BR><B>if he had a timer on the lights...or if somebody was</B>
<BR><B>checking on his house. He said no to both questions ..</B>

<BR><B>house a long time ago...and she didnt like children.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last incounter scared me so bad i haven't been</B>

<P><B>The Braodmoor Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pfraser@spicer.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>On Monday Feb 5,2002&nbsp; I arrived at the Braodmoor hotel in Colorado
Springs</B>
<BR><B>for a three day stay for a seminar that I was attending.&nbsp; I
was traveling</B>
<BR><B>alone and after a long day I checked into the hotel around 8 pm
in the</B>
<BR><B>evening.&nbsp; I dumped my luggage and went out to grab a bite to
eat.&nbsp; When I</B>
<BR><B>arrived back I noticed that my bed had been turned down a 2 chocolates
were</B>
<BR><B>neatly placed on the bed along with a breakfast menu.&nbsp; I got
into my P.J's</B>
<BR><B>and crawled into bed to watch a bit of the tube, around 11 pm hit
the</B>
<BR><B>lights.&nbsp; I pulled the duvet over my shoulder and as I was doing
this I</B>
<BR><B>noticed green reflections in my bed.&nbsp; (Almost like one you
would see when</B>
<BR><B>you watch reflected off the sun but they were green)&nbsp; I paused
for a moment</B>
<BR><B>and then continued tucking myself in.&nbsp; A few minutes later
I felt a presence</B>
<BR><B>in the room.&nbsp; I was laying on my side and the first thing I
thought of was</B>
<BR><B>the person who had turned down my bed was still in the room.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>terrified, I turned onto my back and opened my eyes.&nbsp; The room
was pitch</B>
<BR><B>black.&nbsp; As my eyes focused a little more I noticed that the
room was filled</B>
<BR><B>with a fog.&nbsp; I didn't know what to do.&nbsp; I just laid there.
Stunned still</B>
<BR><B>having this strong feeling that someone was in the room I watched
at this</B>
<BR><B>cloud that was in my room moved around slowly.&nbsp; I laid there
for what felt</B>
<BR><B>like an eternity.&nbsp; All of a sudden I felt like something had
straddled me</B>
<BR><B>while I was lying there.&nbsp; It was something that felt like it
weighed about</B>
<BR><B>25 pds and&nbsp; I don't know if my ears were playing tricks on
me at this point</B>
<BR><B>but it sounded like I could hear the feathers of the duvet press
down.&nbsp; Now</B>
<BR><B>I was really freaking out.&nbsp; Looking over at the curtains I
noticed that they</B>
<BR><B>were swaying like they would if a window was open.&nbsp; (Which
it wasn't)&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>didn't want to move, my heart was going a mile a minute, I knew
that there</B>
<BR><B>was a ghost in my room.&nbsp; I didn't know anything about the hotel
and didn't</B>
<BR><B>really want to call down to the main desk to report that a ghost
was in my</B>
<BR><B>room because I figured they would laugh.&nbsp; I finally got enough
nerve to sit</B>
<BR><B>up and turn my bed side light on.&nbsp; I then out loud said "Look,
I know that</B>
<BR><B>you are in my room and I want you to leave, I am tired and I want
to go to</B>
<BR><B>bed so can you please just leave me alone."&nbsp; I sat there for
about another 5</B>
<BR><B>minutes, trying to gather my thoughts, catch my breath and get enough</B>
<BR><B>courage to turn the light out again.&nbsp; Finally I did, I turned
the light out</B>
<BR><B>and laid back down.&nbsp; Immediately this thing was on top of me
again.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>heart again started beating 1000 miles a minute,&nbsp; I was petrified.&nbsp;
I didn't</B>
<BR><B>want to leave the bed as much as I was scared out of my mind I felt</B>
<BR><B>protected by the covers.&nbsp; The next thing that happened is that
I was laying</B>
<BR><B>there and one of my hands was outside of the covers all of a sudden,
it felt</B>
<BR><B>like something when in my hand.&nbsp; Kind of like a numbness that
you get after</B>
<BR><B>having pins and needles.&nbsp; I quickly turned on my side and tucked
my hands</B>
<BR><B>under the covers.&nbsp; Laying on my side I could not feel the pressure
that I</B>
<BR><B>could when laying on my back.&nbsp; I shut my eyes and didn't open
them again</B>
<BR><B>until I woke up and looked at the clock, it was 1:53 am and the
ghost was</B>
<BR><B>still in the room, I could still feel that it was there.&nbsp; Again
I turned on</B>
<BR><B>my back with my eyes still closed.&nbsp; My mind was racing with
thoughts not</B>
<BR><B>just about what was happening but about work, the seminar that I
was at,</B>
<BR><B>anything and everything, all of a sudden I felt that feeling again
in my</B>
<BR><B>hand which was outside the covers again, the next thing I knew my
mind was</B>
<BR><B>blank.&nbsp; I couldn't process a though, I was trying so hard to
think about</B>
<BR><B>something, anything but it was like I was mentally paralyzed.&nbsp;
This lasted</B>
<BR><B>only for a minute or two and then it was like something was released
and my</B>
<BR><B>mind went back to racing a mile a minute with the same thought patterns
as I</B>
<BR><B>was having before.&nbsp; I didn't know what was happening to me.&nbsp;
I wanted the</B>
<BR><B>morning to come to badly yet it was not even 2 am.&nbsp; I turned
again over to</B>
<BR><B>my side which seamed to be save and fell back asleep.&nbsp; I awoke
again at 6 am</B>
<BR><B>and with still a dark room I knew that what ever was there before
was</B>
<BR><B>gone!!!</B>
<BR><B>The next day I was speaking with a colleague of mine telling him
about my</B>
<BR><B>adventure.&nbsp; After the story was over he asked me what hotel
I was staying at</B>
<BR><B>and I told him "The Braodmoor"&nbsp; He laughed and went on to tell
me that the</B>
<BR><B>hotel is haunted.&nbsp; If he was trying to help calm me down it
wasn't helping.</B>
<BR><B>He then asked me if I was staying on the third floor.&nbsp; With
some hesitation</B>
<BR><B>I said "YES"&nbsp; He went on to tell me that the rumours he had
heard when he</B>
<BR><B>had stayed at the Braodmoor is that most of the stories about the
ghosts had</B>
<BR><B>come from the third floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The weird thing is that I
was staying in the</B>
<BR><B>WEST wing of the hotel and not the main building (which no one was
staying</B>
<BR><B>in because it was being renovated)&nbsp; So I have two more nights
at the hotel</B>
<BR><B>what do I do?&nbsp; I stayed in the same room and slept with the
bathroom light</B>
<BR><B>on for the two remaining nights I had there, they didn't come back
to visit</B>
<BR><B>after my first night which I will never forget!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Black Cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp;&nbsp; emerkt88@msn.com</B>
<BR><B>Around our community there have been many strange mysteries, but
this one tops them all. I live in a country village in Alabama, but not
on a farm(heck no!). One day I was out in my backyard and noticed that
something was moving about 25 yards or less in front of me. I turned to
look and was astonished by what I saw. It was a 5-6 foot long black cat
that looked like a mountain lion. It was not because I live in a region
that doesnt have mountain lions in it. It was black and furry. I dont have
a picture yet but I go outside every day hoping to snap a picture of it.
My next door neighbor said that he saw it too. He said that it crossed
my backyard and into the Woods. If anyone has had any experiences like
this, please send email to emerkt88@msn.com please. Thank you.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp; Description of Haunting: Big logging company logged land
several years</B>
<BR><B>ago,during the rainy season.&nbsp; Their trucks kept</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;falling into holes and getting stuck.&nbsp; One of the</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;neighbors said there were old slave graves on the</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;property. Whatever came out of the graves they fell</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;into scared the loggers into leaving in three days</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;instead of the two weeks they had planned on, logging</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;only one acre out of the planned four acres.&nbsp; Not</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;knowing this, I moved there with four kids.&nbsp; I was outside
praying a</B>
<BR><B>couple of weeks after moving there,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;when something answered, saying, "A cross is just a</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;symbol, it's not me", and told me to ask it into my heart.&nbsp;
I did,</B>
<BR><B>thinking it was the same Jesus I'd</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;been following for years. It told me it would knock</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;a tree onto my head before every storm for a year,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;told my kids I hated them every time they got in</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;trouble. It told me everything the preacher would</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;talk about for years, before he said it. It tried to choke
me at least</B>
<BR><B>twice, for trying to bless the land,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;and for even thinking about calling a Catholic priest.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;It had me hearing voices night and day for a year</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;(its version of the holy war.) I left when it started</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;making me have visions of straight razors, telling me to kill
my husband.</B>
<BR><B>It came with me, drowning me within</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;my sleep, at my moms house for thinking it was gone.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Something told her to wake me at three a.m., and she</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;luckily trusted her gut instinct that told her I needed</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;her. I was baptized with this in me.&nbsp; For years, I've</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;seen it in my childrens eyes, before they do stuff totally
out of</B>
<BR><B>character, like knock 1100 rpm motorcycles with saddlebags over
onto baby</B>
<BR><B>sister,with</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;only a car saving her(a 60 pound girl knocked it over.)</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My son is on every prayer list we know of, and shoots</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;the finger in church occaisionally anyway. He's pulled</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;butcher knives on us since he was three (the same year</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;we left.)We've had 220 electric wires test dead, then</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;shoot sparks when cut.&nbsp; This can mess up anything that</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;has wires, from the car to the washing machine. It's</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;sporadic, messing up guages a mechanic uses to check</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;the radiator, so it tests ok, then pours out water a</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;block later.&nbsp; It can make car fans go when theyre not</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;hooked up and not supposed to. My son, at eleven,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;is in trouble for stealing at home ,at school, and</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;has stolen at least a hundred dollars noone missed.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;He thrashes and tears up paper with his teeth when</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;he gets in trouble, since we took out the kitchen chairs to
keep him from</B>
<BR><B>throwing them.&nbsp; At least</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;one daughter has said she'd turn in $20 found in</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Wal-Mart parking lot, only to steal her sisters birth-</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;day money a week later, and say "Sowhat?",whencaught.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I read the bible to her as she tore up paper with</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;her teeth.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Strange Light in the Fort</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: joerich@ufl.edu</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
family of four was camping near one of the American Civil</B>
<BR><B>War forts along the Atlantic Coast, and decided to take a stroll
inside</B>
<BR><B>after dark, during the summer of 1999. It was a beautiful, very
warm night</B>
<BR><B>with a full moon. We meant no harm to the place, we merely sat down
about</B>
<BR><B>30 yards inside the entrance, and waited. The place has a reputation
for</B>
<BR><B>occasional ghosts, as park employees had told us. They said you
have to be</B>
<BR><B>relaxed and not looking, to actually run into something. That is
what</B>
<BR><B>happened to us.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a half hour of
looking and listening, we started getting</B>
<BR><B>pretty tired; it was after midnight. So we headed down the sidewalk
just</B>
<BR><B>inside the towering walls, ready to leave. On an impulse, I mentioned
that</B>
<BR><B>we hadn't even been inside one the many cannon rooms, not a single
dark</B>
<BR><B>place that was out of the bright moonlight.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I veered into one of the rooms,
about four paces inside. The very</B>
<BR><B>dark room suddenly grew brighter, the light flooding across the
floor but</B>
<BR><B>not reaching the far wall, about 12 feet ahead of me. I can remember</B>
<BR><B>wondering, "Why can I see every detail of the floor?" There was
nothing</B>
<BR><B>that could do that, unless some bright meteor behind me was lighting
up the</B>
<BR><B>sky. Also, it was a strange light, very "grainy".</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spun around and said, "What
the hell was that?" Total darkness. My</B>
<BR><B>6-foot teenager stood in the doorway, completely speechless. He
was covered</B>
<BR><B>with</B>
<BR><B>goose bumps and cold air. He had tears in his eyes. To this day,
he has a</B>
<BR><B>difficult time describing it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife was eight feet away from him on
the outer sidewalk, and</B>
<BR><B>stepped over to him while the cold air lingered for a moment. Better
yet,</B>
<BR><B>she got a good look at what had happened. A "cloud of light" about
three</B>
<BR><B>feet long and two feet high had swooped down out of a gnarly old
tree about</B>
<BR><B>a dozen feet out in the courtyard, into the entrance of the room,
almost</B>
<BR><B>striking my son. Three seconds later it zipped back out and disappeared.
It</B>
<BR><B>lit up about 30 feet of ground while outside the fort. She said
the light</B>
<BR><B>also resembled "many pieces of a broken mirror".</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My other son was eight feet
farther up the sidewalk, and had his</B>
<BR><B>back to the light. However, it spread light across the ground and
grass so</B>
<BR><B>bright, he thought someone had lit a boat flare behind him. The
stark</B>
<BR><B>shadows around the leaves lying on the ground at his feet shifted,
as the</B>
<BR><B>ball of light moved.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I had been by myself, I
would have thought it was a fainting</B>
<BR><B>spell, or something like that. But all four of us were chattering
about it.</B>
<BR><B>The light had a very playful, mischievous feel to it, almost magical,
and</B>
<BR><B>no threat at all. The four of us trudged back to our tent in silence,</B>
<BR><B>puzzled and mystified by the whole thing.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A year later, visiting the
fort again, we told the park ranger about</B>
<BR><B>it. He told us a few stories of his own about the fort, but thought
perhaps</B>
<BR><B>ours was a searchlight from a passing barge. However, I was raised
on the</B>
<BR><B>Intracoastal Canal and saw barges with their shifting searchlights,
some</B>
<BR><B>that even lit up my own bedroom, almost every night for many years.
This</B>
<BR><B>was nothing like that. As for the ball lightning theory, there were</B>
<BR><B>hundreds of cannon rooms available. Why did it chase after me in
that</B>
<BR><B>particular room?</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone more knowledgeable
in paranormal psychology later told us it</B>
<BR><B>might have been an "elemental", a non-human life form. I don't know.
On our</B>
<BR><B>next</B>
<BR><B>visit, a friend of ours who is sensitive did feel some strange things.
He</B>
<BR><B>felt that a worker helping build the fort in the 1800's was accidentally</B>
<BR><B>hung by the neck. Also that pirates had been responsible for some

<P><B>Something is in my Parents House</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: jtn-sync@swbell.net ..</B><B></B>

<P><B>I know my story is NOT as exciting as some of the other stories I
have read on your site, but none the least I would share my experiences
with you and anyone else who is interested.</B>
<BR><B>I have lived in my parents house since I was 4 years old.&nbsp;
We are the only owners of the house.&nbsp; I have NEVER had a problem with
the house.&nbsp; I mean sure once in a blue moon I would think I would
see things out of the corner of my eye and when my son was born I would
awake to him talking to "something" and then lay back down and go to sleep.&nbsp;
I just figured it was my grandmother talking to him (she passed 2 months
before he was born).</B>
<BR><B>Then I moved out and met my boyfreind and we BOTH moved back in
with my parents.&nbsp; And that is when the strange things started happening.
Like I said I have NEVER had a problem with the house, but my boyfriend
sure did.&nbsp; At first I just thought he was crazy or that his imagination
was just WAY TOO BIG.&nbsp; One night me and him were alone in the house
and I went to the restroom and came out and he was sitting on the couch
with a very scared look on his face.&nbsp; He had said that he had seen
a small glowing light (like a lightening bug) in the kitchen that kinda
floated real slow and then disaapeared.&nbsp; I shrugged it off and said
he was just seeing things.&nbsp; Then one night we were getting ready for
bed, and on his side of the bed was a full cup full of water just sitting
there.&nbsp; I asked my parents and neither one of them had done and.&nbsp;
I know it wasn't my son because he was only 2 at the time and he would
have spilt the water.&nbsp; But once again I shrugged it off, but started
to be a lil more cautious of my boyfriend and his reaction to things.</B>
<BR><B>Things started to get a lil worse a few weeks later.&nbsp; I am
sitting on the floor doing my family tree stuff and he walks in and freaks
out&nbsp; asking me why the blue screen is on the television and when I
looked up the TV was off.&nbsp; He was extremely unsettled.&nbsp; So we
are sitting in the room and basically ask if there was a prescence there
and the lights flickered 3 times.&nbsp; Was that our imagination.&nbsp;
WHO KNOWS?</B>
<BR><B>But it got to the point where he couldn't even take showers by himself.&nbsp;
He would call me in there because he would be in a HOT shower but just
be freazing cold..........</B>
<BR><B>We heard through friends to just tell the spirit to leave but we
didn't want to do that because we didn't know if it needed something from
us or if it was trying to tell my boyfriend somethingThen I think the ghost
gave up on him and turned to me.</B>
<BR><B>I came home and lil things like the microwave door opening.&nbsp;
The blow dryer turning on.&nbsp; The toilet seat going down.&nbsp; And
my mom saying she looked for a bill for a month and then woke up one morning
and it was sitting on the counter.&nbsp; During the time of the occurances
I was tracing my family tree.&nbsp; Maybe that has something to do with
it.&nbsp; Or maybe the sprirt has BEEN in the house and just formed a liking
for my boyfriend when he moved in.&nbsp; WHO KNOWS!!!!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Shawangunk Mountains</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; Chris</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I was pleased to find this listed on your site. My family and
I have had a</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;summer residence in the region since the 1970's and have hiked
the range</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;extensively.</B>
<BR><B>In general, one feels a strong sense of richness in the area. Visually,</B>
<BR><B>the place is beautiful, with many cliff, gorges and dark "Tolkein-esque"</B>
<BR><B>woods. The geology and ecology is unique for the North East. There
were several</B>
<BR><B>old victorian mountain-top hotels on the ridge at one point (Minnewaska</B>
<BR><B>Mountain Houses), that were reportedly haunted (room 444 in particular,
I believe).</B>
<BR><B>Not sure about the surviving hotel: Mohonk Mountain House.</B>
<BR><B>I've long been fascinated by the scenery and mood of the place,
but there</B>
<BR><B>are a few instances that come to mind that have been somewhat freaky.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;1) My family and I were hiking to a particular crag, "Bear
Hill", on a</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;rather damp and foggy day. My mother and I kept thinking that
we heard an</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;animal rustling off to the left of the trail. We actually
caught a</B>
<BR><B>fleeting</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;glimpses of what looked somewhat like an albino deer (is there
such a</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;thing?), but bigger. It followed a path parallel to our hiking
trail the</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;whole time, pacing with us, while a deer would most likely
run away.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;2) Camp Don Bosco. This was once a religious camp/retreat
center on the</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;western flank of the ridge, featuring several old stone shrines,
somewhat</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;ruined. My family and I were following a trail to a lake above,
but the</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;trail kept looping back on itself and leading no-where.&nbsp;
After several</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;disoriented attempts to find our way, we just aimed ourselves
down hill,</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;quite spooked, and just got the hell out of there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;3) Trail near Awosting Falls, after nightfall. My girlfriend
and I didn't</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;time our hike very well and night fell upon us. The woods
in this area are</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;characterized by very old stands of hemlock. Perhaps it was
just my</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;girlfriend's nerves, (and her nails digging into my hand),
but it</B>
<BR><B>distinctly felt like we were being followed. When we stopped walking,
it almost</B>
<BR><B>sounded like we could hear footfalls behind us on the gravel carriage
road. When</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;we'd stop to listen, they would then stop after a split second
delay after</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;ours. An echo? Of course, being "the man", I minimized all
this at the</B>
<BR><B>time, but I tell you, I'm never hiking there again after dark. My
hair was on</B>
<BR><B>end. There are many more instances, mainly of the variety where
a "presence"</B>
<BR><B>was felt.</B>

<P><B>Shadow In The Woods</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp; Unknown</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was young, (around 11 or 12) I DEFINATLY was being haunted!
One day, at my school, me and my friends were crouded around the entrance
to the trails that led into the woods. We were joking around and saying
that someone was murdered in the woods a couple of weeks before, and that
thier body was hung on one of the trees. (of course nobody believed this,
and neither did I) Well a few people went into the woods to prove that
nothing had happened. Well, the teacher who was on duty caught them (we
wern't aloud in the woods) and they had to sit out the rest of recess.
Everyone who had gone into the woods had come out. A few minutes later,
we were joking around again, when we heard footsteps and crunching leaves.
We looked into the woods, and there was a dark shadow of a boy about our
age running where patches of light hit the ground. (remember, everyone
was out of the woods) There was no school for miles, and no houses either.
We screamed and ran away.</B>

<P><B>Scream in the Afternoon</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Bracesgurl@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have sent one story here, but it was never put on the page so I
decided to</B>
<BR><B>try again. I have *so* many stories it is unbelievable, since I
am only 12</B>
<BR><B>years old. My house is very extremely haunted but I think yesterday
I heard</B>
<BR><B>one of the first noises that wasn't the house, so to speak. I was
sitting in</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom, the downstairs bathroom which is right next to the
steps to the</B>
<BR><B>basement and the kitchen. Both of my parents were in the den. As
I was</B>
<BR><B>sitting there, my father came into the kitchen and messed around
with</B>
<BR><B>something in a jar, I could hear him. A few seconds later I heard
a</B>
<BR><B>high-pitched scream come from by the garage. I knew it was a young
girl,</B>
<BR><B>maybe 7 or 8, it just sounded like one. And I hurried out of the
bathroom and</B>
<BR><B>said "DAD! Didn't you just come into the kitchen?" His answer was
yes.</B>
<BR><B>"Didn't you hear it?" "Hear what?" was his question. "I heard a
little girl,</B>
<BR><B>screaming outside, go check okay? Maybe she's hurt!" Well, my father
went</B>
<BR><B>outside, and not only was there no little girls, but it was deserted.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say I hurry when I'm in the bathroom now.</B>
<BR><B>Another story is well, it's happening right this moment. Whenever
I come into</B>
<BR><B>the den (my computer and TV room, which is located directly underneath
my</B>
<BR><B>parents bedroom) I can hear people walking upstairs, even when nobody
is</B>
<BR><B>home. I also hear things in the dining room which is right behind
me. It</B>
<BR><B>sounds like somebody is poking our china closet and then sitting
on our</B>
<BR><B>heater.</B>
<BR><B>Other things that happen are whenever you walk down my stairs you
can feel</B>
<BR><B>somebody watching you. I ask my friends, even those who don't believe
in</B>
<BR><B>ghosts, if they get scared upstairs. They say yes, and they asked
if I stood</B>
<BR><B>behind them while they were walking down the steps. I always tell
them no,</B>
<BR><B>that was just our ghost, and they usually don't come over for a
while. I</B>
<BR><B>think the ghost is watching over people who go down the steps. Maybe
it died</B>
<BR><B>because it fell down the steps or something.</B>
<BR><B>Also, there have been many things that happen in my bedroom. My
closet is the</B>
<BR><B>creepiest closet in the world. I always shut it, and sometimes when
I wake up</B>
<BR><B>it is partially or fully opened. Then I ask my parents who was in
my room</B>
<BR><B>last night or this morning and they always reply that they respect
my privacy</B>
<BR><B>and wouldn't come in without asking. One night I awoke to a banging
noise in</B>
<BR><B>my room and my closet door flew open before my eyes.</B>
<BR><B>This has only happened once, but I was laying in bed, and I had
just awoken,</B>
<BR><B>it was the middle of the night, but for some reason I could still
see the</B>
<BR><B>posters on my wall even though it was dark. Immediatley my eyes
looked at my</B>
<BR><B>cat collage (that I created by cutting out small pictures of cats
from a cat</B>
<BR><B>calendar and pasting them on cardboard) and wouldn't stop going
over all of</B>
<BR><B>the pictures. I tried to turn my head but it wouldn't budge, and
my eyes just</B>
<BR><B>kept going very slowly over the pictures. When I could finally move
again I</B>
<BR><B>ran downstairs and told my parents. They told me I was probably
dreaming, but</B>
<BR><B>I knew I wasn't because I could feel my head hurting from laying
on my hard</B>
<BR><B>pillow. The whole time I was looking at the collage, I heard whispering.
Like</B>
<BR><B>a room full of people whispering, but it was quiet. And NO it was
NOT the</B>
<BR><B>wind.</B>
<BR><B>I have more stories but I will write them later. Thanks for listening
and</B>
<BR><B>believing.</B>

<BR><B>Scott Valley Haunted House</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: a_watcher152@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This time would be different, I thought.&nbsp; But here I</B>
<BR><B>was, broke, with no job, in the middle of nowhere and living in
a really</B>
<BR><B>scary, old haunted house, the last thing in the world I ever wanted
to</B>
<BR><B>do.&nbsp; It all started when I decided to make another attempt</B>
<BR><B>at leaving the big city for good.&nbsp; I disliked big cities, but
back then I</B>
<BR><B>somehow always wound up in one, in order to survive financially.</B>
<BR><B>This is a detailed, honest true story about the haunted house I
found myself living in, 2</B>
<BR><B>miles from the nearest neighbor. It was early summer in &Ocirc;74&Otilde;
and I was getting anxious</B>
<BR><B>about leaving the L.A. area... again.&nbsp; Finally after searching
high and</B>
<BR><B>low, I landed a job as an engineer at the local, yokel daytime only</B>
<BR><B>radio station.&nbsp; It was located near the sparsely populated
Mount Shasta</B>
<BR><B>area, only 30 miles from and bordering the valley I hoped to live
in,</B>
<BR><B>again.&nbsp; I arrived on the scene as soon as I could at the radio
station.</B>
<BR><B>After a brief introduction to the ins and outs expected of me and
a</B>
<BR><B>full day of work, I proceeded off to my favorite valley.&nbsp; Everything
was</B>
<BR><B>looking rosy, at least it was at the beginning.&nbsp; I had friends
in this</B>
<BR><B>valley from when I lived here before, so I figured I could stay
with them; look around for a</B>
<BR><B>place to rent nearby and make the 30 mile trek every day to work.&nbsp;
After</B>
<BR><B>all it was quite common around these here parts to do this for</B>
<BR><B>employment, as well as for big city groceries.</B>
<BR><B>Within a short 2 weeks, things werent going as</B>
<BR><B>expected at the radio station.&nbsp; They had changed their mind
about being able</B>
<BR><B>to afford a full time; engineer.&nbsp; However, this didnt deter
me in my</B>
<BR><B>hopes of securing employment elsewhere and staying in the area,
so I</B>
<BR><B>stuck it out. I had already looked at several prospective rentals,</B>
<BR><B>but none were too impressive.&nbsp; Finally one day, I saw an old
friend</B>
<BR><B>(Brian) and his newly wedded wife.&nbsp; He had also been looking
for a home to</B>
<BR><B>rent and had discovered several possibilities I hadnt even heard</B>
<BR><B>of.&nbsp; One place sounded really nice from Brians description.&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was an older 2 story 6 bedroom farm house complete with out buildings
and</B>
<BR><B>all.&nbsp; It was located 10 miles from the nearest town (by road)
on</B>
<BR><B>the lightly traveled east side road.&nbsp; It was renting for $75
per month.</B>
<BR><B>The owner had agreed to cut this way down in lue of work done on
the house,</B>
<BR><B>Brian told me.&nbsp; I was starting to get excited, until his wife
added,</B>
<BR><B>its haunted. This having been my first time meeting Brians wife,
I</B>
<BR><B>didnt know what to think.&nbsp; Brian was a very non-superstitious
person.</B>
<BR><B>Judging from what I had previously heard about his new wife, she
was</B>
<BR><B>too.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I decided to check the house out.&nbsp;
Maybe she didn&Otilde;t like</B>
<BR><B>old fashioned houses that needed work, I didn&Otilde;t know. I found
the house (2 miles from the nearest occupied house) early in the afternoon.&nbsp;
It was a warm summer day and the fresh air</B>
<BR><B>and rising mountains behind it, gave it a wonderful atmosphere.</B>
<BR><B>I could see the barns and other barn-like buildings stretching out</B>
<BR><B>beyond the main house.&nbsp; As I approached the front door, I noticed
that</B>
<BR><B>most of the wooden porch had rotted and collapsed with the years,</B>
<BR><B>making it impassable.&nbsp; Then I remembered that Brian had told
me</B>
<BR><B>to enter the house through the rear side entrance.&nbsp; I walked
over to the</B>
<BR><B>rear &Ograve;kitchen&Oacute; entrance thinking about how nice it
would be to live</B>
<BR><B>in this old farm house.</B>
<BR><B>When I entered the kitchen, I was greeted with the sound of a running</B>
<BR><B>faucet.&nbsp; I went over to the sink and tried, in vain, to turn
the water</B>
<BR><B>off.&nbsp; These attempts only made matters worse and the water
came out more and louder.&nbsp; So, I decided to go on and enjoy my visit.&nbsp;
The kitchen was huge (already the size of most</B>
<BR><B>living rooms) with high ceilings and all, which included the &Ograve;standard&Oacute;</B>
<BR><B>old fashioned, floor to ceiling, glass doored cabinets for dishes,
etc.&nbsp; After exploring</B>
<BR><B>this and the cold storage room located through another door outside
the kitchen, I proceeded on into the adjoining living room, towards the
front of the house.</B>
<BR><B>The living room must have been twice the size of the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen, with high ceilings as well.&nbsp; I was getting more and
more</B>
<BR><B>excited.&nbsp; Walking through the living room to another doorway,
I entered</B>
<BR><B>a hallway which connected to the front part of the house.&nbsp;
Off to the left side of the</B>
<BR><B>hall was the lone bathroom for this place.&nbsp; Continuing on through
the</B>
<BR><B>hall were 4 bedrooms, 3 of which looked out onto the front of the
house.&nbsp; 2</B>
<BR><B>of them had outside doors opening out onto the decaying front porch
I had</B>
<BR><B>seen when I arrived. Boy, was I getting quite excited about the
prospect of</B>
<BR><B>living in this house the more I looked at it or what?&nbsp; In fact
so much so,</B>
<BR><B>that I had completely forgotten about the comment from Brian&Otilde;s
wife.</B><B></B>

<P><B>After making the &Ograve;grand&Oacute; tour of this downstairs area,
I proceeded on back towards and</B>
<BR><B>through the living room to another doorway. On entering this, I
discovered a stairway going</B>
<BR><B>upstairs (the house had originally been built as a single story
house (with an attic)</B>
<BR><B>consisting of only 4 front rooms and a bathroom; the living room,
huge kitchen</B>
<BR><B>and upstair&Otilde;s bedrooms to the rear had been added years later).&nbsp;
At</B>
<BR><B>the top of this stairway was a long narrow hallway going along one
side of the house.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>rear part ran straight into a linen closet.&nbsp; This linen closet
to the rear of the</B>
<BR><B>hallway was stuffed full of disorderly construction materials and
pieces of junk wood.&nbsp; To its right was a door going into a nice old
fashioned room complete with old fashioned, hand carved trim molding. I
explored this rear cozy &Ograve;classy&Oacute; room and took a liking to
it.&nbsp; I was thinking &Ocirc;what a neat house&Otilde;.&nbsp; Now, I
walked back down this hall towards the front upstairs room, which had</B>
<BR><B>its door shut. When I first opened the door and entered, it appeared</B>
<BR><B>to have beenrecently remodeled with newly taped dry wall (sheet</B>
<BR><B>rock) and modern height ceilings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for the exciting
part: Almost</B>
<BR><B>immediately upon entering this room, I felt uncomfortable.&nbsp;
Nothing could have been further from</B>
<BR><B>my mind.&nbsp; Just moments before while touring this house, I had
been experiencing a &Ograve;dream come true&Oacute;.&nbsp; However, as
soon as I entered &Ograve;this room&Oacute;, I had the</B>
<BR><B>strong sensation that someone was staring at me to my right,</B>
<BR><B>which was towards the front of this house.&nbsp; I turned in that
direction and noticed a</B>
<BR><B>square cut out in the dry wall that had a plastic sheet thumb tacked</B>
<BR><B>over it.&nbsp; This was evidently an entrance into the attic over
the front</B>
<BR><B>part of the original house.I stepped over to this opening and removed
the two top</B>
<BR><B>tacks that held the plastic in place.&nbsp; I folded the plastic
away so I</B>
<BR><B>could look in. Maybe it was because my eyes weren&Otilde;t adjusted
to the</B>
<BR><B>darkness, but I thought I distinctly saw two hideous looking eyes</B>
<BR><B>staring at me out of the darkness.&nbsp; Then the noises started:
the creaking,</B>
<BR><B>as if someone was slowly walking towards me on the attic rafters.</B>
<BR><B>Part 2 coming soon.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Radio City Music Hall</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:&nbsp;&nbsp; colletteebear@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Description of Haunting: Dear Sirs: I was a young performer for Radio
City Music Hall's Christmas Spectacular. The show is 75 years old, and
the building is even older. It was built from S.L. (Roxy) Rathefel, he
built this beautiful city within a city. It is truly breath taking if you
knew all the details that he thought of so many years ago. Anyway, he built
a beautiful stage with seating for 6,000 people.."Mr. Roxy"( as all the
people that work at Radio City call him..) did not know he had built one
of the worlds largest theatres in the nation! When it was first built..they
hired workers from the navy to guard the undergroud work...(that makes
the stage go up and down..stage elevators) Mr. Roxy thought of it all by
himself.</B>
<BR><B>Well doing the show for almost 3 months, you hear the inside rumors..Mr.
Roxy built this complex and also lived in it. He was a very wealthy man,
and his room which is called the "Roxy Suite" . It is absolutely gorgeous,
none of his books or furniture has been touched..he is a very reconized
person with the people that work in the building. Rumor says that he was
quite a drinker, his suite is now used for tours..where guests can have
refreshments. Mr. Roxy died a while ago, but like I said..the respect for
this man is almost like a very close friendship with everyone.</B>
<BR><B>Well..I few of the dressers that pre-set our costumes underground
and on the backstage stage. (the stage is a block long) One of my very
close friends which does all the pre-setting has told me a few rumors....when
she is alone working backstage...she can smell this VERY strong scent of
alcohol..out of no where at 8am in the morning. it is almost like someone
breathed over her..but then the next minute its GONE. Everyone at Radio
City Music Hall believes in the spirit of Mr. Roxy. He is not a bad spirit,
he built this complex with his heart and now performers all over the world
can enjoy it.</B>
<BR><B>Well i was backstage on the left side where the dresser smelled
the strange alcohol. I was warming up 15 minutes to the show..and im always
the first down there because I take a while..no one but the dressers and
stage hands where there..kinda in and out. Well..i was moving pretty fast
and i turned around and I saw this man...with a checkered kind of jacket
with a very old looking hat tilted one way so you couldnt see his face.
he was holding an unlit cicarette in one of his hand. He had a scarf around
his neck and black pants..he didnt look fancy..quite rough looking. not
really matching...well I could tell through the shadow of his hat that
he was looking at the ceilings..like he knew this place very well..examining
it with great joy. the wrinkles on his face showed me that he was smiling.
I only saw him for a second but for the fact that i saw someone so strange
looking for that split second it caught every detail. No one so closed
to showtime can go so close to the set p!</B>
<BR><B>eices execept the stage-hands...ony dressed in ALL BLACK. well i
turned around when i saw that figure...and he was gone...how could I have
picked that detail up so closely if i didnt actually see something? the
man didnt scare me...it was quite a moment if it really was Mr. Roxy was
examining his own beautiful work.</B>
<BR><B>Radio City Music Hall is the home of the famous Radio City Rockettes.
The show that I performed in was their Radio City Christmas Spectacular(starring
the Rockettes). I was Clara in the Nutcracker act. I had the best time
working there, and there wasnt a thing that didnt bring a smile to my face.
I will never forget any of my experiences with performing and life on this
adventure. The show is now closed, and I am living in California.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Premonition</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gscott2@ipa.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;My maternal grandmother told me about this when I was a little
girl. My&nbsp; grandfather worked in the oil fields&nbsp; around 1929,
he was coming home from work one night. He had to walk through the oil
fields to get home.&nbsp; One night when he got home from work he told
my grandmother something had followed him in the oil fields coming home
he said it scared him, he said it was white and it looked like a woman's
apron with ties coming out on either side of it, he said it floated&nbsp;
up and over him, and it scared him. He also said when he reached the road
it just disappeared, If I'm not mistaken he said this happed three nights
in a row. He told his wife (which is my grandmother) that he thought it
was a premonition, that something was going to happen. The next day he
was killed in an oil well explosion, that was February the 14th, my mother
was just 9 years old when it happened.</B><B></B>

<P><B>One Heck of a Teenage Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: natemills_2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>first of all great site!</B>
<BR><B>I live here in rector arkansas which about two miles outside there
is an old cemetary called Mary's Chapel Cemetary. At one time The church
sat on these grounds before it burnt &amp; was moved down the road.</B>
<BR><B>There is a story of the first person buried in the cemetary was
a little girl by the name of Mary Copland. She was run over by a horse
and buggy.</B>
<BR><B>As the story goes if you go out there at night and turn off your
engine and aim your head lights at her tomb stone she will step out from
behind it and crawl up on hood of your car and then dissapear &amp; your
car will not start until daylight.</B>
<BR><B>Well one Friday night we thought it would funny to take some girls
out there and have a little fun and scare them so i went by one of my buddys
house and picked him &amp; his four wheeler up, since it was a prety long
way up the trail road up to the cemetary, about 10:30 pm to drop him off
there. He was supposed to ride up there and hide , since he was the only
one of us that was actualy brave enough to be up there alone, to sneek
up behind the truck when we got there and scare them.</B>
<BR><B>so about midnight we picked up the girls and headed out to the cemetary.
As we made the turn to go up the trail we saw our buddy standing at the
bottom of the trail waiting on us. He was standing there pale white shaking
&amp; babbling. We finaly got out of him that about 20 min. earlier he
had been setting there when he felt a cold breeze, which was odd since
it was the middle of July, he said then he heard something walking across
the cemetary. He said he figured it was just a deer or something, but it
just kept getting closer so he finaly turned on his flash light to scare
it off. When he turned it on there was a little girl standing about ten
feet away staring at him. It scared him so bad that he dropped his light
and ran down the trail and in to us.</B>
<BR><B>We were a little sceptical but one of the girls said that the familys
down the road had a little girl and was afraid that she might have wandered
out of the house and was lost.</B>
<BR><B>Well after a couple of cans of liquid courage I decided to go ahead
and drive up to the cematary and make sure it wasn't her,I knew no matter
how scared we were she had to be ten times as scared as we were.</B>
<BR><B>I drove very slowly up the trail jiust in case she ran out from
the side the road. About half way up I could see the beam from his flashlight
moving so figured she was setting there holding the light so I sped up
. When I got up to the cematary the light was laying on the ground. Figuring
she had go scared and hid we called out her name but there was no answer.
One girl said "look" and there she was in the head lights at the far end
of the cematary. I hollered out "Don't move we'll be right there to get
you". The closer we got&nbsp; the worse the&nbsp; truck began to run. When
we got close enugh to realy see her the girls began to screem because it
wasn't her . About that time I threw it in to reverse and began to tear
out in a hurry when I backed in to a tree and killed the motor. No matter
how hard I tried it would not start.&nbsp; The girl started walking towards
us so we al got out and ran like hell to the nearest house witch happened
to be house of the little girl that we thought had wandered out into the
cematary.</B>
<BR><B>We told the man the story of our strange encounter, He was very
upset that we had been out there so late and messing around out there,he
said it did not surprise him because we were no the first people to nock
on his door in the middle of the night scared to death.</B>
<BR><B>He let us camp out in the living room and said he would take us
up there to get my truck in the morning. Well we got my truck started and
loaded up the fourwheeler and left as fast as my old ford would carry us
the whole time we were back up there the hairs on the back of my neck stood
straight up until the moment we were down the trail.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say I'm a believer and haven't been back since!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Supernatural Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rain_keeping@lycos.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am writing you to tell you some experiences I have had with the
supernatural.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I have ever wrote you before, because
I have told other web-sites some of my true stories in the past, and I'm
not sure if you were one of them.&nbsp; Anyway, I have had many experiences
with ghosts, so have some friends and family members.&nbsp; I will write
a few here, and if you are interested in hearing more, just write me back.&nbsp;
They may be a bit long, so please bear with me.</B>
<BR><B>First, I will tell you about the last ghost experience I have had.&nbsp;
My boyfriend "Tyler" and I were alone in my home (beginning of last summer),
when he heard mom call out to me.&nbsp; He told me she just called and
I said that I didn't know she was home, so I went downstairs, and no one
was home (the car was gone too).&nbsp; I went upstairs and told Tyler that
no one was home and he said that he was sure he heard something.&nbsp;
A short while later, we heard the front door close and mom called out to
me again.&nbsp; Tyler and I both heard this, so I went downstairs, only
to find out that my parents still weren't home.&nbsp; I went back upstairs
and told him no one was home, but we both were sure we heard something.&nbsp;
Then, we heard the front door close, and there were footsteps leading towards
the basement door, and then the basement door slammed shut.&nbsp; This
time Tyler went with me, and when we went downstairs, no one was home and
the front door was locked, and the chain lock was still on the basement</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;door.&nbsp; We were starting to get freaked out now, and searched
the house.&nbsp; Every door and window was locked, and there was no sign
that anyone had been home.&nbsp; We went back upstairs to my room, and
as soon as we got back, we heard the front door close again..&nbsp; Then
we heard people going up the stairs between the poarch and living room.&nbsp;
We heard mom call out my name again.&nbsp; We both went downstairs again
and no one was home.&nbsp; Then Tyler went to the bathroom, and when he
came back in my room, he told me he heard people walking around and talking
on the roof (we have a double roof that joins at the bathroom, so one wall
in the bathroom leads to the top of the shorter roof)&nbsp; We also heard
people talking and walking up and down the stairs for a while.</B>
<BR><B>That's all I can remember about what happened that day.&nbsp; This
might not be exactly like what happened because it happened almost a year
ago and I can't remember every detail, but it is true.</B>
<BR><B>Another thing that used to happen to me ever since I was a little
girl in the house my parents live in now (we moved there when I was 5 and
now I live somewhere else to go to school) was that I would hear mom calling
out to me when she wasn't home, or when she was asleep or just didn't call
out to me.&nbsp; The first time I remember this happening was when I was
in my room with the window open, and I heard mom knocking on the door and
calling out my name.&nbsp; I assumed she was locked out, so I went downstairs
to let her in.&nbsp; When I went downstairs, no one was there.&nbsp; My
father was in the next room, and I asked him if he heard anything, but
he said no, so I just went back to my room again.&nbsp; When I went upstairs,
I heard mom knocking on the door and calling out to me, so I carefully
went over, closed the window, and closed the blind.&nbsp; I heard mom calling
out to me a lot over the years.&nbsp; What really freaked me out, was one
day a few months ago I was over to my brother's house, and we got</B>
<BR><B>on the subject of the paranormal, when I told him about hearing
mom call out to me.&nbsp; He told me he used to hear that all the time
too, but assumed it was just in his head.&nbsp; I also found out that we
both had a problem with the basement.&nbsp; I would hear people talking
in there, and my brother had horrible dreams about it.&nbsp; But, that
could have just been a child's wild imagination.&nbsp; What kid isn't afraid
of the basement.</B>
<BR><B>One more thing I want to write to you is one time about 1 1/2 -
2 years ago I was walking from my room to the bathroom just across the
hall.&nbsp; When I did, I turned my head to look out the window in the
room at the end of the hall, and I saw something I though was my reflection
at first glance, but then realized that it appeared to be the face of an
old man.&nbsp; On the way back from the bathroom, I looked back again and
didn't see anything - not even my reflection - just blackness from the
night sky.&nbsp; After that happened, I realized that I couldn't possibly
have seen an obscure reflection of my face, because it is impossible for
someone to see their reflection in that window from the end of the hall.&nbsp;
That was the only time it ever happened, and I have never seen my reflection
from that window unless I was standing almost directly in front of it.</B>

<P><B>My True Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rena026@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ever since I was little, I have always felt more</B>
<BR><B>intune with the spiritual world. When I was a very</B>
<BR><B>young girl, my favorite uncle died,and shortly after</B>
<BR><B>we spread his ashes, I woke up in the middle of the</B>
<BR><B>night to find him standing near my bed. At first I was</B>
<BR><B>frightened but then I just became very calm. He had</B>
<BR><B>just come to say goodbye. When I told my mom, she did</B>
<BR><B>not believe me and said it was just a dream, but when</B>
<BR><B>I told my grandma, she said she believed me and that</B>
<BR><B>if he could come back to talk to anyone she believed</B>
<BR><B>it would be me. My parents' house is located on the</B>
<BR><B>corner of a very busy road, and we have had several</B>
<BR><B>accidents that have occurred there where people have</B>
<BR><B>died in our front yard. A few years ago before I moved</B>
<BR><B>out, I had a friend that was staying over. We had</B>
<BR><B>something we had to do the next day and didn't want to</B>
<BR><B>stay up late so we could actually get some sleep. We</B>
<BR><B>had just got in bed when we heard something at the</B>
<BR><B>front door. The front door is just located on the</B>
<BR><B>other side of the wall where my bed was. We glanced</B>
<BR><B>out my front window to see if someone was there and</B>
<BR><B>there was nothing so we laid back down. Then we could</B>
<BR><B>hear the door handle rattling. She looked at me and</B>
<BR><B>again we sat up and looked out the window, again there</B>
<BR><B>was nothing. After that we were both a little hesitant</B>
<BR><B>to go to sleep so we sat up listening to see what it</B>
<BR><B>was. The next thing really scared me. As we sat there</B>
<BR><B>silent, we heard a glass fall from the kitchen counter</B>
<BR><B>and shatter. We jumped and I said I bet that was just</B>
<BR><B>our cat on the counters again and knocked a glass from</B>
<BR><B>the dishdrainer. So, we decided to get up and look and</B>
<BR><B>clean it up. We walked out to the kitchen and looked</B>
<BR><B>around. Nothing. We walked into the living room,again</B>
<BR><B>nothing. We checked all of the rooms, nothing. Where</B>
<BR><B>was the cat, in my little brother's room sound asleep</B>
<BR><B>on his bed and the door shut. Even to this day I</B>
<BR><B>always feel uneasy there. My parent's insist it is</B>
<BR><B>just our imaginations, however my brother and sister</B>
<BR><B>get the same feeling and have had similar encounters.</B>
<BR><B>Even my 20 month old daughter refuses to go down the</B>
<BR><B>hallway to the bedrooms when it is dark, and when she</B>
<BR><B>goes over there like she wants something down</B>
<BR><B>there,she will take a few steps in the hall and come</B>
<BR><B>running to me like something has scared her to death.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently I don't live there and my boyfriend
and</B>
<BR><B>my daughter and I live in my great-grandmother's</B>
<BR><B>house. Believe me, it was not by choice, but because</B>
<BR><B>of financial problems it was the only place we had to</B>
<BR><B>go. My great-grandfather had committed suicide in the</B>
<BR><B>garage at this house and being there has always made</B>
<BR><B>me feel uneasy. Well, to get on with the story, one</B>
<BR><B>night I woke up in the middle of the night and looked</B>
<BR><B>at the clock. My alarm clock said it was a quarter to</B>
<BR><B>2. I looked down at my watch and my watch said 2:15. I</B>
<BR><B>was a little confused by this because before I had</B>
<BR><B>gone to bed I had made sure the time on my alarm and</B>
<BR><B>watch were the same and then I set the alarm, at first</B>
<BR><B>I brushed it off thinking maybe I was just so tired I</B>
<BR><B>just somehow set the clock wrong. I got up and walked</B>
<BR><B>across the hall to check on my daughter because I</B>
<BR><B>could hear the TV and it was so loud, she was sound</B>
<BR><B>asleep. As I walked down the hall to the bathroom, I</B>
<BR><B>noticed a glow in the living room, normally I would</B>
<BR><B>have been scared out of my mind to even walk out there</B>
<BR><B>but my boyfriend goes to bed late and I figured maybe</B>
<BR><B>he just left the TV on. I walked out there and sure</B>
<BR><B>enough it was on. I turned it off and went back into</B>
<BR><B>bed. My boyfriend asked what I was doing and I said</B>
<BR><B>well I woke up and could hear something. I asked him</B>
<BR><B>if he had reset the alarm or anything and he said no.</B>
<BR><B>I asked if he was positive because when I just got up</B>
<BR><B>it was set a half hour ahead of when I had set it</B>
<BR><B>before. Then I asked if he went into the living room</B>
<BR><B>and was watching TV. He said no, don't you remember we</B>
<BR><B>were watching a movie in here and I set the timer and</B>
<BR><B>we both fell asleep. Again I wanted to be sure, so I</B>
<BR><B>asked are you positive. He was like yes, why? I said</B>
<BR><B>well, I just walked out in the living room and the Tv</B>
<BR><B>was on full blast ( it is a really old TV that was my</B>
<BR><B>grandma's and has no remote or anything). How it</B>
<BR><B>turned on and why it was up full blast, I can only</B>
<BR><B>guess. I know my clock was set right and the Tv was</B>
<BR><B>off. Not only that but we have come home to find the</B>
<BR><B>slider door wide open when we make sure it is locked</B>
<BR><B>and has a bar that goes in so it can't be opened from</B>
<BR><B>the outside. Even now, I refuse to stay at home at</B>
<BR><B>night by myself when my boyfriend is at work, I always</B>
<BR><B>go somewhere else until he gets home. I can't wait to</B>
<BR><B>move out of there..........</B>

<BR><B>Friends Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:terrischell@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I guess I was like most people, when my friend told me</B>
<BR><B>that she had a ghost, I didn't really believe her.</B>
<BR><B>Don't get me wrong, she never lied to me before, but a</B>
<BR><B>ghost, get real.</B>
<BR><B>She would tell me about lights and tv's going on and</B>
<BR><B>off.&nbsp; She also told me about one of her mother's</B>
<BR><B>friends that would always trip on the same step no</B>
<BR><B>matter how careful she was going up the stairs.&nbsp; Her</B>
<BR><B>mom said that one day when she was cleaning the cord</B>
<BR><B>to the vacuum cleaner wrapped around her leg.&nbsp; Now</B>
<BR><B>after all these stories (and some others), I just</B>
<BR><B>thought she was pulling my leg or that there was some</B>
<BR><B>reasonable explanation.&nbsp; But one night she had a sleep</B>
<BR><B>over and my views changed rapidly.</B>
<BR><B>We were in junior high school (back in the 80's) and</B>
<BR><B>she lived in an apartment that was located behind the</B>
<BR><B>lobby of the motel that her mom managed.&nbsp; One thing</B>
<BR><B>you need to know is that they had four or five phones,</B>
<BR><B>but they were all connected to the same phone line</B>
<BR><B>(this phone line also ran the motel lobby's phone).</B>
<BR><B>Well, we (four of us) were doing what we loved to do.</B>
<BR><B>We were sitting around watching MTV and singing to the</B>
<BR><B>music.&nbsp; All of a sudden the phone in my friend's</B>
<BR><B>mothers room started ringing.&nbsp; We all thought this was</B>
<BR><B>odd since none of the other phones rang, but my friend</B>
<BR><B>went to answer it.&nbsp; She came back a few seconds later</B>
<BR><B>saying it was a prank phone call since it just</B>
<BR><B>sounding like wind blowing in the phone.&nbsp; I was a</B>
<BR><B>lifeguard at the time and had been getting a few prank</B>
<BR><B>phone calls myself and told her that I had stopped</B>
<BR><B>them by whistling my lifeguard whistle into the phone.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;So we waited for the phone to ring again and planned</B>
<BR><B>on giving the prankster something they wouldn't soon</B>
<BR><B>forget.&nbsp; Anyhow, the phone did ring again, and once</B>
<BR><B>again it was only the phone in the bedroom that rang.</B>
<BR><B>We both got up, whistle in hand, and went to answer</B>
<BR><B>the phone.&nbsp; She picked up the handset and as I looked</B>
<BR><B>at the phone I saw something that totally freaked me</B>
<BR><B>out!&nbsp; The phone cord was not plugged into the wall and</B>
<BR><B>there was no way that phone should have rang at all.</B>
<BR><B>Needless to say, I started yelling for her to drop it</B>
<BR><B>and she wanted to know why.&nbsp; I pointed out to her the</B>
<BR><B>problem and we ran out of the room and told the</B>
<BR><B>others.&nbsp; The phone rang anytime someone went into the</B>
<BR><B>apartment, so we spent the rest of the time waiting</B>
<BR><B>for her mother out in the lobby of the motel.&nbsp; We told</B>
<BR><B>her mother and she tried to explain that it was just a</B>
<BR><B>short in the wiring, but I pointed out that there was</B>
<BR><B>no electricity going into the phone.&nbsp; You could tell</B>
<BR><B>that she believed us, but didn't want to scare us by</B>
<BR><B>admitting what we all knew had happened.</B>
<BR><B>I never doubted her again.&nbsp; Later she came to me</B>
<BR><B>saying that things were getting worse, like something</B>
<BR><B>evil was there.&nbsp; We went to our local catholic priest</B>
<BR><B>and he was very helpful in giving her ideas to help</B>
<BR><B>the spirit find rest (not every priest is so</B>
<BR><B>receptive, only those that believe or have experienced</B>
<BR><B>something from beyond).&nbsp; After that things were</B>
<BR><B>better, but don't know if she ever stopped</B>
<BR><B>experiencing things (This entity followed her</B>
<BR><B>everywhere she moved to and at first had seemed to be</B>
<BR><B>a protector for her).</B>
<BR><B>I have just started visiting with her again (lost</B>
<BR><B>track of each other after college) and hope to ask her</B>
<BR><B>if she still has stuff happen but don't want to start</B>
<BR><B>something.</B>
