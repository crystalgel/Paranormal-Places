<P>
<P><B>Dear friends,</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is one of the weirdest and strangest moments of my life ever that
I</B>
<P><B>am about the share with you.  Please do not think that I am insane
or</B>
<P><B>making it up.  I really am not either one of the two, actually, I am
a</B>
<P><B>very level headed individual who had a strange experience which of
I</B>
<P><B>have never spoken before.  Here it is:</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been with my husband for ten years now.  I met him in July,
1989,</B>
<P><B>and I had never met his father, as he passed away in December, 1989.
 I</B>
<P><B>have however seen many photo's of this man and would know him if I
met</B>
<P><B>him on the street.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A few years after my husband and I had met I started College to
expand</B>
<P><B>my career.  I had three children already and wasn't prepared to have</B>
<P><B>anymore at the time, I did, however become pregnant in 1993.  This
was</B>
<P><B>four years after the death of my husbands father.  This is where it</B>
<P><B>get's a little crazy for me:</B>
<P>
<P><B>We had decided through a lot of tears and torment to terminate the</B>
<P><B>pregnancy and went ahead with it.  (It was the worse decision of my</B>
<P><B>life) anyhow, about two days after I got home from the hospital I
woke</B>
<P><B>up from  a very hard slap across the face, chest and felt my breasts</B>
<P><B>being fondled.  I thought it was my husband but he was sound asleep
and</B>
<P><B>rolled over on his side of the bed, it could not of been him.  I know
it</B>
<P><B>wasn't, because I saw a figure hovering over top of me when I woke
up</B>
<P><B>which looked exactly like his father had in the photo's I'd seen
before.</B>
<P><B>He then slowly almost floated to the doorway of our bedroom and left.
 I</B>
<P><B>was so freaked out that I woke my husband up immediately, he thought
I'd</B>
<P><B>dreamed it, but I know I didn't, I was wide awake.  I sat up in bed</B>
<P><B>frozen stiff, I will never forget how scared I was.  I could not
sleep</B>
<P><B>for weeks, the nightmare's still bother me to this day.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I believe that my baby that I'd given up intentionaly is with his</B>
<P><B>grandfather in heaven being looked after.  Apparantly this man hated</B>
<P><B>death and loved children immensley.  This man was in world war 2 and
did</B>
<P><B>not believe in murder or harming anything or anyone and I think what
I</B>
<P><B>did was disgusting as did he thinks too.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>While this is just one of my experiences in this house, I have to add</B>
<P><B>that my daughter was six at this time and complained a lot about
having</B>
<P><B>a bath there.  She would freak out and start crying often that the</B>
<P><B>shower curtain would fly up and all over the place.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>We had many of these strange things happen to us in the past years
since</B>
<P><B>my hospital stay.  Somedays I will be having a little nap after work
and</B>
<P><B>I wake up to whispering and soft noises.  I swear that I hear them.
 Am</B>
<P><B>I nuts?  This has followed us no matter where we live, I think we
just</B>
<P><B>have a guardian angel in a sense perhaps.  Nothing has ever harmed
us at</B>
<P><B>least. If anything as bizarre as the first incident ever happens
again</B>
<P><B>though I will be sure to share the experience with you.</B>

<P><B>True Experiences</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: JMu3523541@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>  This story was handed down to me from my grandmother and she would
get highly </B>
<P><B>upset when my brother and I would fight and get angry with each other
and </B>
<P><B>utter those words that weren't allowed in my house.  "When I die I'm
going to </B>
<P><B>come back and haunt you."</B>
<P><B>It all started back when my grandmother was a little girl of 3yrs old.(Yes
</B>
<P><B>she still remembered it up until the day she passed on.)  My grandmother
was </B>
<P><B>born half Cherokee Indian and my great grandmother was a full blooded
Indian </B>
<P><B>married to a "whiteman".  Back in those days it was unheard of for
this to </B>
<P><B>happen and so they all faced ridicule in the community.</B>
<P><B>My great grandparents did own a general store and did a good business.
 The </B>
<P><B>problem arose in a mild competition between my grandmother and her
next door </B>
<P><B>neighbor.  They would always try to top each other as far dressing
up and </B>
<P><B>showing off their daughters.  This was something the next door neighbor
could </B>
<P><B>not stand.  Even though next door had more of the wealth, my grandma
was </B>
<P><B>always dressed to the nine.</B>
<P><B>One day the next door neighbor took ill from pneumonia and my </B>
<P><B>great-grandmother went over to make amends with her because she was
at </B>
<P><B>death's door.</B>
<P><B>As usual the two got into an argument and the last thing that the next
door </B>
<P><B>neighbor said was "When I'm dead I'm going to haunt you."</B>
<P><B>Well, the lady did die and a few days later (after the funeral my
grandmother </B>
<P><B>could always recall it as if it were yesterday) the family was awoken
by a </B>
<P><B>huge ruckus downstairs.  She would tell us how her mother came running
into </B>
<P><B>her room and picked her up bring her to the staircase and shouting
into </B>
<P><B>creaking steps, "This is an angel of God and if you should harm one
hair on </B>
<P><B>her head may you forever be damned to hell!"  She then would tell of
how as </B>
<P><B>my great-grandmother finished that sentence the creaking on the steps
stopped </B>
<P><B>proceeded to head down the other way with more ruckus down stairs in
the </B>
<P><B>store and then the front door blew open.</B>
<P><B>The next day they went down to the store (there was no way they were
going </B>
<P><B>down there that night) and found 50Lb. flour kegs thrown across the
room, </B>
<P><B>shelves pulled down 100Lb. kegs of nails thrown about like they were
cotton </B>
<P><B>balls.</B>
<P><B>Till the day she passed on she would always remember that night and
would </B>
<P><B>always argue with my brother and I when we would bring up that saying.
 She </B>
<P><B>would never let us sleep until we swore by God that we took it back
and that </B>
<P><B>we didn't mean it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Daisy</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: GypsyCult@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My cat, Daisy, had to be put to sleep after she developed feline leukemia.
 </B>
<P><B>Not long after her death, she came back for a few short visits.   I
was lying </B>
<P><B>in bed one morning, awake, but not ready to get up.  I felt her familiar
step </B>
<P><B>at the foot of the bed.  She crept up the bed and finally settled on
my </B>
<P><B>knees.  Then the feeling was gone.  My father told me that he had similar
</B>
<P><B>experiences with kitty paws walking on him.  My mother, father and
I all saw </B>
<P><B>her sitting in the hall.  We would almost trip over a cat that wasn't
</B>
<P><B>physicially there.  I am glad she came back to let us know she was
all right. </B>

<P><B>Ghost in my Home</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: country_girl77@hotmail.com                 O-board story</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I had bought a Ouija Board when I was in grade six or something (approx.
7 </B>
<P><B>years ago). Me and my friend played it constantly. We were completely
</B>
<P><B>addicted to it. It was like an obsession. It was fun. We got a kick
out of </B>
<P><B>being able to talk to ghosts. Never again will I touch it. And I have
no </B>
<P><B>nerve to throw it away either because I am afraid that if I do, horrible
</B>
<P><B>things will happen. I will tell you why.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Me and my friend would play it for hours on end. We talked to so many
</B>
<P><B>"spirits" and were amazed by the fact that this board was actually
working. </B>
<P><B>On one incounter, I was in my bedroom playing it with her and  we asked
it </B>
<P><B>to do something to show it was there. Stupidest thing I ever did. I
asked it </B>
<P><B>to make my CD that was playing to skip. Now this was a brank spankin
new CD. </B>
<P><B>No scratches. It started to uncontrollably skip. I was so scared and
so was </B>
<P><B>my friend. The cursor (I don't know what its called) started moving
rapidly </B>
<P><B>on the board. It calmed down eventually. We put the board away and
even </B>
<P><B>after that, kept on playing it. Every weekend, sometimes during the
week.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Lights in my house would go on and turn off by themselves. It didn't
really </B>
<P><B>bother me too much because the lights were self touch lamps. All you
had to </B>
<P><B>do to turn it on was touch it. So I fugured they were just getting
old. I </B>
<P><B>had stopped playing the board for quite a while because it was just
scaring </B>
<P><B>me. I had pretty much forgotten about I guess you could say and then
saw it </B>
<P><B>in the hall closet. I left it there, and then one day it was under
my bed. I </B>
<P><B>didn't put it under my bed, so I am still wondering how it got there.
I try </B>
<P><B>not to let these things scare me though because ghosts or spirits like
</B>
<P><B>people they can scare. Thats the way I see it anyway. So don't let
myself </B>
<P><B>seem scared when weird things happen. Like if I feel a presense in
the room, </B>
<P><B>I try not to look around. Or if I sense something out of place, I will
make </B>
<P><B>it seem like I didn't even notice. Nothing weird had happen for a
while.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then we moved. Family friends moved into our old house. They told me
that </B>
<P><B>some weird things had happen when they first moved in. They were eating
and </B>
<P><B>listening to music and the stereo went off by itself. That is impossible
</B>
<P><B>because for it to go off you have to flick a switch. Then another day
they </B>
<P><B>were eating dinner and the stereo went on by itself when they were
watching </B>
<P><B>TV. They told me about it, not knowing I had played the board in there.
I </B>
<P><B>told them about it though. I said that they probably have a ghost.
Ever </B>
<P><B>since I said that, nothing has happened. Now weird things happen at
my new </B>
<P><B>house. Did it follow me home?</B>
<P>
<P><B>One day I was on the phone and when I was done the phone would not
hang up. </B>
<P><B>We only have 2 phones. So I unpluggedt he phone frome wall and plugged
it </B>
<P><B>back in and it still wouldn't work. There was no noise. Just silence.
It </B>
<P><B>worked again 10 minutes later.I was scared, but didn't show it. Then
about </B>
<P><B>two days later the phone rang and it was my friend. Then about 1 minute
</B>
<P><B>later my phone call display said "extention in use" whic means someone
was </B>
<P><B>on the other phone. Well my mom was the only other person home and
i asked </B>
<P><B>to to get off the phone, but it turned out she was standing right behind
me. </B>
<P><B>She wasn't o the phone. I just remembered that my phone was in my room.
</B>
<P><B>(Cordless phone). I went up to my room to turn it off or see what was
wrong </B>
<P><B>with it. When I creeped into my room, My phone was right beside my
bed. I </B>
<P><B>grabbed it and it was off. I went down stairs and the call display
no longer </B>
<P><B>said extention in use.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It kind of makes you wonder doesn't it. Is there ghosts out there?
In my </B>
<P><B>home, or in MY room?</B>
<P>
<P><B>An Interesting Evening</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: RaPIer2K@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>About three months ago both my mother and I decided to take a vacation,
after </B>
<P><B>visiting your website I thought that it would be interesting to visit
some of </B>
<P><B>the places that you listed in your section of Haunted places in America.
 </B>
<P><B>Both of us decided to go to Louisiana, because we love the state. We
left Ft. </B>
<P><B>Worth TX And drove to Baton Rouge, where I convinced my mom to make
the trip </B>
<P><B>to St. Francisville LA.  We stayed the night at the Myrtles Plantation,
this </B>
<P><B>is how our night went.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After we went to the store to get some food, we came back and sat down
on the </B>
<P><B>back porch outside the entrance that would lead upstairs to our room.
Now </B>
<P><B>both of us were nervous, because we were staying at the "Most Haunted
House </B>
<P><B>in America"  there were a few animals running around the grounds, one
was a </B>
<P><B>gray cat and the other was a golden retriever puppy. We fed both of
them </B>
<P><B>roast beef that we got at the store, but when we tried to coax them
into the </B>
<P><B>house with it, they wouldn't dare come close to us.  My mom actually
picked </B>
<P><B>the cat up and brought it upstairs, when she set it down it dropped
onto it's </B>
<P><B>stomach, laid it's ears back and ran out down the stair staying as
close to </B>
<P><B>the wall as possible. This wasn't a very comforting action, it wouldn't
have </B>
<P><B>bothered me if that was all that happened. </B>
<P><B>    Around ten 'o clock while my mom was resting, since she didn't
think she </B>
<P><B>was going to get much sleep, you could very faintly here a piano. In
the </B>
<P><B>morning we checked the piano to find out that it didn't play in tune,
and </B>
<P><B>half the keys didn't play at all, but the music during the night was
</B>
<P><B>beautiful. Also you could here the creaking footsteps of someone walking
</B>
<P><B>upstairs, and since my mom and I were the only people staying that
night it </B>
<P><B>kept us awake. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I think that the most exciting thing that happened from the trip, was
when </B>
<P><B>the pictures were developed. In the main entrance there is a large
mirror, </B>
<P><B>and if you take pictures of it, more often than not there is something
in the </B>
<P><B>mirror that's not there when the picture is taken.  We developed a
little </B>
<P><B>girl, one of the daughters that died in the house. But there are two
spots on </B>
<P><B>the picture that I have questions about.  I don't have a scanner but
I can </B>
<P><B>send the picture to you so that you can verify if there is something
in it or </B>
<P><B>not.  If you could please respond with an address that I can send it
to I </B>
<P><B>would appreciate it.  I hope you liked the story,</B>
<P><B>feel free to post it on your site.</B>

<P><B>Traveling Spirits</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: seamist@i-enternet.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>My name is Brenda and I have a story that you </B>
<P><B>may find interesting. As I begin to type it out..I have to wonder to
myself </B>
<P><B>where I should begin. I'll start off by saying that I have been used
as </B>
<P><B>some type of 'portal' for spirits for about 13 yrs now. It all began
when </B>
<P><B>I was about 17 years old and while my parents were going through a
</B>
<P><B>divorce. The first couple of incidences that occured didn't really
phase </B>
<P><B>me ..I moreless dismissed them as some weird kind of dream. But, later
I </B>
<P><B>realized otherwise. The first incident happened while I was sleeping
and I </B>
<P><B>had the distinct feeling that someone was 'tickling' my feet. I shrugged
</B>
<P><B>it off and fell back asleep. The second night this same thing happend
once </B>
<P><B>again. It was till morning that I remembered that strange experience
and I </B>
<P><B>thought to myself..wow..I remember someone tickling my feet..hmm..weird
I </B>
<P><B>thought to myself. Then went about my day as usual. That next night..I
was </B>
<P><B>terrified for the first time at what transpired. I was dreaming and
in my </B>
<P><B>dream I was disturbed by an angry male spirit I saw myself looking
down at the </B>
<P><B>rest of my body ..neckdown, and felt this male spirit straddled across
my </B>
<P><B>stomach. I felt instantly that this was no normal..bad dream or </B>
<P><B>nightmare..but that I could actually feel this presence and even felt
the </B>
<P><B>pressure of his knees burrowing in my bed matress. This was all happening
</B>
<P><B>in a sleep-state yet I was fully aware of the sensation occuring on
the </B>
<P><B>mattress. I said in my sleep..Please God help me..help me..The </B>
<P><B>spirit in turn responded..in an evil laugh..Hah ha ha!!! NOBODY IS
GOING </B>
<P><B>TO HELP YOU!!( I get goosebumps as I remember all of this). </B>
<P><B>Well, I was 'helped' because I was instantly woken up and released
from his </B>
<P><B>presense. From that night on until this day. I have been bothered by
</B>
<P><B>spirits but only in a dreamstate. In the past 3 or 4 yrs I have been
bothered </B>
<P><B>less frequently I am glad to say. But if I have a bad day or have an
arguement </B>
<P><B>with my husband..they come to me again and bother me. The ways they
have </B>
<P><B>bothered me are always physically in a dream state..squeezing my sides..or
</B>
<P><B>poking me with a finger,etc.</B>
<P><B>Occasionally there will be a spirit come to me </B>
<P><B>in a dreamstate and try to 'lead me away'.To where? I don't know..because
up to this point </B>
<P><B>I've been able to distinguish it as being a spirit and I've been now
</B>
<P><B>able to take control in my dream and make it let go of me by simply
refusing to </B>
<P><B>let it have it's way. Once I decide I know what it is and what it is
trying to </B>
<P><B>do..I've been able to wake up immediatly. Every night is the same ritual
for me </B>
<P><B>I say a prayer to be protected by God and ask for the Lord to encircle
me with </B>
<P><B>the holy white light so that no evil spirits may bother me while I
sleep. I draw </B>
<P><B>an imaginary 'cross sign' in the middle of my forehead while I lay
in bed and I </B>
<P><B>also sleep with scissors under my pillow. This sounds crazy and I wouldn't
tell </B>
<P><B>anyone about these things unless they too have experienced something
similiar. I </B>
<P><B>strongly feel that I 'air' some type of attraction to spirits good
and </B>
<P><B>bad. This is not something that I want ..I wish I could close the door
to </B>
<P><B>them and seal it shut. Maybe you can tell me what I can do to make
them stop </B>
<P><B>visiting me and tormenting. I don't want to spend the rest of my life
sleeping </B>
<P><B>with scissors, after all I'm only 30 yrs old..Thank </B>
<P><B>you.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Houses</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Da_Boss_03@yahoo.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>  My Grandma recently moved out of her house into a new house.  At
her old house though, there </B>
<P><B>would be weird things that would happen.  We belived that her house
was haunted by something.  </B>
<P><B>It really wasn't an old house and was built by her so no one lived
there before her but her</B>
<P><B>house and the house next to hers both had weird things happen in them.
 For example, her house </B>
<P><B>had a garage connected to it and the door opening from the garage to
the house always drug on</B>
<P><B>the carpet and was hard to close.  They would come home sometimes and
the door would be open.  </B>
<P><B>The door that was on the outside of the house was closed and locked
and since the door was hard</B>
<P><B> to open and close the wind couldn't have blown it opened.  Also, they
had an old record player </B>
<P><B>that was inside a chest like thing and it had pictures sitting on the
top of it.  In the middle</B>
<P><B>of the night it would start playing and they would go into the living
room and all the pictures </B>
<P><B>would still be on the top of it and no records would be inside.  Things
like that happened inside</B>
<P><B>that house for a long time and as far as I know up until they moved.</B>
<P><B>    The house next door to my grandma's also had some weird things
happen.  The one thing I can</B>
<P><B>remember happened before I was born.   The neighbors had a little girl
who at the time was about</B>
<P><B>two or three years old.  She was sitting on the floor playing and my
uncle was baby-sitting her.</B>
<P><B>They had a little dog and it sat up and started barking.  My uncle
did not think a thing of it</B>
<P><B>and told it to be quiet.  Then the little girl was staring into the
kitchen, which was right </B>
<P><B>next to the living room where they were, and was looking as if she
was staring at someone and </B>
<P><B>started saying, "HI".   He asked her if there was someone in there
and she said, "Yes".  He asked</B>
<P><B>, "Are you sure?" and she kept saying, "Yeah".  He went in there and
there was not a sign of </B>
<P><B>anything being in there at all. She said it was a man that was in the
kitchen but they never saw</B>
<P><B>it again or found out what it was.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The Evil Portrait</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: thewritestuff_duex@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Years ago, when I was about 13 I was spending the summer at my</B>
<P><B>grandparents. They lived in a neighborhood that had no kids save one,
a</B>
<P><B>girl near my age, about eleven or so. We took turns spending the
night</B>
<P><B>at each other's house and hung around the big back yards. Kim's house</B>
<P><B>was this big victorian number next door to my grandma's. Nothing
about</B>
<P><B>the house bothered me per se, except for this one painting that hung
in</B>
<P><B>their upstairs hall.  When you came up over the stairs Kim's room was</B>
<P><B>directly across the hall with her brother's room and the bathroom to</B>
<P><B>the right and her parent's room to the left. When you went into her</B>
<P><B>room and turned around, there on the wall right by the bathroom door</B>
<P><B>hung a 20x13 Margaret Keane portrait. (She's the lady that paints
those</B>
<P><B>kids with the HUGE black eyeballs.) At the time I knew nothing about</B>
<P><B>art and had no idea who Margaret Keane even was, all I knew was that</B>
<P><B>picture gave me the creeps. Just thinking about it still does, I know</B>
<P><B>now, many years later, that that picture was far different from any</B>
<P><B>other Keane I would ever see again.  Done with a charcoal background,</B>
<P><B>the picture showcased a solitary figure - a girl about fifteen - from
</B>
<P><B>the shoulders up. Her hair was brown and cut very, very short, she
wore</B>
<P><B>a bluish-gray top with a white collar and her expression was somber.
.</B>
<P><B>.not to mention the eyes were huge and dark, big black holes in the</B>
<P><B>middle of this kid's face. It was creepy and one always got the
feeling</B>
<P><B>that they were being watched whenever they were in Kim's room or
going</B>
<P><B>down the hall. Her brother refused to even sleep upstairs because the</B>
<P><B>picture gave him the willies. The last time I spent the night there
-</B>
<P><B>and I will never forget it because it scared the living crap out of
me</B>
<P><B>- we had stayed up late watching some movie and fell asleep in the</B>
<P><B>living room. I awoke near dawn and had to go to the bathroom. Not</B>
<P><B>giving much thought to the fact that I'd have to pass that picture
to</B>
<P><B>get to the toilet I headed up over the stairs. I was four steps up
and</B>
<P><B>turning on the landing when I felt terrified. I looked up to see a</B>
<P><B>shadow on the wall by Kim's door. I stood there, wondering if it was</B>
<P><B>Kim's mom, Judy, or was it something else? The call of nature made
up</B>
<P><B>my mind on whether or not to continue and I cautiously made my way
up</B>
<P><B>the stairs, hoping and praying it was Judy. In the early morning
light</B>
<P><B>I found the hall empty. Scared to death I slipped into the bathroom
and</B>
<P><B>clicked the lock as quick and quietly as I could. I did my business
and</B>
<P><B>wondered how the heck I was going to get back downstairs without</B>
<P><B>scaring myself again. I had just finished washing my hands when I saw</B>
<P><B>it - the knob was turning slowly back and forth, as if someone was</B>
<P><B>trying to get in. I froze for a minute, then, telling myself it was</B>
<P><B>probably Kim, I flipped the lock and opened the door way to an empty</B>
<P><B>hall. I looked up at that picture to find the eyes CLOSED! At this</B>
<P><B>point I was ready to cut and run, especially when I saw that damn</B>
<P><B>shadow again, reflecting on the wall from inside Kim's room.
Something</B>
<P><B>was not right and I wasn't about to stick around and find out what
it</B>
<P><B>was. I ran back downstairs, hiding beneath a blanket until everyone</B>
<P><B>else got up. I made my way back upstairs to collect my stuff to find</B>
<P><B>the picture's eyes were again open (I knew I wasn't seeing things,</B>
<P><B>those eyes were gigantic, it would be impossible to mistake them
being</B>
<P><B>open or closed). As I was coming out of the bedroom I stopped to
stare</B>
<P><B>at that evil picture, I don't know how I knew, but I knew that it was
a</B>
<P><B>terrible portrait and there was a lot of evil behind it. Judy came
up</B>
<P><B>behind me and commented on how sad the girl looked, and then she
stated</B>
<P><B>on why she'd bought it: "the poor thing looked like it had lost its</B>
<P><B>very soul". I had to agree, it didn't have a soul all right! The look</B>
<P><B>in those eyes was the darkest, most evil glare I could ever recall</B>
<P><B>seeing and it made every hair on my body stand upright. That picture</B>
<P><B>was looking right at ME and it felt like I was being PULLED towards
it.</B>
<P><B>Judy spoke to me again and the pull stopped, I turned to talk to her</B>
<P><B>and felt whatever it was watching me. The phone rang and Judy went
to</B>
<P><B>answer it, leaving me with that horrid picture, I turned back to it
to</B>
<P><B>find two tiny pinpoints of red in the middle of those dark, black
eyes.</B>
<P><B>I'd seen this picture hundreds of times at this point and I knew
there</B>
<P><B>was no red in those eyes. That was it for me, I told Kim I had to go</B>
<P><B>and I got the hell out as fast as possible. I never spent another
night</B>
<P><B>with Kim after that, we grew up. . .we both got married and had kids,</B>
<P><B>seeing each other on occasion. One time, after Judy's death, I made
it</B>
<P><B>a point to ask Kim what had happened to the picture. She told me that</B>
<P><B>when they'd built a house in the country when she was in high school,</B>
<P><B>they'd hung the picture in their new living room and it didn't seem
to</B>
<P><B>apppreciate its new home. The picture would never stay up, constantly</B>
<P><B>falling to the floor. Finally, tired of rehanging it, they put it
into</B>
<P><B>storage and weird things started happening - footsteps in the attic,</B>
<P><B>things moving around up there by themselves - a highly suspicious and</B>
<P><B>old world Catholic, her father took the painting - a Keane original</B>
<P><B>purchased at the start of the artist's career - and attempted to burn</B>
<P><B>it in their field. Only thing was - it WOULDN"T burn. They doused it</B>
<P><B>with gasoline, stuck it in a grill with charcoal - it didn't even get</B>
<P><B>soot covered. About that time her brother, Mark, hosed the picture</B>
<P><B>down, frame and all, bagged it up, weighted it down and threw it over
a</B>
<P><B>bridge. After that all the strange occurences stopped and her mother</B>
<P><B>refused to purchase any more paintings. This was twenty odd years ago</B>
<P><B>now, and I've seen hundreds of Keanes over the years. They were the</B>
<P><B>rage of the seventies and early nineties. People even have sites</B>
<P><B>dedicated to the artist - but I've never seen a copy of that picture,</B>
<P><B>nor have I ever gotten the same bizarre feelings of paranoia around</B>
<P><B>Keane portraits. No one knows where Kim's mom purchased the painting,</B>
<P><B>nor do they know the history that accompanied it - all we DO know,
is</B>
<P><B>that it was evil and carried something unexplainable with it.</B>

<P><B>WHO WAS THE GHOST?</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: portsmom@webtv.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>   This story is a bit different than most storys. My father died March
31st 1985. My story </B>
<P><B>happened in June of that yr. I had been playing around with astral
projection</B>
<P><B>But not on this night.  I was in bed asleep. when I felt like I was
sucked out of my body,</B>
<P><B>and I was floating by the ceiling. I could see the whole room. I noticed
the clock read 2:30.                                                    
Then i was</B>
<P><B>I was sucked out of my house and ended up in my parents living room
. It was</B>
<P><B>dark so I turned on the light. And I saw my father looking out the
front</B>
<P><B>door. I asked him what he was doing ? He said waiting for the dog to</B>
<P><B>come in. (my dog had died 2yrs. before my father. At this point my
Mom woke up . And I asked </B>
<P><B>her if my Dad knew he was dead ? She said sure he does . Then she asked
me why I was at her </B>
<P><B>house at 2:30 in the morning ? And if there was something wrong. I
said no ,</B>
<P><B>but asked her why  my dad was there again and if she saw him. Her
answer</B>
<P><B>was yes again . She then told me when I left to turn out the light
in</B>
<P><B>the living room. And went back to bed. Next thing I knew I hit my bed
with such force it woke</B>
<P><B> my hubby ( which is almost impossible) Ok so I was confused to say
the least.</B>
<P><B>The next morning I went to my Moms house. And my Mom asked me what
I was</B>
<P><B>there for at 2:30 in the morning?  SO I asked her what clothes I had
on?</B>
<P><B>Well she told me exactly what I had on , so I told her what she had
on</B>
<P><B>too. But she didn't remember seeing my Dad. But she was a little mad
I</B>
<P><B>didn't turn out the light like she had asked me too.</B>
<P><B>My hubby told her I hadn't left the house and how I bounced on the
bed</B>
<P><B>enough to wake him up at 2:35 and how upset I was when he asked me
what</B>
<P><B>was going on the night before.        Well I guess the light being
on</B>
<P><B>proved to my Mom I was there plus each desribing the others clothes
as</B>
<P><B>well.                                                             But
my</B>
<P><B>question is which one of us was the ghost? Or were my Father and me
both</B>
<P><B>ghosts??? If anyone has any answers  I'd love to hear them!</B>

<P><B>Hi Dave,</B>
<P><B>There really isn't much to my story, but here it is.</B>
<P><B>The first time I saw my '"ghost" was nearly 17 yrs ago.  At the time,
I</B>
<P><B>was a newlywed 20 year old.  My husband was working the night shift,
and</B>
<P><B>I was home, alone, as none of our children had yet been born.  </B>
<P><B>It was just a feeling of being watched as I lay in bed trying to fall</B>
<P><B>asleep.  When I peeked from the corner of my eye, I saw the figure
of a</B>
<P><B>man standing beside me.  His facial features were quite clear.  Not</B>
<P><B>knowing who or what he was, I swung my fist at him and yelled, "What
do</B>
<P><B>you want?!"  He was gone before my fist was back at my side.</B>
<P><B>After that, I never saw him until about two to three years ago.  Now,
l</B>
<P><B>don't see such distinct features, more just a sense of movement going
up</B>
<P><B>and down the staircase every now and then.  But, about three nights
ago,</B>
<P><B>my keys, which had been beside me on the same table for several
hours,</B>
<P><B>suddenly fell over.  There was no one here with me.  And, I had been</B>
<P><B>seeing the shadow on the staircase again that night.</B>
<P><B>As a point of interest, the first time I saw him, after he left and
I</B>
<P><B>thought about what had taken place, I realized that the facial
features</B>
<P><B>I had seen looked just like my husband's grandfather.  I never knew
the</B>
<P><B>man personally, he died in 1976, and my husband and I didn't meet
until</B>
<P><B>1981.  However, what I saw, resembled a picture we had of him in our</B>
<P><B>living room at the time.  He used to live in this very house, and did</B>
<P><B>many home repairs in his lifetime, it was like a hobby to him.  I
think</B>
<P><B>he's back and wanting to do more.</B>
<P><B>He never causes any harm, and no one but me ever sees him, which l
find</B>
<P><B>interesting since I never knew him, and his own grandson doesn't see</B>
<P><B>him.</B>
<P><B>I guess that's all there is to tell.  I don't quite know what to
think</B>
<P><B>of it.  Is it real, or just my imagination?</B>
<P><B>Thank you.</B>

<P><B>Ghost in my Bedroom</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: jmaterne@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> When I was a child of about nine </B>
<P><B>years, 1972, my family and I lived in an old house that is located
in the north </B>
<P><B>end of the city. This area of town is now called The Garden </B>
<P><B>District and just about every home in this district is 100+ years </B>
<P><B>old. The home in which we lived was built </B>
<P><B>in 1865 by a rather wealthy man.&amp;nbsp; It was built as a gift to
his new </B>
<P><B>bride. I'm not sure of how it later exchanged hands but at the time
we </B>
<P><B>moved in, the house had been sub-divided into apartments. I would guess
</B>
<P><B>that originally the home had somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 or
40 </B>
<P><B>rooms. Massive to say the least. Behind this mansion the new owner
had </B>
<P><B>placed a couple of mobile homes to rent out in addition to the apartments
in the </B>
<P><B>main house. My father was a mechanic and didn't make much money so
he </B>
<P><B>opted to rent one of these trailers for us. We did later move in to
the </B>
<P><B>main house but that's another series of stories. One day after about
the second month </B>
<P><B>we were there, my father took me, my two brothers and our mom to spend
the day </B>
<P><B>at the beach. I suppose it was a Saturday because my father was never
home </B>
<P><B>during the week and usually slept all day Sunday. I recall coming home
</B>
<P><B>late that evening with the worst sunburn I had ever experienced. No
one </B>
<P><B>was spared from that misery. My brothers and our mom and dad were cooked
</B>
<P><B>also. I mention this fact because my father used this extreme </B>
<P><B>sunburn as the excuse to downplay what happened that night.Let me just
say this: I am a very </B>
<P><B>cynical person and I was just as cynical and jaded at the age of 9
as I am </B>
<P><B>now. I am what's known as a critical thinker In other </B>
<P><B>words, if you can't prove it to me and if it lacks all logic and reason,
then it </B>
<P><B>just ain't so. I had zero imagination as a child. I had no invisible
</B>
<P><B>friends and I never partook of the typical silly kid's games that my
peers </B>
<P><B>seemed to so much enjoy. On this Saturday evening, after a </B>
<P><B>good rub down with butter for our sunburns (I know but we didn't know
any better </B>
<P><B>back then) my brothers and I were off to bed. I'm guessing it was around
</B>
<P><B>8:00 PM. My brothers were totally exhausted and they quickly passed
</B>
<P><B>out. I, on the other hand, decided to lay awake and listen to the little
</B>
<P><B>party my parents had going in the living room. They had invited a few
</B>
<P><B>friends over. Now my brothers and myself all slept in the same bed.
</B>
<P><B>My father couldn't afford to run air conditioning so we would open
the window </B>
<P><B>above our bed to allow the breeze to flow through our </B>
<P><B>room. As I lay there that evening listening </B>
<P><B>to the snoring of my brothers and my parent's party, a very stiff and
cold </B>
<P><B>breeze blew through the window over my bed. This was like July or August
</B>
<P><B>in Louisiana and that wind felt like something from Alaska in mid-winter!
</B>
<P><B>Very icy cold. It blew so hard that it made the curtains slap hard
against </B>
<P><B>the ceiling. This breeze lasted for about 5 seconds. I took note of
</B>
<P><B>its unusualness and went back to listening to the party.Have you ever
been in a bed when </B>
<P><B>someone walks by it and just bumps it? Well that's exactly what the
bed </B>
<P><B>did. It shook ever so slightly. Like someone had just brushed up </B>
<P><B>against it. I looked at my little brothers thinking that maybe one
of them </B>
<P><B>had moved in their sleep but they were motionless. I paid it no </B>
<P><B>mind. Then, a few minutes later, it happened again but this time it
felt </B>
<P><B>as though someone had basically kicked the bed. It shook very </B>
<P><B>violently. This frightened me and once again I watched my little brothers
</B>
<P><B>closely. Keep in mind that the bedroom door was closed and no one could
</B>
<P><B>have come in there without me seeing them. As I lay there and watched
my </B>
<P><B>brothers, the bed began to shake very hard. So hard that the headboard
was </B>
<P><B>knocking against the wall. My brothers weren't causing this. I could
</B>
<P><B>see them laying there totally motionless. Out of total fear I whispered
</B>
<P><B>very forcefully stop it and the bed stopped. About 30 seconds </B>
<P><B>later it began to shake again and again I said stop it and again, </B>
<P><B>the bed stopped shaking. I was on the verge of tears when it began
to </B>
<P><B>shake again but this time when I said Stop it it kept on </B>
<P><B>shaking. The bed shook quite violently for about a minute and then
</B>
<P><B>stopped. Then....the really scary part. As I lay there in total fear
</B>
<P><B>and confusion, I heard soft footsteps walking along the edge of the
bed. </B>
<P><B>Before I could react, I saw the edge of the mattress next to my head
depress as </B>
<P><B>if someone had sat down on the bed. Before I could react, something
</B>
<P><B>brushed my forhead. I sat bolt upright in the bed and began to scream
for </B>
<P><B>my parents. Suddenly the cold breeze that had blown the curtains against
</B>
<P><B>the ceiling was now blowing them hard against the screen as if IT </B>
<P><B>was leaving very quickly. Of course my parents, along with </B>
<P><B>their fellow partyers, held me and babied me but they didn't believe
a word of </B>
<P><B>it. My father said that I was just hallucinating from the effects of
such </B>
<P><B>a violent sunburn. Yeah, right In my defense, once we moved into </B>
<P><B>the main house, they believed every word of what I told them that
transpired </B>
<P><B>that evening. They began to experience unbelievable things in that
</B>
<P><B>house. But...that's another story or stories.</B>
