<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The Mirror (Ghost Story)</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: lunarxmagic@gmail.com </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My name is Pete, Im 14 but this story took place when I was
12. My grandfather is in the scrapping/hauling business and often helped
businesses clean out there old junk, but he liked to take little things that
they were going to throw out that he thought might be useful. I had been
complaining that I needed a mirror for my room. It just so happened that my
grandfather was called in to clean out a clothing store. My grandpa cleaned up
their building and came upon a mirror, he asked if he could take it and the
manager eagerly told him he could take it, we would soon find out why the
manager was so happy to be rid of it. The mirror as a full length mirror with a
beautiful, what I think, was mahogony, frame. It was a great mirror but had one
very big flaw that my grandfather had not noticed; you could not clearly see
yourself in the mirror. When you looked into the mirror everything was
completely blurry, like in those Claritin commercials. My grandpa dismissed it
and said someone probably did something wrong when making the mirror and that
he could throw it out for me. Im not quite sure why but I wanted the mirror
anyways, I told him, "No, itll be fine, I mean its not that bad and I just
need to be able to see if my clothes match" A few days went by and I used
the mirror just to see if the color of my shirt matched the color of my jeans,
because that was pretty much all you could see; color. One day I was trying to
look past color and see what my new hoodie looked like on me, while looking
deepy I noticed something that should have been noticed from the get-go but its
a mistake we all make; I never noticed the things in the mirror around me, just
myself. Everything in the background was clear, just the image of yourself was
distorted in the mirror. It was so weird, like something out of the twilight or
something. Somehow I managed to put it out of my mind, I mean I didnt see the
harm a mirror could do. I went to school and all that other not so fun stuff
that I had to do, then returned to my room, sat on the bed and began trying to
get a rock out of the bottom of my shoe, it was stuck in one of the little
rubber grooves. I managed to pry the rock out and it went flying across the
room and hit the mirror, it was a very suttle crack in the top left hand corner
of the mirror. I didnt throw the mirror out though because it was just a small
crack, and for some reason I still felt drawn to the freaky mirror. I put on my
iPod and went to sleep. The next morning I woke up and got dressed then looked
in the mirror. This was the first extremely strange event; the crack in the
corner was gone, it was completely repaired, it was like the crack had never
existed. I quickly turned the mirror around because I no longer wanted to look
at it, but I was so strangely fascinated by it that I still failed to throw it
out. I returned home from school that evening to find the mirror facing the
right way again, I simply figured my mom did it. I sat on the bed and began my
homework. Have you ever walked into one of those glass walls in a fun house,
how it seems to vibrate in its frame and make a really weird like
"Boi-oi-oing" sound? Well that is exactly what I heard, I looked
around and saw nothing out of place, but in the corner of my eye I saw a
reflection in the mirror. I looked over at the mirror and all of a sudden I
seen two translucent palms smack the glass on the mirror, and heard the
"bo-oi-oing" sound again. I jumped up. It happened again, I watched
as the glass shook in the frame, I flung my ball point pen at the mirror, not
quite sure how it was going to help but hoping it would, straight at the
mirror. A large crack appeared in the mirror and spread down the middle of the
mirror until it reached the north and south edges of the frame, this is the
super freaky part...The mirror seemed to explode at me, I closed my eyes and
shielded my face, I could feel the little glass shard slashing my hands. When I
felt all the glass had fell I opened my eyes and looked at my hands to see the
damage; they were fine, my hands didnt seem to have so much as a scratch on
them. I looked at the mirror and saw no crack, no visible damage whatsoever.
This was the final straw, I tied up the mirror to my bike and grabbed a shovel,
I headed to the cemetary which wasnt far from my house. I entered the cemetary,
I didnt care who could see me, luckily noone was around, I began to dig a hole,
it took me about a half an hour to make a suitable hole but i finally did. I
thrust the mirror into the hole, making sure to brake it but not allow any of
the pieces to get outside the hole. Ah to see that mirror actually shattered
was an amazing feeling. I began placing the dirt over the mirror, this took all
but 15 minutes, I stomped on the dirt to make sure the grave was like sealed.
The mirror was out of my life, and it has been ever since. I really wonder what
was in that mirror, I know this story sounds extremely unreal, or perhaps it
seems like I'm crazy, but I assure you that what happened to me was real, even
though I wish it were all a bad dream. The other oddity is, in the exac spot
where I buried the mirror; a tree grew. It's no normal tree, it seems to remain
in perfect health although most of the trees in that cemetary are dead or
extremely unhealthy. And when looking at the base of the tree, there are two
knots that look like hands, just as I had seen smacking against the glass. I
wish you could see it but Im not giving any information on its location for
fear that someone may find the mirror, probably fixed, and for the ultimate
fear that what ever is in that mirror will be let out.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: charlene@sourcee.com </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi, first I want to say that I love your web site and have
read every story on it. I did send a story about going up in my house in
Pepperell Ma. that was haunted by this ghost named Charlie now I wanted to
write a little about my brothers ex girlfriend (Rhonda) and her sister
(Carryann) that was killed by her evil boyfriend.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I say her boyfriend is evil because when I had met him for
the first and last time they had been staying at my brothers for a night and
then going back to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and he was so very<span style="">&nbsp; </span>creepy!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was partying with everyone until Carryann's boyfriend had
woken up and he gave me the creeps so bad that I had to leave and wouldn't go
back over until he fell asleep again. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I told Rhonda that I thought that he was a bad person and
that the vibes I was getting were really bad and that I just thought that he
was evil... she said she thought he was too and that she never liked him.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I'm really good at reading people if I don't feel
comfortable around a person then I know they can't be trusted but this went
beyond feeling uncomfortable.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>At work one day I received a call from my mother saying that
Carryann was killed by her boyfriend. She had planned on leaving <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> but
couldn't find her card to leave and she needed that to go through the boarder.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I think that he had found out that she was planning on
leaving and in a drunken rage hit her on her head with a bat and then strangled
her to death. She had a big head wound and he did strangle her... she was a
strong healthy person so we think she would have put up a fight but not if she
was knocked out. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I just broke down and cried... that poor girl had such a
hard life. They lived on the reservation and it is a hard life for them all.
They don't have allot of job opportunities and they drunk allot because there
is really nothing much to do there other wise. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well she drank and drank until she was so drunk that people
would take advantage of her (men) and the girls mostly didn't like her because
of it.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>After work that day I
went and bought all her sisters and myself teddy bears they were all different
colors but the same kind of bear (mine was maroon) and I was crying on the way
home and told Carryann that I was so sorry that he did that to her and that she
didn't deserve it. I also said that I had bought them all a teddy bear and the
one that was mine was really for her but that I would keep it for her. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It just really broke my heart that she had almost gotten
away from him if she had not lost her card she would have left the day before
he killed her. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I had given the teddy bears to her sisters and we all cried
together and I kept the one that I was for Carryann and I put it up on my
entertainment center. A couple of days later it was gone. I never did see it
again so I think that Carryann took it!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One day my boyfriend and I were playing a game of dice and
we started talking about Carryann and he was saying mean things like she was a
drunk and I told him to shut up that she had a drinking problem but she was a
very sweet person that loved children and I was kicking his butt in dice. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I said Carryann is helping me kick your butt because you're
saying mean things about her... I said the only way that you have a chance in
winning would be if you got all six of the same dice. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well we went in the other room to have a cigarette break and
when we came back all the dice were changed to all ones! He was like you did
that... I said no dummy I was with you remember!!! I said see she's letting us
know that she is here so you better say you're sorry! He did!!! </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Rhonda was having a baby with my brother and we had a baby
shower for her. Well at her baby shower when she was opening her gifts we all
heard someone say WOW and it sounded like Carryann and everyone in the room
heard it and it wasn't any of us that said it! </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It was Thanksgiving and I was in the kitchen when I felt a
cold breeze go right through me. I thought oh my brother must have his door
open then I realized he didn't and there was no windows open either. I knew then
it was Carryann. I went into the other room and my mother said she thinks that
Carryann was visiting and then I told her about the cold breeze!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We (my brother, Rhonda, me and my boyfriend) were watching
the football game and we all really get into football. I was like Carryann give
us luck we know your here with us but give us a sign and the picture that she
had given Rhonda fell off the wall!!! The Pat's won the game that night too! </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My brother had broken up with Rhonda and now my baby niece
who I miss and love with all my heart is in Canada with her mother hopefully I
will be seeing them soon but anyway he had another girlfriend Katie that was
staying with him and her first time sleeping in Rhonda's bed without my brother
sleeping next to her she said she felt someone pushing her out of the bed! </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It happened seven times until she said fine I'm leaving and
went and slept on the couch with my brother. She would not sleep in that bed
alone again!!! </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Carryann's mother was told by Physic that Carryann was around
for a while because she was angry that she was murdered but she was finally at
peace. I think that they can come and visit when the want to but nothing has
happened lately. Hope you liked the story it is all true.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>hi my name is kat and i was a sailor on the ship the uss
kitty hawk i cant tell you that much about the history but i can tell you from
first had experience its haunted. i know it was burned down at some point and
rebuilt from parts of the constellation so not only could it be haunted from
the original parts of the ship also can be haunted from constellation parts on
it. How do i know its haunted you may ask well one night cleaning the floors in
the mess decks the draws and cabinets kept opening no matter how many times i
closed them so then i was like ok maybe the sway of the ship is opening them
before i realized they have a locking mechanism to them to prevent the sway
from opening them the only way to open them would be to really pull them open i
was freaked to say the least but never said anything to anyone about a 2 wk's
later i was in a unused freezer cleaning it for storage use and a very chilling
air started to sweep back and fourth through the air kept making me shiver i
how ever once again in my head came up with reasons but the freezer isn't on
anymore had not been used in years as a freezer its was storage for dry goods
and paper goods. Another time in the same freezer i could hear the adjoining
freezer door creak open however its also a unused freezer and the only other
person down there with me was asleep on the stair well </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In the dry storage area i was painting i returned the next
night to find my paint spilled over and brushes laying out i was the only one with
keys to the area </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>i finally mentioned to one of my senior chefs and he told me
that those freezers i was so spooked in actually in war time way back when was
used as a morgue<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the cabinets that
were opening and closing was cause by a chief that was on the ship who food
poisoned himself and many fellow sailors so bad that many passed away </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>there was also i little girl that was lost on a tour and
never found </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>they say that the broiler rooms and engine rooms are
extremely haunted and some of the berthing's this i believe cause even in my
three short years on the kitty there was three deaths </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>one from a guy who fell to his death rolling out of top bunk
and breaking his neck </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>another i was part of trying to rescue ia mechincist<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a pipe busted in a engine room and he
drowned </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>there was also a huge fire in which a sailor died</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>if i in just three years was witness to all this i can only
imagine how haunted it really is </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>there's also rumor that theres a huge hole from a long long
time ago that was sealed off in it there is opposed to be body's and a car of a
caption and his prized positions he couldn't bear to leave behind </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>its a place worth looking into especially since the kltty
hawk will be getting decommissioned this year </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>im so sorry about grammar and spelling </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have recently come across your web site and i thought i
would let you no what happened to me? I have kept this a secret for over
45years now and i think its now time to tell. When i was a child of 9 years old
i was invited by my auntie and uncle to go on a weeks holiday to <st1:City w:st="on">Cornwall</st1:City> in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> for 7 days. We were to stay
in a caravan while we were there.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>During that week i befriended a boy about my age and his
family were staying in a chalet</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On the last night there was a film on tv that we both wanted
to watch and as the tv sets were only in chalets i asked my aunt/uncle could i
stay and watch it with my friend? They both agreed on the proviso that i came
straight back as soon as the film had finished..</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After the film had finished i started to make my way back to
our caravan, Half way along the chalet block there was a large gap with a high
wall at the end were all the rubbish was placed in the bins, </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>As i passed the gap i noticed something out of the corner of
my eye, i looked around and saw what looked to be a large semi circular object
that was brown in colour and seemed to be off the floor as i could see the back
wall under it,</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I don't remember much after that until i woke up back in our
caravan, I had soiled my trousers and wet myself and didn't no how i got there
nor did my family they found me laying on the floor outside the caravan.. I was
told to go to bed and forget about it until tomorrow.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The following morning we were going home and my uncle bought
the local paper to read on the journey, after a while he said to me, do you
remember that thing you saw last night? i said yes and started to cry again,
don't worry he said, then leaning over the car seat he showed a photograph of
an church alter, and in the corner was the exact figure i saw the night before
in the alleyway between the chalet block? It was thought to be that of a 900yr
old monk in the praying position maybe that was why i couldn't see his feet?
who has been seen on numerous occasions..<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although 45yrs later i actually live near the church in newquey i am
still very reluctant to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>visit<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>An Interesting Experience</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: hayden893@btinternet.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>THIS HAPPENED TO ME IN THE SUMMER OF 2005, it happened in
May, around the time of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my birthday. I
decided to take the week off and pay a visit to <st1:place w:st="on">Fort
 Nelson</st1:place>, the royal armouries museum on the outskirts of Portsmouth
(UK).</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This is a fort built to mount artillery in the 19th cantury,
around the time of the American civil war, it was built to aid the defence of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Portsmouth</st1:City></st1:place> against a
resurgance of power<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and percieved threat
from the Franch at the time.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In the fort itself there are several tunnels that lead to
gun batteries on the edge of the fort, only one of these is open to the public
though, this also leads to the magazines where shells for the guns were stored.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On this day there were few people around as it was a mid
week work day. There was a light breeze comming off the sea and as I decided to
explore this tunnel on my own I noticed that the breeze grew stronger as I got
close to the magazine.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Once inside the tunnels I started to get the feeling that I
was not alone as it appeared and I turned around to look at where I'd come
from. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>There was no one there with me.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In the corridor of the tunnel I came to the magazine rooms,
these all had large heavy wooden doors on them. There were tree of these doors and
all were pushed closed but not latched shut, I had the same feeling of a
presence again and turned to check behind me, at that point the breeze turned
to a rush of air pasing me for a second.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I initially thought it was a gust from the surface but one of
the large doors began to open, the reason this surprised me was that it was
against the flow of the breeze in the tunnel.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was a little apprehensive but not really scared and
decided to call out to see if there was ay one there, no answer.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>At that point I thought that someone was playing a trick so
took a step to find who was playing with the door, as I did, it slowly closed
and the next door slowly opened against the breeze.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I decided to ask if whatever was there minded if I took some
photos, the door stopped moving.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The camera I used was a small 35mm film camera, I took three
photos along the corridor.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The first was completely black as if the lens cover hadn't
opened, the second showed the door slowly closing and the third showed what
appeared to be a shadow or faint human shape at the end of the corridor against
the entrance to the corridor.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I knew nothing of
this till I had the photos developed, all I knew was I'd had an experience with
something that I think was paranormal.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Just after this I came across a guide in the gun battery at
the end of the tunnel and I was about to ask if the site was haunted, when I
noticed that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she was leading a group of
kids around, I chose not to mention it in front of them.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I asked another guide covering the gate about ghosts on the
site, she said no one was really sure but there was a rumour that the ghost of
a worker who died in an accident whilest the fort was being built, was supposed
to inhabit the tunnels.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Perhaps this is what I came across?</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In Southport North <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Carolina</st1:place></st1:City>,
Capt. Charles Swain manned the bald head lighthouse untill ir was
decommisioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon rettireing Capt.
Charlie settled in to a life of leisure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Over the years while working on bald head island he had salveged wood
from wrecked ships to build a house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
house wad owned by my faimly for about 6 or 7 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reputation of the home can be easily be
heard from any resident in <st1:place w:st="on">Southport</st1:place>.
"Capt. Charlie's House" is a known "Haunted House" through
out the area. When lilving there many occorences of unexplined things
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much of the furniture in the
home was orignal from the estate of Capt. Charlie's Inculding a particular
rocking chair which Capt. Charlie would sit in and watch the ships go by on the
intercostal waterway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rocker has
the tendincy to be rocking by itself, as if someone just got up, when noone has
been in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the main sitting parlor
which has 6 windows, the blinds have a habit of going up by themselfs all 6 at
once. Footsteps can be heard up stairs when noone is up there,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on one occasion a witness saw full body
appirations. Both Capt. Charlie and his wife spent most of their lives in this
home.and died here. It seems to me that they decided to stay at the home they
loved so much. The home has a secure feeling, the feeling of being watched is
always present, but it's not a evil or bad feelin, it's like your being watched
over, protected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things which have been
lost suddenly reappear in ovious places, things get moved just enough to
notice, lastly when you start talking about Capt. Charlie or the Baldhead
lighthouse activity increases like Capt.Charlie is getting excited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The home is now privatly owned by an aquantince
of the faimly, I don't know if any activity still occurs but I don't see why It
would stop as the house seems to draw them and they seem to me to be very happy
in their home watching over the people who live there. One last thought, the
home was built of timbers of ships which wrecked many of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>which had much loss of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could all those whose life were lost have
been imprinted on all those timbers</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>giving the house itself a "Haunted" feeling? Who
knows. I do know that two sprits reside in the home and they seem very
happy<span style="">&nbsp; </span>caring for the residents!</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi. I just stumbled across your site &amp; thought I would
share my story. I am a total unbeliever of ghosts &amp; the afterlife (although
I would love to be proved wrong) &amp; believe there's a scientific explanation
for everything. What happened to my girlfriend of the time &amp; myself in 1992
has left me scratching my head though.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We were both living with our parents still at the time. I
was 21 &amp; she was 18. Some nights we parked the car in various locations
just for somewhere to go &amp; the night in question, we parked up down a
country lane in a village called Ratby just west of <st1:place w:st="on">Leicester</st1:place>.
</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We were parked a mile down a deserted path under a large
tree with a hedge with a gate behind us &amp; open fields in front. It was
after midnight when all of a sudden, the car lit up as if someone had switched
a light on. About 10 feet to the right of the car, a large fire had shot up out
of nothing in the grass. My girlfriend was obviously scared &amp; saying lets
get away from here but I had to satisfy my curiosity &amp; find out what caused
it. Looking back, I maybe should've drove away immediately but I got out &amp;
looked up the tree, went through the gate in the hedge &amp; checked all around
thinking maybe some kids were trying to freak us out but I satisfied myself
there was nobody about. We just drove off &amp; left the fire burning.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have tried to explain it away to satisfy my mind. Could a
spark have ignited dried grass? Could it have been a discarded cigarette etc.
The grass was wet as it was drizzling that night &amp; although my ex smoked,
she swore she wasn't the cause &amp; it wasn't something that smouldered &amp;
grew bigger anyway. It suddenly appeared about 3-4 feet high in a flash
seemingly from nothing.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I just sort of
happend upon your site and thought to share some of my own experiences.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In my short 18 years here on earth, I have experienced quite
a few.. well some tell me thats a bit of an understatment.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Although there are a couple that have really stuck in my
mind, in this email I will only mention one. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was fifteen when this occurence happend.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The first one happened in the summer of 2005, in a little
trailer in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Jaffrey</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">British Columbia</st1:State></st1:place>.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Before I start my story I have to say that the Uncle
mentioned had passed away in 1997, due to overdose. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My mother and I had gone out there to visit my Grandparents
for a few days, just to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>While staying with them (my grandparents) my mother sleep in
her old bedroom and i sleep in their old computer room.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>So during one night there, I had been reading ghost story
books and as it neared about 10 pm I decided I would turn the light out and try
and sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out sleep was
near impossible because I had freaked myself out so bad. A half an hour later I
crept to my mothers room and asked her to sleep in my room with me, seeing as
the bed I sleep in is significantly larger. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>So as she fell asleep, I finally started drifiting off not
long after. While I was in that in-between-state of awake and sleep I felt as
though, someone was standing directly above me, so in this state I opened my
eyes to a pitch black room save for this figure I had felt. I could see what he
was wearing (cowboy boots, jeans, a jean long sleeve collared shirt with the
sleeves rolled up to the elbows) and I remember him saying "don't worry
it's only us" and I looked over to my right and there sort of arguing with
eachother were my two uncles who are still to this day alive and kicking. Just
as I was looking back I physically felt the sheets being tucked up around my
neck, (to let you know, I had left them down at my waist because it was
unbelievable hot) this sort of spooked me a bit into wakeing up. Thinking it
was my mother who had done that I quickly looked over to find her sound asleep
not having moved an inch from the time I had fallen asleep. a few minutes after
calming myself down I myself fell back to sleep.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The next morning I told my mother about my dream and after I
had explained what the man was wearing, she got this sort of shocked look on
her face, and told me that was what my Uncle Greg used to wear. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>To this day I still have little things happen to me in that
room that we sort of attribute to my Uncle Greg and his sick and weird sense of
humour.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Thank you for taking
the time to build a site like this one, where people like us can share our own
ghostly happenings.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My grandfather had his house built in the Holiday Hills
Neighborhood I believe he was the 3rd house for the new neighborhood. Upon his
second wife&#8217;s death due to a nasty incurable disease (tumors) I believe she
died about 1978-1979 I was so young I don&#8217;t truly remember the year. But the
important part is that WE believe my Grandmother Nancy haunted the house after
her death. We returned to live with our grandfather in the meantime my mother
had gotten pregnant with our little sister who was born in Feb.1981. She never
saw pictures of grandmother and we never told her of us seeing grandmother as
the years past and our sister turned 2 or 3 she ran crying to our mom about a
lady lying in papaw&#8217;s bed and demanded to know who she was. We would see her
when passing their bedroom either lying on her side of the bed or sitting in
what we think was her favorite chair. Now later in years when our Great Aunt
got sick our mother cared for her til her death in this same house different
room where she was wheelchair bound she had a cowbell to ring when she wanted
or needed anything when she was in her room. Upon her death after they came to
take her body the cowbell was ringing and lying on the bed our mother had it on
the dresser to get out of the way when they where removing her body. Now after
all this if you don&#8217;t believe, read this last one after my grandfathers death
the house was sold my little brother still tend the yard work until the new
occupants moved in. After letting them get settled in my little brother
returned to speak to the new owners about continuing to do the yard work, the
Lady of the house then proceed to inform him that they were reselling the house
because their little child was seeing an older big tall gentleman in a dark
green suit wondering the house. My little Brother then informed her that they
did not have to be scared that it was just our grandfather. He was almost 7 ft
tall and before taking ill weighted a good 350 plus pounds and most scary part was
he was buried in a dark olive green suit. We have not stayed in touch with any
of the other occupants or buyers since then so I don&#8217;t know if they still haunt
that house or not I like to believe that the new occupants understand that the
house was built for them and I hope they continue to reside there even in
death.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Knocking From An Empty Room</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: ichibanhuguenor@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I wanted to write in regards to the "urban myth"
status of Mariposa Elementary in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Redlands</st1:City>
 <st1:State w:st="on">California</st1:State></st1:place>. In 2003 myself and
two friends went to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Redlands</st1:City></st1:place>
to check out a number of places we found on your site. We went to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Prospect</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, the Hillside Cemetary and Mariposa
Elementary (roughly in that order). To this day the only thing that I can say
was anything like a true experience of a 'ghost' or anything of that nature was
at Mariposa Elementary. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Upon finding the place we walked around for a while, looking
for the nurse's office and generally checking things out. We went to the
playground since the entry had mentioned something about the swingset, but
nothing came of that. After a while we found a building that we tought was the
nurse's office so I knocked on the wall. Nothing happened, so I tried again
before deciding that it probably wasn't the right place. Finally, we found the
office and walked around it, checking it out. The backside of the office is
almost entirely windows, so you can see into the office quite easily, and we
could tell that there wasn't anyone in there. We went back to the front and my
friend Alex knocked on the wall (which was much more resonant than the one I
had knocked on). He knocked three times, with a fair amount of space between
the knocks. What happened was a prolonged silence followed by three very loud,
very distinct knocks back from the inside (which, emperically, had already
proven to be empty). We all got that undeniable chill and my eyes started to
water (as seems to happen when I get scared) and we booked it across the field
and out of there. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>What everyone asks me is if it was simply an echo, but the
nature of the time between his knocks and the returned knocks was something
which easily defeated that explanation. The idea of a custodian being in an
unlit, clearly empty, school nurse's office at 2.30 in the morning could only
be accounted for if he had been sleeping there...behind a box or
something...with the intent on scaring kids. I can't possibly reconcile that
idea. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I'm not saying that this is a bona fide ghost or anything,
but I think it deserves to be bumped above the "urban myth" status
simply because of my first hand experience.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunting in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Kellyton</st1:City>,

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In the 1970's my grandparents lived in an old farmhouse
located in rural <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Kellyton</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Alabama</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a child I spent MANY holidays, summers and any vacation time
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The house had a semi-circular driveway made of gravel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concrete steps led up to the wooden full
porch, to the front door.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I slept with my grandmother on these trips to our "old
home place".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grandmother's bedroom
was located at the front of the house, with the porch right outside her window.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>At night when we would go to bed is when the activity would
begin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we lay in the darkness, we
would hear a car<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pull up on the gravel
drive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very audible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next, we would hear the car stop and the car
door would open and close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could
hear the door close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of this was
followed by footsteps on the gravel drive, then footsteps on the sidewalk;
until eventually you would hear the footsteps on the porch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pacing back and forth across the porch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, the ghost would sit on the porch
swing and swing for awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It never
tried to scare us or do any harm.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The first time I heard these events, I asked my grandmother
what was going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother
replied that an old couple had lived in the house years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The husband passed away and the wife moved
out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She died a few years
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother told me that it was
just the "old man" looking for his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he meant us no harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My grandparents lived in that house for years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can recall the events just like it was
yesterday, because it was almost always a daily happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess you could say that when we moved, we
were a little sad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "old
man" had become a part of our family without knowing us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we always hoped that he would find his
beloved wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hunted for her for
years.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hello, i would like to share with you my experiences.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>About 3 years ago we moved into a fairly old house that an
old man had not long lived in and passed away we heard that he was a nice man.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>he still had all his personal possesions still in the house
so oviously we disspose of them.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One night my mum and dad were talking about moving this mans
pictures off of the wall and putting their wedding photos and mine and my
siblings baby photos up,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then shockingly
the next day thay had mysteriosly been put on the wall in the place that we
were going to put them. This wasnt the only thing that happend, also i would
often hear voices in the middle of the night, when i couldnt get to sleep i
would hear a faint voice asking if i was ok at the time i just thought this was
my mum or dad hearing me get up and asking if i was ok but to my disbelieve it
wasnt! also things went missing and after a few weeks or so they would suddenly
reappear which was very strange. Once i was trying to get to sleep under my
duvet and i came out as i thought i heard something but i looked up and on my
curtain was a shadow that quickly went straight across it i knew that this
wasnt my shadow because i moved back to where i was before and it did not do
what i saw the first time. Me and my family also often hear running up and down
the stairs but just ignore it because if we think about it, it just frightens
us more, but we have now learnt to live with these paranormal experiences and
after 4 years are still living in the same "HAUNTED" house.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well this story Started a few weeks ago when Me and my
fiance came home from my mothers house, where were staying for a few days, and
my future sister in law told us about a few weird things that had happened
while we were gone. One thing that happened was a series of noises in our room
at like three in the morning when we keep our door locked and we had the key.
After she told us this my fiance said "That explains the butterflies in my
stomach" and explained she had a dream about a ghost that used to live in
the house and was getting upset about something she could not remember and he
wanted us all out but was just doing small stuff like I said above.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The thing that has made us want to know more about this
whole ghost thing was when our nephew and my fiance both said they saw the
first ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well a few days later we
were headed out from our bedroom to head out to smoke and my fiance jumped and
said there was a new ghost and this one isnt nice it was right out side our
door on the stairs just staring at our door with his mouth wide open like as if
he was about to scream. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The story really gets interesting when a few nights later
after we got done cleaning up our room my fiance and I lied down to take a nap
and before my fiance dozed off she said "we aren't alone." I was
almost asleep when she grabbed me and held me tight she was still sleeping and
when I woke her she said she wasnt gonna move. I asked her if I should turn on
the light and she said "yes." she then rolled over and started
talking in a monotone and staring off into space. She spoke like she had no
purpose and would only answer questions and wouldn't speak otherwise. She kept
talkin about a ghost that was in our room and wasn't leaving. She told me that
this ghost wasn't gonna leave until he got what he wanted, and what this ghost
wanted was blood. I kept trying to get her to stop talking like she was but she
would not stop. Finally she closed her eyes and when I went to wake her up she
was talking normally again and had no recollection of what she had said.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We have been looking online to find information about this
kind of Ghost but have turned up nothing. If you could help us out it would be
great.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have another story of a haunting that I experienced that
was posted here ages ago, but this is different. It is not a haunting, I don't
even know if you would consider it paranormal, but it is true and it involves a
psychic, who was dead on, more than once.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Years ago, I went to see a psychic who was recommended by a
friend of mine. I thought it was all just in fun and went along. She told me
that I would meet my "soul-mate" and that it would be a year and a
half or so, before we would really get together and that I would have three
kids, a boy and two girls. She said that I was with this person in a past life
and that he had come back a little earlier than I had, but we were about the
same age and she went on and on. Now, I am thinking this lady is crazy, because
I am already married and have a son and a daughter at the time and my husband
had a vasectomy. So, how am I gonna have a third kid? I walked out of there
thinking.........whatever!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>About 5 years ago, I met a man at work. By this time, I had
pretty much forgotten what the psychic lady had told me years before. He worked
at a different location than I did, but with the same employer. I remember when
I first met him, thinking I already knew him (and also thinking, wow is this
guy cute) and later found out that he felt the same way. I talked to him from
time to time as our job required, but no biggie until about a year and a half
after we met, he was relocated closer to where I was and we started having
lunch together, etc. and things went crazy from there. He was born 5 months
before me and we were the same age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Now, the marriage I was in was horrible and I had considered
leaving for some time. Suddenly remembering and realizing one night that this
lady might have been right about some things, I convinced this man to go see
her with me, to see where we should go from here. I guess I was kind of looking
for a direction as, I really wanted to be with this man, but was in a bad
marriage. Should I make it work, should I leave ???? I was confused and I just
wanted to hear what she had to say. Anyway, when we walked in the door, the
same psychic lady looked up at us, to greet us, and literally gasped so loud,
we thought something was terribly wrong. She smiled and said, "No, no,
everything is good, come on in....but I want to talk to you each
separately". We were like..ummmmm ok.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>She told both of us several things that were both good and
bad, (pretty much all of which has happened, by the way)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but she said the reason she gasped was
because she had seen a "light" connecting us at the chest (I know it
sounds weird, but that is what she said) and that she had never, EVER seen a
stronger connection between two people.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Needless to say, the two of us are happily married now and
we had a daughter (remember the one boy and two girls thing). The minute I got
pregnant, I knew it was a girl, there was no question. My husband and I find
our selves thinking, saying, feeling, etc. the same way at the same time. There
were times (one pretty serious) where he knew there was something wrong with
me, even though he was miles away at the time and my phone was ringng before I
could even call him to tell him what happened. There are times when (as an
example), I will think about asking him to do me a favor, like to turn the
coffee pot on or something and before I can even start speaking he will walk
into the room and say "I already did it, coffee will be ready in a
minute". Things like this happen to us so frequently that we are used to
it and it doesn't even phase us anymore, but people on the outside see us and
are amazed at how in sync we are. I know this sounds corny, but when we are
seperated for more than a day or so (it has only happened once or twice) we
both experience a mild paid in the dead center of our chest until we see
eachother again. A very real physical pain. He doesn't go on business trips
anymore unless it is absolutly a no choice thing.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I believe in life after death and have had strange things
happen to me, but I didn't believe in the whole "soul-mate" thing. I
do now......there is no question that he and I are one person. And I have to be
honest, having this strong of a connection to someone, is both exhilarating and
scary at the same time. We have NO DOUBTS about each other, but if something
were to happen to one of us, I don't think the other could survive. Thanks for
your time.</big></p>
