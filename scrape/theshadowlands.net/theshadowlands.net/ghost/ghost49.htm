<H3><A NAME=many>Many, Many Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by lauraanng@mindspring.com </B>
<P>
<P><B> My experiences with hauntings began early in my childhood.  It seems


that</B>
<P><B>wherever I have gone I have lived in a haunted place.  This began to


make</B>
<P><B>sense to me when I learned that ghosts have a tendancy to attach


themselves</B>
<P><B>to people, as well as places.</B>
<P><B>  Only one of these presences has been malevolent, though some of them


have</B>
<P><B>taken some getting used to.  My favorite ghost was ( I say was because


I</B>
<P><B>have not seen him since I moved from the house) a little boy, about


three</B>
<P><B>or four years old, who would sit, cherub-style, on the dresser in the</B>
<P><B>bedroom, watching us sleep at night.  If ever I woke and startled him,


he</B>
<P><B>would soundlessly run away, never to reappear again on that night.
 I would</B>
<P><B>lie still, feigning sleep, so that he would not run, but I never


caught</B>
<P><B>more than a fleeting look at him before he sensed my awareness and
was gone.</B>
<P><B>   I was divorced several years ago and the children and I moved to


another</B>
<P><B>state to start over.  I later met someone and we began dating.  In


the</B>
<P><B>following year, my ex-husband was killed in a car accident.  Recently,


my</B>
<P><B>fiancee moved in with me and, coincidentally, all sorts of inteesting


(and</B>
<P><B>somewhat annoying) things have begun to happen.</B>
<P><B>   Probably the most fascinating thing are the crashes, which we hear


in</B>
<P><B>the night an average of twice a week.  Sometimes they are "outside"


the</B>
<P><B>house, and can be as big-sounding as a falling tree, and others


inside</B>
<P><B>sound as though vases or lamps are falling to the floor. Needless to


say,</B>
<P><B>when we get up to see what has happened (for a bit I thought the cats


were</B>
<P><B>getting a little frisky), there is no evidence of anything fallen or</B>
<P><B>broken.  Change simply drops to the floor out of nowhere (an


interesting</B>
<P><B>note is that my husband had a habit of strewing change all over the


house),</B>
<P><B>a candle will simply not stay lit and the cats are very jumpy and


restless.</B>
<P><B> There is an overall feel of strangeness in the house, as though


something</B>
<P><B>is taking up kinesthetic space and though we keep bumping into it,
we</B>
<P><B>cannot see it.</B>
<P><B>   I am not the least bit bothered by any of it, but my fiancee is


actually</B>
<P><B>threatening to move out and insisting that we find a new house.  I


suspect</B>
<P><B>that is what my deceased husband wants, but I have no way of knowing


for</B>
<P><B>certain what his motives might be.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sir>Sir Charles</A>
</H3><P><B>by SFJ1@worldnet.att.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was growing up we had a ghost we called Sir Charles. We would
see things around our house that we couldn't explain. Cretin things would
happen to us. This is kind of strange. My dad is the baby of 14 kids. When
my dad was young his father shot his finger off by mistake in a hunting accident.


For some reason My grandmother kept the finger. This finger was never preserved


or nothing. But it never rotted. The skin and nail was still in tact. My
grandpa died as a result of this accident. When my grandmother was too old
to take care of herself we put her in a nursing home. She asked all of her
kids to divide up her belongings and share them among themselves. Well some
how my dad wound up with this finger. After about a week of having this finger


things would happen in our house. We would see little lights going around
the room. they would hover around my dad. Sometimes when my dad was sleeping
he said that he would wake up and he felt something lightly brushing on his
hair and he would feel a cold spot. Sometimes when he was lying there in
bed he would see a figure of someone in the corner of his room. I would be


walking into the bathroom and see something in the shower. I never could
figure out what this was. My mother said I would come yelling "Mom, Jesus
is in the shower, Come and look!" I was only around 8 years old at the time.
But I remember this stuff easily. Nothing bad ever happened to us. Usually
good things would happen to us. Sometimes when we would set something down
and take our eye away from it for a few seconds it would be gone. We would
find it back there a few days later like it was never moved. Our doors on
the room would open by them selves every once in a while. None of us were
afraid of this. For it had never given us a reason to be afraid of it. When
my grandmother passed away in 1981 we buried the finger with her. After that
day we had never seen out ghost again. I have always wondered if it was my


grandpa.</B>

<H3><A NAME=rosemary>Rosemary</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	atrinkle@ionet.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story happened to my mother.  I had a great-cousin who was born


in</B>
<P><B>the 1910's.  Her mother was a very tiny worman and when she was born


she</B>
<P><B>was too large for her mother.  The doctor trying to help used forceps</B>
<P><B>and by accident grabbed Rosemary by the back of the neck squeezed too</B>
<P><B>hard and crushed her spinal cord. For the next 60 some years Rosemary</B>
<P><B>lived in a kind of prison that was her own body.  No one knew how


much</B>
<P><B>she really  knew or understood.  Because of the thinking back then


she</B>
<P><B>was never encouraged to learn to walk or do anything.  When her


mother</B>
<P><B>died she was already in her late 50's.  My aunts remember her calling</B>
<P><B>momma, momma, but those where the only words she ever spoke.  She was</B>
<P><B>always an infant.  After her mother died she went to live with my


aunt,</B>
<P><B>my mothers sister.  This is where the ghost story begins. Rosemary


had</B>
<P><B>been fighting a cold for about a week when it was decided that they</B>
<P><B>where going to take her to the hospital the next day.  That night my</B>
<P><B>father woke up my mother because he said she was laughing


uncontrollably</B>
<P><B>in her sleep.  She said she didn't know why but she felt wonderful.


 She</B>
<P><B>couldn't remember when she felt better.  The next morning we got a


phone</B>
<P><B>call that Rosemary had died during the night.  My mother said that


that</B>
<P><B>was what it was.  Rosemary had come to say that she was free and that</B>
<P><B>everyone should be happy.  She was finally free.  Mother calls


Rosemary</B>
<P><B>a saint.  I don't think she could be anything else.</B>

<H3><A NAME=hooded>Hooded Figure</A>
</H3><P><B>by monty@mint.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>Some times I question my sanity. I am shure that you hear that alot.
When I was only five or six I awoke to the sounds of heavy breathing. Of
course I woke up, standing over my bed looking down at me was a tall figure
in a black hooded robe. The only thing visable were two glowing red eyes.


Terrified I went screeming to my mothers room. She passed it off as a dream.
The months passed and I remember vividly that I could feel a presance in
the house but I was young and couldn't understand what I was feeling. My
parents were divorced so one week I was visiting my father. When I returned
my mother said that she had ben sleeping in my bed because she missed me,
and that the same thing had appeared bending over the bed as if to see who
it was. Now you may be asking your self why she would tell me this? I dont
know to this day. Well this thing haunted me througout my childhood especialy


when I was unhappy or upset. I found out later that my sister had also


experienced the same thing only at a friends house. The friend also saw it.
My sister a not very religious person began to pray and it dissapeard. As
i got older I became facinated with the Ocult and did much resarch on paranormal


self defence. On night when I was eighteen I awoke to feel its presence in
the room. I dont think I have ever ben as afraid as I was at that moment.
But a rage filled me and I sat right up in bed an said out loud to the dark
that if it wanted me for somthing then do it otherwise leave me the hell
alone!! After that night I felt as if a great weight had ben lifted off my


shoulders.  However I feel that that thing has never lest my sister or I
alone. But i'm now twenty six and I feel that there are forces watching out
for us, but it's still disturbing. My advice to anyone with the same experiences


is to not give these things the time of day!! Give them nothing of


yourselves.</B>

<H3><A NAME=birthday>Birthday Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by LVCJR@AOL.COM</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story has to do with multiple ghost sightings. Well, we start
off on my birthday. Approx. nine whitnesses observed bobbing heads poking
in and out from the side of my shed(under construction at the time). They
were white glowing faces, almost with robes over their head. Two of us went
back to investigate but found nothing. About one hour after the sighting,
approx. four of us whitnessed multiple glowing spheres behind a tree nearby.
Two of us are police officers, so we engaged the objects with our sidearms.
Might I ad, this is a fairly dangerous area. The objects slowly dissapated
and we found no evidence of any paranormal activity. </B>
<P><B>The nine of us joined to go inside when we all whitnessed a glowing
figure approx. fifteen meters down the back street(alley way). Again we engaged


the being and instructed it to get down on the ground. At this time, the
being quickly turned around and dissapeared.</B>

<H3><A NAME=2>2 Encounters with Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by murdockron@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Greetings: Recieved your email address off the Internet. I have </B>
<P><B>forwarded two stories of actual encounters with ghosts. Feel free to
use </B>
<P><B>them as you see fit.                                            1)
Every </B>
<P><B>Saturday morning my folks went out to do the weeks shopping. This one


</B>
<P><B>Saturday was not an exception. As the folks pulled out of the driveway,


</B>
<P><B>I got out of bed so I could have the house to myself. As I was getting


</B>
<P><B>dressed, I heard footsteps go up the stairwell. This couldn't be missed


</B>
<P><B>as the stairs were next to my bedroom. I felt rather spooked knowing
the </B>
<P><B>folks didn't come back in. Quickly making my way upstairs, I checked
out </B>
<P><B>all the upstair rooms &amp; closets. I expected to be jumped at any
moment </B>
<P><B>by an intruder. Finding nothing did little to bring peace of mind as
I </B>
<P><B>felt watched during the search. This feeling continued as I cooked
</B>
<P><B>breakfast &amp; washed up. I checked the TV listings to see who was
playing </B>
<P><B>in the televised baseball game. As I was doing so I heard a woman sigh.


</B>
<P><B>Looking up I saw no one, then I felt a hand brush my cheek. My interest


</B>
<P><B>in the ball game became nil &amp; I got out of the house immediately.
I told </B>
<P><B>who ever was there not to impede my progress as I was out of there,
they </B>
<P><B>could have the house. I didn't bother coming back until my parents
got </B>
<P><B>home from their shopping.                                        The
</B>
<P><B>second incident happened within two years of the above.           Dad


&amp; </B>
<P><B>I left Burnaby on a Friday afternoon for a fishing trip near Hope.
At </B>
<P><B>some point during the weekend, Mom was cleaning the bathtub when she
</B>
<P><B>heard me call her from the bathroom door. She looked up, only to see
</B>
<P><B>nothing at the door. This scared her out of her wits especially after


</B>
<P><B>she went through the house only to find nobody around &amp; no car
in the </B>
<P><B>driveway. Dad &amp; I were still 100 miles away on our fishing trip.
                                                  </B>
<P><B>Hope you enjoyed the above stories. Thanks for your time &amp; </B>
<P><B>consideration.</B>

<H3><A NAME=dorm>Flagler College's Dorm</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	tgrande@jax-inter.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I heard about this story from one of my friends, but first I think


you</B>
<P><B>should know a little about Flagler College's dorm.  The dorm is an
old hotel</B>
<P><B>that was owned by Henry Flagler around 1888.  He had a mistress while
he was</B>
<P><B>married to each of his three wives.  Flalger ended up locking his


mistress</B>
<P><B>in a room on the third floor because he thought that she was crazy.


 The</B>
<P><B>room had mirrors on the ceiling and she ended up hanging herself from


the</B>
<P><B>ceiling.  Now, no one is allowed to live in that room becuase of all


the</B>
<P><B>strange things that have happened.  For instance, if a student tried
to hang</B>
<P><B>things up on the wall or ceiling, they would end up scatered aroung


the</B>
<P><B>floor when she got back to her room.  The college eventually locked
the room</B>
<P><B>so no one could live in it because of the numerous complaints.  Now,


the</B>
<P><B>rooms to both the left and right of the "mirror room" cannot hang


anything</B>
<P><B>on the wall that they share with the "mirror room".....the posters
just get</B>
<P><B>thrown on the floor.</B>
<P><B>        Another girl actually looked like Henry Flaglers young dughter


who</B>
<P><B>was killed when she was a child.  Becasue of this, the student got


followed</B>
<P><B>around by his ghost.  She left the school after a few weeks.  She used


to</B>
<P><B>wake up in the middle of the night and actually see his shost at the
end of</B>
<P><B>her bed!  </B>
<P><B>        Another guy....guys live on the 1st floor only....actually
died of a</B>
<P><B>heart attack...he was found with a really scared look on his face by
a few</B>
<P><B>of his friends in his bed.  He was perfectly healthy from what i was


told.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There are so many more that i was told, but i cannot remember them
off hand.</B>
<P><B>A lot of people have seen things that they wish they had'nt.  I haven't


seen</B>
<P><B>anything yet, and i hope I never will.</B>

<H3><A NAME=flaura>Flaura</A>
</H3><P><B>by Surfer436@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>About a year ago, in July of 1997, I took what was the last of my summer


days to help out at a local nursing home, the Magnolia Tree Branches.  I
was asigned to care for a part of the older section of the building, where
an older wing was extended onto with a newer part of the hospital.  </B>
<P><B>In my first days there I met a woman named, Flaura.  In the last room
on the old wing.  I begin to talk to her daily and ask her questions about
our old town.  She told me to look at a certain space on the wall across
from her bed.  On that wall there was a large square that had been patched
over.  She told me this had been an old window before they had built the
new wing onto the nursing home three years before.  She said she used to
love the view from that window.  A lake that sparkled like the blueest eyes,
and the prettiest pine trees ever. </B>
<P><B>Towards the end of my time at the home, before school started, and
I had to stop seeing Flaura because she was ailing and getting sicker from
her breast cancer everyday.  Finally on the last day of her 87 year life,
i was requested at her room.  For three hours I listened to her thank me
for the many days I had sat and listened to her speak.  She said that I was
her last friend in life and she was glad to say so.  She would laugh and
say, "For a white boy, you alright," and as I was leaving a bent doan and
kissed Ms. Flaura on her forehead.  She smiled and told me that was the first


time she had ever seen a white person kiss a black lady and really mean it.
 I did mean it, because I loved her like a true friend. </B>
<P><B>On my way home i looked at the sewer lagoon that used to be the lake
Flaura was talking about.  Now it was the greenest water i had ever seen.
 As i lay in my bed that night, i thought about the 16 years i had lived
my life without really apreciating it.  </B>
<P><B>The next morning i went to clean out Flaura's room at the nursing home.
 She had died the night before, thirty minutes after i had left, and she
had no family to clean the room.  So i did.  When i was folding the leftover


clothes from her dresser i looked up at her neatly cleaned bed.  She was
staring at me with her huge brown eyes.  </B>
<P><B>She pointed to the wall behind me and said, the lake is as shiny as
the bluest eyes, and those pine trees are gorgeous today.  I turned and looked
at the patch on the wall, but instead a window had replaced it that showed
the sparkling lake and the old pine trees that stood by it.  I turned around
to her but the bed stood empty.  And the window behind me had vanished. 
The nurse came in and ushered me out of the room with the clothes from Flaura's


drawer.  </B>
<P><B>That afternoon as i drove by the lake a city official van was parked
there.  I turned off into the parking area and drove next to the van.  A
black woman was there in her city uniform and I asked her what she was doing.
 She told me the city was going to clean the lake up and make it shine again.
 I drove away knowing Flaura will get to see her lake shine again, like the


bluest eyes.</B>

<H3><A NAME=trailer>Haunted Trailer </A>
</H3><P><B>by kenwill@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Back in 1978 when I was a young Staff Sergeant, the Air Force</B>
<P><B>transferred me to McConnell Air Force Base in  Wichita, Kansas.


 Because</B>
<P><B>I was single at the time I was living in the barracks at first, but</B>
<P><B>because of the loud music and noise from the other residents, I


decided</B>
<P><B>to find my own place. I found a nice two bedroom mobile home for rent</B>
<P><B>that I thought would be perfect.  While the landlord was showing it


to</B>
<P><B>me I noticed the mattress in the master bedroom had a large blood


stain</B>
<P><B>in the middle of it.  Although it had been cleaned, the cloth was


still</B>
<P><B>stained. I told the landlord I would take the trailer, but that I


wanted</B>
<P><B>a different mattress.  He agreed and I moved in shortly after. From


the</B>
<P><B>very first few weeks I knew something was not right.  I was a 27 year</B>
<P><B>old, six foot, 205 pound military NCO.....and I could not go to sleep


at</B>
<P><B>night with the lights turned off!  As soon as I would close my eyes,


I</B>
<P><B>would get the distinct feeling of someone standing beside the bed.


One</B>
<P><B>of the first nights there, I woke up needing to go to the bathroom.
As I</B>
<P><B>started down the dark hall, I suddenly felt the hair on my arms and


neck</B>
<P><B>stand up. I had the most scary feelng that there was someone standing


in</B>
<P><B>front of me and that I would have bumped into them if I had not


stopped!</B>
<P><B>I backed up to the bedroom and flipped the light on, and of course


there</B>
<P><B>was no one there. From that night on I slept with the nightstand lamp</B>
<P><B>turned on. Other odd things began happening. On more than one occasion


I</B>
<P><B>would be in the kitchen washing dishes or cooking and would feel


someone</B>
<P><B>come up and stand behind me. This experience always gave me


goosebumps.</B>
<P><B>Other times I would be on the couch watching TV, and would suddenly


get</B>
<P><B>the feeling that there was someone back in the bedroom. I never saw


or</B>
<P><B>heard anything, but I knew I was not alone in that trailer!  I


finally</B>
<P><B>got a clue as to what happened in there when I was talking to a


teenage</B>
<P><B>girl and her brother that were my neighbors. I felt stupid for


asking,</B>
<P><B>but I had to know!  I asked the girl, "Have you ever heard of


anything</B>
<P><B>bad happening in this trailer?"  She didn't even hesitate. "Oh, yes,"</B>
<P><B>she told me. "A couple of years ago there was a woman killed in


there!</B>
<P><B>Someone broke in and stabbed her to death!"  Shortly after this</B>
<P><B>conversation I married a lady I had been dating, and we moved to a


house</B>
<P><B>with more room.  The really strange thing about all of this is,


although</B>
<P><B>these weird things went on for the entire year and a half that I


lived</B>
<P><B>there, It never once occurred to me to move! </B>

<H3><A NAME=year>A Year of Uneasiness</A>
</H3><P><B>by suckerface@earthlink.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>My family moved around a bit when I was about 9 years old. One of the</B>
<P><B>houses we moved into has one of those signs put up by the Historical</B>
<P><B>Society saying that it was built in 1701. I found it to be


fascinating</B>
<P><B>when I first went inside. It made the hairs in the back of my neck


stand</B>
<P><B>up and send chills down my spine. I was in a ghost phase and I begged


my</B>
<P><B>mom to consider. If there was a haunted house this would be the one.


It</B>
<P><B>also had a secret passage and a secret room(all of them led to my</B>
<P><B>quarter).</B>
<P><B>  My mom decided to get it. So my brothers, mom, and I soon moved


into</B>
<P><B>the house. Not even the first day I heard footsteps in the upstairs


room</B>
<P><B>when we were all downstairs and the house felt abnormally cold</B>
<P><B>considering it was spring. Nothing really odd happened until we


settled</B>
<P><B>in. My brothers and my mom worked. So when I came home I was all by</B>
<P><B>myself. I felt the erieest sensation that someone was watching me and


I</B>
<P><B>was indanger. Sometimes I would think I would see a man a couple feet


in</B>
<P><B>front of me then I would look again and there would be nothing.</B>
<P><B>Sometimes I would hear breathing and feel uncontrolable chills. Soon


I</B>
<P><B>would start to leave the house and play with the nasty


not-so-friendly</B>
<P><B>naighborhood kids just to get away.</B>
<P><B>  My cats would act a little akward too. Sometimes they would move
up</B>
<P><B>and down as if something was petting her. Sometimes they would act


like</B>
<P><B>sniffing the air as if someone was there. Later in the year, doors


would</B>
<P><B>slam shut or open for no explained reason. I would come home from


school</B>
<P><B>and everything would be on or opened. The front door which I would</B>
<P><B>close, would be wide open. At night I would often feel someone


sitting</B>
<P><B>by my feet. The "I'm being watched feeling" increased then. </B>
<P><B>  I wouldn't tell my family cause I was afraid that they would say


that</B>
<P><B>I was reading to much.</B>
<P><B>  During Christmas, we had the tree up and it kept falling over. It


got</B>
<P><B>to the point that we tied it down but even then it fell over.</B>
<P><B>  After Christmas we movie again and I was happy to move.</B>
<P><B>  About five years later my family and I started to talk about that</B>
<P><B>house. We the all confessed that something was weird of that house.
I</B>
<P><B>told them my experiences. There are also some other things I know


that</B>
<P><B>happened that scared me incrediable but I can't remember what. I


don't</B>
<P><B>know if I blocked it out of my mind or not. I asked my brothers what</B>
<P><B>happened to them. They just looked at me going all pale and said that


it</B>
<P><B>was best they didn't tell me. My mom said the same.</B>
<P><B>  Eventually my mom told me that sometimes she would check on me after


I</B>
<P><B>went to sleep and she would see an apparition of a man in pre-Civil


war</B>
<P><B>era clothes standing over me or somtimes sitting watching me....</B>
<P><B>If you have any suggestions about the weird feelings please e-mail

<P>
<P><B>In 1991 I was in Okinawa, Japan serving in the US Marines. I was stationed


at  MCAS Futenma. Its in the southern portion of the island about 10 miles
north of the Capital and southern most city Naha. MCB Camp Foster is about
3 miles north of  Futenma.  It is the 2nd largest military instalation on


Okinawa. Between the two there old castle ruins. Most are over 700 years
old.  </B>
<P><B>     One particular site was to be turned into a tourist attraction


complete with a hotel. In the early 80's (1980 I think I was never able to
find out for sure) construction was stopped and the project was abandoned.
 The exact reason for this is still a mystery to me. One story I heard is
that the third floor of the unfinished hotel collapsed and several workers
were killed in the accident. After seening the unfinished building for myself


this seems likely.</B>
<P><B>The castle walls are nearly intact and it is impressive but pretty


non-descript. Now the unfinished hotel is truly remakable. From the moment
you enter the building shell you are overcome with a feeling of "intense


hostility" as a friend of mine put it. The walls are bare concrete and there
is no carpet to dampen sound so every little noise is amplified. Ive been
there twice and both times had a very eerie and uncomfortable feeling.  Several


times I thought I could just glimpse movement out of the corner of my eye.
It is common to hear whispers and muted voices as well as footsteps on the


concrete floor.  I have spoken about the place with several  past and presnt


Marines recently some of them told me about actually seeing a figure of a
man there. Its impossible to validatethis but coming from completly diffrent


sources its impossible to ignore.  Most other experiences are similar to
the ones my friends and I had there. Visiting this site is against the law
(its completely fenced off) however it is becoming sort of a "rite of passage"


for Marines at Futenma. As such I am sure many of the stories are exaggerated
or are downright  false. However I am certain that this is a real haunting
and from other experiences I have heard from other "visitors" that it is


consistent. I was hoping if you could add this location to your website others


who have been there might submit stories about it. I havent had much luck
finding anymore information than I have just given you. Sorry this is so
long and Thank you for listening.</B>

<P>
<P><B>When I was a kid in the 80's I always heard my parents talking about


my</B>

and</B>
<P><B>about how the ghost was there to protect the family from the "evil"
ghost or</B>
<P><B>in times of need. My grandmother could see him and always knew that
when he</B>

Like I</B>

failed,</B>
<P><B>they would turn to me and say "nap time." Nap was upstairs of course.


After</B>

day as my</B>
<P><B>older brother and younger sister and some friends were playing outside


my</B>

that my</B>

<P><B>After a few minuites of arguing in broad daylight my brother hollered


for</B>

<H3><A NAME=ill>Haunted House of Ill Repute</A>
</H3><P><B>by jaydo@orion.hartnet.org </B>
<P>
<P><B>Years ago I lived in a vintage town house off of Logan Circle in Washington

DC, just blocks from the White House. The house had been built by President

Grant's son, an engineer and architect. The house was located on one of the

streets that spur off of the circle. Somewhat diagnally across Logan Circle
is the house where President Grant and Julia Dent  Grant would use as their

"summer getaway house", even though it was just a few blocks from The White

House. </B>
<P><B>Anyway, the house I lived in was a three story house with a spiral

staircase that went from the first to the second floor. From the day that
I moved into the house, I sensed that the house had other residents than
myself and the other housemates. </B>
<P><B>The first morning after moving in, I went downstairs to make breakfast.
I felt as if I was being watched from the parlor and dining room adjacent
to the kitchen. It really spooked me, but when I looked up there was no one

there. </B>
<P><B>After several odd experiences of hearing the front door open and no
one come into the entrance parlor, I asked the owners if they had heard any
odd noises while living in the house. </B>
<P><B>They replied, "Oh, well we weren't going to tell you but we think there
are SEVERAL ghosts in the house." </B>
<P><B>I asked them why the basement was so oddly cold in spots and did they
ever feel that there was someone watching them when they did the laundry.
The owner said yes, that he often thought that there was a woman watching
him as he did the wash. </B>
<P><B>On one occasion I was shaving in my bathroom when I felt someone step
into the room behind me. I thought it might be one of the housemates trying
to startle me, so I quickly looked up into the mirror to catch them standing

behind me. What I saw was a quick flash of light and an image that briefly

resembled an older, balding black man in a dark suit and white high collared

shirt. I only saw it for the briefest of moments, but the impression on my
mind was intense enough that I got a quick flash of image. </B>
<P><B>I told the owners sister that day what I had saw and she calmly said,
"Oh that must have been the butler that I always see near the front door.!"
 I said to her what are you talking about and she related that her brother
didnt want me to know the entire story, for he was afraid I would move out
and they would have to search for another roomate. </B>
<P><B>She said the house had been a house of prostitution at the turn of
the century, a very well know one to members of Congress and the political
world. The house had suffered a devastaing interior fire, most of the damage
in the basement level and the first floor. The room that I was living in
was the madams room, and the prostitutes lived and worked on the other levels.

She said that she often heard the front door open and when she went to look,
she saw an aging black man in a tux coat standing by the door for a brief
moment with his hand on the door knob like he was opening the door to welcome
a visitor. Then the door would close and he would disapear. Thats who she
said I saw in the mirror. </B>
<P><B>Sometimes he would look at her, bow, and smile then disapear.  </B>
<P><B>Several weeks later, I got up from bed to go downstairs to get a drink
of juice. It was around midnight and everyone else had long since went to
bed for the night.  I went down the spiral staircase after turning on the
dimmer switch that turned on the chandelier. As I got to the bottom step
and started to turn to the left to walk through the living room and into
the kitchen, the owners vicious cocker spaniel began to snarl and spin around
in circles like it was going into seizures.  I thought he was going to attack
me, which he had did on several other occasions. This time it wasnt me he
was after and he ran right past me to pause at the bottom of the steps, snarling,

spitting and scratching his paws into the flooring. </B>
<P><B>As I looked up the staircase to see what the dog was barking at, I
saw the shape of a tall woman standing midway up the stairs. She was

diaphonous---not solid--and misty, apricot in color. I could make out the
outline of a long gown, and could see a vague outline of her head and face.
I let out a yelping screech and just as I did a bright blue and purple spark
of electricity ran up the figure's side from the "toes" to the face, making
a crackling sound. The spark moved really fast. As it got to the "head" the

entire image dissapeared and the dog went running up the stairs after "it."

 </B>
<P><B>The dog kept running up to the landing and back down to the step where

"she" had been "floating". </B>
<P><B>I forgot the juice right away and ran up the steps behind the dog.
I didnt have any desire to look for her at all. </B>
<P><B>The next morning I told the owner and he calmly replied "Oh, that must
have been The Madam of the house---Marie." He said that he often felt a presence

on the stairs and once while he was doing the laundry, he though he saw shadows

moving along one wall where there were these three "rooms" with wooden doors.
He went and got a painting that he had did of what he thought Marie looked
like and he had painted her with an orangish apricot color scheme. </B>
<P><B>He told me that he had checked in the city records and found that the
fire had really happened and that the Madam and several of the girls lost
their lives in the fire. I was living in "Marie's" room and a the girls that
had died were living in the basement "rooms." </B>
<P><B>For the next few months I felt really uncomfortable, others in the
house said that they had had similar experiences as well. </B>
<P><B>I am convinced that the house was haunted by the madam, butler and
the girls that had died in the fire. </B>

<H3><A NAME=dogs>The Dogs</A>
</H3><P><B>by michael.carl@yokota.af.mil </B>
<P>
<P><B>It was a long time ago, but I will never forget the experience.  The

year</B>
<P><B>was 1983 and I was attending Stebbins High School in Dayton, Ohio.
 I was in</B>
<P><B>the marching band as well as many of my friends.  Many times after
a Friday</B>
<P><B>night football game, my friends and myself used to search for places

to</B>
<P><B>spook ourselves.  For the guys, this was highly encouraged as the girls

got</B>
<P><B>scared and liked to hang onto a guy.  Anyway, we all decided to visit
a pet</B>
<P><B>cemetary one night, which was located out in the countryside.  I remember

it</B>
<P><B>being very dark as there were many trees and hills thus blocking out

the</B>
<P><B>moon's light.  No one had a flashlight, but that didn't stop any of
us.  Now</B>
<P><B>the pet cemetary is located up and down a tree-covered hillside.  There

was</B>
<P><B>a creek that ran down the hill along side the footpath.  Our goal was

just</B>
<P><B>to make it to the top of the hill, claim victory and then move on to</B>
<P><B>something else for the evening.  So we all started the hike up the
path when</B>
<P><B>and buddy and I decided to run past the group and be the first to the

top.</B>
<P><B>I remember running fast with my buddy right next to me when all of
a sudden</B>
<P><B>we heard dogs barking.  The sound was right on top of us and it scared
us to</B>
<P><B>the point where we stopped in our tracks and slipped on the dew

covered</B>
<P><B>grass.  My buddy and I fell to the ground and slid about three feet.

 We</B>
<P><B>could still hear the dogs barking as if they were right next to us.
 We both</B>
<P><B>started kicking our feet as if to block an attacking animal, but all
we were</B>
<P><B>doing was kicking at the air.  We looked around and saw nothing even
as the</B>
<P><B>barking continued.  At that moment he and I looked at each other,

screamed</B>
<P><B>at the same moment and ran as fast as we could back down the hill.
 I</B>
<P><B>suppose the humorous thing about the whole experience was seeing our

friends</B>
<P><B>working their way up as me and my buddy were running back down from

fear.</B>
<P><B>Our friends also got scared and started bumping into each other in
the dark</B>
<P><B>night and falling in the creek and smashing into trees.  It was just

so</B>
<P><B>terrible that we had to laugh at what happened.  When we made it to

the</B>
<P><B>baottom and were catching our breath, the others in the group asked

what</B>
<P><B>happened.  Both of us started answering the questions at the same time

with</B>
<P><B>the same aswers.  My buddy and I didn't have the chance to talk either

on</B>
<P><B>the way up the hill, at the top of the hill or on the way back down,
but we</B>
<P><B>both experienced the same thing.  The dogs sounded as if they were
right on</B>
<P><B>top of us, but there were no dogs and nothing chased us back down the

hill.</B>
<P><B>At first we though that we just didn't see the dogs and that perhaps

they</B>
<P><B>were just further away than what we imagined.  The funny thing about
it was</B>
<P><B>that we were no more than 50 yards ahead of the group and not one of

them</B>
<P><B>heard the sound of dogs barking.  The barking was so close to my buddy

and</B>
<P><B>myself and we were close enough to the rest of the group so that they

would</B>
<P><B>have heard the barking also.  Everyone else in the group thought we

were</B>
<P><B>making the story up.  My buddy and I didn't imagine the barking and
even he</B>
<P><B>claimed it sounded as if it were right on top of us.</B>

<H3><A NAME=park>The Park</A>
</H3><P><B>by RodSerlng</B>
<P>
<P><B> Well, let me start off by saying that you have a great website and
I will visit it as often as I can from now on. OK, I live in New York City
in a notorious area known as the South Bronx. I have seen it all, murders,

muggings, shootouts - you name it, and I can honestly say that I never truly

tasted fear until the one night I and a few friends went strolling in a park

(Untermeyer Park) in Yonkers N.Y.  This is the very same park where David

Berkowitz ( the .44 caliber killer-Son of Sam ) went to worship the devil.
This is true - you can look it up. Anyway, we entered the park at about 4:00
am Sunday morning, the group consisted of Myself, my friend Al and Mike Masseo.

It was my first time in the park and it was the darkest place I had ever
seen, except for the dim light coming over the hill from the streetlights.
we strolled around, making jokes and laughing, on our way out - Mike grabbed
my shoulder and whispered look, on the hill!! Look! I turned and saw a shape,
a jet black shape moving through the dim light, it was so fast, it was moving

just so fast. All I could say was whoa!! It's jetting, it's jetting!! (N.Y.C.

slang for moving very fast). My hair stood up on end. Mike and I took a step
back as it passed us with incredible speed. Al had his back to us - he saw

nothing and disbelieves us 'til this day. I was shaking, Mike ran for the
street, I followed with Al behind me - he had no idea why we were running.
I ran so fast - I was so scared, I have never had an experience like this
before or since. I know it's not dramatic or anything but it's my own personal

experience with the other side. It moved so fast - had to be about six feet
tall - I couldn't really tell - It passed us without making a single sound
and disappeared into the bushes - silent. I was so scared and ran so fast.
This shape passed us with the speed, well - I can only compare it to standing
on the side of the highway with the cars speeding by - it passed us that
quick. It cleared about 70, maybe 80 yards in the blink of an eye. This story
is true, I will never forget it-everybody Mike and I told laughed us off
as jokers but I swear - it happened. I will swear to it 'till my dying day,
it happened and I will never forget it. Well, that's my story - for what
it's worth. Thanks for giving me someplace to tell it.</B>

<H3><A NAME=the>The Family Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by El trampo@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I went to my boyfriends house (now my husband) to visit before he had
to go to work.  I was tired so he told me to go take a nap and his mother
would be home after awhile to take me home.  As I laid there I felt that
I was being watched, but after awhile I fell asllep.  I was suddenly awoken
with a chill, and felt someone was there with me.  I went in the living room
and waited for his mom to get home.  After a few months his family started

talking about a ghost that they had.  It had been with the family for years.
 They told me about canisters being knocked of the counter, pencils flying
across the room, and little things like that.</B>
<P><B>After my husband and I were married ( a yr and 1/2 later) little things

started to happen, but I could justify them in my mind, until we moved in
this one house.  It was next door to his mothers old house, the house he
had grown up in, the one with the family ghost.  </B>
<P><B>After living there for about a month by husband came running into our

bedroom where I was sleeping.  He said he was watching TV a something growled
in the corner of the room, and our sons baby carrier fell of the other couch.
 I thought his over active imagination had kicked in, so I went into the

livingroom to watch TV with him.  Nothing happened again that night.  </B>
<P><B>After about a week, when we would go to bed, we could hear noises in
our sons room throught the baby monitor when he was sleeping.  When I would
go in there, he wasn't moving, and nothing was making noise.  The next morning

when I went in to get him his nick nacks would all be rearranged.  This kept

happening almost every night.</B>
<P><B>My friends or family that would spend the night were so scared they
would only slept in bed with my husband and I.  One night when my cousin
stayed over we were all tring to go to sleep when something was stuck into
our box fan.  We all just laid there and pretended we were asleep.  We were
too scared to move.  When my husband finally got up and turned on the light

nothing was there.</B>
<P><B>Little things like spoons flipping in bowls on the table, shadows going

down the hall to our room, and lights turning off and on were a regular

occurance.  We only lived there for 6 months before I told my husband I had
to get out of there.  Since then ( that was 4 yrs ago),  little things rarely

occur.  The most recent was a pen that flew about 12 feet across the room.
 That was about a year ago, but i still sense that someone is there watching

me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=home>My Haunted Home</A>
</H3><P><B>by shetan_13@yahoo.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>This could take awhile so I am going to get right to it.  I have

lived</B>
<P><B>in a haunted house my entire life.  I grew up seeing and hearing</B>
<P><B>entities in my house.  My bedroom is a "hotspot" in our home.  The</B>
<P><B>whole thing is haunted but my room seems to be the center of

activity.</B>
<P><B>I started getting funny feelings a few years ago when was alone in
my</B>
<P><B>room.  It was as if someone was watching me.  This wasn't an uncommon</B>
<P><B>feeling for me and I knew what I was feeling.  Then the weird stuff</B>
<P><B>started happening.  I had just moved into my room from another room

in</B>
<P><B>the house.  No one had lived in there for a long time and I believe</B>
<P><B>that when I moved in I set off the activity that occurred and still</B>
<P><B>occurs in there.  The spirits didn't seem to mind me being there. I</B>
<P><B>knew they were there but I never felt threatened.  My bed would</B>
<P><B>vibrate when I was in it and the dresser sometimes vibrated for no</B>
<P><B>good reason.  When I spoke to my "friends" they would stop the</B>
<P><B>activity.  I have always been very, very sensitive to the spirit

world</B>
<P><B>so I believe that's why I am the only one who has felt them other

than</B>
<P><B>my mom. I hear voices, and feel them touching me if I am upset, or
I</B>
<P><B>just feel their presence.  Sometimes I feel hands on my shoulders or</B>
<P><B>on my hands and back.  I have also seen them.  I have one in</B>
<P><B>particular that I am rather fond of.  I believe it is my</B>
<P><B>great-grandfather who was killed on the railroad in 1922.  The</B>
<P><B>description fits.  I have one corner in my room that lights up in

this</B>
<P><B>eerie blue light that is concentrated only in that corner.  There is</B>
<P><B>no way for light to reach that corner from outside as it is blocked</B>
<P><B>from the light coming through the window.  This commonly occurs

around</B>
<P><B>three a.m. and lasts only a few seconds.  It seems to be some sort
of</B>
<P><B>portal for them. It is always cold if you put you hand in the corner.

</B>
<P><B>My friends have even noticed this.  I have a lot of ribbons on my

wall</B>
<P><B>from various competitions.  I have three staggered at one place on

the</B>
<P><B>wall.  The one in the middle has a nasty habit of being turned</B>
<P><B>backwards sometimes.  I have investigated ways a draft could have

done</B>
<P><B>it, there are none.  Other things in my room get moved as well.  They</B>
<P><B>just do it to drive me insane I think.  I just know they are smirking</B>
<P><B>at me when I figure out what has happened.  I know this because I

have</B>
<P><B>heard soft laughter when I can't find something that they have moved</B>
<P><B>for me.  It is merely a game.  One day I was on the landing at the

top</B>
<P><B>of the stairs of my house.  To one side is my sister's door and on

the</B>
<P><B>other side is a hallway leading to my parents room and mine.  Anyway,</B>
<P><B>I was standing at the top of the stairs and the phone in my parents'</B>
<P><B>room rang.  I turned to go down the hall and all of a sudden I felt</B>
<P><B>something brush past me and felt a cold chill.  Then I saw a figure

go</B>
<P><B>down the darkened hallway and into my parents room.  I followed, but</B>
<P><B>there was no one in the room when I got there.  However, I could feel</B>
<P><B>the presence of one of my spirits.  Maybe they were trying to tell
me</B>
<P><B>something, I don't know.  All I could do was laugh.  Sometimes I will</B>
<P><B>be walking throughout the house or my room and run into cold pockets.

</B>
<P><B>I believe that this is when I have run right into my spirit friends.
</B>
<P><B>It doesn't even frighten me anymore.  </B>
<P><B>Just recently, like in the last few months, I have begun to notice
an</B>
<P><B>evil presence in my room.  I never knew what is was like to actually</B>
<P><B>fear a spirit until I met this one.  When he came into the room my</B>
<P><B>hair stood on end and I got very anxious and edgy.  But then my good</B>
<P><B>spirit would show up, usually the male but sometimes the female, and</B>
<P><B>run the other off or something.  Then he or she would stay with me</B>
<P><B>until I had calmed down.  I believe I have two good spirits and one</B>
<P><B>bad one.  There are others, but these are the strongest.  It got to</B>
<P><B>the point where I was afraid of my own room, and the evil was

becoming</B>
<P><B>stronger and stronger. One day I begged my good spirits to stop the</B>
<P><B>other one from tormenting me.  That night, the bad one showed up

right</B>
<P><B>on schedule, and I felt the other two show up soon after.  That night</B>
<P><B>I felt so strong a fear that I thought I was in danger, but then all</B>
<P><B>of a sudden the evil was gone and only my friends remained. I have

had</B>
<P><B>no more trouble with the evil since.  I think maybe the combined</B>
<P><B>strength of my friends may have been enough to stop the evil.  I saw</B>
<P><B>my great-grandpa that night.  He was simply standing in the corner

and</B>
<P><B>when he realized I had seen him, he bowed his head and disappeared.
 I</B>
<P><B>still feel him, but I haven't seen him again.  To my knowledge I have</B>
<P><B>not seen the female, only heard her.  And I never saw my evil spirit.</B>
<P><B>Now I have moved to Berkeley to go to school here and my</B>
<P><B>great-grandfather has followed me here.  I have felt him countless</B>
<P><B>times in my room or just around campus with me.  It is a comfort for</B>
<P><B>me to know that I am protected.</B>
<P><B>I guess what I have been trying to say this whole time is that it is</B>
<P><B>possible to become very attached to some spirits and actually welcome</B>
<P><B>their presence.  I would feel very alone now if my great-grandfather</B>
<P><B>ever left me.  He does occasionally leave but he always returns soon</B>
<P><B>after.  My belief is not to fear them, try to learn from them.  If</B>
<P><B>they are evil, however, get help from someone who knows what they are</B>
<P><B>doing.  I hope my story can help someone who is having spirit

problems</B>
<P><B>to understand that they shouldn't be afraid unless it is obviously
a</B>
<P><B>malicious spirit.</B>

<P>
<P><B>This is a story about my friend and I when we went to</B> <B>the mountains

for a week.It was late afternoon when we arrived to the cabin that we would
be staying at for the week.It looked so nice and peaceful.In the back of
the house there was a door that lead to the back yard where there was a wonderful

lake.That night we spent alot of time settling in.The next morning we had
a big brekfast and I had a weird feeling that someone was watching me.But
I just ignored it.Around 7:00p.m. my friends mom asked us to watch my friends

sister Julie while they went out for awhile.So we said sure.When they left
we played a few games then we sat down to watch some t.v.It was about 8:45p.m.

when we heard a nock at the back door I told my friend Beckey that I would
go see who was at the door while she put Julie to bed.When I got to the door
no one was there.So I went back to the living room and sat down.Beckey asked
who it was and I told her that no one was there.About 5 min. later we heard
the nocking again but this time we also heard someone saying "LET ME IN"several

times so we both went to the door together we looked and again no one was

there,so we opened the door to have a look around and we saw nothing.Beckey
went to check on her sister while I stayed on the couch watching t.v.She
came down and said she was fine she was fast asleep.We were watching t.v.
for about 10 more min. intill the nocking started again.Now we were getting
very agravated.And we thought it was some kids playing a prank so we got
up getting ready to go yell at the kids and when we got to the door we saw
this strang man floating in the air saying "LET ME IN" we both screamed then
ran up stairs to where Julie was sleeping.She was still fast asleep.We never
told anyone our very frighting experience because we thought they would all

laugh.I'm really glad that we got to share this we you.And we hope you understand

that it really happend and we still have nightmares about it.</B>

</H3><P><B>by 	PKK1@Maritz.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Although my husband, Tim, and I have been interested in the

paranormal</B>
<P><B>for many years, the first experiences we had were a little over 3

years</B>
<P><B>ago.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We were on vacation in Great Britain with our 2 year old daughter,</B>
<P><B>Eleni.  One of the hotels we stayed in was Ruthin Castle in the

Northern</B>
<P><B>part of Wales.  We learned of this hotel through a ghost book about</B>
<P><B>haunted hotels, which we often use when looking for a place to stay.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The first morning I awoke to find my daughter sitting by the door to

our</B>
<P><B>room.  She was pointing to the door and saying, "Lady."</B>
<P>
<P><B>Out of curiosity, I asked the front desk clerk if the resident ghost</B>
<P><B>ever appears in the guest rooms.  Her answer was, "No, she usually

roams</B>
<P><B>the battlements and the corridors of the hotel, although she has been</B>
<P><B>known to stick her head through the doors of the rooms from time to</B>
<P><B>time."   Then I told her what had happened that morning.  She said,</B>
<P><B>"That's interesting, since the name of our ghost here is the Gray

Lady."</B>
<P>
<P><B>Although we had been on countless ghost tours and been to many sites</B>
<P><B>reported to be haunted, it is another thing when you actually find</B>
<P><B>something.  And this was just the first encounter of this trip...</B>
<P><B>...more to follow...</B>

<H3><A NAME=nz>NZ Hauntings</A>
</H3><P><B>by BullocNi@iac.org.nz </B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a soldier in the NZ Army who when I joined as a youth in 1981,

was</B>
<P><B>placed in a old barrack block in Waiouru Camp, which is a camp located

in</B>
<P><B>the middle of the North Island.</B>
<P><B>A story circulated about a young soldier who hung himself in this

barrack</B>
<P><B>block approx 20 years before and who returns each year on the annerversry

of</B>
<P><B>his death.</B>
<P><B>As little more than boys, we did not know if this was just a story
to scare</B>
<P><B>us or a real event.  He even had a nick name of "Harvey".</B>
<P><B>To cut a long story short, on the week that his death occured, a number

of</B>
<P><B>my room mates reports waking up 1 or 2 in the morning, cold and unable

to</B>
<P><B>speak.  Of course this was scoffed at, but everyone got a fright when

a</B>
<P><B>soldier woke the barracks screaming and wet with sweat.  His recalled

waking</B>
<P><B>and been cold with a force or something pushing his head into the pillow

(he</B>
<P><B>was sleeping face down). The pressure became harder and harder and

the</B>
<P><B>pillow became a type of gag and he could not scream or speak.</B>
<P><B>After what seemed an eon, the surounding air, which was </B>
<P><B>cold, became warm and he screamed out.  As this was the middle of the

night</B>
<P><B>and all personnel were already 'hyped up" with the circulating stories,

no</B>
<P><B>one got much sleep for the rest of the night.</B>
<P><B>I must admit I am a fan of sotries of "Unexplanied" events and follow
the "X</B>
<P><B>- Files' every week.  This may</B>
<P><B>have caused an element of doubt when trying to decide if my our event

was</B>
<P><B>real or a dream.  Some how you always know what is real and I believe

the</B>
<P><B>following to have really occured:</B>
<P><B>One night after this occurance, I was in may bed fast a sleep when
at 1 a.m.</B>
<P><B>I awoke very cold and aware of a calmness in the air. I found that
I could</B>
<P><B>not move and speaking was impossible.  My mind started to go crazy
with the</B>
<P><B>circulating stories and I did not want to look around. I finally managed

to</B>
<P><B>eye the end of my bed and in the darkness saw what I can only decribe
as a</B>
<P><B>object shaped like a ten pin bowling pin.  It was a dirty white colour

with</B>
<P><B>the outlines blurred.  There was no face, arms or anything to identify
it as</B>
<P><B>human except for the basic shape, which like a pin, started at the
top with</B>
<P><B>a round head outline and expanding a quarter of the way down with a
type of</B>
<P><B>shoulder and then tappering off toward the bottom.</B>
<P><B>After what seemed as 1 minute, I managed to make a type of "grunt"
and the</B>
<P><B>object vanished and the air returnrd to room temperture.</B>
<P><B>I was sweating all over and shaken.  I managed sleep after an hour
or so,</B>
<P><B>but my mind was racing.   I did not tell anyone for years but later
over a</B>
<P><B>few beers did tell my story to a few mates who thinking it was a good</B>
<P><B>"yarn", did tell stories of their own.</B>
<P><B>As everyone knows my interest, the feeling has normally been "yeah,

right".</B>
<P><B>I include the above out of interest and do not seek to have it

published</B>
<P><B>(apart from your site) or get into any type of correspondance. I prefer

to</B>
<P><B>be an interested on looker only.</B>
<P><B>Thank you for you serious approach, and like you wish to avoid

<H3><A NAME=father>My Father's Experience</A>
</H3><P><B>by lenachan@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is my first time writing and contacting others who have experienced

the unnatural.  Although I have my own experiences, I choose to submit my
fathers for now. He is in his late 60's and he would take his stories to
the grave than to share them with everyone. My fathers family mostly lived
in Arizona and used to stay at a ranch that my Greatgrandfather owned. It
was a small house that they stayed in and the bedroom had wall that didn't
reach all the way to the ceiling, on the other side was the kitchen. Well
late at night when everyone was asleep. My dad would hear a horse galloping

outside, it would stop in front of the house, then he would hear someone
jump off and walk to the front door, with the spurs on his cowboy boots jingling

the whole time. They would come in the house and proceed to light the stove
to heat up a kettle. My dad jumped up to go into the kitchen and suddenly
all the noise stopped and there was nobody there!  This went on for several

nights, the same noises happening exactly as they had the night before and
every time my dad would go into the kitchen the noises would suddenly stop.
 He finally told his brother and cousin but they didn't believe him. So that

night, they all stayed up, but this time they had rocks to throw over the
wall.  sure enough they all heard the same noises of someone jumping off
a horse, walking into the kitchen and lighting the stove .  At that moment
they all started throwing the rocks and shouting, then the noises stopped.
 The next day my dad's cousin confessed to pulling off the wooden crosses
from the nearby cemetary to use for heating the stove. My dad was very angry
at him because he said that he was disturbing the dead and other bad things
could happen.</B>

</H3><P><B>by 	Highlander-001@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have read alot of your stories. I must say I am hooked on this web</B>
<P><B>site! I love it. I feel I need to share one of my experiences. But</B>
<P><B>before I do, I need to understand why people think an entity that

causes</B>
<P><B>fear (to the point of being frozen) or the feeling of dread, think

this</B>
<P><B>entity could be a lost love one.  I appolgize if that comes off rude,

I</B>
<P><B>just don't understand. Or is it the fear of the unknown? Not that I

wish</B>
<P><B>to experience such fear.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> I live in St. Louis, MO. I am 28 yrs old, a mother of 2 great kids,

and</B>
<P><B>planning to be married in 2 months.  I haven't noticed any St. Louis</B>
<P><B>folk telling any expiences. I know your out there. We have our fair</B>
<P><B>share of spooky places.</B>
<P>
<P><B>O.K., here it goes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I too have seen these "imps"- small black shadowy creatures. They

remind</B>
<P><B>me more of cats. When I was a child maybe 4 yrs old I remember just

be</B>
<P><B>fore falling asleep I would see black almost shadowy cats move

silently</B>
<P><B>across my  hard wood floor. We didn't have animals at the time. I

can't</B>
<P><B>decide if I was dreaming or if it really happened. I do know that

they</B>
<P><B>did not scare me. But to fast forward to about a month ago.  (my

bedroom</B>
<P><B>is three steps from my bathroom) I got up around 4:30am, to get my

mate</B>
<P><B>off to work. I didn't turn on any lights so wouldn't wake him, on my

way</B>
<P><B>out of the bathroom I almost tripped over my cat, Church.(Yeah, yeah,

I</B>
<P><B>know pretty corny- But he is a dead ringer for the cat in "PET</B>
<P><B>SEMATARY," I swear.) Any way, Just as I almost tripped over church

and</B>
<P><B>see him shoot in to my son's room, (the opposite direction from my</B>
<P><B>bedroom, I might add) I take 2 steps to my bedroom to find Church</B>
<P><B>sleeping on my husband-to-be's chest. I just thought I was going

crazy</B>
<P><B>and pushed it out of my mind. Until I read some of your stories.

After</B>
<P><B>thinking about it I know I almost tripped over something. I not nuts</B>
<P><B>(contrary to popular belife.)</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now this cold be one of 3 things, 1) I am completly goofy. 2) my cat

has</B>
<P><B>so  much energy his spirit runs all over the house even when he is</B>
<P><B>sleeping.  or 3)It was one of those shadow cats from when I was a kid.

-</B>
<P><B>any comments?</B>
<P>
<P><B>I hope you add this to your site because I think people probably see</B>
<P><B>stuff like this all the time and just think they are going bonkers,

so</B>
<P><B>they put it out of their minds. </B>
<P><B>Thank you for giving me the opprotunity to share.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My dad worked in an M&amp;M factory around 1990. He loved working

there</B>
<P><B>because he could eat all the M &amp; M's he could eat. He told me that

there</B>
<P><B>were a couple of times he felt kind of weird, like there was a

ghostly</B>
<P><B>presence but ignored it. But one day something happened he couldn't</B>
<P><B>ignore.  He was filling some tubes with M &amp; M's (You know the kind

you</B>
<P><B>get around christmas and it has an M &amp;M figure on top of it) then

he</B>
<P><B>turns around and he sees these boxes slowly moving and all of a

sudden</B>
<P><B>they fell on two girls.</B>
<P><B>But they didn't get hurt. Then he was on some kind of lift working

the</B>
<P><B>machinery and all of a sudden he felt that ghostly presence again.
He</B>
<P><B>turned around and he saw a ghost of a woman who was dressed like she</B>
<P><B>came the 1920's. Big hat a flowery dress.  He only saw her for 15</B>
<P><B>seconds but it's something he would never forget.</B>
