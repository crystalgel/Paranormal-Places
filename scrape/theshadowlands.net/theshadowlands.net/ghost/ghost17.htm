</H3><P><B>by mayra@gate.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had an experience more than a year ago. I was at my lowest point
of my</B>
<P><B>life..my business had just gone bankrupt, I lost my house, my boyfriend
and</B>
<P><B>I hated each other, and I lost my two cats that I adored and I was
going</B>
<P><B>thru a very deep depression. I moved back home and spent my days in
bed</B>
<P><B>with uncontrollable sobs heading for a nervous breakdown. My thoughts
had</B>
<P><B>turned to suicidal but kept them to myself because I couldn't tell
my</B>
<P><B>parents or my brother about them because I loved them so much and
didn't</B>
<P><B>want to hurt them and scare them. I felt I was a failure and couldn't</B>
<P><B>believe my parents had lost so much money because of me. I felt
worthless,</B>
<P><B>and all I wanted to do was lay there and die. I had withdrew into a
shell</B>
<P><B>which I wouldn't let anyone in. On the third day, as I lay crying,
I looked</B>
<P><B>across to my brothers dresser and saw a picture of my aunt, uncle and
four</B>
<P><B>year old cousin who had died in the devastating earthquake that hit
Mexico</B>
<P><B>City many years ago. As I looked at the picture, I felt a strange
feeling</B>
<P><B>go thru my body. It was almost as if time stood still for a second
or two.</B>
<P><B>I closed my eyes and began to think of them. All of a sudden, the
terrible</B>
<P><B>sobs that burst out of me just stopped and I hugged myself tight,
confused</B>
<P><B>at what I was feeling. I then felt a very strong presence next to me
and</B>
<P><B>began to feel my hair being stroked. It was a loving touch, as when
someone</B>
<P><B>is trying to comfort you.  I opened my eyes and saw that I was alone,
and</B>
<P><B>that my cat was sitting at the other end of the room. It was such a</B>
<P><B>beautiful feeling, that I just lay there and did not want it to go
away. I</B>
<P><B>was neither scared or confused anymore. I knew that it was my family
coming</B>
<P><B>to comfort me and to make me understand that life goes on and that
I needed</B>
<P><B>to start my life over again. As I felt my hair being stroked, I felt
a wave</B>
<P><B>of peace flowing thru me, all the anger and pain just melting away.
My</B>
<P><B>tears dried and I just lay there wrapped in a circle of love. I could
feel</B>
<P><B>my body tingling, a feeling I had never felt before. It was peace.
Total</B>
<P><B>peace. I don't know how long they were with me, but it felt like ten</B>
<P><B>minutes or so. Finally, it stopped and I was left feeling so much better.
I</B>
<P><B>got up and from that day on, my life was so much better and I was able
to</B>
<P><B>deal with what happened and not let it destroy me. </B>

<H3><A NAME=strange>Strange Occurrences</A>
</H3><P><B>by ivan.talley@dir.state.tx.us</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story took place in Denver, Colorado in late 1979. I was stationed
at</B>
<P><B>Lowry AFB for training at the Air Force Air Intelligence Training Center.
I</B>
<P><B>consider myself a very objective person but this incident shook me
up. I'll</B>
<P><B>relate the events as accurately as possible and you be the judge.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My roommate at the time was an older guy, 26 or so, from Kentucky.
I</B>
<P><B>was 18 and had only been in the Air Force 3 or 4 months. Like many</B>
<P><B>people I was interested in paranormal activity and began reading some</B>
<P><B>books on this subject. One of these books mentioned a ritual on how
to</B>
<P><B>summon a demon. My friends and I were contemplating a trip to a</B>
<P><B>reportedly haunted old hotel, The Peck House, in Empire approximately
an</B>
<P><B>hour or so away, so this kind of subject was often on my mind at the</B>
<P><B>time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, one evening in our room on base my roommate and I were</B>
<P><B>"playing" around and tried to summon this demon by name. I don't
recall</B>
<P><B>where I got the name from but wouldn't give it out anyway. At one
point</B>
<P><B>we both began to feel a "coldness" that I refer to as an ion wind
coming</B>
<P><B>from the corner of the room where my bed was located. Well, after
some</B>
<P><B>time we attributed it to a draft or something (this was winter in
Denver)</B>
<P><B>and  nothing significant happened so we got ready for bed. We each
had</B>
<P><B>a twin size bed in the same room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After laying down on my bed I noticed that it was vibrating pretty</B>
<P><B>violently, almost like those old magic fingers beds in motels. This
scared</B>
<P><B>me pretty bad, to the point that I jumped across the room into my</B>
<P><B>roommate's bed vowing that I would not sleep in mine. Of course, like</B>
<P><B>young guys do, he ridiculed me pretty badly and laughed. He said he'd</B>
<P><B>sleep in my bed. Well, almost as soon as his head hit the pillow his
eyes</B>
<P><B>got wide as saucers and he jumped up from the bed bellowing that the</B>
<P><B>damn thing was moving. This guy was not the type of person to be</B>
<P><B>intimidated easily and I was nearly as frightened by his reaction as
I was</B>
<P><B>by the incident itself.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After 17 years I don't really remember how we passed the night but
I do</B>
<P><B>recall that after this incident that we both started "missing" things.
I don't</B>
<P><B>believe he had anything to do with this since we were both required
to</B>
<P><B>be in classes all day without much opportunity to get back to the room
for</B>
<P><B>mischief. Specifically I remember one case where I was missing one
of</B>
<P><B>my combat boots from a pair I often wore. Our room consisted of one</B>
<P><B>main living/bedroom area about 12' x 15' , a small bathroom, and two</B>
<P><B>closets. Not many places to lose things in such a small place. I
looked</B>
<P><B>everywhere for that boot but was not able to find it. Then, one day
I</B>
<P><B>came home from class and there was my boot in the middle of the floor</B>
<P><B>where I couldn't have missed it with my eyes closed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Just a few days after all of this we both relocated to different
rooms</B>
<P><B>with different roommates and I never heard any reports of strange</B>
<P><B>happenings in that room. I was just glad to be out of there. I take
this type</B>
<P><B>of occurrence much more seriously than before. </B>

<H3><A NAME=demons>Black Demons</A>
</H3><P><B>by psrpw@UAA.ALASKA.EDU</B>
<P>
<P><B>Two summers ago, I had awoken from sleep and I saw a huge black thing
in </B>
<P><B>the corner of my room.  I could only feel fear that seemed to come
from </B>
<P><B>the black sphere shaped object.  The next night following I was awoken
</B>
<P><B>again by the same thing at the same time ( 3:14 a.m.). </B>
<P><B>	The best way to discribe this entity is to tell you how it </B>
<P><B>looked.  First of all it didn't have a humanoid shape to it, a black
</B>
<P><B>glowing humongous ball is the best way to describe it.  If or when
it was </B>
<P><B>present in my room my cat would go crazy tring to escape from my room.
 </B>
<P><B>My cat even tried to escape out of a closed window.  </B>
<P><B>	Two days later I decided to tell my mother this story.  She </B>
<P><B>didn't believe me, until my brother saw the same object I did.  He
was </B>
<P><B>sleeping in another room at the time and it woke him up.  He was </B>
<P><B>paralyzed with fear.  </B>
<P><B>	The Demon never once entered my mothers room, but; it payed me a </B>
<P><B>nightly visit every night, I would wake up every night at the same
time. </B>
<P><B> It once touched me.  It felt very cold.  </B>
<P><B>	The way that I got rid of it was I had a dream.  I don't remember
</B>
<P><B>now but something told me to place a holy palm leave in this exact
spot </B>
<P><B>in my room on the wall.  It was very important that it be placed in
this </B>
<P><B>exact spot.  That night I was visited by it.  My mother also heard
</B>
<P><B>children laughing while she was sleeping.  She believes the laughter
was </B>
<P><B>from angels.</B>

<H3><A NAME=cathy>Cathy</A>
</H3><P><B>by lpjs@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, this is kind of new to me. You really feel like you can't tell</B>
<P><B>anyone about something like this, but i'm going to try anyway...</B>
<P><B>  Back when I was in the 3rd grade, my neighbor and I went to see A
</B>
<P><B>movie in Waldorf,MD. We stopped at his aunts house at around 7:00pm
</B>
<P><B>before the showing of our movie. The house was a rather large one from
</B>
<P><B>what I remember, quite old too. (gave it a gothic feel). Anyway, at
one </B>
<P><B>point I excused myself to use the restroom. I had to walk down the
hall</B>
<P><B>and over atype of overpass where you could see the floor below you.
I </B>
<P><B>happened to look down and saw a young girl in pink pajamas and a toy
</B>
<P><B>giraffe looking up at me. I was new to this house and didn't quite
know </B>
<P><B>anyone, so I waved and smiled back. I then used the bathroom and went
</B>
<P><B>back downstairs with my friends family. I didn't see the little girl
so </B>
<P><B>I asked about her. They smiled and asked if I saw Cathy. I learned
that </B>
<P><B>Cathy was the previous tenants daughter who died of Lieukeimia in the
</B>
<P><B>house..... I think back on it now and then. It never really scares
me, </B>
<P><B>just makes me wonder. Well, thats my story if you decide to believe
it. </B>
<P><B>I have no real reason to lie to a complete stranger. Especially one
that </B>
<P><B>seems to understand...</B>

<H3><A HREF="http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/two">Living with Two Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by rlthomas@ucdavis.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've lived in about 40 different houses, as my father was an
electrical</B>
<P><B>engineer and we moved from site to site for the different jobs he did.
 We</B>
<P><B>moved from California to Oregon, Oregon to Washington and back to</B>
<P><B>California.  I can say we have lived in 2 haunted houses.  We recently
moved</B>
<P><B>into our third haunted house. There are so many things going on I think
I</B>
<P><B>might have some of the University's "paranormal" come by.  (As I typed
that</B>
<P><B>a swift wind blew through my office).  Anyway.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We recently moved into a rental house (we've lived there a short 1
1/2</B>
<P><B>months) in the older section of the town of Woodland, California. The
house</B>
<P><B>is approximately 50 years old, with only one owner and his wife.  They
also</B>
<P><B>had a small child who was 3 who died of leukemia.  I found out after
doing</B>
<P><B>some research that the husband had died about 14 years ago.  The women
is</B>
<P><B>still living, and recently been placed in a convalescent hospital.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Our first couple of days in the house, I felt just a presence.  It's</B>
<P><B>indescribable, but those of you who know the feeling, you're not alone.
 If</B>
<P><B>you feel something like that, there probably is a spirit of someone
living</B>
<P><B>with you. I've grown so used to it, our joke between my daughter and</B>
<P><B>husband, is "what did the ghost do today".  It's actually kinda cool,
if you</B>
<P><B>just accept the spirit and offer it something like a glass of milk
and</B>
<P><B>cookies for the little boy or perhaps a cake for letting us stay...I
don't</B>
<P><B>think our ghosts are there to harm us, because I think it's the only
house</B>
<P><B>they ever knew or stayed at.  My family just accepts it and it's
quite</B>
<P><B>interesting when something happens that takes physical input and no
one is</B>
<P><B>around.  Our occurences happen almost daily. Most of the time late
at night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Things seem to center on the kitchen which is a huge ranch kitchen.
 All of</B>
<P><B>us have had something missing from the kitchen that we KNOW we have
placed</B>
<P><B>on the kitchen buffet.  (Two silver rings, two five dollar bills and
a set</B>
<P><B>of gloves).</B>
<P>
<P><B>We hear people walking into the house and shuting the door and standing
and</B>
<P><B>talking in the kitchen.   My husband has heard a child crying and
laughing,</B>
<P><B>I've heard a man talking and my daughter has heard a man talking.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The unexplainable are things like the faucet coming on at a moments
notice,</B>
<P><B>the timer buzzer going off on the stove, my daughter's stereo tape
player</B>
<P><B>coming on and shutting off....etc.   Most of this happens at night
when we</B>
<P><B>are alone in the house.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>If anyone can offer any explanation, please feel free.  I know we're
living</B>
<P><B>with a couple ghosts.  It's just kinda cool.  I keep waiting for them
to</B>
<P><B>show themselves to me...now that might scare me on second thought.</B>

<H3><A NAME=dog>My Family`s Pet Dog !</A>
</H3><P><B>by 96004401@taper.georcoll.on.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was born in England, and my father was in the R.A.F(Royal Air
Force)</B>
<P><B>and so, we would move often. When i was around 8 years old, my family</B>
<P><B>moved to Lossiemouth, a port town in Scotland. We had a dog, called</B>
<P><B>Kristie, a labrador, and when we moved to Lossiemouth, Kristie was</B>
<P><B>getting farely old. One night, about 6 months later, Kristie became
ill,</B>
<P><B>and my father took Kristie to the vet, and that was the last time i
saw</B>
<P><B>her. My family cried that night, and we felt terrible for a long time</B>
<P><B>after. Well, a year had passed, and my father was to be tranfered
again,</B>
<P><B>this time to High Wycombe in England, we got ready and everything was</B>
<P><B>packed ready to leave. We were catching a flight down on Monday
morning.</B>
<P><B>It was Saturday night, and everyone was asleep, when i woke up to hear
a</B>
<P><B>dog whining. Just outside my parents room, the floor was of wood, and</B>
<P><B>that night i could hear dogs feet walking on it. Although, i was</B>
<P><B>terrifed i got up, and opened my bedroom door, which was situated
right</B>
<P><B>beside my parents, and on the floor just outside their room was
Kristie</B>
<P><B>scratching at my parents door. The kristie saw me, looked at me for
a</B>
<P><B>couple of seconds, then ran down the hall. I never saw kristie again.</B>
<P><B>The next morning, i told my parents, and now think, Kristie was just</B>
<P><B>saying good bye for the last time.</B>

<H3><A NAME="5 year">Ghost Attacks 5 Year-Old</A>
</H3><P><B>by robert@zen.humbug.org.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Anne and I live in Brisbane,  Australia.  I am sending
from</B>
<P><B>a friend's account.  </B>
<P><B>	My story isn't as scary as the first one about the ghost in the blue</B>
<P><B>gown.  But to a five year old,  any supernatural experience is scary</B>
<P><B>enough.  When I was about five,  I was a very sensitive sort of kid.</B>
<P><B>I'm not sure whether the house we were living in was old but
something</B>
<P><B>about it always seemed to make me uneasy.  Anyway to put it simply,
 one</B>
<P><B>night I was in bed by myself and the next thing this black hand
appeared</B>
<P><B>before me.  It was just a disembodied black hand floating in mid-air.
 I</B>
<P><B>was too petrified to scream,  so in sheer terror I burrowed under the</B>
<P><B>sheets.  The thing came through the sheets.  In my baby mind I
believed</B>
<P><B>that it was trying to peck off my nose.  Eventually I was able to
scream</B>
<P><B>and my father turned on the light and the thing disappeared.  My
father,</B>
<P><B>being a logical sort,  believed it was just my imagination,  but I
have</B>
<P><B>never been too sure.  </B>
<P><B>	Ever since then I have been afraid of the dark.  I never found out</B>
<P><B>about the history of the house.  I seem to be very sensitive to the</B>
<P><B>supernatural if that is what it is. For instance,  I am sure there
was</B>
<P><B>something in the house that I'm living in now.  For six weeks I would</B>
<P><B>hear these footsteps just walking around down the hallway.  One night
I</B>
<P><B>convinced myself that there was nothing there and I sat in the lounge</B>
<P><B>playing computer games.  Around 2 o'clock,  I felt a presence and the</B>
<P><B>feeling that I was intruding.  I could not shake it off.  I felt as
if I</B>
<P><B>was going against a brick wall.  When I went to bed the feeling was</B>
<P><B>gone.  Since then I have not felt the presence.  I think it has gone.
 </B>
<P><B>	I think that everybody has the ability to sense the supernatural,
 but</B>
<P><B>that some people are more sensitive than others to it.  For instance,
 I</B>
<P><B>often feel as if there is something there and when I was younger, 
I saw</B>
<P><B>things move and had a premonition.</B>
